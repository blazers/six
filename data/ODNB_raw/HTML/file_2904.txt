<span class="headword">Borgard,  Albert</span> <span class="st"> [Albrecht Borgaard or Borregaard]</span>  (1659&#150;1751), <span class="occ">artillery officer</span>, was born at Holb&aelig;k, Jutland, on 10 November 1659 of unknown parents. He is generally referred to as Albert Borgard in English sources and Albrecht Borgaard or Borregaard in Danish. He joined the Danish army in the Queen's regiment of foot in 1675 during the war between Sweden and Denmark, when he saw much active service on land and sea. He was made a gunner in 1676 and was promoted <i>fyrv&#339;rker</i> or fireworker, a junior officer rank, in 1678. Described as one of &#145;de Conducteurer der forstaar Geometri&#146;  (cited in Rockstroh), that is, a land surveyor with a knowledge of trigonometrical surveying techniques, he spent 1680&#150;81 as a land surveyor in Zealand. In 1680 he described in his memoir how he &#145;was ordered to Berlin in exchange of two Brandenburgher Fireworkers sent to Denmark to learn the difference of each Nations work, relating to all sorts of warlike and pleasant fireworks&#146;  (Hine, 130, from Borgard's memoir (fair copy), damaged by enemy action in 1940, remains preserved at Woolwich arsenal). He studied fortification in Strasbourg in 1681 and then returned as a lieutenant to his original regiment of foot. He served in 1683 at the relief of Vienna from the Turkish siege. He helped construct the fortifications at Christiansburg and then went on to serve at the battle of Gran and the siege of Buda.<br>
<br>In 1688 Borgard left the Danish army and fled abroad. The reasons for his flight are not clear. In his memoir he states the reason to have been &#145;some Injustice done me in my promotion&#146;  (Hine, 131). <span class="italic">Dansk biografisk leksikon</span>, however, mentions that he had been implicated in a treasonable matter and also the threat of a duel, which resulted from his having been passed over in promotion  (Rockstroh). Whatever the reason, the result was that between 1686 and 1692 he made his way round Europe fighting in various armies. He first went to Poland as a volunteer, but later accepted a commission in the Prussian guards, with whom he served on the Rhine and at the siege of Bonn. In 1692 he left the Prussian army with a commission to raise a regiment for the emperor, but failing in this he joined the army of Louis XIV and distinguished himself in the attack on Namur. He declined a commission in the French army, not least because of his resolute protestantism, and joined the English artillery.<br>
<br>Though only thirty-three years old when he joined the English service, Borgard was one of the most experienced artillery and engineer officers in the world, having both theoretical and practical experience of all aspects of artillery, engineering, and surveying work. He was made a firemaster in the English service in 1693 and, having that year sought in vain to return to the Danish service, served thereafter with the English. He was made captain and adjutant of the artillery in Flanders in 1695 and saw action at the battles of Steenkerke and Landen and at the sieges of Huy and Namur. At the peace of 1697 he was one of only two foreigners retained by the English artillery. He went to England and in 1698 was made an engineer. In 1702 he helped to take the forts of St Catherine, Matagorda, and Durand. Having returned to England, he married in 1703 Barbara Bradshaw (<i>d</i>. 1714); they had several children including George (<i>bap</i>. 1704) and Albert (<i>bap</i>. 1706).<br>
<br>After serving in Flanders, Borgard was gazetted lieutenant-colonel of artillery in 1706 and sent to command the artillery in Spain and Portugal in the army of Lord Galway. He took Valencia de Alc&aacute;ntara, Ciudad Rodrigo, and Alc&aacute;ntara, and enabled Galway to advance into Spain. He superintended the reduction of the castle of San Felipe in Minorca. He was present with Stanhope at the battles of Almanza, Almanar, and Saragossa, where he was wounded, and at Villa Viciosa, where he was wounded, left for dead, and taken prisoner. On being exchanged he returned to England, and was appointed chief firemaster on 9 August 1712. On 7 July 1713 he &#145;made pleasure fireworks which was burnt on the River Thames in the Month of August over against Whitehall on the thanksgiving day for the Peace made at Utrecht&#146;  (Hine, 135). In 1715 he married Cathrine (<i>d</i>. 1754), daughter of Georg Mikkelsen (<i>d</i>. 1665), merchant and head of the Danish church in London, and his wife, Maria Bradshaw. Their children included Thomas Michael (<i>bap</i>. 1717), Cathrine (<i>bap</i>. 1718), Katharine Ambrosia (<i>bap</i>. 1727), Frederick (<i>bap</i>. 1728), and Elizabeth (<i>bap</i>. 1730). Borgard's will shows the complete confidence and trust he placed in his wife.<br>
<br>In 1715 Borgard commanded the artillery train sent to the duke of Argyll in Scotland. In 1716 he was badly injured at Moorfields when metal from captured French guns which were being recast before a distinguished invited audience flew out of control, killing seventeen people and wounding others. In 1716 the Office of Ordnance was reorganized: to reduce expenditure a large number of obsolete posts and ranks were abolished while fighting capacity was enhanced. Individuals whose posts had disappeared were put on the sinking establishment until they could be assigned new duties. Starting in May 1716 Borgard was paid on the sinking establishment until in April 1718 he was made assistant surveyor of the ordnance. From 1717 to 1718 Borgard planned in very considerable detail the needs of the artillery in terms of <i>mat&eacute;riel</i> and its laboratory, on which he had always laid particular emphasis. His object was to equip the artillery for all kinds of land and sea actions, and his planning led directly to the formation of the regiment of Royal Artillery, which is widely regarded as his greatest service to the English artillery. In 1719 he commanded the artillery in the expedition to Vigo, the success of which particularly pleased him and was in large part due to his plans and preparations.<br>
<br>Borgard became the first colonel of the Royal Artillery regiment on 1 April 1722. He was promoted major-general in 1735 and lieutenant-general in 1739. He died at Woolwich, where he was living, on 7 February 1751 and was buried in the Danish church in Marine Square, near the Tower of London. (The date of 15 March 1750 for the proving of his will seems to be an error for 15 March 1751.) He had been a loyal member of the church, a considerable benefactor, and from 1704 a member of the church council. At his death Borgard left one of the finest corps of artillery in the world. It had benefited from his practical experience throughout Europe, but also from his considerable powers of organization, his understanding of the science of fortification, and his dedication to duty and to the education and training of the junior officers of whom he had charge. His legacy lies in the regiment itself, in some installations built to his specifications at Woolwich, and in papers of his at Woolwich and at the British Museum, which cast considerable light on the functioning of the artillery during his lifetime.<br>
