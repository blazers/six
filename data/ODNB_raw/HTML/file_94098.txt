<span class="headword">Nuttgens,  Patrick John</span>  (1930&#150;2004), <span class="occ">architect, broadcaster, and educationist</span>, was born on 2 March 1930 at The Studio, Whiteleaf, Monks Risborough, Buckinghamshire, the second son and third of four children of Joseph Edward Nuttgens (1892&#150;1982), professionally known as J. E. Nuttgens, a stained-glass artist of German origin, and his first wife, Mary Catherine (Kathleen) (1890&#150;1937), daughter of John Clarke, a magistrate, tax collector, and small farmer of Possextown, co. Meath, Ireland. His parents were both Roman Catholics and had met in Chipping Campden, Gloucestershire, a centre of the arts and crafts movement, where Kathleen Clarke, a highly intelligent, strong minded, and volatile young woman, was tutoring the children of a local family. By the mid-1930s the Nuttgens family had settled at North Dean, in the Chilterns near High Wycombe. On a four-acre site on Pigotts Hill, Joseph Nuttgens built a house and stained-glass studio named Glasyers. As a child Patrick learned to cut, paint, and glaze glass. Across the fields at Pigotts lived another, more notorious Catholic craftsman, Eric Gill, along with his extended family, assistants, and apprentices. The lives of the Gill and Nuttgens families were intertwined to the extent of Patrick serving daily mass in the Gill chapel, too young to work out that the resident priest was often suffering the after-effects of the previous night's drinking in the local pub.<br>
<br>When Nuttgens was seven his mother died suddenly of kidney failure. The news reached him when he was in his first miserable term at Grace Dieu Manor, a Catholic boys' preparatory school near Leicester. He attributed to the shock and trauma of the loss a nervous breakdown later in his life which brought him to consider suicide. Two years after his wife's death Patrick's father married Daphne Reid, whom Patrick described tartly as coming &#145;from a very respectable middle class family&#146;  (Nuttgens, 21). She and Nuttgens's father had eight more children&#151;four girls and four boys. A second cataclysmic event occurred when Patrick was twelve, and by then at the Catholic boarding school, Ratcliffe College. Captaining the junior rugby team, he stumbled off the pitch with extreme pain in his back and within hours was paralysed with poliomyelitis from the waist down. He endured the next two years in St Vincent's Orthopaedic College in Middlesex, and was discharged with a calliper on one leg and his torso in plaster. He wore a back brace or surgical belt all his life. A strong characteristic in Nuttgens was his aptitude in finding the uses of adversity. Unable to play games on returning to school in late 1944, he determined to excel in scholarship, winning every class prize for that year. He became a star performer in the school debating society, precociously developing his communication skills. Most importantly, inspired by travels with his father around Britain's country houses and cathedrals, he set his mind on becoming a great architect.<br>
<br>In 1948 Nuttgens went north to Edinburgh, discovering the city he regarded as &#145;a work of art, a civilisation, an education in itself&#146;  (Nuttgens, 52). He studied art and architecture on a new joint course at Edinburgh College of Art and Edinburgh University. It was there that he met Bridget Ann (Biddy) Badenoch (<i>b</i>. 1931), second daughter of Alexander Badenoch, a remarkable local doctor, a former medical missionary and Catholic convert. Biddy was studying English Literature. Nuttgens enrolled in English classes so that he could sit beside her. Their marriage, on 21 August 1954, was the beginning of a close and fruitful partnership. They brought up six sons (one a foster child) and three daughters, and collaborated on several books on architecture.<br>
<br>Nuttgens appreciated buildings conceived in the grand manner. The work of Sir Edwin Lutyens was a speciality of his, and the subject of an ebullient television programme which he wrote and presented. But he was intensely interested too in the living conditions of ordinary people, finding a productive subject for post-graduate research in the vernacular architecture of the north-east lowlands, in particular a group of fishing villages north of Aberdeen. He gained his PhD from Edinburgh in 1959. Meanwhile when the architect Robert Matthew was setting up the new department of architecture at Edinburgh University he appointed Nuttgens as his chief administrator, recognizing his talent as a course planner and teacher as much as an architectural practitioner.<br>
<br>The ever-resilient Nuttgens recovered from the worst bout of depression he had yet endured to embark, in 1962, on what he later described as &#145;the most exciting and totally absorbing experience I have ever had&#146;  (Nuttgens, 83). This was his crucial involvement in the creation of the new university at York. First as director of the Institute of Advanced Architectural Studies and then, from 1968, as professor of architecture (a personal chair), Nuttgens was the link between the academics and the architects in developing the concept of what in that utopian period of university expansion appeared an ideal place of learning on the outskirts of the city: interdisciplinary buildings linked by covered walkways grouped around a central lake. He was also evolving radical methods of teaching. At the institute Nuttgens had devised short courses for architects, planners, builders, and engineers. These were professional, technical, and specific, reflecting his inherited belief in hands-on practice and professional collaboration. At York he opened out channels of communication between the university and the architectural masterpiece of York itself, teaching himself the detail of the city by walking round and round the walls. He came to love the city deeply, realizing that what made it &#145;the most beautiful, tantalising and coherent place&#146; was &#145;its contempt for the set piece and the grand gesture&#146;  (<span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span>, 5 April 2004). From the mid-1960s he entered vociferously into long-running local planning controversies, defending the historic city centre from what he saw as ruination by crudely designed, characterless office blocks.<br>
<br>Nuttgens was the product of two traditions: education for its own sake and, through his arts and crafts connections, education for a purpose, by means of practical experiment. The possibilities of merging these two approaches excited him when he was appointed the first director of Leeds Polytechnic in 1969. He liked the broad scope of an institution that combined technology, commerce, art, and teacher training, and was ambitious in his aims to make the former municipal college of technology into an institution of international reputation. Nuttgens was determined to put creativity back in the forefront of higher education. A characteristically imaginative gesture when he first arrived at Leeds was his relandscaping of the barren city centre site, forming grassy mounds which the students named Mount Nuttgens. But although his underlying ideas received attention nationally, and Leeds Polytechnic came to be accepted as one of the UK's leading educational institutions, these were problematic years in which Nuttgens's characteristic optimism was tested to the full. The polytechnic was harried by a local education authority unconvinced by Nuttgens's visionary outlook, and sabotaged from within by student protests of the period. He felt bitter about what he saw as the betrayal of the polytechnic principle by the Thatcher governments of the 1980s and he resigned in 1986, shortly before polytechnics were absorbed into a hugely expanded university system.<br>
<br>Nuttgens's health had by now deteriorated with the onset of multiple sclerosis (or what may possibly have been post-polio syndrome) and from now on he always used a wheelchair or sped along the corridors on an electric bike. &#145;I may be a man of parts&#146; he said, &#145;but some don't work as well as they once did&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Guardian</span>, 17 March 2004). His good humour and energy were undiminished. The most widely influential of his architecture books were published at this period: <span class="italic">Pocket Guide to Architecture</span> (1980), <span class="italic">The Story of Architecture</span> (1983), and <span class="italic">Understanding Modern Architecture</span> (1988). His quick brain, breadth of knowledge, fluency, and wit made him a popular pundit on such radio programmes as <span class="italic">A Word in Edgeways</span> and <span class="italic">Round Britain Quiz</span>. His career in television burgeoned, too. In 1989, for example, he wrote and presented&#151;from his wheelchair&#151;a television history of British housing, <span class="italic">The Home Front</span>. He had the gift of disseminating information compellingly while never talking down. Late in life, as administrative burdens lessened, he returned to the sheer enjoyment of his watercolour drawings, vivid impressionistic architectural scenes.<br>
<br>In 2000 Nuttgens's autobiography, <span class="italic">The Art of Learning: a Personal Journey</span>, was published. He was by now a considerable public figure: appointed a CBE in 1983, and holder of honorary degrees from five universities. But the story of his journey, related in endearingly personal terms, is a simple tale of fortitude, of difficulties triumphantly surmounted with the support of a large and loving family and strong, if critical, religious faith. After the onset of pneumonia, followed by multiple strokes, Nuttgens died on 15 March 2004 at York Hospital. He was survived by his wife and children. His funeral at the Roman Catholic church of St Leonard and St Mary, Malton, was followed by burial on 24 March in the village churchyard close to the Nuttgens's last home, Roselea Cottage, at Terrington, near York. A widely attended memorial service was held in September 2004 in York Minster, the city to which he felt most closely attached.<br>
<br>It is not as the &#145;great architect&#146; of his childhood ambitions that Nuttgens will be best remembered, but as a highly original philosopher of learning, one of the prime movers in the &#145;education through capability&#146; movement of the 1990s, emphasizing the importance of the visual, creative, and vocational in forming a balanced personality. Nuttgens's popularization of art and architecture can be compared to that of John Ruskin in the nineteenth century. With his wonderful lucidity, largely through the medium of the television documentary, he opened people's eyes to the underlying meaning of the man-made world.<br>
