<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Thompson,  William</span>  (1805&#150;1852), <span class="occ">naturalist</span>, was born on 2 November 1805 at a house in Wellington Place, Belfast, the eldest son and third child of William Thompson (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1830), linen merchant, and his wife, Elizabeth Calwell 
    (or Callwell; <i>d</i>. 1853)
  . He received a commercial education in Belfast, intended to enable him to follow his father in the linen trade (an occupation which held little interest for him). After his father's death, Thompson devoted his time to his interests in natural history. A quiet person of gentle and fastidious demeanour, he was never comfortable with the details required to dissect animals and prepare them for study. Instead he concentrated on the observation of birds, plants, algae, and Cirripedia (barnacles).<br>
<br>Thompson travelled to the eastern Mediterranean (with the naturalist Edward Forbes) as a guest on the surveying ship <i>Beacon</i>. He also travelled to many locations in Ireland and Scotland to observe and make detailed notes of the appearance and behaviour of birds, both rare and common. Except when travelling for scientific purposes, he lived at his house in Donegall Square, Belfast, from which he conducted an extensive scientific correspondence. Active in the Belfast Natural History Society from the age of twenty-one, Thompson was elected president in 1843; he retained the office until his death. He was also a corresponding member of the Natural History Society of Boston and of the Academy of Natural Sciences in Philadelphia, USA.<br>
<br>Thompson's major work is <span class="italic">The Natural History of Ireland</span>. The first three volumes appeared between 1849 and 1851; the fourth was published posthumously in 1856, under the combined editorship of Robert Patterson, George Dickie, and Robert Ball. The work is a detailed account of Thompson's observations of birds in Ireland and Scotland, many of which later became rare. It was the first comprehensive and detailed book on Irish birds and was planned to be part of a complete Irish natural history. Thompson also published about seventy-five minor papers on subjects of natural history.<br>
<br>Thompson was highly regarded by his contemporaries, including Forbes and Charles Darwin (who wrote of him as a &#145;most accurate observer&#146;), and he has been described as the foremost Irish zoologist of his day. Darwin's copy of <span class="italic">The Natural History of Ireland</span> survives with hundreds of handwritten annotations; when read together, these show that Darwin paid close attention to Thompson's meticulous observations of wild and domesticated birds and the changes in their habitat or behaviour that may have contributed to their survival or extinction. Darwin cites Thompson in his works as a source of information, and the two men corresponded. Thompson was aware of several of Darwin's works, including his narrative of the <i>Beagle</i> voyage.<br>
<br>Little of Thompson's own scientific correspondence survives but, in a letter to him from Darwin (1 March 1849), Darwin praises Thompson for having provided much of interest in his natural history, and comments that Thompson's extensive collection of British and North American barnacles and other Cirripedia &#145;will be <i>invaluably</i> useful to me&#146;  (<span class="italic">Correspondence</span>, vol. 4).<br>
<br>Thompson died on 17 February 1852 at his lodgings in Jermyn Street, London, apparently after a heart attack while on a visit to give a scientific lecture. He was buried soon after in the Clifton Street graveyard, Belfast. He never married.<br>
