<span class="headword">Dodgson <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Spooner]</span>,  (Frances) Catharine</span>  (1883&#150;1954), <span class="occ">portrait painter</span>, was born on 15 December 1883 at Oxford, the eldest daughter of the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36219/', "Revd William Archibald Spooner (1844&#150;1930)")</script>, afterwards warden of New College, Oxford, and his wife, Frances Wycliffe, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/10992/', "Harvey Goodwin")</script>, bishop of Carlisle. At the age of fifteen she studied drawing at the Ruskin School of Drawing at Oxford, and later attended the Royal Academy Schools and (for a short period) the Slade School of Fine Art. In 1913 she married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32848/', "Campbell Dodgson (1867&#150;1948)")</script>, keeper of prints and drawings in the British Museum, and from that time until her husband's retirement in 1932 she was chiefly occupied with social and domestic responsibilities in her house in Montagu Square, and found little time for drawing or painting. An oil painting by her, a portrait of Dean Inge (whose wife was her first cousin), was exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1923; but it was not until the middle of the 1930s that Catharine Dodgson began again to indulge her artistic inclinations, and it was from then onwards that most of her surviving work was produced. She then abandoned painting in oils, and her favourite medium, in which she achieved considerable success, was drawing in pen or black or red chalk, with transparent washes of pale brown, often on coloured paper and heightened with white.<br>
<br>Between 1933 and 1945 Catharine Dodgson exhibited about a dozen portrait drawings at the Royal Academy, including those of her husband (1933; British Museum), of Dean Inge (1934; priv. coll.), and of Sir Thomas Barlow (1936; priv. coll.). She had a real flair for catching a likeness, her portrait drawings were in great demand, and she could have had many more commissions than she had time or inclination to carry out. She remained in the best sense an amateur; she was too conscientious to enjoy a commission for its own sake, and she lacked the self-confidence that enables a professional portrait painter to impose his personality on a subject in which he is not particularly interested. Her best portraits, therefore, were those of her own family, of intimate friends, or of children.<br>
<br>A visit with her husband to W&uuml;rzburg, and the charming gardens of Veitsh&ouml;chheim, provided Dodgson with a new source of inspiration, with equally successful results; and excellent examples of her elegant drawings of German rococo sculpture, made on this occasion, are now in the Ashmolean Museum at Oxford and in various private collections. In the same vein she drew the busts of Sir Christopher Wren by Edward Pierce (Ashmolean Museum) and Charles II by Honor&eacute; Pelle in the Victoria and Albert Museum. She also produced some drawings of dancers in the Covent Garden Opera in the same medium, and, towards the end of the war of 1939&#150;45, some sketches of Regent's Park, rather more elaborate in colour, and remarkable for their lightness and deftness of touch.<br>
<br>Her husband's illness a year or two before his death in 1948 affected Catharine Dodgson's own health very seriously, and she hardly drew again; she died in London on 30 April 1954. Two exhibitions of her drawings were held at Colnaghi's in Bond Street, in the autumn of 1936 and in the spring of 1939, and both were warmly praised by the critics. She was modest to a fault, and was inclined to attribute this success to the writers' friendship with her husband, who was of course widely known and respected in artistic circles. But few seemed to share this view, least of all Campbell Dodgson himself, who was genuinely proud of her achievements. A loan exhibition in her memory was held in the same gallery after her death, October&#150;November 1954.<br>
