<span class="headword">Siberch,  John</span> <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em>Johann Lair  von Siegburg]</span>  (<em>c.</em>1476&#150;1554), <span class="occ">printer</span>, was born in Sieglar (Lair), near Siegburg, Germany, the son of Peter von Lair (<i>d</i>. 1533), a wool weaver, and his wife, Lena. He took his name from Siegburg, where the family moved in his childhood. On 5 December 1492 he matriculated at the University of Cologne. Probably in 1512, or later, he married a sister of Gertrud van Amersfoort, a member of the bookselling and printing family of Franz and Arnold Birckmann of Cologne, and thus became related to some of the major north European humanist printers and booksellers. They had two daughters: the elder, Katharina, married Georg Kessel of Cologne, and the younger was called Baetzgen.<br>
<br>For a while during the second decade of the sixteenth century Siberch was in the service of another Cologne bookseller, Hans Beck; and it was as a bookseller that he moved to Cambridge, possibly influenced in this by Richard Croke, whom he probably met at Leipzig. The first publication bearing his imprint, a work by Croke (1520), was printed by Eucharius Cervicornus at Cologne.<br>
<br>Siberch established his press in Cambridge in 1520 or 1521 with the help of a loan of &pound;20 from the university. His house was on the site of what is now Tree Court, Gonville and Caius College, and his first book was Henry Bullock's <span class="italic">Oratio</span>, a tribute on the occasion of a visit to the university by Cardinal Wolsey in autumn 1520. In 1521 Siberch printed at least seven short books, including an unauthorized edition of <span class="italic">De conscribendis epistolis</span> by his friend Erasmus and Thomas Linacre's translation of Galen's <span class="italic">De temperamentis</span>. Subsequently his authors included John Fisher and Sir Thomas Elyot; he also sought the assurance of an educational market with an edition of Erasmus and Lily's grammar <span class="italic">De octo partium orationis constructione</span>. After a period of considerable activity in 1521, the pace of his printing declined sharply, and Siberch's later work includes more ephemera, such as indulgences, rather than books. He ceased to print at Cambridge probably by the end of 1523. He was also associated with a binding shop, possibly as a part of his bookselling business.<br>
<br>Despite the fame of his authors, Siberch was not commercially very successful as a printer in England. By early 1524 he had left Cambridge, possibly going to Antwerp to work with Franz Birckmann and other members of his wife's family. His wife died in England in the mid-1520s, after which time his relations with her family seem to have become strained. By 1538 he had been ordained priest, and for the remainder of his life he served a parish in Siegburg, where he died at some time before 28 September in 1554. He was probably buried at St Servatius's Church, Siegburg.<br>
