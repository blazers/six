<span class="headword">Fox,  Albert</span>  (1857&#150;1914), <span class="occ">trade union leader and politician</span>, was born at Farnborough, Hampshire, on 7 April 1857, the son of Charles Fox, a private in the 22nd regiment, and his wife, Marcia. He attended the board school at Farnborough until he was twelve, and in his early years was drawn towards railway life. In the early 1880s Fox got a job as an engine cleaner at the Mexborough railway depot. The Associated Society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen (ASLEF) did not admit engine cleaners as members at that time, but in 1886 when he was promoted to fireman he immediately joined the union and played an active role, becoming secretary of the local branch. He noticed that every year some five new orphans resulted from accidental, or other, deaths of members, and in 1889, when he was member of the national executive for Yorkshire, he carried a resolution establishing an orphan fund. When Thomas G. Sunter, the union's general secretary, died on 20 September 1901, a ballot was held to determine his successor and on 8 December Fox was elected.<br>
<br>With new leadership there were important changes in policy. At the union's triennial conference held in Swansea in 1903 it was resolved that membership should be open to engine cleaners and electric motormen. Funds were to be centralized, and an organizing secretary was to be appointed. It was also agreed that the society should affiliate to the Labour Representation Committee and contest a parliamentary constituency. In accordance with the new forward-looking policy, Fox stood in the 1906 general election as the Labour candidate for the South Leeds constituency, where the ASLEF head office was located. In the light of his late adoption he did well to poll 4030 votes to the victorious Liberal's 6200. In a by-election in the same constituency in 1908 he did less well, being beaten into third place by the tory candidate.<br>
<br>Throughout his years as general secretary Fox claimed that it was essential for locomotive men to be organized separately from other railway workers. He expressed this view in evidence given to the royal commission on the railway conciliation scheme of 1907. At a conference with the Amalgamated Society of Railway Servants (ASRS) in 1903 to discuss closer co-operation he said: &#145;It was not merely a question of hours and wages with enginemen. There are 101 ways in which they need protection in their calling which are not known to other workers and which can only be taken in hand by themselves&#146;  (McKillop, 79). Fox's policy was summed up in the words &#145;Organise your craft: federate your union&#146;. At about this time J. H. Thomas of the ASRS pointed out that his union had more locomotive grade members than ASLEF. Not surprisingly the ASRS favoured amalgamation rather than federation, and the negotiations broke down. Nevertheless, during Albert Fox's time as general secretary ASLEF membership rose steadily (from 10,502 in 1901 to 32,200 in 1913), thus strengthening the society's claim to speak for a majority of the 62,000 members of the locomotive grades.<br>
<br>Although ASLEF's programme before 1914 included a maximum eight-hour working day, Fox told a conference called in support of Walter Hudson's <span class="roman">Eight Hours Bill</span> that he had no mandate to go to the House of Commons to secure it &#145;since they felt that if they asked the companies they would get it&#146;  (<span class="italic">Report of a Conference</span>, 10). Fox could, however, act decisively when events required, as happened in August 1911, when the companies refused to recognize the unions and he moved the resolution at ASLEF's Liverpool conference for a national railway strike at twenty-four hours' notice.<br>
<br>Albert Fox was an enthusiastic leader of the locomotive engineer and fireman, but as the union's historian admitted &#145;he lacked the gift of directing others to share the burden of great administration&#146;  (Raynes, 161). Fox's health collapsed in 1912, and he was granted an increase in salary of &pound;50 p.a. and three months' leave, but he failed to recover. He died of pernicious anaemia at his home at 33 Spencer Place, Leeds, on 22 March 1914, and was buried at Beeston cemetery in south Leeds on 27 March 1914. He was survived by his wife, Mary E. Fox, and by one son and one daughter.<br>
