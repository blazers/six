<span class="headword">Corder,  Stephen Pit</span>  (1918&#150;1990), <span class="occ">linguistic scholar</span>, was born on 6 October 1918, at 4 Bootham Terrace, York, the second of the two sons of Philip Corder (<i>b</i>. 1885), schoolmaster, and his wife, Johanna Adriana van der Mersch (<i>b</i>. 1887). His father was English and his mother Dutch. Pit, as he was known to colleagues, attended the Quaker school, Bootham, in York. At Merton College, Oxford (1936&#150;9), he read modern languages. Corder's father belonged to an old Quaker family and was himself a master at Bootham School. After Oxford, Corder taught at Ayton (Quaker) school until he was called up for military service in the Second World War. Having registered as a conscientious objector, he was awarded exemption conditional on his working with the Friends' Ambulance Unit (FAU). He served with the FAU throughout the war period in Finland and Egypt. In 1946 Corder married Nancy Proctor (<i>b</i>. 1916). Second cousins, they maintained his mother's house in the Lake District during their years abroad. They had two sons and a daughter.<br>
<br>After the war Corder joined the British Council, and served in Austria, Turkey, Colombia, and Jamaica. At the time the council was rapidly expanding its English teaching operations worldwide. For this purpose it needed a cadre of specialists. Corder's background in language studies and his own interest in the work led in 1957 to his joining the newly established school of applied linguistics in the University of Edinburgh to study for the postgraduate diploma in applied linguistics. After that year he was seconded for a period to the Nigerian ministry of education in order to develop language teaching materials for television. Then in 1961 he was outposted by the British Council to the University of Leeds, where Peter Strevens, with whom he had served in the FAU, was developing postgraduate training in English language teaching. In 1964 he resigned from the British Council on appointment as director of the school of applied linguistics at the University of Edinburgh. There he remained for the rest of his career, serving successively as senior lecturer, professor of applied linguistics, head of the department of applied linguistics, and head of the very large department of linguistics, which had more than thirty academic staff. He was a founder member of the British Association of Applied Linguistics, following Peter Strevens as its second chair, president of the International Association of Applied Linguistics for two successive periods of three years each, a member of the British Council's English teaching advisory committee, and the first holder of a university chair in applied linguistics in the UK (and possibly in the world). He was promoted to a personal chair in 1971 and was created emeritus professor on retirement in 1983.<br>
<br>The Edinburgh school (later department) of applied linguistics had been set up in the late 1950s with government funding under the Colombo plan to provide at an advanced level research-based training for English teachers from the former colonies. Corder quickly brought together a young and enthusiastic team of academic researchers, and with them developed the influential teaching materials that became internationally known through the four volumes of the <span class="italic">Edinburgh Course in Applied Linguistics</span>, published by Oxford University Press (1973&#150;7). As academic applied linguistics swiftly expanded to other universities, many of Corder's students were appointed to lead the new departments.<br>
<br>Corder's publications chart his own intellectual development, moving from the very traditional (and successful) textbook <span class="italic">An International English Practice Book</span> (1960), through the early attempt to integrate language teaching with situation in <span class="italic">The Visual Element in Language Teaching</span> (1966), on to the magisterial defining of a coherent linguistic discipline in <span class="italic">Introduction to Applied Linguistics</span> (1973), and finally to the innovative cognitive approach in his later papers, brought together in <span class="italic">Error Analysis and Interlanguage</span> (1981). It was these papers in which he offered a view of language learning that captured the imagination of researchers internationally, providing them with a rationale for investigation that remains hugely productive. What Corder pointed to was both daring and obvious, but he was the first to provide the necessary explanation: namely, that the learning of a second or foreign language is developmental, that it follows a sequence that can be checked, and that it can be studied by analysing the errors that learners make. These errors, he insisted, are signs of positive thinking rather than of negative inadequacy. Corder's claim that the learner's language, which, following a seminal paper by Larry Selinker (1972), he termed &#145;interlanguage&#146;, is a language in its own right is now generally accepted.<br>
<br>In spite of the esteem of his colleagues in British applied linguistics, in the late 1970s and 1980s Corder seems to have found himself increasingly isolated intellectually. In part this reflected his growing dissatisfaction with the British tradition of English language teaching, to which applied linguistics was initially attached and which Corder himself had done so much to promote in his early career and in the <span class="italic">Edinburgh Course in Applied Linguistics</span>. That approach he came to see as finally wanting, considering that its attempt to marry bits of theory to practical issues was ultimately incoherent. What was needed, he seems to have thought, was a proper marriage between practice and theory. His dissatisfaction also reflected both his own excitement in ideas, his moving on always to new ventures, and his lack of interest in anything empirical, whether in practice or in research. Language teaching as such did not engage him, thereby absolving his students and younger scholars from any responsibility for the ever-increasing gap between language teaching practice and language acquisition research. Neither was he personally excited by research. That he left to his students. What really mattered to Corder was the sudden poetic or artistic insight, &#145;the incision of inspiration which cut through the clutter of established thought&#146;  (Widdowson, vi).<br>
<br>Corder's ideas were influential but he did not establish a &#145;school&#146;. He inspired by example and by his own intellectual curiosity. He belonged to a very British tradition of speculative curiosity. His hobbies showed that, just as much as did his intellectual interests. His craftsmanship in wood, his music, and his home-making and family were as important to him as his career. He was a man of conviction, clear about his place in the world. That is why he could move from one phase of his career to another with finality. After a series of mild heart attacks he retired in 1983, and when he and his wife moved back to the Lake District he donated all his academic books to his department. They and the rest of his academic life had provided a temporary vehicle for his speculation. He did not look back. Corder died of a heart attack on 27 January 1990 at his home, Burnside Cottage, Braithwaite, near Keswick. He was survived by his wife and children.<br>
