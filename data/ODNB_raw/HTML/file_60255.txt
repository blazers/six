<span class="headword">Barrington <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Wilson]</span>,  Emilie Isabel</span>  (1841&#150;1933), <span class="occ">biographer and novelist</span>, was born on 18 October 1841 at 15 Hertford Street, Mayfair, Westminster, the youngest of the six daughters of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29660/', "James Wilson (1805&#150;1860)")</script> and Elizabeth Preston (<i>d</i>. 1886). Her father was a merchant, an important figure in the Anti-Corn Law League, and the founder of <span class="italic">The Economist</span>. Although her early years were spent on the continent, in 1846 her father bought Fountainville near Westbury, of which town he soon afterwards became the MP. Like her sisters, Emilie Wilson received the normal education of an early Victorian upper middle-class girl, learning a range of languages and accomplishments from governesses. From 1855 to 1856, she attended a school in Cologne with her sister Zoe; in 1858 she went to a finishing school in Paris with Sophie Parnell, sister of the Irish politician C. S. Parnell.<br>
<br>In 1859 James Wilson was appointed financial member of the supreme council of India. Emilie and Julia Wilson remained with their recently married sister, Eliza, and her husband, Walter Bagehot, while their father, mother, and other sisters travelled to India. Following James Wilson's death in August 1860, the Wilson women returned to England and made their home with the Bagehots. In the early 1860s Emilie Wilson formed a close friendship with Emily Faithfull, a Langham Place member and the manager of the Victoria Press: both women were interested in expanding opportunities for women's employment. Still more, Wilson was committed to the improvement of the lower classes through art. She was an amateur artist herself, taking drawing lessons from Arthur Hughes, and an inveterate visitor to art exhibitions and artists' studios.<br>
<br>During a continental tour in 1867 Wilson became engaged to Russell Barrington (<i>d</i>. 1916), the eldest son of the Revd Lowther and Lady Catherine Barrington; they were married on 1 July 1868 at St Peter's, Eaton Square. A quiet, dull man, he tolerated her highly strung and dominant personality, and admired her artistic pretensions. Their first child, Guy, born in 1869, was mentally unstable; their second, Ivo, died in 1871, at the age of four months. In the same bitter year Barrington's submissions to the Royal Academy were rejected.<br>
<br>As a married woman Emilie Barrington aimed to become the hostess for a well-born and artistic London set: in this rather forlorn hope she became, as Wilfrid Blunt cruelly puts it, &#145;an indefatigable pursuer of artistic big game&#146;  (Blunt, 159). About the time of her marriage she met G. F. Watts at Rossetti's studio, and she became an intimate of the Little Holland House circle and a self-designated muse to the artist. After Walter Bagehot's death in 1877 she persuaded her husband and widowed sister to purchase a house on Melbury Road, next to Watts's studio, and she visited him daily, reading to him and playing music for him. Russell Barrington acted as a go-between for Watts and his buyers. This practice ended only after the artist's marriage in 1886: Emilie Barrington's failure to appreciate that she was no longer Watts's hostess and Mary Watts's jealousy led to such acrimony between the two women that the Wattses moved away in 1891. After the artist's death, Mrs Barrington's close friendship with the artist was memorialized in her <span class="italic">Reminiscences of G. F. Watts</span> (1905), a work criticized as unreliable by Watts's widow: in her own copy, she substituted &#145;a poisonous snake&#146; for Mrs Barrington's name, and she published her own memoir in 1912 as a corrective. A later biographer of Watts, Ronald Chapman, disagreed with his widow's verdict, valuing Mrs Barrington's account for the light it shed on the artist's character.<br>
<br>After Watts's marriage Barrington soon transferred her allegiance to Frederic Leighton, forming a friendship with one of his sisters. Her <span class="italic">Life, Letters, and Works of Frederic Leighton</span> appeared in 1906. The first major biography of Leighton and based on family letters and the memories and papers of Leighton's friends, it is a moving and passionate analysis of Leighton's character and mentality. It remains an important source for Leighton's life and career, as the originals of many of the letters quoted in it have since been destroyed. After his death in 1896 Barrington was instrumental in ensuring that Leighton House became a museum, buying and donating several of his works to the museum. She was also a friend and admirer of the arts and crafts artist and designer Walter Crane. Another woman writer on art, Vernon Lee, was less impressed with Mrs Barrington herself: she described her as &#145;a rumpled, scrumpled little brown paper woman, of uncertain artistic pretensions, a sort of King Charles dog of the neighbouring studios&#146;  (Gunn, 87).<br>
<br>In 1881 Barrington played a role in the establishment of the Kyrle Society, the aim of which was to &#145;bring beauty home to the poor&#146;; she painted a portrait of Octavia Hill, its leading figure, in 1889. Her increasing preoccupation with philanthropy&#151;admittedly of a showy variety&#151;was evidenced in the two novels she wrote in the 1890s, <span class="italic">Lena's Picture</span> (1892) and <span class="italic">Helen's Ordeal</span> (1894), where both heroines seek solace for their lovelorn states in helping others and triumph spiritually over material woes. Barrington and her sisters clearly held traditional views on women's role in society as providers of spiritual and material bounty, and three of them&#151;including Emilie&#151;signed the appeal against female suffrage which appeared in the June 1889 issue of the <span class="italic">Nineteenth Century</span>. In the same year she published a rather murky and mystical pamphlet, <span class="italic">The Reality of the Spiritual Life</span>. During the 1880s and 1890s she was also a contributor to periodicals and journals, writing for the <span class="italic">Fortnightly Review</span> and <span class="italic">The Spectator</span>.<br>
<br>In her later years Barrington lived mainly with her sister Eliza in her London home and at Herd's Hill in Langport, Somerset. A photograph of her, probably dating from the first years of the new century, shows a small and delicate-looking woman with a forceful expression. She edited the complete works of Walter Bagehot in nine volumes, the tenth (1915) being essentially a reissue of her life of Bagehot (1914). After the deaths of Russell Barrington and her much-loved daughter-in-law Ida in 1916, and of Eliza Bagehot in 1921, she embarked on <span class="italic">The Servant of All</span> (1927), a life of her father which drips with filial devotion; she also edited <span class="italic">The Love Letters of Walter Bagehot and Eliza Wilson</span> (1933). She died on 9 March 1933 at Herd's Hill. An autobiography, &#145;Memories of a long life&#146;, was probably destroyed after her death. Although energetic, passionate, and able, she found no true outlet for her ambitions in the role of an upper middle-class Victorian wife and mother, and her life has been described as &#145;a record of lost causes and lost confidants&#146;  (Westwater, 115).<br>
