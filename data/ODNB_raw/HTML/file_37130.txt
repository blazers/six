<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Aspinall, Sir  John Audley Frederick</span>  (1851&#150;1937), <span class="occ">mechanical engineer</span>, was born in Liverpool on 25 August 1851, the second of three sons (there was also a daughter) of John Bridge Aspinall QC (1818&#150;1886), who was latterly the recorder of the city of Liverpool, and his wife, Bertha Wyatt, daughter of John Audley Jee, merchant of Mount Vernon, Liverpool, and descendant of the inventor John Wyatt. He was educated at Beaumont College, Berkshire, and in 1868 became a pupil of John Ramsbottom and later F. W. Webb in the locomotive works of the London and North Western Railway at Crewe. At the end of his pupillage in 1872 he was sent to the United States to study developments in railways and steel making. On his return he became assistant manager of the steelworks at Crewe. In 1875 he moved to the Great Southern and Western Railway of Ireland as the works manager and assistant locomotive superintendent at Inchicore, near Dublin, where he was responsible for making improvements to the automatic vacuum brake.<br>
<br>In 1886 Aspinall was invited to become the chief mechanical engineer of the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway, for whom he completed, equipped, and organized the engineering workshops in Horwich, widely regarded as a model of their kind, eventually employing over 10,000 men. In 1899 the company took the unusual step of appointing him general manager, a tribute to his administrative as well as engineering abilities. He succeeded in reversing the downward trend of the railway's fortunes, countering the advance of electric trams by introducing electric traction on suburban railway lines such as Liverpool to Southport, one of the earliest main-line electrification schemes in the country, completed in 1904. He also built up the railway's fleet of passenger and cargo ships sailing to Ireland and the continent from Goole, Fleetwood, and Liverpool; by 1914 it was the largest of any of the British railway companies.<br>
<br>For his work at Horwich in the First World War Aspinall was knighted in 1917. He retired from his position as general manager in 1919 and was appointed a director of the company, but resigned later in the same year on his appointment as consulting mechanical engineer to the newly formed Ministry of Transport, a position he held until 1927.<br>
<br>Throughout this time he took a keen personal interest in the education of young engineers, especially in the Horwich Mechanics' Institute, which he founded in 1888. In 1902 he was appointed associate professor of railway engineering at the University of Liverpool, and from 1908 to 1915 he acted as chairman of the faculty of engineering.<br>
<br>Among many professional distinctions were Aspinall's presidencies of the institutions of Mechanical Engineers (1909) and Civil Engineers, and the (Smeatonian) Society of Civil Engineers (1931). In 1936 he was awarded the James Watt medal of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers for his outstanding contributions to the advance of mechanical engineering.<br>
<br>On 2 September 1874 Aspinall married Gertrude Helen (1852/3&#150;1921), daughter of Francis B. Schr&auml;der of Liverpool. They had one son and three daughters; their son, John Bridge Aspinall, became a QC like his grandfather. Aspinall died at his home, Deerstead House, St John's Hill Road, Woking, on 19 January 1937.<br>
