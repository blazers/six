<span class="headword">Badcock,  John</span> <span class="st"> [<em>pseuds. </em>Jon Bee, John Hinds]</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1810&#150;1830), <span class="occ">writer and journalist</span>, is known only by his works and even the attribution of these is uncertain. He was the probable author of the pretentious introductory chapter to <span class="italic">Pancratia</span>, published in 1811. That year the <span class="italic">Lives of the Boxers</span> also appeared, arguments over the authorship of which contributed to a bitter rivalry between Badcock and Pierce Egan. Badcock's most sustained journalism was as Jon Bee in the 1820s, when he published thirteen volumes of the <span class="italic">Annals of Sporting and Fancy Gazette</span> between 1822 and 1828. Of his works on non-sporting subjects, the <span class="italic">Living Picture of London</span> was compiled as a guide to the city's condition in the year 1818, and a similar volume was produced in 1828. From a note in the <span class="italic">Fancy Gazette</span> (1.330), it appears that the volume entitled <span class="italic">Letters from London: Observations of a Russian during a Residence in England of Ten Months</span> (1816), which purported to be a translation from the original manuscript of &#145;Oloff Napea, ex-officer of cavalry&#146;, was also the production of Badcock. His last work under the signature of Jon Bee was an edition of the works of the playwright Samuel Foote (3 vols., 1830). There are indications here that Badcock was connected with Devon or Cornwall, a supposition supported by the fact that in the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> (1819, pt. i, 618&#150;20, pt. ii, 326), Badcock had announced his intention of printing the lives of the celebrated natives of Devon. His later writings, as John Hinds, all concern horses and riding; they include <span class="italic">The Veterinary Surgeon</span>, issued in 1827 and 1829, and reissued at Philadelphia in 1848, and the preparation of new editions of W. Osmer's <span class="italic">Treatise on the Horse</span> and C. Thompson's <span class="italic">Rules for Bad Horsemen</span>, both of which appeared in 1830. This was the last year in which any work that can be attributed to Badcock was published.<br>
