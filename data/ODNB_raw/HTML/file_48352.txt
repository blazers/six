<span class="headword">Tyrer,  Henry</span>  (1858&#150;1936), <span class="occ">shipping agent</span>, was born at Green Lane Farm, Ormskirk, Lancashire, on 2 March 1858, the third son among thirteen children of John Tyrer (<i>d</i>. 1894), a farmer, and his wife, Jane (<i>d</i>. 1889), <i>n&eacute;e</i> Travis. Tyrer was educated at the free grammar school in Ormskirk and left school in 1872. Deciding against agriculture as a career, he obtained a position with Alfred Murdoch &amp; Co. in Liverpool. The firm had been active in the west African trade since 1847, and its trading in palm oil had led to the purchase of a cooperage. Tyrer learned all aspects of the business, and in 1879 he became a partner, only to leave soon after to set up his own business.<br>
<br>Henry Tyrer &amp; Co. had an initial capital of only &pound;100, but Tyrer's activities as a commission agent in the west African trade required little more as cash was usually received with each order. By taking personal care of each transaction Tyrer soon acquired a good reputation. He restored relations with Murdoch, and eventually took over his business. Tyrer then took a partner to fund further expansion, but this link ended in 1885.<br>
<br>Tyrer was now a general merchant, trading in goods on his own account, as well as being a commission agent. His success enabled him to marry Jane Elizabeth (1855&#150;1936), daughter of John Porter, an estate manager, on 17 June 1885 at Rufford church near Ormskirk. Sadly both their children died at an early age. Then in 1890 Tyrer found himself in financial difficulties, and only narrowly escaped bankruptcy.<br>
<br>During the 1890s Tyrer made various attempts to take a more direct part in the west African shipping trade. He successively encouraged the Prince Line, the General Steam Navigation Company, and Furness Withy &amp; Co. Ltd to provide services to west Africa for which he would act as agent. Alfred Jones dominated the west African trade, and defeated Tyrer's efforts, as he did again in 1903&#150;4 when Tyrer organized voyages to west Africa by a ship of his own.<br>
<br>To compensate for these rebuffs, Tyrer diversified his business into other activities. These included agencies for short sea routes from Liverpool and the development of a small coastal trade with western Scotland. Tyrer also took advantage of the opening of the port of Preston in 1892. He was soon the leading shipping agent there, dealing with grain from Ireland, general cargo from London, and, most important of all, the woodpulp trade from Scandinavia. His own service from Preston to Brussels via London was short-lived, but was sold at a profit.<br>
<br>Tyrer converted his business into a limited liability company in 1914. He became governing director and six of his most long-standing employees were appointed directors. The First World War disrupted some of Tyrer's activities, but it also gave him yet another chance to take a bigger part in the west African trade. In 1916 Sir William Lever set up the Bromport Steamship Company in defiance of the west African shipping conference, and Tyrer became the agent for Bromport.<br>
<br>The coming of peace dealt several blows to Tyrer's business. He lost the agency for the woodpulp trade, and in 1924 the Bromport Steamship Company was wound up. However, Tyrer retained the agency for Lever's Southern Whaling and Sealing Company. In the late 1920s Tyrer was again active in the west African trade, acting for the African and Eastern Trade Corporation, and then the United African Company.<br>
<br>By 1930 Henry Tyrer was in his seventies, and playing a much smaller role in the running of his company. His health gradually failed and he died on 20 June 1936 at his home, Bewcastle, Latham, near Ormskirk, Lancashire. He was buried at Rufford church. Tyrer's wife survived him, but died two months later, on 25 August 1936.<br>
