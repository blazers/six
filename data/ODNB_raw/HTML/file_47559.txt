<span class="headword">Guthrie, Sir  Giles Connop McEachern</span>, second baronet  (1916&#150;1979), <span class="occ">airline administrator</span>, was born in Westminster, London, on 21 March 1916, the son of Sir Connop Thirlwall Robert Guthrie, first baronet (1882&#150;1945), a lieutenant in the Grenadier Guards, and his wife, Elia, <i>n&eacute;e</i> McEacharn. Educated at Eton College and at Cambridge, he began flying at university. In 1936, at the age of twenty, he partnered C. W. A. Scott in the Portsmouth to Johannesburg air race, theirs being the only team to complete the competition. After university Guthrie obtained his commercial pilot's licence and joined British Airways, a newly formed airline in competition with Imperial Airways. In 1939 he married Rhona, daughter of Frederic Stileman; they had three sons. He held the post of traffic officer with British Airways until the outbreak of war, when he joined the Fleet Air Arm as a fighter pilot. He was awarded the DSC in 1941 while serving on the aircraft-carrier HMS <i>Ark Royal</i>, and by 1943 had been promoted to the rank of lieutenant-commander.<br>
<br>With his father's death at the end of the war, Guthrie succeeded to the baronetcy. He remained in the Fleet Air Arm as a test pilot until 1946 and was appointed OBE. Returning to civilian life, he entered banking and became managing director of the merchant bank Brown, Shipley &amp; Co., as well as holding positions on the boards of the Prudential Assurance Company and Radio Rentals. In 1959 he returned to civil aviation when he was appointed to the board of the state-owned British European Airways (BEA). He retained his membership of BEA for the next ten years, but at the beginning of 1964 he took on a more demanding assignment when he became chairman and chief executive of the British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC). At the time, BOAC was losing money and had an accumulated deficit of &pound;80 million. His predecessors, the chairman Sir Matthew Slattery and the managing director Sir Basil Smallpiece, had requested government permission to write off the debt which had been incurred as part of the cost of introducing British aircraft to BOAC's fleet. However, the minister of aviation, Julian Amery, had preferred to await the findings of the confidential Corbett Report on BOAC's performance.<br>
<br>When Guthrie took up his position, he obtained not only the debt write-off which Slattery and Smallpiece had sought, but also a written undertaking from Amery that the airline would in future be run as a commercial enterprise, with any deviation from this policy&#151;on grounds of national interest&#151;requiring a specific directive from the minister. Under his chairmanship, BOAC was swiftly returned to profitability. It was an achievement aided by a general upturn in the airline industry after 1964, but performance was also raised by reducing the number of staff and closing unprofitable routes. At the heart of his plan to restore the corporation's finances was a deal negotiated with the government to reduce substantially the number of Super VC10 aircraft which had been ordered from Vickers some six years earlier.<br>
<br>A man of great personal charm, Guthrie brought a shrewd business mind and steady leadership to BOAC. He is chiefly remembered for restoring the profit motive to the management of the national-flag carrier at a time when it seemed to have lost its sense of purpose. To a certain extent his achievement was overshadowed by the implementation of the Edwards committee recommendations after 1969, and the subsequent merger of BOAC and BEA as the modern British Airways.<br>
<br>Guthrie retired as chairman of BOAC at the end of 1968. During the next two years he spent some time creating an airline self-insurance company, Air Transport Insurance, of which he was chairman. Otherwise he lived quietly in Jersey for the remainder of his life. He died of a malignant brain tumour on 31 December 1979. His eldest son, Malcolm Connop (<i>b</i>. 1942), succeeded to his title.<br>
