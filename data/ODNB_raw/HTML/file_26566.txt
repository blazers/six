<span class="headword">Stone,  Benjamin</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1605&#150;1643), <span class="occ">sword maker</span>, the son of John Stone of Arundel, Sussex, yeoman, was apprenticed to William Bell, cutler, for nine years from 2 February 1605. Sworn a freeman of the Cutlers' Company on 2 December 1613, he engaged his first apprentice the following year. Repeated offences against the rules of the company, recorded in its court minute book, suggest that he was an awkward character. From about 1628 Stone was supplying the ordnance office with swords fitted with imported blades. However, in 1630 he negotiated the lease from Lord Berkeley of a water-powered sword mill for the grinding and polishing of blades, recently constructed at East Bedfont, Middlesex, near Baber Bridge for the benefit of immigrant German bladesmiths who had come to England the previous year. Operations commenced in 1632 and the Germans were apparently later joined by English workmen. The mill is shown on Moses Glover's map of 1635, with an adjacent house marked &#145;Mr. Stone's&#146;. From then on he became the chief entrepreneur of the Hounslow sword-blade industry, and until 1642 supplied new swords and refurbished old ones for the ordnance stores on a lavish scale, at times fulfilling his contract by subcontracting to other cutlers.<br>
<br>In July 1636 Stone was granted a patent (no. 97) for the making of blades &#145;by the help of mills&#146;, but the exact details are not explained. Later in the same year he was enrolled as a member of the ordnance office in the capacity of his majesty's artificer for the manufacture of sword blades. His arrogance and persistent denigration of the work of his rivals among the London cutlers made him enemies, and in petitions addressed to the king, the privy council, and the council of war soliciting the purchase of the swords he was in a position to supply in large quantities, he asked in addition for protection from molestation, including arrest for debt, and from the hostile influence of Captain William Legge, master of the armoury. His ambition was to secure a monopoly of supplying swords to the ordnance office, in which he was opposed by other cutlers and Legge, although he had some support from Sir John Heydon, lieutenant of the ordnance. A petition from the London Cutlers to the privy council, undated but apparently <i>c</i>.1637, made violent allegations against Stone, attempting to deny the validity of his patent, but later he was able confidently to offer to supply the ordnance stores with 1000 swords a month. On 19 January 1641 a committee was appointed at the Cutlers' court to prosecute Stone for abuses and misdemeanours, but the upshot is not recorded. Nothing is known of Stone's marriage but his son, also Benjamin, took his freedom in the Cutlers' Company on 10 October 1637.<br>
<br>The serviceable quality of the blades produced at Hounslow is borne out by the well-used condition of surviving examples, some of which were reused in the following century. William Cavendish, duke of Newcastle, in an unpublished manuscript, &#145;The truth of the sword&#146;  (BL, Harl. MS 4206), pays tribute to them. In 1643 the parliamentary commanders Waller and Haslerig, reporting their campaigning, asked to be supplied with two hundred swords &#145;of Kennet's making at Hounslow&#146;. This would have been Johannes Kinndt, one of the German bladesmiths. At the time, Hounslow blades evidently not being available, appeal was made for contributions by private owners. Stone continued in business at Hounslow until the outbreak of the civil war, but it would appear that with the passing of the area after 1642 into parliamentary hands, he and some at least of the workmen fled to Oxford, where a sword mill was set up at Wolvercote, and he may have been involved in its management. In the journal of receipts of the royal ordnance stores there is an entry, dated 19 May 1643, &#145;Received from Mr. Stone, blademaker, swords made clean and scabbarded 9&#146;. The date of Stone's death is not known.<br>
<br>Stone's mill was converted to the production of gunpowder, but during the interregnum the industry was carried on in the area by other hands. After the Restoration, in 1673, an attempt to revive it was made by two survivors of the original German bladesmiths and the Cutlers' Company, but seemingly without effect, and it was not until about 1685 that a new start was made at Shotley Bridge, co. Durham.<br>
