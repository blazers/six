<span class="headword">Vernon,  Robert</span>  (1774/5&#150;1849), <span class="occ">art collector and patron</span>, was the son of William Vernon (<i>d</i>. 1801) and his wife, Mary. His father was a hackneyman in Mount Street, Berkeley Square, London, from 1793 until his death in December 1801, when his estate was valued at &pound;3350; Vernon took over and greatly expanded the business. By 1812 he had a collection of English historical portraits and old masters, some of which he sold at a loss in 1831. By 1826 he was collecting modern British pictures, and in 1832 he leased 50 Pall Mall, which from 1843 he opened to the public. The adjacent property housed the <span class="italic">Art Union</span>, founded in 1839 and edited by S. C. Hall, who puffed Vernon's pictures, the right to reproduce which was granted to the journal by Vernon. Indeed, reproductions of Vernon's paintings became a mainstay of that journal.<br>
<br>On 22 December 1847 a selection of Vernon's collection&#151;157 pictures (all British except one), eight sculptures, and one watercolour&#151;made by the National Gallery was vested in its trustees. One picture depicted the home of Sir John Fleming Leicester, who had anticipated Vernon's idea of a public collection of modern British art, as too had Sir Francis Chantrey. Vernon, however, was the first to realize it. About 1830, together with Chantrey and J. M. W. Turner, Vernon had planned bequests to galleries and of money (&pound;70,000 in Vernon's case) for the benefit of artists. However, he finally made a family friend, Leicester Viney Smith (1798&#150;1860), his heir. Vernon died unmarried at 50 Pall Mall on 22 May 1849 and was buried at Ardington parish church, Berkshire, where he is commemorated by a bust by William Behnes (he had purchased Ardington House in 1839). Smith took the name Vernon in 1850 and inherited the money intended to assist struggling painters.<br>
<br>George Jones, who had advised Vernon on his purchases, deprecated this change and also the gift of the collection before a room was built for it at the National Gallery. There it was squeezed into the lower floor in 1848, before being moved to Marlborough House in 1850, to South Kensington in 1859, and back to the National Gallery in 1876. Following the <span class="roman">National Gallery Act</span> of 1883 the collection was no longer shown together in its own rooms as Vernon had wished (he had declined the suggestion of John Sheepshanks that their gifts be merged). His nephew Vernon Heath (1820&#150;1895), who had been his secretary from 1841, wrote in 1894 that, had Vernon foreseen its fate, he would never have made his gift. Most of it is now in the Tate collection; six works belong to the National Portrait Gallery and nine have perished. &#145;A strange, singular man&#146;  (Heath, <span class="italic">Recollections</span>, 1), latterly wracked by gout, Vernon was not a popular figure. His gift, received ecstatically in 1847, was soon and has remained unappreciated, despite including such significant examples of nineteenth-century British art as Turner's <span class="italic">The Dogano, San Giorgio, Citella, from the Steps of the Europa</span> (1842; Tate collection), the first work from his collection to hang in the National Gallery, and Edwin Landseer's virtuoso performance <span class="italic">King Charles Spaniels</span> (1845; Tate collection).<br>
