<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Himsworth, Sir  Harold Percival</span>  (1905&#150;1993), <span class="occ">physician</span>, was born on 19 May 1905 in Huddersfield, the son of (Joseph) Arnold Himsworth (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1959), a businessman, and his wife, Amy Eliza, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Barraclough (<i>c</i>.1880&#150;1962). Harry, as he was always called, had a struggle to get a good education, but from Huddersfield board school he won a scholarship to King James's Grammar School, Almondbury, in 1916. From there his parents removed him, at the age of sixteen and a half, to work in a worsted mill. A year later they reluctantly agreed to allow him to continue his education. As an external student he matriculated at the University of London and obtained a first MB with distinction. In January 1924 he entered the medical sciences faculty of University College, London. After moving on to University College Hospital medical school he qualified, gaining the university medal, and in 1930 obtained his MD, again with a gold medal. On 3 August 1932 he married Charlotte (1907&#150;1988), daughter of William Gray of Walmer, Kent. Theirs was a very happy marriage. There were two sons, John Ross (<i>b</i>. 1934) and Richard Lawrence (<i>b</i>. 1937). Himsworth joined the medical unit at University College Hospital in 1930, became its deputy director in 1936, and director and professor of medicine in 1939. He became a member of the Medical Research Council (MRC) in 1948 and its secretary in 1949. He became deputy chairman in 1967 and retired in 1968. He was appointed KCB in 1952 and elected FRS in 1955. From 1969 to 1976 he was chairman of the board of management of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. In 1974&#150;6 he was prime warden of the Goldsmiths' Company.<br>
<br>During his career Himsworth made major contributions in two fields. The first was research in clinical medicine, leading to sixty-one publications, in particular in relation to diabetes and liver disease. This work was done in the 1930s and 1940s at a time when there was a great deal of enthusiasm for such research, when the application of physiology and chemistry to clinical medicine was developing fast, when there was not an emotional distrust of science, and when professors were not plagued by a constant search for funding. He worked in an institution with a particularly strong background for such research. In his work on diabetes he gave one of the earliest and clearest descriptions of two types of diabetes and he developed a test to distinguish between them, one type being due to lack of insulin and controllable by the administration of insulin, the other not associated with lack of insulin and not responsive to its administration. The other major field in which he worked was that of experimental liver damage, whether due to malnutrition, to poisons such as trinitrotoluene or carbon tetrachloride, or to viral infections. The pattern of damage was not specific to particular causes: the severity of damage was related to the magnitude of the insult and whether it was repeated. Himsworth's work was important in understanding human disease, for example the massive necrosis of acute yellow atrophy or the diffuse fibrosis of cirrhosis of the liver sometimes seen as a sequel to the fatty infiltration of kwashiorkor.<br>
<br>Himsworth's second major contribution was as secretary of the MRC. He held this post at a time when there was a great demand for money for medical research and the government was willing to provide it without any interference with the scientific policies of the council. For most of his time as secretary he reported to the lord president of the council, a minister of high standing without departmental responsibilities. Himsworth was a man with a strong personality, very able, very energetic, always bubbling with enthusiasm, and an immensely hard worker. He was able to grasp the importance of all kinds of research from fundamental areas such as molecular biology to the interface between medicine and the social sciences, and had a fair understanding of every field. He thus had a remarkable grasp of the work of the MRC and came to dominate the council as well as being respected and trusted in Whitehall, where he gained a reputation for using public money effectively and insisting on high standards of work. It is worth noting that twelve of those who were on the staff of the MRC during his period of office managed to win thirteen Nobel prizes at some stage in their careers. This was the result of his belief that the most important role of an organization such as the MRC was to choose the right people as leaders of research teams. He did use his influence to encourage certain areas of research. The National Health Service (NHS) had been established shortly before he was appointed as secretary. Shortly after that it was agreed with the Ministry of Health that the major part of the funding of clinical research should be by a clinical research board run by the MRC and consisting of nominees of both the MRC and the ministry. He was convinced of the need for clinical research units where clinicians could work in collaboration with laboratory scientists in a way not easy in conventional university departments, and the number of such units rose rapidly.<br>
<br>Somewhat similar changes took place in regard to tropical medicine. When Himsworth became secretary he also became chairman of the colonial medical research committee. Before the end of the 1950s the arrangements were changed and the MRC took over the responsibility, establishing a tropical medicine research board with Himsworth as chairman and half the members nominated by the Colonial Office and its successors. He was very interested in this field, and during his time as secretary all the main centres of the MRC's research in the tropics were established. He visited them in the Gambia, in Uganda, and in the West Indies regularly. He made a special contribution to radiation medicine by chairing the MRC committee (1956), which, at the request of government, established levels at which individuals did not need to feel undue concern about developing any of the delayed effects. He made a major contribution to the development of the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology at Cambridge.<br>
<br>After retirement Himsworth had more time for fishing and walking, but was often called on for advice. He was invited to inquire into the use of CS gas in Northern Ireland, and with colleagues he recruited he came to the conclusion that while it was a potent respiratory irritant it was not a systemic poison. He also wrote several books about research with a philosophical bias. The death of his wife in 1988 was a great blow to him. He died in London of a stroke on 1 November 1993, and was cremated. He was survived by his two sons and several grandchildren.<br>
