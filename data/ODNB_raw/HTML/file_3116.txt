<span class="headword">Boyd,  Walter</span>  (1753&#150;1837), <span class="occ">financier</span>, was born on 18 November 1753 in Scotland. He had at least one brother. He was possibly educated in Amsterdam, and he seems to have served an apprenticeship with a merchant house there or in France. From 1774 to 1781 he managed farms in Lincolnshire, leaving without any definite prospects.<br>
<br>Boyd's subsequent career developed from a connection with Sir Robert Herries and his brothers, Charles and William. The Herries were merchants in London and Barcelona, and also had a major stake in the London Exchange Banking Company which supplied facilities to travellers in Europe to cash cheques. It is not clear how Boyd was introduced to the Herries, but he was soon in touch with William when the latter was established by his brother Robert as a merchant and banker in Ostend in 1780. As a result of his connections with William Herries, Boyd became associated with Veuve Nettine et Fils of Brussels, bankers to the Austrian administration. In 1782, Herries and &Eacute;douard Walckiers, a partner of Veuve Nettine et Fils who married Dieudonn&eacute;e Nettine, established the Banque Particuli&egrave;re dans les Pays-Bas Autrichiennes, and appointed Boyd and his fellow Scot, John William Ker, as <i>secr&eacute;taires de direction</i> (personal secretaries to the directors).<br>
<br>In 1785 the two ambitious Scots entered a six-year partnership as Boyd, Ker et Cie and opened a bank in Paris. Boyd built up an extensive network of correspondents in France, the Netherlands, and London, drawing in particular on Veuve Nettine et Fils in Brussels, Herries in London, and Hope &amp; Co. in Amsterdam. His main business was foreign exchanges and dealing in securities, but his interests were wide: he probably acted as the agent of Robert Herries in supplying American tobacco to the farmers general; he was banker to Thomas Jefferson; he acted for English visitors to Paris; he made loans to the aristocracy; and he was involved in factional fights for control of the Compagnie des Indes. It was around this time that he married Harriet Anne Hooke Goddard, daughter of Thomas Goddard of London; they had three sons and four daughters. She died on 10 January 1833; one son, Robert, and all the daughters, survived their father. According to Lady Elizabeth Spencer-Stanhope, Boyd stood<blockquote>in a pre-eminent position, admitted, as an Englishman, to those highest circles which were closed to the monied men of France, and aspiring to that commanding influence in the commercial world which although often maintained in England is seldom countenanced in France. (HoP, <span class="italic">Commons</span>)</blockquote>In 1791 the partnership was renewed for a further six years with the addition of three &#145;commandite&#146; partners, who provided additional capital without sharing in risks. One was Boyd's young cousin Walter; more important were &Eacute;douard Walckiers and Fran&ccedil;ois Laborde-M&eacute;r&eacute;ville. Although Walckiers was an adviser to the emperor Joseph II and a director of the royal treasury, he had taken a leading part in the insurrection of 1789 and fled to Paris: he supplied 1.5 million livres of capital. Fran&ccedil;ois Laborde-M&eacute;r&eacute;ville was the son of a wealthy Bayonne banker who married Rosalie de Nettine, the sister of Dieudonn&eacute;e. In 1789 Laborde-M&eacute;r&eacute;ville opposed Jacques Necker's scheme for financial reform before the national assembly, and instead proposed&#151;probably with Boyd's support&#151;to set up a private bank which would pay off state debts and reform the collection of taxes, in return for the right of note issue. Although the scheme came to nothing, Boyd was confident that his new partners would bring both capital and connections.<br>
<br>At first political turmoil gave opportunities for speculation on the exchanges. He formed a group, with Hope &amp; Co., and Harman, Hoare &amp; Co. in London, to play the market; he joined with Charles Herries in selling gold and silver bullion to anxious French investors. But by 1792 Boyd was sufficiently concerned by the political situation to establish a base in London. He left Paris in September 1792 and was followed by Ker and Laborde-M&eacute;r&eacute;ville in 1793. The Paris bank remained in the charge of the younger Walter Boyd, who was arrested on suspicion of being an enemy agent. Although he was released, the situation was precarious: the National Convention was demanding that large bills be drawn on London, Amsterdam, and Hamburg to pay for corn imports. In August 1793 the younger Boyd and Walckiers made an agreement to protect the firm by handing it to Antoine Geneste, the firm's cashier, who would run it without risk; Boyd and Walckiers were limited partners with the right to reclaim the business. Boyd and Walckiers soon fled the country, but Geneste was executed in 1794 and the assets of the bank were seized.<br>
<br>Boyd had meanwhile re-established his business in London, in association with the nabob Paul Benfield (<i>d</i>. 1810). Benfield had gone to India as an architect in the East India Company army in 1764, subsequently resigning his commission to become contractor for the ramparts at Madras, as well as lending large sums to the nawab of the Carnatic to finance his war with the raja of Tanjore. When the governor of Madras reinstated the raja, the nawab refused to repay Benfield; Benfield plotted to kidnap the governor, and was ordered home by the East India Company. He purchased an estate, and was elected to parliament in 1780; but in 1781 he returned to India before being ordered home in 1788 by Cornwallis. Benfield was one of the most notorious nabobs, and even a friend called him &#145;exacting, dissatisfied and ambitious&#146;  (Cope, 39). The important point for Boyd was that Benfield was rich. The new firm of Boyd, Benfield &amp; Co. was formed in 1793, and Benfield subscribed &pound;25,000; he also supplied the funds for Boyd's own share of &pound;60,000 by purchasing French annuities from Boyd, Ker et Cie, which were then placed in the new firm. The firm was, therefore, a combination of Benfield's Indian wealth with Boyd's financial skill.<br>
<br>Boyd soon started to play the exchanges, and in May 1794, on the advice of Veuve Nettine et Fils, he contracted for a loan of &pound;3 million to Austria to finance the war in the Austrian Netherlands. He faced opposition both from the Austrian envoy in London, who preferred to deal with a leading bank, and from the contractors of the British loan who had secured an agreement from Pitt that there should be no competition for funds. Boyd urged Pitt to condone the loan. Why, he asked, should London &#145;forego the advantages of being as it were the Banker of Europe?&#146; Remittances would, he argued, be paid &#145;in such a manner as that <i>produce</i> and <i>manufactures</i> may make the principal part of it&#146;  (Cope, 48&#150;9). Pitt permitted the loan to proceed, but Boyd faced severe difficulties when the advance of the French removed the collateral for the loan provided by the revenues of the Austrian Netherlands. The Austrians pressed Boyd to meet his commitments, and one possible solution was for the British government to guarantee the loan to its ally. Boyd's own preference was to make the Austrian loan convertible into consols. The issue became a major element in diplomatic negotiations between the two countries, and was further complicated by the Austrians' need for another loan of &pound;3 million at a time when a large British loan was planned. The outcome was a consortium headed by Boyd, Benfield &amp; Co., which included the Goldsmids, Thellussons, and other leading houses, to contract for a loan of &pound;18 million to Britain and &pound;6 million to Austria. Boyd had, through his contacts with the Austrian Netherlands, become the leader of the syndicate contracting for British government loans. It was, remarked <span class="italic">The Times</span> &#145;the greatest money negotiation that ever took place in this or in any other country at one time&#146;  (13 Dec 1794).<br>
<br>The generous terms secured by Boyd were attacked in both Austria and London, where concern was expressed by the Bank of England, the City, and the Commons. He obtained a further loan contract in 1796, without competition and on favourable terms which led to a committee of enquiry; and he entered into an agreement to make advances to the Treasury through a somewhat devious procedure involving bills of exchange drawn on Hamburg, which led to questions in the Commons. Nevertheless, the syndicate obtained the contract for a further loan for &pound;7.5 million in 1796, again without competition. &#145;There is&#146;, said the <span class="italic">Morning Chronicle</span>, &#145;but one booth in the fair&#146;  (HoP, <span class="italic">Commons</span>).<br>
<br>Doubtless as a means of self-defence, in 1796 Boyd joined Benfield as the second member of parliament for Shaftesbury. But more serious problems were appearing. Boyd, Benfield was holding large amounts of loan, and could not sell it without a fall in prices and a loss of their premium. In April 1796 Boyd invited leading bankers to a meeting to establish a rival credit institution to the Bank of England in order to force the bank to advance money to the government and introduce a more generous discount policy. This was a sign of mounting desperation. In the late 1790s the situation was bleak, as members of the Boyd network experienced difficulties. Walckiers failed in 1796, owing the firm &pound;66,000, and Charles Herries in London in 1798, owing the firm &pound;188,000; the advances to Veuve Nettine could not be realized. Boyd revealed the position to Pitt and Dundas, but an advance of &pound;40,000 was not enough to maintain the position. Boyd turned to Benfield for assistance to draw on funds in India, but this was not easily achieved: most of Benfield's assets were bonds of the nawab of the Carnatic which could be sold only at a heavy discount. Tension built up with Benfield, who was aggrieved at the heavy losses on his remittances from India. Pitt, issuing a new loan of &pound;18 million in 1797, bowed to pressure and opted for an open subscription. But in April 1798, a syndicate headed by Boyd, and including Thellusson and Goldsmid, obtained a new loan without competition. The terms were not favourable, and there were soon problems as the price of the stock fell. In October 1798 Boyd was not invited to join his former colleagues in the syndicate and early in 1799 his partnership with Benfield was dissolved. By March 1800 he was bankrupt.<br>
<br>The situation was transformed in 1801 by peace with France: the chance of regaining his lost assets took Boyd to France. When war resumed in 1803, he was interned. He was able to play some small role in international finance, in relation to Spanish payments to France, but these were years of general inactivity and frustration. He survived as a result of the charity of friends: a fund was raised for him, to which Huskisson and Walter Scott subscribed. A legacy of &pound;1000 to his wife contributed to their support. &#145;Her love for her children and her attachment to me&#146;, he wrote to a partner of Hope &amp; Co., &#145;has given her always so to say supernatural strength, which has sustained us all!&#146;  (Cope, 167). She was allowed to return to England in 1811, but Boyd regained his freedom only in 1814.<br>
<br>Boyd at once started a campaign to regain his assets from the French government. The first payment was received by 1816, and by 1821 he was able to repay the debts against Boyd, Benfield &amp; Co. in full. The creditors granted him an allowance of about &pound;50,000, and in 1823 he invested &pound;33,000 in consols and purchased Plaistow Lodge, near Bromley in Kent, the former home of the banker Peter Thellusson, for &pound;17,000. He was returned to parliament, representing Lymington between 1823 and 1830. When he died at Plaistow on 16 September 1837 he left net personalty of &pound;180,000 which was, presumably, the remnants of his French fortune. He was clearly a financier with flair, who was able to exploit a well-developed network of contacts in France, the Netherlands, and London. The loss of his French assets had gravely weakened his position, but through his ability to tap the funds of Benfield and also to utilize his ties with the Austrian Netherlands, Boyd was able to secure a position in the market for British government loans which was remarkable and unsustainable. Perhaps there are two people who deserve more sympathy: the unfortunate Geneste, who was guillotined, and Benfield, whose considerable landed estate was sold in 1801 to meet the demands of his creditors, and who died in poverty in Paris in 1810.<br>
