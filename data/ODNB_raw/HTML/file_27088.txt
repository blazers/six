<span class="headword">Taylor,  Thomas Edward</span>  (1811&#150;1883), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born at Ardgillan Castle, Dublin, on 25 March 1811, eldest son of the Revd Henry Edward Taylor (1768&#150;1852), fifth son of Thomas Taylor, first earl of Bective and first marquess of Headfort, and his wife, Marianne (<i>d</i>. 1859), daughter of the Hon. Richard St Leger. He was educated at Eton College and commissioned in 1829 in the 6th dragoon guards, from which he retired as captain in 1846. From 1847 to 1874 he was lieutenant-colonel of the Royal Meath militia and subsequently honorary colonel. On 11 November 1862 he married Louisa (<i>d</i>. 1928), second daughter of Hugh Francis Tollemache, rector of Harrington, and granddaughter of Louisa Tollemache, countess of Dysart. They had three sons and two daughters.<br>
<br>In 1841 Taylor was elected as a Conservative MP for Dublin county and represented it until his death. From 1853 he was an assistant whip for the protectionist tories under Sir William Jolliffe, whom he succeeded as chief whip in 1860. He was a lord of the Treasury in the second Derby ministry in 1858&#150;9 and became parliamentary secretary of the Treasury in the Conservative ministry formed in July 1866. In November 1868 he became briefly chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster. In 1873 he was recalled as whip, during the illness of the chief whip, Gerard Noel. He resumed the post of chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster in the second Disraeli ministry. In the by-election caused by his appointment he was opposed by Charles Stewart Parnell, but his vote was nearly twice Parnell's. He was bitter when he failed to get a peerage in 1880.<br>
<br>Taylor was given credit for the defeat of the Palmerston government on Thomas Milner Gibson's vote of censure in February 1858, and, by Disraeli himself, for his work during the <span class="roman">Reform Bill</span> debates of 1867. He promoted party organization in the constituencies, and his responsibility for the party's central fund led to his citation in election petitions. In the 1850s he held that a revival of tory fortunes depended on the adoption of distinctive policies. He warned, when Derby was trying to form a cabinet in February 1855, that the adhesion of Gladstone would offend many protestant tories. He encouraged Disraeli's protestant strategy in the 1868 election. He helped the tory revival in Ireland in the 1850s, and in 1871 recommended home rule as a means of raising Irish support. In 1874 he expected tory gains, but thought they would be greater with the fifteenth earl of Derby as leader. Taylor died on 3 February 1883 at his sister's house at 15 Fitzwilliam Place, Dublin, and was buried in the family vault at Balbriggan, co. Dublin.<br>
