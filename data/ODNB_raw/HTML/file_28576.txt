<span class="headword">Wallis,  Ralph</span> <span class="st"> [<em>called </em> the Cobbler of Gloucester]</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1669), <span class="occ">pamphleteer</span>, was born in a country village, probably in Gloucestershire. Wallis describes himself as &#145;of mean descent for parentage&#146;  (Wallis, <span class="italic">More News from Rome</span>, foreword). The date of his birth is unknown, but by the mid-1660s he considered himself old, and in the 1620s he was memorizing anti-popish verse. His own upbringing, in a poor family, was by no means a fiercely protestant one. His parents were Roman Catholics but &#145;church papists&#146;, who conformed enough to the demands of the Church of England to escape persecution. His father died when Wallis was nine, leaving to his son a collection of missals, beads, and crucifixes. He moved later to Gloucester to pursue the trade of cobbler, which, he explained, meant repairing boots and shoes, not making them.<br>
<br>Like many with radical protestant leanings, Wallis found that the civil wars provided him with opportunities. By October 1643, he was involved in sequestering the rents of Gloucestershire royalists on behalf of the parliamentarian garrison at Gloucester. On one of these forays, at Pamington, near Cheltenham, he was betrayed into the hands of scouts from the royalist garrison of Sudeley Castle, and was imprisoned at Sudeley and later in Oxford. His wife, Dorothy, petitioned Governor Edward Massie for relief, on behalf of her family of three children, and she was awarded 18<i>s</i>. Her expressed hope that Wallis would benefit in an exchange of prisoners may have been fulfilled. According to a hostile anonymous biographer, he subsequently served as an agent to sequestrators of royalists' property. On 8 June 1648 he was appointed by the Gloucester corporation to be schoolmaster at Holy Trinity Church. The corporation was dominated by puritans of the stamp of Thomas Pury, the city's MP, and Wallis performed other duties for his masters, including acting as a messenger to London. He was regarded highly enough to be singled out for remuneration in August 1651, and on 24 September 1658 he was elected burgess and freeman in recognition of his services. He was sworn the following day, in what was the apotheosis of his public career. He is said to have begun writing pamphlets against the governments of the 1650s, but no trace of them has survived, and it seems a little unlikely in one who had benefited from republican regimes. On the other hand, the work <span class="italic">Harry Hangman's Honour</span> (1655), which is part apology for the Gloucestershire tobacco planters, part wry commentary on public life, foreshadows much of Wallis's later style as a writer, and probably marks his authorial d&eacute;but.<br>
<br>Wallis never held civic office in Gloucester, and it may be assumed that he had lost his teaching post before the arrival in the city of the commissioners for regulating corporations soon after the Restoration. He reverted to his trade, and was drawn to preaching as a possible calling. In the climate of extreme hostility to protestant dissenters he was nothing daunted, and began to travel, presumably as an itinerant preacher. It was alleged that he was a frequent visitor to Kidderminster, where Richard Baxter had nurtured a godly civic culture during the 1650s. About this time he married his wife, Elizabeth, who was much younger than him; he also considered taking up offers of remuneration as a minister. A potential alternative source of income was alehouse-keeping, of which he evidently had some experience. Elizabeth declared: &#145;I might have been more happy in the world than to have had you, yet upon condition you will neither sell ale nor preach, I will be contented with my position&#146;  (Wallis, <span class="italic">Rome for Good News</span>, sig. A2i). Wallis was assisted financially by James Forbes, in the 1650s an Independent minister in Gloucester but by the mid-1660s a shoemaker at Clapham. Both men had come to the attention of the authorities in Gloucester and London by January 1664, but it was not until September that they were arrested by the government censor Roger L'Estrange; they were examined by him on 1 October. In late November the government evidently thought to grant Wallis bail in order to allow him to publish his work, to uncover the centre of a ring of subversives, but no such network was unveiled. In his petition to Henry Bennet, Wallis begged not to be crushed like a worm, described his own work as &#145;drollery&#146;, and assured Bennet he only attacked the clergy &#145;to teach them better manners, and will scribble as much against fanatics when the worm gets into his cracked pate&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1663&#150;4</i>, 156&#150;7).<br>
<br>Thereafter Wallis suffered persecution at the hands of civic authorities in Bristol and Gloucester, and appeared before Thomas Windsor, Lord Windsor, probably in Worcestershire, in the manner endured by Quakers. It did not prevent him publishing, however, and at least three titles of his appeared between 1665 and 1668: some may have been second editions of works published earlier. At the heart of <span class="italic">Rome for Good News</span> (1665) is the verse in ballad stanzas that he memorized forty years before: a dialogue between a Catholic priest and a supposed protestant, where the priest shows the protestant that he remains in thrall to popery. His real target is the Church of England, an &#145;old whore&#146;  (<span class="italic">Rome for Good News</span>, 19). <span class="italic">More News from Rome, or, Magna Charta, Discoursed of between a Poor Man &amp; his Wife</span> (1666), written after his interrogation by L'Estrange, provides a catalogue of the scandalous and shameful conduct of Anglican clergymen, gathered mostly from the south-west midlands. Wallis returned to this theme in <span class="italic">Room for the Cobler of Gloucester and his Wife</span> (1668), described by L'Estrange as &#145;the damnedest thing [that] has come out yet&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1667&#150;8</i>, 357). In this grossly libellous work, Wallis adopted a prurient and scatological tone, providing outrageous if entertaining anecdotes about clergymen whose names and addresses he knew. His depiction of the rites and ceremonies of the Church of England as &#145;the parings of the devil's bum-hole&#146;  (Wallis, <span class="italic">Room for the Cobler</span>, 40) are among his milder observations.<br>
<br>In sharp contrast to the libels and anti-Anglican polemic of these works are the dedicatory epistles to Elizabeth that precede them. Her support for Wallis, and her care for their four young children during his sufferings, were acknowledged in affectionate and touching detail. By 1665 he evidently suffered a serious disability in his right arm, and walked only with crutches, raising the possibility that his venom against the church was fuelled by chronic physical pain. He returned to Gloucester after his wanderings and died there in 1669; he was buried at St Mary de Crypt, the parish where James Forbes had ministered, on 9 February. His hostile biographer provides a description: &#145;His complexion was of a sunburnt gipsy colour, and his skin was rough and tawny, like singed bacon; his hair was brown and bristly upon his head, but his locks were weather-turned, like a barber's show periwig&#146;  (<span class="italic">Life and Death of Ralph Wallis</span>, 20). His precise religious affiliation puzzled contemporaries, but he seems best described as an unaligned nonconformist, whose hatred of Anglicanism provided him with a driving energy. His memory lingered: 1704 saw the publication of <span class="italic">The Cobler of Gloucester Reviv'd; in a Letter to the Observator's Country-Man</span>.<br>
