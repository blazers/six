<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Wilson, Sir  Samuel Herbert</span>  (1873&#150;1950), <span class="occ">colonial governor and civil servant</span>, was born on 31 October 1873 in Dublin, the third son of James Wilson, barrister, and his wife, Elizabeth, daughter of Joseph Holmes, landowner, of co. Sligo. He was educated privately and later at the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, from where he was commissioned into the corps of Royal Engineers.<br>
<br>After regimental tours of duty in Chatham, Aldershot, and Gibraltar, Wilson was sent to South Africa in 1899. He served there first in a front-line engineer unit and, later, in the Railway Pioneer regiment, charged with the repair of wrecked railway bridges. He returned home in 1901 after a severe attack of enteric fever. In 1902 he married (Marie) Ida Gabarino, daughter of F. H. A. T. Gervers, a London diamond merchant; it was a marriage of lasting happiness. They had a son and a daughter. After a period at Chatham, Wilson passed the staff college entrance examination&#151;second out of 200 competitors&#151;and following the college course he served at Aldershot, in the War Office, and then at Sandhurst.<br>
<br>The turning point in Wilson's career came in 1911 when he was appointed assistant secretary to the committee of imperial defence (CID) and secretary to one of its most important standing subcommittees, the overseas defence committee. The Agadir crisis had heightened fears over German ambitions, and defensive preparations received increasing attention. Wilson's duties were those of guiding and co-ordinating the defence organizations of Britain's numerous colonies, and assisting the secretary of the full CID in trying to ensure that these colonial preparations were co-ordinated with those of the Indian empire and the dominions. In this work Wilson was very largely successful, one exception being any readiness for war in the East Africa Protectorate where the governor hoped to arrange a local &#145;no war&#146; agreement with the governor of German East Africa and the territory was totally unprepared for a war against a small but efficient German colonial force. For his work in the years 1911 to 1914, Wilson was appointed CMG.<br>
<br>After the outbreak of war the secretary of the CID, Maurice Hankey, appointed Wilson to be secretary of a special committee tasked to plan and co-ordinate operations against the German colonies so as to prevent their use against the allies. As a soldier, however, Wilson felt he should serve more actively and, when the committee's work was done, Hankey and the prime minister, Herbert Asquith, reluctantly granted his request for release. Wilson served successively as a major and then a lieutenant-colonel on the staff of the First Army, heavily committed in the battles of Neuve Chapelle, Festubert, Aubers, and Loos. In 1916 he was appointed to the staff of the 2nd corps, rising from colonel to brigadier-general and participating in the Somme, Ancre, third Ypres, and Escaut operations. For his services, he was made a CB and mentioned six times in dispatches. He was also made a member of the French L&eacute;gion d'honneur and awarded the Croix de Guerre, together with the Belgian order of the Crown and Croix de Guerre.<br>
<br>After the armistice, Wilson returned to the secretariat of the CID as senior assistant secretary and once again secretary of the overseas defence committee as well as the home ports defence committee and the imperial communications committee. He played a key role in the post-war reorganization of the CID, frequently deputizing for Hankey, who was now additionally serving as cabinet secretary. In practice, and at the request of the prime minister, Lloyd George, he took day-to-day charge of the CID's work. In 1920 Wilson also accompanied the prime minister to the first meeting of the League of Nations in Geneva, acting as secretary to the British empire delegation, which included dominion prime ministers. Hankey described Wilson as his &#145;guide, philosopher and friend&#146;  (<span class="italic">Royal Engineers Journal</span>, 481).<br>
<br>In 1921, on the recommendation of the then colonial secretary, Winston Churchill, Wilson was appointed governor of the colony of Trinidad and Tobago, and at the same time appointed KBE. The colony was at the time enjoying a period of political calm and relative prosperity. Wilson's governorship was marked by preparations for constitutional change to provide for the election, under a limited franchise, of seven members to the legislative council, hitherto entirely nominated, a change that only came into effect after Wilson's departure. A football enthusiast, Wilson offered a &#145;Wilson cup&#146; for a competition which proved hotly contested and did much to improve the standard of Trinidad football in the second half of the 1920s. He was a popular governor and on his departure the local bishop preached a sermon of which the text was &#145;the smile of the Governor&#146;. He was appointed KCMG in 1923.<br>
<br>In 1924, following political and social unrest in Jamaica, Wilson was transferred to Kingston as governor but before he was able to make much impression he was obliged to return to Britain for medical reasons. Back in London in 1925 Wilson was given the post of permanent under-secretary of state in the Colonial Office, and as such returned to be chairman of his former committee, the overseas defence committee. Wilson was selected to head the Colonial Office staff following the government's decision to separate to a new ministry work connected with the self-governing dominions, so enabling the Colonial Office to concentrate on the emerging political and economic needs of the dependent territories. The work of the office was extended by the development of the &#145;subject&#146; side matters affecting the territories as a whole, such as personnel and recruiting of the colonial service, the creation of expert advisory services for particular fields of development, and the fostering of a better relationship, in a concept of trust and partnership, between the office's officials in London and the service officials at work in the colonies. As permanent under-secretary Wilson visited the four British east African territories in the context of the debate about a possible federation, the west African colonies, and in 1933 also Malaya, here again in the context of the possibilities of a federation of the federated and unfederated Malay states and the Straits Settlements. No decision was, however, reached in Wilson's time. He was appointed KCB in 1927 and GCMG in 1929.<br>
<br>Wilson's successful career owed much to his own personality, soldierly but genial, dignified and self-effacing, with, nevertheless, a strong and tenacious power of assertion when needed. He was good-humoured and easy to work with, and was known generally as Sammy by his colleagues. He had a clear vision for his aims in office: these he could outline for subordinates better versed in civil service practices to carry out, he himself having a dislike of excessive paperwork. He was receptive to ideas from younger subordinates, and had a marked dislike of pretence and unnecessary caution. His life's work represented a significant contribution to the unity of purpose with which the British empire later went to war against fascism in September 1939. He was one of only a handful of colonial governors also to serve as permanent under-secretary of the Colonial Office.<br>
<br>In 1933 Wilson retired, stating his belief that from a national point of view a change should be made. In his retirement he interested himself in his several commercial directorships, which included the Standard Bank of South Africa and Consolidated Gold Fields. In his last years he became crippled by ill health and he felt keenly the loss of his only son, killed in action in 1943. He died at Thames Bank Nursing Home, Goring, on 5 August 1950, leaving his widow and one daughter.<br>
