<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Hildyard, Sir  Henry John Thoroton</span>  (1846&#150;1916), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was born on 5 July 1846, the son of Thomas Blackborne Thoroton Hildyard (1821&#150;1888) of Flintham Hall, Newark, the Conservative MP for Nottinghamshire South (1846&#150;52, 1866&#150;85), and his wife, Anne Margaret, second daughter of Colonel Rochfort of Clogrenane, co. Carlow. Henry Hildyard was educated at the Royal Naval Academy, Gosport, and served as a lieutenant RN from 13 September 1859 to 28 November 1864. In 1867 he became an ensign in the 15th foot (9 March) and then the 71st foot (1 May). Promoted captain in October 1876, he graduated from the Staff College at Camberley in 1877 with special credit in German and Spanish, and he frequently contributed translations of German articles to the <span class="italic">Journal</span> of the Royal United Service Institution. He served as brigade major in Cyprus and Gibraltar from 1878 to 1882, achieving his majority on 6 May 1882. His first major campaign was the 1882 expedition to Egypt, where he served as Sir Garnet Wolseley's deputy assistant adjutant and quartermaster-general, and was at Qassasin and Tell al-Kebir. He was mentioned in dispatches and received the Osmanieh (fourth class).<br>
<br>For the next nine years Hildyard, who became a brevet lieutenant-colonel on 18 November 1882, held a series of posts, including deputy assistant adjutant-general and assistant adjutant-general at headquarters, that reflected his growing reputation as a competent administrator and his status as a member of the Wolseley &#145;ring&#146;. On 12 August 1893 he became commandant at the Staff College. According to <span class="italic">The Times</span>, &#145;The College had long been a byword for pedantry, but under his direction it became infused with a fresher and more practical spirit&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 27 July 1916). He aimed to combat the old evil of cramming: &#145;we do not want any cramming here&#146;, he declared, &#145;we want officers to absorb, not to cram&#146;  (Bond, 154). He vainly tried to secure abolition of all written examinations by outside examiners. He restructured the examination system, abolishing the final examination and classifying students by their work during the course, and placed greater emphasis on the practicalities of command and staff work. The timing of his reforms was important, for many of the men who were to lead the British army in the First World War&#151;Haig, Robertson, and Allenby among them&#151;studied at Staff College in Hildyard's day.<br>
<br>Hildyard left Staff College on 25 February 1898 to command 3rd brigade at Aldershot, being promoted major-general on 14 May 1899. At the outbreak of the South African War, on 9 October, he was appointed to command 2nd (or English) brigade in Methuen's 1st division. Hildyard handled his brigade competently in the defeat at Colenso (15 December 1899), and during the attempt to relieve Ladysmith made a successful attack at Rangeworthy Hills (20 January 1900). This was but a prelude to the disaster at nearby Spion Kop on 24 January. This defeat was rapidly followed by another at Vaal Krantz (5&#150;7 February 1900). Again, Hildyard and 2nd brigade performed creditably but were let down by Buller's poor generalship. The capture of Monte Cristo by Hildyard's brigade on 18 February was an important preliminary to the relief of Ladysmith ten days later.<br>
<br>Promoted lieutenant-general on 20 April 1900, Hildyard's reward for his steady if unspectacular leadership was promotion to command 5th division. Under his command it fought a series of actions, the most important being at Alleman's Nek (June 1900), where Hildyard succeeded in moving round the flank of Boer forces strongly entrenched at Laing's Nek, &#145;the Gibraltar of Natal&#146;, thus handing Buller an important victory. Hildyard took on further responsibilities in October, when the Natal field force was formally disbanded; he commanded both in Natal and in part of the Transvaal. He had to hold and pacify the area as the war moved into the guerrilla phase; the Boer offensive of 1901 demonstrated the essential soundness of the arrangements.<br>
<br>In September 1901 Hildyard returned to Britain on leave. Mentioned in dispatches, in 1900 he had been made KCB. In 1903 he was appointed director-general of military education. In 1904 he returned to South Africa as lieutenant-general on the staff commanding troops, and from 1905 to 1908 served as general officer commanding-in-chief, South Africa.<br>
<br>On 20 May 1871 Hildyard had married Annette, daughter of Admiral James Charles Prevost (1810&#150;1891). They had three sons, two of whom entered the army. A 1903 photograph depicts an alert, striking-looking man of soldierly bearing, with the obligatory military moustache; anecdotes suggest an amiable personality. Hildyard retired in 1911, living at 20 Eccleston Square, Pimlico, London, and died on 25 July 1916 at his sister's residence, Apsley Heath House, Woburn Sands, Bedfordshire. His wife survived him. At the time of Hildyard's death the British army on the Somme was undergoing its first major experience of large-scale modern industrialized warfare, led by commanders who had benefited directly or indirectly from his reforms of Staff College. Hildyard deserves a share of the credit for that army's victory in 1918.<br>
