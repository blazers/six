<span class="headword">Illingworth,  Percy Holden</span>  (1869&#150;1915), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born at Ladye Royde Hall, Manningham, Bradford, Yorkshire, on 19 March 1869, the youngest in the family of three sons and two daughters of Henry Illingworth (1829&#150;1895), partner in D. Illingworth &amp; Sons, worsted spinners of Bradford, and his wife, Mary (1838&#150;1908), daughter of Sir Isaac Holden, founder of another well-known firm in the wool business and Liberal MP for various Yorkshire seats between 1865 and 1895. Illingworth's uncle, Alfred Illingworth, was also a Liberal MP representing Yorkshire constituencies between 1868 and 1895. Given this background it was not surprising that Illingworth was a lifelong Liberal; he also retained an active involvement in the Baptist church, of which the Illingworth family were staunch supporters.<br>
<br>Illingworth was educated at the London College of the International Education Society (a school inspired by Richard Cobden's ideals) at Isleworth, and Jesus College, Cambridge (1887&#150;1892). This progression to &eacute;lite university education reflected a wider move by nonconformist businessmen into the centres of British power. Illingworth took only an ordinary degree in law, though, devoting most of his energies to winning blues in rugby and becoming &#145;spare man&#146; for the Cambridge University boat. In later life his sporting interests diversified into golf, horse-riding, and grouse shooting. These activities did not prevent him being called to the bar at the Inner Temple in 1894 and practising on the north-eastern circuit as a special pleader, though the income from the Illingworth and Holden firms meant he never depended on his legal earnings. His finances were probably further improved by his marriage, on 16 January 1907, to Mary Mackenzie Coats (1883&#150;1933), daughter of George Coats (1846&#150;1901), of the Paisley thread manufacturers J. and P. Coats. The couple lived in some style at Westwood Park, Clayton Heights, in Bradford, and 102 Lancaster Gate, in London.<br>
<br>Illingworth briefly volunteered to fight in the South African War with the Yorkshire yeomanry, but dashed home in 1900 to contest the Shipley constituency that surrounded his home town of Bradford. He lost narrowly, but his manifesto showed that he was prepared to relax the anti-statist attitudes of his uncle, Alfred, by endorsing the 8 hour day and old age pensions. Illingworth served on the Bradford school board between 1900 and 1903 and won Shipley unopposed in 1906, when the sitting Liberal Unionist MP decamped to another seat at the last moment. In parliament Illingworth was &#145;not a fluent speaker&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 4 Jan 1915) and made little impression in the chamber; but his deep connections in the Liberal Party and his uncle Alfred's long service to the cause of Irish home rule made him an ideal candidate for the role of parliamentary secretary to the chief secretary for Ireland. His skills in handling relations with MPs ensured his promotion to the whips' office on 28 February 1910. There he swiftly became the first lieutenant of the chief whip, the master of Elibank, and the obvious person to succeed him when &#145;the master&#146; retired on 6 August 1912.<br>
<br>Illingworth inherited a difficult situation. The Liberals depended on Irish Nationalist support for their majority, and this tied them to forcing the <span class="roman">Irish Home Rule Bill</span> through the Commons three times in 1912&#150;14 to overcome the House of Lords' veto. The bill faced ferocious Conservative opposition, misgivings among some Liberals, and at best a mixed public reaction. But Illingworth kept his parliamentary forces together and only the outbreak of war stopped the resulting statute being implemented. The respect Illingworth commanded was key to this success. His image was that of an uncomplicated sportsman: his &#145;frank and cheerful personality&#146; and &#145;unfailing tact and good humour&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 4 Jan 1915) were widely admired and, in contrast to his predecessor, he was felt to be fundamentally honest. The birthday honours list he presented in 1913 was notably restrained compared to Murray's flagrant trafficking of honours in return for party donations. Moreover, he gained Asquith's admiration as &#145;one of the straightest men I have ever known, and one of the most lovable&#146;  (Asquith, <span class="italic">Memories</span>, 2.192) and he seems to have remained on good terms with the other Liberal leaders, including Lloyd George. Well-liked chief whips are something of a rarity and this status helped ensure that Illingworth survived occasional blunders, notably the government's defeat on a snap vote on 11 November 1912. Subsequently the whips' office modernized its operations, making much more use of the telephone to ensure MPs' attendance and of the record-keeping systems developed by the junior whip, Wedgwood Benn. However, Illingworth vetoed the idea that the chief whip's responsibility for party organization outside parliament should be made into a separate post, though this would have helped the Liberals' efficiency.<br>
<br>Illingworth was taken ill with enteric fever in December 1914. His condition suddenly deteriorated through intestinal complications, and he died at his home, 102 Lancaster Gate, on 3 January 1915, two days after being named a privy councillor (his final illness was later widely attributed to his eating an infected oyster). He was buried in the Undercliffe cemetery, Bradford. Asquith was visibly moved when paying tribute to him in the House of Commons a month later. In Illingworth's memory a soldiers' home and club was erected by the Baptist Union at Aldershot, and opened in July 1916. After the First World War Lloyd George often suggested that Illingworth could have prevented the split in the Liberal Party in 1916, though this probably reflected Lloyd George's anxiety to present his coup against Asquith as something that arose from purely contingent factors, rather than the result of his irrepressible ambition. Illingworth left three sons&#151;the middle of whom, Percy Guy Illingworth (1910&#150;1995), unsuccessfully contested his father's old seat of Shipley as a Liberal in 1935.<br>
