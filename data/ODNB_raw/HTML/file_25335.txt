<span class="headword">Shepherd,  Luke</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1548), <span class="occ">protestant propagandist</span>, was born in Colchester, Essex. Personal details other than his birthplace, occupation, and London address are not known. John Bale called him &#145;Lucas Opilio&#146; (a Latinized form of his name), considered him &#145;a most elegant poet, not at all inferior to Skelton&#146;, and declared his works &#145;full of suitable jests and exercises of wit&#146;  (Bale, <span class="italic">Cat.</span>, 2.109). Shepherd's anonymous works were printed in London in 1548, primarily by John Day, and include eight verse satires and one satiric prose tract. All except <span class="italic">Pathose, or, An Inward Passion of the Pope for the Losse of hys Daughter the Masse</span> are listed by Bale in his catalogue. Bale also ascribed a translation of the psalms, now lost, to Shepherd. Thomas Warton referred to these psalms and suggested that &#145;one or two of Shepherd's pieces in prose&#146; were among Bishop Tanner's books at Oxford  (Warton, 3.316). Subsequently, Joseph Ritson stated that Shepherd &#145;versify'd certain psalms&#146; and wrote &#145;many other little things&#146;  (Ritson, 330&#150;31). However, neither of these claims regarding additional texts can be substantiated. Andrew Maunsell listed several of Shepherd's satires anonymously in his bibliography.<br>
<br>Shepherd is identified by a contemporary, Edward Underhill, as his friend &#145;mr. Luke&#146;, a physician of Coleman Street and author of &#145;many proper bokes agaynst the papistes&#146;  (Nichols, 171&#150;2) including the verse dialogue, <span class="italic">John Bon and Mast Person</span> which attacks the real presence and the feast of Corpus Christi. Underhill recounted the story of its printer, John Day, who was summonsed before the lord mayor of London, Sir John Gresham, to disclose the name of the anonymous author of this work which had been reported to him as seditious. Day avoided going to prison for printing this satire only because Underhill happened to be a dinner guest at Gresham's house when Day was sent for. Underhill had a copy of Shepherd's poem with him which he gave to the mayor, informing him it was in circulation and much admired at court. Gresham promptly &#145;reade a little off it, and laughed thereatt, as it was bothe pythye and mery&#146;, and subsequently dismissed Day without charge  (Nichols, 172).<br>
<br>Shepherd was imprisoned in the Fleet for his anti-papist writings, according to both Underhill and John Strype, but their accounts do not provide any proof or particulars. No other contemporary details of Shepherd's life are known. It is possible he was recruited to write anti-Catholic satires by a protestant patron, but there is no evidence of such patronage or any other political connections. There is no indication as to when or where he died, and no will has been found.<br>
<br>Shepherd was one of the main writers of the polemical propaganda printed in London in the first two years of Edward VI's reign. His satires criticize the Roman church's pontiff, clergy, and ideology. <span class="italic">Pathose</span>, <span class="italic">A Pore Helpe</span>, and <span class="italic">The Upcheringe of the Messe</span> all attack the Catholic mass. <span class="italic">Antipus</span>, <span class="italic">The Comparison betwene the Antipus and the Antigraph</span>, and <span class="italic">John Bon and Mast Person</span> are concerned primarily with the doctrine of transubstantiation. <span class="italic">Doctour Doubble Ale</span> derides Catholic doctrines and clergy. <span class="italic">Phylogamus</span> denounces clerical celibacy and those writers who support its practice. <span class="italic">Cauteles Preservatory Concerning the Preservation of the Gods which are Kept in the Pixe</span> is a satiric prose work against the sacrament of the altar.<br>
<br>In addition to dealing with general issues of the Reformation, Shepherd also engaged in personal attacks on specific conservative figures, especially churchmen and writers. Contemporary subjects of Shepherd's satires include Bishop Stephen Gardiner, Henry George, Miles Hogarde, William Layton, Sir John Mason, and Dr Richard Smith.<br>
