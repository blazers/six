<span class="headword">Wilkins,  George</span>  (1785&#150;1865), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, born at Norwich in May 1785, was the third son of William Wilkins (1751/2&#150;1815), an architect, and his wife, Hannah Willett, and the younger brother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29422/', "William Wilkins")</script>. He was educated at Bury St Edmunds grammar school, and in 1803 entered Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, graduating BA in 1807, MA in 1810, and DD in 1824. Ordained in 1808, Wilkins became curate of Great Plumstead, Norfolk, and then of Hadleigh, Suffolk, under Dr Edward Auriol Hay-Drummond (<i>d</i>. 1829), uncle of the earl of Kinnoull. He married Hay-Drummond's daughter Amelia Auriol on 3 September 1811, having first run away with her to Gretna. That year he published <span class="italic">Lines Addressed to Mrs Hay Drummond</span>. The first Earl Manvers presented him to two Nottinghamshire vicarages: Laxton, on 1 December 1813, and Lowdham, on 19 January 1815. On 8 November 1817 the second earl presented him to the important parish of St Mary's, Nottingham; he continued to hold Lowdham in plurality until 1839. In 1823 he was collated by the archbishop of York to the prebendal stall of Normanton in Southwell collegiate church. Lord Eldon presented him to the rectory of Wing in 1827, mainly on the strength of his book <span class="italic">Body and Soul</span> (1822), though its publication provoked some controversy, especially with Revd J. H. Browne, archdeacon of Ely. An earlier publication, <span class="italic">The History of the Destruction of Jerusalem as Connected with the Scripture Prophecies</span>, appeared in 1816.<br>
<br>On 24 April 1832 Wilkins became archdeacon of Nottingham in succession to William Barrow. His ministry at Nottingham, a parish with a population of 28,000 souls, was controversial. He took an active interest in the Nottingham dispensary for the sick poor (1831), and established an elementary school for girls (1835). But his relations with the large number of dissenters in his parish were not harmonious; he attacked dissent in his archidiaconal charges of 1834 and 1837. His attempt to collect tithes in 1833 failed. The refusal in 1843 of the vestry, dominated by dissenters, to vote a rate to pay for essential repairs to the tower of St Mary's Church caused the church to be closed, and demonstrated the unenforceability of church rates in many parishes. Wilkins announced his resignation as vicar in October 1843, accepting in its place the rectory of Beelsby, Lincolnshire, in the gift of the Southwell collegiate church, though he never resided there. He concentrated instead on the assiduous discharge of his archidiaconal duties, building two chapels of ease in Nottingham itself, and collecting &pound;2000 to restore St Mary's Church and provide sittings for 2000 people.<br>
<br>Tall, active both in body and mind, and of a fine presence, Wilkins was famous for his pulpit oratory. He wrote various sermons, charges, letters, and addresses. The latter part of his life was spent at Southwell as the last canon residentiary. There he devoted himself for many years to the restoration of both the services and the fabric of Southwell church. He died at the residence, Southwell, on 13 August 1865, and was buried south-east of the church. Of his sons, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29420/', "Henry St Clair Wilkins")</script> was a general, John Murray Wilkins (<i>d</i>. 1881) was the last rector of Southwell collegiate church before it became a cathedral, and George Dashwood Wilkins (<i>d</i>. 1885) was in the service of the East India Company.<br>
