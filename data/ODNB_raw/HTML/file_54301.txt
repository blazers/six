<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Oliphant <span class="st"> [Olifard]</span> family</span>  (<em>per. </em>1141&#150;<em>c.</em>1500), <span class="occ">nobility</span>, was important in the history of Perthshire, as well as, from time to time, in national politics. The original form of their name was Olifard. The family, which may have been of Flemish origin, first came to Scotland in 1141 in somewhat romantic circumstances: young David Oliphant of Lilford in Northamptonshire was able to save his godfather, David, king of Scots (<i>d</i>. 1153), from King Stephen's army after the siege of Winchester. They fled to Scotland where Oliphant was rewarded with lands in Roxburghshire and East Lothian. Succeeding generations continued to serve the Scottish crown to good effect, most particularly as justiciars of Lothian. David's son and heir, Walter, was married to Christian, daughter of Earl Ferteth of Strathearn, an example of a Celtic&#150;Norman marriage not uncommon in this period. Through this marriage the Oliphants gained a foothold in Perthshire, where they had become well established by the middle of the thirteenth century, along with the Ruthvens, Grahams, Murrays, and Drummonds. All these families would play a dominant role in local politics during succeeding centuries.<br>
<br>Although the Oliphants were prominent in royal circles before the fourteenth century, the most famous member of the family, by virtue of the part he played in the wars with England, was <a name="cosubject_20714"></a><span class="headword">Sir William Oliphant</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1313?)<span class="occ"></span>. Unfortunately, his activities are easily confused with those of his cousin, also William Oliphant of Dupplin and Aberdalgie<a href="#cosubject_62200"> [<i>see below</i>]</a>. Both were captured at the battle of Dunbar in 1296: Sir William was sent to Devizes and his cousin, still an esquire, to Rochester. They received their freedom in the following year, on condition that they served Edward I on his campaign against France. As a result of this service, Sir William's lands were restored to him on 12 September 1297. On his return to Scotland, however, he rejoined the fight against Edward; following the success of the Scots in taking Stirling Castle at the beginning of 1300, he was appointed its constable by the Scottish guardian, Sir John Soulis (<i>d</i>. before 1310). However, four years later most Scots had submitted to Edward I; only Stirling Castle and a few notables, including Sir William Wallace and Sir Simon Fraser, held out for King John. Oliphant tried to postpone the imminent siege by requesting that he be able to approach Soules for fresh orders; given that the former guardian was now in France, Edward rather naturally refused. A combined English&#150;Scottish army besieged the castle for ninety days, whereafter Sir William and the rest of the garrison, which included his cousin, now also Sir William, were led off again to captivity in England.<br>
<br>Oliphant was finally released in May 1308 on Edward II's orders and returned to Scotland in the latter's service to serve, from 1311 at least, as commander of Perth. Given the confusing references of subsequent years, it seems likely that his cousin also went north in Edward's service. On the night of 7&#150;8 January 1313, believing that the Scottish siege had been lifted, the garrison of Perth let its guard down and the town was duly captured by a force, led by King Robert himself, which scaled the walls. Despite the claims of later chroniclers, the garrison was most likely allowed to go free; however, Sir William seems to have died without known heirs soon afterwards, and subsequent references relate to <a name="cosubject_62200"></a><span class="headword">Sir William Oliphant of Dupplin and Aberdalgie</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1329)<span class="occ"></span>.<br>
<br>This Sir William now swore allegiance to King Robert, perhaps in the aftermath of the Scottish victory at Bannockburn. He received a number of grants of land throughout the reign and put his seal (three crescents) to the declaration of Arbroath of 1320. In the final years of the reign he also performed the office of escheator. On his death the family had substantial properties, variously acquired through inheritance, marriage, and grants from Robert I. Their landed interests were based on Perthshire and Forfarshire, with their principal residence at Aberdalgie, south-west of Perth, but they also had estates in Fife, Kincardineshire, and Midlothian. Some of these lands were later used to endow younger sons and create different branches of the family. Sir William died in 1329, some four months before the king himself. He was buried at Aberdalgie, where a magnificent tomb was constructed by his family in the following century.<br>
<br>Despite their service to Edward II, the Oliphants certainly seem to have endeared themselves to the Bruces, as the grants of land demonstrate. Even more significantly, Sir William of Aberdalgie's son and heir, <a name="cosubject_54302"></a><span class="headword">Sir Walter Oliphant of Aberdalgie</span>  (<em>d.</em> in or after 1378)<span class="occ"></span>, married Elizabeth Bruce, illegitimate daughter of the king and thus half-sister to <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/3726/', "David II (1324&#150;1371)")</script> and step-aunt to <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/23713/', "Robert II")</script> (<i>r</i>. 1371&#150;1390). In February 1365 Oliphant surrendered to the king his principal estates in Perthshire&#151;including Aberdalgie&#151;Forfarshire, and Kincardineshire, and received them back in a sequence of grants made to himself and his wife jointly, with an entail securing them for their heirs. The family continued to expand their territorial holdings, receiving, among others, the lands of Kelly, resigned by his cousin, Helen Maxwell, from King David. Although Walter was not particularly active in national politics, he is recorded in 1368 as entrusted with the keeping of Stirling Castle. His wife was also remembered by her half-brother throughout his reign, receiving &pound;3 from wine escheated by a certain William Clapham by the king's gift as late as 1365. The last reference to Sir Walter occurs in 1378. The couple had three sons: Sir John, who inherited most of the family's extensive landed interests; Sir Walter, who was the ancestor of the Oliphants of Pittotter, Kellie, Murdocairnie, and Prinlaws; and Malcolm, who founded the Ayrshire branch of the family.<br>
<br>Despite their royal connections, the Oliphants effectively retired from the national scene for over a century after 1329; it is not even known whether or not representatives of the family were present at Halidon Hill or Nevilles Cross, though it seems very likely. Subsequent events suggest that they preferred to play a greater role in local politics. Sir Walter's son, Sir John, makes little mark on the national record. In 1424, however, John's son and heir, Sir William Oliphant of Aberdalgie, was chosen as one of the hostages sent to England as part of the ransom agreement for the return of James I. He was still there in 1425, and probably died in prison. William's son, Sir John, had the misfortune to become involved in a local dispute through his marriage to Isabel, daughter of Sir Walter Ogilvy of Auchterhouse. The Ogilvys were at feud with the Lindsays, and when their quarrel took a particularly violent turn, in what has sometimes been called the battle of Arbroath, on 23 January 1446, Sir John was among those killed. His son, <a name="cosubject_20707"></a><span class="headword">Laurence Oliphant</span>, first Lord Oliphant  (<em>d.</em> 1500?)<span class="occ"></span>, was still a boy at the time of his father's death, and was put under the tutelage of Sir David Hay of Yester. In 1450 Laurence went on pilgrimage to Rome in the magnificent entourage of the ninth earl of Douglas; nevertheless, when James II embarked on his violent struggle with the Douglases a few years later, young Oliphant sided with the king and was rewarded with elevation to the peerage some time before 1458. His marriage, about 1463, to Isobel, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/54231/', "William Hay, first earl of Erroll (d. 1462)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/54228/', "Hay family")</script>], constable of Scotland, perhaps also reflects the king's gratitude. Lord Oliphant continued his service to the crown, holding the office of sheriff of Perthshire. Nevertheless, he was also involved in a number of violent feuds, including one with the earl of Buchan which in 1491 claimed the life of his brother, James. The other side of that coin was the numerous bonds of manrent into which he entered with a number of lairds, including many of his neighbours.<br>
<br>James III, too, seems to have found Oliphant's services useful, sending him as a commissioner to negotiate the marriage of James Stewart, duke of Rothesay (the future James IV), to Anne de la Pole, niece of Richard III of England, in 1484. Unfortunately, the king's alienation of the earl of Argyll, his former chancellor, ensured that Oliphant, whose son was engaged to marry Argyll's daughter, also fought against James, on behalf of the latter's son, at Sauchieburn in 1488. This decision naturally meant that Laurence continued his involvement in affairs of state under James IV, acting, among other things, as a lord of the articles and as Scottish ambassador on the continent. Lord Oliphant also found time to found a Franciscan friary at Perth, perhaps about 1460. Unfortunately, he was also engaged in a dispute with the burgesses of Perth, which resulted in the destruction of his house at Aberdalgie. His eventful life seems to have come to an end before April 1500.<br>
<br>The Oliphants provide a striking and illuminating example of the rise and rise of a Norman family. Originally maintaining their political importance and expanding their landed wealth explicitly through loyal service to the crown, the family had reached sufficient rank, socially and politically, to play a prominent role in the wars with England. The habit of loyalty to the Scottish crown, despite a brief adherence to Edward II, brought them very definite favours from Robert I. Coincidentally or otherwise, this permitted the Oliphants to concentrate on building up power at a local level, based on their main estates in Perthshire; their absence from the national scene throughout most of the fourteenth century may well thus reflect not inactivity, but a preference for local affairs of which their later involvement in feuding and bonds of manrent perhaps provides proof. The maintenance of a local power base, together with continuing loyalty to the crown, brought the Oliphants into the peerage under James II. The activities of Laurence, first Lord Oliphant, are perhaps largely typical of that rank of nobility to which the family now belonged.<br>
