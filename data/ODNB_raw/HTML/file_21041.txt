<span class="headword">Owens,  John Lennergan</span>  (<em>fl. </em><em>c.</em>1780), <span class="occ">actor</span>, was born in Ireland, where apparently he confined his performances. He acted at the Smock Alley Theatre in Dublin, where his Zanga in Edward Young's tragedy <span class="italic">The Revenge</span> was considered the best that ever succeeded that of Henry Mossop. He was known for his persistent inebriety and once, coming onstage as Polydore in Thomas Otway's <span class="italic">The Orphan</span>, he was hissed by the audience for obvious intoxication. Placing himself in a fighting position at the front of the stage he delivered the soliloquy &#145;Here I'm alone and fit for mischief&#146; with a scowl. The audience's resentment was subdued by the rage of the actor; they joined in laughter and he was permitted to finish his performance. Unfortunately, Owens's alcoholism reduced him to extreme poverty and he eventually became a beggar in the streets. On seeing John Kemble announced to play Zanga, his favourite character, six years after playing it himself Owens begged money from a person of decent appearance. When asked his name he replied with tragic solemnity &#145;Has six years' cruel absence extinguished majesty so far that nought shines here to tell you I'm the real Zanga? Yes, sir, John Lennergan Owens, successor to Henry Mossop&#146;. The gentleman was moved with compassion and gave him a shilling. On his way to get some dinner Owens was stopped by another mendicant, who implored his assistance; he stepped into a public house, changed his shilling, and gave half to the other beggar. Though the foreword to <span class="italic">The Thespian Dictionary</span> claims to list only important actors of the period Owens does not seem to be noted in other contemporary theatrical memoirs or records.<br>
