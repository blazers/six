<span class="headword">Will,  John Shiress</span>  (1840&#150;1910), <span class="occ">legal writer</span>, born John Will in Dundee, was the only son of John Will, merchant, of Dundee, but described at the date of his son's admission to the Middle Temple in October 1861 as &#145;of the parish of Hanover, co. Cornwall, Jamaica&#146;, and his wife, Mary, daughter of John Chambers. Educated first at Brechin grammar school, and afterwards at Edinburgh University and King's College, London, but graduating from neither, Will was admitted to the Middle Temple on 20 October 1861 and called to the bar on 6 June 1864. In 1873 he married Mary Anne (<i>d</i>. 1912), daughter of William Shiress, solicitor, of Brechin, Forfarshire; they had at least one child.<br>
<br>Looking &#145;a little like a pig&#146;, Will was &#145;a hard worker, a diligent student, a plodding counsel&#146;  (Browne, 87). He obtained a large parliamentary practice, took silk in 1883, and was made a bencher of his inn on 24 January 1888. He discontinued his parliamentary practice in 1885 on his election as Liberal member for Montrose burghs, for which he was re-elected in 1886, in 1892, and in August 1895. He was a dependable supporter of Gladstone whose greatest service to his party was to resign the seat early in 1896 so that John Morley, who had been recently defeated at Newcastle, could be elected in his stead.<br>
<br>Will found it hard to recover his practice, but did become the principal authority on the law relating to lighting either by gas or electricity through writings such as <span class="italic">The Law Relating to Electric Lighting</span> (1898, six editions to 1932). Eventually the newly returned Liberal government rewarded his services by appointing him in September 1906 as one of the county court judges of Liverpool. Then sixty-six and in indifferent health, he struggled to fulfil his duties and died at Liverpool on 24 May 1910.<br>
