<span class="headword">Clifford,  Henry</span>, tenth Baron Clifford  (1454&#150;1523), <span class="occ">magnate</span>, was the eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5654/', "John Clifford, ninth Baron Clifford (1435&#150;1461)")</script>, and his wife, Margaret Bromflete (<i>d</i>. 1493). A pillar of the house of Lancaster, John Clifford was killed in 1461, on the day before the battle of Towton, and was subsequently attainted, his family's lands being mainly granted to the Nevilles and Stanleys. But there is no evidence, later stories to the contrary notwithstanding, that the seven-year-old Henry Clifford was ever pursued by vengeful Yorkists, and the legend of the Shepherd Lord first recounted by Edward Hall in the mid-sixteenth century&#151;telling of the young fugitive brought up among remote sheepfolds, so that he never learned to read, while his younger brother Richard was smuggled overseas, where he died&#151;hardly stands up to scrutiny. Henry Clifford was later to be not just literate but even bookish, owning volumes on law and medicine, and developing a taste for astronomy and alchemy, while his brother is recorded in England as late as 1499. It may be that the Clifford heir thought it prudent to keep a low profile, but the fact that in 1466 Henry Harlington of Craven could bequeath him a sword and a silver bowl suggests that even then he stood in no perceptible danger. The possibility that he would recover his inheritance arose briefly in 1470&#150;71, during the readeption of Henry VI, when John Neville, Marquess Montagu, was granted the Clifford lordship of Skipton specifically during Henry Clifford's minority. But though this prospect disappeared when Montagu, with his brother the earl of Warwick, was killed at Barnet on 14 April 1471, Clifford was no more imperilled by his Lancastrian connections than he had been before, and on 16 March 1472 Edward IV granted him a formal pardon.<br>
<br>The king's clemency did at least give Clifford the prospect of succeeding to his mother's hereditary estates, based on Londesborough in the East Riding of Yorkshire, but she lived until 1493, and there is no evidence as to how he passed the years from 1472 to 1485, beyond engaging in at least one liaison which brought him an illegitimate son. The overthrow of Richard III on 22 August 1485 changed Clifford's position at once. In September he was appointed a commissioner in Yorkshire and a JP in Westmorland, and in November he successfully petitioned parliament for the reversal of his father's attainder, so obtaining restoration of the Clifford lands and title. Henry VII needed loyal supporters in the north of England, his predecessor's power base, and he built up the position of the new Lord Clifford accordingly. In May 1486 he was granted the offices of chief steward of the lordship of Middleham and bailiff of the franchise of Richmond, and about the end of that year he married Anne St John (<i>d</i>. 1508), daughter of the king's mother's half-brother. In 1494 Clifford was dubbed a knight of the Bath. He remained almost unfailingly loyal to the crown, campaigning against the Scots in 1497 and leading a force at Flodden in 1513, and perhaps acting as a member of the council headed by Archbishop Thomas Savage, through which Henry VII endeavoured to extend his power in Yorkshire. But at the same time he used royal service as a means of rebuilding his family's position in the north.<br>
<br>Clifford's activities on his own behalf were not always well received. In April 1486 he notified the authorities in York that he intended to come to that city, there &#145;to mynistre as myn auncistres haith done here to fore in all thinges that accordith to my dewtie &hellip;&#146;  (Attreed, 479&#150;80), only to be firmly informed by the city fathers that no member of his family had ever exercised authority there. In spite of this rebuff, when Yorkist rebels approached York in June 1487 in the name of Lambert Simnel, Clifford was forward to defend the city, although in the event his performance was somewhat inglorious, since he was defeated in a night-time skirmish and lost his baggage. In 1488 he and his wife joined York's Corpus Christi Guild, but he was still regarded with suspicion there, for in May 1489 the citizens refused to admit him to the city, on the grounds that his claims represented a threat to the rule of the mayor and aldermen. They were probably right to suspect his intentions; in 1513 Clifford demanded the leadership of the city's troops, and was once more refused.<br>
<br>Clifford was more successful on his home territory, in the West Riding of Yorkshire and in Westmorland. He moved round properties where no Clifford had been seen for a quarter of a century, staying in castles that he repaired or rebuilt; his works at Skipton and Barden were particularly extensive. To raise money Clifford exploited his feudal rights of wardship and marriage&#151;in 1518, for instance, selling the marriage of the heir to Askham in Westmorland for 100 marks&#151;and applied himself to the improvement of his own estates, on one occasion provoking a suit to the council against his enclosures. Such was his success that by 1496 a year's revenue from the lordship of Skipton amounted to little less than &pound;300, and at his death his total annual income was assessed at &pound;1332 2<i>s</i>. 4<i>d</i>., placing him in the top third of the English nobility for wealth. Full coffers gave Clifford the means to make friends and form alliances in circles lay and ecclesiastical. He was a benefactor to the monasteries of Shap, Bolton, Guisborough (where in 1508 he and his wife were enrolled in the priory's confraternity), and above all Mount Grace, which benefited substantially from his munificence. He established links with northern gentry families both through marriage alliances, for instance bestowing his daughters Margaret and Dorothy on Cuthbert Radcliffe and Hugh Lowther respectively, and through retaining fees. In 1493 he indented to pay Ralph Eure, the son of Sir William Eure, 10 marks yearly for services done and to be done. And no doubt he hoped to win approval through lavish hospitality, like the &#145;great Christmas&#146; recorded as held at Brough in 1521, shortly before a fire largely destroyed the castle.<br>
<br>Restoring his lordship was not an easy business for Henry Clifford, whose frequent abrasiveness as landlord and neighbour several times prompted or threatened disorder, and so led to royal disapproval, at a time when the king was paying a good deal of attention to the extension of his authority and the maintenance of order in the north. Henry VII may have hoped to bring Clifford under closer control by a <i>quo warranto</i> action challenging the latter's hereditary shrievalty of Westmorland, and although Clifford was eventually confirmed in his family's traditional rights, he appears to have fallen foul of the king again by leading resistance to royal taxation in Yorkshire, and was heavily fined. None the less Clifford attended Henry VII's funeral in 1509, and lent 1000 marks to Henry VIII in 1522. The fact that his wife was the king's kinswoman by marriage had not saved Clifford from royal displeasure, indeed, it may have served to lower him in Henry VII's eyes, for his marriage to Anne St John proved unhappy, thanks at least in part to Clifford's infidelity (he had two or three illegitimate children), and by 1499 a separation was being mooted. In the end the couple remained together until Anne died in 1508. By July 1511 Clifford had remarried; his new wife was Florence Pudsey (<i>d</i>. 1558), widow of Sir Thomas Talbot. This marriage, too, turned out badly, culminating in a suit which Florence brought in the church court at York, demanding restitution of her conjugal rights. Her husband's riposte was to accuse her of adultery with one of his household officers. Even so, Lord Clifford's second marriage, like his first, was to endure.<br>
<br>In addition to his marital difficulties, Henry Clifford also found himself at loggerheads with his son and heir, another <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5647/', "Henry Clifford")</script>, who was born about 1493, and brought up at court with the future Henry VIII. Some time after 1511 Lord Clifford complained of his son's unruliness and extravagance, not least the way in which he paraded in cloth of gold, &#145;more lyk a duke than a pore baron's sonne as hee ys&#146;  (Whitaker, 327). If the son had ideas above his station, the responsibility was largely his father's, who not only placed him at court but also set about marrying him into the high aristocracy. A union with the Talbots was brought to nothing by the bride's early death, but late in 1512 arrangements were successfully made for Henry Clifford to marry Margaret Percy, daughter of the earl of Northumberland. The son's wild ways may also have been prompted by frustration at his father's longevity. By September 1522, however, when Lord Clifford was described as &#145;feebled with sickness&#146;  (<span class="italic">LP Henry VIII</span>, 2.2, no. 2524), young Henry did not have long to wait for his inheritance. Lord Clifford died on 20 April 1523, and was buried in the following year at either Bolton or Shap. From his first marriage he left two sons and four daughters, from his second marriage a single daughter. His heir's elevation to be earl of Cumberland in 1525 owed much to Henry Clifford's labours to revive the fortunes of his family.<br>
