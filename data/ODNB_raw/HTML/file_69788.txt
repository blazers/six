<span class="headword">Henderson <span class="st"> [<em>married name </em>Meier]</span>,  Eug&eacute;nie Jane Andrina</span>  (1914&#150;1989), <span class="occ">phonetician and linguistic scholar</span>, was born on 2 October 1914 at Rose Villa, Archbold Terrace, Newcastle upon Tyne, the daughter of William Alexander Cruikshank Henderson, civil engineer, and his wife, Pansy Viola, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Schurer. The family moved in her early years to London where she went to school, though she continued to claim an ability to speak her original &#145;Geordie&#146; English.<br>
<br>After school, Henderson read English at University College, London, and achieved first-class honours. Taking advantage of the provision of phonetics classes there, she attracted the attention of the professor of phonetics, Daniel Jones, who encouraged her to study the phonetics of south-east Asian languages, and appointed her to a junior teaching post in 1938. On 8 January 1941 she married George Meier (<i>b</i>. 1913). She was to go on consistently to balance the responsibilities of a family with the demands of her career as a scholar and university teacher with grace and aplomb, and once declared facetiously in an introduction to a public lecture series that her hobby was &#145;bringing up a family of four sons&#146;. Throughout her lifetime she continued to use her maiden name for professional purposes.<br>
<br>Like a number of her contemporaries Henderson found the ultimate course of her career partly determined by the entry of Japan into the war at the end of 1941. In view of the urgent needs of the armed services for persons skilled in Japanese, and to a lesser extent in other Eastern languages, the School of Oriental and African Studies in the university became a major training centre in these languages for specific wartime purposes. Much of this work devolved on the department of phonetics and linguistics, headed by J. R. Firth, where Henderson remained until her retirement.<br>
<br>Henderson was appointed lecturer in phonetics in the department, and her principal work, along with others', was the intensive instruction of naval and air force personnel in service Japanese for various intelligence purposes. At the end of the war, research and teaching provision in oriental languages was greatly increased, following the recommendations of the Scarbrough commission, and she was made a senior lecturer, and subsequently appointed reader (1953) and professor of phonetics from 1964. At the 1982 International Congress of Linguists in Tokyo she read the plenary lecture on phonetics and phonology, subsequently published in the <span class="italic">Proceedings</span> (1983). In 1986 she was elected fellow of the British Academy. She did not shirk the administrative duties in scholarship: she was treasurer of the Philological Society from 1966 to 1974 and its president from 1984 to 1988, and she took the chairmanship of the Linguistic Association of Great Britain from 1977 to 1980.<br>
<br>Although Henderson continued her interest in Japanese she concentrated her attention, but not exclusively, on the languages of south-east Asia. She took responsibility within her own department for the initial training of newly appointed lecturers in specific south-east Asian languages (such as Thai, Vietnamese, and Cambodian) prior to these lecturers' transfer to the south-east Asia department following their initial year of study leave in the countries of their specialization. For a time she was acting head of that department, and later head of the department of phonetics and linguistics.<br>
<br>Henderson included within her competence experimental phonetics, and her 1970 article on the acoustic features of Kabardian (a central Asian language) has become one of the classics of that branch of phonetics. But the main thrust of her work in phonetics and phonology was made clear in her inaugural lecture, &#145;The domain of phonetics&#146; (1965), in which she emphasized the importance of the subject, but always and necessarily within the wider context of linguistics as a whole discipline. At the time this stood in contrast to the approach of some traditional phoneticians, for whom syntax and morphology lay rather outside their terms of reference: &#145;The phonetician cannot close his eyes to grammatical considerations if he wishes to give the most helpful account of the use made of phonic features in a given language&#146;  (Henderson, <span class="italic">Domain</span>, 7). This attitude was exemplified in her work on Tiddim Chin. In 1964 she took part in a joint expedition to Tiddim in the Chin hills of Burma, in her case for fieldwork on the language. Her analysis covered the major levels of linguistics: sentence, phrase, &#145;figure&#146; (intonation pattern), word classes, the morphological structure of words, and a brief stylistic analysis of two texts.<br>
<br>Henderson's more specifically phonological works involved the exposition and application of Firth's prosodic phonology to a number of languages. Notable among these are her &#145;Prosodies in Siamese&#146; (Thai, 1949) and her contribution to the book <span class="italic">In Memory of J. R. Firth</span> (1966). Of the former article F. R. Palmer writes in his edited <span class="italic">Prosodic Phonology</span> that it is &#145;the neatest and, in some ways, the most convincing of all the articles written in the prosodic framework&#146;  (Palmer, 27). In it she offers an analytical presentation of the interaction of the phonetic features of Thai, segmental and intersegmental, as opposed to a serial phonemic account based on the needs of a broad transcription, itself ultimately based on the letters of the Roman and the Greek alphabets. A more detailed account of Henderson's Thai article appears in Robins  (311&#150;12). A full list of her publications may be found in Davidson  (5&#150;9). The <span class="italic">Buey Karen Dictionary</span>, on which she was working before her death, was later completed by Anna Allot and published in 1998. Finally, attention may be drawn to what has turned out to be her most widely read and best-known work, her edition of a volume of extracts from the writings of Henry Sweet, which she entitled <span class="italic">The Indispensable Foundation</span> (1971), following the claim by Sweet for his own subject in relation to the entire study of language  (p. vii).<br>
<br>In addition to Henderson's academic achievement and her dedication to her family, she exhibited energy and ability in several fields: she was an accomplished amateur pianist, and for a time she ran a small dairy farm around her house and garden in Hertfordshire (&#145;when I was a cow keeper&#146;), to which her colleagues were regularly invited. This was a particular delight to her many students from south-east Asia who, fresh from reading Wordsworth in English literature classes, were thrilled actually to see in springtime &#145;A host of golden daffodils &hellip; Fluttering and dancing in the breeze&#146;.<br>
<br>In politics and in social life Henderson maintained a fairly detached pragmatic posture, particularly with regard to the playtime revolutionaries of the 1960s and their more right-wing traditional critics. Challenged in a conversation once on &#145;principles&#146;, she replied &#145;I do so distrust people who act on principle&#146;. No doubt it was her manifest common sense as well as her academic pre-eminence that led to her being approached by an Oxford college to be its head of house after her retirement, an invitation she declined as she wanted to retain her London home for visits by her sons and their families.<br>
<br>Eug&eacute;nie Henderson died suddenly at her home, 9 Briardale Gardens, Camden, London, on 27 July 1989. Following her funeral in Hampstead on 31 July, a memorial service was held in a church near University College and the School of Oriental and African Studies.<br>
