<span class="headword">Sharpe,  Ella Agnes Freeman</span>  (1875&#150;1947), <span class="occ">psychoanalyst and schoolteacher</span>, was born on 23 February 1875 at Garden Place, Cross Street, Sudbury, Suffolk, the daughter of Frank Sharpe, silk weaver, and Mary Ann Freeman. Owing to the premature death of her father, Ella Sharpe took on the responsibilities of an eldest son, forgoing the chance to study at Oxford in order to provide for her mother and sisters. She did, however, attend Nottingham University for three years, becoming an English teacher and co-head of Hucknall Pupil Teachers' Training Centre for boys and girls aged fifteen to eighteen. She held this post from 1904 to 1916, where she exhibited a profound skill in empathizing with and assessing the difficulties of adolescence.<br>
<br>Sharpe gave up formal teaching in 1917 to study psychoanalysis at the Medico-Psychological Clinic at Brunswick Square, London. She entered the clinic as a patient and was later trained to be a psychoanalyst under James Glover. Like Glover, Sharpe went to Berlin in 1920, where she was in analysis with and trained by Hanns Sachs; analysis continued with Sachs over several years during the summer months. In 1921 she was elected associate member of the British Psycho-Analytical Society, and as a member in 1923. For Sharpe psychoanalysis was an adjunct to education, and she brought to it all the proficiency in understanding human behaviour she had developed while in Nottingham. One of the large group of women coming to prominence in psychoanalysis in the 1920s, Sharpe negotiated her own position between object relations theorist Melanie Klein, an early influence (she analysed Klein's daughter Melitta Schmideberg in 1934), and Anna Freud, whom she later supported.<br>
<br>Disputes raged over the status of child analysis, and Sharpe was initially encouraged by Klein to treat children's play as the equivalent to the free associations of adults, finding Klein's conceptual tools useful in her own theories of pure art. In the 1940s debates continued between Freud and Klein (over the latter's interpretation of Freud's concept of the death instinct, for example), and Sharpe was an important voice in those discussions, taking issue with Klein over the depressive phase and the introjected love object. In the inter-war years she became an influential and highly respected training analyst, and a distinguished professional in the field of child development. Sharpe's prime contribution to this field was the recognition that imitation and play were symbolic activities structured according to &#145;interpersonal identifications&#146;  (Rayner, 50). In her work as a training analyst she was an inspiration to her students and was part of the movement to advocate the self-awareness of the analyst in the relationship with the analysand. Eschewing the path taken by the scientist, she preferred the more subjective route chosen by those &#145;who find obstinate problems within themselves for which they seek understanding and solution&#146;  (E. A. F. Sharpe, <span class="italic">Collected Papers</span>, 1950, 109).<br>
<br>Like Sigmund Freud and Ernest Jones, Ella Sharpe believed that humanistic studies, rather than pure science, were vital to the development of both the analyst and psychoanalysis. For Sharpe, the &#145;dawn of civilization is the dawn of art&#146;  (E. A. F. Sharpe, <span class="italic">Collected Papers</span>, 1950, 126) and she urged would-be analysts to remember that &#145;[o]utside the consulting-room we need to see life whole and to remember that our culture is inseparable from our conflicts&#146;  (ibid., 21). Sharpe's most original work lay in her psychoanalytic interpretation of literature, notably her essays on the religious poet Francis Thompson and Shakespeare's tragedies, in which she reconstructed Shakespeare's emotional life from the psychoanalytic evidence of the plays, and argued for the &#145;regressive movement of the libido&#146; in Hamlet. Her skills as a literary theorist are attested to in her essay on metaphor and bodily discharge, &#145;Psycho-physical problems revealed in language: an examination of metaphor&#146;. In <span class="italic">Dream Analysis</span> (1937) Sharpe elaborated on the analogousness of poetic metaphor and the process of the dream work, originated by Freud and pioneered by F. C. Prescott in <span class="italic">The Poetic Mind</span>. Sharpe was an innovator in theorizing the creative aspects of dreams, specifically the correspondences between dreams and metaphor. In Rayner's opinion her graceful prose &#145;succeeded in giving probably the best exposition of classical theory on dreams after Freud himself&#146;  (Rayner, 84). Sharpe was a forerunner of the psychoanalytic exploration of language developed by Jacques Lacan in the 1950s.<br>
<br>Sharpe, with M. N. Searl, Mary Chadwick, and M. G. Lewis, was one of the &#145;ladies&#146; of the &#145;Gordon Street m&eacute;nage&#146;&#151;so called by James Strachey because the women shared both lodgings and a certain position on psychoanalysis  (<span class="italic">Bloomsbury Freud</span>, 43). She was referred to by James Strachey as &#145;the Sharpe&#146;, a remark elicited due to a wrangle over the logistics of an impending visit to London by Melanie Klein  (<span class="italic">Bloomsbury Freud</span>, 272). This use of her name also throws light on her skills as a debater which is borne out by a reading of the proceedings of the Extraordinary Business Meetings of the British Psycho-Analytical Society, in which Sharpe pointedly defends her ground and challenges her detractors. She is remembered vividly by Sylvia Payne for her dramatic performances in her lectures and seminars&#151;her audiences were often &#145;disturbed&#146; by the physical nature of Sharpe's delivery in which both mind and body were fully operational  (<span class="italic">International Journal of Psycho-Analysis</span>, 55)&#151;most notably her reading of &#145;Sublimation and delusion&#146; at the Oxford congress in 1928. Payne paints a sensuous and lively portrait of Sharpe, all deep rich tones, colourful dress, and mobile gestures.<br>
<br>Sharpe embarked on many projects in the last few years of her life, including a manual on the training of analysts and a novel, and exhibited no signs of a waning in her intellectual energy. But the disturbances of war wreaked havoc on her physical health and she died from cardiac failure on 1 June 1947 at St Bartholomew's Hospital, London. Her <span class="italic">Collected Papers</span>, edited by Marjorie Brierley, were published in 1950.<br>
