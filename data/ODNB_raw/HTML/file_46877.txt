<span class="headword">Deuchar,  John James Walker</span>  (1851&#150;1911), <span class="occ">actuary and insurance company manager</span>, was born on 24 September 1851 in Edinburgh, the youngest of five sons of John Deuchar (1786&#150;1863), lecturer in chemistry at Edinburgh University, and his wife, Jane, daughter of James Walker, a publisher in Edinburgh. The family were Presbyterians who owned Morningside House, a modest mansion within its own park, and were well known in Edinburgh for their artistic and scientific talents. J. J. W. Deuchar studied at the Edinburgh Institute of Glasgow University until 1868, when he joined Standard Life Insurance Company as an actuarial trainee. After qualifying as a fellow of the Faculty of Actuaries, the professional body for Scotland, in 1876 he became assistant actuary for City of Glasgow Life. Public responsibilities followed. He took a leading part in founding the Insurance and Actuarial Society of Glasgow in 1881, and was an examiner for the city's Institute of Actuaries and Accountants. Unlike many actuaries, he became interested in business organization and also attended early morning lectures in law at Glasgow University. Wider professional recognition came with his election as fellow of the Institute of Actuaries, London, in 1883, followed by his appointment as actuary and secretary to Norwich Union Life Insurance Society in 1887. Norwich Union had previously given these responsibilities to two officials; Deuchar was their first joint appointment and he remained chief executive until 1910 when ill health forced him to retire.<br>
<br>When Deuchar joined Norwich Union Life it was under threat of take-over because the sixty-year-old society was languishing in a market dominated by new sales methods. Its directors refused to accept the need for change until Deuchar spelt out the options logically for the first time. He was fortunate to have an ally in George Forrester, a director keen for change, who was the society's president from 1888 to 1898; his was clearly the influence behind Deuchar, but it remained for Deuchar to transform practices. Adopting Scottish insurance company methods, he persuaded the directors to work in subcommittees so as to focus attention on crucial issues at their main board. He then produced meticulously planned proposals for expansion. Sensitive to the directors' conservatism, he initially avoided rapid overseas growth and focused on the home market, switching from old-fashioned &#145;whole-life&#146; policies to an imaginative variety of endowment schemes. These reached the key growth sector and he managed the subsequent expansion with immense skill. Tighter controls kept costs low, and he eschewed expensive press advertising, preferring to gain new business by offering better bonuses. The results proved his point. When he arrived annual new business was tottering around &pound;200,000 insured, which barely covered what was lost through claims; by 1890 it was &pound;1 million and it continued rising, to reach &pound;5 million when he retired. Initial scepticism in the insurance press turned to unqualified praise. From a ranking below at least twenty other British life-insurance firms in 1887, Deuchar took Norwich Union's new business to second place behind only the massive Prudential.<br>
<br>Deuchar's personal and social life remained more out of public view than was usual for such a prominent insurance official. He married and had two sons and two daughters; his wife died before him. From 1907 he reluctantly served as a Conservative councillor in Norwich, taking a special interest in local education. Other activities included golf, freemasonry, and the Norwich Scots Society, and he remained a Presbyterian. However, he was preoccupied with his heavy professional responsibilities, which probably caused the breakdown of his health (he suffered at different times from blood poisoning and pneumonia) and forced him to resign. A grateful board elected him a director, and he visited Egypt, hoping to regain his strength, but he died in Norwich on 6 June 1911. Despite his immense reputation as a financier, his annual salary never rose much above &pound;3000, and his total estate, shared with characteristic fairness and attention to detail in his will, was a modest &pound;14,287.<br>
