<span class="headword">Tilling,  Thomas</span>  (1825&#150;1893), <span class="occ">horse bus operator</span>, was born at Gutter Edge Farm, Hendon, London, and was baptized on 22 February 1825 in St Marylebone, Middlesex. He was the son of James Tilling and his wife, Sarah Elizabeth. His father was a Gloucestershire farmer who had moved to London earlier in the century; and by the time of Thomas's birth, James Tilling had already acquired West End shops, from where the farm's milk was delivered to customers by women dressed in traditional Welsh costume, who carried the milk in pails suspended from yokes across their shoulders.<br>
<br>Thomas Tilling's interest, however, was in horses and in 1847 he bought a carriage, which, driven by himself and drawn by his grey mare, Kitty, he hired out for weddings and other functions. He later added other greys to his stud and in 1850, with W. Stevens, bought a horse omnibus to take advantage, in the following year, of the great influx into London of visitors to the Great Exhibition. The business did not collapse, as did so many others, without these additional passengers. On 28 January 1847 Tilling married Cornelia Sevile, and they had a number of children, including Richard Stephen Tilling (1851&#150;1929) and Edward (<i>b</i>. 1858).<br>
<br>From his base in Peckham, Tilling ran his single bus, called The Times, to and from central London. A man of strict habits and with a great gift for organization, he ran his bus four times daily to a strict timetable, whether or not it was carrying many passengers. Those using it, knowing they could rely on its punctuality, increased in number and, by increasing the number of vehicles, he was eventually able to provide a quarter-hour service and to offer monthly fares to a regular clientele.<br>
<br>When, in the mid-1850s, an attempt was made to buy up all the horse buses in London, as had already occurred in Paris, Tilling refused to sell but ran in collaboration with the new combine, and his business continued to grow. In due course, when the combine, the name of which had been Anglicized as the London General Omnibus Company, had become slack and inefficient, Tilling was among the independents who also ran in opposition to it. In 1892, on the eve of his death, Tilling was running eight vehicles in association with the London General and eighteen in opposition to it.<br>
<br>Tilling also continued to act as a job master, hiring out horses and vehicles to a vast number of customers in various parts of London and then elsewhere in the country. From the outset his buses advertised &#145;T. Tilling, job masters, wedding carriages&#146;. In 1864 he began to horse the Peckham fire engine and in due course other London brigades. That year he started to operate four cabs, and was soon hiring out others. He also supplied a special service for London's doctors, many of whom did not want the trouble of looking after the horse and vehicle they needed to make their rounds. Every week he provided forage and a visit from his veterinary surgeon, who attended to all aspects of the horse's welfare, including instructions for shoeing when required. John Tilling, in <span class="italic">Kings of the Highway</span>, has recalled that his great-grandfather claimed that he &#145;would replace a lame horse, a broken carriage or a drunken coachman within the hour&#146;  (Tilling, 45).<br>
<br>With such facilities available, many other Londoners soon sought Tilling's services, especially after his sons Richard and Edward joined the business in 1867 and 1872 respectively. His many well-known clients, such as Blondin, the high-wire artist, were soon joined by others. On 12 February 1873 he married a widow, Emma Sophia Buck, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Rawlinson. In all, he had eleven children. In 1874 Tillings got the contract to supply 113 horses to the Metropolitan Board of Works. The firm built the snow ploughs which cleared its own bus routes and other streets after a particularly heavy snowfall in 1881 had brought London to a virtual standstill. It supplied many horses and carriages for the lord mayor's show and, in 1887, twenty-six landaus, each drawn by a pair of greys, for Queen Victoria's jubilee. Tillings was later able to display the royal warrant after supplying all the horses and carriages for the royal family. By this time Thomas Tilling had built up the leading private hire business in the capital.<br>
<br>Tilling soon cast his eyes further afield. When a woman requested a coach and four to take a month's holiday touring round Wales, they were provided. He became involved in the finance and organizing of hiring from Durham to Cornwall. The great effort involved in this further expansion, when he was no longer young and vigorous, was said by the family to have hastened his death. He died at Swanley Cottage, Perry Hill Farm, Perry Hill, Catford, London, on 8 January 1893, aged sixty-seven. He was buried at Nunhead cemetery on 13 February. <span class="italic">The Times</span> did not consider him worthy of an obituary, though another London paper, quoted by his great-grandson, referred to his &#145;marvellous energy, unfailing pluck and business aptitude &hellip; [He was] the prince of organizers&#146;  (Tilling, 58).<br>
<br>Thomas Tilling would not, however, be so well remembered without the public company which his sons, Richard and Edward, and his son-in-law, Walter Wolsey, formed in 1897. Thomas Tilling Ltd, with an issued capital of &pound;400,000, took over 4000 horses. The company negotiated the difficult transition from horse to motor vehicle and was, in 1907, involved in the creation of the Tilling-Stevens petrol-electric bus. It operated a number of regional bus concerns jointly with British Automobile Traction, in which Thomas Tilling Ltd acquired a considerable holding.<br>
