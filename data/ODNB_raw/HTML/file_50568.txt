<span class="headword">Russell,  Joseph</span>  (1834&#150;1917), <span class="occ">shipbuilder</span>, was born on 8 April 1834 at Blackheath, London, the son of Joshua Russell, a solicitor in Southwark, and his second wife, Jane Ann Russell. In 1835 the elder Russell gave up his legal practice to become the Baptist minister of Melksham in Wiltshire. He was comfortably off since his father, Archibald Russell, also a solicitor, had speculated successfully in the London property market. In 1844 the family returned to Blackheath and the young Joseph Russell was sent to Mill Hill School, Middlesex.<br>
<br>After leaving school in 1848 Russell attended classes at King's College, London, and was then apprenticed in 1850 to J. W. Hoby &amp; Co., engineers, iron-founders, and shipbuilders at Renfrew on the River Clyde. This firm had been established by his stepsister's husband, J. W. Hoby, a partner in the Birmingham civil engineering firm of Fox and Henderson. During 1854 Hoby's business collapsed and was taken over by its creditors. Russell completed his apprenticeship the following year and on gaining his majority was given &pound;1000 by his father. He was immediately appointed manager of the works. In 1858 he married Elisabeth (Bessie) Wright; they had three sons and six daughters.<br>
<br>Russell left Renfrew in 1859 to take over the lease of the Ardrossan dockyard in Ayrshire, building over the next six years about thirty small vessels. In May 1865 he gave up the lease as the owner would not sell the yard to him. In May 1866 he accepted the post of manager of Lawrence Hill's shipyard at Port Glasgow on the lower Clyde, investing &pound;4000 in the business. Over the next three years he built twenty-nine ships but left in 1869 because Hill was a poor businessman. He returned to London in that year in order to care for his father, who died in 1870. He spent the next three years looking after his inherited property interests in London, before returning to Scotland in 1873 to start a new shipbuilding firm, Russell &amp; Co., at Port Glasgow in partnership with Anderson Rodger and William Todd Lithgow.<br>
<br>Russell &amp; Co. was an immediate success, building large sailing vessels to semi-standard designs with interchangeable parts, in which the partners were prepared to take investments to encourage custom. However, Joseph Russell was dealt a serious setback when the City of Glasgow Bank failed in the autumn of 1878. He held &pound;300 of stock, on which he was forced to pay calls of &pound;8271. Nevertheless, in 1879 the firm expanded its facilities by acquiring J. E. Scott's bankrupt Cartsdyke yard in Greenock. This was followed by the construction of an entirely new yard at Kingston in Port Glasgow at the end of 1881. The business continued to prosper throughout the 1880s, despite the uncertainties that affected most of the shipbuilding industry. This success in part reflected the partners' willingness to experiment with new technology. In 1886 they introduced a standard 3000 ton class of sailing vessel equipped with auxiliary engines and brace halyard winches. Russell retired from the firm in 1891, loaning it nearly &pound;123,000 and leaving Lithgow in control of the Kingston and Cartsdyke yards.<br>
<br>Aged only fifty-seven, Russell was not ready entirely to retire from business concerns. He continued to assist Lithgow, particularly in looking after the financial side of the firm, and he also sought commercial opportunities for his sons William Russell and Archie Russell. He purchased a large country house, Seafield, at Ardrossan, where he could indulge his passions of shooting and riding. He had always travelled regularly to the continent and now began to go for longer periods. More of his time was devoted to work for the Free Church of Scotland and the Port Glasgow school board, and he gave regular <span class="roman">Bible</span> classes, as well as serving on the church's foreign missions, highland, and Livingstonia committees. He played an active part in the negotiations leading up to the amalgamation of the Free Church with the United Presbyterian church in 1900.<br>
<br>During the 1890s Russell began to speculate heavily in the property market, acquiring houses and land, and making loans for development in the west of Scotland. Lithgow fell seriously ill in 1907 and, although his loan to the firm had been paid off, Russell helped Lithgow's sons run the company. He managed the financial side of the business for them until 1913, when he finally retired. He died on 3 June 1917 at Seafield House, Ardrossan. His wife died in 1921.<br>
