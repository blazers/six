<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Wilberforce,  Robert Isaac</span>  (1802&#150;1857), <span class="occ">Roman Catholic convert</span>, was born on 19 December 1802 at Broomfield, on Clapham Common, the fourth child and second son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29386/', "William Wilberforce (1759&#150;1833)")</script> and his wife, Barbara Ann (1777&#150;1847), eldest daughter of Isaac Spooner of Elmden Hall, Coventry. Two of his three brothers (William, the eldest, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29383/', "Henry Wilberforce")</script>, the youngest) were later received into the Roman church, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29385/', "Samuel Wilberforce")</script>&#151;three years his junior&#151;became successively bishop of Oxford and of Winchester.<br>
<br>Wilberforce was educated at a private school owned by the Revd E. G. Marsh at Nuneham Courtenay, near Oxford, proceeding thence to Oriel College, Oxford, in 1820. He obtained first-class honours in both classics and mathematics in 1823, and three years later gained the prestigious prize of a fellowship at Oriel, becoming the colleague of the future leading spirits of the Oxford Movement: John Keble, John Henry Newman, Edward Pusey, and Richard Hurrell Froude. He proceeded to deacon's orders after taking up his fellowship and was ordained priest in 1828.<br>
<br>At this time Wilberforce's religious views were in a state of flux. He had experienced an abortive love affair shortly after taking his degree and had seriously considered becoming a missionary. In addition, his first meeting with Keble in the summer of 1823, while studying under him at a reading party at Southrop parsonage in the company of Froude and Isaac Williams, had caused him some perplexity, as he encountered for the first time the high Anglican tradition of churchmanship so utterly different in its emphasis and spirituality from the evangelicalism of his father and his Clapham friends. Cautious by nature, he reserved his judgement. In 1827, however, after reading Keble's newly published <span class="italic">The Christian Year</span>, all his misgivings disappeared, and he was prepared to declare his total devotion to its author. Up to that point he had been most closely in sympathy with Pusey, and had determined to emulate him in acquiring a command of German and Hebrew; to this end he had obtained from Pusey letters of introduction to the disciples of Schleiermacher at the universities of G&ouml;ttingen and Bonn. On the eve of his departure for Germany in the winter of 1827, however, circumstances at Oxford intervened. Edward Copleston, provost of Oriel, was appointed bishop of Llandaff, and Wilberforce&#151;anxious to see Keble at the head of his college&#151;remained in Oxford to press his claims at the ensuing election. In the event Edward Hawkins was elected provost, and Wilberforce subsequently accepted a post as college tutor.<br>
<br>For the next three years the relationship between Wilberforce and Newman (and R. H. Froude, another recently appointed tutor) became closer&#151;they had been so close, indeed, that Newman offered Wilberforce a curacy at St Mary's in 1829, which he declined; shared family social occasions aroused speculation that a match was imminent between Wilberforce and Newman's sister Jemima. Conflict at Oriel between the three junior tutors and the new provost began in the summer of 1828. Wilberforce broached a proposal, soon militantly championed by Newman and Froude, that tutorial responsibility, hitherto little more than that of a college lecturer, should be rendered more appropriate to a scholar in orders by the giving to each tutor of special charge for a limited number of serious students (&#145;reading men&#146; as opposed to the idle gentlemen commoners), over whom they would exercise both academic and moral supervision. Hawkins, at first sympathetic, became uneasy at what he suspected&#151;not without reason&#151;might encourage favouritism and provide an opportunity to indulge in religious proselytism. Disagreement turned into conflict in 1829 when Sir Robert Peel resigned as MP for the university on the question of Catholic emancipation, and Newman and Hawkins found themselves on opposite sides in the consequent bitter parliamentary election. Peel&#151;to Hawkins's chagrin&#151;failed to regain his seat, and the provost interpreted Newman's opposition to him as yet another attempt to undermine his authority. His decision to refuse to assign new pupils to Newman, Wilberforce, and Froude effectively led to the termination of their tutorships in 1831.<br>
<br>Wilberforce had been loath to support Newman in his campaign against Peel. He was not by nature a fighter. Unlike his dearly loved brother Samuel, he was a shy, self-effacing man&#151;unambitious, studious, slow to commit himself. For him, release from college duties meant the opportunity, at last, to study in Germany, and he left for Bonn in the summer of 1831. However, German student life appalled him; he could read German but felt too embarrassed to speak it. Being slightly deaf, he could not understand it when spoken to him, so his attendance at lectures induced instant sleep. Also he felt homesick. He returned to England in December 1831, sought out a lady who had stirred his heart on their first meeting at the Wilberforce home in 1828&#151;Agnes Wrangham, the daughter of the archdeacon of Cleveland&#151;and duly proposed to her. They were married in June 1832. It was entirely in his character that he spent the first day of their honeymoon in embarking upon the writing of a book.<br>
<br>There followed the quest for a suitable living, the outcome of which cooled Wilberforce's relations with Newman. There was no shortage of offers. It was even suggested that he might become first bishop of Calcutta, prudently taken no further. The most attractive proposal, which he eventually accepted, came from his father's friend Lord Brougham, the whig lord chancellor, who on hearing that the Wilberforce family fortune had virtually collapsed offered him the substantial living of East Farleigh in Kent. It gave Newman no pleasure that a friend of his had accepted preferment from an infamous whig.<br>
<br>Members of this generation of the Wilberforce circle seemed blighted by the untimely deaths of their wives. Samuel Wilberforce and his brothers-in-law Henry Manning and George Dudley Ryder (all of whom had married daughters of John Sargent of Lavington) suffered agonies of early bereavement. So it was to be with Robert too. Agnes died in November 1834, following the birth of their second son, Edward. Their first-born, William, was only one year old. A Yorkshire cousin of Agnes, Jane Legard, came to look after the stricken family, and in April 1837 she and Wilberforce were married. Three years later, in August 1840, the family moved to Yorkshire, Wilberforce securing the living of Burton Agnes, near Beverley, through an exchange sanctioned by the lord chancellor. In January 1841 he was appointed archdeacon of the East Riding, succeeding his father-in-law by his first marriage, Francis Wrangham, who was retiring.<br>
<br>In the intervening years Wilberforce had been much occupied in the writing of the five-volume <span class="italic">Life and Letters</span> of his father, who died in 1833&#151;a joint task in collaboration with his brother Samuel, published in 1838. It was not congenial work, and the less so because of Robert's growing antipathy to almost every aspect of evangelicalism, an attitude not entirely shared by his younger brother. He found himself, if not actually within the Tractarian camp, in full sympathy with Newman's <span class="italic">Lectures on Justification</span> (1838) and his attempt to represent Anglicanism as the <i>via media</i> between Roman Catholicism and continental protestantism. This view was reinforced when he came to study Lutheran doctrines more closely in his first book on a theological theme, <span class="italic">The Five Empires</span>, published in 1841. The move to Yorkshire and the tiresome archidiaconal duties, undertaken with characteristic conscientiousness, made him feel increasingly isolated from the mainstream of ecclesiastical events. He could not share Samuel's growing estrangement from Newman, but still less was he prepared to endorse Henry's devoted discipleship. It was with his brother-in-law, Henry Manning, archdeacon of Chichester from 1840, that he came to find the closest kinship, especially after a visit Manning paid to Burton Agnes in 1843. From that time on they corresponded regularly, at once sanguine in their expectations of Samuel Wilberforce's advancing ecclesiastical fortunes, but utterly downcast by a momentous event in October 1845&#151;Newman's reception into the Roman church.<br>
<br>Not from his own choosing, but very much at the instigation of Gladstone, Manning found himself cast in the role of the new leader of the shattered Tractarian ranks, and he looked to Wilberforce for help and advice at every turn, acknowledging his superior scholarship. While Wilberforce did not entirely share Manning's preoccupation with the high calling of the sacerdotal commission and his views on the importance of sacramental confession, he was at one with him in three respects: the centrality of the sacraments; the conviction that the Church of England, if it were to be seen truly as a teaching church, must be freed from all state interference in matters of doctrine; and the need within the church for a systematic corpus of theology. Both Manning and Gladstone were convinced that Wilberforce was the one man capable of producing this theological synthesis, and in the years between 1845 and 1853 he duly accepted the challenge in the form of three substantial volumes: <span class="italic">The Doctrine of the Incarnation</span> (1848), <span class="italic">The Doctrine of Holy Baptism</span> (1849)&#151;a rather more polemical work, directed against the writings of the evangelical William Goode&#151;and <span class="italic">The Doctrine of the Holy Eucharist</span> (1853). In these works, the doctrine of baptismal regeneration is set forth starkly and uncompromisingly: so too the doctrine of the real presence in the eucharist, though Wilberforce did not go so far as to accept the Catholic doctrine of transubstantiation. Most significantly, Tractarian incarnationalism receives its climactic interpretation as &#145;the great objective fact of Christianity&#146;  (<span class="italic">Doctrine of the Incarnation</span>, 4).<br>
<br>Wilberforce's grand design in the three related volumes is also expounded in his series of sermons preached between 1847 and 1850, and published as <span class="italic">Sermons on the New Birth of Man's Nature</span> (1850). Each deals with a particular aspect of the incarnation and the sacramental system, representing the doctrine of the incarnation as the very essence of Christianity (challenging the evangelical contrary emphasis on the centrality of the atonement). Wilberforce describes the sacraments as &#145;the natural outworks&#146; of the incarnation, in accordance with the teaching of St John who declared &#145;mediation to be the great law of the Gospel Kingdom, the central fact in the economy of grace&#146;  (p. 225). This massive dogmatic compendium could be taken as the swansong of mid-Victorian high-church theology. A completely new interpretation of the doctrine of the incarnation was soon to appear in the post-Darwinian decades, when Tractarian teaching and the insights of F. D. Maurice fused in the works of the Lux Mundi group, and of Charles Gore in particular. It was also a swansong in a more personal sense. While he was writing his <i>magnum opus</i> Wilberforce endured the same agonies as his friend Manning as he witnessed the seemingly inescapable proof of the inherent Erastianism of the Church of England in two successive blows: the appointment in 1847 of the allegedly heterodox R. D. Hampden to the bishopric of Hereford by Lord John Russell, and the consequent failure of the church's protests to carry the slightest weight; and the even more devastating exhibition of the church's impotence when the judicial committee of the privy council overruled the court of arches in the notorious Gorham judgment of 1850. In this case, a secular court presumed to define the doctrine of the Church of England by requiring the high-church bishop of Exeter, Henry Phillpotts, to institute to a living within his diocese a Calvinist who rejected the doctrine of baptismal regeneration. In desperation Wilberforce watched Manning, his closest friend and ally, fight and fail, and eventually accept the inevitable by seeking reception into the Roman church in 1851. His own brother Henry had already made the same decision.<br>
<br>From 1851 onwards Wilberforce entered into a period of spiritual anguish as his brother Samuel, together with Gladstone, Pusey, and Keble, strove to keep him faithful to the church of his baptism, while Newman, Manning, and his brother Henry advanced every possible argument to entice him to join them. His situation rapidly became intolerable. In January 1853 his wife died after months of illness, during which he had done his utmost to conceal the turmoil in his mind. There were rumours too that a prosecution was afoot over his extreme views on the nature of the eucharist. In the end it was the question of the authority of the church and the inadmissibility of the royal supremacy that resolved his dilemma, and he published his conclusions in what was to be his last publication, <span class="italic">An Inquiry into the Principles of Church Authority</span> (1854). He resigned his preferments in August that year, and in October left the country for Paris, where he was received into the Roman Catholic church on All Saints' eve. Gladstone, on hearing the news, wrote to Samuel Wilberforce: &#145;He stands at the head of our living divines. His withdrawal from the Church of England could be compared to nothing but that of Newman and Manning, and I am not sure that the blow would not be as great as either&#146;  (Newsome, <span class="italic">Parting of Friends</span>, 402).<br>
<br>Wilberforce's initial intention was to retire as a layman to a small estate in Connemara in Ireland (purchased against this eventuality), and to lose himself in his books. Manning pressed him to seek ordination, hoping that he would join him in the community of priests (the Oblates of St Charles Borromeo) that he had been commissioned to found in order to undertake missionary work in the poorest quarters of London. In 1856 Wilberforce entered the Accademia Ecclesiastica in Rome on the pope's nomination. While in minor orders he was taken ill with gastric fever. He died in Albano on 3 February 1857, and was buried in Rome in the St Raymond's Chapel of the church of S Maria sopra Minerva. Manning, who had been at his friend's bedside until the end, reported to Henry Wilberforce: &#145;In Rome the one thing remarked in him &hellip; was his childlike humility. He had in truth entered the kingdom of God as a little child&#146;  (Newsome, <span class="italic">Parting of Friends</span>, 409).<br>
