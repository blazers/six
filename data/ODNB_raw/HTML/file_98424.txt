<span class="headword">Rutling,  Thomas</span>  (1854&#150;1915), <span class="occ">singer</span>, was born in Wilson county, Tennessee, USA, on 24 December 1854, into slavery. His father had either run away or been sold before his birth, and his mother was sold when he was three; the fates of both parents were unknown to him. He and two siblings (an older brother and older sister) moved to a new plantation when their master's daughter married. He began working in the fields when he was eight, but soon became a household servant. In 1865, freed by Union soldiers, he joined his brother and sister in Nashville, where his sister taught him to read and write. After a brief period working for a surgeon he enrolled at the high school at the newly founded Fisk University&#151;a collection of army huts where white teachers of the American Missionary Association trained hundreds of former slaves. He paid for his tuition by waiting on the teachers' tables. He soon became a leading participant in the Literary Society's weekly debates, which developed his linguistic skills. In 1871 he became (as a tenor) a founding member of the choir that toured far from Tennessee, to promote awareness of the university and to gather funds for it. After a gruelling start, the choir&#151;soon named the Fisk Jubilee Singers&#151;attracted widespread interest with their renditions of Negro spiritual songs, and in March 1872 performed for President Ulysses S. Grant at the White House.<br>
<br>In April 1873 Rutling and the choir reached England. The British counterpart of the American Missionary Association was the Freedmen's Missions Aid Society, which had just elected Lord Shaftesbury as president. He sponsored the choir's first performance and alerted his many associates to the presence in Britain of the Jubilee Singers. Rutling and his ten companions impressed, and they were invited to sing at the home of the duke and duchess of Argyll on 7 May. By chance the queen called; the singers were now a social success. In August 1873 they moved from London to Scotland, sometimes collecting over &pound;100 daily from ticket sales. Patrons included John Burns, co-founder of the Cunard shipping line. At their final London performance in May 1874 the troupe's work was said to have raised over &pound;10,000.<br>
<br>The Fisk choir returned to England in May 1875, remaining in Europe until June 1878. With the completion of Jubilee Hall at Nashville in 1876, the original motive for the touring ended but they continued, at the risk of health and voices. The tour was hectic; other black choral groups were exploiting the market, and pirate copies of their arrangements were on sale widely. The singers took a summer break in Switzerland, and they gave a concert in Geneva before returning to London. Rutling fell ill, but rejoined the group, which met up with Isaac Dickerson (a former member of the choir) in Edinburgh (where Dickerson had been sponsored to study). In 1877 they started a tour of the Netherlands, appearing before high society and the royal family, and went to Germany, where they again performed for monarchs. Marred by illness, bickering, and the rigours of travelling&#151;to Switzerland then back to Germany&#151;the tour ended in Hamburg in June 1878.<br>
<br>Following the disbandment of the original Jubilee Singers (the bass Frederick Loudin later re-formed the Fisk Jubilee Singers as a purely commercial venture) Rutling took an extended holiday in Switzerland to recover his health before returning to performing and touring in Germany, Italy, and Austria&#151;where he seems to have fathered a son. He subsequently returned to England, where he had sponsorship from the orchestral director, August Manns. He worked as a voice teacher at various schools in Britain until 1907 when he went back to touring, mostly at nonconformist church halls, where older members were still interested in Fisk University. His autobiography, <span class="italic">Tom</span> (<i>c</i>.1907), which had music but was a mere sixty-four pages, was published in Bradford and again in Devon (suggesting that it was a private venture for sale after his recitals). Having lived in Harrogate, Yorkshire, since 1905, he died on 26 April 1915 at 97 Valley Drive, Harrogate, of disease and cancer of the liver. Friends in Harrogate paid for his funeral and the plot in Grove Road cemetery, and for the stone cross inscribed &#145;Late Jubilee Singer, Fisk University&#146; and &#145;They sing the song of the lamb&#146;. The plot also contains the remains of some of his Harrogate friends. He was remembered with affection, and his impact on wider British society was significant: his singing, his eloquence, and his diplomatic role as a representative of Afro-Americans matched those of his best friend in the Jubilee Singers, Isaac Dickerson, who had died prematurely in London in 1900.<br>
