<span class="headword">Seaman,  Lazarus</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1675), <span class="occ">clergyman and ejected minister</span>, was born in Leicester. In 1624 he was admitted sizar at Emmanuel College, Cambridge, where he graduated BA in 1628 and proceeded MA in 1631. He appears to have come from a poor family, for Calamy stated that &#145;as he came in mean Circumstances to the College, so he was forc'd soon to leave it; and to teach School for a Livelyhood&#146;  (Calamy, <span class="italic">Abridgement</span>, 2.16). A contemporary pamphlet also asserted that in the early years of his career Seaman had been &#145;a country Pedagogue&#146;  (Hotham, <span class="italic">Corporations Vindicated</span>, 58&#150;9). Seaman was ordained deacon on 12 February 1628. He is probably the Lazarus Seaman who married Elizabeth Glasier at Burwash, Sussex, on 26 October 1630, an identification which, by suggesting a possible link with the puritan networks of that county, may help explain why Seaman was later to appear as chaplain to the earl of Northumberland. Elizabeth Seaman died in 1648.<br>
<br>An occasional sermon at the parish church of St Martin Ludgate, London, procured Seaman a lectureship there in 1634 but in 1638, if not earlier, he was chosen lecturer by the parish of All Hallows, Bread Street, which was in the early seventeenth century a wealthy parochial community in the City. In the latter year, probably at the request of Philip Nye, Seaman edited and published Richard Sibbes's <span class="italic">A Glance of Heaven</span>. &#145;Having some care committed to me by Mr. P. N. whom this businesse chiefly concerned&#146;, Seaman wrote in his prefatory epistle to the Christian reader, &#145;I could doe no lesse then let you understand, here is one rich piece of Spirituall Workmanship, and wrought by a Master-builder, very usefull for building up, and beautifying of Gods Temples&#146;. In spite of this clear indication of his association with the puritan brotherhood there are no known confrontations between Seaman and the ecclesiastical authorities during this period of the Laudian rule in the church.<br>
<br>Early in September 1642, when the rector of All Hallows, John Lawson, was dying, a group of thirty-six parishioners, some of whom, such as John Venn, Maurice Gethin, Tempest Milner, and William Kendall, were important civic leaders in civil-war London, petitioned the House of Lords to request Archbishop Laud, &#145;in whose care petitioners cannot confide&#146;  (<span class="italic">Fifth Report</span>, HMC, 47), to appoint Seaman to the living. An order was accordingly issued on 9 September. Laud, now in the Tower, still believed that he had &#145;six months respite by law&#146; and procrastinated, though in the meantime he promised the earl of Northumberland that he &#145;would give this, out of my respects to his Lp., to Mr. Seaman his chaplain&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 3.248; 4.14&#150;15). However, on 6 January 1643 the Lords simply ordered Seaman to be the minister of All Hallows. Later in the year he was appointed by a parliamentary ordinance to sit in the Westminster assembly of divines, and in early April 1644 he was chosen by the earl of Manchester as master of Peterhouse, Cambridge, to replace John Cosin, who had been ejected the month before. Seaman had become an eminent presbyterian minister in the City.<br>
<br>In the following years Seaman played an active role in the Westminster assembly. He sat on several committees and took part in debates over important religious issues such as ministerial ordination, administration of the sacrament, and, above all, the form of church government. He was considered by Robert Baillie to be one of the English divines in the assembly who supported the Scottish position. Indeed, on 25 September 1644, when he was invited to preach a fast sermon before the House of Commons, Seaman reminded the house that &#145;we have a Covenant&#146; and &#145;the publique faith of the Kingdome is engaged in it&#146;. And he further admonished that &#145;it is <i>Holy</i>, <i>Just</i> and <i>Good</i>. <i>Urge it</i>, <i>Renew it</i>, but above all, <i>Keepe it</i>&#146;  (Seaman, <span class="italic">Solomons Choice</span>, 45). He was probably also involved in the concerted agitation in 1645 among the lay and clerical presbyterians in the City for a strong presbyterian church government, though his name was conspicuously absent from the signatories who presented the &#145;desires&#146; of the City ministers to the common council on 28 November. Four parishioners of All Hallows, Bread Street, signed two citizens' petitions. In any case, later in the year Seaman, as one of the deans of Sion College, London, participated in what a contemporary pamphleteer called &#145;that Syon-College-conspiracy&#146;  (<span class="italic">Divine Observations</span>, 3); according to William Walwyn, this produced the London ministers' letter against the Independents and toleration &#145;seasonably, and purposely to meet with the Letter from Scotland&#146;  (<span class="italic">Writings</span>, 172). Indeed, both the letter from the Scottish kirk and the London ministers' letter were presented to the Westminster assembly on 1 January 1646. On 27 January 1647, when he was invited to preach a fast sermon before the House of Lords, Seaman complained that:<blockquote>we are neither so cold as by publique indulgence to tolerate all opinions, nor so hot as to suppresse one Sect. Not so cold as not to admit of Presbyteriall government upon triall, and in part; nor so hot as to receive it wholly in the power, and practice &hellip; (Seaman, <span class="italic">The Head of the Church</span>, 29)</blockquote>When the sermon was published he told the House of Lords in his epistle dedicatory that their task now was to disband the army, to dismantle the garrisons, to settle the militia in safe hands, and &#145;for this <i>the Vowes of God are upon you</i> to bring the three Kingdomes unto the neerest conjunction and uniformity in Religion&#146;.<br>
<br>When the London provincial assembly was eventually convened in May 1647 Seaman, who had been appointed trier by several ordinances, was a delegate from the first classis. A faithful member, he was twice to serve as moderator of the assembly, and to attend its very last meeting on 15 August 1660. In September 1648 he was one of the ministers sent by the parliament to discuss church government with Charles I on the Isle of Wight, &#145;where his Majesty took particular Notice of the Doctor's singular Ability in the Debates&#146;  (Calamy, <span class="italic">Abridgement</span>, 2.16). In January 1649 Seaman signed the <span class="italic">Vindication</span> of the London ministers against the trial of the king. Later in the year he proceeded DD at Cambridge. &#145;This Degree&#146;, said William Jenkyn in Seaman's funeral sermon, &#145;he took by performing his Exercises appointed by the Statutes of the University&#146;. And according to Jenkyn the thesis Seaman defended in the &#145;Divinity-Act&#146; was &#145;to assert the Providence of God in disposing of Political Government&#146;  (Jenkyn, 52). This was, indeed, a timely subject in that year of political crisis, and it probably resolved doubts in Seaman's own mind. In any case he was one of the few presbyterian ministers who in future years openly preached submission to and acceptance of the Commonwealth at Cambridge as well as in London, for which he was pitilessly attacked by a pamphlet entitled <span class="italic">Lazarus's Sores Licked</span> (1650).<br>
<br>In the 1650s Seaman enjoyed the trust of the successive governments under the Commonwealth and the protectorate. He was president of Sion College in 1651 and 1652, and vice-chancellor of Cambridge University in 1653 and 1654. In the latter year he was also appointed assistant to the commissioners for London and Cambridgeshire under the new ecclesiastical system of triers. At the same time he was able to speak for the national ministry and in defence of tithes, as in his sermon before the City magistrates at Mercers' Chapel in 1650 or in his testimony before a committee of Barebone's Parliament in 1653. However, troubles arose at Peterhouse. First there was the quarrel in 1651 with Charles Hotham, a senior fellow at Peterhouse, over Seaman's refusal to accept the election of Tobias Conyers to a fellowship. Conyers was to become an Arminian and an associate of John Goodwin's gathered church in London, and his unorthodox views had been known at Cambridge. But Hotham, Conyers's tutor, complained first to a parliamentary committee and then publicly in pamphlets. He spoke against Seaman's single negative voice and absenteeism. According to Hotham, Seaman never resided at Peterhouse and his occasional visits &#145;will not amount to one of the whole seven years of his employment of that Mastership&#146;. And Hotham observed that &#145;the Mastership of the Colledge was not intended as &hellip; Augmentation to a London Ministers Parsonage&#146;  (Hotham, <span class="italic">Corporations Vindicated</span>, 50). Afterwards, in 1658 and 1659, Seaman encountered strong opposition from the senior fellows of Peterhouse when he gave one of the fellowships to his own son, Joseph. In this case he appears to have gained the favour of both Cromwells. In the unsettling situation of 1659, Seaman was also prominent among the presbyterians who tried to co-operate with the Independents and Baptists in London.<br>
<br>In 1660, after the return of Charles II, Seaman became &#145;a little estranged&#146; from his presbyterian brethren who attempted to achieve some agreement with the episcopalians for the future religious settlement. According to Richard Baxter, this was because the court gave him &#145;no encouragement&#146; and he was &#145;hardlier spoken of at Court&#146;  (<span class="italic">Reliquiae Baxterianae</span>, 229). Perhaps his earlier close relationship with the Commonwealth and the protectorate put him now in an unfavourable light in the eyes of the royalists. He was ejected from his mastership of Peterhouse in August 1660 and two years later from the ministry of All Hallows, Bread Street. In his farewell sermon he spoke of peace, especially &#145;that <i>inward</i> peace that we enjoy, if our Conscience hath been troubled with terrors of sin, wrath, &amp;c&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Second and Last Collection</span>, 4). Perhaps in the same spirit, he persuaded Baxter to refrain from publishing a statement against taking the oath under the <span class="roman">Five Mile Act</span> in 1665. He lived mostly at Hammersmith, Middlesex, where he was licensed as presbyterian in 1672. He later built a chapel in Meeting-House Yard, Wood Street, Holborn. He died at his home in Warwick Court, Warwick Lane, Newgate Street, on 3 September 1675 and was buried at All Hallows, Bread Street, four days later. Seaman was a learned man, and William Jenkyn praised him emphatically for his &#145;Casuitical&#146; theology &#145;both for directing and easing of Conscience&#146;  (Jenkyn, 53). In his will, made in the parish of Christ Church, London, on 2 June 1675, Seaman put his library of over 5000 volumes in trust and laid down stipulations for its sale. It was the first to be sold by public auction in England. He was survived by a daughter, Elizabeth Seaman, and a brother, Caleb Seaman, in Dublin.<br>
