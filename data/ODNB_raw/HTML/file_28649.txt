<span class="headword">Walton,  Christopher</span>  (1809&#150;1877), <span class="occ">collector of theosophical works</span>, was born in June 1809 at Worsley, Lancashire, the son of John Walton (<i>c</i>.1781&#150;1844) and his wife, Hannah (<i>d</i>. 1855). He was educated by the Revd Jonathan Crowther (1794&#150;1856), and while at school joined the Methodist Society at Frodsham in March 1823. His father and grandfather were fervent supporters of Methodism. After serving an apprenticeship in a Manchester warehouse Walton spent some time on the continent. In July 1829, while in Paris, he advertised English lessons after the Hamiltonian system [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/12094/', "Hamilton, James (1769&#150;1829)")</script>]. He came to London in 1830, and to the alarm of his father, because &#145;the Rent &amp; Expenses in London are so terrible&#146;  (DWL, MS 189.6 (23) J. W., 12 Oct 1831), began business first as a silk-mercer and then as a goldsmith on Ludgate Hill, a business in which he remained until 1875. He made a fortune as a jeweller and goldsmith, enabling him to pursue his interest in theosophy. He became particularly interested in the mystical works of William Law.<br>
<br>Walton was introduced to the writings of Law by Wesley's <span class="italic">Extracts from the Rev. Mr Law's Later Works</span> (1768), and through Law he discovered the early seventeenth-century Silesian mystic Jakob Boehme. As a result he became an indefatigable collector of the works of Law and Boehme. Walton devoted &#145;time, means, and untiring energy to the collection, elucidation, and, as far as possible, the geometrical demonstration of the system&#146; contained in Boehme's writings  (<span class="italic">Christian Life</span>, 535), believing he had discovered the key to Boehme in the diagrams of Dionysius Andrew Freher. About 1845 he advertised for an assistant to help prepare a biography of Law, for which he acquired a great collection of antiquarian works in addition to his existing library. He began to print an <span class="italic">Outline of the Qualifications &hellip; for the Biography of &hellip; Law</span> in November 1847, finally completing it at Christmas 1853, but he circulated copies of the incomplete text before it was finished. To the completed work he added <span class="italic">To the Christianity, the philosophy, the erudition, science and noble intelligence of the age. Notes and materials for &hellip; biography of &hellip; Law. Comprising an elucidation of &hellip; the writings of &hellip; B&ouml;hme, and of his great commentator &hellip; Freher; with a notice of the mystical divinity &hellip; of all ages of the world</span> (1854). The 700-page work is disorderly beyond description, &#145;a chaotic mixture of the relevant and the irrelevant&#146;  (Hobhouse, 196), yet it contains much bibliographical and biographical information of value. He also printed <span class="italic">Introduction to Theosophy, or, The Science of the &#145;Mystery of Christ&#146;</span> (1854), projected to be completed in 30 volumes, but only fragmentary pieces by Law gathered by Walton were issued in a second volume. Walton donated copies to every major public library in the world. Some other anonymous works relating to theosophy were probably written at Walton's suggestion and printed at his expense. He kept his &#145;Theosophian Library&#146; at 8 Ludgate Hill, and made it freely available to those who shared his interests. In August 1876, at the suggestion of his friend Keningale Cook, Walton offered the books he had collected to Dr Williams's Library, stipulating that they should be kept apart as the &#145;Walton Theosophical Library&#146;, and always be available to those interested in the subject. His manuscripts relating to Law were included in the gift. Alexander Gordon was paid &pound;20 to catalogue the books. The Walton collection now forms the best collection of books on seventeenth- and eighteenth-century mysticism in Britain.<br>
<br>Walton's interest in Law, Boehme, and Freher was religious, and, though he could criticize Wesley, his lifelong attachment to Methodism was the expression of a deep personal conviction. On his settlement in London in 1830 he joined the City Road Chapel. From 1839 he was one of the secretaries to the Strangers' Friend Society, and about 1843 he wrote its history. The new Methodist chapel built at Benfleet, Essex, in 1877 was a gift of Walton. He married twice. With his first wife, Anna Maria Pickford, whom he had married on 1 January 1841, he had two sons and three daughters; she died on 29 December 1863 after a lengthy illness. On 2 October 1876 he married Sarah Ann Tyler; they had one daughter.<br>
<br>Walton died on 11 October 1877 at 16 Cambridge Terrace, Southend-on-Sea, Essex, and was buried in Highgate cemetery on 15 October. His second wife survived him. Alexander Gordon, a personal acquaintance, described him as physically &#145;of large build and in character sententious but kindly, and absolutely destitute of humour&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>). From family correspondence it is clear that he quarrelled bitterly with some of the closest members of his family. A demanding husband and parent, he spent long periods estranged from his elder son, John, who in 1868 had him committed to Newgate for libel. They were eventually reconciled, but Walton's sister and his daughter Mary Elizabeth also began actions against him for libel. On the death of his son Christopher he adopted a boy (said to be his natural son), to whom he gave his own name.<br>
