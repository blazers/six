<span class="headword">Vetch,  James</span>  (1789&#150;1869), <span class="occ">engineer</span>, third son of Robert Vetch of Caponflat, Haddington, East Lothian, and his wife, Agnes Sharp, was born at Haddington on 13 May 1789. Educated at Haddington and Edinburgh, he entered the military college at Great Marlow, from where in 1805 he was transferred to the Royal Military Academy at Woolwich. He was employed on the trigonometrical survey at Oakingham, Berkshire (1806), until he was commissioned second lieutenant in the Royal Engineers in 1807. He was promoted lieutenant in 1808. After serving for three years at Chatham and Plymouth, he was sent in 1810 to Spain, where he served at the blockade of Cadiz and in the battle of Barossa on 5 March 1811, and was made the bearer of dispatches to Gibraltar. Vetch then went from Tangier to Tetuan to report on the capabilities of the country to furnish engineer supplies. In 1812 he took part in the siege of Badajoz. He was promoted second captain in 1813, and returned to England the following year. For his services in the Peninsula he received the war medal with clasps for Barossa and Badajoz.<br>
<br>From 1814 to 1820 Vetch commanded a company of sappers and miners at Spike Island in Cork harbour and afterwards at Chatham. In 1819 he was appointed to the Ordnance Survey. After initial work on the Irish survey, he was employed from 1821 until 1823, with Thomas Drummond, Robert Kearsley Dawson, and Thomas Colby, on the triangulation of the Orkney and Shetland islands and of the western islands of Scotland. Their work virtually completed the primary triangulation of Great Britain by the survey, although a long gap caused by a concentration on the Irish survey meant that it was not finally completed until 1838&#150;41.<br>
<br>Promotion being very slow, Vetch went on half pay on 11 March 1824, and, going to Mexico with John Rule, managed the silver mines of the English Compania de Real del Monte and of the Compania de Bola&ntilde;os. He also worked for the Anglo-Mexican Association, and later the United Mexican Company. He returned to England in 1829, but again went to Mexico after his marriage on 2 February 1832, in London, to Alexandrina Ogilvie (<i>d</i>. 1853), daughter of Robert Auld of Edinburgh. They had ten children. He remained in Mexico until 1835 constructing roads in connection with the mines, organizing efficient systems of transport, and paving the way for the great expansion in mining in that country. Sir Henry Ward, the British envoy, in an official report, called attention to his services. Feeling the want of a good map, Vetch made astronomical and barometrical observations, measured several short base-lines, and triangulated a large tract of country. His papers and maps from Mexico were presented after his death to the topographical department of the War Office. He presented a valuable collection of Mexican antiquities to the British Museum and in 1836 wrote a paper about them. Having returned to England, Vetch was resident engineer of the Birmingham and Gloucester Railway Company from 1836 to 1840 for the construction of one half of that line of railway.<br>
<br>In 1843 Vetch published an <span class="italic">Enquiry into the means of establishing a ship navigation between the Mediterranean and Red seas</span>, after having worked on the problem since 1839. The work ran through several editions and attracted much public attention, but the government, and especially Palmerston, opposed the plan as contrary to the political interests of the country. Twelve years later Ferdinand de Lesseps, a former French diplomat who is usually credited with being the inspiration behind the Suez Canal, which opened in 1869, published his scheme, printing Vetch's opinions as an appendix to his work.<br>
<br>In 1842 Vetch designed an effective system of sewerage for the borough of Leeds. In 1843 he and Sir Henry Thomas De la Beche prepared designs for the drainage of Windsor, and his designs for the drainage of Windsor Castle and parks and the purification of the Frogmore lakes were completed in 1847. Vetch was appointed one of the three commissioners to effect the <span class="roman">Assessionable Manors of the Duchy of Cornwall Act</span> of 1844. This reformed tenancy arrangements on the seventeen assessionable manors in the duchy in order to raise agricultural productivity. Vetch resided first at Devonport and then at Truro, and was commended when the commission's work was completed in 1846.<br>
<br>In 1844, 1845, and 1846 Vetch was examined before the tidal harbours and the harbours of refuge commissions, arguing for the advantages of using wrought-iron framework in the construction of piers and breakwaters. In July 1846 he was appointed consulting engineer to the Admiralty on all questions relating to the harbours, rivers, and navigable waters of the United Kingdom. In 1847 he was appointed to the new harbour conservancy board at the Admiralty, and in 1853 was appointed sole conservator of harbours. He published reports between 1847 and 1859 on several harbours in the United Kingdom. From 1849 to 1853 Vetch held the time-consuming honorary office of metropolitan commissioner of sewers. In 1849 he proposed an extended water supply for London, and in 1850 designed a system of drainage for Southwark. In 1858&#150;9 he was a member of the royal commission on harbours of refuge.<br>
<br>Vetch retired from the Admiralty in 1863. He was elected a fellow of the Geological Society in 1818 and of the Royal Society in 1830, in which year he was a founder fellow of the Royal Geographical Society. He became an associate of the Institution of Civil Engineers in 1839 and a member of the Soci&eacute;t&eacute; Fran&ccedil;aise de Statistique Universelle in 1852, and was a member of other learned bodies. He died on 7 December 1869 at Munster House, Fulham, and was buried in Highgate cemetery. Seven of his children survived him, including the Revd James Edward (<i>d</i>. 1870), Robert Hamilton, colonel, Royal Engineers, and William Francis, major-general, Royal Dublin Fusiliers. Vetch published many papers, mostly in connection with the engineering projects on which he was engaged, but also on other geographical and archaeological topics.<br>
