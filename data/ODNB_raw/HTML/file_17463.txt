<span class="headword">Macdonnell, Sir  Richard Graves</span>  (1814&#150;1881), <span class="occ">colonial governor</span>, was born in Dublin on 3 September 1814, the eldest son of Dr Richard MacDonnell (<i>d</i>. 1867), later provost of Trinity College, Dublin, and his wife, Jane, daughter of Richard Graves, dean of Ardagh. He was educated at Trinity College, Dublin, from which he graduated BA in 1835, LLB in 1845, and LLD in 1862. He was called to the Irish bar in 1838, and to the English bar, at Lincoln's Inn, in 1841. He married in 1847 Blanche Ann, daughter of Francis Skurray of Brunswick Square, Brighton.<br>
<br>On 20 July 1843 Macdonnell was appointed chief justice, and on 1 October 1847 governor, of the Gambia. Here he explored the interior from the Gambia to the Senegal rivers and quelled tribes hostile to European river traders. In 1852 he was nominated governor of St Lucia, but proceeded instead on 10 January 1853 to St Vincent as lieutenant-governor. In June 1855 he became governor of South Australia, where he encouraged further exploration and settlement, and became embroiled in controversy over the readiness of that colony for responsible government. He took a strong line on the effective authority of the governor, which he took with him to his next appointment, in Nova Scotia, in May 1864, after two years of inactivity. Sent to foster the idea of union between the maritime communities, Macdonnell was profoundly critical of proposals for a wider Canadian confederation, and was embarrassed when the British Colonial Office took up that scheme. He departed for Hong Kong in October 1865, where he exercised his final governorship; he retired in 1872. In Hong Kong, as elsewhere, Macdonnell's abrasive personality made him deeply unpopular: Rutherford Alcock apparently described him as &#145;coarse, bumptious, and exceptionally uncouth and uncourteous&#146;  (Coates).<br>
<br>Macdonnell had become CB in 1852, was knighted in 1856, and was created KCMG in 1871. He died at Hy&egrave;res, France, on 5 February 1881, and was buried in Kensal Green cemetery on 14 February. He was survived by his wife.<br>
