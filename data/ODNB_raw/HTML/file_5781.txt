<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Cockerell,  Charles Robert</span>  (1788&#150;1863), <span class="occ">architect</span>, was born in London on 28 April 1788, the third of the eleven children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5783/', "Samuel Pepys Cockerell (1753&#150;1827)")</script>, architect and surveyor, and his wife, Anne, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Whetham. He was educated at a private school near the City Road, Finsbury, and afterwards at Westminster School, where he remained from 1802 until the age of sixteen. He began his architectural training in his father's office, from which he moved after four or five years to the office of his father's friend Robert Smirke, then engaged in building the new Covent Garden Theatre (1808&#150;9), a pioneering work in the Greek revival manner.<h2>
<a name="Travelsathomeandabroadthegrandtour"></a>Travels at home and abroad: the grand tour</h2>In the summer of 1808 Cockerell's father arranged for him to make a picturesque tour of the west country and Wales in the company of the distinguished watercolour painters Thomas and William Daniell. His perceptive journal of this tour, called <span class="italic">Memorandum</span>, survives. Two years later his father sent him on a continental grand tour from which he did not return until 1817, four years later than originally planned, having made many startling discoveries in the field of ancient Greek architecture and sculpture.<br>
<br>With Italy and France inaccessible to the British during the Napoleonic wars, it was in the improbable role of a king's messenger, with dispatches for the fleet at Constantinople, that Cockerell set sail for Constantinople in April 1810. This plan had been arranged by his father's friend William Hamilton FRS, under-secretary of state for foreign affairs, and previously private secretary to Lord Elgin. A note of Byronic romance entered Cockerell's dramatic sea voyage, which involved passing within sight of Cadiz during its bombardment. It was therefore appropriate that in both Constantinople and Athens, where he arrived in June 1810, he moved in the circle of Byron. He also made friends with a group of international scholars, travellers, and architects, including Karl Haller von Hallerstein (with whom, so Cockerell wrote to his sister, he swore eternal friendship), the Liverpool architect John Foster, John Cam Hobhouse, later Lord Broughton (an old schoolfriend from Westminster), the landscape painter Jakob Linckh from W&uuml;rttemberg, the Hon. Frederick North (later Lord Guilford), Baron Otto von Stackelberg, and the Danish archaeologist Peter Br&oslash;ndsted.<br>
<br>In April 1811 Cockerell, Hallerstein, Linckh, and Foster travelled to the island of Aegina, near Athens, after an evening drinking with Byron, to study the late Archaic temple of Aphaia, then known as the temple of Jupiter Panhellenius. In April 1811 Cockerell and his companions made the revolutionary discovery that the temple, of local limestone faced with cream-painted stucco, was richly painted in bright colours. Cockerell published his discovery that, contrary to the views of Winckelmann, polychromy was integral to Greek architecture from the start. They also excavated the pedimental sculpture, stylistically important as transitional between archaic and classical. Cockerell's hope that it might be purchased by the British government was thwarted when it was acquired for the Glyptothek in Munich by the crown prince of Bavaria (later Ludwig I).<br>
<br>In August 1811 Cockerell and his companions moved on to the temple of Apollo Epicurius at Bassae in the Peloponnese, a building ascribed by Pausanias to the architect of the Parthenon, Ictinus. Regarded today as one of the first Greek works with an aesthetically designed interior, this unique monument exhibited numerous divergencies from the supposedly rational Greek ideals: engaged columns, the first Corinthian capital, Ionic columns with uniquely flared bases and capitals, and a figured frieze in the interior, not on the exterior. In 1813, Cockerell arranged for the purchase of this 102 foot frieze by the British government for display in the British Museum. In his account of the temple, which he dedicated to the memory of William Hamilton, Cockerell evoked its almost proto-baroque quality by claiming that &#145;considerations of optics and perspective&#146; were paramount in its design, and that its &#145;peculiarities &hellip; exhibit the perspective science of the architect, and show how freely and confidently he could deal with his material, regardless of the reproach of anomaly and caprice&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Temples of Jupiter Panhellenius at Aegina, and of Apollo Epicurius at Bassae</span>, 1860, 57, 48).<br>
<br>In November 1811 Cockerell and his friends founded a private club called the <i>Xeineion</i> (&#145;token of friendship&#146;), giving each other bronze rings which were inscribed <i>Xeineion</i> and bore images of the owl of Minerva. In 1811&#150;12, together with Foster and Frederick North, Cockerell made a tour of Hellenistic sites in Asia Minor, meeting, in Smyrna, Captain Frederick Beaufort, who was in command of HMS <i>Fredericksteen</i>. Beaufort invited Cockerell to accompany him on a tour of investigation of the southern shores of Asia Minor. Cockerell left Beaufort in Malta to travel to Sicily, where he spent three months in 1812 measuring the problematical temple of Jupiter Olympius at Agrigento, the largest of all Greek Doric temples. The outer columns were, unusually, not free-standing, but were half-columns engaged against a continuous solid wall. The temple was also vigorously sculptural, incorporating male figures, or telamons, 25 feet high. Cockerell published his discoveries at this temple, which had a profound influence on his own buildings, in the supplementary volume of <span class="italic">The Antiquities of Athens</span> (1830) by J. Stuart and N. Revett.<br>
<br>In the summer of 1813 Cockerell fell seriously ill in Athens with a fever, but on recovery he returned via Albania to make a tour of the Peloponnese and the archipelago. With the abdication of Napoleon in April 1814, he was able to visit Italy, and spent the winter of 1815&#150;16 in Rome. In the spring of 1816 he was in Florence, where he won further fame with a proposed restoration of the group of <span class="italic">Niobe and her Children</span> in the Uffizi as a pedimental sculpture. In the same year he made one of the first of his independent designs for a building, a palace for the duke of Wellington, an idea suggested by his father. He found the task so uncongenial that he wrote to his father from Milan in 1816 that:<blockquote>I am an artist &amp; nothing but an artist. I am a good painter spoilt. The more I have seen of Italy the more persuaded I am that I was born to be a painter. If I must adopt architecture I must appear in this and this only, as professor of the beautiful in architecture. (Watkin, <span class="italic">Life and Work</span>, xxi&#150;xxii)</blockquote>
<h2>
<a name="Establishmentinarchitecturalpracticeearlyworksmarriageandfamily"></a>Establishment in architectural practice; early works; marriage and family</h2>After returning to London in June 1817, Cockerell dutifully followed his father's advice, setting up as an architect in elegant premises in Old Burlington Street, Mayfair, provided for him by his ever generous father. In 1819 he was one of the founder members of the Travellers' Club, intended as a place where the British might entertain foreigners who had given them hospitality while on their grand tours. The Travellers' Club was an extension of Cockerell's <i>Xeineion</i> in that it was a late expression of the ideals of international fraternity, both social and intellectual, which were associated with the eighteenth-century Enlightenment. From 1819 Cockerell was a member of the committee of the Travellers' Club, together with Lord Auckland, Lord Lansdowne, Lord Palmerston, the Hon. Robert Clive, the diplomat and oriental scholar Sir Gore Ouseley, the classical topographer and numismatist Lieutenant-Colonel W. M. Leake, and the diplomat, antiquary, and Egyptologist W. R. Hamilton. The Travellers' Club was valuable to Cockerell as a source of patronage, for three of his fellow committee members, Lansdowne, Clive, and Ouseley, employed him to remodel their country seats, Bowood, Oakly, and Woolmers, respectively.<br>
<br>Cockerell's awareness of the richness and freedom of Greek architecture, and especially of its sculptural basis, made him recognize that the architecture of later periods from ancient Rome to baroque Italy retained many Grecian qualities. In this generosity and lack of pedantry he was very different from more pedestrian Greek revival architects such as William Wilkins and Sir Robert Smirke. He had been the first to note, and measure, the entasis on the columns of the Parthenon, sending the details in a letter to Smirke of 23 December 1814. In his early works he attempted to incorporate souvenirs of his Grecian discoveries, as in the dining-room at Grange Park, Hampshire (1823), a sumptuous interior inspired by the cella of the temple at Bassae, and in his dramatic staircase hall of the same year at Oakly Park, Shropshire, where he incorporated a top-lit cast of the Bassae frieze. In 1822 he was chosen by a Scottish committee to design the national monument on Calton Hill, Edinburgh, intended by its sponsors to be a full-scale replica of the Parthenon. Between 1824 and 1829 twelve columns were erected, after which work ceased.<br>
<br>Cockerell's most important early work was the Hanover Chapel (1823&#150;5; dem. 1896), a twin-towered Grecian edifice with an iron and glass dome which was a striking feature of Nash's new Regent Street. We can follow the painstaking process by which his designs evolved in these years from his diaries which survive for the years 1821&#150;30 and 1832. They reveal him as a fastidious perfectionist, concerned with self-improvement, both architectural and moral. Full of self-criticism, he was vigorously opposed to the dry manner of the Greek revival in which he had been trained by Smirke. In these years, too, he compiled a manuscript album, &#145;Ichnographica domestica&#146;, a fascinating illustrated record of his visits to English houses which reveals him as a remarkably early pioneer in the appreciation of the powerful and inventive work of Vanbrugh and Hawksmoor.<br>
<br>On 4 June 1828 Cockerell married Anna Rennie (1803&#150;1872), daughter of the civil engineer John Rennie; they had ten children, of whom one, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5782/', "Frederick Pepys Cockerell")</script>, followed him as an architect. Despite his early wish to be an artist, Cockerell became associated at the start of his career with the expanding world of banking and of life insurance. His first commercial building in London, the Westminster, Life and British Fire office, Strand (1831&#150;2; dem. 1907), had a Greek Doric portico in antis combined with a rich surface texture embellished with figure sculpture, a form inspired by Palladio's Loggia del Capitaniato in Vicenza. He adopted this Grecian mannerism for his subsequent commercial buildings in London, notably the London and Westminster Bank, Lothbury (1837&#150;9; dem. 1928), and the Sun Fire office, Threadneedle Street (1841&#150;2; dem. 1971).<h2>
<a name="Majorworks"></a>Major works</h2>Cockerell created a more heroic language for his three major projects of the late 1830s, the University Library, Cambridge, the Ashmolean Museum and Taylor Institution, Oxford, and the unexecuted Royal Exchange. Of his Cambridge library, planned as a monumental courtyard, only the north range was executed, in 1837&#150;40. Though with details of a Greek austerity of line, the entrance front is dominated by a Roman triumphal arch theme, developed from Alberti's S. Andrea, Mantua, where the arch similarly breaks through the entablature. Cockerell's library achieves much of its commanding visual effect by the contrasting colours of the two stones of which it is constructed, white Portland stone and a brownish Whitby stone from Yorkshire.<br>
<br>At the Ashmolean Museum and Taylor Institution, Oxford (1841&#150;5), Cockerell similarly rejected the traditional local building stone, a brownish Oxford limestone, in favour of an inventive polychromy of three stones: a yellow Bath stone for the main walls, Portland stone for the columns and ornamental details, and Whitby stone for the basement. Conceived by Cockerell as a way of introducing Greek polychromy in a northern climate where external paint would not survive, this combination of materials had already been employed by one of his heroes, Inigo Jones, at the Banqueting House. At the Ashmolean Museum, Cockerell combined Greek elements with features derived from Vignola's Palazzo Farnese at Caprarola, a combination appropriate for a building intended to house the university's collection of antique sculpture, and of European paintings, mainly Italian.<br>
<br>The commission for the Ashmolean Museum also involved the provision of premises for the Taylor Institution, the university department of modern languages. Cockerell insisted that the columns of the Bassae Ionic order on the fa&ccedil;ade of his Taylor Institution should be crowned by four female figures, representing France, Italy, Spain, and Germany. The university authorities had wanted them to be statues of famous male authors, but Cockerell was an upholder of eighteenth-century generalization, not of Victorian nationalism. He was also aware that to surmount Ionic columns with female figures was an appropriate reflection of Vitruvius's claim that the Ionic order originated in the female form and dress.<br>
<br>Cockerell entered unsuccessfully a vast number of important competitions, including those for University College, London (1826), the Duke of York's column (1832), the National Gallery (1833), the Houses of Parliament (1835), the Reform Club (1837), the Royal Exchange (1839), and the Carlton Club (1844). In his highly individual design for the Houses of Parliament he largely ignored the requirement that the new building should be in either the &#145;Gothic or Elizabethan&#146; style, producing a domed Renaissance building, incorporating echoes of Longleat and Hatfield. He also sensitively proposed preserving far more of the important remains of the medieval Palace of Westminster than his fellow competitors.<br>
<br>Cockerell's elliptical concert hall of 1851&#150;6 at St George's Hall, Liverpool, where he took over from Harvey Lonsdale Elmes on his death in 1847, has a sensuous beauty which owes much to the undulating balcony of delicate cast-iron lattice-work carried on beautiful caryatids, inspired by those of the Erechtheion. With its golden-brown colouring, its richly decorated pilasters and friezes of papier m&acirc;ch&eacute;, its grained and varnished wooden surfaces, and its dramatic use of mirrors, it is one of the loveliest interiors of nineteenth-century England.<h2>
<a name="Academiclife"></a>Academic life</h2>In his lectures as professor of architecture at the Royal Academy from 1841 to 1856, extensively reported in <span class="italic">The Athenaeum</span> and <span class="italic">The Builder</span>, Cockerell upheld a humanist view of classical architecture as an image of ideal beauty which would reprimand the modern world for its commercialism and lack of high ambitions. This was ultimately dependent on a Vitruvian view of architecture as a representation of the human body seen as an ideal type of beauty. Like his late eighteenth-century French predecessors such as Boull&eacute;e and Ledoux, he believed that &#145;The universality of certain primordial forms in all styles favours the notion of innate ideas, the cube, the sphere, the ellypsoid &hellip; common to the art of all time and people&#146;  (&#145;Lecture V&#146;, <span class="italic">The Athenaeum</span>, 18 Feb 1843, 159). He lectured in front of a large watercolour called <span class="italic">&#145;The professor's dream&#146;: a symposium of the principal architectural monuments of modern and ancient times, drawn to the same scale</span>, which he first exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1849. Its format echoed that of another painting for which he was also well known, <span class="italic">Tribute to the Memory of Sir Christopher Wren</span> (1838), in which he imaginatively assembled all of Wren's works in a single composition. He was one of the finest of all British architectural draughtsmen. Numerous drawings by him survive at the Victoria and Albert Museum, the British Architectural Library Drawings Collection, and Cambridge University Library.<h2>
<a name="Publicoffices"></a>Public offices</h2>Cockerell's numerous public offices included that of surveyor of St Paul's Cathedral, where he succeeded his father in 1819, and architect to the Bank of England, in succession to Soane in 1833; he was elected ARA in 1829, RA in 1836, and professor of architecture in 1840. In 1848 he was the first recipient of the royal gold medal of the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA), succeeding Earl de Grey in 1860 as the institute's first professional president. He was an honorary DCL of Oxford University, and a member of the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/92790', "Society of Dilettanti")</script>.<br>
<br>Cockerell's essentially European outlook was underlined by the numerous foreign honours lavished on him: in France, he was one of the eight <i>associ&eacute;s &eacute;trangers</i> of the Acad&eacute;mie des Beaux-Arts, an associate member of the Institut de France, and a chevalier of the L&eacute;gion d'honneur. He was one of the ten members of merit of the Accademia di San Luca in Rome, and a member of the royal academies of Bavaria, Belgium, and Denmark. He was also a member of the academies of Geneva and Genoa, of the Archaeological Society of Athens, and of the American Institute of Architects.<h2>
<a name="Laterlife"></a>Later life</h2>After retiring from his professorship at the Royal Academy in 1857 and from practice in 1859, Cockerell died on 17 September 1863 at home at 13 Chester Terrace, Regent's Park. A week later, following his funeral in St Paul's Cathedral, he was buried in the crypt of the cathedral, where a monument was later erected to him and his wife from designs by their son Frederick Pepys Cockerell. Richly carved in low-relief sculpture, this tablet incorporates, appropriately, a capital of the Bassae Ionic order.<br>
<br>Cockerell was widely revered for his scholarship, his high professional and artistic ideals, and his dignified, even noble, bearing. Of strikingly handsome appearance, he was a perfect example of the Victorian Christian gentleman; his son claimed of him that &#145;Meanness, coarseness, or wrong-doing were abhorrent to him&#146;  (<span class="italic">Architectural Review</span>, 12, 1902, 146), and George Aitchison noted that he had &#145;the dignified and refined manner of the high-bred English gentleman&#146;  (<span class="italic">RIBA Transactions</span>, new ser., 6, 1890, 261).<h2>
<a name="Contemporaryandlaterassessment"></a>Contemporary and later assessment</h2>Cockerell's subtle, learned, and allusive architectural language found no imitators in England, but it is in France that analogies can be found, in the n&eacute;o-Grec work of Beaux-Arts architects such as Hittorff, Caristie, Labrouste, Duc, N&eacute;not, Ginain, and Pascal. Cockerell's isolation from contemporary English trends is suggested by his portrayal in the carved frieze on the Albert Memorial in improbable association with A. W. N. Pugin and Sir Charles Barry. None the less, the merit of his work has been recognized from his own day to the present, with the exception of the fanatical Goth A. W. N. Pugin, for whom the Ashmolean Museum was an &#145;unsightly pile of pagan details &hellip; [which] if it pleases the admirers of gin-palace design &hellip; will draw down the indignation of every true disciple of Catholic and consistent architecture&#146;  (<span class="italic">An Apology for the Revival of Christian Architecture in England</span>, 1843, 3).<br>
<br>A more typical reaction to the Ashmolean was that of the influential architectural historian James Fergusson, who wrote of it, just thirty years later, that &#145;there is perhaps no building in England on which the refined student of architecture can dwell with so much pleasure&#146;  (<span class="italic">History of the Modern Styles of Architecture</span>, 2nd edn, 1873, 349). Of Cockerell's branch Bank of England, Liverpool, the critic Heathcote Statham wrote in 1912 that Cockerell &#145;produced two or three fa&ccedil;ades for the branch Banks of England&#151;one especially in Liverpool&#151;the study of the details of which is a liberal education&#146;  (<span class="italic">A Short Critical History of Architecture</span>, 1912, 527), while the architect H. S. Goodhart-Rendel went so far as to claim that, &#145;Never has there been a more accomplished English architect than he, nor one more originally creative&#146;  (<span class="italic">English Architecture since the Regency</span>, 1953, 74).<br>
