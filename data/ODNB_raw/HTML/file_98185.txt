<span class="headword">Fullard,  Philip Fletcher</span>  (1897&#150;1984), <span class="occ">air force officer</span>, was born at 9 Mayfield Road, Wimbledon, Surrey, on 27 June 1897, the only son of Thomas Fletcher Fullard of Hatfield, a foreign correspondent and former private secretary to the American ambassador to Russia, and his wife, Annie Harriet Maud, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Diver. Educated at King Edward VI School, Norwich, he played football with the Norwich City reserves before, in 1915, enlisting in the inns of court officer training corps. Commissioned into the Royal Irish Fusiliers in 1916, he became a machine gun instructor, an experience to which he attributed his practice of always being meticulous in checking his aircraft weapons and their ammunition. Accepted for the Royal Flying Corps, he attended the School of Military Aeronautics at Oxford. At the Central Flying School at Upavon, where he gained his wings in December 1916, he was retained for four months as a flying instructor, which meant that he had accumulated significantly more than the standard flying experience when he was eventually posted to the western front.<br>
<br>In April 1917 Fullard joined 1 squadron at Ballieul in April 1917 to fly Nieuport fighters. Given command of C flight, he proved himself as a natural leader at a time when losses were high. In his first six weeks eighty-four pilots passed through the squadron, &#145;many of them not having unpacked their kit before they were casualties&#146;  (Staff College memoir, TNA: PRO, AIR 1/2387/228/11/4). His own growing personal score of enemy aircraft included one famous, but never officially confirmed, victim: Manfred von Richthofen (the Red Baron), whom he encountered rectifying a gun stoppage and shot down over Roulers, though von Richthofen was only wounded. He attributed the success of his flight&#151;every one of whose six members had at least five victories to his credit&#151;to teamwork.<br>
<br>After some dozen victories by mid-July 1917 Fullard was awarded the Military Cross for his &#145;fine leadership, great dash and determination to close with the enemy&#146;. Three weeks later, and after another ten or so victories, he received a bar to his MC for his &#145;utmost dash and fearlessness in attacking the enemy at close range [which have] in almost every instance resulted in disaster for the enemy&#146;. In mid-August, and still a twenty-year-old temporary captain, he was appointed DSO: &#145;As a patrol leader and scout pilot he is without equal. The moral effect of his presence in a patrol is most marked. He has now accounted for 14 machines destroyed and 18 driven down out of control in a little over four months.&#146; On one flight he damaged blood vessels in his eyes in a too rapid powered diving spin and he was rested&#151;but he rejoined his squadron in time for the opening of the battle of Passchendaele when ground strafing was added to the squadron's patrol and escort duties.<br>
<br>The highest ever scoring 1 squadron pilot, Fullard claimed a further eighteen victories after his DSO. He was recommended for a bar to his DSO but this, and a rumoured recommendation for a higher gallantry award, was rejected by higher authorities. Although the leader of a successful flight he was outspoken in criticizing elements of the offensive tactics ordered by the Royal Flying Corps's higher command, particularly if surprise was lost when aircraft repeatedly followed the same route returning from offensive action over enemy territory. Further, strafing enemy balloons resulted in the enemy loitering in the vicinity awaiting the British aircraft whose performance was, by the summer of 1917, becoming inferior to the newer German machines.<br>
<br>Playing football at Ballieul in November 1917 Fullard broke a leg, which required seven operations and the fitting of a metal plate. He later admitted that, after eight months of air fighting, his nerves had given way. He then spent ten months in hospital and convalescing. Out of the front line his name became overshadowed by those of his fellow air aces who achieved international fame. Promoted major but transferred to the new Royal Air Force in 1918 as a flight lieutenant, he carried out &#145;light duties&#146; as a flying examiner for the York, then Glasgow, areas. Although he was due to join an operational squadron in December 1918 the armistice intervened and he was given a staff job working on applications for commissions.<br>
<br>In 1919 Fullard raised funds for the victory loan in a tour of the western states of the USA, where large subscribers were promised introductions to air aces. On his return to London he joined 12 squadron, given the task of photographing the occupied areas of the Rhine. From June 1921 to May 1922 he was in Silesia as air adviser. In 1922 he joined 4 squadron monitoring Turkish activity around Chanak. After attending the RAF Staff College course at Andover in 1923 he toured the Baltic states and then spent five years in the Air Ministry directorate of operations and intelligence. In March 1929, and promoted squadron leader, he joined the air staff of Iraq command for two years before returning to England and, on 11 December 1931, marrying Pamela Gladys, the former wife of William McCargo Cross and the daughter of Arthur Hildebrand Ramsden-Tagore of Hassocks, Sussex.<br>
<br>Fullard then commanded 2 (army co-operation) squadron at Manston before completing the Army Staff College course at Quetta, India, in 1934. Commanding a detachment of 5 (army co-operation) squadron from Rawalpindi and attacking&#151;with 20 pound bombs and small-arms ammunition&#151;rebellious tribesmen during the Mohmand campaign in the north-west frontier, he was mentioned in dispatches. Promoted wing commander in 1936, he commanded 3 apprentice wing at the RAF School of Technical Training at Halton for two years before, in June 1938, joining the air staff of RAF Maintenance Command. His first marriage had ended by 1937 and, on 20 June 1939, he married Winifred Helen, the daughter of Frederick Simeons, merchant.<br>
<br>In 1939, as war again approached, Fullard was promoted group captain and commanded the component fighter group of the advanced air striking force of the British expeditionary force in France. He returned to England as senior air staff officer to 10 (fighter) group and was appointed CBE in January 1941; promoted air commodore in 1942, he was senior air staff officer at HQ Fighter Command. A year later he was sent to Lisbon to negotiate defence matters with the Portuguese government, particularly the allies' use of air bases in the Azores to fill the &#145;Atlantic gap&#146;.<br>
<br>Fullard retired from the RAF in November 1946 and took up a business career in the engineering industry, particularly with his firm Municipal Machinery Limited of Rochester. In spite of his fertile imagination, inventiveness, and energy, he never made the great fortune he often spoke of planning. He was slim and of medium height, the <span class="italic">Daily Mail</span> describing him in January 1918 as &#145;a fair, curly-haired, good-looking boy, clear-eyed and fresh complexioned with regular features&#146;. Like his father he was a keen philatelist; in later life his sport was skiing. One of the longest surviving air aces of the First World War, Fullard died of heart failure on 24 April 1984 at his home, Cardinal Lodge, Leybourne Road, Broadstairs, Kent, and was cremated.<br>
