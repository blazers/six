<span class="headword">Lewsham <span class="st"> [Newsham]</span>,  Amelia</span>  (<em>b. </em><em>c.</em>1748, <em>d.</em> in or after 1798), <span class="occ">white negress</span>, was born in Jamaica about 1748 to a black couple from whom she inherited a recessive gene causing albinism. She was described as being &#145;as fair as the fairest among the Europeans&#146;  (<span class="italic">The White Negro Girl</span>), although her features were those of her parents, of west African origin. Her mother was a house slave of Sir Simon Clarke, sixth baronet, who lived in Spanish Town. In 1753 Clarke sent her to England, to his son Kingsmill Clarke of the Inner Temple. He sold Amelia to John Bennett or Burnet, who kept a bird and beast shop off St Martin's Lane in London. Kingsmill Clarke asked for 400 guineas, although Amelia was probably bought for less. Amelia &#145;had the Honour to be shewn to the Royal Family, and to the Royal Society&#146;  (ibid.), as well as to ordinary people prepared to pay 1 shilling. She also toured the country and on 17 April 1766 was baptized in St Lawrence's, Exeter, Devon, under the name Amelia Harlequin. She believed, like many black people, that baptism made her free and at this point she left John Burnet to exhibit herself.<br>
<br>About this time Amelia married a Mr Lewsham or Newsham; she had at least six children with him. Shortly after Olaudah Equiano's return to London in 1777 he &#145;saw a remarkable circumstance &hellip; A white negro woman, that I had formerly seen in London and other parts, had married a white man, by whom she had three boys&#146;  (Equiano, 220). He probably saw Amelia and her children at Bartholomew fair, held annually at Smithfield on the northern edge of the City of London. She also attracted the attention of medical men and in 1788 the surgeon John Hunter commissioned a painter, probably Johann Zoffany, to do a portrait of what appears to be Amelia, her husband, and two of their children.<br>
<br>The last sighting of Amelia came on 1 May 1798, when she was taken before a justice of the peace in West Ham, Essex, because her appearance there the night before had caused a public disturbance. She was travelling and exhibiting herself with a man named James Briggs and her illegitimate son Christopher, born in Bristol and then about eight years old, which suggests that her husband was dead or the two had separated. The JP found that no law had been broken and sent the three on their way. What happened to her, or to any of her children, is not yet known.<br>
<br>For a &#145;curiosity&#146;, Amelia's career was relatively long. Whether she kept on exhibiting herself because she needed the money or because she enjoyed the attention is not known. Though to later generations it came to be seen as distasteful to display or gawk at physical peculiarities, it was not so in the eighteenth century. Amelia was described as a &#145;wonderful Phaenomenon of Nature&#146;  (<span class="italic">The White Negro Girl</span>). She and others like her were not regarded with revulsion or embarrassed pity, but as wonders and marvels. Moreover the alternative for Amelia was not appealing: had she not been born with albinism she would most likely have spent a much shorter life as a slave in Jamaica. Indeed her career perhaps helped her to live longer than she would have done had she remained in the tropics, where her lack of melanin would have made her vulnerable to skin cancer.<br>
