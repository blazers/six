<span class="headword">Shower,  John</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1657, <em>d.</em> 1715), <span class="occ">Presbyterian minister</span>, was born in the parish of St Kerrian, Exeter, and was baptized there on 18 May 1657, the second son of William Shower (<i>d</i>. 1661), a wealthy Exeter merchant, and his wife, Dorcas Anthony (<i>bap</i>. 1630), daughter of John Anthony. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25471/', "Sir Bartholomew Shower (1658&#150;1701)")</script>, recorder of London, was a younger brother. Shower's father died in 1661 but left his wife and children well provided for. Shower was encouraged in his studies by his mother and by his uncle Richard Down, who, following his ejection from the rectory of Winterborne Monkton, Dorset, became pastor to a congregationalist meeting at Bridport. He attended the school run at Exeter by Mr Bradford before entering, in 1671, the academy of Matthew Warren at Otterford, Somerset, with a view to entering the ministry. It was probably here that he acquired his belief in the free and critical study of the scriptures. Shower went on to study at Charles Morton's academy at Newington Green, Middlesex (where his fellow pupils were Daniel Defoe and Timothy Cruso), and completed his course of ministerial training at Edward Veal's academy in Wapping.<br>
<br>At the age of twenty, in 1677, Shower delivered his maiden sermon at Thomas Vincent's meeting-house in Hand Alley, Bishopsgate, London. His reputation as a preacher grew, and in the following year he became one of a group of evening preachers (who also included Theophilus Dorrington) at a merchant's lecture set up in the large room of a coffee house in Exchange Alley. He was ordained on 24 December 1679 by five ejected ministers, headed by Richard Adams. He at once became (while still retaining his lectureship) assistant to Vincent Alsop in Tothill Street, Westminster. In 1681 Shower published his first work, by far his most enduring and popular, <span class="italic">An Exhortation to Youth to Prepare for Judgement</span> (1681). This had reached its sixth edition by the time of his death thirty-four years later; the twentieth and last edition was published in 1826.<br>
<br>In 1683 Shower relinquished his posts when the whig politician Sir Samuel Barnardiston sent him abroad with two other young ministers as companions to his nephew Samuel Barnardiston. They made the grand tour, visiting France, Switzerland, Italy, and the Rhine. At Amsterdam in July 1684 they parted. Shower remained in the Netherlands until 1686. Having returned to England, he resumed his lecture at Exchange Alley, but the extreme pressure to which nonconformists were then subjected led him to return to the Netherlands in late 1686 or early 1687. He joined his fellow London Presbyterian minister John Howe at Utrecht. There he met and married, on 24 September 1687, Elizabeth Falkener (<i>d</i>. 1691), niece of the merchant and whig politician Thomas Papillon, and a fellow exile. They had three children but only the eldest, Ann, survived beyond infancy. At the end of 1687 Shower and his wife moved to Rotterdam, where for three years he served as evening lecturer in the Presbyterian Church of England, of which Joseph Hill was a pastor.<br>
<br>Shower returned to London upon receiving a call (19 January 1691) to succeed Daniel Williams as John Howe's assistant at Silver Street. Shower remained there for only a few months; on 8 May 1691 he accepted the call to replace Samuel Borfett as minister of the Presbyterian meeting at Curriers' Hall, Cripplegate. He retained this charge until his death, having been &#145;married&#146; to his flock by Matthew Mead, as Edmund Calamy put it  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>). His wife died later the same year, on 24 August. His funeral oration for her was published the following year under the title <span class="italic">The Mourning for the Dead</span>. On 29 December 1692 he married Constance White (<i>d</i>. 1701), daughter of an eminent London merchant. They had several children, but only three, Martha, Bartholomew, and John, survived their father.<br>
<br>The congregation at Curriers' Hall grew in numbers and in 1692 was obliged to move to more commodious accommodation in Jewin Street, where, his funeral sermon recorded, he &#145;continued his work in a very zealous, lively manner, with great diligence and remarkable success&#146;  (Tong, 63). When this also proved too small for the growing congregation a new meeting-house was erected in the Old Jewry in 1701, the required funds being raised by the merchants and shopkeepers who made up the congregation. Here Shower had one of the &#145;most considerable assemblies about the city&#146;  (ibid., 68), and Timothy Rogers and Joseph Bennet were successively appointed as his assistants.<br>
<br>Shower was elected a manager of the Common Fund in 1692, and was retained when, following the breakdown of relations with the Independents, it was reconstituted as the Presbyterian Fund in 1695. He was a member of a club of ministers in which Edmund Calamy was the leading spirit; for some years from 1692 it held weekly meetings at the house of Dr Upton in Warwick Lane. In 1697 Shower succeeded Samuel Annesley as one of the Tuesday lecturers at Salters' Hall.<br>
<br>Shower was a prolific writer of religious works, and the author of over twenty publications. Most of these were funeral sermons (he had the reputation of an emotional preacher), such as those for Mrs Mary Doolittle (1693), Nathaniel Oldfield (1697), Jane Papillon (1698), and Nehemiah Grew (1712). In 1693 he published a historical and providentialist account of earthquakes, <span class="italic">Practical Reflections on the Late Earthquakes</span>, stimulated by the destruction of Port Royal, Jamaica, the previous year. Among his other works were <span class="italic">Some Account of the Holy Life and Death of Mr Henry Gearing</span> (1694), <span class="italic">Winter Meditations</span> (1695), and <span class="italic">Serious Reflections on Time and Eternity</span> (1696).<br>
<br>Shortly after his move to Old Jewry, Shower's wife died in childbed on 18 July 1701, and on 7 December 1707 Ann, the daughter of his first marriage, suffered the same fate. Shower himself almost died in 1706, when &#145;seized by a very malignant fever&#146;  (Pike, 110). He never fully recovered and became increasingly frail, though John Fox, who visited him in 1712, was impressed by his &#145;state and pride&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>). On 14 September 1713 he suffered a stroke, and though he was able to preach again, he delivered his last sermon at Old Jewry on 27 March 1715. Less than three months later, on 12 June, he was &#145;seized with a nervous asthma&#146;  (Tong, 74). He died at his home in Stoke Newington, Middlesex, on 28 June, and was buried at Highgate on 7 July. His funeral sermon was preached by William Tong at the Old Jewry on 10 July 1715.<br>
