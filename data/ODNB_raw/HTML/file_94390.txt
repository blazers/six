<span class="headword">Potter,  Lynda  Lee-</span> <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Lynda Higginson]</span>  (1935&#150;2004), <span class="occ">journalist</span>, was born on 2 May 1935 at The Firs maternity home, Leigh, Lancashire, the daughter of Norman Higginson, a painter and decorator, of 76 Gordon Street, Leigh, and his wife, Margaret (Peggy), <i>n&eacute;e</i> Berry, who later ran a wallpaper and paint shop. She was educated at Leigh Girls' Grammar School, which she referred to as &#145;the escape route for ordinary children and the pathway to a new life&#146;. However, as she later made clear, the real architect of her escape from a working-class provincial northern background to join the metropolitan middle classes was her mother, who determinedly encouraged her only child to have &#145;ideas above my station&#146;  (Lee-Potter, 3).<br>
<br>Lynda Higginson's new life began at the age of eighteen when she obtained a place at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama, and began the process of social class transformation. She later wrote: &#145;I got on a train at Warrington Bank Quay Station with a Lancashire accent and got off at Euston without it&#146;  (Lee-Potter, 11). After graduating she adopted the stage name of Lynda Berrison and won a part in a Brian Rix farce, <span class="italic">Dry Rot</span>, at the Whitehall Theatre. Before going on tour with the play she met a medical student, Jeremy Patrick Lee-Potter (<i>b</i>. 1934), the son of Air Marshal Sir Patrick Lee Potter, and entered, by her own account, &#145;a different social milieu&#146;  (ibid., 19). He later became an eminent consultant haematologist, chairman of the British Medical Association (1990&#150;93) and deputy chairman of the General Medical Council's professional conduct committee. They married on 26 October 1957 and had a son and two daughters.<br>
<br>In 1961 Jeremy Lee-Potter was posted, as an RAF doctor, to Aden. It was there that Lynda Lee-Potter started her journalistic career, by contributing articles to the <span class="italic">Aden Chronicle</span> about life as an expatriate. On her return to England she wrote on a freelance basis for magazines, notably <span class="italic">Nova</span>, before taking a job with the <span class="italic">Woman's Mirror</span>. In 1967 she was hired by the <span class="italic">Daily Mail</span> as a feature writer. She had been on the paper for five years when she was asked by the editor, David English, to write a column. She later said: &#145;I went in and did it. Every week I thought somebody else would probably take over. But it's just carried on&#146;  (<span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span>, 21 Oct 2004). Her elevation had come about because the <span class="italic">Mail's</span> then celebrated female columnist, Jean Rook, left to join the rival <span class="italic">Daily Express</span>. English was outraged by Rook's desertion and was desperate to prove to Rook that she was not irreplaceable. According to a <span class="italic">Mail</span> colleague, Peter Black, English ruthlessly &#145;processed&#146; Lee-Potter's copy &#145;into a likeness of the strident Rook's&#146;  (Taylor, 70). But Lee-Potter proved more than equal to the task, becoming the voice of the <span class="italic">Daily Mail</span> by embodying English's vision of the ideal woman reader in a mythical middle England. The <span class="italic">Mail</span>'s historian, Sally Taylor, observed:<blockquote>In some guises she was the conscience of middle-class womanhood; in others a carping fishwife; in still others a highly sophisticated social commentator. It was a tribute to the flexibility of Lee-Potter's talent that she could carry out English's scenario without compromising her own creativity. (Taylor, 70)</blockquote>Indeed, though Rook was billed as &#145;the First Lady of Fleet Street&#146;, Lee-Potter secured the title for herself by eventually surpassing Rook's fame.<br>
<br>Lee-Potter's weekly page, with its highly opinionated mixture of commonsensical wisdom, candid criticisms (usually of celebrities), and moments of compassion, made her one of Britain's best-known journalists for more than three decades. She dismissed frequent accusations of bitchiness by remarking, with her trademark wide smile, &#145;I just write what I think&#146;. Her other great journalistic skill was as an interviewer of countless celebrities and politicians. She often elicited from interviewees all manner of headline-making indiscretions by drawing in her columnar claws to offer them a sympathetic ear. She was appointed OBE in 1998 and garlanded with journalistic awards, twice winning the accolade of columnist of the year, in 1984 and 2001, being named feature writer of the year twice, in 1987 and 1993, and woman writer of the year in 1989. In a profession dominated by the cult of youth, two qualities helped to maintain her longevity as a celebrity journalist. First, she regarded being a journalist as a privilege, retaining a youthful enthusiasm that few, if any, veteran hacks could match. Second, she viewed journalism as a trade rather than a profession, an activity requiring continual effort and thought.<br>
<br>Lee-Potter's belief in the virtues of hard work sprang from her appreciation of her mother's energetic approach to life, as she revealed in her only book, <span class="italic">Class Act: How to Beat the British Class System</span> (2000). The autobiographical sections charted her own climb up the British class ladder, even defending snobbery because it &#145;has certainly motivated me all my life&#146;  (Lee-Potter, 53). As one reviewer noted, Lee-Potter &#145;is both proud of being working-class and triumphant for having risen out of it, for what is snobbery but the entrepreneurial spirit?&#146;  (Maddox, 69). Lee-Potter died from a brain tumour on 20 October 2004 at her home, Icen House, Grange Road, Stoborough, Wareham, Dorset, and was cremated on 27 October. She was survived by her husband, Jeremy, and their three children, all of whom followed her into journalism.<br>
