<span class="headword">Taylor,  (Robert Murray) Ross</span>  (1932&#150;2003), <span class="occ">surgeon</span>, was born on 10 December 1932 in Calcutta, India, the son of George Ross Taylor, medical practitioner, and his wife, Helen Baillie, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Murray. There was a family tradition in medicine: his grandfather and three uncles were doctors. He was educated at Coatbridge secondary school, Lanarkshire, and went on to study medicine at Glasgow University, qualifying in 1956. After completing his house jobs in Ayrshire he spent the next two years in national service. He volunteered to join the Parachute regiment and following training he was attached first to the 23rd parachute field ambulance and then to the 2nd battalion of the Parachute regiment, serving with those units in Cyprus during the time of the EOKA insurrection and also in Jordan. On completing his national service he became a registrar in surgery at Bishop Auckland. On 7 January 1959 he married Margaret Rose Cutland, a 24-year-old schoolteacher from Ayrshire, daughter of Albert Henry Cutland, business agent. They had four children&#151;three daughters, Linda, Jill, and Anne, and a son, William (Bill).<br>
<br>Soon after his marriage Taylor joined the rotation at the Newcastle teaching hospital. He was not to leave Newcastle for the rest of his career. He became a registrar and a senior registrar in the training programme, but during this time he took a year away as a research fellow in the university department doing research work on transplantation, which gained him a master of surgery degree from the University of Glasgow. In 1964 he became a fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh and in 1965 a fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons of England. In 1970 he was appointed as a consultant surgeon and senior lecturer at the Royal Victoria Infirmary, and the University of Newcastle upon Tyne.<br>
<br>In 1973 Taylor took over the Newcastle renal (kidney) transplant programme as its director. By the time of his retirement in 1995 he had performed more than 2000 transplant operations, and had built up not only one of the major renal transplant programmes in the UK but a programme that was a leader in clinical and immunological transplantation research. The transplant unit trained a large number of transplant surgeons and Taylor personally supervised some fifteen research fellows, all of whom achieved a higher degree in transplantation research. At the time of his death five of the major transplant units in the UK were led by people he had trained.<br>
<br>Taylor's involvement in transplantation went beyond running the large clinical programme at Newcastle and encouraging and supervising research programmes. He became a very active fund-raiser for the unit. Always a keen cricketer and golfer, he took up long-distance running at the age of fifty and ran in four marathons, including the London marathon on three occasions, as well as innumerable half marathons, including the Great North Run on thirteen occasions. With sponsorship he raised over &pound;500,000 and this enabled the Northern Counties Kidney Research Fund to endow two clinical lectureships in transplantation at Newcastle. As a result of his enthusiasm for long-distance running he was invited by Brendan Foster to become a trustee of the Great North Run Charity, which allocated funds to projects in northern England both in medicine and in sport.<br>
<br>Taylor was a founder member of the International Transplantation Society, the British Transplantation Society, and the European Transplantation Society, and he was an outstanding president of the British Transplantation Society from 1986 to 1989. During that time the scandal of organs for sale in London emerged, and Taylor was closely involved with the General Medical Council in uncovering this activity. As a result of this he played a major part in drafting the <span class="roman">Human Organ Transplant Act</span> of 1987, which made the sale of human tissues illegal within the United Kingdom. Among his many other contributions outside clinical practice he helped to establish the Transplant Sports Association of Great Britain and chaired that organization for over twelve years. The association was responsible for organizing the Transplant games, in which transplant patients competed in a wide variety of sports and which soon became a well-established part of the public profile of transplantation in the UK. This was only one aspect of Taylor's continual efforts to increase organ donation. He also served as president of the North of England Surgical Society, chairman of the UK Transplant Multi-Organ Sharing Group, and a member of the UK Transplant Management Group. He was also founding chairman of the Transplant Patients' Trust, which provided financial support for families of transplant patients. He was awarded the McKeown gold medal of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh in 1989 and was made a CBE in 1997.<br>
<br>Ross Taylor was one of the pioneers of organ transplantation in the United Kingdom and during his career he became one of the most respected figures in the field. He was loved and respected by his patients and colleagues both far and wide. He was always considerate of others, advising his students: &#145;Treat your patients as you would wish members of your own family to be treated, and you will not go far wrong&#146;  (<span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span>, 8 Dec 2003). He died on 24 October 2003 at his home, 17 Apperley Road, Stocksfield, Northumberland, after a short illness, from cancer of the stomach. His funeral, at St George's Church, Jesmond, on 30 October, was attended by over 500 people from all over the country. He was survived by his wife, Margaret, and their four children.<br>
