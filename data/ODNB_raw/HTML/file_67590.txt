<span class="headword">Jopling <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Goode; <em>other married names </em>Romer, Rowe]</span>,  Louise Jane</span>  (1843&#150;1933), <span class="occ">portrait painter</span>, was born on 16 November 1843 at 10 Heath Field, Moss Side, Manchester, one of the nine children of Thomas Smith Goode, a railway contractor who held strict views on education, and his wife, Frances Wickstead Pinker. In 1861 at the age of seventeen she married Francis (Frank) Romer, secretary to Baron Nathaniel de Rothschild in Paris, and they had three children. Encouraged by the baroness, Louise Romer began to study art in Paris. Her classes at a state technical school and in Charles Chaplin's studio included anatomy and nude life study. In 1869, when her husband lost his appointment, she returned to London, where she attended Leigh's School of Art and led a fashionable life in London's artist community. Her friends included Frederick Leighton, Val Prinsep, and Kate Perugini. <span class="italic">Punch</span> published her first drawing, <span class="italic">A Sketch from Nursery History</span>, in 1869 as well as her journalism, poems, and stories. She separated from her husband, a compulsive gambler, in 1871, and returned to Paris for a brief period where she met the artists Alfred Stevens and James Tissot. Despite the deaths of Frank Romer (in 1873) and two of her children, her subject painting, for which friends modelled in Japanese robes, <span class="italic">Five O'Clock Tea</span>, was exhibited at the 1874 Royal Academy exhibition where it was well received and purchased by Agnews. That same year she married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15118/', "Joseph Middleton Jopling (1831&#150;1884)")</script>, a watercolour painter, and they had one son. Although he was a less successful painter than his wife, Joseph Jopling was superintendent of the fine arts for the Philadelphia International Exhibition in 1876 to which she sent <span class="italic">Five Sisters of York</span> based on Charles Dickens's novel <span class="italic">Nicholas Nickleby</span>. Sir Coutts and Lady Blanche Lindsay invited her to exhibit at the Grosvenor Gallery, London, from 1877 and, drawing in the fashionable society that attended exhibitions at the Grosvenor, she began to give preview exhibitions of her work in her studio. Her self-portrait from this year is now in Manchester City Galleries. Joseph Jopling introduced his wife to James MacNeill Whistler who painted her portrait, <span class="italic">Harmony in Flesh Colour &amp; Black: Portrait of Mrs Jopling</span> (1877; Hunterian Art Gallery, University of Glasgow). She was also a friend of John Everett and Effie Millais; Millais painted her portrait in 1879 (priv. coll.). Jopling produced many portraits of intelligent and fashionable women including <span class="italic">Phyllis</span> (1883, oil on canvas; formerly collection of Sir Merton and Lady Russell-Cotes, Bournemouth) and worked extensively in pastel; one of her few drawings of men is a portrait of the biographer Samuel Smiles (NPG). Her theatrical portraits included <span class="italic">Ellen Terry as Portia</span>, exhibited at the Grosvenor Gallery in 1883, and purchased by Sir Henry Irving for the Alhambra theatre. <span class="italic">Blue and White</span> (exh. RA, 1896; Lady Lever Art Gallery, Port Sunlight, Cheshire, repr. Lambourne, pl. 373) was purchased by W. H. Lever with the humorous intention that the graceful middle-class women washing blue china would advertise the benefits of Sunlight soap. (An advertising poster, entitled <span class="italic">Home Bright&#151;Hearts Light</span>, reproduced the painting and included on the table a packet of Sunlight soap.) Lionel Lambourne notes that Leverhulme saw &#145;its interest as a document in aesthetic taste&#146;  (Lambourne, 311). Joseph Jopling died in 1884 and in 1887 Louise married George William Rowe, a lawyer, and that year she set up a professional art school for women in Clareville Grove, London. The students were trained in perspective and anatomy, drawing, and painting from nature&#151;nude and clothed models, and casts&#151;and modelled in clay. In <span class="italic">Hints for Amateurs</span> (1891) she outlined basic techniques and materials for drawing, painting, photography, modelling, anatomy, colour, and perspective. Jopling was a member of the Society of Women Artists, the Pastel Society, and the Women's International Art Club. The Royal Society of Portrait Painters, founded in 1891, included a few women whose membership did not grant voting rights, so Jopling led a successful lobby that pressurized the society to reform. She was the first woman member of the Royal Society of British Artists in 1902 and a founder and president of the Society of Immortals. In 1889 Jopling signed the &#145;Declaration in favour of women's suffrage&#146;; she also supported the National Union of Women's Suffrage and signed a &#145;Letter from ladies to members of parliament&#146; (published in the <span class="italic">Woman's Suffrage Journal</span>, June 1885, 125), which highlighted the fact that male suffrage had initially been granted on the basis of property rights. She published <span class="italic">Poems</span> in 1913 and <span class="italic">T&ecirc;te &agrave; t&ecirc;te Bridge</span> in 1916; in 1925 her autobiography entitled <span class="italic">Twenty Years of my Life, 1867&#150;87</span> was published. Louise Jopling died on 19 November 1933 at her home, Manor Farm, Bois Common, Chesham Bois, Buckinghamshire.<br>
