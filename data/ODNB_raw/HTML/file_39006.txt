<span class="headword">Harrap,  George Godfrey</span>  (1868&#150;1938), <span class="occ">publisher</span>, was born on 18 January 1868 at 11 Woodville Grove, Islington, London, the son of Frederick James Harrap, a former warehouseman, and his wife, Jemima, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Godfrey. He was educated at West Ham model school, leaving at the age of fourteen with an already keen love of reading. His first post, which would endure for nineteen years, was an appointment as an assistant with the publishing house of Isbister &amp; Co. in Tavistock Street, Covent Garden, London, the office of <span class="italic">Good Words</span> and the <span class="italic">Sunday Magazine</span>. Here Harrap neglected no opportunity for improving on his somewhat scanty formal education, and secured early advancement into a field that provided opportunities for him to capitalize on his gifts as a lover of literature and as an enterprising businessman. Progress, however, did not keep pace with his ambition, and he was obliged to seek other outlets for his talents. He developed a particular interest in the educational publications of D. C. Heath &amp; Co. of Boston, Massachusetts, for whom Isbister were the London agents, and a personal friendship with Heath himself followed. This association enabled him to introduce Heath's books to English teachers. It was at about this time that Harrap also became London representative for the publishing house of Thomas Y. Crowell, New York.<br>
<br>On 6 September 1890 Harrap had married his first wife, Christine Mary Steward (1869&#150;1923), the daughter of the late Walter Steward, a timber merchant. The marriage took place at Stepney parish church, and the couple lived at 126 Carr Street, off Salmon Lane, Stepney, London. They had four children: George Steward Harrap, Walter Godfrey Harrap, Violet Christina Harrap, and Heath Stanley Harrap, this last named by way of compliment to D. C. Heath.<br>
<br>In 1901 Harrap started his own publishing business, concentrating at first on the production of modern language and other textbooks. The publication that year of Heath's <span class="italic">Practical French Grammar</span> gave a new direction to the teaching of French in Britain, and a general success in this field led to Harrap's decision to produce <span class="italic">Harrap's Standard French Dictionary</span>, the first volume of which, however, appeared only in 1934, fifteen years after its inception. The firm that subsequently bore his name, George G. Harrap &amp; Co. Ltd, came formally into being in 1905, when Harrap brought G. Oliver Anderson into partnership.<br>
<br>Christine Harrap died on 3 June 1923, and on 10 September 1935, at the church of All Souls, Langham Place, London, Harrap married his second wife, Jessie Marguerite Pittman, the widow of J. J. Pittman and daughter of the late Benjamin Addley Bourne. There were no children of this marriage. Harrap himself was now living at 29 Langham Street, in the West End of London, but the couple made their home at his new wife's house, Corner Cottage, Tadworth, Surrey.<br>
<br>Harrap retired from his now flourishing publishing business in the year of his second marriage, leaving an account of his venture in an autobiographical account, <span class="italic">Some Memories, 1901&#150;1935</span>. Another publication was <span class="italic">Love Lyrics from Five Centuries</span>, testifying to his fondness for foreign travel. Other interests, apart from books, which played as large a part in his domestic life as in his professional, were motoring and golf, the latter on a mostly modest scale. Harrap's convivial nature also brought him a wide circle of friends. He was a member of the Stationers' Company and the City Livery Club.<br>
<br>Following an operation to remove gallstones, George Harrap died on 29 October 1938 of bronchopneumonia at 20 Devonshire Place, London, apparently survived by his second wife. The publishing house founded by him was directed by the Harrap and Anderson families until 1971. Harrap's second son, Walter Godfrey Harrap (1894&#150;1967), joined his father's business in 1913 and became the firm's managing director in 1950. His grandson, Paull Harrap (1917&#150;1985), son of George's eldest son, George Steward Harrap, entered the family business in 1936 and became its chairman in 1971, on the retirement of Olaf Anderson.<br>
