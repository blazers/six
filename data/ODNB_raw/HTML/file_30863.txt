<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Brown,  Ivor John Carnegie</span>  (1891&#150;1974), <span class="occ">theatre critic and writer</span>, was born on 25 April 1891 in Penang, Malaya, the younger of the two sons of Dr William Carnegie Brown of Aberdeen, and his first wife, Jean Carnegie. His father, a graduate of Aberdeen University and an expert in tropical diseases, had a practice in the Federated Malay States, and Brown was sent to England to be educated at Suffolk Hall preparatory school and then, from 1902 to 1907, at Cheltenham College. After a year's private tuition by a crammer, he headed the scholarship list at Balliol College at Oxford and took a double first in classical honour moderations (1911) and <i>literae humaniores</i> (1913). He passed sixth into the civil service and was sent to the Home Office. There his career lasted two days, still a strong candidate for a Whitehall record. His first assignment was to minute an application by Staffordshire police for an increased provision of water-closets. He wrote his comments and walked out, thereafter to earn his living as a freelance writing about more interesting matters.<br>
<br>During the First World War Brown was a conscientious objector, and he hotly engaged in progressive politics. He lectured for the Oxford tutorial classes committee, published two ephemeral books of political theory and three novels, and wrote iconoclastic articles for the <span class="italic">New Age</span>. His versatile, profuse, and very fast pen fitted him exceptionally for journalism&#151;so in 1919 he joined the London office of the <span class="italic">Manchester Guardian</span>. There he wrote everything from editorials to colour pieces about sport; but particularly he wrote about the theatre, which became the master passion of his life. On 4 January 1916 he married Irene Gladys (<i>b</i>. 1891/2), the elder daughter of Bertha Posener and Carl Hentschel, a photo-engraver who made blocks for Fleet Street newspapers. She was a professional actress who became a successful director of plays, and her knowledge of the far side of the footlights enriched her husband's criticism. There were no children of the marriage.<br>
<br>Brown was drama critic for the <span class="italic">Saturday Review</span> from 1923 to 1930. In 1926 he was appointed Shute lecturer on the art of the theatre at Liverpool University. In 1929 he became theatre critic of <span class="italic">The Observer</span> and for the next thirty years, during a brilliant period of change and experiment on the London stage, he was the most influential and perceptive voice in British dramatic criticism. In 1939 he was made professor of drama to the Royal Society of Literature. When the Council for the Encouragement of Music and the Arts (CEMA; later the Arts Council) was set up during the Second World War, Brown was the obvious choice for its director of drama, a position he held in 1940&#150;42.<br>
<br>When J. L. Garvin retired from the editorship of <span class="italic">The Observer</span> in 1942, Brown was appointed to the post. He carried on as chief drama critic and managed also to make time to write regular leading and feature articles and, when the muse struck, elegant satiric verses. As editor he led <span class="italic">The Observer</span> with a light and liberal hand through the difficult wartime shortages of staff and newsprint. He put news on the front page, introduced new blood, broadened the paper's interests, changed its typography, and made it exceptionally well written. But as his own writing was the element in which he preferred to live, he resigned his editorship of the paper in 1948. He continued as drama critic until 1954, but after that devoted himself entirely to his own books.<br>
<br>Brown was among the most prolific and versatile writers of his generation, publishing more than seventy-five books, including novels, essays, biography, autobiography, criticism, coffee-table books, and even a light (and not very good) play. As well as using the English language expertly, he was one of those logophiles, such as F. G. Fowler, H. W. Fowler, and Eric Partridge, who are fascinated by language itself. He became famous for his books about words, agreeable rambles around correct usage and philology, enlivened by literary allusion, quotation, wit, and personal anecdote. He wrote thirteen of these in all, collecting words as others collect porcelain. In the first, <span class="italic">A Word in your Ear</span> (1942), he observed how gargantuan journalese was ruining such good old words as &#145;epic&#146;, &#145;odyssey&#146;, and &#145;tragedy&#146;. In <span class="italic">A Charm of Names</span> (1972) he explored the history of Christian or given names, from Abigail to Zuleika&#151;of course not forgetting his own name, Ivor. He was the most good-humoured of prescriptivists, but was still incorrigibly convinced that there existed such a thing as correct English, and that it was to be preferred to the other kind.<br>
<br>Shakespeare was another lifelong enthusiasm. Brown wrote a number of books about him full of amateur common sense and expert theatrical and linguistic wisdom. He was a very professional master of the English language and literature, happiest when writing, which he did very quickly while chewing the end of his handkerchief on the rare occasions when he was stuck for a word or an idea. He was a big, burly, shy man, full of Aberdonian <i>gravitas</i>, who could suddenly spark with a flash of frivolity or frolic.<br>
<br>Brown was chairman of the British Drama League from 1954 to 1965 and a fellow of the Royal Society of Literature, and was awarded the honorary degrees of LLD at St Andrews and Aberdeen universities (1950). After the war he lectured much in Denmark, which conferred on him a knighthood of the order of Dannebrog. In 1957 he was appointed CBE. Ivor Brown died in London on 22 April 1974.<br>
