</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Cogan,  Thomas</span>  (1736&#150;1818), <span class="occ">physician</span>, was born on 8 February 1736 at Rowell (Rothwell), Northamptonshire, the second of the four children of John Cogan, surgeon and apothecary (1698&#150;1784), who came from a Somerset family, and his first wife, Martha Morrice, of Lukenham, Leicestershire. Thomas's half-brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5811/', "Eliezer Cogan")</script>, was the son of John Cogan and his second wife. Raised as a Congregationalist, Thomas attended John Aikin's dissenting school at Kibworth Beauchamp, Leicestershire, for two or three years, before returning home at fourteen. Two years later, intending to become a minister, he joined the dissenting academy at Mile End, Middlesex, where Dr John Conder was divinity tutor; dissatisfied with the conduct of the institution, he left for the dissenting academy at Hoxton. In 1759, while in Harwich, he visited Rotterdam, where he obtained a preacher's post at the Presbyterian church, deputizing for the Revd Benjamin Sowden, and acting in conjunction with his colleague, the Revd Thomas Pierson, until 1760. In 1762 and 1763 Cogan walked the hospitals in London and exercised his ministry in Southampton, but alienated his congregation by his open rejection of the strict Calvinist beliefs currently maintained by orthodox Congregationalists: predestination and eternal damnation were incompatible with his belief in a God whose leading attribute was love, not power. Cogan adopted doctrines associated with Unitarianism, but although for most of his life he passed, and wished to pass, as a Unitarian, his love of truth for its own sake prevented his total acceptance of any human doctrine.<br>
<br>Cogan returned to the Netherlands as junior minister in the English church at The Hague. He married Johanna Maria Groen (<i>d</i>. 1810), a wealthy Amsterdam merchant's beautiful young daughter, who brought him a fortune of &pound;8000 or &pound;10,000. It was a condition of the marriage that Cogan was to take up the profession of medicine, and after a short visit to England, where he delivered a few well-received sermons, he matriculated at the University of Leiden on 16 October 1765, graduating MD on 20 February 1767 with his thesis, &#145;Specimen medicum inaugurale de animi pathematum vi et modo agendi in inducendis vel curandis morbis&#146;. His fundamentally optimistic view of the universe found congenial matter in his translation, from the French of John Bruckner, of <span class="italic">A philosophical survey of the animal creation, an essay, wherein the general devastation and carnage that reign among the different classes of animals are considered in a new point of view; and the vast increase of life and enjoyment derived to the whole from this institution of nature is clearly demonstrated</span> (1768).<br>
<br>In 1769 Cogan bought Cowleys and Sanders Down, Middlesex. He practised medicine successively at Amsterdam, Leiden, and Rotterdam, specializing in midwifery, before moving to Paternoster Row, London, where he had an extensive and lucrative midwifery practice. On 29 June 1772 he and his wife went through a marriage service at the church of St Laurence Pountney, London, presumably to conform with contemporary English law, which would not have recognized a marriage in a dissenting church.<br>
<br>In 1773 Cogan published the <span class="italic">Memoirs of the Society Instituted at Amsterdam in Favour of Drowned Persons</span>, adapted from the original Dutch, in which he encouraged the English to follow Amsterdam's example. He supplemented this work with observations, drawn from his own experience, on the successful mouth-to-mouth resuscitation of stillborn babies. Just as it was ready for the press, a more wide-ranging work on resuscitation, making similar proposals, was published by Alexander Johnson (1716&#150;1799). Cogan acknowledged Johnson's priority in a prefatory &#145;Advertisement&#146;, but justified his own publication on the grounds that &#145;the Memoirs of the Society, intermixed with the cases, will not only be amusing, but will excite us to imitate their example more effectually than the mere narration of facts, however extraordinary they may be&#146;.<br>
<br>In 1774 Cogan joined William Hawes to form the institution destined to become the Royal Humane Society. He wrote the first six years' reports, and relieved the solemnly sentimental atmosphere of the society's annual fund-raising festivals by singing a song of his own composition, with the old and popular chorus of<blockquote>
<div>And a begging we will go, will go, and a begging we will go.<br>
</div>
</blockquote>His lighter literary talents also appeared in the anonymously published and underrated <span class="italic">John Buncle, Junior, Gentleman</span> (1775&#150;6), the purported memoir of the youngest son of the hero of Thomas Amory's eccentric Unitarian romance, <span class="italic">The History of John Buncle</span> (1755). It contains telling parodies of the fashionable sentimental style, and Letter 18, &#145;An Invitation to Town, in Pastoral Verse&#146;, vividly describes the joys and inconveniences of London life.<br>
<br>In 1780, satisfied with the wealth he had acquired, and suffering from a suspected liver complaint, Cogan returned to the Netherlands with his wife, resigning his practice to John Simms. Cogan was able to enjoy more than three years of philosophical study and pastoral tranquillity in the splendid mansion of Zuylestein, near Utrecht. He visited Germany, his tour forming the basis of <span class="italic">The Rhine, or, A journey from Utrecht to Francfort, described in a series of letters in 1791 and 1792</span> (1793). He utilized his linguistic and medical knowledge in his translation, <span class="italic">The works of the late Professor Camper, on the connexion between the science of anatomy and the arts of drawing, painting, statuary, &hellip;</span> (1794).<br>
<br>The French revolutionary army's invasion of the Netherlands drove Cogan and his wife back to England in 1795; they landed at Harwich and spent some time in Colchester, ready to return to the Netherlands. Eventually, realizing that Dutch liberation was not imminent, they settled in Bath, accompanied by Mrs Cogan's niece, Mary Elizabeth Gurnault. They lived in Argyle Street, opposite William Jay's Independent chapel, which Cogan attended in the evening, after mornings at the Unitarian church. They subsequently moved to Widcombe Crescent. Cogan founded the Bath Humane Society in 1805. He devoted much energy to religious and philosophical writings, arguing that relationships between God, man, mind, body, the individual, and the universe were harmonious, beneficent, and susceptible to rational analysis. His most widely circulated work was <span class="italic">Letters to William Wilberforce on the Doctrine of Hereditary Depravity, by a Layman</span> (1799), defending human virtue and divine benevolence. Characteristically, he retained his personal admiration for Wilberforce, who deemed Cogan a fair and able disputant.<br>
<br>Cogan's main work was a series of treatises on the passions. These were <span class="italic">A Philosophical Treatise on the Passions</span> (1800), <span class="italic">An Ethical Treatise on the Passions</span> (part 1, 1807; part 2, 1810), and <span class="italic">Theological Disquisitions on Religion as Affecting the Passions and on the Characteristic Excellencies of Christianity</span> (2 vols., 1812&#150;13). All five treatises were published as a set entitled <span class="italic">A Treatise on the Passions and Affections of the Mind</span> in 1813. Cogan's remorseless application of human reason to subjects often regarded as divine mysteries, his denial of the devil's existence, and his use of humour caused offence to more orthodox friends. To protect their sensibilities, Cogan restrained himself at first, but his expressions became more uncompromising, culminating in his assertion that, if any human being were condemned to eternal torment, &#145;then is the propagation of the human species to be placed among the most atrocious of crimes&#146;  (1813, 5.406). His last publication was <span class="italic">Ethical Questions</span> (1817); he bequeathed his manuscripts, including unpublished works, to his half-brother, Eliezer.<br>
<br>Cogan's lifelong interests were travel, literature, and agriculture. This last prompted him to take a farm at South Wraxall, Wiltshire; he joined the West of England Agricultural Society, winning several of its prizes for experimental farming. Cogan continued this pursuit in subsequent moves to Clapton, Somerset, and Woodford, Devon, and at his death held a small farm near Southampton. He said farming was &#145;never profitable, except the farmer drive the plough, his wife be dairy-maid and his children scarecrows&#146;. Nevertheless, he took a continuing interest in the subject, bequeathing to John Dowley his &#145;large and small drill dibbling Machines&#146;, with advice to &#145;persevere in my plan of Husbandry until in the eyes of the judicious it shall be confuted or established&#146;. In 1806 he was awarded a gold medal by the Society of Arts for his invention of a drag for raising bodies for persons who have sunk under water. Johanna Cogan died in 1810 and was buried at the church of St Thomas &agrave; Becket, Widcombe, Somerset, on 29 May. Cogan left for London with Miss Gurnault, who died shortly afterwards. He passed the rest of his life migrating between London, Bath, and Southampton.<br>
<br>On 31 December 1817 Cogan walked out from his lodgings at Henrietta Street, Covent Garden, London, into a very thick fog; this brought on an unusually troublesome cough, with complications. Believing he would not recover, he went to Eliezer's house at Higham Hill, Walthamstow, where he died on 2 February 1818. At his own request, he was buried on 9 February in the vault of the New Gravel Pit Unitarian Chapel burial-ground, Hackney, beside Miss Gurnault.<br>
<br>Cogan's estate was worth &pound;14,000; he left &pound;100 to the Royal Humane Society, one of whose gold medals is inscribed to his memory. He was of short stature, and stout in middle age. Despite a lifelong tendency to pulmonary complaints, he was very strong; at eighty he could make children admire his agile backward skipping with a rope. Although habitually neat, he dressed less formally than was customary for English physicians, looking more like a gentleman, or a Dutchman. Though his vivacity and terse, epigrammatic conversation enlivened all who enjoyed his society, he invariably claimed that through life he had been grave for himself, and cheerful for his friends; to most contemporaries, his outstanding characteristic was benevolence.<br>
