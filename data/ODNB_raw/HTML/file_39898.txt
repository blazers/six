<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Blowitz,  Henri Georges Stephan Adolphe Opper  de</span>  (1825&#150;1903), <span class="occ">journalist</span>, was born at Blovice in the Plze&#328; district of Bohemia, on 28 December 1825, the elder son of Marc Opper or Oppert, a tradesman, and Anne Hartmann. The exact circumstances of his early life are uncertain; the account that he dictated for his posthumously published <span class="italic">Memoirs</span> (1903) was deliberately designed to hide his humble origins. Government records confirm that in 1847 he was living in France where, for twelve years, he taught German at various lyc&eacute;es. He did not become a naturalized French citizen until 1870. In 1859 he married a rich widow, Anne-Am&eacute;lie Bethfort (1814&#150;1893), daughter of a naval paymaster, distantly related through her mother to the royal house of Bourbon. To make himself appear more acceptable to his wife's family, Blowitz abandoned Judaism for Roman Catholicism and added his birthplace to his surname. His wife was tall and handsome; Blowitz was extremely short and corpulent. His large, bald head he complemented with extravagant thickets of side-whiskers and moustaches; his singular appearance was further exaggerated by an ostentatious taste in clothes. <i>Tout ensemble</i>, Blowitz inspired humour more readily than thoughts of romance, yet he enjoyed a considerable reputation as a <i>coureur</i>. He admitted, in his fractured English: &#145;All women fell to me for love&#146;  (Giles, 27), but he never wavered in his admiration for his &#145;madonna&#146;, Anne-Am&eacute;lie. They made an incongruous-looking couple, but theirs was a remarkably happy marriage; their only child, Stephan Lauzanne, was adopted.<br>
<br>Blowitz's first essay into journalism was in the local <span class="italic">Gazette de Midi</span> in 1866. The permanent change from idle <i>rentier</i> to journalist was prompted by events in the winter of 1870&#150;71. How exactly he became a friend of Louis Thiers remains a mystery, but it was the politician probably who recommended Blowitz as an assistant to <span class="italic">The Times</span>'s Paris correspondent. Within four years, the diminutive, audacious opportunist had succeeded to <span class="italic">The Times</span>'s most prestigious foreign posting. Reservations about Blowitz's suitability had been totally disarmed by his interview of Alfonso XII of Spain, described by J. T. Delane, the editor, as a &#145;really masterly stroke&#146;  (Blowitz, 99). Blowitz gathered news assiduously, always with an eye to his readers' pleasure. This delighted J. C. MacDonald, manager of <span class="italic">The Times</span>, who particularly valued the little man's talent for blurring the distinction between authorized and unauthorized, real and fictitious, and the glittering style that converted the dullest official communiqu&eacute; into the stuff of Ruritanian romance. Blowitz became part of the history he chronicled with inexhaustible fluency. As a contemporary <i>aper&ccedil;u</i> acknowledged: &#145;Il n'y a d&eacute;cid&eacute;ment que deux hommes en Europe, Bismarck et Blowitz&#146;.<br>
<br>In his <span class="italic">Memoirs</span> Blowitz stated that, in 1875, he had prevented war between Germany and France. This is an example of his imagination overtaking accuracy. He liked to place himself at the centre of important events, a foible so widely recognized that <span class="italic">Punch</span> dubbed him &#145;Blowitz-own-Trumpet&#146;. The 1878 Berlin Congress was, however, an undoubted personal triumph. To London he sent a stream of stories about the personalities and the progress of events, and by an amazing coup succeeded in telegraphing the exact terms of the treaty to <span class="italic">The Times</span> to appear on the day it was signed in Berlin. For services rendered, Blowitz received from France advancement in the L&eacute;gion d'honneur from chevalier to officier; from Germany, a decoration, third class. But the honour Blowitz valued most was an interview with Bismarck; thereafter he referred frequently to his supposed intimacy with the Iron Chancellor. Often reminiscing in print: &#145;Let me recall what Prince Bismarck said to me &hellip;&#146;, Blowitz was denigrated in the controlled German press as a troublemaker, and his reports dismissed as &#145;Munchausen stories&#146;, the &#145;crazy inventions of a scandal monger&#146;. Blowitz did nothing to dissuade Bismarck that &#145;Herr Oppert aus Blowitz&#146; was entirely responsible for how <span class="italic">The Times</span> viewed European affairs. Indeed, throughout the 1880s Blowitz effectively was a one-man foreign department. His regular European-wide surveys he based on information supplied by friends and contacts in every European capital. His privilege was to write when and what he pleased knowing that he would always have the support of his editor.<br>
<br>Blowitz was a generous host. His Paris apartment was invariably crowded with distinguished guests drawn from all walks of life. An informed, brilliant conversationalist, he was welcomed in every leading Paris salon. A polished <i>boulevardier</i>, he was the essential constituent of any significant social, literary, or theatrical gathering. No important private view, premi&egrave;re, or reception was complete without the <i>ambassadeur du Times</i>. Blowitz insisted that the endless whirl of his social life was essential grist to his journalistic mill. To profession and employers alike, he always showed the highest degree of fidelity. He was not without faults as a journalist; he could be touchy, impudent, vulgar, and pushing. But he was never a moral coward, and any cause in which he believed, no matter how unpopular, he advocated fearlessly and consistently. He was a doughty Dreyfusard and a tireless, lifelong supporter of the house of Orl&eacute;ans. He was obliged to write his dispatches in French, but if his grasp of English was always uncertain, no one was a greater Anglophile.<br>
<br>From J. C. MacDonald's death in 1889, Blowitz's influence at <span class="italic">The Times</span> slowly declined, a process hastened by Sir Donald Mackenzie Wallace's appointment to lead a newly constituted foreign department. Wallace, sober of demeanour and conservative of taste, a diplomat rather than a journalist, intensely disliked Blowitz's sensationalism. In September 1895 he wrote to the Paris correspondent: &#145;Your great journalistic talent &hellip; unfortunately &hellip; does not easily accommodate itself to &hellip; the style of <span class="italic">The Times</span> &hellip; in which each worker strives to sink his own personality in the collective personality of the paper&#146;  (<span class="italic">History of The Times</span>, 3.139). Wallace might as well have expected a peacock to masquerade as a sparrow as to suppose that Blowitz might modify his style. Instead, copy from Blowitz was altered, reduced, even ignored, without reference to the author. His coups were dismissed variously as &#145;too credulous&#146;, &#145;indiscreet&#146;, or, &#145;<i>jeux d'esprit</i> of questionable taste&#146;  (ibid., 3.136). Wallace's all-important ally in muzzling Blowitz was C. F. Moberly Bell. Both men were convinced that the Blowitz style of journalism was outdated. Nevertheless, the old man stubbornly clung to his post until increasing frailty finally undermined his resolve and, most unwillingly, he accepted retirement at the end of 1902. Blowitz was spared the final indignity of seeing William Lavino replace him as Paris correspondent, that post for which he still supposed himself uniquely best fitted. On 18 January 1903, he died from peritonitis, at 2 rue Greuze, Paris; he was buried at Boulogne-sur-Seine. No journalist had been more written about in his lifetime by fellow journalists. His coups inspired awe, but also spite and professional jealousy. At his death, the world's press united to compliment the little correspondent who had towered over his profession. <span class="italic">The Times</span> declared him &#145;unique&#146;; <span class="italic">Punch</span> extolled him as &#145;a prince of correspondents&#146; who was &#145;without peer&#146;. &#145;The king of interviewers&#146;, pronounced the <span class="italic">Journal de Bruxelles</span>; and none disagreed with the <span class="italic">New York Evening Post</span>'s accolade that Blowitz had been &#145;the last of the great correspondents of the old school&#146;  (Giles, preface). Blowitz was all these things, and more. He was a legend in his own lifetime.<br>
