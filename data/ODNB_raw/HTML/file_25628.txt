<span class="headword">Sinclair,  John</span>  (1791&#150;1857), <span class="occ">singer</span>, was born on 9 December 1791 near Edinburgh, the son of David Sinclair, a cotton spinner. He joined the band of Campbell of Shawfield's regiment as a clarinettist, and went to Aberdeen. There he taught singing until he was able to buy his discharge. As he liked the stage and had a fine tenor voice, he went to London to look for work, and on 7 September 1810 appeared at the Haymarket Theatre as Captain Cheerly in William Shield's <span class="italic">Lock and Key</span>. After this he became a pupil of Thomas Welsh and was engaged for seven years at Covent Garden, where he created the tenor roles in Henry Bishop's <span class="italic">Guy Mannering</span> (1816) and <span class="italic">The Slave</span> (1816), John Davy's <span class="italic">Rob Roy</span> (1818), and other works. He was the first to sing Bishop's song &#145;The Pilgrim of Love&#146;, and he was very popular as Apollo in <span class="italic">Midas</span>. In 1816 Sinclair married a daughter of Captain Norton. One of his daughters, Caroline, was married to the American tragedian Edwin Forrest.<br>
<br>Sinclair went to Paris in 1819 and had lessons from Giulio Pellegrini, then travelled to Milan, where he studied with Davidde Banderali at the conservatory. In May 1821 he sang to Rossini at Naples, and had some lessons from him, and in 1822&#150;3 appeared in opera at Pisa, Bologna, Genoa, Modena, Florence, and elsewhere. At Venice in 1823 Rossini wrote for him the part of Idreno in <span class="italic">Semiramide</span>.<br>
<br>By the time Sinclair returned from Italy to England, his voice had greatly improved, and he appeared at Covent Garden on 19 November 1823 as Prince Orlando in T. J. Dibdin's comic opera <span class="italic">The Cabinet</span>. From 1828 to 1829 he was engaged at the Adelphi, and from 1829 to 1830 at Drury Lane, and after a short visit to America in 1830&#150;1, where he sang in New York and Philadelphia, he retired to Margate. He was director of the Tivoli Gardens there until his death, in Margate, on 23 September 1857.<br>
<br>Sinclair's voice was a pure tenor, with an unusually fine falsetto, but his style was a little effeminate, and he was known as &#145;the leddies' bonnie Sinclair&#146;. He was one of the earliest performers of Scottish song. He composed a number of songs, including &#145;Come, sit ye doon&#146;, &#145;The Bonnie Breast Knots&#146;, &#145;The Mountain Maid&#146;, &#145;Johnny Sands&#146;, and others in the Scottish style, all of which were very popular.<br>
