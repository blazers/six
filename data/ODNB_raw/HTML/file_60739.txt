<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Bailey, Sir  Harold Walter</span>  (1899&#150;1996), <span class="occ">Indo-Iranian scholar and philologist</span>, was born on 16 December 1899 at 54 Northgate Street, Devizes, Wiltshire, one of three sons of Frederick Charles Bailey, labourer, and his wife, Emma Jane, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Richardt. When he was ten his parents moved to Australia to a farm, Glen Wood, Nangeenan, Western Australia, and it was in the unpromising conditions of the outback, which ruled out formal secondary education, that his interest in languages was first stimulated by a chance collection of books, later described by him to Arnold Toynbee as:<blockquote>a set of seven volumes of an encyclopaedia (eagerly devoured) and four other volumes with lessons in French, Latin, German, Greek, Italian, and Spanish. Later came Arabic and Persian, out of which Persian took the lead (joined later to Sanskrit). (Toynbee, 16)</blockquote>Thus began the fascination with Iran which, nurtured by his study of Avestan grammar in the intervals of farm work, led him in 1922 to the University of Western Australia, Perth, to read classics (in the absence of any provision for oriental studies) and subsequently to write a thesis on Euripides, for which he was awarded an MA in 1927. In the latter year he won the Hackett studentship to Oxford University where, as a member of St Catherine's Society, he studied under F. W. Thomas and was awarded a first in oriental languages in 1929.<br>
<br>In 1929 Bailey was appointed as the first lecturer in Iranian studies (a post financed by the Parsi community of Bombay) at the School of Oriental Studies, London. At the same time, for his doctoral thesis, he embarked on the study of a major Zoroastrian text, the <span class="italic">Bundahi&#353;n</span> (&#145;Primal creation&#146;), a kind of encyclopaedia of Zoroastrianism written in Pahlavi, for which&#151;although it was incomplete&#151;he was awarded his Oxford DPhil in 1933. Learning that the Danish scholar Kaj Barr was working on the same material and preparing to have it published, with characteristic generosity Bailey handed over his own materials to Barr (who died in 1970 without completing an edition); much later in his life Bailey returned to his edition of the <span class="italic">Bundahi&#353;n</span>, which was completed in 1989 but remains unpublished, partly because his insertion by hand of words in Pahlavi script into the copy intended for photographic reproduction rendered it partially illegible. His output in this period was already substantial: over twenty articles, mostly on Middle Iranian and Avestan problems, between 1930 and 1935.<br>
<br>In 1936 Bailey was elected to the chair of Sanskrit at Cambridge and became a fellow of Queens' College, living in the college until his retirement in 1967; he was not primarily a Sanskritist but the Cambridge chair gave him the freedom to pursue his Iranian studies. In the same year he delivered the Ratanbai Katrak lectures at Oxford, which were published as <span class="italic">Zoroastrian Problems in the Ninth-Century Books</span> (1943; 2nd edn, 1971) and which rank among his most important publications, helping to give the field of Old and Middle Iranian studies a new direction. By then he was already engaged in the study of Khotanese, the Middle Iranian language of Khotan in Chinese Turkestan, which was to occupy the major part of his immense scholastic energies over nearly half a century, resulting in the publication of five volumes of Khotanese texts in facsimile, two volumes of text, translation, and commentary, five volumes of text alone, and an etymological dictionary (<span class="italic">Dictionary of Khotan Saka</span>, 1979), as well as two further books and numerous articles. He was the pioneer in the study of this material, bringing to it great skill in reading the cursive script of the late Khotanese texts, unrivalled familiarity with the literatures of the region, and encyclopaedic knowledge of other Iranian and Indo-European languages (as well as knowledge of Chinese, Tibetan, and Turkish&#151;over fifty languages in all). He started work on Khotanese in the hope that it would shed light on the <span class="italic">Bundahi&#353;n</span> (a hope not realized) but by publishing the entire Khotanese material, which had been acquired for the British Museum as a result of Sir Aurel Stein's central Asian expeditions, he inaugurated a whole new field within Iranian studies. He claimed not to be religious but his sympathy with the Zoroastrian and Buddhist texts that he studied was notable.<br>
<br>Though wedded to his Iranian studies and following a simple lifestyle (he was a vegetarian and near teetotaller), Bailey had other diversions in his life, enjoying until his mid-fifties walking or cycling holidays (his athleticism was revealed in his tall, slim figure), playing the violin in a chamber group which quite often met in his rooms at Queens' College, and later in life taking up gardening enthusiastically. His scholastic interests, too, extended widely, including for example the study of varieties of spoken Welsh in remote villages, a study pursued to such effect that Sir Ralph Turner, the director of the School of Oriental and African Studies, recorded how he was visited by Bailey while on holiday in Wales, and Bailey talked so knowledgeably about Welsh language and history that one of those present afterwards remarked that he did not know that Cambridge had a chair of Celtic  (Sims-Williams and Hewitt, 113). Similarly, Bailey's enthusiasm for the languages and literatures of the Caucasus (in particular the Armenian, Georgian, and Ossetic epics) enabled him on a visit to the area in 1966 to astonish his audience by addressing them in both dialects of Ossetic; this resulted in his being presented with a full Osset costume, in which he was later painted for a portrait commissioned by his college from Ronald Way. His extraordinarily wide scholarly interests went hand in hand with an exceptional capacity to shut everything else out when he was busy writing.<br>
<br>Bailey's erudition received due recognition over the years. He became a fellow of the British Academy in 1944 and was subsequently a corresponding member of the Danish, Norwegian, and Swedish academies, the Australian Academy of the Humanities, the Institut de France, the Acad&eacute;mie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres, and the Istituto Italiano per il Medio ed Estremo Oriente. He was knighted in 1960 for services to oriental studies, and received honorary degrees from Oxford, Manchester, Western Australia, and the Australian National University. He was president of the Philological Society (1948&#150;52) and of the Royal Asiatic Society (1964&#150;7), among others; a complimentary volume of the <span class="italic">Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies</span> (33, 1970) included a bibliography of his 162 publications until then. He was a founder member of the Ancient India and Iran Trust in 1978, donating to it his vast library, and he helped to purchase Brooklands House in Cambridge as its base, living there himself and being active in the improvement of its garden. In his later years he suffered from failing eyesight, and active research became increasingly difficult; nevertheless, he was able to maintain contacts on a personal level&#151;in part through the trust&#151;with his many friends and colleagues, and clearly valued the opportunity to put his great store of knowledge at the service of others. He died on 11 January 1996 in Cambridge; a memorial service was held in Queens' College on 9 March 1996. He was unmarried. He was the most outstanding British Iranianist of the twentieth century; indeed, some have held that he was the greatest scholar of Queens' College since Erasmus.<br>
