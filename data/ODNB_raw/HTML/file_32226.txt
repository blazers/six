<span class="headword">Buzzard, Sir  (Edward) Farquhar</span>, first baronet  (1871&#150;1945), <span class="occ">physician</span>, was born in Grosvenor Street, London, on 20 December 1871, the eldest of four sons (there were two daughters) of Thomas Buzzard (1831&#150;1919), an eminent neurologist, and his wife, Isabel (<i>d</i>. 1901), daughter of Joseph Wass of Lea, Derbyshire. He was educated at Charterhouse School from 1885 and won a scholarship to Magdalen College, Oxford. He excelled in lawn tennis and football. He played for the university (1893&#150;4) and for the Old Carthusian eleven, winners of the amateur cup (1894, 1897), the London senior cup (1895&#150;7), and the London charity cup (1896). After obtaining a fourth class in natural science (physiology) in 1894, he completed his medical training at St Thomas's Hospital, London, where he won the Mead medal in 1898. In 1899 he married May (<i>d</i>. 1951), a musician, the daughter of Edward Bliss of Edgbaston, Birmingham. They had two sons and three daughters; the younger son and eldest daughter also became doctors.<br>
<br>Following in his father's footsteps Buzzard went to the National Hospital for Nervous Diseases at Queen Square, London, acting first as house physician to his father's close colleague, J. Hughlings Jackson; later he became assistant physician, a post he held from 1905 to 1922. In 1903 he became assistant physician to the Royal Free Hospital, London, and he was later full physician and lecturer in medical pathology. By 1910 he had made his reputation, having secured his fellowship of the Royal College of Physicians in 1906 and having delivered the Goulstonian lectures of 1907, &#145;Toxic and infectious diseases of the nervous system&#146;; he had also succeeded to appointments at other London hospitals, including the Queen Alexandra Military Hospital, the Royal Hospital for Incurables, the Throat Hospital, Golden Square, and the Belgrave Hospital for Children. In 1910 he returned to St Thomas's Hospital as a visiting physician, and he remained there until 1928, when he became consulting physician. During the First World War he was consultant to the London command, rising to the rank of colonel, during which time he helped to enlarge the understanding of &#145;shell shock&#146;.<br>
<br>Although he made no important discoveries, Buzzard surpassed his father in extending knowledge of neurology. He produced many publications but these were mostly in the form of contributions to textbooks, the chief being <span class="italic">Pathology of the Nervous System</span>, written in 1921 with J. G. Greenfield. Because of the many calls upon his time, original work was abandoned, and he devoted fewer hours to hospital work than his colleagues desired; nevertheless, his clinical opinion was greatly valued, and he excelled by his knowledge and judgement. He was less successful as a teacher: &#145;Buzzard was usually silent, and his ward teaching was reduced to the essentials of diagnosis&#146;  (Munk, <span class="italic">Roll</span>). This &#145;contrasted with the polished fluency of his prepared public disquisitions&#146;  (ibid.). Students found him awe-inspiring and ponderous. At the Royal College of Physicians he was made councillor (1922&#150;3), censor (1923&#150;4, 1927), and representative on the General Medical Council (1927&#150;9). He was the Lettsomian (1926), Maudsley (1932), and Earl Grey memorial (1939) lecturer. His appointment as physician-extraordinary to King George V in 1923 was followed by his becoming KCVO in 1927, and he was created a baronet in 1929. The pinnacle of his career came when he was appointed regius professor of medicine at the University of Oxford, in 1928.<br>
<br>The Oxford appointment was a turning point in Buzzard's career. Despite his conventional background and manner Buzzard turned out to be &#145;a consistent ally of innovation and reform&#146;  (Webster, 322). As a member of Huntercombe Golf Club Buzzard was one of the group of medical men who had access to Sir William Morris, later Lord Nuffield. With the generous support of Nuffield, to whom he acted as doctor, friend, and adviser, Buzzard did much to further the cause of British medicine. His main aim was to develop a medical school devoted to clinical as well as to laboratory research. This was realized with the creation of the Nuffield Institute for Medical Research in 1936, and the enlargement of the Oxford medical school thereafter.<br>
<br>Buzzard also played a part in the process that led to the creation of the National Health Service in 1948. In his presidential address to the British Medical Association in 1936 he called for reform, indicating the lack of time available to doctors as being the main defect in a disorganized service. Teamwork was needed and this could only come through a co-ordinated hospital system. Starting in Oxford in 1937 and later as the first chairman of the Nuffield Provincial Hospitals Trust, Buzzard helped to develop a regional link between voluntary and municipal hospitals, with the unified staffing of both and the payment of all doctors. The day of honorary service was over, he declared, and he foresaw the end of the voluntary hospital, resulting later in its absorption in a nationalized framework. As for general practitioners, he placed them in the community, furthering the cause of preventive and social medicine to which he attached great importance. This view was set forth forcefully in his Harveian oration for 1941 of the Royal College of Physicians. &#145;As a skilled politician and effective communicator he was ideally placed to render reform palatable to the conservative establishment, and to mediate with the vested interests threatened by the dramatic changes taking place&#146;  (Webster, 322).<br>
<br>As a result of Buzzard's influence an institute of social medicine was created at Oxford, with J. A. Ryle being appointed to the first chair in 1943. Buzzard's views on GPs anticipated the role fashioned for them in 1948 when the profession was sharply divided and consultants were given staffs of their own in the hospital world. Buzzard also had views on the health of the population as a whole. Although he criticized a British Medical Association report on physical education in 1936 because it valued gymnastic exercises over field games, he attached more importance to heredity and hygiene. Every individual, he believed, should develop a &#145;health conscience&#146;  (Cooke, 20). In 1938, influenced by eugenic views current at the time, he opposed marriage of the unfit, envisaging the day when it would be subject to state control.<br>
<br>If Buzzard was effective in committee work, he was less successful in politics, failing in 1937 to secure the university seat as a Conservative. That made no difference to the way he was valued by the university, and his term of office was extended for five years beyond the normal retirement age; he did not become an emeritus professor until 1943. In 1940 he was awarded the Osler memorial medal; many other honours came his way over the years, but he is most remembered for his work in Oxford&#151;no one did more for the medical school. He died at his home, 85 Banbury Road, Oxford, on 17 December 1945, and was succeeded in the baronetcy by his elder son, Anthony Wass (1902&#150;1972).<br>
