<span class="headword">Acland <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Cunningham]</span>,  Alice Sophia</span>, Lady Acland  (1849&#150;1935), <span class="occ">co-operative movement activist and advocate of women's advancement</span>, was born on 3 February 1849 at Heath Lodge, Petersfield, Hampshire, the eldest daughter of the Revd Francis Macaulay Cunningham (1815/16&#150;1899) and his wife, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Alice Charlotte Poore. Alice was educated at the local church school, and work as a district visitor, following her father's appointment as rector of Witney, Oxfordshire, fostered her concern for the poor. Her interests were shared with the Oxford don <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30327/', "Arthur Herbert Dyke Acland (1847&#150;1926)")</script>, whom she married on 14 June 1873. They had two sons and a daughter.<br>
<br>The Aclands' circle included Christian socialists and co-operators, particularly E. V. Neale and Thomas Hughes. However, Alice Acland attributed her interest in co-operation to contact with working people of the northern industrial centres, whom she met while accompanying her husband on speaking tours from the mid-1870s onwards. Her admiration for the working-class women that she met was reflected in her sketches &#145;Women's lives&#146;, published in the <span class="italic">Co-operative News</span>. Struck by the lack of opportunities for women beyond the domestic sphere, Acland participated in discussion of increased female involvement in co-operation during the movement's 1882 congress. Her friendship with Samuel Bamford, editor of the <span class="italic">Co-operative News</span>, enabled her to overcome initial opposition and establish a weekly &#145;Women's corner&#146; in the paper from January 1883. She advocated greater female participation in co-operation through women's meetings and discussion groups, and intended the &#145;Corner&#146; as a link between women throughout Britain. Conscious of male resistance, Acland called not overtly for women's rights, but for a greater sense of self-worth:<blockquote>We trade too much on our weakness as compared to men. &hellip; We cause our womanhood to be despised&#151;not to be respected. It is our own fault, and men have not, perhaps, been unwilling that it should be so. &hellip; England can never be all it might, when more than one-half of the nation hangs behind the other part. (<span class="italic">Co-operative News</span>, 6 Jan 1883, 25)</blockquote>The suggestion of co-operative women's meetings stimulated several responses, most significantly Mary Lawrenson's plan for a Women's League for the Spread of Co-operation&#151;later the Women's Co-operative Guild. Acland agreed to lead the guild, inviting prospective members to write to her, but she resisted more active propagandism, particularly platform speaking, in her concern not to offend male sensibilities. The guild was not immediately successful, and only three local branches were established during 1883. The year also saw the first national meeting of the guild at the Co-operative Congress, which confirmed Acland as organizing secretary.<br>
<br>Acland's health was, however, failing. Illness hampered her work for the guild, and her editorial duties on the &#145;Women's corner&#146; were deputed to her assistant, Amy Sharp. In 1884 Acland retired as guild secretary and her tenure as national president (1884&#150;6) was similarly curtailed. She also resigned as editor of the &#145;Women's corner&#146; in 1886. She retained a limited involvement with the guild, chairing a meeting at the 1892 Manchester Festival. However, for the remainder of her life Alice's poor health precluded an active public role.<br>
<br>Alice became Lady Acland in 1919 when her husband succeeded as thirteenth baronet. The title passed to her eldest son, Francis, when Sir Arthur died in 1926. Lady Acland was a complete invalid for the last twelve years of her life, but she retained the affection of co-operative women who granted her the freedom of the guild in 1931. She died on 5 July 1935 at home at 85 Onslow Square, London, survived by one son and her daughter. She was cremated at Golders Green on 8 July and her ashes interred with those of her husband at the Columb John Chapel, on the family estate at Killerton, Devon, on 10 July. A memorial service was held at St Martin-in-the-Fields, London, on 11 July.<br>
<br>Alice Acland worked for greater equality between men and women; her vision was apolitical and consistent with nineteenth-century notions of distinctions between male and female traits. She contended that women's lack of business knowledge militated against their participation in co-operative management; rather, female spirituality and gentleness should be applied to the moral salvation of both the co-operative movement and national life. Drawing strength of purpose from her own Christian convictions she insisted that quietness need not make women ineffectual: &#145;There are moments when speaking up is needed, and these we must not miss&#146;  (<span class="italic">Co-operative News</span>, 9 June 1883, 532&#150;3).<br>
