<span class="headword">Adams,  Mary</span>  (<em>supp. </em><em>fl. </em>1652), <span class="occ">self-proclaimed virgin mother</span>, is a fiction whose existence rests in the creation of one pamphlet formed around her alleged misdeeds and blasphemies. This work is called <span class="italic">The Ranters Monster</span> and was printed in London for George Horton in March 1652. <span class="italic">The Ranters Monster</span> relates how one Mary Adams of Tillingham, Essex, named herself the Virgin Mary, claiming that &#145;she was conceived with child of the Holy Ghost&#146;. Furthermore, it was reported how she denied the teachings of the gospel and wickedly declared that &#145;Christ was not yet come in the flesh; but she was to bring forth the Savior of the World, and that all those that did not believe in him were damn'd&#146;. For these blasphemies it was ordered by the local minister that Adams be imprisoned until the time of her delivery. After a protracted labour of eight days, she gave birth on the ninth day to a stillborn, ugly, misshapen monster. This loathsome creature was said to have neither hands nor feet, but claws like a toad. Adams herself became consumed by disease, rotting away, her body disfigured by blotches, boils, and putrid scabs. To compound her sins she refused to repent, and committed the terrible crime of suicide. This &#145;true Relation&#146; was confirmed by a group of village notables, among them the minister, churchwardens, and parish constable, their names appended to the end of the text  (<span class="italic">The Ranters Monster</span>, 3&#150;5). The account in <span class="italic">The Ranters Monster</span> was reproduced in some contemporary newsbooks, and later in a broadside enumerating the great blasphemers of the times. It may also have come to the attention of John Reeve and Lodowick Muggleton, who were to denounce the false Christs, false prophets, and &#145;counterfeit Virgin Mary's&#146; of the world  (Reeve, 5).<br>
<br>No one by the name Adams nor any one of the witnesses named in <span class="italic">The Ranters Monster</span> occurs in any of the records of the parish of Tillingham, Essex. It can only be concluded that the pamphlet is fictitious. The supposed profusion of &#145;false Virgin Maries&#146; in the minds of Reeve and Muggleton hint at the genesis of the tale  (Muggleton, 157). For the story of Mary Adams bears a strong resemblance to the case of Joan Robins, the supposed spouse of John Robins, whose disciples were said to believe that in July 1651 she would give birth to &#145;the Saviour of all that shall be saved in this world&#146;  (E. H., 3). Moreover, <span class="italic">The Ranters Monster</span> can also be seen as forming part of an older tradition, that of the genre of monstrous births. Monstrous births could be interpreted as providential signs warning against private and public sin, and their appearance was chronicled with great care. There are several examples of this type of literature in the period, among them <span class="italic">A Declaration of a Strange and Wonderfull Monster</span> (1646), from which the woodcut illustration on the title-page of <span class="italic">The Ranters Monster</span> was taken. In this earlier work the alleged begetter of a monstrous child is stigmatized as a papist, this association of the deliverance of evil into the world by a sinful creature being a recurring theme in works of this kind. Indeed the character of Mary Adams can be seen as serving a particular function in <span class="italic">The Ranters Monster</span>: as a warning against the licentiousness of the Ranters. Constructed as a devout, godly woman, Adams becomes victim to the familiar slippage through various forms of religious belief, becoming successively a Baptist, a member of the Family of Love, and finally a Ranter. As a Ranter she is said to maintain diabolical tenets: the denial of God, heaven, and hell, and the opinion that a woman may have sexual relations with any man&#151;regardless of his marital status. As such <span class="italic">The Ranters Monster</span> is instructive both for its fictive, yet evidently believable, account of a woman claiming to be the new Virgin Mary, soon to be delivered of a Christ child, and for its construction of assumed Ranter beliefs.<br>
