<span class="headword">Clerke,  Charles</span>  (1743&#150;1779), <span class="occ">naval officer and circumnavigator</span>, was born in Weatherfield, Essex, the son of Joseph Clerke, a farmer. He had a brother, Sir John Clerke, and a sister who married Paul Henry Maty. He entered the navy in 1755 as captain's servant and midshipman in the <i>Dorsetshire</i>, served continuously during the Seven Years' War, and was on board the <i>Bellona</i> when she captured the <i>Courageux</i> on 13 August 1761. During the action Clerke was stationed in the mizen-top, and when the mizen-mast was shot away fell with it into the sea. After the peace he was appointed able seaman and midshipman in the <i>Dolphin</i>, and sailed with Commodore the Hon. John Byron on his voyage round the world in 1764 to 1766. On his return he communicated to Matthew Maty, secretary of the Royal Society, an account of the great height of the Patagonians, among whom he says they saw &#145;hardly a man less than eight feet; most of them considerably more&#146;. The letter was read to the society on 12 February 1767, and published in the <span class="italic">Philosophical Transactions</span> for 1767  (57, 1768, 75&#150;9). In 1768 he was appointed as master's mate to the <i>Endeavour</i>, with Captain Cook, and again sailed round the world on that expedition in 1768 to 1771. During the <i>Endeavour</i>'s stay in Tahiti, Clerke was associated with a girl known as Mrs Tate. He was ordered by Cook to act as lieutenant in a vacancy on 27 May 1771, during the voyage, as he was &#145;a young Man extremely well quallified for that station&#146;  (<span class="italic">Journals</span>, 1.472) and was confirmed in that rank on the expedition's return to England on 31 July 1771. He sailed as second lieutenant of the <i>Resolution</i> in Cook's second voyage round the world in 1772 to 1775.<br>
<br>On his return to England, Clerke was advanced to the rank of commander on 26 August 1775, and when Cook's third expedition was fitting out in 1776, Clerke was appointed to command the <i>Discovery</i>. Before the <i>Discovery</i> sailed, Clerke was committed to the king's bench prison for debt, having apparently made himself security for his brother Captain Sir John Clerke RN, who had sailed for the East Indies without discharging his debts. Eventually Clerke managed to extricate himself from prison and rejoin the <i>Discovery</i> in Plymouth, catching up with Cook in Table Bay. On the death of Captain Cook on 14 February 1779, Clerke succeeded to the command of the expedition, which, however, he did not long enjoy, dying six months later of tuberculosis he had contracted in prison. During these six months he had given proofs of his ability, energy, and devotion. In accordance with Cook's orders he had taken the expedition once again through Bering Strait into high latitudes in an attempt to return to England by the north-west passage or failing that the north-east passage. Being obstructed by pack ice he was forced to turn back, realizing that any further attempt would not only be fruitless, but also dangerous. The climate proved extremely trying to his condition and he died on 22 August 1779 within sight of Kamchatka and was buried with full military honours on 30 August under a tree, on rising ground in a valley on the north side of the Russian settlement of Petropavlovsk in Avacha Bay.<br>
