<span class="headword">May,  Francis</span>  (1803&#150;1885), <span class="occ">grocer and match manufacturer</span>, was born at Alton, Hampshire, on 17 July 1803, the third son and fourth child of Samuel May, a prosperous merchant belonging to an old Quaker family, and his wife, Anne Curtis of Alton. His older brother Charles (1801&#150;1860), an engineer, was partner in the Quaker agricultural machinery firm Ransome and May and later became an inventor of distinction and a fellow of the Royal Society.<br>
<br>After leaving school Francis May was apprenticed for three years to a grocer in Epping. He then set himself up in Bishopsgate, London, as a tea dealer and grocer. In 1825 he married Jane Holmes (<i>d</i>. 1872), of Ampthill, Bedfordshire. They had two sons and five daughters. His nature was so gentle that he once wrote to his son's headmaster to protest against a caning.<br>
<br>About 1840 May became the retail agent of William Bryant of Plymouth, a tallow and lubricating oil producer and sugar refiner. Their agency links developed and in 1844 they went into partnership as Bryant and May, provision merchants, in Fenchurch Street and Tooley Street, London. In 1850 they began importing matches from Carl Lundstr&ouml;m of Sweden, and five years later bought from him the patent rights for a type of safety match. This they produced in a factory at Fairfield Road, Bow, from 1861 onwards. Bryant's eldest son, Wilberforce Bryant, then twenty-four, was appointed manager. May's stake in the partnership is not known, but he and William Bryant combined their mercantile activities with an overall supervision of the match factory.<br>
<br>May was not included in Wilberforce Bryant's ambitious plans to become the leader of Britain's match-making industry. In the early 1850s he moved to Reigate, Surrey; once a year the girls from the Bow factory came on the firm's outing to his house, West View, at the foot of Reigate Hill. From his garden he sent acorns to relatives in Australia.<br>
<br>From 1864 onwards William Bryant and his four sons, who were all partners in 1868, strove to ease May out. When he objected two Quaker arbitrators were appointed, but the Bryants disagreed with their findings and blackmailed them by threatening to take the matter to court, something abhorrent to Quakers. The quarterly meeting then pleaded with May to give in, it being far more blessed to suffer a wrong than to do a wrong. May left the firm about 1875.<br>
<br>May was already much involved in Quaker affairs in Reigate, where he had campaigned to make the town into a municipal borough (achieved in 1863). He helped finance the rebuilding of the meeting-house, and set up a British School there. His wife died in 1872. May was a tall, bewhiskered man of imposing appearance, even in his old age a commanding figure in the ministers' gallery of the meeting-house. Once when he rose to give testimony he began with the words, &#145;We of the opulent classes &hellip;&#146; Thereafter the youngsters in the meeting nicknamed him Old Opulence. He died at his home, West View, Reigate, on 1 December 1885.<br>
