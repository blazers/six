<span class="headword">Porter,  Samuel Lowry</span>, Baron Porter  (1877&#150;1956), <span class="occ">judge</span>, was born in Headingley, Leeds, on 7 February 1877, the younger son of Hugh Porter (<i>b</i>. 1877), warehouse manager, and his wife, Mary Ellen Lowry. He was educated at the Perse School, Cambridge, and Emmanuel College, Cambridge, where he later became an honorary fellow in 1937. He obtained a third class in part one of the classical tripos (1899) and a second in part two of the law tripos (1900), and he was awarded a half-blue in tennis. He was called to the bar by the Inner Temple in 1905, and, having first worked up a good general practice, later specialized in the commercial court. His practice was interrupted by the First World War, when he served as a captain on the general list, and was appointed MBE. He took silk in 1925, was recorder of Newcastle under Lyme in 1928&#150;32, and Walsall in 1932&#150;4. In 1934 he was appointed a judge of the King's Bench Division and knighted on 23 November, and in 1938 he became a lord of appeal in ordinary without passing through the Court of Appeal. He received a life peerage as Baron Porter of Longfield, co. Tyrone, a reminder of his family's roots in Ireland. He was also sworn of the privy council.<br>
<br>Porter's judgments in the King's Bench Division were always very sound. They were not spectacular, as he aimed at conciseness, and avoided the utterance of an unnecessary word. The two most notable are perhaps <i>Mutual Finance Ltd v. John Wetton &amp; Sons Ltd</i> (1937), and <i>Lloyds Bank Ltd v. Bank of America etc. Association</i> (1937). The former is a valuable contribution to the doctrine of undue influence, and lays down that a transaction can be avoided if it has been procured by a threat to prosecute any person whose safety, for whatever reason, was desired by the promisor, such desire being known to the promisee. The latter, which was affirmed by the Court of Appeal (1938), concerns agency. It enunciates the proposition that where B pledges documents relating to merchandise to A, and A hands them back, to enable B, in conformity with a course of dealing pursued between the parties over several years, to sell the merchandise as trustee for A, but B, instead, pledges the documents with C, who takes them in good faith, A cannot recover them from C.<br>
<br>Although Lord Porter never courted publicity, as a lord of appeal he inevitably achieved it by the very high standard of his speeches. The two by which he should perhaps be best remembered are speeches of dissent: in <i>Joyce v. Director of Public Prosecutions</i> (1946) and <i>National Anti-Vivisection Society v. IRC</i> (1948). In the former, a treason trial, the crown based its case on the dubious ground that the mere renewal by William Brooke Joyce of his British passport on 24 August 1939, for the customary period of one year, necessarily imposed on him, although an alien resident outside the realm, the duty of allegiance to the crown. The trial judge left to the jury simply the question whether Joyce, in delivering his broadcasts from Germany during the war, had or had not adhered to the king's enemies, a question which could clearly be answered only in one way. The court of criminal appeal, and the majority of the House of Lords, regarded this as an adequate direction, but Lord Porter unhesitatingly pointed out the error, which lay in the placing of the onus of proof. It should, in his view, be incumbent on the crown to prove not only the renewal of the passport, but also its retention and use on and after 18 September 1939, when Joyce was first employed as a broadcaster to Great Britain. His speech concluded with a serious warning that, especially in a case of treason, the jury should never, even in wartime, unless under statutory authority, be ousted from a function that is rightly its own. Of the speeches in <i>Joyce</i>, Lord Shawcross later commented that he had &#145;always considered that of the Law Lords concerned, Lord Porter was the most learned and responsible&#146;  (Shawcross, 82).<br>
<br>The other case is one of the most important authorities on the law of charitable trusts. Here again, Lord Porter was the sole dissentient. The majority held that the objects of the Anti-Vivisection Society could not be charitable because (a) they contemplated legislation, and therefore were of a political character, which necessarily excluded them from the charitable field, and (b) they were not beneficial to the community, because any benefit to public morals obtained by their success would be outweighed by the detriment which would inevitably be suffered by medical science. Lord Porter dissented on both grounds. On (a) he would exclude from the charitable definition only those trusts whose objects could be attained by no other means than by legislation. On (b) his view may be summarized as suggesting that a judge need not take upon himself the burden of weighing against one another the possible advantages and disadvantages which may accrue from the success of the objects of a trust, which, if it once satisfies the definition of charitable, does not cease to satisfy it merely because it may bring harm as well as benefit to the community.<br>
<br>Other leading cases in which Lord Porter was involved included <i>Duncan v. Cammell, Laird &amp; Co. Ltd</i> (1942), <i>Adams v. Naylor</i> (1946), and <i>Franklin v. Minister of Town and Country Planning</i> (1948). He also sat in numerous cases before the judicial committee of the privy council, and these included <i>Commonwealth of Australia v. Bank of New South Wales</i> (1950), which (as he saw it) raised &#145;important and difficult questions&#146; as to the legislative authority of the Commonwealth government. Lord Porter consistently showed himself during his judicial career to be a learned lawyer, who could turn his mind with equal facility to any branch of the law. He cared about the clear use of language and confined himself in his judgments and speeches to the precise issues raised in a case. He avoided generalizations and he did not seek to offer restatements of the law over and above what a case demanded. His style was undemonstrative but he was firm, patient, and invariably courteous.<br>
<br>Porter was active outside as well as inside the courts. He achieved prominence, early in his judicial career, through his extra-judicial role as chairman of a tribunal of inquiry that sat in 1936 to consider allegations of a budget leak. The other members of the tribunal were Gavin Simonds KC and Roland Oliver KC. The tribunal's report (<span class="italic">Parl. papers</span>, 1936, 7, Cmd 5184) resulted in the resignation of the colonial secretary, J. H. Thomas, and Sir Alfred Butt MP. There were some misgivings about the procedure adopted, because the examination of the various witnesses was borne by the tribunal, especially Porter himself, and in later tribunals of inquiry corrective measures were taken to avoid or lessen the appearance of a hostile attitude adopted by a tribunal from the outset. The problem was recognized by Porter and it was referred to explicitly in the report. He was greatly interested in international law, and did much valuable work for the International Law Association, of which he was president in 1946. He was chairman of the committee on the law of defamation, which reported in 1948 and was the precursor of the <span class="roman">Defamation Act</span> of 1952. For some years he was involved in wage negotiations. He received the honorary degree of LLD from Birmingham (1940) and, in company with such fellow honorary graduates as Earl Wavell and Ernest Bevin, from Cambridge (1947). He received an honorary LLD from Queen's University, Belfast, in 1949. In 1951 he was appointed GBE.<br>
<br>Bombed out of his London flat during the war, Lord Porter (invariably known to friends and colleagues as Sam Porter) returned to Emmanuel College where he had rooms up to and beyond his resignation (through ill health) as a law lord in 1954. He worshipped at St Columba's Presbyterian Church (his mother's church) in Cambridge. A considerable amount of time was spent in London, of course, but his attachment to his college was unusual and close. In an obituary, Edward Welbourne, the then master of Emmanuel, said that he:<blockquote>gave to our young men an example of modesty in success, of success by desert, of equality without assertion, of regularity at chapel, of infallible courtesy to all he met, of consideration to the college servants &hellip; and of loyalty to this house, to which he thought he owed a debt, not knowing how greatly he had repaid us for the little we had done in his youth. (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 28 Feb 1956)</blockquote>Sir Norman Birkett, also an honorary fellow of Emmanuel, wrote of his &#145;great personal qualities&#146; despite his &#145;rather shy and retiring and self-effacing&#146; personality; and he concluded by stating that Lord Porter &#145;will be remembered as a great lawyer and his decisions will be quoted by generations of lawyers&#146;  (<span class="italic">Emmanuel College Magazine</span>, 38, 1955&#150;6, 9&#150;11). Lord Porter, who never married, died at the London Clinic, 20 Devonshire Place, London, on 13 February 1956. Had he lived, he would have become treasurer of the Inner Temple in 1957.<br>
