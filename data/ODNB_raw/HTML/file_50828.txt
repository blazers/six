<span class="headword">Benn,  John Meriton</span>  (1908&#150;1992), <span class="occ">educationist and civil servant</span>, was born on 16 July 1908 at 231 Manchester Road, Burnley, Lancashire, the third of the five children of Ernest Benn (1871&#150;1935), leather merchant, and his wife, (Emily) Louise, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Hey (1879&#150;1957). John Benn was educated at Burnley grammar school and Christ's College, Cambridge (1926&#150;30), where he was a scholar and took a degree in French and German, with a first class in French. He became a teacher at Exeter School (1931&#150;4), Lektor at Halle University (1934), and then a teacher at Regent Street Polytechnic secondary school, London (1935). In the same year he published a school text of <span class="italic">Practical French Proses</span>. On 18 April 1933 he married Valentine Rosemary Seward (1910&#150;1998), daughter of William Seward. They had two daughters, Diana and Susan.<br>
<br>In 1935, at the very early age of twenty-seven, Benn became a divisional inspector of schools in Northern Ireland, and moved to Londonderry. This was a determining event for him, as he lived in Northern Ireland for the rest of his life, and became an outstanding public servant there. As an inspector he was immersed in the strengths and weaknesses of Ulster public elementary schools. The children left school at fourteen, classes of over fifty children were commonplace, parents had to pay for all books, there were no school meals, and there was virtually no school transport. Benn recalled that most rural schools had no artificial lighting and very often no running water, and that the teachers laid and lit the fires in the morning. And yet, he insisted, there was often first-class education in progress, and he admired many of the teachers he encountered. But the system was frugal and old-fashioned, and once the 1944 Butler proposals for England and Wales were known, the case for radical change in Northern Ireland was overwhelming.<br>
<br>In 1944 Benn ceased to be a school inspector, moved to Belfast as a principal in the Ministry of Education for Northern Ireland, and emerged as the administrative driving force in adapting the <span class="roman">Butler Education Act</span> so that universal secondary education was provided for in Northern Ireland, building partly on the private secondary school system which had run parallel to the elementary schools. The separate Roman Catholic schools were retained, and were substantially grant-aided. During the next twenty years, thanks to greatly increased exchequer funding, a completely new network of secondary schools was created and the old secondary schools became high-standard selective grammar schools. The facilities which had been lacking before the war became commonplace. A secondary-school examination system, fully compatible with the system in England and Wales, was introduced. The Ulster College, which evolved later into the University of Ulster, was established. Benn, who became assistant secretary in 1951, senior assistant secretary in 1959, and permanent secretary in 1964, had a gift for steady constructive action, and without him the changes in Northern Ireland would have been far less effectively made.<br>
<br>In 1969, as one of the responses to the tensions that had erupted in 1968, Benn was appointed the first Northern Ireland commissioner for complaints (or ombudsman), dealing with allegations of unfair practices by local and public bodies. For this post he was ideally suited by temperament and background, and he held it until 1973. It was coupled with the post of Northern Ireland parliamentary commissioner for administration in 1972&#150;3. He gave much time and thought to individuals, and was adept at reconciling conflicting interests. After retirement he was chairman of the Northern Ireland schools examination council (1974&#150;81); pro-chancellor of Queen's University, Belfast, and chairman of the senate (1979&#150;86); chairman of the board of governors of Rupert Stanley College of Further Education (1986&#150;91); and chairman of the board of governors of Sullivan Upper School, Holywood (1987&#150;9).<br>
<br>Throughout his life Benn was interested in people. He was immensely sociable, and relished nothing better than exercising his skill as a raconteur and enjoying the pleasure of good company. He showed a remarkable gift for understanding ordinary human problems. When he summed up fraught discussions on Irish issues, which he was often asked to do, he was wonderfully fair and illuminating. His integrity, ability, and goodwill were unmistakable. At St Mark's, the Church of Ireland parish at Dundela, Belfast, he was a regular worshipper, church warden, and expert bellringer. He was also an enthusiastic and successful actor with his local dramatic society, the Holywood players. His contribution to society in Northern Ireland was recognized by his appointment as CB in 1969 and the award of an honorary degree of LLD by Queen's University in 1973. He died at 75 Church Road, Holywood, co. Down, on 16 September 1992, and was cremated at Roselawn crematorium, Belfast, following a funeral service in the church of St Philip and St James, Holywood, on 18 September. He was survived by his wife and two daughters.<br>
