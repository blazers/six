<span class="headword">Crosby,  Sarah</span>  (1729&#150;1804), <span class="occ">Methodist preacher</span>, was born on 7 November 1729, probably near Leeds. Little is known of her early life other than the details revealed in the biographical account and diary extracts that were published in the <span class="italic">Methodist Magazine</span> in 1806. She attended Church of England services at the age of fourteen, heard George Whitefield preach when she was about twenty, and dated her conversion to Methodism from 30 October 1749. A year later she joined John Wesley's Foundery Society and was established as a class leader by 1752. Details of Crosby's marriage, which began in 1750 and lasted about seven years, are vague. However, from a comment crossed out in the manuscript of Mary Bosanquet's spiritual autobiography, it appears that Mr Crosby deserted his wife and &#145;went abroad and returned no more&#146;  (autobiography, pt 3, 9).<br>
<br>In the absence of her husband, Crosby's spiritual activities intensified. She lived in lodgings in Moorfields with fellow Methodists, including the preacher Sarah Ryan. In January 1761 she travelled to Derby, where the Dobinsons (a couple she had met at the Foundery) intended to form a Methodist society. Crosby's success exceeded her own expectations, and she was soon preaching to audiences of over 200 people. She experienced anxieties regarding this public role, writing in her diary, &#145;I was not sure whether it was right for me to exhort in so public a manner&#146;  (Taft, 2.42). She wrote to Wesley seeking advice, and their subsequent correspondence provides valuable evidence of his developing views on the position of women within Methodism. Women Methodists played a prominent part in the evangelical revival, and many of those appointed as class and band leaders by Wesley in the 1740s became the preachers of the 1760s. Wesley responded to this development with a mixture of anxiety and pragmatism, continuing to defend the Pauline injunction against women's preaching while still recognizing the &#145;<i>extraordinary</i> call&#146; of individuals  (<span class="italic">Letters</span>, 5.257).<br>
<br>Crosby returned to London in April 1761 and continued preaching in the south of England. By the mid-1760s she had joined the Methodist community of Sarah Ryan and Mary Bosanquet (later Fletcher) at their school and orphanage in Leytonstone, Essex. In June 1768 she moved with the community on its relocation to Cross Hall near Morley, Yorkshire. Ryan did not survive the move, but Crosby and Bosanquet established weekly Methodist meetings, of which Crosby later commented: &#145;Jesus made me his mouth unto the people, and poured the spirit of love, zeal and wisdom upon me, for their instruction&#146;  (<span class="italic">Methodist Magazine</span>, 29, 563). A letter from Wesley to Crosby from this period offered practical advice to women preachers and revealed his ambivalence over their status:<blockquote>Even in public you may properly enough intermix <i>short exhortations</i> with prayer; but keep as far from what is called preaching as you can: therefore never take a text; never speak in a continued discourse without some break, about four or five minutes. (<span class="italic">Letters</span>, 5.130)</blockquote>Crosby travelled widely and was much in demand throughout the mid-1770s, preaching in chapels, private homes, and the open air to audiences of many hundreds. She also accompanied Wesley on some of his tours of the north of England. Summarizing her activities for 1777, Crosby recalled riding &#145;960 miles, to keep 220 public meetings, at many of which some hundreds of precious souls were present, about 600 private meetings, and to write an 116 letters, many of them long ones, besides many, many conversations with souls in private&#146;  (<span class="italic">Methodist Magazine</span>, 29.567). The itinerant preacher Frances Pawson was a member of the crowd who listened to Crosby on 1 December 1774. &#145;Her heart and words acted in concert. Every sentence was impressive, and carried conviction to the heart&#146;  (<span class="italic">Experience</span>, 33).<br>
<br>Life at Cross Hall was disrupted in 1781 when Mary Bosanquet married John Fletcher, vicar of Madeley, and moved to his parish in Shropshire. Crosby continued her work in Yorkshire and by 1793 she was living in Leeds with Ann Tripp (who had been employed as a governess at Leytonstone). The two women led and inspired a band of women preachers known as the &#145;female brethren&#146;. Crosby died in Leeds on 29 October 1804 just prior to her seventy-fifth birthday, having attended two class meetings and a band meeting the week before. She was buried in the churchyard of Leeds Old Church, alongside her companions Sarah Ryan and Ann Tripp, and her tombstone is inscribed with the words &#145;A mother in Israel hath she been: her works shall praise her in the gate.&#146;<br>
<br>According to Zachariah Taft, Crosby left behind a number of notebooks that were given to Ann Tripp and Elizabeth Mortimer. Extracts were published in the <span class="italic">Methodist Magazine</span> after Mortimer had spent two years campaigning for their inclusion by writing letters to the editor  (Brown, 175&#150;6). Crosby's life demonstrates the importance of women to the success of early Methodism and suggests the role that spiritual fellowship played in the lives of eighteenth-century women. Mortimer's struggle to establish Crosby's place in Methodist historiography also reveals the problematic position of women preachers within nineteenth-century Methodism.<br>
