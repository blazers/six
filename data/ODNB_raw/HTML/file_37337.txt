</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Dadd,  Richard</span>  (1817&#150;1886), <span class="occ">painter</span>, was born on 1 August 1817 at 293 High Street, Chatham, Kent, the fourth of the seven children of Robert Dadd (1788/9&#150;1843), chemist, and his wife, Mary Ann (1790&#150;1824), the eldest daughter of Richard Martin, shipwright, and his wife, Sarah. He was the third of the four sons of this marriage, and had two half-brothers by his father's second marriage, to Sophia Oakes Munk (<i>d</i>. 1830).<h2>
<a name="Educationandearlycareer"></a>Education and early career</h2>Dadd attended the cathedral grammar school at Rochester from 1827 to 1831, receiving a thorough grounding in Latin. He began to draw seriously when he was about thirteen. The Kent countryside, the River Medway, and the royal naval dockyard (where many of his family worked), inspired a lifelong love of landscape and shipping subjects. It is unclear whether he received formal teaching at this stage, but his earliest surviving watercolours demonstrate a familiarity with techniques used in miniature painting, and the scale and meticulous detail of his later work suggest that he was truly a miniaturist at heart.<br>
<br>In 1834 the family moved to London, living at 15 Suffolk Street, Charing Cross, where Robert Dadd ran a gilding and ormolu manufacturing business which he had acquired from Andr&eacute; Picnot, his first wife's brother-in-law. Richard Dadd entered the Royal Academy Schools in 1837, after a period spent drawing at the British Museum. He won medals for drawing and painting, and was considered an outstanding student in a group which included a number of the future most celebrated painters of the Victorian era&#151;William Powell Frith, Augustus Egg, and John &#145;Spanish&#146; Phillip (his future brother-in-law). He was a charming and lively companion, noted for his good humour and kindness as well as his diligence. The author of a somewhat premature obituary  (<span class="italic">Art Union</span>, 5/58) wrote that &#145;all who knew him speak of the exceeding gentleness and sweetness of his nature, which, though sensitive, was anything but irritable; he was satisfied with small praise for himself, but ready and lavish of his praise of others&#146;.<br>
<br>Dadd's first exhibited works, <span class="italic">Portrait of a Dog</span> and <span class="italic">Head of a Soldier of the 17<sup>th</sup> Century</span>, were displayed at the Suffolk Street Galleries of the Society of British Artists in 1837. He continued to exhibit regularly, there and at the British Institution, and from 1839 at the Royal Academy. His output soon included scenes from history and literature, subjects that were almost essential for a young artist wishing to make his way. A watercolour of <span class="italic">Don Quixote Resolving to Sally out as a Knight-Errant</span> (exh. Society of British Artists, 1839) was the first painting Dadd sold. Other early works include <span class="italic">Alfred the Great in Disguise of a Peasant, reflecting on the Misfortunes of his Country</span> (exh. RA, 1840) and <span class="italic">Elgiva the Queen of Edwy in Banishment</span> (exh. Royal Manchester Institution, 1840). In the late 1830s he also painted many small informal watercolour portraits of family and friends, typified by the <span class="italic">Portraits of Thomas and Elizabeth Carter</span> (Bethlem Royal Hospital Museum).<h2>
<a name="Fairypaintingsofthe1840s"></a>Fairy paintings of the 1840s</h2>In 1841 Dadd established his reputation as a fairy painter with two scenes from Shakespeare's <span class="italic">A Midsummer Night's Dream</span>, <span class="italic">Titania Sleeping</span> (exh. RA; Louvre, Paris) and <span class="italic">Puck</span> (exh. Society of British Artists, 1841; priv. coll.), attracting critical acclaim for his poetic imagination and his accomplished portrayal of the nude figure. These were followed by other fairy subjects including <span class="italic">Fairies Assembling at Sunset to Hold their Revels</span> (exh. Royal Manchester Institution, 1841), which won the opinion that &#145;Mr Dadd is emphatically the poet among painters&#146;  (<span class="italic">Art Union</span>, 3, Oct 1841, 171) and <span class="italic">Come unto these Yellow Sands</span> (exh. RA, 1842; priv. coll.), which approached &#145;more nearly to the essence of the poet [presumably Shakespeare] than any other illustrations we have seen&#146;  (<span class="italic">Art Union</span>, 4, July 1842, 161). Dadd's fairy paintings from this period can be seen as lyrical evocations of the world of nature, though they were essentially theatrical in concept, with brilliant dramatic lighting and carefully choreographed figures. His principal work at this time, however, was a series of paintings, said to number more than a hundred, to decorate 26 Grosvenor Square (now dem.), the London house of Henry, sixth Baron Foley. The subjects, chosen by Dadd himself, were scenes from Byron's dramatic and demon-haunted poem &#145;Manfred&#146;, and from &#145;Jerusalem Delivered&#146;, a romance of the crusades by the sixteenth-century Italian poet Torquato Tasso. His skill as an illustrator appears in another commissioned work, the wood-engravings for &#145;Robin Goodfellow&#146; in <span class="italic">The Book of British Ballads</span>, ed. S. C. Hall, 1842, for which he drew directly onto the wood blocks.<h2>
<a name="Travelsandthebeginningsofmentalbreakdown"></a>Travels and the beginnings of mental breakdown</h2>In 1842, on the recommendation of David Roberts, Dadd was employed to accompany Sir Thomas Phillips, the Welsh lawyer and former mayor of Newport, as artist and travelling companion on a tour of Europe and the Near and Middle East. He left England with Phillips on 16 July 1842 on a journey which was to last ten months and take them through Switzerland, north Italy, Greece, Turkey, Syria, Palestine, Egypt, Malta, and back through Italy from the south. In the course of it Dadd was to experience the beginnings of a catastrophic mental breakdown, from which he never fully recovered. Most of the drawings which he made during the journey were pencil sketches, the incessant travelling leaving little time for more finished work. A surviving sketchbook, now in the Victoria and Albert Museum, crammed with tiny figures, heads, trees, buildings, boats, camels, scraps of landscape, fragments of sculpture, and architectural details, shows the quality of his meticulous draughtsmanship which, despite the difficulties, was always sharp, precise, and vivid. Two more substantial watercolours also survive, a small full-length <span class="italic">Portrait of Sir Thomas Phillips in Arab Dress</span> (Bethlem Royal Hospital Museum, Kent) which was probably made during the relative leisure of a trip on the Nile, and a companion portrait of Phillips in Turkish costume.<br>
<br>During the latter part of the journey Dadd started to show signs of mental disturbance. In Rome, in April 1843, he was beginning to grow irrationally excited and quarrelsome on religious subjects, causing some concern to Phillips, but then seemed to recover his self-control. In fact he was already experiencing outright delusions, believing that he was persecuted by the devil who appeared in different disguises including that of Phillips himself. He later confessed to having felt an impulse to attack the pope in a public place, an impulse which he resisted because the pope was too well protected. After a stay in Rome the journey continued, but his mental state deteriorated again and he left Phillips in France at the end of May and alone hurried home to England, where word soon spread that he had returned insane.<br>
<br>To those who knew him, Dadd's character appeared to have changed. He had become watchful, suspicious, and unpredictable, concealing the fact that he was receiving messages and instructions from unknown sources (probably in the form of voices), but occasionally dropping hints that he was pursued by evil spirits, and was himself searching for the devil. Eventually he came to believe that the Egyptian god Osiris was the supreme being controlling all his actions, and the source of his &#145;secret admonitions&#146;. However, for much of the time Dadd still behaved normally. He had resumed work immediately on his return, submitting a hastily drawn cartoon of <span class="italic">St George and the Dragon</span> to the competition to decorate the new Palace of Westminster. He also completed one major painting based on his travels in Syria, a carefully composed and tranquil <span class="italic">Caravan Halted by the Sea Shore</span> (exh. Liverpool Academy, 1843; priv. coll.).<h2>
<a name="LifeinBethlemandBroadmoor"></a>Life in Bethlem and Broadmoor</h2>After a period of apparent recovery Dadd's condition worsened again, and on 28 August 1843 he persuaded his father to accompany him to Cobham Park in Kent, near to his childhood home of Chatham, where he stabbed him to death with a knife bought specifically for the purpose. Dadd later explained that he had killed the devil in disguise, and seems to have retained this belief throughout his life, talking objectively about the murder as an event for which he held no personal responsibility. He made his way to France, but was arrested after trying to cut the throat of a stranger who was travelling with him in a carriage. Dadd was confined in a French asylum for ten months, and extradited in July 1844 to appear before the magistrates at Rochester. Though formally committed for trial, he was certified insane and was admitted on 22 August to the state criminal lunatic asylum attached to Bethlem Hospital at St George's Fields in Southwark, south London. He was never to know freedom again.<br>
<br>The &#145;government wing&#146;, where Dadd was first confined, had been built in 1816 to house patients sent by the courts and later through other legal channels. It was a prison-like block with heavily barred windows at the back of the main building, largely untouched by reforms which were taking place in the rest of the hospital. The internal environment was dark, cramped, and dismal, the outer world restricted to a bleak, high-walled exercise yard, and many of his companions were hardened criminals who had become insane while in prison. Dadd's living conditions were much improved in 1857, when he and some of the &#145;better class&#146; of criminal patients were moved to a specially converted ward in the main hospital, but far greater improvements occurred in 1864, when all the criminal patients were transferred from Bethlem to the new state asylum of Broadmoor in Berkshire. Built like a small village at the top of a hill, its terraced gardens had views over the surrounding countryside, and there were many more facilities for recreation and employment.<h2>
<a name="Laterworkstravelpaintingsandwatercolours"></a>Later works: travel paintings and water-colours</h2>For some years Dadd was considered a dangerous patient, being unpredictable and sometimes violent, his conversation being rambling and incoherent when touching on the subject of his delusions. However, he soon began to work again in Bethlem, and effectively maintained his career as a painter for the rest of his life, though his pictures were rarely seen outside the asylums. A visitor in 1845 wrote of some recent drawings that they<blockquote>exhibit all the power, fancy, and judgment for which his works were eminent previous to his insanity. They are absolutely wonderful in delicate finish. They consist principally of landscapes&#151;memories of eastern scenes, or wrought from a small sketchbook in his possession. (<span class="italic">Art Union</span>, 7)</blockquote>These drawings almost certainly included the spectacular moonlight scene <span class="italic">Artist's Halt in the Desert</span> (exh. &#145;Art Treasures of the United Kingdom&#146;, Manchester, 1857; British Museum, London), recalling an episode in the Holy Land when he and his party had paused at night by the shore of the Dead Sea. Another was probably <span class="italic">View in the Island of Rhodes</span> (V&amp;A), a bare rocky landscape depicted with almost photographic exactitude. He continued to paint landscapes and seascapes throughout his years of confinement, working both from sketches and from his remarkable visual memory, and never losing the sense of space and immediacy.<br>
<br>Of Dadd's watercolours from the 1850s many were imaginative figure compositions, comprising scenes from literature, history, the <span class="roman">Bible</span>, and everyday life, and included a series of over thirty &#145;Sketches to Illustrate the Passions&#146;: examples are held by Bethlem Royal Hospital Museum, Kent, and the Victoria and Albert Museum and the British Museum, London. For these he used washes of low-key colour and strongly drawn outline, but in his most characteristic and personal style he developed a highly refined version of the miniaturist's technique of stippling with the point of the brush, achieving extreme delicacy of texture and colour and a haunting, dreamlike quality. This technique was used in <span class="italic">Port Stragglin</span> (1861; British Museum, London), an almost hallucinatory view of an imaginary seaport; two eastern scenes, <span class="italic">Fantasie &eacute;gyptienne</span> (1865; Bethlem Royal Hospital Museum, Kent) and <span class="italic">Fantasie de l'hareme &eacute;gyptienne</span> (1865; Ashmolean Museum, Oxford); <span class="italic">A Wayside Inn</span> (1871; Bethlem Royal Hospital Museum, Kent); and <span class="italic">Tlos in Lycia</span> (1883; Leeds City Art Galleries, Leeds), a landscape painted three years before his death, but still recalling his travels of forty years earlier.<h2>
<a name="Laterworksinoils"></a>Later works in oils</h2>The same subject matter inspired Dadd's oil paintings, which include <span class="italic">The Flight out of Egypt</span> (1849&#150;50; Tate collection); <span class="italic">Mercy: David Spareth Saul's Life</span> (1854; J. Paul Getty Museum, Malibu); <span class="italic">Mother and Child</span> (1860; priv. coll.); two seascapes, <span class="italic">The Diadonus</span> (1861; priv. coll.) and <span class="italic">Sailing Ships</span> (1861; priv. coll.); <span class="italic">Atalanta's Race</span> (<i>c</i>.1877; priv. coll.); and <span class="italic">Italian Wandering Musicians</span> (<i>c</i>.1878; priv. coll.; also replicated in watercolour). He also painted two highly original portraits, <span class="italic">Portrait of Sir Alexander Morison</span> (1852; Scottish National Portrait Gallery, Edinburgh), one of the Bethlem physicians, and <span class="italic">Portrait of a Young Man</span> (1853; Tate collection), and a more conventional <span class="italic">Portrait of Dr William Orange</span> (1875; Broadmoor Hospital, Berkshire). His two acknowledged masterpieces mark his only return to fairy painting. Small paintings, each of which took many years to complete, they are prodigious feats both of imagination and of design, filled with microscopic detail and teeming with myriads of tiny figures amid tapestries of natural plant forms. <span class="italic">Contradiction: Oberon and Titania</span> (1854&#150;8; priv. coll.) was painted for the Bethlem physician superintendent Dr Charles Hood, and <span class="italic">The Fairy Feller's Master-Stroke</span> (&#145;quasi 1855&#150;64&#146;; Tate collection) for the steward George Henry Haydon (it was later owned by the poet Siegfried Sassoon).<h2>
<a name="Lastyearsanddeath"></a>Last years and death</h2>In Broadmoor Dadd's talents found additional outlets, in painting scenery and a drop curtain for the theatre (now des.), as well as murals, furniture, and other decorative items, and in more ephemeral activities such as the production of comic cartoon figures at Christmas, and diagrams and illustrations for lectures and entertainments. Interviewed at the age of sixty, he appeared by this time to have accepted his fate, but still considered it unjust, feeling that society did not understand him. Dark and handsome in his youth, with expressive features, in later years he gave the impression of a scholarly recluse, with a snow-white beard and mild blue eyes gazing benignly from behind spectacles. Throughout the desolate circumstances of his later life he had clung to his identity as an artist, and although his personality was radically changed, insanity had not destroyed his intellect. He retained the delusion that he was subject to the will of Osiris, but after three decades in an asylum he still talked with intelligent interest about painting and the art world, read the <span class="italic">Satires</span> of Juvenal, and played the violin. He died in Broadmoor from consumption on 8 January 1886, and was buried in the cemetery within the hospital grounds.<h2>
<a name="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2>Dadd's work, most of which had been given away in his lifetime and remained in private hands, was largely forgotten until the 1960s. <span class="italic">The Fairy Feller's Master-Stroke</span> was his first painting to become widely known, but the full range of his work did not begin to be appreciated until a retrospective exhibition, &#145;The Late Richard Dadd&#146;, was shown at the Tate Gallery, London, in 1974, and subsequently in Hull, Wolverhampton, and Bristol. A substantial number of his works are in the Bethlem Royal Hospital Museum, Kent, the Tate collection, the Victoria and Albert Museum and British Museum, London, and the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford.<br>
