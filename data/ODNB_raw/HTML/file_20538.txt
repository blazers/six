<span class="headword">O'Devany,  Conor</span>  (<em>c.</em>1535&#150;1612), <span class="occ">Roman Catholic bishop of Down and Connor</span>, was born about 1535, inferred from the general agreement that he was nearly eighty at the time of his death. The names of his father and mother have not been preserved, but their social position can be established. They were the <i>erenagh</i> family of the parish of Raphoe in co. Donegal, the <i>erenagh</i> being a layman who farmed church lands by hereditary right. Inquisitions taken in 1609 in preparation for the plantation of Ulster found the lands of &#145;Tollohedeveny&#146; to be church lands. These were Tulach &Oacute; Dhuibheanaigh (O'Devany's Hill), today shortened to Tully, and it may be presumed that Conor was born there. Before he was twenty years old O'Devany entered the Observant Franciscan friary in the town of Donegal, the Observants being a particularly effective force in a society based on kin groups, a kind of society that sometimes did not fit well into the framework of the territorial parish. Though nothing is known in detail of his personal ministry, his training in the Observant friary of Donegal would have given it a dedicated character.<br>
<br>The papal excommunication of Elizabeth I in 1570 quickly polarized the religious situation in Ireland. O'Devany followed many other Irish clerics to Rome, where he was nominated bishop of Down and Connor on 27 April 1582. With two other Irish bishops he was consecrated on 13 May in the church of Santa Maria dell'Anima. He then returned to his diocese, situated in Gaelic Ulster in the extreme north-east of Ireland. The only detail of his episcopate preserved concerns a synod attended by him and six other bishops in 1587. It had been called to promulgate the decrees of the Council of Trent in the northern ecclesiastical province of Armagh. The grip of the government was tightening only slowly in Gaelic Ulster, but pressure was stepped up because of the threat from the Spanish Armada. Bishop O'Devany was captured. He escaped, but was recaptured, and was imprisoned in Dublin Castle. In a petition for his release in November 1590 he said he had been imprisoned by Lord Deputy Perrot, and therefore before 30 June 1588, when Perrot's successor was sworn in. O'Devany's petition was granted almost immediately. He gave a carefully worded undertaking admitting that he had committed &#145;divers faults worthy of condign punishment&#146; in &#145;matters of religion&#146;, but promised to be of good behaviour in this respect for the future. But when he returned to his diocese in Ulster he found growing resentment at government pressure. In 1593 a number of bishops joined in an appeal for help to Philip II of Spain. It is not known if Conor O'Devany was one of them, or even how many they were.<br>
<br>In 1594 resentment became revolt. Under the cautious leadership of Hugh O'Neill the war lasted for nine years. The leading family in O'Devany's diocese was a collateral O'Neill branch, which took part in the war, but with some reluctance because of having to take orders from Hugh O'Neill and his family. Against this background there is a small piece of direct evidence to suggest that Bishop O'Devany was not deeply involved in war or politics. It is a report to Rome on Irish ecclesiastical affairs, unsigned and undated, but drawn up about 1600 by Peter Lombard, Hugh O'Neill's agent in Rome. He dismissed Conor O'Devany as &#145;a good man indeed, but too guileless [<i>simplicior</i>] to be of any great assistance&#146;  (Archivio Segreto Vaticano, fondo Borghese, III, 124C, fol. 78).<br>
<br>O'Neill was forced to surrender on 30 March 1603. In 1607 most of the Gaelic chiefs of Ulster left Ireland (&#145;the flight of the earls&#146;), and this resulted in the confiscation and plantation of their lands. To secure a parliamentary majority for the crown, new boroughs were then freely created in the planted areas, and intimidatory pressure on the Old English was stepped up. By this time Conor O'Devany was again in prison. Events in his native Ulster had steadily deprived him of protectors, and he was in fact a fugitive when he was captured in the early summer of 1611 and lodged in Dublin Castle. As part of the preparation for parliament the privy council in London suggested to Sir Arthur Chichester in a letter dated 20 August 1611 that it would be well if &#145;some titular bishops could be punished in an exemplary manner&#146; provided it could be made clear that they were not being punished for their religious activities  (<span class="italic">CSP Ire.</span>, <i>1611&#150;14</i>, 96). This implied a trial for treason. There were only two Roman Catholic bishops in Ireland, and O'Devany, a native of Gaelic Ulster, was actually in captivity. He was indicted for treason by a grand jury in January 1612, together with Patrick O'Loughran, one of a number of priests in prison, picked out because he had been personal chaplain to Hugh O'Neill.<br>
<br>They stood trial at the court of king's bench in Dublin on 28 January 1612. No official account of the trial has survived, but there are many accounts from Roman Catholic sources, some deriving directly from eyewitnesses. They agree substantially with one another, and with the known format of trials for treason at the time. In such trials the government took every precaution to secure a favourable verdict. O'Devany pleaded that he was on trial because he was a bishop; that he had confined himself to his ecclesiastical functions during the war; and that in any case there had been a general amnesty. But he and O'Loughran were found guilty and sentenced to be executed as traitors on 1 February.<br>
<br>Again, there are many accounts of the executions, including one from a protestant, Barnaby Rich. The prisoners were drawn on hurdles from the castle to the place of execution, a little hillock about a mile distant on the opposite bank of the Liffey. They were accompanied by large and growing crowds, which must have numbered at least several thousand by the time the gallows was reached. There was no doubt of the sentiments of these crowds, and from time to time they became threatening. When the bishop and the priest had been executed with all the bloody ritual of traitors' deaths there was an unstoppable scramble for relics of those already regarded as martyrs for their religion. O'Devany's head was apparently recovered. The next day the dismembered corpses were buried on the spot. The following night they were exhumed and buried in a city churchyard. Which one it was remained a secret.<br>
<br>The government plan to intimidate the Old English Roman Catholics by executing a bishop went badly wrong. On 6 February, Chichester wrote to Cecil lamenting that the bishop and priest &#145;being lately executed here for treason merely, are notwithstanding &hellip; thought martyrs and adored for saints&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 63/232/8). As a later authority put it succinctly, &#145;O'Devany's death was an event of unexpected importance in the development of the counter-reformation in Ireland&#146;  (Clarke, 209). It stiffened resolve among the Old English electorate. Conor O'Devany and Patrick O'Loughran continued to be venerated as martyrs and on 27 September 1992 they were formally declared blessed by Pope John Paul II.<br>
<br>O'Devany was the compiler of an &#145;index martyrialis&#146;, which he sent to the Jesuit superior Christopher Holywood shortly before his execution. The &#145;index&#146; included the names and dates of death of all the bishops and priests who had been martyred since 1585. Though it has not survived, the names were included by David Rothe in his <span class="italic">Analecta</span>.<br>
