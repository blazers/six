<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Avery,  Thomas</span>  (1813&#150;1894), <span class="occ">scale manufacturer and local politician</span>, was born in 1813, the second son of William Avery (1789&#150;1843), scale maker, and his wife, Elizabeth, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Balden. Thomas and his elder brother, William Henry Avery (1812&#150;1874), were born into a long-established dynasty of Birmingham scale makers; they had six siblings, one brother and five sisters. The Avery business had its origins in an eighteenth-century combination of several makers of steelyards, devices for weighing heavy goods in towns like Birmingham where manufacture and trade flourished. Among these precursors was James Ford (<i>d</i>. 1761), whose business was taken over by a fellow craftsman, William Bridgins Barton; he in turn handed over in 1782 to Thomas Beach (1745&#150;1824), whose sister married a John Avery. Thereafter other marriages bonded the families, many of whose members were employed as steelyard and scale makers, mostly in the expanding Birmingham area. With increasing industrialization, and the arrival of government regulations concerning the provision of accurate means of weighing many varieties of goods, this formerly humble craft developed into one which required new standards of accuracy and innovation.<br>
<br>About 1799 Thomas Beach handed the business over to Joseph Balden (<i>d</i>. 1813), who was married to Beach's niece Mary Avery. Balden died intestate, leaving two young sons. The elder son, failing to keep the business going, conveyed his estate to his cousin and brother-in-law, William Avery, then a mercer and draper, who in 1811 had married Elizabeth Balden. When William Avery inherited in 1841 he was described as a scale-beam maker. He immediately began to stimulate the business, and with his brother Thomas (<i>d</i>. 1824) traded under the name of W. and T. Avery, late T. Beach. By the time of his death in 1843, William Avery's two sons were already in the business. William Henry had married Ann Beach while Thomas married Mary Anne Beilby (1812&#150;1893) in 1842; the couple had no children. Thomas was an active traveller throughout Britain for Averys, which by the time of the 1851 census employed 150 men and numerous boys at its premises in the Digbeth and Moat Lane area of the city. Avery, who was by then living at 142 Highgate, Birmingham, gained a reputation throughout the local trades for his industry and trustworthiness. During a period when local government was suffering from bad management, he was one of several leading citizens who came in with a mission to return it to efficiency. He entered Birmingham council for St Martin's ward, which contained the Avery factories, and in 1864 retired from business before withdrawing his capital and leaving his brother as sole proprietor two years later. Under the efficient management of William Henry Avery and his successors, W. and T. Avery continued to prosper throughout the twentieth century, until taken over by GEC in 1993 and thereafter by the US firm Weigh-Tronix, who since 2000 have traded as Avery Weigh-Tronix.<br>
<br>Avery's main interests now turned to the betterment of his increasingly populous home town, his own aims being supported by Joseph Chamberlain, leader of the council's Liberal faction. In 1868 he became mayor of Birmingham, being elected alderman in 1868, and was again mayor in 1881. After a serious early misjudgement, when he fought to keep the ancient cattle market in the centre of Birmingham, Avery was largely responsible for two significant public benefactions: the acquisition in 1874 of a private waterworks, the development of which under town ownership brought potable water to the townsfolk, and the greater achievement of the provision of a sewage works. In 1877, after a battle against the landowners concerned, a drainage board incorporating Birmingham and surrounding authorities was able to build a sewage farm which discharged purified water into the previously polluted River Tame.<br>
<br>Beyond the council chamber, Avery was a magistrate for the city and the counties of Warwick and Worcester and sat as governor, trustee, or treasurer at the Birmingham and Midland Institute, Mason College, and Spring Hill College, which trained men for the dissenting ministry, and for other local hospitals and institutions. In politics he was a conservative, leaning towards the liberal; he always voted for John Bright as Birmingham MP, and supported the old Liberal policies on the council. By conviction Avery and his wife were lifelong Congregationalists, attending the well-known Carr's Lane Church, although he was never a member of the church. The onset of arteriosclerosis obliged Avery to resign his aldermanship on 4 October 1892. He was immediately presented with the freedom of the city, having to sign the freedom roll in his house, in the presence of Birmingham's mayor and civic officials. His wife died towards the end of 1893; Avery died at his home, Beech Lawn, Church Road, Edgbaston, on 17 February 1894 and was buried on 21 February at the old cemetery, Key Hill. His extensive property in Birmingham went to his nephews, and he made generous bequests to local colleges, hospitals, and institutions.<br>
