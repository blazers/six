<span class="headword">Dalzel <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em>Dalziel]</span>,  Archibald</span>  (1740&#150;1818), <span class="occ">historian and slave trader</span>, was born in Kirkliston, Linlithgowshire, Scotland, on 23 October 1740, the eldest of the five children of William Dalziel (<i>d</i>. 1751) and his wife, Alice Linn. After being educated as a medical doctor in Edinburgh he served in the Seven Years' War as surgeon's mate (1761&#150;2). His life was dogged by a need for money, partly because he helped support his mother and scapegrace brother William. Having been discharged from the navy in January 1763, and not liking medical practice, he told another brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7080/', "Andrew Dalzel")</script>, &#145;Guinea is the only place that I have a probability of raising myself in&#146;  (Akinjogbin, 68). In March he accepted employment as a surgeon by the Company of Merchants Trading to Africa.<br>
<br>Dalziel was stationed at Anoumabu on the Gold Coast, and on account of his meagre salary turned to slave trading. On 26 May 1764 he remarked, &#145;I have at last come a little into the spirit of the slave trade and must own (perhaps it ought to be my shame) that I can now traffick in that way without remorse&#146;  (Akinjogbin, 69). In 1767 he became director of the English fort at Ouidah in the kingdom of Dahomey. Trading with the nearby Dutch and Portuguese, he accumulated capital. However, he aspired to retire in affluence in England, and he departed Ouidah in 1770, made a slave voyage to the West Indies, and returned to England in 1771, possessed of about &pound;2000.<br>
<br>Less affluent than he had anticipated, Dalziel continued in the slave trade. He bought three slave ships, <i>Little Archie</i>, <i>Hannah</i>, and <i>Nancy</i>, and prospered until 1778, when he lost his capital to American privateers. That autumn he declared bankruptcy and altered his name from Dalziel to Dalzel.<br>
<br>During the ensuing thirteen years Dalzel attempted piracy and served as captain of a slave ship, employed by London and Liverpool merchants. The African Committee of Liverpool called him to testify to the privy council in April 1788 when it heard evidence about the slave trade. His testimony minimized mortality on slave ships, asserted that slaves were well fed, and claimed that, while changes in slave ship construction were not necessary, some regulations on behalf of slaves and crew might be adopted. The abolitionist William Wilberforce quoted from Dalzel's testimony in the House of Commons in May 1789: &#145;the trade, says Mr Dalzel, at this time hangs upon a thread, and the smallest matter will overthrow it&#146;  (Rawley, 321).<br>
<br>In 1791 the Company of Merchants Trading to Africa appointed Dalzel governor at Cape Coast Castle, its headquarters on the Gold Coast. In this capacity he resisted Danish efforts to expand territorial possessions and Dutch efforts to monopolize the Portuguese trade. He unsuccessfully urged that the British west African stations be made colonial territories. During the years 1797&#150;1803 the London ship <i>Governor Dalzel</i> made successive voyages from Cape Coast to American destinations.<br>
<br>While Dalzel was in Africa his <span class="italic">The History of Dahomy</span> was published in London in 1793. He drew in part on his experience, but also on William Snelgrave's <span class="italic">A New Account of Guinea</span> (1754), Robert Norris's <span class="italic">Memoirs of the Reign of Bossa Ahadee, King of Dahomy</span> (1789), and others. His <span class="italic">History</span> was both a historical compilation and propaganda against abolition of the slave trade. He argued that the slave trade saved African victims from human sacrifice and slaughter. He also sought to exonerate Europeans from charges that they incited African wars to secure slaves, asserting that Africans had long engaged in wars among themselves. Although it is based on borrowed sources and is biased, the <span class="italic">History</span> remains important for its contents, pleasant style, and influence.<br>
<br>In 1802 Dalzel resigned as governor and returned to England. In his final years he became the owner of the <i>Thames</i>, which voyaged to Africa between 1805 and 1808, and <i>Chalmers</i>, which in 1805 went to Jamaica and in 1806, 1807, and 1808 made voyages from London to Africa.<br>
<br>Although he never married, Dalzel had close associations with three women. In 1794 he referred to &#145;Mrs. D and child&#146; being in &#145;a favourable&#146; way  (Akinjogbin, 76&#150;7). The philanthropist <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7617/', "Elizabeth Dickson (c.1793&#150;1862)")</script> was his daughter. A son, Andr&eacute;, died at Cape Coast Castle on 24 May 1797. In 1800 another son, Edward, went to Africa with Dalzel, employed by the company as a writer, and in 1811 he was living in Malta. Dalzel's life was marked by loyalty to his family. Active as a mariner, shipowner, officer, and historian, he was a significant figure in the last years of the slave trade, and his <span class="italic">History of Dahomy</span> earned for him an enduring place in the trade's history. Information relating to his final years is scarce, though it appears he lived in Malta immediately before his death on the island of Gozo on 1 March 1818.<br>
