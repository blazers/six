<span class="headword">Sorocold,  George</span>  (<em>c.</em>1668&#150;1738?), <span class="occ">engineer</span>, was the son of James Sorocold (1627&#150;1675), a Lancashire gentleman who moved to Derby. Little else is known of Sorocold's life until on 7 December 1684 he married Mary, the daughter of Henry Franceys, a prosperous Derby apothecary. By 1702 they had thirteen children, of whom eight then survived.<br>
<br>The earliest known engineering work undertaken by Sorocold was connected with the supply of water to Macclesfield between 1685 and 1687, and the recasting and rehanging of the bells at All Saints' Church in Derby in 1687. Although he had a varied engineering career, he is best-known for his pioneering work in water supply; and one of his innovations in this area was the introduction of pumps worked by water-wheels which rose and fell in accordance with the level of the stream. In 1693 a patent along these lines was granted to his working colleague, John Hadley, so there is a possibility that it was a joint venture.<br>
<br>Sorocold was particularly associated with waterworks in provincial towns such as Derby, Bridgnorth, Bristol, Deal, King's Lynn, Leeds, Newcastle upon Tyne, Norwich, Portsmouth, Sheffield, and Great Yarmouth; but he also worked in London, improving London Bridge waterworks and the New River, and constructing Marchant's waterworks. At many sites his pumping machinery was adapted to other uses as well, and on occasion put to draining mines, such as at Alloa in 1710. His sole patent, a horse- or water-powered machine for sawing planks, was probably another variation.<br>
<br>Sorocold was more involved in river improvement work than is often realized. His work on the early unimplemented schemes on the River Derwent is well known, but a letter he wrote in 1711, when advising on problems along the lower tidal River Lea, cites his involvement on the River Aire, probably after the death of Hadley in 1701, and on the River Cam a few years later. He expounded a philosophy of river improvement, whereby a series of locks with a fall of only 3 or 4 feet was preferred to fewer locks with larger falls, as the latter were more harmful to mills and meadows. For the non-tidal Lea, which he had surveyed at his own expense in 1702, he made the novel suggestion that it be improved by the construction of several temporary seasonal flash locks, but such recommendations were not implemented.<br>
<br>There is also evidence of Sorocold's involvement in erecting iron forges, and in setting up atmospheric engines, and he had some interest in dock engineering. Statements about his involvement in the construction of Howlands Dock in Surrey cannot be substantiated by contemporary evidence, but he did give advice to the corporation of Liverpool on their first wet dock scheme, a dock built by Thomas Steers. He also erected the mill work at Cotchetts' silk mill at Derby in 1702, an enterprise taken over in 1719 by John Lombe, and then Sir Thomas Lombe. This mill was one of the most important early modern factories. In 1699 Thomas Surbey noted that when Sorocold was showing some gentlemen round the corn mill at Derby waterworks he fell into the mill race and although swept under the water-wheel, was not hurt. However, Daniel Defoe, in his <span class="italic">Tour thro' the Whole Island of Great Britain</span> (1727), reported this accident as having occurred at Lombe's silk mill.<br>
<br>Sorocold made several trips to Scotland between 1710 and 1715, and he assisted John Adair in surveying the route of a proposed canal between the Forth and the Clyde. In 1717 he was described as the &#145;ingenious, unfortunate, mathematician&#146;  (Williamson, 45), but it is not known why. His engineering skills were undoubtedly valued by his contemporaries: he was characterized as &#145;one of the two engineers of this age who never failed in what they undertook because they considered perfection and success of their work first and their profit afterwards&#146;  (private information).<br>
<br>The date of Sorocold's death is not known, but the lease to Derby waterworks was still in his name as late as 1738.<br>
