<span class="headword">Barron,  (Arthur) Oswald</span>  (1868&#150;1939), <span class="occ">genealogist and heraldist</span>, was born in West Ham, Essex, on 3 January 1868, the second of three sons (there were two daughters) of Henry Stracey Barron (1838&#150;1918), consulting mechanical engineer and one-time chief engineer of the Imperial Ottoman Arsenal in Constantinople, and his wife, Harriet Marshall (1838&#150;1918). He was of the sixth generation in descent from James Barron, gentleman, of late seventeenth-century London. His great-great-grandfather Francis was ironmonger to the king; his grandfather Francis William was master of the Ironmongers' Company in 1864; and his uncle Edward Jackson Barron, a distinguished antiquary. He was educated in London at the Merchant Taylors' School&#151;the &#145;Blue Coat School&#146; (1877&#150;1883), but circumstances prevented him from going up to Oxford University.<br>
<br>After a few temporary appointments in private service, Barron took employment with the <span class="italic">Evening News</span> of London, and for some thirty years contributed a daily article to that newspaper under the byline &#145;The Londoner&#146;, and it is said that many bought the paper simply to read him. In his early twenties he became romantically involved with <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/31919/', "E. (Elizabeth) Nesbit (1858&#150;1924)")</script>, the famous author of children's stories, and collaborated with her in several fields. Their joint book <span class="italic">The Butler in Bohemia</span> (1894) was dedicated to their mutual friend Rudyard Kipling. Barron's deep attachment to Nesbit ceased in 1899 when he married Hilda Leonora Florence Sanders, a member of an old Northamptonshire family, but his influence outlasted his departure and he is widely credited with having provided the plot for <span class="italic">The Railway Children</span>, which finally appeared in 1906.<br>
<br>His early interest in fiction aside, Barron's abiding passions were heraldry and genealogy. In time he was to be acknowledged as the chief living authority on these subjects. His first contribution of significance had, in fact, appeared in 1895 when his annotated edition of the parliamentary roll of <i>c</i>.1312 was published in <span class="italic">The Genealogist</span>. This was followed in 1898 by <span class="italic">Benolt's Visitation of Berkshire in 1532</span>, and in 1901 by <span class="italic">The St George's Kalendar</span>, several copies of which were ordered by the king.<br>
<br>However, it was with his editorship of and contributions to <span class="italic">The Ancestor</span> (1902&#150;5) that Barron set his stamp upon his chosen subjects. Each issue of this quarterly review ran to some 300 pages, and in every one Barron's articles stripped away the pretensions of earlier writers&#151;their &#145;well-springs of engaging nonsense&#146;&#151;and gradually put the study of heraldry and, indeed, genealogy, onto proper historical bases, shorn of myth, legend, snobbery, and mere whimsy. The last issue of <span class="italic">The Ancestor</span> appeared in January 1905, to enable Barron to concentrate on the demanding task (in addition to his daily <span class="italic">Evening News</span> column) of editing the genealogical and armorial sections of the <span class="roman">Victoria county history</span>; his own magisterial quartos, dealing with Northamptonshire county families, were published in 1906. His article on heraldry in the 1911 edition of the <span class="italic">Encyclopaedia Britannica</span> remains one of the best and most erudite introductions to the subject. From 1916 to 1919 he served in the Inns of Court reserve regiment with the rank of lieutenant, and in 1920 he was awarded the M&eacute;daille du Roi Albert for his services to Belgians in distress.<br>
<br>After the war Barron continued his heraldic studies in addition to writing for the <span class="italic">Evening News</span>, but he never produced the great comprehensive book on armory which might have been expected of him. In spite of his sometimes prickly relationship with the heraldic establishment&#151;his earlier views that men could assume arms at will rather than having them properly granted had caused much controversy&#151;his knowledge and deep sincerity won him respect and he was increasingly welcomed in official circles, particularly in the College of Arms. He had already been a gold staff officer (usher) at the coronation of King George V in 1911, but his final reward was to be appointed Maltravers herald-extraordinary in time for the coronation of King George VI in 1937 and thus to play a time-honoured role in the ceremony.<br>
<br>Barron's marriage to Hilda Sanders, which produced a daughter, Yolanda Wilmot Philipse Barron, lasted until his death at 22 Gay Street, Bath, on 24 September 1939. He and his wife had been staying with relations in that city and his passing was sudden and unexpected. He was cremated at Arnos Vale crematorium in Bristol on 27 September, and his ashes taken to Hammersmith, London, where the couple lived. His papers were subsequently deposited with the Society of Antiquaries of London, of which he had been a fellow since 1901. He was a man held in affectionate respect by his peers, and his scholarship had brought new realism into the whole fields of heraldry and genealogy.<br>
