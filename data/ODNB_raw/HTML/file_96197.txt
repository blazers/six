<span class="headword">Cummings <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Halverstadt]</span>,  Constance</span>  (1910&#150;2005), <span class="occ">actress</span>, was born on 15 May 1910 in Seattle, Washington, USA, the younger child and only daughter of Dallas Vernon Halverstadt, lawyer, and his wife, Kate Logan, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Cummings, who had trained as a concert soprano. She was educated at St Nicholas's Girls' School in Seattle. Her parents separated when she was ten, and her mother, who had never fulfilled her own ambitions, transferred her aspirations to her daughter. She never saw her father again.<br>
<br>Constance had wanted to be a classical dancer, but at the age of sixteen made her d&eacute;but (as Constance Cummings) in a walk-on part as a prostitute in <span class="italic">Seventh Heaven</span> (1926), with the San Diego Stock Company. She moved to New York, and in 1928 made her Broadway d&eacute;but in the chorus line of the George and Ira Gershwin musical <span class="italic">Treasure Girl</span>, which starred Gertrude Lawrence. She was also in the chorus of <span class="italic">The Little Show</span> (1929) at the Music Box, and took over the role of the showgirl Miss Rixey in George S. Kaufman and Ring Lardner's Tin Pan Alley musical comedy <span class="italic">June Moon</span>, on its post-Broadway tour (1930). Her dazzling looks caught the eye of the film mogul Sam Goldwyn, who brought her to Hollywood to star opposite Ronald Colman in <span class="italic">The Devil to Pay!</span> (1930), only for her to be replaced at the last minute by Loretta Young. Colman, however, helped her find an agent, and the following year she made her d&eacute;but at Columbia Pictures, in <span class="italic">The Criminal Code</span>, a well-received prison drama directed by Howard Hawks and starring Walter Huston. For the next four years she worked exclusively in films. The most notable were <span class="italic">American Madness</span> (1932), directed by Frank Capra, <span class="italic">Movie Crazy</span> (1932) with Harold Lloyd, and <span class="italic">Night after Night</span> (also 1932) with George Raft and, making her screen d&eacute;but, Mae West. Her last film in Hollywood before moving to England was a comedy-whodunit with Robert Young, <span class="italic">Remember Last Night?</span> (1935).<br>
<br>In Hollywood Cummings had met the British playwright <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/31355/', "Benn Wolfe Levy (1900&#150;1973)")</script>, who was there as a screenwriter. He was the son of Octave Levy, a wealthy wool broker, and his wife, Nannie Joseph. They were married on 3 July 1933, and while on their honeymoon in Venice she received an offer to film in England. She won a legal battle with Columbia Pictures that enabled her to make the move, and thereafter her career and family life were largely centred on the United Kingdom. Her husband was active in political circles, and from 1945 to 1950 served as Labour MP for Eton and Slough. They had a son and a daughter.<br>
<br>Cummings made her London stage d&eacute;but in 1934 in <span class="italic">Sour Grapes</span>, at the Apollo Theatre, and shortly after returned to New York and had a big personal success in Samuel Raphaelson's comedy <span class="italic">Accent on Youth</span> at the Plymouth. She also started to appear in plays, mostly boulevard comedies, written for her, and directed by, her husband&#151;<span class="italic">Young Madame Conti</span> (1936), <span class="italic">The Jealous God</span> (1939), and <span class="italic">Clutterbuck</span> (1946) among them&#151;and she developed a sophisticated comedic skill, elegant and with a light touch, that dominated her acting choices until the more demanding roles of her later years. Levy also directed his wife in his own adaptation of Flaubert's <span class="italic">Madame Bovary</span> (1937), in New York, and the following year in London she had a big success as Mrs Chipping in <span class="italic">Goodbye, Mr Chips</span> (1938), at the Shaftesbury. In 1939 she joined the Old Vic Company, then in wartime exile in Buxton and Streatham Hill, to play Juliet, opposite the Romeo of Robert Donat, and Shaw's Saint Joan, but neither production was considered a great success. She had better luck in a revival of Oliver Goldsmith's <span class="italic">Good Natur'd Man</span>, in another Raphaelson play, <span class="italic">Skylark</span> (1942), and in Robert Sherwood's <span class="italic">The Petrified Forest</span> (1943).<br>
<br>On film Cummings and her fellow American Robert Montgomery were oddly cast as Dorothy L. Sayers's quintessentially English sleuths, Harriet Vane and Lord Peter Wimsey, in an adaptation of <span class="italic">Busman's Honeymoon</span> (1940). She played an American ally in <span class="italic">The Foreman Went to France</span> (1942) and was stylishly good as Ruth, the upper-middle-class second wife of Rex Harrison's Charles Condomine in David Lean's film of No&euml;l Coward's <span class="italic">Blithe Spirit</span> (1945). She had made her television d&eacute;but in 1938, as Roxane in a live broadcast of <span class="italic">Cyrano de Bergerac</span>, with Leslie Banks and James Mason, and although television and film were to offer her fewer, and less satisfying, opportunities than the theatre, she did make some notable appearances on television, including in <span class="italic">The Scream</span> (1953) with Douglas Fairbanks junior, an adaptation of Scott Fitzgerald's <span class="italic">The Last Tycoon</span> (1959), and in televised versions of two of her later stage successes, <span class="italic">Long Day's Journey into Night</span> (1973) and <span class="italic">Wings</span> (1983). On film she had good roles as a movie star in Joseph Losey's <span class="italic">The Intimate Stranger</span> (1956), and was wonderfully unsympathetic as Mrs Barrow, the American efficiency expert murderously pursued by Peter Sellers's mild-mannered accountant, in Charles Crichton's <span class="italic">The Battle of the Sexes</span> (1959).<br>
<br>On stage in London Cummings showed evidence of her emotional capabilities in Clifford Odets's <span class="italic">Winter Journey</span> (1952) with Michael Redgrave, in Joseph Kramm's <span class="italic">The Shrike</span> (1953) with Sam Wanamaker, and in her husband's <span class="italic">The Rape of the Belt</span> (1957, and in New York in 1960). At the Oxford Playhouse the director Frank Hauser encouraged her to increase her range still further, first as Aristophanes' Lysistrata (1957), and then as the sadistic lesbian In&egrave;s in Sartre's <span class="italic">Huis clos</span> (1962), which she played in a double bill with Max Beerbohm's <span class="italic">A Social Success</span>. She was especially fine, taking over from Uta Hagen, as Martha in the London production of Edward Albee's <span class="italic">Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?</span> (1964), opposite Ray McAnally. Cummings was never averse to venturing outside the West End, where she was able to tackle some great roles in plays by great writers&#151;Tennessee Williams's <span class="italic">The Milk Train Doesn't Stop Here Any More</span> in Glasgow; G. B. Shaw's <span class="italic">Mrs Warren's Profession</span> in Bristol and Vienna; Edward Albee's <span class="italic">All Over</span> in Brighton; Somerset Maugham's <span class="italic">The Circle</span> in Guildford; and Friedrich D&uuml;rrenmatt's <span class="italic">The Visit</span> in Coventry.<br>
<br>In 1969 Cummings played Gertrude in Tony Richardson's production of <span class="italic">Hamlet</span> with Nicol Williamson, in London and New York, and in 1971 joined the National Theatre Company, where she gave some good performances in poorly received productions&#151;as Volumnia to the Coriolanus of Anthony Hopkins, in Bertolt Brecht's version of Shakespeare; as Leda in Laurence Olivier's production of <span class="italic">Amphitryon 38</span>, by Jean Giraudoux and S. N. Behrman; and as Agave in Euripides' <span class="italic">The Bacchae</span> (1973). The National also gave her what was perhaps her greatest opportunity, as the morphine-addicted Mary, wife of Olivier's blistering James Tyrone, in Michael Blakemore's production of Eugene O'Neill's <span class="italic">Long Day's Journey into Night</span> (1971). Cummings's delicate and fragile performance won huge plaudits and the Evening Standard drama award as best actress.<br>
<br>Further success followed, as Madame Ranevsky in <span class="italic">The Cherry Orchard</span> (1973) at the National, and as the widowed matriarch in A. R. Gurney's <span class="italic">Children</span> (1974), which Cummings performed shortly after the death of her own husband. On returning to New York she triumphed in a captivating solo performance as Emily Stilson, a former aviator and wing-walker struggling to recover from a cerebral haemorrhage, in Arthur Kopit's memory-play <span class="italic">Wings</span> (1979). She considered this to be her greatest performance. The public and critics agreed, and she won the Antoinette Perry (Tony) and Drama Desk awards. She also played the role at the National Theatre in London, and in 1982 made her final appearance in New York as the formidable Mrs St Maugham in an off-Broadway revival of Enid Bagnold's <span class="italic">The Chalk Garden</span>, with Irene Worth as the governess. In 1994 she played the part again at the King's Head, a tiny pub theatre in London, then toured in a one-woman show as Fanny Kemble, and made her final stage appearance as Maman in <span class="italic">Uncle Vanya</span> (1996) at the Chichester Festival Theatre, finishing a career that had started seventy years before as a chorus girl on Broadway.<br>
<br>After her husband's death Cummings maintained their country home at Cote House in the Oxfordshire village of Cote, a 600 acre dairy farm where they bred Friesians, and a house in Chelsea designed by Walter Gropius. She later moved to The Old Cow House, Cote. She supported a number of political and charitable causes, including Amnesty, Liberty, and the Actors' Charitable Trust. She was appointed CBE in 1974. She died at Wardington House nursing home, Wardington, Oxfordshire, on 23 November 2005, and was survived by her two children, Jonathan and Jemima.<br>
