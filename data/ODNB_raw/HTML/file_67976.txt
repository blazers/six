<span class="headword">McIan <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Whitaker]</span>,  Frances Matilda <span class="st"> [Fanny]</span></span>  (<em>c.</em>1814&#150;1897), <span class="occ">painter and design school superintendent</span>, was born at 20 Westgate Street, Bath, and baptized on 21 June 1820 at St Mary's Chapel, Queen Square, Bath. She was the third of five children of William Whitaker (<i>d</i>. 1836) and Sarah Hawkins (<i>d</i>. 1849), cabinet-makers. Nothing is known of her education.<br>
<br>Whitaker eloped with <a href="#cosubject_17538">Robert Ronald McIan [<i>see below</i>]</a> on 21 February 1831 and married him (as Robert Jones, his stage name), at Sts Philip and Jacob, Bristol. She subsequently taught him to paint, and they often mirrored each other's subjects: for instance her <span class="italic">Slave's Dream</span> (exh. RA, 1847) depicted a &#145;vision&#146; as did his <span class="italic">Scene in Lochaber</span>, exhibited at the British Institution the same year. W. P. Frith also records watching Fanny teach John Leech to paint in oils in their studio. She first exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1836, a portrait, <span class="italic">Red Star of the Evening and Diving Mouse</span>, co-performers in the play <span class="italic">Rifle-Shot</span> with her husband. But her first success came in 1837 with <span class="italic">The Escape of Alaster Macdonald</span>, exhibited at the Society of British Artists. In 1842 she presented Charles Dickens with <span class="italic">Nell and the Widow</span>, a watercolour. He thanked her with a bound copy of <span class="italic">The Old Curiosity Shop</span>, writing that she had &#145;beautifully perpetuated&#146; it  (<span class="italic">Letters of Charles Dickens</span>, 3.4). She also illustrated F. B. C.'s <span class="italic">Quadruped's Picnic</span> for Dickens's son. Other illustrations were made for <span class="italic">The Book of British Ballads</span> (1842) and <span class="italic">Sketches of Irish Character</span> (1844), edited and written by her friends Mr and Mrs S. C. Hall.<br>
<br>In October 1842 Fanny McIan became the first superintendent of the Female School of Design, Somerset House: her &#145;qualifications as an artist, and fitness in every respect for the situation&#146; were considered &#145;very satisfactory&#146;, despite possible objections as to her husband's connections with the stage  (<span class="italic">Minutes of the Council of the Government School of Design, 1836&#150;1847</span>, 1.120). The <span class="italic">Art Union</span> praised her for her &#145;energy of mind&#146;, &#145;amiability of temper&#146;, and &#145;uprightness of conduct&#146;, and felt her eminently suited to teach middle-class girls to design for industry and thus enlarge the field of employment for women  (<span class="italic">Art Union</span>, 4, 1842, 82).<br>
<br>In the summers of 1843 and 1844 Fanny McIan visited S&egrave;vres, &#145;to improve her knowledge of ornamental art in order to teach porcelain painting to her students&#146;, and subsequently reported in detail to the school's council  (<span class="italic">Minutes of the Council of the Government School of Design, 1836&#150;1847</span>, 2.73&#150;5). Ill health caused frequent absences from school: on one such occasion in 1843 William Macready, the actor, was touched to find her at home painting <span class="italic">The Empty Cradle</span> (exh. RA, 1843). She had no children. Despite turmoil at the Male School, Somerset House, and frustrations at the Female School, McIan determinedly pursued her way, successfully encouraging her students to win prizes against their male counterparts. Sarah King Peter, when founding the first American Female School of Design in Philadelphia in 1848, consulted her. That year the London Female School was &#145;unceremoniously&#146; moved to a soap manufacturers' premises in the Strand; Dickens criticized the poor conditions. Fanny gave a spirited account of these, and her aims for the school, to the select committee of 1849. Under her leadership the Female School gained several prizes at the Great Exhibition of 1851  (Great Exhibition, <span class="italic">Reports of the Juries</span>, section III, class 18, exhibits 85, 86, 94, 97) and in 1852 the students embroidered the duke of Wellington's funeral pall.<br>
<br>Throughout her time at the school McIan continued to exhibit. <span class="italic">Soldiers' Wives Awaiting the Results of Battle</span> (priv. coll.) was shown at the &#145;Free exhibition&#146;, Hyde Park, in 1849 and Henry Cole, in his capacity as head of the department of practical art, noticed her ambitious last work, <span class="italic">Highland Emigration, 1852</span> (exh. Royal Scottish Academy, 1852) while visiting the relocated Female School at Gower Street. On 7 April 1854 Fanny was elected an honorary associate of the Royal Scottish Academy (proposed by Robert Scott Lauder, seconded by J. No&euml;l Paton). With members of her school she made an important contribution to the first exhibition of the Society of Female Artists in 1857.<br>
<br>From 1853 on, Fanny's husband Robert McIan began to suffer a painful mental illness. Despite school duties she nursed him with such devotion that at his death in December 1856 friends feared for her own life. In May 1857 she retired, with a state pension of &pound;100 per annum, but remained a lifelong patron of the school. She was married, briefly, to Richard James Unwin (<i>d</i>. 1864), a man of independent means, of London and Argyll, and instead of painting collected objets d'art. She died, intestate, at 14 Cambridge Street, Edgware Road, London, on 7 April 1897 and was buried in Kensal Green cemetery.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_17538"></a><span class="headword">Robert Ronald McIan</span>  (1803?&#150;1856), <span class="occ">actor and illustrator</span>, was by his own account the son of Robert McIan, a sheep farmer of Inverness-shire. Baptized a Roman Catholic, he was educated in Liverpool and Shropshire. He abandoned apprenticeships to become, as Mr Jones, an actor and scene-painter in Glasgow, and afterwards toured with Belville Penley's company. In 1827 he joined the Theatre Royal, Bath, where he made his d&eacute;but as Dougal in <span class="italic">Rob Roy</span>: Sir Walter Scott thought &#145;the character stepped from the novel on to the stage&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Era</span>, 11).<br>
<br>On moving to London in 1834 &#145;Jones&#146; claimed the name Ronald McIan, and descent from the McIans of Glencoe. A passionate highlander and member of the Club of True Highlanders, he pursued careers in acting and painting with equal energy and enthusiasm, making his London d&eacute;but as Lo Zingaro at the English Opera House on 6 October 1834 and following it with <span class="italic">Rifle-Shot</span>. On the stage he was noted for his agility and swordsmanship.<br>
<br>Between 1835 and 1842 McIan divided his acting career between the English Opera House, Theatre Royal Covent Garden, and Drury Lane. The summers of 1841&#150;3 were spent directing and acting at the Adelphi, Edinburgh. Dickens, seeing him there as Robin Oig in <span class="italic">Twa' Drovers</span>, thought him &#145;quite wonderful, and most affecting&#146;  (letter to John Forster, 30 June 1841, <span class="italic">Letters of Charles Dickens</span>, ed. Dexter, 2.316). The end of McIan's stage career in 1843 coincided with the death by drowning of his fellow actor, Elton. Through McIan's intervention Dickens became chairman of the Elton Fund for his orphans, though Dickens considered McIan as secretary as &#145;unfurnished in two commodities: judgment and discretion&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters of Charles Dickens</span>, ed. Dexter, 1.561).<br>
<br>From 1835 to 1856 McIan was a frequent exhibitor at the Royal Academy and elsewhere. He was an exquisite colourist, and an early painter of scenes from highland history, <span class="italic">A Highland Feud</span> (exh. British Institution, 1843; Tatton Park, Cheshire), and <span class="italic">A Highland Coronach</span> (exh. Royal Scottish Academy, 1850) being two examples. His illustrations for <span class="italic">Clans of the Scottish Highlands</span>, and <span class="italic">Gaelic Gatherings, or, The Highlanders at Home</span>, by James Logan (first published in parts, 1843&#150;7 and 1847&#150;9, and later bound) are his best-known work. He also illustrated Eliza Ogilvy's <span class="italic">Highland Minstrelsy</span> and books by Mr and Mrs S. C. Hall. S. C. Hall gave an entertaining account of McIan's enthusiastic guiding during tours of the highlands  (Hall, <span class="italic">Retrospect of a Long Life</span>). McIan assisted his wife at the Female School of Design between 1847 and 1852. Though he was made an associate of the Royal Scottish Academy in 1852, rules of residence thwarted his hopes of becoming a full academician.<br>
<br>McIan's last paintings were military in character: four major ones showing the 79th Cameron Highlanders on duty in Edinburgh, 1852, were commissioned by Colonel the Hon. Lauderdale Maule (Regimental Museum, Fort George, Inverness-shire). Maule's death in the Crimea before their exhibition at the Royal Scottish Academy in 1855 coincided with the onset of McIan's own painful mental illness. Despite it, in 1855 he successfully designed new uniforms for the Ross-shire militia (Regimental Museum, Fort George, Inverness-shire). He died at his home, 4 Heath Mount, Hampstead, London, on 13 December 1856, leaving estate of &pound;1000, and was buried at Highgate cemetery. His friends mourned a &#145;warm-hearted honourable man&#146;  (<span class="italic">Literary Gazette</span>, 20 Dec 1856, 1025).<br>
