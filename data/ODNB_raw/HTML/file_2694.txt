<span class="headword">Blount, Sir  Thomas</span>  (<em>b. </em>after 1348, <em>d.</em> 1400), <span class="occ">knight</span>, was the first son of Sir Thomas Blount (<i>c</i>.1321&#150;<i>c</i>.1407), of Compton Valence, Dorset, and Kingston Blount, Oxfordshire. Blount's mother, Joan, was the daughter of Sir Edmund Hakluyt of Longford, Herefordshire, and widow of Reynold Fitzherbert of Midsomer Norton, Somerset. His other principal estate was at Laverstock, Wiltshire.<br>
<br>Blount was knighted before 1374, probably for service overseas, although he failed in his undertaking to cross the channel in the retinue of John, duke of Brittany. He joined the household of Richard II, who made him a personal gift of 20 marks in May 1383, and paid him 40 marks a year later for escorting a French ambassador from Berkhamsted Castle to Scotland and then via London to Calais. As a knight of the chamber Blount took part in Richard's expedition to Scotland in 1385, following which he was granted a wardship as he &#145;had scanty means of support&#146;. However, he soon surrendered this in exchange for a life annuity of &pound;40. In March 1386 he received &pound;20 for additional services to the king, and was then employed on the defence of Calais under Sir Thomas Percy (afterwards earl of Worcester).<br>
<br>In 1387 Blount secured the hand of Isabel, daughter of John, second Lord Botetourt, and widow of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25037/', "Sir Hugh Seagrave")</script>, the former treasurer of England, but although this was a prestigious match it did not bring him much in the way of material benefits. Blount was expelled from court by the lords appellant in January 1388, but escaped the harsh judgments meted out by the Merciless Parliament on several of his colleagues, and was reinstated in the chamber as soon as the king regained the political initiative. In 1391 he was sent to Paris as Richard's personal messenger to Charles VI, and in 1394 he took part in the royal expedition to Ireland. Along with the king's councillor, Sir Henry Green, he was returned for Wiltshire to the parliament of September 1397, which brought to fruition Richard's plans for revenge on his enemies. Yet although his election may have been the outcome of a deliberate policy to secure seats in this parliament for the king's supporters, Blount was qualified to represent the county through property brought by his second marriage (which had taken place by October 1394), to Joan (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1344), niece and heir of John Tudworth of Laverstock, and widow of Sir Hugh Cheyne of Rolleston, Leicestershire.<br>
<br>Blount's annuity was confirmed by Henry IV in November 1399, but he never accepted the deposition of Richard II, to whom he remained devoted, and joined the conspirators headed by the earls of Kent, Salisbury, and Huntingdon, who on 17 December at the abbey house in Westminster plotted to seize the new king while he was at Windsor for the feast of Epiphany. The plot miscarried and the traitors were forced to flee to Cirencester. There, after a fight, Blount was arrested. He was taken to Oxford for trial in the marshal's court, and sentenced to execution on 12 January. The most graphic contemporary account of his death, in which, after suffering hanging and evisceration, he responded to the taunts of Sir Thomas Erpingham with a declaration of his willingness to die in the service of his sovereign lord, Richard II, should be discounted as an untrustworthy source. Similarly, the chroniclers' descriptions of him as &#145;un sage baron&#146; (&#145;a wise lord&#146;) or &#145;un bon chevalier&#146; (&#145;a good knight&#146;) perhaps reveal more about their own bias than about Blount himself. His estates were forfeited to the crown, but not for long, for the manor of Blatchington, Sussex, which he had held for life since 1393 soon reverted to the heirs of his half-brother Sir Edmund Fitzherbert, and that of Kingston Blount, which he had leased from his father for &pound;20 p.a., returned to the latter. His widow reclaimed her property in 1401 after her third marriage, to Thomas Linford. Blount died childless; his heir was his brother, Hugh.<br>
