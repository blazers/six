<span class="headword">Jolly,  George</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1613, <em>d.</em> in or before 1683), <span class="occ">actor and theatre manager</span>, was baptized at St Luke's Church on 23 March 1613 as the son of Ralph Gellye, whose origins and occupation are unknown. George Jolly's career had three distinct stages. In July 1640 he was living in the house of the actor Matthew Smith in Whitecross Street, where his son John was baptized. The baby, &#145;sonne of George Jolly Player&#146;, died a week later and was buried at St Giles Cripplegate. Like Smith, Jolly was undoubtedly a member of Prince Charles's Men, then acting at the Fortune playhouse, close to Whitecross Street, but his name does not appear among any surviving records of the company, and he must have still been a junior member of the troupe when playing ceased in 1642.<br>
<br>At some time before 1647 Jolly moved to continental Europe, and appears to have remained there until 1660, travelling considerable distances as the leader of a variety of acting troupes. Initially he may have joined his colleagues who had gone to perform for the English royalist community in exile, first at The Hague, then in Paris, between 1644 and 1646. This group has been called Prince Charles's Men, since it sought the patronage of the exiled prince; it certainly included two of Jolly's fellows from the Fortune company. By April 1647, however, Jolly had emerged as head of a troupe of fourteen players perhaps capable of playing in a variety of languages, but working principally, from 1648 onwards, in German. Jolly's theatrical activity in Germany for the next twelve years ranks among the most important contributions of the &#145;Englische Kom&ouml;dianten&#146; to the early German stage, a cultural exchange which had begun in the early 1590s but had been interrupted by the Thirty Years' War.<br>
<br>In 1647 the company appears to have been in Brussels, then at Bruges, and in spring 1648 at Cologne, where they played for three months, moving to Frankfurt am Main in August. Early in 1649 they returned to Cologne; by October they were in Danzig, and by December in Sweden, returning to Danzig in August 1650. Throughout the 1650s Frankfurt and the surrounding area formed the base for Jolly's touring enterprises, chiefly in the southern German-speaking territories. His company included a growing number of native German actors, and by 1654 actresses; at the same date he advertised plays and operas produced with Italianate scenery. Most records of his playing are connected with annual town fairs and festivals, but he occasionally performed for the nobility. By November 1650 he had acted before the emperor Ferdinand III, and again in May 1653 his company entertained the imperial court in Vienna; in September 1655 he played before the visiting Prince Charles at Frankfurt, and it seems likely that he also played at the elector's court in Heidelberg: Elector Karl Ludwig von der Pfalz (Charles Lewis) was a cousin of Prince Charles and the brother of Prince Rupert, who resided in Mainz after 1652. It was probably Jolly's troupe which played Gryphius's German tragedy <span class="italic">Carolus Stuardus</span> near Frankfurt in 1656. The play dramatizes the trial and execution of King Charles I.<br>
<br>Jolly's reputation as a strolling manager was that of an irascible and violent man: two of his German actors made official complaints of assault at his hands, and he was expelled from Nuremberg in 1660 as the result of a quarrel. Of his personal life at this period there are very few indications. In appealing for permission to stay in Frankfurt in the winter of 1657&#150;8 he claimed that his wife was very sick; it may be doubted whether this woman was the mother of the child born in London seventeen years earlier, but late in 1659 Jolly's second known child was baptized, in Nuremberg: the mother was recorded as Maria di Roy of Utrecht, perhaps one of the German-speaking actresses of the troupe.<br>
<br>Jolly returned to England late in 1660, and in December was granted a royal licence to form an acting company, in addition to the two led by Sir William Davenant and Thomas Killigrew. The licence put Jolly in a remarkably strong position in the new theatrical world, especially when one considers both his obscurity before 1642 and his social status relative to the two courtiers who were given charge of the other companies. He must have been able to argue, or had patrons to argue, that his theatrical enterprises in Europe had had some significance in supporting the royalist cause. Over the next two years Jolly played at both the Cockpit in Drury Lane and the Salisbury Court playhouses; among his repertory was at least one old play, Marlowe's <span class="italic">Doctor Faustus</span>. Killigrew and Davenant sought to maintain their joint monopoly on London theatre by buying the royal licence from Jolly, at the cost of &pound;4 per week to be paid to him throughout his life. An agreement to this effect was signed at the very end of 1662, immediately following which Jolly obtained a licence to form a provincial company&#151;a venture which he may already have begun at Cambridge in 1662. By April 1663, however, his company was playing at the King's Arms in Norwich, where it remained until September, presenting a repertory of pre-war plays by Middleton, Ford, Fletcher, Massinger, and others. During 1664 the arrangement with Davenant and Killigrew collapsed, and Jolly resumed playing in London, at the Cockpit. In 1667 Killigrew contrived to have Jolly's 1660 patent recalled, but Jolly evaded compliance: warrants for his arrest were issued in April 1667 and again in January 1668, when he was acting in the company of John Russell, Paul Ryemes, and Peter Gryen. As a temporary settlement of the dispute with the other patentees Jolly was given supervision of the Nursery, a training school and theatre for young actors, with an income to be based on the company's performances. Jolly's control would appear to have been largely managerial, with the performers under the direction of Thomas Bedford, and after 1669 of John Perin.<br>
<br>Jolly remained involved in touring, however. He received permission to play in Norwich in September 1669, and his players seem to have stayed there for three months. Following Killigrew's appointment as master of the revels in April 1673 there was a further dispute about Jolly's position at the Nursery. Probably in the summer of 1674 Jolly lodged a complaint that Killigrew was denying him the money due to him from the 1662 agreement and the arrangements derived from it. The document speaks of the ruin of the complainant and his family&#151;a wife and an unspecified number of children. No further records of Jolly's life and affairs survive; by March 1683 at the latest he was dead, when, at Norwich, John Coysh claimed to hold the succession to Jolly's patent to act.<br>
