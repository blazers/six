<span class="headword">Stoker,  Robert Burdon</span>  (1859&#150;1919), <span class="occ">shipowner</span>, was born at Westoe, South Shields, on 23 May 1859, the son of Robert Stoker, a sailmaker's agent, and his wife, Sarah, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Burdon. He was the descendant of a Dutch soldier who had arrived in England in 1688, in the service of Wiliam of Orange. Educated at Liverpool College, in 1878 he entered a shipping house in Liverpool and in 1882 joined Christopher Furness (1852&#150;1912) in the firm of Furness Withy &amp; Co. Ltd, which had been established in 1878 at West Hartlepool. He married Catherine Alice, daughter of Thomas Smith, a provision agent, in 1885: they had two sons and two daughters.<br>
<br>Stoker's competence led Furness to appoint him managing director of a new company, Manchester Liners Ltd, registered on 3 May 1898. Its capital of &pound;350,000 was raised with some difficulty, half having to take the form of 5 per cent preference shares. The new shipping line was formed by Furness and J. K. Bythell, chairman of the Manchester Ship Canal Company, as the inevitable corollary to the creation of the ship canal itself because established shipowners refused to entrust their ocean-going vessels to the hazards, delays, and costs of a 35 mile inland and locked navigation. Stoker began operations with chartered vessels, but ordered seven new 13 knot cargo liners, designed to suit the dimensions of the canal and equipped with telescopic topmasts which could be lowered when passing beneath the bridges spanning the waterway. The purchase of the new fleet was financed by the issue of 4.5 per cent debentures in London. The first custom-built vessel for Manchester Liners was named <i>Manchester City</i>: it arrived in Manchester docks on 16 January 1899, and carried the name of its home port across the Atlantic, as did all the later vessels of the line.<br>
<br>The ship canal had been built to the same depth as the Suez Canal in order to link the Lancashire cotton industry to its export markets in Asia. Manchester Liners made no attempt to establish a service to Asian ports: operations began with a transatlantic service to the grain port of Montreal. That pioneer venture represented a remarkable gamble because the north Atlantic routes had become the most competitive in the whole world of shipping. It succeeded only because of the boom in shipping freights created by the South African War, the full support of the Manchester corporation, and the grant of a subsidy by the Canadian government after two directors of the canal company, Alderman J. W. Southern (1840&#150;1909) and Sir Bosdin Leech (1836&#150;1912), visited Ottawa, and two Canadian ministers inspected the ship canal. The Montreal service could be maintained only during the ice-free months of summer, and was supplemented by a winter service to St John's and Halifax. A secondary service was begun from 1899 to the cotton port of New Orleans, and was extended to call at Philadelphia in 1901. A great stimulus was given to the direct import to Manchester of grain, cattle, and cotton. The distributive functions of the new post were notably enhanced, and a provision trade association, independent of Liverpool, was formed in 1899. The import trade was established upon a firm basis, raising Manchester from the status of twelfth importing port in 1898 to that of fourth in 1903. Stoker proved to be less successful in the development of exports from Manchester. He did, however, enlarge the share of British shipping in Canada's foreign trade, and extended the main service downriver to Quebec in 1902. His most constructive achievement was to refute the criticisms voiced by outside shipowners by proving that the waterway could be safely navigated by large vessels, with a length of 470 feet and a gross tonnage of 4400. The Manchester&#150;Montreal line remained the main service of Manchester Liners, as well as an essential element in the prosperity of the ship canal. Under Stoker's management the shipping line became the most profitable of the trio of enterprises associated with the new waterway, its dividends surpassing those of Trafford Park Estates Ltd and of the Manchester Ship Canal Company itself.<br>
<br>Stoker earned a high local reputation in virtue of his energy, tact, and geniality. He became chairman of the Manchester Steamship Lines' Association for 1907&#150;8 and chairman of the board of Manchester Liners itself in 1913 after the death of Lord Furness: he was chosen in preference to Stephen Furness in deference to the wish of the local directors to have a chairman resident in Manchester and acceptable to Manchester merchants. The First World War raised Stoker to the zenith of his career: it enabled the line to secure a quotation on the Manchester stock exchange in 1915, to pay record dividends of 25 per cent in 1916&#150;18 (not surpassed until 1974), and to survive the loss of its Canadian subsidy in 1917. A director of the Manchester chamber of commerce since 1908, Stoker became its president as a result of the palace revolution of 1916  (&#145;Chamber of commerce and free trade: thirty directors resign&#146;, <span class="italic">Manchester Guardian</span>, 24 Feb 1916). He became the first protectionist president of the chamber since 1845. He had gauged far more accurately than his fellow directors the intensity of the wartime anti-German swing in opinion against free trade. He served for three years (1916&#150;19) as the chief executive of the Manchester trade, and presided over the passage in 1916 of a motion in favour of post-war imperial preference. His services were in increasing demand in the business world. His outside directorships rose from ten in 1915 to thirteen in 1919, and he became Unionist MP for Manchester in 1918. He died at his home, Heather Lea, Green Walk, Bowdon, Cheshire, on 4 September 1919.<br>
<br>Frederick W. Lewis (1870&#150;1944), deputy chairman of Furness Withy since 1914, succeeded Stoker as a chairman of Manchester Liners, and transferred the regular meetings of its board to London. The establishment of the line in 1898 had initially inspired extravagant hopes of the local development of &#145;a race of shipowners&#146;  (Manchester Ship Canal Company, annual report, 21 Feb 1901, 1). The shipping dynasty founded by Stoker in an inland city survived his death for two generations. His son Kenneth Stoker (1886&#150;1979) and his grandson R. B. Stoker (<i>b</i>. 1914) became in turn managing director of Manchester Liners, which was finally merged in 1983 into Furness Withy Ltd.<br>
