<span class="headword">Lloyd,  Dennis</span>, Baron Lloyd of Hampstead  (1915&#150;1992), <span class="occ">jurist</span>, was born on 22 October 1915 in London, the second son and second child of Isaac Lloyd (<i>b</i>. 1891), company director, and Betty Jaffa. He was educated at University College School, at University College, London (LLB, 1935), and at Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge (BA, 1937; MA, 1941; LLD, 1956). He was called to the bar by Inner Temple in 1936. He was appointed reader in English law at University College, London, in 1947 and held the Quain professorship in the University of London from 1956 until his retirement, in 1981. He was head of the department of laws in University College, London, from 1969 to 1981. He married Ruth Emma Cecilia Przytulla (<i>b</i>. 1920/21) on 15 September 1940. They had two daughters, and celebrated fifty-two years of happy marriage.<br>
<br>Dennis Lloyd was a man who played many parts. He was a distinguished jurist, a prominent barrister (made a QC in 1975), a minor but influential politician, a law reformer (it was for his political activity and law reform work that the Labour government in 1965 made him a life peer, as Baron Lloyd of Hampstead&#151;in fact he spent most of his time in the House of Lords on the cross-benches), a passionate supporter of the British film industry, and much else besides. In an age of increasing specialism he belonged to a dying breed of polymaths: a man of culture and erudition, at home in different disciplines (his jurisprudential writing is characterized by this), at ease with different worlds.<br>
<br>Lloyd's academic interests and scholarly abilities were demonstrated early. His <span class="italic">Unincorporated Associations</span>, for which he had been awarded the Yorke prize at Cambridge, was published as a monograph in 1938. His work on rent control saw him produce a book that went through two editions and enabled him to become one of the architects of the <span class="roman">Rent Act</span> of 1965. He helped to frame the concept of the &#145;fair rent&#146;, which guaranteed sensible levels of rent and gave security of tenure to long-term tenants. Both these books showed Lloyd the analytical lawyer. <span class="italic">Public Policy: a Comparative Study in English and French Law</span>, published in 1953, saw him at his more reflective. The book remains a model of how comparative law should be undertaken.<br>
<br>The two sides of Lloyd's academic thinking were brought together in his scholarly but popular <span class="italic">The Idea of Law</span>, published as a Pelican book in 1964. Lloyd's &#145;idea&#146; of law was functionalist and consensus-based. He had a vision of law as competent to solve any problem, whether it was concerned with the right to work (the subject of his inaugural lecture as Quain professor), homosexual behaviour, or the control of outer space. He believed that the idea of law that would prevail would be &#145;one which emphasises not so much the self-contained character of law, but rather its function as an instrument of social cohesion and social progress&#146;. With most of his academic life spent (almost literally) in the shadow of Bentham it is difficult to ignore the great utilitarian philosopher's influence&#151;and Bentham would have applauded Lloyd's stand against the incorporation of the European convention on human rights into UK law&#151;but in <span class="italic">The Idea of Law</span> and elsewhere it is the influence of twentieth-century American legal thought that is the more apparent. For Lloyd law was not so much &#145;logic&#146; as &#145;experience&#146;. He was no formalist, and he readily appreciated the social, economic, and political context of law. In <span class="italic">The Idea of Law</span> the influences of Llewellyn's functionalism and Roscoe Pound's jural postulates, and his view of law as &#145;social engineering&#146;, are manifest. Lloyd insisted that &#145;the idea of law must not confine itself to grappling with the technical problem of giving effect to human values through legal machinery&#146;. The idea of law that we find in Lloyd's jurisprudence is a vision consonant with Lloyd the man: a liberal in the best sense of that tradition, a believer in the importance of rights (though he was happy to rely on a common-law formulation of them), in the value of the rule of law, in the value of law as the &#145;essential guarantee for all those freedoms which are looked upon as vital to the good life in a social democracy&#146;. He saw law as a building block of civilization.<br>
<br>There is less of Lloyd the man in his magisterial <span class="italic">Introduction to Jurisprudence</span>, but it is this by which generations of law students will remember him. First published in 1959, when jurisprudence was not as central to law studies as it is now (Hart's <span class="italic">Concept of Law</span> had not yet been published), it had gone through seven editions by 2001. Lloyd himself did not play a major part in the preparation of any edition after the second (in 1965) but he took a keen interest in the book, and was offering assistance and often valuable insights right up to his death. The significance of the publication of the <span class="italic">Introduction</span> in 1959 cannot be underestimated. It introduced law students in much of the English-speaking world to the writings of Kelsen, Olivercrona, Savigny, and G&eacute;ny, as well as to more obvious English classics. The recipe of insightful text and suitably chosen extract remains a model guide to the study of legal thought. To the text he brought his own philosophical training&#151;he was proud to have studied with Wittgenstein&#151;his culture, and his erudition. The <span class="italic">Introduction</span> has its detractors but it remains the standard student text on the subject.<br>
<br>Throughout his life Lloyd grappled with the problems of modernity and the conflicts of contemporary civilization. He was interested in the place of the individual within collectivist states, in the power of the press, in the role of the judiciary, in industrial relations. He wrote on all these subjects, and in law-reform bodies (he was a member of the Law Reform Committee for twenty-one years) and in the Lords he played an active part in engineering change (and, as in the case of human rights legislation, in resisting it where he strongly disapproved).<br>
<br>Lloyd enjoyed films, and to a lesser extent music. He was a keen painter: his paintings graced the faculty of laws during his headship, and his home in Hampstead Garden Suburb. He chaired the committee that planned the National Film School, and was the chairman of the British Film Institute from 1973 to 1976. He spent the last years of his life in Hove, and remained active (indeed was studying modern Greek) right up to his death, in King's College Hospital, London, on 31 December 1992. Though of Jewish descent Lloyd was not a religious or practising Jew. He was cremated at Golders Green crematorium in January 1993.<br>
