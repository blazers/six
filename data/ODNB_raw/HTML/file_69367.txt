<span class="headword">Jenour,  John</span>  (1465/6&#150;1542), <span class="occ">legal official</span>, was the son of William Jenour of Stonham Aspal, Suffolk, and Katherine Whiting. He and his brother Robert Jenour (<i>d</i>. 1536) both became officers of the common pleas, John being mentioned as an attorney in the rolls of the common pleas for 1491. In 1503 he became filazer of the common pleas for Devon, Dorset, and Somerset, and in 1513 was promoted to be second prothonotary. From 1510 he was clerk of assize on the midland circuit. He had been a member of the Middle Temple before 1501, and served as treasurer in 1517&#150;20. As a prothonotary he was one of the officials responsible for settling the forms of pleading and entries, and he is mentioned several times in the law reports. A fair copy of his great book of entries, which was an acknowledged authority and sometimes cited in court, is now in the Library of Congress, Washington  (Phillipps MS 26752). It includes some earlier cases taken from the collections of William Copley, chief prothonotary from 1468 to 1490. Though never printed, it had some influence on the anonymous <span class="italic">Intrationum liber</span> of 1546.<br>
<br>A number of Jenour's pupils or under-clerks can be identified, thanks to an obituary note written by Chief Justice Catlin, and the list shows what a remarkable influence he had on the judiciary of the next generation. His pupils, all Middle Templars, included four future chief justices&#151;Sir Robert Catlin himself, Sir Robert Brooke, Sir Anthony Browne, and Sir James Dyer&#151;and two puisne judges, Corbet and Freville. According to the <span class="italic">Visitations of Essex</span> Jenour married in 1500 Anne, daughter of John Fincham of Outwell, Norfolk; however, his widow was called Alice (<i>d</i>. 1549). Jenour died, aged seventy-six, on 17 September 1542, and was probably buried according to his testamentary instructions in the chancel of Temple Church. There was formerly a monumental inscription at Great Dunmow, Essex. Besides his property in Essex he left a house and garden in St Bride's, Fleet Street, leased from the bishop of Salisbury. His eldest son, Richard (1511&#150;1548), to whom he left his book of entries, was a member of parliament and clerk of the court of surveyors. To his second son, Robert, he left the manor of Rendham Hall, Suffolk, &#145;so that he contynue his study and lernyng in the Temple&#146;. His nephew Richard Lone (<i>d</i>. 1581) was third prothonotary of the common pleas.<br>
