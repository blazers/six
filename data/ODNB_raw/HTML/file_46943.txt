One of her mother's sisters was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/4449/', "Julia Margaret Cameron (1815&#150;1879)")</script>, who took many photographs of Julia; another, Virginia, married Lord Eastnor, later third Earl Somers, of Eastnor Castle in the Malvern Hills, where Julia and her mother were often guests. Through this connection, Julia Jackson was first cousin to <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36188/', "Lady Isabella Caroline Somerset (1851&#150;1921)")</script> and her sister <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/48836/', "Adeline Mary Russell, duchess of Bedford (1852&#150;1920)")</script>. A third of the Pattle sisters&#151;Sarah&#151;was married to <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22811/', "Henry Thoby Prinsep (1792&#150;1878)")</script>. Their home, Little Holland House, a meeting place for writers, artists, and politicians, was to be important in Julia Jackson's early social life. Her cousin was the painter <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35615/', "Valentine Cameron Prinsep")</script>.<br>
<br>In 1848 Maria and Julia Jackson returned to live in England, Dr Jackson following in 1855. From 1855 to 1866 the family lived at Brent Lodge, Hendon, where Julia was educated at home. After her sisters' marriages (in 1856 and 1862) Julia became her mother's principal nurse and companion. As a frequent visitor to Little Holland House she was greatly admired: she met <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/4051/', "Edward Burne-Jones (1833&#150;1898)")</script>, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36781/', "George Frederic Watts (1817&#150;1904)")</script>, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/34058/', "William Holman Hunt (1827&#150;1910)")</script>, all of whom drew and painted her. In 1864 both Holman Hunt and the sculptor <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29961/', "Thomas Woolner")</script> proposed to her. (Her mother claimed that every man who met her in a railway carriage fell in love with her.) Two years before, however, she had met a young barrister, Herbert Duckworth (1833&#150;1870), to whom she may have been attracted for his very straightforwardness: Leslie Stephen recalled his being described as &#145;the perfect type of public-school man&#146;  (L. Stephen, 35). They were married on 4 May 1867. They had three children: George Herbert (<i>b</i>. 1868), Stella (<i>b</i>. 1869), and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/47451/', "Gerald L'&#201;tang Duckworth")</script>, born in 1870, six weeks after his father's death in September from an undiagnosed abscess. Their marriage was evidently blissfully happy, and was consecrated in her memory as perfect. After Herbert Duckworth's death Julia was devastated. She lay on his grave. She felt that life was &#145;a shipwreck&#146;, and only the need to look after the children kept her going. She felt herself become deadened, and her grief left its mark in a new gravity, an enduring stoicism, and an awareness of suffering in others. She decisively rejected Christianity, and as she read Leslie Stephen's articles on agnosticism, first became interested in him. Through her friend Anny Thackeray, Stephen's sister-in-law, Julia became close to Minny and Leslie Stephen. They were drawn together after Minny's death, when Julia helped Leslie Stephen and Anny to move to the house almost next door to hers in Hyde Park Gate, London. Early in 1877 he declared his love for her, but since she did not imagine that she could ever marry again, they agreed to remain very close friends. However in January 1878 she changed her mind, and on 26 March they were married. In 1879 Burne-Jones completed his painting of her as Mary in his <span class="italic">Annunciation</span>; on 30 May Vanessa (1879&#150;1961) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30694/', "Bell, Vanessa")</script>] was born. Three other children followed: Julian Thoby (1880&#150;1906); Adeline Virginia [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/37018/', "Woolf, (Adeline) Virginia (1882&#150;1941)")</script>]; and Adrian Leslie (1883&#150;1948). Julia also became the stepmother of Leslie Stephen's daughter Laura, who was mentally handicapped.<br>
<br>Julia Stephen's character and its impact were powerful, but are elusive to capture. Lily Briscoe, the artist in Virginia Woolf's <span class="italic">To the Lighthouse</span> (1927), in which the character of Mrs Ramsay was modelled on Woolf's mother, struggles throughout the novel to paint Mrs Ramsay: &#145;Fifty pairs of eyes were not enough to get round that one woman with, she thought. Among them, must be one that was stone blind to her beauty&#146;  (Woolf, <span class="italic">Lighthouse</span>, 188). She was &#145;astonishingly beautiful&#146;. The phrase is repeated in the novel, and Lily Briscoe comments that &#145;Beauty had its penalty&#151;it came too readily, came too completely. It stilled life&#151;froze it&#146;  (ibid., 186). It was difficult to get behind it; while Mrs Ramsay herself was aware of its power. In his <span class="italic">Mausoleum Book</span>, written for her children after Julia's death, Leslie Stephen wrote reverentially about her complete beauty of body and soul  (L. Stephen, 32). As Quentin Bell observed, he drew the portrait of a saint, and because of this &#145;one cannot quite believe in her&#146;  (Bell, 17). The complexities of her character and indeed of their relationship are smoothed over in Leslie Stephen's memorial, although the model of sanctified family life was certainly one to which she was entirely committed. The edges of reality were rougher and more distinctive. She lived a life devoted to the service of others; yet Virginia Woolf was keen to distinguish this from &#145;the mischievous philanthropy which other women practise so complacently and often with such disastrous results&#146;  (Woolf, <span class="italic">Moments</span>, 34). Woolf wrote of Julia's remarkable sympathy with people, her intense engagement with the event of the moment, her good judgement and decisiveness, her sense of irony and of the absurd. She wished she could recapture the tone of &#145;the clear round voice, or the sight of the beautiful figure, so upright and distinct, in its long shabby cloak, with the head held at a certain angle, so that the eye looked straight out at you&#146;  (ibid., 36).<br>
<br>Julia Stephen was always there to support her family, her friends, an endless stream of supplicants. She nursed the sick and dying, and travelled round London by bus visiting hospitals and workhouses. The help which she offered was specific, practical, and increasingly professional, and she was never afraid to speak out (for example in the <span class="italic">Pall Mall Gazette</span>, 4 October 1879, on behalf of workhouse inmates whose half-pint beer allocation had been removed by temperance campaigners). In 1883 she published her <span class="italic">Notes from Sick Rooms</span>, a discussion of good nursing practice, which demonstrated a fine attention to detail&#151;and to language: it included an eloquent and witty passage on the torment of crumbs in bed. At the same time as she was concerned with the sick, both in London and (from 1881) at Talland House, St Ives, their summer home, she was constantly entertaining, filling the house with disparate people&#151;the lively and the boring&#151;out of whom she delighted in creating a harmony. Here the imperiousness of her character came out. The willingness to interfere and the confidence that she knew what was best which sustained her philanthropy found its domestic role in the manipulation of relationships and in assiduous matchmaking. She thought that everyone should be married.<br>
<br>As well as teaching her children (somewhat erratically), Julia Stephen wrote stories for them, never published in her lifetime, in which she promoted the values of family life and kindness to animals. One, &#145;Cat's Meat&#146;, treats of two children whose parents are always out looking after the poor, and who decide that they will be more likely to see them if they run away to become a crossing sweeper and a cat's meat girl. Ultimately they realize the advantages of home. But the moral is not entirely straightforward. The tensions were there in Julia Stephen's own life. The demands on her were ultimately to pull in too many different directions. She soothed Leslie Stephen's depressions, always responded to his calls for attention (which created deep-seated resentments towards him in her children), and boosted his self-confidence; she nursed her father and mother until their deaths; she was often called away from home, and was worn down by her many commitments. In needing to break away from the model set by her mother, Virginia Woolf was to express exasperation at her mother's selflessness: &#145;boasting of her capacity to surround and protect, there was scarcely a shell of herself left for her to know herself by&#146;  (Woolf, <span class="italic">Lighthouse</span>, 35). Yet she also recognized the strength and quality of the womanly ideal by which Julia Stephen had lived. Julia admired Leslie Stephen totally, and, while she knew her own mind, did not set any store by her intellect. But &#145;she never belittled her own works, thinking them, if properly discharged, of equal, though other, importance with her husband's&#146;  (Woolf, <span class="italic">Moments</span>, 37). It was in this context that she wrote (in 1880) a spirited defence of agnostic women's spirituality and capacity for philanthropic work (in response to the claim that agnosticism would cause women to lose such qualities); and in 1889 signed a petition against female suffrage, alongside her close friend Octavia Hill (1838&#150;1912). The models which she set up for her daughters were Hill, Florence Nightingale (1820&#150;1910), and Mrs Humphry Ward (1851&#150;1920). She held strong views on women's proper sphere of activity, and had complete assurance in the centrality of her own role as the person who held everything together. Her legacy was a challenging one. It was made the more poignant by her premature death. On 5 May 1895, at 22 Hyde Park Gate, Julia Stephen died of heart failure, following a bad bout of influenza. The funeral took place on 8 May at Highgate cemetery, where she was buried.<br>
