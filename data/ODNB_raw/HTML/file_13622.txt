<span class="headword">Holwell,  John Zephaniah</span>  (1711&#150;1798), <span class="occ">East India Company servant</span>, was born on 17 September 1711 in Dublin, the son of Zephaniah Holwell (<i>d</i>. 1729), timber merchant of London, and his wife, Sarah Bott, and grandson of the astrologer <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13621/', "John Holwell")</script>. He was educated at Richmond Green, Surrey, and Iselmond, near Rotterdam, and was then employed as a clerk by a banker and ship's husband in Rotterdam. His enthusiasm for this work waned and he left for Ireland before being summoned to London by his father, where he embarked upon a career in surgery and was apprenticed to a surgeon in Southwark. He was later placed under Andrew Cooper, senior surgeon at Guy's Hospital. In 1732 he sailed for India as surgeon's mate on an Indiaman. Following his arrival in Calcutta he travelled to the Middle East, serving as surgeon on ships sailing to the Persian Gulf and to Jiddah and Mocha. In Bengal he acted briefly as surgeon to the East India Company's factory at Dacca before settling more permanently in Calcutta in late 1736. There he became assistant surgeon to the hospital in 1740 and principal physician and surgeon to the presidency in 1746. During this period he also became involved in civic affairs, being elected as an alderman in the mayor's court and as mayor in 1747 and 1748. Intellectually Holwell found much stimulation in India; his travels gave him the opportunity to learn Arabic, in which he became quite fluent, and he acquired knowledge of other languages. He also began to research Hindu theology.<br>
<br>In 1750 Holwell left India, but he was back in Bengal by early July 1752. During his brief stay in England he had drawn on his knowledge and experience to convince the company's directors of the need to reform the post of <i>zamindar</i> in Calcutta. The <i>zamindar</i>, appointed by the company since 1698, was responsible for revenue collection and law and order, and Holwell had been nominated to that office by the directors, who had placed him twelfth in the Fort William council with the stipulation that he rise no higher. Following his arrival in Bengal Holwell enquired into the state of the revenues and investigated the activities of Govindaram Mitra, who had been involved in the management of the revenues for over thirty years and who was suspected of having committed frauds. His efforts were warmly praised by the directors, who applauded the increase in revenues which had been achieved without the introduction of new duties, and the restriction on his promotion within the council was removed. Holwell's work was, however, met with much less enthusiasm by other members of the council, who were slow to act on his findings.<br>
<br>In June 1756 the nawab of Bengal, Siraj ud-Daula, attacked Calcutta, and Fort William was abandoned by Governor Drake and other senior company servants, leaving Holwell and others to their fate. It was agreed that Holwell should take charge, and he proceeded to lead the defence of the fort, but was eventually compelled to surrender to the nawab's forces and, along with the remnants of the garrison, was placed under arrest. On the night of 20 June he and others were incarcerated in a cell within the fort known as the Black Hole; this event was to become infamous, mainly as a result of propaganda put about by Holwell. Two years later an account by him was published which claimed that 146 individuals were crammed into the cell and that of these 123 died (<span class="italic">A genuine narrative of the deplorable deaths of the English gentlemen and others, who were suffocated in the Black Hole</span>); research has, however, suggested that those imprisoned numbered sixty-four and that twenty-one survived. Some years later Holwell erected an obelisk in Calcutta in memory of those who had died. After his release from the cell Holwell was taken with three others to Murshidabad, where they were held prisoner until the middle of July; he then rejoined Drake (whose authority as governor he eventually accepted) and other council members, and plans were made for the recapture of Calcutta, which was achieved by Robert Clive in January 1757.<br>
<br>Holwell remained in Bengal until February 1757, when he returned to England. Before he left he wrote the directors a lengthy narrative of events in which he was critical of the conduct of Drake and the other senior company servants during the attack on Calcutta; such remarks were the product of his own ambition and did nothing for his personal popularity in Bengal. He referred to his incarceration in the Black Hole as &#145;a night of horrors I will not attempt to describe, as they bar all description&#146;  (Holwell to directors, 30 Nov 1756, ed. Datta, 1088). Once in England he was able to provide the directors with first-hand accounts of events in Bengal, to advise them on the reorganization of their affairs there, and to cultivate a following among them which included John Payne, the chairman of the company. In November 1757 he was appointed to fourth place in the council and governor by fourfold rotation, but after two revisions of these arrangements his interest suffered when, at the election of directors in April 1758, his supporters lost power. In consequence he was reduced to ninth place in the council and was therefore distanced from the governorship.<br>
<br>In November 1758 Holwell, having returned to Bengal, took his seat in the council, which was now presided over by Clive, whose victory over Siraj ud-Daula at Plassey over a year earlier had been followed by the accession of Mir Jafar as nawab of Bengal. He was again involved in administrative reform, being appointed to a committee which considered orders from the directors which dealt with various matters including the post of <i>zamindar</i>. His position in the council was altered dramatically by the departure of a large number of councillors, and when Clive resigned the governorship in January 1760 it was Holwell who succeeded him until Henry Vansittart became governor in July of that year. Holwell's administration coincided with growing dissatisfaction with Mir Jafar and he devised a plan whereby the nawab would surrender power to his son-in-law Mir Kasim but retain his title; this scheme was implemented by Vansittart in October 1760 with the result that Mir Jafar resigned completely and Mir Kasim became nawab. It is likely that Holwell was motivated by a desire for personal financial reward in his dealings with Mir Kasim; he was certainly promised &pound;20,000 by him at some point, of which at least &pound;5000 was paid. Some claimed he was worth &pound;96,000 upon his departure from office.<br>
<br>Holwell returned to England in 1761; for a time his country residence was Chilton Lodge, near Hungerford, Berkshire. The rest of his life was taken up with literary pursuits; during the 1760s he published several defences of his conduct in India, notably <span class="italic">Important Facts Regarding the East India Company's Affairs in Bengal from 1752 to 1760</span> (1764). Of greater significance were his historical and theological works, whose importance lay in their popular appeal rather than their content; his <span class="italic">Interesting Historical Events, Relative to the Provinces of Bengal and the Empire of Indostan</span> (3 vols., 1765&#150;71) was translated into German and French and earned him praise from Voltaire. A Christian with eccentric beliefs and an advocate of vegetarianism, Holwell also issued writings on other subjects including smallpox inoculation and crime prevention.<br>
<br>Holwell was twice married and three children survived him. He died at his home in Pinner, Middlesex, on 5 November 1798.<br>
