<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Barrett,  Wilson</span> <span class="st"> [<em>real name </em>William Henry Barrett]</span>  (1846&#150;1904), <span class="occ">actor and playwright</span>, was born on 18 February 1846 at Manor House Farm, Chelmsford, Essex, the second child and eldest son of George Barrett, a farmer, and his wife, Charlotte Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Wood. The failure of his father as a farmer drove the family in 1857 to London, where Barrett worked first as a labourer in a corn exchange and then with a firm of printers and engravers. He began his professional stage career as a &#145;general utility&#146; actor at the Theatre Royal, Halifax, in 1864. After a series of temporary engagements at Nottingham and Liverpool he joined the company in Aberdeen, where he met Caroline Heath (1835&#150;1887). She was an experienced performer and, despite her family's objections to the fact that she was more than ten years older than Barrett, they were married on 21 July 1866.<h2>
<a name="Earlycareer"></a>Early career</h2>The period to 1879 was marked by extended provincial engagements with occasional London visits. Barrett formed his own company in 1870 and began management of the Theatre Royal, Halifax, in 1869 and the Theatre Royal, Hull, in 1877. His first professional London engagement was at the Surrey, playing Tom Robinson in Charles Reade's <span class="italic">It's Never too Late to Mend</span> (26 June 1867); while employed at Drury Lane in 1868 he changed his forename to Wilson. He then formed his own combination company, which included his brothers George and Robert and his sister Mary, and which by 1875 comprised twenty-five actors touring a repertory of about twenty plays throughout northern England. Barrett was later to claim that he was the first manager to make the combination system a permanent fixture in England  (<span class="italic">The Era</span>, 28 Aug 1886). He took the lease of the Leeds Amphitheatre in 1874, and opened in W. G. Wills's version of <span class="italic">Jane Shore</span> on 8 March 1875, when his wife played Jane and he himself took the part of Henry Shore. It was their first enduring success. After the theatre burnt down, destroying his entire stock of costumes and sets, Barrett was asked to advise on the building of a new theatre in Leeds. The Grand opened under his management on 16 November 1878, and he retained it for the next sixteen years.<br>
<br>While the Barretts were performing at the Princess's Theatre (June 1878&#150;May 1879), Barrett decided to go into London management for the first time. He took over the Court Theatre, and opened with an adaptation of Sardou's <span class="italic">Fernande</span> on 10 October 1879; Henry Arthur Jones's first London play, <span class="italic">A Clerical Error</span>, was added to the programme on 13 October. Caroline Heath, however, returned to their home in Leeds to recuperate from a nervous breakdown, the symptoms of which had already been evident while she was on tour in 1877.<br>
<br>Barrett's tenancy of the Court introduced Helena Modjeska to the English stage in Mortimer's adaptation of <span class="italic">The Lady of the Camellias</span>, renamed <span class="italic">Heartsease</span> (1 May 1880). He demonstrated an acute awareness of the value of publicity by using Modjeska's aristocratic contacts. In 1881 he produced the first in his career of three stagings of Shakespeare: <span class="italic">Romeo and Juliet</span>, with Modjeska as Juliet, Johnston Forbes-Robertson as Romeo, and himself as Mercutio (26 March). At the same time he started his management of a series of companies which toured his successes, while he settled in London at 21 North Bank, St John's Wood. Though critically less than successful, Barrett's production of W. G. Wills's sombre <span class="italic">Juana</span>, again with Modjeska (7 May 1881), began his collaboration with E. W. Godwin as his archaeological stage adviser.<h2>
<a name="LesseeofthePrincesssTheatre"></a>Lessee of the Princess's Theatre</h2>Barrett decided to lease the ailing Princess's in 1881 and began his management with Comyns Carr's adaptation of Meilhac and Halevy's <span class="italic">Frou-Frou</span>, his last production with Modjeska (4 June). He augmented his company with Mary Eastlake, E. S. Willard, and his own brother George, and produced his first unqualified success, G. R. Sims's <span class="italic">Lights o' London</span> (10 September 1881). The play's combination of contemporary issues, detailed realism in staging (including supernumeraries drawn from among actual costermongers and street hawkers), and the manipulation of large crowd scenes doubtless influenced by the theatre practices of the Meiningen company, all contained within a populist melodramatic framework, became Barrett's house style for the remainder of his career. This was followed by a Dickensian crime drama, <span class="italic">The Romany Rye</span>, adapted by Sims from the novel by George Borrow (10 June 1882). Looking for a vehicle to crystallize his emerging artistic vision, Barrett collaborated with Henry Arthur Jones and Henry Herman on <span class="italic">The Silver King</span> (16 November 1882). The role of Wilfred Denver enabled him to develop a performance combining intense pathos, inner strength, and saintliness, which coloured most of his later roles. Critics unanimously proclaimed that Barrett had invested the melodramatic form with new meaning, which received even Matthew Arnold's approval  (<span class="italic">Pall Mall Gazette</span>, 6 Dec 1882). The rights to the play were sold to American and Australian managers and Barrett made a profit of nearly &pound;10,000.<br>
<br>Barrett's last great financial success at the Princess's came with Wills and Herman's <span class="italic">Claudian</span>, which was assisted by Godwin's archaeological reconstruction of Byzantium (6 December 1883). The scenery was much praised by John Ruskin, and the sensational act II earthquake scene made it a popular hit. There were those, however, who reacted against the play's religiosity and questioned the basis of Barrett's popularity. In 1883 Barrett's broker in Leeds absconded with the profits he had invested so that by the end of 1884 Barrett owed an accumulated debt of &pound;32,000. Although he retained the Princess's until 1886, none of his remaining productions proved financially viable. He worked with Jones on three further plays: <span class="italic">Chatterton</span> (22 May 1884), <span class="italic">Hoodman Blind</span> (18 August 1885), and <span class="italic">Lord Harry</span> (18 February 1886), and with Sydney Grundy on a verse tragedy, <span class="italic">Clito</span> (1 May 1886). His most interesting production in the period, however, was of <span class="italic">Hamlet</span> (16 October 1884). Barrett seems to have attempted deliberately to flout prevailing performance orthodoxy by rejecting the reflective melancholy so much identified with Irving. Instead, audiences were challenged by an energetically youthful Hamlet who delivered his lines as though the play were a middle-class melodrama. The critical reaction was polarized, and there is evidence to suggest the beginnings of a deliberate campaign by critics with vested theatrical interests to discredit him. Pamphlets were circulated suggesting that Barrett was consciously manoeuvring to displace Irving, and ill feeling was exacerbated by public controversy about the exact extent to which Barrett could claim authorial contribution to <span class="italic">The Silver King</span>  (Thomas, 85&#150;6). The bad press and declining attendances were enough to have Barrett end his lease of the Princess's (23 July 1886). He had already mortgaged the rights to his plays and he now negotiated with his creditors for a licence to continue operating without being declared bankrupt. To recoup his losses, a preoccupation which remained with him for the next ten years, Barrett left with his company on his first visit to America on 21 September 1886, and opened at the Star Theatre, New York, with <span class="italic">Claudian</span> (11 October). A tour which included Boston, Chicago, Washington, and Philadelphia ended profitably, and the company returned to England in May 1887. Two months later Caroline Heath, who had never returned to the stage, died of a brain haemorrhage in London.<h2>
<a name="Careerdoldrumsandtriumph"></a>Career doldrums and triumph</h2>From December 1887 until mid-May 1888 Barrett managed the Globe Theatre, and his successes in revivals, particularly <span class="italic">The Lady of Lyons</span> (22 February 1888), and his collaborative work with Sims on <span class="italic">The Golden Ladder</span> (22 December 1887) enabled him to start repaying his creditors. Once again he returned to the Princess's, where he began work with Hall Caine on adapting <span class="italic">The Deemster</span>, renamed <span class="italic">Ben-my-chree</span> (17 May 1888). It was his only real success, and he added it to his repertory on his second American tour, which began in Boston on 14 October 1889, and this time took in St Louis and San Francisco. The costs of the company's transport and the general economic depression, however, exhausted his funds and Barrett returned to England in August 1890.<br>
<br>Over the next five years Barrett battled to retain his reputation both in London and in the provinces and to repay his creditors by further trips to America. These included a third tour, embracing Canada for the first time, from October 1892 to April 1893 and a fourth, which took in the southern states, including Texas, from November 1893 to June 1894. These years saw Barrett dogged by family tragedy: his daughters Ellen and Katherine died in 1892 and 1893 and his brothers Robert and George in 1893 and 1894 respectively. There were few successes by way of compensation. He relied principally on revivals, and added old triumphs of W. C. Macready such as Sheridan Knowles's <span class="italic">Virginius</span> to his stock. Even his staunchest admirers felt that his acting was showing &#145;mannered and mechanical methods&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Theatre</span>, December 1891). This was redressed somewhat by his performances as Othello at the Court Theatre, Liverpool (22 October 1891), and as Pete Quilliam in his own version of Hall Caine's <span class="italic">The Manxman</span> at Leeds (22 August 1894). But his absences on extended tours made his management of the theatres at Hull and Leeds untenable and he was forced to relinquish them both, in 1891 and 1894.<br>
<br>The turning point at this stage of Barrett's career came during his fifth American tour (November 1894&#150;July 1895), with the opening at the Grand Opera House, St Louis, of his own <span class="italic">The Sign of the Cross</span> (27 March 1895). After a further tryout in Leeds (26 August 1895) it was staged at the Lyric (4 January 1896) and played for 435 performances, until 30 January 1897. The enormous popular success of the play enabled Barrett to pay off all his debts. However, it was his last major achievement.<br>
<br>The play itself aroused considerable critical hostility. Critics such as Shaw and William Archer saw it as a society drama clothed in a meretricious form of Christianity, while humanists, including G. W. Foote, found it prurient. On the other hand, religious journals took the play's message of conversion at face value, and Barrett's astute marketing ensured that audiences totally unfamiliar with theatregoing attended the production with the warm support of their clergy. Once again Barrett was able to send out touring companies to perform his own plays, and London audiences saw him as Virginius and Othello. Despite the antagonism of Archer and Shaw towards <span class="italic">The Sign of the Cross</span>, both men admired his revised version of <span class="italic">The Manxman</span>, which opened at the Lyric on 16 November 1896, and which Shaw described as &#145;a serious modern play&#146;  (<span class="italic">Saturday Review</span>, 5 Dec 1896).<br>
<br>There was much discussion about actors who might be considered for a knighthood during the diamond jubilee year, and Barrett's name was raised. In the event he was passed over. In December 1897 he began his first tour of Australia, and played his established repertory in Sydney, Melbourne, and Adelaide. He returned to England in July 1898 and after further provincial touring took over the management of Irving's Lyceum Theatre. Neither an original play, <span class="italic">Man and his Makers</span>, written with L. N. Parker (7 October 1899), nor revivals of <span class="italic">Hamlet</span> and <span class="italic">Othello</span> were sufficient to warrant extending his term beyond December. Moreover, declining audiences in the provinces suggested that his plays were suffering from overexposure.<br>
<br>Barrett went on his second Australian tour, beginning in August 1901, with Lillah McCarthy as his leading lady. This time he visited New Zealand and, on his return journey, South Africa, and arrived home in August 1902. Once again he alternated between the provinces and occasional London appearances. He tried out <span class="italic">The Christian King</span>, a sprawling epic about Alfred and the coming of Christianity to England, at the Prince's Theatre, Bristol (6 November 1902), before playing it at the Adelphi (18 December 1902). His last original play, <span class="italic">Lucky Durham</span>, opened at the Shakespeare Theatre, Liverpool (9 January 1904), and it was there that he gave his final performance, as Wilfred Denver. Although he had signed a lease for the Comedy Theatre in London on 15 June, he fell ill and was taken to a nursing home at 45 Devonshire Street, where he died from complications arising after a cancer operation, on 22 July 1904. He was buried at Hampstead cemetery on 25 July, leaving assets valued at more than &pound;30,000.<h2>
<a name="Assessment"></a>Assessment</h2>Barrett's theatrical values were uncompromisingly Victorian. As such he looked back: his performances were modelled on those of Macready and his productions on the picturesque realizations of antiquity which both Macready and Charles Kean had pioneered. At the same time he saw his own role as pleasing and educating a popular audience. His personal attributes of a fine physique and voice made him an attractive stage personality, although his vanity inclined him to affectations which diminished his very considerable talents. His performances in Shakespeare's plays, for example, suggested a radically different approach to their interpretation. He chose, however, to devote his energies to revitalizing melodrama, a genre increasingly denigrated by his contemporaries. Conservative critics such as Clement Scott and William Winter admired Barrett's championing of traditional theatrical verities; Archer, Arthur Walkley, and Beerbohm were affronted by his failure to come to terms with the &#145;new drama&#146; or were outraged particularly by what they took to be his conscious identification with his religious roles.<br>
<br>Nevertheless Barrett was an astute manager and entrepreneur who appreciated the value of publicity, which many of his fellow managers saw as vulgar and self-aggrandizing. He was devoted to the fellow actors in his companies, assisting them with their stagecraft and caring for their welfare with unflagging paternalism just as he diligently developed the dramatic talents of such writers as Jones and Caine. Though he may have been despised and rejected by many critics, his religious plays undoubtedly attracted new audiences to the theatre and provided enduring subject matter for the cinema.<br>
