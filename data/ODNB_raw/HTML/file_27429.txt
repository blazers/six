<span class="headword">Tichborne, Sir  Henry</span>  (1581?&#150;1667), <span class="occ">army officer and politician</span>, was the fourth son of Sir Benjamin Tichborne, first baronet (<i>c</i>.1540&#150;1629), of Tichborne, Hampshire, gentleman of the privy chamber to James I, and Amphillis (<i>d</i>. in or after 1629), daughter of Richard Weston, justice of the common pleas. Appointed a captain of foot in Ireland in 1620, he was made governor of Lifford soon afterwards and was knighted on 23 August 1623. He was appointed to commissions to investigate the plantations in Ulster, and built up Irish estates, particularly in co. Tyrone, but also in counties Leitrim, Donegal, and Fermanagh. In 1634 he represented County Tyrone in the Irish parliament. He married Jane (<i>d</i>. 1664), daughter of Sir Robert Newcomen, with whom he had five sons and three daughters: Benjamin, William, Richard, Henry, Samuel, Dorcas, Amphillis, and Elizabeth.<br>
<br>Following the outbreak of the rising of 1641, Tichborne was appointed governor of Drogheda and reached there on 4 November. Ormond thought him &#145;a very honest and gallant gentleman &hellip; and one that I beleeve will render a good accoumpt of it or leave his bones there&#146;  (<span class="italic">Irish Confederation</span>, ed. Gilbert, 1.233). The town came under siege from the insurgents, Tichborne's successful resistance winning him lasting acclaim. The siege was abandoned in early March 1643, and he undertook a series of sorties in the vicinity, capturing Dundalk on 26 March.<br>
<br>Tichborne was named to the Irish privy council on 11 May 1642 and appointed governor of co. Meath on 27 March 1643. On 31 March 1643 Charles I named him one of two lords justices, and he took up office, alongside Sir John Borlase, on 1 May, resigning power to Ormond as lord lieutenant on 21 January 1644. He later claimed that the post was &#145;unsuitable to my Parts or Fortune &hellip; there being a Necessity of my Obedience&#146;, and that he opposed the royal plan for a cessation with the confederate forces, which &#145;was &hellip; as much hindered by me, as was in my Power&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letter of Sir Henry Tichborne</span>, 31), signing the ceasefire order as a military necessity. In 1644 he was summoned to the royal headquarters at Oxford to advise Charles I on the royal plans for a peace with the confederate Catholics. Again, he later claimed to have voiced his dissent, arguing that the confederate terms were &#145;destructive to the Protestant Religion, exceeding hurtful to his Majesty's present Service, and to the utter ruin of the <i>English</i> Interest in this Kingdom&#146;  (ibid., 34). Returning with instructions for Ormond, he was captured at sea by the English parliamentarians on 31 December 1644, and from February 1645 was imprisoned in the Tower. He was held until September when he was exchanged for prisoners held by Ormond, and returned to his post at Drogheda. Regardless of any possible doubts, on 30 July 1646 he was one of the privy councillors who signed the proclamation of the short-lived peace between Ormond and the confederates.<br>
<br>Tichborne retained his command&#151;&#145;with Chearfulness&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letter of Sir Henry Tichborne</span>, 34)&#151;after Ormond handed his garrisons to the English parliamentarians in 1647, and served in parliament's victory at Dungan's Hill on 8 August 1647 and in further expeditions into south Ulster and north Leinster. But by April 1648 London was entertaining doubts about his reliability, as a former associate of Ormond. Aware that others with his background were being arrested he obtained permission to travel to London in the autumn of 1648. By April 1649 he had been awarded funds for past services and it was ordered that the &#145;test is also to be subscribed by him, and he dispatched away to his command&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1648&#150;9</i>, 72). Even so there remained a &#145;prejudicate Opinion&#146; of him in some quarters, and he &#145;therefore freely reposed my Arms, and forsook my Employment&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letter of Sir Henry Tichborne</span>, 39). His wife fled from Ireland to the royalist stronghold of the Isle of Man about August 1649.<br>
<br>Tichborne composed an account of his exploits, dated 1651, intended for his wife to use to secure some recompense for his past services, and which argued his reluctant acquiescence in royalist peace plans in the 1640s. He undertook a long-running campaign for payment of what he considered to be his remaining arrears and for which he sought satisfaction in the form of a grant of lands at Beaulieu, co. Louth, of which he had been awarded possession, as tenant to the state, by Cromwell. Repeated journeys to England won him the lord protector's approval but the Dublin administration stalled the award, on the grounds that land in the county had been earmarked for other uses. In the meantime he appears to have bought up rights to lands awarded to &#145;adventurers&#146; (investors in the war effort) in Leinster and Ulster.<br>
<br>With the restoration of Charles II, Tichborne was appointed marshal of the army for Ireland on 31 July 1660, and was elected to the Irish parliament of 1661 for Sligo borough. He continued to petition for his arrears, while one of his sons eventually secured ownership of Beaulieu. He died there in 1667 and was buried the same year in St Mary's Church, Drogheda. The confederate Richard Bellings later spoke of Tichborne as &#145;a man trusty to the King, valiant and moderate&#146;  (<span class="italic">Irish Confederation</span>, ed. Gilbert, 1.162). Of his courage there seems little doubt, but Bellings may have overestimated Tichborne's support for the royal policy of accommodation, evidence for his stance being rendered murky by his later self-justification. The regicide John Moore spoke of him as &#145;so great an enemy to the rebels in Ireland, killing many hundreds of them at his own hand or standing by to see them executed&#146; and Tichborne later admitted that there was &#145;little mercy shown in those times&#146;  (O'Sullivan, 65). It was for military, rather than politic or humane, virtues and abilities that Tichborne won his contemporary renown and reward.<br>
<br>Tichborne was succeeded by his son Sir William (<i>d</i>. 1694), who married Judith Bysse. Their son, <a name="cosubject_27429"></a><span class="headword">Henry Tichborne</span>, first Baron Ferrard of Beaulieu  (1662&#150;1731), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born in Dublin and educated there at Trinity College. He was MP for Ardee (1692&#150;3) and for co. Louth (1695&#150;9 and 1710&#150;13). Knighted on 28 March 1694, he was created a baronet on 12 July 1697 and Baron Ferrard of Beaulieu on 9 October 1715. He married in July 1683 Arabella, daughter of Sir Robert Cotton, baronet, of Combermere, Cheshire, but his titles became extinct on his death from apoplexy on 3 November 1731.<br>
