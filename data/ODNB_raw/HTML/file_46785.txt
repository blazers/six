<span class="headword">Brown,  Sidney George</span>  (1873&#150;1948), <span class="occ">electrical engineer and inventor</span>, was born in Chicago, USA, on 6 July 1873, the eldest son of English parents, Sidney Brown and his wife, Clara, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Napier. The family returned to England in 1879, and Brown attended a private school in Parkstone, near Bournemouth. He was subsequently educated at Harrogate College, Yorkshire, and, in 1894&#150;6, at University College, London. From 1892 to 1897 he was a paying pupil at Crompton's electrical engineering works in Chelmsford. After completing his pupillage, he was employed for a further six months by Cromptons; his father's illness then obliged him to return to the family business in Bournemouth. He continued to work at his electrical interests and in 1899 he patented the first of many inventions for improving telegraph cables. At about the same time he was assisting Sir Henry Hozier, secretary of Lloyds, to develop a radio telegraph system. He formed the Telegraph Condenser Company in 1906 to manufacture and market his inventions.<br>
<br>Brown married Alice Mary Herbert Russell, only daughter of the Revd Charles John Stower, of Sudbury, Suffolk, on 15 January 1908. She took a keen interest in his work. In later years she was largely responsible for the administration and financial control of his companies. He formed a new company, S. G. Brown Ltd, in 1911, to manufacture telephone equipment. With his wife's assistance, he designed a telephone relay, an improved receiver, and an effective loudspeaker (the Browns being first to use this name for the device). By 1914 his businesses had expanded to employ over a thousand people. Already a member of the Institution of Electrical Engineers and a fellow of the Institute of Physics, he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1916.<br>
<br>At the outbreak of war in 1914 there was no British manufacturer of gyro compasses, which had been imported from Germany. Brown set out to remedy the deficiency. During this work, he also devised a new method&#151;called &#145;liquid ballistic control&#146;&#151;of damping the oscillation set up in a compass by a change in course. He supplied two compasses to the Admiralty for tests in 1916; the time taken to evaluate and put them into production meant they were not available for service during the war. However, his compasses were later adopted for use in both ships and aircraft. Brown also served as a member of the Admiralty's inventions board during the First World War.<br>
<br>Despite the severe depression of the inter-war years, there was still a lucrative market for electrical equipment. The electrical power network was spreading out over the country; the BBC had started its radio broadcasting service. Brown's companies provided components for both power and radio applications, as well as for their established telegraph and telephone businesses. There appears to have been little difficulty in raising new capital to expand the Telegraph Condenser Company in 1933, which involved turning the organization from a private into a public company; Alice Brown made sure that she and her husband retained full financial and managerial control. During the Second World War the Admiralty took charge of S. G. Brown Ltd, replacing the Browns with its nominated directors. Brown retired in 1943. He sold his interest in the Telegraph Condenser Company to a syndicate, and S. G. Brown Ltd, including all gyro compass and radio telegraphy rights, to the Admiralty. In retirement, he devoted time mainly to cultivating orchids.<br>
<br>Brown's professional and business success was offset by tragedy in his private life; he and Alice had three children, but they all died young. He was a modest man, interested mainly in his electrical studies. Where possible, he preferred experimenting, lecturing, and writing technical papers to business administration. He depended largely on his wife to ensure that he had an adequate income to pursue these more congenial activities. He died at his home, Brownlands, Salcombe Regis, Sidmouth, Devon, on 7 August 1948, survived by his wife.<br>
