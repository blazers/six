<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Field,  Barron</span>  (1786&#150;1846), <span class="occ">judge and writer</span>, was born on 23 October 1786 in London, the second of the ten children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9386/', "Henry Field (1755&#150;1837)")</script>, apothecary to Christ's Hospital, and his wife, Esther (1759&times;64&#150;1834), daughter of John Barron of Deptford. The patristic scholar <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9383/', "Frederick Field (1801&#150;1885)")</script> was a younger brother. From at least 1806 until 1810 he was a legal and parliamentary reporter for <span class="italic">The Times</span> and its theatrical critic. He moved in a literary circle which included J. H. Leigh Hunt, Charles Lamb, H. C. Robinson, and William Wordsworth. He was the &#145;B. F.&#146; who accompanied Lamb and his sister on the excursion described in Lamb's essay &#145;Mackery End&#146;, republished in <span class="italic">Essays of Elia</span>. He wrote for Hunt's <span class="italic">Examiner</span> and <span class="italic">Reflector</span>; and when Hunt was convicted of seditious libel in February 1813, Field accompanied him in the coach from court to gaol and afterwards helped to sustain him during his two-year sentence.<br>
<br>After qualifying as an attorney and solicitor, Field was admitted on 20 June 1809 at the Inner Temple, London. In 1811 he published for students <span class="italic">An Analysis of Blackstone's Commentaries</span> (rev. edns, 1817, 1821). Called to the bar on 23 June 1814, he practised in London, on the Oxford circuit, and at the Worcester and Stafford sessions, until in May 1816 he accepted a judgeship in New South Wales. Before leaving he married on 4 July 1816 Jane Cairncross (<i>c</i>.1792&#150;1878), at St Dunstan-in-the-West, London. Leigh Hunt published a farewell epistle in verse in the <span class="italic">Examiner</span> of 11 August and Field and his wife sailed from Gravesend on 28 August; the couple arrived at Sydney on 24 February 1817.<br>
<br>New South Wales, established in 1788 to receive convicts transported from Great Britain and Ireland, was still essentially a penal colony, despite the arrival of free settlers, natural increase, and the growing number of emancipists (former convicts). In a letter dated 31 August 1817 and afterwards elaborated in &#145;Distant correspondents&#146; (<span class="italic">Essays of Elia</span>), Lamb asked Field, &#145;What do they do when they an't stealing?&#146;  (Marrs, 3.251). Attempts by the governor, Lachlan Macquarie, to rehabilitate the emancipists were resented by the &#145;respectable&#146; settlers, with whom they were in economic and social competition. In February 1818 Field privately warned Governor Macquarie that he considered certain fiscal duties imposed by Macquarie or his predecessors to be unauthorized by parliament and therefore illegal. The question was referred to the law officers in London, who took the same view.<br>
<br>The principal courts of New South Wales were the court of criminal jurisdiction, presided over by Judge-Advocate Wylde, and the supreme court, with civil jurisdiction where the cause of action exceeded &pound;50, which was constituted by Field as presiding judge and one or both of two lay magistrates. These courts ordinarily sat at Sydney; but in December 1818 Field went on circuit to Van Diemen's Land (Tasmania), which was then a part of New South Wales. This involved a return voyage of 1200 miles and an absence of seven weeks, and was the first visit by a superior court since settlement had begun fifteen years earlier. Field went again in January 1821 in company with Wylde, who conducted criminal trials there, thus saving the cost of litigants, witnesses, and prisoners travelling to Sydney.<br>
<br>Field inherited two years' arrears of work, but business in his court was not heavy: by the end of 1820 it had heard 165 actions at law and 13 equity suits. According to the report of the commissioner John Thomas Bigge few of them involved difficult questions. Most of Field's considered judgments were reported by himself and published in the <span class="italic">Sydney Gazette</span>: according to Roger Therry they &#145;did not acquire the weight of authority afterwards&#146;  (Therry, 332).<br>
<br>Although in strictness convicts were incapable of giving evidence, Field followed local practice in allowing them to do so, unless the conviction was formally proved. Otherwise, in a penal colony, there would often be no evidence available. Convicts who had been pardoned by the governor were allowed to sue and be sued. But in <i>Bullock v. Dodds</i> (1819), the court of king's bench held that such pardons did not remove the incapacity. When Field followed this decision, he incurred the hostility of the emancipists. He would, however, have admitted to practise an emancipist attorney named Crossley, but was overruled by the two magistrates sitting with him.<br>
<br>Field was accused, it seems &#145;unjustly&#146;  (Therry, 331), of encouraging litigation in order to increase the court fees he received. However, he did act precipitately and improperly in striking off the roll of attorneys a free settler named Amos, without allowing him to speak in his defence. Moreover, this occurred in proceedings initiated by Field, admittedly acting in a representative capacity only.<br>
<br>In 1819 Field edited and arranged for publication in London the <span class="italic">Memoirs of James Hardy Vaux</span>, an account of criminal and convict life by one already twice transported to New South Wales, to which he also contributed an introductory &#145;advertisement&#146;; further editions were published in 1827 and, with an introduction and notes, in 1964. Also in 1819 Field published in Sydney his <span class="italic">First Fruits of Australian Poetry</span>, which was the first book of poems printed in Australia and which evoked its unfamiliar fauna and flora. Later editions followed in 1823, 1941, and 1990. Field was president of the Agricultural Society of New South Wales, and with other members of the Philosophical Society of Australia, established in 1821 to conduct scientific studies, he compiled a union catalogue of their books.<br>
<br>Field suggested to Bigge various improvements to the judicial system of New South Wales, many of which Bigge recommended in his report. He also advised him that, in the then state of the colony, trial by jury and a legislative assembly should not be introduced; Bigge agreed. In a letter to the secretary of state, the third earl of Bathurst, dated 9 September 1822, Bigge wrote that Field possessed &#145;talents of a high order&#151;a cultivated mind and great quickness of perception&#146;; but not &#145;that degree of Temper and Deliberation that are necessary to conduct the Judicial business of such a Colony&#146;  (TNA: PRO, CO201/142 171). When the judicial institutions of New South Wales were being reorganized in pursuance of the act 4 Geo. IV c. 96 (assented to on 19 July 1823), Field was notified by Bathurst in a letter dated 4 August that his appointment was terminated. He sailed for England on 4 February 1824 and disembarked at Portsmouth on 18 June. By way of welcome Hunt wrote another epistle to him in verse, published in the eleventh volume of the <span class="italic">New Monthly Magazine</span>.<br>
<br>Field resumed practice at the bar in Liverpool and on the Oxford circuit. He edited a substantial work, <span class="italic">Geographical Memoirs on New South Wales</span> (1825), comprising reprints of official documents, papers given to learned societies, and articles in magazines&#151;some written by himself and others by various experts. His &#145;Journal of an excursion across the Blue Mountains of New South Wales, October 1822&#146;, from this volume, was reprinted by George Mackaness in 1950&#150;51. As with his poems, the <span class="italic">Geographical Memoirs</span> show a genuine interest in nature. So does his presenting of a large collection of Australian seeds to the Chelsea Botanic Garden managed by the Society of Apothecaries (of which his father had been a prominent member). In a letter dated 30 July 1827 to James Dowling, Field referred to New South Wales as a place &#145;in which I have still a stake in land and beeves, and shall always take an interest&#146;  (Dowling, 101&#150;2).<br>
<br>From March 1829 Field served as judge of the court of civil pleas at Gibraltar, until letters patent dated 1 September 1830 replaced it by the supreme court of Gibraltar and appointed Field as first judge of the new court. Here Field met the young Benjamin Disraeli, who &#145;found him a bore, and vulgar&#146;  (<span class="italic">Home Letters</span>, 27). Field resigned in 1841 and returned to England, where he lived at Torquay, Devon. He had written a well-regarded memoir of Charles Lamb (<span class="italic">Annual Biography and Obituary</span>, 1836, vol. 20), and in retirement edited plays, including several by Thomas Heywood, and wrote <span class="italic">Memoirs of Wordsworth</span>, first published in 1975 at Sydney.<br>
<br>Barron Field was regarded with considerable affection by his literary friends in London and by some of his associates in New South Wales, though ultimately he was not very successful either in the law or in literature. But he was a pioneer of literature and science in Australia, and continuing interest in his writings is shown by their publication during the twentieth century. Field died at Meadfoot House, Torquay, on 11 April 1846, survived by his wife, who died at Wimbledon in 1878 aged eighty-six. They had no children.<br>
