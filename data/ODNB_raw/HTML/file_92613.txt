<span class="headword">Fremantle <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Wynne]</span>,  Elizabeth <span class="st"> [Betsey]</span></span>, Lady Fremantle  (1778&#150;1857), <span class="occ">diarist</span>, was born at Falkingham, Lincolnshire, on 19 April 1778, the second of five daughters of Riccardo Gulielmo Casparo Melchior Balthazaro [Richard] Wynne (1744&#150;1798) of Falkingham, and his wife, Agathe Camille, <i>n&eacute;e</i> de Royer (<i>d</i>. 1799). She was known as Betsey from childhood. Little is known about her mother's family, save that her maternal grandparents had a country house near Lyons and survived torture by revolutionaries during the French Revolution. Her father was descended from the Wynnes of Gwydir, but although he was formally a member of the Church of England in order to secure his English inheritance, and had been educated in England, he and his brother and his three Catholic sisters had been brought up predominantly in Venice by their widowed mother, the formidable Anna Gazzini (<i>d</i>. 1751), a Venetian of Greek descent. Both Anna and her eldest daughter, Giustiniana (1737&#150;1791), became figures of scandal. Betsey's elder sister, Mary (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1770, <i>d</i>. after 1815), also challenged moral convention by leaving her husband, Count Francesco Montalbaro, and taking a lover in 1793. In 1798 she became the subject of Peter von Winter's opera <span class="italic">Marie von Montalban</span>. The unconventional lives led by Betsey's grandmother, aunt, and sister convinced her, while still an adolescent, of the need to &#145;keep an irreproachable conduct&#146;  (<span class="italic">Wynne Diaries</span>, 1952, 173&#150;4). Nevertheless, she may have owed to Giustiniana the habit of diary keeping, as Bartolomeo Benincasa (<i>d</i>. 1815), Giustiniana's last lover, gave Betsey and her next sister, Eugenia (<i>b</i>. 1780), their first diaries in 1789.<h2>
<a name="Educationandearlyyears"></a>Education and early years</h2>Richard Wynne sold his English estates in 1786 and moved with his family to the continent. Betsey spent the formative years of nine to nineteen criss-crossing Germany, Switzerland, and Italy with her family, learning how to move a large retinue at short notice over poor roads, how to deal with the ever present problem of drunk, thieving, or pregnant servants, and how to mix effortlessly in cosmopolitan, multilingual, European &eacute;lite society.<br>
<br>Betsey and Eugenia appear to have been introduced to diary-keeping as a teaching tool. Their earliest diaries were written in French or awkwardly direct translations into English, but they quickly became fluent linguists. In addition to a series of tutors who travelled with the family, specialized masters included the musician and composer Cimador 
    (Giovanni Baptista Cimadoro; 1761&#150;1805)
  , and the artist and engraver Francesco Bartolozzi, both of whom Betsey patronized again in London as a young married woman. The sisters developed into competent artists and skilled musicians.<br>
<br>By 1789 Betsey and Eugenia were already taking a more active part in adult society than usual for girls their age in England. Accompanying their parents shopping or visiting, or to church and cultural events, was not unusual, but they also regularly attended adult balls and parties, and numerous late-night masquerades and impromptu revels involving servants as well as family. For the precocious and self-contained Betsey this upbringing bred polished manners and a clear-sighted understanding of human foibles. It also gave her the self-confidence to express her own opinions. As an adolescent she came to despise both hypocrisy and what she saw as unseemly romping: &#145;young people should amuse themselves honestly and at the same time heartily but not romp about and show so much love for pleasure as to be justly ridiculed by everybody&#146;  (<span class="italic">Wynne Diaries</span>, 1952, 177). While she never eschewed pleasure and, especially as a young woman, was happy to play practical jokes on her sisters, don fancy dress, or dance all night, she retained a lifelong aversion to anything that could be interpreted as noisy, hoydenish behaviour.<br>
<br>Betsey's appearance, diminuitive, dark-haired and dark-eyed, could have led her to identify with her maternal French heritage, but she self-consciously defined herself as English as a teenager, siding ardently with the British against the French revolutionaries and identifying with all things English. Growing up surrounded by French &eacute;migr&eacute;s made her a confirmed monarchist and a believer in &#145;natural&#146; hierarchies, but it also left her with a confirmed dislike of the French and a belief in the superiority of the English character. This stemmed predominantly from her father's befriending of the French diplomat and royalist secret agent Marc-Marie de Bombelles, marquis de Bombelles (1744&#150;1822), and his family. Between 1792 and 1796 the Bombelles lived for extended periods with the Wynnes at Wartegg, Switzerland, and Ratisbon, Bavaria, apparently at the Wynnes' expense. Their presence placed the Wynnes at the heart of royalist circles, and the resulting atmosphere was febrile. The latest rumours from France caused frequent emotional upsets in a household plagued by personality conflicts. Betsey soon disliked the hot-tempered marquis and his ill-disciplined children intensely. When the two families finally decided to part company, after a particularly heated fracas with the marquis in 1796, she rejoiced, glad to be done with &#145;a <i>right</i> Frenchman &hellip; that hippocrite, that unthankful man, proud and vile&#146;  (<span class="italic">Wynne Diaries</span>, 1952, 185).<br>
<br>News of the progress of &#145;the duced French&#146;  (<span class="italic">Wynne Diaries</span>, 1952, 190) across Europe in 1796 alarmed Betsey's father enough to prompt him to flee Ratisbon. Arriving in Leghorn on 23 June 1796, the family was swiftly evacuated onto the English frigate <i>Inconstant</i>, captained by <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/10159/', "Thomas Francis Fremantle (1765&#150;1819)")</script>. Betsey was immediately captivated by his &#145;fiery black eyes&#146;  (<span class="italic">Wynne Diaries</span>, 1952, 196), and equally impressed with his character: &#145;He is good natured, kind, and amiable, gay and lively in short he seems to possess all the good and amiable qualities that are required to win everybodies heart the first moment one sees him&#146;  (ibid.). Almost at once Betsey was introduced to courtship, the British navy and the naval war that would dominate her married life.<h2>
<a name="Courtshipandmarriage"></a>Courtship and marriage</h2>After a brief period of separation, which the Wynnes spent in Toulon, where Betsey and her sisters became favourites of Admiral Sir John Jervis, the family accompanied Fremantle in the <i>Inconstant</i> to Elba, where Fremantle joined Commodore Horatio Nelson's attempt to secure British possession of the island. Meanwhile, less than a month after they met, Betsey and Fremantle were already discussing marriage. They had two obstacles to overcome: her father had to be persuaded that Fremantle's future prospects outweighed his immediate lack of fortune; and Fremantle himself had to be persuaded that his future prospects would not be harmed by marriage at this stage of his career. The fact that the older and more affluent Captain Thomas Foley (1757&#150;1833) of the <i>Britannia</i> was clearly enamoured of her as well, and that her father was very fond of him, added significantly to her anxieties. After spending the autumn in Porto Ferrajo, Elba, the Wynnes left for Naples at the end of December 1796 with Betsey's future still undecided, arriving in the <i>Inconstant</i> on 7 January 1797.<br>
<br>On 10 January 1797 Fremantle, his reputation and prospects enhanced by his role at Elba, finally secured Betsey's hand in marriage. The wedding, on the morning of 13 January, was organized by Emma, Lady Hamilton, and took place from the Hamiltons' home. Betsey was given away by Prince Augustus Frederick, a family friend dating from their time in Venice. Out of respect for Betsey's Catholicism, the couple confirmed their marriage with a blessing from a Catholic priest later that evening.<br>
<br>The next day Betsey bade farewell to her family and set sail in the <i>Inconstant</i> for Elba, along with the British viceroy of Corsica, Sir Gilbert Elliot, the Corsican politician and diplomat Pozzo di Borgo (1764&#150;1842), and the officer and military historian Colonel John Francis Drinkwater. She was to remain on board for much of the next eight months. In April they sailed for Gibraltar, and, from there, on to Lisbon. Not yet nineteen at the time of her marriage, Betsey adapted readily to life at sea and managed to be popular but not too familiar with the officers. Her unflappability also extended to her first pregnancy, which began within months of marrying. Even with the <i>Inconstant</i> on convoy duty, or cruising and periodically chasing prizes, there was time for visiting and dinners and entertainments, with Betsey performing on her pianoforte, at times accompanied by an officer who was a flautist. She spent her spare time reading, sewing, drawing, and being taught how to paint in watercolours. When Fremantle transferred to the <i>Seahorse</i> at Lisbon, she sailed with him to join Nelson and the advance squadron in the blockade of Cadiz. The very real dangers that this posed, both to Fremantle, who accompanied Nelson in the risky venture of bombarding the town, and to other officers and men, led her to decry the strategy, which she believed was being driven primarily by economic motives, and to cheer the lifting of the blockade.<br>
<br>On 25 July 1797 Betsey was on board the <i>Seahorse</i> at the second attack on Santa Cruz de Tenerife, where Nelson acted on faulty intelligence with disastrous results and a high loss of life. Betsey was present at the council of war and had been as convinced as the rest that &#145;the taking of this place seemed an easy and almost sure thing&#146;  (<span class="italic">Wynne Diaries</span>, 2.185). She had, for once, gone to bed rather than wait up for Fremantle, and woke to the news that many of the landing force had lost their lives and that Nelson, whose injuries that night cost him his right arm, had been rowed to the <i>Theseus</i> rather than to the closer <i>Seahorse</i>, in the hope of sparing her additional shock. Fremantle had himself been wounded and, while he was luckier than Nelson in keeping his arm, he was to suffer intensely from the wound for longer thereafter. Nelson's note to Betsey on 26 July&#151;&#145;God bless you and Fremantle&#146;&#151;is assumed to be his first left-handed writing. Jervis, now earl of St Vincent, who had decided at the beginning of July that Fremantle would take Betsey back to England in the <i>Seahorse</i> in the autumn, kept his word, and sent both Fremantle and Nelson home in August. For Betsey, who nursed them, the trip cannot have been easy. Nelson was recovering physically, but was sorely depressed about his future prospects, whereas Fremantle was in constant pain.<h2>
<a name="TheSwanbourneyears"></a>The Swanbourne years</h2>Betsey's life entered a new phase when she returned to England in September 1797. Once Fremantle's wound had healed sufficiently for them to travel, they went first to London, where they slipped immediately into the social life of the capital, and then to Stowe, Buckinghamshire, so that Fremantle could pay his respects to his patron, George Nugent-Temple-Grenville, first marquess of Buckingham. Betsey appreciated the importance of making &#145;le gentil&#146; to those who could forward her husband's career  (<span class="italic">Wynne Diaries</span>, 3.168). After the Fremantles settled at nearby Swanbourne, where they purchased a small estate in the summer of 1798, Betsey, her sisters, and later her children frequently spent extended visits at Stowe over family birthdays and the Christmas holidays. She seems to have been genuinely fond of the Buckinghams, especially the marchioness. The fact that the marchioness was a practising Catholic with a strong sense of duty may have helped to create an immediate link between them. Betsey's social and musical skills, her impeccable French, and her family's royal connections made her a valuable addition to the guest list when the Buckinghams were hosts to the prince of Wales and the duke of Clarence in 1805 and the exiled court of Louis XVIII of France in 1807.<br>
<br>On 11 March 1798 Betsey's first child, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/10160/', "Thomas Francis Fremantle")</script>, was born. Blessed with good health and unproblematic pregnancies, she went on to have another eight children: Emma Eugenia Elizabeth (<i>b</i>. 1799), Charles Howe (1800&#150;1869), Henry Hyde (1802&#150;1820), Augusta Henrietta 
    (Harriet; 1803&#150;1863)
  , Louisa (<i>c</i>.1806&#150;1810), William Robert (1807&#150;1895), Cecilia Mary (1809&#150;1871), and Stephen (1810&#150;1860). Unlike some aristocratic women, she enjoyed maternity and her domestic role, breastfeeding her children as babies and taking delight in them as they grew. Fremantle, as well, proved to be a loving husband and a proud and caring, if often absentee, parent. Between 1800, when he went back to sea in the <i>Ganges</i>, and his death in 1819, he spent the majority of his time at sea and his sorrow at being apart from his wife and children forms a leitmotif in his letters. Following Betsey's family practice, they brought the boys up as Anglicans and the girls as Catholics.<br>
<br>For a brief period in 1798 Betsey's entire family was reunited in England. Unfortunately, both her mother and father were already seriously ill and died within months of each other. The sisters were left as coheirs to their father's estate and, after seeing off a spurious claim by their uncle William, took equal shares, including &pound;23,000 in Bank of England stock  (<span class="italic">Wynne Diaries</span>, 3.6&#150;7). Although Betsey's younger sisters were nominally placed under the guardianship of the politician and diarist Henry Bankes, a distant Wynne connection, the task of chaperoning them and vetting potential husbands fell substantially on Betsey's shoulders. As spirited young women with fortunes of their own, Eugenia, Harriet (<i>b</i>. 1784), and Justina (1785&#150;1814) proved frustratingly immune to Betsey's and Fremantle's attempts to persuade them to use their fortunes to social advantage; each in turn married into the Scottish gentry for love not position. This caused some friction in the short term but, by the time that Betsey paid an extended visit to their various new homes in Scotland in 1811, it had vanished.<br>
<br>With Fremantle away at sea, Betsey managed the expansion of their estate, took growing interest in the farm, and continued her charitable attentions to the local sick and the poor, as well as attending to the needs of her family. She regularly shuttled her household between Swanbourne and London for the social season, and socialized astutely to forward Fremantle's and her family's interest. When Fremantle stood (unsuccessfully) for Aylesbury in the general election of 1802, she took on the duties of a political wife, making favours, entertaining agents and local gentlemen, and co-hosting a breakfast for the freeholders. Fremantle's brief tenure as MP for Sandwich in 1806&#150;7 required no additional effort, but the energy that she put into fitting up their accommodation at the Admiralty in 1806&#150;7 suggests that, had Fremantle's appointment as a lord commissioner of the Admiralty not been terminated by the fall of the &#145;ministry of all the talents&#146;, she would have put her social skills to political advantage.<br>
<br>Fremantle was appointed KCB on 2 January 1815, and Betsey thus became Lady Fremantle. Within a few weeks of Waterloo she and the children joined Fremantle for a tour of France, after which they proceeded to Italy, where Betsey met her sister Mary for the first time in two decades. She went back to sea with her husband, now commander-in-chief of the Mediterranean, in 1818, but he died very suddenly in December 1819. For the first time since she had started keeping her diary in 1789, she was unable to write.<h2>
<a name="Lateryearsandlegacy"></a>Later years and legacy</h2>The independence that Betsey had learned during the Napoleonic wars stood her in good stead as a widow. She remained close to her children, safeguarding and forwarding their interests. She continued to divide her time between Swanbourne and London, but also travelled frequently, including visits in 1839 to Baden Baden, and in 1847 to Scotland to see her sister Eugenia. As she aged she became more conservative, but she did not become more insular. She continued to keep her diary until a few days before her death at Cimiez, near Nice, or Nice itself, on 2 November 1857. She was buried at Notre Dame de Cimiez. Her will apportioned shares in her personal estate to all of her surviving children but Augusta and William.<br>
<br>All but one volume of Betsey's diaries survive. They provide a unique personal insight into important historical actors and the changes that occurred in Britain and Europe between 1789 and the 1850s. More important, they present an intimate and detailed view of the rich life experiences of an &eacute;lite woman of the time. Extracts from Betsey's diaries, supplemented with material from the diaries of Eugenia and Harriet, were published by Anne Fremantle as <span class="italic">The Wynne Diaries</span> in three volumes between 1935 and 1940. A single-volume, abridged version was published in 1952. In Swanbourne her concern for the well-being of the local people was commemorated in 2006 in the name of a new pub, the Betsey Wynne.<br>
