<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Atherstone,  Edwin</span>  (1788&#150;1872), <span class="occ">poet and writer</span>, was born on 17 April 1788 at Brewhouse Yard, Nottingham, the thirteenth of the fifteen children of Hugh Atherstone (1743&#150;1816), dyer, and his wife, Ann, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Green (1747&#150;1819). He was educated at Fulneck Moravian School in Yorkshire, and on his return to Nottingham in 1804 claimed to have married Mary Wainwright Pearson (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1832), niece of his organ teacher, although they never went through a legal marriage ceremony. This was a secret well kept from friends and family alike until the couple's separation in 1830, after her attempted suicide. They had one son (who died young) and three daughters.<br>
<br>From 1807 Atherstone worked as a music teacher at the Franciscan convent school in Taunton, and wrote occasional compositions. It was perhaps through Thomas Poole, well known in Somerset, that he met Southey and Coleridge, whose friendship he tried to cultivate with little success. Coleridge said of him, &#145;Nature wove him well but with coarse threads&#146;  (<span class="italic">Collected Letters</span>, ed. Griggs, 6.662). Atherstone was acquainted with various other eminent contemporaries, such as John Hunt, Thomas Moore, Scott, and Wheatstone, and was a close friend of the painter John Martin. He and Martin worked together on similar subjects, mostly biblical or classical history, each in his own art.<br>
<br>Atherstone's first publication in 1821 was a volume containing two poems, &#145;The last days of Herculaneum&#146;, and &#145;Abradates and Panthea&#146;; this was followed in 1824 by <span class="italic">A Midsummer Day's Dream</span>, illustrated by Martin. Next appeared the first part of his chief work, <span class="italic">The Fall of Nineveh</span> (1828&#150;30), an epic poem, and <span class="italic">The Sea-Kings in England</span> (1830), a novel about the times of King Alfred. Despite, or perhaps because of, these publications, Atherstone was often in debt. His works did not sell well, and he gained a reputation for verbosity. <span class="italic">The Fall of Nineveh</span> was published complete in 1847.<br>
<br>In 1831 Atherstone moved from Taunton to London, from where he regularly toured Britain lecturing in elocution and philosophy, and as a dealer and collector of paintings. He ran two art galleries in London, in Pall Mall and Great Marlborough Street. Late in life Atherstone published <span class="italic">The Handwriting on the Wall</span> (1858), a romance; <span class="italic">Israel in Egypt</span> (1861), an epic poem; and a revised edition of <span class="italic">The Fall of Nineveh</span> (1868). He was awarded a civil-list pension, and in 1861 moved from London to Bath, to benefit from cleaner country air. He died at 19 Macaulay Buildings, Bath, on 29 January 1872, and was buried at Bath Abbey cemetery.<br>
<br>In 1888 Atherstone's eldest daughter and lifelong companion, Mary Elizabeth Atherstone, published three of his plays which had failed to reach the stage in the 1820s. A fourth play about the rulers of Europe, considered too libellous even by John Hunt, remains in manuscript form. Of Atherstone's other daughters, Catherine married her cousin Dr William Guybon Atherstone, who became well known in Cape Colony, and Mary Ann married Dr George Bird, son of the poet James Bird.<br>
