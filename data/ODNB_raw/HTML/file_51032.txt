</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Davies, Dame  Gwen Lucy  Ffrangcon-</span>  (1891&#150;1992), <span class="occ">actress</span>, was born on 25 January 1891 at 195 Finchley Road, Hampstead, London, the daughter of David Thomas Ffrangcon-Davies (1855&#150;1918), choral singer, and his wife, Annie Frances, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Rayner. Her father was said to have taken the name Ffrangcon from a Welsh beauty spot. She was educated at South Hampstead high school and then studied for the stage under Mrs L. Manning-Hicks and Agnes Platt. As a child she saw Irving act, auditioned for Ellen Terry, and later played Tess of the d'Urbervilles at a private performance given at his home for its author, Thomas Hardy. A lifelong Christian Scientist, she never married but lived for many years in both England and South Africa with the actress Marda Vanne; together in the Second World War they ran a notable South African theatre management.<br>
<br>Ffrangcon-Davies made her stage d&eacute;but as a fairy in a 1911 staging of <span class="italic">A Midsummer Night's Dream</span>. She subsequently toured for some time, playing Kiki in <span class="italic">The Glad Eye</span>, Sombra in <span class="italic">The Arcadians</span>, and other roles. From 1917 to 1918 she worked in the censor's office. She sang the soprano lead in such choral dramas as <span class="italic">The Immortal Hour</span> and <span class="italic">The Birth of Arthur</span> at the Glastonbury festival (1919&#150;20) and subsequently at the Old Vic. She joined the Birmingham Repertory Company in 1921, and won critical acclaim for her acting in such J. M. Barrie plays as <span class="italic">Quality Street</span> (1921) and <span class="italic">The Admirable Crichton</span> (1922). She first made her name in London in 1923, creating the roles of Eve and the Newly Born in the first staging of Shaw's <span class="italic">Back to Methuselah</span>.<br>
<br>In 1924 Ffrangcon-Davies first played Juliet to John Gielgud's Romeo, thereby starting a stage partnership that was to last for almost half a century; during that time she was to be the Queen to his <span class="italic">Richard of Bordeaux</span> (1932) and Gwendolyn in his classic 1940 revival of <span class="italic">The Importance of being Earnest</span>, though two years later they had a rare joint failure in <span class="italic">Macbeth</span>. One of her longest-lasting roles was as Elizabeth Browning in <span class="italic">The Barretts of Wimpole Street</span>, which she played intermittently throughout the 1930s at home and abroad. While living in Marda Vanne's native Johannesburg from 1943 onwards she also scored considerable successes in such comedies as No&euml;l Coward's <span class="italic">Blithe Spirit</span>.<br>
<br>After returning to England in 1946, Ffrangcon-Davies played the Queen Mother in Terence Rattigan's unsuccessful <span class="italic">Adventure Story</span> (1949), but soon reclaimed her reputation at home with the 1950 Stratford season, where she succeeded Peggy Ashcroft as Beatrice to Gielgud's Benedick in <span class="italic">Much Ado about Nothing</span> and also played Portia in <span class="italic">Julius Caesar</span> and Queen Katharine in <span class="italic">Henry VIII</span>. She continued to tour at home and abroad, returning to the West End in 1954 to remind audiences of her considerable comic talent as Donna Lucia to the Charley's Aunt of John Mills. That same year she was an unforgettable Ranevskaya in <span class="italic">The Cherry Orchard</span> at the Lyric, Hammersmith, and two years later she became a founder member of the new English Stage Society at the Royal Court, where she played Rose Padley in the opening production by Nigel Dennis, <span class="italic">The Mulberry Bush</span>, going straight from there to play Agatha in T. S. Eliot's <span class="italic">The Family Reunion</span> at the Phoenix. Later she again replaced Peggy Ashcroft, a lifelong friend&#151;in Enid Bagnold's <span class="italic">The Chalk Garden</span> at the Haymarket (1957)&#151;before giving what many believe was her greatest performance, as the doomed, drug-ridden Mary Tyrone in the first London staging of Eugene O'Neill's <span class="italic">Long Day's Journey into Night</span> (1958) opposite Anthony Quayle.<br>
<br>Ffrangcon-Davies became a founder member of a great theatrical company, Peter Hall's Royal Shakespeare Company, which she joined for its first London season in 1961 at the Aldwych, playing with Leslie Caron in <span class="italic">Ondine</span> and also as the Queen Mother in Jean Anouilh's <span class="italic">Becket</span>. In 1963 she made her Broadway d&eacute;but (well into her seventies) as Mrs Candour in <span class="italic">The School for Scandal</span>. Back home she played Amanda Wingfield in Tennessee Williams's <span class="italic">The Glass Menagerie</span> at the Haymarket (1965) and Madame Voynitsky in Chekhov's <span class="italic">Uncle Vanya</span> at the Royal Court (1970).<br>
<br>Often rather too theatrical for film or television cameras, Ffrangcon-Davies was also unlucky perhaps in coming of the same unique theatrical generation as Peggy Ashcroft, Edith Evans, and Sybil Thorndike; all the same, her longevity ensured her a place in theatrical history, and her Shakespearian memory remained in such good shape that for a BBC television documentary, <span class="italic">A Juliet Remembered</span> (1988), she recited lengthy extracts from <span class="italic">Romeo and Juliet</span> without faltering. She also gave many memorable masterclasses in acting, and was a regular BBC radio broadcaster from the very early 1930s until a few months before her death. Asked by Nigel Hawthorne (who as a teenager had been inspired by her performances in South Africa) if she was frightened at all of dying, she merely replied &#145;One is always afraid of something new, dear.&#146; As Hawthorne noted, &#145;Gwen had the ability to express wonder and girlish rapture even in old age&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Independent</span>, 28 Jan 1992). Her career may well, in her own phrase, have &#145;come and gone a bit&#146;  (ibid.), but it was never less than remarkable, even when, in old age, both her sight and her hearing diminished so that she was, at the last, almost always playing from memory. Her last performance was as an elderly dowager in an ITV <span class="italic">Sherlock Holmes</span> special, recorded in 1991; she was, belatedly, created a dame in the birthday honours of the same year. She died on 27 January 1992, two days after her 101st birthday, at her home for many years, Tagley Cottage, Dyers End, Stambourne, Essex, of bronchopneumonia. A memorial service was held at St Martin-in-the-Fields on 18 June 1992.<br>
