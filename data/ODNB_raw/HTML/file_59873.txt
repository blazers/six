<span class="headword">Birkbeck,  Morris</span>  (1764&#150;1825), <span class="occ">farmer and writer</span>, was born on 23 January 1764 in Settle, Yorkshire, the only child of Morris Birkbeck (1734&#150;1816), Quaker minister, and his wife, Hannah, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Bradford, of Lancaster, who died a few days after his birth. On 23 April in 1794 he married Prudence Bush, daughter of Richard Bush, a prominent Quaker of Wandsworth, Surrey, and his wife, Prudence. Seven children were born before Birkbeck was left a widower in 1804. He never remarried.<br>
<br>Educated at the Friends' school in Tottenham from 1772 until 1776, when his father apprenticed him to a sheep farmer in Yorkshire, Birkbeck afterwards spent two years observing advanced agricultural techniques on large farms in Norfolk. With money borrowed from an uncle, a banker, he leased a farm in Hanford, Dorset, in 1785. By 1792 he was able to lease a farm of 1500 acres near Wanborough, Surrey. There he established his position as a successful commercial farmer with a reputation for importing and breeding merino sheep.<br>
<br>About 1802 Birkbeck withdrew from the Society of Friends and thereafter professed no religion. A decisive meeting with Richard Flower in 1811 enhanced his radical leanings. Flower had ties with major figures of Unitarian radicalism and early Romantic literature. With Flower's son George, Birkbeck toured France during the summer of 1814 and published his impressions in <span class="italic">Notes on a Journey through France</span> (1814). His praise of the beneficial effects of the French Revolution on the land, agriculture, education, and standard of living aroused considerable controversy.<br>
<br>A man who chafed at his inability to vote or hold public office, and at paying tithes, Birkbeck had a vision of founding a colony in republican America. Following his father's death in 1816, he emigrated at the age of fifty-three with four of his children to Virginia, where George Flower had bought land. Birkbeck had other ideas, and announced that he intended to settle north of the Ohio River because of his profound hatred of slavery.<br>
<br>After arriving in Boltonhouse Prairie in Edwards county, Illinois Territory, in the summer of 1817, and immediately purchasing about 1500 acres, Birkbeck published in 1818 both an account of the journey in <span class="italic">Notes of a Journey from the Coast of Virginia to the Territory of Illinois</span> and an enthusiastic invitation to others to emigrate to his projected colony in <span class="italic">Letters from Illinois</span>. Written in plain but lively prose that masked the underlying Romanticism of his message, the second book in particular praised the natural beauty of the prairies and the ease with which they might be cultivated. The two books received an astonishing reception not only in Britain but also on the continent of Europe. The fierce controversy they aroused in the press, journals, and pamphlets on both sides of the Atlantic magnified their impact. During the next few years, the &#145;English Prairie&#146; became a required stop for British travellers in the west, who in turn published differing assessments. The fame of Birkbeck's pioneering venture undoubtedly contributed to the rise in emigration during the hard times and political repression of the post-war period.<br>
<br>At one time scholars gave Birkbeck credit for recognizing the agricultural potential of prairie land, but there is no evidence that he cultivated the grassland. Although he presented ideas on ditching and fencing in his presidential address in 1823 to the first agricultural society in Illinois, his methods were not adopted. Above all, the projected colony failed to prosper. His hopes of founding a morally upright community were shattered when he learned of George Flower's adultery. He severed completely all communication with his wealthier partners. Even his most severe critics conceded his integrity and the persuasiveness of his pen. Because of his sanguine temperament, he misled himself as he misled others. He did none the less secure an honoured place in the history of Illinois. His newspaper articles and a pamphlet under the pseudonym Jonathan Freeman helped turn the vote against calling a special convention to amend its constitution of 1818 to legalize slavery.<br>
<br>Returning from a visit to Robert Owen in New Harmony, Indiana, on 4 June 1825, Birkbeck was drowned while attempting to swim his horse across the Fox River and was later buried at New Harmony. The small fortune that he had brought to America had disappeared. On his death he left 600 acres and a large house.<br>
