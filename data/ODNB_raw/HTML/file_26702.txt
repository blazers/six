<span class="headword">Stuart <span class="st"> [Stewart]</span>,  Esm&eacute;</span>, first duke of Lennox  (<em>c.</em>1542&#150;1583), <span class="occ">courtier and magnate</span>, was born in France, the only child of John Stewart or Stuart (<i>d</i>. 1567), fifth seigneur d'Aubigny, and his wife, Anne de La Queulle (<i>d</i>. 1579), fourth daughter and coheir of Fran&ccedil;ois, seigneur de La Queulle, and his wife, Anne d'Espinay. John Stewart, a Scot, had been adopted at an early age by the mar&eacute;chal d'Aubigny, who had made him his heir, and he had spent his life in France.<h2>
<a name="BackgroundandarrivalinScotland"></a>Background and arrival in Scotland</h2>Brought up by his mother at La Verrerie, near Aubigny, Esm&eacute; Stuart succeeded his father as seigneur d'Aubigny in 1567, and in 1572 married Catherine de Balsac (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1631), youngest daughter of Guillaume de Balsac, seigneur d'Entragues. Slim, with a neatly trimmed red beard, mild-mannered and affable, Aubigny was sent by the French in 1576 as an envoy to the Low Countries, and then went to England on a diplomatic mission, where he was reported to be in dispute with representatives of the infant Lady Arabella Stuart (as the name was usually spelt in England) over their competing claims to her dead father's earldom of Lennox.<br>
<br>Although to all appearance a Frenchman, Aubigny remained conscious of his Scottish origins. Not only was he in line for the Lennox titles and estates, he was also a descendant of James II, king of Scots, and he had been first cousin of James VI's murdered father, Lord Darnley. In the end the Lennox earldom was granted to his elderly uncle, Robert Stewart, bishop of Caithness, and when Robert married for the first time seven months later Aubigny would have been aware that if his uncle now had sons&#151;an unlikely prospect&#151;then their claims would supersede his. A sudden message from Scotland inviting him to visit his father's native land therefore arrived at a propitious moment. A journey north would allow him to establish his own position, and in any case the invitation apparently came from the king himself and could not be refused. Moreover, the leaders of the Hamilton family, hereditary enemies of the Lennox Stewarts, had recently been accused of the murder of two earlier regents of Scotland, James Stewart, earl of Moray, and Aubigny's uncle Matthew, fourth earl of Lennox. The downfall of Lord John and Lord Claud Hamilton seemed assured, and Aubigny could hope to benefit, not least because the main issue between the two families was their quarrel as to who had the senior position in the Scottish succession, both being descended from daughters of James II.<br>
<br>In September 1579 Aubigny therefore took leave of his wife and five young children and set out for Scotland. He was seen off at Dieppe by the French courtiers, led by the duc de Guise, and a few days later he landed at Leith and made his way to Holyroodhouse, where he presented himself to James VI. By 10 October Nicholas Errington, the English envoy, was writing to tell Walsingham that, &#145;Touching M. d'Aubigny, it appears that the king is much delighted with his company&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP Scot.</span>, <i>1574&#150;81</i>, 355). The newcomer had been given the fairest and nearest lodging to the royal apartments in Holyroodhouse. It seemed that he would spend the winter in Scotland and there was talk of his wife's coming to join him.<h2>
<a name="Risetoprominence"></a>Rise to prominence</h2>The young king was entranced with his charming, sophisticated 37-year-old cousin. Starved as he had been of affection throughout his childhood, James revelled in Aubigny's kindly attention. Here at last was a relative of his own, sensitive, cultured, and perceptive, who treated him as an adult, discussing theology and politics and poetry with him, respecting his views, and nurturing his self-confidence. James was overjoyed. Not everyone was so delighted with Aubigny's arrival, however, for it was widely believed that he had come as a Roman Catholic agent of the duc de Guise, to scheme for the overthrow of protestantism and the return of Mary, queen of Scots. James ignored the rumours, however, and after the Hamiltons were forfeited in November 1579 he made Aubigny commendator of Arbroath Abbey, a lucrative position previously occupied by Lord John Hamilton. On 5 March 1580 Aubigny was granted the earldom of Lennox, which his uncle had been persuaded to resign in his favour. By 13 September he was being mentioned as keeper of Dumbarton Castle, and on 11 October he was nominated chamberlain and first gentleman of the royal chamber.<br>
<br>Sir James Melville of Halhill believed that Lennox was &#145;of nature upright, just and gentle, but lacked experience in the state of the country&#146;  (<span class="italic">Memoirs</span>, 107), commenting that he would have been &#145;tolerable, if he had happened upon as honest counsellors as he was well inclined himself&#146;  (ibid., 27&#150;8). As it was, Lennox turned to James Stewart, later earl of Arran, who had been eagerly cultivating his friendship. Together they outmanoeuvred the increasingly unpopular fourth earl of Morton, formerly regent, and on 31 December 1580, at Lennox's prompting, Stewart accused Morton before the privy council of having participated in the murder of Lord Darnley. Morton was arrested and imprisoned. For the next twenty months, Lennox and Stewart governed Scotland.<br>
<br>Lennox and the young king now set about trying to silence the alarmist rumours about the earl's supposed intentions. On 28 January 1581 James signed the negative confession, a strongly worded document condemning &#145;the Roman Antichrist&#146; and all the doctrines of the Catholic church, and Lennox let it be known that he had converted to protestantism. His conversion appears to have been genuine and, if he had ever entertained the ambition of restoring Queen Mary to the throne, his views were modified by his growing loyalty to her son. When the duc de Guise early in 1581 put forward Mary's plan for an &#145;association&#146;, whereby she and James VI would rule Scotland jointly, Lennox's mildly encouraging response nevertheless included the insistence that James should retain his title as king. Any scheme for Mary's release would have to be led by Guise himself, Lennox said.<h2>
<a name="DukeofLennox"></a>Duke of Lennox</h2>Under Lennox's administration parliament set up a commission to improve the stipends of ministers, but this too failed to reassure the ultra-protestants. They noted with alarm the appointment of some of Mary's former supporters to the privy council in the aftermath of Morton's execution on 2 June 1581, but regardless of his subjects' misgivings James continued to shower gifts upon his favourite. On 5 June Lennox was granted the lordship and regality of Dalkeith, Aberdour, and other properties which had belonged to Morton, and on 5 August 1581 at an elaborate ceremony in Holyroodhouse he was created duke of Lennox, earl of Darnley, and lord of Aubigny, Tarboltoun, and Dalkeith, the only duke in Scotland. By now he and Stewart, then earl of Arran, were rivals rather than friends, with Arran protesting volubly against Lennox's right to bear the crown at the meeting of parliament in October. Presumably Arran's jealousy had been intensified by the knowledge that the king intended to have Lennox recognized as his heir during that session of parliament, but ecclesiastical opposition became so vehement that James had to abandon this plan.<br>
<br>The privy council had split into two separate factions. Arran and his sympathizers met at Holyrood, while Lennox and his supporters held their discussions at Dalkeith. Arran gave people to understand that he and his colleague were at odds because he was trying to prevent Lennox from plotting against protestantism, but their differences in fact had far more to do with their competing desires to control access to the king. To an extent matters were smoothed over on 2 December after Arran agreed to resign his office as captain of the royal guard, leaving Lennox in sole charge of the royal household. However, rumours of Lennox's involvement in Roman Catholic plots were still circulating. The situation was made worse when his administration refused to accept the condemnation of episcopacy by the general assembly of the Church of Scotland, and its arrangement for Robert Montgomerie to be appointed to the vacant see of Glasgow. Furious, the presbytery of Edinburgh excommunicated Montgomerie, but Lennox had the excommunication annulled by royal prerogative.<h2>
<a name="Fallfrompower"></a>Fall from power</h2>Early in 1582 Lennox was secretly visited by two Jesuits, William Crichton and William Holt, who invited him to take command of an army to be raised by Philip II for the invasion of England, with the aim of freeing Queen Mary and placing her on the English throne. Rumours about this scheme were rife and on 12 July the king was forced to issue a proclamation denouncing current allegations that Lennox was a &#145;deviser&#146; of &#145;the erecting of papistrie&#146; and reiterating that the duke had &#145;sworne in the presence of God, approved with the holie action of the Lord's Table&#146; to maintain protestantism and was &#145;readie to seale the samine with his blood&#146;  (Calderwood, 3.783).<br>
<br>These denials were in vain, and on 22 August 1582, in the Ruthven raid, a group of ultra-protestant notables, including former adherents of Regent Morton, seized the king in protest at Lennox's regime and the extravagant expenditure of the recently enlarged royal household. Led by the earl of Gowrie the Ruthven raiders took the government into their own hands for the next ten months. Arran attempted to ride to the king's rescue, but he was imprisoned, while Lennox was ordered to leave the country. Plunged into despair Lennox rode to Dumbarton where it was said that he was &#145;so far appalled and cast down as there appeared in him little courage or resolution&#146;  (Willson, 45). He knew his enemies were saying that he had been plotting to betray the king, and his greatest fear was that James had believed them and had personally ordered his banishment. Desperately, he wrote him a series of letters, but received no reply, for the king was in no position to respond.<br>
<br>Eventually Lennox rode back to Dalkeith. On 18 December he sent James another long letter, declaring that &#145;whatever might happen to me, I shall alwayes be your very faithful servant &hellip; in spite of all you will be always my true master, and he alone in this world whom my heart is resolved to serve&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP Scot.</span>, <i>1581&#150;3</i>, 223). That same day he rode for London, where he had an audience with Elizabeth I. She later told James VI in a letter about her conversation with Lennox, &#145;whom at the first we did roundly charge with such matters whereof we thought him culpable&#146;  (ibid., 251). Lennox next crossed the channel and was reunited with his family. He continued to send urgent letters to James, but early in February he fell seriously ill, in Paris. According to Calderwood he was suffering from &#145;a dissenterie, or excoriatioun of the inward parts, engendred of melancholie, wherewith was joyned gonorrhea&#146;  (Calderwood, 3.715). The attentions of the leading French doctors failed to save him, and as he lay dying he declared again that he was a protestant. He wished to be buried at Aubigny, he said, but he wanted his embalmed heart to be sent to James and commended his young children to the king. He died on 26 May 1583.<br>
<br>News of Lennox's death became known in Scotland on 4 June, and James could scarcely believe it. His distress was compounded when Aubigny's final letter to him arrived a few days later. That autumn the king wrote a long vernacular poem mourning the loss of his friend. &#145;Ane Metaphoricall Invention of a Tragedie called Phoenix&#146; tells the moving tale of a beautiful and exotic phoenix, which makes its way from Arabia to Scotland where it is tamed by the king. The other birds, envious, attack it, and, in spite of the monarch's efforts to protect it, it eventually flies away and dies in a foreign land:<blockquote>
<div class="indent">&hellip; now begin<br>
</div>
<div>My woes: her death makes lyfe to greif in me.<br>
</div> (Bergeron, 34)</blockquote>Whether the duke's embalmed heart ever came to Scotland remains unknown, but in November Lennox's elder son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26724/', "Ludovick (or Louis) Stuart (or Stewart)")</script>, arrived at James's invitation, and the king subsequently arranged the betrothal of Lennox's three daughters to Scottish noblemen. Lennox's widow lived until about 1631.<h2>
<a name="Thekingandhiscousin"></a>The king and his cousin</h2>According to one of James VI's biographers, the duke of Lennox &#145;possessed such genius for intrigue and deception that contemporaries and posterity alike have been baffled as to his true intentions&#146;  (Willson, 32). Nineteenth- and early twentieth-century historians were in no doubt as to Lennox's duplicitous motives in coming to Scotland, accepting that he was intent on subverting the protestant religion and restoring Queen Mary. More recent writers have been inclined to believe that he was prompted rather by self-interest and the desire to establish his claim to the throne. His brief intervention in Scottish affairs lasted for only three years, but his influence on the young James VI was considerable. The nature of their relationship has been the subject of much speculation, and from the start there have been allegations that Lennox introduced James not only to French poetry but also to homosexuality. According to one Scottish chronicler, &#145;His majesty having conceived an inward affection to the Lord d'Aubigny, entered in great familiarity and quiet purposes with him&#146;, while the church ministers accused the duke of setting out &#145;to draw the king to carnal lust&#146;  (ibid., 36).<br>
<br>&#145;I have such extreme regret that I desire to die rather than to live, fearing that that has been the occasion of your no longer loving me&#146;, Lennox had told James in his last letter  (<span class="italic">CSP Scot.</span>, <i>1581&#150;3</i>, 223). However, it would be a mistake to read too much into the often extravagant language of the sixteenth-century courtier. Lennox's evident affection for his lonely young cousin brought him a glittering career, but there is no cause to think that he deliberately exploited the king's adolescent sexuality for his own benefit. Whatever James's later sexual preferences, it is not unusual for a young adolescent to hero-worship a handsome and accomplished older man, and it may be that, closely related by blood as they were, they shared a genuine sense of affinity. It was undeniably a personal tragedy for them both when their mutually rewarding friendship evoked the bitter enmity of the Scottish courtiers and led to their final separation.<br>
