<span class="headword">Weldon,  John</span>  (1676/7&#150;1736), <span class="occ">musician</span>, was born at Chichester on 19 January 1676 or 1677 of unknown parentage. He was a chorister at Eton College under the organist, John Walter, and the college paid for him to receive lessons from Henry Purcell for a year from about March 1693 to March 1694. Later in 1694 he became organist of New College, Oxford. Three years later he wrote an ode, <span class="italic">A Song on the Peace of Ryswick</span>  (Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge, MU MS 120, pp. 60&#150;75). In March 1700 four prizes were offered for the best settings of Congreve's masque <span class="italic">The Judgment of Paris</span>. Weldon's setting, first performed on 6 May 1701, was awarded the first prize of &pound;100. Although John Eccles and Daniel Purcell, the second and third prize-winners, published their settings, Weldon did not, and the complete score survives in only one manuscript (Folger Shakespeare Library, Washington, MS W. b. 526). On 6 January 1701 Weldon was sworn in as a gentleman-extraordinary of the Chapel Royal and at the end of that year resigned his post in Oxford.<br>
<br>Weldon was appointed organist at St Bride's, Fleet Street, on 18 June 1702, and on 11 November 1703 he married Susanna Betton (<i>bap</i>. 15 July 1682) at Lavant, near Chichester. They had seven children. During this period he wrote a number of songs for plays and concerts, including vocal music for Motteux's interlude <span class="italic">Britain's Happiness</span> (1704), of which only one duet survives. On the death of John Blow on 1 October 1708 Weldon succeeded him as one of the two organists at the Chapel Royal. His appointment as second composer to the Chapel Royal also dates from this time, although the establishment of this post was not acknowledged in the Chapel Royal chequebook until 8 August 1715. He became organist of St Martin-in-the-Fields on 2 February 1714 without relinquishing his other posts. Two years later he published <span class="italic">Divine Harmony</span>, containing six solo anthems written for the countertenor Richard Elford, and at about the same time he composed a service in D (Royal College of Music, MS 2043) and a communion service in E[flat]. Most of his extant anthems, however, seem to be earlier than this. A revival of <span class="italic">The Tempest</span> with music by Weldon was advertised in the <span class="italic">Daily Courant</span> for 30 July 1716. No setting ascribed to him is known but it has been suggested that the setting usually attributed to Purcell may actually be Weldon's  (Laurie, &#145;Did Purcell set <i>The Tempest</i>?&#146;). He died at his home in Downing Street on 7 May 1736 after a long illness and was buried on 11 May in the churchyard of St Paul's, Covent Garden; he was survived by his wife. At the Chapel Royal he was succeeded as composer by William Boyce and as organist by Jonathan Martin, and at St Martin's by Joseph Kelway.<br>
<br>In addition to the works mentioned above, Weldon wrote about thirty anthems, two odes, some fifty songs, and a few instrumental pieces, although not all have survived. He was a composer of considerable talent but uneven achievement. At its best his music is by turns elegantly tuneful and deeply expressive, showing a keen sensitivity to the text and imaginative handling of harmony, key, and structure. He did not, however, always have the skill to sustain his ideas and tended to over-decorate his melodic lines and rely too heavily on repetitive patterns. Two of his anthems were printed in Boyce's <span class="italic">Cathedral Music</span>, volume 2 (1768), and others in Arnold's <span class="italic">Cathedral Music</span> (1790) and Page's <span class="italic">Harmonia sacra</span> (1800). Several of his songs, especially &#145;Let Ambition Fire thy Mind&#146; from <span class="italic">The Judgment of Paris</span>, &#145;From Grave Lessons&#146;, and &#145;The Wakeful Nightingale&#146;, remained popular throughout the eighteenth century. A few of his works were available in print at the end of the twentieth century.<br>
