</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Simcoe,  John Graves</span>  (1752&#150;1806), <span class="occ">army officer and colonial governor</span>, was born on 25 February 1752 at Cotterstock, Northamptonshire, the third son (and only child to reach adulthood) of Captain John Simcoe (1710&#150;1759), a naval officer of middle-class family who had obtained a grant of arms in 1747, and his wife, Catherine Stamford (<i>d</i>. 1766). After his father died in command of the man-of-war <i>Pembroke</i> early in the 1759 Quebec operations, the family moved to his mother's Exeter home, from where Simcoe was well educated for an army officer, at Exeter grammar school (1760&#150;65), at Eton College (1765&#150;8), and Merton College, Oxford (1769&#150;70). He was also admitted in February 1769 at Lincoln's Inn, before leaving for the army.<br>
<br>After a year with a military tutor at Exeter, through the influence of his mother's family Simcoe was commissioned ensign on 27 April 1770, by purchase, in the 35th foot, then serving in England; he embarked with his regiment for Ireland in April 1773, and was promoted lieutenant (by purchase) on 12 March 1774, serving as adjutant from 27 March 1772 until leaving the 35th. He sailed from Cork in April 1775, the 35th forming part of the first embarkation of Irish reinforcements for the army at Boston, arriving there from 11 June. In the Boston garrison Simcoe purchased a captaincy in the 40th foot, on 27 December 1775; and with the 40th he served on the 1776 New York and 1777 Philadelphia campaigns, being severely wounded at Brandywine. After being refused permission to raise a corps from the free black inhabitants of Boston, on 15 October 1777 he took command of the Queen's rangers, a loyalist &#145;legion&#146; of mixed light horse and foot; at first with the provincial rank of major, and later of lieutenant-colonel commandant, Simcoe made his name in the <i>petite guerre</i> of raids, reconnaissance, and outpost skirmishing that characterized its service. As contemptuous of the military capacity of his adversaries as he was of their republicanism, his leadership made the Queen's rangers the most successful of the American loyalist corps. He was captured in 1779 and spent six months as a prisoner. He was made brevet lieutenant-colonel in the army, on 19 December 1781, not long after being invalided home to Exeter, ending his six and a half years' service in the American War of Independence.<br>
<br>On 30 December 1782 Simcoe married Elizabeth Postuma Gwillim (1762&#150;1850) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/47795/', "Simcoe, Elizabeth Postuma")</script>], daughter of Lieutenant-Colonel Thomas Gwillim of Old Court, Ross, Herefordshire, and niece and ward of Simcoe's godfather, Admiral Samuel Graves. A wealthy heiress, she brought him a 5000 acre estate at Dunkeswell, near Honiton, Devon, on which they built Wolford Lodge, where they lived from 1788. Their marriage was happy, and they had three sons and eight daughters. Among their sons was the theologian <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25553/', "Henry Addington Simcoe")</script>. After being put on half pay late in 1783 with the disbandment of the Queen's rangers, Simcoe devoted his years at Exeter to convalescence and study, publishing there in 1787 his important military work, the <span class="italic">Journal of the Operations of the Queen's Rangers</span>, the outstanding tactical study of the <i>petite guerre</i> to emerge from the eighteenth-century American wars, an invaluable training and tactical manual for officers soon to be engaged with the light forces of the French revolutionary armies. Prefixed to the copy presented to the king was an essay summarizing Simcoe's views on the organization, training, and tactics of mixed light troops. He also published <span class="italic">Remarks on the Travels of the Marquis de Chastellux</span> (1787), condemning French intervention in America.<br>
<br>Having turned down Pitt's offer of 1788 that he stand for Honiton as a friend of government, Simcoe entered parliament in 1790 as member for the marquess of Buckingham's freeman pocket borough, St Mawes, Cornwall. A supporter of the administration, he spoke on several occasions and took a particular interest in colonial issues, but his goal was a military or colonial posting, which he secured when appointed lieutenant-governor (his commission dated 12 September 1791) of the new province of Upper Canada, under the Canadian governor-in-chief, Lord Dorchester. Simcoe, his wife, and two youngest children sailed from England on 26 September 1791, arriving on 11 November at Quebec, where they wintered. They reached the temporary capital, Newark (modern Niagara on the Lake), on 26 July 1792. He had in the meantime been made colonel in a general brevet promotion of 18 November 1790, and colonel-commandant of the reconstituted Queen's rangers, his commission dated 1 September 1791. The new Queen's rangers, raised for service in Upper Canada, were intended by Simcoe as military pioneers, to form the nuclei of new, well-ordered settlements, but in fact they were used mainly to open strategic roads to funnel settlement to the west of the province and to facilitate troop movements, then later for garrison duties. He was promoted major-general, in Canada, on 3 October 1794.<br>
<br>Simcoe threw himself into his governorship with the excessive enthusiasm that was characteristic of the man and, as so often in his career, his projections were on a scale beyond the resources provided for the Upper Canadian establishment. His task was to erect a framework of English civil government in the infant loyalist province, a land distribution system that would encourage settlement, and a structure for defence based on a militia and a small marine. His particular interest was in opening the trade and settlement of the south-western part of the province. Though he moved the provincial capital to the fortified harbour at York (Toronto), he envisioned the province as a strategic, offensive&#150;defensive bulwark wedged into the heart of the north-west, with naval bases on the lakes linked by roads radiating from a centrally located, inland &#145;place of arms&#146; at London (which he founded for that purpose) to forestall future American aggression. He cherished plans to create a flourishing educational system and Church of England in the province&#151;this, like his conception of the reraised Queen's rangers, to create a bastion of social and political conservatism and to prevent the emergence of American-style frontier democracy. However, his plans for municipal corporations, schools, a provincial university, and a full endowment of the Anglican church in Upper Canada were refused by the British government. A warm and sympathetic man, obviously zealous for the good of the province, he was apparently liked by Canadians. A lake, town, and county in Ontario were named after him. His governorship&#151;though the extensive goals that he set for it were mostly checked by the authorities at home, the Quebec governor-general, or his own legislative council, and though it has remained controversial among historians&#151;was generally successful, but the illness that dogged his career forced him to return home in the summer of 1796, resigning his governorship early in 1798.<br>
<br>Simcoe was appointed governor of San Domingo, with local rank as lieutenant-general dated 10 November 1796. In the island, where he arrived early in 1797, he worked to improve the defences against the insurgency of slaves and people of mixed race inspired by the French. His switch to the offensive displeased the British government, which had expected him to oversee a withdrawal to the western tip of the island. In July, his health failing him again, he was obliged to leave for home, though the following January he offered to return to the West Indies. By late 1797 he was at Exeter, in command of the western military district, to which he was sent under the ministry of his friend Henry Addington. He was promoted lieutenant-general on 1 January 1801. Plans to stand in the government interest for Plymouth at the election of 1802 were frustrated. He was given the colonelcy of the 81st foot on 18 January 1798, leaving it on 18 June 1798 for the colonelcy of the 22nd foot, which he retained until his death.<br>
<br>In July 1806 Simcoe was appointed commander-in-chief in India but in the meantime was sent with Lord St Vincent and Lord Rosslyn on a mission to Portugal. Ill health intervened, however, and Simcoe returned to Exeter, where he died on 26 October 1806. Simcoe was an inspiring soldier and a brilliant tactician, an affable and loyal comrade, and a lifelong student of history and writer of verse, but he was too great a projector, and his ambition outran the uncertain health that plagued him from early manhood. He was buried on 4 November 1806 in the chapel at Wolford Lodge.<br>
