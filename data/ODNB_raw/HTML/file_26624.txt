<span class="headword">Stradling, Sir  Edward</span>  (<em>c.</em>1529&#150;1609), <span class="occ">antiquary</span>, was the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26629/', "Sir Thomas Stradling (c.1498&#150;1571)")</script> and his wife, Katherine, daughter of Sir Thomas Gamage of Coety, Glamorgan. He seems to have attended Oxford University before being admitted to the Inner Temple in February 1552. While travelling in Europe in 1548&#150;9, he met in Rome Sir Thomas Hoby, later the English translator of Castiglione's <span class="italic">Il cortegiano</span>. His father's connection with the earl of Arundel enabled Edward to become MP for Steyning in 1554 and Arundel in 1558, and his family's Sussex connection was maintained when Edward married Agnes (<i>d</i>. 1624), daughter of the Catholic gentleman Sir Edward Gage of Firle, in November 1566. Although he never acquired position at court&#151;probably because of the Catholic sympathies of his father and younger brother David&#151;his cultivated interests forged good relations with people in high places. He was careful to allay suspicions about his loyalty after his father died in 1571: a letter in Welsh sent to him by the master of the English College at Rome was intercepted in Paris in March 1578, and two months later Stradling reported to the council his receipt of an anonymous letter exhorting him to declare his Catholic loyalties. Rather, he preferred to concentrate on Glamorgan and his prominent role in south Wales.<br>
<br>Stradling's position in Glamorgan society brought him into close contact with the Herbert earls of Pembroke, with whom relations were as tense as under Edward's father. He was sheriff of Glamorgan in 1573&#150;4, 1582&#150;3, and 1595&#150;6, and he was deputy lieutenant of Glamorgan by 1590. Stradling also served on many commissions in Glamorgan, from the earliest in 1555 until his death. In October 1573 he was knighted. The sources of tension with the earls of Pembroke were several. Like other landowners, Stradling resented the privileges of Cardiff's townsfolk, especially when it was suspected (as in 1586&#150;7) that they were trafficking with pirates. There was also controversy over who should pay for the repair of Cardiff Bridge. Even before his father died, he had composed a reply to Pembroke's argument about the relationship between his lordship of Cardiff and the sub-lordships of Glamorgan, including Stradling's own. The most spectacular conflict arose in 1584 over the marriage of Barbara Gamage, an heiress in the custody of her uncle Edward Stradling, for whose hand there was influential competition, including from the Herberts. Edward also disputed possession of the manor of Pen-llin with Pembroke in 1585. Even the queen's secretary, Francis Walsingham, was moved in November 1587 to advise Stradling to be reconciled with Pembroke. These rivalries did not prevent Stradling from serving as the earl's steward in his manor of Llantwit, or as steward of the St John's lordship of Fonmon and Pen-marc from 1575; nor did it discourage Stradling from sending Pembroke gifts of venison from the Stradling park.<br>
<br>Edward Stradling is most famous as a scholar and patron of the arts. Much of the surviving correspondence received by him reflects his intellectual links with John, Lord Lumley, and Thomas Sackville, Lord Buckhurst, the antiquaries Rice Merrick and William Camden, the Welsh lexicographer Thomas Wiliems, and Lewis Dwnn the herald. He was interested in history, antiquities, literature, numismatics, building, and education. The castle at St Donats was extended by Stradling in Renaissance style, to include a long gallery, terraced gardens, and a vineyard. The Welsh poet Tomas Lleision praised his home and gardens in Latin verse. In 1573 he transferred the remains of his ancestors to the Stradling chapel built by his father on the north side of St Donats church, commissioning paintings of some of them in 1590. He planned to establish a grammar school at Cowbridge, though it was his heir who carried it into effect. His books and manuscripts at St Donats became a lending library for his acquaintances, who lent chronicles and other books in return. Stradling acquired former monastic records, including the register of Neath which several antiquaries borrowed for their own work. His famous essay on &#145;The winning of the lordship of Glamorgan out of the Welshmen's hands&#146;, which he sent to William Cecil in the 1560s, was published by the historian David Powel in 1584. Reputedly master of seven languages, he financed in 1592 the publication of 1250 copies of Si&ocirc;n Dafydd Rhys's Welsh grammar in Latin, <span class="italic">Cambrobrytannicae &hellip; linguae institutiones</span>; the Glamorgan poet Meurug Dafydd complimented both Stradling and Rhys on their achievement. He died at St Donats Castle on 15 May 1609. His last will records his collections of arms and armour and ancient coins, as well as the books and manuscripts of a notable scholar. His commissioned portrait was hung near the effigy that his great-nephew and heir, Sir John Stradling, placed on Sir Edward's tomb in the mausoleum in St Donats church.<br>
