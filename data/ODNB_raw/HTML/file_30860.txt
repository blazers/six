</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Brooke,  Basil Stanlake</span>, first Viscount Brookeborough  (1888&#150;1973), <span class="occ">prime minister of Northern Ireland</span>, was born on 9 June 1888 at Colebrooke Park, co. Fermanagh, Ireland, the eldest of five children (three sons and two daughters) of Sir Arthur Douglas Brooke, fourth baronet (1865&#150;1907), of Colebrooke, and his wife, Gertrude Isabella (<i>d</i>. 1918), only daughter of Stanlake Batson, of Horseheath, Cambridgeshire. He succeeded his father as fifth baronet on 27 November 1907. His social class, family background, and co. Fermanagh upbringing exerted a powerful formative influence on him. His family first moved to Ireland from Cheshire in the late sixteenth century and was awarded estates in co. Fermanagh as reward for military service rendered in quelling the 1641 rising. Its most prominent characteristic thereafter was its consistent record of military service. Fifty-three of its members served in the two world wars (with Brooke's uncle, Alan Brooke, first Viscount Alanbrooke, the most prominent); twelve sacrificed their lives. In addition, it had a strong tradition of political activism. The Brookes repeatedly served as magistrates, sheriffs, and lord lieutenants within co. Fermanagh and from the eighteenth century intermittently represented the county in parliament. Though they did not think of themselves as other than Irish, when they spoke of standing up for Ireland it meant standing up for the protestants of Ireland. While their participation in the Orange order was generally at a local level, it was almost hereditary in character. Their response to the mounting nationalist challenge which emerged in Ireland during the late nineteenth century was to act uniformly and aggressively in defence of the Union.<h2>
<a name="Educationandearlycareer"></a>Education and early career</h2>Brooke's early career broadly conformed to the well-beaten paths trodden by innumerable sons of the Anglo-Irish gentry. After attending private school in southern France (at Pau) he proceeded to Winchester (1901&#150;5), followed by Sandhurst, and then served with the 7th Royal Fusiliers (1908&#150;11) and the 10th hussars in India and South Africa. During these years it was already evident that he fully identified with the defiant Unionism which had characterized the recent history of his family's political involvement. While on leave in December 1912 he helped inaugurate and organize the Ulster Voluntary Force in co. Fermanagh, and in March 1914 offered to resign his commission and &#145;return to help the loyalists in Ulster&#146;  (Barton, <span class="italic">Brookeborough</span>, 21). His military service was extended by the outbreak of the First World War. He served throughout the conflict with distinction; he rose to the rank of captain in the hussars, acted as aide-de-camp to General Byng, was mentioned in dispatches, and awarded the Military Cross in 1916 and Croix de Guerre with palm. His experiences on the western front affected him deeply. As a consequence, he lost his religious faith and in early 1916 (before the Easter rising) wrote to his sister of his growing conviction that civil war would be &#145;worse for Ireland&#146; than home rule  (ibid., 25).<br>
<br>In December 1918 Brooke returned to Colebrooke, intent on restoring his neglected estates, having been away from co. Fermanagh for much of the previous twenty-two years. Five months later (on 3 June 1919) he married Cynthia Mary (1897&#150;1970), second daughter and coheir of Captain Charles Warden Sergison, of Cuckfield Park, Sussex. Their relationship was to be tested and strengthened through bereavement and illness. His wife's social competence, unquestioning devotion, resilience, and determination sharpened his ambition and contributed to its fulfilment. The extent of his debt to her he frequently and willingly avowed in public. They had three sons; the eldest and youngest were killed in action during the Second World War, but the second son, John Warden, also a soldier, survived the war and later entered Northern Ireland politics.<br>
<br>Whatever his original intentions, on returning home Brooke was ineluctably drawn once more into the political turmoil which Ireland and Fermanagh were then entering. In June 1920 he organized Fermanagh Vigilance&#151;a small, local, part-time force, designed to counteract the escalating IRA campaign, protect property, and ultimately defend the Union. He decided against calling it the Ulster Volunteer Force in order to encourage Catholic recruitment. Subsequently, he was prominent among those who successfully urged the British government officially to recognize this and other similar organizations which had spontaneously emerged elsewhere in the north. When the Ulster Special Constabulary was established in September 1920 Brooke became Fermanagh county commandant. Almost imperceptibly and certainly unconsciously, through these actions he acquired a reputation and rose to a position of prominence among Ulster unionists. Sir James Craig, Northern Ireland's first prime minister, acknowledged his services by appointing him CBE and offering him a seat in the Northern Ireland Senate. He accepted, but had to relinquish it almost immediately, as the appointment contravened the <span class="roman">Government of Ireland Act</span> because he held an office of profit under the crown. Craig described him at the time as &#145;one of the finest leaders in Ulster today&#146;  (Barton, <span class="italic">Brookeborough</span>, 58). In 1929, Brooke became Unionist MP for the county at Stormont. He accepted the seat from a sense of duty, but also from political ambition; he regarded Colebrooke as &#145;never enough in itself&#146;  (ibid., 15). His thin, wiry frame, with the inevitable cigarette in hand, and clipped, Anglicized accent were to be a feature of Stormont for the next forty years.<h2>
<a name="BrookeatStormont"></a>Brooke at Stormont</h2>From the outset of his political career Brooke addressed public meetings with a frequency to which he was unaccustomed, and generally spoke in moderate tones. But on 12 July 1933 he made a speech which was sectarian in content, and he repeated its main themes several times over the next nine months. In his remarks he admonished audiences &#145;to employ good protestant lads and lassies&#146; and not Roman Catholics, as they were &#145;out with all their force and might to destroy the power and constitution of Ulster&#146;  (<span class="italic">Fermanagh Times</span>, 13 July 1933). He also warned of a &#145;definite plot&#146; whereby southern nationalists would attempt to &#145;infiltrate&#146; Northern Ireland and subvert its pro-Union majority. The timing of these comments owed much to the strained political context. The formation of de Valera's first Fianna F&aacute;il government in Dublin caused apprehension among unionists, while deepening economic depression threatened the party's unity by accentuating its class divisions. His comments also reflect Brooke's growing disillusionment at the persistent unwillingness of most northern nationalists to recognize Northern Ireland even in the short term. As employer, as politician, and later as minister he was more open-minded in his actual dealings with political opponents than these infamous remarks might suggest; they have unduly coloured subsequent assessments of his career. In mid-1940 he was even prepared to contemplate Irish unity if its attainment would induce de Valera to abandon &Eacute;ire's neutrality and so possibly ensure the defeat of Nazi Germany.<br>
<br>Brooke's political rise at Stormont was rapid. His progress reflects the dearth of unionist back-bench talent, his relative youth yet considerable experience, extensive social contacts, eagerness to serve, and exceptional personal charm. John MacDermott, a ministerial colleague, said of him that he could have &#145;sold sand to the Arabs&#146;  (interview, 11 May 1979). In May 1929 he was made junior whip and parliamentary secretary at the ministry of finance, and in 1933 became minister of agriculture. At the latter he was knowledgeable, relished the personal contact with farmers afforded by his post, and was supported by civil servants of exceptional quality, who were eager to implement locally the marketing schemes and other radical policy changes then being initiated by Westminster. Though often in later years caricatured as &#145;a lazy man of limited ability&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Autobiography of Terence O'Neill</span>, 40), as a young politician he quickly acquired a reputation for enterprise, energy, and competence, and his influence and standing within the government rose measurably.<br>
<br>The coming of war was always likely to benefit Brooke's career, enhancing the relevance of his social connections and military background and providing increased scope for his pragmatism and flair for publicity. Craig dissuaded him from returning to full-time military service and, for the first time, he soon began clearly to emerge as a likely future premier. From the outset he demonstrated an unwavering commitment to allied victory. Partly because of his energetic leadership the farmers of Northern Ireland, alone of any region in the United Kingdom, exceeded their tillage quota during 1939&#150;40. His ministerial performance stood out in the context of a Stormont government which in the late 1930s and early 1940s reached unprecedented levels of incompetence and thus attracted increasingly virulent criticism from unionist back-benchers. None the less, Lord Craigavon remained premier and refused to make the cabinet changes which his critics thought necessary.<h2>
<a name="TheAndrewsgovernment"></a>The Andrews government</h2>Craigavon's death (in November 1940) did not presage any substantive improvement in governmental performance. The ageing John Andrews (minister of finance) who succeeded was unsuited to wartime leadership. Critically, he refused to purge the &#145;old (ministerial) gang&#146;, which was reshuffled rather than recast. Brooke became minister of commerce, a small and hitherto ineffectual department widely blamed both by back-benchers and the public for the persistently high levels of local unemployment. There, supported once more by talented officials, he energetically sought more contracts for local firms from mainland supply departments, unashamedly exploiting his contacts at Westminster, while striving to improve the woeful production record of some of the province's leading heavy industries. Such was his success that, by April 1943, regional unemployment had dropped to 19,000, 5 per cent of the insured population (it had been almost 72,000 in November 1940).<br>
<br>Meanwhile, support for the Andrews government was collapsing. In particular, it attracted criticism because of its lack of preparation for the German air raids (April&#150;May 1941), its mishandling of the conscription question later that year, its temporary suspension of Belfast corporation, the steady deterioration in local labour relations, and the perceived inadequacy of its post-war planning. The outcome was a wide-ranging Unionist Party revolt which sought sweeping changes in the composition of both leadership and cabinet. The climax was reached at a meeting of Unionist MPs on 28 April 1943 when, faced with ministerial resignations and a possible party split, Andrews agreed to resign. His miscalculations regarding the strength of opposition led him to attribute his fall to the manipulative skills of his successor, Brooke. However, the evidence suggests otherwise; Brooke had consistently urged Andrews to strengthen his government (offering to resign himself to facilitate the process), had been genuinely surprised by the scale of the crisis, and had made no attempt to exploit the unfolding events. Subsequently, he alone was capable of forming a government commanding a Commons majority, and he was eventually asked to do so by the governor, Lord Abercorn. He immediately appointed a new ministerial team (which included Northern Ireland's first non-Unionist Party government member, H. C. Midgley) and it was broadly successful in achieving its agreed priorities&#151;to bring greater drive to the war effort, devise plans for the post-war years, and maintain the constitution.<h2>
<a name="PrimeministerofNorthernIreland"></a>Prime minister of Northern Ireland</h2>In 1945 Brooke pressed to have national service extended to Northern Ireland in order to lower future unemployment levels, to underline the area's constitutional status within the Union, and also in the hope of attracting Britain's goodwill. Such was his enthusiasm for this proposal that he even suggested increasing state subsidies to local Catholic schools in an attempt to reduce church opposition to it. However, Attlee decided to exclude the six counties from the operation of the <span class="roman">National Service Bill</span> in 1946; none the less, Stormont&#150;Westminster relations had meanwhile become markedly closer. This was mainly due to Northern Ireland's cumulative contribution to the war effort&#151;through its provision of goods and agricultural produce, its volunteer recruits, the commercial and strategic role of its ports and bases, and latterly its use as a training ground and launching pad for military offensives. Acting partly from a sense of gratitude the Treasury in 1943 agreed to provide the region with increased financial support to enable it to catch up with social welfare provision elsewhere in the United Kingdom. This Brooke eagerly welcomed, as he was convinced that &#145;the only chance for the political future of Ulster&#146; was if she became &#145;so prosperous that the traditional political attitudes are broken down&#146;  (B. E. Barton, <span class="italic">Northern Ireland in World War Two</span>, 130).<br>
<br>The improvement in intergovernmental relations seemed threatened by the British Labour Party's electoral victory (9 July 1945). Brooke subsequently feared the imposition from Westminster of &#145;very strong socialist measures&#146; combined with pressure on his government to accept Dublin rule  (Barton, &#145;Relations between Westminster and Stormont&#146;, 2). None the less he opposed party colleagues who, alarmed by the sweeping economic measures being introduced by UK ministers, urged that Northern Ireland should seek refuge in &#145;dominion status&#146;. He regarded this option as impracticable given Northern Ireland's financial dependence on Britain. Moreover, his relationship with the Labour leadership soon became surprisingly cordial. Both he and his colleagues broadly welcomed the welfare state legislation, aware not only of the extent of local need, but also that the reforms would widen the gulf in social services between north and south, thus reinforcing partition, and would appeal, in particular, to the protestant working class. In Herbert Morrison's opinion the Stormont ministers behaved throughout like &#145;moderate socialists&#146;  (ibid., 8).<br>
<br>J. A. Costello's decision to withdraw &Eacute;ire from the empire and create a fully independent &#145;Republic of Ireland&#146; (with effect from 8 April 1949) provided the unlikely setting for arguably Brooke's foremost political achievement. In the context of &Eacute;ire's secession and an associated anti-partition campaign he urged that unionists be given reassurance within the text of the <span class="roman">Ireland Bill</span> (the Westminster measure ratifying the south's change of status). This Attlee accepted; he included a declaratory clause, stating that Northern Ireland would remain within the Union for as long as a majority at Stormont wished. In fact he had needed little persuading, mainly because he was advised by a high-level government working party that the province's continued inclusion within the United Kingdom was a vital British strategic interest. Its report continued:<blockquote>So far as can be foreseen it will never be to Great Britain's advantage that Northern Ireland should form part of a territory outside His Majesty's jurisdiction. Indeed it seems unlikely that Great Britain would ever be able to agree to this even if the people of Northern Ireland desired it. (Barton, &#145;Relations between Westminster and Stormont&#146;, 12)</blockquote>Constitutional security, improving welfare services, and economic growth helped ensure that the 1950s and early 1960s were Northern Ireland's most harmonious and promising years; its post-war experience contrasted starkly with the relative stagnation and isolation of the south. Mounting unionist confidence was expressed in the increasing willingness of some party members to consider reform. Meanwhile, the voting behaviour of the minority, its increasing political activism within the six counties, and the ignominious collapse of the IRA campaign of 1956&#150;62 all suggested that it was becoming more reconciled to partition. None the less, there were limits to the level of consensus achieved. Numerous nationalist grievances remained, including the restricted local government franchise and its allegedly gerrymandered electoral boundaries, the religious discrimination practised by public bodies and private firms in the north, and the perceived inadequacy of state funding for Catholic schools.<br>
<br>The Stormont government's failure to initiate fundamental reform was due in large part to Brooke's obsession with unionist unity. He feared a party split which might potentially endanger Northern Ireland's constitutional position. Regarding the minority, his strategy centred throughout on his belief that social reform and economic progress alone would eventually undermine its nationalist aspirations. Thus he failed to support those Liberal Unionists who actively sought accommodation with Catholics by recruiting them into the Unionist Party and were conscious of the changes that had taken place in post-war political and social attitudes. He argued that this was impracticable on political grounds, and noted privately that public &#145;speeches [on this issue] will only delay matters&#146;  (B. E. Barton, <span class="italic">A Pocket History of Ulster</span>, 1996, 111). From the late 1950s British officials were already warning his government of the &#145;risk of political disturbance&#146;  (ibid., 110) in Newry and Londonderry if religious discrimination was not counteracted. Through his inaction Brooke helped perpetuate the endemic and ultimately fatal sectarian divide in Northern Ireland politics. It is difficult to avoid the conclusion that he failed to rise to that higher level of leadership which does not simply pander to its own supporters but dares to chip away at their prejudices. Brooke was born into the landed gentry and became a soldier by instinct and inclination, but he was driven into politics primarily from conviction&#151;the need to defend and preserve the Union which was then threatened. In his view, during the following decades the threat to its survival persisted and the necessity to defend it therefore did not diminish; this remained his first priority. He himself conceded that he was less &#145;ecumenical&#146; than others, adding in his own defence, &#145;it must be remembered that I lived through &hellip; the most troubled of times&#146; in Ireland's history  (Barton, <span class="italic">Brookeborough</span>, 234). Though made a viscount in 1952 and later offered an earldom for his services to the state, he never attempted to become a truly national leader with significant cross-community support.<h2>
<a name="Retirement"></a>Retirement</h2>On 25 March 1963 ill health, old age, and mounting back-bench criticism of his failure to arrest rising unemployment and the drift of unionist voters in Belfast to the Northern Ireland Labour Party impelled Brooke reluctantly to resign as prime minister; he was succeeded by his minister of finance, Captain Terence O'Neill. He retained his seat in parliament until 1968, was created KG in 1965, and developed commercial interests&#151;as chairman of Carreras (Northern Ireland), a director of Devenish Trade, and president of the Northern Ireland Institute of Directors. He was also made an honorary LLD of Queen's University, Belfast. Meanwhile his wife, Cynthia, had served in the Second World War as senior commandant of the Auxiliary Territorial Service, and was created a DBE in 1959. She died in 1970, and the following year Brooke married Sarah Eileen Bell, daughter of Henry Healey, of Belfast, and widow of Cecil Armstrong Calvert FRCS, director of neurosurgery at the Royal Victoria Hospital, Belfast.<br>
<br>Brooke died at home at Colebrooke on 18 August 1973; he was survived by his second wife. He was cremated at Roselawn cemetery, Belfast, three days later, and in deference to his wishes his ashes were scattered on the demesne. He was succeeded in the viscountcy by his only surviving son from his first marriage, John Brooke. It might seem an appropriate as well as a tragic irony that the latter (then minister of state for finance) should have delivered the final speech from the dispatch box at Stormont prior to its suspension by Edward Heath's Conservative government on 28 March 1972. In it he quoted from a poem by Rudyard Kipling entitled &#145;Ulster&#146;, written in 1914, about the time his father's involvement in the political affairs of the province might be said to have begun. It ended with sentiments which Sir Basil fully shared:<blockquote>
<div>Before an empire's eyes the traitor claims his price.<br>
</div>
<div>What need of further lies? We are the sacrifice.<br>
</div>
</blockquote>
