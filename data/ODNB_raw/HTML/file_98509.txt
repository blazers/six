<span class="headword">Love,  Thomas George</span>  (1792/3&#150;1845), <span class="occ">journalist in Argentina</span>, was born in January 1792 or 1793 in London, close to Hyde Park, which he later emphasized in repudiating a newspaper report that had referred to him as &#145;The Cockney&#146;  (<span class="italic">British Packet</span>, 8 Dec 1838). He received a classical education and became a merchant's clerk in London; after travelling on the continent of Europe he was sent to Buenos Aires to manage a British firm's local agency. He arrived in October 1820, and in 1822 took charge of the British Commercial Room, founded as a business meeting place by the first British merchants to become established on the River Plate. In 1829 members of other nationalities were admitted to the renamed Buenos Aires Commercial Rooms (Sala Comercial de Buenos Ayres), which Love owned. <span class="italic">A Five Years' Residence in Buenos Ayres</span>, &#145;by an Englishman&#146;, published in London in 1825, is attributable to Love. The work, addressed to a British readership, vividly describes the customs of Buenos Aires, its institutions, culture, education, literature, and theatre. It was later translated into Spanish and is still the principal source of information for Argentinian life in the early years of independence.<br>
<br>In 1826 Love founded an English weekly periodical, the <span class="italic">British Packet and Argentine News</span>, published in Buenos Aires on Saturdays from 4 August 1826 to 25 September 1858. As well as internal and political news, it contained a complete list of shipping news of the River Plate, and was the principal source of information for foreign residents. The newspaper was a mute witness to local politics until 1829, when the struggles between Unitarios (centralists) and Federales persuaded him to applaud the election as governor of Juan Manuel de Rosas (Federal). Along with many other Britons in Argentina, Love viewed Rosas as the only leader who would bring order to the country. This position was not shared either by the local Unitarios or by the British merchants of Montevideo, who criticized his actions and dubbed the <span class="italic">British Packet</span> &#145;the official mouthpiece&#146; of Rosas's dictatorship. Under the first French blockade of Buenos Aires (1838&#150;40) the British merchants of Uruguay profited at the expense of their Buenos Aires counterparts and great rivalry arose between the two British groups. The rivalry was accentuated by the Argentinian siege of Montevideo (1843&#150;51), initiated by Rosas and the Uruguayan Manuel Oribe, head of the Blanco party in their war against the Uruguayan President Rivera's Colorado party, supported by the Argentinian Unitarios exiled in Montevideo. In mid-1842 the Montevideo merchants founded their own periodical, the <span class="italic">Britannia and Montevideo Reporter</span>, to counteract the <span class="italic">British Packet</span>; it accused Love of being a traitor to his country and a lackey of Rosas. Responding to their allegation that Rosas read every line of the <span class="italic">British Packet</span> before it was published, Love answered that &#145;under the administration of Governor Rosas, never has an editor in any part of the world, been more unshackled than we have been&#146;  (<span class="italic">British Packet</span>, 6 Aug 1842).<br>
<br>Love wrote fiercely against the actions of Commodore John Purvis, commander of the British naval forces in the River Plate, who supported Rivera and the Unitario cause, and the British minister from 1845, William Gore Ouseley. Love's position was backed by the British community in Buenos Aires. In July 1845, when the rupture of relations between Argentina and Britain was imminent, he ridiculed the offer by the British squadron to transport British residents of Argentina to Montevideo as a place of safety, leaving behind the property they had built up over the previous three decades  (<span class="italic">British Packet</span>, 19 July 1845). He believed that Britain had begun an absurd, illegal, and unjust war (&#145;O God! That our country should have joined in this most infamous bastardly crusade against its best friends&#146;; ibid., 1 Nov 1845) and had violated the sovereign rights of Latin American countries, interfering in affairs that should have been resolved by Argentina and Uruguay alone. He was convinced that underlying these actions was the objective of enforcing the free navigation on the Paran&aacute; and Uruguay rivers, and that the British and French were treating the Argentinian republic not as a member of &#145;the great family of nations&#146; but as one of the &#145;mere vassals of the crowned heads of Europe&#146;  (ibid., 19 July 1845).<br>
<br>Love died, of an unexpected illness, in Buenos Aires on 28 November 1845, during the Anglo-French blockade of the River Plate. An obituary referred to his ambition to strengthen the bonds between Britain and the Argentinian republic, and his tireless effort to impress upon the British government the duty, and expediency, of recognizing Argentinian rights of sovereignty and independence. He was involved in founding the principal British charitable, sporting, cultural, and religious institutions in Buenos Aires: &#145;Never was there a man so esteemed by the British residents of this country&#146;  (Mulhall, 578). A good-humoured man, as a writer &#145;his normal tone&#146; was &#145;of humorous irony&#146;, enlivened by quotations from Virgil and Shakespeare. In physical appearance he was remarkable for having no hair, not even eyebrows. He was said to have adored the women of Buenos Aires, though with &#145;disinterestedness&#146;  (Groussac), and died a bachelor.<br>
