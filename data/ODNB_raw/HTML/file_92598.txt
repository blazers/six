<span class="headword">Pountain, Sir  Eric John</span>  (1933&#150;2003), <span class="occ">industrialist</span>, was born on 5 August 1933 at 10 Chestall Road, Cannock Wood, Staffordshire, the son of Horace Pountain, a waterman at the local waterworks, and later a builder, and his wife, Elsie May, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Lloyd. He left Queen Mary's Grammar School, Walsall, at the age of sixteen to join the small building business then managed by his father and went on to do national service in the RAF. In 1956 he joined F. Maitland Selwyn, a local estate agency specializing in new housing developments, and became joint principal partner three years later. His major customer was John Mclean &amp; Sons Ltd, a publicly quoted midland house builder. On 21 June 1960 he married Joan Patricia Sutton, a thirty-year-old hairdresser and daughter of Frederick Sutton, publican. They had a son and daughter.<br>
<br>With his partners, in 1964 Pountain established Midland and General Developments Ltd to build houses largely for the private sector at a time when rising living standards enabled more and more Britons to own their own homes. His business did well and in 1969 was bought for &pound;250,000 by Mclean, which had suffered from poor profits. It was immediately reorganized and &#145;forged ahead&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 21 Sept 1972). It is hard not to see the hand of Pountain in this reorganization, and he was soon appointed chief executive. In these early years he was credited with pioneering the fully furnished show house, but in fact it seems to predate him. A business trip to the USA in the early 1960s had left him deeply impressed by American methods of selling, which he employed at home.<br>
<br>In 1973 Tarmac, a publicly quoted construction business based in Wolverhampton, acquired Mclean in order to diversify further into the growth area of house building. Pountain's expertise was especially attractive to Tarmac and he became chief executive of its new housing and property divisions. A quarter of Tarmac's profits were soon generated by Pountain; they came as much from tight financial control as from organic growth. His influence within Tarmac grew steadily so that in 1979, when huge losses were sustained through a poorly handled acquisition, and notwithstanding his limited knowledge of the mainstream business, he was appointed chief executive after a purge of senior management. In 1983 he combined this role with the chairmanship.<br>
<br>Tarmac had grown sleepy after many years of rapid growth through acquisition. Pountain put in hand a drastic reorganization to cut costs, to instil strict financial discipline, and to devolve decision making and break loose from Tarmac's stultifying centralism; its head office had become known as the Kremlin. Cost controls, wide margins, generous operating ratios, empowerment of divisional management, and its accountability for target shortfalls were hallmarks of what Pountain told outsiders was &#145;Tarmac Style&#146;. In an industry renowned for strong characters, it was his charisma and ruthlessness, coupled with old-fashioned charm, that made it work. &#145;Tarmac Style&#146; was widely copied.<br>
<br>In the boom years of the mid-1980s Tarmac appeared to prosper as never before, in six years transforming itself from the &#145;near bust&#146; business of 1978 into Britain's largest construction company  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 1 Sept 1985). On the tenth anniversary of Pountain's appointment as chief executive profits of almost &pound;400 million were recorded, up from &pound;26 million in 1978, on a turnover that had quadrupled to almost &pound;3 billion. Headline contracts included the channel tunnel and the Falkland Islands' airbase, but most money came from the mundane activities of quarrying and house building; Tarmac emerged as the largest house builder in the UK. By any standards it was an impressive achievement and Pountain, far more than anyone else, was responsible for it. He was much lauded, being, <i>inter alia</i>, businessman of the year in 1987.<br>
<br>Both ideologically and for sound business reasons Pountain strongly supported Margaret Thatcher's government. Tarmac contributed generously to tory party funds and found room on its board for Thatcher's ally Cecil Parkinson after his resignation from the cabinet in 1983. Thatcher recognized in Pountain the type of thrusting, no-nonsense businessman needed to sort out British industry and turn the country around. He was knighted for services to exports in 1985.<br>
<br>In 1991, as the worst recession since the inter-war years engulfed British industry, Tarmac (which in 1988 had made a profit of &pound;400 million) recorded losses of &pound;350 million. Pountain had completely misjudged the severity of the economic downturn and Tarmac suffered very much more than its competitors, especially in house building and investment in the USA. Pountain's devolved management structure had proved unresponsive when urgent retrenchment was needed, and analysis was to show that in the decade before 1991 the business had suffered a severe net cash outflow averaging &pound;20 million a year. With such losses, heads had to roll in order to satisfy disillusioned investors who reckoned that Tarmac under Pountain had lost its way; he resigned as chief executive in 1992 and as chairman a year later. In 2000 a still weakened Tarmac was acquired by Anglo American plc.<br>
<br>Pountain was much sought after as a non-executive director of public companies even after his ejection from Tarmac. The success of his chairmanship of the engineering business IMI plc (1989&#150;2001) and the James Beattie department store group (1987&#150;2002) was widely acknowledged, although they had distracted him from Tarmac's affairs; he also held directorships of, among others, Midland Bank (1986&#150;92) and United Newspapers (1992&#150;8). He had links with many charities and good causes. As with his business connections, invariably these were based in the west midlands, the region from which he originated and of which he was a passionate champion. He died at Queen's Hospital, Burton upon Trent, on 19 October 2003, of heart disease and cancer. He was survived by his wife, Joan, and their two children.<br>
