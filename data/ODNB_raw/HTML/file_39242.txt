<span class="headword">Ali,  (Chaudhri) Muhammad</span>  (1905&#150;1980), <span class="occ">prime minister of Pakistan, 1955&#150;6</span>, was born on 15 July 1905 in Nangalambia village, Jullundur district, Punjab province, India. His father was Chaudhri Khairuddin, a farmer and member of the Arain community, his mother, Ayesha Khairdin; he was the third of five children, with two elder sisters and two younger brothers. Muhammad Ali was educated at Nangalambia high school and at the University of the Punjab, Lahore, where he gained an MSc. He had the reputation of being an outstanding student and for the year after he graduated taught chemistry at Islamia College, Lahore.<br>
<br>In 1928 Muhammad Ali entered the Indian audit and accounts service. In 1932 he was seconded as accountant-general to Bahawalpur state, where he set the finances on a sound footing and planned the repayment of the state's debts to the government of India. In 1936 he joined the finance department of the government of India, rising to become deputy financial adviser on military finance in 1939, joint financial adviser on military finance and additional financial adviser, department of war and supply, in 1943, and financial adviser, department of war and supply, in 1945. He was only the second Indian to hold this last post. In 1942 he toured the war fronts in the Middle East, visiting El Alamein, Tobruk, and Iran. In 1945 he was a member of the Hydari commission to negotiate an agreement over items in short supply in the United Kingdom; in 1946 he was a member of the Indian lend-lease mission to the United States; and from June 1947 he was the member representing Pakistan, alongside H. M. Patel representing India, of the two-man steering committee which worked out the details of the division of the assets of British India. In this capacity he also worked with Patel as secretary to the partition committee, which presided over the whole process.<br>
<br>From 1947 to 1956 Muhammad Ali was a major figure in the establishment of the Pakistani state. From August 1947 to October 1951 he was secretary-general of the civil service. Acutely aware of the enormous problems which confronted the government of the new state, he set out to establish a greater degree of administrative centralization than had existed in British India. His post was to be the key link between the cabinet and the bureaucracy; he appointed officials not just at the central but also at the provincial levels and was the decision maker in all matters to do with the administration. During these years he acquired considerable influence over the affairs of Pakistan. The prime minister, Liaquat Ali Khan, &#145;was very much under the influence of Chaudhri Mohammad Ali&#146;  (Khan, 40), noted the future martial law ruler Ayub Khan. Muhammad Ali left his own record of the difficulties of these founding years in his book <span class="italic">The Emergence of Pakistan</span> (1967).<br>
<br>After the assassination of Liaquat Ali Khan in October 1951 Muhammad Ali joined the cabinet as minister of finance and economic affairs. During the years 1952&#150;4 he led Pakistan's delegation to the Commonwealth Finance Ministers' Conference and the annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund and of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development. Over the same period he laid the foundations of Pakistan's planning commission. On 7 August 1954 he was elected leader of the Muslim League party in the constituent assembly. On 11 August 1955 he became prime minister, leading a coalition between the Muslim League and the United Front of East Pakistan.<br>
<br>The crowning achievement of Muhammad Ali's premiership was to bring to an end the nine-year period of constitution making with the promulgation on 23 March 1956 of the first constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan. He had been closely involved in the negotiations leading up to this moment. The key issue in this process was how to create a constitution in which the Bengalis, who formed the majority of the country's population, would not dominate the state at the centre. Under the so-called Muhammad Ali formula the five provinces of the west wing of Pakistan would agree to form one unit while the Bengali east wing would agree to a status of parity with the west. The first stage of the process was achieved with the passage of the <span class="roman">One Unit Bill</span> on 14 October 1955, and the second with the adoption of a federal and parliamentary constitution for the country in March 1956. Unfortunately, Muhammad Ali was keener to make a constitution than to make one which would work. His constitution weighted power too much in favour of the president and exacerbated relations between centre and province, and province and province. On 8 September 1956, despairing of being able to govern, he resigned. No elections were held under the constitution. Politics became increasingly chaotic until, in October 1958, Ayub Khan declared martial law.<br>
<br>Muhammad Ali was a dedicated constitutionalist and devoted himself to opposing the martial law regime. In 1958 he founded the Tahrik-I-Istehkam-I-Pakistan Party for the consolidation of Pakistan, the protection of the constitution, separate elections for non-Muslims, and the establishment of a welfare state. In 1959 he merged his party with the Nizam-i-Islam Party. In 1960 he stirred up much controversy through his widely publicized reply to Ayub Khan's constitutional commission, in which he urged the restoration of parliamentary democracy and expressed his fears that the presidential system would lead to dictatorship. In 1964 he played the leading part, along with Khwaja Nazimuddin, in bringing together utterly dissimilar parties in the Combined Opposition Party, which sought to restore parliamentary democracy and to remove within ten years the economic disparity between East and West Pakistan. The party's candidate for the presidency was Fatima Jinnah, the sister of the founder of Pakistan; despite having the full weight of the government machine ranged against her, she gave Ayub Khan a good fight in the elections of January 1965.<br>
<br>In October 1969, six months after the fall of Ayub Khan, Muhammad Ali retired from politics. He became a deeply religious man, devoting much of his time to reciting the <span class="roman">Koran</span> and reading Islamic literature. His wife, who survived him, was Razia Sultana, daughter of Dr Muhammad Jan of Amritsar. They had four sons and one daughter. He died at his home in Karachi from heart failure on 1 December 1980.<br>
<br>Muhammad Ali was primarily an administrator. As a politician he had no following and did not seek one. He was of equable temperament and adopted a rational and pragmatic approach to issues. If his contemporaries assessed him as a major contributor to the consolidation of the Pakistani state, subsequent comment has tended to focus on his contributions, through both his successes and his failures, towards establishing the dominance of a military-bureaucratic &eacute;lite in the governance of that state.<br>
