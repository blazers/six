<span class="headword">Godfrey,  Thomas</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1721), <span class="occ">apothecary and inventor of Godfrey's cordial</span>, was probably one of the many Thomas Godfreys who were baptized in various Hertfordshire parishes during the middle years of the seventeenth century. He should not be confused with Ambrose (Hanckwitz) Godfrey (<i>d</i>. 1741), chemist, of Southampton Street, London, who in the late seventeenth century issued handbills advertising &#145;good cordials as royal English drops&#146;. Very little seems to be recorded about Thomas Godfrey's life and career; his will, drawn up on 27 July 1721, described him as a &#145;chirurgeon&#146; of Hunsdon, Hertfordshire. It was not uncommon for medical practitioners of that era, in the provinces as well as in London, to make up their own medicines for patients, and then begin to market them more widely when demand began to grow. No wife or children survived Godfrey, but he mentioned a brother and two sisters in the will, which was proved in London on 28 October 1721.<br>
<br>As no reference was made in Godfrey's will to the cordial or its recipe, it is not surprising that rivals in Hertfordshire were very soon vying for the trade. In December 1721 John Fisher, &#145;physician and chymist&#146;, advertised that he had the true formula from Godfrey, and warned the public that illiterate and ignorant persons, such as bakers, maltsters, and goldsmiths, were striving to manufacture the cordial, even though the skill needed was beyond their reach, &#145;so that by their Covetousness and Pretensions, many Men, Women, and especially Infants, may fall as Victims, whose Slain may exceed Herod's Cruelty&#146;  (<span class="italic">Weekly Journal</span>, 23 Dec 1721).<br>
<br>Not to be outdone, Thomas Humphreys, of Ware, surgeon, two months later publicized his version of the cordial, allegedly concocted according to a recipe made out in Godfrey's own hand. Whatever the result of the two doctors' battles, the list of &#145;nostrums and empirics&#146; in the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> for 1748 mentions only Mr Godfrey of Newcastle's cordial for the stomach: one of the cheapest of all those listed, at 6<i>d</i>. a bottle. Partly because of the medicine tax, its price had risen to 9<i>d</i>. by the end of the century.<br>
<br>In 1823 Thomas Wakley, first editor of <span class="italic">The Lancet</span> and scourge of nostrum-mongers, published an analysis of Godfrey's cordial. Its contents were found to include Venice treacle, ginger, rectified spirits of wine, oil of sassafras (or medical bark), and tincture of opium. Its sweetness and agreeable flavour, added to its ability to knock out or at least dull the senses of the most fractious patient, made it a boon for distraught mothers and lazy nurses: a forerunner of the notorious nineteenth-century Mrs Winslow's Soothing Syrup from the United States, which was well laced with morphia.<br>
<br>In 1837&#150;8, no fewer than twelve children were recorded as having been killed by Godfrey's cordial, but some of the differing varieties then on sale were widely known to be less dangerous than others. After the introduction of the National Health Service in 1948 the cordial was still occasionally prescribed, despite being held to be a poison. Later Godfrey was immortalized by his inclusion in the <span class="italic">Oxford English Dictionary</span>, a lexicographic privilege bestowed on the very few, such as Robert James and Thomas Holloway, who had also gained celebrity as quacks.<br>
