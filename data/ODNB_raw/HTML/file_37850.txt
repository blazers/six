<span class="headword">Philipps, Sir  John</span>, fourth baronet  (<em>c.</em>1666&#150;1737), <span class="occ">politician and evangelical patron</span>, was born about 1666 (the evidence of his funerary monument as to his date of birth being demonstrably unreliable). He was the second but first surviving son of Sir Erasmus Philipps, third baronet (<i>d</i>. 1697), of Picton Castle, Pembrokeshire, a Commonwealth commissioner for the propagation of the gospel, and his second wife, Catherine (<i>b</i>. 1640/41), the daughter of Edward Darcy of Newhall, Derbyshire. He entered Westminster School as a king's scholar in 1679 and attended Trinity College, Cambridge (where he matriculated in 1682), and Lincoln's Inn (from January 1684).<br>
<br>Of puritan stock, and imbued with his family's sober piety, Philipps grew up a wholly devout Anglican, anxious above all for the survival and renewal of a church beset, as he saw it, by spreading laxity and licentiousness. In January 1697 he became fourth baronet on the death of his father, and on 12 December of the same year he married Mary (<i>d</i>. 1722), the daughter and heir of an East India merchant, Anthony Smith. They had three sons and three daughters. While MP for Pembroke boroughs from 1695 to 1702 (he was to sit again, for Haverfordwest, 1718&#150;22), Philipps was responsible for the introduction of several legislative measures to suppress &#145;vice and profaneness&#146;, notably the <span class="roman">Blasphemy Act</span> of 1698, aimed principally at anti-trinitarian heretics, and the ill-fated &#145;immorality&#146; bill the following year, originally designed to tighten the laws against prostitution, but injudiciously extended to make adultery itself a misdemeanour, and for this reason rejected by parliament as impracticable. To his critics it seemed as if Philipps, &#145;the Welsh Owl&#146;, had &#145;run mad with reformation&#146;.<br>
<br>Outside parliament Philipps was involved in the local societies for the reformation of manners, and was one of the first to join the similarly orientated Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge (SPCK), taking an active role in its agitations against playhouses and against duelling. On one occasion he ostentatiously refused a challenge from an infuriated opponent in a lawsuit, preferring to endure public humiliation rather than call out his tormentor (though he did complain to the Commons of the breach of privilege), and earned the public thanks of the society for setting such a &#145;noble and Christian&#146; example. When the SPCK switched its primary focus towards educational and evangelizing enterprises, Philipps was a generous and constant benefactor, &#145;the ornament, and in a great manner the support&#146; of the society for many years. At his own expense he established no fewer than twenty-two charity schools in Pembrokeshire alone. He was a member of the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts and the East India mission, and a commissioner for the building of fifty new churches, and he also took a close interest in the relief and resettlement of continental protestant refugees.<br>
<br>There was always a subsidiary social and political objective behind Philipps's reforming zeal, to combat crime and disorder through a reimposition or at least an encouragement of religious discipline. He viewed himself as a &#145;patriot&#146; (of an old-fashioned whiggish stamp), and his philanthropic efforts as an extension of his &#145;patriotism&#146;. &#145;The endeavours of a man truly good&#146;, he once wrote, &#145;are not confined to this or that particular design, but lay hold on all opportunities of doing the best service he can to the souls and bodies of mankind.&#146; But the real impetus derived from an overpowering experience of Christian faith. A correspondent of the Halle pietists, and heavily influenced by them, he was an enthusiastic patron of many evangelical preachers, notably George Whitefield and the Welsh revivalist Griffith Jones, who became his brother-in-law and intimate friend. In his latter years, though plagued by failing eyesight, he gave considerable practical encouragement to the Oxford &#145;methodists&#146;, whose predilection for preaching and catechizing accorded fully with his own.<br>
<br>Philipps died on 5 January 1737, &#145;suddenly, of a fit of apoplexy, as he was sitting in his chair at his house in Bartlett's Buildings, Holborn&#146;, and was buried in St Mary's Church, Haverfordwest. He was succeeded first by his son <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22114/', "Erasmus Philipps")</script>, and then by a younger son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/39715/', "John Philipps")</script>, &#145;a notorious Jacobite&#146;.<br>
