<span class="headword">Easton, Sir  James Alfred <span class="st"> [Jack]</span></span>  (1908&#150;1990), <span class="occ">air force officer and intelligence officer</span>, was born in Winchester on 11 February 1908, the youngest in the family of two sons and five daughters of William Coryndon Easton, chemist and botanist, and his wife, Alice Summers. He was educated at Peter Symonds School, Winchester. He passed into the Royal Air Force College at Cranwell in 1926, and was commissioned into the RAF in 1928. He held a series of flying appointments, including a spell in biplanes co-operating with the army on the north-west frontier of India (1929&#150;32) and duties in Egypt (1934&#150;6). He was also increasingly regarded as an able young officer with a promising future. In 1937 he was posted to Canada as RAF armament liaison officer with the Canadian national ministry of defence (1937&#150;9). There he met and married in 1939 Anna Mary (<i>d</i>. 1977), daughter of Lieutenant-Colonel John Andrew McKenna, of the Royal Canadian Engineers, from Ottawa. Not only was it a very happy marriage, but it had a strong influence on his subsequent career. They had a son and a daughter.<br>
<br>Jack Easton was posted back to the UK in May 1939 to resume operational flying duties at RAF Wyton with 139 squadron of Bomber Command. A period of intensive training of new pilots and crew followed until, at short notice, he was transferred in October of the same year to staff duties within the intelligence directorate of the Air Ministry. His initial appointment was to set up and develop a new section, AI2G, as a nationwide organization designed to secure technical intelligence from crashed German aircraft. Promoted wing commander in 1940 and group captain in 1941, as well as being mentioned in dispatches that year, he and his staff gradually concentrated increasingly on the problem of technical innovations introduced by the Luftwaffe, particularly in the field of navigational aids and radar. In 1943 he became an air commodore, and was director of the intelligence (research) department at the Air Ministry. He represented the RAF's interests on Winston Churchill's Crossbow committee, whose function was to consider all means of countering the threat of the V1 flying bomb and the V2 rockets. He also became involved in the allocation of RAF aircraft for the clandestine dropping of agents into north-west Europe. All this brought him increasingly in touch with organizations and individuals outside the Air Ministry, including the Special Operations Executive and the Secret Intelligence Service (MI6), where he worked closely with the gifted young Professor R. V. Jones. His clear mind, considerable administrative ability, cool temperament, and gift for getting the best out of different groups with differing vested interests, made him an increasingly respected figure in the intelligence world.<br>
<br>Immediately after the Second World War, Easton was guided towards MI6, for which he had excellent qualifications. Sir Stewart Menzies, the chief of the service at that time, was glad to accept him. When Menzies retired in 1951, and Major-General John A. Sinclair took over as &#145;C&#146; or head of the service, Easton was appointed his deputy, with the clear understanding that he would eventually take over.<br>
<br>Easton made a substantial contribution towards rationalizing and uniting a service that had developed too fast in the war. Within the service he was liked and trusted. Aside from his wide management responsibilities, he gave particular attention to the burgeoning relationship with the American intelligence services and to the creation of the Australian external intelligence service, as well as to political affairs in south-east Asia and the Far East. When the treachery of H. A. R. (Kim) Philby, Guy Burgess, and Donald Maclean was discovered in 1951, Easton was one of those whose minds remained calm and objective at a time when Whitehall in general, and the Foreign Office in particular, wrung their hands. He decided in the summer of 1951, after a careful review of the evidence, that Philby was guilty. It was in this context that he first worked closely with Dick White of the Security Service (MI5). He dealt with the Americans pragmatically over the case. He understood the clear distinction in Britain between a firm belief in guilt and the many difficult security problems involved in an open trial in a public court before a British jury. The fact that the Philby case did not destroy relations between MI6 and the CIA for very long was partly due to Easton's calm pragmatism.<br>
<br>For the next few years Easton worked closely with Sinclair. However, the world was changing and the influence of the armed services in Whitehall was gradually declining. The year 1956 was a climacteric, with the twentieth party congress in Moscow, the disaster and folly of the Suez affair, the Commander Lionel Crabb incident, and the Soviet invasion of Hungary. The Crabb case, in which Easton was in no way involved (he was in Malaya at the time), was in itself of little importance and did not upset the Russians. But time and chance turned it into a political and governmental time bomb, and it was used as a reason for dismissing Sinclair. Dick White, the head of MI5, was appointed to replace him (as the first civilian head of MI6) late in 1956. Easton served him loyally, and with grace, as his deputy, but he was told that the succession would not be his; he was not prepared to accept this. That he did not become chief of MI6, as planned, was not due to any failure on his part, but was perhaps the result of a switch of power in Whitehall from the armed forces to the Cabinet Office and the Foreign Office.<br>
<br>In 1958 Easton was offered a respectable job as consul-general in Detroit, Michigan. He accepted the post without outward bitterness. He was for ten years a popular consul-general there. On his retirement in 1968 he decided to remain in the area which he had found so congenial. He became a much respected member of various Detroit-based industrial concerns, and a convivial golfing companion at the Grosse Pointe country club. In 1988 he caused a sensation when he publicly discussed the Kim Philby affair with the author Anthony Cave Brown before the latter's biography of Sir Stewart Menzies was published (<span class="italic">The Secret Servant</span>, 1988). In 1980 he married Jane, widow of William H. Walker, of Detroit, and daughter of Dr Joseph Stanley Leszynski, surgeon, also of Detroit.<br>
<br>Easton was slim and dark-haired, of medium height, and dressed neatly. He was appointed an officer of the American Legion of Merit in 1945, CBE in 1945, CB in 1952, and KCMG in 1956. He died on 19 October 1990 at Grosse Pointe, Michigan.<br>
