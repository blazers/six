<span class="headword">Williams,  Rowland</span> <span class="st"> [<em>pseud. </em>Hwfa M&ocirc;n]</span>  (1823&#150;1905), <span class="occ">Congregational minister and poet</span>, was born in March 1823 at Pen-y-graig, near the village of Trefdraeth, Anglesey, the son of Robert Williams, farmer, and his wife, Grace, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Rowlands. When he was five years old his parents went to live at Rhostrehwfa, near Llangefni, and from that place he took his bardic name (M&ocirc;n is the Welsh for Anglesey). He was brought up as a Calvinistic Methodist until the age of fourteen and was then apprenticed to a carpenter, working at his trade at Llangefni, Bangor, Deiniolen, and Y Felinheli. In 1847 he returned to his native county and was raised to the pulpit by Smyrna Independent Church at Llangefni; in the same year he entered the Independent (Congregational) college at Bala. On completing his course he received a call from churches at Bagillt and Flint, where he was ordained on 4 June 1851; two years later, on 12 May 1853, he married his predecessor's sixty-year-old widow, Mary Evans, the daughter of Abraham Williams. His next pastorate was at Bryn Seion, Brymbo (1855&#150;62), and for a while he also took charge of a church at Wrexham. After a brief but strenuous ministry at Bethesda, the chapel after which the Caernarvonshire slate-quarrying village was named, in 1862 he moved to the church at Fetter Lane, London (later to become Tabernacle, King's Cross), where he was to remain until 1881. After returning to Anglesey in that year as minister of Llannerch-y-medd, where he was unhappy, he moved to Llangollen, Denbighshire, seven years later. He retired in 1893 and went to live in Rhyl, Flintshire.<br>
<br>Hwfa M&ocirc;n, as he was generally known in Wales, was a gifted preacher but not in the front rank, for his congregations found him very long-winded. It was, rather, for the prominent part he played in the pageantry of the national eisteddfod that he was held in high esteem by the public. He was invested as a member of the Gorsedd of Bards of the Isle of Britain at Aberffraw in 1849 and won his first bardic chair, one of many prizes he was to accumulate, at a local eisteddfod held at Llanfair Talhaearn, Denbighshire, in 1855. The highest distinction of all, the chair of the national eisteddfod (which is awarded for verse in the strict metres), came his way in 1862, when his ode &#145;Y flwyddyn&#146; (&#145;The year&#146;) was successful at Caernarfon; his triumph was all the greater in that he defeated the veteran Eben Fardd (Ebenezer Thomas), whom posterity has judged to be the better poet. He won the chair again in 1873 and 1878, and the crown (given for verse in the free metres) in 1867. Collected editions of his verse, both entitled <span class="italic">Gwaith barddonol Hwfa M&ocirc;n</span>, were published in 1883 and 1903. Like so many of his contemporaries towards the end of the nineteenth century, he was dominated by the rules of <i>cynghanedd</i>, the traditional prosody above which the Welsh poet is expected to soar, and there now seems to be little literary merit in his work.<br>
<br>From 1875 to 1892 Hwfa M&ocirc;n's part in the eisteddfod's competitions was more often that of adjudicator than competitor, and he was much in demand in that capacity. In 1894, after the death of Clwydfardd 
    (David Griffith; 1800&#150;1894)
  , he was elected archdruid. His personality and staunch belief in the antiquity and authenticity of the gorsedd&#151;it had, in fact, been devised by Iolo Morganwg 
    (Edward Williams; 1747&#150;1826)
   in 1792&#151;gave the bardic guild a new dignity and popular appeal as part of the great national festival, not least by virtue of his sonorous voice, impressive stage presence, and the reforms which were brought about in its regalia, ceremonies, and organization during his tenure of office.<br>
<br>Hwfa M&ocirc;n died on 10 November 1905 at his home, Llys Hwfa, at 11 River Street, Rhyl, and was buried in the new cemetery at Rhyl four days later. There were no children from his marriage.<br>
