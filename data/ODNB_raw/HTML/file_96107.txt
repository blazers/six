<span class="headword">King, Lady  Isabella Lettice</span>  (1772&#150;1845), <span class="occ">philanthropist</span>, was born in September 1772 at the family's town house, 15&#150;16 Henrietta Street, Dublin, the third daughter and sixth of the seven children of Edward King, first earl of Kingston (1726&#150;1797), before his elevation to the peerage MP for Boyle and subsequently co. Sligo, and his wife, Jane (1737&#150;1784), illegitimate daughter but heir of Thomas Caulfeild of Donamon Castle, co. Roscommon, and Peggy Jordan. From a protestant (Church of Ireland) family, Isabella was twelve years old when her mother died and although her father has been portrayed by family biographers as an ambitious man who greatly improved the wealth and status of the family by his dogmatic persistence in acquiring an earldom and by securing good marriages for his eldest son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15597/', "Robert King, Viscount Kingsborough")</script>, and his eldest daughter, Jane, Isabella saw only his &#145;high notions of integrity and honour&#146;  (Lady Isabella King to James King, 1813, Flintshire RO, CD/GW/B/1054) and his &#145;generous and disinterested&#146;  (ibid.) disposition.<br>
<br>At Kingston Lodge, the family home on the Rockingham estate near Boyle, co. Roscommon, Isabella's early life is likely to have included a regular social round of balls and visits both to Dublin and to Mitchelstown, the home of her brother Robert, eighteen years her senior, and his wife, Caroline (<i>n&eacute;e</i> FitzGerald). At Mitchelstown it is possible that she met Mary Wollstonecraft, the radical thinker and campaigner for women's educational equality, who was employed by the Kingsboroughs as tutor to their three eldest daughters. She left Kingston Lodge after her father's death in 1797.<br>
<br>By 1803, aged thirty, she was living at 7 Great Bedford Street, Bath, a fashionable area behind the Royal Crescent, and socializing with the &eacute;lite of the city. At an evening party held at her home in January 1805 a discussion arose about what could best be done for the benefit of Bath. This led to her collaboration with leading male philanthropic figures in the city to establish the Bath Society for the Suppression of Vagrants, Street Beggars and Impostors, Relief of Occasional Distress, and Encouragement of Industry. Later renamed the Monmouth Street Society, it began as an innovative experiment to rid the city's streets of vagrants and beggars, a problem that had plagued Bath throughout the eighteenth century. The society also aimed to provide assistance to the needy through discriminate charitable enterprise. Isabella's integral role demonstrated her propensity and desire to address, with others, contemporary social problems in pioneering ways and led to the emergence of similar charities in other cities throughout the country. In 1805 she also established a ladies' committee connected to the society and was the leading figure in the foundation of the House of Protection, a female-led charity established to educate and shelter orphan girls in the city. Acting as both patroness and governess, she participated on a practical and an administrative level.<br>
<br>Isabella's most ambitious and personal project and one that would occupy her thoughts and time for much of the remainder of her life was the Ladies Association. Its inception can be dated back as far as 1813, when in a letter to her sister she wrote of a &#145;plan&#146; still &#145;vague and undefined&#146;  (Lady Isabella King to Lady Jane King, 1813, Doncaster Archives, DD/DC/H7/7/13) that aimed to provide a conventual home for gentlewomen who were, by the death of their parents, left with no fortune or income. These unacknowledged, impoverished women, Isabella believed, were often forced into prostitution in order to survive. As a single woman she was impassioned to act, not just for the benefit of society itself but from a personal desire to &#145;promote the improvement and happiness&#146; of her own sex  (Lady Isabella King to Hon. Miss Wodehouse, 1817, Doncaster Archives, DD/DC/H7/7/15). Both radical and innovative, her idea emanated from reading Sarah Scott's novel <span class="italic">Millenium Hall</span>, which described the establishment of a female community, one of many ideas, both fictional and real, proposed but never realized since the beginning of the seventeenth century. Although Isabella's vision embraced the foundation of institutions throughout England and Ireland, her doubts as to their practicalities and her insecurities surrounding her own ability to organize such an undertaking shaped her decision to form a primary, experimental establishment, which was opened at Bailbrook House near Bath in June 1816.<br>
<br>Isabella's wealth and her single status enabled her to devote her time to this endeavour, and her aristocratic connections provided access to the powerful and influential members of society whom she believed were essential to the success of her project. From the outset the Ladies Association commanded an impressive list of supporters. The society was honoured by the sanction of Queen Charlotte, who visited Isabella at Bailbrook House in 1817. The visiting party was reported to be &#145;highly gratified with their visit to this association of ladies&#146;  (<span class="italic">Bath Chronicle</span>, 3 Dec 1817), which the queen called &#145;a blessed asylum&#146;  (ibid.). Patrons and patronesses of the institution included eight high-ranking noblewomen and four bishops, and a prominent evangelical presence reflected Lady Isabella's own religious views. Hannah More, a regular visitor to Bath, supported the undertaking; guardians of the society included William Wilberforce and Thomas Babington; and in September 1829 the institution was noticed in the evangelical journal the <span class="italic">Christian Observer</span>. Information regarding the establishment was widespread and reached other female philanthropists, including Catherine Cappe and Elizabeth Fry. Nevertheless Isabella faced harsh criticism both nationally and locally. Reacting to the unfamiliar nature of the institution, critics perceived it as anything from a &#145;mere almshouse&#146;  (notes by Lady Isabella King, Doncaster Archives, DD/DC/H7/7/3) to a &#145;transient resting place for young ladies speculating on their advancement in life&#146;  (ibid.), and Isabella stoically bore discourteous treatment from many.<br>
<br>The sale of Bailbrook House in 1821 enforced a move to Cornwallis House in Clifton, Bristol. Although initially the institution flourished there, Isabella felt alienated from her friends and the support network in Bath. By 1833 dwindling numbers of residents saw the society in decline. Isabella attributed its failure to a lack of internal cohesion among residents and a want of support from friends and others of her class. With her health, strength, and spirits failing, and feeling ever more oppressed by the demanding responsibilities of the institution that had almost exclusively occupied her attention for seventeen years, she made the decision to withdraw, but admitted that it was the place in which she had hoped to end her days.<br>
<br>With no successor willing to step forward, Cornwallis House was sold in 1837; consistent with Isabella's wishes the funds were devoted to religious and charitable endeavours in Bristol. But she refused to give up hope that the institution she had called &#145;this child of my own brain&#146;  (Lady Isabella King to Lady Wilton, 1813, Doncaster Archives, DD/DC/H7/7/15) would be re-established. She wrote to the poet Robert Southey, a zealous supporter of hers to whom the idea for the later Anglican sisterhoods has been attributed, imparting the wisdom of her seventeen years' experience in the hope that with this information in his hands some other lady might take up the challenge.<br>
<br>Lady Isabella King's philanthropic endeavours have remained substantially unrecognized. There is no doubt that her strength of character, her belief in her cause, and her preparedness to challenge conventional ideals regarding women's role in the philanthropic arena establish her as an extraordinary woman. At the time it seems that her reputation only extended locally and as far as her friends, who acknowledged her &#145;indefatiguable zeal&#146; and her &#145;devotion of herself to purposes of the most important kind&#146;  (Lady Carysfort to Lady Isabella King, draft, 1816, Doncaster Archives, DD/DC/H7/7/15). The <span class="italic">Bath Guide</span> between 1813 and 1820 proclaimed her &#145;the truly benevolent Lady Isabella King&#146;.<br>
<br>She died a spinster, aged seventy-two, on 20 April 1845 at the Royal Rockferry Hotel, Rockferry, in the parish of Bebbington, near Birkenhead, Cheshire, and was buried five days later at St Peter's Church, Rockferry.<br>
