<span class="headword">Herbert, Sir  Thomas</span>, first baronet  (1606&#150;1682), <span class="occ">traveller and government official</span>, was born in The Pavement, York, and baptized at the parish church of St Crux on 4 November 1606. He was the son and heir of Christopher Herbert (1583&#150;1625) of York and Jane, the daughter of Henry Akroyd of Foggathorpe, East Riding, Yorkshire. His family had settled in York before 1550, making their living as merchants; several Herberts served as aldermen and mayors. Christopher Herbert, in contrast, was a failure and died prematurely leaving his family impoverished, although the young Thomas Herbert possessed a generous bequest from his grandfather. Prior to his father's death he decided to seek a career in the law. He began his studies in 1621 at Trinity College, Cambridge, where his uncle Dr Ambrose Akroyd was a fellow, then migrated to Jesus College, Oxford, to study with another relative, Jenkin Lloyd. From there he proceeded to the inns of court but without leaving an official record of his presence at any of these places.<br>
<br>As a young man seeking to start his career, the young Herbert sought the help of relatives in London. Eventually his father's younger brothers William and James Herbert managed to introduce him to a distant relation, William Herbert, third earl of Pembroke (1580&#150;1630). About 1626 Pembroke secured him a place in Sir Dodmore Cotton's impending diplomatic mission to Shah Abbas of Persia. After several delays Cotton's party finally sailed from England on 23 March 1627. The mission turned out to be a diplomatic disaster. Both of its leaders, Sir Robert Shirley and Cotton, sickened and died during July 1628, while the shah's enthusiasm for Englishmen cooled. Herbert, along with the other survivors, then made the slow return to England, arriving at Gravesend on 12 January 1630. In the course of his travels he visited the notable Persian cities of Gombroon, Shiraz, Esfahan, Ashraf, Qazvin, and Qom as well as other Asian and African locales such as Surat, Mauritius, the Cape of Good Hope, and St Helena. Unfortunately for Herbert, his patron the earl of Pembroke died a few months after his return on 10 April 1630. Disappointed, Herbert made a three-month trip to France but was back at the court by the summer of 1631. There he became friends with Sir Walter Alexander, a gentleman usher to the king. It was a valuable contact and on 16 April 1632, Herbert married Sir Walter's twenty-year-old daughter, Lucy (<i>d</i>. 1671). He also managed to meet and to secure the help of the new earl of Pembroke, Philip Herbert (1584&#150;1650), a well-connected courtier and privy councillor. Pembroke introduced him to Charles I and quickly Herbert was sworn as an esquire of the body, an office which he could only assume if one of the four existing esquires died or resigned. Whether he ever actually served as such is uncertain but this circumstance may help to explain why he later became one of the attendants of the captive Charles I. All of these prestigious connections also allowed Herbert to convince the College of Arms to allow him to resume using the Herbert coat of arms, a right lost by his wastrel father.<br>
<br>During his period of waiting for a position as esquire of the body, Herbert and his new bride lived with her parents in Petty France, Westminster. He used this leisure to good advantage. In 1634 he published the first edition of his book of travels, entitled <span class="italic">A description of the Persian monarchy now beinge: the orientall Indyes Iles and other parts of greater Asia and Africk</span>. The book appeared in an expanded second edition in 1638 under the title <span class="italic">Some Yeares Travels into Divers Parts of Asia and Afrique</span>. Beginning with the first edition Herbert inserted materials into his narrative about places he had not visited although he sometimes implied that he had, and in each succeeding edition the amount of this second-hand material increased significantly. One particularly famous digression appearing in the first edition onward was his speculation about the medieval Welsh Prince Madoc's discovering and colonizing America. This segment was apparently included to please the earl of Pembroke's own Welsh nationalist fancies. It also continued to help fuel various theories about Madoc's colonies and Welsh Indians in North America until the early years of the nineteenth century. <span class="italic">Some Yeares Travels</span> proved sufficiently popular to encourage a Dutch translation in 1658, and a French in 1663. During his years of retirement after the Restoration, Herbert produced expanded third, fourth, and fifth editions in 1665, 1675, and 1677 respectively, and the book continued to be reprinted after his death.<br>
<br>When the English civil war broke out in 1642, Herbert followed his patron, Pembroke, into the parliamentarian camp. He stayed unquestionably loyal to parliament, the Commonwealth, or the protectorate throughout the entire civil war and interregnum. On 26 March 1644 parliament appointed him a commissioner to the earl of Essex's army and later to the New Model Army, where Sir Thomas Fairfax valued his services highly. When Oxford surrendered in May 1646, Herbert served as a commissioner.<br>
<br>The beginning of 1647 saw Herbert begin his service as an attendant to the captive Charles I, an episode that only ended with the execution on 30 January 1649 and the burial of the king. Herbert was one of the few parliamentarians whom Charles I was willing to have wait on him. During those two years Herbert successfully walked the tightrope of keeping both the parliament and the army on the one hand and Charles I on the other satisfied with how he did his job. His loyalty to parliament never came under question in spite of an incident when one of his servants smuggled a forbidden letter in to the king. Nor did the captive monarch find Herbert anything but courteous and even kindly: the two had a private joke about Herbert's needing an alarm clock so that he could rise at the proper time to wake the king; a clock was ordered for Herbert from a London craftsman, but it failed to arrive before Charles's execution. That may have been what prompted the king to make his own pocket watch a farewell gift to Herbert. Apparently Charles also wrote out a testimonial praising Herbert's conduct during this period, although the original has not survived. Modern scholarship, however, suggests that Herbert, ever the loyal parliamentarian, may have distanced himself from the king at his execution and instead let the duties of comforting him fall on Bishop William Juxon. It also appears that Herbert helped himself to other royal possessions.<br>
<br>In the summer of 1649 Herbert began new duties as parliamentary commissioner serving with the army in Ireland. Other offices in Ireland followed, including from December 1653 that of secretary to the governing commission for Ireland, which became in August 1654 the governing council, with Herbert serving as its clerk until 1659. During these years he met his future son-in-law the regicide Colonel Robert Phaire of Cork, who married his daughter Elizabeth on 16 August 1658. Henry Cromwell considered Herbert's services of sufficient merit to reward him with a knighthood in July 1658. He was still living in Dublin at the restoration of Charles II in 1660, but when a general pardon was announced Herbert travelled to London to accept it. On 3 July 1660 Charles II created him a baronet to reward him for his attendance on his father and to compensate him for the loss of his protectorate knighthood.<br>
<br>Herbert lived quietly in Restoration England. When the plague swept London in 1665 he returned to York, where he remained for the rest of his life. His first wife, Lucy, died on 19 December 1671. The couple had had four sons and six daughters but only the eldest son and heir, Henry, second baronet (<i>d</i>. 1687), and three of the daughters, Elizabeth, Lucie, and Anne, survived their father. Within a year of Lucy's death Herbert married, on 11 November 1672, his second wife, Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1696), daughter of Gervase Cutler of Stainbrough, Yorkshire, and niece of the earl of Bridgewater. During these years, besides working on the three expanded editions of <span class="italic">Some Yeares Travels</span>, he engaged in antiquarian scholarship mostly relating to Yorkshire and helped William Dugdale with the research for his <span class="italic">Monasticon Anglicanum</span>. Toward the end of his life former royalists persuaded him to write a narrative of his experiences during Charles I's captivity, which appeared in 1678 as <span class="italic">Threnodia Carolina</span>. After Herbert's death Anthony Wood published an extensive extract of the account in his <span class="italic">Athenae Oxoniensis</span> (1691). Herbert's complete narrative was published in 1702 with other original documents relating to Charles I's captivity as <span class="italic">Memoirs of the last two years of the reign of the unparalleled prince of very blessed memory, King Charles I</span>. It has been republished in whole or in part and in translation many times since. While Herbert's work has been used extensively by people studying the last days of Charles I, modern scholars have questioned its reliability as an accurate record. Throughout his life Herbert showed himself to be hardworking and efficient as well as having a keen eye for self-advancement and survival. He died at Petergate, York, on 1 March 1682 and was buried on 3 March at St Crux. In his will, dated 20 December 1679, he left to his grandson George Herbert &#145;the great silver clock my gracious M<sup>r</sup> King Charles the first gave mee in testimony of his Royall favour&#146;  (Borth. Inst., will). Herbert's widow married on 20 October 1684 Henry Edmunds of Yorkshire, and died in 1696.<br>
