<span class="headword">James V,  mistresses and children of</span>  (<em>act. </em><em>c.</em>1529&#150;1592)<span class="occ"></span> constitute a notable extension of personality on the part of an early modern British ruler. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/14591/', "James V (1512&#150;1542)")</script> had nine known illegitimate children, all born to different mothers. The dates and order of their births are not fully known. Of the two females, <a name="cosubject_77145"></a><span class="headword">Jean Stewart</span>  (<em>c.</em>1530&#150;1588)<span class="occ"></span> was the daughter of Elizabeth Beaton, daughter of Sir John Beaton of Creich, and it was probably she&#151;her maternity given but not her name&#151;who was offered in marriage to Alexander, master of Home, in 1537. In the event she married Archibald Campbell, fifth earl of Argyll (<i>c</i>.1532&#150;1573), in 1554; she was divorced from him in June 1573. Her sister Margaret Stewart is obscure, and the name could even be a clerical error for Jean herself, since she was the subject of the same marriage offer to the Homes five years after the first. While there appears to be a preponderance of sons among James's children, unfortunately there is no record of any unacknowledged daughters.<br>
<br>Of the king's sons, <a name="cosubject_77146"></a><span class="headword">James [i] Stewart</span>  (1529&#150;1557) was the son of Elizabeth Shaw, daughter of the laird of Sauchie, and the first beneficiary of the king's policy, inherited from his own father, James IV, of exploiting to his own advantage his control over major church benefices. On the king's appeal to the pope, James [i] became commendator of the abbeys of Kelso and Melrose. James [ii] Stewart [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26479/', "Stewart, James (1531/&#150;1570)")</script>], son of <a href="#cosubject_73794">Margaret Erskine [<i>see below</i>]</a>, wife of Sir Robert Douglas of Lochleven, likewise became commendator of the priory of St Andrews, and later first earl of Moray and regent. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26490/', "John Stewart (c.1531&#150;1563)")</script>, son of Elizabeth or Katherine Carmichael, daughter of Sir John Carmichael, became commendator of the priory of Coldingham and briefly enjoyed the title Lord Darnley. James [iii] Stewart (<i>fl</i>. 1533), son of Christian Barclay, died in infancy. Robert [i] Stewart [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26504/', "Stewart, Robert (1533&#150;1593)")</script>] was the son of Euphemia Elphinstone (<i>b</i>. 1509, <i>d</i>. after 1564), daughter of Alexander, first Lord Elphinstone, who later married John Bruce of Cultmalindie. Robert [i] became commendator of the abbey of Holyrood, and later earl of Orkney. <a name="cosubject_77147"></a><span class="headword">Robert [ii] Stewart</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1580) became commendator of the priory of Whithorn; he is said in one near-contemporary source to have been a son of the countess of Sutherland, though no bearer of that title was of an appropriate age. <a name="cosubject_77148"></a><span class="headword">Adam Stewart</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1575), son of Helenor or Elizabeth, daughter of John Stewart, twelfth earl of Lennox, became a <span class="occ">monk and pensioner</span> (sometimes erroneously referred to as prior) of the Charterhouse of Perth; his mother subsequently married William Hay, sixth earl of Erroll, and then John Gordon, eleventh earl of Sutherland, and died in 1564.<br>
<br>Whatever the homely reputation of the &#145;guidman of Ballengeich&#146;, James V's known paramours were all drawn from the nobility and lairdly class. Only one, <a name="cosubject_73794"></a><span class="headword">Margaret Erskine</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1572)<span class="occ"></span>, daughter of John Erskine, fifth Lord Erskine (<i>d</i>. 1555), was more than a brief dalliance. She appears in a &#145;flyting&#146; of Sir David Lindsay, in which the king is castigated for his loose morals, as &#145;the lady that luffit yow best&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works of Sir David Lindsay</span>, 1.104), and was the model for Dame Sensualitie in Lindsay's <span class="italic">Satyre of the Thrie Estaitis</span>. In 1536 James appealed to the pope to have her marriage annulled so that he could wed her himself. Had he been successful, then James [ii] could conceivably have been legitimized by the subsequent marriage of his parents and Scottish history would have taken a very different turn. Margaret Erskine was said in later years to have borne ill will against Queen Mary for this reason, though her part in the imprisonment of the queen in her husband's castle of Lochleven in 1567/8 is a matter of dispute. She was a somewhat forbidding companion to the queen during that episode, but is said to have responded to the queen's famous charm.<br>
<br>In their earliest years the children remained at court with their mothers. The four eldest boys&#151;the two surviving Jameses, John, and Robert [i]&#151;then went to school in St Andrews, and James [ii] and John later matriculated at the university. All accompanied the young Queen Mary to France in 1548 and the two university students continued their studies there under the philosopher Pierre Ramus. After returning to Scotland, John, James [ii], and Robert became involved in politics and public affairs and all attended their half-sister during her troubled personal rule. Jean too was a close companion, preferring the court to her husband's domains in the west of Scotland, a fact which put a fatal strain on her marriage. She was present when the queen's secretary David Rizzio was murdered on 9 March 1566.<br>
<br>Neither Jean nor Margaret had children, and all but Robert, earl of Orkney, died comparatively young and produced few descendants. John, Lord Darnley, had one son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/12999/', "Francis Stewart (1562&#150;1612)")</script>, who succeeded him as prior of Coldingham and ultimately became the &#145;madcap&#146; earl of Bothwell. James, earl of Moray, had three daughters, only one of whom had issue, though she was the progenitrix of the continuing Moray line. Adam Stewart died in 1575 in Orkney; his widow is said to have been &#145;gritlie burdynnit with mony bairnis&#146;  (<span class="italic">Registrum secreti sigilli</span>, 1575&#150;80, no. 1003), though there is knowledge only of Barbara, who married into the Orcadian Halcro family and was responsible for her father's tombstone, carved with the royal arms, which may still be seen in St Magnus Cathedral, Kirkwall.<br>
