<span class="headword">Macarthur,  James</span>  (1798&#150;1867), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born on 15 December 1798 at his parents' home, Elizabeth Farm, near Parramatta, New South Wales, the fifth of the seven surviving children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17337/', "John Macarthur (1766&#150;1834)")</script> and his wife, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/52548/', "Elizabeth Macarthur, n&#233;e Veale (1766&#150;1850)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17337/', "Macarthur, John")</script>]. His parents had arrived in the colony in 1790, his father being then an officer in the New South Wales Corps. James and his younger brother, <a href="#cosubject_17339">William [<i>see below</i>]</a>, his life-long companion, were taught at home until 1809, when they went with their father to England. Their education was completed at Dr James Lindsay's school, Grove Hall, Bow, London. Another brother was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17333/', "Edward Macarthur")</script>.<br>
<br>In 1815&#150;16 James and William travelled with their father through France and Switzerland, and in 1817 all three returned to Australia. Thereafter the brothers lived at the family estate, Camden Park, 40 miles south-west of Sydney. A new house was completed there in 1834, and they formed a substantial tenant-farming community, with a village well positioned on the Sydney&#150;Melbourne road. They were energetic and popular landlords, and Camden became the foundation for their wider authority.<br>
<br>During his second visit to England (1828&#150;31), James Macarthur offered to the Colonial Office a paper on crown land policy in New South Wales, a sketchy but significant argument for more ambitious management. His optimistic understanding of the colonial penal system led him always to believe in the ramifying duties of government. At the same time he hoped to refine and strengthen local opinion. In 1831, following his return, he brought together various parties with the hope of influencing imperial land policy, and in 1833 he tried to do the same for constitutional reform. In 1836 he went again to England, where he consulted frequently with the Colonial Office, and where he published his <span class="italic">New South Wales: its Present State and Future Prospects</span> (1837). In London, on 14 June 1838, he married Emily Stone (1806&#150;1880), the daughter of a City banker. Macarthur called himself a liberal conservative, and the liberal aspects of his thinking were due partly to his wife. They had one daughter, Elizabeth, born in 1840 (later Mrs Macarthur-Onslow).<br>
<br>From June 1840 Macarthur was a member of the original legislature of New South Wales, a nominated body. He failed to be chosen for the first partly elected legislative council (1843), but his membership of the two subsequent councils (1849&#150;55) allowed him to achieve numerous ambitions for the colony. Convict transportation had ended in 1840, and he had a central part in several projects for political, social, and economic reform, designed to establish a self-governing community free of the stigma of convictism. He was one of the founders of the University of Sydney (1850) and of the non-sectarian (or national) system of elementary education.<br>
<br>Macarthur's main contribution to Australian public life arose from his inspired interest in political and administrative process. He had a powerful understanding of the idea of public morality, and of the role which a visionary conscience might play in government. His achievements are therefore to be found as much in the minutiae of debate and legislation as in major items of reform.<br>
<br>In 1851&#150;3 council devised a new bicameral constitution (for enactment by the British parliament), with Macarthur once again playing a leading role. He sat in the lower house of the first two colonial parliaments (1856&#150;9) and he was a member, without portfolio, of the short-lived first cabinet under responsible government (April&#150;August 1856). In 1859 he was offered a knighthood, but his complex attitude to honours for Australians led him to decline it.<br>
<br>With his wife and daughter Macarthur was in Europe from 1860 to 1864, and on his return he was given a seat in the nominated upper house (October 1866). However, he died on 21 April 1867, at Camden Park, of heart failure. After a service on 28 April at St John's Church, Camden, he was buried in the family graveyard at Camden Park.<br>
<br>The younger brother of James Macarthur, <a name="cosubject_17339"></a><span class="headword">Sir William Macarthur</span>  (1800&#150;1882), <span class="occ">pastoralist and scientist</span>, was born at Elizabeth Farm, near Parramatta, on 15 December 1800. The main concerns of his life were centred on Camden Park, where his experimental vineyard, orchard, and gardens were a source of plants for others throughout Australia. He made a remarkable collection of indigenous trees and was among the first in Australia to attempt photography. He was an elected member of the legislative council (1849&#150;55) and he sat in the upper house of the colonial parliament (1864&#150;82). He was a commissioner for the colony at the Universal Exhibition in Paris in 1855, and was afterwards awarded a knighthood and the L&eacute;gion d'honneur. He died, unmarried, at Camden Park on 29 October 1882 of embolism of the cerebral artery and, after a service at St John's Church, Camden, was buried in the family graveyard in Camden Park on 31 October 1882.<br>
