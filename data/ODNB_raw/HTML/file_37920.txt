<span class="headword">R&uuml;cker, Sir  Arthur William</span>  (1848&#150;1915), <span class="occ">physicist</span>, was born on 23 October 1848 at 3 Nelson Terrace, Clapham Common, Surrey, the eldest in the family of three sons and three daughters of Daniel Henry R&uuml;cker the younger (1816&#150;1890), merchant of colonial produce, of London, and his wife, Mary Antoinette (1825&#150;1905), eldest daughter of John D. Williams, a merchant of Coolock, co. Dublin. Educated at Clapham grammar school, R&uuml;cker went to Brasenose College, Oxford (1867), with an open mathematical scholarship, taking first-class honours in mathematical moderations and the junior university mathematical scholarship (1869), and first-class honours in mathematics (1870) and natural science (1871).<br>
<br>Awarded an open mathematical fellowship at Brasenose in 1871, R&uuml;cker was appointed mathematical lecturer at Brasenose and demonstrator at the Clarendon Laboratory, but when the Yorkshire College of Science was founded in Leeds in 1874 he moved to become their professor of mathematics and physics, and in 1876 he gave up his fellowship on marrying, on 5 July, Marian (1852&#150;1878), second daughter of John Deakin Heaton, physician, of Claremont, Leeds. She died following the birth of their daughter Olive in 1878. In 1886 R&uuml;cker was appointed professor of physics at the Royal College of Science, London. He subsequently assisted the incorporation of the greater London colleges within London University and, as a result, became the first principal in 1901, holding the position until retirement in 1908.<br>
<br>R&uuml;cker's research topics included thermal expansion of liquids (1876&#150;84); properties of thin liquid films (1877&#150;93), jointly with A. W. Reinold; and electromagnetism (1855&#150;1901). His major contribution was undoubtedly to undertake, jointly with Thomas Thorpe, a series of magnetic surveys of the British Isles (1883&#150;92) which significantly advanced contemporary interpretation methods, and to obtain the first measurements of the magnetic susceptibility of rocks (1890&#150;98).<br>
<br>A good-humoured, patient man of great personal charm, R&uuml;cker was an energetic and skilled administrator and an excellent public speaker. His hobbies included rambling, ornithology, sketching, photography, horticulture, and astronomy, and he acquired a competency in the Welsh language. He stood unsuccessfully as a Liberal Unionist candidate for parliament in the 1885 and 1886 elections in North Leeds and the Pudsey division of Yorkshire.<br>
<br>In recognition of his work on thin films and terrestrial magnetism R&uuml;cker was awarded the royal medal of the Royal Society in 1891 and became president of the permanent committee on terrestrial magnetism and atmospheric electricity of the International Meteorological Conference in 1896. He was awarded the honorary degrees of doctor of science from Oxford, Cambridge, Manchester, Leeds, and Belfast and LLD from Glasgow and Edinburgh; he was knighted in 1902. Elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1884, he was on the council (1887&#150;9, 1894, 1898&#150;9) and secretary (1896&#150;1901). He was also treasurer of the British Association (1891&#150;8) and its president (1901), and president of the Physical Society (1893&#150;5). R&uuml;cker married, on 7 September 1892, Thereza Charlotte Story Maskelyne (1863&#150;1941) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/48425/', "Rucker, Thereza Charlotte")</script>], third daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36328/', "(Mervyn Herbert) Nevil Story-Maskelyne")</script> of Wroughton, Wiltshire, keeper of minerals at the British Museum. They had one son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/49951/', "Sir Arthur Nevil Rucker (1895&#150;1991)")</script>. In retirement R&uuml;cker and his wife concerned themselves with the teaching of home science at King's College for Women. R&uuml;cker died on 1 November 1915 at his home, Everington House, Everington Lane, Yattendon, Berkshire and was buried on 5 November in the church of St Peter and St Paul, Yattendon.<br>
