<span class="headword">Wolseley,  Frances Garnet</span>, Viscountess Wolseley  (1872&#150;1936), <span class="occ">gardener and author</span>, was born on 15 September 1872 at 118 Belgrave Road, Pimlico, London, the only child of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36995/', "Sir Garnet Joseph Wolseley (1833&#150;1913), later Baron Wolseley of Cairo and Viscount Wolseley")</script>, commander-in-chief of the British army, and his wife, Louisa Erskine (1843&#150;1920). She had the peripatetic childhood that befalls a soldier's daughter, with frequently changing homes in comfortable suburban villas, including The Limes, Mortlake, and Aylesford House, Wimbledon, and a consequently erratic private education. For her seventh Christmas she was taken to Cyprus, where her father was <i>en route</i> to the Anglo-Zulu War, while her tenth birthday was celebrated with the news of his victory at Tell al-Kebir&#151;he sent her a visiting card found in Arabi Pasha's tent (having promised her the tip of the rebel's nose). In the spring of 1885 mother and daughter travelled to Cairo to join Lord Wolseley, and returned via Florence, Venice, and Paris.<br>
<br>Frances Wolseley was very much her father's daughter, resembling him in her short stature, smart dress, and brisk manner; she matured early into the role of tactful companion and chaperone to the sociable Lady Wolseley. Although she enjoyed her season as a d&eacute;butante in 1891, privately she preferred a country life with horses and dogs. This became a reality in 1899, when the family settled at Trevor House, at Glynde in Sussex, and she was able to indulge her interest in gardening. Aiming to equip the daughters of middle-class families to earn their own livings, in 1902 she started courses in gardening and design for young women in the walled garden at Trevor House; by 1907 the Glynde College for Lady Gardeners was proving such a success that it had to be moved to a 5 acre teaching garden, with student accommodation, at Ragged Lands, just outside Glynde village. Frances Wolseley's two-year course set the highest standard and enjoyed the patronage of such distinguished gardeners as Gertrude Jekyll, Ellen Willmott, and William Robinson. In November 1909 the college students were featured in <span class="italic">Country Life</span> for their work building and planting the garden of the King Edward VII Sanatorium at Midhurst, which had been designed by Gertrude Jekyll.<br>
<br>While leaving the day-to-day work of the college in the care of graduates Elsa More and Mary Campion, Frances Wolseley pursued a wider campaign with her book <span class="italic">Gardening for Women</span> (1908), which suggested many ways in which women could help with the revival of the countryside economy and rural industries. She toured the country to inspect and publicize thriving enterprises in market gardening, the horticultural colleges at Swanley and Studley, and other institutions running similar courses, and private gardens where women demonstrated responsible management. She also visited South Africa and Canada, showing particular interest in the Canadian women's institutes and their adoption in Britain. She was elected to the Worshipful Company of Gardeners of the City of London in 1913, and became Viscountess Wolseley upon the death of her father the same year.<br>
<br>From 1913 to 1921 Frances Wolseley lived with her mother at Massetts Place, near Lindfield: here she continued her campaign through articles and letters, culminating in her most important book, <span class="italic">Women on the Land</span> (1916), which explained the organization of smallholdings, market co-operatives, women's institutes, and gardening for schools. She also wrote <span class="italic">In a College Garden</span> (1916) to explain exactly the principles and practice of the Glynde College, which prospered until the death of the principal, Elsa More, just after the First World War. In 1919 <span class="italic">Gardens, their Form and Design</span> appeared, a radical analysis of the subject for that time, describing the role of the artist-gardener and setting out much of the theory for what was to be the new profession of landscape architecture a decade before the foundation of the Institute of Landscape Architects. After the death of her mother in 1920 Lady Wolseley moved to Culpepers, Ardingly, Sussex, and devoted her last years to local history research; she published <span class="italic">Some of the Smaller Manor Houses of Sussex</span> in 1925. She died on 24 December 1936 at Culpepers and was buried at St Andrew's, Beddingham. In her will she left her collections of books and papers to Hove corporation, together with funds for the improvement of the library and the establishment of a Wolseley room; Hove Library special collections retain this material, as well as additional material relating to the life of her father.<br>
