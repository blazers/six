<span class="headword">Walford,  Cornelius</span>  (1827&#150;1885), <span class="occ">writer on insurance</span>, was born at 79 Curtain Road, Shoreditch, London, on 2 April 1827, the eldest of five sons of the naturalist Cornelius Walford (<i>d</i>. 1883) of Park House Farm, near Coggeshall, Essex, and Mary Amelia Osborn, of Pentonville, London. He was educated at Felsted School, Essex. After working as a solicitor's clerk at Witham, Essex, and then as a local journalist, Walford qualified as a barrister in 1860 at the Middle Temple, but found his m&eacute;tier as an insurance inspector and agent, initially at Witham. He became a director of the East London Bank in 1862, and also undertook the management of the ailing Unity Fire and Life Association. Four years later he was elected to the board of the Accident Insurance Company, and remained a director until his death. Walford made the first of many visits to the USA in 1861, and this led to a number of North American connections: he founded the Colonial Assurance Corporation in 1867, and from 1870 managed the European business of the New York Insurance Company.<br>
<br>By that time Walford was established as an authoritative writer on insurance and actuarial affairs. He published anonymously in 1857 his <span class="italic">Insurance Guide and Handbook</span>, and this was widely pirated in the USA; it had large sales, and the second edition carried his name. His <span class="italic">Insurance Year Book</span> appeared in 1870, but his great work was the <span class="italic">Insurance Cyclopaedia</span>, six volumes of which appeared between 1871 and 1880. In addition to giving a definitive account of Victorian professional practice, Walford discussed the pioneers of the insurance industry. He also wrote the majority of the articles in the <span class="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</span> about actuaries and insurance men. An active historian, he also published studies of guilds (1879), the Hanseatic League (1881), fairs, plagues, and the effects of famine.<br>
<br>Walford was an associate and then a fellow of the Institute of Actuaries, and was on the council of the Statistical Society. A lifelong interest in shorthand led in 1881 to his becoming president of the newly founded Shorthand Society. In December 1884 he was awarded the Samuel Brown prize of the Institute of Actuaries for his paper on the history of life insurance. Married three times, Walford was the father of three sons and six daughters. He died at his house at 86 Belsize Park Gardens, London, on 28 September 1885 and was buried on 3 October in Brookwood cemetery, Woking; he was survived by his third wife, Laura Walford.<br>
