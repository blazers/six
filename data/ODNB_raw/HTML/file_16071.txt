<span class="headword">Larking,  Lambert Blackwell</span>  (1797&#150;1868), <span class="occ">antiquary</span>, was born at his father's house, Clare House, East Malling, Kent, on 2 February 1797, the eldest son of John Larking, sheriff of Kent in 1808, and Dorothy, daughter of Sir Charles Style, bt, of Wateringbury Place. He was educated at Eton College and at Brasenose College, Oxford, where he graduated BA in 1820, proceeding MA in 1823. While at Oxford he founded the university lodge of freemasons, Lodge Apollo, in 1819. In 1820, after making a grand tour of Europe with a Mr Lowther, Larking was ordained deacon and licensed to the curacy of East Peckham, near Tonbridge, Kent; he became vicar of Ryarsh, near Maidstone, in 1830, and of Burham, near Rochester, in 1837. He was also chaplain to Viscountess Falmouth, of Mereworth Castle. He married, on 20 July 1831, Frances (<i>d</i>. 1873), eldest daughter of Sir William Jervis Twysden (<i>d</i>. 1834), bt, of Roydon Hall, East Peckham, and his wife, Frances Lynch; the couple had no children. He remained vicar of Ryarsh and Burham until his death.<br>
<br>For many years Larking collaborated with the Revd Thomas Streatfeild (1777&#150;1848) of Chart's Edge, Westerham, in the collection and compilation of materials for a new history of the county of Kent. When Streatfeild died in 1848 the materials were left in Larking's hands; he felt that it would be possible to do no more than revise and update the <span class="italic">History and Topographical Survey</span> of the county which had been published by Edward Hasted at the end of the eighteenth century. But although he continued to collect material for the project up until the time of his death, ill health compelled Larking to do little more than devote himself to his clerical duties, and it was not until nearly twenty years after his death that his brother John Wingfield Larking was able to arrange for the publication of part of the work under the editorship of Dr Henry H. Drake. <span class="italic">Hasted's History of Kent: Corrected, Enlarged, and Continued to the Present Time</span>, part 1, <span class="italic">The Hundred of Blackheath</span>, appeared in a folio edition in 1886. It was the only part ever published.<br>
<br>A further project very dear to Larking, an edition of <span class="italic">The Domesday Book of Kent</span>, in facsimile, with transcription, translation, notes, and appendix by him, was completed shortly before his death, when it was in process of being printed. The handsome folio edition which he had planned appeared in 1869.<br>
<br>Larking was a founder member of the Kent Archaeological Society in 1857, and was its honorary secretary until 1860, when he was elected a vice-president, and he contributed many articles to <span class="italic">Archaeologia Cantiana</span>, the society's transactions. For the Camden Society, of which he was a member of the council for many years, Larking edited three volumes of records, in 1849, 1857, and 1861; the second of these, <span class="italic">The Knights Hospitallers in England &hellip; 1338</span>, was taken from a document shown to him in the public library of Valletta when ill health caused him to pass the winter of 1838&#150;9 in Malta. Larking died on 2 August 1868 at Ryarsh vicarage.<br>
