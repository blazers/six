<span class="headword">Granger,  Stewart</span> <span class="st"> [<em>real name </em>James Lablache Stewart]</span>  (1913&#150;1993), <span class="occ">actor</span>, was born on 6 May 1913 in Old Brompton Road, London, the second of the two children of Major James Stewart (1861&#150;1938), of the Royal Engineers, and his wife, Frederica, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Lablache. His mother hoped that he would emulate her great-grandfather, the celebrated basso profondo Luigi Lablache, but a distinct lack of operatic ability resulted in his enrolment as a pre-medical student at Epsom College. At sixteen, however, a family financial crisis forced him to join the Bell Punch Company. In 1933 he accepted Michael Wilding's invitation to become a film extra in <span class="italic">A Southern Maid</span>. After training at the Webber-Douglas Theatre School he made his stage d&eacute;but in Hull in <span class="italic">The Cardinal</span> (1935). On leaving Birmingham repertory he changed his name (adopting his grandmother's maiden name to avoid confusion with the American film star, James Stewart), and he garnered acclaim in the Old Vic's <span class="italic">Serena Blandish</span> (1939). His full screen d&eacute;but followed in <span class="italic">So this is London</span> (1939). Meanwhile, on 10 September 1938, he married his regular co-star Jean Elspeth Mackenzie (<i>b</i>. 1912), whose stage name was Elspeth March; they had two children, Jamie (<i>b</i>. 1944) and Lindsay (<i>b</i>. 1946).<br>
<br>In 1940 Granger enlisted in the Gordon Highlanders, transferring to the 6th battalion of the Black Watch after securing a commission as a second lieutenant. However, he was invalided out of the war with a stomach ulcer in 1942, shortly before his unit was wiped out in north Africa. Resuming his acting career he was cast as the Marquis of Rohan in Gainsborough Pictures' <span class="italic">The Man in Grey</span> (1943); however, he swapped roles with James Mason and gained matin&eacute;e idol status with his performance as Peter Rokeby. Signing a seven-year contract, he scored in <span class="italic">Love Story</span> (1944) as a near-blind pilot, and as a spiv in <span class="italic">Waterloo Road</span> (1945). But the public preferred him in costume and, either side of proving himself a man of action as Apollodorus in <span class="italic">Caesar and Cleopatra</span> (1945), he headlined a string of Gainsborough costume dramas, including <span class="italic">Fanny by Gaslight</span>, <span class="italic">Madonna of the Seven Moons</span> (both 1944), and <span class="italic">Saraband for Dead Lovers</span> (1948). Not all of his films met with critical approval, however; his impersonation of the violinist Paganini in <span class="italic">The Magic Bow</span> (1946) prompted the <span class="italic">Daily Graphic</span> to opine that &#145;he appears to be sawing wood with one hand and milking a cow with the other&#146;  (Parrish and Starke, 366).<br>
<br>Granger divorced in 1948 and began courting <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/103243/', "Jean Merilyn Simmons (1929&#150;2010)")</script>, his co-star in the comedy <span class="italic">Adam and Evelyne</span> (1949). With Granger signed to MGM on a seven-year deal, following his success in <span class="italic">King Solomon's Mines</span> (1950), the couple married in Tucson, Arizona, on 20 December 1950, with the help of Howard Hughes. However, they were compelled to sue the eccentric tycoon after he bought Simmons's contract against her wishes and, much to Hollywood's astonishment, they won an out-of-court settlement for $250,000, plus $35,000 costs. Unfortunately, the victory only reinforced Granger's burgeoning reputation as a &#145;difficult&#146; actor. His refusal to play the media gossip game and his brusque on-set manner led one colleague to compare him to John Barrymore without the booze. Handsome, tall, and athletic, Granger acknowledged his ego, but he was also a hard-working perfectionist, frequently suffering injury while performing his own stunts. After his acrimonious parting from <span class="italic">A Star is Born</span>, director George Cukor dismissed him as &#145;just a movie star&#146;  (Parrish and Starke, 389). Yet he was offered (and refused) the leads in <span class="italic">Quo vadis?</span> (1951), <span class="italic">From Here to Eternity</span> (1953), and <span class="italic">Ben Hur</span> (1959). Instead, he chose to carry on swashbuckling in the tradition of Douglas Fairbanks and Errol Flynn. He set the record for the longest screen fencing bout with Mel Ferrer in <span class="italic">Scaramouche</span> (1952), their seven-minute duel requiring eighty-seven separate sword counts and twenty-eight stunts. Next he fought himself as he played both Rassendyll and Rudolf V in <span class="italic">The Prisoner of Zenda</span> (1952), remaining at court for <span class="italic">Young Bess</span> (1953), opposite Simmons, and <span class="italic">Beau Brummell</span> (1954). But, following <span class="italic">Moonfleet</span> (1955), his fortunes began to wane and only <span class="italic">The Last Hunt</span> (1956), <span class="italic">Bhowani Junction</span> (1956), and <span class="italic">North to Alaska</span> (1960) were positively received. Interviewed in 1968, he confessed:<blockquote>I've seldom, if ever, made a film I have really liked or been proud of &hellip; To spend a life making even reasonable films is bad enough, but to spend one, as I have, making terrible ones tends to be a little dispiriting. (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 18 August 1993)</blockquote>Granger's private life was also in turmoil. Although he and Simmons had become naturalized Americans in 1956 and had settled on a ranch in Arizona with their daughter, Tracy (<i>b</i>. 1956), their constant separations led to Simmons's filing for divorce on the grounds of &#145;outrageous cruelty&#146; in 1960. Subsisting on Italian epics such as <span class="italic">The Swordsman of Siena</span> (1961) and <span class="italic">Sodom and Gomorrah</span> (1962) and a trilogy of Karl May sauerkraut Westerns, Granger married the former Miss Belgium, Viviane Lecerf, on 12 June 1964, only to divorce within a year of the birth of their daughter, Samantha (<i>b</i>. 1968). In 1967 he renounced his American citizenship, although he later returned to America for the television series <span class="italic">The Men from Shiloh</span> (1970&#150;71) and to play Sherlock Holmes in a television adaptation of <span class="italic">The Hound of the Baskervilles</span> (1972). He ended a decade-long movie hiatus with <span class="italic">The Wild Geese</span> in 1978, but following the removal of part of his lung in 1981 he worked only occasionally, notably as the duke of Edinburgh in the television-movie <span class="italic">The Royal Romance of Charles and Diana</span> (1982), and on stage in <span class="italic">The Circle</span> (1990). He died of cancer on 16 August 1993 in Santa Monica, California.<br>
