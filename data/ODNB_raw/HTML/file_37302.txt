<span class="headword">Collier,  Jane</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1715, <em>d.</em> 1755), <span class="occ">novelist</span>, was born at Steeple Langford, near Salisbury, and baptized there on 16 January 1715, one of four children of the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5913/', "Revd Arthur Collier (1680&#150;1732)")</script> and Margaret (<i>d</i>. 1749), daughter of Nicholas Johnson and niece of Sir Stephen Fox. Her father was rector of Langford Magna, Wiltshire, from 1704, a friend of Bishop Gilbert Burnet, and a theological controversialist. In 1716 money troubles (which Benson blames on his wife) made the family move to lodgings in Salisbury. Jane and her sister, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/74079/', "Margaret Collier (1719&#150;1794?)")</script>, learned Greek and Latin from their father. He died in 1732 &#145;in embarrassed circumstances&#146;; their brother Charles became a soldier, their brother Arthur a lawyer who caused their family friend Henry Fielding to be gaoled in 1746 after standing surety for a sum of &pound;400. Their lives were shaped by poverty and literary friendships. In 1748 Jane had left Salisbury and was living with her mother and brother Arthur in lodgings in London, in Doctors' Commons. Her sister had been living with Samuel Richardson's family in 1750, and by late 1751 she was living in Beauford Buildings with Sarah Fielding (whose example as a published author she must have found an encouragement).<br>
<br>Jane Collier has been undervalued as a writer. On 4 October 1748 she wrote to Richardson to argue against his proposed alterations to Sarah Fielding's <span class="italic">The Governess, or, Little Female Academy</span>. The reasons she advances for maintaining the book's integrity are based on modesty of intention: it is better not to divulge the precise methods of punishment used by its Mrs Teachum, since anything said might antagonize readers of one persuasion or another. Richardson duly published it (1749) in its original form. Whereas her critique of his <span class="italic">Clarissa</span>, written for the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span>, never appeared there, Sarah Fielding's reached print, anonymously, in 1749.<br>
<br>Jane Collier's first known appearance in print is <span class="italic">An Essay on the Art of Ingeniously Tormenting</span> (1753). The daughter of Collier's old Salisbury friend James Harris later claimed that &#145;great part&#146; of it was written by him, but she offered no evidence. Its frontispiece shows a cat and mouse with the motto &#145;Celebrare Domestica Facta&#146;. Quoted by Samuel Johnson in volume two of his <span class="italic">Dictionary</span> (in spirit, if not literally, this was one of his few infringements on his principle of excluding living authors), it is couched in the Scriblerian tradition of ironic instruction in undesirable skills, like Pope on poetic bathos, Swift on malpractices of servants, or Henry Fielding on the writing of inspirational biography. Under this guise it probes the &#145;labyrinths and inward turns of the mind&#146; in abuse of power in human relationships, especially that of mistress to servants or &#145;humble companion&#146;, with acute psychological insight no doubt won while living as a dependant. Its closing fable relates how an account of &#145;the misery that is endured, from the entrance of teeth and claws into living flesh&#146; was adjudged after much debate to have been written from experience not of preying but of being preyed upon. A reprint of 1804, edited by &#145;J. S. C.&#146;, signs its dedication &#145;The Invisible Girl&#146;; it notes that Jane Collier's brother Arthur regretted that his sister's abilities should be known only from &#145;a satirical work&#146;. Jane Collier, however, in ironically claiming kinship with Addison, Swift, Richardson, and (Henry) Fielding, does so as moralist, not satirist.<br>
<br>Collier produced a second work, <span class="italic">The Cry: a New Dramatic Fable</span> (1754), jointly with Sarah Fielding, who was apparently thought by Richardson and other readers to be sole or chief author. Collier's commonplace book (or writer's working notebook), carefully transcribed and edited in manuscript by her sister Margaret, includes her allegorical &#145;Sallys and Jennys Emblem (1754) concerning The Cry&#146;. This pictures two women co-operating in making a patchwork gown: Jenny shops for silks, Sally weaves, Jenny cuts in pieces and stitches up to Sally's design. <span class="italic">The Cry</span> is both experimental and learned, aiming &#145;to strike a little out of the beaten track of novels and essays&#146;, with scenes and dialogue borrowed from the drama, an allegorical framework explicitly borrowed from Edmund Spenser, scholarly footnotes, and invented words like &#145;turba&#146; for a legion of evil passions, &#145;trouble, bustle and confusion&#146;  (1.194&#150;5). Una personifies Truth; the &#145;Cry&#146; is the name of &#145;<span class="smallcap">ERROR</span> and her <span class="smallcap">NUMEROUS TRAIN</span> &hellip; when cloathed in mortal forms&#146;  (1.20). The central story, of good characters attaining happiness against odds, is unremarkable; the picture of societal forces constricting women's lives (Portia compelled constantly to defend her behaviour to the Cry) recalls that drawn in Sarah Fielding's work. The inventive, non-narrative means of composing this picture was disliked by, for instance, Elizabeth Carter, Lady Mary Wortley Montagu, and the <span class="italic">Monthly Review</span>; but it seems to bear Collier's distinctive mark, a natural development from the <span class="italic">Art of Tormenting</span>. Jane Collier died in 1755, unmarried, and was buried at St Benet's Church, London, on 28 March 1755.<br>
