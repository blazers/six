<span class="headword">Holywood <span class="st"> [&agrave; Sacro Bosco]</span>,  Christopher</span>  (1559?&#150;1626), <span class="occ">Jesuit</span>, was probably born in 1559 at Artane, near Dublin, the son of Nicholas Holywood, a landowner in counties Dublin, Meath, and Wexford, and his wife, Elizabeth Plunkett, granddaughter and heir-general of Robert Plunkett, fifth Baron Dunsany. He studied at the University of Padua and in 1584 became a member of the Society of Jesus at Verdun, entering the noviciate at D&ocirc;le in France. He was ordained at Pont-&agrave;-Mousson in 1593, and over the next few years taught theology there and at D&ocirc;le, and philosophy and scripture in Italy, at Ferrara and Padua, where he met the influential Cardinal Bellarmine. On 26 September 1598 he was appointed to the mission of the Jesuits in Ireland. Disguised as a merchant he sailed for England, but was arrested on landing at Dover. He declined to take the oath of supremacy, was examined before Robert Cecil, the secretary of state, and was detained in custody at the Gatehouse, London. From February 1600 he was detained at Wisbech, where he occupied himself with literary work and theological disputation. After the death of Elizabeth I he was transferred to Framlingham in Suffolk and then banished to the continent.<br>
<br>Holywood spent time in the Spanish Netherlands and northern France in 1603&#150;4 and arranged for the publication of two works of theology, which appeared under the name &agrave; Sacro Bosco, a Latin form of his name in traditional use in his family. His <span class="italic">Defensio decreti Tridentini et sententiae Roberti Bellarmini, S. R. E. cardinalis, de authoritate Vulgatae editionis Latinae, adversus sectarios, maxime Whitakerum</span> (1604), re-issued with additions in 1619, was a defence of Bellarmine's views on the <span class="roman">Vulgate</span> in reply to William Whitaker and other protestant controversialists. He also wrote <span class="italic">De investiganda vera ac visibili Christi ecclesia libellus</span> (1604) and the unpublished treatise &#145;Opusculum de virtutibus&#146; (1619). There is some evidence that he was the author of a work of natural philosophy entitled <span class="italic">De meteoris tractatus lucidissimus in quinque partes distinctus</span>, apparently also an early work, but revised in 1612 and published in Paris in 1613 under the pseudonym Johannes Geraldinus.<br>
<br>In Ireland from March 1604 until his death, Holywood acted as superior of the Jesuit mission. He spent his time in Dublin and the surrounding areas actively promoting the Jesuit mission and normally lived with relatives, including his cousin Sir Christopher Plunkett in Dublin, and members of the Holywood family in co. Meath. Wise reported that Holywood was &#145;generally in and about the court of Dublin&#146;  (Hogan, <span class="italic">Distinguished Irishmen</span>, 459) and was no stranger to political controversy, though he insisted the society focus on its spiritual mission. Though he spent time in co. Meath to avoid persecution in Dublin and Drogheda he regarded it as a &#145;remote&#146; place and was reported to have rarely travelled beyond the pale because he spoke little Irish and did not enjoy good health. As provincial he corresponded regularly with fellow Jesuits, usually signing his name as John Bushlock before 1618, and after that date regularly using the alias Thomas Lawndrie (Lawndaeus); elsewhere his name was recorded by contemporaries as Holividus or Holivodius. During his time as superior the Jesuit presence in Ireland grew considerably, both numerically, with more than forty Jesuits in the country, and geographically, with the establishment of a network of residences and an Irish mission to the western isles of Scotland. He died in Ireland on 4 September 1626.<br>
