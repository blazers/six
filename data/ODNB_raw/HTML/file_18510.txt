<span class="headword">Meen,  Henry</span>  (1744&#150;1817), <span class="occ">classical scholar and Church of England clergyman</span>, was born on 2 December 1744 at Harleston, Norfolk, the son of Henry Meen, a local apothecary. He was educated at Mr Colling's school, Bungay, and entered Emmanuel College, Cambridge, on 9 October 1761. He graduated BA (1766), MA (1769), BD (1776), and became a fellow of the college. As an undergraduate he published <span class="italic">Happiness, a Poetical Essay</span> (1766), which brought him little when reread as an adult. Having been ordained into the Anglican church, on 30 April 1792 he was appointed to a minor canonry in St Paul's Cathedral, instituted to the rectory of St Nicholas Cole Abbey, with St Nicholas Olave, London. On 13 November 1795 he was collated as prebendary of Twyford in St Paul's Cathedral, where he also held the office of lecturer. He obtained no other preferment, and these posts left him ample time for literary pursuits.<br>
<br>In 1780 Meen &#145;revised, corrected, and completed, as coadjutor and editor&#146;, the unfinished translation of Apollonius Rhodius, by the Revd Francis Fawkes, and superintended its publication for his widow's benefit. To it he annexed his own independent version of Coluthus's <span class="italic">Rape of Helen, or, The Origin of the Trojan War</span>. His other works were <span class="italic">A Sermon before the Association of Volunteers</span> (1782), <span class="italic">Remarks on the Cassandra of Lycophron</span> (1800) and <span class="italic">Succisivae operae, or, Selections from Ancient Writers, with Translations and Notes</span> (1815). The biblical scholar Gilbert Wakefield believed that Meen had studied the writings of Lycophron more than any man living. When Meen told Samuel Parr that he proposed to undertake an edition of Lycophron's works, Parr encouraged him with the remark that &#145;many books have been well edited by men who were no scholars&#146;. Meen's criticisms on Lycophron appeared in the <span class="italic">European Magazine</span> from 1796 to 1813, but his complete translation was never published. Meen's additional literary activities included proof-reading Bishop Percy's &#145;Blank verse before Milton&#146; (a work which was destroyed in the fire at the printing office); their correspondence is reprinted in John Nichols's <span class="italic">Illustrations of &hellip; Literary History</span>  (1817&#150;58, 7.38&#150;68). He was also employed to collect and pass through the press <span class="italic">Alonzo and Cora</span> (1801) by the Edinburgh poet Elizabeth Scot. The literary commentator George Steevens dubbed Meen &#145;Little Meen&#146; on account of his confused and haphazard working practices, with the result that he was &#145;always employed without doing anything&#146;. Gilbert Wakefield more charitably described him as &#145;pacific, gentle, unassuming&#146;. Henry Meen died, unmarried, aged seventy-two, at the rectory, Bread Street Hill, London, on 3 January 1817. Several months later (17&#150;21 March) his manuscript translation of Lycophron and other books were sold at Sothebys.<br>
