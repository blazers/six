<span class="headword">Steward, Sir  Simeon</span>  (1579/80?&#150;1629?), <span class="occ">poet</span>, was the surviving son of Mark Steward (<i>c</i>.1525&#150;1604) of Stuntney, Cambridgeshire, and his wife, Anne, daughter of the royal physician Robert Huicke. His father married late in life, in or after 1575, and was knighted at Whitehall, with his son, by King James on 23 July 1603. Sir Simeon proved his father's will and erected an elaborate monument to him in Ely Cathedral, whose inscription fancifully traces the family's Scottish origins.<br>
<br>Steward was probably admitted to Gray's Inn on 29 January 1593, and on 13 April 1597 he married Grace (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1579), daughter of Edward St Barbe of Ashington, Somerset, at St Olave, Hart Street, London, &#145;in the la: walsinghames house&#146;. Their son Robert was born <i>c</i>.1599. According to Fuller, Steward lived at Trinity Hall, Cambridge, as a fellow-commoner following his knighthood, but the coat of arms displayed in his chamber, recorded as extant in 1730, had been lost without trace by 1886.<br>
<br>Steward's political career was controversial. Elected MP for Shaftesbury, Dorset, in 1614, he was the subject (with his second cousin Sir Thomas) of a quarrelsome petition in November 1619. With Edward Peyton he was returned for Cambridgeshire in January 1624, but the election was declared void upon petition, Steward having persuaded the under sheriff to ignore the vociferous support for their rival, John Cuts, who then replaced Steward as MP.<br>
<br>Steward had meanwhile befriended at Cambridge the poets Robert Herrick and Mildmay Fane, the former addressing from London, in January 1624, &#145;<i>A new-yeares gift sent to Sir</i> Simeon Steward&#146;, published in <span class="italic">Hesperides</span> (1648), which playfully contrasts rural &#145;Christmas sports&#146; with city gossip. Inspired by Shakespeare's <span class="italic">A Midsummer Night's Dream</span>, Herrick and Steward helped initiate a brief vogue for miniaturist fairy poetry to which belong&#151;though precise chronology is vexed&#151;Michael Drayton's <span class="italic">Nymphidia</span> (1627) and parts of William Browne's <span class="italic">Britannia's Pastorals</span>. Steward's contribution, &#145;A description of the king of fayries clothes, brought to him on new-yeares day in the morning, 1626&#146;, was subsequently published in <span class="italic">A Description of the King and Queene of Fayries, their Habit, Fare, their Abode, Pompe, and State</span>, a small collection compiled by &#145;R. S.&#146; (1634; 2nd edn 1635). Steward's poem (variously titled in its many fuller manuscript texts) wittily evokes cavalier fashion; was anthologized in <span class="italic">Musarum deliciae</span> (1655) and <span class="italic">The English Parnassus</span> (1657); and appears, truncated, alongside a Latin translation in Archibald Pitcairne's pseudonymous <span class="italic"><i>Mormonostolismos</i>, sive, Lamiarum vestitus: a Poem on the King and Queen of Fairy</span> (1691). The 1634&#150;5 volumes include the anonymous &#145;Melancholly Lovers Song&#146; (which influenced Milton's <span class="italic">Il Penseroso</span>); and a version of Herrick's &#145;Oberon's Feast&#146;, leading some to reassign Steward's poem to Herrick himself, indeed to question whether Steward &#145;actually wrote poetry&#146;  (Farmer, 76). The discovery of Fane's manuscript epitaph on Steward (&#145;He who such strong lines wont compose&#146;) effectively countered this claim  (Cain, 316).<br>
<br>Steward was returned as MP for Aldeburgh, Suffolk, in 1627, and died <i>c</i>.1631 (according to the 1684 Cambridgeshire visitation), probably (if a note in Fane's manuscript applies to him) in 1629, aged forty-nine.<br>
