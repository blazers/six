<span class="headword">Manley,  John</span>  (<em>c.</em>1622&#150;1699), <span class="occ">parliamentarian army officer and rebel</span>, came from a minor gentry family seated at Brynyffynnon, Wrexham, Denbighshire. He was the third son of Cornelius Manley, who died in 1623 while John was an infant. John's inheritance was a mere &pound;30, and like so many younger sons of gentry he was put into trade, being apprenticed to a London skinner in 1639. Although both his brothers were royalists in the civil war, Manley enlisted in the parliamentarian army and rose to the rank of captain, possibly helped by his radical religious beliefs. As a Baptist Manley rejected infant baptism, but he went further, denying any legitimacy at all to the Anglican clergy and claiming that continuing divine inspiration made him the equal of any of the apostles. He was also interested in millenarianism and corresponded with the Fifth Monarchist preacher and conspirator Walter Thimbleton, who like Manley came from Wrexham.<br>
<br>Manley's career was further assisted by his marriage in 1650 to Margaret Dorislaus (<i>d</i>. 1675), daughter of the distinguished republican apologist and diplomat <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7832/', "Isaac Dorislaus")</script> (assassinated by royalists in 1649), with whom he had two sons and two daughters. Parliamentary respect for his dead father-in-law, together with the &pound;500 it had voted to each of Dorislaus's daughters, no doubt helped him to buy the office of postmaster-general in 1653, for the sum of exactly &pound;8259 19<i>s</i>. 11&frac34;<i>d</i>.&#151;&#145;with good securities&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1652&#150;3</i>, 450). Responsible for the safe delivery of the post both at home and abroad, at fixed rates, Manley was harassed by law suits from previous holders of the office, and claimed that the costs of developing the service gave him little profit in the two years he held the position. Surveillance of the post was of crucial importance to the regime's security, as Manley's instructions to his postmasters in December 1653 made clear. Apart from their collecting and delivering duties they were to watch strangers and travellers closely, be alert for disaffection and plotting, and to open no letters without Manley's express permission. Security considerations explain why Manley had to sell the office to John Thurloe, the powerful secretary to the council of state, in 1655. During this period Manley made two trips abroad, in 1652 and 1655, possibly to the Netherlands in connection with his father-in-law's affairs.<br>
<br>Manley retired to Denbighshire after 1655 but remained loyal to the republican regime, serving as a local commissioner for the assessment in 1657, captain of militia, justice of the peace, and MP for Denbigh in 1659. He helped suppress a royalist insurrection in August 1659 by arresting the Denbighshire high sheriff, and he opposed the Restoration. He kept to his dissenting religious views, too, his house in Wrexham being raided in 1663 and 1665 as an illegal conventicle. On the latter occasion his quick wits enabled many of the 100 persons present to escape, while he argued with the militia officers through an open window over their lack of a search warrant. After the Restoration he returned to London and took up brewing, though he kept his lease of Brynyffynnon. He lost his premises in the fire of London, but in the 1670s was sufficiently prosperous to become a master in his company, the Skinners. His wife, Margaret, died in 1675, and he remarried some time after, having at least one son by his second wife, Mary (<i>d</i>. 1701).<br>
<br>Manley may have considered emigrating to America, having acquired 370 acres in Carolina in 1678, but the grant brought him into contact with the earl of Shaftesbury just as the Popish Plot and exclusion crisis commenced, and Manley re-entered radical politics. He helped promote London's &#145;monster petition&#146; to the king (for the elected parliament to meet) in 1679&#150;80 and became one of Shaftesbury's agents, being sent by the earl in 1681 to organize disaffected seamen at Wapping to take arms if the king should die. Though on the fringe of the confused plotting which led to the Rye House conspiracy, Manley was never sufficiently prominent to be arrested. His business affairs suffered, however, and by the spring of 1684 he was bankrupt. Early in that year he was still associating with John Wildman and other conspirators in London, but by May he had fled to the Netherlands.<br>
<br>Manley joined the duke of Monmouth's ill-fated expedition in 1685, his presence being very welcome as one of the few participants with any military experience. Monmouth promoted him to major, a rank Manley insisted on for the rest of his life. Though over sixty years old Manley was active in the fighting. Shortly after the landing at Lyme Regis he swept militia troops out of nearby Bridport with a much inferior force of a mere dozen horse, contributing to the dominance which the rebels early established over the militias of the south-west. Ten days into the rebellion, while the rebels were at Shepton Mallett, they were joined by Manley's son Isaac bearing a message from John Wildman that there were good prospects of a rising in Cheshire, and asking what could he and the duke's other London friends do. Monmouth had counted on simultaneous risings elsewhere in England to stretch royal forces, and &#145;young Manley&#146; was sent back with a sharp message for the Londoners to act at once. A week later, just before the battle of Sedgemoor, Manley himself was sent to London to try to stir Wildman and his friends into action. He thus missed the climax of the rebellion, and though an arrest warrant was issued for him he evaded capture and escaped to the Netherlands.<br>
<br>There Manley joined up with other survivors. He was noted as one of the &#145;godly&#146; faction among them; took an active part in an attempt to establish a woollen factory at Groningen to provide employment for the exiles; threatened to kill an exile suspected of informing for the English government; and was hopeful of another rebellion if James II tried to resume church lands sold at the Reformation. He sought no pardon, and he and his son Isaac were both excepted from James II's general pardons of 1686 and 1688. He was one of three egregious rebel exiles whom William of Orange in December 1685 asked the Amsterdam authorities to arrest, in response to pressure from James II. Manley nevertheless embarked with William in 1688 and did good work, raising support for the prince in the west. He represented Bridport (Dorset) in the Convention Parliament of 1689, where he was very active, sitting on fifty-one committees and participating in the drafting of several important measures, including the oath of allegiance, the <span class="roman">Bill of Rights</span>, and the <span class="roman">Mutiny Bill</span>. He took part in the discussions concerning religious toleration, and was lobbied by George Fox and the Quakers.<br>
<br>From about 1690, however, Manley fell into oblivion in public matters, being defeated at Bridport in parliamentary elections in 1690 and 1695. He was one of the very few English rebels and exiles whom William III did not quickly favour with some office, however minor. This may have been because his views were too republican for William, or it may simply have been the effect of advancing age and poor circumstances. Described in 1684 as a &#145;broken brewer&#146;  (Greaves &amp; Zaller, <span class="italic">BDBR</span>, 2.212), he had probably lost more money in the Groningen cloth venture, and in March 1696 he petitioned for a position in the customs, pleading his great loss of estate caused by sufferings in the public service. He obtained no relief, and by 1698 he was sick with the palsy and in prison for debt, with his son Isaac petitioning for an increase in his own salary in order to support his father. This finally produced a pension of &pound;200 per annum, but Manley lived to receive less than a year of it, dying early in 1699, when he was residing at the Old Artillery Ground. He was buried at St Stephen Walbrook on 31 January 1699. His eldest son, John, married a Cornish heiress, sat as MP for Bossiney and Camelford under William and Anne, and was a strong tory; but his other son, Isaac (a rebel in 1685), remained a whig and was well rewarded, becoming postmaster-general of Ireland and an Irish MP from 1713 to his death in 1737.<br>
