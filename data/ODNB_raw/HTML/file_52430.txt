<span class="headword">Lawson <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Albury]</span>,  Louisa</span>  (1848&#150;1920), <span class="occ">newspaper proprietor and suffragist in Australia</span>, was born on 17 February 1848 on Guntawang station, near Mudgee, New South Wales, Australia, the second of the twelve children of Henry Albury (1825&#150;1908), a station hand, and his wife, Harriet Elizabeth, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Winn (1826&#150;1895), a needlewoman, both English-born immigrants. Henry moved his family to Mudgee and later to New Pipeclay goldfield nearby, where he ran a bar. Louisa was educated at Mudgee national school. On 7 July 1866, at the Wesleyan parsonage, Mudgee, she married Niels Hertzberg Larsen (known as Peter Lawson), a Norwegian-born master mariner and goldminer. They went to the Grenfell goldfield, where their first son, Henry Archibald, was born on 17 June 1867. Living in harsh circumstances, with Peter often absent on contract work or fossicking, Louisa bore two other sons and twin daughters, one of whom died in infancy. She learned dressmaking, sold produce from Peter's small farm at Eurunderee, and became postmistress.<br>
<br>In 1883 Louisa Lawson and her younger children moved to Sydney. Earlier her second son, Charles, had run away to his grandmother after being savagely punished by his father. Mrs Albury ran a boarding-house in Sydney, where Charles was shortly to appear on a stealing charge. Louisa took boarders, resumed dressmaking, and brought her son Henry to Sydney to work as a carriage painter. Peter Lawson occasionally sent money and on his death in 1888 left her &pound;1103. Louisa encouraged Henry's literary ambitions. A brief flirtation with spiritualism brought them radical friends and together, under the name Archie Lawson, they edited <span class="italic">The Republican</span> (1887&#150;8). When it failed Louisa Lawson bought its press to publish <span class="italic">Dawn</span> (1888&#150;1905), a monthly newspaper for women. <span class="italic">Dawn</span> survived a boycott initiated by the all-male Typographical Union, which refused membership to Louisa's women typographers. It became the longest running and most successful early feminist journal in Australia, offering a lively mix of news, commentary, and service items. Louisa wrote most of the copy. She challenged the male monopoly of law and the conventions which disadvantaged women: her criticism of the behaviour of husbands to wives was as pungent as her reporting of laws which failed to protect women and of women's exclusion from public office. She condemned drunkenness, blamed prostitution on bad law, and called for appointment of women warders in gaols. She had a vision of women's coming role, which required they abandon frivolousness, dress sensibly, lead healthy lives, and become informed on public affairs.<br>
<br>There was a practical, even entrepreneurial, side to Louisa's preaching. To educate women she founded the Dawn Club, where &#145;bright clever papers&#146;, written by women in the interests of women, would be heard. She persuaded the Sydney Mechanics' School of Arts debating clubs to admit women, and encouraged women to join for experience in public speaking and also to attend its night classes. She was the first woman elected to its board of management. She took out a miner's right which carried entitlement to vote. She also ran a mail-order paper pattern and ready-made clothing business.<br>
<br>When the Womanhood Suffrage League was formed in 1891, Mrs Lawson brought her Dawn Club members into it. She printed its publicity material free of charge, gathered signatures for its suffrage petition, joined its delegation to the premier, Sir George Dibbs, and became one of its most valued public speakers. When the women of New South Wales were enfranchised in 1902, tribute was paid to Mrs Lawson. She joined the executive of the Women's Progressive Association, but physical and financial difficulties hampered her. Neither her novel <span class="italic">Dert and do</span> (1904) nor <span class="italic">The Lonely Crossing</span> (1905), a collection of poems, was a financial success. She closed <span class="italic">Dawn</span> in 1905 and became dependent on the sale of short stories.<br>
<br>In 1900 Louisa Lawson was thrown from a tram and seriously injured. She anticipated economic independence from a patent she held on a mailbag fastener but after protracted legal action alleging conspiracy to defraud won meagre compensation. Her son Charles lived with her, but was unstable and sometimes absent; she was estranged from Henry whose writing she had originally promoted. As alcoholism gripped him and his marriage failed, his embittered relations with his wife reverberated in his writing. Misogyny fuelled a literary tradition which labelled Louisa an uncaring, self-absorbed mother, a blight on a talented son.<br>
<br>With age Louisa Lawson's mind deteriorated and she refused food. She died on 12 August 1920 in Gladesville Hospital for the Insane and was buried on 14 August in Rookwood cemetery. Feminist historians in recent years have proclaimed her vigour in reform; Brian Matthews, in his prize-winning <span class="italic">Louisa</span> (1987), rescued her from the obloquy of literary critics and acknowledged the &#145;power and inventiveness&#146; of her poems.<br>
