<span class="headword">Ketch <span class="st"> [Catch]</span>,  John <span class="st"> [Jack]</span></span>  (<em>d.</em> 1686), <span class="occ">public executioner</span>, is in himself an obscure figure. Neither his parents nor his date of birth are known. Parish and probate records provide a little information. Ketch married a woman named Katherine, who survived him, and he and his wife are probably the John and Katherine Catch whose daughter Susanna was baptized on 1 June 1668 at St James's, Clerkenwell, the parish where he was buried eighteen years later. At the time of his death he was living in Spread Eagle Court, which lay on the east side of Gray's Inn Road.<h2>
<a name="SquireKetch"></a>Squire Ketch</h2>Even in his own lifetime Jack Ketch's job as the common hangman of London, a position which he held from some point between October 1666 and November 1678, made him a figure of popular mythology: the presiding figure at the execution days which took place eight times a year at Tyburn. In the surviving record he has come down less as an individual in his own right than as a name deployed for satiric purpose in broadsides and pamphlets and a subject of gossip for newsletter writers. Some writers leapt on striking incidents in his life. However, more generally he was presented as the archetype of the hangman by political satirists in the feverish atmosphere of the late 1670s and early 1680s, as he presided at the executions first of the Catholic victims of the Popish Plot allegations, and then of the whig victims of the tory revenge. In using his name in broadsides and pamphlets, propagandists were attempting to exploit the broader place of the common hangman in the imagination of Londoners.<br>
<br>That place was reflected in the appellation &#145;squire&#146; that was frequently attached to Ketch's name, a status which went back to 1617 when a herald as a joke had granted the then hangman Gregory Brandon a coat of arms. It was also captured in the ironic grandiloquence of several pamphlets. When the Tyburn gallows was lying on the ground in September 1678, quite possibly through vandalism, <span class="italic">The Tyburn Ghost</span> imagined &#145;Squire Ketch's Lamentation for the loss of his Shop&#146;  (title-page):<blockquote>The Tidings was quickly spread abroad. but when it arrived at Squire Ketch's Ear, `twas thought at first he would have Truss'd up himself for grief, that he should thus lose all Patience, and fill the Air with Exclamations against the villainous Authors of the Mischief. (<span class="italic">Tyburn Ghost</span>, 7)</blockquote>The following year <span class="italic">The Man of Destiny's Hard Fortune, or, Squire Ketch's Declaration</span> exploited the opportunity for humour provided by the hangman finding himself imprisoned in the king's bench and Marshalsea prisons for debt:<blockquote>shall the famous, the well-known, the redoubtable Squire Ketch, Death's Harbinger, Pluto's Van-courrier, Vice-roy of Fate, and sole Monarch of the Triple Throne, now tamely be Catch-pol'd, Nabb'd, spirited, Shoulder-dabb'd, Enchanted, Lavendar'd, and laid up in pickle in one of the Devil's Pepper-boxes? (p. 4)</blockquote>The pamphlet presented Ketch as a beleaguered tradesman. Twenty had died in his debt, &#145;having never a shirt on&#146; (a reference to the hangman's perquisite of his victims' clothes); he had been burgled and &#145;two of the principal Apartments of that ancient Edifice stoln away&#146; (referring to the collapse of the gallows). However, he was looking forward to an upturn in his trade:<blockquote>I hope I shall weather all my troubles, there shortly begins a Grand Mart on the Old Bayly, and other Customers are coming on apace; If things fadge right, I doubt not be before Midsomer to have twenty Guinnies with an Apprentice, and, in a Calesh of my own, wait upon my well-beloved Sons in a Cart or Sledg, when they perform their last Pilgrimage to TYBURN. (pp. 7&#150;8)</blockquote>The pamphlet also relished the cause of Ketch's debt, starkly contrasting with his reputation for hard drinking that other writers noted: he owed<blockquote>two and twenty pounds, and odd Farthings, for Milk, Oh abominable! The World sure will scandalize me for a Milk-sop, and think I fed like an old Britain, on nothing but Cows-baubby, drink only Whey like a Swine, or stuff my Guts every day with Fools, White-pot [a kind of milk pudding], and Custard. (p. 6)</blockquote>
<h2>
<a name="Theeminentphysician"></a>The eminent physician</h2>Increasingly from the late 1670s Ketch's name was called upon with grim humour as the symbol of the appropriate response to treason. A broadside celebrating the execution of Edward Colman on 3 December 1678 for his alleged part in the Popish Plot, <span class="italic">The plotters ballad, being Jack Ketch's incomparable receipt for the cure of trayterous recusants</span>, was illustrated with a woodcut showing Colman being drawn to Tyburn on a sled with the pope's pardon in his hand, saying &#145;I am sick of a trayterous disease&#146;, while Ketch stood over him with a hatchet in one hand and a rope in the other, saying, &#145;Here's your Cure. Sir&#146;. The theme was taken up in another broadside published early in 1680, <span class="italic">The Romanists best doctor, who by one infallible remedy, perfectly cures all popish-diseases whatsoever in a quarter of an hours time, By an approved dose which never yet failed his Patients. Which approved remedy may once a month be had at Tyburn, near Paddington, of that famous physician of long practice, John Ketch, Esq; physician in ordinary to the pope</span>. It placed Ketch in a long line of such &#145;physicians&#146; from the 1580s onwards. It assumed that the names of earlier hangmen such as Gregory (the nickname also of Richard Brandon who had succeeded his father) would have a resonance with London readers. The last of Ketch's predecessors, &#145;my Father Dunn&#146;, was credited with executing the Fifth Monarchists of Venner's rising in 1661 and Robert Hubert, the Frenchman hanged on 25 October 1666 for having started the great fire of London. The broadsheet concluded by listing those who had died for treason at Ketch's own hand&#151;from William Staley, hanged, drawn, and quartered on 26 November 1678, onwards.<br>
<br>With the changing political atmosphere, Ketch became the executioner of whig conspirators such as the London activist Stephen College, whom he executed at Oxford on 31 August 1681. His name was now deployed by tory satirists, generally in passing references which took for granted his role of meting out justice to disloyal whigs. Thus one poem of 1683 had the dying earl of Shaftesbury lamenting &#145;Now heart, break heart, and baffle Ketch and all&#146;  (de Lord and others, 3.408), while another on the suicide of the earl of Essex in the Tower on 13 July 1683 reflected that:<blockquote>
<div>Had'st thou but few days courage to withstand,<br>
</div>
<div>Jack Catch had done the business to thy hand.<br>
</div> (ibid., 457)</blockquote>
<span class="italic">Langley Curtis his Lamentation in Newgate</span>, responding to the gaoling of the whig printer, had as a running refrain Curtis bemoaning the fate of his party:<blockquote>
<div>There's none can defend us<br>
</div>
<div>Till Ketch doth befriend us<br>
</div>
<div>And send us a-hunting for Walcot below.<br>
</div> (ibid., 499&#150;504)</blockquote>The last line was varied with the names of different executed whigs. Other satire placed Ketch centre stage. The ballad <span class="italic">A Dialogue between Jack Ketch and his Journey-Man</span> (1683) has Ketch enjoining his assistant:<blockquote>
<div>Come prithee Nick,<br>
</div>
<div>Look sharp, be quick,<br>
</div>
<div>for now begins our Harvest;<br>
</div>
<div>Throw by thy Coat<br>
</div>
<div>Thou'st have a Cloak,<br>
</div>
<div>for Charles is now in earnest:<br>
</div>
<div>His Friends no more shall hang like dogs to please a bloody Faction;<br>
</div>
<div>Our damn'd Phanatick Plotting Rogues, shall breed no more distraction.<br>
</div>
</blockquote>The lengthy verse parody <span class="italic">A Bill and Answer betwixt Jack Catch Plaintiff, and Slingsby Bethel &amp; al. Defendants</span> (1686) imagined Ketch suing the republican Bethel, sheriff of London and Middlesex in 1680&#150;81, for cheating him of his wages, and Bethel admitting that he was Ketch's father. The satire gained particular force from the story that Bethel had been the man who cut off Charles I's head:<blockquote>
<div>To speak on, tho' a friend to the profession [of hangman],<br>
</div>
<div>And would again, upon the same occasion,<br>
</div>
<div>Faithfully serve the People of the Nation.<br>
</div>
<div>But to my great Content, dear Jack I see<br>
</div>
<div>While you survive, there'l be no need of me,<br>
</div>
<div>Thou art the Top of Fraternity.<br>
</div> (p. 2)</blockquote>There was, of course, another way of regarding Jack Ketch. His incompetence at the executions of William, Lord Russell, and James Scott, duke of Monmouth, became notorious&#151;the only two beheadings that Ketch performed and his most politically prominent victims. That notoriety was no doubt a matter of partisan hostility, but incompetence also muddied the sombre public message of execution&#151;only serving to highlight the stoicism of the victim and undercut the lesson of the legitimate power of the state&#151;and appeared unnecessarily cruel. According to an eyewitness at Russell's execution on 21 July 1683, &#145;The hangman gave him 3 blows, besides sawing with the ax, before he cut his head off&#146;  (Thompson, 2.32). Angry rumours of Ketch's incompetence and possibly deliberate inhumanity in executing the whig martyr were met by <span class="italic">The Apologie of John Ketch, Esq.</span>, purportedly Ketch's own vindication of himself:<blockquote>However since it is not fit that so Publick a Person as the Executioner of Justice and the Law's Sentence upon Criminals and Malefactors should lye under the scandal of untrue Reports, and be unjustly Expos'd to popular Clamour, I thought it a matter of highest importance to me to clear and Vindicate myself as to the matter of my Lord Russel's Execution, and the hard usage he is said to have had in the Severing of his Head from his Body.</blockquote>Ketch denied that he had turned up at the execution drunk; that he had received 20 guineas from Russell the night before (though he had received 10 guineas on the scaffold); that after the first blow the peer had said to him, &#145;you Dog, did I give you 10 Guennies to use me so Inhumanely&#146;; that his first blow had struck Russell on the shoulder; and that he had been consigned to Newgate for his incompetence. Above all, he denied that he &#145;had given my Lord more Blows then one out of design to put him to more then Ordinary Pain&#146;. Instead he blamed Russell for the messiness of his own death, who, showing &#145;more Galantry than Discretion&#146; had adopted an unsuitable posture and, refusing to have his eyes covered or make a signal, had flinched when the blow approached. Besides, Ketch had been disturbed as he was taking aim.<br>
<br>The beheading of the duke of Monmouth on 15 July 1685 was even more botched. On the scaffold Monmouth handed Ketch 6 guineas and ordered his servant to pay the executioner more once he had done his job well. &#145;Do not serve me as you did my Lord Russel,&#146; he reminded Ketch, &#145;I have heard, you struck him three or four times &hellip; If you strike me twice, I cannot promise you not to stir&#146;  (<span class="italic">An Account</span>, 3). In fact Ketch took five blows and almost gave up halfway through the execution. Edmund Verney reported that after the first blow Monmouth<blockquote>lookt up, &amp; after the third he putt his Leggs a Cross, &amp; the Hangman flung away his Axe, but being chidd tooke it againe &amp; gave him tother two strokes; and severed not his Head from his body till he cut it off with his Knife. (Verney, 2.404&#150;5)</blockquote>John Evelyn thought that Ketch's &#145;five Chopps &hellip; so incens'd the people, that had he not ben guarded &amp; got away they would have torne him in pieces&#146;  (Evelyn, 4.456). Whig lampoon linked Ketch's name with that other brutal defender of the crown, George Jeffreys: &#145;While Jeffreys on the bench, Ketch on the gibbet sits&#146;  (Macaulay, 3.618).<h2>
<a name="DownfalldeathandMrPunch"></a>Downfall, death, and Mr Punch</h2>More work for Ketch followed in the wake of Monmouth's rebellion, among it the execution of the former sheriff Henry Cornish outside his house in Cheapside on 23 October. Early in January Ketch fell out with the current sheriffs, and was turned out of his place and gaoled in Bridewell for a week. His replacement as hangman was Pascha Rose, a butcher with a criminal record who was fined and sentenced to be whipped from Rosemary Lane to the Hermitage within days of his appointment. Rose's offence, like Ketch's, was insubordination. In October 1685 he had been brought before the magistrate Charles Osborne as a disturber of the peace; in December, brought before the same magistrate for bigamy, he was charged with having said, &#145;God damn Justice Osborne &hellip; I am sorry I had not a Rasour for him&#146;  (Jeaffreson, 4.300), and duly convicted at the January sessions.<br>
<br>The version of these events recorded by the nonconformist diarist Roger Morrice is at best only partially accurate (he has both Ketch and Rose condemned by the City authorities, whereas in both cases they were punished in Middlesex), but gives some sense of the politicized gossip around Ketch's name. According to Morrice, Ketch had presented a bill &#145;for extraordinary charges in quartering of traitors, and boyling their bodies &amp;c&#146;. When he refused to pay such an exorbitant sum, &#145;Ketch told the sheriff if he did not pay it, he would serve him as he did his master Cornish&#146;. Hauled before the lord mayor and aldermen, he tried to excuse himself by claiming that his words meant &#145;not that he would hang him, but that he should execute the offenders himselfe as he told his master Cornish in the like case&#146;  (DWL, Morrice Ent'ring Book P, 517). The parallel between Ketch's and Rose's offences was made even stronger in Morrice's version: &#145;Rose having executed some &hellip; came to the sheriff with a bill (which the sheriff somewhat roughly refused to pay) Rose told him if he had had a pistoll in his pockett he would have shot him thorough&#146;  (ibid.). According to Morrice it was Ketch who whipped Rose through the streets.<br>
<br>Both Ketch's gaoling and Rose's flogging produced satirical broadsides. The broadside <span class="italic">Jack Catch his Bridewel Oration</span> (14 January 1686) imagined him addressing his daughter who had come to view him in prison:<blockquote>
<div>Go, get thee home, thou little staring fool,<br>
</div>
<div>When I come out thou shalt to th' Boarding School.<br>
</div>
</blockquote>It relished presenting Ketch warning his hearers against the vices which had brought him to prison, an ironic variant on the commonplace theme of the sins which led to the gallows:<blockquote>
<div>Thus haughty <i>Jack</i> you see will bate his Pride<br>
</div>
<div>Rather than be a Tennant to St Bride.<br>
</div>
<div>Then learn by me all you that stomach it<br>
</div>
<div>All you that grumble as you thought not fit,<br>
</div>
<div>To your superiors freely to submit,<br>
</div>
<div>Least <i>I</i> put in and nimbly tye the String,<br>
</div>
<div>Which may perhaps too late repentance bring<br>
</div>
<div>And you a Tune that does not please you Sing.<br>
</div>
</blockquote>
<span class="italic">Pleasant Discourse by Way of Dialogue between the Old and New Jack Catch</span> had Old Catch admitting that he had indeed been &#145;within a Spit and a Stride&#146; of the same punishment as his successor.<br>
<br>Rose was pardoned his fine in February 1686, and appears to have retained the office until he was himself hanged for housebreaking in April. Ketch was reinstated, but was dead within the year. He was buried in St James's, Clerkenwell, on 29 November 1686. His wife was granted the administration of his estate, the record of the grant recognizing Ketch's status as esquire. The antiquary Matthew Hutton provided an apt epitaph on Ketch's reputation for brutality when he reported to Thomas Comber that the whig pamphleteer Samuel Johnson &#145;was whipd on Wednesday but civilly used by the new hangman, Jack Ketch being buried 2 dayes before&#146;  (<span class="italic">Autobiographies</span>, 1.150).<br>
<br>Already by 1699 <span class="italic">A New Dictionary of the &hellip; Canting Crew</span> could define &#145;Jack Kitch&#146; as &#145;the Hangman of that Name, but now all his Successors&#146;. And for the next century and more &#145;Jack Ketch&#146; was the generic name for the common hangman: the name &#145;vulgarly given to all who have succeeded him in his odious office&#146;, as Macaulay noted in 1848  (Macaulay, 3.618). &#145;Dine with John Wilkes, Sir! I'd as soon dine with Jack Ketch!&#146; Boswell imagined would be Samuel Johnson's reply if he suggested such a meeting  (J. Boswell, <span class="italic">Life of Johnson</span>, ed. R. W. Chapman, 1980, 765). A correspondent of Hannah More, Sir William Weller Pepys, paid testimony to the continuing appeal of Ketch's name when in looking for an example of his enthusiasm for all biography he admitted that &#145;were I to begin the Life of Jack Ketch, I should never quit him till I saw him hanged on his own gallows, and read his last dying speech&#146;  (W. Roberts, <span class="italic">Memoirs of the Life and Correspondence of Mrs Hannah More</span>, 3rd edn, 4 vols., 1834, 3.370). The nickname attached itself to even as notorious a hangman in his own right as William Calcraft, who was active from 1829 onwards. In the 1830s Edmund Gibbon Wakefield entitled an attack on the use of the death penalty for all but the most serious crimes, <span class="italic">The hangman and the judge, or, A letter from Jack Ketch to Mr. Justice Alderson; revised by the ordinary of Newgate</span> while Charles Whitehead's <span class="italic">The Autobiography of a Notorious Legal Functionary (Jack Ketch)</span> provided a parody of contemporary moralizing crime literature.<br>
<br>However, the durability of Ketch's name was most strikingly witnessed, and indeed sealed, by his role as a foil to Mr Punch. The character of Punch came to England in the Restoration period and his persona was very much established by the early eighteenth century in the booths of Bartholomew fair and elsewhere. However, the classic Punch and Judy puppet show seems to have been a development of the late eighteenth century, its heyday in the decades around 1800. This was very much the Punch and Judy performed in the streets and back rooms of pubs for an adult audience, the show not yet rendered safe for the Victorian parlour or end of the pier. Judy, Jack Ketch, and Lucifer were the three characters most consistently present in versions of the show which had taken shape by 1820, in which the cheerfully amoral serial killer Punch slaughtered his way through wife and baby, the agents of the law, and finally Lucifer&#151;&#145;the triad of social controls: wife, hangman and devil&#151;marriage, law and morality&#146;  (Gatrell, 121). In some versions the show climaxed with Ketch's death rather than the Devil's. Bernard Blackmantle in 1826 described Ketch as &#145;a greater man than old Lucifer&#146; and the scene where Mr Punch duped Ketch into putting his head in the noose as &#145;the ne plus ultra of [Punch's] exploits, the cream of all his comicalities &hellip; Mr John Ketch hangs suspended in the air&#151;Punch stands in a glorious triumph&#151;[and] all the world backs him in his conquest&#146;  (Leach, 53). &#145;Why were you so cruel as to commit so many murders?&#146; Ketch asks Punch in the performance recorded by John Payne Collier; &#145;But that's no reason why you should be cruel too, and murder me,&#146; Punch replies  (Gatrell, 121). Ketch was the only puppet apart from Punch who needed dummy legs, for the jerking movements as he hanged.<br>
<br>The Punch and Judy show presented a world turned upside down, where the hangman was defeated, and was distinctively plebeian. Yet in its sardonic reflections on the common hangman as the brutal guarantor of the social and political order, its grim acknowledgement of his power and its ironic take on the frail pretensions of the human agent who dispensed death on behalf of the state, it is not so far removed from the versions of Ketch that were deployed in the social satire and political propaganda in his own lifetime which so successfully imprinted his name in popular memory.<br>
