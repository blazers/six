<span class="headword">Thorpe,  Francis</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1594, <em>d.</em> 1665), <span class="occ">judge</span>, was baptized on 1 October 1594 at Leconfield, Yorkshire, the eldest son of Roger Thorpe (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1626), of Birdsall, Yorkshire, and his wife, Elizabeth, daughter of William Danyell of Beswick. He was born into a cadet branch of a long-established East Riding family, the Thorpes of Thorpe. His father, a Gray's Inn lawyer, was one of James I's gentleman ushers and quarter waiters, and he served as a JP and as sewers commissioner for the East Riding. Thorpe was admitted to Gray's Inn on 12 February 1611 and to St John's College, Cambridge, on 8 November following (graduating BA in 1614). He was called to the bar at Gray's Inn on 11 May 1621. By the mid-1590s Thorpe's family had moved to Leconfield, and in 1624 Thorpe was elected recorder of the nearby borough of Beverley, where he took up residence. He married Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1666), daughter of William Oglethorpe of Rawdon, and widow successively of Thomas Wise and Francis Denton. Thorpe was appointed an ancient of Gray's Inn in 1632, a bencher in 1640, and an autumn reader in 1641.<br>
<br>During the course of his legal practice Thorpe fell foul of Thomas, Viscount Wentworth (the future earl of Strafford), president of the council of the north. About 1630 Wentworth had Thorpe removed from the East Riding bench, and then detained in London for failing to pay &#145;knighthood money&#146;, although the real reason, according to Thorpe, was his use of writs of prohibition, which Wentworth saw as a slight to conciliar authority  (Rushworth, 8.142). With the help of George, Lord Goring, Thorpe obtained Wentworth's permission to leave London, but back in Yorkshire he was made to kneel in submission before the council. Thorpe was a witness at Strafford's trial in 1641, giving evidence on the first article, that Strafford had exercised an arbitrary power in the north. Strafford's hostility towards Thorpe was not shared by his friend Algernon Percy, tenth earl of Northumberland, who retained Thorpe as one of his counsellors-at-law. Northumberland owned considerable property in Leconfield, and Thorpe's father had served as an estate officer to the Percies. It was possibly on Northumberland's recommendation that Thorpe had been appointed recorder of Hull in 1639.<br>
<br>Thorpe seems to have remained in London for much of the civil war, and in 1643 he served as a legal assistant to the Lords. On 20 October 1645 he was elected as a &#145;recruiter&#146; MP for the North Riding borough of Richmond, although he was apparently more assiduous in serving Hull's interests at Westminster than those of his constituents. He was probably returned on the recommendation of northern peer and ally of Northumberland, Philip, Lord Wharton, who enjoyed considerable influence in the borough. Thorpe was closely aligned at Westminster with the independent faction, of which Northumberland and Wharton were leading members. He was named to several committees for drawing up the Newcastle peace propositions (which struck at the Scots' confederalist terms for settlement), and was instrumental in introducing legislation over the winter of 1646&#150;7 to recompense Viscount Saye and Sele for losing the mastership of the recently abolished court of wards. Saye was a leading independent, and the leveller John Wildman claimed that the scheme to recompense the court's officers was part of a design by Oliver Cromwell and Henry Ireton to enrich their political allies. Thorpe's letters to Hull corporation during the mid-1640s reveal that he shared the Independents' distrust of the king, and their desire to impose a stringent settlement upon him. He also emerges as a friend of the Hull preacher John Shawe&#151;a moderate Independent divine who probably favoured an Erastian presbyterian church with limited toleration.<br>
<br>During the second civil war Thorpe played a leading role in organizing parliament's forces in the north, and was rewarded with the stewardship of the duke of Buckingham's sequestered estates in Yorkshire. In October 1648 parliament appointed Thorpe a serjeant-at-law, Lord Wharton acting as one of his sponsors. Thorpe retained his seat at Pride's Purge, and was seen by William Prynne and others as a firm adherent of the pro-army &#145;junto&#146; (W. Prynne, <span class="italic">A Brief Memento to the Present Unparliamentary Junto</span>, 1649, 10; <span class="italic">Remonstrance and Declaration of Severall Counties, Cities and Burroughs</span>, 1648, 4&#150;8). Nevertheless, although named as a commissioner to try the king, Thorpe took no part in the trial proceedings, and he did not make his dissent to the vote on 5 December until after the king's execution. Evidently trusted by the Rump Parliament, he was appointed in February 1649 to ride the northern circuit. In his charge to the grand jury at York in March he justified the establishment of the Commonwealth, arguing that although the people, under God, were &#145;the original of all just power&#146;, the only proper agency of such authority was the Rump  (<span class="italic">Harleian Miscellany</span>, 2.2&#150;3). In April he was thanked by the house for his &#145;great services done to the Commonwealth in the last circuit&#146;  (<span class="italic">JHC</span>, 6.187). On 1 June he was made one of the barons of the exchequer, an office reputedly worth &pound;1000 per annum, but he was obliged to resign his recorderships. On 1 April 1650 he was named one of the commissioners in the act for establishing a new high court of justice.<br>
<br>Although Thorpe was active under the Rump Parliament, particularly in a legal capacity, several commentators alleged that he became disaffected to the republican interest. A royalist agent described him in 1650 as mistrustful of the army and willing to comply with its supporters only to avoid exciting their suspicion. However, Thorpe's commitment to the Rump Parliament was sufficient to make him exchange &#145;a gown for a sword&#146;  (<span class="italic">Mercurius Politicus</span>, 14&#150;21 Aug 1651, 1001) in 1651 to help resist the invading Scots. In the elections to the first protectorate parliament in 1654 Thorpe was returned for Beverley. In November 1654 he was appointed one of the judges on the western circuit and the following March he became a commissioner for trying the insurgents in Penruddock's rising. After proceeding against the western rebels he was ordered by Cromwell to sit in judgement on their Yorkshire counterparts. He and Sir Richard Newdigate, however, protested against dispensing with the usual lapse of fifteen days before acting upon a newly issued commission, and objected to trying men without evidence of treasonable intent. The two judges's delay in proceeding was rightly interpreted as a refusal to serve, and they were removed from office on 3 May. In the elections to the second protectorate parliament in 1656 Thorpe was returned for Beverley again, but was prevented from sitting&#151;probably as an opponent of the major-generals&#151;and he signed the remonstrance of the excluded members. In November 1657, in a petition to Cromwell for his arrears of salary, he acknowledged that he had incurred the protector's displeasure, but hoped that since he had now returned to private practice his petition would be allowed. A warrant was issued for payment of his arrears on 8 February 1658. At the start of the second session in January 1658 Thorpe was allowed to take his seat in the Commons. He spoke against the Cromwellian upper house, arguing that although the &#145;old constitution, by Lords and Commons&#146; was best, it was dangerous to give the peers or their replacements a negative voice  (<span class="italic">Diary of Thomas Burton</span>, 2.447).<br>
<br>Thorpe resumed his seat when the Rump Parliament was restored in May 1659, and in the summer of that year rode the northern circuit with John Parker. He was reinstated as one of the barons of the exchequer by the Rump on 19 January 1660 and ordered to ride the northern circuit for the Lent assizes. He was one of only three judges whose patent of office was not renewed at the Restoration. In May 1660 he petitioned the king for a special pardon, avowing that he had opposed the regicide, had never purchased crown lands, and had refused to try the Yorkshire royalists in 1655. He was among those named in the Commons on 13 June for exclusion from the <span class="roman">Act of Indemnity</span> and, having been accused of detaining &pound;25,000 as receiver of public money in Yorkshire, William Prynne desired that Thorpe might suffer death, like the Judge Thorpe who had been executed in 1350 for taking bribes. However, several members spoke in Thorpe's defence and he was given the benefit of the act. Thorpe died intestate (leaving a personal estate of about &pound;9000) and without surviving children at his country seat of Bardsey Grange, near Leeds, and he was buried at Bardsey church on 7 June 1665. His widow died on 1 August 1666 and was buried with him.<br>
