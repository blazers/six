<span class="headword">Zuccaro,  Federico</span>  (1539/40&#150;1609), <span class="occ">painter</span>, was born at Sant'Angelo in Vado in the Marche Italy, the son of the painter Ottaviano Zuccaro (<i>b</i>. 1505) and Antonia Nari. His birth date is calculated from an inscription on a festival design executed in 1565 that identifies the artist as twenty-five years old. Zuccaro has suffered historically from the comparison with his older and shorter-lived brother and frequent collaborator Taddeo Zuccaro (1529&#150;1566), about whom far less is known although he possessed, by consensus, a far greater artistic talent. The more copious documentary evidence on Federico&#151;including his own published writings, correspondence, and often angry marginal annotations to his personal copy of Giorgio Vasari's biography of his brother&#151;forms the impression of a worldly and ambitious artist, sensitive to slights, who exploited the more conservative religious atmosphere following the Council of Trent to achieve success.<br>
<br>Federico Zuccaro went to Rome in 1550 while still a youth to live and train with his brother whom he assisted on several frescoed fa&ccedil;ade commissions between 1555 and 1560. In 1559 he received his first independent fa&ccedil;ade commission, for the Roman house of Tizio Chermandio da Spoleto, the <i>maestro di casa</i> of Cardinal Alessandro Farnese. Thereafter, in addition to continuing to work with his brother on the decorations of Farnese's country villa at Caprarola and Vatican projects for Pope Pius through the early 1560s, Federico also went to Venice in October 1563 until July 1565, where he received commissions from the Grimani family for both their palace and their family chapel in the church of San Francesco della Vigna. He also competed unsuccessfully to replace a large fourteenth-century painting in the sala del gran consiglio. His departure from Venice was prompted by the invitation to journey to Florence to contribute to the wedding decorations of Grand Duke Francesco de' Medici and Joanna of Austria, an event that took place on 26 December 1565. While in Florence he was elected to membership in the Accademia delle Arti del Disegno on 14 October 1565. Following Taddeo's death in 1566 Federico was asked to complete his brother's paintings in the Pucci chapel in the church of Trinit&agrave; dei Monti and to oversee the continuing work at Caprarola, the latter involvement lasting until his resignation under duress in July 1569. Until June 1573 Federico was active on commissions in Rome and Orvieto, at which time he left Italy and arrived in Paris in September to enter the service of Cardinal Carlo di Guisa.<br>
<br>After the cardinal's death in December 1574 Zuccaro moved on to Antwerp and then to London, where he was introduced into the circle of Robert Dudley, earl of Leicester and, consequently, to the court of Elizabeth I, where he remained from March to August 1575. The assumed purpose of his visit was to paint the portraits of Leicester and the queen. While no such image of Elizabeth survives, it is thought that the portrait of Leicester was executed and that it was destroyed during the Second World War. Both sitters are rendered in autograph red and black chalk studies by Zuccaro in the collection of the British Museum. Owing to a misunderstanding of how long he was actually in residence Zuccaro has traditionally been credited with stimulating the revival in full-length portraits in England. Given his brief presence there, however, and a number of full-length English portraits that predate 1575, it is doubtful that this is the case. Apart from the surviving drawings of Dudley and Elizabeth, only two drawings unquestionably from his English sojourn survive. These are chalk copies in Berlin after Hans Holbein's lost paintings for the Steelyard Guild in London. Zuccaro, however, made many sketches after works of art during his travels and some additional works with English provenance might still be identified.<br>
<br>From 1575 to 1579, with brief interruptions, Federico executed the remaining two-thirds of the frescoes of the last judgment in the cupola of the Florentine cathedral of Santa Maria dei Fiore left unfinished by Vasari at his death in the summer of 1574. In 1578 he married Francesca Genga. By the end of 1579 he returned to Rome and work on decorations for the Pauline chapel for Pope Gregory XIII Boncampagni of Bologna. A simultaneous commission for an altarpiece in Bologna, when rejected by its patron, provoked the sensitive artist to design a large allegorical satire against his detractors, the so-called Port Virtutis, that was set up in Rome against the fa&ccedil;ade of the church of San Luca a Monte Santa Maria Maggiore on 18 October 1581, the feast day of St Luke, patron saint of artists. This act resulted in the artist's immediate expulsion from the city by the pope. He was not pardoned until the end of 1583, by which time the ever-enterprising artist had achieved commissions in Venice and Urbino. A major commission from Philip II to participate in the painted decorations at El Escorial brought Federico to Spain in late 1585, where he remained until the end of 1588. His return to Rome was marked by an elevation of his status as artist and gentleman as he was made a citizen by senate decree in 1591, began work on an impressive palazzo on the Pincian Hill not far from Trinit&agrave; dei Monti, and was named <i>principe</i> of the Accademia di San Luca in 1593. His well-preserved painted decorations at the Palazzo Zuccaro (now the German art history institute in Rome) are an inventive combination of high-minded allegory and family history. Several important public Roman fresco and altarpiece commissions were executed during this late period; most noteworthy are those in the cappella degli Angeli in the church of the Ges&ugrave; in 1592 and in the cappella Ascoli of Santa Sabina in 1600.<br>
<br>The last decade of Federico Zuccaro's life was dedicated to some lesser paintings executed for patrons in Pavia, Turin, Bologna, and the Borromeo Islands in Lake Maggiore, but this was also the period of publication of his elaborate biographical and theoretical treatises <span class="italic">Lettere e principi et signori amatori del disegno, pittura, scultura et architettura</span> published in Mantua in 1605 and <span class="italic">Idea dei pittori, scultori et architetti</span> published in Turin in 1607. He died of a fever in Ancona while travelling from Loreto to Urbino on 20 July 1609. In August his remains were interred with those of his brother Taddeo in the Pantheon in Rome. In his memoir of Zuccaro in the <span class="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</span> Lionel Cust drew attention to the &#145;reckless profusion&#146; of British portraits that had been attributed to that artist, and stated that Zuccaro was in Britain for a much shorter period than was originally believed. Subsequent research has reduced further the period of his stay in Britain and the number of works he produced there. Zuccaro was a successful pan-continental artist employed by popes, cardinals, and kings in Italy, Spain, England, and France.<br>
