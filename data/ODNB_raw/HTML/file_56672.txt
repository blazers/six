<span class="headword">Sabini,  (Charles) Darby</span>  (1888&#150;1950), <span class="occ">gang leader</span>, was a prominent figure on racecourses during the 1920s and 1930s. In his lifetime he was variously known as Octavius (or Ottavio) Sabini, but more widely as Charles Darby Sabini or Darby Sabini, and, among other aliases, Frank Handley  (TNA:PRO HO 45/23691). He was probably the boy named &#145;Otavia&#146;  (b. cert.) whose birth was registered as having taken place at 4 Little Bath Street, Holborn, London, on 11 July 1888, the son of Charles Handley, builder's labourer, and his wife, Elizabeth Eliza, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Fryer (1864&#150;1919). He grew up in London's Little Italy, Saffron Hill, and his mother married at St Paul's, Clerkenwell, on 14 December 1898, Otavio Sabini (1853&#150;1902), a carman of Italian descent, whom he later described as his father  (m. cert.). As Ottavio Sabini he attended Drury Lane industrial school (an institution for neglected children considered in danger of delinquency) until 1900 when he became a pupil at Laystall Street elementary school in Holborn. He left school in July 1902, at thirteen, and became involved with Dan Sullivan, a boxing promoter. Sabini was a promising fighter but he disliked the arduous training and became a bouncer at Sullivan's promotions in Hoxton Baths. He married at St Paul's, Clerkenwell, on 21 December 1913, Annie Emma Potter (1892&#150;1978), daughter of William John Potter, warehouseman. They had at least three daughters and one son. His reputation as a hard man was established in 1920 in a bar brawl at the Griffin public house in Saffron Hill. A notorious enforcer for a gang from south London insulted an Italian barmaid: Sabini knocked him out and gained status as the protector both of Italians and women.<h2>
<a name="Protectionrackets"></a>Protection rackets</h2>At this time the racecourses of southern England were preyed on by gangs extorting money from bookmakers. The main group was the Brummagem Boys. Their leader, <a name="cosubject_56601"></a><span class="headword">William <span class="st"> [Billy]</span> Kimber</span>  (1882&#150;1945)<span class="occ"></span>, was born at no. 55 Court, Summer Lane, Birmingham, on 7 February 1882, the second son in the family of at least four sons and one daughter of William Kimber (1854/5&#150;1930), brass founder, and his wife, Catherine, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Farrell, a laundress who had previously worked as an electro-plater. He became a brass caster, but aged nineteen was imprisoned in Winson Green gaol for wounding. By then he had a child with Maud Beatrice Harbridge (1882/3&#150;1926), a bedstead ornamenter, whom he later married on 1 November 1902; she was the daughter of John Harbridge, bedstead caster. They had another daughter (a further daughter died in infancy) but by 1911 Kimber had abandoned them. He described himself as a <span class="occ">bookmaker and punter (better on horse-races)</span> from Bordesley in Birmingham, but he was really a gang leader. Since the late 1800s &#145;roughs&#146; from Birmingham had terrorized many racecourses, and especially those in the south of England, and in the early twentieth century it seems that they were joined by others from south London.<br>
<br>The Birmingham gang was not a firm grouping under the tight control of Kimber. From about 1916 &#145;three low blackguards, always more or less full of liquor&#146; began to terrify and blackmail a number of small-scale London East End Jewish bookies  (Divall, 183). After one of them was assaulted badly they turned for help to <a name="cosubject_56594"></a><span class="headword">Edward Emmanuel</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1900&#150;1930)<span class="occ"></span>. He was regarded as &#145;a financial power&#146; and as &#145;the guv'nor before Darby Sabini&#146;  (Chinn, interviews with Prince, 1). Little is known about Emmanuel's early life but it is believed that he once worked as a market porter at Spitalfields, where he became involved in spieling (illegal gaming activities). He came to notice in 1904 when he threatened to shoot an Islington street trader and was charged with possession of a loaded revolver. Emmanuel stated he was a salesman but the magistrate declared that he was &#145;a dangerous fellow&#146; and imposed a high surety of &pound;250 or twelve months' imprisonment  (Samuel, 316). Four years later a John McCarthy attempted to kill Emmanuel in east London. Both men were described as market porters. Over the next few years Emmanuel established himself as a proprietor of spielers and as a fixer of boxing fights. It was also alleged that he was in collusion with certain police officers and that for a payment he could arrange lighter sentences for Jewish criminals. By the early 1920s he was regarded &#145;as in charge of the whole East End underworld&#151;or at least the Jewish part of it&#146;  (ibid., 204).<br>
<br>Emmanuel &#145;was pally with the Italian push&#146;, Darby Sabini's gang, and he recruited them to protect the Jewish bookies  (Chinn, interviews with Prince, 1). This action led to protracted violence on many racecourses in southern England, and as one Jewish bookie recalled, &#145;it was us against them, the North against the South&#146;  (ibid., interview with S. Lewis, 1). On 25 March 1921 Sabini was attacked by a mob of Brummies at Greenford Trotting Park, and a few days later Kimber was shot when he went to the Italian's flat to try to calm matters. The trouble escalated and there were serious fights, but Kimber's position was weakened in June 1921 when the Brummagem Boys attacked a coachload of bookies from Leeds, believing that the vehicle was actually used by the Sabini gang. The Birmingham men were arrested in a pub nearby, and the next month twenty-three of them were imprisoned. It was believed widely that Sabini was bribing certain police officers and by the summer of 1921 he had the upper hand over Kimber.<br>
<br>Fearful of further trouble, on 23 August leading southern bookmakers formed the Bookmakers' and Backers' Racecourse Protection Association (BBRPA; subsequently a respected organization). The vice-president was Emmanuel, whose connection was explained by his interests in credit betting away from the racecourses. At the inaugural dinner of the association in December 1921 it was explained that he was giving &#145;very valuable assistance&#146;  (<span class="italic">Bookmakers' and Backers' Racecourse Protection Association</span>, 6). This help consisted of finding eight stewards who were each paid the large sum of &pound;6 a week to protect bookies who were members of the BBRPA. It seems that Edward Emmanuel saw an opportunity to wrest control of the protection rackets on the southern racecourses from the Brummagem Boys, and he became involved in providing the lists of runners for various races. They were brought out for as little as a farthing each but &#145;to the bookies they were half a crown a set&#146;  (Greeno, 166).<h2>
<a name="DominanceofSabini"></a>Dominance of Sabini</h2>In 1922 Kimber acknowledged Sabini's power on the racecourses of southern England, but continued to operate his &#145;services&#146; to bookies in the midlands and the north, where he helped to minimize the bullying of lesser gangs. Although Kimber's income was gained from violence, he was called &#145;one of the best&#146; by a former chief inspector at Scotland Yard who was employed by the racecourses to keep order at various meetings and who was saved from a beating by Kimber  (Divall, 201). He was remembered by some Brummie bookies as &#145;a game un&#146;, a fearless fighter who fought fairly with his hands and did not use knives  (Chinn, interview with Green, 1). Following the death of his first wife, and now describing himself as a china and glass dealer, Kimber married secondly, on 19 July 1926, Elizabeth (<i>b</i>. 1896), daughter of Thomas Garnham, china dealer. He went to America in 1927 following a shooting incident at a club connected with the Sabini gang, but returned in 1929. Subsequently the ageing Kimber was no longer associated with bullying and coercion, and had come to be &#145;greatly respected&#146; by some well-known London bookmakers who had not been involved in the preceding gang wars  (ibid., interview with Dell, 5&#150;6; Maskey, 9). He became a prosperous bookmaker, settling in Torquay at Park Hill Road. He died at the Mount Stuart Nursing Home on 27 June 1945.<br>
<br>Sabini not only defeated Kimber but he also outmanoeuvred Emmanuel, forcing him to withdraw from the racecourses&#151;although the Jewish gangster later set up a profitable company which printed the tickets used by bookmakers as a receipt for their punters (customers). With no opposition, Sabini took over the protection rackets in the south of England which led the BBRPA to dispense with his services. However, he went on to become the leading gangster in southern England. Sabini's men provided a variety of &#145;services&#146; to bookies, which they did not in fact need. These included payment for &#145;dots and dashes&#146;, whereby a racecard was marked to alert the bookmaker to the form of the horses and which told the bookie nothing more than he knew already; and the calling-out of the numbers allotted to the runners in a race. Bookmakers were also &#145;encouraged&#146; to pay for the tools of their trade like lists of runners, stools to stand on, pieces of chalk with which to mark up the odds of the horses on a blackboard, and water with which to rub them out. Bookies were charged 2<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>. for each of these &#145;facilities&#146;, and at major meetings there could be as many as sixty bookmakers taking bets on up to eight races. In addition Sabini controlled the five or six best pitches (positions from which a bookie did business) at each meeting and put his own men on them on a &#145;ten bob in the pound basis&#146;  (Chinn, interview with Dell, 5). These protection rackets were highly profitable. He brought a libel action against D. C. Thomson, publishers of the <span class="italic">Topical Times</span>, which had named him as notorious in turf gangs  (12 April 1924). He failed to appear when the case came before the high court in December 1925; costs were awarded against him, which the publishers pursued. Declared bankrupt in 1926, he denied during the proceedings that he earned at least &pound;20,000 each year  (Morton, 30).<h2>
<a name="Racetrackcontrols"></a>Racetrack controls</h2>From 1929 stringent controls by the Jockey Club and the Bookmakers' Protection Association stopped Sabini controlling the best pitches, while his other racecourse activities were combated by the police. Making less money, Sabini moved into protection rackets at greyhound tracks and at drinking and gambling clubs in the West End of London. Sabini successfully thwarted challenges by other gangs, including the Cortesi brothers from within Saffron Hill and by the English Hoxton mob, but he lost his position of authority in the Second World War when he was interned in April 1940 as an alien on the Isle of Man. By then he had a penthouse flat in the Grand Hotel, Brighton, Sussex.<br>
<br>After the war Sabini settled in Hove, Sussex, and became a small bookie. Despite his wealth, in his heyday he was unostentatious. He wore a flat cap, collarless shirt, high-buttoned waistcoat, and dark suit. A later gangland boss stated that Sabini &#145;stood for no liberties&#146;, while a bookie remembered that &#145;he was the gentleman of the mob but he feared no one&#146;  (Hill, 5; Chinn, interview with Prince, 2). He was regarded by many as &#145;Uncle Bob&#146;, someone who was courteous to women and who was generous to children, the needy, and the local Catholic church. To others he was a ruthless gangster and extortioner. One policeman recalled that he &#145;and his thugs used to stand sideways on to let the bookmakers see the hammers in their pockets&#146;  (Greeno, 12). Sabini was said always to carry a loaded pistol, and he did not hesitate to order the vicious beating and razor-slashing of opponents. It is likely that he was the model for the gang leader Colleoni in Graham Greene's novel <span class="italic">Brighton Rock</span> (1938). When Sabini died at his home in Old Shoreham Road, Hove, on 4 October 1950, he left little money, although his clerk was later found to have &pound;36,000 and it was believed that this was Sabini's cash.<br>
