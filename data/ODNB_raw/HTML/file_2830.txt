<span class="headword">Bond,  Nathaniel</span>  (1634&#150;1707), <span class="occ">lawyer</span>, was born on 14 June 1634 at Dorchester, Dorset, the fourth son of one of the town's puritan leaders, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2821/', "Denis Bond (1588&#150;1658)")</script>, a linen draper, and his second wife, Lucy (<i>d</i>. 1651), daughter of William Lawrence of Winterbourne Steepleton, Dorset, and widow of John Fley, vicar of Buckerell, Devon. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2826/', "John Bond")</script> was one of his half-brothers. In 1648 the parliamentary visitors at Oxford University awarded Nathaniel Bond a fellowship at All Souls College. He matriculated from Wadham College in 1650, graduating as bachelor of civil law after four years' study, and proceeded to the Inner Temple, where he was called to the bar in 1661. With only a legacy of &pound;500 under his father's will he must have drawn upon his professional earnings to purchase Lutton, the ancestral home of the Bond family, from his elder brothers. On 21 December 1667 he married Elizabeth Churchill (<i>b</i>. 1648/9), daughter and coheir of John Churchill, rector of Steeple in Dorset. She died without issue on 18 December 1674, and Bond's second marriage, on 3 August 1675, marked a decisive advance in social status. Mary (1641/2&#150;1728), with whom he had two sons, was the daughter of Lewis Williams of Shitterton and the widow of Thomas Browne of Frampton; both families ranked among the established Dorset gentry and both had supported parliament in the civil war. With a dowry of &pound;2000 and a jointure of two large farms on the Frampton estate she was well provided for.<br>
<br>Bond succeeded his brother Samuel as recorder of Weymouth in 1673. He was elected as a whig for Corfe Castle in 1679 and for his father's old constituency of Dorchester in 1681. But he never showed much interest in parliament. Upon Churchill's death in 1682, Bond presented to Steeple the controversial Samuel Bold, whose sermon against persecution was published by Awnsham Churchill in the same year. In consequence the grand jury at the winter assizes of 1684 found a true bill against him for seditious practices. Like Bold, Bond was a strong supporter of James II's policy of toleration in 1687&#150;8, with its repeal of Roman Catholic as well as protestant nonconformist disabilities. He became a bencher of the Inner Temple in 1687 and was recommended as court candidate for Weymouth; but as one of James's whig collaborators, he failed to find a seat in the Convention Parliament, though he accepted the somewhat empty dignity of serjeant-at-law in May 1689. By the purchase of Creech Grange in 1691 he took the decisive step that propelled the family into county magnate status. He was advanced to king's serjeant and, according to family tradition, refused a judgeship from love of solitude. Regaining his Dorchester seat in 1695, he was one of the few whigs to scruple at the attainder of Sir John Fenwick. In 1699 he was made recorder of Poole. He retired from his profession on the accession of Anne and the return to power of the tories, and died at Creech Grange on 31 August 1707. He was buried at Steeple the following day. A portrait of his widow, who survived him for more than twenty years, remains with his descendants, but no likeness of Bond himself survives.<br>
