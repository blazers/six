</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Lean, Sir  David</span>  (1908&#150;1991), <span class="occ">film director</span>, was born at 38 Blenheim Crescent, Croydon, on 25 March 1908, the elder of the two sons of Francis William Le Blount Lean (<i>d</i>. 1973) and his wife, Helena Annie Tangye (<i>d</i>. 1962). The Tangyes and the Leans were both old-established Quaker families, and after attending a preparatory school in Croydon David was sent to Leighton Park, a Quaker school in Reading. He was an undistinguished scholar, but the school's liberal regime allowed him to pursue his enthusiasm for photography and overlooked his illicit visits to the local cinemas. At the age of nineteen he began work as a ledger clerk at Viney, Price, and Goodyear, where his father worked as a chartered accountant. It was obvious, however, that he had no aptitude for figures, and his father arranged for him to be taken on at the Shepherd's Bush studios of the Gaumont-British Picture Corporation.<h2>
<a name="Entryintothefilmworld"></a>Entry into the film world</h2>Protected by the <span class="roman">Cinematograph Films Act</span> of 1927, British film production was expanding rapidly, and Lean grasped the opportunity to gain experience as an assistant cameraman, assistant director, and&#151;after being demoted for accidentally exposing a series of close-ups of Madeleine Carroll to white light&#151;wardrobe assistant. It was as an editor, however, that he established his reputation. He adjusted more easily than many of his older colleagues to the coming of sound and the problems of synchronization it entailed, and was made editor of Gaumont Sound News in 1930. On 28 June 1930 he married his cousin Isabel Mayo Lean (<i>b</i>. 1907/8), daughter of Edmund Wylde Lean, chartered accountant; their son, Peter, was born in October.<br>
<br>Lean's career progressed rapidly. Early in 1931 he moved to British Movietone News, the most prestigious of the newsreel companies, and while there he supplemented his income by editing low-budget feature films, most notably <span class="italic">Money for Speed</span> (1933) and <span class="italic">The Ghost Camera</span> (1933), both of which were directed by Bernard Vorhaus. His marriage progressed less happily, and in August 1932 Lean left his wife and son.<br>
<br>Lean's speed in decision-making and his comprehensive memory for visual images made him an extremely good newsreel editor, but he was increasingly in demand as an editor of feature films. When Dr Paul Czinner was invited to Britain to make prestige films starring his wife, Elizabeth Bergner, Lean was recruited as editor. From a starting salary of 10<i>s</i>. a week at Gaumont-British he was able to command an unprecedented &pound;60 a week for cutting <span class="italic">As You Like It</span> (1936). After editing the last of the Czinner&#150;Bergner films, <span class="italic">Dreaming Lips</span> (1937), however, Lean, like many others, was thrown out of work by the disastrous slump which hit the industry. He had saved nothing during his years of plenty and was in a perilous financial situation.<br>
<br>Lean was helped through this crisis by his younger brother, Edward, then a reporter on the <span class="italic">News Chronicle</span>, and the actress and dancer <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/95768/', "Kathleen (Kay) Walsh (1911&#150;2005)")</script>, daughter of James Walsh, an engineer, with whom he began a relationship in 1936. Lean edited <span class="italic">The Last Adventurers</span> (1937), a low-budget film about Grimsby trawlermen in which Walsh had a part, but his big break came when he was recommended to Gabriel Pascal, an expatriate Hungarian who had persuaded George Bernard Shaw to let him make a film adaptation of <span class="italic">Pygmalion</span>. The film was a big success, and Lean went on to work with the director, Anthony Asquith, on <span class="italic">French without Tears</span> (1939) and with the producer, Pascal, on <span class="italic">Major Barbara</span> (1940).<h2>
<a name="Director"></a>Director</h2>Lean, a dedicated and reliable craftsman whose advice was often sought when a film seemed to be in trouble, had been offered the chance to direct several times. However, he was wary of directing low-budget films where there was little opportunity for creative expression and the danger of being blamed for the shortcomings of a poorly developed script, skimpy sets, and miscast actors. On <span class="italic">Major Barbara</span> Pascal's inexperience led Lean and the &#145;dialogue director&#146; Harold French to direct much of the film themselves. With this experience behind him, Lean felt able to accept Noel Coward's offer to help in the direction of <span class="italic">In which we Serve</span> (1942), a prestigious naval drama based on the experiences of Earl Mountbatten as the commander of a destroyer, and to insist on being credited as co-director.<br>
<br>Coward and Lean worked well together, and Coward (who had written the script and was playing the leading role) was increasingly content to leave directorial duties to Lean. <span class="italic">In which we Serve</span> went on to become a critical success and the most popular British film of the war years. Coward encouraged Lean to form a production company, Cineguild, with the film's producer, Anthony Havelock-Allan, and cinematographer, Ronald Neame. Three very different Coward adaptations followed: <span class="italic">This Happy Breed</span> (1944), <span class="italic">Blithe Spirit</span> (1945), and <span class="italic">Brief Encounter</span> (1945). <span class="italic">This Happy Breed</span>, which follows the fortunes of a typical English lower-middle-class family between the wars, was another huge commercial success; but it was the much smaller-scale <span class="italic">Brief Encounter</span>, a success only in what the film trade termed &#145;the better-class halls&#146;, which established Lean's international reputation as a director. At the time, critics praised it for its realism, and for the emotional honesty of its portrayal of an unconsummated love affair between two married, middle-class, middle-aged people. But in retrospect its expressive use of Rachmaninov's second piano concerto, its <i>noir</i>-ish lighting, and its convoluted use of flashbacks look typical of a romantic stylization which became characteristic of Lean's films.<br>
<br>The ending of <span class="italic">Brief Encounter</span> sees the triumph of duty and conformity over romantic self-expression, but for both Lean and Coward the film was fuelled by creative empathy rather than personal experience. Unlike Laura and Alex, Lean repeatedly broke out of his commitments to begin a new life with a new love. According to Ronald Neame, &#145;David always had a girl on any film he worked on&#146;  (Brownlow, 213). In August 1936 Lean had been divorced by his wife, Isabel, and on 23 November 1940 he married Kay Walsh, but this marriage survived only because she was prepared to overlook his persistent infidelity. In 1946 he left her for the costume designer Margaret Furse, although they continued to have a fruitful working relationship, Walsh writing the conciliatory ending of <span class="italic">Great Expectations</span> (1946) and the dramatic opening of <span class="italic">Oliver Twist</span> (1948).<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">Great Expectations</span>, the first film Lean made without Noel Coward, was rapturously received: Richard Winnington in the <span class="italic">News Chronicle</span> asked his readers &#145;to pay attention to the first big British film to have been made, a film that confidently sweeps our cloistered virtues into the open&#146;. There was a degree of disappointment, however, when Lean chose to follow up his success with another Dickens adaptation, and although <span class="italic">Oliver Twist</span> was popular in Britain, in the USA it became caught up in the political wrangles over Britain's handling of the Palestine mandate and was boycotted by Jewish groups objecting to Alec Guinness's portrayal of Fagin.<br>
<br>Cineguild shared in the declining fortunes of the British film industry in the late 1940s, and Lean's next two films, <span class="italic">The Passionate Friends</span> (1949) and <span class="italic">Madeleine</span> (1950), were both commercial failures. Both films starred <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/53374/', "Ann Todd (1907&#150;1993)")</script>, who, following international success in a modestly budgeted melodrama, <span class="italic">The Seventh Veil</span> (1945), had been invited to Hollywood to star in Alfred Hitchcock's <span class="italic">The Paradine Case</span> (1948). Lean, who had taken over the directing of <span class="italic">The Passionate Friends</span> from Ronald Neame, found it difficult to work with an actress who regarded herself as a star, but during location shooting at Lake Annecy they fell in love. After Lean was divorced by Kay Walsh and Todd by her husband, Nigel Tangye (Lean's second cousin), they married on 21 May 1949.<br>
<br>Apart from <span class="italic">Ryan's Daughter</span>, <span class="italic">The Passionate Friends</span> and <span class="italic">Madeleine</span> are Lean's most under-rated films probably because they are unabashed melodramas which concentrate on the psychology and dilemmas of their heroine in a way which was untypical of British cinema at the time. Celia Johnson's Laura Jessop in <span class="italic">Brief Encounter</span> could be seen as an ordinary woman (if only by upper-middle-class film critics); Mary Justin and Madeleine Smith are disturbingly unusual women and manifestations of Ann Todd's star persona. A third film with Todd followed, <span class="italic">The Sound Barrier</span> (1952), but this is much less of a melodrama, and her role, important though it is, is as part of an ensemble rather than as a star. The film's setting in the brave new world of British aviation helped to make it a commercial success, but Lean's relationship with his third wife was severely strained. Henceforth they pursued their careers separately.<br>
<br>Cineguild's films had all been made for J. Arthur Rank, but when Rank cut back on production budgets in response to the adverse financial conditions at the end of the 1940s, Cineguild was dissolved, and Lean made <span class="italic">The Sound Barrier</span> and his next film, <span class="italic">Hobson's Choice</span> (1953), for Alexander Korda. It was Korda who initiated the next phase in Lean's career by sending him to India to research for a film about the Taj Mahal. Lean was enchanted by India, stayed a month, and began a romance with an unhappily married Indian woman, Leila Matkar (<i>d</i>. 1998). The Taj Mahal film never materialized, and instead Lean went to Venice to make <span class="italic">Summer Madness</span> (1954), an Anglo-American co-production between Korda and United Artists starring Katharine Hepburn. Ann Todd stayed in London playing Lady Macbeth at the Old Vic.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">Summer Madness</span>, Lean's favourite film, marked a shift in his style of film-making. It was his first film aimed at an international audience and his first film shot on location. Hitherto, apart from excursions for exterior shots (such as Carnforth station in <span class="italic">Brief Encounter</span> and Lake Annecy in <span class="italic">The Passionate Friends</span>), Lean's films, with their chiaroscuro lighting and meticulously prepared sets, were very much a product of the studio system in which he had served his apprenticeship. With <span class="italic">Summer Madness</span>, Lean discovered that, given a big enough budget and a dedicated camera and set design team, he could mould the external world to his vision. Quintessentially English though he was, he also found that he enjoyed living abroad. His wanderlust was enhanced when, after separating from Ann Todd, he was told that he would be liable for the tax debts of her company, Glendorgal, were he to stay in England. After the premi&egrave;re of <span class="italic">Summer Madness</span> in May 1955 he began an exile from Britain which lasted for thirty years.<br>
<br>Lean returned to India, where he was reunited with Leila Matkar, and worked with Richard Mason on an adaptation of his novel <span class="italic">The Wind Cannot Read</span>, a wartime romance between an RAF officer and a Japanese woman set in India and Burma. Unfortunately, Korda thought the script unacceptably sentimental and refused to finance the film. The script then passed to Betty Box and Ralph Thomas, who made the film for the Rank organization in 1958. By this time Lean had made an adaptation of Pierre Boulle's best-selling novel <span class="italic">The Bridge on the River Kwai</span> for the American producer Sam Spiegel. Boule's critique of the British military ethos was very different from the subdued, respectful heroism of British war films like <span class="italic">The Cruel Sea</span> and <span class="italic">The Dam Busters</span>, and Lean quickly fell out with Carl Foreman, the exiled American writer whom Spiegel had commissioned to write the script. As Lean told Spiegel:<blockquote>The subject is pretty tricky at the best of times. If it misses it will be a bad miss. To put it over, one has to have a real understanding of the British mentality or it will be offensive. Mr Foreman hasn't got the first glimmer and he is offensive. (Brownlow, 350)</blockquote>Foreman was replaced with another blacklisted American writer, Michael Wilson, with whom Lean forged a much better relationship. Nevertheless, in the harsh conditions of location filming in the jungles of Ceylon, Lean encountered a degree of hostility from his cast and crew, who assumed he was making an anti-British film. In fact, with the sympathetic performance of Alec Guinness and the clever use of the popular band tune &#145;Colonel Bogey&#146; Lean maintained a delicate balance between criticizing and celebrating British courage and intransigence. The film was internationally successful, and in 1958 won several American academy awards, including that for best director. Lean was inundated with offers to make films in Hollywood, but he preferred to maintain his independence, and began a collaboration with Emeric Pressburger on a film about Gandhi, which was to star Alec Guinness. The resulting script, however, was a disappointment, and Lean and Spiegel switched to a film about T. E. Lawrence.<h2>
<a name="LawrenceofArabiaandafter"></a>Lawrence of Arabia and after</h2>Attempts to make a film about Lawrence's exploits in Arabia went back to the 1930s, when Korda had attempted to persuade Lawrence to allow Leslie Howard to play him in a film to be directed by Lewis Milestone. Lawrence was killed in a motorcycle crash in 1935, and all subsequent attempts to make a film about him had been thwarted by his brother and literary executor, Professor A. W. Lawrence. Spiegel's charm and money, Lean's impressive record of film-making, and a thoughtful analytical treatment written by Michael Wilson now persuaded the professor to allow a film to go ahead. The film's gestation period was a troubled one, with the playwright Robert Bolt eventually replacing Wilson as writer and Peter O'Toole playing the role for which actors as various as Marlon Brando and Albert Finney had been proposed. After four months' shooting in the Jordanian desert, Spiegel forced Lean to suspend production, and the remaining sequences were shot in Spain and Morocco, Seville standing in for Cairo, Jerusalem, and Damascus. Lean shared Lawrence's passion for the desert, and his experience of shooting the film was enriched by his harmonious relationship with the cinematographer, Freddie Young, and his romantic involvement with the New Zealand-born Barbara Cole, who handled continuity on the film. Ann Todd had divorced Lean in July 1957, and in July 1960 he married Leila Matkar. But it was with Barbara Cole that he spent most of the next seven years.<br>
<br>Though <span class="italic">Lawrence of Arabia</span> (1962) had gone considerably over budget, its intelligent approach to a far-from-conventional hero and the visual splendour of the desert imagery made it a genuine modern epic; the film was awarded seven American academy awards in 1962. The partnership between Lean and Spiegel had been severely strained by tensions over the shooting schedule for <span class="italic">Lawrence of Arabia</span>, and for his next film, an adaptation of Boris Pasternak's Nobel prize-winning novel <span class="italic">Doctor Zhivago</span>, Lean turned to a less intrusive producer, Carlo Ponti. The commercial success of his last two films had given Lean considerable power, and he was allowed to make a hugely expensive film (production lasted 232 days) with the two main parts filled by relatively unknown actors. Lean and his scriptwriter Robert Bolt resisted pressure from Ponti to cast his wife (Sophia Loren) in the part of Lara and instead chose Julie Christie. After considering Paul Newman, Max von Sydow, Burt Lancaster, and Peter O'Toole, Lean took a chance on Omar Sharif, the Egyptian actor who had made a strong impression as Sherif Ali in <span class="italic">Lawrence of Arabia</span>. When <span class="italic">Doctor Zhivago</span> opened in New York in December 1965 press reviews were mixed, some critics objecting to it as a shallow and sentimental rendering of Pasternak's novel. But after the first few days public reaction shifted decisively in the film's favour. It was nominated for ten American academy awards, winning five, and became an international box-office success. <span class="italic">Doctor Zhivago</span> made Lean rich and allowed him virtual carte blanche to make what he wanted. He had also decided to make a permanent break with Leila and settle down with Barbara Cole, but in November 1966, while he was in India for the release of <span class="italic">Doctor Zhivago</span>, he met and fell in love with Sandra Hotz, a twenty-year-old Swiss South African whose family owned the Laurie Hotel in Agra, which Lean had patronized regularly since his first visit to India in 1954. They lived together for the next nineteen years, though for twelve of them Lean remained married to Leila.<br>
<br>Rejecting Bolt's attempt at the Gandhi project and his idea of adapting <span class="italic">Madame Bovary</span>, Lean encouraged him to write an original story which would transpose Flaubert's account of a woman's tragic search for sexual self-expression in a repressive society from nineteenth-century France to somewhere with more dramatic potential. Bolt responded with <span class="italic">Ryan's Daughter</span>, set in a remote Irish village shortly after the Easter rising of 1916. Lean had been angered by the accusations that he had lost the ability to make small-scale, intimate films, and planned to shoot it in ten weeks. With the production plagued by the weather on the Dingle peninsula in the far south-west of Ireland, the costs escalated rapidly, and when the film was finally completed it was dismissed by most critics as an overblown and old-fashioned melodrama. Lean, unused to such critical mauling, was bitterly upset, and it was fourteen years before he made another film. The film's length (over three hours), the seeming flimsiness of the story, and the odd casting of Robert Mitchum as the gentle, flower-loving cuckolded husband combined with the film's poor critical reception to alienate audiences. With hindsight, <span class="italic">Ryan's Daughter</span>, with its beautifully judged performances, spectacular imagery, and boldly sympathetic focus on female sexuality, can be judged less harshly, but it was out of time with a new mood in film-making which stressed fast pace, urban environments, and a much cheaper and more improvisatory style of film-making.<h2>
<a name="Finalyears"></a>Final years</h2>Lean's absence from film-making was not something he intended, and over the next fourteen years he was involved in a number of interesting projects&#151;most notably a lavish two-part dramatization of the events surrounding the mutiny on the <i>Bounty</i>&#151;which failed to come to fruition. After a long sojourn on the South Sea islands of Tahiti and Bora Bora, he returned to London in June 1981 and was approached by Lord Brabourne to direct <span class="italic">A Passage to India</span>. Lean agreed but insisted on writing his own script, which departed significantly from E. M. Forster's novel in the more sympathetic role allotted to its female protagonist, Miss Quested. Though Lean faced the usual accusations of extravagance during the shooting of the film, it was generally well received both in Britain and in the USA when it was released in December 1984.<br>
<br>In 1983 Lean had received one of the first British Film Institute fellowships. In June 1984 he was knighted. In 1990 he received an American Film Institute lifetime achievement award. Amid these honours, however, Lean's personal life remained turbulent. In August 1978 he was finally divorced from Leila, and in October 1981 he married Sandra Hotz. In November 1985 the couple were divorced, and in December 1990 Lean married Sandra Cooke, an art dealer, with whom he had been living since 1985. Shortly after the wedding Lean was diagnosed with throat cancer. He responded well to radiotherapy, but in February 1991 he developed pneumonia, and he died at his home at Sun Wharf, 30 Narrow Street, Limehouse, London, on 16 April. He was buried at Putney Vale crematorium on 22 April. A memorial service was held at St Paul's Cathedral on 3 October 1991.<br>
<br>Lean's thorough apprenticeship gave him a confidence in his own abilities which made it possible for him to handle large-scale productions without being panicked into rushed decisions. He was prepared to accept the embarrassment of having large numbers of people standing idle while he made his mind up because he was convinced that there was only one way to film a sequence and that even the most rigorous pre-planning could not always predict what that best way was.<br>
<br>Lean's Quaker background, though it failed to implant in him deep religious beliefs, gave him an austere seriousness which made him impatient of the sybaritic lifestyle favoured by many people in the film industry. Though his early success accustomed him to wealth and luxury and he was always immaculately and expensively dressed, he seemed happiest among the hardships of location filming. He was a handsome man who liked and was liked by women, and he regarded a satisfying sexual relationship as a priority.<br>
<br>Though there is still a tendency to judge Lean's modest English black and white films as superior to his lavish epics, the intelligence, flair, and visual splendour of the latter were what made him an internationally renowned director, and their achievements have proved difficult to emulate.<br>
