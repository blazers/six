<span class="headword">Campbell,  John</span>  (<em>c.</em>1703&#150;1777), <span class="occ">banker and businessman</span>, was held by contemporaries to be an illegitimate son of Colin Campbell of Ardmaddy, younger son of the first earl of Breadalbane (1634&#150;1717). Later testimonies suggest that Colin Campbell married Grizel Douglas against the earl's wishes, and that all evidence of this legal marriage was later destroyed, and with it, the claim of John Campbell's descendants to the earldom. After his father's death, John was raised in the Breadalbane household at Finlarig in the Perthshire highlands. In 1718 he was apprenticed to Colin Kirk, writer to the signet, for three years.<br>
<br>In 1727, through the influence of John, second earl of Breadalbane, Campbell joined the newly established Royal Bank of Scotland in Edinburgh, where he began in the accountant's office. He was appointed assistant secretary in 1732 and second cashier in 1734, succeeding to the post of chief cashier in July 1745, the office he was to hold throughout his banking career. On the approach of Charles Edward Stuart's highland army in September 1745, the bank, under its deputy governor, Lord Milton, a pillar of the Hanoverian establishment in Scotland, sent its reserves of specie and banknotes to Edinburgh Castle to keep them out of Jacobite hands. However, after Edinburgh was taken and Charles Edward Stuart secured his victory at the battle of Prestonpans, a large number of Royal Bank of Scotland notes&#151;many from Glasgow&#151;came into the possession of the prince's staff. His secretary, John Murray of Broughton, presented these to the bank and demanded that Campbell exchange them for guineas, if necessary by bringing the reserves down from the castle. If this were not done, said Murray, the houses of bank directors and officials would be &#145;distressed&#146;.<br>
<br>By now Lord Milton and most of the bank's directors had fled, and Campbell and the two remaining directors, without much demur, agreed to Murray's demand. Although the castle was by now under siege by the highland army, they succeeded in gaining entrance to it, and informed Lieutenant-General Guest and General Preston, the castle's deputy governor, that they wanted access to the bank reserves deposited there, as Campbell put it, &#145;to do some business&#146;. He and his party then brought down from the castle the reserves of specie and, that evening, exchanged over &pound;3000 of coin for banknotes with Murray's representative. As Royal Bank of Scotland notes came into Jacobite hands in the remaining weeks of Jacobite occupation of Edinburgh, similar transactions more than doubled the amount exchanged, to &pound;6700. It was a considerable help to the highland army, as it prepared for the invasion of England, to have all this added to its war chest.<br>
<br>The seemingly weak-kneed response to Murray's demands and the apparent hoodwinking of General Preston raise questions about the motives of Campbell and his colleagues, so obviously at variance with the wishes of Lord Milton; it is also inconceivable that General Preston, resolute Hanoverian that he was, would have allowed the Royal Bank's reserves to leave the castle, had he known their ultimate destination. Perhaps Campbell was Jacobite at heart. The Breadalbane Campbells, unlike the Argyll Campbells, had been strongly Jacobite in the rising of 1715, though in 1745 Lord Glenorchy, the second earl's heir, was a determined whig. It may have been that Campbell, in the absence of Lord Milton, was responding to the wishes of the aged second earl, his uncle, the clan chief, and an erstwhile Jacobite, who remained at Holyroodhouse throughout the six weeks of the occupation, and whose Hanoverian loyalties were suspect.<br>
<br>Curiously, when Hanoverian rule returned to Edinburgh in November 1745, though Lord Milton made clear his disapproval of what had been done, there were no active recriminations by him against Campbell and his directors. It may have been that the risk of embarrassment to the Royal Bank, to Lord Milton himself, and possibly to the second earl of Breadalbane was considered too great to allow disclosure. Campbell seems to have maintained the view that he had done nothing more than he was legally obliged to do. (A contrary view would be to question whether Murray in treasonable defiance of King George's rule could claim the protection of his laws.)<br>
<br>In 1728 Campbell had married Jean Kirk (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Stirling), a widow, who died in 1739. Campbell's second marriage took place in Edinburgh in the early part of 1751, to Anna Caroline, eldest daughter of James Campbell of Tofts, and they had seven sons and eight daughters. His second son, Colin, fought in the American War of Independence and became governor of Gibraltar. Initially Campbell resided in Newbank House, which belonged to the bank, in Newbank Close, off the High Street; later he moved to Restalrig, outside the city. After his second marriage, he moved to a more fashionable area, acquiring a house in the Citadel, Leith. Duncan B&agrave;n Macintyre, himself something of a Jacobite, composed, probably in the 1760s, a long eulogy in Gaelic verse in Campbell's honour, extolling his demeanour, hospitality, and attachment to all things highland. A portrait of 1749, in the possession of the Royal Bank of Scotland, shows him (despite the recent prohibition of the wearing of tartan) in highland dress and fully armed.<br>
<br>Although he held a position of power and influence in the Royal Bank, Campbell's duties were not full-time. He acted as the Scottish representative of the Equivalent Company, which had close links with the bank, and had been set up in 1724 to dispense the pecuniary &#145;equivalent&#146; paid to Scotland after the <span class="roman">Act of Union</span>. He acted as agent to the second earl of Breadalbane and his son, Lord Glenorchy, and for other highland gentry, keeping their personal accounts, and performing business and personal service for them in Edinburgh. He was a partner in the Marble and Slate Company of Netherlorn, and was involved in the management of a coalmining company and the Edinburgh Sugar House.<br>
<br>John Campbell's long reign at the Royal Bank coincided with the years of vigorous expansion, during which the Scottish banking system became the most developed in Europe. He died at Edinburgh in January 1777. <span class="italic">The Diary of John Campbell: a Scottish Banker and the Forty-Five</span> published by the Royal Bank of Scotland in 1995 reproduces Campbell's diary in full for the crucial months of 1745. Long excerpts from the diary for these months had been published without much accompanying comment in the <span class="italic">Miscellany of the Scottish History Society</span> (1893) but little attention was paid to their implication, least of all by Neil Munro in his <span class="italic">History of the Royal Bank of Scotland, 1727&#150;1927</span>, though Walter Biggar Blaikie, in his article on Prince Charles Edward Stuart in the <span class="italic">Book of the Old Edinburgh Club</span> for 1909, did raise an eyebrow at Campbell's &#145;grotesque&#146; action.<br>
