<span class="headword">Tattersall family</span>  (<em>per. </em><em>c.</em>1765&#150;<em>c.</em>1940), <span class="occ">bloodstock auctioneers</span>, created one of Britain's greatest bloodstock auction houses, which, still existent after more than two centuries, remained in family control for more than 175 years. <a name="cosubject_26996"></a><span class="headword">Richard [i] Tattersall</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1725, <em>d.</em> 1795)<span class="occ"></span>, founder of the firm, was the second son of Edmund [i] Tattersall (1686&#150;1764), a Lancastrian farmer, and his wife, Ann Varley of Laund. He was born in the hamlet of Hurstwood, near Burnley and baptized at Burnley on 5 June 1725. Between 1730 and 1740 he was educated at Burnley grammar school, before being apprenticed to a wool-stapling friend of his father. In 1745 he opted to go to London, where he became head ostler at Beevor's Repository in St Martin's Lane. From there he moved to become stud-groom, and later possibly master of horse, for Evelyn Pierrepoint, second duke of Kingston.<br>
<br>By 1766 Richard had accumulated sufficient funds to purchase a ninety-nine-year lease of property at Hyde Park Corner from Lord Grosvenor, where he set up as a horse and hound auctioneer. The business boomed, partly because of his reputation for integrity but also through his cultivation of potential clients with dinners and other hospitality; clients included members of the Jockey Club and the French royal family. In 1780 he added subscription rooms which became the site for the making and settling of bets by the higher echelons of the racing fraternity. He also ventured into thoroughbred horse ownership, most spectacularly in 1779 with the purchase for &pound;2500 from Lord Bolingbroke of the unbeaten Highflyer, whose successful career at stud&#150;he was champion sire twelve times&#150;earned Richard far more than the outlay from both stud fees and commission on the sales of his offspring. Some of this money went towards the purchase and redevelopment of New Barns, a country house near Ely which he renamed Highflyer Hall. There he entertained Charles Fox, William Windham, and the prince of Wales, whose stud Tattersall sold in July 1786. Apart from a loss-making move into proprietorship of the <span class="italic">Morning Post</span> between 1783 and 1792, Richard or Old Tatt as he was known in later years, proved to be an astute businessman and took Tattersalls to a commanding position among British bloodstock auctioneers.<br>
<br>In 1756 Richard married Catherine Somerville, a granddaughter of the twelfth earl of Somerville, who in 1758 gave birth to their only son, Edmund [ii]. By 1784 the firm was advertising itself as Tattersall &amp; son, and two years before his death, at his Hyde Park home on 21 February 1795, Richard had begun the process of transferring the control of the firm to Edmund [ii]. Most of his wealth was left to the younger Edmund, but 200 guineas and an annuity of &pound;50 went to Richard's servant Sarah Povey as well as sums of between &pound;500 and &pound;2000 to her five children. The size of these legacies has led to a suspicion that some of the children, particular the one named Richard [ii] Tattersall, were fathered by Old Tatt himself; Richard [i] was buried in St George's, Hanover Square, London. Far more cultured than his father, thanks to extensive continental tours, Edmund [ii] (1758&#150;1810), a man of good looks and charming manner, was more interested in hunting than auctioneering, though he had a solid grounding in, and understanding of, the family business. Perhaps his wisest decision was to bring his own son, <a href="#cosubject_66375">Richard [iii] [<i>see below</i>]</a> into partnership in 1806. Although he did not share his father's appetite for money making, the death of Edmund [ii], diagnosed as being from brain fever, on 23 January 1810, left his wife, Elizabeth Wilshin (<i>d</i>. 1843), a wealthy widow; she survived him by thirty-three years.<br>
<br>Of Edmund and Elizabeth's children, little is known of the daughter, Elizabeth; the youngest son, George [i] (1792&#150;1853), managed the firm's stud farm at Dawley, near Uxbridge, after getting into financial difficulties as a farmer in Norfolk. He married Eliza Reeve of Wighton, Norfolk; they had three children, including Edmund [iv] (1816&#150;1898). The second son, Edmund [iii] (1789&#150;1851), a lifelong bachelor, was a partner in the family firm for over forty years but never played a prominent role. The eldest son, <a name="cosubject_66375"></a><span class="headword">Richard [iii] Tattersall</span>  (1785&#150;1859)<span class="occ"></span>, took command on his father's death and under his direction within a decade the firm became a leader in the world of bloodstock auctioneering, with sales to the continent increasing and the development of annual yearling sales for some of the major studs. Old Dick, as he was known to distinguish himself from his son Richard [iv], was responsible for the expansion of the firm's activities to include sales at Doncaster and Hampton Court. Although he disapproved of heavy gambling&#151;a deeply religious man, he never bet himself&#151;in 1815 he opened new subscription rooms at The Corner where gambling debts could be settled. He was married to Mary Grace Robson, though the date of marriage is unknown. Following complaints of drowsiness and constant headaches, Old Dick died when on holiday at Dover on 22 July 1859.<br>
<br>The business was taken over by Old Dick's elder son, Richard [iv] Tattersall (1812&#150;1870), known as Richard the younger, who had been a partner since 1840. Under his stewardship the firm moved to Albert Gate at Knightsbridge following the expiration of the Hyde Park Corner lease in 1865. At the end of the 1860s he was instrumental in bringing in the first non-family partner, Thomas Pain, who developed a market for hunters and hounds in the midland shires. His last four years of life were painful, with heart problems and swellings in his legs&#151;he had been lamed as a child&#151;and he died on 3 May 1870. Old Dick's younger son, <a name="cosubject_26995"></a><span class="headword">George [ii] Tattersall</span>  (1817&#150;1849), <span class="occ">artist and architect</span>, better known under the pseudonym Wildrake, was born at Hyde Park Corner on 13 June 1817 and baptized on 9 July at St James's, Westminster. He did not enter the family business, instead achieving moderate fame as an artist, publishing engravings of racehorses and illustrating Nimrod's <span class="italic">Hunting Reminiscences</span>. As an architect based at 52 Pall Mall, London, he specialized in stables, kennels, and other sporting buildings, and was responsible for rebuilding the stables at Willesden, Essex, the new location of the Tattersalls stud farm. For a brief period in the mid-1840s he also edited the <span class="italic">Sporting Magazine</span> and the <span class="italic">New Sporting Almanack</span>. Shortly after a visit to the United States he married, in 1837, Helen Pritchard; they had four children. He died of brain fever at his home in Cadogan Place, London, in 1849.<br>
<br>Richard Tattersall the younger's marriage was childless and control of the firm fell to his cousin Edmund [iv], son of George [i] Tattersall and Eliza Reeve. Born at his father's farm at Sculthorpe, Norfolk, Edmund was educated at Henley and Guildford grammar schools. He set himself up as an independent horse auctioneer at Newmarket before being offered a partnership in the family firm in 1851. On 3 September 1862 he married Emily Elizabeth Byers; they had at least four sons including <a href="#cosubject_66376">Edmund Somerville Tattersall [<i>see below</i>]</a>. Following attendance at a cold and wet Houghton meeting at Newmarket, Edmund took ill and never again left his home at Coleherne Court, South Kensington, in the eighteen months before his death on 5 March 1898.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_66376"></a><span class="headword">Edmund Somerville Tattersall</span>  (1863&#150;1942)<span class="occ"></span>, eldest son of Edmund [iv], then became the last Tattersall to direct the firm, in a year when Tattersalls was responsible for 72 per cent of all blood stock sold at auction in England. Born on 12 August 1863, Sommy, as he was known, was educated at Eton College and later at an academy at Vevey on Lake Geneva. Fluent in French and German, as a young man he pursued skiing and mountaineering, but his passion was music, so much so that in 1904 he took a flat at 34 Rutland Gate so as to be nearer the Albert Hall. He became a partner in Tattersalls in 1885 and was later assisted by his younger brothers, Harry George (partner 1891) and Rupert Reeve (partner 1901). The former, fond of drink and careless with money, resigned from the firm in 1905 after a quarrel with Edmund Somerville, a man with a strict sense of decorum; Rupert lost a leg in the First World War and retired from the firm in 1919. A third brother, Richard Brooke, was not taken into partnership but sent to America to establish a branch of the business there, but he proved ineffective and died in comparative poverty in New Orleans. By the outbreak of the Second World War much of the auctioneering and direction of the firm had passed to non-family members and when the unmarried Edmund Somerville died on 26 October 1942, after a series of small strokes, dynastic control of the great auction house ended. During the second half of the century and into the twenty-first, Tattersalls has remained one of Britain's, and Europe's, leading firms of bloodstock auctioneers. The name Tattersalls also continues to be used at most British racecourses for the enclosure next to the members' enclosure. It is also widely applied to a check material used primarily as shirting in men's and women's &#145;country&#146; clothes.<br>
