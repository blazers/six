<span class="headword">Fenwick family</span>  (<em>per. </em>1882&#150;1979), <span class="occ">department store owners</span>, came to prominence with <a name="cosubject_46991"></a><span class="headword">John James Fenwick</span>  (1846&#150;1905), <span class="occ">department store founder and fashion designer</span>. Born on 31 July 1846 at 83 Frenchgate, Richmond, in the North Riding of Yorkshire, J. J. Fenwick was the fifth of the eleven children (two of whom died in infancy) of John Fenwick (1810&#150;1886), grocer, and his wife, Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Cooper (1812&#150;1860), daughter of a farmer from Grinton, near Reeth, in Swaledale. He was brought up by his Fenwick grandparents on their farm at Feldom, near Marske, in Swaledale, moving back to Richmond in 1857 after the death of his grandmother. He attended the corporation school in Tower Street, Richmond, until he was fifteen, and then worked for his father for a time. He may have worked for a draper in Middlesbrough when his father moved there, and then served a seven-year apprenticeship with a draper in Stockton. In 1868 he moved to Newcastle upon Tyne, where he got a job as a shop assistant with Moses and Brown, a drapery business in Mosley Street, and in the following year he moved to Charles Bragg &amp; Co., silk mercers, of Pilgrim Street, where he worked his way up to be a buyer, and then manager.<br>
<br>In 1872 Fenwick married Mary Hannah, eldest daughter of Robert Burnand, master tailor, of Newcastle; they had three sons and one daughter. While working for Braggs he began selling insurance, but he turned down the offer of a full-time job as Newcastle representative of the National Provident Institution of Gracechurch Street, London, in 1877. In 1882 he was dismissed by Braggs for running an insurance agency on the side, but he issued a writ for wrongful dismissal, and the &pound;1000 he was awarded in settlement in 1882 helped to finance the expansion of the mantle business he had opened four months earlier at 5 Northumberland Street.<br>
<br>Northumberland Street at that time was an exclusive residential street, and from the start, Fenwicks was exclusive. J. J. Fenwick advertised under the heading &#145;Nouveaut&eacute;s Exclusives&#146;, and by the end of the first year his clientele included the Percys at Alnwick and other society ladies. By 1903 the <span class="italic">Newcastle Journal</span> was able to list 174 &#145;Society Patrons&#146; of the business, including the empress of Germany and three European princesses. With such a clientele, Fenwicks's stock included furs, hunting jackets, silk dresses, walking gowns, and sealskin jackets. In 1883 Fenwick was able to lease 39 Northumberland Street, and in 1885 acquired no. 37, and employed a well-known local architect, W. H. Knowles, to design a shop front with two large display windows, each supported by seven pillars with the fluting picked out in gold leaf, in which he displayed elegant gowns and furs. Meanwhile Fenwick was travelling to London and Paris to keep abreast of the new fashions and materials, and in 1887 he made his first trip to the French riviera to display his latest creations to ladies spending the winter there. He opened a shop in Sunderland in 1888, but this was not a success and closed within a year. Meanwhile he continued to acquire properties in Northumberland Street, preferring to run a number of separate shops rather than create one store with several departments, as E. M. Bainbridge had done nearly fifty years earlier in Market Street. In 1889 he opened the International Fur Store at 18 Northumberland Street (he changed its name to the Northern Fur Shop following objections from Jays of Regent Street), moving it into no. 2 a year later. In 1890 Fenwick was appointed northern agent for Liberty of London, and he bought 41 Northumberland Street to stock Liberty fabrics, calling it the Eastern Art Store&#151;this lasted a year, before he sold the property and moved the fabrics into nos. 37&#150;9.<br>
<br>In 1891 Fenwick opened a store in London, at 62&#150;3 New Bond Street and 15&#150;17 Brook Street, selling model gowns, coats, mantles, and furs, which was not very successful at first, but meanwhile his reputation as a fashion designer was growing, and, increasingly compared to the famous French fashion designers, he became known as the Worth of the North. He designed clothes for Ellen Terry, and in 1895 Dorothea Baird, who was to star in Gerald du Maurier's successful musical <span class="italic">Trilby</span> at the Haymarket Theatre, asked Fenwick to design her a gown to wear on the first night, when she was to be presented to the prince and princess of Wales. In the 1890s Fenwick began creating designs based on early nineteenth-century fashion plates, and he became notorious for his &#145;carriage gown&#146;, with a full skirt and a steel-wired hem, based on a design of the 1830s, which led to the formation of the Anti-Crinoline League, with 16,000 signatures. His &#145;short cut walking skirt for women&#146;, which exposed the ankles, caused another outcry: Fenwick named it &#145;the Anti-Microbe Skirt&#146;, a reference to Pasteur, who had died in 1895.<br>
<br>The business became a limited company in 1897 and in that year, after the purchase of more adjoining buildings, several houses were demolished and Knowles designed a new Newcastle store on the lines of Bon March&eacute; in Paris, with a central fashion hall with Ionic columns and stained glass windows. Fenwicks, while remaining an exclusive fashion store, was turning into a department store, and by 1900 there were 200 employees in Newcastle. But it remained a family business: all the shares were held by members of the family, and the Fenwicks trade mark was based on J. J. Fenwick's signature until 1962.<br>
<br>A Wesleyan Methodist, Fenwick was a leading officer of the Brunswick Place Chapel, and superintendent of the Orphan House Sunday schools. He and Thomas Hudson Bainbridge, eldest son of E. M. Bainbridge, financed the building of a new Methodist church in Jesmond, the Newcastle suburb where they lived, and they became joint superintendents of its Sunday school. A keen lawn tennis player, Fenwick was a member of the Avenues Tennis Club, the first lawn tennis club in the north of England.<br>
<br>Fenwick died of a heart attack at his home, Elderhurst, in Jesmond, Newcastle, on 9 July 1905, and was buried in Jesmond old cemetery.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_56184"></a><span class="headword">Frederick Burnand <span class="st"> [Fred]</span> Fenwick</span>  (1874&#150;1961)<span class="occ"></span>, the eldest son of John James and Mary Fenwick, was born on 26 June 1874 at 47 Alexandra Place, Newcastle upon Tyne, and educated at the Leys School, Cambridge. He left school at sixteen to serve a six-month apprenticeship in Paris with E. Meyer et Cie, suppliers of fine materials to leading fashion houses, before starting work in his father's Newcastle store at 2<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>. a week. He became a director in 1897. In 1899 he married Margaret Leyson Beavan, and they had two sons and three daughters; their youngest daughter, Pamela Ann (<i>b</i>. 1913/14), married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/56164/', "George Vivian MuschampBainbridge (1910&#150;1976)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/56163/', "Bainbridge, Emerson Muschamp")</script>], great-grandson of the founder of Bainbridge &amp; Co., in 1934, a marriage which made the links between the owners of the two leading department stores in the north-east even closer.<br>
<br>Fred Fenwick was impressed by the freedom with which customers were able to walk around the large Paris department stores such as Galeries Lafayette and Au Printemps, and by the Christmas bazaars held by these stores. In 1902 he persuaded his father to make the showrooms accessible to all classes, when the first grand Christmas bazaar was announced in the local newspapers, extending &#145;A welcome to customers to walk around the store. Assistants are not allowed to speak to visitors. Walk around today, don't buy. There is time for that another day&#146;  (<span class="italic">Newcastle Journal</span>, 27 Nov 1902). Always quick to take advantage of events that were in the news, in July 1909, after Bl&eacute;riot flew across the channel, Fenwick sent a telegram to the Newcastle press to announce that Fenwicks was preparing clothes for air travel.<br>
<br>After his father's death in 1905 Fred Fenwick became chairman of Fenwicks Ltd, and continued his father's policy of buying nearby properties in order to make room for expansion, both in Newcastle and London. In 1912 the showroom space in the Bond Street store was doubled, with a &#145;Louis XIV salon&#146; added, and in 1913 a new frontage for the Newcastle store was completed. By the mid-1920s the Newcastle store had fifty departments, but it continued to be an exclusive fashion house, with the emphasis on quality rather than quantity, and customers came from all over the north of England. There was further expansion in the 1930s, when Fenwicks bought the Townsend Galleries, a china and glass shop at 99&#150;105 Northumberland Street, and although Fenwick had wanted to sell the Bond Street leases in the 1920s, he later expanded the London business. In the 1930s he opened another shop at 179&#150;83 Regent Street, attracting customers such as the duchess of Kent, but it had to close soon afterwards.<br>
<br>Fenwick's public service included forty-one years on the committee of the Newcastle Dental Hospital, for which he was awarded an honorary MA by Durham University in 1945, and he was elected as an independent business candidate to Newcastle city council in 1923. At his death, in Newcastle, on 8 June 1961, he had worked in the family business for seventy-one years, including fifty-six years as chairman, and in the last week of his life he was still working, writing letters about extensions to the Bond Street store. The <span class="italic">Newcastle Journal</span> called him &#145;the man who made shopping a pleasure&#146;  (9 June 1961).<br>
<br>His younger brother, <a name="cosubject_56183"></a><span class="headword">Arthur James Fenwick</span>  (1878&#150;1957)<span class="occ"></span>, second of the three sons of J. J. Fenwick, was born at 8 Fern Avenue, Newcastle upon Tyne, on 14 August 1878. He was educated at New College, Eastbourne, before leaving school at fifteen to do a six-month apprenticeship with Meyer in Paris, like his elder brother. In Paris he worked in the Black department (selling funeral wear), and was particularly excited by the world of high fashion. Back in Newcastle, he began work as a junior in the stockroom, in charge of the whalebone used in making corsets. At first he was less interested in the business than his brother, and took up dog breeding, even starting his own kennels. But he was appointed to the board of directors at the age of twenty-one, and the fashion side of the business engaged his interest. It was he who was responsible for the development of the French Salon at the Newcastle store. In 1904 he married Ann Emily (Annie) Beavan, sister of his brother Fred's wife; they had one daughter. He was passionately interested in the circus, and was particularly associated with Bostock and Wombwell's Travelling Menagerie, which often visited Newcastle before it was dispersed in 1931. In 1944 he was made a life member of the Showmen's Guild of Great Britain. He died on 16 February 1957 at his home, 12 Brandling Park, Jesmond, and bequeathed his large collection of circus memorabilia to the Laing Art Gallery, which mounted an Arthur Fenwick Circus Exhibition in 1966.<br>
<br>The oldest child of Fred B. Fenwick, <a name="cosubject_56181"></a><span class="headword">(James Frederick) Trevor Fenwick</span>  (1901&#150;1979)<span class="occ"></span>, was born on 8 March 1901 at 31 Queens Road, Newcastle upon Tyne. He was educated at Uppingham School, and went up to Pembroke College, Cambridge, in 1919, to read economics, the first member of the family to go to university. He graduated BA in political economy in 1922. In 1931 he married Elizabeth Vere Meldrum of Pitlochry. They had three sons and one daughter; all the sons went into the family business, and became directors in the 1960s.<br>
<br>Trevor Fenwick was also interested in the fashion side of the business, and tried to show designs based on the latest Paris collections in Fenwicks within weeks of their being unveiled. He visited the United States in the 1930s, and came back with notebooks full of ideas from Macys and other New York stores. It was he who was responsible for turning the Bond Street store into a leading fashion house. In 1927 he started <span class="italic">Fenwick News</span>, a monthly in-house paper and an example of the firm's forward-looking employment policies.<br>
<br>During the Second World War Trevor Fenwick worked at the Ministry of Information in London, and later at the Ministry of Labour, and he also represented Jesmond ward on Newcastle city council from 1940 to 1951 as a Progressive Party member. Fenwick was chairman of Fenwicks Ltd from 1962 to 1972, when he was succeeded by his brother John (<i>b</i>. 1910), but he remained on the board of directors until 1978. He was chairman of the Retail Distributors' Association in 1955, and a member of the Consumer Council. He also chaired the Newcastle Medical Charities Fund, and played an important part in the formation of the Newcastle junior chamber of commerce.<br>
<br>Trevor Fenwick died on 1 January 1979 at Twyford Abbey, Ealing, London, only the third chairman of the family business, which continued to be run by members of the Fenwick family. His oldest son, J. J. Fenwick, who became chairman in 1979, stood aside in 1997 to make way for his nephew Mark Fenwick, while most other members of the family continued to join the business.<br>
