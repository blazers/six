<span class="headword">Seally,  John</span>  (1741/2&#150;1795), <span class="occ">writer</span>, born in Somerset, was educated at Bristol grammar school, with a view to ordination. He may possibly be identical with the John Sealy, son of John Sealy of Bridgwater, Somerset, who matriculated from Hertford College, Oxford, on 22 May 1760, aged eighteen, and graduated BA in 1764. The death of his uncle and patron obliged him to enter a solicitor's office, which he soon left to learn the business of a merchant under Malachy Postlethwayt. He so disliked his master's strictness, however, that, with some assistance from his mother, he took up authorship and journalism as a means of livelihood. During a visit to Manchester he persuaded a wealthy heiress to elope with him, but was overtaken by the father at Worcester. The lady is said to have died broken-hearted, and Seally consoled himself by marrying, in 1766, a reputedly rich widow of double his age, named Ann Soley Lewis (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1728), only to find, some years later, that she had no money and a husband (the Revd William Lewis) still living. In the meantime Seally sought occupation as a writing master and accountant. About 1767 he established a school in Bridgwater Square, Westminster, and after some years' successful tuition took holy orders. After his separation from Mrs Lewis, about 1773, he married Mary Ann, eldest daughter of Joseph Humphreys, rector of Ellisfield, Hampshire, and of North Stoke, Somerset, who survived him. In 1790 he was presented to the vicarage of East Meon with Froxfield and Steep, Hampshire.<br>
<br>Seally was elected fellow of the Royal Society on 30 June 1791. During a trip to Rome in 1774 he obtained admission to the Roman Academy (Arcadia) by a eulogy on Maria Maddelana Fernandez Corilla, poet laureate of Italy. He was also MA and LLD.<br>
<br>Seally contributed occasional verses to various magazines, projected a short-lived political paper signed &#145;Britannicus&#146;, conducted for some time the <span class="italic">Universal Museum</span> and the <span class="italic">Freeholder's Magazine</span>, and was involved in the <span class="italic">St James's Magazine</span>, edited by Robert Lloyd. He likewise published several novels, poems, and encyclopaedias, including: <span class="italic">The Loves of Calisto and Emira, or, The Fatal Legacy</span> (1776), of which a French translation was published, at Paris, in 1778; <span class="italic">Moral Tales, after the Eastern Manner</span> (1780?); <span class="italic">The Marriage of Sir Gawaine</span> (1782), an opera; <span class="italic">A Complete Geographical Dictionary</span> in two volumes (1787); and <span class="italic">The Lady's Encyclopedia</span> in three volumes (1788). Seally's career also involved producing educational books and handbooks such as: <span class="italic">The Accountant's Companion, or, Schoolmaster's New Assistant to Practical Arithmetic</span> (1770); <span class="italic">New Running Hand Copies, Designed for the Use of Schools</span> (1770?); and <span class="italic">A Specimen of Writing, in the Modern Ornamental Hands of Great Britain</span> (1794). Seally died in Queen Square, Westminster, in March 1795.<br>
