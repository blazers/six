<span class="headword">Fisher,  Samuel</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1604, <em>d.</em> 1665), <span class="occ">Quaker preacher and writer</span>, son of John Fisher, a hatter and later mayor of Northampton, was baptized in Northampton on 9 December 1604. He matriculated from Trinity College, Oxford, in 1623 and graduated BA in 1627. Ordained deacon by the bishop of Peterborough on 1 January 1628, he proceeded MA from New Inn Hall in November 1630 and was for a short period of time chaplain to Sir Arthur Hesilrige. On 25 March 1643 on the petition of the inhabitants he was presented by parliament as lecturer at Lydd, Kent. His wife's name was Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1657?) and their son Samuel was baptized in June 1643 at Rye and buried in October 1644 at Lydd without prayer book rites. By 1645 it appears that Fisher was appointed vicar of the parish of Lydd but before 1649 he resigned the vicarage (reputedly worth &pound;250 in 1647) to join the Baptists, with whom he had already shown sympathy; he supported himself, his wife, and two children by farming, and though apparently still living at Lydd he became pastor to a congregation at Ashford. Fisher was a noted disputant, engaging on 27 July 1649 with several other ministers at Ashford, on 10 September 1649 with Matthias Symson, in 1651 with Francis Cheynell at Petworth, in March 1651 with John Reading at Folkestone, and on at least six other occasions in the next two years. He was one of those who initiated the national association of General Baptist churches, and at their meeting in London in September 1654 was the first of thirteen &#145;Messengers&#146; to sign a manifesto approving civil government and disavowing the Fifth Monarchy movement. By that date he had already converted to Baptist views William Allen, a member of John Goodwin's church, who together with the merchant Thomas Lambe organized a major Baptist congregation in Lothbury.<br>
<br>After a meeting at Lydd with the Quakers William Caton and John Stubbs in March 1655, and shortly after with Ambrose Rigge and George Fox, Fisher joined the Society of Friends and soon became a &#145;publisher of truth&#146;. On 17 September 1656 Fisher attended the meeting of parliament, but was prevented from speaking. He subsequently attempted to address the members of parliament at a fast-day service in St Margaret's Church, Westminster, on 24 September. Throughout 1657 Stubbs tried to convince Fisher to carry a Quaker witness to Rome, Turkey, and the East but he was reluctant to do so, pleading the needs of his sick wife (whose recovery Stubbs in September 1657 doubted). Eventually in October 1657 Stubbs left London for the Netherlands, where after a few months Fisher joined him, and possibly collaborated with Spinoza on the translation of two works written by Margaret Fell. From the Netherlands Stubbs and Fisher set out for Rome on foot. During their journey they were received at Heidelberg by the elector palatine. In April 1658 they reached Venice, where they stayed for more than two months. Their activities did not pass unnoticed and between June and August 1658 the Inquisition in Venice interviewed those who had had contact with the two Quakers. They eventually set out for Rome in July. In Venice and Rome they preached to both Jews and Catholics.<br>
<br>In September 1658 Fisher was again in London, where he signed a paper addressed to Richard Cromwell in support of liberty of conscience. According to Besse he was &#145;much abused&#146; in Kent in 1658, and in February 1659 he was pulled out of a meeting at Westminster by his hair and severely beaten  (Besse, 1.289). In May he went with Edward Burrough to Dunkirk, where they preached to Catholics and English soldiers. Later that year Fisher was imprisoned in Newgate.<br>
<br>Fisher became as notable a disputant among the Quakers as he had been among the Baptists. In April 1659 he held three disputes with Thomas Danson at Sandwich, in which he defended Quakerism. His disputatious spirit was also expressed in his published works with their ironic, punning titles such as <span class="italic">Baby-Baptism Meer Babism</span> (1653) against infant baptism; <span class="italic">Rusticus ad academicos &hellip; the rusticks alarm to the rabbies, or, The country correcting the university and clergy</span> (1660) in which he opposed the four leading divines John Owen, Thomas Danson, John Tombes, and Richard Baxter; <span class="italic">Apokrypta apokalypta velata quaedam revelata</span> (1661), in answer to a series of questions concerning God, the devil, man, heaven, and hell; and <span class="italic">Episkopi aposkopos the Bishop Busied beside the Businesse</span> (1662) against Bishop John Gauden. Fisher's main work, <span class="italic">Rusticus ad academicos</span>, a tome of some 900 pages, has been described as &#145;the most important piece of Quaker controversy belonging to the Commonwealth period&#146;  (Braithwaite, 1.288). In this work Fisher argued, with scholarship, erudition, and wit, that the light within and not the mere letter of the scripture was the word of God and he submitted the <span class="roman">Bible</span> to remarkable criticism, questioning the reliability of the modern biblical text and claiming that the <span class="roman">Apocrypha</span> could be as divinely inspired as the canonical writings.<br>
<br>After the Restoration Fisher suffered a series of arrests and imprisonments. In June 1660 he signed <span class="italic">A declaration and an information from &hellip; to the present governors, the king and both the houses of parliament</span>, a document elaborated by Margaret Fell and signed by thirteen Friends, in which it was clearly stated that Friends &#145;do deny and bear our testimony against all strife and wars and contests&#146;. He was also one of the twelve prominent Quakers who signed the <span class="italic">Declaration Against All Plotters and Fighters in the World</span> issued on 21 January 1661. His final imprisonment in White Lion Prison, Southwark, lasted more than two years until shortly before his death from plague on 31 August 1665 in the house of Ann Travers, a Quaker, at Dalston, near London. He was buried in Bunhill Fields the same day. His son Hallelujah Fisher married Abigail Antrobus in 1677.<br>
<br>The most remarkable work of Fisher's Baptist period, <span class="italic">Baby-Baptism Meer Babism</span>, was republished under the title <span class="italic">Christianismus redivivus, Christ'ndom both Unchrist'ned and New-Christ'ned</span> in 1655 and again in 1669 (notwithstanding his conversion to Quakerism). His most important Quaker writings were reprinted in 1679 under the title of <span class="italic">The Testimony of Truth Exalted</span>, with &#145;testimonies&#146; to him by Ellis Hookes, Luke Howard, William Penn, and his son Hallelujah. The lapsed Quaker Francis Bugg put both Samuel and Hallelujah in his &#145;Cage of unclean birds&#146; but assigned no reason thereof  (F. Bugg, <span class="italic">Pilgrim's Progress</span>, 1698, 130). William Penn, who was well acquainted with him, praised Fisher's &#145;sweetness of Temper&#146;, and &#145;great Self-Denyal and Humility&#146;  (Fisher, sig. c2). According to the historian Christopher Hill, Fisher was one of the most radical <span class="roman">Bible</span> critics of the seventeenth century and &#145;deserves greater recognition as a precursor of the English Enlightenment&#146;  (Hill, 215).<br>
