<span class="headword">Walter,  Richard</span>  (1717&#150;1785), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and naval chaplain</span>, was born on 21 October 1717 in the parish of St Martin Ludgate, London, and was baptized on 29 October there. He was the son of Arthur Walter, silk mercer and resident of St Martin, and his wife, Mary. Richard went to Okenham school, in Berkshire. He is mentioned in the records of the Fishmongers' Company as having applied to the company for a scholarship. He was admitted pensioner of Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge, on 3 July 1735, matriculated in 1736, and graduated BA in 1739. He was elected to a fellowship in 1740.<br>
<br>Walter was ordained deacon by the bishop of Norwich in June 1740 and in that year was appointed chaplain of the <i>Centurion</i> (60 guns), then fitting out for her voyage against the Spanish under the command of Commodore George Anson (afterwards Baron Anson of Soberton). The <i>Centurion</i> sailed on 18 September 1740 with a crew which included both pensioners and raw recruits so that though &#145;a puny, weakly, and sickly man, pale, and of a low stature&#146;  (Walter and Robins, xxiii), Walter often had to help with the actual working of the ship, until her arrival in Maca&otilde; in November 1742. In December he obtained Anson's permission to return to England in one of the East India Company's ships.<br>
<br>Back in England, Walter graduated MA in 1744 and in March 1745 was appointed chaplain of Portsmouth Dockyard. On 5 May 1748 he married, in Gray's Inn Chapel, Jane Sabbarton of St Margaret's, Lothbury: they had four surviving children: Sophie, Arthur, Mary, and Jane. Jane married Isaac Prescott and their son was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22720/', "Henry Prescott (1783&#150;1874)")</script>. In 1748 Walter published <span class="italic">A Voyage Round the World in the Years MDCCXL, I, II, III, IV by George Anson</span>. The book had been eagerly awaited. The main result of Anson's voyage was the capture in June 1743 of a treasure-laden galleon sailing from Acapulco to Manila. Anson had arrived home with treasure worth more than &pound;400,000, and the event had captured public imagination and excitement.<br>
<br>The book became something of a best-seller, running through numerous editions in its full or abridged form and being translated into several European languages. Walter's authorship of the work was, however, disputed in 1761: James Wilson, who edited the <span class="italic">Mathematical Tracts</span> of Benjamin Robins, claimed that Robins was the real author of the book, Walter having simply supplied notes. Walter did not contest this account at the time, perhaps because by then he was seriously ill, but after his death his widow wrote to John Walter, printer and proprietor of <span class="italic">The Times</span> and a relation of Richard Walter, rebutting the suggestion that Walter had simply supplied the raw material for publication. According to her account he had been actively engaged at all stages of editing.<br>
<br>The matter was largely resolved by G. Williams in his <span class="italic">Documents Relating to Anson's Voyage</span> (1967), in which documents 141&#150;59 concern the authorship of the work. It seems clear that the initiative for publishing an authorized account of the voyage was taken by Walter, but that he was unable, unwilling, or both to bring the project to fruition and Robins was called upon to complete the task. Walter does seem to have had a hand in publishing, as distinct from editing, the work. He gathered names of subscribers and profited handsomely therefrom. It is also clear that Anson himself took a very close interest in the work, which is as a result very complimentary of his actions but provides an interesting insight into his thinking. Walter's and Robins's contributions to the work can probably never be completely disentangled, but this should not obscure its continued popularity (a full electronic edition was published in 2001 and there has been a steady stream of paper editions since its publication). It provided the inspiration and the basis for Patrick O'Brian's popular novel <span class="italic">The Golden Ocean</span> (1956), his first sea novel.<br>
<br>Walter remained chaplain to the Portsmouth Dockyard until his death on 10 March 1785. He was buried at Great Staughton, Huntingdonshire, where he owned some property, though it seems that he never lived there.<br>
