<span class="headword">Macpherson <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Bate]</span>,  Gerardine <span class="st"> [Geddie]</span></span>  (1830/31&#150;1878), <span class="occ">biographer and book illustrator</span>, was born probably in London, the elder child of Henry Bate, a Leicester artist, and his wife, Louisa, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Murphy, the sister of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/14631/', "Anna Brownell Jameson (1794&#150;1860)")</script>, a well-known writer on art and literature. After Bate went bankrupt in 1839, the childless Mrs Jameson undertook to pay for and superintend his daughter's education. In December 1840 she wrote apprehensively to her friend Ottilie von Goethe that her niece was &#145;growing a great tall, wild girl, and requires good discipline&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters of Anna Jameson</span>, 130), but by February 1842 Gerardine (known as Geddie) seems to have been living with her.<br>
<br>In 1846&#150;7 aunt and niece visited France and Italy, mainly to finish Gerardine Bate's education; they travelled with the newly married Robert and Elizabeth Barrett Browning. The romantic atmosphere must have affected the impressionable Gerardine: in Rome she met and fell in love with <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/38595/', "Robert Macpherson (1814&#150;1872)")</script>, a flamboyant Scottish artist who had recently been converted to Roman Catholicism. Stoutly protestant and probably distressed at the prospect of losing her adopted daughter, Jameson strongly disapproved of the attachment. The marriage was delayed by the 1848 revolution in Rome, which further depleted Macpherson's already precarious finances (in 1851, he turned to photography to earn his living); Gerardine Bate appears to have returned to her parents, who did not oppose the match, and in April 1849 Jameson wrote grumpily: &#145;Gerardine does not go on to my satisfaction&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters of Anna Jameson</span>, 165). The couple were married on 4 September 1849 in Ealing; in the following year, Mrs Macpherson converted to Catholicism.<br>
<br>Jameson was eventually reconciled to her niece's marriage: in 1855 and 1857, she visited the Macphersons in Rome, attending mass at St Peter's on one occasion to please Gerardine. In 1846&#150;7 Gerardine had designed the engravings for Jameson's <span class="italic">Sacred and Legendary Art</span> (1848); Jameson now engaged her to provide etchings for the second edition of her <span class="italic">Legends of the Madonna</span> (1857). Such employment was no doubt welcome: never more than comfortably off, the Macphersons had a growing family and Robert was almost continually in poor health. Gerardine Macpherson was a working wife and mother: she illustrated her husband's <span class="italic">Vatican Sculptures</span> (1863) and assisted him with his photographic business. Robert Macpherson also dealt in antiquities: responsible for the discovery of Michelangelo's <span class="italic">The Entombment of Christ</span> in 1846, he hoarded it as a financial security, describing it as &#145;Gerardine's fortune&#146; and eventually selling it to the National Gallery in 1868 for &pound;2000.<br>
<br>After 1865 Robert Macpherson's health and business both declined, and he died in November 1872, leaving his wife and four surviving children in financial distress. Gerardine Macpherson supported her family by giving lessons in English, acting as an amanuensis, and serving as a newspaper correspondent in Rome during the hot season when the regular correspondents departed. More significantly, she prepared her <span class="italic">Memoirs of the Life of Anna Jameson</span> (1878), which necessitated a three-month visit to England; the first biography of her aunt, it was published after her death with an introductory preface by a family friend, the novelist Margaret Oliphant. It remained the most important account of Jameson's life and work until it was superseded by Clara Thomas's 1967 biography. Worn out by her many employments, suffering from rheumatism and heart disease, Gerardine Macpherson died in Rome on 24 May 1878; she was buried next to her husband in the cemetery of San Lorenzo.<br>
<br>When first embarking on her niece's education in 1842, Jameson had declared that she would try to &#145;give her the means of independence [so that] she will not be obliged to marry for money, like so many women of her condition&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters of Anna Jameson</span>, 135): ironically, as for her aunt, neither education nor marriage ensured financial security (whatever their other benefits) for Gerardine Macpherson. Her plight is indicative of the financial perils of the mid-Victorian middle-class woman; her achievements were the essentially complementary and concealed ones characteristic of the home-educated and amateur woman artist and writer of the 1850s and 1860s.<br>
