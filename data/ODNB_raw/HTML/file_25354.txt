<span class="headword">Sherard,  James</span>  (1666&#150;1738), <span class="occ">apothecary and botanist</span>, and son of George Sherard or Sherwood of Bushby in Leicestershire, and Mary, his second wife, was born at Bushby on 1 July 1666. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25355/', "William Sherard (1659&#150;1728)")</script> was his brother. On 7 February 1682 he was apprenticed to Charles Watts, an apothecary, who was curator of the botanical gardens at Chelsea. Sherard worked hard as an apothecary, and by many years' practice in Mark Lane, London, accumulated an ample fortune. From about 1707 he acted as general factotum to the physician John Radcliffe. Sherard retired from the business about 1720. By then, the gout from which Sherard suffered had already forced him to give up his pursuit of music, at which he was a gifted amateur. He had earlier composed twenty-four trio sonatas, which were published in two collections, in 1701 and 1711. The first of these was dedicated to the second duke of Bedford, for whose family Sherard's brother, William, had worked as a tutor. Sherard's sonatas are all of the <i>da chiesa</i> type, and owe much to Italian models. They were perhaps first performed by their composer, who was also an accomplished violinist.<br>
<br>On his retirement Sherard purchased the manors of Evington and Settle in Leicestershire, but he chiefly resided at Eltham in Kent, where he pursued the cultivation of valuable and rare plants and his garden, with its hothouses, became noted as among the finest in England. An illustrated catalogue of his collection was published by Dillenius in 1732 as <span class="italic">Hortus Elthamensis, sive, Plantarum rariorum quas in horto suo Elthami in Cantio collegit vir ornatissimus et praestantissimus Jac. Sherard, M.D., Reg. Soc. et Coll. Med. Lond. Soc. Catalogus</span>. Despite his election as a fellow of the Royal Society in 1706, Sherard was initially less well known as a botanist than his brother, William, as whose London agent he sometimes acted. By the 1720s, however, James Sherard's own reputation as a collector of rare plant specimens was established, and his discoveries of English plants had augmented those of Ray and others. He now travelled more widely in search of specimens, including trips to the continent, as well as keeping up correspondences and exchanges of plants with other botanists, notably Richard Richardson. During the 1730s, he also assisted with the management of the Chelsea gardens.<br>
<br>In 1728 Sherard was appointed as executor of his brother William's will. After initial disputes, he negotiated his brother's endowment of a professorship of botany in the University of Oxford, J. J. Dillenius being the first Sherardian professor. James Sherard's administration of the trust led the University of Oxford to confer upon him the degree of doctor of medicine, by diploma dated 2 July 1731, and the Royal College of Physicians to admit him on 30 September 1732 to its fellowship without examination and without the payment of fees. He died on 12 February 1738, leaving a fortune reputed to amount to &pound;150,000. He had married Susanna (<i>b</i>. 1669), daughter of Richard Lockwood, but they had no children. He was buried at Evington parish church, where his widow erected a marble tablet to his memory. She died on 27 November 1741.<br>
