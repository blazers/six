<span class="headword">Perry,  Walter Copland</span>  (1814&#150;1911), <span class="occ">writer and collector of casts</span>, born in Norwich on 24 July 1814, was the second son of Isaac Perry (1777&#150;1837), a Congregational minister at Cherry Lane, Norwich (1802&#150;14), who later became a Unitarian minister at Ipswich (1814&#150;25) and at Edinburgh (1828&#150;30), and then a schoolmaster at Liverpool. Walter's mother was Elizabeth, daughter of John Dawson Copland. He received his early education from his father, a fine scholar. In 1831 he was entered, as Walter Coupland Perry, at Manchester College, York, where he remained until 1836. He distinguished himself as a classical scholar, and on the advice of John Kenrick, tutor at Manchester College, who had studied at G&ouml;ttingen, he went there in 1836; in August 1837 he gained a PhD with high honours for a thesis on Ephesus.<br>
<br>On returning to York, Perry replaced Kenrick as classical tutor in 1837&#150;8, while the latter was ill. From 1838 to 1844 he was Unitarian minister at George's Meeting, Exeter, as colleague with Henry Acton. His pulpit services were more scholarly than popular. In 1844 he conformed to the Anglican church as a layman; his <span class="italic">Prayer Bell</span> (1843) suggests that his views were more evangelical than was common among Unitarians. He married on 23 June 1841 Hephzibah Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1880), second daughter of Samuel Shaen of Crix Hall, Hatfield Peverel, Essex, with whom he had five sons, who all survived him, and one daughter (<i>d</i>. 1898).<br>
<br>On 12 January 1844 Perry entered as a student at the Middle Temple; he was called to the bar on 31 January 1851. After settling in Bonn at the end of 1844, he and his wife obtained great reputations as teachers and he came to act as the &#145;organ and representative of the English visitors at Bonn&#146;, as he expressed it. Among Perry's pupils were Edward Robert Bulwer, first earl of Lytton, Sir Francis Bertie, British ambassador in Paris, and Sir Eric Barrington.<br>
<br>On returning to Britain in 1875, Perry settled in London, where he was a member of the Athenaeum, and continued to write. He had already published on German universities (1845) and the Franks (1857) and now turned his hand to subjects as diverse as classical sculpture, Homer, Sicily, and the French Revolution, as well as fiction, of which he published some works anonymously and one pseudonymously as John Copland. In 1880 his first wife died and on 12 November 1889 he married Emma Evelyn, daughter of Robert Stopford. By his efforts, initiated at a meeting in Grosvenor House on 16 May 1877, followed by his paper &#145;On the formation of a gallery of casts from the antique in London&#146; (1878), Perry gathered a large collection of casts, installed at first in a special gallery at the South Kensington Museum and after 1909 at the British Museum. He produced a catalogue of the collection in 1887. Such collections of casts had long been desired to enable students to trace the progress of classical sculpture, but Perry's creation was belated and short-lived. The British Museum, short of space for original sculptures, did not consider the cast gallery space well used and by 1939 the collection had been entirely dismantled and dispersed.<br>
<br>Perry, who had great personal charm, enjoyed blood sports and was a good amateur actor. He died at his residence, 25 Manchester Square, London, on 28 December 1911 and was buried in Hendon parish churchyard. He was survived by his wife.<br>
