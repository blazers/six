<span class="headword">Sheffield <span class="st"> [Sheffeild]</span>,  John</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1680), <span class="occ">clergyman and ejected minister</span>, came from Northamptonshire. His parents' names are not known, though Sheffield (or Sheffeild, the spelling under which his books were published) seems to have come from a junior branch of the family of the Sheffields, earls of Mulgrave and lords Sheffield of Butterwick. In the dedication to a book he published in 1650 he saluted Edmund, the second earl, as &#145;head of a great family, and the highest branch of a numerous name, all whose sheaves do willingly bow to your Lordship's sheaf as gladly and wilingly as Joseph's brethren did to him&#146;  (Sheffeild, <span class="italic">A Good Conscience the Strongest Hold</span>, sig. A4).<br>
<br>Sheffield matriculated from Peterhouse, Cambridge, in 1618, where he was listed as a poor scholar on 5 December of that year. He graduated BA in 1622 and proceeded MA in 1625. Ordained a deacon in the diocese of Peterborough on 22 December 1622 he became curate of Felmersham, Bedfordshire, in the following year while still at Cambridge, but his ordination as a priest (also at Peterborough) was delayed until 22 September 1628. On 4 May 1629 he was instituted as rector of Careby, Lincolnshire, and it was probably about this time that he married his wife, Elizabeth; they may well have been the John Sheffield and Elizabeth Eastwicke who married at Boston, Lincolnshire, on 2 October 1628. Their eldest son, John, who was at Tonbridge School in 1646 and was admitted to St John's College in May of that year, was born in 1629 or 1630. A daughter, Katherine, and a son, Stephen, were baptized at Careby in 1632 and 1634 respectively; the latter was admitted to Merchant Taylors' School in 1648. It is uncertain whether John's two younger sons, Timothy (<i>bap</i>. 1654/5) and Nathaniel (<i>bap</i>. 1662), were the children of his first wife, Elizabeth, or his second, Barbara (<i>d</i>. 1684), whose former name was probably Smith.<br>
<br>It may be that John Sheffield arrived with his family to take up the ministry at Tonbridge, Kent, following the sequestration in 1643 of Edward Ashburnham, the rector there and a prebendary of Chichester Cathedral, though there is no certain confirmation of his ministering there until July 1647. Soon afterwards, however, Sheffield moved to the parish of St Swithin London Stone, London, where on 7 November 1647 he was elected minister at a meeting of the vestry. He was a signatory on 14 December 1647 of <span class="italic">A Testimony to the Truth of Jesus Christ, and to our Solemn League and Covenant</span>, and in January 1649 signed as minister of St Swithin <span class="italic">A Vindication of the Ministers of the Gospel</span>, which deplored the proceedings against Charles I. As all this may suggest, Sheffield was a presbyterian by persuasion. In 1650 he published <span class="italic">A Good Conscience the Strongest Hold</span>. The preface, addressed &#145;To the conscientious reader&#146; advised: &#145;Conscience is the book of books, the ancientest piece of scripture in the world&#146;, lamenting that &#145;these times of our have been too fruitful in disputes and controversies; in dealing with which there is no end&#146;. A report dated 29 April 1652, which included the information that one minister and three ruling elders were in place at St Swithin, was signed by Sheffield as moderator of the third London classis. But he was formally presented by the Salters' Company to the rectory of St Swithin only on 12 May 1657, signing a grateful preface to the master and officials of the company in his <span class="italic">The Sinfulness of Evil Thoughts</span> (1659). In <span class="italic">The Rising Sun, or, The Sun of Righteousness</span> (1654) something of the flavour of his ministry at St Swithin is suggested by a preface to his friends there, who &#145;have had the sum of this discourse preached among you, and divers of you have it written in your note books and repeated in your families&#146;. Sheffield served as an assistant to the London commission for scandalous ministers under the ordinance of 28 August 1654, and was appointed as a commissioner for the approbation of ministers in March 1660.<br>
<br>In 1660 Sheffield was ejected from St Swithin upon the return of the sequestrated minister. He did not immediately leave the parish, where his son Nathaniel was baptized on 27 March 1662. However, probably shortly afterwards he settled at Enfield, Middlesex. He took the Oxford oath in 1666, and on 15 April 1672 was granted a licence under the declaration of indulgence to teach at his own and two other houses in Enfield. Although, according to Calamy, &#145;from his youth up was addicted to piety and seriousness&#146;, Sheffield &#145;was one that formed his sermons not from monastic contemplations in his cell, but took for a ground work such things as did occur&#146; in the world around him; perhaps as a result &#145;a briskness appears in all his writings&#146;  (Calamy, <span class="italic">Abridgement</span>, 2.38&#150;9). John Sheffield was buried at Enfield on 3 August 1680. In his will, dated from there on 26 May 1680 and proved on 17 August 1680, he left property at Enfield and elsewhere to his second wife, Barbara, who died in 1684.<br>
