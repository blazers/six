</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Auchinleck, Sir  Claude John Eyre</span>  (1884&#150;1981), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was born at Aldershot on 21 June 1884, the elder son and eldest of four children of Colonel John Claude Alexander Auchinleck, of the Royal Artillery, who died when Claude was eight, and his wife, Mary Eleanor, daughter of John Eyre. As the son of a deceased officer he qualified for a foundation place at Wellington College but his mother was hard pressed to pay even the reduced fee of &pound;10 a year. Accustomed to hardship at home or with his mother's relations in Ireland, Auchinleck acquired a lifelong indifference to personal comfort. He passed into the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, just high enough on the list to secure a posting to the Indian army, where in 1904 he was commissioned into the 62nd Punjabis. He displayed a marked aptitude for learning local languages, and soon developed a close rapport with the ordinary soldiers of the Indian army.<h2>
<a name="FirstWorldWarandserviceinIndia"></a>First World War and service in India</h2>On the outbreak of the First World War, Auchinleck as a captain accompanied his regiment to Egypt, where he first saw action in repelling the Turkish attack on the Suez Canal in February 1915. From 1916 to the end of the war he served in Mesopotamia, taking part in the desperate attempts to relieve Kut al-Amara and at one point commanding his depleted battalion. Promoted brigade major to the 52nd brigade, he took part in the victorious advance to Baghdad in operations characterized by appalling conditions, defective medical supplies, and faulty tactics. Though appointed to the DSO (1917) and thrice mentioned in dispatches, his promotion after 1918 was slow. In 1921 he married Jessie, daughter of Alexander Stewart, civil engineer, of Kinloch Rannoch, Perthshire.<br>
<br>Auchinleck passed at the Staff College, Quetta, in 1919, attended the inaugural course at the Imperial Defence College in 1927, and as a full colonel returned to Quetta as an instructor from 1930 to 1932. In 1933 he took over command of the Peshawar brigade, which was immediately involved in operations against the upper Mohmands, followed by another campaign in 1935. Auchinleck displayed professional competence and skill in improvisation in one of the most difficult forms of warfare; in consequence he was promoted major-general and in 1936 became deputy chief of the general staff in India. In 1938&#150;9 he was a key member of the Chatfield committee on the modernization of the Indian army. Here he evinced his progressive belief in the feasibility of replacing British officers by Indians.<h2>
<a name="EuropeandIndia19401941"></a>Europe and India, 1940&#150;1941</h2>Early in 1940 Auchinleck was posted to England to prepare 4th corps for eventual dispatch to France but, as an expert in mountain warfare, was precipitately sent to Norway, after the disastrous opening of the campaign, to take command of the land forces in the Narvik area. Auchinleck's insistence on the provision of essential supplies, artillery, and air cover irritated Winston Churchill, then first lord of the Admiralty, and was symptomatic of their relations. The general's forebodings were justified in that under-equipping and tragi-comic mismanagement continued to dog operations, which were overshadowed from the outset by the German attack in the west on 10 May. Narvik was duly retaken, only to be speedily abandoned. Auchinleck's report to the war cabinet, stating that the French contingent had impressed him more than the British, was not well received.<br>
<br>Nevertheless Auchinleck was at once instructed to form 5th corps for the defence of southern England against invasion, and in July 1940 he was promoted general officer commanding, southern command, where he experienced considerable friction with his successor at 5th corps, Lieutenant-General B. L. Montgomery. In November, when the immediate threat of invasion had passed, Auchinleck was promoted full general and appointed commander-in-chief in India. This was perhaps a surprising transfer from an active to a secondary, support theatre, but India's military importance was increasing. It was the potential source of many divisions equipped from local manufacturing resources which were badly needed in the Middle East and the Far East; it might become a target for Japanese aggression; and its internal unrest needed handling by a respected Indian army veteran. Auchinleck won Churchill's approval by promptly dispatching a force to help put down the rebellion of Rashid Ali in Iraq. The prime minister decided that the Auk, as he was known, had the necessary drive after all, as well as the other professional and personal attributes which he admired. Churchill also decided that Auchinleck must take over as commander-in-chief Middle East, where Sir A. P. Wavell, in his opinion, was too exhausted to achieve the desperately needed victory. Consequently, when operation Battleaxe failed in June 1941, Churchill ordered Wavell and Auchinleck to change places.<h2>
<a name="Westerndesert19411942"></a>Western desert, 1941&#150;1942</h2>Auchinleck had been warned by successive chiefs of the Imperial General Staff, Sir John Dill and Sir Alan Brooke, that Churchill would expect an early offensive and quick results, and that if he could not provide them he must very diplomatically explain why. Unfortunately Auchinleck was a bluff, uncompromising soldier, unable or unwilling to learn diplomatic finesse. After a brisk exchange of signals he bluntly told Churchill: &#145;I must repeat that to launch an offensive with the inadequate means at present at our disposal is not, in my opinion, a justifiable operation of war.&#146; To all Churchill's relentless pressure and cajolery he returned a bleak factual explanation of the desert army's unreadiness for battle. From London, the reinforcements in troops, tanks, and guns seemed more than adequate (particularly in the light of the enemy's deficiencies as revealed by Ultra intelligence); but in Auchinleck's judgement the troops required training and acclimatization, while the tanks and guns were inferior to the enemy's.<br>
<br>On this occasion Auchinleck got his way. Not until 18 November did Eighth Army open operation Crusader by advancing round the southern flank of the axis forces' position on the Italian frontier. General Sir Alan Cunningham intended to drive towards the besieged Tobruk, so forcing Rommel to defend his communications on ground not of his own choosing, whereupon he would be defeated by the superior numbers of the British armour. An extraordinarily confused situation developed, in which tanks and armoured cars milled about the desert desperately trying to retain cohesion and restore order in an unusually dense &#145;fog of war&#146;. Units of the axis forces and Eighth Army became interspersed and layered upon one another in a remarkable fashion. As the battle appeared to swing against him, with Rommel's bold dash towards the Egyptian frontier, Cunningham lost his nerve and began to talk of retreat. Warned of this situation, Auchinleck flew up to the front, restored confidence, and ordered the offensive to be renewed. Shortly afterwards he relieved Cunningham, replacing him with his deputy chief of staff from Cairo, Neil Ritchie, initially as a temporary measure to avoid changing the corps commanders.<br>
<br>The immediate outcome was an impressive victory. Tobruk was relieved and Rommel forced to retreat into Cyrenaica with the loss of 20,000 prisoners and masses of <i>mat&eacute;riel</i>. In February 1942 however, Rommel, having received reinforcements, unexpectedly counter-attacked, driving the Eighth Army out of Benghazi and back to the Gazala line with its right flank on the sea about 35 miles west of Tobruk.<br>
<br>As in the previous year, Auchinleck was placed under increasing pressure from Churchill to mount a new offensive, now with the urgent need to contribute to the relief of Malta by seizing axis-held airfields. In these circumstances Auchinleck was unwise in his adamant refusal to fly to London to explain his case that offensive operations before 1 June might risk defeat and the loss of Egypt. Churchill and the war cabinet were unsympathetic: Auchinleck was instructed to attack before 1 June only to be pre-empted by Rommel on 26 May.<br>
<br>Auchinleck offered another hostage to fortune in retaining Ritchie as Eighth Army commander despite private warnings that he lacked the quality and experience to stand up to Rommel, and also lacked the confidence of his corps commanders, W. H. E. Gott and C. W. M. N. Norrie&#151;both senior to him and more experienced in command. Auchinleck in effect got the worst of both worlds: he expressed confidence in Ritchie, yet tried to control him at long distance by feeding him detailed advice before and during the Gazala battle. More serious still, as conclusively shown by Field Marshal Lord Carver, Ritchie was correct in his diagnosis of Rommel's intended line of attack round the south of the British defences, and Auchinleck wrong, despite his access to Ultra. As a consequence of Auchinleck's misjudgement, Norrie's armoured brigades were not concentrated to check and defeat Rommel's initial attack as they might otherwise have been. Auchinleck's Ultra intelligence, which revealed Rommel's severe logistic problems and shortage of tanks and fuel, also caused him to urge Ritchie to seize the initiative for which he was later to be blamed as over-optimistic.<br>
<br>The outcome of the Gazala battle was a clear-cut defeat. Tobruk surrendered and the Eighth Army was driven all the way back to the line of El Alamein. Auchinleck at this late stage in the battle (25 June) removed Ritchie and assumed command himself. Despite Auchinleck's excellent intelligence of Rommel's weaknesses, dispositions, and intentions, there is little evidence that he displayed exceptional skill in his execution of counter-attacks, which all petered out ineffectually. Nevertheless his resolution and calm contributed to the defensive success. By mid-July Rommel's advance had been decisively halted, and his diaries reveal that he had come close to total defeat. By early August Churchill had decided to remove Auchinleck, replacing him with Montgomery&#151;news which Auchinleck heard on 8 August.<br>
<br>Montgomery's sweeping criticisms of his predecessor sought to deny Auchinleck any credit either for checking Rommel or for bequeathing a feasible defensive plan. By the end of July the defensive layout of minefields and field fortifications was indeed well in hand. Montgomery was certainly unjust in telling Churchill a few days after he had taken command that Auchinleck had no plan and in the event of a heavy attack intended to retreat to the Nile delta.<br>
<br>On the other hand Montgomery's buoyant personality did inject new confidence into a tired army, and he did make significant changes to the plans he inherited. In particular he realized immediately that if all available reserves were called up from the delta, he would be able to man a continuous line of defence as far south as Alam Halfa. On that ridge he would reinforce his left flank and threaten any enemy attempt to turn it by a counter-attack. All contingency plans for insuring against failure were cancelled. Ironically, Auchinleck was dismissed by Churchill for refusing to be pressured into a premature offensive, whereas Montgomery took several additional weeks to prepare his offensive which began on 23 October.<h2>
<a name="India19421947"></a>India, 1942&#150;1947</h2>Auchinleck was hurt by the manner of his removal and refused relegation to the command in Persia and Iraq. Consequently he spent nearly a year idle in India before again becoming commander-in-chief there on Wavell's promotion to viceroy in June 1943.<br>
<br>Though deprived of responsibility for the conduct of operations against the Japanese, Auchinleck bore the burden of the vast expansion of the Indian army and its war industry. He had to provide bases, troops, and supplies for the Burma campaign, and also assist the Chinese and American forces in that theatre. His immense prestige in the Indian army was a great asset in this task. He was one of the few British generals to gain the respect of the American &#145;Vinegar Joe&#146; Stilwell but, unlike Wavell, was too conventional a soldier to sympathize with Orde Wingate's unorthodox methods and exorbitant demands on Indian resources.<br>
<br>In 1945 Auchinleck was appointed GCB, and in the following year was promoted field marshal, but these honours were overshadowed by a personal tragedy. His wife left him for another senior officer at general headquarters and they were divorced in 1946. They had no children. Jessie had found her husband's long office hours and dedication to work tiresome and ultimately intolerable. Her departure left a void in the field marshal's life which he filled by working harder than ever.<br>
<br>Auchinleck's last phase in India proved tragic in an even deeper sense. He had hoped that India, and hence his cherished Indian army, would remain united, but he quickly realized that partition of the country and the army was inevitable. He knew that considerable time would be needed for peacefully reconstituting two dominion armies without the steadying influence of British officers, the great majority of whom would wish to retire. Partition in 1948 would have been difficult enough, but the sudden decision of the new viceroy, Viscount Mountbatten of Burma, to bring forward independence to 15 August 1947, made Auchinleck's task impossible. The Indian army itself was deeply affected by religious conflict and rapidly disintegrated as an organized force. The meagre British military and police forces were powerless to prevent the massacres that accompanied the partition of the Punjab.<br>
<br>After independence Auchinleck decided to stay on as supreme commander of the Indian and Pakistan forces. He was openly criticized by some Indian leaders as being too favourable to Pakistan, and beneath a polite fa&ccedil;ade his relations with Mountbatten were increasingly strained. In September 1947 Mountbatten asked him to resign, and he left India on 1 December in a mood of bitterness and despair after forty-four years' service. He refused a peerage lest the honour be associated with the events that he considered to be dishonourable.<h2>
<a name="Finalyears"></a>Final years</h2>After retiring from the army Auchinleck led an active life, frequently revisiting India on business. His numerous appointments included those of governor of Wellington College (1946&#150;59), president of the London Federation of Boys' Clubs (1949&#150;55), vice-president of the Forces Help Society and the Lord Roberts Workshops, and chairman of the Armed Forces Art Society (1950&#150;67). He characteristically refused to join in the battle of the memoirs, but in 1967 presented his personal papers to Manchester University, convinced that history would eventually do him justice.<br>
<br>Auchinleck had a most attractive personality; he detested all forms of pomp, display, and self-advertisement; but his simple tastes in personal matters did not inhibit him as a generous and entertaining host. His former private secretary, Major-General Shahid Hamid, has described Auchinleck in his element among his Indian soldiers: &#145;There is nothing dominating or overbearing in his character at all &hellip; His mental energy, enthusiasm, good temper and driving power are immense &hellip; He has become a legend in his lifetime&#146;  (Hamid, 68).<br>
<br>In 1968, when over eighty, Auchinleck left England to live in an unpretentious flat in Marrakesh. There he received visitors and spent his time painting, fishing, and walking. He had received honorary LLDs from Aberdeen and St Andrews universities in 1948 and from Manchester in 1970. He had many other honours, among which were OBE (1919), CB (1934), CSI (1936), GCIE (1940), and GCB (1945). He was among the ten field marshals of the Second World War honoured by a memorial in the crypt of St Paul's in November 1976. He died in his home, Villa Rikighou, rue Liafid Ibrahim, Marrakesh, Morocco, on 23 March 1981.<br>
