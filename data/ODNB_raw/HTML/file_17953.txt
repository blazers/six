<span class="headword">Manners,  Francis</span>, sixth earl of Rutland  (1578&#150;1632), <span class="occ">nobleman</span>, was the second son of John Manners, fourth earl of Rutland (<i>d</i>. 1588), and Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1595), daughter of Francis Charlton of Apley Castle, Shropshire; his elder brother was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17962/', "Roger Manners, fifth earl of Rutland (1576&#150;1612)")</script>. He was admitted to Christ's College, Cambridge, in 1595 and later travelled in France, Italy, and the empire before returning in 1600. With his elder brother he took part in the earl of Essex's plot in early 1601 and was imprisoned and fined 1000 marks. Following his release and the cancellation of his fine, he admitted to his uncle, John Manners of Haddon, that he was foolish, &#145;neither knowing that I went aboute nor the danger when I was in it&#146;  (<span class="italic">Rutland MSS</span>, 1.374). He was admitted to the Inner Temple in November 1601. On 6 May 1602 he married Frances (<i>d</i>. 1605), daughter of Henry Knyvet of Charlton, Wiltshire, and widow of Sir William Bevill. She gave birth to their only child, Katherine (1605&#150;1649), in 1605 but later that year, probably in September, died of smallpox; their daughter later became <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/69581/', "Katherine MacDonnell")</script>. On 6 January 1605 Manners was created a knight of the Bath, in the same ceremony as Prince Charles. On 26 October 1608 he married Cecily (<i>d</i>. 1653), daughter of John Tufton of Hothfield, Kent; as she was the wealthy widow of Sir Edward Hungerford, her nuptial agreement was negotiated by the lord chamberlain and approved by Manners's brother, the fifth earl. Subsequently, possibly under the influence of Cecily, a recusant, Francis Manners, his daughter, Katherine, and his sister, Frances (who married Lord Willoughby of Parham), were all to become Catholics.<br>
<br>When Manners succeeded his brother as sixth earl of Rutland on 26 June 1612 he was already active in masques and tilts at court but he now turned to the improvement of his large inheritance. His lands were in Lincolnshire, where he was lord lieutenant until 23 January 1629, in Nottinghamshire, where he was constable of Nottingham Castle and warden of Sherwood Forest until April 1620, and in Leicestershire, where his favourite seat, Belvoir Castle, was visited by James I on six occasions. There were profitable ironworks on his estate at Rievaulx and other properties produced a surplus that enabled him to buy or lease new lands. He avoided costly new buildings on his estates but improved the facade of Belvoir Castle. When he lost a claim to the barony of Ros in a law suit, he was granted a hereditary title as Lord Ros of Hamlake in July 1616 and was installed as a knight of the Garter on 7 July.<br>
<br>After his appointment as privy councillor on 6 April 1617, Rutland attended the king on his journey to Scotland. His career at court became linked to that of the royal favourite, Buckingham, after his marriage to Rutland's daughter, Katherine; there were initial obstacles, in her Catholicism and in the exorbitant financial settlement that the groom demanded, but when Katherine agreed &#145;for his sake and his mothers to be converted and to receive the communion this Easter&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters of John Chamberlain</span>, 2.301), and a less onerous financial arrangement was accepted, they were married on 16 May 1620. At the opening of parliament on 30 January 1621 Rutland bore the cap of maintenance and at his son-in-law's request he was later, in April 1623, appointed admiral of the fleet to carry Prince Charles and the infanta to England. However this &#145;Spanish match&#146; had failed, much to Rutland's dismay, prior to the fleet's departure in September, so that he brought back an embittered entourage. When the House of Lords was in session in March 1624 he cast the only dissenting vote when the declaration of the Commons annulling the treaties with Spain was put to the question. Later, on 20 May, in the petition of the Commons to the king denouncing the Catholics &#145;charged with places of trust&#146; in the shires, Rutland and his wife were first on the list as &#145;suspected popish recusants&#146;, for he was lord lieutenant of Lincolnshire, commissioner of peace, and <i>custos rotulorum</i> in Northamptonshire  (<span class="italic">JHL</span>, 3, 1767, 394&#150;5).<br>
<br>At Charles's coronation Rutland bore the rod with the dove but he was absent from the parliament of 1625, sending his proxy to Buckingham. At the parliament of 1626 he took the oath of allegiance for the first time and held the proxies of three absent Catholic peers. Again the Commons sent a petition to the king, in which Rutland headed their list as commissioner of peace and of oyer and terminer in Yorkshire&#151;a &#145;popish recusant&#146; who &#145;affronted&#146; the commissioners of the North Riding by licensing convicted recusants as an alehouse keeper and as schoolmaster in his manor of Helmsley  (Rushworth, 1.392). At this session the Commons also questioned Buckingham: &#145;Whether recusants be not borne and increased by reason of the duke's mother and father-in-law being known papists&#146;  (<span class="italic">Diary of Walter Yonge</span>, 91). Early in 1627 Rutland toured Lincolnshire widely, collecting the unpopular forced loan by threats and promises to reach a required amount. At the parliament of 1628 he carried the sword of state and then took the oath of allegiance and received the proxies of two absent Catholic peers. In taking the oath twice he was apparently in the role of a &#145;church papist&#146;, for he was still judged to be a leading recusant in Yorkshire. Sir Thomas Hoby tried to have him convicted in 1631 at the Helmsley quarter sessions, but failed &#145;since he did not stay over four successive Sundays at Helmsley Castle&#146; by which he could be legally indicted as a resident  (Aveling, 284); later the dowager countess was pardoned for recusancy by Charles I. Rutland died on 17 December 1632 at an inn in Bishop's Stortford, Hertfordshire, after giving final advice to his wife and brother George, who was to inherit his title. His personal goods when inventoried were worth &pound;20,206 and his personal debts were paid off by one year's revenue from his estates, with his funeral at &#145;the phenomenal sum of over &pound;3500&#146;  (Stone, 200); he was buried at Bottesford church, Leicestershire, on 20 February 1633. As sixth earl of Rutland he was an astute manager of extensive properties for two decades but his career at Charles's court was not as successful for personal reasons. He was very close to the Spanish ambassador Gondomar, as seen in his opposition to the war that Charles was anxious to begin in 1624, and he was widely considered to be a recusant although he adroitly escaped the penalties.<br>
