<span class="headword">Digby,  Mabel Mary Josephine</span>  (1835&#150;1911), <span class="occ">Roman Catholic nun</span>, was born at Ashford House, Staines, Middlesex, on 7 April 1835, the fourth of the six children of Simon Digby (<i>d</i>. 1858) and Elizabeth Anne Morse (<i>d</i>. 1890), heir of Baron Haversham. When Mabel Digby was five the family moved to Aranhill House, Bath, where she was educated under the supervision of her mother. Digby was, however, a much keener hunter than scholar, an enthusiasm she shared with her adored father. On account of her mother's health a further move was made to France in 1849. In September 1852 both her mother and her sister Geraldine were received into the Roman Catholic church. This caused a rift in the family: Mabel Digby at once avowed her intent of remaining a protestant and returned to England with her equally staunch father. The following winter her health broke down and she rejoined her mother at Montpellier. On 17 February 1853 Mabel Digby was coaxed into the church of Notre-Dame des Tables by some Catholic friends on the pretext of attending a concert of sacred music. The performance concluded with benediction of the blessed sacrament, during which she underwent a profound spiritual experience which led to her reception into the Roman church a month later, when she took the additional names Mary Josephine.<br>
<br>At Marmoutier-l&egrave;s-Tours, where her younger sister Eva was at school, Mabel Digby became acquainted with the sisters of the Sacred Heart. Her application to enter the society was initially rejected by the assistant-general. After the personal intervention of the founder Madeleine-Sophie Barat, who recognized Digby's qualities of leadership, she was accepted and received the habit at the noviceship of Conflans-Ste Honorine on 20 March 1857. A year later she returned to teach at Marmoutier, becoming superior of the house in 1865. Her term of office saw the terrible floods of 1866, and the Franco-Prussian War and occupation of 1870&#150;71. During this time the convent became a hospital, and Mother Digby herself assisted the surgeons. In August 1872 she was appointed vicaress of the English house at Roehampton. Within the year she had established a teachers' training college at Wandsworth, with further houses following at Hove, Carlisle, and Hammersmith. The new English vicariate also made foundations in Dublin, Sydney, and Melbourne.<br>
<br>During the thirteenth General Congregation of the society in August 1894 Mother Digby was elected assistant-general of the Society of Sacred Heart. Within a year, upon the sudden death of Mother von Satorius, she was elected to succeed her as superior-general of the society. Mother Digby's generalate was a period of enormous difficulty but great hope. It saw the celebration of the centennial of the society in 1900 and the beatification of the founder in 1908, both of which served as focal points for the renewal of its spirit and vigour. Soon after her election Mother Digby began the visitation of the houses in Europe and north Africa, and in 1898&#150;9 those of Mexico, the United States, and Canada.<br>
<br>On the other hand, in France, the anti-association legislation of the Combes government in 1903 effectively closed all religious teaching establishments in the country. Beginning with Moulins in March 1903 and ending with Conflans in 1909, forty-seven Sacred Heart houses were closed, their furnishings disposed of, and more than 2000 religious sent to existing and newly established houses across the globe. The general administration moved to Ixelles, near Brussels. Mother Digby conducted the business of the society under such difficult conditions with diplomacy and efficiency, displaying great clarity of mind and strength of will. However, some in the society considered her style of government too independent: complaints were made to the cardinal protector in Rome, and Archbishop Richard of Paris was sent as apostolic delegate to the fifteenth General Congregation which met in 1904. Nevertheless, despite her outward reserve Digby had gained the affection of many of her sisters in religion; she possessed a quick wit and the ability to express herself in a powerfully succinct manner. Richard expressed his satisfaction with both the government of the society and its general direction.<br>
<br>In 1895 Mother Digby had suffered a severe heart attack. The heavy administrative burdens arising from the situation in France further undermined her health. On 15 May 1911 she suffered a stroke and died on the 21st at the Convent of the Sacred Heart, Ixelles. Because the society possessed no cemetery in Belgium the decision was made to take Digby's body to Roehampton, where she was buried after a requiem mass celebrated on 26 May.<br>
