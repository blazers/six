<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Speed,  John</span>  (1551/2&#150;1629), <span class="occ">historian and cartographer</span>, was born at Farndon, Cheshire. He was the son (born before their marriage) of John Speed (1526&#150;1584&times;1603), merchant tailor, and Elizabeth Cheynye (<i>b</i>. 1530). Speed was made free of the Merchant Taylors' Company on 10 September 1580 through patrimony, with no occupation given; meanwhile, he had married Susanna (1557/8&#150;1628), daughter of Thomas Draper, freeman of the city of London, in 1570 or 1571 and become a father: the couple had twelve sons and six daughters. Both father and son had property in St Paul's Churchyard: by 1567 the father was leasing from the dean and chapter of St Paul's a sizeable house on the north side in St Gregory's parish; by 1602 the son was leasing two houses on the south-east side in St Faith's parish, adjoining the south-east end of the cathedral (possibly the two ruinous tenements Speed leased from the dean and chapter of St Paul's in 1592). In one of these houses seven books tending towards papistry were found in 1584.<br>
<br>By the late 1580s the younger Speed had theological interests, was associated with Hugh Broughton, and in 1588&#150;9 saw the printing of Broughton's <span class="italic">Concent of Scripture</span> through the press. This work contained maps, including one engraved by William Rogers (who was later to engrave Speed's map of Cheshire of 1602&#150;3) and one attributed to Jodocus Hondius (engraver for Speed's <span class="italic">Theatre</span>). Shortly afterwards, Broughton fled to the continent, leaving his genealogies of the scriptures with Speed, who had helped to compile them. These <span class="italic">Genealogies Recorded in the Sacred Scriptures</span> were published in 1592 and probably formed the basis of those for which Speed was granted the privilege in 1610 to insert in every copy of the Authorized Version of the <span class="roman">Bible</span> for ten years. This patent was renewed twice; after much correspondence, the Stationers' Company bought out Speed's son <a href="#cosubject_26094">John [<i>see below</i>]</a> in 1638 for &pound;700. Speed's theological interests continued: about 1595 he published <span class="italic">A direction to finde all those names expressed in that large table of genealogies of scripture, lately gathered</span>. His other main theological publication was <span class="italic">A Clowd of Witnesses: and they the Holy Genealogies of the Sacred Scriptures</span> (1616), republished in 1620 and 1628.<br>
<br>Speed was also developing his historical and cartographic interests. In the 1590s, possibly at the behest of the bookseller Bonham Norton, he went to Ewelme and Wickham to gather genealogical information about Chaucer's descendants and arms, which were assembled round the portrait published in Thomas Speight's edition of Chaucer's works in 1598. In 1595 he published a wall map of biblical Canaan. By 1598 Speed had presented maps to Queen Elizabeth; in that year she appointed him a customs waiter, a position whose duties it is unlikely he carried out himself. Sir Fulke Greville probably recommended Speed for the post; Speed acknowledged his help and that of many others in his publications.<br>
<br>In 1600 Speed presented three of his maps to the Merchant Taylors' Company, which praised his skill as a map maker and genealogist. He collected material for <span class="italic">A Description of the Civill Warres of England</span>, published soon after as a broadside with a map dedicated to Sir Oliver St John. A reduction of a manuscript map, a four-sheet version was published in 1603, probably to celebrate the accession of James I. About this time Speed was responsible for three genealogical engravings, in 1605 and 1608 he was paid for making maps for the king, and about 1606 he was granted a coat of arms. He joined the circle which included members of the original Society of Antiquaries, and met scholars such as William Camden, Robert Cotton, and William Smith. These all helped Speed with his researches, being engaged in methodically studying the history of the British people and institutions. Speed participated; through Cotton, he developed an interest in coins, and was responsible for those in Camden's <span class="italic">Britannia</span> (1600). Speed was also compiling material for his <span class="italic">History of Great Britain</span> with its accompanying atlas volume, <span class="italic">The Theatre of the Empire of Great Britaine</span>. As Speed acknowledged, both text and maps were the result of industrious research and reading: from manuscript and printed sources of contemporary topographers such as Christopher Saxton, William Smith, John Norden, Sir Henry Spelman, and others; from Sir Robert Cotton's collection of manuscripts and maps; from records of crown officials in the shires; from field observation; and from illustrations of coins, antiquities, and armorial designs.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">The Theatre of the Empire of Great Britaine</span> followed the model of Ortelius's <span class="italic">Theatrum orbis terrarum</span>&#151;first published in English in 1606&#151;in its title and its format, with map sheets backed by historical and geographical texts and gazetteers of place names. This was the earliest English attempt at producing an atlas on a grand scale, with the first detailed maps of the provinces of Ireland, the first set of county maps consistently attempting to show the boundaries of territorial divisions, and the first truly comprehensive set of English town plans&#151;a notable contribution to British topography. Perhaps as many as fifty of the seventy-three towns had not previously been mapped, and about fifty-one of the plans were probably Speed's own work. In 1606 Speed might have been helped by his son John in surveying towns. A balance is struck between the modern and historical, with information placed on the edges of the maps about antiquarian remains, and sites and vignettes of famous battles, together with arms of princes and nobles. This additional information is one of the <span class="italic">Theatre</span>'s most significant contributions. Scotland is covered in less detail, as Timothy Pont was surveying there. Individual maps for the <span class="italic">Theatre</span> were prepared from about 1602, plates were engraved by Jodocus Hondius&#151;noted for his skills in decoration&#151;from 1607, George Humble was granted a privilege to print the <span class="italic">Theatre</span> for twenty-one years from 1608, and the <span class="italic">Theatre</span> and <span class="italic">History</span> were published together in 1611&#150;12. They were an immediate success: three new editions and issues of each appeared during Speed's lifetime, and a miniature version was first published about 1619&#150;20. The maps in the <span class="italic">Theatre</span> became the basis for subsequent folio atlases until the mid-eighteenth century.<br>
<br>In 1614 Speed negotiated on behalf of the Merchant Taylors' Company to renew its lease of the Mora prebendal estate from the chapter of St Paul's. In the following year he was granted the renewal of a lease of land at Moorfields, upon which he had built a new house valued at &pound;400, and which had been let in 1594 to George Sotherton. Three years later, in 1618, he secured a lease on adjoining land.<br>
<br>By 1625 Speed had lost his sight. Nevertheless, in 1627 he published <span class="italic">A Prospect of the most Famous Parts of the World</span>, which shared a title-page with the 1627 edition of the <span class="italic">Theatre</span>. The <span class="italic">Prospect</span>, the earliest world atlas by an Englishman (though not the first to be published in England), seems to have been primarily a commercial venture, in which Speed was probably not closely involved. It lacks the organization and methodical preparation of his earlier works, with thin and haphazard map coverage. The twenty-one maps are mostly Anglicized versions of examples engraved in Antwerp or Amsterdam; the text on the reverse draws heavily on Peter Heylyn's <span class="italic">Microcosmus</span> (1625, 1627).<br>
<br>Speed's wife died on 28 March 1628 and he followed her on 28 July 1629, aged seventy-seven. His funeral was held in St Giles Cripplegate: the sermon was preached by Josias Shute and a monument was put up in his memory. He left his leaseholds in St Giles Cripplegate and St Faith the Virgin to his sons Samuel, John, and Nathan, the profits from printing his <span class="italic">Genealogies</span> to his children in turn, and bequests to his descendants and the poor of the parishes where he held property.<br>

<a name="cosubject_26094"></a><span class="headword">John Speed</span>  (1595&#150;1640), <span class="occ">anatomist</span>, son of John and Susanna Speed, was born in London in January 1595 and entered Merchant Taylors' School in January 1604. He matriculated at St John's College, Oxford, on 30 October 1612, proceeding BA in 1616, MA in 1620, and BM and DM in 1628. In 1624 he resigned his fellowship and married Margaret Warner (<i>d</i>. 1685); they had five children, including <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26097/', "Samuel Speed (1630/31&#150;1682)")</script>. In 1632 he renewed the lease of his house in Moorfields, London, from the Merchant Taylors' Company and he became a member of Gray's Inn in 1633. Speed was the first anatomy lecturer in Oxford, and wrote a treatise which relates to two skeletons which he made and gave to his college library. He was also the author of &#145;Stonehenge: a Pastoral&#146;, acted in the college hall in 1635. He died in May 1640 and was buried in the college chapel, leaving a house in London and land in Oxford and its surroundings.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_26095"></a><span class="headword">John Speed</span>  (1628&#150;1711), <span class="occ">physician and poet</span>, was the second child and eldest son of John and Margaret Speed, and was born in Oxford on 4 November 1628 and baptized four days later. He attended Merchant Taylors' School, London, in 1640 and was elected a scholar at St John's College, Oxford, in June 1644. He became a fellow there in 1647, proceeded BA on 1 February 1648, but was ejected that May. He was invited to Southampton by Thomas Knollys of Grove Place near Nursling and stayed there until the Restoration, taking his MA in 1660 and BM and DM in 1666. Meanwhile, he had renewed from the Merchant Taylors' Company the lease he had inherited of land in Moorfields, London, in 1652. In 1667 Speed married Elizabeth Barker-Bernard (1628&#150;1678), widow of William Bernard, and moved to Southampton where he established a medical practice. They had four children. In 1680 he married Philadelphia Knollys (<i>d</i>. 1725), with whom he had seven children. His satirical poem, <span class="italic">Batt upon Batt: a poem upon the parts, patience and pains of B.K., clerk, poet, cutler of Holyrood-parish in Southampton &hellip; to which is annexed the vision</span>, was published in 1680; another six editions were issued, the last about 1740. He was mayor of Southampton in 1681 and again in 1694 and was granted a coat of arms. Speed died on 21 September 1711 and was buried in Holy Rood Church, Southampton, on the 27th. He left to his widow the tithes of Eling, which he had bought from Lord Henry Sandys, and his house in St Lawrence parish, Southampton, and bequests to her and his six children of &pound;3800, to the poor of the parishes of St Lawrence and Holy Rood, and to his servants. His grandson, John Speed (1703&#150;1781) MD, made extensive manuscript collections relating to Southampton.<br>
