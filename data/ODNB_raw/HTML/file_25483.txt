<span class="headword">Shute,  John</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1563), <span class="occ">writer on architecture</span>, was probably born in Cullompton, Devon. A painter&#150;stainer by training, he is presumably the &#145;John Shute paynter&#146; whose new house in Grantham Lane, London, is referred to in a deed dated 6 December 1550. In 1561 Shute was paid &pound;12 for making the Merchant Taylors' Company's pageant at the lord mayor's show. He may also be identified with the limner, or miniature portrait painter, named as Shoote in Richard Haydocke's <span class="italic">A Tracte Containing the Artes of Curious Paintinge Carvinge &amp; Buildinge</span> (1598, 126). But nothing else is known of his professional life, and no paintings have been attributed to him.<br>
<br>By Shute's own account, it was as a servant of John Dudley, first duke of Northumberland, that he was sent to Italy in 1550 &#145;ther to confer with the doinges of the skilful maisters in architectur, &amp; also to view such auncient Monumentes hereof as are yet extant&#146;  (Shute, dedication). His itinerary certainly included a stay in Rome, and he returned to England with drawings of buildings, sculptures, and paintings. Northumberland showed these to Edward VI, but it was not until 1563&#151;ten years after Northumberland's death&#151;that Shute published <span class="italic">The first and chief groundes of architecture used in all the auncient and famous monymentes: with a farther &amp; more ample discouse uppon the same, than hitherto hath been set out by any other</span>. Dedicated to Queen Elizabeth, it was the first architectural treatise published in Britain, and the first in the English language. A licence for printing it in London was granted to Thomas Marshe some time between 20 March and 22 July 1563. The title-page description of Shute as a &#145;Paynter and Archytecte&#146; need not imply that he ever practised architecture.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">The First and Chief Groundes</span> is principally concerned with the origins and proportions of the five classical orders of architecture (Tuscan, Doric, Ionic, Corinthian, and Composite), as established in a similar treatise by the Italian architect Sebastiano Serlio  (<span class="italic">Regole generali di architetura</span>, 1537). Shute relates each of these to the personification of an appropriate Greek deity. He also describes a sixth order, the Attic, citing Vitruvius, Pliny the elder, and the arch of Septimius Severus and the Pantheon in Rome, and throughout the treatise develops fresh interpretations of his subject, based on reading and observation. The text is illustrated with original woodcuts and metalcuts after Shute's own designs; if he executed the latter, which is plausible, he is the first English-born engraver whose name is known.<br>
<br>Scholars are divided as to the influence of Shute's treatise. He himself confessed that his subject was &#145;knit unto all the Mathematicalles&#146;  (Shute, preface): thus he was forced to introduce unfamiliar terminology into the English language, which would have made his text difficult to comprehend. There is hardly any surviving evidence that his designs were imitated: pilasters at Kimbolton Castle and Kirby Hall were copied from the title-page border design, but this woodcut was almost certainly not drawn by Shute. Only the Roman Doric order of the nearly contemporary screen at Middle Temple Hall has been positively linked to Shute's illustrations. On the other hand, his book was directed at a wide range of artisans besides architects, and it was popular enough to be abridged for a new edition dated 1587. There is good evidence to suggest that it was also reprinted or reissued in 1580 and 1584, although no copies of these printings can now be traced. Shute intended to publish more on architecture, but he died in the year <span class="italic">The First and Chief Groundes</span> was published. He was buried in the church of St Edmund, King and Martyr, Lombard Street, London. A verse epitaph giving his date of death as 25 September 1563 was recorded before its destruction in the great fire.<br>
