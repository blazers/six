<span class="headword">Malvery <span class="st"> [<em>married name </em>Mackirdy]</span>,  Olive Christian</span>  (1876/7&#150;1914), <span class="occ">social observer</span>, was the daughter of Thomas Malvery, a civil engineer working in India. Her mother was Jessie Symonds. No record of her birth has been located, and there is conflicting evidence about its date (the age given on her death certificate suggests 1876/7, that on the census return of 1901 1879/80, that on her marriage certificate 1881/2). She described herself as coming from an &#145;old Indian family&#146;  (Cox) and referred to India as her native land, though she also celebrated her Scottish ancestry which she derived from her grandmother, a Sinclair. Surviving photographs indicate that she was part Indian.<br>
<br>Malvery's parents separated when she was a child; her father, who was considerably older than her mother, failed to make a success of various business schemes. Olive and her brother were brought up in India by their maternal grandparents and received a good education. Raised an Anglican, she became involved in philanthropic work, raising money for Dr Barnardo's orphanages. She arrived in London from the Punjab about 1900 with the ambition to become a professional singer, and through financial assistance from a friend in India she was enabled to train at the Royal College of Music. In 1901, described as a student of music, she was lodging at St Mary's in the Isles of Scilly. Enterprising, hard-working, and a self-publicist, freely exploiting her Anglo-Indian ancestry, she came to prominence in London society by reciting what she called her &#145;Indian pictures&#146;, poems on Indian themes set to music. She gave her first performance at the Westbourne Park Institute while still at college. The press praised her work and &#145;<span class="italic">The Times</span> gave me a splendid notice&#146;  (Malvery, <span class="italic">A Year and a Day</span>, 83).<br>
<br>Malvery became best known for her investigative writing on the condition of working women and child labourers in early twentieth-century London. Driven by religious zeal and a social reforming impulse, evident in her philanthropic endeavours and her lecturing on behalf of the temperance cause in Britain, continental Europe, and North America, she set about a series of descriptions of the poor and destitute using information gathered by undercover participation and observation of their lives. In October 1904 she contributed a series of documentary articles on the London poor to <span class="italic">Pearson's Magazine</span>. She used her position as an outsider to reveal truths about England that were largely concealed from those born and brought up there.<br>
<br>Malvery claimed to have researched her articles by living in the &#145;seething parishes&#146; of London's poorest quarters  (Malvery, <span class="italic">The Soul Market</span>, 309). There she mixed, undetected, with thieves, tramps, costermongers, milliners, and match girls. Knowing that in such communities an outsider would be easily spotted, she somehow blended in: &#145;By maintaining a discreet silence, I managed to get through&#146;  (ibid., 134). Her foreign appearance, far from being a disadvantage, actually helped her, and on one occasion she gained the confidence of a coster woman who made direct reference to it:<blockquote>&#145;Is yer foreign?&#146; she asked. &#145;Not by half,&#146; I said: &#145;One can't help one's birth, but one can help one's heart.&#146; This sentiment pleased her extremely. Presently she asked me to mind her stall a minute, while she went and had a drink. While she was gone I sold two cabbages. (ibid.)</blockquote>Phonetic transcription of her dialogues with working poor helped to establish the authenticity of Malvery's account for a predominantly middle-brow, middle-class readership. But they also helped to entertain readers in a commercial publication.<br>
<br>Malvery's articles, published as <span class="italic">The Heart of Things</span>, were accompanied by photographs depicting her in her various guises&#151;barmaid, costermonger, flower girl&#151;the overall effect falling somewhere between serious social enquiry and play-acting. In 1905 she contributed two further articles to <span class="italic">Pearson's Magazine</span> on the alien question, by which was understood the settlement of Jewish immigrants from eastern Europe in the East End of London. The articles coincided with the parliamentary debate on a bill to restrict such immigration, and Malvery's unsympathetic depiction of the Jewish poor contrasts markedly with her earlier treatment of the cockney street people.<br>
<br>Malvery married, on 13 May 1905 at the parish church of St Margaret's, Westminster, Archibald Mackirdy (1856/7&#150;1911), the Scottish-born American consul to Muscat, the son of Robert Mackirdy, a banker of Rothesay. Mackirdy reportedly fell in love with his future wife after seeing her photograph in the press, and the newspapers published detailed accounts of her society wedding: one thousand working girls from the East End of London were invited, her attendants were coster girls from Hoxton, and, wearing an Indian dress, she was given away by the bishop of Bombay. Archibald Mackirdy was a supporter of the Salvation Army and shared his wife's concern for the welfare of London's destitute. They had two daughters and a son.<br>
<br>In 1906 Malvery published <span class="italic">The Soul Market</span>, a revised version of her first series of articles for <span class="italic">Pearson's Magazine</span>. It was dedicated &#145;To those who still have faith in humanity and a belief in God&#146;, and was written in the hope that it would encourage &#145;the suppression of some of the more hideous evils which I have in these pages only hinted at&#146;  (Malvery, <span class="italic">The Soul Market</span>, 320). She later claimed that <span class="italic">The Soul Market</span>, which went through several editions and established her as a social commentator and reformer, was &#145;the first book that roused the public to shame and sympathy &hellip; To-day there are a great many Missions which have been founded by people who were stirred to work by that book&#146;  (Malvery, <span class="italic">A Year and a Day</span>, 18). She took the credit, too, for stimulating the debate on night shelters for destitute women and girls. Profits from her first book, which was a considerable commercial success, and donations from readers established housing for homeless women in London. Her two shelters were later run under the auspices of the Salvation Army and the Church Army. She also ran a girls' club in Hoxton, the Girls' Guild of Good Life. Her response to the appalling working conditions which she witnessed in sweatshop trades was to form a Consumers' League with a white list of firms whose goods were produced under humane conditions.<br>
<br>At one level Malvery's investigative work follows in the tradition of Henry Mayhew, General Booth, and Beatrice Webb, but its theatricality and commercialism set it apart. As a review of <span class="italic">The Soul Market</span> in the <span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span> observed: &#145;Miss Malvery writes with a running pen &hellip; The book should attract the ordinary reader; but there is much within its cover that will be valuable to the specialist investigating modern conditions of city life&#146;  (Malvery, <span class="italic">Baby Toilers</span>, frontispiece). <span class="italic">The Soul Market</span> was rapidly followed by <span class="italic">Baby Toilers</span> (1907), in which Malvery and her publishers capitalized on her earlier success. She hoped that her expos&eacute; of child labour would persuade parliament to legislate to end this abuse.<br>
<br>Malvery understood the social stratification within the London poor and documented the occupational snobbery that differentiated factory girls, costermongers, and domestic servants. If she perhaps did not have the familiarity that she pretended with her street subjects, she exposed serious social evils to a wide public view. But there was also a harshly practical, eugenicist side to her philanthropic concern for the poor.<blockquote>These people are all kept chiefly by the middle classes, and the awful result is while they breed and increase like rabbits, the women who might give wholesome and healthy children to the nation are being disqualified for maternal duties by the heavy burdens which society and philanthropy lay upon them. (Malvery, <span class="italic">The Soul Market</span>, 314)</blockquote>Drunken, idle, wife-beating men were her principal target, and she recommended for them a sharp exposure to the rigours of military discipline. Instead of taxing those who worked to subsidize those who did not, she argued, &#145;it would be better to compel men to work for the support of themselves and their families&#146;  (ibid., 317). She blamed the difficulties faced by boroughs such as Poplar on &#145;extravagant local government&#146; rather than under-investment  (ibid.).<br>
<br>Such views became more strident in Malvery's later work. In <span class="italic">A Year and a Day</span> (1912) she regarded processions of the unemployed as &#145;simply contemptible; one is not even sorry for the bleary, lazy creatures who make up most of these sad &#147;shows&#148;&#146;  (Malvery, <span class="italic">A Year and a Day</span>, 61). Charitable work, she reflected, had &#145;so far saved us from dreadful outbreaks of desperate ill-used creatures&#146;  (p. 39). She had no sympathy for the organized labour movement or socialism, believing that the latter:<blockquote>has nothing to offer women except to propose that they should be made breeding cows, and that their young should be fathered by the State instead of by the animals who bred them &hellip; If you meet Socialists and listen to their talk, you will be amazed at the low value they place on women. (p. 35)</blockquote>She herself belonged to a number of women's organizations, including the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/96079', "Pioneer Club")</script> for women and the Women Journalists' Club.<br>
<br>In 1912 Malvery published <span class="italic">The White Slave Market</span> with William Nicholas Willis, a former member of the Australian parliament and newspaperman of doubtful probity, who provided firsthand knowledge from east Asia. This harrowing book describes the enslavement to prostitution of girls in various countries, laying bare &#145;the nauseating details of this horrible traffic in white women&#146;  (Malvery and Willis, <span class="italic">White Slave Market</span>, 289). It was a traffic, they pointedly observed, that was carried on in Christian countries, and having put their case before the British public they hoped that parliament would be made to act.<br>
<br>Partly because of the circumstances surrounding the death of her husband, in 1911, Malvery was bitterly prejudiced against the medical profession. She made an exception of women doctors, and was determined to do all that she could to get their work recognized, but her animus against the majority of male doctors knew no bounds. It led her to consider the merits of Christian Science, but she was never fully converted. Instead charitable work, which she pursued with even greater intensity, provided a way out of the personal anguish which she felt after the death of her husband. Her final project was to edit a periodical, <span class="italic">Mackirdy's Weekly</span>, published from January 1914 to the outbreak of war in August. It was pledged to the causes she espoused&#151;practical Christianity, a living wage for all workers, protection for children, and citizen rights for all those who paid taxes or carried out civic duties, regardless of gender. As a supporter of the constitutional movement for women's suffrage she wrote a series of articles in January and February 1914 attacking suffragette militancy, denouncing the resort to violence as a sign of desperation, and exposing the autocratic way in which Christabel Pankhurst ran the suffragette organization.<br>
<br>Suffering from cancer, Malvery died at her home, Iden, Woodcote Valley Road, Purley, Surrey, on 29 October 1914, aged thirty-seven. At an inquest on 31 October 1914 the cause of death was recorded as &#145;misadventure, veronal poisoning&#146;  (d. cert.), in effect an overdose of sedatives. She was buried at Kensal Green cemetery. Her will, drawn up shortly before her death, made provision for the upbringing of her three young children by her devoted secretary, Charlotte Cottrill, at a property owned by Malvery at Reigate, Surrey, named Rahat Munzil, or Underhill. She also requested that the base of the gravestone over her and her husband's grave should bear the inscription, &#145;Who serves his country and his neighbour earns not wealth but fellowship with God.&#146;<br>
