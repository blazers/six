<span class="headword">Spens,  James, of Wormiston</span>, Baron Spens in the Swedish nobility  (<em>d.</em> 1632), <span class="occ">diplomat and army officer in the Swedish service</span>, was the eldest son of three known children of David Spens, laird of Wormiston (<i>d</i>. 1571), and his wife, Margaret Lermonth (<i>d</i>. in or after 1574), daughter of the laird of Dairsie, Fife. He was probably born during the 1560s, but little is known of his early years and education. His father, a leading supporter of Queen Mary's party, was killed at Stirling Castle on 4 September 1571 during a botched attempt to abduct the regent, Matthew, fourth earl of Lennox. As punishment the Spens estates centring on Wormiston House near St Andrews were confiscated and awarded to the queen's gaoler, Patrick Lindsay, sixth Lord Byres. In 1574 or soon afterwards James's mother married Sir John Anstruther of that ilk and it was largely thanks to his standing at court that the family returned to grace. The young Spens slowly reacquired the family lands and perhaps the office of constable of Crail, which had been in his family for generations, but he never regained Wormiston.<br>
<br>In 1589 Spens's sister Lucretia married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9843/', "Patrick Forbes of Corse")</script>, an influential theologian and future bishop of Aberdeen (1618&#150;35). About this time Spens himself married Agnes Durie, with whom he had at least four daughters and two sons who survived into adulthood. Spens's status was improving: in February 1593 he attended privy council sessions at St Andrews, and in 1594 and again in 1607 was provost (mayor) of the burgh of Crail, Fife.<br>
<br>On 29 June 1598 Spens was one of eleven &#145;gentilmen adventuraris&#146; from Fife contracted by James VI to &#145;plant policy and civilisation in the hitherto most barberous Isle of Lewis&#146;  (<span class="italic">Reg. PCS</span>, <i>1592&#150;9</i>, 462&#150;3). The project&#151;similar to the plantation of Ulster&#151;was expected to bring the king rental income by 1600, though the financial risk fell on the adventurers. In November 1598 they landed with 500&#150;600 troops, built a fortified camp near Stornoway, and began to &#145;civilize&#146; the islanders, not always by peaceful methods. By December 1601 a bitter dispute had erupted with the local Macleods, and when Spens attempted to capture Neil Macleod he was ambushed and nearly sixty colonists were killed; the settlement in Stornoway was burnt and Spens was kept hostage until the colonists had abandoned the island. A second colonization attempt was made in summer 1605, supported by royal troops; houses were built and crops planted, but raiding by the islanders and financial problems again forced the settlers to leave. A third attempt in 1609 came to the same end. Dispirited, Spens and the two other surviving shareholders sold their rights to the island in 1610 to Lord Kintail for 10,000 merks Scots.<br>
<br>By this time, Spens's attentions had switched to Sweden. In October 1605, following a costly defeat by the Poles at Kirchholm in Latvia, Karl IX of Sweden commissioned Spens and his younger brother David to raise 1600 mercenary foot and 600 horse in Scotland. Due to finance and shipping problems the levy was only partly completed by 1608, but Spens accepted a further commission in 1609 for 1000 foot and 500 horse. This time recruitment fared better, largely because the British authorities welcomed the opportunity of ridding Ireland of troublemakers after the Nine Years' War. In February 1610 Spens's Scots, Irish, and English recruits marched from Finland across the frozen ice of the Bothnian Gulf to join a Russian-led army, only to be defeated by the Poles at Klushino, near Moscow, on 4 July 1610 <span class="smallcap">NS</span>; weeks later the Poles marched unopposed into Moscow. The Russians were quick to blame their defeat on the treachery of Spens's recruits, although one English officer complained that the Swedes had traded the British soldiers to the Russians &#145;as horses are in Smythfield&#146;  (<span class="italic">EngHR</span>, 29, 1914, 246&#150;56). Spens was technically colonel of the British, but had not joined them in the field and escaped blame.<br>
<br>Spens's shuttling between Sweden and Britain acquired a diplomatic character. He was also an indispensable courier for correspondence between Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden and Henry, prince of Wales, and their younger brothers Charles Phillip and Charles, duke of York. No later than 1609 Spens was knighted, and from May 1609 he became Britain's special ambassador to Sweden. As he was returning to Sweden in March 1611 from a mission to recruit 3000 Scottish and Dutch mercenaries the Danes arrested him half a mile into Swedish soil and killed one of his party. The incident outraged the Swedes and contributed to the outbreak of the Kalmar War in April 1611. Spens was also instrumental in bringing the conflict to a close: in peace talks at Kn&auml;red, brokered by James I, Spens represented Sweden, while his stepfather's grandson <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/63416/', "Sir Robert Anstruther (1578&#150;1644/5?)")</script> acted for Denmark. On 18 January 1613 the two Scots reported to James I that peace had been agreed &#145;chiefly thanks to their own abilities&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP Venice</span>, <i>1610&#150;13</i>, xxix).<br>
<br>Appointed Sweden's ambassador to Britain in December 1613, Spens spent several years in London channelling British policy towards Denmark and Poland in favour of Sweden. He intended to return to Sweden in 1618, and even received diplomatic instructions in 1619, but his departure was repeatedly delayed. He finally reached Sweden in spring 1621 as Britain's special ambassador to Sweden. Gustavus Adolphus, who had embarked on a string of attacks on Polish possessions across the Baltic, chose Spens as his chief recruiting master for soldiers from Scotland. Despite Gustavus Adolphus's complaints about nepotism among the Scots, Spens was allowed a free hand and did not hesitate to install kith and kin in plum jobs. In 1624 Spens obtained permission to raise a regiment of 1200 Britons for Sweden, and passed the colonelcy to his eldest son, also James. Of the two regiments which he was to levy in 1627 he gave one to <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/23084/', "Sir James Ramsay")</script>, husband of his daughter Isobel (married in Scotland in 1619). Another daughter, Cecily, married another famous &#145;Swedish&#146; Scot, General-Major Sir David Drummond. There were also blood ties (difficult to disentangle) to officers of the Monypenny family. More than once Spens's standing with Gustavus Adolphus saved his prot&eacute;g&eacute;s. On one occasion Colonel Ramsay had been shackled in irons after &#145;hard words&#146; with the Swedish king, and &#145;if not for his father-in-law, &hellip; his life had been forfeit&#146;  (I. Hoppe, <span class="italic">Geschichte des ersten schwedischen&#150;polnischen Krieges in Preussen</span>, 1887, 419). Nevertheless the Swedish king and the chancellor, Axel Oxenstierna, developed a deep affection for their Scottish soldiers and for Spens in particular.<br>
<br>As Sweden's wars began to merge with the Thirty Years' War in Germany, Spens's diplomatic remit shifted to the European mainland. His trips from London to Stockholm usually followed a route via The Hague, Hamburg, and Copenhagen, during which he called on notables including the family of the count palatine of the Rhine, exiled in the Netherlands, and Sir Robert Anstruther, now Britain's main representative in Denmark, with whom he often swapped royal letters and information before it was made public.<br>
<br>In 1624 Spens became involved in protestant attempts to organize a grand alliance against the Habsburgs, a project that depended on British financial commitment. Spens's main remit was to obtain for Sweden the leadership of the alliance's army, but although constantly reporting back from the Netherlands he played a secondary role in the diplomacy. His knowledge of languages was limited, and he preferred to write in turgidly phrased Scots (sometimes deliberately in lieu of a code) which often required translation. He was soon outwitted by Robert Anstruther, who obtained English promises of a subsidy for a Danish-led intervention in Germany. Hopes for a grand alliance faded further in 1625 when a conference in The Hague was postponed after the deaths of Maurice of Nassau and James I. When Charles I came to power he came under the influence of the duke of Buckingham who favoured war with Spain rather than involvement in Germany. Spens reported Buckingham's &#145;papist&#146; machinations with displeasure to the Swedish monarch, amid perceptive observations on the rift between king and parliament.<br>
<br>Though Spens was a strict Calvinist, he was not opposed to a religious settlement to the Thirty Years' War. Among his prot&eacute;g&eacute;s were two champions of ecumenism: his one-time secretary, John Durie (possibly a relative of his wife), and his chaplain, Eleazar Borthwick (sent in 1628 by Spens's brother-in-law, the bishop of Aberdeen). Both got hearings with the Swedish monarch thanks to Spens, and went on to have considerable influence in Europe.<br>
<br>On 28 April 1627, as reward for his services to Sweden, Spens was made Baron Spens, of Orreholm near Skaraborg in V&auml;sterg&ouml;tland. The jealousy of a Swedish rival, Riksr&aring;d Johan Skytte, meant the grant was not officially countersigned until early 1629. On 23 September 1627, as ambassador-extraordinary from Charles I, Spens personally presented Gustavus Adolphus with the Order of the Garter and St George Cross in an elaborate ceremony in the presence of English heralds at Dirschau in Polish Prussia.<br>
<br>In March 1629 Spens arrived in London to raise troops for Gustavus Adolphus's invasion of Germany. He shipped to Polish Prussia 3000 recruits in three new regiments and from about July 1629 was appointed honorary general over all the English and Scots in Swedish service.<br>
<br>Early in 1631 the death of his son James nearly killed Spens, who complained of a &#145;deadlie illnesse&#146; in his will drafted in Stockholm on 31 May  (Spens, 51). His health improved after his second wife, Margretta Forath, gave birth to a son, Jakob (their first son, Axel, had been named for the Swedish chancellor). By 3 September 1631 Spens was well enough to join Gustavus Adolphus in Germany as his legate to James Hamilton, marquess of Hamilton's 6000-strong &#145;English army&#146;. Having landed near Stettin in August, Hamilton's grandiose goal was to recover the palatinate, but he lacked the financial support of Charles I and the trust of Gustavus Adolphus, and his force quickly melted away. Spens could do little to help: often complaining of gout the last of his increasingly scrawly official letters, dated 1 September 1632, was to request Hamilton's presence before the Swedish king on the winding up of his command.<br>
<br>Spens continued to follow the Swedish court in Germany, and reassumed the colonelcy of his son's old Scots regiment (though there is no record of him serving in the field with it, nor with any other of the units he nominally commanded). He was in Frankfurt am Main when Gustavus Adolphus was killed at L&uuml;tzen on 16 November and he himself died at Frankfurt on the morning of 27 November, apparently at the shock of the news. His body was transported to Stettin, where it remained for half a year before being shipped to Stockholm; he is said to have been buried in Riddarholm church, Stockholm, the resting-place of Swedish royalty. He was survived by his wife, who married, in 1637, Hugh Hamilton, a colonel in Swedish service, later Baron Hamilton of Glenlawley. Spens was succeeded in his barony by his son William. The senior branch of the family was introduced into the Riddarhus (house of nobles) in 1635 but died out in 1665. A junior branch, elevated to greve (count) from 1712, survived in Sweden until the end of the twentieth century.<br>
<br>Spens made a far bolder impression overseas than in Britain. He was the leading figure in the diaspora of Scots who abandoned their impoverished homeland for Sweden's rising star and in shipping in excess of 10,000 Britons to serve in the Swedish army made a significant contribution to the building of Sweden as a great power. Despite his status as double ambassador, there can be little doubt that Spens eventually became more Swedish than British in his affiliations.<br>
