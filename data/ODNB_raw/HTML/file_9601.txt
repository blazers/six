<span class="headword">Fitzherbert,  Alleyne</span>, Baron St Helens  (1753&#150;1839), <span class="occ">diplomatist</span>, was born on 1 March 1753 at a house called St Helens in Derby, the fifth and youngest son of William Fitzherbert (1712&#150;1772), MP, of Tissington Hall, near Ashbourne in Derbyshire and his wife, Mary, daughter of Littleton Poyntz Meynell, of Bradley, near Ashbourne, and Judith, daughter of Thomas Alleyne of Barbados. Both his parents were good friends of Samuel Johnson, who said of his mother that &#145;she had the best understanding he ever met with in any human being&#146;  (J. Boswell, <span class="italic">Life of Johnson</span>, ed. P. Rogers, 1980, 59). William Fitzherbert became overwhelmed by anxiety about his financial affairs and committed suicide on 2 January 1772. Fitzherbert was educated at Derby grammar school (1763) and at Eton College (1766&#150;70) before matriculating from St John's College, Cambridge, in June 1770. At Cambridge he took his BA in the mathematical tripos in 1774 and received his MA in 1777. After graduating he received a scholarship from the university to travel in France and Italy during 1775, and soon after that he embarked upon a diplomatic career; in April 1777 he was appointed minister resident in Brussels, a post he held until 1783, in the last year as minister-plenipotentiary. In 1782 he was also appointed minister-plenipotentiary to negotiate the peace agreement at Paris between Britain and France, Spain, and the United Provinces at the end of the American War of Independence. It should be noted, however, that while Fitzherbert conducted negotiations in Paris between August 1782 and June 1783 with the French representative the comte de Vergennes, the substantive negotiations which brought the war to an end were actually conducted in England between the prime minister, Lord Shelburne, and Vergennes's deputy G&eacute;rard de Rayneval in late 1782.<br>
<br>Fitzherbert's next posting was to the court of Catherine the Great at St Petersburg, a position he held from October 1783 until August 1787. Perhaps the most important aspect of this posting was his role in the failed attempts to negotiate a trade agreement with the Russians. On 18 March 1785 he alerted ministers in London to the fact that the commercial treaty of 1766 between Britain and Russia would reach the end of its twenty-year duration in the following year. In November 1785 he was sent full powers to negotiate, and early in February 1786 he proposed to the Russian government a renewal of the 1766 agreement, with some minor modifications. The Russians, for their part, however, were interested in renegotiating the terms of the treaty more fundamentally, and in particular they wished to obtain some relaxation of the <span class="roman">Navigation Acts</span> in their favour. They responded with a paper of their own which ignored Fitzherbert's proposals and made a number of strongly worded demands for British concessions on navigation and the issue of the rights of neutral trade in times of war.<br>
<br>It was as much the tone of the Russian response as its content which alienated ministers in London, and they set their faces against any concessions to the Russians, although Fitzherbert, with his greater knowledge of Russian attitudes and intentions, was aware that if the negotiations were to be successful some concessions to the Russian position would be inevitable. The Russian proposals were forwarded to London by Fitzherbert on 20 February 1786, but no official reply was made to the Russians by the ministers in London until 17 November 1786, owing largely to a combination of ministerial complacency and the need to attend to what ministers regarded as more pressing business. The ministerial response, consisting of six lengthy dispatches to Fitzherbert, amounted to a rejection of Russian demands, which coupled with the lengthy delay only exasperated the Russians further. One of the strategic aims of the British negotiating position was to weaken Russian links with France, but, partly as a result of the failing negotiations with Britain, the Russians signed a new commercial treaty with France in January 1787.<br>
<br>By early 1787, therefore, the negotiations between Britain and Russia for a commercial agreement had to all intents and purposes ground to a halt, and the existing treaty finally lapsed in April 1787, having been temporarily extended for the duration of the negotiations. Fitzherbert wrote to the foreign secretary Carmarthen claiming that &#145;though a well-wisher to the negotiation, I saw plainly from the first that it could not possibly succeed&#146; and asking for home leave, &#145;having now no business of importance to transact&#146;  (Ehrman, <span class="italic">British Government</span>, 111 and n. 1). Fitzherbert's last major task as ambassador was to accompany Catherine the Great on a tour of the Crimea during the summer of 1787 before leaving Russia in August.<br>
<br>In November 1787 Fitzherbert was appointed chief secretary for Ireland under the marquess of Buckingham and as a consequence was sworn of the privy council. In 1788 he was returned to the Irish House of Commons as MP for Carysfort, and he held the seat until 1790. He ended his chief secretaryship in March 1789, and was thereupon sent as ambassador to The Hague (June 1789 to March 1790), where he had to deal with the difficult issues raised both by the possibilities of French support for the Dutch patriot movement and by resistance to Habsburg rule in the Austrian Netherlands to the south.<br>
<br>In May 1790 Fitzherbert was transferred to Madrid specifically to deal with the complex Nootka Sound affair, which almost brought Britain and Spain to war. The affair had its long-term origins in colonial rivalry between Britain and Spain on the Pacific coast of North America, but its immediate origins lay in the Spanish seizure of British ships and men at Nootka Sound, Vancouver Island, in 1789. Fitzherbert was closely involved in the complex diplomatic and military manoeuvrings which ensued. By the judicious use of military threats, he was able to induce the Spanish foreign minister Floridablanca to sign, on 24 July 1790, a declaration to return the ships and compensate their owners. In a counter-declaration signed by Fitzherbert the British agreed to accept the Spanish offer. Crucially, however, neither side would give way on the larger and more fundamental issues relating to their respective rights on the Pacific coast of North America, and the next phase of the negotiations was devoted to these aspects of the affair. In August Fitzherbert was instructed by the foreign secretary, the duke of Leeds, to demand of the Spanish that they renounce any claims to sovereignty over the coastline. Fitzherbert presented his demands to Floridablanca on 8 September 1790 and received a reply the following week in which Floridablanca accepted the British proposals in principle but left the details imprecise.<br>
<br>Fitzherbert was optimistic that this might be the basis of a settlement but, as in the case of the Russian trade negotiations, ministers in London felt otherwise. Imbued with confidence owing to the completion of British naval mobilization in preparation for possible war with Spain, the British ministers responded to the Spanish proposal by sending Fitzherbert two alternative drafts of a treaty which were to be presented to the Spanish as an ultimatum and which reached Fitzherbert on 12 October 1790. Despite resistance from other ministers in the Spanish government, Floridablanca was eventually forced to sign a convention with Fitzherbert on 28 October in which Spain effectively abandoned her claims to sovereignty over the north-west coast of North America. Fitzherbert, as he put it, &#145;negotiating with 60 sail of the line at one's back&#146;  (Black, 254), had played an effective role in forcing the Spanish to back down twice, once over the specifics of the Nootka Sound incident and again over their claims to sovereignty in the Pacific. His contribution was recognized when he was raised to the Irish peerage as Baron St Helens on 26 January 1791.<br>
<br>In October 1790, while the final convention with Spain over Nootka Sound was being negotiated, Fitzherbert had suggested to the Spanish the possibility of a more comprehensive treaty. The idea languished until July 1791, when Floridablanca took up the invitation and serious negotiations began. These negotiations, which initially focused on the possiblities of a commercial agreement, were hampered by Floridablanca's fall from power in February 1792 and his replacement by a noted Anglophobe, the Count d'Aranda. By mid-1792 the negotiations for a commercial agreement were effectively abandoned. The deteriorating international situation, however, evident in the outbreak in 1792 of the war against revolutionary France (which Britain finally entered in early 1793), made the Spanish more receptive to the notion of an alliance with Britain. In March 1793 St Helens was able to negotiate an alliance with Spain, although in commercial matters it included only terms relating to trade during a time of war.<br>
<br>During the period from June 1792 to March 1793 St Helens's poor health had necessitated a period of absence from his post at Madrid, and health concerns were behind his decision finally to leave Madrid in early 1794. In April 1794 he returned as ambassador to The Hague, from where he was forced to flee in January 1795 in the face of the advancing French armies. Lord Malmesbury, who visited The Hague in May 1794, described St Helens as &#145;very friendly, but <i>insouciant</i> as to business and not attentive enough for his post&#146;  (Harris, 3.98) and this perception of St Helens's declining abilities may lie behind the fact that it was six years before he received another diplomatic posting. On his return from The Hague, however, he appears to have been warmly welcomed in ministerial social circles. George Canning, who met him for the first time in April 1795, described St Helens as &#145;an able and well-informed man&#146; and noted that he &#145;derived much instruction from his conversation&#146;, adding none the less that &#145;[h]is manners are cold&#151;but perfectly gentlemanlike&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letter-Journal</span>, 239). On 16 July 1797 a fire at St Helens's London house burnt it to the ground, destroying everything he possessed.<br>
<br>In April 1801 St Helens was sent as ambassador to St Petersburg in the aftermath of the accession of Alexander I. He negotiated a convention (17 June 1801) with Russia regarding maritime rights, for which he was rewarded with a United Kingdom peerage, becoming Baron St Helens of St Helens on 31 July 1801. He successfully negotiated the accession of both Denmark (October 1801) and Sweden (March 1802) to the Anglo-Russian convention before ill health once again forced him to leave his post in August 1802: indeed as early as July 1801, Lord Hawkesbury, the foreign secretary, was informing George III that St Helens's health would necessitate his return from Russia. In April 1803 St Helens left the diplomatic service with a pension of &pound;2300 p.a. and became, somewhat reluctantly owing to the expense it would entail, a lord of the bedchamber; he held this post until January 1820 and again under George IV from July 1820 until 1830.<br>
<br>Baron St Helens died on 19 February 1839 at his home at 19 Grafton Street and was buried on 26 February in the Kensal Green cemetery. His peerages became extinct on his death.<br>
<br>His eldest brother, <a name="cosubject_9607"></a><span class="headword">Sir William Fitzherbert</span>, first baronet  (1748&#150;1791), <span class="occ">lawyer and legal writer</span>, was born probably at Tissington Hall, near Ashbourne, Derbyshire, on 27 May 1748. He was educated at Westminster School and St John's College, Cambridge, whence he graduated MA (1770). He was called to the bar from Lincoln's Inn, where he had chambers opposite Jeremy Bentham. Although Bentham had forgotten it, the two had been schoolmates at Westminster, and William and, through him, his brother Alleyne became close friends of Bentham and his circle; Alleyne referred to Bentham later as &#145;the Newton of legislation&#146;  (<span class="italic">Correspondence of Jeremy Bentham</span>, 1.362&#150;3 n. 2). William Fitzherbert married Sarah (<i>d</i>. 1795), daughter of William Perrin of Jamaica, on 14 October 1777; they had two sons, Anthony (1779&#150;1798) and Henry (1783&#150;1858). He served as recorder of Derby and as gentleman usher and gentleman usher-in-extraordinary to George III, receiving a baronetcy in recognition of his services on 22 January 1784. As a consequence of a quarrel with the lord chamberlain, the marquess of Salisbury, he resigned his position at court soon after this. He was the author of a number of works on legal and other matters. He died on 30 July 1791 at Tissington Hall.<br>
