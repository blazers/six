<span class="headword">Melvill,  Henry</span>  (1798&#150;1871), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, fifth son of Philip Melvill (1760&#150;1811), an officer in the army, who was lieutenant-governor of Pendennis Castle from 1797 until 1811, and his wife, Elizabeth Carey (1770&#150;1845), daughter of Peter Dobree of Beauregard, Guernsey, was born in Pendennis Castle, Cornwall, on 14 September 1798, and became a sizar of St John's College, Cambridge, in October 1817. After migrating to Peterhouse he passed as second wrangler in 1821, and was a fellow and tutor there from 1822 to 1829. He graduated BA in 1821, MA in 1824, and BD in 1836. From 1829 to 1843 he served as incumbent of Camden Chapel, Camberwell, Surrey, and was appointed by the duke of Wellington chaplain to the Tower of London in 1840. Early in 1844 he became principal of the East India College, Haileybury, holding the post until the college was closed, by the legislation which followed the Indian mutiny, on 7 December 1857. By then, Melvill was already (from 21 April 1856) a canon residentiary of St Paul's Cathedral; he was also rector of Barnes, Surrey, 1863&#150;71. He was, in addition, Golden lecturer at St Margaret's, Lothbury, 1850&#150;56, and one of the chaplains to Queen Victoria from 13 June 1853.<br>
<br>Melvill for many years had the reputation of being &#145;the most popular preacher in London&#146; and one of the greatest rhetoricians of his time. First at Camden Chapel, then at St Margaret's, and later at St Paul's, large crowds of people attended his sermons. These generally occupied three-quarters of an hour, but such was the rapidity of his utterance that he spoke as much in that time as an ordinary preacher would have done in an hour. His delivery was earnest and animated, without distinctive gesticulation; his voice was clear and flexible, while his emphatic pronunciation and his hurried manner of speaking impressed the hearers with a conviction of his sincerity. He had a &#145;wonderful faculty of what may be called magnetizing or fascinating the ear&#146;  (Prestige, 154), and he was known as the evangelical Chrysostom. But his sermons lacked simplicity and directness of style, and his ornate phraseology, happy analogies, and smoothly balanced sentences appealed more directly to the literary than to the spiritual sense. His views were evangelical, and he was a zealous parish priest. Melvill published many volumes of his sermons, several of which went through numerous editions. These were chiefly of his Cambridge sermons and those delivered at St Margaret's, Lothbury (one volume of the latter, <span class="italic">Forty Eight Sermons</span> (1850), was published without his permission).<br>
<br>Melvill died, rather rich, at 2 Residentiary Houses, Amen Corner, London, on 9 February 1871, and was buried in St Paul's Cathedral on 15 February. His widow, Margaret Alice, daughter of Captain Richard Jennings RN, died on 18 April 1878, aged seventy-three, leaving a daughter Edith, who married Clement Alexander Midleton.<br>
