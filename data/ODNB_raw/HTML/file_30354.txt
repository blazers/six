</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Aird, Sir  John</span>, first baronet  (1833&#150;1911), <span class="occ">civil engineering contractor</span>, was born on 3 December 1833 in Greenwich, the second son of eight children of John Aird (1800&#150;1876), contractor, and Agnes (<i>d</i>. 1869), daughter of Charles Bennett of Lambeth. His grandfather Robert Aird went south from Fortrose, Ross-shire, early in the nineteenth century, and worked for Hugh McIntosh, the civil engineering contractor. After Robert's death in an earth fall on the Regent's Canal works, John Aird senior continued to work for McIntosh until 1827. McIntosh had a large number of pipe-laying contracts for the metropolitan gas companies, and this probably helped Aird obtain a position with the Phoenix Gas Company, initially as an inspector and subsequently as manager of their works in Greenwich. During the 1840s he took an increasing number of private contracts, and in 1848 left the Phoenix Gas Company which, however, continued to provide him with pipe-laying work. John Aird junior, who was privately educated in Greenwich and Southgate, joined his father when he was eighteen; his elder brother, Charles, was also part of the firm, which became known as John Aird &amp; Sons. Aird senior had obtained contracts for pipe-laying and building work for the Great Exhibition of 1851, and one of Aird junior's first tasks was to assist in its demolition and the re-erection of the Crystal Palace at Sydenham.<br>
<br>On 6 September 1855 Aird married Sarah (1835&#150;1909), daughter of Benjamin Smith, a Deptford wharfinger. They had two sons and seven daughters. Three of the daughters were to marry into families with civil engineering links. The eldest, Sarah, married Basil Pym Ellis who eventually became a partner in the firms of Aird &amp; Sons and Lucas Brothers. Jessie, the second, married George Neill Abernethy, and Kate, the third, Alfred William Thomas Bean. In the 1850s the activities of John Aird &amp; Sons expanded rapidly. Building on mains laying experience for the east London waterworks in the previous decade the Airds obtained contracts for the new waterworks of the Southwark and Vauxhall, Grand Junction, and west Middlesex water companies near Hampton in the 1850s. On the continent, where British-owned utility companies were often involved, the Airds began mains laying in the Netherlands, before building waterworks in Rotterdam, Amsterdam, Hamburg, Altona, Schiedam, Brunswick, Riga, Archangel, and Moscow. In Copenhagen, in addition to the waterworks, John Aird senior built the first major outfall sewer, which nearly bankrupted the firm. The Airds formed a partnership with Charles Fox and Thomas Crompton to establish the Berlin Water Company. Aird's brother-in-law Henry Gill was the engineer. Alexander, John Aird's younger brother, was the contractor's agent on many of these schemes, and remained in Germany for forty years.<br>
<br>The firm continued to work on gasworks contracts throughout the 1850s. John Aird senior took shares in the Crystal Palace Gas Company, whose works were built in 1854; Charles increasingly took responsibility for this side of the family's business. John Aird junior worked on a variety of schemes at this time, including South Staffordshire waterworks, Berlin waterworks, Palermo gasworks, and contracts in Ottawa, Brazil, and Singapore.<br>
<br>In the 1860s the Airds began railway contracting. In the Thames Valley Railway they took an entrepreneurial role with nearly 90 per cent of the share capital. They also became increasingly involved with other contractors. In addition to waterworks schemes at Calcutta, with Brassey and Wythes, and works with Peto and Betts in Cagliari, they partnered Sir John Kelk in the construction of Millwall docks (1863&#150;8), which they helped finance. Their most lasting connection was with Charles Thomas and Thomas Lucas, who shared their premises in Belvedere Road, Lambeth, in the 1860s.<br>
<br>The Lucas brothers had begun their careers with Sir Samuel Morton Peto before branching off on their own, particularly as building contractors. In the wake of the Overend Gurney banking failure in 1866 both Airds and Lucas Brothers were ideally placed to fill the vacuum left by the bankruptcy of many of the leading contracting firms. Between them they completed many of Peto's contracts. From 1870 the two families operated as three firms: Lucas Brothers, who carried out building works, Lucas and Aird, who carried out railway and civil engineering contracts, and John Aird &amp; Sons, who continued to specialize in water and gas contracts. Aird took increasing responsibility within the family firm at this time, having supervised the massive Beckton gasworks contract, completed in 1870. Following his father's death the firm was reorganized. In early 1877 it was in serious financial trouble with the Nottingham and Melton contract for the Midland Railway, and Lucas Brothers had to rescue it. Charles Aird retired, leaving Aird to continue with the Lucas brothers. Although their junior in years, his strength of personality made him a dominant force within the firms.<br>
<br>Over twenty years the various firms undertook more than seventy contracts, many on a grand scale, such as the Royal Albert and Tilbury docks schemes in the Port of London, Hodbarrow sea wall, works on the Midland, Metropolitan, and Great Eastern railways, including Liverpool Street Station, and an extensive railway system around Hull docks. Docks were also built at Portsmouth, Southampton, Newport, and Newhaven. They continued to build gasworks, with further extensions at Beckton, and their waterworks involvement included Thirlmere aqueduct for Manchester, part of the Elan valley aqueduct for Birmingham, and several reservoirs for the East London Waterworks Company.<br>
<br>As Aird's sons became old enough they were brought into the business. The elder, John (1861&#150;1934), joined in 1879, and became a partner in 1886. One early scheme he worked on was the 1885 Suakim&#150;Berber military railway. The younger, Malcolm (1872&#150;1934), followed in 1892. Members of the Lucas family had been similarly brought in. After the death of Sir Charles Thomas Lucas in 1895 the firms of Lucas Brothers and Lucas and Aird were dissolved, almost all the Lucas family having retired, and a new firm of John Aird &amp; Co. was set up to carry on the railway and civil engineering work; Aird &amp; Sons continued the water and gas contracts. John Aird remained very active. Nearly fifty more contracts were taken by the two Aird firms before his death.<br>
<br>Aird's greatest works, for which he became a grand lord of the order of the Mejidiye in 1902, were in Egypt. In the 1890s plans for improving irrigation and control on the Nile had been frustrated by the cost. Aird offered to accept a deferred payment for the Aswan Dam and Asyut barrage, and was awarded the contract in 1898. Further contracts for raising the Aswan Dam and building the Esna barrage followed. Other large contracts were obtained at the Royal Edward Dock, Avonmouth, and finally at Tanjong Pagar docks in Singapore. This was the last major contract undertaken by the Airds. Aird suffered a stroke in 1908, and this prompted his retirement. The Singapore contract proved a financial disaster, in part due to misleading site investigations, and the firm lost around &pound;1 million by the time the affair had been settled after Aird's death. It was left to Malcom Aird to wind the business up.<br>
<br>Sir John's baronetcy, awarded on 5 March 1901, was a public recognition of his considerable achievements. His organization was, after the death of Thomas Brassey, the largest contracting firm in the country, employing 30,000 men in December 1874, and as many as 20,000 men on the Aswan Dam alone twenty years later. It had its headquarters at 37 Great George Street, London, with depots in Lambeth and Fulham, and made great use of mechanical plant with a fleet of over a hundred locomotives. Aird himself helped develop the steam navvy.<br>
<br>Like many engineers of the Victorian period Aird entered politics and was MP for North Paddington in 1887&#150;1902. He took his responsibilities seriously. Although his speeches were unremarkable he attended public functions as a matter of course and played a leading role in the public library movement in Paddington. He was the first mayor of Paddington in 1900&#150;01. His portrait by Sidney Paget decorated the council chamber and shows him in mayoral robes with characteristic flowing beard.<br>
<br>Aird's other chief interest was in the arts. He had a theatre installed at his home at 14 Hyde Park Terrace, London, which also housed his important art collection. The works included early English and Dutch painters and a large number of works by late Victorian artists, including the Pre-Raphaelites. Aird's varied interests were reflected in his membership of a large number of professional and voluntary organizations. He was elected associate of the Institution of Civil Engineers in 1859, and member of the Iron and Steel Institute in 1887. He was a liveryman of the Needlemakers' Company, and its master 1890&#150;92 and 1897&#150;8. He was one of the first contractors to be appointed to the engineer and railway volunteer staff corps, being a major and subsequently honorary lieutenant-colonel. A leading freemason, he was master of the Prince of Wales Lodge, and a grand deacon. He was a member of the Junior Carlton Club. He was churchwarden at St John's, Southwick Gardens, where the Revd E. P. Anderson, who married his daughter Vida, was vicar. He was appointed to the royal commission on the depression in trade (1886), and his other chief public appointment was as commissioner of lieutenancy of the City of London. Aird retired to Wilton Park, Beaconsfield, Buckinghamshire, where he died on 6 January 1911. He was buried in a vault alongside his wife in St Anne's Church, at Littleworth, near Dropmore, Beaconsfield.<br>
