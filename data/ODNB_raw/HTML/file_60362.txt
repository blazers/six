<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Evans, Sir  (Robert) Charles</span>  (1918&#150;1995), <span class="occ">surgeon and mountaineer</span>, was born in Liverpool on 19 October 1918, the son of Robert Charles Evans (1882&#150;1918), solicitor, and his wife, Edith Lloyd, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Williams (1883&#150;1966). His father, a second lieutenant in the 15th Welsh regiment, was shot dead by a German prisoner on 24 August 1918, and Evans was brought up in Dyffryn Clwyd, Denbighshire, principally by his mother. In childhood he spoke Welsh as his first language. He won a scholarship to Shrewsbury School, which he attended from 1931 to 1937, and another to University College, Oxford, at a time when his love of mountains was already well established. He had been introduced to the Welsh hills by Patrick Childs, a master at Shrewsbury, and by 1939 he had already climbed in Wales, Scotland, Ireland, and the Alps. He qualified in medicine in December 1942, and the following year joined the Royal Army Medical Corps before serving in India, Burma, Vietnam, and Borneo. He was mentioned in dispatches in 1945 for his courage as a regimental medical officer crossing the Irrawaddy. He made two brief treks in the Himalayas during this period&#151;to Kumaon and along the Singalila Ridge, in sight of Kanchenjunga, third highest mountain in the world. Within a decade he was chosen to lead the expedition that first climbed it.<br>
<br>Evans practised as a surgical and neurosurgical registrar in Liverpool between 1947 and 1957; during this period his mountaineering prowess blossomed. He was to remark that because of this focus of his life he was the oldest middle-grade surgical registrar in the National Health Service. In the Alps in 1949 his season was marred by the tragic fatality of his companion Richard Hull on the Brouillard Ridge of Mont Blanc. Though injured, having broken Hull's fall, Evans descended alone to Courmayeur to summon help. His first Himalayan expedition was to Annapurna II with Bill Tilman in 1950. He visited Kulu (India), attempting Deo Tibba in 1951, and in 1952 he was deputy leader on the expedition to the 8000 metre peak Cho Oyu, under Eric Shipton. Competence, imperturbability, kindness, exceptional organizational ability, and a quiet wit were the qualities for which his colleagues remembered him. Following Cho Oyu he stayed on in Nepal to explore the upper Barun valley.<br>
<br>In 1953 Evans was appointed deputy leader of the British Everest expedition under John Hunt, who had replaced Eric Shipton. Evans and Tom Bourdillon made the first ascent of the south summit of Mount Everest on 26 May 1953. Faulty oxygen apparatus and lack of time prevented them from reaching the main summit, which was climbed by Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay several days later. How different Evans's life would have been if he had been one of the summit pair. Nevertheless he was soon chosen to lead the 1955 British expedition to Kanchenjunga, a peak harder and demanding more commitment than Everest itself, and scarcely less high. The ascent by two parties, George Band with Joe Brown, and later Norman Hardie with Tony Streather, on 25 and 26 May made this expedition a model of its kind. 1957 was Evans's last expedition, to Annapurna IV. On 14 August the same year he married (Denise) Nea Morin (<i>b</i>. 1931), a teacher, and also in her own right a distinguished climber from a mountaineering family. There were three sons of the marriage.<br>
<br>In the late 1950s symptoms of Evans's neurological illness began. Multiple sclerosis soon disabled him, marking the end of active climbing. He moved laterally from neurosurgery into university administration, and became principal of the University College of North Wales, Bangor, in 1957. This post, which he held until 1984, brought him into conflict with Plaid Cymru, in particular over the appointment of non-Welsh academic staff. Despite these difficulties (which saddened him greatly), and those of his progressive illness, he presided over a flourishing university that tripled in size and established departments of international repute in oceanography, marine biology, electronics, and forestry.<br>
<br>Evans's four books portrayed his modesty, accuracy, and humour. <span class="italic">Eye on Everest</span> (1955) was a gentle book of the sketches he made in 1953, sometimes mocking the neo-imperial aspects of the Everest expedition. <span class="italic">On Climbing</span> (1956) was in part an autobiography, understated and dwelling more on climbs he had enjoyed than those for which he was well known. <span class="italic">Kanchenjunga: the Untrodden Peak</span> (1956) was the story of this great expedition which he led. His final book, <span class="italic">A Doctor in the XIVth Army</span>, was published posthumously in 1998; this recorded the campaign by the &#145;forgotten army&#146; against the Japanese forces. Evans's diaries, on which the book was based, were meticulous, frank, and full of understanding. He described the poor physical condition and privation that Japanese prisoners suffered in British hands, as well as <i>vice versa</i>, and recalled how at the trial of a Japanese Lieutenant-Colonel Sumida for war crimes, a British civilian witness named Robert Scott had been summoned to identify his torturers: &#145;At this the Japanese all rose and gave Scott a formal bow of recognition; a faint smile passed between the two&#146;  (Evans, <span class="italic">A Doctor</span>, 191).<br>
<br>Evans received a string of academic honours throughout his life and was knighted in 1969. He was a member of the council of the Royal Geographical Society in 1960&#150;61 and president of the Alpine Club from 1967 to 1970. He died of pneumonia at a nursing home in Deganwy, north Wales, on 5 December 1995, and was cremated at Colwyn Bay on 11 December. He was survived by his wife and three sons.<br>
