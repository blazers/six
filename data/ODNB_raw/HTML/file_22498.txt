<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Ponsonby,  John</span>  (1713&#150;1789), <span class="occ">speaker of the Irish House of Commons</span>, was born on 29 March 1713, the second son of Brabazon Ponsonby, second Viscount Duncannon and later first earl of Bessborough (1679&#150;1758), landowner and politician, and his first wife, Sarah, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Margetson (<i>d</i>. 1733), widow of Hugh Colvill of co. Down and daughter of James Margetson and Alice Caulfeild. His elder brother was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22504/', "William Ponsonby (1704&#150;1793)")</script>, politician, who succeeded to his father's titles. John Ponsonby entered the Irish parliament in 1739 as member for the borough of Newtown, co. Down. In 1742 he was appointed secretary to the revenue board, and in 1744 succeeded his father as first commissioner. He held this post for twenty-seven years. On the outbreak of the Jacobite rising of 1745 he raised four independent companies of horse, and received the thanks of the viceroy, Lord Chesterfield. In 1748 he was sworn of the privy council, and on 26 April 1756 he was unanimously elected speaker of the House of Commons, succeeding Henry Boyle, who was created Lord Shannon.<br>
<br>Though his family was not without influence in the Irish parliament, Ponsonby's position was bolstered by his marriage, on 23 September 1743 to Lady Elizabeth Cavendish (1723&#150;1796), daughter of William Cavendish, third duke of Devonshire (1698&#150;1755), and Catherine Hoskins (<i>d</i>. 1777). His brother William had married Elizabeth's sister, Caroline, in 1739 and this dual alliance, in combination with Ponsonby's links with the primate, Archbishop George Stone, raised his family to undertaker status. This meant that his services as a manager in parliament were purchased by the viceroy in return for a share of government patronage. Ponsonby clashed with the pre-eminent Boyle family, both in the revenue board and in parliament, and their rivalry played a major role in fomenting the money bill dispute of 1753.<br>
<br>The settlement introduced by the British government in March 1756 to defuse tension in Ireland enabled Ponsonby to become speaker of the Commons. However, his loyalty to the British government was mercurial, and in 1757, when the duke of Bedford became viceroy, he joined Stone in his campaign to disrupt the session's business, by backing opposition motions against the growing pensions list. Bedford was forced to negotiate, and Ponsonby, along with Stone, returned to the government fold; both were appointed lords justices on Bedford's departure. Ponsonby's independent streak did much to redefine the speaker's role in the Commons, where he became a servant of the house rather than of the British government. This was demonstrated in 1760 when Ponsonby and his fellow lords justices refused to transmit a money bill that was not drawn up by the Irish Commons.<br>
<br>In 1761 Ponsonby was elected MP for the county of Kilkenny, and he held that seat until 1783. He was more amenable to the Halifax and Northumberland administrations, and he continued to support Dublin Castle even after the so-called &#145;massacre of Pelhamite innocents&#146; and the passing of resolutions in Ireland supporting the treaty of Paris. The Rockingham ministry, formed in 1765, expected Ponsonby's co-operation in the Commons. However, he initially boasted &#145;What matters it to us who are ministers in England? Let us stick to our own circle and manage our own little game as well as we can&#146;  (PRONI, D562/1757). His bullish stance was short-lived and he was forced to apologize after supporting a series of patriot measures. Clearly the increasingly patriotic temperament of the house made the speaker's job very difficult, and Ponsonby only succeeded in alienating both the British government and the patriot MPs. In 1766 Lord Bristol was appointed viceroy by Lord Chatham's administration which was determined to curb Ponsonby's influence. Lord Bessborough, Ponsonby's brother, claimed that Bristol intended &#145;fair war&#146; when he arrived  (<span class="italic">Correspondence of George III</span>, 1.484&#150;6). In Ireland it was said that:<blockquote>the Speaker is going about and stopping every man who sells a halfpenny worth of tobacco to tell him of designs that are hatching against Ireland&#151;the gentlemen of the country are all to be removed and set at nought&#151;not a place to be given away by the commissioners of the revenue&#151;a union, a land tax. (Derby County RO, D3155/WH3469)</blockquote>When Bristol was replaced by Lord Townshend, Ponsonby made a number of patronage requests, which were refused by the British ministry. As a result he did not give his support to the augmentation of the Irish army in April 1768, a measure vital to British imperial policy. Though he pretended to be in favour of the <span class="roman">Octennial Bill</span>, which would limit the duration of the Irish parliament to eight years, in reality he realized that this measure would undermine his influence in the Commons. On hearing the news that the bill had been passed, it was said that &#145;his countenance fell. He turned pale, and it was visible to every one that some fatal news had been received&#146;  (<span class="italic">Charlemont MSS</span>, 1.24). Ponsonby also sided with the opposition when the money bill was rejected on 21 November 1769. A frustrated Townshend, by now a resident viceroy, declared war on the undertakers, and with Prime Minister North's backing he stripped Ponsonby of his revenue office. Townshend's construction of a Dublin Castle party independent of the undertakers secured mastery of the Commons for his administration, and forced Ponsonby's resignation as speaker, as he was determined not to present an address of thanks to Townshend. He no doubt expected to be re-elected, but the Commons chose Edmund Sexton Pery in his place. Ponsonby failed in his bid to regain the office of speaker in 1776, despite a concerted campaign by his supporters.<br>
<br>Townshend's replacement, Lord Harcourt, was more amenable towards Ponsonby. But despite the offer of a return to the revenue board, Ponsonby opted to retain his independent position in the Irish parliament. Influenced by his British relatives, he opposed the absentee tax in 1773. He also opposed the motion of 10 October 1775 in support of the war with America. Although he seemed sympathetic to the administration of the earl of Buckinghamshire (1777&#150;80), he was ultimately unwilling to co-operate with government, and he was a staunch supporter of the free trade campaign in 1779. Lord Carlisle had hopes of gaining the Ponsonby interest for government, and John Ponsonby did offer his support in a number of key debates. But it was only with the accession of the Rockingham ministry in Britain and the arrival of Portland as viceroy in 1782 that Ponsonby made a firm commitment to government.<br>
<br>John Ponsonby was an able parliamentarian, but he was outshone by many of his contemporaries. He was not a gifted orator, and the British government regarded his managerial abilities as vastly inferior to those of Henry Boyle. Yet he, and perhaps more importantly his family, did much to shape the nature of Irish politics in the eighteenth century. His consistent commitment to patriotism lent credibility to the opposition, and his tenure as speaker allowed his successors, Edmund Sexton Pery and John Foster, to consolidate the office's newly found independent status.<br>
<br>Ponsonby died on 12 December 1789. He was succeeded by the eldest of his ten children, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22506/', "William Brabazon Ponsonby, first Baron Ponsonby (1744&#150;1806)")</script>, politician and sportsman. His third son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22495/', "George Ponsonby (1755&#150;1817)")</script>, became lord chancellor of Ireland in 1806. His daughters Catharine and Charlotte married, respectively, Richard Boyle, second earl of Shannon (1728&#150;1807), and the Irish patriot MP Denis Daly (1747&#150;1791).<br>
