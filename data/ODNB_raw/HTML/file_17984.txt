<span class="headword">Mannock,  John</span> <span class="st"> [<em>name in religion </em>Anselm]</span>  (1681&#150;1764), <span class="occ">Benedictine monk and author</span>, was born at Giffords Hall, Suffolk, the third son of Sir William Mannock, third baronet (<i>d</i>. 1714), and his wife, Ursula, daughter of Henry Neville of Holt, Leicestershire. His family were faithful to the Roman Catholic religion and many in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries joined religious orders on the continent. He was educated at Douai in Flanders by the English Benedictines. While playing with a cannon ball at a first-floor window he accidentally let it slip, and it killed his brother Thomas who was standing below. He was so overwhelmed with distress at this accident that he determined to devote the rest of his life to religion. He joined the community at Douai and made his profession on 7 March 1700. After his ordination to the priesthood he was sent to England, and for fifty years served as chaplain to the Canning family at Foxcote in Warwickshire (1709&#150;59). He was then moved to Kelvedon Hall in Essex, the seat of the Wright family, where he remained until his death.<br>
<br>Mannock held several positions of responsibility in the English Benedictine congregation. He was secretary to the provincial chapter in 1721, and procurator of the province and praepositus of Worcestershire (1725&#150;37). He was elected praedicator generalis in 1733, and definitor of the province in 1755. His final office was as cathedral prior of Worcester and definitor of the regimen from 1757.<br>
<br>Besides his pastoral work Mannock devoted his life to the pursuit of sacred literature, and the surviving manuscripts (more than twenty volumes) preserved in the archives at Downside Abbey bear witness to his studious habits and indefatigable perseverance. Joseph Gillow wrote of him that, &#145;Among the old controversial writers there are few who have taken higher ground or maintained it more durably than Fr. Mannock&#146;.<br>
<br>Although only two of Mannock's works were published in his lifetime (with a third appearing posthumously), they proved to be popular with monks on the mission in Britain. <span class="italic">The Poor Man's Catechism</span> (1752) provided helpful practical directions, such as listing the manual works forbidden on a Sunday, as well as the &#145;impedimenta&#146; involved in marriage cases. &#145;It served a need precisely at the time when many expanding congregations were moving away from a household chaplaincy and patrons' control&#146;  (Scott, 140).<br>
<br>A more complicated work, <span class="italic">The Poor Man's Controversy</span>, was published posthumously in 1769. Although written in a plain style, &#145;it tried to reconcile Protestantism to English Catholicism by explaining controversial Catholic doctrines, adopting a minimalist view of the papacy and admitting Catholic excesses&#146;  (Scott, 141). The book probably reflected the liberal values of what has been called the Catholic Enlightenment. Both of these works were helped to the press by the secular priest George Bishop of Brailes. Mannock died at Kelvedon Hall, Essex, on 30 November 1764.<br>
