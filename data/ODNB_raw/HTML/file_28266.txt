<span class="headword">Vicary,  Thomas</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1561), <span class="occ">surgeon</span>, whose name is often written Vicars, Vikers, Vycars, and Vycary in contemporary records, was probably a native of Kent, and was a member of the Barbers' Company of London. In 1525 he was elected third warden. In 1528 he was upper warden, and in 1530 was elected master, to which annual office he was again elected in 1541, 1546, 1548, and 1557. His presence in London is, however, recorded as early as 1514, when he was licensed by the bishop of London to practise surgery within London and a 7 mile radius following the act of 3 Hen. VIII c. 11. At the same time he seems to have maintained a modest practice in Maidstone, and it was here in 1527, according to Clippingdale, that he successfully treated Henry VIII for a leg complaint, for which service he was appointed a royal surgeon at an annual salary of &pound;20, his quarterly payment appearing for the first time at Christmas 1528. He married the sister of Thomas Dunkyn, a yeoman of St Leonard, Shoreditch; they had one son, William, who was admitted to the freedom of the company on 26 June 1547.<br>
<br>In 1530 Vicary obtained a promise of the reversion of the office of sergeant-surgeon to the king; he succeeded in 1536 and held the office, then worth &pound;26 13<i>s</i>. 4<i>d</i>. a year, until his death. Further evidence of royal favour is shown in Holbein's painting of the king with members of the new Company of Barber&#150;Surgeons of London, established by act of parliament in 1540, in which Vicary is depicted as receiving royal authority on behalf of the company in the form of a charter. He was probably active in securing new powers for the company under this act, among them the right to the bodies of four hanged felons yearly for dissection at quarterly anatomical lectures; he and other surgeon members of the company were certainly insistent on claiming the first body from Tyburn before the mayor's court in December of that year.<br>
<br>In 1546, on the grant of Henry VIII's second charter to St Bartholomew's Hospital, the city undertook the hospital's refitting, and Vicary was, on 29 September 1548, appointed a governor, and was reappointed each year until June 1552, when he was made &#145;one of the assistants of this house for the terme of his life&#146;  (minute book). On 2 October 1554 it was ordered that he should have the oversight of all such officers as be within the hospital, in the absence of the governors. He lived in the hospital, where his house was kept in repair by the governors, and he received an annual grant of livery of &#145;fyne newe collour&#146; of 4 yards, at 12<i>s</i>. a yard. He was superior to William Cartar, Thomas Bailey, and George Vaughan, the first surgeons; and his friendly relations with the two who survived him are shown by his bequest to Bailey of a gown of brown blue lined and faced with black budge, a cassock of black satin, his best plaister-box, a silver salvatory box, and all his silver instruments, and to George Vaughan of a doublet of crimson satin.<br>
<br>Vicary continued sergeant-surgeon to Edward VI and Elizabeth, and in 1554 he was appointed surgeon to Philip. In 1539 he had been granted a lease for twenty-one years of parts of the dissolved abbey of Boxley in Kent, the lands of which had been given to Sir Thomas Wyatt, and in 1542 he, with his son William, was appointed bailiff of the manor of Boxley, and received a regrant of the office from Philip and Mary in 1555. He bought a house and land in the same district.<br>
<br>In December 1547 Vicary married Alice Bucke of London, who survived him. He made his will on 27 January 1561 in St Bartholomew's Hospital, two days after treating Sir William Petre at Ingatestone Hall in Essex, and died at the end of that year. His will was proved on 7 April 1562. Besides bequests to his family and friends he left 1<i>s</i>. each to forty poor householders living within the hospital walls, and 10<i>s</i>. each to the chaplain, matron, steward, cook, and porter of St Bartholomew's. He alludes to his possession of the <span class="italic">Surgery</span> of Guido and of Vigo, and of other books, but mentions no work by himself. However <span class="italic">A Profitable Treatise of the Anatomie of Man's Body</span>, of which the earliest extant edition is of 1577, is stated on the title-page to have been compiled by him. It is dedicated to Sir Rouland Haiwarde, the president, and the governors, by William Clowes, William Beton, Richard Story, and Edward Bayly, surgeons to the hospital. The book was examined by Dr J. F. Payne  (<span class="italic">BMJ</span>, 25 Jan 1896) and later by Sir Clement Price Thomas, among others, and is clearly an abbreviated version of a late fourteenth-century manuscript in English, which is itself based upon Lanfranc and Henri de Mondeville, with a few short additional passages. Its anatomy therefore belongs to the classical world of Galen and does not reflect the new ideas of writers such as Vesalius, which Vicary himself may have rejected. <span class="italic">A Profitable Treatise</span> was, however, the first anatomical textbook in English and could have been published both in memory of Vicary and for practical use by apprentices, few of whom knew Latin at that time. In many ways an obscure figure, Vicary is nevertheless an important one. Five times master of his company, a number never exceeded, and in 1555 its financial saviour by paying its debts, he brought stability to the practice of surgery in London and thus ensured the company's later eminence in the development of British surgery as a whole. The Thomas Vicary lecture has been delivered annually at the Royal College of Surgeons since 1919.<br>
