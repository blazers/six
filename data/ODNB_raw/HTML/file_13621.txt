<span class="headword">Holwell,  John</span>  (<em>b. </em>1649, <em>d.</em> in or after 1686), <span class="occ">astrologer and mathematician</span>, born in London on 24 November 1649, was probably the John Holwell, son of Thomas and Catherine Holwell, who was baptized at St James's, Clerkenwell, on 28 November 1649. According to a family tradition he was descended from the Holwells of Holwell House, near Tavistock, Devon; his father and grandfather were allegedly engaged in Penruddock's plot in 1655, fell in the royalist cause, and forfeited the family estates. His namesake, a John Holwell of Sampford, was indeed sequestered in 1655, and in 1652 a Captain John Holwell, perhaps the same person, appears as giving information against alleged papists to the officers of the Commonwealth. The connection between this John Holwell and John Holwell the astrologer is unclear.<br>
<br>Holwell studied astrology under Henry Coley, and achieved considerable notoriety through his bold political predictions. His first work in this vein was <span class="italic">A New Prophecy &hellip; of the Blazing Star</span> (1679), in the form of a letter on the comet that had appeared in April 1677. Holwell put forward a Paracelsian view of comets as &#145;composed by the Spirits of the Air&#146;, at God's command, &#145;to forewarn this Evil World&#146;. His text hinted at another great fire of London, &#145;by the hands of an Enemy&#146;  (ibid., 4), and the overthrow of the French monarchy. In his major astrological work, <span class="italic">Catastrophe mundi, or, Europe's many Mutations until the Year 1701</span> (1682), he explored the likely effects of the triple conjunction of Saturn and Jupiter in the fiery trigon in 1682&#150;3. Holwell explained that the two great planets entered the fiery triplicity (the three &#145;hot&#146; houses of the zodiac), where their conjunctions had the greatest effect, only after intervals of 794 years. Extraordinary results might therefore be expected. His work drew on Richard Edlin's study of the 1663 conjunction, and also borrowed heavily from William Lilly and from the <span class="italic">De mundi catastrophe</span> (1625), by the Italian astrologer Giovanni Spina. Sheltering behind these authors Holwell felt free to publish sensational prophecies with an apocalyptic flavour. Some were provocative, including one (borrowed from Lilly) that God would curb &#145;Monarchical Pomp&#146;. Holwell explained that the tyrannical behaviour of rulers, from kings to justices of the peace, would drive their subjects to rebel and call them to account, an inflammatory comment in the wake of the exclusion crisis. These remarks led to his indictment for seditious libel before the Middlesex quarter sessions in May 1683. Abandoning an initial plea of not guilty he confessed the charge at his trial on 9 July, and was fined.<br>
<br>The <span class="italic">Catastrophe</span> also promised that popery could never triumph in England, and included highly dramatic prophecies on the Ottomans, a controversial subject in the context of their invasion of Austria. Holwell predicted that the Ottoman armies would sweep through Germany, France, Spain, and Italy, capturing the emperor and toppling the pope. After years of upheaval and misery a &#145;great Conquerour&#146; would suddenly appear in 1699  (<span class="italic">Catastrophe</span>, 90), bringing universal peace and paving the way for the conversion of both Turks and Jews. In <span class="italic">An Appendix</span>, published six months later, he printed a nativity of Louis XIV, predicting that the French king was likely to die soon or be driven out by the Turks or his own enraged subjects. Holwell's predictions made him a highly controversial figure. His claims on the Turkish threat were answered in print by several rivals, including John Gadbury, John Merrifield, and Henry Krabtree.<br>
<br>Holwell was married, and had a son and a daughter. When he published his <span class="italic">Catastrophe</span> in 1682 he was living on the east side of Spitalfields, near the Red Lion, by Dorset Street, and he advertised his services and tuition there in &#145;astronomy, navigation, dyalling, surveying, geography, perspective, and gunnery&#146;. He achieved considerable prominence in these less febrile activities, especially in surveying. In 1678 he published <span class="italic">A Sure Guide to the Practical Surveyor</span>, dedicated to John Wildman, politician and one-time leveller, which gave detailed instructions on surveying land, roads, and rivers. He used the instruments of Walter Hayes, the foremost instrument maker of the time. Earlier, he had been one of the team working with John Ogilby on his pioneering surveys of English roads, and he used some of this material in his book. In pressing his credentials as a surveyor he confidently asserted that he had &#145;the most experience of any man in England&#146;  (ibid.). In 1684 he was employed to survey disputed property in Wapping for Thomas Neale, and gave evidence in the celebrated trial that followed between Neale and Lady Ivy, heard by Lord Chief Justice Jeffreys. He also published <span class="italic">Trigonometry Made Easie</span> (1685), referring readers to the works of Henry Gellibrand and Isaac Newton for more advanced studies. His <span class="italic">Clavis horologiae, or, A Key to the Whole Art of Dialling</span> was issued in 1686, by public subscription; the subscribers included the diallist and surveyor Robert Baker and the king's hydrographer, John Seller, who also shared Holwell's radical politics and had been implicated in the republican Tong plot of 1662.<br>
<br>Holwell's skill as a practical mathematician commanded respect; he could refer in 1686 to Edmond Halley as his very good and very loving friend. However, he was never far from controversy. In the month of James II's accession, February 1685, an anonymous correspondent warned the privy council of rumours circulating among the &#145;fanatics&#146; of an imminent great battle on a Yorkshire moor between the duke of York (James II) and Monmouth, which would result in James's death. The report implicated Holwell with these predictions, hinting that he had calculated the nativities of both Charles II and James II, and had surveyed the Yorkshire moor in question, and made cryptic statements about it. According to a family tradition published in 1799, James II's government sent Holwell to America late in 1685 (thus after Monmouth's execution) to survey and map New York, with secret orders that he was not to be allowed to return. He is said to have died there very suddenly, after drinking poisoned coffee, soon after completing the work. Holwell has not been traced after 1686, and it is quite possible that he died about that time while on a surveying mission in the New World.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">Holwell's Predictions</span> (1690), published in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and <span class="italic">John Holwell's Strange and Wonderful Prophesies</span> (1696), both drawn from his <span class="italic">Catastrophe mundi</span>, show that his name lived on. Holwell left a widow whose name is unknown, a son, and a daughter, and his estate was divided equally among them. His son Zephaniah (<i>d</i>. 1729), a London timber merchant, was the father of John Zephaniah Holwell, scholar and governor of Bengal.<br>
