<span class="headword">Lovell,  George William</span>  (1804&#150;1878), <span class="occ">playwright and novelist</span>, was for many years secretary of the Phoenix Insurance Company. Little is known of his early life, but in 1830 he married Maria Ann Lacy, an actress, who, after her marriage, became a playwright under her married name, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17061/', "Maria Ann Lovell (1803&#150;1877)")</script>. Lovell himself wrote six plays starting with <span class="italic">The Avenger</span>, staged at the Surrey Theatre in 1835. This was followed by the tragedy <span class="italic">The Provost of Bruges</span> in 1836, produced at Drury Lane with W. C. Macready and Ellen Tree in the leading roles. Lovell based the work on a story called &#145;The Serf&#146; found in Leitch Ritchie's <span class="italic">Romance of History</span>. According to <span class="italic">The Times</span>, the opening night &#145;audience applauded loudly and unanimously, and the public may be congratulated on the appearance of a play which presents such unquestionable claims to their favour as this&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 11 Feb 1836). In 1841 Lovell's literary career was further enhanced with the publication of his novel <span class="italic">The Trustee</span>. On 12 September 1842 his play <span class="italic">Love's Sacrifice, or, The Rival Merchants</span> was staged by Charles Kemble at Covent Garden and had George Vandenhoff in the lead role. The <span class="italic">Theatrical Journal</span> praised the author's wit in the humorous sections of the play and <span class="italic">The Times</span> noted that Lovell had written &#145;a <i>very</i> clever piece&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 13 Sept 1842). A comedy, dealing with the romantic lives of two Oxford students of differing temperaments, entitled <span class="italic">Look before you Leap</span>, was then produced at the Haymarket on 29 October 1846. <span class="italic">The Times</span> stated that:<blockquote>The merit of the piece lies in the freshness and cheerfulness with which the subject is treated. There is little or no repartee properly so called, but the language flows on smoothly and naturally, and the characters speak out for themselves with much force. (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 30 Oct 1846)</blockquote>The first production of Lovell's most famous play, <span class="italic">The Wife's Secret</span>, took place at the Park Theatre, New York, on 12 October 1846, and proved to be a success with American audiences. The work was staged at the Haymarket, London, on 17 January 1848, and ran thirty-six nights with Mr and Mrs Charles Kean in the lead roles. According to Wilbur Dunkel, Charles Kean paid Lovell &pound;300 for the piece and then gave the author an extra &pound;100 when the play was performed in London. The work became popular and there were notable revivals staged in October 1850, at the Princess's Theatre, and in February 1861, at Drury Lane with the Keans again taking the lead roles. Later productions took place at the Surrey in November 1868, the Olympic in March 1877, and at the St James's in April 1888. This final revival was produced by John Hare with Lewis Waller and Mr and Mrs W. H. Kendal taking the leads. Regarding the original London production, <span class="italic">The Times</span> said:<blockquote>the <span class="italic">Wife's Secret</span> is a plain story effectively told, with the advantage that the ruling sentiment, though often treated before, is one that is sure to appeal to a large portion of an audience. And it may be laid down as a fixed maxim, that he who can tell a story well upon the stage has accomplished nine-tenths of his work as a practical dramatist. (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 18 Jan 1848)</blockquote>The noted theatre historian Allardyce Nicoll stated that <span class="italic">The Wife's Secret</span> was &#145;certainly one of the best plays I have read in this period&#146;  (Dunkel, 52). Lovell's last play, <span class="italic">The Trial of Love</span>, was written for Charles Kean and staged at the Princess's Theatre on 7 June 1852. It ran for twenty-three nights, but was not critically acclaimed. Lovell's playwrighting career is best summed up by Wilbur Dunkel: &#145;His was not a distinguished talent. Yet he wrote highly actable plays which kept alive original playwrighting at the nadir of the English theatre&#146;  (ibid., 58). Lovell died on 13 May 1878 at his home, 18 Lyndhurst Road, Hampstead, leaving at least one daughter and one son, William Henry Lovell.<br>
