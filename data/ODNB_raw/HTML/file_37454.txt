<span class="headword">Giesecke,  Charles Lewis</span> <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em>Johann Georg Metzler]</span>  (1761&#150;1833), <span class="occ">mineralogist and mineral dealer</span>, was born on 6 April 1761 in Augsburg, Bavaria, the eldest surviving son of the six children of Georg Melchior Metzler (<i>d</i>. 1805), a protestant tailor, and his wife, Sibylla Magdalena G&ouml;tz (1735&#150;1794). Originally intended for the church, he studied at G&ouml;ttingen from 1781 to 1783, but there his interests shifted to the law and to mineralogy, which science he pursued under Johann Friedrich Blumenbach (1752&#150;1840). As a young man he had strong theatrical interests, writing plays and librettos, and himself performing. In 1781 he for some reason changed his name to Karl Ludwig Giesecke, and as such edited the <span class="italic">Regensburger Theater-Journal</span> between 1784 and 1786.<br>
<br>During the 1780s Giesecke resided in various south German towns and late in that decade he became established in Vienna, where he was associated with the theatre company of Emanuel Johann Schikaneder (1751&#150;1812). For the company he prepared translations of foreign works, and he wrote the libretto for <span class="italic">Oberon der Elfenk&ouml;nig</span>, staged in Vienna in 1790 with a musical score by Paul Wranitsky (1756&#150;1808). In 1791 he took a minor role in <span class="italic">Die Zauberfl&ouml;te</span> (<span class="italic">The Magic Flute</span>), and he evidently co-operated with Schikaneder and others in the writing of that opera's libretto. It has been reported that in 1817 he laid verbal claim to authorship of the entire libretto, but this was probably either braggadocio on Giesecke's part or else the false recollection of a conversation on the part of his auditor. In Vienna he, like Mozart, was an enthusiastic freemason.<br>
<br>The final decade of the eighteenth century saw Giesecke turn increasingly away from the stage and towards mineralogy. In 1801 he studied the science in Berlin and at Freiberg, he collected minerals widely in northern Europe, and he established a reputation as a mineral dealer and tutor in mineralogy. He collected in the Faeroes during August and September 1805, and in the following year the Danish government commissioned him to collect in Greenland. There he remained from May 1806 until the late summer of 1813. During his absence from Copenhagen his possessions there were destroyed in a fire following upon the British naval bombardment of September 1807.<br>
<br>Giesecke was a pioneer of the scientific study of Greenland, where he collected minerals, organic specimens, and ethnographical items. A Danish ship carrying some of the earliest of his Greenland materials became a British prize-of-war. She was taken into Leith, where his collection was sold in 1808, many of his specimens passing into the hands of the Scottish mineralogist Thomas Allan. In October 1813 Giesecke himself arrived in Leith. There he was befriended by Allan, and his portrait was painted by Henry Raeburn. He became a candidate for the vacant chair of mineralogy at the Dublin Society, and with Allan's help was elected, on 21 January 1814; he remained its occupant until the end of his life.<br>
<br>Giesecke's election is surprising. He confessed that, as yet, he lacked the ability to lecture in English, and in Robert Bakewell and Thomas Weaver the society would seem to have had two somewhat better qualified candidates. The appointment smacks of partiality, and suggests the possibility that he may here have secured Irish benefit from his earlier association with Viennese freemasonry. Alternatively, it has been suggested that the society had purchased some of Giesecke's minerals at the Leith sale and was now anxious to offer him some redress for his lost collections.<br>
<br>Giesecke's relationship with the Dublin Society (it assumed the style Royal in June 1820) speedily became most cordial. In May 1817 the society presented him with a gold medal by William Stephen Mossop; that same year the society received the gift of his Raeburn portrait (a painting still in its possession); and Giesecke was allowed to spend the period from July 1817 until the autumn of 1819 travelling in Europe, among the fruits of which excursion was a mineral collection which he sent to Goethe in May 1819. His duties with the society were threefold. He delivered courses of lectures in mineralogy; he was responsible for its important mineral collection; and he conducted mineralogical surveys on its behalf. He investigated counties Galway and Mayo (1825), Donegal (1826), Antrim, Down, and Londonderry (1828), and Londonderry and Tyrone (1829). His projected book on Greenland was never completed. During 1816 he became a knight of the Danish order of Dannebrog, and henceforth he was always known as Sir Charles Giesecke. The mineral gieseckite was so named in his honour in 1817. He was elected a member of the Royal Irish Academy in 1816 and a fellow of the Geological Society of London in 1817, and was among the founders of the Zoological Society of Dublin in 1830 and of the Geological Society of Dublin in 1831. He died suddenly at Rutland Square West, Dublin, unmarried, on 5 March 1833, and was buried in St George's churchyard, Dublin. The Royal Dublin Society's museum was closed for two weeks in token of the esteem in which he was held.<br>
