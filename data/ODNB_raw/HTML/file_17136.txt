<span class="headword">Lucas,  Richard</span>  (1648/9&#150;1715), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, was born at Presteigne, Radnorshire, the son of Richard Lucas. He matriculated at Jesus College, Oxford, on 3 March 1665, aged sixteen, graduating BA in 1668 and proceeding MA in 1672 (incorporated at Cambridge in 1677). He appears to have travelled around France for a while with his friend William Powell, later rector of Llanwenarth, Monmouthshire. For some time Lucas worked as the master of the free school at Abergavenny, Monmouthshire. In 1677 Lucas published his <span class="italic">Practical Christianity</span>, which offered discourses and accompanying prayers on Christian living. In this work Lucas stressed the importance of shared beliefs in the fundamentals of the Christian faith as overriding doubts and scruples over liturgy and ceremonies. He also emphasized that the active life was more Christian than the contemplative life as it presented greater challenges to faith and more opportunities for the exercise of Christian charity.<br>
<br>It was probably the popularity of this work and his reputation as a preacher that gained Lucas the rectory of St Stephen, Coleman Street, London, in 1678. In October 1683 he was made lecturer of St Olave, Southwark. Some time around 1683 his eyesight, which had always been weak, completely failed him. Rather than impair his work as a preacher and devotional writer his disability spurred him on to write the most famous of his works, his <span class="italic">Enquiry after Happiness</span>. First published in 1685 the work was divided into three parts, the first showing the possibility of obtaining happiness, the second the true notion of life, and the third treating religious perfection. These works are dominated by the notion that happiness is attainable on earth via the exercise of right reason and, as in his <span class="italic">Practical Christianity</span>, there is an emphasis on the importance of an active life. Lucas stated that the whole work was inspired by his friend Dr Thomas Lamb's dictum that &#145;the life of man is to be estimated by its usefulness in the World&#146;. The work was very popular and went through a number of editions. John Wesley, who had had the book recommended to him by his mother, remained an unshakeable admirer of Lucas's writing.<br>
<br>Aside from the <span class="italic">Enquiry</span>, Lucas published many other devotional works, including <span class="italic">The Duty of Servants</span> (1685), which contained guidance and prayers for those entering domestic service. He was also a regular preacher before the mayor and court of aldermen and he preached before the queen on 31 July 1692. These sermons, like his other works, are dominated by the theme of Christian charity. Lucas also revised and corrected a translation of de Castiniza's <span class="italic">The Spiritual Combat</span> (1698). He conformed at the revolution and in his sermons urged that the oaths of allegiance to William and Mary should not be interpreted to &#145;weaken and subvert&#146; but only &#145;strengthen and preserve&#146; the constitution  (R. Lucas, <span class="italic">A Sermon Preached at the Assizes</span>, 1691, 18). He insisted that it was necessary to pay higher taxes to defend England against French tyranny. He was created BD and DD in 1691. In 1697 he was appointed to a prebend at Westminster and in 1701 became president of Sion College. (His election as president was, however, completely unconstitutional as he had never served in any office on the court of governors.) Lucas had a high reputation for piety and was one of the clerics who visited the godly household of Lady Elizabeth Hastings at Ledsham in Yorkshire.<br>
<br>Lucas died at Westminster on 29 June 1715 and was buried in Westminster Abbey on 5 July. He was survived by his widow, Anne (1658/9&#150;1727), and three sons, of whom the two younger also went on to become clergymen. Richard Lucas (1692/3&#150;1747) was ordained deacon at Ely in 1717 and later became rector of Foots Cray, Kent, a living he held until his death. William (1702/3&#150;1753) was a fellow of Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, from 1723 to 1733 and rector of Benington, Hertfordshire, from 1736 to 1753.<br>
