<span class="headword">Carter,  Hugh</span>  (1837&#150;1903), <span class="occ">painter</span>, was born in Birmingham on 4 March 1837, the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/49346/', "Samuel Carter (1805&#150;1878)")</script>, solicitor to the London and North Western and Midland railway companies and one-time MP for Coventry. After moving to London, he studied for a short time at Heatherley's Art School. He then trained with J. W. Bottomley, whose daughter, Maria Concordia, he married on 7 July 1866. They had four daughters and two sons, one of whom, Frank W. Carter, also became a painter. Carter also studied with Alexander Johnson, F. W. Topham, and John Phillip, as well as K. F. von Gebhardt in D&uuml;sseldorf.<br>
<br>From 1859 to 1902 Carter exhibited twenty-four pictures at the Royal Academy, domestic genre paintings as well as portraits of Alexander Blair (exh. 1873 and 1898), the antiquary Sir Joshua Staples (exh. 1887), and Mrs Worsley Taylor (exh. 1890). Two of his most successful exhibits at the academy were <span class="italic">Music hath Charms</span> (exh. 1872) and <span class="italic">Card Players</span> (exh. 1873), both representing scenes from Westphalian peasant life. Much of his best work was done in watercolour and pastel, and in those media he painted a number of landscapes which displayed a fine sense of colour and atmospheric effect. As a watercolour painter he was a frequent exhibitor at the Royal Institute of Painters in Water Colours, of which he became an associate in 1871 and a member in 1875. He was also a member of the Institute of Painters in Oil Colours from its foundation in 1883, and later of the New English Art Club. <span class="italic">The Last Ray</span>, an oil painting in the Tate collection, was donated by his wife in 1905. The Guildhall Art Gallery in London has his work <span class="italic">Hard Times</span>; and the Victoria and Albert Museum in London owns two watercolours, <span class="italic">Buildings and Gondolas at Venice</span> and <span class="italic">Interior of the Capuchin Convent at Albano</span>. His portrait of his uncle, Sir Francis Ronalds (1788&#150;1873), the inventor of the first working electric telegraph, is in the National Portrait Gallery in London. Hugh Carter died on 27 September 1903 at his home, 12 Clarendon Road, Notting Hill, London; he was buried at Kensal Green cemetery. A memorial exhibition of his works was held at Leighton House, London, in October 1904.<br>
