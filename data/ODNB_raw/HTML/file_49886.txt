<div class="para">
<span class="headword">MacLeod,  George Fielden</span>, Baron MacLeod of Fuinary  (1895&#150;1991), <span class="occ">Church of Scotland minister and founder of the Iona Community</span>, was born on 17 June 1895 at 4 Park Circus Place, Glasgow, the younger son and youngest of the three children of Sir John Mackintosh MacLeod, first baronet (1857&#150;1934), an accountant and Unionist MP for Glasgow Central (1915&#150;18) and Kelvingrove (1918&#150;22), and his wife, Edith, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Fielden (<i>d</i>. 1942), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/55782/', "Joshua Fielden")</script>, a wealthy Unitarian mill owner and Conservative MP for the West Riding of Yorkshire (1868&#150;80). MacLeod, commonly known simply as George, was among the most flamboyant and charismatic Scottish church leaders of the twentieth century, and possibly the most influential. He belonged to a distinguished lineage of highland ministers of the established Church of Scotland, stretching back for several generations and including a remarkable number of moderators of the general assembly, royal chaplains, and doctors of divinity. He was very much aware of this ministerial heritage, and of his highland and Celtic roots, although his own upbringing and education made him a thoroughly Anglicized Scottish aristocrat. From early on he felt a destiny to be a leader of men. He inherited from his mother's side of the family considerable personal wealth, and was for most of his life a prominent Christian socialist, with a remarkable ability to relate to all sorts of people&#151;borstal boys at the Iona Community's centre at Camas, unemployed men on the streets of Govan, or students on campuses throughout Britain, North America, and Australia. He was a passionate patrician, and his enthusiasm and commitment were infectious; several generations of young Scots, and many others as well, fell under the spell of his preaching, with its imaginative and romantic weaving of words, and its call to costly and relevant discipleship.<h2>
<a name="Thepacifistwarrior"></a>The pacifist warrior</h2>After education at Cargilfield School, Edinburgh, Winchester College, and Oriel College, Oxford (where he passed the examination in classical moderations), at the start of the First World War MacLeod enlisted in the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders. He served with enthusiasm, courage, and distinction in Greece and on the western front, becoming captain and adjutant, and being gazetted MC in 1917 and awarded a Croix de Guerre with palm in 1918. He seems at the time never to have questioned the morality or necessity of the war, or of the way it was being waged in the trenches. Indeed his war diary was peppered with unqualified jingoism, as in the entry for 21 June 1918: &#145;A Battalion in our Brigade did a splendid show last night, and killed 80 Bosche, taking 19 prisoners! This is the spirit that will &#147;Win the War&#148;&#146;  (MacLeod papers, folder 37).<br>
<br>From the later 1930s MacLeod was a prominent pacifist, but the story that his pacifism was the result of horror at what he had experienced in the trenches is a myth, one which MacLeod was not beyond encouraging himself. As late as 1928, in a published sermon on the occasion of the funeral of Field Marshal Earl Haig, there was no hint of unease at war as such, at the First World War, or indeed at the way that war was fought. Haig &#145;was not only valiant, he was Valiant for Truth&#146;; and without qualification MacLeod cited &#145;The Lord your God, it is he that hath fought for you&#146;  (G. F. MacLeod, <span class="italic">Earl Haig, KT</span>, 1928, 7, 9).<br>
<br>MacLeod was a member of the Fellowship of Reconciliation from 1934, but it was only by 1937 that he had &#145;come out&#146; as an absolute pacifist. Early in the Second World War John White, at that time the dominant figure in the Church of Scotland, expressed great concern that the Iona Community under MacLeod's leadership had become &#145;a nursery of pacifists&#146;. Throughout the Second World War, and the cold war that followed, MacLeod adopted a thoroughgoing pacifist stance, which was sometimes divisive in the community he founded, and after the Second World War led to annual ritual debates in the general assembly, when a pacifist motion proposed by MacLeod was regularly rejected. Only in 1986 did the assembly adopt a motion proposed by MacLeod, in the following terms: &#145;As of now this General Assembly declares that no church can accede to the use of nuclear weapons to defend any cause whatever. They call on Her Majesty's government to desist from their use and stop their further development&#146;  (Ferguson, <span class="italic">George MacLeod</span>, 409).<h2>
<a name="Themakingoftheminister"></a>The making of the minister</h2>MacLeod's experience of the First World War may not have made him a pacifist, but it undoubtedly stimulated the young man who had intended to make a career in the law to recognize instead that he had what was almost hereditary in his family&#151;a vocation to the ministry of the Church of Scotland. After graduating BA from Oxford under war regulations in 1919, he returned to Scotland to study theology at Edinburgh University. Then, as throughout his later life, MacLeod was rather impatient with academic theology, preferring a few simple truths that spoke to the heart and were relevant to the needs of the world, to the work of careful scholarship. Working in Edinburgh slums such as the Pleasance was for him, as for many others, formative in developing his passion for justice and his ability to communicate with all sorts and conditions of people. From Edinburgh he went for a year to Union Theological Seminary in New York, then a bastion of the social gospel. Thus started MacLeod's long love affair with North America, which he later visited frequently, mesmerizing students in campuses all over the United States and arousing much enthusiasm and support for his various projects, particularly the Iona Community.<br>
<br>While he was in America MacLeod encountered &#145;Tubby&#146; Clayton, the founder of Toc H. Clayton recruited MacLeod to establish Toc H in America, and eventually to direct Toc H work in Glasgow. Clayton's personality deeply influenced MacLeod, and Toc H reminded him of the depth of fellowship he had enjoyed during the war. In 1924 he was ordained by the presbytery of Glasgow to be a full-time Toc H padre in Glasgow.<br>
<br>After returning to Scotland from America in 1922, MacLeod was first assistant in St Giles's, the High Kirk of Edinburgh, at the heart of a huge slum parish. He was tireless and ebullient in his ministry, particularly with boys from the slums, and quickly recognized as a notable preacher. In 1926 he was called to be the collegiate minister of St Cuthbert's, a society church in central Edinburgh. There his preaching attracted large congregations, and the handsome bachelor was commonly known as &#145;the Rudolph Valentino of the Edinburgh pulpit&#146;. So far, MacLeod was following with some distinction the conventional <i>cursus honorum</i> of &#145;princes&#146; of the Church of Scotland.<h2>
<a name="Anewbeginning"></a>A new beginning</h2>The break came in 1930, when MacLeod accepted a call to Govan old parish church, where his great-uncle John MacLeod had had a remarkable ministry in the late nineteenth century. Unlike St Cuthbert's, Govan was basically a working-class parish; even more than St Cuthbert's it maintained a high-church tradition of worship. MacLeod arrived as minister in the depths of the depression, with a huge incidence of unemployment, much poverty, and hardship for most families in the parish. He developed a ministry to the whole parish, very much in the tradition of Thomas Chalmers, and indeed of his grandfather Norman MacLeod at the Barony, and of his great-uncle in Govan. He was outraged at the poverty with which he was surrounded; it made him an outspoken Christian socialist. His Govan ministry was like a whirlwind, as he initiated a huge programme of social action, service, and open-air preaching, culminating in an immensely successful parish mission in Holy Week 1934. He really believed in the parish system, and was convinced that the future of the Church of Scotland depended on its revival. He ran his parish like a military campaign, always leading from the front, and being the first to &#145;go over the top&#146;.<br>
<br>But even MacLeod, with his superabundant energy and his apparently total confidence, had his breaking point. In 1932&#150;3 he had a prolonged period of depression which, as it were, mirrored in his inner life the poverty and hopelessness by which he was surrounded in Govan. He was completely exhausted, physically and spiritually. Out of this depression, and in particular as a consequence of a profound experience in Jerusalem in Holy Week 1933, he returned to Govan with an enlarged vision and a new surge of energy.<h2>
<a name="ThebirthoftheIonaCommunity"></a>The birth of the Iona Community</h2>MacLeod's move from Govan to realize his vision and establish an Iona community in 1938 seemed to some people another abrupt change of direction. It was, however, a coming together of his war experience, his struggles to make the faith a relevant reality in conditions of great hardship during the depression of the 1930s, his romantic and inventive attachment to the tradition of &#145;Celtic Christianity&#146;, and his own very strong and personal spirituality, strengthened by his own period of depression. He never tired of telling the story, in numerous versions, of how the Iona Community emerged out of his ministry in Govan. He was summoned to visit in hospital a man who was dying of starvation. The man turned out to be Archie Gray, who had heckled MacLeod while he was preaching in the open air. Archie &#145;was bitter about the Church, not because it was preaching falsehoods, but because it was speaking the truth and did not mean what it said&#146;. &#145;Archie Gray&#146;, George announced, &#145;was the real founder of the Iona Community&#146;  (Ferguson, <span class="italic">George MacLeod</span>, 137).<br>
<br>From the beginning of the Iona Community, MacLeod saw himself as a kind of latter-day Columba, directing a campaign for the re-evangelization of Scotland from the ancient holy centre of Iona. But he behaved like a military commander, or another Ignatius of Loyola, leading a disciplined army in the service of the Lord. From the beginning, rebuilding the ruined abbey was at the heart of the community's activity. At a time of unemployment and social division, craftsmen, ministers, and divinity students together discovered in the labour of rebuilding the dignity of creative work; budding ministers learned how to communicate with ordinary folk; shared and lively worship, drawing particularly on what was imagined to be a living tradition of Celtic spirituality, renewed the worship of the Church of Scotland. MacLeod freely invented &#145;ancient Celtic&#146; beliefs and practices, and often seems to have convinced even himself that they were authentic. For a time at least, he embraced Rudolph Steiner's theories about the spiritual significance of the Celts, and was also much attracted to the way in which Steiner and his associates understood community, cared for the disadvantaged, and believed that the physical world was charged with spiritual significance. In <span class="italic">The Coracle</span> (November 1939) he solemnly reported that &#145;It was a practice of the Celtic Clergy to bathe in the sea EVERY DAY OF THE YEAR&#146;. He thus justified his own frequent practice of inveigling young members of the community to join him in an early morning swim. From early on, alongside the rebuilding work, there were youth camps and varied conferences on Iona, attracting a wide constituency to the island where, as MacLeod was wont to say, the veil between time and eternity was very thin.<br>
<br>In April 1944 MacLeod succeeded his nephew Captain Sir Ian Francis Norman MacLeod as fourth baronet, although he did not use the title. On 28 August 1948 he married his cousin Lorna Helen Janet Macleod (<i>d</i>. 1984), elder daughter of the Revd Donald Macleod, of Balvonie of Inshes, Inverness. They had a daughter, Eva Mary Ellen (<i>b</i>. 1950), and two sons, (John) Maxwell Norman (<i>b</i>. 1952) and Neil David (<i>b</i>. 1959).<h2>
<a name="Thepenasasword"></a>The pen as a sword</h2>The ideology behind the rebuilding of the abbey and the work of the Iona Community was outlined by MacLeod in his book <span class="italic">We Shall Re-Build: the Work of the Iona Community on Mainland and Island</span> (1944). The purpose was to revitalize the Church of Scotland and, more broadly, the Presbyterian family of churches. This was to be achieved through recovering the centrality of mission and reinvigorating the parish and the congregation. Twelve years later MacLeod's Cunningham lectures, published as <span class="italic">Only One Way Left</span> (1956), presented a broader and less ecclesiastical agenda, concerned with nuclear warfare, justice, and the environment&#151;all encompassed in a passionate commitment to the cosmic Christ. MacLeod was not a disciplined or original thinker, and his writings were not of lasting significance, but at the time he had a rare and exciting capacity to kindle the heart and elicit commitment. Apart from his Warrack lectures on preaching, published as <span class="italic">Speaking the Truth in Love: the Modern Preacher's Task</span> (1936), he published a large number of sermons in collections such as <span class="italic">Govan Calling</span> (1934) or individually, and a stream of manifestos and tracts for the times. But the best way to trace how his thinking developed is through the Iona Community's journal, <span class="italic">The Coracle</span>. In the early days it was almost entirely written by MacLeod, and it continued while he was leader of the community to be his major workshop of ideas.<h2>
<a name="Thematuringcommunity"></a>The maturing community</h2>At the beginning the Iona Community consisted entirely of men, most of them young ministers, or &#145;licentiates&#146;, straight out of the Scottish theological colleges, with MacLeod and a few older ministers to lead them, together with a handful of craftsmen. In the winter the ministers in the community went to work in &#145;community parishes&#146; on the mainland, mostly in the inner cities and housing estates, while the craftsmen and a few others continued the rebuilding work on the island. The rebuilding was a romantic project, in part an attempt to recover the Celtic heritage, in part a symbol of the renewal and rebuilding of the church as a whole that was required. It continued throughout the war, with MacLeod almost miraculously charming money and materials for the reconstruction from rich donors. The project was a sign of hope in dark days, and an affirmation of the future. Its completion in 1965 was a massive achievement, duly celebrated, but it brought into the open what many people had suspected: neither MacLeod nor the community as a whole had a very clear idea of what to do with the now reconstructed abbey. MacLeod shortly afterwards demitted his post as leader with a note of bitterness, as he strongly opposed the plans supported by the majority of the community for the future use of the buildings. The community wanted the abbey to be a centre of spirituality, study, and meeting all the year round; MacLeod wanted it to be a centre for applied theology attached to the four Scottish divinity colleges.<br>
<br>Especially at the beginning, the Iona Community was seen as a strictly disciplined, military-style body of men, a brotherhood. Even after his own marriage MacLeod resolutely set his face against any involvement by women or wives in the life of the community. It was to be &#145;an experiment in the technique of Fellowship&#146;. Community members had a uniform&#151;dark blue suits, shirts, and ties, supposedly the dress of ordinary Scots working men&#151;which they were expected to wear while on the island. Everyone was to attend all services, and meals were taken in common. From this base the discipline of the community developed, involving a commitment to peace and justice (though not necessarily to pacifism), a daily practice of prayer and <span class="roman">Bible</span> reading, and an economic discipline.<br>
<br>The fifteen years after the Second World War were the great days of the Iona Community, and the high point of MacLeod's career. The community grew larger, and without ever ceasing to be controversial it became regarded as one of the greatest gifts of the Church of Scotland to the world church, for as it grew it became thoroughly ecumenical and well regarded all over the Christian world. Iona Abbey became, and continues to be, a major centre of spiritual renewal and lively and relevant worship.<br>
<br>As the buildings neared completion and the community developed a will of its own on a number of issues, MacLeod's energies began to turn in other directions, and he became more freelance in his activities. After serving as moderator of the general assembly of the Church of Scotland in 1957&#150;8, from 1958 he was convener of the church extension committee of the Church of Scotland, a position in which he gave typically vigorous leadership, wiping out a huge deficit incurred by the construction of new churches to serve the housing estates which had sprung up all over Scotland. In the same year he became convener of a special committee on central Africa, and in 1959 the general assembly responded enthusiastically to his call to support the opposition to the Central African Federation: &#145;Someone must speak for the Africans, and that someone will be the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland&#146;, he said.<h2>
<a name="IjoydwhentotheHouseofLords"></a>I joy'd when to the House of Lords &hellip;</h2>In 1967, two years after the great Pentecost service to celebrate the completion of the rebuilding of Iona Abbey, MacLeod was made a life peer, as Baron MacLeod of Fuinary. Now he prepared for new battles and a different campaign. He resigned as leader of the community, becoming a general without an army who none the less could still excite new generations with his passionate oratory and calls to action. For some years he had shown himself to be increasingly restless, spending long periods on overseas preaching and speaking tours, and clearly looking for new projects and new battles to fight for the kingdom of God.<br>
<br>MacLeod's membership of the House of Lords was not a success. His speeches were few, and his pulpit oratory fell rather flat in the lords' chamber. His successors as leaders of the community were rather different in style, and he bombarded them with advice and warnings, feeling that without his leadership the community was adrift. He set up abortive or short-lived initiatives, such as &#145;The new breakthrough in Christ&#146;, which was unambiguously pacifist, and &#145;The new reformation&#146;. He tried unsuccessfully to establish a new community at his family seat of Fuinary in Morven, Argyll. Even as a peer of the realm, an ex-moderator of the general assembly, a rector of Glasgow University (1968&#150;71), and chaplain to the queen, MacLeod in his later years remained a rebel with many a cause, an aristocratic radical who was a constant irritant to the establishment of which he was so much a part. His greatest critics came to respect the old warrior, while continuing to disagree with him. He was a soldier and a romantic, whose infectious, imperious vision challenged and enriched the life of church and society in Scotland and far beyond. His great legacy was the Iona Community, which continues to flourish, to disturb, and to transform.<h2>
<a name="ThespiritualityofGeorgeMacLeod"></a>The spirituality of George MacLeod</h2>MacLeod was one of the greatest preachers of his day, but no theologian. Leading theologians of the time, such as the Baillie brothers, Archie Craig, David Cairns, Garth Macgregor, and Charles Raven, supported him and the work of the community enthusiastically, but his own theological thinking was (according to his friends) mystical and Celtic, and (according to his critics) confused sloganizing. He argued that the natural order was the garment of Christ, and that the central problem of the modern world was the division between the spiritual and the material. From this polarization all the evils of the modern age flowed, but it had been already definitively overcome in the incarnation. In sacramental life the wound that kept the material and the spiritual apart was healed, but those who took the sacraments seriously must work out their reality in the life of the world.<br>
<br>MacLeod was a man of intense and moving piety. His prayers, like his sermons, invited people to encounter reality at a new depth, and challenged them to go and transform the world. He was the joint recipient of the Templeton prize for progress in religion in 1989, and the recipient of a number of honorary doctorates from universities in Britain and North America. He died at his home, 23 Learmonth Terrace, Edinburgh, on 27 June 1991; he was cremated and his ashes were partly scattered on Iona and partly interred beside his wife's grave in Inverness. He was survived by his daughter and two sons, the elder of whom succeeded to the baronetcy.<br>
