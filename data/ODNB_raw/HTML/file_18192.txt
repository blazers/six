</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Martin,  John</span>  (1789&#150;1854), <span class="occ">artist</span>, was born on 19 July 1789 at East Land Ends, Haydon Bridge, Northumberland, the thirteenth and youngest child (only five of whom, one of them a daughter, survived childhood) of (William) Fenwick Martin, who held several occupations including publican, coach builder, fencing master, and tanner, and his wife, Isabella, daughter of Richard Thompson of Lowland's End, Haydon Bridge. His brothers included <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18198/', "Jonathan Martin (1782&#150;1838)")</script>, arsonist, and the eccentric and self-proclaimed philosopher <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18218/', "William Martin (1772&#150;1851)")</script>.<h2>
<a name="Earlyworks"></a>Early works</h2>After apprenticeship to a coach-painter in Newcastle upon Tyne, Martin worked for a china painter, Boniface Musso, whom he accompanied to London in 1805. There he made a living painting china and glass. In 1809 he married Susan Garnett. Martin's art derived from the conventions of decorative embellishment; his subject matter, initially, was &#145;classical&#146; landscape: Claudian topography with bystanders in togas. He first exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1811 (<span class="italic">Landscape Composition</span>) but first made an impact the following year with <span class="italic">Sadak in Search of the Waters of Oblivion</span> (St Louis Art Museum, Missouri), a painting remarkable for its juxtaposed incandescence and void, the combination that was to be Martin's speciality for the rest of his career.<br>
<br>Martin's Sadak slipping from a rocky shelf, about to plunge feet first into nothingness, thereby purging himself of memories, is a key image of the Romantic sublime. Prototype that he was, Sadak was the forerunner of other heroes mostly destined to meet eye-catching fates, notably Cadmus the dragon slayer, Joshua in <span class="italic">Joshua Commanding the Sun to Stand Still</span> (United Grand Lodge of England, London) and the bard, last of his race, high on a mountain, cursing the English army invading Wales.<br>
<br>In 1817, the year of <span class="italic">The Bard</span> (Laing Art Gallery, Newcastle upon Tyne), Martin was appointed drawing master and historical landscape painter to the prince regent's daughter, Princess Charlotte, and her husband Prince Leopold of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld, an imposing title that could have carried some weight had the princess not died in childbirth that year. Martin looked instead to the Royal Academy for advancement or alternatively to the British Institution where, in 1817, he was awarded a &pound;100 premium for his <span class="italic">Joshua</span>. With that encouragement, his aims as a painter were resolved: he would develop a factually spectacular epic genre involving vastness and multiplicity, with history relaxed into fiction or elaborated into legend. He began to prosper and in 1818 bought a house, 30 Allsop's Buildings, in the New Road, London.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">The Fall of Babylon</span> (priv. coll.), exhibited in 1819 at the British Institution, was a panorama painting reduced to respectable (academy-worthy) proportions. Cycloramic in its vasty architecture and wide horizons, it shows diminutive troops swarming past the Tower of Babel and across the Euphrates to the ramparts and hanging gardens of the palace where the impious Belshazzar reigns. Moments later, in <span class="italic">Belshazzar's Feast</span> (1820; priv. coll.), panic sets in as God's writing flares on the wall of the immense banqueting hall. This sequel won Martin a &pound;200 premium at the Royal Academy exhibition of 1821. What Charles Lamb in his &#145;Essay on the barrenness of the imaginative faculty in the production of modern art&#146; in <span class="italic">Last Essays of Elia</span> (1833) described as a huddle of vulgar consternation proved amazing enough to attract a paying public when it went on show in a shop in the Strand. In the accompanying leaflet biblical and archaeological sources for the composite style of architecture&#151;part Egyptian, part Indian&#151;were cited. Martin the showman recognized the allure of &#145;authenticity&#146; while relying on the pull of crude perspectives. As the German critic G. F. Waagen said, such paintings as <span class="italic">Belshazzar</span> &#145;unite in a high degree the qualities which the English require above all in a work of art&#151;effect, a powerful invention, and topographical historical truth&#146;  (G. F. Waagen, <span class="italic">Works of Art and Artists in England</span>, 1838, 2.162).<h2>
<a name="Majorworks"></a>Major works</h2>As he attained the height of his celebrity, Martin did all he could to emphasize the educational value of his pictorial spectacles. As in panoramas of the battle of the Nile, ancient Rome, and ruined Pompeii, flawless workmanship and top lighting were key elements. And the larger the painting the greater its capacity to overwhelm. <span class="italic">The Destruction of Herculaneum and Pompeii</span> of 1822 was itself damaged in a flood at the Tate Gallery in 1929; the surviving fragment is sufficient to indicate that it did not have quite the impact of <span class="italic">Belshazzar</span>.<br>
<br>Martin was never accepted as a serious painter by the art establishment as constituted by the Royal Academy. He resolved to appeal over the academy's head, so to speak, to a broader public, and make a living by producing print versions of his successful paintings. Eventually, as John Constable remarked, Martin &#145;looked at the Royal Academy from the Plains of Nineveh, from the Destruction of Babylon&#146;  (Pendered, 180): vantage points attained largely on the strength of his printmaking.<br>
<br>Mezzotint is a medium peculiarly suited to Manichaean fantasies: the black void of the prepared plate, blackness scraped away to create forms and highlights. <span class="italic">Paradise Lost</span>, illustrated in two sets of mezzotints for the publisher Septimus Prowett in 1825&#150;7, was ideal material for Martin, who echoed Milton's solemnity while opening out his cadences in the imagery of groves and chases bathed in silvery light and an underworld where fires tongue the darkness and bridges span nothingness and Satan's armies infest the gloom. In mezzotint Martin's vision thrived. His subjects, biblical and Miltonic, lent themselves to vast generalizations dotted with microscopic particulars. <span class="italic">The Seventh Plague of Egypt</span> (1823; Boston Museum of Fine Arts) and <span class="italic">The Expulsion</span> (<i>c</i>.1825; Laing Art Gallery, Newcastle upon Tyne) translated readily from text to painting to engraving.<br>
<br>Stressing what he conceived to be the reality underpinning myth, or revealed religion, Martin designed <span class="italic">The Deluge</span> (1826; priv. coll.; mezzotint 1828) on a basis of contemporary theory. Baron Cuvier, the geologist, visited his studio while he was working on the composition and, according to Martin, approved his presentation of the event. <span class="italic">The Fall of Nineveh</span> (1828; mezzotint 1829) was his largest and grandest <span class="roman">Old Testament</span> spectacular with embankments breached along the Tigris and the emperor Sardanapalus preparing a funeral pyre of Babel proportions. Martin showed the painting in the Brussels Salon in 1833. It remained unsold.<h2>
<a name="Schemesformetropolitanimprovement"></a>Schemes for metropolitan improvement</h2>Like Jericho, Babylon, Herculaneum, and Thebes before it, Martin's Nineveh was an awful example to Londoners of what could befall them. In the 1820s an expanding London, the new Babylon as it was often referred to, lacked infrastructure to a frightening degree. The Thames, tidal and without river walls, was both water supply and sewer. Cholera broke out in 1830. From the late 1820s onwards Martin devoted much of his time and energy to schemes for metropolitan improvement. He designed embankments to prevent the Thames flooding, to contain sewers and (grander even than anything the builders of his Nineveh had achieved) to accommodate also an underground railway system. Martin's inventive proposals included a safety lamp for coalminers, double hulls for shipping, and coastal warning lights. He proposed glazed shopping malls and uninterrupted green spaces extending from Kensington to Whitehall. Such schemes chimed in with the themes of his paintings both in relation to disasters, impending or witnessed, and in the similarities of approach: the picturesque treatment of crisis and a punctilious attention to detail.<br>
<br>None of Martin's schemes was given more than a polite hearing at the time, though in time virtually all of them were realized by others. Nor was his campaign for copyright protection immediately successful. His prints were pirated in Europe and the United States and while these helped spread his reputation their relative crudity encouraged the view that he was a clumsy eccentric, a view reinforced by association in 1829 when his brother Jonathan set fire to York Minster on religious grounds and was committed to Bethlem Hospital as a criminal lunatic. Another brother, William, wandered the streets of Newcastle upon Tyne selling pamphlets on subjects derived for the most part from John Martin's projects, sincerely burlesquing his ideas on safety lamps and perpetual motion machines.<br>
<br>Martin's plans were a distraction at a time when his sort of sublimity was going out of fashion. His mezzotint <span class="italic">Illustrations of the Bible</span> issued in parts in 1831&#150;5 was a failure. Having cried woe as a painter and as a campaigning visionary, he was now caught up in his own destruction. His plans cost him, a friend estimated, &pound;10,000; by 1837 he faced bankruptcy.<br>
<br>By all accounts lively and enthusiastic, Martin was&#151;according to his friend Sergeant Ralph Thomas&#151;&#145;a deist in religion, a radical reformer in politics&#146;  (Pendered, 176). He was apt to hiss when the national anthem was played. Having lived in style for twenty years, he had to cut back. Large biblical paintings and mezzotints (<span class="italic">The Crucifixion</span>, <span class="italic">The Death of the First-Born</span>) no longer appealed; he turned to painting pretty watercolour views of the countryside around London.<h2>
<a name="Laterworks"></a>Later works</h2>Yet there remained seams of progressive satisfaction. In 1834 Martin illustrated for the palaeontologist Gideon Mantell <span class="italic">The Country of the Iguanadon</span>, realizing, from fossil bones, an artist's impression of extinct species. It served as the frontispiece to Mantell's <span class="italic">Wonders of Geology</span> (2 vols., 1838). Imagining himself, or John Martin, as &#145;some higher intelligence from another sphere&#146;, Mantell described looking down on earth and seeing &#145;winged reptiles of strange forms&#146;, then after thousands of centuries returning to see the ocean gone and dry land again appearing  (Mantell, 1.455). &#145;Above the cliffs a beautiful city appeared; with its palaces, its temples, and its thousand edifices&#146;  (ibid.). Mantell drew on Martin as Martin drew on Mantell: what had begun with <span class="italic">Cadmus</span> and Joshua's Jericho had become a new reading of history.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">The Coronation of Queen Victoria</span> (1838; Tate Collection) was a bid by Martin to attract patrons, in the shape of the members of the nobility invited to his studio to sit for the tiny portrait heads involved. He succeeded in impressing the prince consort who, in 1840, encouraged him to return to large-scale painting by reverting to an old theme. <span class="italic">The Eve of the Deluge</span> (Royal Collection), <span class="italic">The Deluge</span> (1834; Yale U. CBA), and <span class="italic">The Assuaging of the Waters</span> (Fine Art Museums of San Francisco) restated his themes in a more richly worked manner. He also painted <span class="italic">Pandemonium</span> (1841; Forbes Collection, New York) and <span class="italic">The Celestial City and Rivers of Bliss</span> from <span class="italic">Paradise Lost</span> again, with a view to re-establishing himself as a painter first and foremost. For the rest of his life he exhibited every year at the Royal Academy.<br>
<br>Martin's obsessions persisted. He addressed the theme of the elimination of the human species. He had been friendly with William Godwin, father of Mary Shelley whose novel <span class="italic">The Last Man</span> prompted him to produce a drawing of the last man as a Christ figure on a headland surrounded by corpses: potential fossils. A large version (Walker Art Gallery, Liverpool), was exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1850.<br>
<br>In 1848 Martin moved to an apartment in Lindsay House by Battersea Bridge, a short distance downriver from 6 Davis Place, where Turner lived. There, having relinquished his directorship of the Metropolitan Sewage Manure Company&#151;another unsuccessful venture&#151;he planned <span class="italic">The Last Judgement</span>, a painting by himself and an engraving after it by Charles Mottram. Influenced by James Barry's <span class="italic">Elysium, or, The State of Final Retribution</span> at the Society of Arts, he planted the heads and shoulders of great artists, thinkers, and philosophers on green slopes, watching as popes, emperors, lords, and a power-mad rabble, featuring a trainload of worldly fools, slide into the pit of oblivion. He then turned to utter destruction, first with <span class="italic">The Destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah</span> (1852; Laing Art Gallery, Newcastle upon Tyne), then with one of a pair of pictures to flank <span class="italic">The Last Judgement</span>: <span class="italic">The Great Day of his Wrath</span> (1852), in which the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah, Babylon, Nineveh, Rome, and London have risen into the air among the exploding mountains, poised to fall into the void, snuffing out gesticulating mankind. In the other he presented his vision of paradise regained in <span class="italic">The Plains of Heaven</span> (1853; all three paintings are in the Tate Collection), where angels waft over rose bushes and lawns sloping towards blue seas and, looming over all, the white domes of the heavenly Jerusalem.<h2>
<a name="Deathandreputation"></a>Death and reputation</h2>Martin died at 4 Finch Road, Douglas, Isle of Man, on 17 February 1854 and was buried at Kirk Braddan cemetery, Douglas. Of his children his eldest son Alfred, who made a number of mezzotints for his father, became chief superintendent of income tax in Ireland; Charles was a portrait painter; <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18200/', "Leopold Charles Martin")</script> wrote a memoir of Martin and worked in the Stationery Office; Jessie Martin married Joseph Bonomi, who after her death in 1859 became curator of Sir John Soane's Museum, where another daughter, Isabella, served as his assistant.<br>
<br>An artist of poetic coincidence and stark contrasts, Martin invariably aimed to deluge the senses, to inspire wonder, to edify and amaze. His hold on the popular imagination was unparalleled in his day; as a showman painter&#151;taking the sublime to the general public of the 1820s&#151;he was both proficient and inventive. He was at best an adroit painter. As a printmaker he was altogether more formidable in that he worked in mezzotint, embellishing the imagery through successive revisions of the plate and printing with great subtlety using different mixes of inks to get the effects he wanted. His <span class="italic">Deluge</span> and his <span class="italic">Bridge over Chaos</span> are masterpieces of the medium and among the most astonishing images of the era. Martin's reputation, low when he died, declined steadily thereafter. The <span class="italic">Last Judgement</span> triptych was exhibited as a special attraction for some years and toured the United States. The paintings hung for a while in Alexandra Palace in north London. Oblivion intervened: in 1935 they were sold at auction for just under &pound;7. <span class="italic">The Last Judgement</span> itself was cut into three strips and served as a fire screen; restored and reunited the three paintings, Martin's finale, are now in the Tate collection. Since the publication of Thomas Balston's biography of Martin in 1947 his work has been taken seriously enough for the epithet &#145;mad&#146; to be dropped. Long before then, in D. W. Griffith's film <span class="italic">Intolerance</span> (1916), the mezzotint of <span class="italic">Belshazzar's Feast</span> was the basis of the enormous Babylon set. Martin's imaginative projections translated readily into cinematic terms. His epic vision was the link between panorama and cinema.<br>
<br>Like Milton's Adam, or Satan, the solitary protagonists of so many of his compositions, John Martin stood tall in the face of stupendous failures, not only in his enlightened schemes for urban improvement but in his determination to organize natural disasters into magnificent spectacles. First man, last man&#151;or last woman&#151;out of Gomorrah: in every appalling circumstance, be it eclipse or pestilence, earthquake or invasion, Martin conjured wonders out of the void.<br>
