<span class="headword">Waweton <span class="st"> [Walton]</span>, Sir  Thomas</span>  (<em>d.</em> in or after 1450), <span class="occ">landowner and speaker of the House of Commons</span>, was the son of John Waweton of Great Staughton, Huntingdonshire, who was ten times knight of the shire for Huntingdonshire, and whose influence probably lay behind Thomas's being first elected to the Commons for Huntingdonshire in 1397, and becoming a JP in that county in 1402. During the next thirty years Thomas Waweton regularly returned to the Commons, representing Bedfordshire in 1413, 1414, 1419, 1425, and 1432, and Huntingdonshire in 1397, 1401, 1402, 1414, 1420, and 1422. By 1419 he had been knighted. That he was elected speaker in 1425 was a reflection both of his long experience in the lower house, and also of his growing social eminence, in both Huntingdonshire and Bedfordshire. A retainer of Edmund (V) Mortimer, earl of March, until the latter's death in 1425, he was a friend and associate of Sir John (later Lord) Tiptoft (<i>d</i>. 1443) and Reynold Grey, Lord Grey of Ruthin (<i>d</i>. 1440), and perhaps of Archbishop Henry Chichele (<i>d</i>. 1443). Waweton's fortunes changed in 1429, however, when he twice attempted illegally to influence the outcome of parliamentary elections. In Huntingdonshire he forced the sheriff to return candidates of his choice, while as sheriff of Buckinghamshire he abused his position by substituting the names of two individuals selected by himself for those returned by the electors. The ensuing scandal turned local opinion permanently against him, and effectively ended his career in the Commons&#151;he was never elected again for Huntingdonshire, and only once more for Bedfordshire, in 1432. A gap between 1429 and 1435 in his appointments as JP in Bedfordshire may also have resulted from this <i>faux pas</i>.<br>
<br>Despite this setback Waweton remained a figure of considerable standing, and was still influential in Bedfordshire, where he was sheriff again between 1432 and 1435. This may have been in part due to his marriage (his third) <i>c</i>.1431 to Alana, daughter and coheir of the wealthy Sir Simon Felbrigg, formerly standard-bearer to Richard II. (Few details are known of his first two wives, Elizabeth, who had died by 1422, and Maud, who had died by 1431.) In the late 1430s Waweton became involved in the contest between Lord Grey and John Cornwall, Lord Fanhope (<i>d</i>. 1443), for supremacy in Bedfordshire. Ostensibly a supporter of Grey, Waweton played an important part in the struggle, above all in 1439, when a quarrel over precedence between him and Fanhope at the peace sessions held at Bedford on 12 January led to a crush in which eighteen people died. Waweton was closely questioned before the king's council in the following month, and though he received a pardon on 30 May, he once more lost his place on the Bedfordshire peace commission, and did not regain it until 1443. After Lord Grey's death in 1440 the rest of Waweton's life was uneventful. In 1450 he was appointed a collector of taxes for Bedfordshire, and although the date of his death is unknown, it probably occurred soon afterwards. He was survived by his third wife, Alana (<i>d</i>. 1458), his son and heir, Thomas, and three other children.<br>
