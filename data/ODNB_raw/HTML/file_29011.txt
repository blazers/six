<span class="headword">Wells,  Charles Jeremiah</span>  (<em>c.</em>1800&#150;1879), <span class="occ">lawyer and poet</span>, was born probably in London, the elder of the two children of James Turner Wells and Jane, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Sayers (<i>d</i>. 1832). Little is known of his parents, though his mother may have been an actress, and they appear to have been reasonably well off and planned for their son to become a solicitor. Wells is now remembered, if at all, for a practical joke which he played on the brother of the poet John Keats and for a belated period of fame among Pre-Raphaelite circles for his biblical verse-drama <span class="italic">Joseph and his Brethren</span> (1824).<br>
<br>From at least 1803 until Wells's departure from London about 1830, the family lived at Featherstone Buildings, Holborn, London. As a youth Wells met Tom Keats, and his brother John who, in the summer of 1816, wrote for him the sonnet &#145;To a Friend who Sent me some Roses&#146;. After leaving school, he was apprenticed to a solicitor, and Keats's letters of 1817&#150;18 show that during this period he moved in the Keats circle at dinners, parties, the theatre, and other social occasions. Wells comes across from these and other accounts as lively and high-spirited, witty and irrepressible, if somewhat lazy and irresponsible and even, at least as far as the details of his own life are concerned, untrustworthy. After the death of Tom in December 1818, Keats discovered that Wells had played what he saw as a cruel joke on his brother, a &#145;diabolical scheme&#146; as he called it  (<span class="italic">Letters of John Keats</span>, 2.90), which he believed had exacerbated his brother's illness and even hastened his death. Wells had written a series of admiring and amorous letters to Tom, signed by a fictitious Frenchwoman named Amena Bellafilla, in highly stylized and poeticized language full of clich&eacute; and mock-archaism, much of which was borrowed from the early pseudo-medieval poetry of Keats himself. Tom Keats appears to have been taken in by this patent prank and was deeply hurt when the truth became clear. On discovering the deception, and in mourning for his brother, Keats declared that &#145;I do not think death too bad&#146;  (ibid.) for Wells and that &#145;I will harm him all I possibly can&#146;  (ibid., 2.91). Having been dropped by the Keats circle, Wells undertook two literary projects which were, nevertheless, heavily indebted to the style of his erstwhile friend. The first was a series of prose stories modelled on Boccaccio, <span class="italic">Stories after Nature</span>, published anonymously in 1822: this volume rivalled a volume of verse-translations of Boccaccio planned by Keats and J. H. Reynolds. The second project was the dramatic poem <span class="italic">Joseph and his Brethren</span>, published in December 1823 (with 1824 on the title-page) under the name H. L. Howard. It was written, so Wells later claimed, in six weeks, &#145;to compel Keats to esteem me and admit my <i>power</i>&#146;  (Johnston, 81). Both projects were almost entirely ignored by the literary reviews&#151;a fate which Wells apparently accepted with equanimity: throughout his life he exhibited what H. Buxton Forman described as &#145;a superb indifference to fame&#146;  (Forman, 294).<br>
<br>About 1827 Wells married Emily Jane Hill (<i>d</i>. 1874), daughter of a schoolmaster, Francis Hill, and his wife, Margaret, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Powell, from Broxbourne in Hertfordshire. Between 1827 and 1841 the couple had three daughters and a son, all born in Broxbourne, which suggests that despite the fact that Wells continued working as a solicitor in London until 1830, he may have been living at least part of the time in Hertfordshire. Possibly for reasons of health and no doubt afflicted by what Forman called &#145;a constitutional indolence&#146;  (Tatchell, 16), Wells retired to Hertfordshire, and possibly also to Wales, about 1830, where he seems to have devoted his time to hunting, fishing, and boating as well as horticulture and bee-keeping. In 1841 he moved with his family to France, where he lived until his death in 1879, first in Brittany where he taught English at a college in Quimper, and later in Marseilles.<br>
<br>Meanwhile, however, developments in England were slowly beginning to give Wells a cult status among certain poets and artists. In 1837 Thomas Wade, in his poem &#145;Contention of Love and Death&#146;, named him as one of the unjustly neglected poets; in 1841 Richard Henry Horne, an old schoolfriend, included Wells's &#145;Sonnet to Chaucer&#146; (written in 1823) in his edition of <span class="italic">The Poems of Geoffrey Chaucer Modernised</span> and in 1844 made favourable mention of him in his <span class="italic">New Spirit of the Age</span>. In 1842 the magazine editor W. J. Linton reprinted a number of Wells's <span class="italic">Stories after Nature</span> in his <span class="italic">Illuminated Magazine</span>; and in 1846&#150;7 two essays by Wells, on field sports and the local gentry in Brittany, were published in <span class="italic">Fraser's Magazine</span>. Through these and other public notices Dante Gabriel Rossetti was alerted to his work and read one of the few remaining copies of <span class="italic">Joseph and his Brethren</span> in the British Library. Convinced that he had discovered a neglected genius, Rossetti began to proselytize among his friends to the extent that it was said that reading Wells's verse-narrative became compulsory for entry into the Pre-Raphaelite circle. Edmund Gosse commented that reading the poem became a &#145;kind of shibboleth&#151;a rite of passage into the true poetic culture&#146;  (<span class="italic">Encyclopaedia Britannica</span>). Over the next twenty-odd years attempts were made by Rossetti, Algernon Charles Swinburne, Theodore Watts-Dunton, George Meredith, and others to have <span class="italic">Joseph</span> republished, until eventually Chatto and Windus took an interest after Swinburne published an appreciation of Wells entitled &#145;An unknown poet&#146; in the <span class="italic">Fortnightly Review</span> in February 1875. The poem was republished in 1876, edited by Forman with a revised version of Swinburne's essay as an introduction, and with corrections and revisions by Wells himself. This time the poem was reviewed more widely and favourably and for a brief period there seemed to be a chance that Wells would become a famous poet. But since he had burnt a series of manuscripts in 1874 after the death of his wife (including, he claimed, a novel, three volumes of stories, a number of lyric poems, and an epic), he was unable to capitalize on his new-found popularity, such as it was, to any significant extent. Wells, as Watts-Dunton remarked, seemed to have an &#145;instinct for &#147;not getting on&#148;&#146;  (Watts-Dunton, xlvi).<br>
<br>What appears to have attracted Rossetti, Swinburne, and others to Wells's poetry and to have made them believe that they had discovered another Keats, was a certain derivative richness of imagery, a facility with rhythm and poetic form, and an easy eloquence combined with a once-fashionable pseudo-Elizabethan manner which allowed his work to be compared favourably with that of Shakespeare, Webster, and Cyril Tourneur, as well as with Keats and other nineteenth-century poets such as Wordsworth and Blake. Wells remains, however&#151;and despite attempts to revive his work&#151;a curiosity of literary history: even the hyperbolic reviews of the second edition of <span class="italic">Joseph</span> by the Pre-Raphaelite circle were unable to generate significant sales for his poem, and he remains today little known and even less read.<br>
<br>Wells died at 2 Mont&eacute;e des Oblats, Barth&eacute;lemy, Marseilles, on 17 February 1879 after a long illness. Some time before his death he had converted to the Roman Catholic church. He had also dabbled in spiritualism and claimed to have raised a young lady from the dead by means of prayer, a &#145;faculty which is&#146;, as Watts-Dunton comments, &#145;rare among modern poets&#146;  (Watts-Dunton, xlvii). Wells's son Charles, an engineer by profession and gambler by inclination, had his own moment of fame as the subject of Fred Gilbert's popular song &#145;The Man who Broke the Bank at Monte Carlo&#146; (sung by <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/58764/', "Charles Coborn")</script>).<br>
