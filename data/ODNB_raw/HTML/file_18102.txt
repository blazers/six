<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Marsden,  William</span>  (1754&#150;1836), <span class="occ">orientalist and numismatist</span>, was born on 16 November 1754 at Verval, co. Wicklow, Ireland, the tenth of the sixteen children of John Marsden (1715&#150;1801), shipping merchant and banker, and his second wife, Eleanor Bagnall (<i>d</i>. 1804). John Marsden retired from &#145;extensive mercantile and shipping concerns&#146; in 1764, and became one of the first directors of the National Bank of Ireland after helping to establish it in 1783. William underwent a conventional classical education at schools in Dublin, with the intention that he should enter Trinity College to read for a career in the church. But in 1770 he followed the recommendation of his eldest brother, John, already a writer in East India Company service at Fort Marlborough in Sumatra, to join him there. Though not yet sixteen, Marsden successfully petitioned the East India Company for a Fort Marlborough writership for himself, and he left Dublin on 9 December 1770 and England on 27 December 1770 <i>en route</i> to Sumatra. On his arrival on 30 May 1771 he was appointed to the secretary's office before rising to sub-secretary in November 1773 and assuming the full responsibilities of secretary to the company's government in Sumatra in January 1774, though without formal appointment until October 1776. Marsden enjoyed the company of his brother, particularly in performances in the theatre which John Marsden had built at Fort Marlborough (until it burnt down in January 1774).<br>
<br>From early 1778 Marsden began to reconsider following<blockquote>the plan commonly adopted, of remaining in the Company's service until the annual savings from the emoluments of office should accumulate to what is termed a fortune&#151;that is, such a sum as, when invested in English securities, would permit the owner to enjoy the conveniencies of life, without further exertion on his part.</blockquote>He was attracted instead, through reading accounts published of Captain James Cook's <i>Endeavour</i> voyage, to the prospect of joining the milieu of scientific and learned meetings in London. In April 1779 he resigned his East India Company position, and he left Sumatra on 6 July, arriving in England on 24 December with slender resources. Literary pursuits, and attendance at theatre, parliament, and the law courts occupied his time. On 1 March 1780 Thomas Forrest, navigator of the eastern seas, introduced him to Sir Joseph Banks at Banks's house in Soho Square, where Marsden records meeting Daniel Solander, Nevil Maskelyne, Alexander Dalrymple, James Rennell, Charles Blagden, William Herschel, Joseph Planta, and others. He was invited to dine at the Royal Society Club, and to attend Royal Society meetings that month, and he became a regular participant in Banks's Soho Square breakfasts. In 1782 Marsden fortuitously declined a proposal to serve as secretary to Admiral Sir Hyde Parker, about to sail in the ill-fated <i>Cato</i>, wrecked on Madagascar, the Maldives, or the Malabar coast. In the following year he published his <span class="italic">History of Sumatra</span>, on which, inspired by the company at Soho Square, he had been working for two years while lodging at Caroline Street, Bedford Square. The <span class="italic">History</span>&#151;drawn from his own records of Fort Marlborough, and especially the Redjang people, and dedicated to the establishment of &#145;facts, rather than systems &hellip; to things as they exist, rather than to display the powers of creative imagination&#146;  (Marsden, 373)&#151;established Marsden's reputation as both a talented writer and a scholar of zoology, botany, linguistics, and geography. Marsden &#145;gradually ceased to look forward to obtaining an official appointment&#146;: he withdrew from the East India Company formally in 1783, and two years later set up with his brother John an East India agency which continued until John's death in 1786. Marsden was elected a fellow of the Royal Society on 23 January 1783 and of the Society of Antiquaries in December 1785. He was a founding member of the Royal Irish Academy in 1785, and received an honorary DCL at Oxford in June 1786. Elected a member of the Royal Society Club on 2 August 1787, he became treasurer the following year, a position he held until 1804. He declined a suggestion to stand for parliament, and continued the private study of oriental languages, receiving through Banks's influence the oriental vocabularies compiled and submitted by ships' officers after their voyages.<br>
<br>In February 1795 the cartographer James Rennell brought to Marsden Earl Spencer's offer of the second secretaryship of the Admiralty, which he eventually accepted, as much for the amiable society of Admiralty board members and staff as for the satisfaction of duty done. Unlike first secretary Sir Evan Nepean, Marsden survived the changes of ministry in 1801 and 1804. Pressed by Henry Addington, Marsden deferred retirement in that year to accept the first secretaryship of the Admiralty at a salary of &pound;4000 a year, a position he retained until 1807. He records in his posthumously published autobiography that it fell to him in October 1805 to wake Lord Barham, as first lord of the Admiralty, with the news of victory at Trafalgar and the death of Nelson.<br>
<br>Marsden was elected to the Literary Club in 1799, and to the treasurership of the Royal Society in November 1802, presiding at meetings also of the Royal Society Club in Banks's absence. He developed his considerable collection of oriental coins by the purchase in September 1805 of the Kufic coin collection of Sir Robert Ainslie: this and a common interest in oriental languages and literature brought him increasingly into contact with <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29416/', "Sir Charles Wilkins")</script>, later librarian of the East India Company. In 1805 Marsden sought a baronetcy without success, and again, on the change of ministry in March 1807, he sought to retire from the Admiralty on grounds of ill health. Eventually insistent on retirement, he ceased to officiate in the Admiralty on 24 June 1807, and on 22 August the same year married Elizabeth Wilkins (<i>d</i>. in or after 1860), daughter of Sir Charles, the latter having for some time assisted him in the arrangement of his coin collection.<br>
<br>At the anniversary meeting in November 1810 Marsden relinquished the treasurership and vice-presidency of the Royal Society. Earlier that year he had bought the country house of Edge Grove, Aldenham, Hertfordshire, and moved his books from Wimpole Street to the country in 1812. His married years were his most productive in terms of writing and publication, as he built on the standing he had achieved with his <span class="italic">History of Sumatra</span> (2nd edn, 1783; 3rd edn, 1784) and <span class="italic">A Catalogue of Dictionaries, Vocabularies, Grammars and Alphabets</span>, privately printed in 1796. In 1812 he published <span class="italic">A Dictionary of the Malayan Language</span>, a project he began in 1786 but for which he had found little time with his subsequent appointments. Though not the first such study, Marsden's dictionary was distinctive for its focus on the Malay&#150;English section&#151;the &#145;essential part of the work&#146;&#151;at 371 pages, and in his use of &#145;examples of phrases and sentences &hellip; as they have occurred in the writings of the natives&#146;  (Jones, 1.xii). In 1818 he produced <span class="italic">The Travels of Marco Polo</span>, a translation from the Italian, and in 1823 and 1825 the two volumes of <span class="italic">Numismata orientalia illustrata</span> from his own coin collection. In 1827 he had printed a catalogue of his library, as <span class="italic">Bibliotheca Marsdeniana philologica et orientalis, a catalogue of works and manuscripts collected with a view to the general comparison of languages and to the study of oriental literature</span>. He added to this <span class="italic">Nakhoda Muda, Memoirs of a Malayan Family</span>, issued for the Oriental Translation Fund in 1830, and in 1834 a volume of miscellaneous <span class="italic">Works</span> comprising three tracts, one on the Polynesian languages, one on a conventional roman alphabet for oriental languages, and, in a return to the subject of lexicography, &#145;Thoughts on the composition of a national English dictionary&#146;. Besides this he contributed papers to academic society journals, most notably &#145;The era of the Mahometans&#146; for the <span class="italic">Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society</span> in 1788, and a piece on the language and Indian origin of gypsies for <span class="italic">Archaeologia</span>.<br>
<br>After moving to Edge Grove, Marsden leased a house at 50 Queen Anne Street from 1825 in order to have a London residence again. He was present at the founding of the Raleigh Club in 1827, and of the Royal Geographical Society in May 1830. As a gesture to the government he publicly forwent his Admiralty pension of &pound;1500 a year from 1831, on the grounds that he had accumulated enough wealth for the remainder of his life. Marsden presented his collection of over 3400 oriental coins to the British Museum on 12 July 1834, and, on the premiss that the British Museum already possessed duplicates of many of the books he owned, his library of books and manuscripts to King's College, London, on 30 January 1835. Marsden's library is now shared by the libraries of King's College and the School of Oriental and African Studies in the University of London.<br>
<br>Marsden had suffered from apoplexy in 1833, and died of an attack on 6 October 1836. He was buried in Kensal Green cemetery. He was survived by his wife; there were no children of the marriage. Elizabeth subsequently remarried; her second husband was the numismatist Lieutenant-Colonel William Martin Leake. In 1838 she edited and published <span class="italic">A brief memoir of the life and writings of the late William Marsden, D.C.L., F.R.S., &amp;c. &amp;c., written by himself</span>. Orientalist, numismatist, and antiquary, Marsden had developed the means to be a successful private scholar, as well as an effective public servant. He valued the society of which he found himself a part more for the stimulus and the intellectual quality of the company it afforded him, and he contributed in turn. Self-indulgent in his ambitions, he was conscientious in pursuit of them.<br>
