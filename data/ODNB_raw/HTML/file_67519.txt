<span class="headword">Graham,  John</span>, fourth earl of Montrose  (1573&#150;1626), <span class="occ">nobleman</span>, was the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/11207/', "John Graham, third earl of Montrose (1548&#150;1608)")</script>, an extraordinary lord of session, lord high treasurer, chancellor, and commissioner-general under James VI, and Jean (<i>d</i>. 1598), daughter of David Drummond, Lord Drummond. He received a charter of lands from his father in 1581. He married (contract of 12 December 1593) Lady Margaret, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/24375/', "William Ruthven, first earl of Gowrie")</script>. She predeceased him, and was buried on 15 April 1618. They had one son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/11194/', "James Graham, fifth earl and first marquess of Montrose (1612&#150;1650)")</script>, the covenanting and later royalist leader, and there may have been another son, called John, who died in infancy. At least four of their six daughters survived into adulthood, marrying into various landed families. With an unknown mistress he had a son, John, who was involved in the covenanting wars and was last recorded at his half-brother's funeral in 1661.<br>
<br>Montrose was involved in national politics from the age of about twenty-three, attending a convention of estates at Perth in 1597 as master of Montrose. Under that title he was admitted to the privy council in March 1604, the king noting &#145;that it is expedient that men of his rank and qualitie sould in thair youth be trayned up in imployment in our affairis, that, being of rype age, they may be the mair capable&#146;  (<span class="italic">Reg. PCS</span>, 1st ser., 6.605). He carried the great seal at the parliaments of 1604 and 1606, presided over by his father, and succeeded to the earldom on his father's death in November 1608. He was soon after placed in an embarrassing predicament by James VI who had promised 40,000 merks (&pound;26,666 13<i>s</i>. 4<i>d</i>. Scots) for the funeral expenses &#145;but the promise was not performed, which drew on the greater burthein of his sonne&#146;  (Calderwood, 7.38). Although he received licence from the privy council to travel abroad in 1609 and 1613, he remained in Scotland.<br>
<br>Montrose attended the parliaments of 1609 and 1617, was elected one of the lords of the articles on both occasions, and was appointed to a parliamentary commission on heritable offices in 1617. He was a member of the archiepiscopal court of high commission for the province of St Andrews from 1610 and was reappointed to the unified high commission in 1615. As the king's commissioner to the general assembly at Aberdeen in 1616 he was commanded to &#145;order the laitie&#146; who attended. He was given the same task in the following year, &#145;but excused himself with sickeness&#146;  (Calderwood, 7.222, 284). In March 1626 Charles I appointed him to the newly established commission for grievances and he was named president of the privy council. Thereafter he attended meetings of the council rarely, probably because of failing health, and was summoned to attend on a number of occasions. He died at Kincardine Castle on 14 November 1626 and was buried at Aberuthven on 3 January 1627.<br>
