<span class="headword">Cornford <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Darwin]</span>,  Frances Crofts</span>  (1886&#150;1960), <span class="occ">poet</span>, was born in Cambridge on 30 March 1886, the only child of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32717/', "Sir Francis Darwin (1848&#150;1925)")</script> and his second wife, Ellen Wordsworth Crofts (1856&#150;1903), daughter of John Crofts, of Leeds. Ellen was a lecturer in English at Newnham College, Cambridge. Francis Darwin, then lecturer in botany at Cambridge, was the third son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7176/', "Charles Darwin")</script>, whom he had helped with his biological researches. Frances was half-sister to the writer and golfing expert Bernard Darwin, the only child of her father's first marriage. Her education was private, and during her childhood her chief associates were her cousins, the children of George Darwin and Horace Darwin. Her mother died when she was seventeen; her father then moved their home for a short time to London, but soon returned to Cambridge where Frances spent most of the rest of her life.<br>
<br>In the summer of 1908 members of the Cambridge Marlowe Dramatic Society arranged a performance of <span class="italic">Comus</span> as part of a Milton tercentenary celebration at Christ's College, where Frances Darwin met <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32571/', "Francis Macdonald Cornford (1874&#150;1943)")</script>, a fellow of Trinity College and afterwards Laurence professor of ancient philosophy at Cambridge, who had been cast for the part of Comus. They were married in 1909. Their home at Conduit Head off the Madingley Road soon became a meeting-place for artists and men of letters such as Will Rothenstein, Eric Gill, Lowes Dickinson, Bertrand Russell, and occasional visitors such as Rabindranath Tagore. The Cornfords had five children. Their eldest son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/37313/', "(Rupert) John Cornford")</script>, was killed in Spain, in December 1936. The second son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/51618/', "Christopher Francis Cornford")</script>, became an artist and in 1963 was appointed the first dean of the Royal College of Art in London.<br>
<br>Frances Darwin, with intellect and artistic sensibility strongly represented in her forebears, started writing poetry at sixteen and subsequently published enough to entitle her to a distinguished place among the minor poets of the Georgian period and later years. Her first volume, <span class="italic">Poems</span> (1910), brought somewhat embarrassing fame for &#145;To a Fat Lady Seen from a Train&#146;, which became a standard anthology piece and was parodied by G. K. Chesterton. Rupert Brooke was one of her closest friends and she was always eager to profit by his criticism and that of others such as Christopher Hassall and Sir Edward Marsh. She was herself always ready to give help of the same kind to younger writers. One of her early books was a &#145;morality&#146; play, <span class="italic">Death and the Princess</span> (1912). With the publication of later volumes of poetry, <span class="italic">Different Days</span> (1928), <span class="italic">Mountains and Molehills</span> (1934), and <span class="italic">Travelling Home</span> (1948), the quiet but distinctive quality of her work began to be recognized. She was not influenced by the poetic trends set by T. S. Eliot and Ezra Pound and her short, often epigrammatic, poems are characterized by visual acuity and quiet humour. In 1954 her volume <span class="italic">Collected Poems</span> was the official &#145;choice&#146; of the Poetry Book Society and in 1959 she was awarded the queen's medal for poetry. She also tried her hand with some success at verse translations, publishing <span class="italic">Poems from the Russian</span> (1943, assisted by Esther Salaman) and a selection (1950) from the French of Paul Eluard. Three of her books were decorated with woodcuts by her cousin Gwen Raverat, and one had cuts by Eric Gill.<br>
<br>Frances Cornford was of medium height and of brown complexion, with dark hair and eyes. Her appearance was striking and attractive rather than beautiful, her attractions being increased by her gentle friendliness, her amusing conversation, and her wish to enter with warmth and imagination into the feelings and emotions of her many friends. In the ordinary affairs of life she was endearingly vague and unpractical, with an extraordinary capacity for mislaying her possessions. She had not been baptized and was brought up without religion. Initially, she wrote as a troubled agnostic. Later, however, she accepted with deep conviction the faith of the Church of England. Her sensitive nature led to her suffering from several periods of deep depression, the first one following the shock of her mother's death. Each time, however, she made a good, though slow, recovery and she lived to the age of seventy-four; she died of heart failure at her home, 10 Millington Road, Cambridge, on 19 August 1960. She was buried at St Giles's cemetery, Cambridge.<br>
