<span class="headword">Hogg,  James Macnaghten  McGarel</span>, first Baron Magheramorne  (1823&#150;1890), <span class="occ">civic administrator</span>, eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13473/', "Sir James Weir Hogg, first baronet (1790&#150;1876)")</script>, chairman of the East India Company, and his wife, Mary Claudine Swinton (<i>d</i>. 1874), was born at Calcutta on 3 May 1823. The merchant and philanthropist <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/33926/', "Quintin Hogg")</script> was his younger brother. He was educated at Eton College and Christ Church, Oxford, where he matriculated in May 1842. Considered &#145;a very good boy, if not a particularly brilliant scholar&#146;  (Owen, 158), he left Oxford in 1843 to join the 1st Life Guards. He became major and lieutenant-colonel in 1855, retiring from the army in August 1859. On 31 August 1857 he married Caroline Elizabeth Emma (1834&#150;1924), eldest daughter of Edward Gordon Douglas-Pennant, later first Lord Penrhyn. The couple had five sons and one daughter.<br>
<br>Son of a Peelite Conservative, Hogg remained loyal to the Conservative Party after the corn-law split, representing Bath as MP from 1865 to 1868 and Truro from 1871 to 1885. From 1885 until his accession to the peerage in 1887 he sat for the Hornsey division of Middlesex. In May 1876 he succeeded his father as second baronet, and in February 1877 he assumed the additional surname of McGarel by royal licence on succeeding to the estates of his brother-in-law, Charles McGarel of Magheramorne, Antrim. McGarel Hogg was raised to the peerage as Baron Magheramorne in July 1887.<br>
<br>In 1867 Hogg became a member of the Metropolitan Board of Works, the authority elected by members of the capital's secondary authorities to handle London-wide functions such as main drainage and street improvements, representing St George's, Hanover Square. In November 1870 he was elected chairman of the board. He expected to serve only one year as chairman, the Home Office having indicated that reform of metropolitan government was imminent; in the event he remained chairman until the board's eventual abolition in 1889. The chairmanship brought him the KCB on the completion of the Chelsea Embankment in 1874, but it also ensured that his reputation was permanently stained by the scandals which engulfed the board in its final years. Speculation by board members and officers in land acquired for street improvements prompted the appointment of a royal commission into the board in 1888. Though the commission heard that the board's balances were kept at a bank of which he was a director  (Davis, 109), Magheramorne (as Hogg had by then become) was not under suspicion for the failings of his subordinates, but his appearance before the commission, when his explanation of the board's functions required frequent prompting from the board's counsel, was unimpressive. If the board was divided, as W. T. Stead claimed, into &#145;clever knaves who jobbed and virtuous nobodies who winked&#146;  (Owen, 207), Magheramorne belonged to the second group, but the commission's report was unquestionably a condemnation of his light-handed chairmanship. Deteriorating health during the 1880s, his duties as an MP, and his frequent trips to Ireland left him dangerously unaware of the board's day-to-day operations, and made his tenaciously protective defence of the board from valid criticism hard to excuse.<br>
<br>Though described in 1887 as a &#145;fine-looking, soldierly man, with clear-cut features, and snow-white hair&#146;  (Owen, 159), Magheramorne's final years were darkened by ill health, intensified by the Metropolitan Board of Works scandal, and he died on 27 June 1890 at his home in 17 Grosvenor Gardens, London. He was buried at Brompton cemetery. Only the first of his five sons married, producing no heir, and his Irish barony passed to his first three sons in succession, becoming extinct with the death of Ronald, the fourth Baron Magheramorne, in 1957.<br>
