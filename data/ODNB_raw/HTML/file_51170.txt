<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Kearton,  (Christopher) Frank</span>, Baron Kearton  (1911&#150;1992), <span class="occ">scientist and industrialist</span>, was born on 17 February 1911 at Congleton in Cheshire, the only child of Christopher John Kearton and his wife, Lilian, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Hancock. Shortly afterwards the family moved to Tunstall in the Potteries. His father, a bricklayer, was one of five brothers all of whom, at the insistence of their father, became skilled craftsmen. It is believed that the family came originally from Yorkshire where they farmed at the remote end of Swaledale; there is a village 15 miles west of Richmond named Kearton. Kearton attended Hanley high school, from where he went to St John's College, Oxford, as an open exhibitioner in 1929. He read chemistry and graduated with first-class honours in natural science (chemistry) in 1933. He was one of many who was fortunate in having H. W. (Tommy) Thompson as tutor. It is of interest that he did not in fact present himself for the conferment of his BA and MA until 1959&#151;perhaps an early example of his impatience to move to the next task. On 16 April 1936 he married Agnes Kathleen 
    (Kay; <i>d</i>. 1997)
  , the daughter of Samuel Pratt Brander, schoolmaster, who, after taking an honours degree in French at Bedford College, London, taught at Morecambe grammar school. They met while they were both at school through a common interest in tennis. They had two sons and two daughters.<br>
<br>Kearton was tall and well built; he was energetic, extrovert, articulate, and forceful. His restless energy and ambition frequently led him into controversy, but he invariably acted in what he saw to be the national interest. He had a lively, if sometimes sarcastic, sense of humour. He did not smoke, and drank but little, but had a healthy appetite. His leisure was taken up with his family which, whatever the pressures, was an overriding priority&#151;he rejoiced in their successes and shared their problems and disappointments. He was devoted to his wife, and she, and his whole family and their doings, sustained and refreshed him&#151;he was not immune to disappointment and frustration. He was a voracious reader. His business life was austere but he delighted to entertain at his beautiful old home in Whitchurch, and to conduct his guests on an exhaustive and exhausting tour of his garden, in which he spent so much time.<h2>
<a name="Earlycareer"></a>Early career</h2>Upon graduation in 1933 Kearton joined the Billingham division of Imperial Chemical Industries Ltd (ICI). Thus began a career in which he played a major part in a wide range of industries&#151;chemicals, nuclear, man-made fibres, textiles, and oil&#151;and also, through the Industrial Reorganization Corporation (IRC), contributed to industrial development in Britain over an even wider front. He simultaneously took on a succession of diverse public appointments, concerned, <i>inter alia</i>, with the reorganization of the railways, the Atomic Energy Authority, the generation and supply of electricity, the development of scientific and technical policy, and the promotion of trade and investment between Britain and central and eastern Europe.<br>
<br>Kearton was a scientist, but the nature of his contribution over much of his career was typified by the job he took on his second day with ICI; he started at 6 a.m. as a shift operative on chemical plants working a fifty-six hour week, soon becoming shift manager and later refinery manager. Perhaps the most significant event in these early years was his inclusion as one of seven members of a newly formed unit to carry out chemical engineering research. It was one of the first of its kind in Britain and Kearton acquired familiarity with the multidisciplinary skills which he was to apply with such success in many fields.<h2>
<a name="Theatomicbombproject"></a>The atomic bomb project</h2>Kearton's growing reputation in technical development work led to his being chosen to join a team formed by Wallace Akers who had himself been seconded from ICI in 1941 to lead, under Sir John Anderson, the British atomic bomb project, known by the codename Directorate of Tube Alloys. Although the phenomenon of nuclear fission had been confirmed in 1939, official scientific opinion throughout the world remained sceptical of its practical utility, and work to harness fission proceeded with little urgency. The theoretical work of R. E. Peierls and O. R. Frisch at Birmingham led to their memorandum of March 1940 in which they showed that it should be possible to make a bomb using as little as 5 kilogrammes of uranium 235, a naturally occurring isotope of uranium; they also outlined a possible means of separating this isotope and of constructing an explosive device. The impact of this memorandum was immediate and led to the rapid expansion of work in Britain and in the USA. Kearton worked on liaison with academics and on co-ordination of the work within ICI. Eventually he was responsible for the experimental station in north Wales which established the design features for an isotope separation plant.<br>
<br>The August 1943 Quebec agreement re-established a degree of collaboration with the United States' atomic bomb programme&#151;the Manhattan project. The massive US effort had created a substantial lead over progress in Britain. The British government decided to transfer key scientists and engineers to the USA. Kearton went both to pass on unique British know-how, and to liaise between the scientists on both sides of the Atlantic. The work which he did is contained in 132 formal reports and in numerous letters. There is no doubt that in addition to his direct contribution he was able to make much use of his experience in the British post-war work on atomic energy. He also saw at first hand what could be achieved when a country harnessed its total resources to a clear objective; even today it is difficult to appreciate the huge physical and intellectual achievements of the Manhattan project in such a short time. This, and the construction of sophisticated manufacturing plants in a fraction of the time commonly accepted as normal in Britain, made a lasting impression. He also suffered two disappointments. He was one of many who did not think that the atomic bomb would be used and was dismayed when it was. His other, personal, regret came later. He worked with Klaus Fuchs in the USA; indeed they shared an office. Their friendship continued when both returned to Britain and Fuchs was a frequent visitor to Kearton's home. When suspicion of his espionage was aroused in 1949 it also fell on Kearton, who later described the period as &#145;the worst time in my life&#146;.<h2>
<a name="TheCourtauldsyears"></a>The Courtaulds years</h2>Kearton returned to ICI in 1945 but found the lack of challenge not to his taste. He joined Courtaulds, prompted by a speech made by A. H. Wilson, their newly appointed research director, describing a programme of reconstruction and investment. During the war Courtaulds had lost its American business (sold under pressure as a <i>quid pro quo</i> for the passage of the Lend Lease legislation) which in the 1930s had contributed more than half the total trading profits of the group. This created an urgent need to modernize existing, ageing, factories, to expand capacity, and to increase spending on research and development, in order to regain its position in the man-made fibre industry and to rebuild earnings. This was the company which Kearton joined.<br>
<br>Kearton spent twenty-nine years with Courtaulds, the first six years in research and development, with an ever widening remit, which led to his appointment to the board in 1952. The following ten years saw his influence grow throughout all the areas of the business, accompanied by both organic growth and acquisition, in which he was in the van; later, having led the opposition which defeated the bid made by ICI at the end of 1961, in 1962 he became chairman, retiring in 1975. The ICI bid brought him to public notice. While he was certainly not alone on the board in opposing the ICI proposal he led the opposition, and his quick thinking, confidence, and ability to articulate the arguments, often in colourful language, made him the man of the hour.<br>
<br>In 1946 Kearton joined a medium-sized company which was technically innovative, poorly managed, short of management potential, and severely weakened by the war. When he retired Courtaulds was a major international company in its chosen fields of forest products, fibres, chemicals, plastics, packaging, textiles, and marine and industrial coatings; highly profitable and with a strong balance sheet. The management which achieved this was led by a new team, forged by Kearton. His vision, drive, energy, and leadership were an inspiration. Of course he made mistakes: anyone who set out to do what he did, in the industrial and social climate of the time, inevitably did so, but they were dwarfed by his achievements.<br>
<br>Kearton's management methods and style were less admired. His authoritarian manner was fed by his undoubted success. His relationships with his board colleagues were often strained. His criticisms of what he saw as inadequate performance were delivered harshly and were often intensely personal. He believed that continued pressure could bring results, and that those who could not withstand such pressure were fundamentally unsuited to manage. This outlook damaged some careers irretrievably. He believed that softness at the top had a malign influence throughout the organization. He could be extremely kind on a personal basis to those who suffered private misfortune or family illness&#151;but he did not parade these kindnesses.<br>
<br>Kearton has been described, deliberately, as an industrialist. He was less successful as a businessman. He had little feeling for the market place, and was often cavalier in his dealings with customers. His relations with the City were uneasy; he was often impulsive and was over-influenced by personalities, which sometimes led to errors of judgement. His relations with Whitehall and with the trade unions were ambivalent. On the one hand he took full advantage of tax and other government incentives for new investment, but he made no effort to cultivate relations with officials, whom he sometimes treated with contempt. With the unions he maintained a duality of approach. On the one hand he treated them as an obstacle to his drive for increased efficiency and profits, while on the other he strove to build personal relationships with the union leaders of the day.<h2>
<a name="Publicappointments"></a>Public appointments</h2>Kearton was appointed a member of the special advisory group of the British Transport Commission in 1960 by Ernest Marples, minister of transport. The total lack of any objectives or strategic aims for the management of the railways upon nationalization in 1948, and the absence of any guidance on the balance between the social needs of a public service and commercial viability, led to mounting losses and complete muddle in management. The group was charged with advising the minister on the resolution of this dilemma. Appointed in April, it reported in October. Its report was confidential but clearly formed the core of the white paper presented to parliament in December. The group, chaired by Sir Ivan Stedeford, comprised Henry Benson, Richard Beeching, Kearton, and two civil servants. Their achievement in six months was remarkable. They probed deeply into the facts and into management organization and practice and brought out into the open the dire situation. Their work led to the fundamental restructuring of the railways in which Beeching played such a central role and, in spite of much criticism, it saved the railways.<br>
<br>Not surprisingly Kearton's wartime experiences made him in great demand in the British nuclear programme. Indeed, from 1946 onwards repeated attempts were made to recruit him into the Atomic Energy Authority (AEA) in various capacities. None was successful but he nevertheless played an important part-time role in special technical tasks, and as a member of the Fleck inquiry into the 1957 Windscale fire, the worst known nuclear accident at that time. He was a part-time member of the AEA from 1955 to 1981. He was also a member of the Electricity Supply Research Council, 1954&#150;77 (chairman 1960&#150;77), a member of the Central Electricity Generating Board, 1974&#150;80, and a member of the committee of inquiry into the structure of the electricity supply industry, 1974&#150;5. His contributions across the whole gamut of nuclear issues centred upon his belief that a unified national policy was necessary&#151;an issue still unresolved.<br>
<br>Perhaps the most direct involvement by Kearton in national industrial policy was his appointment as chairman of the Industrial Reorganization Corporation (IRC). This body was formed by the 1964 Wilson government, which believed that to achieve the full impact of modern technology intervention was necessary. There was a widespread view, not only among politicians, that British management was inadequate to bring about the changes needed to achieve international competitiveness. The IRC was set up to be an instrument of industrial policy and not a political tool as some had hoped. The choice of Kearton, known for his personal drive and his intolerance of bureaucratic interference, as chairman, and a board largely composed of successful industrialists, ensured its independence. In its short existence (it was formed at the end of 1966 and did its final deal in 1971) it had a remarkable impact; and it did so with small resources. Its staff never exceeded thirty in total, with some ten executives at any one time, and a total of only twenty-two throughout its existence. The executives came mainly from the private sector, with no formal contracts and on the understanding that they would serve for about two years.<br>
<br>The IRC had a crucial impact upon the motor industry, and upon the steps which led to the formation of the General Electric Company (GEC); and it was involved in some fifty mergers embracing, <i>inter alia</i>, textiles, instrumentation, paper, and engineering. The success of what it set out to do was not based upon coercion. On the contrary, the board determined that it should act only upon industrial and commercial logic, but with an eye to international strength. It did not have, or use, huge sums of money. In fact it used only about one-third of the &pound;150 million made available. Its success rested upon three factors. What it sought to do went with the grain of prevailing industrial opinion; it was small and able to move quickly&#151;the responsible executive, the managing director, and the chairman, met daily; and the executives were outstanding&#151;young, ambitious, idealistic, and able. It was not by chance that many of them later became some of the most successful business leaders of their generation.<br>
<br>All of these tasks, and others not described here, were part-time. None lessened Kearton's hands-on management and direction of Courtaulds; indeed, they seemed to act as a further stimulus to action. His usual practice was to devote a set part of the day, often up to mid-morning, solely to the current public task, and then to spend the rest of the day on Courtaulds' affairs.<h2>
<a name="TheBritishNationalOilCorporation"></a>The British National Oil Corporation</h2>On 21 July 1975, the day before he was to retire from Courtaulds, Kearton met Tony Benn, the secretary of state for energy. They knew and respected each other. Within days Kearton had been appointed chairman designate of the British National Oil Corporation (BNOC). There were major differences of opinion between ministers as to the role of BNOC. Some were anxious to do nothing without the concurrence of the major oil companies. Others, including Benn, wanted BNOC to have a major commercial role. Kearton soon decided that the company must, in the national interest, have a direct involvement in the development of the North Sea. The arguments within government and between government and the oil companies dragged on, and Kearton became even more convinced of the role that BNOC should have, and increasingly frustrated by the lack of decision. It was one of the most active and turbulent periods of his career. Eventually BNOC was given participation rights and involvement in bidding for exploration licences, in spite of the continued protests of the oil companies. In 1979, its fourth year of operation, BNOC had a turnover of &pound;3245 million and made a pre-tax profit of &pound;75 million. In that same year it was involved in the drilling of nearly half the exploration wells on the continental shelf. By the end of the year it held agreements which gave it options on up to 51 per cent of the petroleum produced on the UK continental shelf. This, from a standing start, and against bitter opposition, was almost unbelievable. Kearton's successor as chairman, R. E. Utiger, wrote in 1980: &#145;I do not think that any other man could have created this Corporation in such a short time.&#146;<h2>
<a name="Honoursawardsandassessment"></a>Honours, awards, and assessment</h2>Kearton was made OBE in 1945 for his war work, knighted in 1966, and created a life peer, as Baron Kearton of Whitchurch, in 1970. Among many honours and appointments he was made a fellow of the Royal Society in 1971, and received ten honorary degrees and four honorary fellowships. He particularly treasured his appointment as chancellor of the University of Bath, from 1980 to 1992, in which he was notably proactive; Professor J. R. Quayle, the vice-chancellor, wrote a generous and moving tribute to his chancellorship in the <span class="italic">Bath Report</span> of 3 July 1992 on the day following his death.<br>
<br>When Kearton was made a life peer in 1970 he was deeply involved in industrial and academic affairs and played little part in the house. Once he did begin to attend regularly &#145;there was no stopping him&#146;, as a friend and fellow peer recalled  (Wooding, 238). He was much respected and had a wide circle of friends. He served on several select committees, covering a wide range of issues, especially those concerned with European affairs; energy and manufacturing; science, technology, and innovation; and overseas trade. His participation was characterized by his penetrating insight, his direct style of speech which, as another peer wrote, &#145;could verge on the picturesque&#146;  (ibid., 238), and his unfailing courtesy to witnesses. He continued to attend the house and to take a full part even when he was desperately ill. His death from cancer at Stoke Mandeville Hospital, Buckinghamshire, on 2 July 1992 was seen as a tremendous loss. He was buried at Whitchurch.<br>
<br>Kearton had boundless energy, and was impatient and sometimes intolerant, unable to resist a challenge, whether concerned with national industrial affairs, <span class="italic">The Times</span> crossword, a popular radio quiz, or the village vegetable competition. His capacity for sustained effort and digestion of papers was legendary, as was his practice of communication with anyone at any level in the organizations with which he worked&#151;frequently by hastily written cards, almost indecipherable, and usually containing cryptic messages which were stimulating or demoralizing, or both. His management style was not to everyone's taste. In dealing with people he sought to stiffen resolve and to test reaction to pressure; and thereby to convey the urgency and importance of the issue. He respected a robust response and could be both critical and inspiring. Some saw his many activities as driven by personal ambition. But this was only part of it. He had a deeply held belief in the future of his country. He believed in social justice, but had no time for the mere redistribution of wealth. Rather, he believed in the creation of wealth by the application of efficient management and modern technology. He believed in the importance of manufacturing industry and in individual enterprise; but he also believed that it was right to harness the country's total resources for the national good. He was a patriot.<br>
