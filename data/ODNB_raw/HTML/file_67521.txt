<span class="headword">Carnegie,  John</span>, first earl of Northesk  (1578/9&#150;1667), <span class="occ">nobleman</span>, was the second son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/69925/', "David Carnegie of Colluthie and Kinnaird (d. 1598)")</script> and his second wife, Euphame Wemyss (<i>d</i>. 1593), daughter of Sir John Wemyss of that ilk. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/4717/', "David Carnegie, first earl of Southesk (1574/5&#150;1658)")</script>, was his elder brother. On 1 March 1595 he received a charter of the barony of Ethie from James VI, his father having resigned the lands into the king's hands, and this grant was confirmed by the king in 1604. In December 1609 he left Scotland to travel on the continent, visiting Marseilles and Paris where, according to his correspondence, he went to some lengths to buy a clock. He returned to Britain in the latter part of 1610 and was knighted. He acquired various lands in Forfarshire (Angus) and became its sheriff-principal in July 1620.<br>
<br>Carnegie was initially opposed to the national covenant of 1638, and in 1639 he and a number of others of like mind attempted to leave Scotland. Stayed at Dunbar by storms, however, they were arrested and briefly imprisoned. On 20 April of that year Charles I raised Carnegie to the peerage as Lord Lour. He must have subscribed the covenant, for he attended parliament quite regularly during the 1640s and was in 1641 appointed to the first committee of estates, and in 1644 was made a member of the committee of war for Angus and the Mearns. In November 1647 he was made earl of Ethie, Lord Lour and Eglismaldie, and in the following year was again appointed to the committee of estates. His first marriage, some time after March 1610, was to Magdalen, daughter of Sir James Haliburton of Pitcur and widow of John Erskine of Dun. They had three sons and five daughters. She died on 10 March 1650, and on 29 April 1652 he married Marjory, daughter of Andrew Maule of Guildie and widow of William Nairne. They had no children.<br>
<br>During the Cromwellian occupation of Scotland, Ethie was fined &pound;6000 sterling under Cromwell's ordinance of pardon and grace in April 1654, although an appeal reduced this to only &pound;2000. After the restoration of Charles II, he succeeded his younger brother Sir Robert Carnegie of Dunnichen as dempster of parliament and of the justice and circuit courts of Forfarshire. In 1663 he was appointed by parliament a justice of the peace for Forfarshire. By a patent dated 25 October 1666 Ethie obtained a change in his titles, becoming earl of Northesk, Lord Rosehill and Eglismauldie. He died at Ethie on 8 January 1667, aged eighty-eight, and was buried in the family burial place at Inverkeilor kirk.<br>
