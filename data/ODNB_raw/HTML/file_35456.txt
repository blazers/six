<span class="headword">Peet,  (Thomas) Eric</span>  (1882&#150;1934), <span class="occ">Egyptologist</span>, was born in Liverpool on 12 August 1882, the eldest son of at least three children of Thomas Peet, corn merchant, of that city, and his wife, Salome Fowler. He was educated at Merchant Taylors' School, Liverpool, from 1893 and in 1901 obtained a Jodrell mathematics scholarship at the Queen's College, Oxford, where he was awarded a second class in classical and in mathematical moderations (both 1903) and in <i>literae humaniores</i> (1905). He then spent a term as a schoolteacher in Walsall. During his last year at Oxford David Randall-MacIver interested him in the then unexploited Italian prehistoric period; on a small grant from the Craven fund he made a brief reconnaissance in Italy, and in 1906 easily gained a Craven fellowship. During the next three years he explored early Italian and Maltese sites and wrote <span class="italic">The Stone and Bronze Ages in Italy and Sicily</span> (1909), which became the standard work on the subject. He was Pelham student at the British School of Archaeology in Rome in 1909. But, Italian archaeology offering no permanent livelihood, Peet turned to Egypt. In 1909 he excavated at Abydos, first under John Garstang for the Liverpool Institute of Archaeology, and afterwards for the Egypt Exploration Fund (later Society) from 1909 to 1913 under Edouard Naville and then independently; the results of his work for the fund are contained in <span class="italic">The Cemeteries of Abydos</span>, parts 1&#150;3 (1913&#150;14). He married in autumn 1910 Mary Florence, daughter of Richard Johnson Lawton, civil engineer, of Chiswick; they had a daughter, Patricia Mary.<br>
<br>From 1913 to 1928 Peet was lecturer in Egyptology at Manchester University. His next book was <span class="italic">The Inscriptions of Sinai</span>, part 1 (edited in collaboration with Alan Henderson Gardiner, 1917). In 1915 he obtained a commission in the Royal Army Service Corps, and showed great ability at Salonika, where he and one other man supervised the whole of the landing of supplies in 1916&#150;17. By the summer of 1918 he was serving in France as a lieutenant in the 14th battalion of the King's Liverpool regiment.<br>
<br>Demobilized early in 1919, Peet was elected in the following year to the Brunner chair of Egyptology at Liverpool University, which Percy Edward Newberry had resigned in his favour. Early in 1921 he directed a season's excavations at Tell al-Amarna for the Egypt Exploration Society. In 1923 he became Laycock student of Egyptology at Worcester College, Oxford. At the outset of his Egyptological career Peet realized the importance of a good knowledge of the Egyptian language and writing, for which he had a remarkable gift, and these became his chief interest in later life; in several of his most important works (for example, <span class="italic">The Mayer Papyri</span>, 1920; <span class="italic">The Rhind Mathematical Papyrus</span>, 1923; and <span class="italic">The Great Tomb-Robberies of the Twentieth Egyptian Dynasty</span>, 1930) he dealt with important texts in the often very difficult hieratic or cursive script, of which he had exceptional mastery. His <span class="italic">Egypt and the Old Testament</span> (1922) discussed with rare critical skill the biblical records of Egyptian contacts. In 1929 his Schweich lectures (published in 1931 as <span class="italic">A Comparative Study of the Literature of Egypt, Palestine and Mesopotamia</span>) broke fresh ground. Among his many activities he found time to edit the University of Liverpool's <span class="italic">Annals of Archaeology and Anthropology</span> from 1921 (from 1925 jointly), and the <span class="italic">Journal of Egyptian Archaeology</span> from 1923 until his death. He remained in the Brunner chair until 1933, when he was elected reader in Egyptology at Oxford and a fellow of Queen's. His tenure of these positions was short-lived, for shortly before the readership had been definitely converted into a chair he died unexpectedly on 22 February 1934 in the Acland Nursing Home, Oxford, after an operation to treat a throat condition. He was buried two days later in Wolvercote cemetery, Oxford. His wife survived him.<br>
<br>Peet's services to his science were many, and he was perhaps the best example that England has produced of an all-round Egyptologist, equally able in the field, the study, and the lecture theatre, in archaeology and philology, in the historic and prehistoric periods. Two areas in which he excelled were Egyptian history (he contributed largely to the <span class="italic">Cambridge Ancient History</span>) and mathematics. His other main interests were cricket (he captained for his school), tennis, swimming, walking, and music. In appearance he could be solemn or even glum until his interest was caught, but he nevertheless enjoyed the company of his friends; he was remembered for his modesty, kindness, and sense of responsibility.<br>
