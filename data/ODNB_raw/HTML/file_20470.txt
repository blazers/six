<span class="headword">O'Brien,  William</span>  (1738?&#150;1815), <span class="occ">actor and playwright</span>, the son of a fencing master, was related to the O'Briens, viscounts Clare, who, having lost their fortunes supporting the Stuart cause, joined the Irish brigade in France. He was apparently &#145;bred&#146; to the fencing profession but abandoned it for the stage. While performing in Dublin the handsome young actor was recruited by David Garrick to replace Henry Woodward, and on 3 October 1758 he made his d&eacute;but at Drury Lane, as Captain Brazen in Farquhar's <span class="italic">The Recruiting Officer</span>. For the next six seasons he played &#145;what Garrick could never reach, coxcombs and men of fashion&#146;  (Walpole, 38.524).<br>
<br>Coached by Garrick, O'Brien quickly became a favourite with London audiences, noted for his easy, natural style and charming, polished manners. It was claimed that &#145;in the drawing of his sword he threw all other performers at a wonderful distance, by his swiftness, grace, and superiour elegance&#146;  (Genest, 4.537). Between 1758 and 1764 he played comic parts, specializing in &#145;harlequin&#146; and fine gentlemen. He created the original roles of Felix in John Hill's <span class="italic">The Rout</span>, Young Clackit in Garrick's <span class="italic">The Guardian</span>, Lovel in James Townley's <span class="italic">High Life below Stairs</span>, Edgar in John Hawkesworth's <span class="italic">Edgar and Emmeline</span>, Belmour in William Whitehead's <span class="italic">The School for Lovers</span>, and Colonel Tamper in the elder George Colman's <span class="italic">The Deuce is in Him</span>. His Mercutio was considered second only to that of Woodward. On 19 October 1763 his Sir Andrew Aguecheek was so comical that one of the sentinels flanking the stage laughed until he fell over, to the unbridled merriment of the house.<br>
<br>On 5 April 1764 O'Brien appeared as Fribble in Garrick's <span class="italic">Miss in her Teens</span> in what was to be his last performance. Two nights later, on Saturday 7 April 1764, he was unavailable to play his assigned part of Lovel in <span class="italic">High Life below Stairs</span>, having that morning married by stratagem at St Paul's Church, Covent Garden, without the knowledge or consent of her family, Lady Susanna Sarah Louisa Fox-Strangways (1743&#150;1827), the daughter of Stephen Fox-Strangways, first earl of Ilchester, and Elizabeth, the daughter of Thomas Strangways Horner. Lady Susan Strangways, as she was known, was the niece of Henry Fox, later first Lord Holland, and a cousin of Charles James Fox, who had a youthful romantic attachment to her. W. M. Thackeray appears to have based the character of Hagan, the Irish actor who marries Lady Maria Esmond in <span class="italic">The Virginians</span>, on O'Brien. Following his marriage, O'Brien withdrew from the stage.<br>
<br>Mr and Lady Susan O'Brien, as they were known, having alienated Lord Ilchester through their impetuous marriage, sailed for America in September 1764, and endured a voluntary exile first in New York, where they were aided financially by Lord Holland and Lady Ilchester, and later in Philadelphia and Quebec. A colonial post under the New York governor, Sir Henry Moore, was secured for O'Brien, and in May 1768 he was made secretary and provost-master-general of Bermuda. The couple returned to England in 1770. Soon after, O'Brien was dismissed from a post under the Ordnance because they refused to return to America.<br>
<br>O'Brien launched a career as a playwright with <span class="italic">Cross Purposes</span> (1772), a farce based on J. de La Font's <span class="italic">Les trois fr&egrave;res rivaux</span> (1713), and <span class="italic">The Duel</span> (1772), a comedy adapted from M. J. Sedaine's <span class="italic">Le philosophe sans le savoir</span> (1765). <span class="italic">Cross Purposes</span>, an afterpiece in two acts with realistic, conversational dialogue, was &#145;acted with great applause&#146; at Covent Garden  (Davies, 2.245) on Saturday 5 December 1772. Three nights later, on 8 December 1772, while <span class="italic">Cross Purposes</span> again played at Covent Garden, <span class="italic">The Duel</span>, as mainpiece, opened at Drury Lane. &#145;The parties engaged in this <i>Duel</i>, not giving the audience <i>satisfaction</i>, were put under an <i>arrest</i>&#146;  (Oulton, 1.9). The play was hissed during the second act and subsequently withdrawn, though some said that it was &#145;unjustly condemned&#146;  (Genest, 5.343) and &#145;deserved a much better fate than it met with&#146;  (Davies, 2.245). <span class="italic">Cross Purposes</span>, however, remained a popular afterpiece for half a century.<br>
<br>O'Brien wrote no more for the stage, but a satirical, sometimes bawdy work known as the <span class="italic">Lusorium</span> (<span class="italic">O'Brien's Lusorium</span>, 1782; <span class="italic">The Lusorium</span>, 2nd edn, 1783; <span class="italic">O'Brien's Lusorium</span>, 3rd edn, 1796) and a pamphlet postscript (<span class="italic">The End of the Lusorium</span>, 1798) have been attributed to him. It is far more probable that they are by the &#145;C. [Charles?] O'Brien&#146; whose name appears in the imprint of the second edition. &#145;C. O'Brien&#146;, printer, stationer, book and music seller, may also have been a minor actor and singer at Sadler's Wells in the 1790s.<br>
<br>After studying unsuccessfully for the law between 1781 and 1783, William O'Brien returned with his wife to Stinsford House, an estate owned by the Strangways family near Dorchester, Dorset, and in later life he attempted to &#145;sink the player, and to bury in oblivion those years of his life which are the most worth being remembered&#146;  (Genest, 4.537). He formed a close friendship with his neighbour William Morton Pitt jun. MP. O'Brien was made commissioner for the island of St Domingo and then granted, through the influence of the earl of Ilchester, with whom over the years the O'Briens had been reconciled, the post of receiver-general of taxes for Dorset, which he held until his death, on 2 September 1815, at Stinsford House. He was buried at Stinsford church on 9 September. O'Brien left his estate to his wife, Lady Susan, his &#145;faithful and inseparable companion&#146;  (Hutchins, 2.567), who died aged eighty-three in 1827. They apparently had no children. O'Brien was eulogized in the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> as &#145;a model of the polished gentleman to those who have attempted the same line of character&#146; and the &#145;most perfect representative of the Man of Fashion that had ever been seen on the stage&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 1st ser., 85, 1815, 285).<br>
