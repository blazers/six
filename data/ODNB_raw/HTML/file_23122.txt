<span class="headword">Randolph,  Thomas</span>  (1525/6&#150;1590), <span class="occ">diplomat</span>, was born at Badlesmere, Kent, the second son of Avery Randolph (<i>d</i>. 1561), landowner, of Badlesmere, Kent, and his wife, Anne (<i>d</i>. in or after 1561), daughter of Sir John Gaynsford of Crowhurst, Surrey, and his first wife, Katherine. One brother was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/23116/', "Edward Randolph (d. 1566)")</script>, a soldier; a sister, Mary, married William Crispe, lieutenant of Dover Castle. Apparently he had at least one more sibling of each sex. Randolph described his Kentish birthplace as a farm, not apparently his father's since he himself bought it later.<h2>
<a name="OxfordexileandfirstjourneytoScotland15451561"></a>Oxford, &#145;exile&#146;, and first journey to Scotland, 1545&#150;1561</h2>Randolph was schooled at Canterbury and went to Oxford with an exhibition from the chapter there. He proceeded BA in October 1545 and BCL in early 1548, when he was twenty-two. On 5 April 1548 the faculty office licensed him as a public notary. After migrating to Christ Church, he acted in this capacity as chapter clerk and also maintained a law studentship there, apparently even after acquiring on 21 November 1549 the (possibly ill-paid) post of principal of Broadgates Hall, the precursor of Pembroke College, specializing in civil law. He supplicated for DCL in October 1566 and June 1575, but did not complete the process. Anthony Wood thought he perhaps got the degree &#145;on one of his embassies&#146;, but lack of reference to him as doctor makes this unlikely  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>: <span class="italic">Fasti</span>, 1.178).<br>
<br>Randolph was the subject of complaints in June 1550 by a Broadgates faction led by Thomas Darbyshire, who became principal under Mary I. Not being a theologian, Randolph was not so blatantly protestant as to suffer immediate expulsion after her accession. He gave shelter to John Jewel, ejected from Corpus Christi. Randolph did resign on 14 October 1553, but three months later Jewel was still with him at Broadgates. The idea that Randolph was a protestant exile is a half-truth. He was the conventional travelling gentleman, with protestant contacts and sympathies. His contacts at Paris were also significantly Scottish, such as George Buchanan, William Kirkcaldy of Grange, and James Melville of Halhill. Melville depicted Randolph as a religious exile in need of his financial help. By Randolph's own account, however, he was openly subsidized by his father.<br>
<br>Dr Nicholas Wotton, Mary's ambassador in France, procured a pardon for Edward Randolph (implicated in the rebellion of Sir Thomas Wyatt the younger) and employed Thomas Randolph occasionally. Following his return to England, in January 1558 Thomas Randolph was elected to parliament for both New Romney in Kent and St Ives in Cornwall, probably under the respective sponsorship of Sir Thomas Cheyne, lord warden of the Cinque Ports and a friend of his father, and Francis Russell, second earl of Bedford. Randolph was again selected by Bedford for St Ives in 1572 and witnessed his will in 1584.<br>
<br>Randolph did not stay in England. In 1561 he claimed that in the previous eight years he had never been able to see his parents two days together. Elizabeth I's accession found him already acting as a diplomatic, if unaccredited, agent in Germany. In December 1558 he said he would accompany the returning exiles Sir Anthony Cooke and Sir Thomas Wroth from Strasbourg to Antwerp. In the new year he was again elected to parliament, this time for Grantham, Lincolnshire, through the influence of Sir William Cecil. Sir Nicholas Throckmorton proposed Randolph as clerk to the privy council. Instead he was sent in June 1559 to Throckmorton's embassy in France before undertaking the delicate task of secretly escorting James Hamilton, earl of Arran, via Geneva and Antwerp to Scotland. Oddly Randolph adopted the alias Thomas Barnaby or Barnabe, a former informant of Cecil.<br>
<br>In late November 1559 the lords of the congregation sent Randolph himself with William Maitland of Lethington south to seek English support, though the Berwick authorities tried too late to persuade him to stay in Scotland after having &#145;so discovered himself&#146; as to compromise Elizabeth's bogus neutrality  (Clifford, 1.588). The French complained about the activities of Barnaby, rather than Randolph, despite his carelessness with his alias. Randolph returned to Glasgow on 25 December, &#145;utterly destitute of anie maner of aide of one of my armes, by reason of a great fluxe of humours that is descended into the same, and also greved with a burnynge fever&#146;  (ibid., 1.665). He continued to press Cecil for a commitment to back Scottish protestantism, having helped encourage the successful intervention of 1560.<h2>
<a name="Randolphandthefailureoftheamity15611566"></a>Randolph and the failure of the amity, 1561&#150;1566</h2>Randolph's expansive and gossipy correspondence serves as a major source for the period after Mary, queen of Scots, returned to Scotland. To an appreciable extent he was seduced by life at Mary's court, an environment for which he was unprepared by experience and in which he occupied a more prominent place than an English diplomat ever could have done in France. His lack of formal ambassadorial rank made him especially susceptible to the flattery of being seated with lords at feasts. His identification with his host government was at times considerable, as in the suppression of the rebellion of George Gordon, fourth earl of Huntly, in 1562 while he was touring Aberdeenshire with Mary. Randolph cultivated a courtly, perhaps even genuine, attachment to one of Mary's ladies, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/70080/', "Mary Beaton (c.1543&#150;1597)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/69949/', "Queen's Maries (act. 1548&#150;1567)")</script>]. Even as late as 1586 it was worth teasing him about the possibility of marriage to &#145;Mrs Beeton&#146;  (BL, Harley MS 6994, fol. 29<i>r</i>).<br>
<br>Randolph was not at this stage naturally allied to Calvinist critics of Mary. Although he helped introduce Scottish reforming ministers to English patrons, his sympathy was rather with his old visitor Jewel, now bishop of Salisbury, whose <span class="italic">Apologia pro ecclesia Anglicana</span> (1562) he presented to James Stewart, first earl of Moray, and which he rather optimistically asserted could be generally accepted by Scottish reformers. Randolph was sceptical of the &#145;exact severity&#146; of John Knox, &#145;thoughe I acknowledge his doctryne to be sounde&#146;. He was &#145;as wylfull as lerned&#146; and acted &#145;as thoughe he were &hellip; of Godes previe consell, that knewe howe he had determined of her [Mary] from the begynnynge&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP Scot.</span>, <i>1547&#150;63</i>, 564, 597, 672).<br>
<br>Randolph could not be accredited to the Scottish queen in her absence, but even on Mary's return he was not officially titled ambassador and was only allowed &pound;1 6<i>s</i>. 8<i>d</i>. per day (later in his career he received &pound;2 per day). The idea of a cheap posting was doubtful given Randolph's activity as a correspondent and courtier, but he was never paid the kind of allowance an ambassador of higher status would expect. Shortly before being expelled from Scotland in 1566 he claimed to be too indebted to &#145;depart with honeste [honesty]&#146;  (&#145;A letter of Thomas Randolph to the earl of Leicester&#146;, 139). His old friend Throckmorton, visiting the previous year as a fully accredited ambassador, stressed the expense of Randolph's networking in Scotland: &#145;faire promises heretofore have drawen him to spend largely &amp; to execute his charge carefully&#146;, but he had become discouraged &#145;since the fructes of his service worke him soe smalle advantage&#146;  (BL, Cotton MS Caligula B.x, fol. 297<i>r</i>).<br>
<br>In 1563 Randolph was instructed to dangle before Mary the prospect of recognition as Elizabeth's successor. This was to be done in return for dependence on Elizabeth's approval in Mary's marriage. Uncertainty over it damaged Randolph's position, giving him a reputation in Scotland for deceit. Elizabeth used him as a convenient scapegoat for her own dithering. Typical was the queen's instruction to Randolph in October 1565, when she had second thoughts about promising a special embassy, placing the blame with him for the misunderstanding.<br>
<br>Elizabeth's sincerity in offering Robert Dudley, earl of Leicester, as a bridegroom for Mary may have been very doubtful, but Randolph took it seriously and insistently urged him to show more enthusiasm, &#145;not to offend, but in all dutyfull service duly to serve your lordship duringe my life&#146;  (BL, Harley MS 787, fol. 121<i>v</i>). He genuinely wanted a settlement between Mary and Elizabeth, for &#145;to have them all wayes lyve in thys sorte and dowte th'one of th'other, is unprofitable to them bothe&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP Scot.</span>, <i>1563&#150;9</i>, 222). However, after the abortive meeting at Berwick of Randolph and Bedford with Moray and Lethington in November 1564, there was little chance of progress. In March 1565 Elizabeth declined to guarantee concessions even if Mary did marry to her liking and precipitated her objectionable marriage to Henry Stewart, Lord Darnley. This surprised Randolph, who completely failed to anticipate it.<br>
<br>The embitterment of Elizabeth's and Mary's relationship extended to Randolph, who found himself caught in the middle. It was not merely that a welcoming court changed to a suspicious one, but the <i>d&eacute;b&acirc;cle</i> seemed likely to ruin his diplomatic career. Randolph blamed his situation on Mary and Scotland in general, reversing his former liking for them and concluding that the Scottish queen's accession to the English throne would be &#145;as greate a plague unto our nation as cane come owte of Hell&#146;  (&#145;A letter of Thomas Randolph to the earl of Leicester&#146;, 139). He tended to a lurid view of Catholic plots supposedly conducted through David Riccio. Randolph egged on Moray to revolt in summer 1565 and viewed favourably the genesis of the plot to kill Riccio, a deed accomplished after his own withdrawal to Berwick.<br>
<br>The animus was reciprocated. In October 1565 two harquebusiers shot into Randolph's lodgings, and in February 1566 he was expelled over the payment of 3000 crowns sent to Moray, although the money never actually passed through his hands. With some reluctance he finally departed on 2 March after the provost of Edinburgh told Randolph's landlord to throw out his belongings. The anti-Marian satire <span class="italic">Mr Randolph's Fantasy</span> was also blamed on him, though he clearly featured as dedicatee rather than author. The author, Thomas Jenye, was his clerk. Elizabeth was annoyed enough with Mary and (for once) supported rather than repudiated her servant. Randolph still considered himself &#145;unfortunate that ever I sette my foote in this countrie, whear so lyttle succes insuethe of so maynie yeres spent in yt as I have done&#146;, having &#145;gotten graye heares [hairs], not so hable a boddie for travaile as I brought with me, nor farther inriched in substance that yor honour knowethe, of whom I have byne a contynuall begger and shamles craver&#146; (TNA: PRO, SP 52/11/49; SP 52/11/84). The last complaint was partly addressed. On his return to England, Elizabeth started giving Randolph significant grants of royal lands in Kent, for instance at Milton and Badlesmere. This created the local landed base that qualified him for appointment as JP for Kent by 1573. He also became constable of Queenborough Castle in Kent in 1567. He consolidated his position around the Medway estuary by becoming steward of the estates of the bishop of Rochester.<br>
<br>Randolph became master of the posts in May 1567, something apparently promised when he was in Scotland. In February 1566 Bedford had requested Leicester to assist Randolph:<blockquote>great and earnest suit hath been made for the postmastership &hellip; that Sir John Mason could admit a joint patent with him. You know Mr Randolph's service and how that he hath deserved a better thing than this, which if he miss in &hellip; his absence, would discourage any one to serve. (<span class="italic">Pepys MSS</span>, 76)</blockquote>This served to enhance Randolph's diplomatic status&#151;it was as postmaster that he was often introduced to foreigners. The department was also a vital auxiliary to the diplomatic service: though Randolph did most administration by deputy, he was an active regulator. From 1572 he was also (less actively) chamberlain of the exchequer.<h2>
<a name="Russia15681569"></a>Russia, 1568&#150;1569</h2>The postmastership seems to have brought with it at least the honorary status of gentleman of the privy chamber. Randolph was described as a gentleman of the privy chamber when accredited to Ivan IV. Russian specialists undertaking previous negotiations had been handicapped by lack of status; Randolph was supposed to provide this through his position as a courtier, while still being too junior to evade the most arduous journey in the Elizabethan diplomatic world. He landed on the White Sea coast on 23 July 1568, and arrived at Moscow on 15 October, but had to wait four months for an audience. Differences in custom enhanced the impression of offhand treatment.<br>
<br>The two monarchs' expectations were fundamentally incompatible. Ivan was interested in an answer to previous proposals of his for a reciprocal guarantee of asylum, in case Russia became too dangerous for him to remain there, and an offensive alliance, which he sought to direct against Poland. Elizabeth instructed Randolph to &#145;passe these matters with silence&#146;, conceding the simpler point of asylum if he must  (Tolstoy, 43). Randolph's purpose in being there, she concurred with the London merchants, was to secure confirmation and extension of trading privileges for the Russia Company. They actually paid the &pound;1527 cost of the mission. This had become more urgent with the incursion into Russia of non-company interlopers, who tried to defend their position by accusing Randolph of treachery &#145;as yf all the divles in hell were confederate to overthrowe this intercourse&#146;  (Willan, 105). He managed to refute the charge, a dangerous one where so unpredictable a monarch as Ivan the Terrible was concerned.<br>
<br>Randolph fulfilled the Russia Company's requests concerning White Sea, Baltic, and Persian trade. The grant was good enough that its reaffirmation was sought for another twenty years. Ivan, though, was disappointed that Elizabeth would not sign the treaty he sent back with Andrei Grigoryevich Savin on Randolph's return in October 1569. He complained to her that Randolph's &#145;talke was of bowrishnes and affaires of marchaunts &hellip; of our princelie affaires he made them of none effect&#146; and &#145;whosoever was trusted in our affaires, and did deceave us, it were not meete that you should creditt them&#146;  (Tolstoy, 110, 114). Accusations of duplicity echo Randolph's career in Scotland; but it was probably true that he never &#145;did agree &hellip; otherwise then it should please the queen her majestie to like of at his returne home&#146; and &#145;the true meaning &hellip; for want of a good interpretor, was not well understood&#146;  (ibid., 130). Randolph retained enough interest in the east to have considerable &#145;goodes adventured &hellip; into Persia [and] Media&#146; to bequeath in his will  (TNA: PRO, PROB 11/76, sig. 75). He was given supervisory commissions over, and invested in, voyages directed to the north-east and north-west passages.<h2>
<a name="ReturntoScotlandandFrance15701576"></a>Return to Scotland and France, 1570&#150;1576</h2>When news arrived that the Scottish regent Moray had been shot in January 1570, Randolph was sent north again, in the first instance to discover whether he was dead and, if so, to determine what would happen next. He shuttled between Edinburgh and Berwick for a year, and then returned in early 1572 with Sir William Drury, the marshal of Berwick, attempting to effect Elizabeth's incoherent desire for a Scottish settlement favourable to England that nevertheless did not openly reject Mary's sovereign rights.<br>
<br>Archibald Campbell, fifth earl of Argyll, himself no model of political consistency, was later reported as trying to exclude Randolph from negotiations in February 1570&#151;&#145;it wes not for the wele of the cuntrie that sic ane personage as he sould be permittit &hellip; to remayne thairin, to mak tumult and discord amangis the nobilitie of this realme&#146;  (Thomson, 160&#150;61). At the time he certainly told Randolph another story. Melville's autobiography accused Randolph of acting as &#145;a double dealer and sower of discord&#146; and encouraging the recalcitrance of his old acquaintances Maitland and Kirkcaldy in Edinburgh Castle, while claiming to support the regency for James VI  (Melville, 198). At the time Melville had claimed to believe Randolph was &#145;utterly myndit till peacefy our troublit estait, wherby ye may wyp away the wicked oppinion of the vulgaire that beleves the contrary&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP Scot.</span>, <i>1571&#150;4</i>, 163). Frequently cited though Melville's statements have been since his autobiography was discovered, they are best considered as &#145;simply &hellip; paranoid&#146;, aggravated because he blamed Randolph for losing him a land grant  (Pollitt, 17).<br>
<br>Maitland's and Kirkcaldy's attacks on Randolph's bias towards the regency, not to mention Mary's, were so vehement that the king's party believed that Maitland and Kirkcaldy had persuaded Elizabeth to have Drury take over negotiations from him. Kirkcaldy attempted to capture the regent, Matthew Stewart, fourth earl of Lennox, on 4 September 1571, supposedly to try to extricate him from Randolph's malign influence. It went wrong and Lennox was killed. Randolph's disillusionment with the queen's party was more outspoken from this point&#151;&#145;yff they weare hable to sett all the devilles in hell loose to make myscheif they wold not leave on [one] of them untyed&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 52/22/34). He certainly desired a more decisively partisan English policy and was frustrated in its absence. Indeed, &#145;yf I were ons qwyte of this countrie I wyll see Muscovia before that I come here agayne&#146; though he conceded that the Scots were &#145;the honester men&#146; (TNA: PRO, SP 52/18/75; BL, Cotton MS Caligula C.ii, fol. 396<i>v</i>).<br>
<br>Despite his Scottish missions, Randolph attended the parliament of 1572, sitting on committees on Mary (12 May) and on church ceremonies (20 May). In 1571 he married Anne (<i>d</i>. 1572&times;5), daughter of Thomas Walsingham of Chislehurst, Kent, and his wife, Dorothy. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28628/', "Thomas Walsingham (1560/61&#150;1630)")</script>, the literary patron, became his brother-in-law. An alliance to the protestant gentry of north-western Kent was of wider significance because of the Walsingham connection to <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28624/', "Francis Walsingham (c.1532&#150;1590)")</script>. By 1575, and probably as early as 1572, Anne Randolph had died in childbirth and Randolph had married Ursula (<i>d</i>. in or after 1592), daughter of Henry Copinger of Buxhall, Suffolk, who was of Kentish origin. The couple had three sons, Thomas (<i>bap</i>. 1575), Ambrose, and Robert, and three daughters, Frances (1576&#150;1618), Ursula, and Elizabeth. Considerable sense of kinship between Randolph and Francis Walsingham survived this change of wife. Walsingham, inaccurately but deferring to Randolph's slight seniority, called him &#145;uncle&#146;. Randolph probably expected more promotion from this connection than actually occurred. His political and religious views and personal connections developed in parallel&#151;in the 1570s he did join the so-called &#145;ideologues of the left&#146;  (MacCaffrey, <span class="italic">Queen Elizabeth and the Making of Policy</span>, 189). He became a close friend of William Davison and also grew closer to Leicester. In 1578 he appealed to the earl as &#145;th'onlye mayntayner in Englande of honeste and godlye men&#146; on behalf of a preacher imprisoned over &#145;prophesyings&#146;, with an incidental repudiation of &#145;those that beare the name of puritans yf anye be so wicked as to calenge that to themselves&#146;  (BL, Cotton MS Titus B.vii, fol. 18<i>r</i>). Two years later he recommended Leicester support the return to Scotland of his Christ Church contemporary Christopher Goodman. Far more unequivocal than in his attitude to Knox two decades before, he praised Goodman's &#145;greate testimonie of his trewe service in Chryste's churche&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 12/144/34). In 1584 he was involved in the Kentish gentry's petitions against Archbishop Whitgift's anti-puritan measures. His antipathy to Mary also led Randolph, who possibly had had some influence on Buchanan's political ideas in the 1560s, to encourage the Scottish scholar to write <span class="italic">De jure regni apud Scotos</span> (1579) and to arrange for the printing of his play <span class="italic">Baptises</span> with its stress on the tyranny of Herod.<br>
<br>In October 1573 Randolph went to France on a two-month mission to assess Fran&ccedil;ois, duc d'Alen&ccedil;on, as a marital prospect for the queen. According to the French ambassador, Bertrand de Salignac de la Mothe F&eacute;n&eacute;lon, he was only named because Sir Henry Killigrew was ill. F&eacute;n&eacute;lon described him as &#145;entirely depending&#146; on Leicester: the earl had to counteract Randolph's &#145;doubts and fears into which the importance of the matter put him&#146; as it concerned &#145;too closely the persons of very great princes with whom he had never before negotiated anything&#146;  (<span class="italic">Correspondance</span>, 5.427, 431). Randolph's diffidence may have been increased by his earlier abortive foray into royal marital questions. Between March and May 1576 he was back in France, but the mission's aim was superseded by &#145;the peace of Monsieur&#146; (6 May 1576).<h2>
<a name="Scottishrevolutions15781587"></a>Scottish revolutions, 1578&#150;1587</h2>Randolph returned to Scotland in early 1578 for more troubleshooting when, as in Russia in 1568 and Scotland in 1570, &#145;all the divels in Hell were sturringe and in greate rage in this countrye&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP Scot.</span>, <i>1574&#150;80</i>, 283). He concluded that the Anglophile regency of James Douglas, fourth earl of Morton, was unsustainable and his voluntary retirement was wise. Three years later he was sent back to see if Morton's life could be saved&#151;he had the remarkable responsibility of delegated authority to call for invasion of Scotland by Henry Hastings, third earl of Huntingdon, and Henry Carey, first Baron Hunsdon. Walsingham, however, thought Morton doomed and wanted to concentrate on removing the sinister influence of Esm&eacute; Stewart, sieur d'Aubigny, now duke of Lennox. The latter was a point on which Randolph required Walsingham's urging:<blockquote>Yor putting of us in hope that D'Aubigny mighte easely be wonne to be at her majestes devotion was at the first interpreted to have ben <i>ironice</i> spoken by youe, but since yt seemith youe insist uppon yt, I could wish youe were ether otherwies perswadid of the man or at least keapt this opinion to yor self. (BL, Cotton MS Caligula C.vi, fol. 128<i>r</i>)</blockquote>Randolph was, however, more dedicated to his own opinion than two decades before. He insisted that both aspects of English policy&#151;seeking to stir up putatively Anglophile and pro-Morton Scots, and threatening military action&#151;were useless. On the one hand, those &#145;heretofore &hellip; familiar are all nowe as strainge unto me as if I had set fire in their chief city&#146;, a crime of which not even the Marians had yet accused him  (BL, Cotton MS Caligula C.vi, fol. 124<i>r</i>). As for d'Aubigny, Randolph determined &#145;not for all that to leave him desperate except I found you more resolute then I doe and better prepared to maynteyne so great a quarrell as this wil be if it be not looked to&#146;  (BL, Harley MS 6999, fol. 81<i>r</i>); &#145;an honourable peace is to be preferred to the most just war&#146;  (<span class="italic">Hastings MSS</span>, 2.23). Randolph did, however, finally burn his boats with Lennox by denouncing him at length on 20 February 1581 before the Scottish estates as an agent of the international Catholic conspiracy. This may have &#145;helped to seal Morton's fate&#146;, but less so than the plots of Archibald Douglas, earl of Angus, which seemed in Scotland to be more of Randolph's &#145;craftie conspiracies&#146; (<span class="italic">DNB</span>; Moysie, 31).<br>
<br>Hunsdon, with whom Randolph had been at cross purposes in 1572, meanwhile insisted that a military demonstration could work and that if there was no sign from Anglophile Scots this was owing to Randolph's incompetence. Randolph's old friend Bedford reported considerable argument in the privy council:<blockquote>I tould my lords that youe having so much experience of this countrie I sawe no cause why youe should not have as good instruccons as he, but I thinke my lord hath no great goad [good] lykinge of youe, and I could wish he were more circumspecte then he is. Mr Secretarie Walsingham and others held verie harde for youe &hellip; my lord of Leycester is your very good frend &hellip; so that her majestie hath a verie good opinion of all youre dealings there. (TNA: PRO, SP 52/29/40)</blockquote>Hunsdon did make a point of writing to Randolph as &#145;assurid ffrind&#146; to &#145;lovinge friend&#146;  (BL, Lansdowne MS 31, fols. 93<i>r</i>&#150;94<i>r</i>). Probably more sincere was his next denunciation of Randolph in 1587, this time for allegedly extorting the wages of newly appointed posts from them and causing the Berwick&#150;London service to deteriorate.<br>
<br>Though Randolph's opposition to extreme measures was probably objective, he was also personally nervous at the anti-English feeling in Scotland. He asked Walsingham to &#145;vouchesauf me in yor superscriptions the name of an embassadeur to save my throte from cutting yf it be other wyse taken&#146;, and sent him some testamentary directions  (TNA: PRO, SP 52/29/13). Shots through his window, as in 1566, did finally cause him to retire to Berwick on 28 March 1581.<br>
<br>Despite Randolph's failure in 1581, he was entrusted with the organization of the subsequent Anglo-Scottish border meeting. He missed Lennox's fall in 1582, though the prospect made him actually volunteer to return to Scotland, lest others &#145;repe the glorie of that for which I have adventured my bodie and spent of my owne, almoste to extreme beggerrie&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 52/30/28). In 1586 Randolph succeeded in forging a stronger amity and even convinced James finally to sign an alliance with Elizabeth with a last-minute cut in the financial offer. Memories of 1581 had made Randolph's welcome doubtful: Elizabeth, however, took pains to assure James that he &#145;in your childesche yeres sought all menes of your preservation&#146; and &#145;hathe no other scope than to kipe us frendes&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters of Queen Elizabeth and King James VI</span>, 28). James concurred, though after his mother's execution the following year, when there was an abortive rumour that Randolph would be sent back to excuse it, the young king sneered at &#145;dotinge Randalle&#146;  (<span class="italic">Extracts &hellip; Courcelles</span>, 41).<br>
<br>Randolph then made &#145;speede &hellip; to be owte of thys countrye&#146;, even though this &#145;haste &hellip; agayne distempered my boddie&#146;  (BL, Cotton MS Caligula C.ix, fol. 397<i>r</i>). Walsingham probably helped him back into parliament as MP for Maidstone, Kent, in 1584, 1586, and 1589. He was on the parliamentary committee on Mary (4 November 1586), and set off with Walsingham to her trial at Fotheringhay Castle, Northamptonshire, &#145;bycause of the knowledge I have of that woman's formar dealing agaynste her majestie&#146; but was forced to &#145;retorne home &hellip; so miserablye I was tormented with the collicke&#146; (TNA: PRO, SP 12/194/16; SP 12/194/39). It is likely that a knighthood was finally in the offing. Davison's disgrace after Mary's execution, however, put paid to any chance of such reward for Randolph, his close friend and a notorious anti-Marian.<h2>
<a name="Deathandassessment"></a>Death and assessment</h2>Randolph's will expressed &#145;assured hope and confidence&#146; in salvation, and also showed that he had no more cause to complain of poverty. Besides leases of lands for his wife and sons, he left &pound;500 of &#145;plate, jewells, housholde stuffe, and readie mony&#146; to his wife, portions of &pound;500 for each of his three daughters once eighteen, and speculative trading investments for Ambrose Randolph, which he considered might come to exceed &pound;500 in value. Randolph was supposedly &#145;well in health&#146; when he made this will on 1 April 1589; when he added a codicil requiring his eldest son to guarantee his mother's jointure on 15 May 1590 he was probably less so, and on 8 June he died at his London house in St Peter's Hill. On 6 July he was buried in the local church, St Peter Paul's Wharf&#151;his monument was doubtless, as requested, &#145;without great charge, voide of superstition&#146; but perished in 1666  (TNA: PRO, PROB 11/76, sig. 75). Randolph asked Walsingham, William Brooke, tenth Lord Cobham, and Sir Walter Mildmay to acquire his heir's wardship for his widow. His relationship with the Kentish magnate Cobham was equivocal. He sent Walsingham nervous secret denunciations of Cobham's relatives&#151;though not him&#151;for corruption, but in 1591 Ursula Randolph did, as envisaged, turn to the only survivor of &#145;those honorable personnes my husband did so specially affect&#146;  (BL, Lansdowne MS 67, fol. 82<i>r</i>).<br>
<br>Randolph's broad and distinguished range of connections in both England and Scotland was remarkable. Though some Scottish friendships&#151;such as with Maitland and Kirkcaldy&#151;did not endure, he participated significantly in bringing Scottish and English political classes into an unprecedented degree of sympathy, though his efforts to develop an active Anglophile faction contributed only slightly to the Marian defeats of 1567, 1573, and 1582, in each case after his own departure.<br>
<br>Randolph was &#145;one of the first in England whom we can possibly identify as a career diplomat&#146;, spending over ten years abroad and, even at home, being frequently called upon to receive distinguished foreigners  (Bell, &#145;Elizabethan diplomacy&#146;, 268). He showed that the profession could be worthwhile financially, though commercial investment seems to have supplemented direct rewards. He was, according to Thomas Morgan, &#145;both dogged and craftye&#146;. Morgan attributed to James the remark &#145;that he never came thither [to Scotland] to do good, so as I am gladde that he knoweth Randolphe&#146;  (Murdin, 500, 505). The claims of the scarcely more reliable Melville have received more attention than they deserve. Inconsistencies in Randolph's negotiations generally emanated from Elizabeth: his own instinct was to be a partisan, not a duplicitous middleman.<br>
