<span class="headword">Williams,  David</span>  (1898&#150;1984), <span class="occ">geologist</span>, was born on 12 October 1898 at 74 David Street, Toxteth, Liverpool. He and his twin brother, <a href="#cosubject_56927">Howel (1898&#150;1974) [<i>see below</i>]</a>, were among the youngest of the eight children of William Williams (1856&#150;1934) and his wife, Laura, formerly Davies (1860&#150;1931), originally from the vicinity of Betws-y-coed, Caernarvonshire. They had moved to Liverpool about 1887 so that William Williams could secure a better livelihood as a timber merchant.<br>
<br>The Williams twins were educated almost entirely in Liverpool, first at Holt secondary school and then at Liverpool University. Their education was interrupted by the First World War. After a period of service with the Lancashire Fusiliers, David graduated in civil engineering in 1921 and geology in 1922, going on to gain an MSc in 1923; in 1925 he gained his PhD for studies on the Lower Palaeozoic volcanic rocks between Nant Peris and Nant Ffrancon, close to the family's roots at Betws-y-coed. His career as a professional geologist began in earnest in 1926 in Northern Rhodesia where he was employed as a prospector exploring the geological and geophysical aspects of the industrially important copperbelt. Two years later he moved to Spain. His years there were important both professionally and personally: he became chief mining geologist for Rio Tinto mines and met, and in 1929 married, Dorothy Welland Shepard (1904&#150;1991). Their daughters, Branwen and Nona, were born during his years in Spain and his classic paper on the geology of the Rio Tinto mines (which won him the Consolidated Gold Fields gold medal of the Institution of Mining and Metallurgy in 1934) was also conceived at this time.<br>
<br>Following his doctoral studies, Williams had spent some months at Imperial College, London. In 1932 he was invited to return there by P. G. H. Boswell who, when teaching at Liverpool University in the 1920s, had been a seminal influence on the young geologist. Thus began a distinguished academic career in which Williams was successively: lecturer, reader, and professor of mining geology; head of the department of geology (from 1951 to 1964); and dean of the Royal School of Mines (from 1952 to 1959). Williams's main achievements related to his university department rather than to personal research. While he in no way neglected geology as a pure science, under his direction the study of mining geology prospered at Imperial College and, as the department grew, geophysics, applied geochemistry, engineering geology, and other aspects of applied geology were incorporated.<br>
<br>Williams's deep interest in applied geology is further evidenced by the fact that he is said to have spent his long hours of fire-watching duty during the Second World War arranging and cataloguing the Royal School of Mines' enormous collection of rock and mineral specimens of economic importance. During the expansion of Imperial College in the 1960s the collection was rehoused; it has subsequently been renamed the David Williams Museum of Economic Geology, as a visible reminder of his contribution to geology. He was also ever-active professionally outside the college. A stalwart of the Geological Society of London (elected a fellow in 1927) he was a member of its council from 1938 to 1953, honorary secretary from 1942 to 1951, twice vice-president (1951&#150;3; 1964&#150;5), and finally foreign secretary from 1970 to 1973. He was also awarded the society's Lyell medal in 1959.<br>
<br>Williams was a long-time member of the council of the Institution of Mining and Metallurgy (1948&#150;70), serving as vice-president from 1954 to 1957 and president in 1960&#150;61. He was subsequently created an honorary fellow of the institution in 1969. Further honours included election as president of the Geologists' Association in its centenary year, 1958&#150;60, and by 1968 he was a fellow of Imperial College of Science and Technology. His publications included part of a Geologists' Association guide on the geology of Snowdonia (1959 and later edns) and <span class="italic">Minerals and Mineral Deposits</span> (1948, co-authored with W. R. Jones) as well as a number of papers in geological and mining journals.<br>
<br>Williams retired from his academic post in 1966 and enjoyed a long retirement, maintaining contact with his old department until his death. He had lived at Epsom since his return from Spain and died at Epsom District Hospital on 8 May 1984. He was cremated shortly afterwards at Ashtead crematorium where his ashes lie. A very warm personality full of lively Welsh <i>hwyl</i>, he brought an infectious enthusiasm to the teaching of geology and is remembered chiefly for his contribution to education in the field of applied geology, notably in mining.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_56927"></a><span class="headword">Howel Williams</span>  (1898&#150;1979), <span class="occ">geologist</span>, graduated from Liverpool with a first-class BA degree in geography (1917) followed by an MA in 1923. Like his brother, and again owing to the intercedence of Boswell, he became interested in geology, taking his MSc in 1924 and his DSc in 1928 in that subject. In 1923&#150;6 his geological studies were furthered as an 1851 Exhibition scholar at Imperial College, London, where he worked on a geological study of Snowdon, mainly under the supervision of W. W. Watts. The volcanic rocks encountered in this area fired his interest in the subject and he was soon able to take up a Commonwealth fellowship to study volcanic rocks under A. C. Lawson at the University of California at Berkeley (1926&#150;9). Except for a brief return as a demonstrator at the Royal School of Mines (1929&#150;30), the rest of his career was based in the United States.<br>
<br>At first an associate professor, by 1937 Williams was a full professor of geology at the University of California and between 1945 and 1949 he was chairman of the department of geology there. During these important post-war years he played a crucial role in establishing the department as one of the nation's foremost centres of geological learning. In 1950 he was elected to the National Academy of Sciences. After his retirement much of his work was done at the University of Oregon. Among his research interests was the volcanic geology of the Sierra Nevada and the Cascade range (particularly Crater Lake), but Hawaii, Tahiti, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, and the Gal&aacute;pagos Islands also all received his attention. A prolific author, to his credit are many important books on volcanic geology as well as on other aspects of geology.<br>
<br>Williams became a naturalized American citizen and was twice married in that country, the first time in 1930 to Roberdeau Hoffman whom he divorced, and later to Ruth Goldstone. He outlived his second wife and no children were born of either marriage. He died in California in 1979.<br>
<br>The Williams twins were always full of fun and as children and young men liked nothing better than trying to mislead people as to which of them was which. They also shared other qualities, notably as geologists who had an ability to impart knowledge and inspire others.<br>
