<span class="headword">Worthington,  William</span>  (1723&#150;1800), <span class="occ">brewer</span>, was born at Orton on the Hill, Leicestershire, the fourth child of William Worthington (1687&#150;1742), yeoman farmer, and his wife, Elizabeth. In 1744, on reaching his majority, Worthington moved to Burton upon Trent to work as a cooper in Joseph Smith's small brewery situated on the west side of the High Street. Burton was already famous as a brewing centre, noted for the exceptional qualities of its water which produced a fine-quality, strong ale able to withstand long and arduous journeys. By the 1750s, a modest but growing export trade with the Baltic States, via the Trent Navigation and Hull, was well established.<br>
<br>It was this lucrative, but risky export trade which attracted Worthington to brewing, and in 1760, having raised a mortgage of &pound;320, he purchased the brewery from Smith's successor, Richard Commings. The following year he extended the property, adding a tunhouse and second brewhouse. In 1760 he also married a widow, Ann Tarratt; they had two sons. Worthington's wife is thought to have provided the finance for his first export of ale to the Baltic and, eighteen months later, when nothing further had been heard of the shipment, to buy out his partner's share in the venture. Her confidence was rewarded: the proceeds were to exceed all expectations and establish the brewery, later to become one of the best-known of all British breweries, on a sound footing.<br>
<br>The few surviving letter-books reveal the difficult and speculative nature of the export trade. Yet Worthington's business flourished; it is difficult to trace its growth with accuracy, but by the 1780s the brewery probably had an annual output approaching 1500 barrels, much on a par with that of Worthington's two great rivals, Benjamin Wilson and Michael Bass  (Owen, <span class="italic">Industry in Burton</span>, 56). Like them, William was as much merchant as brewer. While brewing formed the heart of his enterprise, consignments of ale, sent mainly to Danzig and St Petersburg, were frequently bartered for iron bars, staves, and wood. Indeed, by the 1780s, Worthington with his younger son, Thomas, was listed among Burton's leading timber merchants.<br>
<br>Worthington's two sons, William (1764&#150;1825) and Thomas (1766&#150;1805), followed him into the business, their marriage in 1791 to the two daughters of Henry Evans, a wealthy Burton brewer, greatly enhancing the prospects of the brewery. The previous year Evans had purchased on behalf of his daughters the brewery built and worked by John Walker Wilson, situated opposite Worthington's business. On their marriage, the brewery passed into Worthington hands. By the time of Worthington's death in 1800, Worthington &amp; Co. ranked among the biggest provincial breweries; eighty years later, Alfred Barnard noted that it was the &#145;largest pale ale brewery in the hands of a single family&#146;  (Barnard, 1.411). Besides the brewery, Worthington left his sons and widow substantial property in Burton, farms at Hartshorne and Gresley, and a considerable fortune.<br>
