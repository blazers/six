<span class="headword">Brand,  James</span>  (1831&#150;1909), <span class="occ">public works contractor</span>, was born on 20 September 1831 in Montrose, Forfarshire, the son of Charles Brand (<i>d</i>. 1885), mason and contractor, from a Kincardine family, and his wife, Margaret Falconer. He had at least one brother. After leaving school in Montrose he was apprenticed for three years to his uncle William Brand, who was in charge of enlarging Ardross Castle, overlooking the Firth of Cromarty, for Alexander Matheson the opium trader. In 1851 he began to work for his father as clerk of works for the building of the Episcopal church at Arbroath. Charles Brand was part of a consortium which successfully tendered for the extension of the Aberdeen Railway to Inverness, and James Brand worked with him on the sections of the line for which he was responsible. He became manager of the firm in 1853. His father, as part of another consortium, contracted for sections of the Great North of Scotland Railway (GNSR), and was allocated the section between Elgin and Keith. Brand worked there as contract agent in 1856&#150;8, and saw the completion of the route from Aberdeen to Inverness; he was taken into partnership with his father in 1859, forming the company Charles Brand &amp; Son. In 1863 Brand married Jane, daughter of William Gordon, procurator fiscal in Banffshire, and shortly after this was received into the Roman Catholic church. The couple had five sons, two of whom became Jesuit priests, and three daughters, two of whom became nuns.<br>
<br>During the 1860s the firm was active in railway construction in north and north-east Scotland. It built the line from Keith to Dufftown for the GNSR, opened in 1862, and the section of the highland railway between Bonar Bridge and Golspie. In the late 1860s it expanded into lowland Scotland and then undertook a series of contracts on the Glasgow tramways from 1870, the first to be tendered by Glasgow corporation. Work began in 1878 on an important contract building Grangemouth docks, and the firm went on to build docks in Dumbarton, 1880&#150;84, and Donegal quay in Belfast, 1882&#150;5.<br>
<br>Charles Brand retired in 1882, and James Brand became sole partner. In that year the firm began work on the eastern section of the Glasgow City and District Railway, the first underground line to be built in Glasgow. It took four years to build because of the technical difficulties of tunnelling underneath buildings in the city centre, often through waterlogged sand, and also the problem of blasting through boulder clay: only 7 yards of tunnel a month were completed while tunnelling under Buchanan Street. This work led to contracts for the Glasgow District subway, to build sections under the River Clyde: this used cable traction, the same system as the San Francisco cable cars, powered by stationary steam engines above ground. Tunnelling began in 1891 and the subway opened in December 1896, only to close again on the first day after an accident. Brand also helped to build the Glasgow Central Railway for the Caledonian Railway: in order to excavate the busy streets in the centre of Glasgow nearby buildings had to be underpinned, and there were problems with water from the River Clyde seeping into the workings. This line opened in 1895. Using expertise gained in Glasgow, the firm was to carry out many contracts for the London underground after the First World War.<br>
<br>A new partnership was formed in 1903, including Brand's third son, Harry, and after this Brand began to retire from the business. He had been a member of Glasgow parish council since 1875 and chairman of the merged Glasgow parish in 1898&#150;1901. As chairman of the hospitals committee he succeeded in getting the council to build a large new general hospital. In 1904 he sat on the Glasgow municipal commission on the housing of the poor. Brand was also active in the Catholic community of Glasgow, serving on the Scottish Catholic schools committee, and was chairman of the Caledonian Catholic Association. He died on 15 January 1909 in Bournemouth, survived by his wife.<br>
