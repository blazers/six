<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Hay family</span>  (<em>per. </em><em>c.</em>1295&#150;<em>c.</em>1460), <span class="occ">nobility</span>, originated in the seigneurie of La Haye-Hue, by Soulles, south of St Lo in Normandy. It seems certain that the Hays came to Scotland through their connection with Ranulf de Soules, an Anglo-Norman in the service of David I, since one of the earliest recorded Hays in Scotland, William de la Hay, was Soules's nephew. From being knights in the service of Soules, the family became established in central and north-east Scotland, eventually rising sufficiently to hold the important household office of constable of Scotland, formerly the possession of the Comyns. The Hay family had held the barony of Erroll in the sheriffdom of Perth, by knight service, since the early years of William the Lion's reign, but the foundations of their rise to national prominence were laid by <a name="cosubject_12740"></a><span class="headword">Sir Gilbert Hay of Erroll</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1333)<span class="occ"></span>, who had succeeded his father by June 1306 and received remittance from Edward I (to whom he had sworn fealty at Aberdeen on 16 July 1296) for the relief due for his lands, severely ravaged during the wars of independence. However, Hay joined the cause of Robert Bruce in March 1306, and in consequence Aymer de Valence, earl of Pembroke, received orders from Edward I to burn and destroy Hay's lands, presumably in Perthshire. Nevertheless Hay continued to serve Robert I loyally and consistently, for which he received a charter of the lands of Slains in Aberdeenshire, together with the office of constable of Scotland, positive evidence for his rise in political importance.<br>
<br>Hay is described as constable in a letter from the nobles of Scotland to Philippe IV of France, dated 16 March 1309, although his tenure of the office was clearly provisional, as it was granted to David, earl of Strathbogie, in 1312. The latter's disgrace in 1314 led to the return and confirmation of the office to the Hays, but now in heredity, being given in a charter by Robert I, dated at Cambuskenneth on 12 November 1314, to Gilbert Hay and his heirs. The duties of the constable included presiding over the judicial court of the household and organizing the king's bodyguard and security wherever he happened to be residing, in addition to various ceremonial duties, some of which were apparently shared with the marischal. A safe conduct was issued to Hay by Edward II on 18 September 1314 as one of the Scottish ambassadors to go to England, and he was a signatory to the letter to Pope John XXII drawn up at Arbroath on 6 April 1320. He was named as one of the conservators of the truce in 1323, and he died in April 1333.<br>
<br>Nicolas Hay was the eldest son of Sir Gilbert, but he appears to have predeceased his father, and may have been the Hay, mistakenly named William, said by Hector Boece to have fallen at the battle of Dupplin in 1332. Sir David Hay of Erroll, who witnessed a charter by David II on 17 June 1341, and who may have been Nicolas's son, was killed at the battle of Nevilles Cross on 17 October 1346.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_54229"></a><span class="headword">Sir Thomas Hay of Erroll</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1406)<span class="occ"></span> was the son of Sir David and his first wife, the daughter and heir of Sir John Keith of Innerpeffer. As constable of Scotland, Hay was one of the commissioners appointed to treat with the English for the release of David II in 1353, and was proposed as a hostage for the king's ransom in 1357. He does not appear to have served as such, possibly because of his official duties as constable. However, his primary loyalty was to the Stewarts rather than to the king, as is indicated by the fact that although he does not appear to have attended at court under David II, he was sufficiently in favour with the Stewarts to secure a royal bride, for he married Elizabeth, the third daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/23713/', "Robert II")</script> and his first wife, Elizabeth Mure. He was present at the coronation of Robert II at Scone on 26 March 1371, where, as constable, he received the oaths of homage and fealty given to the king. On 4 April 1373 he swore to the maintenance of the <span class="roman">Act of Settlement</span> entailing the crown on Robert II's male heirs, and his lands of Slains were erected into a free barony by royal charter dated at Dundee on 5 January 1377. But thereafter he seldom appears in official records until his death in July 1406.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_54230"></a><span class="headword">Sir William Hay of Erroll</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1436)<span class="occ"></span>, who succeeded his father, had on 19 March 1393 obtained an undertaking from Robert III not to ratify or approve any alienations made by his father, Thomas, without either William's consent or that of the king's council, indicating some tension within the family. Hay was one of the commissioners appointed to treat with the English for the release of James I in 1423, and was knighted at the coronation of the king in 1424, his son Gilbert (<i>d</i>. 1436) having been sent to England as a hostage for James I's ransom, serving thus until 1427. The king's reliance on Hay as one of his trusted northern councillors is indicated by his inclusion in James I's expedition to the north in 1428, and he followed the king's instructions to coerce a reluctant Coupar Angus Abbey, of which he was patron, into surrendering the church of Erroll near Perth, so that it might be added to the king's endowment of Perth Charterhouse. (In 1446 Hay's grandson, subsequently the first earl of Erroll, attempted to recover his rights in the church, claiming that the grant had been made under duress and through fear of the king.) In 1430 Hay, possibly because he held the office of constable rather than because he had any landed interest in the borders, was appointed one of the wardens of the marches. He was married to Margaret, daughter of Sir Patrick Gray, and he died in 1436, being succeeded by his grandson.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_54231"></a><span class="headword">William Hay</span>, first earl of Erroll  (<em>d.</em> 1462)<span class="occ"></span>, was the son of Gilbert Hay, who died in the same year as his father, and Alicia, daughter of Sir William Hay of Yester. In the June parliament of 1452 William Hay was raised from the peerage rank of lord of parliament, which he had held in official records at least since 1450, to the earldom of Erroll, resigning all his lands into the king's hands to be erected into the lordship of Erroll and regality of Slains, for which he received royal charters on 31 July 1452. Although the title derived from his estates, Hay's elevation, like that of William Keith, created Earl Marischal in 1458, followed from his hereditary office, reflecting the family's high status as constables of Scotland. It also contributed towards replenishing the then depleted ranks of the higher nobility with loyal supporters of the king, without requiring much expenditure of crown lands or revenue. James II may also have been moved by a desire to secure Hay's allegiance, undermining any ties of kinship the new earl may have had with the Black Douglases, to whom Hay was related through his marriage, before 17 March 1450, to Beatrix Douglas. She was the sister of the eighth earl of Douglas, whom James slew in 1452. The creation of the earldom of Erroll certainly survived the Douglas crisis and the king's act of revocation in 1455. Erroll is mentioned in a charter of 15 November 1461, but was dead by October 1462.<br>
