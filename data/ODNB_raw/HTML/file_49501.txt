<span class="headword">Rhind,  David</span>  (1808&#150;1883), <span class="occ">architect</span>, was born in the parish of St Giles, Edinburgh, on 11 January 1808, the son of John Rhind, writer (lawyer), cashier to the Edinburgh Friendly Insurance Company of Scotland, and his wife, Marion Anderson. On his father's death in 1826 his brother succeeded as cashier of the company, and a family trust was established to look after the elder Rhind's property interests in Leith. Rhind was thus embedded into the mercantile milieu of Edinburgh and Leith, and a reasonable inheritance and financial security (as well as a propensity to litigation) may explain the curious lack of urgency in his architectural output. Some eighty projects divided equally between banks, public buildings and churches, and residential projects were evenly spread throughout an almost fifty-year career&#151;an average of under two known projects per year. Other Rhind projects probably remain unidentified, for during his tenure as Commercial Bank architect, that bank constructed some fifty-six branches; and drawings for several unidentified pleasant houses in Rhind's characteristic hand are in the Rowand Anderson Collection, University of Edinburgh.<br>
<br>Although classified as an &#145;outsider&#146;  (Gow), Rhind was at the heart of the establishment between 1835 and 1860. He was architect to the Commercial Bank, to the county prison board of Edinburgh, and to the established Church of Scotland. He was a fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh (1836), a founder member of the Institute of the Architects of Scotland in 1840, fellow (1849), convenor of the premises committee and occasional chairman of the Architectural Institute of Scotland (to which he gave a paper on the designer of George Heriot's Hospital, displaying considerable scholarship and research), and mason. His particular interest in sculpture&#151;exemplified in the outsize Miller mausoleum (1848), Craigentinny, Edinburgh, with sculptured panels by Alfred Gatley&#151;was the inspiration for his presidential address to the Royal Scottish Society of Arts in 1855, on the &#145;practical improvement of all that is requisite for proper construction of our buildings, and such information on art and art-manufacture as is required by the workman for the tasteful execution of his work&#146;  (<span class="italic">Building Chronicle</span>, 1 Jan 1855, 129). Yet by comparison with his near contemporary William Playfair, his few drawings (generally characterized by pale blue roofs, cream walls, orange timberwork, and brown floor plans) display scant interest in construction and detail.<br>
<br>Rhind may have trained with A. C. Pugin in London in the 1820s (when he became firm friends with Charles Barry) and then with George Smith, a former clerk of William Burn, in Edinburgh. That he had visited Italy was emphasized in the strong cosmopolitanism of his principal designs. He was established by 1834 as architect at his mother's address of 6 Forres Street, Edinburgh, but is thought already to have completed two plain late classical Commercial Bank projects: Wick (1829) and Falkirk (1830). In 1834 he designed the plinth for John Greenshields's statue of Sir Walter Scott in George Square, Glasgow. The bulk of his designs were for banks or sheriff courts. Many of the former were routinely Italianate (although some&#151;Banff and Perth&#151;were grand-manner <i>palazzi</i>), and his later baronial sheriff courts lacked the vigorous conviction of his contemporaries. His feuing plans (for Merchiston and Pollok, for example) were unremarkable. There was a distinct tailing-off after 1860. Rhind had married Emily Shoubridge on 16 September 1840, and, after her premature death, Mary Jane Sackville Pearson on 24 April 1845. Five of his children predeceased him (two of them in 1856).<br>
<br>Yet between 1843 and 1856 Rhind&#151;or perhaps his award-winning assistants John Alexander Hamilton (who also assisted William Playfair with his later works), Robert Morham, and Hippolyte Blanc&#151;completed a small number of truly monumental buildings that demonstrate grandeur, flamboyance, and romanticism in a variety of architectural languages. In 1843 he won a competition for the Commercial Bank in George Street, Edinburgh, for which he produced an extraordinarily powerful colour perspective. This Roman classical, Playfair-influenced bank became the outstanding building of George Street, and its success led the trustees of Daniel Stewart's to appoint him for their new hospital/school in 1848. Requesting designs in three styles, they selected what they (and he) called Elizabethan but which was, rather, a flamboyant Scottish Jacobean&#151;a riot of George Heriot's Hospital-style detailing. That this may have been Rhind's own preference is indicated by its choice for his unsuccessful entry for the architectural competition for a design for the Houses of Parliament.<br>
<br>Rhind's design for the Commercial Bank's other principal office, in Gordon Street, Glasgow (1854), took the dignified form of a massively detailed, rusticated Renaissance <i>palazzo</i> like a contemporary London club. Through most of the 1850s he was engaged on the troubled refacing of the Life Association headquarters in Princes Street, Edinburgh. It became the most sumptuous three-dimensional fa&ccedil;ade on the street, a Venetian <i>palazzo</i> coruscating with carvings and capped by finials. By contrast, an intriguingly personal romantic reinvention of Scottish historic architecture informed his mid-career houses such as Knockdolian, Ayrshire (<i>c</i>.1840), Carlowrie, Linlithgowshire (1851), and probably the nearby, contemporary Champfleurie (attributed to Rhind).<br>
<br>Rhind's office was reputed to have been a good one to train in, but his architecture left the <span class="italic">Builder</span> obituarist puzzled, as never being in &#145;the true spirit&#146; of Gothic. The latter concluded, rather unfairly, that Rhind had been an early Victorian classicist at heart, both unable to adapt and more interested in &#145;fa&ccedil;ade effects&#146; than in the intricacies of interior planning. Yet the powerful theatricality of his principal monuments was judged by Lord Cockburn a principal adornment of mid-nineteenth-century Edinburgh. Rhind died at 12 Selwood Terrace, Onslow Gardens, London, on 4 April 1883, and was buried in the combined family tomb, which he had designed in 1834, in St Cuthbert's Church, Edinburgh; he was survived by his second wife.<br>
