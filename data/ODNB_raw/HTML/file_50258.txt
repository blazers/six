<span class="headword">Monte,  Piero  da</span> <span class="st"> [Pietro  del Monte]</span>  (1400<span class="mult">x</span>04&#150;1457), <span class="occ">scholar and papal diplomat</span>, was born in Venice, where his father, Nicol&ograve; da Monte, was a citizen of substance. He pursued humanistic studies under Guarino da Verona and then law in Padua, under the famous jurists Prosdocimo de Conti and Giovan Francesco di Capodalista. His writings as a young man (speeches and letters survive) show all the conventional interests of early fifteenth-century humanists; he retained throughout his career a concern with such studies, for instance collecting books and arranging for copying. He corresponded later with Poggio Bracciolini, Ambrogio Traversari, Pietro Barbo, and Pier Candido Decembrio, among others. On 15 July 1433 he graduated as doctor of both civil and canon law.<br>
<br>Da Monte then attended the Council of Basel as ambassador for Venice, where his defence of Pope Eugenius IV, <span class="italic">De summi pontificis, generalis concilii et imperialis majestatis origine et potestate</span>, a work much influenced by Cardinal Francesco Zabarella, won him considerable support from the Venetians round the pope. In it, as in all his polemics, he strongly supported a high doctrine of papal power, stressing in particular the papacy as a monarchy. He was thus made (21 April 1435) a protonotary apostolic and given the collectorship (of papal revenues) in England, which he exercised in person between 1435 and 1440. Da Monte's major task was not to collect money but to keep the English from siding with the Council of Basel, as it became increasingly hostile to the pope. Speeches by him on the subject remain. His main letter collection gives an incomparable picture of his work and of the ecclesiastical politics of the country, though he probably exaggerated his own importance to his employers. He commented several times on the country's wealth, and presented an admiring picture of the young Henry VI, describing him as pious, patient, continent, and hostile to obscenity, in all more like a monk than a secular prince; his second-hand account of the death in 1437 of James I, king of Scots, was much less flattering, the dead ruler being stigmatized as a cruel tyrant. He was inclined to report what the Roman curia wanted to hear, and this may have coloured his description of a council meeting in May 1438 at which a delegation from the Council of Basel was rebuked by Archbishop Chichele, Humphrey of Gloucester, and others, and also his picture of England as so devoted to the papacy that, as Chichele put it, a choir of angels would be unable to separate the realm from the Roman obedience.<br>
<br>But da Monte was clear-sighted and truthful when he spelt out for Eugenius IV the king's overriding control of ecclesiastical appointments, and recommended that the pope accept the government's appointments. And he passed on English criticism of the curia's provision of unworthy nominees to benefices, and its misuse of dispensations to permit the holding of livings in plurality. He noted the hatred of the English for Italians in 1439, and later reported on such matters as the divisions among the monks of Westminster as they elected a new abbot, and a quarrel over precedence between the archbishops of Canterbury and York. Later he was accused of having pocketed some of the collected money, but this was almost certainly an invention of his enemies, of whom he had several, in Rome and England. He dedicated to Humphrey, duke of Gloucester, <span class="italic">De virtutum et vitiorum inter se differentia</span>  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Auct. F.5.26 is a copy), and introduced the duke to Italian scholars, including Tito Livio dei Frulovisi and Antonio Beccaria, whom Humphrey employed. Beccaria was da Monte's sub-collector and dedicated to him a translation of Plutarch's life of Pelopidas.<br>
<br>On his return to Rome da Monte was made nuncio with some legatine powers for France (1442&#150;4) and bishop of Brescia in 1442. His task in France was to use his experience to work for Anglo-French peace and to obtain the abrogation, in return for a concordat, of the <span class="roman">Pragmatic Sanction of Bourges</span> (1438)&#151;legislation embodying &#145;the Gallican liberties&#146;, acceptance of certain reforms of Basel, and, in particular, a denial to the pope of a major part of his claims to appoint to benefices in France. Da Monte considered himself on good terms with Charles VII and discussed literature with him; he is also recorded presiding at the betrothal (on 24 May 1444, at Tours) of Margaret of Anjou to Henry VI. But, though an assembly of churchmen at Bourges in the summer of 1444 seemed favourable to the pope's revision of the concordat, the French government raised its demands and the plan failed. Da Monte returned to continue his career in Italy. He dedicated to Pope Nicholas V (<i>r</i>. 1447&#150;55) his next important polemic, <span class="italic">Contra impugnantes sedis apostolicae auctoritatem</span>. Between May 1451 and April 1453, while keeping Brescia, he was governor of Perugia, returning afterwards to Rome, where Calixtus III (<i>r</i>. 1455&#150;8) made him a referendary. Between 1451 and 1453 he produced his most famous work, <span class="italic">Repertorium utriusque iuris</span>, also known as <span class="italic">Brixiense</span>, which exists in many manuscripts and printed editions before 1500. A legal dictionary or encyclopaedia, it contains interesting references to England and English practice. Da Monte was hoping to be promoted cardinal, but may have missed this because of rivalries in the curia. He died in Rome on 12 January 1457 and was buried there in the church of Santa Maria Maggiore.<br>
