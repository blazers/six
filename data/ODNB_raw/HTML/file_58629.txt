<span class="headword">McMordie <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Gray]</span>,  Julia</span>  (1860&#150;1942), <span class="occ">politician and philanthropist</span>, was born on 30 March 1860 at Cliff Terrace, Hartlepool, co. Durham, the fifth daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/47529/', "Sir William Gray (1823&#150;1898)")</script>, shipbuilder and shipowner, and his wife, Dorothy (<i>d</i>. 1906), daughter of Captain John Hall RN. A Presbyterian, she was educated at Chislehurst, Kent, but moved to Belfast following her marriage to Robert James McMordie (1849&#150;1914) on 21 May 1886. He was a solicitor in Belfast and also served as Unionist MP for East Belfast and as lord mayor of Belfast from 1910 until his death in 1914. On 23 January 1914, two months before his death, the McMordies were awarded the freedom of the city of Belfast in recognition of their public service. Their children, John Andrew and Elsie Gray, were born on 8 July 1887 and 30 November 1888 respectively.<br>
<br>After her husband's death McMordie's interest in philanthropy and politics continued. She was involved with an array of local organizations in Belfast, including the Samaritan Hospital, the Ulster Hospital for Women and Children, the Girls' Help Society, the Presbyterian Women's and Girls' Union, the Young Women's Christian Association, and the Cripples' Institute. During the First World War she was president of the St John's Women's Voluntary Aid Detachment for Belfast. She was also an active member of the Ulster Women's Unionist Council, serving as an executive committee member and a vice-chairman from 1911 to 1919 and as vice-president from 1919 to 1942.<br>
<br>On 2 September 1918 McMordie became the first female councillor on Belfast corporation, and she served as an alderman from 1920 to 1930. She summed up her interest in municipal affairs in her 1926 electoral manifesto: &#145;I have tried to do all I could for the best interests of the Ratepayers &hellip; I am very much interested in the Health and well being of the Citizens, more especially of the children, &hellip; I love the work&#146;  (PRONI, D.1327/16/1/5).<br>
<br>In 1921 McMordie was one of two women elected to the first parliament of Northern Ireland, standing as a Unionist candidate in South Belfast. Although McMordie had not supported the suffrage movement, much of her parliamentary debate focused on issues relating to women and children. In her maiden speech of 5 April 1922, for instance, she called for an increase in the number of women police officers. She was also anxious to improve educational provisions in Northern Ireland&#151;stressing the importance of employing specially trained teachers for disabled children and of having female school inspectors. Although a staunch unionist and a capable orator, she did not stand for re-election in 1925.<br>
<br>In 1935 McMordie left Belfast, taking up residence in East Cliff, Budleigh Salterton, Devon, in order to be near her family. Various accolades were bestowed on McMordie throughout her life. In 1919 she was appointed CBE and in 1928 she was appointed high sheriff of Belfast, the first woman in Ireland to hold this position. She was a lady of grace of the order of St John of Jerusalem, and was one of the first three women in Ireland to be appointed to the magistracy. In 1936 she was given the honorary degree of LLD from the Queen's University of Belfast.<br>
<br>McMordie died at her daughter's home in King's Cliffe, Oundle, Northamptonshire, on 12 April 1942. She was described as possessing &#145;gentle dignity, strong courage, and an ever ready will to help&#146;  (<span class="italic">Belfast Telegraph</span>, 12 May 1921). Perhaps a fitting maxim for her career, which had been dedicated to alleviating &#145;suffering, and to better the conditions of her fellow beings, the poor, the sick and the children&#146;  (<span class="italic">Belfast Telegraph</span>, 23 Jan 1928), was one which she used when describing her life: &#145;I think I can say I have not spared myself&#146;  (<span class="italic">Belfast News-Letter</span>, 30 April 1930).<br>
