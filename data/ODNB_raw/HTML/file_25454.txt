<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Shore,  (Margaret) Emily</span>  (1819&#150;1839), <span class="occ">writer and naturalist</span>, was born on 25 December 1819 at Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, the eldest of the children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25455/', "Thomas Shore (1793&#150;1863)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25453/', "Shore, Louisa Catherine")</script>] and Margaret Anne Twopeny. A writer and educator who declined preferment in the Church of England on matters of conscience, Thomas Shore received private pupils at his home, where he also educated his daughters. All three of Shore's daughters distinguished themselves as writers and editors. Arabella Shore and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25453/', "Louisa Catherine Shore (1824&#150;1895)")</script>, Emily's younger sisters, were poets, critics, and translators, who eventually served as editors of the remarkable <span class="italic">Journal of Emily Shore</span>, published in 1891 and reissued with illustrations in 1898.<br>
<br>Emily Shore herself was a prodigious young polymath who, according to her sisters' introduction to the journal, also produced natural histories, histories of the Jews, the Greeks, and the Romans, two novels, three epics, many poems, and a translation of Xenophon's <span class="italic">Anabasis</span>. Of these works only two short essays survive, &#145;An account of a cuckoo&#146; and &#145;The Golden Crested Wren&#146;, both published by the <span class="italic">Penny Magazine</span> in December 1837. Her literary reputation, therefore, rests with her journal, kept from 5 July 1831 until 24 June 1839, a short time before her death at the age of nineteen. It is written in a fine, printed hand and runs to twelve octavo volumes. Only three of these are known to be extant, but portions from all twelve volumes were published in the 1890s editions, more than fifty years after its initial writing.<br>
<br>Emily Shore's exceptional journal is a <i>tour de force</i>, the product of a finely tuned intellect and giving evidence of an unslakeable thirst for learning. Shore, who served as a tutor to her younger siblings, read, digested, and wrote about everything from Shakespeare to Charles Babbage's <span class="italic">Economy of Manufactures</span>, from contemporary newspapers to classical texts, from the working of printing presses to the classification of flowers. Although she was young and removed from mainstream life, she had her fingers on the pulse of her time. In her journal she commented not merely on daily events in her own life but on institutions such as the London Zoo, and on the <span class="roman">Reform Bill</span> of 1832 and the new poor law of 1834. Every day she also spent hours recording the habits of birds in the family garden at Woodbury, Potton, Bedfordshire, observations which were partly detailed in her journal and would lead to her essays in the <span class="italic">Penny Magazine</span>.<br>
<br>Emily Shore's journal is therefore memorable for a number of reasons. First, it offers the life story of the coming of age both of a young woman and of an early Victorian intellect&#151;one without benefit of formal education. She was initially tutored by her parents but soon became an autodidact. As her sister Arabella said, &#145;She made her whole existence a happy schoolroom&#146;  (Shore, vi). This was particularly true of the natural world. At work on her journal when the &#145;crazes&#146; for natural history were in full bloom, she was a keen observer and recorder who aimed at working with scientific precision, noting that &#145;in the study of natural history it is particularly important not to come too hastily to conclusions, but to study facts from observation frequently and most carefully before an inference is drawn&#146;  (ibid., 119). The journal also offers one of the finest early examples of a diarist commenting on and experimenting with the diary form. Far from lacking in sophistication, her journal is finely crafted, another example of her care in learning; she found &#145;the use of the pen &hellip; among the most valuable means of improving the mind&#146;  (ibid., 138).<br>
<br>As well as an index to Emily Shore's learning, her feelings, and her sense of the journal form, in its last volume the journal becomes a unique, detailed nineteenth-century meditation on death by tuberculosis. When her family moved her to Madeira for her health's sake, she continued to record her impressions of self and surroundings, but as a naturalist had little energy to learn of new species or to enjoy their beauty and peculiarities. Instead, in the end she turned to read her own body and spirit and wrote the story of their struggles and of the body's ultimate decline. Although she ceased writing letters, which became &#145;an effort of mind and body which I dread to attempt&#146;  (Shore, 345&#150;6), she continued to document her illness in her journal: &#145;I feel weaker every morning, and suppose I am beginning to sink; still I can at times take up my pen&#146;  (ibid., 351). Loath to let her journal go, she would hold a pen at least one more time, on 24 June 1839, a fortnight before her death, when she made a last journal entry in a weakened hand. Emily Shore died of consumption on 7 July 1839 at Funchal, Madeira, and was buried there in the Strangers' burial-ground.<br>
