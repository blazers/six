<span class="headword">Clerke,  Bartholomew</span>  (<em>c.</em>1537&#150;1590), <span class="occ">civil lawyer</span>, was the son of John Clerke (<i>d</i>. 1573), of Wells, Somerset, a notary public and proctor of the arches, and Anne, daughter of Henry Grantoft of Huntingdonshire. He was educated at Eton College (<i>c</i>.1550&#150;1554) and King's College, Cambridge, where he was elected scholar on 23 August 1554 and proceeded BA in 1559. Appointed professor of rhetoric <i>c</i>.1563, Clerke was proctor in 1564 and took part in the public disputation for doctors' degrees in philosophy that was held in the presence of the queen on her visit to the university. Rumours circulated of his unsoundness in religion&#151;perhaps explained by his letter of December 1565 to William Cecil as chancellor of the university complaining of those who, &#145;though otherwise good and religious men&#146;, were too fond of wrangling about trifles, and &#145;feigned to themselves unheard of laws of conscience&#146;, notably in respect of the wearing of the surplice in ministration and the use of the traditional priest's square cap, both of which they rejected as popish. Clerke dubbed them &#145;fanatici superpellicani &amp; galeriani&#146; (&#145;surplice and cap fanatics&#146;) who &#145;infected many with their venom, not to say anabaptistical principles&#146;  (Strype, <span class="italic">Parker</span>, 197, bk 3, appx 43).<br>
<br>Clerke's studies, meanwhile, embraced both modern languages and the law, and at some stage they took him to France, where he was offered but declined a public readership at Angers. In 1568 he was recommended by Cecil and others to succeed Roger Ascham as Latin secretary to the queen, but the office was already promised to another, and in 1569 Clerke again served as university proctor. Through the influence, in all probability, of the poet turned statesman Thomas Sackville, Lord Buckhurst, Clerke was elected member for Bramber in the parliament of April 1571, and shortly thereafter accompanied his patron to Paris on an embassy to congratulate Charles IX on his marriage. On his return he resided for some months in Buckhurst's household where he worked on a much admired translation into Latin of Castiglione's <span class="italic">Il cortigiano</span> (&#145;The courtier&#146;), a series of discourses expounding the humanist values of the Italian Renaissance in which scholarship was allied to refinement and gentility. As elsewhere in Europe, the book became fashionable reading for the aristocracy, and Clerke's version went through three further editions in Elizabeth's reign (1577, 1579, and 1585). It was prefaced with letters of commendation from Edward de Vere, the earl of Oxford (to whom, it appears, Clerke had been tutor), Buckhurst, and John Caius.<br>
<br>Clerke proceeded LLD in 1572. His legal studies made him the ideal choice when Archbishop Parker heard that Burghley was looking for a scholar to refute Nicholas Sander's attack (<span class="italic">De visibili monarchia ecclesiae</span>) on the legitimacy of the queen's title. Parker reported that &#145;for his more estimation I have honested him with a room in the Arches &hellip; and he shall not want my advice and diligence&#146;  (Bruce and Perowne, 411). His work was forwarded to Burghley for approval and published in 1573 (<span class="italic">Fidelis servi subdito infidelio responsio, una cum errorum et calumniarum examine quae continentur in septimo libro a Nicholao Sandero conscripto</span>). In January of that year Clerke became a member of Doctors' Commons, and in May, by Parker's patronage, succeeded Thomas Yale as dean of the arches. The queen ordered Parker to rescind the appointment, on the pretence that he was too young to hold the post, but Clerke refused to be intimidated, pointing out that others had been preferred as young as he was and that to dismiss him would be to discredit him in his profession; he challenged a trial of his competence, and repeated that &#145;he would rather render his life than the office&#146;  (ibid., 417&#150;32). Parker respectfully held his ground, the appointment stood, and other offices followed. In November 1573 Clerke was member of a commission to visit the church, city, and diocese of Canterbury; in 1577 he was appointed a master in chancery and in 1578 became a judge of the court of audience. According to Aylmer he was one of the few lawyers who was &#145;painful&#146; and who did not &#145;follow his private gain&#146;  (Strype, <span class="italic">Aylmer</span>, 62).<br>
<br>Clerke figures prominently in the judicial records of the period 1572&#150;89. In December 1585 Clerke and Henry Killigrew were sent as members of the earl of Leicester's council of state to the Netherlands. Clerke's links were with the peace faction represented by Lord Burghley and the earl of Sussex, and Leicester would have preferred someone else, describing him as having &#145;good will, and a pretty scholar's wit&#146;, but &#145;no great stuff in him&#151;he is too little for these big fellows&#146;  (Bruce, 33). Clerke for his part was pessimistic as to the outcome of the expedition. In a series of letters to Burghley he wrote that &#145;here all is full of jealousies and mislikes&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP for.</span>, <i>1586&#150;7</i>, 75). The financial support of the states was much less than they had been led to expect, and there were tensions between the states and the earl. He found his work uncongenial and the climate unhealthy. His diligence, however, earned him Leicester's belated respect, and in October he was dispatched back to England on a special mission to the queen. In a memorandum of November 1586 he gave his opinion &#145;on the Queen's proceedings in the Low Countries&#146;, advising that a limited campaign of defending the four provinces was the only realistic option  (ibid., 247&#150;9). By April 1587 he was back at The Hague to assist Buckhurst and Sir John Norris in exploring the possibility of a peace settlement with Spain and to allay Dutch discontent at Leicester's conduct. On neither count was the mission successful, and in July, much to his relief, he was again recalled to England.<br>
<br>In 1573 Clerke inherited, along with his brother Francis, the lease of his father's farm at Merton in Surrey. He married, at some date after 1575, Eleanor Haselrigge (<i>d</i>. 1594), widow of Thomas Smith of Mitcham in Surrey, where they lived until 1583, when he bought the manor of Clapham. Clerke died at Clapham on either 15 or 16 March 1590, having added a codicil on 15 March to his will, which was proved two days later. He left the manor, together with leases of land at Grantchester, Waddon Mills, the parsonage of Ashe, and meadowland at Vauxhall to his son, Francis, his wife having in all cases a life interest. Provision was also made in his will for his daughter, Cecily (he hoped, God willing, that she would marry someone of his own name), his stepchildren and &#145;the poor children&#146; of his wife's brother John. Among several items of jewellery mentioned is a &#145;great cross of diamonds and rubies I had of the Lady Frances, Countess of Sussex&#146;. Clerke wanted a simple funeral, but left money for the building of a small chapel &#145;close to Clapham Chancel north window&#146; to contain a family tomb. The present church of St Paul's has preserved all that remains of this&#151;the figure of his son, kneeling, and the epitaph on Clerke and his wife.<br>
