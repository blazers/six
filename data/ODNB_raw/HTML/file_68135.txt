<span class="headword">Kelland,  Gilbert James</span>  (1924&#150;1997), <span class="occ">police officer</span>, was born on 17 March 1924 at Pickwell, near Georgeham, Devon, the only child of Edith Kelland, an unmarried domestic servant. Brought up by his grandparents, he attended Georgeham village school and Braunton secondary school before starting work at fourteen as a clerk at a local firm of agricultural merchants.<br>
<br>The Second World War took Kelland away from his rural background. He joined the Fleet Air Arm in May 1942 and served as a mechanic with 824 squadron aboard HMS <i>Striker</i> on Atlantic convoy duty. At demobilization, his career choice was made: he went to London to be sworn in as a constable of the Metropolitan Police on 1 July 1946. Kelland passed his probationary period on the Whitehall beat and became station cyclist at Rochester Row. Lean, dark, and over 6 feet tall, he excelled at long-distance running for the Metropolitan Police Athletic Club (which he chaired from 1964 to 1984). He was advanced to sergeant after four years and on 12 August 1950 married Edith Ellen Marshall (<i>b</i>. 1927/8), a typist, with whom he had two daughters.<br>
<br>From 1950 to 1955 Kelland worked in south London, initially in the Elephant and Castle area. He was dissuaded from writing his thesis on corruption when he attended the National Police Staff College in 1955 before being appointed an inspector. There was no busier police station than West End central, Savile Row, his posting from December 1955. Mayfair and Soho were notorious for a high incidence of shoplifting, drunkenness, and living off immoral earnings. Some 5000 prostitutes operated there before the <span class="roman">Street Offences Act</span> (1959). Inspector Kelland looked on his chief superintendent, Arthur Townsend, as a role model. His own reputation for fair and fearless policing was made as a chief inspector in Notting Hill between June 1959 and September 1961. Feeling still ran high after the race riots of 1958, but he encouraged stability by improving police relations with West Indian immigrants, closing illegal drinking dens, and trying to curb the profiteering slum-landlord Peter Rachman. The High Court case <i>Kelland v. de Freitas</i> (1961) was concerned with defining a landlord.<br>
<br>After two months at Lavender Hill station, Kelland returned to West End central as a superintendent in November 1961 and took charge of its anti-vice unit, the clubs office (1962&#150;4). &#145;Clip joints&#146; and gambling rackets were the latest problems in Soho; <i>Kelland v. Raymond</i> (1964) exposed loopholes in the <span class="roman">Betting and Gaming Act</span> (1960). He amassed evidence for the Denning inquiry into the Profumo affair (1963). Promoted to commander in 1965, Kelland combated violent crime in Tower Hamlets, worked in the management services department at Scotland Yard (1968&#150;70), and led all uniformed police in the West End, before being transferred in June 1971 to the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) as commander of north-west London. He became the deputy assistant commissioner responsible for south London six months later.<br>
<br>On 19 April 1973 Kelland was chosen by Commissioner Sir Robert Mark to investigate charges of corruption against the obscene publications squad (OPS), which had failed to halt the proliferation of pornographic bookshops in Soho. gaoled pornographer Jimmy Humphreys alleged that OPS officers had connived at his trade in return for large bribes. It took Kelland and his team of eight detectives almost three years to find independent corroboration. Their dogged struggle against insidious obstruction exposed a long-established criminal conspiracy. Of seventy-four policemen examined, twelve resigned, twenty-eight retired, and eight were dismissed. The biggest scandal in the Metropolitan Police for a century saw a dozen officers&#151;including a chief superintendent and a commander&#151;sentenced to prison in three highly publicized trials (1976&#150;8).<br>
<br>Praised for his thoroughness, Kelland became one of the top five policemen in London on 1 February 1977 when he was appointed as assistant commissioner &#145;A&#146; department, responsible for uniformed policing. Maintaining order at the mass picket of Grunwick Processing Ltd was a major task. Fears that OPS corruption might have infected other units of the CID prompted the new commissioner, David McNee, to transfer him to assistant commissioner (crime) on 1 August 1977. This placed him in control of over 3500 detectives, some of whom did not welcome his appointment. His fatherly demeanour and readiness to delegate won over subordinates, however, while his unforgiving glance was usually enough to silence the merest suggestion of rule bending. If anyone protested that his anxiety about misconduct verged on obsession, Kelland took it as a compliment. He reformed the drugs squad and flying squad, secured closer liaison between uniformed and plain-clothed officers, and devised formal codes of procedure to regulate potentially compromising operations. The careful use of resident informants (&#145;supergrasses&#146;) led to signal successes against organized crime, especially armed robbery. Voluntary blackouts of news proved helpful in kidnap cases. IRA bombing campaigns were a grave concern. Controversially, he published a racial breakdown of reported crime in March 1982 as a contribution to the public debate on policing and the black community which followed the Brixton riots of 1981.<br>
<br>Kelland was the longest serving officer in the metropolitan force by his retirement on 16 March 1984. He had received the queen's police medal in 1975 and a CBE in 1978. A member of the Parole Board (1986&#150;9), he aided an Amateur Athletic Association inquiry into drug abuse in 1988 and advised Consolidated Safeguards, a private security firm. He died of prostate cancer at his home, 9 Croft Lane, Henfield, Sussex, on 30 August 1997.<br>
<br>With his erect carriage, immaculate uniform, and neat moustache, Gilbert Kelland appeared a copper of the old school. He was an unashamed patriot and an active freemason who feared that modern youngsters lacked a proper sense of shame. His traditional ideas of service and undisputed integrity helped to restore confidence in the Metropolitan Police during a troubled period in its history.<br>
