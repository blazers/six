<span class="headword">Race,  Ernest Dawson</span>  (1914&#150;1964), <span class="occ">furniture and industrial designer</span>, was born on 16 October 1914 in Newcastle upon Tyne, the third of the three sons of Joseph Dawson Race (1880&#150;1966), a banker, and May Tweddle (1882&#150;1950). Joseph Race was born in Hankow (Hankou), China, a month after the death of his father, a Methodist minister. He returned to Weardale with his mother and was brought up there. Race moved with his family from Northumbria to Hammersmith when he was small. He was educated at St Paul's School in London, which he left in 1932, before moving on to be trained as an interior designer at the Bartlett school of architecture of London University where he followed a three-year course. On completing his studies he began making his living as a model maker but very soon, about 1936, turned to lighting design for the manufacturing company Troughton and Young, under the lead of its distinguished in-house designer, A. B. Read. The company was among the very few creating modern lighting designs in these years and the short apprenticeship that Race undertook there was undoubtedly very important for his later development. He left in 1937 to form his own firm, Race Fabrics, in London's Motcomb Street, through which he sold designs of his own which were hand-woven in India. The fact that he had a missionary aunt based in India, who ran a weaving workshop in Madras and whom he had visited for four months immediately after leaving Troughton and Young, made this possible.<br>
<br>The wartime years were important ones for Race, who worked through them as a member of the Auxiliary Fire Service. It was during that time that he married Sara Hope Blower (known as Sally), who was born on 14 September 1912. Sally had also studied interior design at the Bartlett school. The couple married in 1941. At the end of the war Race was employed by the architects Colcutt and Hemp, but most of his creativity was dedicated to designing unit furniture at home. It was in this context that he met his future business partner, an engineer named J. W. Noel Jordan, who was trying to move into the area of furniture at the end of the war. After he put an advertisement in <span class="italic">The Times</span>, to which Race responded, Race and Jordan founded Ernest Race Ltd together. The former became the director and chief designer while the latter took on the role of managing director of the new venture. They began to manufacture furniture from aluminium alloy, having received a licence from the Board of Trade which made it impossible for them to use wood.<br>
<br>Race's little &#145;BA&#146; dining chair of 1945, the tapering T-section legs and seat and back structures of which were made of sand-cast aluminium, featured in the exhibition entitled &#145;Britain can make it&#146;, held in London's Victoria and Albert Museum in that year. It was visible in a number of room settings but also provided the seating in the tea-room at the exhibition. The chair was part of a complete dining-room set which included a table, a little coffee-table, and a sideboard. All of them were made from aluminium but had tops made of holoplast, a laminated plastic with a mahogany veneer. The manufacturing company produced more than 250,000 BA chairs between 1945 and 1969 and they became familiar objects in many of Britain's public buildings and commercial areas through this period. Combining lightness with elegance, the chair won Race a gold medal at the prestigious Milan triennale exhibition of 1954.<br>
<br>In 1948 Race designed and manufactured a metal-frame wing chair and set of storage units which were included in the exhibition linked to the international competition for low cost furniture design which was held in New York's Museum of Modern Art. The success of the BA chair was repeated by two more designs that Race produced for the Festival of Britain, a large exhibition located on the south bank of the River Thames in London in 1951. Intended as outdoor seating, both Antelope and Springbok were made out of thin steel rod and presented a delicate, spindly form to their viewers. Their silhouettes conformed perfectly to the need for lightness and modernity that was &#145;in the air&#146; at that time and they provided a level of visual and technological sophistication which was then more apparent in designs emanating from the USA, Scandinavia, and Italy. Race succeeded in putting British design on the international map in the early 1950s and his two chairs of 1951 were among the festival's lasting icons. Soon they could be found in pub gardens and outdoor public areas across Britain. Their small ball feet, made of cast aluminium and said to have been inspired by molecular structures, were both stylistically evocative and practical as they ensured that the thin steel legs of the chairs did not force their way into the flooring on which they sat. The bent ply seat of Antelope was a result of another spin-off from wartime technological developments.<br>
<br>In 1953 Race designed the Neptune lounge chair for the P. &amp; O. shipping line. For this design he abandoned his use of metal and used plywood which became much more widely available after the war with the lifting of post-war restrictions upon its use. It was a striking chair made of two identical curved plywood forms which could be folded into each other.<br>
<br>Race was a director of Ernest Race Ltd (from 1961 Race Furniture Ltd) until 1954, after which date he worked as a freelance designer for the company. During the last ten years of his life he continued to design furniture pieces but never achieved the same level of success as he did in the first decade after the war. Items he designed included the Flamingo chair of 1959 and the Sheppey sofa of 1963. His designs were well received abroad and he showed pieces at the Milan triennales of 1951, 1954, 1957, and 1960, winning a number of gold and silver medals over that time period. In 1953 he was made a royal designer for industry, an award made to important and influential designers by the Royal Society of Arts. Professionally he was one of the small number of highly innovatory British designers who embraced the potential of new materials and the modern idiom in design without reservation, and whose creations made a significant impact in the mass environment and were recognized internationally. This impact was made all the more significant by the fact that he and a partner formed their own manufacturing company to produce Race's designs. He played a key role in the formulation of what came to be called the &#145;contemporary&#146; style, a softened version of its more austere pre-war predecessor, modernism. The former became extremely popular in Britain in the 1950s, both in the decor of private dwellings and in the interiors of public buildings. With a strong sense of humour, Race remained a quiet, private and hard-working man throughout his career and he died prematurely in London on 22 January 1964 at the relatively young age of forty-nine, survived by his wife. The 1990s saw a revival of interest in Race's early designs and a number of them were put back into production.<br>
