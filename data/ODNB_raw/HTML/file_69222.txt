<span class="headword">Brome,  Henry</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1681), <span class="occ">bookseller</span>, was born probably in the early 1620s in Evershot, Dorset, perhaps the second of at least seven children of John Brome, of whom the eldest was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/3501/', "Alexander Brome")</script>, the poet. The father was styled as a gentleman when Alexander was admitted to Gray's Inn in 1648, although confirmation of this family status has not been found. Henry Brome probably went to the local school, but at some point during the next twenty years the family moved to nearby West Milton, Dorset, as that was the paternal address given when, on 2 October 1646, Henry Brome was apprenticed to John Allen of the London Haberdashers' Company for seven years. He was freed on 14 October 1653. He followed his brother Alexander's example in marrying a bookseller's widow: by 27 September 1658 he had &#145;lately married&#146; Joanna (<i>d</i>. 1684), widow of Francis Leach  (Stationers' Company, court book D, fol. 36<i>r</i>). On 22 May 1664, the Bromes' first child was born, a son, Charles, and on 28 April 1668, they baptized their second, a daughter, Allet.<br>
<br>Henry Brome's name first appears on an imprint in 1656, with his shop at the sign of the Hand in St Paul's Churchyard; in 1658 he moved just to the north, at the Gun in Ivy Lane, where he remained until 1665. He was one of only a few booksellers who had been apprenticed to members of the Haberdashers' Company, from whom he may have gained special experience in auctioneering and making inventories&#151;skills that Brome was later called upon to use. In marrying Leach's widow, Brome did not gain Leach's bookshop as that went to Leach's son Thomas, but he did secure from Leach an association with the royalist author Roger L'Estrange which was to prove long and productive. In 1659 he was already selling the work of L'Estrange's brother Hamon, and during the winter and spring of 1660 he was helping to publish, anonymously, the prolific Roger, who later recalled of his many royalist works on the eve of the Restoration that &#145;honest Harry Brome got them printed too, to his very great Hazzard&#146;  (L'Estrange, 31). Especially in 1659&#150;62 and again after 1678, L'Estrange benefited greatly from Brome's support of his energetic pamphleteering as well as his later journal <span class="italic">The Observator</span>, which Brome published in the last months of his life in 1681. In 1680&#150;81 L'Estrange accounted for almost half the titles the busy Brome had in print, and the two were very closely associated in satirical attacks at this date, such as <span class="italic">A Dialogue betwixt H.B.'s. Ghost, and his Dear Author R.L.S.</span> (1681).<br>
<br>Including L'Estrange's many publications and republications, Brome's list averaged about twenty new titles a year, with the highest number appearing in the year before his death, when the lapsing of the so-called <span class="roman">Licensing Act</span> and the exclusion crisis had much increased pamphleteering. Controversial works aside, his list is marked by a preponderance of religious, scientific, and literary titles, reflecting the work and the tastes of his clientele, who seem to have included many of &#145;the most important figures in the political, social, religious and intellectual life of Restoration England&#146;  (Mandelbrote, 74). Having left Ivy Lane early in 1666 for premises in Little Britain (first at the Dial, and then at the Star), Brome returned in 1669 to an address closer to St Paul's, where his shop at the sign of the Gun in Ludgate Street flourished, with the family living upstairs. On 2 October 1678, Brome applied (along with the bookseller Richard Chiswell the elder) and was admitted gratis to the freedom of the Stationers' Company. He was formally freed on 4 November and the next year was chosen as one of the company's renter wardens. Brome's prosperous business seems to have served its customers as something of a library. Brome was said to have given considerable support to L'Estrange, and his estate, less debts and charges, was valued at his death at &pound;2785. He died at Ludgate Street about 11 May 1681.<br>
<br>After Brome's death his wife, Joanna, took over the business until her own death late in May 1684, just before their son Charles reached his majority. Subject to prosecution in October 1681 for publishing a too controversial issue of <span class="italic">The Observator</span>, she was able to get her case transferred to the king's bench; again in 1683, she was presented to the London sessions, this time for printing <span class="italic">The Observator</span> without licence, but that publication continued uninterrupted nevertheless. She had been accused of improper relations with L'Estrange, but he was notorious for his ways with printers' wives. She was styled &#145;rich and proud&#146; in the correspondence of a disgruntled client  (Raine MSS, G. Hickes to T. Comber, 17 Jan 1684) and came to marry her daughter Allet to Alexander Davenant, brother of Charles, with a portion of &pound;3000. Charles Brome, who was freed by patrimony on 10 June 1684, kept up the business at the Gun in Ludgate Street. His publishing list recalls that of his father but later displayed Jacobite tendencies. In 1705 Dunton described him as &#145;a Genteel Man in his Garb, a Prudent Man in his Actions, and thriving Man in his Shop&#146;  (Dunton, 300). His last imprints are dated 1711&#150;12.<br>
