<span class="headword">Dougharty <span class="st"> [Doharty]</span>,  John</span>  (1677&#150;1755), <span class="occ">mathematician</span>, was born in Dublin, the son of John O'Dougherty and a descendant of the O'Doughertys of Inishowen, co. Donegal. By 1698 he was in England, marrying Priscilla Fereder (<i>d</i>. 1741) at Chaddesley Corbett, Worcestershire, on 5 November. They settled in Kidderminster, where their eldest child, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/73796/', "Joseph Dougharty (1699&#150;1737)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/58378/', "Doharty, John")</script>], was born, then moved to Bewdley, where further children followed from 1702. There Dougharty kept a school, teaching writing, arithmetic, bookkeeping, gauging, navigation, and astronomy, and he probably surveyed land also. In 1707 he published <span class="italic">The General Gauger</span>, dedicated to the named commissioners of excise. Its sixth and last edition was in 1750. By 1711 he had moved to teach in Worcester, first in High Street, and from 1720 in Edgar Tower. The school was patronized by local gentry, some of whose estates he surveyed in partnership with his sons Joseph and John (Doharty) the younger. Their masterpiece was the estate atlas of Hanbury Hall (1731&#150;3), drawn by the father from the sons' surveys. In 1716 he had been appointed lay clerk and inspector of works to Worcester Cathedral, and became choirmaster. The two daughters who had survived to maturity, Elizabeth and Joyce, married and left home, and his wife, Priscilla, was buried on 8 August 1741, leaving only Dougharty and son John in the Tower. His only other book, <span class="italic">Mathematical Digests</span> [1749], encapsulating his teaching, was issued in parts from the end of 1748, the complete work having 450 pages. It was dedicated to George, Lord Viscount Deerhurst.<br>
<br>Dougharty died on 11 January 1755 and was buried in the cathedral cloister at Worcester. An encomium, probably by son <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/58378/', "John Doharty")</script>, describes him as dignified, sincere, generous, cheerful, and &#145;ever communicative&#146;. The combination of his amiability with talent and hard work undoubtedly led to his successful career as a mathematician, teacher, and land surveyor.<br>
