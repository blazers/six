<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Down,  John Langdon Haydon  Langdon-</span>  (1828&#150;1896), <span class="occ">physician and expert in mental science</span>, was born in Torpoint, Cornwall, on 18 November 1828, the youngest of seven children (three daughters and four sons) of Joseph Almond Down (<i>d</i>. 1853), apothecary, and his wife, Hanna Haydon; his eldest sister's descendants included Walter Langdon Brown, J. Maynard (later Baron) Keynes, and Geoffrey Keynes. Down was educated at local schools, including the Devonport Classical and Mathematical School, from 1839 to 1842, and became an apprentice to his father. He also attended a local literary and scientific institution. In 1846 he went to London to work in the laboratory of the Pharmaceutical Society, where he helped Michael Faraday with his work on gases. A breakdown in his health forced him home. During this period he lectured at mechanics' institutes and wrote a prize-winning essay: &#145;The wisdom and beneficence of the creator as displayed in the compensation between the animal and vegetable kingdoms&#146;.<br>
<br>After the death of his father in 1853 Down decided to move from chemistry to the more lucrative field of medicine, and became a student at the London Hospital (MRCS and LSA, 1856), where he won many prizes. In 1858 he took the London MB and was appointed medical superintendent at the Earlswood Asylum for Idiots in Redhill, Surrey, maintaining a lectureship in comparative anatomy at the London Hospital. In 1859 he took the MD and the MRCP and was appointed assistant physician to the London Hospital; he became FRCP in 1869. In 1868 Down retired from Earlswood to establish a private home for mentally handicapped people at Normansfield, Hampton Wick, which he ran with the assistance of his wife, Mary (<i>d</i>. 1900), daughter of Philip Crellin, outfitter, of London, whom he had married in 1860. They had three sons and a daughter. Down remained at Normansfield for the rest of his career, while maintaining a consultant position at the London Hospital and a private Harley Street practice, and established himself as the leading British expert on idiocy. Normansfield proved a great success: it pioneered education training and grew to hold 200 residents by the time of Down's death, attracting foreign visitors, and hosting medical meetings in its beautiful grounds. As a model it showed the need for specialized institutional care for idiocy.<br>
<br>Down was vice-president and a Lettsomian lecturer of the Royal Medical and Chirurgical Society, a member of the Anthropological Institute, the Medico-Psychological Association, and the Neurological, Clinical, and Pathological societies, and a founder member of the Thames valley branch of the British Medical Association. In politics he was a Liberal and a supporter of women's education. In 1884 he was made a JP for London, Westminster, and Middlesex, and in 1889 he became an alderman of Middlesex county council. His handsome appearance, high principles, and genial manner won him a powerful influence over his patients and the real affection of his colleagues.<br>
<br>Down's appointment as medical superintendent at Earlswood, so soon after qualification, was based on his outstanding promise as a student. With his qualities of zeal, right-mindedness, and an eminently practical turn of mind, he promised to cast new light on the causes of idiocy. His background in comparative anatomy and outpatient care of women influenced his research at Earlswood. He published papers on maternal health, tuberculosis, obstetrics, and birth order as causes of idiocy, and on the anatomy of the mouth, teeth, and skull. He is best-known for recognizing the &#145;Mongol&#146; as a distinct type of idiot in his 1866 paper, &#145;Observations on an ethnic classification of idiots&#146;  (<span class="italic">London Hospital Reports</span>, 3, 1866, 259&#150;62). His theory was that these idiots (and others&#151;the &#145;Malay&#146; and &#145;Negroid&#146; types, for instance) were products of racial degeneration. This supported the idea that all races were simply variations within a unified mankind, and was intended to counter the polygenist theories which had supported slavery in the American Civil War. The theory of Mongolian origins was dismissed in the early twentieth century, but the idea of a distinct type persisted and was generally given the name Down's syndrome. Many of Down's most important findings were published in his only major publication, <span class="italic">On some of the Mental Affections of Childhood and Youth</span> (1887).<br>
<br>Langdon-Down (he had changed his name by deed poll) died suddenly on 7 October 1896 at Normansfield. He was survived by his wife, and by his sons Reginald and Percival, who carried on his work there, as did his grandson. He was cremated at Woking on 10 October and a memorial service was held for him at St Thomas's, Portman Square, London.<br>
