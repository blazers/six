<span class="headword">Thompson,  Robert Michael <span class="st"> [Bobby]</span></span>  (1911&#150;1988), <span class="occ">comedian</span>, was born on 18 November 1911 at 4 The Staiths, Penshaw, near Sunderland, co. Durham, the youngest child of John Thompson, colliery overman, and his wife, Mary Cain. He had three brothers and three sisters. Having lost both parents before reaching the age of eight, Bobby was brought up by married sisters and moved through a number of schools in the Fatfield and Penshaw area of the county. From the age of fourteen he worked at North Biddick colliery, remaining there until the pit closed in 1931. For ten years he moved between unemployment and casual labouring jobs while entertaining in his spare time as a singer and harmonica player. He was called up for war service in February 1941 and acted as company runner in the Border regiment based at Carlisle, Cumberland. He served until July 1944, returning to the north-east after two years of civilian life in Cumberland.<br>
<br>After a further five years in and out of work Thompson was persuaded to audition for a new regional radio series entitled <span class="italic">Wot Cheor, Geordie</span>. Success encouraged him to give up a post he had just acquired at the Royal Ordnance Factory, Birtley, to become a professional entertainer. The radio series reached a wide audience in the north-east and brought him work in theatres throughout the region. By Christmas 1958 he was top of the bill in the prestigious Theatre Royal pantomime in Newcastle upon Tyne; this was followed shortly by a television series, <span class="italic">The Bobby Thompson Show</span>, produced by the newly formed Tyne-Tees company. The series was not a long-term success, perhaps because his material was not extensive enough, or because his act was more suited to the intimacy of a working-men's club or small theatre. As a result, his career began to founder. It was resurrected in the mid-1960s under new management and extensive bookings in working-men's clubs led to a long-playing record of his act in 1978. The record sold out in the region and occasioned his appearance on <span class="italic">Wogan</span>, a major national television chat show.<br>
<br>Thompson was as popular in the working-men's clubs as he had been in the theatres. This was his secret. Described as a born comedian by his radio producer, Richard Kelly, he performed in a style rooted deep in nineteenth-century north-eastern humour. He worked at times in Yorkshire, but mostly in the area bounded by the Tweed and the Tees, and his ultimate success was limited to his native region. National exposure tended to leave audiences mildly amused, yet baffled by the little man's humour and the impenetrability of his accent. His two acts as the Little Waster and Soldier Bobby&#151;&#145;You didn't laugh at me when I was fighting for yer!&#146;&#151;relied heavily on experiences shared with his audiences: outside toilets, home-made rugs, clothes bought through catalogues, and the intricacies of betting on the horses&#151;these were the very stuff of his act. Small and slight, he brought laughter the minute he appeared on stage as the Little Waster, &#145;a one-off emaciated figure crowned by a flat cap &hellip; the little man fighting back&#146;, as comedian Ken Dodd described him  (Nicolson, 8).<br>
<br>Despite a simple act, Bobby Thompson's was a complex character. A lifelong Roman Catholic, he gave much support to charity. He was also famed, in later life in particular, for his unreliability and tendency to double booking. He gambled&#151;in early life on the dogs and later in casinos. Financial problems took him to court on more than one occasion and led to a bankruptcy inquiry in 1986. He was a heavy smoker and drinker. Off-stage he was smart, dapper, and besuited and enjoyed the services of a personal chauffeur at the height of his career. He was married three times: first on 11 April 1936 to Anna Marjoram; they had one daughter and the marriage was dissolved in 1945. In the same year, on 4 October, he married Phyllis Coates (1910&#150;1967); they had two sons. On 31 December 1982 he married Eleanor Cicely (Cissie) Palmer (<i>d</i>. 1995). Between the second and third marriage he was very close to his housekeeper, Lottie Tate. His biography hints at an illegitimate child born elsewhere in the 1950s  (Nicolson, 60). In later life he lived at Whitley Bay on the Northumberland coast and continued to perform in the clubs into the 1980s. He died of myocardial infarction and emphysema at Preston Hospital, North Shields, on 16 April 1988. A requiem mass in Cullercoats was followed by cremation at the Whitley Bay crematorium on 20 April 1988. Earlier that year he had featured in a Channel 4 television documentary, and he was considered worthy of a <span class="italic">Times</span> obituary, therein described as a cult figure and folk hero who lost two fortunes.<br>
