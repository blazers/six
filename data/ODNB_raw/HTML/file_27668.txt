<span class="headword">Travers, Sir  Eaton Stannard</span>  (1782&#150;1858), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, was the third son of John Travers of Hethyfield Grange, co. Cork, Ireland (where he was born) and his wife, Mehetabel, the only daughter of John Colthurst of Dripsey Castle, co. Cork. He entered the navy in September 1798 on the <i>Juno</i> in the North Sea, where during the following year he was on boat service along the Netherlands coast. He was similarly employed in the West Indies during 1800&#150;01. In March 1802 he was moved to the <i>Elephant</i>, and in October 1803 to the <i>Hercule</i>, the flagship of Sir John Thomas Duckworth. In November, while Duckworth remained at Jamaica, the <i>Hercule</i> was attached to the squadron under Commodore Loring blockading Cap Fran&ccedil;ais. On 30 November, when the French ships agreed to surrender, Travers was with Lieutenant Nisbet Josiah Willoughby in the launch which took possession of the <i>Clorinde</i> after she had got on shore, and claimed to have been the chief agent in saving the ship by swimming to the shore and so making fast a hawser, by which the frigate was hauled off the rocks. In January and February 1804 he was again with Willoughby in the advance battery at the siege of Cura&ccedil;ao, and was afterwards publicly thanked by the admiral for his bravery. On 23 September 1804 Travers was promoted lieutenant and to command the schooner <i>Ballahou</i>, but in February 1805, on her being ordered to Newfoundland, he was appointed to the <i>Surveillante</i>, in which again he saw sharp boat service on the Spanish main.<br>
<br>In 1806 the <i>Hercule</i> returned to England, and in December Travers was appointed to the frigate <i>Alcm&egrave;ne</i> off the coast of France, until she was wrecked off the mouth of the Loire on 29 April 1809. He was afterwards in the <i>Imp&eacute;rieuse</i>, on the Walcheren expedition, and in 1810 in the Mediterranean, where for the next four years he was engaged in minor operations against the coasting vessels and coast batteries along the shores of France and Italy. He was repeatedly recommended by his captains and the commander-in-chief for his zeal, activity, and gallantry, but it was not until 15 June 1814 that he received the often-earned promotion to commander. He is said to have been upwards of 100 times engaged with the enemy; to have been in command at the blowing up and destruction of eight batteries and three Martello towers; and to have taken part in the capture of about sixty vessels, eighteen or twenty of them armed, and several cut out from under batteries.<br>
<br>The <i>Imp&eacute;rieuse</i> was paid off in September 1814. In April 1815 Travers married Anne Palmer, the eldest daughter of William Steward of Great Yarmouth; they had five sons and two daughters. He remained unemployed until the summer of 1828, when he was appointed to command the <i>Rose</i> (18 guns). From her he was advanced to post rank on 19 November 1829, mainly, it would seem, at the desire of the duke of Clarence. The latter, who knew of his long and active war service, later, as William IV, made him a KH (4 February 1834) and knighted him on 5 March 1834. Travers had no further employment afloat; he became rear-admiral on the retired list on 9 July 1855, and died at Great Yarmouth, Norfolk, on 4 March 1858. He was a brave and resourceful amphibious officer who achieved belated recognition.<br>
