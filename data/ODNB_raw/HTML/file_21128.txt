<span class="headword">Pain,  James</span>  (1779/80&#150;1877), <span class="occ">architect and builder</span>, was born at Isleworth in Middlesex, the eldest son of James Pain, builder and surveyor, and a grandson of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21130/', "William Pain")</script>. He was apprenticed to John Nash, as was his younger brother <a name="cosubject_21128"></a><span class="headword">George Richard Pain</span>  (1792/3&#150;1838)<span class="occ"></span>, who was born in London. After Nash had designed Lough Cutra Castle, co. Galway, for Charles Vereker in 1811, he recommended that the two brothers should be given charge of carrying out the work. James, who was already in his early thirties, had arrived in Ireland by the summer of 1813 and soon established himself in Limerick. George Richard, who exhibited architectural designs at the Royal Academy from the London address of 1 Diana Place, Fitzroy Square, between 1810 and 1814, may possibly have gone to Ireland a little later; he settled in Cork but worked in close partnership with James until his death.<br>
<br>Between them the two brothers were responsible as architects or contractors for a large number of churches, country houses, court houses, prisons, and bridges in the south and west of Ireland. It was said that, of the two, James was better at running the business and planning buildings, while George Richard, the more skilful draughtsman, designed the elevations. The brothers tended to take an orthodox, academic approach towards their classical buildings, but they were generally more fanciful in their Gothic and Tudor Gothic designs. Their country houses, usually castellated or Tudor Gothic in Nash's picturesque manner, include Dromoland Castle, co. Clare (from 1819), Mitchelstown Castle, co. Cork (1823), Strancally Castle, co. Waterford (<i>c</i>.1830), and Castle Bernard, King's county (<i>c</i>.1833). At Blackrock, on the outskirts of Cork, they remodelled the existing riverside castle in 1828&#150;9 for the use of Cork corporation. Within the city they designed the house of correction (1818&#150;19), the Cork county club (1829&#150;31) and the county and city court house (1830&#150;35), all classical buildings. Works in Limerick included the county gaol (1817&#150;22), Bael's Bridge (1831), Athlunkard Bridge (1833), and Thomond Bridge (1837).<br>
<br>In 1823 James Pain was appointed architect to the board of first fruits for the ecclesiastical province of Cashel, responsible for all the churches and glebe houses within the jurisdiction. He continued to work for the board, which was replaced by the ecclesiastical commissioners in 1833, until at least 1843. Assisted by George Richard he built many new churches, some&#151;such as St John's, Buttevant, co. Cork (1826)&#151;on a cruciform plan but most of them simple rectangular halls with a tall tower at the west end and ornamented with needle-sharp pinnacles. Between the 1820s and the 1840s he surveyed all the existing churches in the province of Cashel, some of which had been built to his own designs; these survey plans and elevations, bound into six volumes, are preserved in the library of the Representative Church Body, Dublin. George Richard designed several Catholic churches, including the Gothic Holy Trinity Capuchin Church, Cork (begun 1832) and the classical St Patrick's, Cork (1836). For the Church of Ireland in Cork he made classical alterations to Christ Church (1828) and designed St Luke's, Summerhill (1837), in a Tudor Gothic style.<br>
<br>George Richard Pain died in Cork, where he lived, on 26 December 1838 at the age of forty-five and was buried at the church of St Mary Shandon in Cork. James lived on for many years in Limerick, where he died at his home, 17 Upper Glentworth Street, on 13 December 1877, aged ninety-seven. He was buried four days later at St Mary's Cathedral, Limerick.<br>
