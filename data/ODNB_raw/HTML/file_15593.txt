<span class="headword">King, Sir  Robert</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1657), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was the eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15569/', "Sir John King (d. 1637)")</script> of Boyle Abbey, co. Roscommon, and his wife, Catherine Drury. He succeeded his father as muster-master-general of Ireland in 1618, was knighted in 1621, and served in the administration of Ireland throughout the 1620s and 1630s. King married twice. His first wife, Frances Folliott, the daughter of Henry Folliott, first Baron Folliott, of Ballyshannon, died on 13 March 1638. His second wife, Sophia Cecil (<i>c</i>.1618&#150;1691), the daughter of Sir Edward Zouch of Woking, Surrey, had married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/4975/', "Edward Cecil, Viscount Wimbledon")</script>, in 1635 and was left a rich young widow on Wimbledon's death in November 1638. Cecil (or Wimbledon) House on the Strand was to be King's residence in London in the 1640s and 1650s and the place where he was to die.<br>
<br>Elected for the borough of Boyle in the Irish parliaments of 1634 and 1640, King played no part in the initial attack on the earl of Strafford, and gave evidence against his old master only once he had been called to London as a witness. In the event, his account of Strafford's tyrannical intentions, and his support of Sir Henry Vane's evidence &#145;that the army in Ireland should be employed against England&#146;  (BL, Harleian MS 164, fol. 153), was an important factor in bringing about the lord lieutenant's execution.<br>
<br>King was still in London at the outbreak of the Irish rising in October 1641, but in 1642 he returned to Roscommon, where he fought in the battle of Ballintobber. In April 1643 he travelled to Oxford with William Jephson and Arthur Hill, hoping to persuade Charles I to allow parliament to raise more money for the Irish war. Their failure confirmed King in his support of parliament, and in the summer of 1643 he was appointed to a council of war for Ireland, and he continued to give advice to the various Irish committees. He had taken the solemn league and covenant by late 1644, and in January 1645 Charles I finally dismissed him as muster-master-general, saying that he was &#145;a person disaffected to us, having taken the Covenant and adhering to the rebels&#146;  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Carte 13, fol. 528<i>r</i>). In April 1645 King was appointed one of parliament's Ulster commissioners, with orders to direct the war effort and liaise with the Scottish commanders in the province. From November 1645 the Ulster commissioners were involved in attempts to persuade the king's lord lieutenant, the marquess of Ormond (James Butler), to join the parliamentarians. Ormond's decision to make peace with the Irish confederates in the summer of 1646 was a set-back, but the collapse of the &#145;Ormond peace&#146; soon afterwards gave King and his colleagues another chance. In September King was named one of the five commissioners who would reopen peace talks with Ormond. In June 1647 an agreement was finally concluded, and the lord lieutenant surrendered Dublin to parliament. King's position during these negotiations was ambiguous. He was loyal to parliament but was also considered to be one of Ormond's friends, and he corresponded privately with the lord lieutenant during the negotiations. King also remained aloof from the factionalism of Westminster, and his primary concern seems to have been the survival of the protestant interest in Ireland.<br>
<br>This overriding concern for the fate of Ireland also characterized King's reaction to the &#145;revolution&#146; of the late 1640s and early 1650s. He was apparently happy to serve parliament after the execution of the king, and he advised Oliver Cromwell in his invasion of Ireland in August 1649. He was reappointed muster-master-general in November 1649, and returned in early 1651 to Ireland, where he helped to organize the pay and supply the army. During this period he cemented his ties with the Irish protestant community with a series of marriages for his children with leading families such as the Cootes, Merediths, and Fentons. His strong ties with the regime and the Irish protestants made him an influential figure in the early Cromwellian parliaments: he was chosen to represent Ireland in the nominated assembly of 1653, and sat for Sligo, Leitrim, and Roscommon in the parliament of 1654. He was elected for the same seat in 1656, and was expected to play an important part in the forthcoming parliament. King duly travelled to England, but fell ill in the winter of 1656&#150;7 and died in June 1657. He was succeeded by his son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15571/', "Sir John King")</script>, who became Lord Kingston in 1660.<br>
