<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Smith <span class="st"> [<em>married name </em>Beesley]</span>,  Dorothy Gladys <span class="st"> [Dodie]</span></span>  (1896&#150;1990), <span class="occ">playwright and writer</span>, was born on 3 May 1896 at Stonycroft, Whitefield, in Lancashire, the only child of Ernest Walter Smith (<i>c</i>.1868&#150;1898), a bank manager, and his wife, Ella (Nell) Furber (1874&#150;1914). Her father died when Dodie was two, and her mother took her to live with her grandparents, three uncles, and two aunts at Kingston House, Old Trafford, Manchester. So Dodie enjoyed a charmed childhood at the centre of eight doting adults, who involved her in all their activities, an upbringing to which she later attributed her success as a playwright. The Furbers were dedicated to amusement and passionate about the theatre; they held music and recitation soir&eacute;es at home, and the uncles acted in productions by the Atheneum, one of Manchester's sixty-four amateur dramatics societies. Here Dodie made her stage d&eacute;but at eight, and fixed on becoming an actress. When her mother remarried in 1910 (her new husband was Alec Gerald Seton-Chisholm), Dodie accompanied them to London, where she attended St Paul's Girls' School. In 1912, at the age of sixteen, she successfully auditioned for the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, but her first year there was blighted by the death of her mother from cancer at forty.<br>
<br>Despite Dodie's lack of acting talent or beauty (she was only 5 feet tall, with strong features and a heavy bosom; &#145;my looks had gone,&#146; she always said, &#145;by the age of seven&#146;), she managed to scrape a precarious existence for several years on the stage. &#145;I could always talk myself into a part,&#146; she would say, &#145;and act myself out of it.&#146; Living in a girls' hostel called the Three Arts Club in the Marylebone Road, London, she acted in army concert parties, end-of-pier farces, and touring productions. She took a job at the newly formed Everyman Theatre in Hampstead, London, and was seduced (with her enthusiastic co-operation) by its founder, Norman MacDermott. Eventually, at twenty-six, she decided that a proper job would be preferable to penury and went to work at Heals, the furniture emporium, running its art gallery. Here she embarked with determination upon an affair with the married chairman of the company, Ambrose Heal, who already had an established mistress, Prudence Maufe. Ambrose gave her the Underwood typewriter on which she wrote, in 1929, her first play, <span class="italic">Autumn Crocus</span>. She had been to the Leipzig toy fair to buy goods for Heals, and while there dreamed up a plot about a spinster schoolmistress from Lancashire who falls in love with a married Tyrolean innkeeper. The play was bought by Basil Dean for &pound;100. It made Dodie, who had been earning &pound;4 a week, rich and famous overnight in 1931. &#145;Shopgirl writes play&#146;, proclaimed the billboards.<br>
<br>After an apparently disastrous first night, <span class="italic">Autumn Crocus</span>, starring Fay Compton and Francis Lederer, ran for a year in the West End, and was later filmed. It was followed by a succession of light comedies: <span class="italic">Service</span> (1932), <span class="italic">Touch Wood</span> (1934, the first to be written under her own name instead of the pseudonym C. L. Anthony), <span class="italic">Call it a Day</span> (1935), <span class="italic">Bonnet over the Windmill</span> (1937), and <span class="italic">Dear Octopus</span> (1938), which established Dodie Smith as the most consistently successful woman playwright of her time. She appeared to have a deft touch, knowing just what the 1930s West End audience wanted: well-crafted middlebrow comedies with a skein of sentiment. But with <span class="italic">Dear Octopus</span>, centred on a family reunion, and starring John Gielgud, Marie Tempest, and Leon Quartermaine, she achieved her biggest triumph. The play, catching the mood of the time exactly, ran for two years; and its moving &#145;grand toast&#146; speech (originally delivered by Gielgud), a paean to the durability of the family, ensured its place in repertory for the next sixty years.<br>
<br>But at the height of her fame, with her name in lights, Dodie went into exile. At Heals she had met her future husband, Alec Beesley (1903&#150;1987), seven years her junior. Handsome, gentle, and artistic, he gave up his job (as advertising manager of Heals) to become Dodie's business manager and devoted helpmeet for the rest of her life. Beesley, the son of a survivor of the <i>Titanic</i> (Lawrence Beesley, author of <span class="italic">The Loss of the &#145;Titanic&#146;</span>, and later a consultant on the film <span class="italic">A Night to Remember</span>), was a pacifist, so the couple decided to leave for the United States as the Second World War loomed. In January 1939 they left their cottage, The Barretts, at Finchingfield in Essex, in the care of the impresario Hugh (Binkie) Beaumont, and sailed for New York on the <i>Queen Mary</i> with their pale grey Rolls-Royce and their adored Dalmatian, Pongo. The dog had been a thirty-eighth birthday gift from Alec to Dodie in 1934 when she had jestingly remarked that, since her Regent's Park flat was decorated in fashionable monochrome with white carpets and black curtains, &#145;All I need now is a Dalmatian.&#146; Pongo was destined for immortality as the hero of <span class="italic">The Hundred and One Dalmatians</span> after Dodie's friend Joyce Kennedy, the actress, remarked: &#145;He would make a nice fur coat,&#146; thus unwittingly becoming the prototype for Cruella de Vil.<br>
<br>Dodie and Alec married in Philadelphia in 1940, and spent the next thirteen years in rented houses mostly in Hollywood&#151;Dodie was in constant demand at the film studios, rewriting screenplays&#151;but sometimes in New England. When the war ended, their return home was delayed by her fear of opprobrium for abandoning England in wartime, and by the prospect of quarantining their three Dalmatians. Dodie wrote one new play for Broadway (<span class="italic">Lovers and Friends</span>, 1942) but the principal features of her years in the United States were her journal writing (one million words, mostly agonizing over having left behind her devoted audience); the birth of fifteen puppies in 1942 to her two Californian Dalmatians, Buzz and Folly, an event later incorporated into <span class="italic">The Hundred and One Dalmatians</span> (1956); and her close friendship with two fellow British writers in California, John van Druten and Christopher Isherwood. Dodie became one of the few people to whom Isherwood showed his work in progress. More importantly, she had written her first (and finest) novel, <span class="italic">I Capture the Castle</span> (1949), a captivating story located in a medieval castle she had seen at Wingfield, Suffolk, in 1934, and written in the form of the diary of Cassandra Mortmain, aged seventeen, essentially based on the young Dodie. It was an instant success in the USA and in Britain, and its wit and charm, with its appeal to readers of all ages, has kept it in print ever since: it became a <span class="roman">Virago Modern Classic</span> in 1996 and a Folio edition followed in 1997.<br>
<br>Dodie and Alec returned to their Essex cottage in 1953. Having felt viscerally heartsick with nostalgia for England, Dodie could not have chosen a worse time to relaunch herself as a playwright, when the kitchen sink school of drama was shortly to erupt. She had two flops at the Aldwych: <span class="italic">Letter from Paris</span> (1953; adapted from Henry James's <span class="italic">The Reverberator</span>) and her own adaptation of her novel <span class="italic">I Capture the Castle</span> (1954), which closed in four weeks despite universally rapturous reviews for Virginia McKenna as Cassandra. In a spirit of defiance, Dodie Smith wrote a highly praised children's book, <span class="italic">The Hundred and One Dalmatians</span>, the long-term survival of which was ensured by Disney's subsequent film adaptations: the hugely successful animated feature, <span class="italic">101 Dalmatians</span> (1961), and the 1996 live film of the same title. In the 1960s two new plays (<span class="italic">Amateur Means Lover</span>, and <span class="italic">These People: These Books</span>) failed to come into the West End; a further half-dozen plays were never produced at all. <span class="italic">Dear Octopus</span> enjoyed a West End revival in 1968, with Jack Hulbert and Cicely Courtneidge as the golden wedding couple, on their own golden wedding anniversary.<br>
<br>But Dodie never stopped writing. Always longing to revive her theatrical success, about which she reminisced indefatigably in her diaries, she consoled herself by writing five increasingly fanciful novels: <span class="italic">The New Moon with the Old</span> (1963), <span class="italic">The Town in Bloom</span> (1965), <span class="italic">It Ends with Revelations</span> (1967), <span class="italic">A Tale of Two Families</span> (1970), and <span class="italic">The Girl from the Candle-Lit Bath</span> (1970). She also published two more children's books (<span class="italic">The Starlight Barking</span>, 1967, and <span class="italic">The Midnight Kittens</span>, 1978), as well as four autobiographical volumes: <span class="italic">Look Back with Love</span> (1974; about childhood), <span class="italic">Look Back with Mixed Feelings</span> (1978; about her twenties), <span class="italic">Look Back with Astonishment</span> (1979; about her success in the 1930s), and <span class="italic">Look Back with Gratitude</span> (1985; about America.) Living a hermit-like existence, seeing few friends (among them the actress Gwen Ffrangcon-Davies, and the novelist Julian Barnes, who became her literary executor) Dodie remained alone at her cottage after the death of Alec in September 1987. She died at Finchingfield on 24 November 1990, and was cremated there, leaving an estate valued at &pound;473,833, of which &pound;2000 was willed to the care of Charley, her seventh and last Dalmatian.<br>
