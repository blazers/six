<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Mead,  Richard</span>  (1673&#150;1754), <span class="occ">physician and collector of books and art</span>, was born at Worcester House, Stepney, Middlesex, on 11 August 1673, the eleventh child of thirteen of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18466/', "Matthew Meade (1628/9&#150;1699)")</script>, a nonconforming minister, and his wife, Elizabeth Walton (<i>d</i>. 1707). Matthew Meade had been ejected for nonconformity in 1662, but apparently had a private income. He educated his children at home, hiring John Nesbitt, another dissenter, to tutor them in Latin. Matthew Meade's involvement in the Rye House plot in 1683 led to his temporary exile to the Netherlands, at which time he sent his son Richard to the private school, in Clerkenwell Close, of the dissenter Thomas Singleton, a former second master at Eton. Richard Mead excelled in the classics, and in 1689 he followed his elder brother Samuel (1670&#150;1734) to the University of Utrecht, where he studied with Johann Georg Graevius (1632&#150;1703), a noted scholar of classical culture, whose <span class="italic">Thesaurus antiquitatum Romanorum</span> helped form Mead's taste for collecting antiquities.<h2>
<a name="Earlycareer"></a>Early career</h2>Mead decided to study medicine, and registered on 18 April 1693 at the University of Leiden. It is likely that he arrived in Leiden several months earlier because he became a close acquaintance of Archibald Pitcairne, who had arrived in Leiden as professor in the spring of 1692 and left abruptly in the summer of 1693. Mead lived in Pitcairne's house for a time, along with Hermann Boerhaave, then also a student. Pitcairne's iatromechanics strongly influenced Mead, as his subsequent works in physiology attest, and the two remained friends. Mead also studied botany with Paul Hermann.<br>
<br>Mead left Leiden early in 1695 without taking a degree, and accompanied his brother Samuel, David Polhill, and Thomas Pellett, another medical student, on a tour of Italy. Their first stop was Turin, where a plausible story about Mead (with some variations) later arose. According to the story Mead inquired about the so-called Tabula Isiaca, a bronze tablet inlaid with silver depicting the Egyptian goddess Isis. It had been found in Rome in 1525 and eventually reached Turin, where it was then lost. Mead asked permission to search for it and found it in storage (some versions of the story say he found it in Florence), and it was duly put on exhibit at the royal museum in Turin. Although at the time the tablet was believed to originate in ancient Egypt it has since been proved to be a Roman forgery. The story is notable for indicating Mead's early interest in antiquities.<br>
<br>From Turin the party travelled to Florence and then Padua, where Mead received the degree of MD on 26 August 1695 after a short period of residence. The tour continued to Rome and Naples, and the group returned to England in the summer of 1696. Mead set up a medical practice out of his father's house in Stepney. He did not obtain a licence from the Royal College of Physicians of London, but a dissenting physician in Stepney was probably below the consideration of the college. Certainly Mead made no effort at concealment, and his father, Matthew, who had returned from the Netherlands in 1687, promoted his son's practice to his congregation. In July 1699 Mead married Ruth Marsh (1683&#150;1720), the daughter of a Bristol and London merchant, and his father gave him the Stepney house (which he had been given by the trustees of the Stepney meeting-house). Matthew Meade died on 16 October 1699, and soon after his death Richard Mead left the Stepney meeting-house (of which he was a deacon) and joined the Church of England. Mead had eight children with his wife Ruth, of whom three daughters and a son reached adulthood.<br>
<br>In 1702 Mead published his first work, <span class="italic">A Mechanical Account of Poisons</span>, which fully displayed his commitment to Pitcairne's style of iatromechanics, stating that mathematical learning would soon distinguish a physician from a quack. However, Mead was never known as a mathematician, and his book contained very little mathematical analysis. His emphasis was rather on mechanical chemistry, which explained phenomena in terms of particles of differing sizes and shapes. Mead added an attractive force to this chemistry which he identified with gravity, thus placing himself among the Newtonians. His most original contribution was his discussion of venomous snakes, which had been instigated by his studies with Paul Hermann at Leiden. Mead dissected several vipers and accurately described the mechanism of the fang and its operation. He also confirmed Galen's observation that a puncture wound was necessary for the venom to take effect, in part by swallowing a sample of venom without ill effect. <span class="italic">A Mechanical Account of Poisons</span> also discussed, among other topics, noxious airs, citing the Grotta de' Cani near Naples, which Mead had visited in 1695. For therapies he recommended either a substance to neutralize the excess acidity of the poison or an external stimulant such as a cold bath which would keep the blood moving and prevent the formation of coagulated clusters of blood which he believed caused the symptoms in poisoning cases.<br>
<br>The <span class="italic">Mechanical Account</span> was a success, and it placed Mead at the centre of a highly competitive group of young physicians and natural philosophers who sought the approbation of Isaac Newton. Mead was ambitious, and his combination of Newtonian (but not mathematical) theory, classical allusion, and practical therapies won him attention. He was elected to the Royal Society in 1703, and the <span class="italic">Philosophical Transactions</span> favourably summarized his book. In the same year the <span class="italic">Transactions</span> published his translation of a letter from Giovanni Cosimo Bonomo to Francesco Redi of 1687, in which Bonomo described his discovery of the mite, <i>Acarus</i> or <i>Sarcoptus scabiei</i>, which caused the common skin disease known as scabies or &#145;the itch&#146;.<br>
<br>Mead was elected physician to St Thomas's Hospital in Southwark on 5 May 1703, and left Stepney with his young family to settle in Crutched Friars in the City of London, where he lived until 1711. A hospital physician, while not usually paid, gained clinical experience with a wide variety of patients as well as access to the wealthy and influential individuals who formed the governing board of the hospital and whose patronage could significantly advance a medical practice. At about the same time Mead was appointed one of the readers in anatomy by the London Company of Barber&#150;Surgeons. The readers delivered the lectures which accompanied the annual public dissection for the benefit of the surgical apprentices. Each reader commented upon one part of the body but did not himself perform the dissection. It is not known where Mead might have gained his knowledge of dissection and anatomy. The professorship of anatomy was vacant at Leiden during his time there, but Boerhaave held private dissecting sessions and Mead may have joined him. The readership paid well, and Mead continued in this position until 1715.<br>
<br>Mead continued his efforts in Newtonian physiology with his next publication, <span class="italic">De imperio solis ac lunae in corpora humana et morbis inde oriundis</span> (<span class="italic">On the Influence of the Sun and Moon on Human Bodies and the Diseases Arising Thence</span>), published in 1704. Here Mead joined Hippocratic climatic theory with Newton's theory of the tides, claiming that a tidal flux of the air caused many ailments. This account has variously been termed the last gasp of astrological medicine and one of the first works of Newtonian medicine. The lack of any mathematical foundation makes Mead's claims to Newtonianism unconvincing, but the case histories he cites, many from Pitcairne, are of interest. Mead's puritan upbringing is evident in his accounts of providential interventions in the weather, such as the storms which accompanied Cromwell's death in 1658. This work was also a great success: Halley reprinted it in his <span class="italic">Miscellanea curiosa</span> (1708), and an English translation appeared in 1712.<br>
<br>Mead was elected to the council of the Royal Society in 1705, and again in 1707, serving continually from the latter date until his death nearly half a century later. He was appointed a vice-president by Newton on 17 December 1713. On 4 December 1707 Mead was made DM at Oxford, and the Royal College of Physicians admitted him as a candidate on 25 June 1708. He was elected a fellow on 9 April 1716, the same day as his close friend Dr John Freind, and they &#145;ate sweet cakes together as censors&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>). Despite their differences in politics, for Mead was as strong a whig as Freind was a tory, they remained the best of friends, sharing interests in classical literature as well as in Newtonian natural philosophy.<br>
<br>As Mead progressed in his profession his residence moved west: from Stepney to Crutched Friars, and then to Austin Friars in 1711, where he occupied the house of the recently deceased physician George Howe, inheriting many of his patients. Here he made the acquaintance of John Radcliffe, one of the most successful physicians of his generation. An anecdote relates that Radcliffe, encountering Mead reading Hippocrates in Greek, commented, &#145;When I am dead, you will occupy the throne of physic in this town,&#146; Mead is said to have replied, &#145;Sir, your empire, like Alexander's, will be divided among many successors&#146;  (Macmichael, 23), an answer which well pleased Radcliffe and which reveals something of Mead's character. While Radcliffe prided himself on his lack of theory, on the model of Sydenham, Mead had made his mark in part by writing about theory. None the less, Radcliffe chose Mead as his successor, bequeathing to him not only his gold-headed cane but his house in Bloomsbury and his substantial medical practice. Mead attended Queen Anne on her deathbed in 1714 and accurately predicted her imminent demise, although this was not a politically expedient view. Radcliffe died a few months later. Mead resigned as physician at St Thomas's on 5 January 1715 and was named a governor. While at St Thomas's he had devised a method of tapping for dropsy which involved applying pressure to the abdomen while tapping occurred. This greatly reduced the incidence of syncope during the procedure. Mead's patients included Gilbert Burnet, Robert Harley, and the princess of Wales.<h2>
<a name="Attheheightofhisprofession"></a>At the height of his profession</h2>The publication in 1717 of John Freind's <span class="italic">Commentarium novem de febribus</span> (<span class="italic">Nine Commentaries on Fevers</span>), appended to his edition of Hippocrates' <span class="italic">De morbis popularis</span>, engaged Mead in a long controversy about smallpox therapy. Freind included a letter from Mead about his use of purgatives in confluent smallpox. Mead's letter was attacked by John Woodward in his <span class="italic">State of Physick and Diseases</span> (1718), leading to a pamphlet war which lasted for several years. Mead did not write any pamphlets, but he was ably supported by Freind and others. According to <span class="italic">Mist's Journal</span> for 13 June 1719 Mead and Woodward came to blows on the night of 10 June in front of Gresham College. Various accounts of the so-called duel exist, and Woodward and Mead are said to be the figures by the gate of the stable yard in the engraving by Vertue of Gresham College in John Ward's <span class="italic">Lives of the Professors of Gresham College</span> (1740). Mead maintained a lifelong enmity toward Woodward.<br>
<br>Mead's wife, Ruth, died on 31 January 1720, and shortly thereafter Mead moved to a house on Great Ormond Street in Bloomsbury later occupied by the Hospital for Sick Children. He lived in this house for the rest of his life. He also owned property in Chelsea, and is said to have lived between 1715 and 1718 at Gorges House there.<br>
<br>The outbreak of plague in Marseilles in 1719 led Craggs, the secretary of state, to ask Mead to draw up a statement concerning its prevention. Mead's <span class="italic">Short Discourse Concerning Pestilential Contagion and the Methods to be used to Prevent it</span> appeared in 1720, and seven editions appeared within a year. An enlarged eighth edition was published in 1722. Mead argued that plague was contagious, caused by a &#145;volatile active spirit&#146;  (p. 11) which acted chemically to corrupt the blood. He had no notion of living contagious particles, however. He recommended separating the sick from the well (against the usual practice of quarantining entire households), and noted especially the role of soft goods such as fabrics in the transmission of plague, which would indeed provide transport for plague-carrying fleas. Mead's <span class="italic">Discourse</span> was credited with alleviating local panic, and in 1721 he, Sloane, and Arbuthnot were ordered by the privy council to investigate measures to be taken in case of an outbreak of plague.<br>
<br>Mead also joined Sloane in 1721 to conduct trials of smallpox inoculation among some condemned prisoners at Newgate. While Sloane instigated the trials Mead enthusiastically supported them, and described them two decades later in his <span class="italic">De variolis et morbillis liber</span> (<span class="italic">Discourse on the Small-Pox and Measles</span>, 1747). Mead was especially interested in the Chinese method of introducing the infectious material nasally, and this was tried on one prisoner. All recovered, and this success helped to establish the practice of inoculation, although it remained controversial.<br>
<br>In the spring of 1723 John Freind was confined to the Tower for his role in the Atterbury plot, and Mead was instrumental in securing his release (according to one story, by threatening to withhold his services from Robert Walpole). Mead brought Freind, while in prison, a copy of Daniel LeClerc's history of medicine, which inspired Freind to write his own history. He is said to have presented Freind upon his release with the fees he had received from Freind's patients, although the sum usually given of &pound;5000 is wildly exaggerated, since Freind had been in prison for only three months. Mead also helped obtain a pardon for George Kelly, an Irish clergyman implicated in the plot. Despite his whig politics Mead seems to have enjoyed aiding the opposition; he also helped the nonjuror Thomas Hearne regain his position at Oxford, and he helped secure the release from prison of Pitcairne's son, who had participated in the 1715 Jacobite rising.<br>
<br>On 18 October 1723 Mead delivered the Harveian oration at the Royal College of Physicians, combining his antiquarian and medical interests in an address on the status of physicians in ancient Greece and Rome. Mead, himself very conscious of status, concluded that physicians held a high place in ancient society. This view was attacked by Conyers Middleton, and a pamphlet war ensued, with John Ward defending Mead's position. Mead was elected a censor of the College of Physicians in 1716, 1719, and 1724.<br>
<br>Mead married Anne, daughter of Sir Rowland Alston of Odell, Bedfordshire, on 14 August 1724. The union produced no children. Mead was now at the height of his profession. He was named a governor to Bridewell, Bethlem, and St Bartholomew's hospitals in 1720, and was instrumental in persuading Thomas Guy, one of his patients, to use some of his enormous profits from South Sea stock to endow a new hospital. In 1727 Mead was appointed physician to George II, and in the same year he attended Sir Isaac Newton in his final illness. Mead's income surpassed even that of his mentor Radcliffe, amounting to &pound;5000 or &pound;6000 a year. From his post at a coffee house&#151;usually Batson's near the Royal Exchange, or Tom's on Great Russell Street&#151;he received reports in the mornings from apothecaries about patients, and wrote up prescriptions which the apothecaries would then fill. This service was by no means uncommon among physicians but it subjected Mead to some criticism and satire. At other times of the day he might be found at Rawthmell's Coffee House in Henrietta Street, Covent Garden, or Child's in St Paul's Churchyard. He owned a coach, and his wealth is indicated by the six horses he used to drive out to his country house near Windsor. Through his second wife he also had possession of Harrold Hall in Bedfordshire.<h2>
<a name="Meadaspatronandcollector"></a>Mead as patron and collector</h2>To his contemporaries Mead was as well known a patron and collector as he was a physician. He subscribed to an enormous number of books from 1710 onward, including such varied titles as Burnet's <span class="italic">History of his Own Time</span> (1724), Henry Pemberton's <span class="italic">View of Sir Isaac Newton's Natural Philosophy</span> (1728), John Quinton's <span class="italic">Treatise of Warm Bath Water</span> (1733), and John Ward's <span class="italic">Lives of the Professors of Gresham College</span> (1740; Mead took ten copies, five on large paper). A number of books were dedicated to Mead, including William Cheselden's <span class="italic">Anatomy of the Humane Body</span> (1713), Michael Maittaire's edition of Lucretius (1713), William Baxter's <span class="italic">Glossarum antiquitatum Britannicarum</span> (1719), John Blackbourne's edition of the works of Francis Bacon (1730), a volume of Eleazar Albin's <span class="italic">Natural History of Birds</span> (1738), and Robert James's <span class="italic">Medicinal Dictionary</span> (1742). Others were dedicated to him without his consent in the hope of gaining his patronage, which he dispensed generously to natural philosophers, naturalists, and antiquarians. He sponsored the elaborate new edition of William Cowper's <span class="italic">Myotomia reformata</span> which appeared in 1724 with a new introduction by Mead and Henry Pemberton who explained muscular motion in Newtonian terms. Hearne called it &#145;the most beautiful book &hellip; ever printed in England&#146;  (<span class="italic">Remarks and Collections of Thomas Hearne</span>, 7, Oxford Historical Society, 48, 1906, 271). Mead gave financial assistance to the naturalists George Edwards and Mark Catesby, the latter of whom named a flower, the <i>Dodecathon meadia</i> or American cowslip, after him.<br>
<br>Mead championed the invention for ventilating ships of Samuel Sutton over the rival invention of Stephen Hales and read a paper on Sutton's principles to the Royal Society on 11 February 1742. Mead wrote his <span class="italic">Discourse on the Scurvy</span> (1749) to support Sutton's cause. Mead based much of his argument on the evidence of Lord Anson's voyage around the world between 1740 and 1744, during which 90 per cent of his men succumbed to scurvy, which Mead attributed in part to corrupted air. Mead's work was soon superseded by James Lind's <span class="italic">Treatise of the Scurvy</span> (1753). While Sutton's invention enjoyed the favour of the navy for a time, Hales's invention ultimately was adopted in 1756.<br>
<br>Mead sponsored the printer Samuel Palmer to write his <span class="italic">History of Printing</span> (1732), and between 1722 and 1733 he provided the means to publish a complete edition of Jacques-Auguste de Thou's <span class="italic">Historia sui temporis</span>. He supported the research in France of the Jacobite exile Thomas Carte, purchasing Carte's materials from him in 1724, and hired the printer Samuel Buckley to edit and print de Thou's work, which appeared in seven folio volumes in 1733. Mead also assisted the Shakespearian scholar Lewis Theobald and the physician Samuel Jebb, whose edition of the works of Roger Bacon appeared in 1733, as well as the forger William Lauder, who wrote Mead a letter defending himself on 9 April 1751. Mead was also one of the subscribers to the Society for the Promotion of Learning, founded in 1736 to assist in the publication of scholarly works deemed unprofitable by publishers. He was a noted scholar of the classics, and Richard Bentley, his closest friend after Freind, often consulted him about classical texts. John Davies DD bequeathed to Mead his papers on Cicero, which Mead gave to Bentley's nephew Thomas to complete an edition of the <span class="italic">Offices</span>. The papers were destroyed in an accidental fire at Thomas Bentley's lodgings, as Mead stated in a letter prefixed to the third edition of Davies's <span class="italic">Cicero de natura deorum</span>. Mead also sponsored the translation from Arabic into Latin of the treatise on smallpox of the medieval Arabic physician Rhazes 
    (Abu Bakr Muhammad ibn Zakariyya al-Razi 850&#150;923)
  . He procured a copy of the Arabic version from Boerhaave in Leiden, and Thomas Hunt, the professor of Arabic and Hebrew at Oxford, edited the final translation from two versions by Solomon Negri (a Greek Orthodox priest from Damascus) and John Gagnier (reader in Arabic at Oxford). The essay was appended to Mead's <span class="italic">De variolis et morbillis liber</span>.<br>
<br>A number of individuals, including Martin Folkes and Nathaniel Cotton, consulted Mead about antiquities. Mead was a major collector of both books and art. He had a separate room built at the foot of the garden of his house on Great Ormond Street which housed his library and collections, which were among the largest of his time. The room also served as a meeting place for physicians, natural philosophers, and men of letters. Mead had an extensive collection of antique medals and coins (some of which had provided evidence for his Harveian oration), as well as other antiquities, including an Egyptian mummy and other Egyptian and Etruscan pieces. His collection of antique paintings had been acquired at great expense, the most famous being the <span class="italic">Court of Augustus</span>, which had been brought to Mead from Rome by Sir Alexander Dick in 1737. In keeping with the style of the cabinets of the time, Mead's collection also included a miscellaneous assortment of fossils, scientific instruments, anatomical specimens, and curiosities.<br>
<br>Mead owned about 150 paintings, including landscapes by Rembrandt, Claude Lorrain, and Brueghel, and architectural pictures by Nicolas Poussin and Canaletto. He had many portraits, including the physicians Mayerne (by Rubens) and Vesalius (by Titian), scientists such as Boyle (by Kerseboom) and Halley (by Kneller), and the famous Holbein portrait of Erasmus, as well as portraits of contemporary men of letters, including Swift and Richardson. His collection of miniatures was especially noted. He also owned thousands of engravings and drawings by such artists as Durer, Holbein, Michelangelo, and Raphael, as well as Hogarth and Vertue. Mead was a patron of art as well as a collector. He commissioned the bust of William Harvey by Peter Scheemakers, later displayed at the Royal College of Physicians, and the French artist Watteau, who came to consult Mead in the early 1720s, painted for him <span class="italic">L'amour paisible</span> and <span class="italic">Italian Comedians</span>. Mead opened his gallery to interested artists to copy, and he even loaned paintings for copying. In this era before public galleries Mead played an important role in the advancement of art. He was one of the promoters of the Foundling Hospital, which housed the first public gallery in London in the 1740s.<br>
<br>Mead's collection of books and manuscripts was second only to that of Hans Sloane. His books numbered some 10,000 volumes, including 146 incunabula and many fine bindings. His library was especially rich in the classics and in works of medicine and natural philosophy. Mead aimed to find the best editions of canonical works. One example is his fine collection of medical works, dominated by anatomy. This included a first edition on vellum of Vesalius's <span class="italic">Epitome</span> of his <span class="italic">De fabrica</span> (1543), which is now in the British Library, as well as several editions of Mondino de' Luzzi and Berengario da Carpi. Mead possessed a very rare copy of Michael Servetus's <span class="italic">Christiani restitutio</span> (1553), in which Servetus explained the pulmonary circulation. Mead gave this book to M. de Boze, secretary of the Academy of Inscriptions and Belles-Lettres in Paris, with whom he shared a long correspondence; de Boze gave him in turn some medals. The book, one of only three copies in the world, is now at the Biblioth&egrave;que Nationale in Paris. Mead's anatomy books also included an extensive collection of seventeenth- and eighteenth-century authors. He also owned most of the canonical works of the scientific revolution. Mead collected books on fine art and architecture, and owned a second-folio Shakespeare which had once belonged to Charles I (and is now in the Queen's Library at Windsor). However, he was little interested in contemporary fiction, and only one novel, Fielding's <span class="italic">Tom Jones</span> (1749), was in his collection. He owned a fine collection of Latin and Greek manuscripts which he sold to his friend Anthony Askew for &pound;500.<h2>
<a name="Familylifeandfinalyears"></a>Family life and final years</h2>When Mead's first wife, Ruth, died in 1720 he was left a widower with six children in their teens or early twenties: four daughters, Sarah, Bathsheba, Elizabeth, and an unnamed daughter who died of smallpox in 1725 aged fifteen; and two sons, John and Richard. John died in the Canary Islands in 1721. Another son had died in 1716. Sarah Marsh Mead, the eldest daughter, born about 1702, married the physician Edward Wilmot. Probably through the influence of Mead he was named a physician to St Thomas's in 1729. They had three children. Sarah Wilmot died on 11 September 1785, aged eighty-three. The second daughter, Bathsheba, married Charles Bertie of Uffington, Lincolnshire, and had four children; she died before 1754. The youngest daughter, Elizabeth, born about 1705, also married a physician, Frank Nicholls. They had five children. Elizabeth Nicholls was still alive in 1798, aged ninety-two; her grandson was John Nicholls, the literary historian. Little is known about Mead's son Richard. <span class="italic">Biographia Britannica</span> stated that he inherited &pound;30,000 from his uncle, Samuel Mead, who died in 1734, but this is not corroborated by Samuel Mead's will. Richard did receive an income of &pound;800 per annum from the estate of Sir Thomas Reeves, lord chief justice of the common pleas. The younger Richard Mead married Anne, daughter of William Gore of Tring, Hertfordshire, in 1741. They had a daughter in 1742 who did not reach adulthood, and he died in 1762 without heirs.<br>
<br>Mead wrote little in the later 1720s and 1730s, but in the 1740s he seems to have been compelled to establish his intellectual legacy. He rewrote many of his earlier works, discarding the Newtonianism of attracting particles in favour of the new Newtonian orthodoxy of ethers. New works in this period included the books on smallpox and scurvy already mentioned. He also published in 1749 <span class="italic">Medica sacra</span>, a commentary on diseases in the <span class="roman">Bible</span>, which he explained in naturalistic rather than supernatural terms. From the intense puritan piety of his youth Mead seems to have travelled to a more deistic religion. His later edition of <span class="italic">De imperio solis ac lunae</span> omits mention of the storms on Cromwell's death or any supernatural intervention. Mead's final work, <span class="italic">Monita et praecepta medica</span> (1751) consisted of aphorisms drawn from his medical practice. Mead did not keep detailed case records, and while celebrated in its time, the book's lack of specificity makes it less interesting now.<br>
<br>Mead was visibly declining in health by the early 1750s, as he neared eighty. He outlived many of his friends and contemporaries, including Freind, Arbuthnot, and Bentley. He took to his bed on 11 February 1754 and died on 16 February in his house on Great Ormond Street, of unknown causes, but without visible pain. On 23 February Mead was laid to rest in the Middle Temple vault of the Temple Church, next to his brother Samuel. His son Richard erected a monument to him in the north aisle of Westminster Abbey, consisting of a bust of the doctor by Scheemakers above a long Latin epitaph by John Ward.<h2>
<a name="Legacy"></a>Legacy</h2>In the last years of his life rumours circulated that Mead was in financial difficulties, and the sale of his ancient manuscripts to Askew only fanned the flames of rumour. Although his income during the years of his greatest success was high, he was known for his extravagance, both as a patron and in his household: Horace Walpole claimed that Mead spent &pound;70 a week on his table. His charities were also notable. Mead's financial legacy was less than might have been expected for someone of his eminence. His will, written on 16 August 1753 and proved on 26 February 1754, is relatively modest in its bequests. Mead's widow, Anne, is given &pound;5000, some plate, jewels, portraits, and household goods. A few particular books and manuscripts are bestowed on Mead's son, his son-in-law Nicholls, and grandson Robert Wilmot, and the younger Richard Mead is given the use of the house at Windsor and its contents. He set up modest trust funds for the benefit of his Mead, Nicholls, and Wilmot grandchildren, and directed that a debt owed him by his third son-in-law, Charles Bertie, become, if paid, a trust fund for the Bertie children. But most of Mead's assets were in his collections. Unlike Sloane, to whom he is often compared, Mead desired that his collections be scattered. The auction of his goods over several weeks in 1754&#150;5 was a major event. The books were auctioned in November 1754 and April 1755, and the catalogue, <span class="italic">Bibliotheca Meadiana</span>, is itself an important source for Mead and for eighteenth-century collecting. Bidders came from across Europe; Louis XV of France acquired Mead's copy of the 1469 Pliny <span class="italic">Historia naturalis</span>. Anthony Askew purchased many volumes. The book collection sold for over &pound;5500, and the pictures, medals, and antiquities (catalogued in <span class="italic">Museum Meadianum</span>), auctioned at the same time but in a different location, produced almost &pound;11,000. When Mead's debts were paid he left a total of about &pound;20,000 to his son Richard&#151;a handsome sum, but not a fabulous one.<br>
<br>Samuel Johnson said of Mead that he &#145;lived more in the broad sunshine of life than almost any man&#146;. He had many friends; Woodward, his chief antagonist, was known to be a contentious person, and although Mead disliked George Cheyne, his enmity was not returned. Mead was the subject of satires and pamphlets, but this was itself an indication of his fame. A popular practitioner in an age when bedside manner was at least as valuable as medicines, he was successful both professionally and financially. He loved the life of the intellect, and relished books and pictures and learned conversation. Mead was a good classical scholar but was less skilled in natural philosophy. His practical works, such as the <span class="italic">Short Discourse Concerning Pestilential Contagion</span>, are clear and straightforward in advice, but muddled in theory, while his purely theoretical works are highly derivative. Mead was very ambitious, and sought to enter the community of Newtonians as a way to advance his career. His stratagem worked, but he did not leave a lasting intellectual legacy as a medical theorist. Mead's main legacy in the eighteenth century was as a collector, an activity perfectly suited to his temperament.<br>
