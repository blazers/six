<span class="headword">White,  John</span>  (1575&#150;1648), <span class="occ">clergyman and promoter of colonization</span>, was born on 6 January 1575 in the manor house of Stanton St John, Oxfordshire, the second son of John White (<i>d</i>. 1618), yeoman, and Isabel, daughter of John Bawle of Lichfield, Staffordshire. He had four sisters and two brothers, the eldest of whom was Josiah White (1573&#150;1622), rector of Hornchurch, Essex, from 1611 to 1622. The family leased the manor of Stanton St John from New College, Oxford, through the favour of an uncle, Dr Thomas White (<i>d</i>. 1588), the warden of New College. Following family tradition, John was educated at Winchester College from 1587 to 1593 and at New College, Oxford. Elected a fellow in 1595 he graduated BA in 1597, and proceeded MA in 1601. Remaining in residence he took holy orders and was appointed rector of Holy Trinity, Dorchester, Dorset, a parish which also incorporated St Peter's, in November 1605. In the following year he married Ann Burges of Peterborough. White was associated with Dorchester for over forty years and if his remaining sermons display a distinct Calvinistic streak he none the less remained a conforming minister of the Church of England, holding traditional views on the nature of divinely appointed authority. Even though he attempted to conduct his religious services within the letter of the law and continued to wear a surplice into the 1640s White became an important figure in the puritan transatlantic network which opposed the religious reforms of Archbishop Laud. His successful attempt to reform Dorchester, a sleepy backwater with something of an unsavoury reputation, eventually won him the title of the Patriarch of Dorchester.<br>
<br>Following the disastrous fire of 1613, which destroyed more than 170 dwellings, White admonished his Dorchester parishioners to transform their ways, reject mere material success, and help the poor. Supported by the local corporation and consistent voluntary financial contributions from his flock he remodelled the town into a well-ordered, godly commonwealth. At the centre of his plans was the creation of a workhouse, a vocational institution which both educated and put the youth of the town to work producing cloth. From its profits the town created a public brewhouse, completed in 1622, which not only regulated the town's drink trade, but also helped finance future reforms; a free school (of which White became a supervisor); the distribution of charity at Christmas; the repair of public streets; and in 1631 the creation of a town library. Indeed, the practical benefits of White's reforms were particularly evident in 1623 when Dorchester suffered another fire, following which the homeless received speedy relief. On the whole a popular minister he regularly visited his parishioners in their homes, lectured three times a week, and on Fridays publicly worked his way methodically through the <span class="roman">Bible</span>. This took him six years, after which he started over again. His programme also transcended the walls of Dorchester itself for in March 1624 he presided over the inception of the unincorporated Dorchester Company, an enterprise aimed at creating a godly colony in America.<br>
<br>Between 1621 and 1623 the number of fishing ships leaving west country ports for New England increased fourfold and White's scheme suggested planting a fishing station in America to both facilitate the trade as well as spread the Word to Native Americans. Consequently, in 1622, Richard Bushrod, a wealthy Dorchester merchant, obtained in his name and for his associates, a fishing licence from the Council for New England. In 1623 another White associate, Sir William Erle, a member of the Virginia Company, obtained a patent for a plantation and ships were sent over in 1624 and 1625. By 1626, however, it was clear that the Dorchester Company, like many similar ventures, was failing. Despite setbacks a permanent settlement was established at Cape Ann, and some colonists stayed on and eventually moved with their governor, Richard Conant, to Naumkeag, renamed Salem in 1629.<br>
<br>Together with a few other members of the Dorchester Company, White kept the colonists supplied and looked to his puritan brethren in London for support. By the time of the creation of the New England Company in March 1628 he had become more interested in piety than profit, viewing a future, successful Massachusetts colony as a safe haven for the increasingly persecuted puritan clergy. When the Gorges family challenged the legality of the New England Company's patent another John White (1590&#150;1645), the London lawyer for the Winthrop family, undertook the complex legal business which transformed the New England Company into the Massachusetts Bay Company by royal charter on 4 March 1629. Continuing to play a conspicuous role in the success of Massachusetts, the Patriarch helped finance individual immigration and recruited the west country conforming puritans who left England in the <i>Mary and John</i> in March 1630. On the eve of the more famous Winthrop migration, in April 1630, White signed with other puritan leaders the humble request, a conciliatory document which proclaimed their loyalty to the mother church. It was published in May 1630 and incorporated by White in his model promotional tract <span class="italic">The Planter's Plea of the Grounds for Plantations Examined</span>. During the famine of 1631 he managed to keep the fledgeling colony supplied with grain and if his role in this project has often been underrated his activities had not escaped the attention of Archbishop Laud.<br>
<br>Under White's leadership Dorchester became a leading centre in the resistance to the high-church religious policies of Charles I. White often organized special prayer meetings, petitions, and the collection of funds to support the cause of international protestantism and he was especially prominent in collecting for the Feoffees for Impropriations, a London-based puritan corporation which hoped to transform the Church of England from within by a preaching ministry. Laud viewed all such activities as undermining both church and royal authority and during his campaign to purge the puritan clergy from the pulpit White was increasingly watched after 1630. His opposition to Arminianism, the new ceremonies, and especially to the reading of the <span class="roman">Book of Sports</span> (which advocated leisure pastimes on Sundays) in church led to White's papers being seized, his finances being investigated, and in 1635 to his prosecution by the high commission. Although the charges against him were dropped his activities, especially after Dorchester's vocal opposition to the collection of ship money in 1637, were increasingly scrutinized.<br>
<br>During the final crisis which led to the outbreak of civil war Dorchester became increasingly puritan, its militia refusing to muster in support of Charles's campaign against the presbyterian Scots. When hostilities between the king and parliament finally broke out in August 1642 the town collected &pound;200 to support parliament. Spurred on by White's sermons Dorchester raised forces in its defence and the corporation pledged support for the parliamentary cause. Yet in August 1643 Dorchester ignominiously surrendered without a fight to royalist forces under Lord Caernarvon. White, who had compounded his notoriety in royalist eyes by his election to the assembly of divines, had fled and his study and papers were pillaged by cavalry under Prince Maurice. In a later royalist occupation the brewhouse itself was destroyed by troops under Lord Goring.<br>
<br>The assembly of divines first met under the chairmanship of William Twisse in July 1643, and during its first week of deliberation White was elected one of two assessors to assist the prolocutor. Charged by parliament to work out a practical religious settlement under the solemn league and covenant with its Scots presbyterian allies, as well as establishing a new form of church government on the basis of scriptural evidence alone, White came to play a leading role in its deliberations. An upholder of the notions of a truly national church he served on two of the assembly's important committees and was appointed minister to St Mary Savoy. He was later appointed rector of Lambeth in April 1645. Although sympathetic to suggested Calvinistic reforms he remained a voice for conservatism within the assembly and usually allied himself with the presbyterians against the growing, more radical independents. On 26 November 1645 he delivered a sermon in Westminster Abbey on the text of <span class="roman">Daniel</span> 9: 15 which called for the creation of a fund from church lands to support exhibitions for needy university students, later published as <span class="italic">The Troubles of Jerusalems Restauration</span> (1646). In increasing ill health he petitioned parliament to relieve him of his duties in May 1646, and having declined the candidature of the vacant wardenship of New College, Oxford, returned to Dorchester in November that year.<br>
<br>In the aftermath of the first civil war White no longer commanded the respect within Dorchester he had once enjoyed and his conservatism often brought him into conflict with religious radicals. In a sermon at St Peter's attended by the whole town in March 1647 he warned his parishioners against what he perceived to be the rising tide of heresy, and he later published a tract which instructed them how to continue in a moral, godly life, <span class="italic">The Way to the Tree of Life</span> (1647). Up until his death on 21 July 1648 at Dorchester he worked upon his reflections on <span class="roman">Genesis</span>, later published by his son John as <span class="italic">A Commentary upon the First Three Chapters of the First Book of Moses called Genesis</span> (1656). In his will he left the bulk of his small estate to his youngest son, Nathaniel, who served as a captain in the parliamentary cavalry during the civil war. His marriage also produced two further sons and two daughters. He was buried under the south porch of St Peter's on 24 July, and a monument was finally erected to White's memory in 1902. A modest, pleasant man who largely accepted the teachings of the established church, he played an important role, without ever setting foot there, in the successful settlement of puritan Massachusetts.<br>
