<span class="headword">Brabazon,  Reginald</span>, twelfth earl of Meath  (1841&#150;1929), <span class="occ">politician and philanthropist</span>, was born on 31 July 1841 in a house near Belgrave Square, London, the second son of William Brabazon (1803&#150;1887), styled Lord Brabazon and from 1851 eleventh earl of Meath, and his wife, Harriot (1811&#150;1898), the second daughter of Sir Richard Brooke, sixth baronet, and his wife, Harriot Cunliffe. His elder brother, Jacques le Normand, died of diphtheria in 1844, near Naples, but Reginald survived and, as Lord Brabazon, was educated from 1851 to 1854 at a private school at Whitnash, near Leamington Spa, before attending Eton College (1854&#150;9). The Spartan regime at Eton is recalled in his autobiography, <span class="italic">Memories of the Nineteenth Century</span> (1923), which tells of a master who accused boys of &#145;spinelessness&#146; for brushing snow off their knees, pointing out that, if their forefathers had &#145;minded a little snow&#146;, then Canada would not have been added to the empire. On leaving school he went to learn German from 1860 to 1861 in B&uuml;ckeburg, near Hanover, and in 1863 passed into the Foreign Office as a clerk by competitive examination.<br>
<br>On 7 January 1868 Brabazon married Lady Mary Jane Maitland [<a name="cosubject_47582"></a><span class="headword">Mary Jane Brabazon</span>, countess of Meath  (1847&#150;1918)]. The daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17837/', "Thomas Maitland, eleventh earl of Lauderdale (1803&#150;1878)")</script>, and his wife, Amelia (<i>d</i>. 1890), the daughter of William Young, she was born on 15 March 1847. The marriage produced four sons and two daughters. Brabazon moved into the diplomatic service, and his first appointment to the embassy in Berlin (1868&#150;70), during the period of the Franco-Prussian War, led to his alienation from Germany. He also served at The Hague (1870) and in Paris (1871&#150;3), before abandoning diplomacy, at the insistence of his in-laws, on being posted as second secretary to the &#145;remote&#146; outpost of Athens. Brabazon remained unemployed without pay, at the disposal of the diplomatic service, until he finally resigned in 1877. He and his wife went to live at Rivermead, Sunbury, Middlesex, in 1873 and decided to devote their prodigious energies and enthusiasms to &#145;the consideration of social problems and the relief of human suffering&#146;  (Brabazon, <span class="italic">Memories of the Nineteenth Century</span>, 201). Brabazon embarked on a career of public philanthropy that was to span several decades, from the time of the handsome, black-bearded aristocrat of the 1870s to the bald, white-bearded, benevolent Santa Claus of the 1920s.<br>
<br>In 1874 Brabazon became honorary secretary of the Hospital Saturday Fund Committee and started the Dublin Hospital Sunday movement, and in 1879 became the first chairman of the Young Men's Friendly Society, later the Church of England's Men's Society. In 1882 he founded the Metropolitan Gardens Association, of which he was chairman until his death, but it was as an alderman of the London county council (1889&#150;92, 1898&#150;1901) and first chairman of its parks committee that London is indebted to him for the preservation of so many of its open spaces, and for parks, gardens, and playgrounds covering thousands of acres, the lungs of the metropolis. Lady Brabazon not only supported her husband's schemes but also devoted her own time and money to philanthropic endeavours, such as the Workhouse Concert Society. In 1885 she set up the Ministering Children's League, whose members pledged to help those in suffering by doing at least one kind deed every day.<br>
<br>On 7 January 1887 Brabazon was invited to speak on the National Association for Promoting State-Directed Colonization, begun in 1884, of which he was both chairman and president, to a meeting held in Clerkenwell, London, under the hostile auspices of the Social Democratic Federation. The working-class audience was ready for &#145;a warm time with a real live Lord&#146; and his speech was frequently interrupted, one man shouting, &#145;I should like to cut off your head&#146;, to which he replied, &#145;If they could prove to him that cutting off his head would save the starving poor, he was quite willing that it should be cut off&#146;  (Brabazon, <span class="italic">Memories of the Nineteenth Century</span>, 232&#150;4). In May 1887, on his father's death, he succeeded to the title as the twelfth earl and inherited 14,717 acres, along with Killruddery, near Bray, co. Wicklow, Ireland, and Eaton Court in Herefordshire with 695 acres.<br>
<br>Lord Meath, an ardent Conservative, Unionist, and imperialist, began to promote the movement for the recognition of an empire commemoration day, with which his name is chiefly associated, after reading in 1896 of a ceremony in Hamilton, Ontario, at which the British flag was hoisted and children sang the national anthem. The first public meeting to promote the idea of celebrating Queen Victoria's birthday, 24 May, as &#145;Empire day&#146; did not take place until 24 May 1904, but four years later official British recognition of such a day was turned down in the Commons by a 68-vote majority, the figures being received with loud Irish nationalist and Labour cheers. Meath succeeded in obtaining British government support for Empire day only in 1916, a decade after it had become a statutory holiday in most of the dominions; the war against Germany, as much as his incessant propaganda efforts, brought final recognition. In 1922, a year after his retirement from active involvement, Empire day became affiliated to the Royal Colonial Institute, and 80,000 schools throughout the empire were said to participate.<br>
<br>While campaigning for Empire day, Meath was also a zealous supporter of Lord Roberts's campaign for national military service, had founded the Lads' Drill Association (1899&#150;1906), afterwards incorporated in the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/95555', "National Service League")</script>, and become chairman and president of the Duty and Discipline movement (1912&#150;19), as well as scout commissioner for Ireland (1911&#150;28). Many of these causes are now seen as an establishment-led reaction to the weakening of parental discipline and the questioning of authority in an age of gradual emancipation from Victorian values and domestic tyranny. Meath wrote and edited several books, mostly collections of his articles or essays, promoting the campaigns to which he devoted his time. He died on 11 October 1929 at 40 Eaton Square, the residence in London of his sister Lady Kathleen Brabazon, and was buried at Delgany, co. Wicklow, on 16 October 1929. Lady Meath, who had predeceased him on 4 November 1918, was buried on 7 November at Bray, also in co. Wicklow.<br>
