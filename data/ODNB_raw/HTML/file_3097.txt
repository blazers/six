<span class="headword">Boyce,  Samuel</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1775), <span class="occ">playwright and poet</span>, was originally an engraver, and held subsequently a place in the South Sea House. In 1751 he published <span class="italic">The Friend of Liberty: an Ode, to George Heathcote, Esq.; Late Alderman of the City of London</span>. This was followed by <span class="italic">The Rover, or, Happiness at Last: a Pastoral Drama</span> (in two interludes and in verse), which was published in 1752 but never acted  (Baker, 3.226). In 1755 <span class="italic">An ode to the right honourable the marquis of Hartington, lord lieutenant of the Kingdom of Ireland</span> and <span class="italic">Paris, or, The Force of Beauty: a Poem in Two Cantos</span> were published; both were reprinted in Boyce's <span class="italic">Poems on Several Occasions</span> (1757).<br>
<br>This edition of Boyce's poems was published by subscription; the original subscribers included Miss Fanny Murray, Miss Middleton, Samuel Johnson, and David Garrick. <span class="italic">Poems on Several Occasions</span> has been described as an &#145;extremely uncommon&#146; book  (Williams, 74) and from a bibliophilic point of view the work is of particular interest because of the method of printing and resultant errors in the various print formats. The &#145;Subscriber's list&#146; shows Garrick (whose copy contains an inscription to him from Boyce and to whom two poems are written) as having subscribed for a copy on &#145;Royal Paper&#146;. The printing of the special paper copies before the ordinary ones reverses the common eighteenth-century printing practice. I. A. Williams states that <span class="italic">Poems on Several Occasions</span> is the first definite instance of this occurring in an eighteenth-century text  (ibid., 75). Garrick's large-paper copy was sold after his death and later passed to the Britwell Library  (ibid., 74).<br>
<br>Boyce's title for his collection is an apt one, as the forty-eight poems contained therein reflect a variety of styles and subject matter. Often Boyce frames his poems with classical allusions but his subject is predominantly eighteenth-century culture: in this he is typically Augustan. In &#145;Song&#146; (&#145;The sun in virgin lustre shone&#146;) the classical story of Damon and Sylvia is retold but the sentiments throughout reflect eighteenth-century morality. <span class="italic">Poems on Several Occasions</span> is of interest because of the manner in which the collection articulates eighteenth-century concerns of the day; it reflects contemporary cultural debate and politics, and is peppered with references to the famous.<br>
<br>Dominant themes in the collection include love, which is often represented in a classical pastoral setting and in some poems is yoked to a eulogization of Britishness. The theme of female chastity is wittily expressed in the satiric &#145;Song&#146; (&#145;The wicked wits, as fancy hits&#146;) which reverses the stereotypical anti-woman vein of much early eighteenth-century satire to reveal the double standards in masculine behaviour and contemporary sexual morality:<blockquote>
<div>The muse shall here th' indicated clear,<br>
</div>
<div>And prove the crimes on you<br>
</div> (ll. 11&#150;12)</blockquote>There emerges a strong anti-French sentiment in the collection, clearly represented in a number of poems which reproduce chauvinist clich&eacute;s about the insidious influence of &#145;Gallic&#146; tastes. The eclectic nature of <span class="italic">Poems on Several Occasions</span> is evident in the range of the subject matter which includes humorous commentaries on drunkenness&#151;&#145;Song&#146; (&#145;Push around the brisk glass, I proclaim him an ass&#146;) and &#145;Epigram&#146; (&#145;Quoth Guz to his spouse, with his skin full of beer&#146;). In 1771 Boyce wrote &#145;A New Occasional Prologue&#146; for <span class="italic">Othello</span> produced at Covent Garden  (Stone, 8.1595). He died on 21 March 1775.<br>
