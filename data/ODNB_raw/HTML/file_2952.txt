<span class="headword">Boswell <span class="st"> [Bozwel]</span>,  John</span>  (1698&#150;1757), <span class="occ">author and Church of England clergyman</span>, the son of John Boswell or Bozwel, of Puddletown, Dorset, was descended from a Gloucestershire family, and was born at Dorchester on 23 January 1698. After attending the school at Abbey Milton under the Revd George Marsh, he matriculated at Brasenose College, Oxford, in 1715, but migrated to Balliol, where he proceeded BA in 1720. Before taking his bachelor's degree he acted as tutor to Lord Kinnaird. He was ordained deacon at Oxford and priest at Wells, and in 1727 was presented to the vicarage of St Mary Magdalene, Taunton. He was also, from 1736, prebendary of Wells Cathedral. He proceeded MA at King's College, Cambridge, in 1732.<br>
<br>Boswell's published works reveal him as a vehement tory high-churchman. <span class="italic">A Method of Study</span> (2 vols., 1738&#150;43), written &#145;to assist the poor Clergyman in his studies, and to encourage the young Gentleman to look into books&#146;  (1.iii), commended the influential <span class="italic">Reflections upon Learning</span> (1699) by the nonjuror Thomas Baker and reflected severely upon Paul de Rapin's whiggish <span class="italic">History of England</span> (1726). When John Jones, vicar of Alconbury, revived debate about changes to the Church of England liturgy in 1749, Boswell responded immediately. <span class="italic">Remarks upon a treatise, intituled Free and candid disquisitions relating to the Church of England</span> was a substantial work which appeared in two parts, in 1750 and 1751. In language that frequently recalled the &#145;church in danger&#146; alarms of the Queen Anne period, Boswell rejected arguments for change, contending that the existing prayer book embodied the excellence of primitive liturgical practice and guarded against the puritan impulses that had produced &#145;the dreadful Scene of Misery, which we suffer'd in the last Century&#146;  (<span class="italic">Remarks</span>, 1.75). For similar reasons he justified the restrictions on private conscience imposed by the <span class="roman">Test Act</span>, defended the practice of demanding subscription to the <span class="roman">Thirty-Nine Articles</span> from all clergy, and argued for continuing the frequent public recitation of the Athanasian creed. Like many other high-churchmen of his time, Boswell was devoted to the memory of Charles I. His two-volume study, <span class="italic">The Case of the Royal Martyr Considered with Candour</span>, published posthumously in 1758, provides a remarkable example of the enduring vigour of old high-tory instincts. This book was provoked by two works. The first, <span class="italic">A Letter to a Clergyman Relating to his Sermon on 30 January</span>, was written by George Coade, a wool-stapler of Exeter, and published in 1746; the second, Thomas Birch's <span class="italic">Enquiry</span>, appeared in 1747. Boswell's volumes, which drew heavily from the <span class="italic">Life of James, Duke of Ormonde</span> (1736) by Thomas Carte, the Jacobite historian, provided detailed refutation of old whig claims that Charles I was a tyrant whose disregard for the welfare of his subjects had been demonstrated supremely during the earl of Glamorgan's negotiations with the Irish Catholics in 1645.<br>
<br>Boswell, who never married, died in June 1757. There is a Latin inscription to his memory in the church of St Mary Magdalene, Taunton, where he was buried.<br>
