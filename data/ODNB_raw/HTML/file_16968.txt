<span class="headword">Long, Sir  James</span>, second baronet  (<em>bap. </em>1617, <em>d.</em> 1692), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was the only son of Sir Walter Long (<i>b</i>. in or before 1594, <i>d</i>. 1637) of Draycot Cerne, Wiltshire, and his first wife, Lady Anne Ley (<i>d</i>. 1627), second daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/16619/', "James Ley, first earl of Marlborough")</script>, and nephew of Sir Robert Long, later chancellor of the exchequer to Charles II. He was born at South Wraxall, Wiltshire, and baptized at Bradford-on-Avon on 12 January 1617. He may have travelled in France before being admitted to Lincoln's Inn in 1634. In the following year he was settled with jointure lands at his marriage to a daughter of Sir William Dodington, and at his father's death in 1637 he inherited the bulk of the Wiltshire estate, including Draycot House. His first wife had died by 1640, when he married Dorothy Leach (<i>d</i>. 1710), a daughter of Sir Edward Leach of Shipley, Derbyshire, a master in chancery.<br>
<br>In 1642 Long became a captain in Sir Thomas Glemham's royalist regiment of horse. By 1644 he had risen to the rank of colonel in Sir Francis Dodington's brigade, and in the same year was appointed sheriff of Wiltshire in the king's interest. Early in 1645 he escorted the prince of Wales to Bristol, and was leisurely returning eastwards when, on 12 March 1645, he was overtaken by a superior force of parliamentarians under Waller and Cromwell at Devizes. Retreating to Bath while hotly pursued by Waller, he was intercepted near Potterne by Cromwell, who suddenly appeared before him with an advance guard, and the high thickset hedges prevented his escape. Long was captured and of his 400 horse only some thirty succeeded in getting away. Clarendon ascribed the disaster to Long's &#145;great defect of courage and conduct&#146;  (Clarendon, <span class="italic">Hist. rebellion</span>, 4.12). He was soon exchanged, and in August 1645 captured Chippenham. On 4 May 1649 he was allowed to compound for his estates at the Goldsmiths' Hall, the assessment being fixed at &pound;300. He thereupon paid his fine of &pound;714 and sued out his pardon. Shortly afterwards, or so Aubrey relates, &#145;Oliver, Protector, hawking at Hounslow Heath, discoursing with him, fell in love with his company, and commanded him to weare his sword, and to meet him a hawkeeing, which made the strict cavaliers look on him with an evill eye&#146;  (<span class="italic">Brief Lives</span>, 2.37).<br>
<br>In 1673, by the death of his uncle Sir Robert Long, James succeeded to the baronetcy and estates in Yorkshire. He was admirably adapted for a country gentleman's life, if Aubrey is to be believed; he states that, in addition to his intellectual attainments&#151;recognized by his election as a fellow of the Royal Society in 1663&#151;Long was a &#145;good swordsman, great memorie, great falconer and for horsemanship. For insects exceedingly curious and searching long since in naturall things&#146;. He was also something of an antiquary: in a letter to Aubrey in 1688, preserved in the Bodleian Library, Long describes a number of Roman coins found at Heddington, Wiltshire. In the same year he wrote a short account of his family history, which is preserved in Wotton's <span class="italic">Baronetage</span> (1771). Long often went hawking near Avebury, occasionally in the company of Aubrey, who once noted that &#145;our sport was very good &hellip; but the flight of the falcons was but a parenthesis to the colonell's facetious discourse, who was &#147;tam Marti, tam Mercurio&#148;, and the Muses did accompany him with his hawkes and spaniells&#146;  (<span class="italic">Wiltshire: the Topographical Collections</span>, 315&#150;16). Aubrey avers that Long wrote a great work, the &#145;History and causes of the civill war&#146;, as well as a tract entitled &#145;Examinations of witches at Malmesbury&#146;, but neither work appears to survive. His letters to Aubrey &#145;mention astrology, witchcraft and natural magic; he hoped to combine an account of these with conjectures concerning unicorns and a natural history of animals in a demonstration of God's wisdom in the creation&#146;  (Hunter, 135). In 1690 Edward Wells dedicated to Long his geographical table.<br>
<br>Long represented Malmesbury in the three exclusion parliaments, 1679&#150;81, and again from 1690 until his death. Considered &#145;moderately active&#146; in the 1679 parliaments, he was, by 1681, &#145;clearly an opponent of exclusion&#146;  (Henning, 2.758). By 1688 he gave his opinion in favour of repeal of penal laws and James II's agents reported, and supported, his proposed election for Wiltshire in that year. After his election in 1690 he &#145;was regarded as &#147;doubtful&#148; by the Government&#146;  (Henning, 2.758). He died in London, reportedly of an apoplexy, on the night of 22&#150;23 January 1692. His body was carried to Draycot, where it was buried in the family vault on 3 February.<br>
<br>By his second marriage Long had four daughters and one son, James, who died in his father's lifetime, leaving, by his first marriage to Susan, daughter of Colonel Giles Strangways of Melbury, Dorset, three sons&#151;Robert, Giles, and James&#151;who were successively baronets. James, Long's grandson, became fifth baronet in 1697, and was admitted to Balliol College, Oxford, on 1 February 1699. From 1705 he was MP successively for Chippenham, Wootton Bassett, and Wiltshire, until his death on 16 March 1729. His elder sister was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/16960/', "Ann Long")</script>, friend of Jonathan Swift.<br>
