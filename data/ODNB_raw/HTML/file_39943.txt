<span class="headword">Neagle, Dame  Anna</span> <span class="st"> [<em>real name </em>Florence Marjorie Robertson]</span>  (1904&#150;1986), <span class="occ">actress and film producer</span>, was born in Forest Gate, Essex, on 20 October 1904, the only daughter and youngest of three children of Herbert William Robertson, a captain in the merchant navy, and his wife, Florence Neagle. She was educated at the high school, St Albans, and at Wordsworth's Physical Training College, South Kensington, London. After being a student dance teacher, from 1925 to 1930 she appeared in the chorus of revues produced by Andr&eacute; Charlot and Charles Cochran.<br>
<br>In 1930 she changed her name to Anna Neagle. Her first significant film part was in <span class="italic">Goodnight Vienna</span> (1932), directed by <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/31831/', "Herbert Sydney Wilcox (1890&#150;1977)")</script>, whom she married in 1943. They had no children. Wilcox directed thirty-two films with Neagle. Her first major film success was in <span class="italic">Nell Gwyn</span> (1934), and she gradually became synonymous with the historical picture, especially when Wilcox directed her in <span class="italic">Victoria the Great</span> (1937), an unexpectedly popular and critical success. It won the <span class="italic">Picturegoer</span> gold medal award and the gold cup at the Venice film festival. Neagle and Wilcox went to America to publicize its release and on their return repeated the formula successfully in Technicolor with <span class="italic">Sixty Glorious Years</span> (1938).<br>
<br>Anna Neagle went to America in 1939 and made four films with RKO studios: <span class="italic">Nurse Edith Cavell</span> (1939) and three musical comedies, <span class="italic">Irene</span> (1940), <span class="italic">No, No, Nanette</span> (1940), and <span class="italic">Sunny</span> (1941). She was the first actress to appear on the cover of <span class="italic">Life</span> magazine. On her return to Britain she started work on a film of the life of the aviator Amy Johnson, <span class="italic">They Flew Alone</span> (1941). Her next film was <span class="italic">Yellow Canary</span> (1943), about a Women's Royal Naval Service intelligence worker mistaken for a Nazi spy.<br>
<br>In 1945 Neagle's films became less heroic, and more escapist light entertainment, as she continued to straddle her film career with stage appearances and tours. She appeared in the film <span class="italic">I Live in Grosvenor Square</span> (1945), co-starring Rex Harrison, and went on an Entertainments National Service Association (ENSA) tour in Europe in the play <span class="italic">French without Tears</span>. After the Second World War Neagle starred in a distinctive series of musical comedies with Michael Wilding. The first of the &#145;London series&#146; was <span class="italic">Piccadilly Incident</span> (1946), which won the <span class="italic">Daily Mail</span> national film award, as did its successor, <span class="italic">The Courtneys of Curzon Street</span> (1947). For her performances in both films Neagle received the <span class="italic">Picturegoer</span> gold medal. The third film in the Neagle&#150;Wilding partnership was <span class="italic">Spring in Park Lane</span> (1948).<br>
<br>Aware of her previous success in &#145;biopics&#146;, Herbert Wilcox directed Neagle as Odette Sansom, a Special Operations Executive undercover agent, who had been tortured by the Nazis, in the film <span class="italic">Odette</span> (1950). As a result Neagle was appointed an honorary ensign (1950) of the First Aid Nursing Yeomanry, an appropriate award for an actress who went on to play Florence Nightingale in <span class="italic">The Lady with a Lamp</span> (1951).<br>
<br>In 1957 Anna Neagle produced <span class="italic">These Dangerous Years</span>, starring Frankie Vaughan, and was directed for the first time by a person other than Herbert Wilcox (Cyril Frankel) in <span class="italic">No Time for Tears</span> (1957). After her first box-office flop, <span class="italic">The Lady is a Square</span> (1958), financial problems beset Neagle and Wilcox and her attempt to start a dance school failed. Eventually, however, theatre appearances helped to resuscitate her flagging career.<br>
<br>Neagle was distinctive for her ability to maintain a &#145;regal presence&#146; on screen. She was an &#145;English&#146; beauty with a striking bone structure, who maintained her dancer's figure throughout her life. She could look equally at home in a glamorous ball gown or a practical flying-suit. Despite her variety of parts, her portrayals of heroines firmly placed her as a British icon in a patriotic style of film-making. She was appointed CBE in 1952 and DBE in 1969. She also received the freedom of the City of London (1981) and the order of St John (1981). Her final appearance was as the Fairy Godmother in <span class="italic">Cinderella</span> at the London Palladium that year. Anna Neagle, whose home latterly was at 117B Hamilton Terrace, London, died on 3 June 1986 from breast cancer at a nursing home, Clare House, Oakcroft Road, West Byfleet, Surrey, and was buried in the City of London cemetery, Manor Park, London. A service of thanksgiving was held in Westminster Abbey on 20 October 1986.<br>
