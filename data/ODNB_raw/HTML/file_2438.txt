<span class="headword">Birch,  William Russell</span>  (1755&#150;1834), <span class="occ">enamel painter and printmaker</span>, was born in Warwickshire on 9 April 1755, the son of Thomas Birch, a noted surgeon, and his wife, Mary Russell. After an unsuccessful start at a Latin school he was taken in by a wealthy cousin, William Russell of Birmingham, who soon apprenticed him to the London jeweller and goldsmith Thomas Jeffreys. Six years later he left to study the painstaking art of enamel painting with Henry Spicer.<br>
<br>Specializing in miniature copies after many of the leading artists of the day, including Sir Joshua Reynolds, Birch made his London d&eacute;but at the Society of Artists exhibition of 1775 with two enamels of classical subjects&#151;one a <span class="italic">Head of Psyche</span>, the other <span class="italic">Jupiter and Juno</span>. These were submitted from &#145;Mr Speaker's 11, Henrietta Street, Covent Garden&#146;  (Graves, <span class="italic">Soc. Artists</span>). By 1787 Birch had moved to the more genteel area of Hampstead Heath. Despite having won Society of Artists' awards in both 1784 and 1785 for technical improvements in enamel painting, he evidently preferred to exhibit at the Royal Academy: between 1781 and 1794 he sent forty-one pieces to its annual exhibitions.<br>
<br>About the same time Birch turned his attention to reproductive printmaking, where he was particularly successful in adapting his skills for translating larger works to a smaller scale. This can be seen in a series of thirty-six stipple engravings of landscapes which&#151;despite its very English subject matter&#151;was given the French title <span class="italic">D&eacute;lices de la Grande Bretagne</span> (1788&#150;90). The picturesque quality of these engravings reveals Birch's own particular love of sketching tours in the countryside. Published by Dilly, Edwards, and Manson, <span class="italic">D&eacute;lices de la Grande Bretagne</span> sold for 3 guineas in boards and at 5 guineas for proof impressions. These detailed and delicate plates were successful enough to win 250 subscribers, including royal and literary figures as well as other artists.<br>
<br>The turmoil of the French Revolution and the encouragement of some relatives in Maryland induced William Birch and his son Thomas (1779&#150;1851), who later became a noted marine painter, to emigrate to America in 1794. They immediately settled in Philadelphia, where there was a thriving art market: consequently Birch began to send work to various local exhibitions, among them the Columbianum, the Society of Artists, the Pennsylvania Academy, and the Artists' Fund Society. Together with his son, he worked on an engraved series of <span class="italic">Views in Philadelphia</span> (1800), which remains important as a unique early record of an American city. He also published two views of New York city in 1802 and a subscription series of views of country seats around Philadelphia entitled <span class="italic">The Country Seats of the United States of America</span> (1808). Although he continued to work as a publisher and printmaker, his reputation, in America, was boosted by the nearly sixty enamels and miniatures he produced. Commissioned by a Mr Van Stapborst of the Netherlands in 1796, the most celebrated of these was of George Washington, which was thought to be a good though flattering likeness. Birch was also noted among Philadelphia connoisseurs for his large collection of European prints and paintings, which &#145;enriched Philadelphia's artistic resources&#146;  (<span class="italic">ANB</span>, 803). Such was Birch's success that in 1812 he moved out of town to the country estate of Springland, near Bristol in Philadelphia. He died on 7 August 1834 in Philadelphia.<br>
