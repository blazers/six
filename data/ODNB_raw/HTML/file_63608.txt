<span class="headword">Hague,  William</span>  (<em>c.</em>1840&#150;1899), <span class="occ">architect</span>, was probably born in Cavan Town, co. Cavan, the son of a local builder, also called William Hague, who is otherwise little known, though described in the <span class="italic">Dublin Builder</span> as &#145;an old established and highly respectable builder who has executed most of the principal works in his neighbourhood&#146;  (1 Sept 1863, 146). The young Hague opened his own offices in Dublin in 1861, though his practice was still based on Roman Catholic commissions from his home county, such as the interesting and quirky church at Butlersbridge of 1861. His ambitions registered in his competition entries, including one for the new Church of Ireland cathedral in Cork, of 1862, eventually won by William Burges. While Hague's early training was probably undertaken with his father, he was quickly accepted by the professional establishment, and was elected as a fellow of the Royal Institute of the Architects of Ireland in 1863; he later acted as auditor to the society. He was elected also to the Royal Society of Antiquaries of Ireland in 1864.<br>
<br>In the same year Hague's burgeoning practice gained prestigious success with the award of the first premium in the open competition, against some thirty other entrants, for the new town hall in Sligo, the foundation-stone of which was laid in 1865. Hague's designs displayed a competent understanding of the Ruskinian inspiration found in Deane and Woodward's work of a decade earlier, though much of the decorative carving originally intended remained unexecuted. The building affirmed his command of this type of civic design, but his forte remained church design, almost wholly for Roman Catholic patrons. Hague worked in a competent Gothic style, much indebted, especially in later years, to the work of Pugin and Ashlin. His reliable professionalism, alongside a dry orthodoxy, secured him wide respect in the Roman Catholic establishment, a position assisted no doubt by his marriage to the daughter of the solicitor Vesey Daly (<i>d</i>. 1880), and his service from 1885 as justice of the peace for co. Cavan. Hague's recognition by the Roman Catholic establishment was confirmed with his commission for the design of the new cathedral at Letterkenny, co. Donegal, in 1891. Here he produced an impressive but conventional design, completed after his death with uncommonly good and extensive finishings. His own completion of a number of works by other major Catholic architectural practices, including Pugin and Ashlin, in the years from <i>c</i>.1890, reflected further his authoritative position. A number of notable architects were associated with Hague's office, including Harry Allberry (1872&#150;1952), and after his death on 22 March 1899 his wife established with his managing assistant, T. F. McNamara (1867&#150;1947), a partnership that survived as Hague and McNamara until at least 1907. William Hague is buried in Glasnevin cemetery, Dublin, where he is commemorated by a memorial dedicated also to his daughter Kathleen (<i>d</i>. 1919) and sister Anne (<i>d</i>. 1843).<br>
