<span class="headword">Wade,  Nathaniel</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1718), <span class="occ">lawyer and conspirator</span>, was the third son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/66697/', "John Wade (d. in or before 1668?)")</script> of The Wicke, Arlingham, Gloucestershire, a Cromwellian army officer usually identified as the sometime governor of the Isle of Man during the protectorate. His mother, Anne (formerly Lane), died on 19 May 1678 and was buried at St Stephen's, Bristol. Pursuing a career in the law, Wade was admitted to New Inn on 11 June 1678, transferred to the Middle Temple on 15 June 1681, and was called to the bar on 26 May 1682.<br>
<br>In the 1670s and early 1680s Wade and his brother William, a grocer, were active in dissenting circles in Bristol, often protecting and defending fellow nonconformists. In August 1680 Wade, then awaiting trial at the Wells assizes, was described as guilty of seditious and disloyal practices for the past three years. He was supposedly the ringleader of a company of about sixty sectarians that practised armed drills. He was also convicted and fined for resisting a justice who was disturbing a conventicle. In London Nathaniel was friendly with <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/92786', "Green Ribbon Club")</script> whigs and for a time resided in Soho Square with fellow club members Richard Nelthorpe and Colonel John Rumsey. Not surprisingly, in 1682 he was brought into the whig conspiracy later known as the Rye House plot. Wade later declared that he had had nothing to do with the plot to assassinate the royal brothers Charles II and the Catholic James, duke of York, but was only involved in a planned insurrection for the redressing of grievances and to have Monmouth, &#145;the Protestant Duke&#146;, declared prince of Wales. Wade was present at a meeting of conspirators in October 1682, at which the earl of Shaftesbury urged a group of whig leaders, among them William, Lord Russell, Lord Howard of Escrick, and Lord Grey of Werk, as well as a lower cabal of conspirators including John Ayloffe, Robert West, Major John Wildman, Richard Rumbold, and Thomas Walcott, to initiate a rising. Shaftesbury imagined, Wade later stated, &#145;that he had many thousands at his devotion in an hour's warning&#146;  (Wigfield, <span class="italic">The Monmouth Rebellion</span>, 153). Shortly after this meeting Shaftesbury took refuge in Amsterdam and Wade returned to Bristol; he felt that he and his friends had been abused by the hesitancy and &#145;unconstancy&#146; of the &#145;great men and their little resolution to execute what they had resolved&#146;  (ibid., 153&#150;4). He did, however, remain in contact with fellow conspirators in London and brought his brother William and the Bristol merchant James Holloway in on the planned insurrection.<br>
<br>In the winter of 1682 Wade was back in London and was informed by Colonel Rumsey of the plot to assassinate the king and his brother at Rye House mill. Wade supposedly refused to take part. The plans of the whig plotters were exposed in June 1683. Members of the lower cabal met one last time, and Wade proposed that they immediately muster what men they could and lead a rising &#145;here or in the west to die like men than be hanged like dogs&#146;  (<span class="italic">State trials</span>, 9.409). But Colonel Rumsey declared that the situation was hopeless, and they finally decided that they should go their separate ways. On 23 June a royal proclamation was issued for the arrest of Wade, Rumsey, Nelthorpe, Rumbold, and others. Wade and Nelthorpe escaped abroad and lived for a time with the regicide Colonel Edmund Ludow in Switzerland.<br>
<br>In the spring of 1684 Wade was in Holland serving as an intermediary between the duke of Monmouth and Archibald Campbell, ninth earl of Argyll. Following the death of Charles II Argyll and Monmouth agreed to co-ordinate their invasions. On 2 May Argyll set sail for Scotland, and Monmouth and his tiny band of eighty-three men followed three weeks later, landing at Lyme Regis on 11 June. Wade commanded the Red regiment and saw action at Bridport, where he proved himself a courageous commander. At the battle of Sedgemoor on 5 July Wade's battalion was routed and he fled the field. With fifty other men he rode to Ilfracombe, where they seized a coastal vessel only to be forced ashore by two frigates. Wade fled alone to Brendon Devon, where he was shot in the back trying to avoid capture.<br>
<br>Despite his notoriety, Wade was allowed to turn king's evidence. At Windsor Castle and then Newgate, where he was held prisoner, he made a complete confession of his activities beginning with the dissolution of the Oxford parliament and continuing up to his capture. Wade's confession, which is not in his handwriting and, as he was recovering from a near fatal wound, was probably dictated, remains one of the best sources for Monmouth's rebellion. Although Wade was supposed to reveal names, he stated that &#145;all the persons I can positively charge to have been concerned in it are either outlawed, dead or executed&#146;  (Wigfield, <span class="italic">The Monmouth Rebellion</span>, 149). James's administration probably learned very little from Wade's confession, and at the trial of Lord Delamere in January 1686 he was only able to offer &#145;hearsay&#146; evidence, but nevertheless he was granted a full pardon in May 1686. In 1687 he married Anne (<i>d</i>. 1735/6), widow of Samuel Davies, daughter of Robert Vickris, a Bristol merchant, and sister of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28270/', "Richard Vickris")</script>. Anne was a Quaker and defied the wishes of the Bristol Friends' meeting in marrying Wade, who attended the Independent Church of Christ congregation, which met at Castle Green, Broadmead, Bristol. They had at least three children and in the 1690s owned two houses, in St Leonard's and St Augustine's parishes, Bristol. In January 1688, as part of James's efforts to court his former enemies, whigs and dissenters, Wade was sent to Bristol and appointed town clerk. In October that year, on the eve of the revolution of 1688, Wade lost his position when the corporation was ousted. Out of loyalty to James II Wade did not join the prince of Orange's army in November 1688.<br>
<br>Wade remained active in local politics, supporting whig-dominated initiatives such as the creation of the Bristol corporation of the poor in 1696; helping to set up the Bristol workhouse; and becoming a guardian of the poor for St Ewen's parish from 1696 for twelve years, and deputy governor in 1704&#150;5. He was also a member of the Bristol Society for the Reformation of Manners, active between 1700 and 1705. Their mission was to assist the local authorities in &#145;discouraging of Prophaneness and Debauchery&#146; by &#145;discovering disorderly houses&#146; and by the &#145;taking up of offenders and carrying them before magistrates&#146;  (Barry and Morgan, 15). In 1701 Wade petitioned parliament, hoping to have the attainder against Monmouth's followers reversed. In 1709 he commanded the Bristol militia against the Kingswood colliers who rioted against high food prices. He died in 1718 and was buried on 14 March in Redcross Street burial-ground, Bristol.<br>
