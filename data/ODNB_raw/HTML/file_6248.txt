<span class="headword">Copcot,  John</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1590), <span class="occ">college head</span>, is said to have been born in Calais, a report given colour by the occasional appearance of his name in French forms, such as Copequot. He matriculated as a pensioner at Trinity College, Cambridge, on 16 November 1562, took up a scholarship there the following year, and was admitted to a fellowship in 1567. Copcot graduated BA in 1567 and MA in 1570. He was appointed a university preacher in 1576, and was awarded his BTh in 1577 and his doctorate in 1582. He acquired several ecclesiastical livings, including the rectory of St Dunstan-in-the-East in 1580 and that of Orwell, Cambridgeshire, in 1586; in that year also, on 4 August, he was installed as prebendary of Sidlesham, in the diocese of Chichester.<br>
<br>Copcot was a determined defender of the Church of England, preaching at Paul's Cross in 1584 against criticism of its liturgy and government which had appeared in Dudley Fenner's <span class="italic">Counter-Poyson</span>. In a published extract from this sermon, he is said to have cited the epistle to the <span class="roman">Corinthians</span> to prove that &#145;For lack of discipline, no man ought to depart from the church&#146;  (Fenner, no pagination). In 1586&#150;7 he served as vice-chancellor of Cambridge University, despite his not holding a college mastership. Opposition to his forthright views undoubtedly reinforced the resentment occasioned by this breach of tradition. His appointment gave rise to an anomaly: within his own college Copcot was subject, as a fellow, to the discipline of its master, John Still, but outside its walls Still, like the other college heads, had to defer to the authority of the vice-chancellor.<br>
<br>Copcot proved eager to use his powers. Mutual jealousies and jurisdictional disputes had increasingly soured relations between town and university. When John Edmunds (alias Mere), the mayor of Cambridge, impounded some hogs belonging to the bailiff of Jesus College, the vice-chancellor and college heads acted to ban all dealings between him and members of the university. Copcot also sought to stem the tide of puritan radicalism, flowing strongly at this time, which had given rise to some alarming manifestations. In July 1587 he wrote to Lord Burghley, the chancellor of the university, about one Ralph Durdon of Pembroke College, whom he had imprisoned in the Tolbooth the previous November, and who remained there still, for he had circulated papers &#145;interpreting the <span class="roman">Revelation</span> of St John the Divine after his own fancy&#146;, and had &#145;named himself Elias, and being at liberty would be preaching very disorderly whither he could come&#146;  (<span class="italic">Masters' History</span>, 141). While vice-chancellor Copcot also became embroiled with the fellows of Christ's College in disputes arising from efforts to reform its lax finances, and to discipline the radical puritan Sampson Sheffield. Copcot sought to use the visitorial powers of the vice-chancellor to confront both problems, but the delaying powers of the fellows proved too strong. His attempt to continue his efforts beyond the tenure of his vice-chancellorship was in breach of the statutes, and led to a successful appeal to the chancellor, Lord Burghley.<br>
<br>It was nevertheless on the recommendation of Burghley that on 6 November 1587, Copcot was elected master of Corpus Christi College. His was a turbulent tenure, fully in keeping with his character and record, though other factors certainly contributed to the contentious atmosphere in Cambridge in the late 1580s. Perhaps the most notable dispute concerned Anthony Hickman, expelled in 1588 by the master and five of the eight fellows on the grounds that he was &#145;proud, idle, contentious, studied not, and condemned those that did&#146;; but it was also reported that Copcot and his party &#145;bore an ill will indeed to him, occasioned by his opposing the election of the said master this year&#146;  (Strype, <span class="italic">Annals</span>, 3/2.113). The legal case for expulsion seems to have been weak, for Hickman's appeal to Secretary Walsingham won the support of three college heads and several prominent civil lawyers. When enquiry was made as to the grounds of the expulsion, Copcot refused all explanation, asserting the right of the college to act independently in such matters. The case was then passed to Archbishop Whitgift, whose rejection of Hickman's case may have owed something to the fact that Copcot was then his chaplain. A further appeal, to Lord Burghley, was batted back to Whitgift, who remained obdurate. So did Copcot, for Hickman was not restored until 1591, under the new mastership of Jegon.<br>
<br>Despite his taste for political contention Copcot is said to have been &#145;not only a great proficient in and lover of literature himself, but an encourager of it in others&#146;  (<span class="italic">Masters' History</span>, 136), and &#145;a great critic in the Latin language&#146;  (Cooper, <span class="italic">Annals</span>, 2.94). To the library of Corpus Christi College he presented an edition of the works of Bellarmine. Copcot corresponded often with John Drusius, the scholar in classical languages, who recorded that he became emaciated through long hours of study. He died, probably in Cambridge, in early August 1590.<br>
