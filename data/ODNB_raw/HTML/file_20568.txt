<span class="headword">Offley, Sir  Thomas</span>  (<em>c.</em>1505&#150;1582), <span class="occ">mayor of London</span>, born at Stafford, was the eldest son of William Offley, a native of Staffordshire who became sheriff of Chester in 1517; his mother's maiden name was Cradock. Sent to London at the age of twelve, Offley studied under William Lily, the first master of St Paul's School, and sang in the choir there. He was apprenticed to Lily's friend John Nichols, a merchant taylor and merchant of the staple at Calais; and in due course Offley married Nichols's daughter and heir, Joan (<i>d</i>. 1578). Offley rose through the ranks to become master of the Merchant Taylors' Company in 1547 and a prosperous wool exporter. In 1549 he served as alderman of Portstoken ward and translated to Aldgate on 22 May 1550; in 1553 he was sheriff of London, and in 1556 became lord mayor.<br>
<br>Taking his oath as mayor on 28 October 1556, Offley went by water to Westminster, accompanied by other community leaders and the bachelors from his company. Queen Mary knighted him at Greenwich on 7 February 1557 along with William Chester, alderman. Clode posits that while some of Offley's fellow guildsmen &#145;suffered under evil times&#146;, Offley &#145;carried laws into effect&#146;; however, Offley's civic service during the reign of Mary I did not prevent him from being &#145;an advocate of the new learning&#146;  (Clode, 2.144; 1.150). Offley's mayoralty introduced the institution of night-bellmen, but is better remembered for the &#145;burning fevers&#146; that killed seven aldermen within two months. During Offley's year of tenure Philip II of Spain came to Greenwich to visit his wife, the queen, and the royal couple rode through London. On 23 March 1557 Offley met them at the Tower wharf and escorted them through the city amid great fanfare and pomp. That same year he attended the memorial for the king of Denmark on 28 August as the city's chief mourner.<br>
<br>Following his varied civic office-holding, Offley was mayor of the staple in 1560, 1564&#150;5, and 1569. He helped draw up a new book of ordinances for the staplers in 1565. He was also a charter member of the Muscovy Company and, by the first years of Elizabeth I's reign, was among the wealthiest men in London. None the less, there is little extant evidence of his business activities. He obtained former chantry property in Wolverhampton by a grant from Philip Bold in 1556, and in 1578 was still bringing &#145;800 tod of wool by water to Chard&#146;.<br>
<br>Offley lived in Lime Street, then in the parish of St Dionis Backchurch. While an alderman for Lime Street he successfully asserted the ward's rights over the church and grounds of St Augustine on the Wall in a dispute with Aldgate ward. He defended the interests of the Merchant Taylors' Company before a parliamentary committee in a confrontation with the Clothworkers' Company in 1566 over jurisdictional questions. His association with the Merchant Taylors' continued long after his death, as ten members of his family joined the guild between 1551 and 1628, including his sons Thomas, Henry, and Richard. He was godfather to Alderman John White's son Thomas, baptized at St Bartholomew by the Exchange on 3 February 1561.<br>
<br>Offley's wife, Joan, predeceased him, together with three of their sons, including the first-born, Hugh; only one, Henry (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1536), survived Offley. Izaak Walton dedicated his <span class="italic">Compleat Angler</span> to Offley's grandson Sir John Offley of Madeley. Offley died in London on 29 August 1582 (Stow says 1580) and was buried at his testamentary instruction in the church of St Andrew Undershaft near the tomb of his wife. He made many magnanimous bequests in his will, dated 5 August 1580; half of his estate, plus &pound;200 deducted from the other half, was given in charity to be administered by his executors. Among his donations were gifts to the poor of St Andrew Undershaft, to the sick in London hospitals, to destitute prisoners incarcerated throughout London, and to impoverished students at Oxford and Cambridge. Despite his munificence, Offley is remembered for the simplicity of his private tastes in a popular rhyme:<blockquote>
<div>Offley three dishes had of daily rost,<br>
</div>
<div>an egg, an apple, and (the third) a toast.<br>
</div> (<span class="italic">Diary of Henry Machyn</span>, 353)</blockquote>
