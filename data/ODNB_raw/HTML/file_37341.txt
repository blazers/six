<span class="headword">D'Arcy,  William Knox</span>  (1849&#150;1917), <span class="occ">financier</span>, was born on 11 October 1849 at Highweek, Newton Abbot, Devon, the only son among the seven children of William Francis D'Arcy, solicitor, of Newton Abbot, and his wife, Elizabeth Baker, daughter of the Revd Robert Bradford of Wolborough, Devon. He was educated at Westminster School and in 1866 emigrated with his parents to Australia, where they settled in Rockhampton on the Queensland coast.<br>
<br>D'Arcy qualified as a solicitor in March 1872, initially working with his father, but in 1882 formed a syndicate to exploit a vein of gold that had been discovered close to Rockhampton. With seven other shareholders, D'Arcy formed the Mount Morgan Mining Company. Holding 125,000 shares in his own name, plus 233,000 in trust, D'Arcy became a very rich man. He disposed of his legal practice in 1886, and three years later he returned to England, where he enjoyed high society and sporting pursuits: there were shooting parties on his Norfolk estate, and he held his own private stand at Epsom.<br>
<br>On 23 October 1872 D'Arcy married Elena, daughter of Samuel Bradford Birkbeck, a mining engineer, of Glenmore, Queensland; they had two sons and three daughters. Elena died in 1897, and in 1899 D'Arcy married Ernestine Eliza Nutting, a divorcee, who was the daughter of the Australian journalist Arthur Leslie Boucicault.<br>
<br>Although still a director of Mount Morgan, and chairman of its London board, D'Arcy remained interested in new financial ventures. Towards the end of 1900 he was approached about funding exploration in Persia, where oil seepages had long been known about. D'Arcy himself never went to Persia, but on 28 May 1901 his representative obtained a concession valid for sixty years. This entitled him to search for and sell &#145;natural gas, petroleum, asphalt and ozokerite&#146; throughout all of Persia except in the five northern provinces adjoining Russia. Drilling operations began towards the end of 1902 in Chiah Surkh, a likely oil-bearing area near the border with Iraq. D'Arcy's engineer, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/47967/', "George Bernard Reynolds (1852/3&#150;1925)")</script>, was a man of great experience and tenacity, but the difficulties proved formidable.<br>
<br>After three years without success D'Arcy feared that the venture would fail. &#145;Every purse has its limits&#146;, he wrote, &#145;and I am beginning to see the bottom of my own.&#146; D'Arcy had invested some &pound;250,000 of his own money in the enterprise, and felt that it was &#145;money that I shall never see again&#146;. Other financial help was needed, and in 1905 it came in the form of a deal with the Burmah Oil Company&#151;to whom D'Arcy ultimately surrendered his interest in the whole venture, in return for 170,000 Burmah shares and the reimbursement of all his expenses.<br>
<br>Drilling operations had meanwhile been shifted to the south, and oil was finally struck in Masjid-i-Suleiman on 26 May 1908, just as D'Arcy and Burmah were on the point of giving up. The discovery of oil in significant quantities ensured D'Arcy's successful formation of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company on 14 April 1909, and marked the birth of the oil industry of the Middle East. Although D'Arcy sat on the board of the new company he was not disposed to play any further significant role. D'Arcy died on 1 May 1917 at his home, Stanmore Hall, Middlesex, and was buried four days later at Stanmore parish church.<br>
