<span class="headword">Prideaux,  Humphrey</span>  (1648&#150;1724), <span class="occ">dean of Norwich and author</span>, was born on 3 May 1648 at Padstow, Cornwall, third son of Edmund Prideaux (<i>bap</i>. 1606, <i>d</i>. 1683) of Padstow Place and his wife, Bridget (<i>bap</i>. 1620, <i>d</i>. 1690), daughter of John Moyle of Bake in St Germans and his wife, Admonition. He was first educated locally at Liskeard and Bodmin schools. On 19 November 1664 his uncle Sir William Morice, then secretary of state, recommended him to Richard Busby at Westminster School with the hope that &#145;Nature hath in good measure disposed him for Learning, and that his Country-rudiments will be no prejudice to his progresse therein&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 28104, fol. 11). He was chosen king's scholar at Westminster in 1665; then on 20 April 1668 commended by the king to the electors of Christ Church, Oxford. He was admitted to Christ Church on 26 October 1668 (matriculating on 11 December) and tutored by Arthur Squibb. He graduated BA on 22 June 1672, MA on 29 April 1675, BD on 15 November 1682, and DD on 8 June 1686; he was praelector in 1673, and in 1680 praelector graecae. In 1676 Lord Chancellor Finch asked him to tutor his undergraduate son Charles, and through Finch's patronage Prideaux became sinecure rector of Llandewi Felffre, Pembrokeshire (1677), rector of St Clement's, Oxford (1679), and prebend of Norwich (installed 15 August 1681); also, thanks to Finch's successor, Lord Guilford, rector of Bladon-cum-Woodstock, Oxfordshire (1683).<br>
<br>Dean Fell employed Prideaux as an editor. On 27 September 1674 he complained to his student friend and correspondent John Ellis, &#145;I am now groaneing under the oppression of two or three heavy burdens which Mr. Dean hath layed upon me.&#146; One was completion of Edmund Chilmead's edition of John Malalas&#151;&#145;a horrid musty foolish booke&#146;&#151;eventually published in 1691. Another was a catalogue of the Arundel, Selden, and other marbles, from which (in particular the Parian marble) Prideaux designed an annotated &#145;table of all Greek chronology &hellip; the most methodicall and correct of any that have yet been set forth&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters</span>, 22&#150;3). But <span class="italic">Marmora Oxoniensia</span> (1676), hastily completed and depending largely on earlier scholarship, was, as Hearne noted in 1719, &#145;wonderfully defective, and what the D<sup>r</sup>. was now asham'd of, at least as to the transcribing part&#146;  (T. Hearne, <span class="italic">Remarks and Collections</span>, vol. 7, 1906, 6). Like Busby at Westminster, Fell valued the Near Eastern languages, and Prideaux was further encouraged in those studies by &#145;the more than ordinary helpe&#146; he hoped to receive from Edward Pococke  (<span class="italic">Letters</span>, 43). In 1677 a letter described Prideaux as &#145;Hebrew reader in our college&#146;  (Bill, 206), and in 1679 he published Moses Maimonides' <span class="italic">De jure pauperis et peregrini</span>, with Latin translation and notes. Prideaux's dedication to Finch links the lord chancellor with Maimonides by supposing English municipal law to have Mosaic origins.<br>
<br>On 9 July 1685 Prideaux announced his resolution to leave Oxford and marry: &#145;I little thought I should ever come to this; but abundance of motives have overpowred me&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters</span>, 144). On 16 February 1686 he married Bridget, the only child of Anthony and Mary Bockenham of Helmingham, Suffolk, who brought him &pound;3000. Having exchanged his Bladon rectory for Saham Toney, Norfolk, and settled there &#145;in great content&#146;, he refused the Hebrew professorship offered him on Pococke's death in 1691&#151;&#145;I nauseate that learning,&#146; he wrote, &#145;and I nauseate Christ Church&#146;&#151;but later regretted his decision  (ibid., 147, 150).<br>
<br>Prideaux was not a retiring man: his correspondence shows him concerned with his preferment and with church and local politics. He was active against Catholics (and later Jacobites) and in mid-1688 published letters he had written to dissuade a Norfolk convert&#151;<span class="italic">The Validity of the Orders of the Church of England</span>. He preached against the Catholic mass, frustrated the reading of James II's declaration of indulgence, and armed his servants in support of William of Orange's landing. As archdeacon of Suffolk, installed on 21 December 1688, he used his visitation the following May to urge subscription to the new oaths, only three incumbents refusing. He advocated the prayer-book changes for dissenters that were never brought forward when convocation met on 21 November 1689; but he feared a misunderstanding of the <span class="roman">Toleration Act</span> would &#145;turn halfe the nation into downe right atheisme&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters</span>, 154). Among other questions, he took up that of clandestine marriage and wrote for Bishop Richard Kidder of Bath and Wells <span class="italic">The Case of Clandestine Marriages</span> (1691), which argued that the bill before parliament was needlessly severe and the existing canons, if enforced, quite sufficient.<br>
<br>In 1694 Prideaux gave up Saham, which he found unhealthy, to live in Norwich; in 1697 he acquired the neighbouring vicarage of Trowse and held it until 1709. His superiors in Norwich were uncongenial: the &#145;close designeing&#146; Bishop John Moore and the &#145;horrid sot&#146; Dean Henry Fairfax  (<span class="italic">Letters</span>, 148, 160). However, he succeeded Fairfax as dean in 1702 (installed on 8 June) and might have succeeded Moore in 1707, except that he thought himself too old and supported Charles Trimnell's elevation instead.<br>
<br>Prideaux's practical churchmanship led him to write <span class="italic">The Original and Right of Tithes</span>, first published at Norwich in 1710. His main fame as a writer has rested on two frequently reprinted works, his <span class="italic">Life of Mahomet</span> (1697) and his <span class="italic">Connection</span> (1716&#150;18). The former's title states its purpose&#151;<span class="italic">The True Nature of Imposture Fully Displayed in the Life of Mahomet</span>&#151;and the life itself is followed by a long &#145;Letter to the <i>Deists</i>&#146; identifying seven marks of imposture chargeable on &#145;Mahometism&#146; but not on Christianity. Prideaux's learned footnotes and bibliography of thirty-six Arabic authorities imply original research in manuscript sources; but, as P. M. Holt shows, everything derives from printed editions (with Latin translations) or citations and references in Christian writers. &#145;[Edward] Pococke above all provided a mine of information in his <span class="italic">Specimen historiae Arabum</span> [1650]. &hellip; An impressive array of Arabic authorities in a footnote usually implies the incorporation of material from Pococke's notes in the <span class="italic">Specimen</span>&#146;  (Holt, 293&#150;4). Prideaux's <span class="italic">Old and New Testament Connected</span> is a much larger work, covering the history of the Jews from 747 <span class="smallcap">BC</span> to <span class="smallcap">AD</span> 33 in two parts, divided at 292 <span class="smallcap">BC</span>, when the <span class="roman">Old Testament</span> canon was complete. Here too Prideaux had, as his preface acknowledges, one of the great seventeenth-century scholars to guide him, James Ussher in his <span class="italic">Annales veteris et novi testamenti</span> (1650&#150;54). However, unlike Ussher (or Pococke), Prideaux aimed to make things easy for the general reader by writing clearly and fully in English, with translated quotations and without exotic words; so the <span class="italic">Connection</span>, while outdated in execution and perhaps conception, continued to be printed into the mid-nineteenth century. Two Gaudy orations on Prideaux at Christ Church, in 1790 and 1863, are evidence of his work's continuing currency.<br>
<br>In his preface to the <span class="italic">Connection</span> Prideaux describes himself as disabled from preaching. In 1710, when seriously afflicted with the stone, he was told &#145;I cannot bear that operation, but that in all likelyhood I must dy under it&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters</span>, 205). In fact he was operated upon successfully, but afterwards his case was unfortunately managed. Although ill and depending on an amanuensis, his last letter to Ellis, of 29 September 1722, shows him concerned with the usual matters: an unconscientious clergyman, a local election, a Jacobite, and a new session of parliament  (<span class="italic">Letters</span>, 206&#150;7). Prideaux died in the deanery, Norwich, on 1 November 1724 and was buried in the nave of Norwich Cathedral. In his will, dated 4 August 1714, he left his whole estate to his first child, Edmund. He had already given his oriental books to Clare College, Cambridge, in 1721.<br>
