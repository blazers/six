<span class="headword">Purcell,  Albert Arthur <span class="st"> [Alf]</span></span>  (1872&#150;1935), <span class="occ">trade unionist and socialist</span>, was born on 3 November 1872 at 29 Britannia Street, Hoxton, London, the son of Albert Duncan Purcell and his wife, Charlotte (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Alleway), who were both Irish. Purcell spent much of his childhood in Keighley, where he received an elementary education and began his first job, as a half-timer in a woollen mill, at the age of nine. In 1890, back in Hoxton, Purcell was apprenticed to his father's and brothers' trade as a French polisher. In 1895 he married Sarah Elizabeth, daughter of George Thomas Fidler, an engine driver of Edmonton; they had three daughters. An active member of the London French Polishers' Union, Purcell was elected first treasurer and then, in 1898, general secretary of the Amalgamated Society of French Polishers, into which the London union had merged. In 1900 he moved with his union's central office to Manchester and made his home in Salford. With the merger of his union into the newly formed National Amalgamated Furnishing Trades Association in 1910, Purcell became its Manchester organizer. He was by this time a familiar figure at meetings of Manchester and Salford Trades Council, serving the first of several stints as president and vice-president from 1905 to 1907.<br>
<br>In 1895 Purcell had begun lecturing for the temperance movement, only to recoil from its leaders' narrow-mindedness some two years later. Instead he was drawn by the Eight Hours Movement into the avowedly Marxist Social Democratic Federation (SDF), forerunner of the British Socialist Party (BSP). While he shared the SDF's disdain for the compromising attachments of Labour pragmatists, Purcell's was an ecumenical socialism and in Salford he held both SDF and Independent Labour Party (ILP) memberships. With their support he won a seat on the borough council in 1906, held, with a year's interruption, until 1912. In the parliamentary election of January 1910, he fought West Salford as an independent socialist, backed by Victor Grayson, the countess of Warwick, and a self-consciously exclusive Socialist Representation Committee. Some Labour MPs responded by supporting his Liberal opponent and Purcell came bottom of the poll. This d&eacute;b&acirc;cle may help to explain the greater attractiveness to him of notions of direct action based on the workplace. In November 1910 he chaired the Manchester conference on industrial unionism initiated by Tom Mann, and helped to establish Mann's Industrial Syndicalist Education League. Purcell told the conference that he looked upon industrial unionism as a movement which was far more important than the political labour movement, and observed that &#145;This force [is] what [is] required to emancipate the workers, if they [are] to be emancipated at all&#146;  (<span class="italic">Industrial Syndicalist</span>). It is a measure of the period's complexities that he had, that same month, sought and regained election as a Salford borough councillor.<br>
<br>During the war years Purcell remained identified with the BSP left and in 1920, representing South Salford BSP, he moved the formation of the British Communist Party at its founding congress. Like many early converts, he left the party soon afterwards but without distancing himself from his left-wing past. He sat in parliament for Coventry (1923&#150;4) and then the Forest of Dean (1925&#150;9), but according to his colleague George Hicks he felt penned up in its clubby precincts. Instead, his true m&eacute;tier was as one of the &#145;Communistic trade union leaders&#146; noted by Beatrice Webb, assured and assertive in the early 1920s but inevitably somewhat deflated by the failure of the general strike. In 1919 he was elected to the TUC parliamentary committee and remained on its successor body, the TUC general council, until 1927. His was a robust militancy and heartfelt internationalism, exemplified by the journal he founded in 1925, <span class="italic">Trade Union Unity</span>. In particular he was identified with the cause of Soviet Russia. A stalwart of the Hands Off Russia movement and its successor, the Anglo-Russian parliamentary committee, he had been enthused by visits to the new workers' state in 1920 and 1924. He was, with Mikhail Tomsky, the main force behind the Anglo-Russian committee of the British and Soviet trade union centres, conceived at the euphoric Scarborough TUC of 1925 and buried amid mutual recriminations two years later. As president of the International Federation of Trade Unions (IFTU) from 1924, he found that his pro-Soviet attitudes were not always palatable to the continental unions and in 1927 they failed to re-elect him to the IFTU's executive.<br>
<br>At the 1929 general election, Purcell returned to Manchester to contest Moss Side but lost by some 2000 votes. He remained in the city and that September was elected secretary of Manchester and Salford Trades Council. He devoted his final years of undiminished vigour to its activities, organizing a notable People's Congress in May 1931 and helping set up a local tenants' association. Purcell died suddenly at his Manchester home, 24 Kendall Road, Crumpsall, on 24 December 1935. He was survived by his wife, for whom a trades council appeal raised just over &pound;1200.<br>
<br>Powerful and stockily built, Purcell was as combative in debate as he had at one time proved in east London boxing rings. S. G. Hobson, with whom he had set up the short-lived Furnishing Guild in 1922, remembered him to have been &#145;as ready with his fists as with his tongue&#146;. Joe Toole, a Salford Labour MP, recalled him on his arrival in Salford as &#145;a man of fine physique, a first-class speaker, and possessed of a good knowledge of working-class life, [who] threw himself into our propaganda work and rallied thousands to our standard&#146;.<br>
