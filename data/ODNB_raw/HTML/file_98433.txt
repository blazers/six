<span class="headword">Bell <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Poynter]</span>,  Clara</span>  (1834&#150;1927), <span class="occ">translator</span>, was born on 29 January 1834 in Westminster, the eldest of the four children of the architect <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22687/', "Ambrose Poynter (1796&#150;1886)")</script> and his wife, Emma, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Forster (1800&#150;1848). Her mother was the granddaughter of the sculptor <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1302/', "Thomas Banks")</script>, who had initiated the family's strong links with the arts and the continent. He himself worked in Italy for seven years; Clara's father trained in Italy and Greece, worked in France in 1830&#150;32, and in 1836 was again in Paris, where his son Edward, later <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35600/', "Sir Edward Poynter")</script>, the painter, was born. From an early age Clara mixed with artists and non-Anglophones, at first friends of her parents, later also those of her brother, who in 1856&#150;9 studied with the painter Charles Gleyre in Paris.<br>
<br>On 24 April 1856 Clara Poynter married, at St Margaret's, Westminster, Robert Courtenay Bell (1817&#150;1896), son of William Bell, of the East India Company's civil service, Madras. At the time of their marriage he gave his occupation as gentleman; he was later registrar of the National Provincial Bank. One of their close friends was George du Maurier, who had been a fellow student of Edward Poynter's in Paris; he described Clara in 1860 as &#145;the most exquisite amateur singer I <i>ever</i> heard&#146; and in 1863 as &#145;the cleverest woman of our acquaintance&#146;  (du Maurier, 6, 202). The Bells lived first at 64 Torrington Square in Bloomsbury and from 1861 in Richmond Road, Kew; five sons and two daughters were born between 1857 and 1872. The musicologist J. A. Fuller Maitland described the household as &#145;a paradise for young people addicted to literature and the arts&#146;, since Clara, &#145;amazingly competent, was an expert translator&#146; and the children &#145;shared their parents' artistic proclivities&#146;  (<span class="italic">Door-Keeper of Music</span>, 86). Through Edward Poynter's marriage to Agnes Macdonald, one of the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/76071/', "Macdonald sisters")</script>, the family also had connections with Rudyard Kipling and Edward Burne-Jones, who introduced other Pre-Raphaelites; Robert Browning was an occasional visitor.<br>
<br>In 1876, when her youngest child was four, Clara Bell began her career, translating, with her sister Eleanor, Wilhelmine von Hillern's romance as <span class="italic">The Vulture Maiden</span>; it was published by Sampson Low in England and Tauchnitz on the continent. In the following year the same publishers engaged her to translate <span class="italic">Uarda</span>, a historical romance by the Egyptologist Georg Ebers. The genre proved popular, particularly in America, where she attracted very enthusiastic reviews; she translated a further sixteen similar romances between 1878 and 1892. In 1880 she was recruited to translate Ebers's non-fictional <span class="italic">Egypt: Descriptive, Historical and Picturesque</span>, which was followed by some sixteen non-fiction books on a variety of subjects (including art, music, travel, and biography) and from a variety of languages (German, French, Dutch, Italian, and Spanish). In 1881&#150;4 she collaborated with Fuller Maitland on a translation of Philipp Spitta's three-volume work on J. S. Bach (1883&#150;5). Fuller Maitland later recorded that &#145;as her knowledge of music was about on a par with my knowledge of German, we could help each other, and the work occupied some three years very happily&#146;  (<span class="italic">Door-Keeper of Music</span>, 86). When Count von Moltke died in 1891, she was called in to translate his <span class="italic">Franco-German War</span> and <span class="italic">Letters &hellip; to his Mother and his Brothers</span>, while in 1890 she translated Henrik Jaeger's <span class="italic">Life of Ibsen</span> (from the German version). From 1882 she had also been translating fiction other than historical romances, including novels by Perez Gald&ograve;s, Guy de Maupassant, Pierre Loti, and Louis Couperus. In 1895&#150;8 she was engaged to help with the forty-volume &#145;complete&#146; translation of the <span class="italic">Com&eacute;die humaine</span> by Honor&eacute; de Balzac, which was being brought out by J. M. Dent &amp; Sons. The first translator had been Ellen Marriage, who remained &#145;our mainstay&#146; according to Dent, but Clara Bell proved an &#145;adequate coadjutor&#146;, translating thirteen of the volumes. Like all her translations, these showed some signs of haste; in the same period she was also working on Dutch art books and J. K. Huysmans's <span class="italic">The Cathedral</span> (1898).<br>
<br>In August 1896 Robert Courtenay Bell died; Clara continued translating for another ten years. She died at her home, 86 Ashley Gardens, Westminster, on 16 January 1927 of cardiac and respiratory failure brought on by influenza. Several of her sons pursued distinguished artistic careers. E. Hamilton Bell (1857&#150;1929), who emigrated to America, started as an actor and stage designer and worked with Augustin Daly among others; he eventually became the director of the Philadelphia Museum of Art. Malcolm Bell (<i>b</i>. 1859) was an art historian. Charles Francis Bell (1871&#150;1966) became a pioneering curator of the department of fine art in the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford, writing the standard work on his great-great-grandfather Thomas Banks (1935) among other books. Hugh Poynter Bell (1872&#150;1961), who emigrated to Canada, was the music critic of the <span class="italic">Montreal Star</span> from 1923 to 1949, an amateur painter and composer, and a notable patron of the arts in Montreal.<br>
