<span class="headword">Colles,  Henry Cope</span>  (1879&#150;1943), <span class="occ">music historian and critic</span>, was born at Bridgnorth, Shropshire, on 20 April 1879, the third child and elder son of Abraham Colles MD FRCS (and thus the great-grandson of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5907/', "Abraham Colles")</script>), and his wife, Emily Agnes Georgina, daughter of Major Alexander R. Dallas, and granddaughter of A. R. C. Dallas. He was educated privately and at the Royal College of Music (1895&#150;9) where he studied music history under Sir Hubert Parry, the organ under Walter Alcock, and counterpoint under Walford Davies. In 1899 he became organ scholar at Worcester College, Oxford, where he attracted the attention of Henry Hadow, then dean of the college, whose lectures and writings were to have an important influence in shaping Colles's future career and critical thought.<br>
<br>At Oxford, Colles obtained the degree of BA in 1903 and the additional degree of BMus in 1904, and in 1932 the university awarded him an honorary degree of DMus; he was elected honorary fellow of Worcester in 1936. After leaving Oxford he studied at the Temple Church, London, with Walford Davies, a lifelong friend whose biography he wrote in 1942. As a writer he often stressed the value and importance of English church music and as a practical musician he gave strong support to the School of English Church Music founded by his friend Sir Sydney Nicholson, to the Church Music Society, and to St Michael's College, Tenbury, Worcestershire.<br>
<br>In 1905, at the instigation of Hadow, Colles began his career as a writer, contributing a weekly article on music to <span class="italic">The Academy</span> at the request of H. H. Child. These articles were dominated by discussion of Brahms and Richard Strauss. Colles took Hadow's view that Brahms, in restoring the classical traditions, pointed a way forward that had been eclipsed through the huge expansion of orchestral resources in the late Romantic period. His articles in the more specialist music press were primarily of musicological interest, and many of them dealt with English music from Byrd to Elgar. In 1906 he married Hester Janet (<i>d</i>. 1952), daughter of Thomas Matheson, a member of Lloyds. Also in 1906 he began work at <span class="italic">The Times</span>, becoming assistant to J. A. Fuller-Maitland, whom he succeeded as musical editor in 1911; he retained this post until his death. On his appointment as musical editor he at once inaugurated and maintained the weekly articles on music&#151;for the most part written by himself, although necessarily anonymous&#151;which attracted wide attention both in Britain and abroad. In appraising contemporary music Colles continued along similarly conservative lines as his predecessor, dismissing the work of many leading composers including Stravinsky and Schoenberg.<br>
<br>During the First World War Colles served in Macedonia as a captain in the Royal Artillery, receiving the Greek cross in 1918. On his return he was invited, in 1919, by Hugh Allen to join the staff of the Royal College of Music as lecturer in music history and analysis. In 1923 he accepted an invitation from the <span class="italic">New York Times</span> to act as guest music critic, remaining in America for some months. In 1927 he was Cramb lecturer at Glasgow University, taking for his subject the interdependence of the English language and English musical genius, especially as exemplified in Purcell. The substance of these lectures was reproduced in his <span class="italic">Voice and Verse</span> (1928). He lectured also at Liverpool University, the Royal Institution, and elsewhere.<br>
<br>In 1927 appeared the third and revised edition of <span class="italic">Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians</span>, the editorship of which had been entrusted to Colles some years before. It was an extensive revision for which his scholarship eminently qualified him. He was also responsible for a further revision and a supplementary volume in 1940 and this, along with the seventh volume of the <span class="italic">Oxford History of Music</span>, entitled <span class="italic">Symphony and Drama, 1850&#150;1900</span> (1934), must be counted as his most substantial and enduring work. His most popular work, <span class="italic">The Growth of Music</span> (1912&#150;16), a study of music history designed for use in schools, continued the evolutionary method of documenting music history that characterized the work of Parry. His other works include <span class="italic">The Chamber Music of Brahms</span> (1933) and <span class="italic">On Learning Music, and other Essays</span> (1940). A collection of his shorter writings was edited by his wife, with a short memoir, and published as <span class="italic">Essays and Lectures</span> (1945). Colles died at his home in London, 91 Swan Court, Chelsea, on 4 March 1943.<br>
