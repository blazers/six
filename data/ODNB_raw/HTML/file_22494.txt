<span class="headword">Ponsonby,  Frederick George Brabazon</span>, sixth earl of Bessborough  (1815&#150;1895), <span class="occ">politician and cricketer</span>, was born on 11 September 1815 in London, the second son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22500/', "John William Ponsonby, fourth earl of Bessborough (1781&#150;1847)")</script>, and Lady Maria Fane (1787&#150;1834), third daughter of the tenth earl of Westmorland. He was educated at Harrow School from 1830 to 1833 and then at Trinity College, Cambridge, graduating MA in 1837. He subsequently trained for the law and was called to the bar at Lincoln's Inn on 16 June 1840. He played cricket for his school in the match against Eton at Lord's in August 1832, scoring a pair, and subsequently played for his university, featuring in the varsity match of 1836. Later he appeared in a number of important matches, for the Gentlemen of England as well as a number of All England elevens, before he gave up playing in 1845 after being incapacitated by an arm injury. His playing was noted for its fine, free, forward style&#151;he pulled especially well on the leg side; his most famous stroke was a clean hit for 9&#151;all run&#151;on Parkers Piece for the MCC against Cambridge in 1842.<br>
<br>Ponsonby was a good actor and played in private theatricals; these became formalized when he and his friends founded the Old Stagers, the oldest amateur theatrical company in the world, which performed annually from 1842 at the Canterbury cricket week. In July 1845, at a supper in the Blenheim Hotel, Bond Street, London, he founded&#151;with his brother Sir Spencer Ponsonby Fane, John Loraine Baldwin, and R. P. Long&#151;the famous wanderers' cricket club, I Zingari; this, with its aim of encouraging amateur cricket, succeeded beyond all expectations. Earlier he had kept the Gentlemen v. Players match going at Lord's with a private subscription, and subsequently, as a member of the MCC, he became one of the original trustees when the club purchased the freehold of Lord's in 1866. He was also instrumental in forming the Surrey County Cricket Club in 1845 and supervised the removal of the club from the Old Beehive to the market garden in Kennington, which became the Oval. He remained vice-president of the Surrey cricket club from 1845 until his death in 1895. When his playing days were over he coached the Harrow eleven, and as one of Harrow's most famous cricketing sons he is remembered, along with his lifelong friend the Hon. Robert Grimston, in the Harrow song book. According to his <span class="roman">Wisden</span> obituary, &#145;there was no more honoured figure in the cricket world&#146;  (Green, 74).<br>
<br>There is a portrait of Frederick Ponsonby at Harrow and another in the Long Room at Lord's. He was a true Ponsonby not only in looks and physique&#151;6 feet tall, hatchet-faced, with lugubrious eyes&#151;but also in his interest in charades and amateur theatricals, in which he could give full play to his dry sense of humour, and in his engagement in sporting activities; though primarily a cricketer, he also rode to hounds.<br>
<br>On the death of his brother John, the fifth earl and a Liberal politician, who had been master of her majesty's buckhounds, Ponsonby succeeded, on 28 January 1880, to the Irish title of earl of Bessborough and the English title of Baron Ponsonby of Sysonby. There followed a brief interruption in a life largely devoted to cricket, both as a player and as an administrator, when Bessborough, who previously had taken no part in politics, was propelled into the political limelight by his appointment, in June 1880, to chair the royal commission to review the <span class="roman">Irish Land Act</span> of 1870, a position for which he was eminently suited by reason of his legal background as a barrister, his working experience as agent of the Fitzwilliam estates, and his own large Irish estates.<br>
<br>The Bessborough commission, as it became known, sat between September 1880 and January 1881. It held sixty-five sessions and heard evidence from 80 landowners, 70 agents, 500 tenants, and a rich assortment of other people. The commission ranged over all possible questions connected with Irish agriculture, and its report filled two volumes of parliamentary papers. It provides a unique insight into the impact on rural Ireland of the great agricultural depression wrought by the opening of the American prairies. The report came out in favour of the three Fs: fixity of tenure, fair rents, and free sale; it was not pre-ordained but provided Gladstone with the opportunity, in his <span class="roman">Land Act</span> of 1881, to separate the Irish tenantry from Parnell's Land League. That the act did not succeed in its economic objective of transforming the Irish rural economy was because nothing in the landlord&#150;tenant relationship could alter the fact that land was cheaper on the prairies.<br>
<br>Bessborough was himself a great Irish landowner&#151;his estates in co. Kilkenny, co. Carlow, and co. Tipperary amounted to some 37,000 acres&#151;and a model landlord. He belonged to the middle party in Ireland, who sought to resolve the agrarian problems by improving their estates and reorganizing tenant rights on the lines of English copyhold customs. The recommendations of his report eventually transferred the land from the landlords to the tenants, but without resolving any of the economic difficulties facing Irish agriculture. Although taking the view that there could be a joint settlement between England and Ireland, Bessborough refused to support Gladstonian home rule and did not vote in the divisions on the <span class="roman">Home Rule Bill</span> in 1893.<br>
<br>Bessborough died on 11 March 1895, of bronchitis, at his London home, 45 Green Street, Mayfair, and was buried at Bessborough House, Piltown, on 19 March. Having remained unmarried, his titles passed to his next brother, Walter Ponsonby.<br>
