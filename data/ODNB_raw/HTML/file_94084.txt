<span class="headword">Wilson, Sir  Geoffrey Masterman</span>  (1910&#150;2004), <span class="occ">barrister, diplomatist, and public servant</span>, was born at Winterbourne, Storeton Road, Tranmere, Birkenhead, on 7 April 1910, the third son and youngest child of Alexander Cowan Wilson, civil engineer, and his wife, Edith Jane, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Brayshaw. His parents were Quakers, his mother coming from a line of Quakers going back to the seventeenth century. They were deeply religious, lived frugally, and actively pursued a number of good causes. Their influence, except their austere mode of living, and the beliefs and principles of the Society of Friends remained with Wilson all his life. When Wilson was still young the family moved to Manchester, where he attended Manchester grammar school and won an exhibition in classics to Oriel College, Oxford. Like his elder brother Roger he became chairman of the Labour Club and president of the Union, skills he exercised as a member of the Oxford debating team that toured thirty colleges in the United States in 1932. Having graduated in 1932 with a second in <i>literae humaniores</i>, he won a Harmsworth scholarship to the Middle Temple, where he was called to the bar in May 1934.<br>
<br>An enduring influence on Wilson's career was his friendship at Oxford with John Cripps, a fellow member of the Labour Club, which lasted until the latter's death in 1994. Cripps invited his friend to stay at Goodfellows, his family's country house near Burford in the Cotswolds, where he met John's father, Sir Stafford Cripps, a leading barrister and politician. Wilson visited Goodfellows often in the pre-war years and, as he later recounted, was more or less adopted by the family. When Wilson mentioned his plan to study for the bar, Sir Stafford offered him a seat in his chambers. On being called to the bar he joined the chambers of H. D. Samuels, and in the next five years appeared on common law cases at courts around London. But in 1934 Cripps retained Wilson as a junior in the inquiry into an explosion at the Gresford colliery in north Wales, which killed 266 miners. Cripps represented the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) without fee. Armed with detailed figures and charts assembled by Wilson, Cripps was able to demonstrate that the owners had been negligent despite warnings, and they were severely censured. Another explosion in 1938 killed seventy-nine men at Markham colliery in Derbyshire. Cripps again represented the NUM at the inquiry but left the case largely to Wilson, who became something of an expert on mine safety and addressed meetings on the subject.<br>
<br>On the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939 Wilson resigned from chambers, unable as a Quaker to volunteer for the armed forces but unwilling to take on the work of colleagues who did. Once again Cripps made Wilson an offer that not only resolved his dilemma but set the direction of his future career. Cripps planned to visit India and China, and invited Wilson to go along as his secretary&#150;companion. Judging that Indian independence was inevitable, Cripps foresaw the need for a constituent assembly and a constitution that would integrate British India and the princely states. In Delhi they stayed with Jawaharlal Nehru, who had been a frequent guest at Goodfellows, and also had talks with Gandhi, Jinnah, two important princes, and the viceroy. Nothing concrete emerged from the talks, however, largely because of the intransigent attitude of the viceroy and the India Office. From India, Cripps and Wilson left for China by the Burma Road. In Chungking (Chongqing), Chiang Kai-shek's headquarters, Wilson came down with jaundice and took no part in the discussions. But he recovered in time to accompany Cripps to Moscow for talks with Molotov, the foreign minister, on a proposal to set up a trade mission between the Soviet Union and Britain. They travelled on a hazardous route by way of Sinkiang (Xinjiang) without documents, directions, money, or knowledge of the local languages, and returned to Chungking after a month in Moscow.<br>
<br>No sooner had Cripps and Wilson returned to Britain in April 1940 via America, after five months abroad, than they were asked to go back to Moscow to pursue the trade mission proposal. The United Kingdom had withdrawn its ambassador to protest against the Soviet invasion of Finland, and in response to a demand by Molotov that he would discuss the matter only with an ambassador, Cripps was appointed ambassador and Wilson third secretary. There was not much to do until the German invasion of Russia, when delegations began to arrive from Britain. Wilson took lessons in Russian. When the Germans threatened Moscow the entire diplomatic corps was evacuated to Kuibyshev some 530 miles away. After ten weeks they were able to return to Moscow, and later to leave for London in a British cruiser from Murmansk.<br>
<br>In London Wilson was offered a post in the Russian department of the Foreign Office as a temporary third secretary, despite his decision to register as a conscientious objector. He worked in the department until VE-day and was the only member, apart from its head, Sir William Strang, who had ever visited Russia. One of his tasks was to translate Stalin's letters to Churchill: the Foreign Office had been receiving them in a bad English translation from the Soviet embassy and had requested the originals. Wilson made several more trips to Russia during those years, including one as a member of the British delegation to the Yalta conference. There Wilson sat behind Churchill in the plenary sessions and with Sir Edward Bridges took the minutes. He later recalled that his other main function was to empty Churchill's ashtray of his cigar butts. Wilson's last months with the Foreign Office were spent in the newly formed United Nations department. His main assignment was to act as secretary of an international group that toured cities on the American east coast exploring suitable sites for the UN headquarters. In personal terms the mission was notable for his meeting and in 1946 marrying Julie Stafford (Judy) Trowbridge in New York.<br>
<br>In 1946 Wilson returned to the bar. His first job was for the Foreign Office, preparing a draft of principles for the newly established United Nations commission on human rights. He accompanied the British delegation to the commission's first meeting in New York (chaired by Eleanor Roosevelt) as legal adviser. But one swallow did not make a summer. He found the work of chambers rather dull after his war-time adventures. After contacting the senior British officials he had worked with then, he was appointed an assistant secretary at the Treasury, seconded to the Cabinet Office. His most interesting assignment was as secretary of the India committee, which supervised the preparations for Indian independence. He was also secretary of the complex of committees that dealt with trade and related problems arising from the inconvertibility of sterling, and with the negotiations over Marshall aid.<br>
<br>In 1951 Wilson was appointed director of the Technical Co-operation Bureau newly set up by the Commonwealth in Colombo, Ceylon: not a major agency, but popular with the governments of the less developed members, which helped one another rather than seeking aid from rich countries. Wilson travelled extensively around the countries of south and south-east Asia and acquired an abiding interest in economic development. The family, which already had three children, added a fourth. Their two years in Colombo were among their most enjoyable. Recalled by the Treasury in August 1953, Wilson held a number of jobs during the next five years, including, on promotion to under-secretary, as head of the office of R. A. Butler, the lord privy seal.<br>
<br>In 1958 Wilson was appointed economic minister at the Washington embassy, a post that included acting as alternate director of the World Bank. This was normally a two-year appointment, but the Treasury asked him to stay for a third year. Before it ended the bank's president, Eugene Black, invited him to join the bank's staff as director of the Asia department. He accepted, so renewing his contacts with the countries he had served in Columbo. In 1962 Black promoted him to be vice-president, responsible for the administration, budget, and financing of the bank, including the marketing of bank bonds and the soliciting of periodic contributions from the rich governments to the bank's soft loan affiliate for the poorest countries, the International Development Association.<br>
<br>Wilson had expected to spend the rest of his career with the World Bank but did not get on with Black's successor, George Woods. Moreover, his Quaker conscience began to prick him. Life was too comfortable and his World Bank work did not sufficiently engage his inner drive to help the world's poor. So in 1966 he resigned and returned to England. After some searching he secured one of two posts as deputy secretary at the Ministry of Overseas Development. Two years later the permanent secretary, Sir Andrew Cohen, died and Wilson was promoted in his stead. He was knighted KCB in 1969, having been made CMG in 1962 and CB in 1968. He retired in 1970 on reaching the age of sixty.<br>
<br>Wilson continued to pursue an active career. After some months as deputy secretary-general (economic) at the Commonwealth Secretariat, he took a final paid job as chairman of the Race Relations Board, which gave him great personal satisfaction. He held the post for six years until 1977, when it merged with the Commission for Racial Equality. Wilson's voluntary activities thereafter were almost all connected with development, as chairman of Oxfam (1977&#150;83), which had a strong Quaker element, and a member of the boards of the Overseas Development Institute in London, the Institute of Development Studies at Sussex University, and the International Development Research Centre in Ottawa, whose quarterly meetings he attended until the age of seventy-five. He also joined, and in some cases helped start, a number of charitable organizations. As he grew older these activities fell away, although his mind remained as keen as ever. His first marriage was dissolved in 1979, but on 5 August 1989 he married Stephanie Adrienne (Steffi) Stainsby, a psychotherapist he had known at Oxfam; she was the widow of Charles Stainsby and the daughter of Harry Ross, a general practitioner. They settled in Oxford, where he died at St Luke's Nursing Home on 11 July 2004, of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. He was survived by his second wife, Steffi, and the four children of his first marriage, Susan, Catherine, Peter, and John.<br>
<br>Wilson had a hand in many of the leading events of the twentieth century. The leitmotif of his professional life after the Second World War was his dedication to improving the lot of the less fortunate. He pursued this impulse in a practical way through institutions devoted to that purpose. His wide experience, ability, and sometimes luck enabled him to serve at or near the top and thus help to shape their policies and practices. It also provided him and his family with a good living, a circumstance which did not escape his Quaker conscience. He had a keen sense of humour and looked on human foibles, including his own, with a quizzical eye. He was, in the words of a former civil service colleague, an &#145;unusual and thoughtful man, whose dry style and shrewd glance over those half-rimmed glasses masked &hellip; inner warmth and deep humanity&#146;  (The Guardian, 22 July 2004).<br>
