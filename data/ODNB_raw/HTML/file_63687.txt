<span class="headword">Marriott,  William Mark Noble</span>  (1848&#150;1916), <span class="occ">meteorologist</span>, was born at 8 Church Terrace, Pancras Road, Camden Town, London, on 9 August 1848, the only child of William Marriott (<i>b</i>. 1821/2), dairyman, and his wife, Sarah (<i>b</i>. 1824/5), daughter of Mark Cordwell of Greenwich. He was educated at Colfe's Grammar School, Lewisham, and afterwards at University College, London. From 1869 to 1872 he was a supernumerary computer at the Royal Observatory, Greenwich, working under James Glaisher in the magnetical and meteorological department. Thereafter, from 1 May 1872 until he retired forty-three years later, he was employed as assistant secretary of the Meteorological (from 1883 Royal Meteorological) Society. He was elected a fellow of that society on 20 April 1870.<br>
<br>In his application for the post of assistant secretary, Marriott stated that he was well acquainted with meteorological work in all its branches and that he frequently compiled the Royal Observatory's weekly and quarterly meteorological reports. He also stated that he had a knowledge of French and had translated letters and other works for several gentlemen. He said he was not unacquainted with the duties of secretary, having served as secretary of the Greenwich Wesleyan Mutual Improvement Society for the previous three years.<br>
<br>Marriott married Jane Saunders Old, daughter of Peter Old, engineer, on 9 August 1875, coincidentally his twenty-seventh and her twenty-fourth birthday, and their only child, William James Marriott, was born on 1 June 1876. A year or two after his marriage he moved from Stockwell to Norwood, south-east London, where he lived until his death.<br>
<br>As assistant secretary Marriott was methodical, meticulous, efficient, and energetic. His manner was quiet, courteous, and unobtrusive, and the kindness of his heart showed in his unhesitating readiness to help anyone who consulted him. He was personally well known to most members of the society, in particular to those who maintained the society's observing stations and to whom he gave valuable hints and helpful advice as to the methods and instruments they should use. He was officially inspector of these stations from 1878 to 1911. He was also for many years official lecturer of the society, in which capacity he delivered more than a hundred popular lectures to schools and scientific societies in different parts of Britain. Whenever the society's council required a special investigation of a storm, frost, tornado, or, indeed, any other form of abnormal weather, they turned to Marriott to undertake the task. In the period 1876 to 1916, he wrote for the society no fewer than thirty reports on such weather events. He was a faithful and devoted servant, and it was due in no small measure to him that the society progressed and prospered during the time he was assistant secretary.<br>
<br>Marriott was a prolific author, with more than 100 publications to his name, many of them short articles published in the <span class="italic">Quarterly Journal of the Royal Meteorological Society</span>. Although he wrote on a wide range of meteorological subjects, the majority of his articles were concerned with abnormal weather, meteorological phenomena, instruments and their usage, or observations made at various places in the United Kingdom and overseas. He also wrote a number of obituaries and, in addition, compiled the mass of statistics published in the <span class="italic">Meteorological Record</span> from 1881 to 1911. The most substantial of his publications were his three books, <span class="italic">Hints to Meteorological Observers</span> (1881; 8th edn, 1924); <span class="italic">Some Facts about the Weather</span> (1906; 2nd edn, 1909); and <span class="italic">Our Weather</span> (1911), which he wrote with J. S. Fowler.<br>
<br>After he retired on 30 September 1915, Marriott continued to attend meetings of the Royal Meteorological Society. His retirement was, however, short, for he suffered a heart attack and died at Gipsy Hill railway station, London, on 28 December 1916.<br>
