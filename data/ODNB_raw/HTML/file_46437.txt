<span class="headword">Beavan,  Margaret</span>  (1875&#150;1931), <span class="occ">welfare worker and local politician</span>, was born at 28 Bowring Street, Toxteth Park, Liverpool, Lancashire, on 1 August 1875, the eldest daughter of Jeffrey Beavan, bookkeeper and later fire insurance manager, and his wife, Ellen Catherine Williams. The Beavan children enjoyed a close family childhood in comfortable circumstances. Most of their time was spent at the family home in Liverpool, aside from an unsuccessful attempt to emigrate to the United States which failed when the climate proved unsuitable for the younger children. Margaret herself suffered from frequent bronchial attacks which appear to have kept her close to home, though she keenly involved herself in religious activities and was a regular attender at Sefton Park Presbyterian Church. The Beavans strongly believed in educating their daughters, and both Margaret and her younger sister Jessie attended Liverpool's progressive Belvedere School as day pupils. This school was a popular choice among the more progressively-minded local middle classes, and fellow pupils included Maude Royden.<br>
<br>Although Margaret Beavan was never particularly academic she was a diligent and popular pupil, and ended her school career as head girl. She went on to Royal Holloway College at Egham, Surrey, where she studied mathematics, French, and English for three years (1894&#150;7) but opted to sit no formal degree. She returned to the family home and took over responsibility for most of its running, caring for her recently widowed mother. However, despite her lack of formal qualifications she found that her college experience made her profoundly dissatisfied with a wholly domestic role and she began to look for something outside the family home. Religious work appealed, and she began voluntary teaching for the Earle Road Mission, a working-class Sunday school overseen by Sefton Park church. Here she discovered an aptitude for the work, and especially for coping with the more difficult adolescent boys.<br>
<br>Through Belvedere Old Girls' Association, Margaret Beavan renewed an acquaintance with Edith Eskrigge who was now working at the Liverpool Victoria settlement. The settlement was looking for a teacher to run small classes for disabled children who had no formal educational provision in the city, and Margaret was persuaded to undertake this work. The move from Earle Road Mission to the Victoria settlement was a significant one, as it took her out of the realm of Christian voluntary work into secular philanthropy. There were many philanthropic networks in Liverpool before the First World War, and she quickly established herself at the centre of them as a worker with a special interest in invalid children, often referred to as the Little Mother of Liverpool. As well as the Victoria settlement school she became a visitor for the Kyrle Society, the favourite charity of Liverpool society, working with its invalid children's branch. In 1908 she took over as secretary to the newly founded Invalid Children's Association, a separate charity which united all her earlier work. This new group was tremendously successful in promoting child welfare. Its most famous success was the establishment of the Leasowe Open-Air Hospital for Children, on the Wirral peninsula, which pioneered treatment of paediatric tubercular cases. Equally remarkable was Margaret's attitude to philanthropy. There was little of the distant, middle-class visitor about her. Before Leasowe was completed most TB children were in non-specialized adult hospitals in Liverpool. They would attend Leasowe for short stays, and Margaret Beavan often transported them herself, treating them to caf&eacute; teas which formed a vital part of her holistic approach to patient care. She believed in helping mothers as well as children, and organized several holidays for &#145;tired mothers&#146;, which she always extended to unmarried women.<br>
<br>Her dedication to children kept Margaret Beavan away from broader political concerns before the First World War. She was a passive advocate of constitutional suffrage campaigns, but never very involved in this work, although she occasionally appeared in support of her sister Jessie who held office in the local branch of the National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies. After the war she was quick to take advantage of the new political climate, seeing this as a way to advance her deep concern for children. In 1920 she became Liverpool's first woman magistrate, selected for her record of work with disadvantaged youngsters. Despite her privileged background she was sympathetic to many of the cases she encountered. She used her position on the probation committee and her philanthropic contacts to establish a working boys' home aimed at giving first offenders a new start in life.<br>
<br>Increasingly Margaret Beavan felt that she needed a more official platform for effective public work. As a result she stood as a council candidate and was elected in 1923 as a Coalition Liberal, although she quickly switched to the Conservatives. Her high public profile and attachment to children's causes made her a popular figure in the council chamber, and in 1927 she was selected as Liverpool's first woman lord mayor. However, despite her personal following and her flair for philanthropy she made a poor politician. She had rejected the option taken by Eleanor Rathbone, Liverpool's first female councillor, to stand as an independent, but in council she continued to fight for single issues with little regard for party lines or her new position as a Conservative representative. Her lack of political astuteness was painfully obvious when she undertook a civic visit to Italy in May 1928. She was greatly impressed by what she perceived as advances in child welfare under Mussolini, and greeted him warmly in Rome.<br>
<br>Such ill-considered actions undermined public confidence. In the May 1929 general election, Beavan stood as a Conservative parliamentary candidate for Everton but was defeated by her Labour opponent. This was the first time she had lost a campaign, and she took it very much to heart. More painfully, she found that her political errors were thrown up against her volunteer workers, damaging the reputation of her children's charities. Although opposition came from all quarters she increasingly blamed local socialists and this, combined with her actions in Italy, made her particularly unpopular among the very classes for whom she had worked so diligently. She died, unmarried, after an attack of influenza, with chest complications, on 22 February 1931 at the Hospital for Children at Leasowe, which she had helped to found, and was buried at Childwall parish church, Liverpool. Her death allowed for some rehabilitation of her reputation at a large civic memorial service. However, the achievements of her public life have never been fully separated from the mistakes of her final years, and she remains an obscure historical figure despite her prominence in Liverpool life.<br>
