<span class="headword">Lines,  Walter</span>  (1882&#150;1972), <span class="occ">toy manufacturer</span>, was born on 10 March 1882 in London, one of the four sons of Joseph Lines, a rocking-horse maker, and his wife, Jane, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Fitzhenry. After education at Owens School until 1896, he joined the family firm of G. and J. Lines, taking evening classes in woodworking and design at the Camden School of Art and the Northern Polytechnic. In 1908 he became the company's managing director. Demobilized after the First World War, in 1922 he married Henriette Hendrey (<i>d</i>. 1970); they had four children.<br>
<br>In 1920 Lines launched his own toy and pram business in partnership with his brothers, William and Arthur. When asked for security against the required bank loan, he simply showed his hands to the bank manager; and there is no doubt that he was a talented toy designer with a good eye for a novelty. His brothers took specific responsibilities for running the firm's purpose-built factory, designed to facilitate mass production, and for selling the products under the famous Triang trade mark. Lines himself had special responsibility for the design department, and was also managing director. His was the public face of Lines Brothers, a vigorous, relatively small man, whose occasionally prickly exterior hid a generous and warm-hearted spirit, not least towards his workforce. In 1933 Lines Brothers, by now the biggest toy manufacturer in Britain with some 1600 employees, became a public company. Numerous acquisitions during this decade, including Hamleys, London's famous toy store, further strengthened the company's prominence in the contemporary toy trade. Lines enjoyed an equally high personal profile. A member of the board of the British Industries fair, he played a major part in creating the Toy and Fancy Goods Federation in 1922, and was chairman of the manufacturers' representatives on the toy trade board. During the Second World War he successfully represented the toy manufacturers in negotiations with the Board of Trade. He took the lead in establishing the new British Toy Manufacturers' Association in 1944, remaining chairman for a decade.<br>
<br>Lines's resignation from the association in 1955 was prompted by a policy disagreement. Thereafter he devoted himself largely to his own company which by the 1950s claimed to be the world's largest toy producer, responsible for 40 per cent of British production and a third of the industry's exports. In the post-war years Lines ensured Triang's continued dominance by opening new manufacturing facilities all over the world, modernizing existing plants, and developing a stream of new products. When he finally retired as chairman in 1962, company profits stood at an all-time record level.<br>
<br>In the longer run, however, Lines's legacy was perhaps less beneficial, and there is some truth in the claim that he was a toy maker first and a businessman second. It was said that he could rarely resist a new idea, and his group was certainly permeated by an ethos which emphasized play value and children's enjoyment, sometimes at the expense of hard economic logic. This did not matter too much in the immediate post-war years but in the later 1960s as the international toy business became increasingly competitive, and as the tariffs protecting the home market were progressively dismantled, Lines Brothers' profits came under pressure. Even as he formally stepped down, commentators were suggesting that the group's business empire was over-extended, its toys increasingly derivative and imitative, and its senior management too inbred (seven of the ten members of the board in the 1950s were family members, including Lines's own two sons). In 1971 the family enterprise which he had made virtually synonymous with the British toy trade went into liquidation. Lines's own enthusiasm for toys remained unabated, however. Restless and still energetic, even in his eighties, he set up a small manufacturing business in his garden shed, which as Good-Wood Toys eventually became a thriving business in its own right. He died at Leigh Place, Godstone, his Surrey home, on 23 November 1972.<br>
