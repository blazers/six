<span class="headword">Ramsbotham,  Francis Henry</span>  (1801&#150;1868), <span class="occ">obstetrician</span>, was born on 9 December 1801 at Richmond, Surrey, son of John Ramsbotham, lecturer on obstetric medicine at the London Hospital and physician to the Royal Maternity Charity, who also had a large obstetric practice in east London. Ramsbotham was educated at St Paul's School and apprenticed to a druggist in Cheapside before he entered in 1818 the London Hospital, and in 1819 Edinburgh University, where he graduated MD in 1822. He became a licentiate of the Royal College of Physicians in 1822, and fellow in 1844. At first his assistant, he eventually succeeded to his father's practice, which he continued successfully for many years. In 1825 the Royal Maternity Charity, the Tower Hamlets Dispensary, and the Eastern Dispensary appointed him their physician. He was obstetric physician and lecturer on obstetric and forensic medicine at the London Hospital from 1854 to 1863. In 1826 he helped to found, and became secretary of, the Obstetric Society of London. He was also president of the Harveian and Hunterian societies, and vice-president of the Pathological Society. At an unknown date he married Mary, daughter of Henry Lindsay of Perth. They had two sons.<br>
<br>As a practitioner Ramsbotham's chief rival was David Daniel Davis, with whom he vied for pre-eminence in English midwifery. Ramsbotham was an enthusiastic and popular teacher, but could be dogmatic, and his fixed opposition to the use of chloroform in childbirth led to a decline in his practice in his later years. Ultimately he moved from New Broad Street to Portman Square, but this failed to lift his professional prospects. Ill health obliged him to relinquish his practice and retire to Wood End, near Perth, the home of his son Francis John, where he died on 7 July 1868.<br>
<br>Ramsbotham's main publication was <span class="italic">The Principles and Practice of Obstetric Medicine and Surgery</span> (1844), a rival to Davis's <span class="italic">Principles and Practice of Obstetric Medicine</span> (1836). Ramsbotham's was one of the first medical books brought out with expensive illustrations, and was very successful, running to many editions in Britain and the USA. He also published two other monographs and journal articles for the medical press, mainly on midwifery.<br>
