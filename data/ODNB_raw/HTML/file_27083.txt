<span class="headword">Taylor,  Thomas</span>  (1576&#150;1632), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, was born at Richmond, Yorkshire, where, according to the account of his life in the 1653 edition of his works, his father was the recorder; both his parents were zealous supporters of the puritan cause. In 1592 he matriculated from Christ's College, Cambridge, where he graduated BA in 1595, proceeded MA in 1598, and was a fellow from 1599 to 1604 and Wentworth Hebrew lecturer from 1601 to 1604. For a time he was probably chaplain to William, Lord Russell of Thornhaugh, to whom in 1606 he dedicated his edition of William Perkins's <span class="italic">Exposition upon &hellip; Jude</span>. Taylor was a prominent member of the group of Perkins's disciples who came to embody the mainstream of moderate puritan divinity in early Stuart Britain. He had entered the pulpit at the age of twenty-one and preached at Paul's Cross before Elizabeth I and James I, but he soon clashed with the emerging anti-Calvinist wing of churchman. At the university church in Cambridge he sharply attacked Archbishop Bancroft's campaign against puritan ministers. Samuel Harsnett, conducting Bancroft's metropolitan visitation in 1608, silenced Taylor and threatened him with degradation.<br>
<br>Taylor left Cambridge, but it is not clear what benefices, if any, he held for the next seventeen years. By 1612 he was preaching at Watford, Hertfordshire, and he also preached frequently at Reading, where from 1616 his younger brother Theophilus was pastor at St Laurence's, and where Taylor himself directed a puritan seminary, &#145;a little nursery of young Preachers&#146;  (&#145;Life&#146;, sig. B2<i>v</i>). He was evidently not without patrons and used what he called his &#145;silent time&#146; for writing, notably his massive <span class="italic">A Commentarie upon &hellip; Titus</span> (1612), published in a second, enlarged edition in 1619. His <span class="italic">Davids Learning</span> (1617) was dedicated to William Knollys, Viscount Wallingford, then master of the court of wards. The dedication, in which Taylor refers to himself as &#145;one who you pleased to favour as a soules Physician&#146;  (sig. A1<i>r</i>), reads like an effort to urge Wallingford back to the protestant cause upheld by his father, the Elizabethan courtier Sir Francis Knollys. Taylor's <span class="italic">Christ's Combat</span> (1618) was dedicated to the courtier's younger son and namesake.<br>
<br>At some point Taylor served as chaplain to Edward Conway, secretary of state from 1623 and later first Viscount Conway. Sharing Conway's anti-Spanish outlook, Taylor spoke out firmly against James I's plans for a Spanish marriage for his heir. Reminding his readers in <span class="italic">A Mappe of Rome</span> (1620) of &#145;how insatiable [Rome] hath alwaies been &hellip; of English Blood&#146;, he could not &#145;thinke we can be so inconsiderate as to dreame of any toleration&#146; for English Catholics  (p. 2). In two sermons, published in 1624 with a bold preface to MPs then in session, he roundly denounced anyone who proposed allying England and Spain, reconciling protestants and Roman Catholics, or advocating moderation towards Catholics anywhere. Their religion consisted of &#145;filthy and formall Idolatry&#146;, and he warned that &#145;whosoever communicates in the sinne of this Westerne Babel&#146; would certainly &#145;drinke of the wine-presse of the wrath of God&#146;  (<span class="italic">Two Sermons</span>, 1624, sigs. E3<i>r</i>, E4<i>r</i>).<br>
<br>In 1625 Taylor accepted a call made on 22 January to be lecturer and curate at St Mary Aldermanbury, London, one of the few city parishes in which the vestry owned the advowson and a rare but potent model &#145;of a congregational polity within the Established Church&#146;  (Seaver, 138). His parishioners there included Conway's son-in-law, Sir Robert Harley, to whom Taylor dedicated his 1630 treatise, <span class="italic">The Progresse of Saints</span>. As in Reading, he kept a puritan seminary, and he continued to be active in the protestant cause. In 1627 Taylor joined William Gouge, Richard Sibbes, and John Davenport in an effort to raise funds to relieve the Palatinate's Calvinist preachers. In 1628 they were reprimanded by the court of high commission and the new bishop of London, William Laud, for this meddling in affairs of state. However, the same year efforts by the anti-Calvinist Bishop Matthew Wren of Ely to block the grant of Taylor's Cambridge DD were defeated, probably with help from Conway.<br>
<br>Although in his many published works Taylor was indeed &#145;an iron pillar and a brazen wall against Popery and Arminianisme&#146;  (&#145;Life&#146;, sig. B3<i>r</i>), his opposition to separatism and antinomianism was no less vigorous. Admitting that the Church of England was not &#145;free from all blemish and spotte&#146;, he nevertheless insisted that whoever doubted that &#145;in our assemblies wee have God present teaching his people&#146; is &#145;as blinde as a Mole, and palpably deluded&#146;  (T. Taylor, <span class="italic">The Beawties of Beth-El</span>, 1609, 80&#150;81). His much admired <span class="italic">Regula vitae</span> (1635) opposed &#145;our new audacious Antinomists, and Libertines, and Familists&#146; because he found some members of his own flock &#145;looking that way&#146;  (sigs. A4<i>v</i>&#150;A5<i>r</i>). Wood called Taylor &#145;an illuminated doctor&#146; for his skill at &#145;opening an allegory&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>: <span class="italic">Fasti</span>, 1.457): his <span class="italic">Christ Revealed</span> (1635)&#151;republished in 1653 as <span class="italic">Moses and Aaron</span>&#151;was an early manual of typology that influenced many English and North American theologians in the seventeenth century. Taylor was liberal with charitable gifts &#145;without sounding of the Trumpet&#146;  (&#145;True relation&#146;, sig. A4<i>r</i>); in 1629 he had given &pound;15 to the aldermen and burgesses of his birthplace &#145;to be laid out yearly in coals for the use of the poor people&#146;  (C. Clarkson, <span class="italic">The History of Richmond</span>, 1814, 208). His will, made on 8 February 1631 when he was in good health, made careful provision for his wife, Anne, for his sons, Francis and Samuel, for his four daughters, for several siblings, and for the poor of St Mary Aldermanbury. He died of pleurisy in 1632 (his will was proved by his widow on 15 May) but went to his grave &#145;much cheered in his spirits for the great successes&#146; of Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden against the Habsburgs  (&#145;Life&#146;, sig. B3<i>v</i>). He was buried at St Mary Aldermanbury after a funeral sermon preached by William Jemmat, Taylor's former assistant at Reading and the editor of several of his works, including <span class="italic">Christ's Victorie over the Dragon</span> (1633) and <span class="italic">Christ Revealed, or, The Old Testament Explained</span> (1635). In 1653 Edmund Calamy and eleven other leading puritan ministers brought out the first of several collections of Taylor's works (including previously unpublished ones), noting that &#145;the iniquity of the former times&#146; had denied &#145;such births &hellip; a kindly delivery&#146;  (ibid., sig. B1<i>v</i>).<br>
