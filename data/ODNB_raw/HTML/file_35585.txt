<span class="headword">Potter,  Stephen Meredith</span>  (1900&#150;1969), <span class="occ">writer and radio producer</span>, was born on 1 February 1900 at 36 Old Park Avenue, Battersea, London, the only son of Frank Collard Potter (1858&#150;1939), chartered accountant, and his wife, Elizabeth Mary Jubilee (Lilla) Reynolds (1863&#150;1950), who named Potter after George Meredith, whom she was reading while pregnant. He was educated at Clapham high school, Rillo Road preparatory school, and Westminster School, where he did not excel but where, he proudly relates, he &#145;won the pancake&#146;  (Potter) in the annual Shrove Tuesday contest the Greaze, where boys fight to catch a pancake. He left just in time to be trained and gazetted as a second lieutenant in the Coldstream Guards before demobilization returned him to civilian life in 1919. After a few uneasy months in his father's office learning bookkeeping he followed his sister Muriel to Oxford, where he took a second in English language and literature in 1922 at Merton College. In what he called &#145;Shakespeare's missing years&#146; he taught at a private boys' school and for a time he acted as secretary to the playwright Henry Arthur Jones, until in 1926 he was appointed a lecturer in English at Birkbeck College, London.<br>
<br>On 7 July 1927 Potter married Marian Anderson Attenborough (1900&#150;1981), the painter, professionally known as <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/38336/', "Mary Potter")</script> and by Potter himself as Att; they had two sons. Potter's first book, <span class="italic">The Young Man</span> (1929), was the inevitable autobiographical novel and caused little stir. In 1930 he published a good short study of D. H. Lawrence, then turned his attention to Coleridge, editing the Nonesuch Press <span class="italic">Coleridge</span> (1933) and Sara Coleridge's letters to Thomas Poole in <span class="italic">Minnow among Tritons</span> (1934). In 1941 he wrote a play, <span class="italic">Married to a Genius</span>, based on the Coleridge marriage. His main work on the subject, and his most important critical book, <span class="italic">Coleridge and S.T.C.</span> (1935), was an acute discussion of the duality in the poet's nature. In 1937 he published <span class="italic">The Muse in Chains: a Study in Education</span>, a humorous attack on the way English was taught in universities. G. M. Young wrote of it: &#145;if I were suddenly commissioned by some Golden Dustman to organize a new University, I think I should send for Mr. Potter and offer him the Chair of English literature forthwith&#146;  (<span class="italic">Daylight and Champaign</span>, 1937, 130).<br>
<br>All seemed set for a distinguished career as teacher and critic, but marriage and children made financial demands which these pursuits could not resolve, and in 1938 Potter joined the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) as a writer&#150;producer in the features department (later he became editor of features and poetry). His broadcasting career was long and increasingly successful. Literary features and war documentaries occupied him initially; then in 1943 appeared the first of twenty-nine &#145;How&#146; programmes, written with Joyce Grenfell. They dealt satirically with everyday subjects, such as &#145;How to Talk to Children&#146;, &#145;How to Woo&#146;, &#145;How to Give a Party&#146;; and in 1946 &#145;How to Listen to Radio&#146; was the first broadcast heard in the newly created Third Programme (later Radio 3).<br>
<br>Potter's light touch did a great deal to move radio features on from a rather static form of presentation to an impressionism with natural dialogue and minimal use of sound-effects which was lively, immediate, imaginative, and vivid. Particularly successful were his series of <span class="italic">Professional Portraits</span>, and <span class="italic">New Judgments</span>, as well as the broadcast of Nevill Coghill's version of <span class="italic">The Canterbury Tales</span>. As a radio producer Stephen Potter was clear and unfussy, inspiring confidence and enthusiasm.<br>
<br>In 1945 Potter did a stint as theatre critic for the <span class="italic">New Statesman and Nation</span>, and in 1946 a year as book critic on the <span class="italic">News Chronicle</span>. He was also an occasional and useful member of the BBC <span class="italic">Critics</span> panel. When he had enjoyed the subject under discussion he said so, in refreshing contrast to the superior and grudging assessments of some of his colleagues.<br>
<br>A ten-day power-cut at the beginning of 1947 cancelled all broadcasting and gave Potter the opportunity to dash off, on odd scraps of paper, the book which gave a new word to the language and a new concept to the whole world of sport. This was <span class="italic">The Theory and Practice of Gamesmanship, or, The Art of Winning Games without Actually Cheating</span>, published in November 1947. In it he described how the idea crystallized when he and his friend C. E. M. Joad managed to defeat at tennis two younger and more agile opponents, by subtle and entirely legal ploys which put them off their game. Potter left the BBC after the success of the book, and apart from a short term as editor of <span class="italic">The Leader</span> magazine, which folded in 1950, he now faced the prospect of being a full-time writer. From <span class="italic">Gamesmanship</span> the idea was extended to many other aspects of life. <span class="italic">Some Notes on Lifemanship</span> (1950) was followed by <span class="italic">One-Upmanship</span> (1952) and <span class="italic">Supermanship</span> (1958). By this time the concept and the suffix &#145;-manship&#146; had travelled the world (Potter himself toured America in 1950), and the foreign policy of the American secretary of state John Foster Dulles was universally known as &#145;brinkmanship&#146;. Fowler's <span class="italic">Modern English Usage</span> notes that Potter invented &#145;the conceit of making facetious formations by treating -manship as the suffix&#146;. For Potter the joke was played out, but for the rest of his life he found it difficult to speak or write naturally, so accustomed had he grown to the jocose gambits and ploys of his own invention.<br>
<br>Potter's first marriage was dissolved in 1955 and on 20 May of that year he married Heather Jenner, director of a marriage bureau, whom he had met while editor of <span class="italic">The Leader</span>. They had one son who died aged sixteen. A book on his lecture tour of America appeared in 1956 and then <span class="italic">Steps to Immaturity</span> (1959), an attractive evocation of his Edwardian boyhood and Georgian schooldays. His choice of title showed a disarming self-awareness, for in many ways he never grew up, and always seemed an immensely likeable overgrown boy. He was such an obsessive games player (squash, tennis, golf, croquet, and always snooker at the Savile Club) that his friends wondered how he managed to do any work at all. Later, and minor, publications included an anthology, <span class="italic">Sense of Humour</span> (1954), and <span class="italic">The Complete Golf Gamesmanship</span> (1968).<br>
<br>Potter was tall and rangy, with rough fair hair which stood on end in spite of absent-minded attempts to dampen and flatten it. In a memorial broadcast Roy Plomley said: &#145;There was something very special about his trousers. Some men have the kind of hips which keep a waist-band neatly in place: Stephen hadn't.&#146; He smoked in a perilous manner, disregarding ashtrays. On 2 December 1969 Potter died at 11 Fellows Road, Hampstead, London, of pneumonia, after suffering bad health for the last few years of his life.<br>
