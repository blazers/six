<span class="headword">Rodgers,  William Robert</span>  (1909&#150;1969), <span class="occ">poet and broadcaster</span>, was born on 1 August 1909 at 76 Belmont Avenue, east Belfast, the son of Robert Skelly Rodgers (1856&#150;1953), an insurance agent, and his wife, Jane Ferris McCarey (1871&#150;1952). Known as Bertie, Rodgers had a twin sister, Reah, and younger sister, Jean. His parents were strict Presbyterians. In <span class="italic">Essex Roundabout</span> (1963) Rodgers recalls and relishes his childhood Belfast: &#145;City of ships and shawlies, doles and doilies, mills and tills, piety and porter&#146;  (p. 44). He attended Ballymacarrett public elementary school (1915&#150;23), but his parents were uninterested in providing him with a more extensive education unless he agreed to be a clergyman. He did so, and a crammer prepared him for matriculation at Queen's University, Belfast, where he took a second-class honours degree in English (1927&#150;31). He trained for the Presbyterian ministry at Assembly's Theological College, Belfast. In 1935 he was ordained and appointed minister of Cloveneden church, Loughgall, co. Armagh. On 30 March 1935 he married Mary (Marie) Harden Waddell (1909&#150;1953), niece of the author Helen Waddell. Marie, a doctor with unfulfilled literary ambitions, set up a surgery in Loughgall. The couple had a stillborn son and two daughters, Harden (<i>b</i>. 1938) and Nini (<i>b</i>. 1940). The couple's marriage was full of unresolvable conflict. Rodgers's anguished poems &#145;Paired Lives&#146; and &#145;The Lovers&#146; refer to &#145;resentment&#146;. Marie's brilliance masked instability and suicidal urges, and in 1943 she was diagnosed schizophrenic.<br>
<br>Rodgers began writing poetry in 1938. His dust jacket note on <span class="italic">Awake! and other Poems</span> (1941), whose original print run was destroyed in the blitz, mentions another retarding factor: &#145;I was schooled in a backwater of literature out of sight of the running stream of contemporary verse.&#146; Yet it was a well-read Belfast contemporary, the poet John Hewitt, who introduced him to the work of W. H. Auden, Dylan Thomas, and others. Louis MacNeice became an intimate friend, and Rodgers soon made literary friends in southern Ireland. <span class="italic">Awake!</span>, a much praised d&eacute;but, identifies language with liberation and intense sensation. &#145;Words&#146; celebrates &#145;the arriving winds of words&#146;, and poetry may have &#145;arrived&#146; as a psychic release from the intertwined tensions of Rodgers's marriage and ministry.<br>
<br>Rodgers resisted the puritanical strain in Presbyterian culture. His &#145;Epilogue&#146; to <span class="italic">The Character of Ireland</span>, co-edited with MacNeice and famous for being unfinished, says:<blockquote>
<div>I &hellip; Was heir to all that Adamnation<br>
</div>
<div>And hand-me-down of doom<br>
</div> (W. R. Rodgers, <span class="italic">Collected Poems</span>, 1971, 148)</blockquote>Yet, as he knew, Calvinism induces eloquence as well as repression (hence his affinity with Dylan Thomas's pyrotechnics). &#145;Epilogue&#146; both evokes and echoes the:<blockquote>
<div class="indent">old sea-roar and surge<br>
</div>
<div>Of rhetoric and Holy Writ.<br>
</div>
</blockquote>Rodgers's sermons were legendary, and his remarkable rapport with his congregation was only once disturbed&#151;by his article &#145;Black north&#146;. Here he said bluntly: &#145;the unionist government has not sought for better relations between Protestant and Catholic, but has &hellip; used ill relations in order to keep power&#146;  (<span class="italic">New Statesman</span>, 20 Nov 1943). Rodgers never wrote so politically again, and his thinking about Northern Irish culture could lean to stereotype or euphemism. This applies to his British Council pamphlet <span class="italic">The Ulstermen and their Country</span> (1947) which calls protestant and Catholic &#145;complementary&#146;: &#145;One is thoughtful and individual, the other is emotional and communal &hellip; It is this diversity and interplay of opposites that makes Ulster life such a rich and fascinating spectacle&#146;  (pp. 15&#150;18). Rodgers's work, however, was genuinely enriched by Ulster voices, stories, images, customs, and folklore, as in his best-known radio features <span class="italic">Armagh: the City Set on a Hill</span> (1945) and <span class="italic">The Return Room</span> (1955). He sympathized with the literary &#145;regionalism&#146; which Hewitt advocated, and was close to the Belfast writer&#150;broadcasters Sam Hanna Bell and John Boyd. Rodgers's vision for Ulster and Ireland was generously inclusive.<br>
<br>In 1946 Rodgers resigned his ministry to join the BBC in London, having been recruited by Louis MacNeice for the features department. The department's head, Laurence Gilliam, believed that creative radio depended on creative writers. Meanwhile Marie went to Edinburgh to practise psychoanalysis, and worked thereafter in Scotland. The children stayed behind with three &#145;aunts&#146; (cousins of Marie's father). The couple were divorced in January 1953. In July that year Marie collapsed by the sea at Newcastle, co. Down, where her daughters were holidaying, and died on the 16th of cardiac and respiratory failure. According to his second wife Rodgers interpreted her death as &#145;a coming together of tragic events&#146;  (unpublished letter).<br>
<br>On 28 September 1953 Rodgers married Marianne Gilliam, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Helweg (1914&#150;1976), a Danish researcher and translator for BBC radio, and the former wife of Laurence Gilliam. After Rodgers's affair with Marianne had been made public, Louis MacNeice, distressed by the breach between Rodgers and Gilliam, his two friends and colleagues, advised Rodgers to leave the BBC's permanent staff. From 1954 Rodgers and Marianne lived in East Anglia; their daughter Lucy was born in 1956. Rodgers continued working for radio, and, despite financial insecurity, he pursued his most innovative radio project, published as <span class="italic">Irish Literary Portraits</span> (1972). These programmes (1949&#150;66) pioneered oral literary history and a form of sound montage renowned as &#145;the Rodgers technique&#146;. Rodgers introduced his composite portraits of W. B. Yeats and others as &#145;really studies in relationship&#146;, so &#145;a &#147;lie&#148; therefore could be as informative as the &#147;truth&#148;, and the myth as substantial as the reality&#146;  (Rodgers, <span class="italic">Irish Literary Portraits</span>, xiii).<br>
<br>Rodgers was a great talker who got great talk out of others. His soft voice had immense charm, as had his large brown eyes, sensuous features, dapper dress, and old-fashioned courtesy. But talk, especially pub talk, and procrastination may have blocked his poetry. After <span class="italic">Europa and the Bull and other Poems</span> (1952) he wrote few poems. His <span class="italic">Collected Poems</span> (1971) appeared posthumously. Yet the sources of Rodgers's silence were complex. He was writer-in-residence at Pitzer College, Claremont, California, from 1966 to 1968. His biographer Darcy O'Brien portrayed his years there negatively, but this view has been questioned. It was a financial lifebelt for Rodgers, and Hewitt criticized O'Brien for &#145;forcing his story &hellip; to fit the Dylan Thomas, Brendan Behan archetype, the exile-poet drowning in drink&#146;  (unpublished letter).<br>
<br>In autumn 1967, when visiting England, Rodgers had two operations for bowel cancer. The illness recurred in November 1968 after he had begun a lectureship at California State Polytechnic College. He died on 1 February 1969 in Los Angeles County General Hospital. His ashes were buried at Cloveneden Presbyterian church, Loughgall, on 7 March.<br>
<br>Owing to his poetic silence, in his later years W. R. Rodgers's reputation declined, but his achievement was brought into focus by a younger generation of poets from Northern Ireland. Along with MacNeice, Hewitt, and Patrick Kavanagh, he influenced Derek Mahon, Seamus Heaney (who read at his funeral), and Michael Longley, who edited <span class="italic">Selected Poems</span> (1993). Longley makes comparisons with John Donne, and calls Rodgers &#145;a latterday metaphysical who apprehends the divine through the senses, The Word through words&#146;  (p. 21). Rodgers's style is sometimes too alliteratively word-drunk. But his most vital rhythms have a special power to suggest earthly desire and heavenly fulfilment. His love poem &#145;The Net&#146; begins:<blockquote>
<div>Quick, woman in your net<br>
</div>
<div>Catch the silver I fling!<br>
</div>
</blockquote>His religious poem &#145;The Journey of the Magi&#146; ends: &#145;The journey's done. Lord, Lord, how sweet!&#146;  (W. R. Rodgers, <span class="italic">Collected Poems</span>, 1971, 84, 119).<br>
