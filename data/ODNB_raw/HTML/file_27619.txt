<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Townshend,  Charles</span>  (1725&#150;1767), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born on 27 August 1725, the second of the four sons and one daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27618/', "Charles Townshend, third Viscount Townshend (1700&#150;1764)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27617/', "Townshend, Charles, second Viscount Townshend")</script>], politician, and his wife, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/68358/', "Etheldreda Townshend (c.1708&#150;1788)")</script>, the daughter of Edward Harrison of Balls Park, Hertfordshire, and his wife, Frances Bray. It was not a stable family background, for his parents were as promiscuous sexually as he was to be politically, and they separated in 1741. Charles, then aged fifteen, sided with his father and saw little of his mother for the next decade. As if this were not trauma enough, he was perpetually dogged by ill health&#151;&#145;my crazy constitution&#146;; modern diagnosis has identified epilepsy as his chief ailment. He was intended by his father for the bar, whereas his elder brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27624/', "George Townshend, later fourth Viscount and first Marquess Townshend")</script>, was set on a military career. In 1742 Charles both entered at Lincoln's Inn and went to Clare College, Cambridge. After three years in Cambridge he spent a year at Leiden University, the leading centre for the study of Roman law, and then returned for a year in residence at Lincoln's Inn; he was called to the bar in 1747. His relationship with his bullying and parsimonious father was an unhappy one. A letter written when he was twenty shows Charles being driven to defend his weekly game of real tennis as &#145;more an exercise necessary for my health than as a diversion&#146;  (Namier and Brooke, 6), having given up cricket because his father deemed it a waste of time and money. His father was constantly complaining of what Charles cost him, and Charles early acquired the habit of making assurances he would not fulfil.<h2>
<a name="Politicalapprenticeship17471760"></a>Political apprenticeship, 1747&#150;1760</h2>At the general election of 1747 Townshend was returned to parliament for Great Yarmouth, a borough where his family had considerable influence. He first had to assure his father that he would not be diverted from a legal career, a promise from which he was released within a year on grounds of ill health. The political stage beckoned. The Townshend family was at the heart of the whig aristocratic oligarchy, and his paternal grandmother a half-sister of the then prime minister, Henry Pelham, and his brother the duke of Newcastle, who was wont to refer to Charles Townshend as his nephew. In 1748 Lord Townshend asked Newcastle to give Townshend a seat on the Board of Admiralty. That was aiming too high for a first ministerial post, and he had to settle for a seat at the Board of Trade and Plantations in 1749. Here he soon won the favour of Lord Halifax, president of the board, and industriously acquired a knowledge of commercial and colonial matters. His spell at the Board of Trade was the time when he formulated the opinions on America he sought to enact as chancellor of the exchequer. It was Townshend who in 1753 drafted instructions to the governor of New York directing that colony's assembly to make permanent financial provision for official salaries. Here was the germ of the idea behind his revenue duties of 1767, the financial independence from assemblies of colonial administrators and judges, as the key to the maintenance of British control. That was not an idea unique to Townshend, but one he always kept in mind.<br>
<br>As yet Townshend made no mark in parliament. The diarist Horace Walpole later recalled that &#145;Townshend's speeches for four or five years gave little indication of his amazing parts. They were studied, pedantic&#146;  (<span class="italic">Last Journals of Horace Walpole</span>, 1.82), usually on departmental business. Not until 1753 did Townshend shine in debate, opposing the <span class="roman">Marriage Act</span> by championing from his own experience the cause of children against parents. His long and witty speech led Walpole to take note of the:<blockquote>young man of unbounded ambition, of exceeding application, and, as it now appeared, of abilities capable of satisfying that ambition, and of not wanting that application &hellip; His figure was tall and advantageous, his action vehement, his voice loud, his laugh louder. (Walpole, <span class="italic">Memoirs of &hellip; George II</span>, 1.340&#150;41)</blockquote>At the ministerial reshuffle of 1754, when Newcastle succeeded his deceased brother as prime minister, Townshend sought a seat on the Treasury board, again aiming a rung too high, and had to settle for one at the Admiralty board. Then came the turning point of his life in a political as well as personal sense&#151;his marriage on 18 September 1755 to Lady Caroline Scott, styled Lady Dalkeith (1717&#150;1794) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/64081/', "Townshend, Caroline, suo jure Baroness Greenwich")</script>], the eldest daughter of the late <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/4513/', "John Campbell, second duke of Argyll and first duke of Greenwich (1680&#150;1743)")</script>, and his wife, Jane Warburton. She was the widow of Francis Scott, styled earl of Dalkeith (1721&#150;1750), politician, and the mother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/24875/', "Henry Scott, third duke of Buccleuch")</script>. Apart from considerable expectations, she was already a wealthy woman, possessing a net income of &pound;3000 besides a personal estate of &pound;46,000, out of which she proposed to settle &pound;30,000 on Townshend. The couple had three children: two sons, Charles and William, who both died as unmarried army officers, and a daughter, Anne, twice married. It was the political import of the marriage that caught Horace Walpole's attention: &#145;Charles Townshend marries the great Dowager Dalkeith. His parts and presumption are prodigious. He wanted nothing but independence to let him loose&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters of Horace Walpole</span>, 3.321). For Townshend financial security now begat political volatility.<br>
<br>Within a month of his marriage Townshend, hitherto an undoubted ministerial supporter, was rated as &#145;doubtful&#146; by Newcastle. His new independence coincided with unease over recent cabinet decisions, and not even an offer by the duke of a place on the Treasury board could cement his allegiance. Townshend shared the concern of Pitt about Newcastle's European-orientated policy, contrasting it with the apparent neglect of America. Pitt's dismissal from office was soon followed by his own in the Christmas recess. When parliament reassembled in early 1756 Townshend adopted the American viewpoint, denouncing the defenceless state of the colonies. His displays of verbal pyrotechnics, replete with epigrams and satire, were much admired, and that, according to Walpole's reflections on the session, was their sole purpose: &#145;Neither caring whether himself or others were in the right, [he] only spoke to show how well he could adorn a bad cause, or demolish a good one&#146;  (Walpole, <span class="italic">Memoirs of &hellip; George II</span>, 2.147).<br>
<br>That Townshend, despite his evident talents, was not taken seriously meant that he could be left out of the political reckoning. When Pitt formed a new ministry after the fall of Newcastle in the autumn of 1756, he was the conspicuous exception in not being given active political employment, and was fobbed off with the court post of treasurer of the chamber. Lord Waldegrave, a royal confidant, noted that &#145;Pitt did not choose to advance a young man to a ministerial office, whose abilities were of the same kind, and so nearly equal to his own&#146;  (<span class="italic">Memoirs and Speeches</span>, 186). Since the Townshend family's hold on Yarmouth had become uncertain, Townshend's re-election on receiving office was for the Admiralty-controlled borough of Saltash. Antipathy to Pitt naturally ensued, as Waldegrave noted: &#145;Charles Townshend hated Pitt, and disliked his employment which was merely a sinecure&#146;  (ibid., 195). During the political manoeuvres of 1757 that were designed to exclude Pitt from office, Townshend was talked of as a possible secretary at war, but he deemed it unwise to join in such an unpopular scheme, and so retained his court office throughout the Pitt&#150;Newcastle coalition ministry that won the Seven Years' War. He became reconciled to Newcastle by 1758, when the duke became godfather to his first son. The next year a possible appointment arose for Townshend as chancellor of the exchequer in a ministerial reshuffle. Newcastle commented to his crony Lord Hardwicke on 31 August 1759: &#145;if Charles Townshend had not such a character, I would make him Chancellor of the Exchequer at once, but there is no depending upon him, and his character will not go down in the City nor anywhere else&#146;  (Namier and Brooke, 59). The former lord chancellor agreed: &#145;That office should be filled by somebody who may in a particular manner be depended upon, of some gravity, known veracity, whose word may be taken and relied on&#146;  (ibid.). No changes of office took place in 1759, and Townshend remained becalmed in the political doldrums until the death of George II in 1760.<h2>
<a name="Theshuttlecockofpolitics17601766"></a>The shuttlecock of politics, 1760&#150;1766</h2>Townshend meanwhile had acquired some degree of favour at the court of the prince of Wales, and, following the latter's accession as George III, the new king's favourite, Lord Bute, included him as one of three stipulated nominations for office. Townshend &#145;had sworn allegiance to him, <i>for a time</i>&#146;, so he said  (<span class="italic">Political Journal of &hellip; Dodington</span>, 414). He accordingly became secretary at war in March 1761, and at the king's behest was given the safe Treasury borough of Harwich. But, before the new parliament met in November, Townshend had taken umbrage at George Grenville's being appointed leader of the House of Commons instead of himself, after the resignation of Pitt in the previous month. He annoyed Bute and the king by implicit criticisms of ministerial policy, notably by warm support for continuing British participation in the German campaign, a strategy favoured by Pitt rather than Bute. Townshend, when introducing the army estimates on 9 December, even commended &#145;Mr Pitt's divine plan&#146;  (Walpole, <span class="italic">Memoirs of &hellip; George III</span>, 1.79). He then fell into line, and during the first half of 1762 maintained a low political profile, devoting himself to the work of the war office, a busy department. But by midsummer he was quarrelling with Bute over army appointments, and threatening resignation, a step the king would have welcomed, as he wrote to Bute on 15 July:<blockquote>I fancy though that he will think bullying not the way to get anything but the loss of his employment. Besides his character is so very bad that I believe nothing would strengthen the opinion of the present government in the eyes of the public so much as that vermin being against it. (<span class="italic">Letters &hellip; to Lord Bute</span>, 120)</blockquote>Townshend did not resign, and by October, when Grenville had been replaced by Henry Fox to carry the peace terms through parliament, George III was coupling Townshend and Fox as the two men to accomplish that task, but at the same time he denounced as absurd an idea of rewarding him with Grenville's post as secretary of state. Townshend himself for a while aspired to become president of the Board of Trade, but in the end he chose to retain the war office. He was included in ministerial consultations on the peace terms, but simultaneously was assuring Newcastle, now in opposition, that he would not support Fox in parliament, and he certainly thought that Britain had not obtained enough concessions. Townshend at this time justified his behaviour as that of an independent man, without political connections, judging policies on their merits:<blockquote>It is my firm resolution to act the part of a man of business and a man of honour; to be decided by things and not men; to have no party; to follow no leader; and to be governed absolutely by my own judgement. (Namier and Brooke, 77)</blockquote>That he could, as he did in this reflection on 10 November, regard his behaviour as consistent was remarkable self-deception. A less complimentary opinion was penned on 19 October by Richard Rigby, reporting events to the peace envoy in Paris, the duke of Bedford: &#145;Charles Townshend, that splendid shuttlecock, veers about with all these different gales. He laughs at the ministry at night and assures them in the morning that he is entirely theirs&#146;  (ibid., 75).<br>
<br>The next twist in Townshend's career was his sudden resignation from the war office on 8 December 1762, the day before the great House of Commons debate on the peace. He then confounded expectations by defending the terms of the peace in a speech highly rated by friend and foe. The explanation of this double somersault was that he had been afraid of a direct confrontation with Pitt. That fear vanished when Pitt left the house immediately after his own speech, when Townshend made what cynics thought was the second of two alternative speeches he had prepared. Townshend, being out of office, was now courted by Newcastle, but in vain, for the ministry perceived he was the opposition's last parliamentary hope&#151;Pitt having disavowed any alliance with the duke. Early in 1763 Townshend accepted Bute's offer to be president of the Board of Trade, a post he desired through his concern over growing colonial disregard of British authority. His brief tenure of the post, from mid-February to early April, was notable for the first specific proposal of a colonial tax, to meet the promises made on 4 March by the new secretary at war, that America would in future pay its own army costs. On 18 March Townshend moved that this money should be raised by converting into a revenue duty of 2<i>d</i>. the existing 1733 prohibitory duty of 6<i>d</i>. a gallon on foreign molasses, a sugar product used to make rum. That would allow, he said, legal importation into North America of a commodity notoriously being smuggled. The ensuing legislation, regarded with dismay as premature by George III and Bute, was killed by a procedural device on 30 March.<br>
<br>Townshend's spell as president of the Board of Trade was cut short by a change of ministry consequent on Bute's decision to resign. The king's intention was that Townshend would be promoted to the Admiralty, a cabinet post vacated by Grenville's elevation to the Treasury. The motives for this change were twofold: the danger of leaving the uncontrollable Townshend in such a sensitive post when American issues would be in the forefront of attention; and a desire to provide for Lord Shelburne, a prot&eacute;g&eacute; of Bute but too young for a cabinet post. Townshend, ignorant of the overall plan, was offered the Admiralty on 7 April, and stated his wish to remain at the Board of Trade. On 14 April the king personally persuaded him into accepting the Admiralty: as part of the bargain George III agreed to fulfil a promise of Lord Bute that Lady Dalkeith would be given her father's lapsed British peerage title of Greenwich, with reversion to her male heirs by Townshend. The next day, however, Townshend demanded of the king a seat at the Admiralty board for a friend, Peter Burrell, only to be told that he was too late and to be reminded that he had previously accepted the Admiralty without any such condition. Townshend obstinately refused to give way, and found himself out of the ministry, for Shelburne had already been appointed to the Board of Trade.<br>
<br>For two years Townshend was out of office, but never out of consideration for it. Pitt put him down for secretary of state in his ministerial plan of August 1763, a gesture for which Townshend was long grateful. He was thought of for, but not offered, the Admiralty in September, when his brother George reported to Prime Minister Grenville that Charles seemed determined to continue in opposition. George Townshend, after an active military career, had now entered politics himself, as a courtier supporting the successive ministries of Grenville, Rockingham, and Chatham in the post of lieutenant-general of the ordnance. His political estrangement from Charles continued until 1765. By the autumn of 1763 Charles Townshend was involved in opposition consultations, and spoke frequently against government in debates on the first Wilkes case of general warrants. He was regarded by Newcastle as his colonial expert, but missed the American debates of 1764 for a variety of reasons, including his father's death on 12 March. By the end of the session, dismayed by Pitt's absence from parliament, Townshend was preparing to desert Newcastle. During the recess of 1764 he both wrote opposition propaganda and sounded out Grenville about joining his ministry. After parliament reassembled in 1765 Townshend began to speak for the government, most famously in support of Grenville's <span class="roman">American Stamp Bill</span> on 6 February, when the Connecticut agent Jasper Mauduit ascribed to him this peroration:<blockquote>And now will these Americans, children planted by our care, nourished up by our indulgence until they are grown to a degree of strength and opulence, and protected by our arms, will they grudge to contribute their mite to relieve us from the heavy weight of that burden which we lie under? (Namier and Brooke, 129)</blockquote>On 3 March Townshend had a private interview with Grenville at the house of his brother George, now Lord Townshend, and his public transfer of allegiance was demonstrated by a speech on the <span class="roman">Regency Bill</span> on 12 May. Townshend became paymaster-general on 24 May, at a time when George III was already seeking to rid himself of the Grenville ministry. Simultaneously he was being listed for ministerial office in an incoming administration to be formed by Newcastle's friends under Lord Rockingham. In early July he was pressed to become chancellor of the exchequer in that ministry, even by George III himself, but chose to retain the pay office and declined to attend cabinet. He failed to support the ministerial repeal of the <span class="roman">Stamp Act</span> in debate.<h2>
<a name="ChancelloroftheexchequerIndiaandAmerica"></a>Chancellor of the exchequer: India and America</h2>Townshend's hour came when Pitt was called upon to form a ministry in July 1766. He named the duke of Grafton to the Treasury, and insisted that Townshend should be his chancellor of the exchequer. Townshend was reluctant to exchange his lucrative post at the pay office, worth &pound;7000, for one involving much drudgery and with a salary of only &pound;2500, but was bullied into acceptance by Pitt. Although he did succeed in raising his office to cabinet rank, Pitt, now to become earl of Chatham, retained Henry Conway as leader of the Commons, as he had been under Rockingham, since he was a much more respected figure than Townshend. But as debaters there was no comparison between them. The great Irish parliamentarian Henry Flood opined after hearing a debate on 25 November 1766 that there was &#145;no one person near Townshend. He is the orator; the rest are speakers&#146;  (<span class="italic">Correspondence of William Pitt</span>, 3.144n).<br>
<br>Illness prevented Chatham giving a lead to his administration, a situation of which the irrepressible, irresponsible Townshend took full advantage, when the ministry faced problems in India and America. The recent acquisition of Bengal by the East India Company raised the linked questions of ownership of that territory and allocation of the anticipated revenue of &pound;2 million. The view of Chatham was that the crown possessed the sovereign authority, and should therefore claim the lion's share of the revenue. But Townshend and Conway, his chief Commons spokesmen, both championed the rights of the company, and Chatham's prolonged ill health early in 1767 allowed them to thwart his policy in a divided cabinet. On 4 March Chatham was driven to offer Townshend's post to Lord North, whose refusal only strengthened Townshend's hand. Even the revelation that Townshend had a pecuniary motive did not destroy his position. By the spring it was known that the chancellor of the exchequer had been successfully speculating in East India stock, and with government money too, left temporarily in his hands from the pay office. Walpole wrote on 19 March that the secret was out:<blockquote>Charles Townshend's tergivisations appear to have been the result of private jobbing. He had dealt largely in India stock, cried up the Company's right to raise that stock, has sold out most advantageously, and now cries it down. What! and can a Chancellor of the Exchequer stand such an aspersion? Oh, my dear Sir, his character cannot be lowered. (<span class="italic">Letters of Horace Walpole</span>, 7.97)</blockquote>Having made over &pound;7000 for himself Townshend was now concerned to obtain good terms for the state. This he achieved by avoiding controversy over legal rights and instead pragmatically negotiating with the company an annual payment of &pound;400,000. The ministry coerced the company by legislation to limit its dividend, and a debate over the measure on 8 May was the occasion for Townshend's famous &#145;champagne speech&#146;. Contemporaries differed on how far he was drunk and his speech unpremeditated. &#145;It lasted an hour&#146;, Walpole wrote, &#145;with torrents of wit, ridicule, vanity, lies, and beautiful language&#146;. Townshend hit targets all round the political spectrum, including the crown:<blockquote>Government, he said, must not continue to be what he himself was always called, a weathercock. Nobody but he could have made that speech, and nobody but he would have made [it], if they could. It was at once a proof that his abilities were superior to those of all men, and his judgement below that of any man. It showed him capable of being, and unfit to be, First Minister. (ibid., 7.105&#150;6)</blockquote>America was simultaneously under consideration together with India, and it is for his taxation of the colonies that Townshend is above all remembered by posterity. At the time much ministerial attention was also paid to coercion of New York for its defiance of the 1765 <span class="roman">Mutiny Act</span>, and it was Townshend's suggestion of preventing that colony's assembly from enacting any legislation until it was willing to pay army costs that was adopted by the cabinet. That was the most moderate of three measures under consideration, adopted in preference to coercive billeting and direct taxation, and it strengthened Townshend's repeated claim to be a friend of America. His taxation plan might seem to invalidate that contention, but long-standing historical myths have clouded the picture. The principle of colonial taxation was always accepted by the Chatham ministry. That Townshend was premature in his announcement, and personally involved in the detailed enactment, has led to his being given full responsibility for the &#145;Townshend duties&#146;. His personal contribution was not the imposition of American taxation as such, but alteration of the aim from the initial purpose of paying for the army there to the scheme he had suggested in 1753, and again in 1754, of freeing colonial government from financial dependence on the assemblies. The mode of taxation he adopted was the imposition of colonial import duties, thereby exploiting the supposed American distinction of internal and external taxes. After Chatham's failure to replace him on 4 March, Townshend was able to impose his views on the cabinet. It would seem that no contemporary perceived that, since government in America was already financed by the colonial assemblies, Townshend's plan would not save the British taxpayer any money. The eventual targets for his duties were British china, glass, and paper, and, more famously, tea, a duty of 3<i>d</i>. a pound calculated to bring in half the estimated &pound;40,000 revenue. That amount was small, derided by Grenville in opposition, but intended by Townshend to be only a beginning. There was no connection, as was once thought then and later, with a ministerial defeat of 27 February on the land tax that cost the administration &pound;500,000 in revenue. That deficit was made up, not by the levy on the East India Company, but by an assiduous scrutiny by Townshend of government departments that uncovered numerous odd sums of money.<br>
<br>The middle of 1767 saw Townshend in the ascendant, carrying his measures concerning America and India, and being a success as chancellor of the exchequer. Personal matters also went well for him. The inheritance by his wife in April of a further income of &pound;4000 per annum from her mother enabled him to boast to Grafton of his complete financial independence. He capitalized, too, on his political success and seeming indispensability by obtaining at last for his wife on 19 August the long-coveted British peerage title of Greenwich held by her father, albeit as baroness not duchess: since her two sons predeceased her, the title expired on her death. And it was largely through his influence that, in the same month, his brother Lord Townshend was appointed lord lieutenant of Ireland. And then suddenly he died, on 4 September 1767, at Sudbrook, Surrey, of a &#145;putrid fever&#146;, aged forty-two. &#145;That first eloquence of the world is dumb&#146;, wrote Walpole, conveying the sense of shock and loss to the political scene  (<span class="italic">Letters of Horace Walpole</span>, 7.133).<h2>
<a name="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2>Walpole was well aware that Townshend had dazzled to deceive, and wrote a considered judgement to Conway:<blockquote>As a man of incomparable parts, and most entertaining to a spectator, I regret his death. His good humour prevented one from hating him, and his levity from loving him; but in a political light I own I cannot look upon it as a misfortune. (<span class="italic">Letters of Horace Walpole</span>, 7.129)</blockquote>Throughout his life men saw through Townshend for what he was, brilliant but unreliable. If posterity remembers him for the taxation that set in train the sequence of events that culminated in the American War of Independence, contemporaries were both fascinated and appalled by his behaviour. While perhaps matching Pitt in oratory, he lacked the other's political courage, for all his boasts of independence. To his parliamentary talent he added administrative ability, when he put his mind to it. Yet his capricious character made him his own worst enemy, a phrase used of him by Henry Fox in 1763. To be talked about was his chief aim in life, and Edmund Burke gave him a belated obituary notice which he would have liked, in his famous speech of 19 April 1774 on American taxation, when he declared that Townshend had been &#145;the delight and ornament of this House, and the charm of every private society which he honoured with his presence&#146;  (Simmons and Thomas, 4.222).<br>
