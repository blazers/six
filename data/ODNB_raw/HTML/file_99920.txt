<span class="headword">Hart,  Frederick Leslie <span class="st"> [Fred]</span></span>  (1914&#150;2008), <span class="occ">automotive engineer</span>, was born on 12 September 1914 at 25 Pendlestone Road, Walthamstow, Essex, the son of John Octavius Hart (1870&#150;1942), a stock keeper for a provisions dealer, and his wife, Rosina Florence, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Callow (1873&#150;1955). He was educated at Walthamstow grammar school. After leaving he worked in the City of London before becoming a landscape architect, meanwhile studying for his engineering qualifications at evening classes. It was not until 1940 that he entered the car industry, joining the Ford motor company as a draughtsman. Initially he was employed in designing armoured military vehicles as part of Ford's contribution to Britain's war effort. On 18 September 1943, at the parish church of St Saviour, Walthamstow, he married Margaret Lydia Bennett (<i>b</i>. 1922), daughter of George Henry Bennett, seaman. They had a son, John.<br>
<br>After the war Hart was engaged in designing light motor cars for Ford and by 1957 had achieved the rank of executive engineer. His rise within the company was a reflection of his remarkable talents as an engineer. The first vehicle in whose development he played a central part was the Ford Anglia 105E, a small family car, in 1959. The Anglia was a &#145;notchback&#146;, meaning that its rear window leant back from its base. Following the success of the Anglia, Hart was enlisted in 1960 to play a major role in the development of the Ford Cortina, which became one of the company's best selling cars for two decades. The impetus for this vehicle was to a degree born out of the rivalry between Ford Britain and Ford Germany. Essentially the Cortina project was a riposte to the news that Ford Germany was working on a new, mid-range, front-wheel drive family saloon. British products were normally rear-wheel drives, but Ford Britain then embarked on designing and constructing a rival front-wheel drive car that would be produced at the same time as the German car. The German project was already one year into its development cycle, meaning that the British operation had to be completed in two years if a simultaneous launch was to be achieved.<br>
<br>The Cortina project was led by Ford's project manager, Terry Beckett, with Hart as executive engineer. The British team worked fast, and hard, and its efforts bore fruit in September 1962 when the launch target was met. The Cortina subsequently went through five generations with over 4.2 million cars being sold between 1962 and 1982, when production finally ceased. A notable feature of the Cortina which was incorporated into the 1964 variant was the innovatory aeroflow heating and ventilation system, offering flow-through ventilation to eliminate stuffiness and increase the accuracy of temperature control, thus standing in sharp contrast to previous heating systems. Hart was heavily involved in this revolutionary system and in advocating its introduction.<br>
<br>Hart was promoted to chief engineer of Ford Britain's car division in 1963. His team was responsible for developing the Corsair, a larger variant of the Cortina, but the Corsair never obtained the Cortina's near-iconic status in the motoring world. Hart was also closely involved in the development and launch in 1966 of the top-of-the-range mark 1V Zephyr and Zodiac models. Both were equipped with independent suspension for both their front and rear wheels, unlike their predecessors.<br>
<br>In 1969 GKN Sankey recruited Hart to become technical director at its Telford base in the west midlands. His expertise was required in the development of a &#145;proper&#146; (four-wheeled) car for the disabled to replace the existing unstable three-wheeled invalid carriage that was commonly used throughout Britain. Hart's design was much more practical, but also costly, and despite its winning a 1978 Design Council commendation the Labour government refused to back its commercial development and the project withered. Hart retired from GKN Sankey the following year.<br>
<br>Hart was a highly practical man, whose son later recalled his father making for him toys that were a distinct improvement on those they had seen in department stores. In retirement Hart pursued his hobbies of bowls and gardening. He died of bronchopneumonia at his home, Lugano, 3 Powell Road, Buckhurst Hill, Essex, on 15 April 2008 and was survived by his wife and son.<br>
