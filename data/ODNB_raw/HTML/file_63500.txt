<span class="headword">Boughton, Sir  Charles William  Rouse-</span> <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em>Charles William Boughton, Charles William Rouse, Sir Charles William Boughton-Rouse]</span>, ninth baronet and first baronet  (1747&#150;1821), <span class="occ">politician</span>, the son of Shuckburgh Boughton (<i>d</i>. 1760) and his wife, Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Greville, of Poston Court, Herefordshire, was baptized on 10 December 1747 in the parish of St Nicholas, Worcester.<br>
<br>Boughton was appointed a writer by the East India Company in 1764 to Bengal, and after 1768 used the name Rouse as he had become the heir of his cousin Thomas Rouse. He was appointed supervisor of Nator (Rajshahi district) in 1769, one of the most valuable areas that the East India Company had just acquired in Bengal. The 22-year-old Rouse was expected, according to the new regulations, to report on the tax collections, to give a careful account of the economic conditions of the region, to see that justice was enforced, to extirpate corruption, and to abolish arbitrary fines. In his letters to his superior in Murshidabad, the capital, he acknowledged that he had been criticized for having shown undue concern for the peasants, but he defended himself with the argument that humane treatment was the only way to get the people to accept the rule of foreigners alien in race, religion, and language. He became involved in the debate over the tax system that should be used in Bengal, arguing that the <i>zamindars</i> were the actual owners of their lands, not just tax collectors, or tax farmers, to be appointed because they made the highest bid for the office, as many company officials argued. This position aligned him with Philip Francis, a member of the supreme council of Bengal, and against Warren Hastings, the governor-general, in one of the most celebrated disputes over the nature of the company's administration. Francis was impressed by the young Rouse, and, telling him that &#145;with respect to great fundamental principles, your ideas coincide with mine&#146;, used many of Rouse's detailed minutes for his own work  (Weitzman, 304). Rouse continued to be helpful to Francis in England in his attacks on Hastings. A competent student of Persian, which he learned in Bengal, he translated part of the great Mughal work on government <span class="italic">A&#146;in-i-Akbari</span>. He left the company's service in 1778 and returned to England, but remained involved in Indian affairs. According to Edmund Burke, Rouse had an important role in the select committee appointed by parliament in 1781 to investigate the activities of the East India Company and Warren Hastings. Much of the detailed material on land revenue as well as background on Hastings seems to have been supplied in private meetings before and during the meetings of the select committee  (<span class="italic">Correspondence</span>, 4.355&#150;8; <span class="italic">Writings and Speeches</span>, 6.55, 67). In 1791 he published <span class="italic">Dissertation Concerning the Landed Property of Bengal</span>, in which he showed an unusual knowledge of taxation and land tenures.<br>
<br>Elected MP for Evesham in 1780, Rouse retained the seat until 1790 as a supporter of William Pitt. He was one of the forty-two members in that parliament who belonged to what was known as the &#145;Indian interest&#146;, that is, &#145;nabobs&#146; who had served in the East India Company. On 3 June 1782 he married Catherine Hall (<i>d</i>. 1808), who was the daughter and heir of William Pearce Hall of Downton Hall, Shropshire. They had a son, William, who eventually succeeded to his titles, and two daughters, Louisa and Caroline. His wife's connections, and those of his mother with the Greville family, were factors in his access to William Pitt and other leading politicians. In 1784 he became the secretary of the Board of Control, the body set up by parliament to oversee the affairs of the East India Company, but he was dismissed in 1791, apparently because he had opposed some of the measures of Henry Dundas, the president of the board. In recognition of his services to Pitt's ministry, he was created baronet in July 1791. At this point he added his original family name of Boughton as Boughton-Rouse, but in 1794, when he inherited the family title of ninth baronet, he began using the name Rouse-Boughton.<br>
<br>Rouse-Boughton tried, unsuccessfully, in 1795 to get Pitt to reappoint him as secretary to the Board of Control, pleading that he was in need as his elder brother had left the family estate, valued at &pound;50,000, to his daughter by a maidservant. He was elected as an MP for Bamber in 1796, one of the fifty-seven members of that parliament who belonged to the &#145;Indian interest&#146;. Rouse spoke occasionally on Indian affairs in parliament, generally defending the East India Company's political activities. He had hoped that Pitt would give him an office that would let him keep his parliamentary seat, but when nothing was forthcoming, he resigned in January 1800 to become an audit commissioner. He died on 26 February 1821 at his home, Downton Hall, Shropshire.<br>
