<span class="headword">Connor <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em>O'Connor]</span>,  Bernard</span>  (<em>c.</em>1666&#150;1698), <span class="occ">physician and writer on Poland</span>, the son of Bernard O'Connor, born in co. Kerry, Ireland, was descended from the O'Connor Kerry family, lords of Kerry. As a Roman Catholic, he was prohibited from attending school or university, and was therefore taught privately by tutors. Of his life in Ireland almost nothing is known, but <i>c</i>.1686, when he was about twenty years old, he went abroad to further his education. He is said to have studied medicine about 1690 at the universities of Montpellier and Paris  (N. F. J. Eloy, <span class="italic">Dictionnaire historique</span>), but no confirmation of this has been found in the records of those institutions. There is, however, evidence that he attended the University of Rheims and took the degree of doctor of medicine there on 18 September 1693. (The date 18 September 1691, given in the records of the Royal College of Physicians, is less likely.) While in France, he published in 1693 in Paris a paper describing a spondylitic skeleton, entitled <span class="italic">Lettre &eacute;crite &agrave; Monsieur le Chevalier Guillaume de Waldegrave, premier m&eacute;decin de sa majest&eacute; britannique</span>.<br>
<br>Through contact with the French royal court, O'Connor was entrusted with the care of the sons of Jan Wielopolski, crown chancellor of Poland, who had died in 1688. With them he set out late in 1693 on a journey to Italy, where he visited Rome and, on about 13 December 1693, ascended Vesuvius. He met several prominent Italian physicians. He and his Polish companions then passed through Venice, Padua, Innsbruck, and Vienna, on their way to Warsaw, where, following their arrival in mid-1694, King Jan III Sobieski appointed O'Connor his personal physician. Being commanded to confer with certain other physicians concerning a disease of the king's sister, O'Connor immediately diagnosed an abscess of the liver and said she could not live long, whatever her treatment. The others made light of her condition, but within a month she was dead and confirmation of the diagnosis by post-mortem enhanced his reputation. However, since the king was sixty-four years old and in poor health, O'Connor's situation was uncertain. It was therefore with relief that he accepted the task of attending Princess Teresa Kunegunda, the king's daughter, on her journey to Brussels to join her husband, the elector of Bavaria. Soon after the arrival of the royal equipage in Brussels on 12 January 1695 the care of the electress's health was taken over by her husband's physician and O'Connor set sail for England, where he landed in February 1695. He became a member of the Church of England, changed his name to Connor, and soon had friends in high places, including Hans Sloane. At a meeting of the Royal Society on 6 March 1695 Connor presented several natural curiosities, including seeds and minerals collected in Poland and a specimen of <i>plica polonica</i> (a matted condition of the hair). He then moved to Oxford, where he stayed for about three months, lecturing to members of the university on anatomy and related matters and attending to the publication of four scientific papers under the collective title <span class="italic">Dissertationes medico-physicae</span> (1695), including a Latin version of his account of a spondylitic skeleton, now addressed to John Radcliffe. By 20 June he was back in London and attending a meeting of the Royal Society, where he presented a copy of his newly printed <span class="italic">Dissertationes</span>. While in Oxford he had attracted the attention of Robert Gorge (or Gorges) of St John's College, who reported to Sir William Trumbull, member of parliament for the university and a privy councillor, first that Connor, having pretended to be a Pole, had revealed himself to be an Irishman hostile to the English cause in Ireland; and later, that he was believed to be a French spy. However, this did not hinder Connor's admission on 27 November 1695 as a fellow of the Royal Society and, on 6 April 1696, as a licentiate of the Royal College of Physicians. From January to March 1696 he lectured three times a week in the library of St Martin-in-the-Fields on the fabric and operations of the human body, and that summer he repeated these lectures in Cambridge.<br>
<br>Public interest in Polish affairs resulting from the death of King Jan III Sobieski (17 June 1696) and the election of his successor provided the stimulus for the publication of Connor's <span class="italic">History of Poland</span>, which he had begun while still in Poland. His medical activities left him little spare time, however, and it was only with the assistance of his friend John Savage (1673&#150;1747) that he managed to prepare this book for the press. The second volume was, in fact, composed by Savage from Connor's notes. <span class="italic">The History of Poland, in Several Letters to Persons of Quality</span> (2 vols., 1698) is an imposing work of over seven hundred pages, based strictly on identified sources and embodying a valuable eyewitness account of Poland in the late seventeenth century. Connor's most controversial work, however, was his <span class="italic">Evangelium medici, seu, Medicina mystica: de suspensis naturae legibus, sive, De miraculis</span> (1697), which set out to explain miracles by the principles of medical knowledge.<br>
<br>In October 1698 Connor, who was now living in Brownlow Street, in the parish of St Giles-in-the-Fields, Middlesex, fell ill with a fever. On 27 October he made his will and the next day sent for the rector, William Hayley, who, accepting that he was a true penitent member of the Church of England, gave him communion. But Connor was later visited by an Irish Roman Catholic priest, who spoke to him in Irish and, it appears, gave him extreme unction.<br>
<br>Connor died on 30 October 1698 and was buried at St Giles-in-the-Fields on 3 November. Judging that in his dealings with the Catholic priest Connor had no longer known what he was doing, Hayley gave him burial as a member of the Church of England. Connor's will directed that his property, including his house and furniture, be sold and the proceeds paid to his nearest relatives. It mentions, in particular, a diamond ring, which was to be sold and the proceeds given to his youngest sister. Not having been witnessed, the will had to be proved before a judge, at which point the executors Charles Connor (the doctor's cousin) and William Lilley renounced their rights in favour of Connor's father, who on 6 October 1699 was given administration.<br>
