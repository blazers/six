<span class="headword">Hughes,  Stephen</span>  (1622?&#150;1688), <span class="occ">nonconformist minister and publisher</span>, was born in Carmarthen, the second son of John Hughes (more traditionally John ap Hugh ap William ap Rhisiart), a puritan silk merchant in comfortable circumstances, who was an alderman and twice mayor of Carmarthen (1650 and 1660, the year of his death), and his wife, Elizabeth Bevan, daughter of Dafydd, a tanner who was himself an alderman and mayor of Carmarthen in 1631 and 1642. Stephen's elder brother, John, was mayor in 1659.<br>
<br>Hughes was probably educated at Queen Elizabeth's Grammar School, Carmarthen, and from about 1653 he was minister at Merthyr, Carmarthenshire. He removed to Meidrim in 1655 where, loyal to Cromwell and an approver in Carmarthenshire, he ministered until he was ejected in 1661. He returned to his father's house in Carmarthen and was imprisoned for a short period, but on his marriage (after 1655) to an affluent lady (possibly called Catherine) of Swansea, who shared his religious zeal, he moved to that town, where he lived for the rest of his life.<br>
<br>Hughes continued to minister to a number of dissenting churches in Carmarthenshire in spite of the constraints of the penal laws, avoiding persecution and imprisonment. Hughes was a popular and effective preacher. A moderate puritan and a peaceable man of generous spirit, he was highly regarded and was friendly with many Anglicans. His role in setting up schools in the 1660s to teach children and adults to read Welsh, his pastoral and preaching ministry, and the churches which he established earned for him the popular title the Apostle of Carmarthenshire, and there is no doubt that he laid the foundations of dissent in south-west Wales.<br>
<br>Like other dissenters Hughes had realized early in his career the advantages of the permanence of print as a source of continuing and renewed edification, notwithstanding the fervour of the spoken word. But he had also seen that if ordinary folk were to benefit from their reading, the books provided should appeal both in content and in style. Hughes began his literary mission with his collections of the poems of the Revd Rees Prichard, &#145;the Old Vicar&#146;, whose homely moralizing and instructional verses were circulating in manuscript and orally. Hughes, assisted by Henry Maurice and Iaco ab Dewi, compiled an edited collection, the first part of which was published in 1659; a second part, now lost, appeared soon after. He returned to this task some ten years later, publishing the third part of Prichard's poems in 1670, and the four parts as a single volume in 1672.<br>
<br>Henceforth until his death in 1688 Hughes worked closely with Thomas Gouge, Charles Edwards, and others to publish or to reissue a large number of translations of popular English religious works, some under the aegis of the Welsh Trust but others at considerable personal cost, involving extended visits to London to supervise printing and proof-reading during the years of his active pastoral ministry. Hughes edited many of these works, adapting, paraphrasing, and revising them so that they might better meet the needs of his intended readership. He often included in his books the Welsh alphabet and provided glossaries or marginal notes which gave south Wales equivalents for north Wales words or vice versa. A new edition of Rees Prichard's poems appeared in 1681, under the title by which it has been known ever since, <span class="italic">Cannwyll y Cymru</span>. This book, fourteen editions of which appeared between 1658 and 1730, became one of the most popular works of Welsh piety ever: Hughes is responsible for the form in which Prichard's poems have been known, and his is the credit for giving these verses such currency, especially in south Wales.<br>
<br>Hughes's major concern was that the <span class="roman">Bible</span> in Welsh should be more generally available. He promoted the publication of the <span class="roman">New Testament</span> in 1672 but was acutely conscious that the publishing of the <span class="roman">Bible</span> would require substantial capital. Some &pound;2000 was raised and in 1677&#150;8 the co-operation of Hughes, Gouge, and Edwards enabled a corrected version of the Welsh <span class="roman">Bible</span> to be published on good paper and in larger, improved type. Eight thousand copies were published to be sold for 4<i>s</i>. 2<i>d</i>., and 1000 were distributed free.<br>
<br>In 1672 Hughes also brought out a composite volume, <span class="italic">Catechism Mr Perkins</span>, which contained in addition to William Perkins's <span class="italic">Catechism, Sail y grefydd Gristnogol</span> (Evan Roberts's translation of Perkins's <span class="italic">The Foundation of Christian Religion</span>), <span class="italic">Rhodfa feunyddiol y Christion</span> (Richard Jones's translation of Henry Oasland's <span class="italic">Christian's Daily Walk</span>), and <span class="italic">Amdo neu amwisc i babyddiaeth</span> (Jones's translation of Richard Baxter's <span class="italic">A Winding Sheet for Popery</span>). This was followed in 1677 by other composite volumes: <span class="italic">Tryssor i'r Cymru</span>, containing translations of works by Arthur Dent, Oliver Thomas, and Richard Baxter, and <span class="italic">Cyfarwydd-deb i'r anghyfarwydd</span>, translations of works by Baxter (<span class="italic">Call to the Unconverted</span>, translated by Richard Jones as <span class="italic">Galwad i'r annychweledig</span>) and others. Hughes himself translated Francis Peraud's <span class="italic">Adroddiad cywir o'r pethau ar a wnaeth ac a ddwedodd yspryd aflan ym Mascon yn Burgundy</span> (1681) and published Robert Holland's <span class="italic">Dau Gymro yn taring yn bell o'u gwlad</span> (1681), two contemporary accounts of, and warnings against, the wiles of witchcraft and evil spirits. Hughes assisted Charles Edwards in the 1682 publication of <span class="italic">Llwybr hyffordd &hellip; i'r nefoedd</span> (Arthur Dent's <span class="italic">The Plain Man's Pathway to Heaven</span>).<br>
<br>Hughes published at his own cost Henry Evans's <span class="italic">Cynghorion tad i'w fab</span> (1682), moralizing verses in the style of Rees Prichard, but his other most important publication was the translation which he and three others (unnamed but probably including Charles Edwards and less certainly Iaco ab Dewi) produced of Bunyan's <span class="italic">Pilgrim's Progress</span>, <span class="italic">Taith neu siwrnai y pererin</span>. Hughes bore the greatest burden of translating, and the book, published after his death in 1688, reveals him to be a fluent, confident translator.<br>
<br>Hughes did not claim to be knowledgeable in the Welsh literary tradition, and he was motivated more by his religious fervour and personal love of books than by a deep regard for Welsh literature. Nevertheless, his work on the 1677 edition of the <span class="roman">Bible</span> reveals both his scholarship and his familiarity with the standards of Welsh writing. He was himself an effective writer, and some of his comments show that he was not without concern for the well-being of the Welsh language. His efforts to create a literate Welsh peasantry and his success in providing the <span class="roman">Bible</span> and other books in Welsh for them were important factors in safeguarding the language in the face of the Anglicizing influences of puritanism and of the Welsh Trust, and contributed to the revival of Welsh literary culture in the eighteenth century.<br>
<br>Hughes died in Swansea on 16 June 1688. He was buried at St John's Church, Swansea, two days later.<br>
