<span class="headword">Tait,  Andrew Wilson</span>  (1876&#150;1930), <span class="occ">accountant and industrialist</span>, was born in Edinburgh on 16 January 1876, one of at least two sons of William Tait, a grocer and spirit dealer, and his wife, Eliza Wilson. He was educated at Daniel Stewart's College and at Edinburgh University and then became articled to the chartered accountant Alexander Thomas Niven, who had two decades earlier been principal to the chartered accountant George Alexander Touche. Tait was admitted a member of the Edinburgh Society of Accountants on 20 July 1899 and then moved to London, where he joined the recently formed firm of G. A. Touche. In 1910 he married Isabel May (<i>b</i>. 1882), the daughter of George White Allinson, a brewer of Greenbanks, Ellesmere, Shropshire, and his wife, Phoebe Sophia; they had a son and a daughter.<br>
<br>Tait was regarded by Touche as one of the outstanding accountants of his time. Like Touche himself, he was someone who &#145;thought big&#146;, with ambition, imagination, and drive. He is described in the firm's history as &#145;physically strong and a keen boxer&#146;  (Richards, <span class="italic">Touche Ross</span>, 16). Both partners had interests which extended far beyond their accounting firm. They were entrepreneurial in their outlook, and their fees, which were not treated as income of the firm, were thought to have been at least equal to their share of partnership profits. Andrew's brother James also joined the staff of G. A. Touche in 1911 and was admitted to partnership in 1917. James was regarded as a capable and steady worker but not of the same calibre as Andrew.<br>
<br>One of Tait's major achievements was the reconstruction of Ferranti. When the electronics firm neared bankruptcy in 1903, its bankers called in two accountants as receiver-managers. One of these, Arthur Whittaker, was from a local Manchester firm; the other was Tait, who became chairman. Following reconstruction, Sebastian Ziani de Ferranti, the firm's founder, was reduced to a relatively insignificant position within the company. Indeed, it appears that Tait ensured Ferranti was virtually excluded from the works after 1905 because of his alleged obstructive influence. According to the company's historian: &#145;Ferranti stands out as an excellent example of the growing importance of professionally trained businessmen, and especially accountants, in the management of manufacturing companies in the two decades preceding the First World War&#146;  (Wilson, 81).<br>
<br>Tait was active in the affairs of the British Electrical and Allied Manufacturers' Association. In this capacity he took a leading part in the formation of the Federation of British Industries (1916), and was appointed a member of its first executive council. In his role with the association he strove hard to organize the merger of British electrical manufacturers in order to help them compete with their German and American counterparts. He was severely critical of excessive individualism among British industrialists, and while giving evidence to a committee on electrical industries in 1916 he argued that the government's failure to provide support for British industry &#145;twenty to twenty-five years ago&#146; was the reason why it lagged behind the Germans, who &#145;used every effort, diplomatic and otherwise, to assist industry&#146;  (<span class="italic">DBB</span>). In 1918 Tait was appointed CBE for his work during the war on this and other committees.<br>
<br>Tait seemed destined to become one of the country's leading businessmen, and during the first two decades of the twentieth century he was heavily involved in the creation and management of investment trusts. He met with considerable successes, but the connection was to be the source of major set-backs, as well as managing to tarnish his professional reputation. He was director of the Edinburgh-based Electrical Securities Trust, formed in 1907, which failed, with the result that the ordinary shareholders lost all their capital. Much worse was to come as the result of Tait's work at Cedar Investment Trust, which he founded in 1918. He was the receiver and liquidator of the Magadi Soda Company, where plans were made for the sale of its assets to Brunner Mond. This led to a court case at the Chancery Division in February 1925, which proved extremely damaging to Tait. The case, brought by one of Magadi Soda's shareholders, revealed that Tait and his associates had made public statements designed to depress the value of the company's debentures, which were then purchased by the Cedar Investment Trust with the intention of resale to Brunner Mond at a substantial profit. Mr Justice Eve described Tait's part in this unsavoury adventure as discreditable and a breach of trust. Tait was subsequently removed from the boards of a number of companies, although he remained a partner in Touche and on the boards of many other companies right up to the date of his death.<br>
<br>Tait died after a long and wasting illness on 21 April 1930 at his home at 10 Holland Park, Notting Hill, London. The cause of death was chronic meningo-encephalitis, and it is thought that the disease may have been the explanation for his misconduct in the Magadi Soda affair. According to his obituary notice in <span class="italic">The Times</span>: &#145;Mr Tait had one of the shrewdest and sanest minds on financial matters which the City has known, and until his illness his advice was almost universally sought&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 22 April 1930).<br>
