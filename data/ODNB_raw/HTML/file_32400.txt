<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Childe,  (Vere) Gordon</span>  (1892&#150;1957), <span class="occ">prehistorian and labour theorist</span>, was born at the rectory of St Thomas's Church in Sydney, New South Wales, on 14 April 1892, the only surviving offspring of the Revd Stephen Henry Childe (1844&#150;1928), rector of St Thomas's Church, and his second wife, Harriet Eliza (1853&#150;1910), daughter of Alexander Gordon, a barrister, and his wife, Anne. Delicate when young, he was educated from the age of fifteen at the Sydney Church of England grammar school, where he excelled particularly in Latin. In 1911 he entered the University of Sydney, specializing in classics and philosophy. He graduated in April 1914 with first-class honours, the university medal for classics, and the Cooper graduate scholarship in classics, which took him the following October to Queen's College, Oxford. In a university and city increasingly depleted of its male members by the demands of war, Childe took a BLitt in 1916, his thesis entitled &#145;The influence of Indo-Europeans in prehistoric Greece&#146;, his supervisors being the distinguished scholars Sir Arthur Evans and John Myres. In 1917 he obtained a first in <i>literae humaniores</i> (Greats).<br>
<br>Childe grew to maturity in a country then considered the world's social laboratory. At Oxford he soon became involved in the socialist movement, doing his turn as secretary of the Oxford University Socialist Society and president of the Oxford Union of Democratic Control, and also working for the National Council for Civil Liberties and the Fabian Society research department. His friends included G. D. H. Cole and his future wife, Margaret Postgate, her brother Raymond, and particularly Rajani Palme Dutt, later a founder member and foremost theoretician of the British Communist Party, with whom he shared many academic and political interests. Occasionally they would walk out to Boars Hill for tea with Evans.<br>
<br>Rich in academic success, Childe returned to an Australia riven by the issue of conscription. He became senior resident tutor at St Andrew's College, Sydney (a university-affiliated establishment), but, indicative of the way his life would persist as an interplay between academic brilliance and political conviction, his tenure was short. It was claimed that his peace movement activities were discrediting both institutions, and he was compelled to resign. Excluded on political grounds from appointments at Sydney and Queensland universities for which he was well qualified, he also experienced a public witch-hunt forcing his resignation from a teaching post at Maryborough Boys' Grammar School, Queensland. By now well known in New South Wales Labor Party circles, Childe was eventually appointed private secretary to John Storey, the party's leader, who retained him in that post on becoming state premier in April 1920. In late 1921 Childe was sent to London to report on European social democratic movements, but Storey's death precipitated a change of government, and Childe's post was soon abolished. He was then thirty, without job prospects in either Australia or Britain.<br>
<br>In 1923 Childe published his first book, <span class="italic">How Labour Governs: a Study of Workers' Representation in Australia</span>, subsequently a classic in Australian historiography. It is often interpreted primarily as an analysis of how the Australian Labor Party, &#145;starting with a band of inspired Socialists, degenerated into a vast machine for capturing political power&#146;  (Childe, <span class="italic">How Labour Governs</span>, 209); but T. H. Irving has shown that, in line with guild socialist principles enunciated by his mentor, Cole, the book is better read as an argument that a working-class party should be both a party of representation and an agent for political change and democracy.<br>
<br>Although not excluding the possibility of a political career, Childe began his return to archaeology in 1922 by visits to sites and museums in Greece, the Balkans, and central Europe, while he also worked on <span class="italic">The Dawn of European Civilization</span>, which, when published in 1925, brought immediate academic recognition. In that year, urged by Myres, he became librarian at the Royal Anthropological Institute. In 1927 he became the first holder of the Abercromby chair of prehistoric archaeology at the University of Edinburgh, moving in 1946 to become the first professor of prehistoric European archaeology and director of the Institute of Archaeology in the University of London. Elected fellow of the British Academy in 1940, and a recipient of honorary degrees from American and European universities, as well as those of Sydney and Edinburgh (the latter posthumously), he retired in 1956. Returning to Australia in April 1957, he visited relatives and colleagues, gave some lectures (on one occasion comparing contemporary Australia unfavourably with tenth-century Iceland) and explored the New South Wales Blue Mountains. There, at Govett's Leap, Blackheath, he committed suicide on 19 October 1957. The funeral on 23 October was at his father's old church, St Thomas's, north Sydney. The body was cremated.<br>
<br>Childe was widely regarded as the most distinguished European prehistorian of his time, with a bibliography of over 600 items, predominantly concerned with the European neolithic and Bronze ages. <span class="italic">The Dawn</span> was rapidly followed by four books relating to his abiding academic concern, first set out in the former's preface. &#145;My theme is the foundation of European Civilization as a peculiar and individual manifestation of the human spirit&#146;  (Childe, <span class="italic">Dawn</span>, xiii). <span class="italic">The Aryans</span> appeared in 1926, followed by <span class="italic">The Most Ancient East</span> (1928), <span class="italic">The Danube in Prehistory</span> (1929), and <span class="italic">The Bronze Age</span> (1930). In 1931 he published <span class="italic">Skara Brae</span>, an account of excavations he had directed at the famous Orkney neolithic village.<br>
<br>To many of his contemporaries Childe was the great synthesizer, competent in almost every European language, these books his lasting achievement. His own final self-assessment was very different, stressing instead &#145;interpretative concepts and methods of explanation&#146;  (Childe, &#145;Retrospect&#146;, 69). By such means he brought order to the mass of facts pertaining to European prehistory, relating it to the historic ancient Near East particularly by definitions of specific cultures, spatially and chronologically arranged. To this scholarly corpus was added <span class="italic">New Light on the Most Ancient East</span> (1934), <span class="italic">The Prehistory of Scotland</span> (1935), a new edition of <span class="italic">The Dawn</span> (1939, hastened by the threat of war&#151;three more editions were to follow), <span class="italic">Prehistoric Communities of the British Isles</span> (1940), <span class="italic">Scotland before the Scots</span> (1946), a Marxist interpretation equivocally received, <span class="italic">Prehistoric Migrations in Europe</span> (1950), and a revised <span class="italic">New Light</span> (1952).<br>
<br>Childe also wrote very successfully for what he called the &#145;bookstall&#146; public, notably <span class="italic">Man Makes himself</span> (1936) and <span class="italic">What Happened in History</span> (1942), both often reprinted and widely translated. The underlying theme of each, one written during the depressed 1930s, the other completed in 1941 when German military successes were paramount, was that progress was real if discontinuous. As Sherratt has written of Childe's stance:<blockquote>Over the long term, the increase in human numbers and their independence from environmental controls are some measure of man's evolutionary success; and just as the Industrial Revolution marked a crucial turning-point, so prehistory too was punctuated by periods of sharply accelerated growth. (Sherratt, 179)</blockquote>These changes, from hunting to farming, and from the latter to urban society, Childe termed the neolithic and urban revolutions, which, in evolutionary terms derived from the Enlightenment, distinguished savagery from barbarism and barbarism from civilization. After 1945 appeared <span class="italic">History</span> (1947), a Marxist study of historiography (where, incidentally, the future of society was not guaranteed), <span class="italic">Social Evolution</span> (1951), and in 1956 <span class="italic">Piecing together the Past</span>, a <span class="italic">Short Introduction to Archaeology</span>, and <span class="italic">Society and Knowledge</span>, a study of epistemology. His last book was a final testament. In <span class="italic">The Prehistory of European Society</span> (1958) he argued forcefully that the origins of European capitalism lay in the freer relations of production existing in Bronze Age Europe compared to those of oriental despotisms.<br>
<br>Childe never married, and his commitment to scholarship and at times shy and austere personality could suggest aloofness. Deemed by some a poor lecturer, he was more accurately a brilliant and inspiring teacher, ready to assist colleagues and students alike in the establishment of prehistory as a coherent and knowable subject, relevant to society as a whole. Within the labour movement and to other supporters of the left he was known for his commitment to socialist causes, his membership of the Association of Scientific Workers, and his association with several left-wing journals.<br>
<br>Childe's work has been much debated. Initially after his death his emphasis on the study of artefactually defined cultures was regarded as too limiting. The radio-carbon revolution destroyed his chronologies. Megaliths owed nothing to the Orient for their being. Prehistoric Europe was not its quirky birthchild, but a parallel, lusty creation. Under the banner of the &#145;new archaeology&#146; Childe's work was pushed to the sidelines. His Marxism, often misunderstood in his lifetime, became irrelevant, its importance merely historical.<br>
<br>More recently, partly because of widespread reactions against the new archaeology's determinism, has come the realization that much of Childe's work remains worth debating, not only among archaeologists. He was almost alone among his peers to raise such issues as the relativism of knowledge (&#145;Hence, any society may be allowed its own logic&#146;; Childe, <span class="italic">Social Worlds</span>, 18), and the enormous relevance of archaeology to the definition of progress in a world threatened by totalitarian regimes. Essentially a Marxist in the Western tradition, at various times, particularly after the entry of the Soviet Union as an ally in the Second World War, Childe regarded Russian archaeology, and to a much lesser degree Marxism-Leninism, sympathetically. Disillusionment, notably in 1956 when Stalinism was denounced in the Soviet Union shortly before a visit to Russian colleagues convinced him of serious unacknowledged deficiencies in Soviet archaeology  (Klejn, 83&#150;7), probably contributed to his suicide as much as his conviction that his own contributions to scholarship and society were complete.<br>
<br>More than any other scholar in his field, however, and despite the divisive political and military turmoils of the first half of the twentieth century, Childe stood for the internationalism of learning. As a prehistorian he regarded the interconnections of cultures within the Old World, if not yet known, as knowable. Knowledge, though defined by its context, is not limited to that context. Modern culture, he maintained,<blockquote>already incorporates the real thought of past societies &hellip; The historian's business is to locate in their proper social and chronological context these thoughts that are still living and active in our culture &hellip; To this extent historical knowledge, knowledge of past societies, is both possible and profitable. (Childe, <span class="italic">Social Worlds</span>, 26)</blockquote>And that knowledge is for universal benefit.<br>
