<span class="headword">Robert fitz Hubert</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1140), <span class="occ">soldier</span>, was Flemish by birth. His parents are unknown, but his father, Hubert, was said to have been <i>nobilis</i>, and he was himself reported to be a kinsman of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29465/', "William of Ypres (d. 1164/5)")</script>, the son of Count Philippe of Ypres. From the fact that he would later announce his intention of sending from England to Flanders for knights to act as his bodyguard, it would appear that by the late 1130s he had acquired wealth and a following, either through inheritance or by military arts. Perhaps he was one of the mercenary captains active in Flanders in the confused period 1127&#150;8, since he later claimed to have been responsible for the destruction of a monastery where eighty monks were burnt in their church. But Robert is first recorded by name only in 1139, when he may have been one of the Flemings who accompanied William of Ypres to England in that year at King Stephen's summons. Accompanied by at least two nephews and other kinsmen, by 7 October he had occupied the castle at Malmesbury, pursuing the fugitives from the garrison into the monastery nearby and only withdrawing when he had taken possession of their horses. Soon dispossessed of Malmesbury by the king, Robert took service with Robert, earl of Gloucester, but he was acting on his own behalf when on 26 March following he used ingeniously made leather scaling-ladders to capture Devizes Castle. Refusing to surrender his prize to Earl Robert, he used the castle as a base from which to terrorize the neighbourhood, and announced his intention of winning control over &#145;the whole district from Winchester to London&#146;  (Malmesbury, <span class="italic">Historia novella</span>, 43&#150;4).<br>
<br>But Robert overreached himself when he tried to outwit John Marshal and take Marlborough Castle by guile. Captured himself, he was handed over to Earl Robert who made him promise to surrender Devizes by threatening to hang him. Robert and his comrades had earlier sworn to one another not to give up the castle, and the wily Marshal sent messengers to the garrison urging them to stand firm, promising that no harm would befall their leader. Consequently neither Robert, once outside the castle, nor the garrison within, would agree to give it up for fear of perjuring themselves, whereupon first Robert's two nephews, and then Robert himself, were hanged, at a date before 15 August 1140. The violent course and bitter end of Robert fitz Hubert's English career made a strong impression on chroniclers of events in the west of England in the early years of Stephen's reign. The author of the <span class="italic">Gesta Stephani</span>, for instance, describes Robert as &#145;a man of great cruelty and unequalled in wickedness and crime&#146;  (<span class="italic">Gesta Stephani</span>, 93), and attributes his death to the righteous vengeance of God. The horror he aroused may have owed something to the impact of continental methods of warfare upon a countryside that until recently had long been at peace; the fact that Wiltshire and Gloucestershire lay on the ill-defined border between regions giving allegiance to Stephen and to Matilda no doubt gave a man like Robert fitz Hubert additional scope for the exercise of his ambitions and skills.<br>
