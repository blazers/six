<span class="headword">Ivie,  Edward</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1698), <span class="occ">informer and coiner</span>, was the youngest son of Thomas Ivie of Wincanton, Somerset, where his father and elder brother served as parish officers. His uncle was the puritan activist and civic reformer <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/66527/', "John Ivie")</script> of Salisbury, who made his view of Edward absolutely clear when in April 1664 he left him just 6<i>d</i>. in his will: three of Edward's brothers received 10<i>s</i>. apiece.<br>
<br>By Ivie's later accounts it was his ardent royalism that had isolated him within his family. He claimed to have taken part in Penruddock's rising in 1655 and Booth's in 1659, and to have been either imprisoned or forced to flee after the former. More certainly, by the summer of 1662 this very minor landed gentleman had robbed his own widowed sister, Joan Plympton, of &pound;30. Peter Stone, Ivie's servant, carried out the robbery, but Ivie planned it and was actually carrying his sister's money when it was stolen. Convicted at the Somerset assizes, Ivie and Stone were reprieved from the gallows, but it took two years for them to receive a royal pardon. Twice, in October 1662 and February 1663, pardons for Ivie were granted only to be stopped. His forfeited estate, including a five-hearth house in Wincanton, was granted to his brother William, and his reported attempt to get this reversed by bribery came to nothing. Finally, on the first of many occasions, he turned informer. Having assisted in &#145;the discovery of severall Malefactors whoe are to bee tried the next Assizes&#146;, as was certified on 1 June 1664, he was awarded a pardon so that he could give essential testimony for the prosecution  (TNA: PRO, SP 29/99, fol. 2<i>r</i>).<br>
<br>Shortly after his release Ivie went to Ireland. By the late 1670s he held lands at Dunhill in co. Waterford, 8 miles from Waterford itself, where one Joseph Ivie was a leading merchant and alderman. In 1678&#150;9 Edward Ivie was part of a conspiracy to exploit the panic raised by the Popish Plot. The conspirators, led by Hubert Bourke, accused Richard Power, earl of Tyrone, of accepting a commission from Louis XIV to raise a local rebel force to join a planned French invasion, and attempted unsuccessfully to bring Tyrone to trial at the Waterford assizes in August 1679 and March 1680. In November 1679 they appeared before the Irish council; a version of their testimony was published in London in 1680. According to this source Ivie reported suspicious armed gatherings at the house of tenants taken on at the request of his neighbour John Macnamara, and Macnamara's own collusion in the earl's attempts to silence Bourke. At Ivie's urging Macnamara was kept a close prisoner by the Irish council and finally made a full confession.<br>
<br>In April 1680 Ivie and the other witnesses against Tyrone arrived in London in a larger group of false witnesses brought over to substantiate the warnings of an Irish threat made by Anthony Ashley Cooper, earl of Shaftesbury. In February 1681 Ivie testified before the Middlesex grand jury, which found a charge of treason against a number of Tyrone's followers and the Irish secretary of state, Sir John Davies. In the following months Ivie advanced Macnamara's cousin, Brian Haines, as a key witness against popish conspiracy. In March Ivie pointed Haines out to the poet and pamphleteer Stephen College as the discoverer of a plot to destroy the imminent Oxford parliament. In May, when the informer Edward Fitzharris claimed that the duke of York, the earl of Danby, and the queen had contrived the murder of Sir Edmund Berry Godfrey, Ivie proffered Haines to a suspicious Shaftesbury and to College as the witness who could confirm the story. Government spies informed on Ivie, then lodging at the Blue Anchor in Old Jewry, and his meetings with Shaftesbury. He is, one noted, &#145;a cunning fellow &hellip; &amp; is believed did furnish &amp; does stil Haines with monies&#146;; &#145;hee is a very black man with Large black Eyebrows, &amp; wears a short perriwigg&#146;, said another  (TNA: PRO, SP 29/415/199, 200).<br>
<br>Within weeks, like other Popish Plot informers, Ivie and Haines became witnesses against the whigs whom they had previously cultivated, a change of patrons urged on by self-interest and self-preservation, and encouraged by a government agent, David Fitzgerald. They provided information against Shaftesbury, College, William Hetherington (who had brought the Irish witnesses over), and John Rouse (who had acted as their paymaster). In August 1682 Ivie was being paid &pound;1 10<i>s</i>. 0<i>d</i>. a week. When College was tried at Oxford on 17 August 1681, accused of planning a rebellion, one witness claimed that Ivie was &#145;the first that swore this Presbyterian plot&#146;  (<span class="italic">State trials</span>, 8.636). College summoned Ivie as a witness, but cut his evidence short after a tense exchange. On the gallows College spoke bitterly of &#145;this Ivy &hellip; now &hellip; of another stamp&#146;  (ibid., 719).<br>
<br>Despite rising doubts as to the usefulness of Irish witnesses Ivie was one of those sworn before London grand juries against John Rouse and Shaftesbury. In October 1681 Ivie accused Rouse of subornation. In November he testified that he had heard Shaftesbury declare that the king was unfit to reign and a secret papist, and should therefore be deposed. The witnesses against Shaftesbury faced the threat of crowd violence on the day and a counter suit from the earl the following year. Ivie was also harried with actions for debt by his former patrons. He petitioned the crown, seeking legal protection, an increased weekly allowance, and the return of his Wincanton estate from his brother (whom he claimed had framed him in 1662 and then packed the chief witness off to Tangier).<br>
<br>Ivie remained in London, where on 14 March 1689 he married Elizabeth Jones (<i>d</i>. 1699) at St James's, Duke's Place; at that date he was already a widower with a daughter, Mary Townshend (herself a widow by 1693). Within a few years he also had a mistress, Elizabeth Joars, who joined Ivie, his wife, and his daughter in their trade of clipping coins and counterfeiting, an activity made profitable by the increasing gap between the actual and face value of the silver content of the currency. Ivie's house in Berry Court, Liquorpond Street, near Gray's Inn, became a centre where associates like the highwayman Valentine Cogswell sometimes took lodgings. Ivie was a client of Jack Gibbons, who exploited his office as a messenger of the chamber to run a protection racket among the coiners whom he was meant to be policing.<br>
<br>In September 1693, in return for the promise of a pardon, Ivie informed the secretary of state of a group of coiners centred around John Hickes. The plan backfired, as Gibbons chose to protect Hickes and his associates. The men who attempted to serve the secretary's warrant found themselves on trial for burglary and riot. Ivie was indicted for clipping on the evidence of Hickes's wife, while Gibbons forced Mary Townshend to testify against her mother and Elizabeth Joars. Outlawed, Ivie, his wife, and his mistress fled first to Wales and then to Ireland, where he adopted the alias of Jones.<br>
<br>Ivie was arrested in Dublin in May 1698, along with two other counterfeiters, Edward Brady and John Jennings. He freely admitted his crimes in London, but denied that he had done any coining since he came to Ireland (although he had to explain away a trunk full of incriminating materials). As the three men had been arrested for offences committed in England, they were brought back to London. Ivie's wife and mistress followed him. <i>En route</i>, he escaped from Chester Castle with the help of his former washerwoman, to whom he mentioned his desire not to be forced into bearing witness against Brady and Jennings, and his fear of betrayal by his wife and mistress. He got some 30 miles before he was recaptured, and in August he was committed to Newgate.<br>
<br>On 22 August, the day that the warden of the mint, Isaac Newton, interrogated him, Ivie moved with his wife and mistress into the Press Yard parlour, one of the most comfortable and expensive rooms in Newgate. Ivie was able to name names with particular resonance for the authorities: Gibbons (against whom the government had turned), Hickes (now keeper of the Gatehouse prison), and the sham plotter and coiner William Chaloner. Whatever his fears, Ivie could no doubt have expected to trade information for freedom. It was not to be. He died in Newgate on 9 September and was buried in Christ Church, Newgate, the following day. His wife and mistress remained in prison, where Elizabeth Ivie died on 21 March 1699; Elizabeth Joars was released on 21 April.<br>
<br>Ivie's life shows the opportunities available to the unscrupulous provided by the fears of the rulers of late seventeenth-century England, and their urge to know the networks that they saw as threatening them. He was able to play the informer for self-preservation and profit, albeit not without danger, moving between the worlds of political and criminal conspiracy. Some of his targets existed in the same territory: both Gibbons and Jennings had been footmen to the duke of Monmouth. When Ivie's daughter later testified against his mistress she played upon the perceived (and to some degree real) linkages between coining and Jacobite conspiracy (and in the process incriminated her dead father). Elizabeth Joars, &#145;a great cheat and dangerous Enemey to the Governmt.&#146;, had been behind the theft of intelligence from a mail coach; when the government organized a search, she and Ivie had been terrified that &#145;if it were found it would ruin the French King's Interest here and King James besides endangering all their friends&#146;  (TNA: PRO, MINT 15/17/198).<br>
