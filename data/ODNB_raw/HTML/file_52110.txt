<span class="headword">Higgins, Sir  John Patrick Basil <span class="st"> [Eoin]</span></span>  (1927&#150;1993), <span class="occ">judge</span>, was born on 14 June 1927 at Town Parks, Magherafelt, co. Londonderry, the eldest of the eight children of John Alphonsus Higgins, town clerk of Magherafelt, and his wife, Mary Philomena Keenan. He was educated at St Columb's College, Londonderry, and at Queen's University, Belfast, where he read law and graduated with an LLB. He was called to the bar of Northern Ireland in 1948. At that time the volume of work for junior counsel was small, but he steadily began to build up a practice in the county courts throughout the province and in the High Court in Belfast. The qualities which made him an outstanding judge were apparent from his early days at the bar: his unwavering integrity, his sense of duty, and his hard work. On 29 July 1960 he married Brigid O'Neill, a medical practitioner. They had five children, and he was a devoted husband and father.<br>
<br>Eoin Higgins became a queen's counsel in 1967, just before the start of the troubles in Northern Ireland, which had a considerable impact on his own career. In 1969 serious rioting occurred in Belfast and in other parts of the province, and a tribunal of inquiry, chaired by Mr Justice Scarman, was appointed to inquire into the violence and civil disturbances. Higgins was appointed one of the two senior counsel to act for the tribunal, and for the next two years he was busily engaged in assisting the tribunal to carry out its task. In 1971 he was appointed a county court judge, and he served as county court judge for Armagh and Fermanagh from 1976 to 1979 and for South Antrim from 1979 to 1982, when he was appointed recorder of Belfast. He became a High Court judge in 1984. In every judicial position which he occupied he served with distinction and gained the respect of all who came before him.<br>
<br>After his appointment to the High Court, Higgins was for a number of years the judge of the Family Division, seeking to resolve family disputes which often related to the welfare and happiness of children. It was work for which he was eminently suited because of his human gifts of sympathy, compassion, and good sense. As well as sitting in court hearing evidence and giving judgment, he spent many hours in his chambers talking informally to children and their parents and discussing the cases with counsel, solicitors, and social workers, seeking in difficult family conflicts to find a solution which would be in the interests of the children involved. The work he did in those years was of lasting benefit to many. In addition to his work in the Family Division he took a full part in the administration of criminal justice, including the trial of defendants charged with terrorist offences in the non-jury Diplock courts, and he also sat as a judge in the Court of Appeal to hear criminal appeals in many prominent cases.<br>
<br>These were years when the judges in Northern Ireland were targets for terrorist attacks, and, as a Roman Catholic, Higgins was particularly singled out for assassination attempts by the IRA, all of which he survived. On one occasion an attack was made on his home in Belfast, when the police officer guarding the house was shot and wounded. On a second occasion, when he was driving home to Northern Ireland from Dublin airport with his wife and daughter, the IRA mistook the car in which he was travelling and detonated a bomb at the border between the republic and Northern Ireland, murdering a family in another car. A further attack was made on his home in Belfast when the IRA launched mortar bombs at it, again injuring two police officers on duty at the house. After this attack Higgins moved his home to a safer area outside Belfast. But these attacks in no way affected the scrupulous fairness with which he conducted criminal trials, and he continued to administer justice with unflinching courage and complete impartiality.<br>
<br>Higgins had wide experience of the judicial system of Northern Ireland and of its needs, and he served on many committees and tribunals dealing with legal matters. He was also a member of the committee appointed in 1974 under the chairmanship of Lord Gardiner to consider measures to deal with terrorism in the province. He was knighted in 1988.<br>
<br>Higgins was upright and devout. Away from his busy life as a judge, he gave much help to voluntary and charitable organizations, both in membership of committees and in personally visiting and helping those in trouble and in need. He was president of the Society of St Vincent de Paul, chairman of Voluntary Service for Belfast, and a member of the boards of management of St Joseph's College in Belfast and the Dominican College in Portstewart.<br>
<br>Higgins was appointed a lord justice of appeal, but he died suddenly, on 2 September 1993, from a heart attack at his home, 1 Farmhill Lane, Holywood, co. Down, the day before he was due to be sworn in as a member of the Court of Appeal of Northern Ireland. He was mourned by his judicial colleagues and by the members of the legal profession of Northern Ireland as a judge of great integrity, great courage, and great humanity.<br>
