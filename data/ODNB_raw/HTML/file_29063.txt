<span class="headword">Werden, Sir  John</span>, first baronet  (1640&#150;1716), <span class="occ">diplomat and politician</span>, was born on 25 March 1640, the eldest son and heir of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29064/', "Robert Werden (1621/2&#150;1690)")</script>, of Burton Hall, Cheshire, and his first wife, Jane Barnham. Werden entered the Middle Temple in 1653 and was called to the bar on 9 February 1660. He became baron of the exchequer for Cheshire in November 1664, but owed his fortunes to his father's close connections with James, duke of York. He joined the earl of Sandwich's flagship in 1665 as a volunteer, recommended by James, and was soon sent to Copenhagen to confirm a diplomatic arrangement. In 1666 he joined Sandwich's entourage on his embassy to Madrid, providing drawings of the approaches to Corunna for later naval use and other sketches of Spain which are preserved in Sandwich's journal. In November Sandwich sent him to Lisbon with unsuccessful proposals for a Portuguese truce with Spain, and he was left at Madrid as charg&eacute; d'affaires when Sandwich returned to England in July 1668.<br>
<br>In November 1669 Werden was sent to the Netherlands to instruct Sir William Temple to moderate his zeal for the triple alliance. He became envoy-extraordinary to Sweden in July 1670, and on his return two years later was appointed the duke of York's secretary and secretary to the Admiralty. He passed on the duke's instructions to naval commanders, and received their replies, arousing the ire of Prince Rupert, who preferred his captains to deal directly with James. Werden was granted a baronetcy on 28 November 1672, shortly after his marriage on 22 October to Lucy Osbourne (<i>d</i>. 1679), daughter of a Gloucestershire rector. He relinquished his Admiralty post when his patron had to resign in 1673, but continued as James's secretary and as commissioner for the navy, in which capacity he was admitted freeman of Portsmouth in 1675.<br>
<br>Werden was returned MP for Reigate on 31 January 1673 in the duke of York's interest; the election was declared void but he was immediately re-elected. He was reckoned a court dependent in Danby's lists of 1675 and 1678 and was moderately active, sitting on thirty-seven committees. He was denounced by Shaftesbury and in opposition propaganda as a supporter of popery, but was crucially named to the committee to investigate the Popish Plot, where on 25 October 1678 he recorded Titus Oates's evidence in shorthand for his fellow MPs.<br>
<br>Werden was defeated at the first election of 1679, and accompanied James to Brussels as his secretary. In May 1681 his prestigious lodgings at the Stone Gallery in Whitehall were burgled. He was appointed a trustee to provide funds for Prince George of Denmark on his marriage to Princess Anne, and himself had a brief second marriage from about 1682 to Mary Osbourne, who died in August 1683. On James's accession he was returned unopposed as MP for Reigate; he also became commissioner for customs and in August 1687 a lieutenant for the City of London. He did not choose to try for parliament in autumn 1688 or oppose the revolution; James excluded him from those he was prepared to pardon.<br>
<br>Werden retained his post at the customs under William III, possibly through Sidney Godolphin's influence, but in June 1694 Somers successfully recommended his replacement in the remodelling of the commission, saying that although Godolphin had claimed &#145;he had experience, and was uncorrupt&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1694&#150;5</i>, 179) his own intelligence indicated &#145;he does show great partiality in preferring officers who are disaffected to the Government&#146;. In 1700 Werden unsuccessfully tried to become a commissioner for Irish forfeitures. He was restored to the customs commission in June 1703, remained in office throughout Anne's reign, and was finally removed in November 1714. He died on 29 October 1716, probably in his house in Pall Mall, and was buried at St Martin-in-the-Fields on 7 November, being succeeded by John, his son from his second marriage. His daughter Lucy married Charles Beauclerk, second duke of St Albans.<br>
