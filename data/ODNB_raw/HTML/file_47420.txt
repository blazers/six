<span class="headword">Bevan,  Robert Cooper Lee</span>  (1809&#150;1890), <span class="occ">banker</span>, was born on 8 February 1809 at Hale End, Walthamstow, the eldest son of David Bevan (1774&#150;1846), banker, and his wife, Favell Bourke Lee (1780&#150;1841), who came from a prominent Caribbean slave-owning family. His father was a partner in the Quaker private banking firm of Barclay, Bevan &amp; Co. of Lombard Street in the City of London. The writer <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/19345/', "Favell Lee Mortimer")</script> was his sister. In 1826&#151;the year Robert left Harrow School to matriculate at Trinity College, Oxford&#151;David Bevan had to withdraw from the management of the bank after a paralytic seizure. A few years later, when his father's condition worsened, Robert ended his studies without a degree and took his father's place as a partner.<br>
<br>The Bevans, unlike the other partners and many of their provincial banking correspondents, were not Quakers, for Robert's grandfather, Silvanus, had been disowned by the Friends for marrying a non-Quaker in 1773. However, in the course of the nineteenth century, secular and religious forces led most other Quaker bankers, including many of Robert's Barclay and Tritton partners, also to desert their faith. Bevan acquired all the apparently un-Quakerly trappings of the establishment at an early age: he was not only educated at Harrow and Oxford, but his religion was Anglican, and in politics he was a Conservative. Married twice, Bevan's first marriage, on 24 February 1836, was to Lady Agneta Elisabeth Yorke (<i>d</i>. 1851), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30244/', "Admiral Sir Joseph Sydney Yorke")</script> and sister of the fourth earl of Hardwicke; and then on 30 April 1856 he married (Emma) Frances Shuttleworth (1827&#150;1909) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/47622/', "Bevan, (Emma) Frances")</script>], daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25492/', "Philip Nicholas Shuttleworth")</script>, the bishop of Chichester. There were fourteen children from the marriages, including the banker <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/46629/', "Francis Augustus Bevan (1840&#150;1919)")</script>, the conspiracy theorist <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/71529/', "Nesta Helen Webster (1875&#150;1960)")</script>, and the scholars <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/31868/', "Anthony Ashley Bevan (1859&#150;1933)")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/31869/', "Edwyn Robert Bevan (1870&#150;1943)")</script>.<br>
<br>The owner of 3913 acres, Bevan had estates at Trent Park at New Barnet on the northern outskirts of London, and also in Wiltshire, as well as houses in London and at Brighton and, in later years, a villa in Cannes. Yet, after an evangelical conversion in his late twenties, Quakers could not wholeheartedly condemn him for &#145;conformity to the world&#146;, for he began to lead a far more religious life than others who had experienced this establishment conditioning. His wives shared his austere, uncompromising religiosity and his second wife became in middle life a member of the reclusive Plymouth Brethren sect. Robert Bevan arranged open prayer meetings daily at 12.30 at the bank's offices in Lombard Street; he gave up hunting (a favourite sport in his youth) on grounds of conscience; and he spent extensively on church building and other charities, including the foundation of the London City Mission.<br>
<br>Barclays (as his bank was increasingly known) was at the centre of a network of (mainly Quaker) country bankers. The network proved its value in the financial crisis of 1824&#150;5, while his father was at the helm. The Lombard Street bank then co-ordinated assistance to those firms short of easily accessible funds, but otherwise strong; while numerous insolvent banks failed, Quaker bankers and others with Barclay, Bevan &amp; Co. connections generally did well. After Robert became senior partner of the Lombard Street bank, he faced similar tests. Perhaps his most difficult decision was in the mid-1860s, when his partners' Norwich relations, the Gurneys, attempted to rescue the once exemplary (but by then badly managed) London billbroking firm of Overend Gurney &amp; Co. The ultimate collapse of Overend Gurney in 1866 ruined the Gurneys, but Bevan firmly refused either to back the Gurneys with the Lombard Street bank's resources or to recommend a Bank of England rescue of the insolvent (rather than merely illiquid) firm. However, the partners of Barclays did help individually on a charitable basis after the Gurney bankruptcies.<br>
<br>Bevan became the doyen of conservative private bankers. By 1890 his firm was the second largest of the London private bankers (after Glyn Mills &amp; Co.) by its balance-sheet size. Its profits had tripled during Bevan's fifty-year career as an active banker and ten as a sleeping partner (in later life he wintered in Cannes). His estate at the end of his life made him indisputably a millionaire. There were several richer nineteenth-century bankers, but the partners' rate of profit at Barclay, Bevan &amp; Co. under his leadership was normally about 30 per cent, better than that achieved by leading merchant bankers. Bevan showed that conservative private banking could more than hold its own within the provincial correspondent banking and short-term business lending functions in which his firm excelled, against the (less profitable) joint-stock banks that grew to dominate English banking during his career.<br>
<br>Robert Bevan died on 22 July 1890 at Trent Park, New Barnet, from gout and other debilitating illnesses.<br>
