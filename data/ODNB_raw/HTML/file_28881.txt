<span class="headword">Watt,  James</span>  (1769&#150;1848), <span class="occ">engineer and manufacturer</span>, was born on 5 February 1769 at Glasgow, the son of the engineer <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28880/', "James Watt (1736&#150;1819)")</script> and his first wife and cousin, Margaret Miller, who died in 1773. The younger James had difficulties with his father and his father's second wife, Anne McGrigor (<i>d</i>. 1832), almost from the age of six.<br>
<br>Like Matthew Robinson Boulton, with whom he later took over the direction of Boulton and Watt, James Watt first went to the Revd Henry Pickering's school at Winson Green, Birmingham. In 1780 his father wrote to a schoolmaster, perhaps the Revd Deane of Shifnal, Shropshire, saying that he had received complaints about young James's &#145;insolence, sauciness and disobedience&#146;  (J. Watt, 5 Aug 1780, Doldowlod MSS). His father wanted him disciplined for this and for his slovenliness. Yet, at twelve years of age, Watt was reading Caesar and Virgil as well as extracting cube roots. His father wanted him to continue in writing, drawing, Latin, arithmetic, and Euclidean geometry, and to begin French and dancing. At fifteen he was then steered towards a practical education at John Wilkinson's ironworks at Bersham, near Wrexham. There, for a year, he studied bookkeeping, geometry, and algebra in his leisure-hours and spent three hours every day in the carpenter's shop. His father asked about his progress in carpentry and requested a drawing of a furnace from him. He was then sent off to France <i>en route</i> to Geneva.<br>
<br>James Watt senior insisted upon a &#145;punctual and regular correspondence&#146; from his son, constantly complaining about his handwriting and telling him that &#145;he succeeds best who writes like a correct Speaker in common conversation&#146;  (J. Watt, letter, 13 July 1784, Doldowlod MSS). The great engineer's own letters can be compared only to <span class="italic">Lord Chesterfield's Letters to his Son</span>. In Geneva young Watt was to study the classics, history, science, mathematics, drawing, and French. His father watched his morals and manners. He was not to curse, gossip, drink, or gamble but he was to show respect, pay his share of the reckoning, and not to read novels or frequent the theatre. He was to learn to fence. In Switzerland he was under the roof of the chemist Nicolas-Th&eacute;odore de Saussure and was introduced to a number of other Swiss natural scientists, including J. A. de Luc and M. A. Pictet.<br>
<br>By July 1785 Watt's father was thinking of sending him to a merchant's counting-house in Germany or to G&ouml;ttingen University &#145;to pursue the study of usefull science&#146;  (J. Watt, letter, 17 July 1785, Doldowlod MSS). In August, at the home of one Reinhard, at Eisenach in Saxony, Watt settled down to study German, after which he might go to the miners' school at Freiburg to study &#145;Mechanicks mathematicks &amp; metallurgy&#146;  (ibid.). If this plan failed, he could go on to a counting-house in Leipzig.<br>
<br>Watt returned to England in 1788 and joined the firm of Taylor and Maxwell, fustian manufacturers, in Manchester. (Charles Taylor was later to become the secretary of the Society for the Encouragement of Arts, Commerce, and Manufactures.) His father had at last realized that the future of the steam engine lay with Lancashire rather than Cornwall. Besides learning his business and acting as an agent for steam engines, Watt quickly entered into the intellectual life of Manchester, consorting with Dr Thomas Percival, Thomas Henry and his sons, Thomas Cooper MD, Joseph Baker, Dr John Ferriar, Joseph Priestley junior, Thomas and Richard Walker, and others. With Ferriar, he became co-secretary of the Manchester Literary and Philosophical Society (known as the Lit. and Phil.) and submitted two papers, one on &#145;a Mine in which the Aerated Barytes is found&#146;  (<span class="italic">Memoirs</span>, 598) and the other on the effects of <i>terra ponderosa</i> given to animals. These were published in the <span class="italic">Memoirs</span> of the society in 1790. He also attended lectures by Thomas Henry and Charles White at the College of Arts and Sciences. He read extracts from his translation of a work by Jacob Joseph Winterl to the Lit. and Phil. and was encouraged by James Keir to translate a work by Christoph Meiners. He assisted Keir with the article on bleaching in Keir's <span class="italic">Dictionary of Chemistry</span> (1789), a book to which Charles Taylor contributed articles on dyeing and calico printing. Watt secured Lorenz Crell as a corresponding member of the Lit. and Phil. and gained subscribers to Crell's <span class="italic">Annalen</span>. In these years he was close to the &#145;young Turks&#146; at Boulton and Watt&#151;Peter Ewart, John Southern, and James Lawson&#151;who favoured the French Revolution.<br>
<br>Through Thomas Cooper, Watt joined the Manchester Constitutional Society, which met at Thomas Walker's house. He tried to drum up a message of sympathy to Joseph Priestley after the riots in 1791. Joining the firm of Richard and Thomas Walker, he planned a sales trip to France, intending also to sell Watt copying machines. On 4 March 1792 he arrived in St Omer with Cooper, proceeded to Paris, and met Antoine-Laurent Lavoisier and other leading scientific figures; but the talk was of politics not chemistry. On 22 March 1792 he wrote to his father that Cooper and he had presented an address from the Manchester Constitutional Society to the Club des Jacobins. Thomas Walker, Cooper, and he were immediately denounced in the Commons by Edmund Burke as traitors. His father wrote to Dr Joseph Black:<blockquote>My son James's conduct has given me much uneasiness, though I have nothing to accuse him of except being a violent Jacobin, that is bad enough in my eyes, who abhor democracy, as much as I do Tyranny, being in fact another sort of it. (J. Watt to Dr J. Black, 17 July 1798, Doldowlod MSS)</blockquote>Watt witnessed the massacres of 10 August in France, still a revolutionary. In 1792 or 1793 he met William Wordsworth in Paris and long remained a friend. Watt may have been denounced as an English spy and forced to flee to Italy. Despite the <span class="roman">Traitorous Correspondence Act</span> of 1793 he returned safely to England in 1794.<br>
<br>From that time forward Watt became increasingly useful to Boulton and Watt. With M. R. Boulton, he investigated and prosecuted pirates of his father's patents, he promoted the copying machine, he introduced the principle of &#145;rationalization&#146; into the construction of Soho foundry in 1796, he recruited founders from Wilkinson's works, and he took over the main direction of the steam-engine company. In assessing the contribution of the second generation of Boulton and Watt, a useful distinction describes the parents as &#145;builders&#146; and the sons as &#145;organisers&#146;  (Roll, 270). Nevertheless, it is clear that Watt earned his father's respect, and was able to carve out an independent career.<br>
<br>In 1817 Watt purchased Bell's steamship <i>Caledonia</i> and, refitting her with two 14 hp Boulton and Watt engines, took her to the Netherlands and ascended the Rhine as far as Koblenz. It is claimed that this was the first steam crossing of the channel. On the way home the ship visited Antwerp and Rotterdam, returning to the Thames in the spring of 1818. As a result of this and other experiments, the manufacture of marine engines increased in his firm, culminating perhaps in HMS <i>James Watt</i> (1853), fitted with Soho engines. Watt finished his days in grand style at Aston Hall, having become a pillar of society as well as something of a dandy. Unmarried, he died at Aston Hall, Birmingham, on 2 June 1848.<br>
