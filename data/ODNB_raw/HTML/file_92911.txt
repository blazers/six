</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Causley,  Charles Stanley</span>  (1917&#150;2003), <span class="occ">poet</span>, was born on 24 August 1917 at Riverside in the parish of St Thomas, Launceston, Cornwall, the only child of Charles Samuel Causley (1885&#150;1924), groom and gardener, and his wife, Laura Jane, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Bartlett (1888&#150;1971), domestic servant. With characteristically wry precision he was later to note that the day of his birth was &#145;the 1,117th day of the &#147;Great War&#148;&#146;  (&#145;A kitchen in the morning&#146;, 33), and that he had always delighted in the fact that his mother, whose maiden name meant &#145;little Bartholomew&#146;, had shown &#145;marvellously unconscious prescience&#146; by producing him on St Bartholomew's day  (ibid.). His father, who had been a driver in the Army Service Corps on the western front, died from the effects of German gas when Causley was seven, and he was brought up by his mother, to whom he remained particularly close. When she suffered a stroke in 1966 he spent much time with her, talking about her youth, and found himself &#145;through the simple, clear glass she held up &hellip; able to observe, as with new eyes, my own childhood; and I wrote about it in poem after poem&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Listener</span>, 17 March 1977, 338). That simple, clear glass is emblematic of Causley's own gift throughout his career, and his immediate, popular appeal owed much to an ability to explore contemporary experience in familiar, traditional forms.<br>
<br>Causley was educated first at the local elementary school which he described as a &#145;huge granite and slate Noah's ark of a building&#146;  (&#145;A kitchen in the morning&#146;, 34) beached only 500 yards from his home, and then at Launceston College where he enjoyed reading and writing poetry&#151;a teacher &#145;(notably chary of awarding high marks) gave me ten out of ten for a sonnet&#146;  (ibid., 37). He left school at the age of sixteen to become a clerk in a builder's office. Several years of entrapment and boredom followed, but on a rare visit to London he bought a copy of Siegfried Sassoon's <span class="italic">War Poems</span> and this, giving him his first clear view of his father's world, led him on to read Robert Graves, Edmund Blunden, and Wilfred Owen, whose vivid accounts of conflict and its consequences made a profound impression on him. Then came his own war experience. Registering for service on the outbreak of the Second World War in the autumn of 1939, he chose to enlist in the Royal Navy and was drafted as a coder, later rising to acting petty officer. Although he never really found his sea legs, he relished the opportunity to travel, and wrote up a number of the events which took place on exotic terra firma in his anecdotal prose collection <span class="italic">Hands to Dance</span> (1951, revised and enlarged in 1979 as <span class="italic">Hands to Dance and Skylark</span>).<br>
<br>By the time he signed up for the war Causley had published a few plays that hardly attracted notice, but it was the navy life which became the making of him as a poet. As he later wrote:<blockquote>I think I became a working poet the day I joined the destroyer <i>Eclipse</i> at Scapa Flow in August, 1940 &hellip; I knew that at last I had found my first subject, as well as a form. Living and working on the lower-deck meant that if I was to write anything at all, then it would have to be in the kind of shorthand of experience (to use a horrible phrase) poetry happens to be. (&#145;Charles Causley writes&#146;, 2)</blockquote>Horrible phrase or not, that shorthand of experience became the poems that established Causley's reputation, and his first collection, <span class="italic">Farewell, Aggie Weston</span>, published in 1951 (Aggie Weston was the familiar term used by sailors for the hostels founded in seaports by Dame Agnes Weston), was the work of a poet who had clearly found his working method and distinctive voice. This collection was followed by <span class="italic">Survivor's Leave</span> (1953), <span class="italic">Union Street</span> (1957), and <span class="italic">Johnny Alleluia</span> (1961). The poems in all four collections made vivid use of the traditional ballad form, dealing with wartime experience in imagery that brought together nursery rhyme, folksong, and mess-room vernacular often spoken by or on behalf of the Christ-like figure of a wounded innocent. By turns lyrical and bluntly down-to-earth, as if Walter de la Mare and Rudyard Kipling&#151;two poets much admired by Causley&#151;were writing in collaboration, a poem like &#145;Able Seaman Hodge Remembers Ceylon&#146; was a typical example:<blockquote>
<div>O the blackthorn and the wild cherry<br>
</div>
<div>And the owl in the rotting oak tree<br>
</div>
<div>Are part of the Cornish landscape<br>
</div>
<div>Which is more than can be said for me.<br>
</div>
<div> 
<br>
</div>
<div>O the drum and the coconut fiddle<br>
</div>
<div>And the taste of Arabian tea,<br>
</div>
<div>The Vimto on the veranda<br>
</div>
<div>And the arrack shops on the quay<br>
</div> (<span class="italic">Collected Poems</span>, 29)</blockquote>On demobilization Causley trained as a teacher at Peterborough Training College and was then back home in Launceston, a part of the Cornish landscape again. He taught for the next thirty years&#151;until he took early retirement in 1976&#151;at the local primary school. Though he made amused reference to landing up in a chalk Siberia, he was by all accounts a much-loved and respected schoolmaster. He discovered early on how a classroom of unruly children could be enchanted by hearing ballads read aloud and it is hardly surprising, given the lyrical and narrative gifts already displayed in his work for adults, that he should have begun to publish poems for children which soon achieved classic status, were widely anthologized, and were gathered from their various individual collections in 1996 into a handsome <span class="italic">Collected Poems for Children</span> to celebrate his eightieth birthday. He was a fine anthologist himself; his <span class="italic">Puffin Book of Magic Verse</span> (1974) contained a perceptive introduction which addressed the name and nature of poetry with a sense of wonder and mystery which spoke directly to young readers. Perhaps what made him such an excellent writer for children was that unsentimental access to primal insight which led some to compare his work to William Blake's <span class="italic">Songs of Innocence and Experience</span> and which, though their poetic voices were very different, placed him alongside Ted Hughes (one of his strongest admirers) as a poet for whom the interplay of childhood and adult experience was a continual source of inspiration. In 1982 Hughes, in company with other distinguished poets including Philip Larkin, Seamus Heaney, and Kathleen Raine, paid tribute to Causley in a celebratory volume, <span class="italic">Poems for Charles Causley</span>, edited by Michael Hulse.<br>
<br>Increasingly, as his reputation grew as a poet of international stature, Causley enjoyed a local eminence in Launceston that amounted to the freedom of the parish. Writing in <span class="italic">The Listener</span> in 1977 he described a conversation he had with a Canadian expatriate writer he was showing round the town, who suggested that the difference between them was that his host knew where he would be buried. &#145;He may well be right&#146;, Causley observed, &#145;but what concerns me more is that I should never fall into the trap of thinking life in my parish unchanging&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Listener</span>, 22 Sept 1977, 370). His profound sense of place and inheritance placed him firmly among those poets such as his admired John Clare and Thomas Hardy for whom&#151;in the words of the Irish poet Patrick Kavanagh&#151;&#145;parochialism is universal: it deals with the fundamentals&#146;. His collection <span class="italic">Underneath the Water</span> (1969), published two years after his mother's stroke, was his finest to date, and very much the work of a writer who had &#145;come home&#146;, though with no inclination to roost. It contained several of the poems for which he became best known, including &#145;Timothy Winters&#146;, &#145;Ballad of the Bread Man&#146;, and &#145;By St Thomas Water&#146;.<br>
<br>Though always happiest in Launceston (in <span class="italic">Who's Who</span> he gave &#145;the rediscovery of his native town&#146; as one of his recreations), Causley travelled widely after his retirement from teaching and accepted invitations to be writer-in-residence at the University of Western Australia, the Footscray Institute of Technology, Victoria, and the School of Fine Arts, Banff, Alberta. His later collections&#151;<span class="italic">Secret Destinations</span> (1984), <span class="italic">A Field of Vision</span> (1988), and updated <span class="italic">Collected Poems</span> in 1992, 1997, and 2000&#151;continued to celebrate his locality and, increasingly, his ancestry, often in a discursive, anecdotal vein very different from the balladeering of his most popular work, but also reflected his life as a keenly observant traveller.<br>
<br>Causley received many honours. He was awarded the queen's gold medal for poetry in 1967, given an honorary doctorate by Exeter University in 1977, appointed CBE in 1986, and, in 2001, elected one of the ten companions of literature by the Royal Society of Literature. There was, however, one honour which he was particularly delighted to receive. As a boy, he had written to Richmal Crompton, the creator of William Brown, asking if he could join William's gang. A letter came back from Crompton's publishers informing him, with regret, that there was at present no vacancy. Having learned of this, friends arranged that on his eighty-fourth birthday he would receive another letter to let him know that there was now indeed a vacancy and that he was duly invited to apply.<br>
<br>A fine reader of his work (he retained his distinctive Cornish accent), Causley was recorded shortly before his death for the recently established Poetry Archive. The reading showed no sign of infirmity but by this time, following a serious fall, he was unable to live at home and the recording was made at Kernow House, a nursing home in Landlake Road, Launceston, where he died on 4 November 2003. He was buried in St Thomas's Church, Launceston, at which a memorial service was held on 1 December. He never married, and had no children.<br>
