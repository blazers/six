<span class="headword">Stewart,  John</span>, third earl of Buchan  (<em>c.</em>1380&#150;1424), <span class="occ">magnate and soldier</span>, was the second son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26502/', "Robert Stewart, first duke of Albany (c.1340&#150;1420)")</script>, and the eldest son of Albany's second marriage, to Muriella, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15275/', "Sir William Keith (d. in or after 1407)")</script>, the marischal [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/54235/', "Keith family (per. c.1300&#150;c.1530)")</script>]. His initial role, in the north-east of Scotland, reflected the alliance between Albany and the Keiths, a major family in Aberdeenshire. He received the lands of Coull and O'Neill from his father in 1398 and those of Aboyne and Touchfraser from Keith in 1407. The title earl of Buchan was the product of Albany's ambitions in the north, though it took time for these to come to fruition. Following the death of the previous earl, Alexander Stewart, in summer 1405, his heir in the earldom was his brother Albany, who, however, at once granted it to his son John. But there were very few lands to support the title, and John was styled only lord of Buchan for several years. He was recorded thus on 26 June 1411, but by the following May he had begun to be referred to as earl, in charters and other documents. Even so it was only after 1415, when Euphemia Leslie, countess of Ross, who was in Albany's guardianship, was persuaded to resign her rights to John Stewart before retiring to a nunnery, that he came to have a substantial territorial base, made up of the earldom of Ross and the lordships of Nairn, Strathglass, and Kingedward. The last of these comprised about half the original earldom of Buchan. Buchan, however, never established himself as a great northern magnate. Although one later source says he was at the battle of Harlaw in 1411, regional power lay in the hands of the two main protagonists at that battle, Donald MacDonald, lord of the Isles, and Alexander, earl of Mar. The alliance of Albany with the latter probably led to a gradual handover of Buchan's interests to Mar after 1423 through grants to Mar's followers, a trend facilitated by Buchan's involvement elsewhere.<br>
<br>From 1402 Albany had a more immediate need for Buchan. The capture of John's elder brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26499/', "Murdoch Stewart")</script>, at Homildon in 1402 left his 62-year-old father without an active political heir. The regular appearance of Buchan at court from 1406 and his appointment to the office of chamberlain, held by Albany for over twenty years, suggest that Buchan was being groomed as a stopgap successor. As Murdoch's own sons reached adulthood this role decreased in importance, but Buchan remained an element in his father's planning. About 1413, after the settlement of tensions between Albany and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7862/', "Archibald Douglas, fourth earl of Douglas (c.1369&#150;1424)")</script>, Buchan married the earl's daughter, Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1451), to cement the deal.<br>
<br>The match was to have major implications for Buchan's career. His connection with the Douglases was a crucial factor in his being chosen joint leader of an army raised in Scotland and sent to help the French against Henry V of England. Much of the army was raised from Douglas's following in Scotland and Buchan's joint commander was Archibald, earl of Wigtown, Douglas's son, though Buchan seems to have been the principal leader. Both men arrived in France in the autumn of 1419. The rest of Buchan's career was to be spent in French service and, while he returned to Scotland on diplomatic and recruiting missions, his interests increasingly centred on the Scots army in France. His breakthrough in this service came at the battle of Baug&eacute; in Anjou on Good Friday (22 March) 1421. In a confused running battle Buchan defeated an English force, killing its leader, Thomas, duke of Clarence, brother of Henry V.<br>
<br>This morale-raising victory led to greater Scottish involvement in France. Buchan was given the lands of Ch&acirc;tillon-sur-Indre, the services of an astrologer, and the office of constable of France, and for him and his men alike the rewards to be won in France far outdid those to be had in Scotland. Pay of 30,000 &eacute;cus was distributed among the army of Scots for just two months in 1423, and individuals could make their fortunes. Buchan's secretary, Christian Chambers, was paid over 1000 livres tournois to join the dauphin's bodyguard. Buchan himself became a major commander. In 1421 and 1422 he won successes, but the collapse of a campaign which he led in the &Icirc;le-de-France in early 1423 was due to dissension between the French and their foreign constable.<br>
<br>In 1423 Buchan returned to Scotland at the head of an embassy. His aim was to induce the earl of Douglas to enter French service. Although he had to contend with English attempts to block his efforts by negotiating the release of James I, who it was hoped would want peace with England, Buchan achieved his aim by treating with all Scottish parties. By October he had reached an agreement with his brother Murdoch, now duke of Albany, which probably involved the protection of Buchan's lands in his absence and the possibility of using the army in France as a weapon in Scottish politics. In March 1424, as James entered Scotland, Buchan returned to France with Douglas, now duke of Touraine, who led a huge Franco-Scottish force into Normandy. But on 17 August 1424 dissensions between Scots and French contributed to the defeat of their army by the English and the deaths of Douglas and Buchan at the battle of Verneuil. The earl of Buchan had become a figure of international stature and his death was perceived as an important event at the French court as well as in Scotland, where it seriously weakened the position of his Albany Stewart kinsmen. He was buried at St Gatiens's Cathedral in Tours.<br>
