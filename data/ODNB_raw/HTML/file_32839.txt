<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Dixon, Sir  Pierson John <span class="st"> [Bob]</span></span>  (1904&#150;1965), <span class="occ">diplomatist</span>, was born on 13 November 1904 at Englefield Green, Surrey, the elder son and eldest of the four children of Pierson John Dixon (1868&#150;1934), estate agent, and his wife, Helen Barbara (Nellie), daughter of James Ownby Beales, a royal caterer. His forenames reflected a long-standing family tradition, and he was in practice always known as Bob. His childhood was not particularly happy&#151;his father had persistent financial difficulties, was often absent from home, and had an increasingly strained marriage. The children were badly off and undernourished. Dixon's intellectual ability became his escape from these unhappy circumstances. He was educated at Bedford School and there began consistently to win academic prizes. This run of success culminated in 1922 when he won two scholarships allowing him to go up to Pembroke College, Cambridge, in the following year to read classics. Further prizes, notably the prestigious Craven scholarship (1926), enabled him to live a reasonably comfortable and active life as a student. In 1927 he followed his double first-class degree by being awarded a junior research fellowship at Pembroke. A life as a classical scholar appeared to beckon. He had moreover fallen passionately in love not only with Greece, where he had travelled in 1927, but also with (Alexandra) Ismene Melas, an Englishwoman who had been brought up largely in Greece. She was the widow of Michael Melas and daughter of Shirley Clifford Atchley, first secretary at the British embassy in Athens. They married on 4 July 1928 and had two daughters, Jennifer (<i>b</i>. 1930) and Ann (<i>b</i>. 1941), and a son, Piers (<i>b</i>. 1928), who was Conservative MP for Truro from 1970 to 1974.<br>
<br>In 1929 Dixon's career switched from academia to diplomacy. He passed the Foreign Office examination comfortably, emerging second out of a distinguished intake which included Harold Caccia, later permanent secretary of the Foreign Office, and was appointed a third secretary in October 1929. Postings in Spain (1932&#150;6), Turkey (1936&#150;8), and Italy (1938&#150;40) followed in close succession, providing Dixon with a solid grounding in the workings of the diplomatic corps. His spell in the Italian capital also allowed him to observe at first hand British efforts to appease Mussolini. He was, meanwhile, promoted second secretary in October 1934 and first secretary in December 1939. It was not until the outbreak of the Second World War, however, that his career really took off.<br>
<br>Dixon's wartime years were mainly spent in close proximity to Anthony Eden. In 1941 he accompanied the foreign secretary on a lengthy mission to the Middle East and the Balkans, and two years later, in November 1943, he was appointed Eden's principal private secretary, with the rank of counsellor. In this capacity he was present at many of the crucial allied encounters in the course of which both the shape of wartime strategy and the post-war settlement were determined. At the Yalta summit in February 1945 he was responsible for co-ordinating the work of the British delegation and was deeply involved in the frantic attempts to draft a satisfactory communiqu&eacute; before Roosevelt's earlier than expected departure.<br>
<br>Midway through the Potsdam conference the general election result in 1945 prompted a change in the British government. Labour's victory, however, had no professional impact on Dixon, since he was immediately appointed principal private secretary to Ernest Bevin, Eden's successor. His position at the heart of British foreign policy making thus remained secure. Indeed in many ways the spell as Bevin's right-hand man must rank as the most impressive of Dixon's career. The foreign secretary's schedule was arduous, dominated by the increasingly fraught conferences of foreign ministers at which the wartime allies struggled to contain their growing mistrust of each other and to reconcile their highly divergent priorities for the post-war world. Against this gloomy backdrop Dixon had not merely to act as companion, counsellor, speech-writer, and administrator for Bevin, but also to join the foreign secretary in the late-night singsongs which marked the end of at least some of the foreign ministers' meetings. He was appointed CMG in 1945 and CB in 1948.<br>
<br>In January 1948 Dixon received his first ambassadorial posting, to Prague. According to Bevin's biographer this was the direct result of Dixon's relationship with the foreign secretary, since Bevin had identified Czechoslovakia as a likely flashpoint of East&#150;West tension and wanted a British representative there upon whom he could rely. This proved all too prescient. Within a month of his arrival, Dixon could only watch powerlessly as the non-Communist ministers resigned <i>en masse</i> from the Czech government, and Klement Gottwald and the Czech communists used the opportunity to declare a state of emergency and seize total power. Few British diplomats could have had a clearer illustration both of how tense East&#150;West relations had become and of Britain's incapacity to exercise a decisive influence over the downward spiral of events in central and eastern Europe. Dixon was appointed KCMG in January 1950, and in June of that year returned to London as deputy under-secretary of state, with responsibility first for political and then for economic affairs. He also served as UK representative on the Brussels Treaty Permanent Commission, with the personal rank of ambassador, until November 1952.<br>
<br>Dixon's next foreign posting gave him an even more graphic demonstration of the slippage of Britain's power: he was posted to New York as Britain's permanent representative to the United Nations in March 1954. Within two years of arrival he was swept up by the growing crisis caused by Nasser's nationalization of the Suez Canal. As a result it fell to him to justify the heavily criticized build-up of British military power in the region, to exercise for the first time ever the British veto in the Security Council in an effort to prevent a resolution being passed which would require members to refrain from the use of force, and to represent Britain at the emotional general assembly debate of 1&#150;2 November at which the British, French, and Israeli military action was condemned by sixty-four votes to five. The emotional strain of defending a policy about which he had serious personal misgivings was considerable; looking back on the episode he later wrote:<blockquote>It really was an extraordinary situation in which we were quite incompetent to influence the course of events. Flanked by our faithful Australians and New Zealanders, we wandered about the UN halls like lost spirits. Our best friends averted their gaze or burst into tears as we passed. (Dixon, 277)</blockquote>Despite the harm done to Britain's international standing, Dixon's own reputation was only enhanced by the Suez episode. Thus he was promoted GCMG in 1957 and rewarded with the highly sought-after Paris embassy as his next posting, in October 1960, in succession to Sir Gladwyn Jebb. In 1961 this already demanding role was made still more important when he was asked also to act as leader at official level of the British delegation seeking to negotiate entry into the EEC. After his stints at the shoulders of Eden and Bevin, he was now to act as principal lieutenant to Edward Heath, lord privy seal and the minister responsible for the Brussels negotiations.<br>
<br>Dixon's diplomatic swansong revealed both his strengths and his limitations. As ambassador in Paris he did succeed in establishing a reasonable, if necessarily distant, rapport with General de Gaulle. This allowed him to forewarn Whitehall that the French president harboured strong misgivings about the enlargement of the EEC. In October 1962 he sent a dispatch to the prime minister predicting that de Gaulle would veto Britain's entry. Macmillan is said to have read the report and scribbled in the margin &#145;interesting but not convincing&#146;  (Beloff, 155). But the negotiations in Brussels also highlighted the discomfort felt by a generalist such as Dixon in dealing with the highly technical and economic nature of the multilateral negotiations between Britain and the six EEC member states. On most of the substantive issues which dominated the Brussels agenda, his grasp was much less sure than that of his deputy, Eric Roll (formerly an official in the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food). Moreover Dixon never seemed entirely at home in the Brussels of the early EEC. Obliged to move constantly between Paris and the Belgian capital, not to mention trips back to London for consultations, he never built up the network of contacts and the feel for Community matters which would have greatly facilitated his task. He could thus do little to bridge the significant gap in attitude and understanding which developed between those members of the British team who were posted in Brussels for the duration of the talks and those more senior figures who flew in on the eve of each major meeting. How costly this inexperience in Community affairs proved is hard to determine; it is nevertheless significant that Britain's later, successful, negotiations to enter the EEC in 1970&#150;72 were masterminded by Sir Con O'Neill, a man who was as much a Brussels &#145;insider&#146; as Dixon had been an inexperienced &#145;outsider&#146;.<br>
<br>Paris, where Dixon remained until February 1965, proved his final posting. Having experienced a couple of years of poor Anglo-French relations in the aftermath of de Gaulle's veto, he then left the diplomatic service. His plan was to return in his retirement to the classical studies which he had left nearly forty years earlier. (He had, meanwhile, published a study of <span class="italic">The Iberians of Spain and their Relations with the Aegean World</span>, 1939, as well as two works of fiction set in antiquity, <span class="italic">Farewell, Catullus</span>, 1953, and <span class="italic">The Glittering Horn</span>, 1958, and a biography, <span class="italic">Pauline: Napoleon's Favourite Sister</span>, 1964.) Such plans were cut short by his death from a heart attack in Egham, Surrey, on 22 April 1965. He was survived by his wife and their three children.<br>
<br>Dixon's career was at one and the same time exceptionally distinguished and highly emblematic of a generation of British diplomats. He was catapulted by the Second World War into a position of remarkable influence and was privileged to be present when many of the crucial decisions about both wartime strategy and the post-war world were made. But the years which followed, although not without professional satisfaction, underlined how changed were the circumstances of the country which he represented. His experiences in New York and Brussels in particular could only emphasize how dramatically Britain's influence had dwindled since its wartime position as one of the &#145;big three&#146;.<br>
