<span class="headword">Knight,  Anne</span>  (1786&#150;1862), <span class="occ">slavery abolitionist and campaigner for women's rights</span>, was born on 2 November 1786 at Chelmsford, Essex, the third of the eight children of William Knight (1756&#150;1814), wholesale grocer, and his wife, Priscilla, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Allen (1753&#150;1829). Her mother was first cousin to the philanthropist William Allen, while she herself was first cousin to the chemist William Allen Miller. Her younger sister Maria (1791&#150;1870) married in 1814 the abolitionist John Candler (1787&#150;1869) and with him travelled to the West Indies and United States in the anti-slavery cause; they were for some years (1842&#150;6) superintendents of The Retreat, York, the Quaker mental hospital founded by William Tuke.<br>
<br>In 1824, having by then a good knowledge of French and German, Anne Knight travelled on the continent with a group of fellow Quakers, combining sightseeing with religious and philanthropic concerns. From her base in the Chelmsford Ladies' Anti-Slavery Society she was deeply involved with the anti-slavery movement, travelling frequently to London and working with Thomas Clarkson, Joseph Sturge, Richard and Hannah Webb, and Elizabeth Pease (later Nichol). During the 1830s she returned several times to France in the same cause, in 1834 undertaking a speaking tour. The 1840 World's Anti-Slavery Convention in London gave her the opportunity to meet such American abolitionists as William Lloyd Garrison, Wendell Phillips, and Lucretia Mott. The movement for women's suffrage in Britain has been dated from the exclusion of women from the floor of this conference, for it drew women's attention to their marginal status within the movement, and highlighted the limitations placed on their capacity to act in the public sphere. In July 1848 the first women's rights convention in the United States was held at Seneca Falls, New York. The previous year an anonymous leaflet was issued in Britain claiming that &#145;Never will the nations of the earth be well governed, until both sexes, as well as all parties, are fully represented and have an influence, a voice, and a hand in the enactment and administration of the laws&#146;. It has been persuasively argued that the author was Anne Knight. Certainly from the 1840s she had been writing frequent letters (she was a voluminous correspondent) to American abolitionists, including Angelina Grimk&eacute;, and she was capable of sharp rejoinders to Chartists who suggested that the class struggle took precedence over that for women's rights.<br>
<br>Although Knight was in many ways typical of nonconformist women abolitionists, her views were more radical than many: a sympathizer with Chartism, she was interested in the British and French utopian socialist movements, maintained links with the White Quakers in Ireland, and in the 1840s supported the radical Garrisonian wing of the American abolition movement. Her support for women's rights led her in 1851 to be involved in forming the first organization for women's suffrage in Britain, the Sheffield Female Reform Association. In 1847 or 1848 Anne Knight left Chelmsford for Paris and, after living there enthusiastically (despite her Quaker upbringing) through the year of revolutions, she was at the international peace conference in Paris in 1849. Lucretia Mott described her in the 1840s as &#145;a singular looking woman&#151;very pleasant and polite&#146;  (F. B. Tolles, ed., <span class="italic">Slavery and &#145;the Woman Question&#146;</span>, 1952, 29).<br>
<br>In the late 1850s Anne Knight moved to Waldersbach, a village in the Vosges, south-west of Strasbourg. This had been the home of the pastor Jean-Fr&eacute;d&eacute;ric Oberlin (1740&#150;1820), whose philanthropic work she revered. Here she lived for the last few years of her life, lodging with Oberlin's grandson, and died there after a short illness on 4 November 1862.<br>
<br>Researches into Anne Knight's life have been hindered by persistent confusion of her with another <a name="cosubject_61838"></a><span class="headword">Anne Knight <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Waspe]</span></span>  (1792&#150;1860), <span class="occ">children's writer</span>. This Anne Knight was born at Woodbridge, Suffolk, on 28 October 1792, the eldest of the eight children of Jonathan Waspe (1756?&#150;1818), a leather-cutter, and his wife, Phebe, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Gibbs (1761&#150;1851). She married in 1818 her first cousin and fellow Quaker James Knight (1794&#150;1820) of Southwark. After her husband's early death, she returned to Woodbridge, where by 1826 she was keeping a school. She was a close friend of the poet Bernard Barton, and is frequently mentioned in Charles Lamb's letters to him. She was the author of a number of books for children, certainly <span class="italic">School-Room Lyrics</span> (1846), and most probably of <span class="italic">Poetic Gleanings</span> (1827), <span class="italic">Mornings in the Library</span> (1828), with a prefatory poem by Barton, and <span class="italic">Mary Gray</span> (1831), works which were previously ascribed to Anne Knight the social campaigner. Anne Knight the author died at her home in Woodbridge on 11 December 1860, and was buried in the Quaker burial-ground there.<br>
