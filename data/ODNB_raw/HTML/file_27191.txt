<span class="headword">Thom,  James</span>  (1802&#150;1850), <span class="occ">sculptor</span>, was born on 17 April 1802 at Skeoch Farm near Lochlee in Tarbolton parish, Ayrshire, and baptized at Tarbolton church on 19 April, the second of three sons of James Thom, a farm worker, and his wife, Margaret Morrison. His mother had been a frequent visitor to the home of the Burns family at Mossgiel and often recalled these visits in the presence of her family. They later moved to Meadowbank in the adjoining parish of Stair, where Thom attended a small local school. With his younger brother, Robert (1805&#150;1895), he was apprenticed to a firm of builders in Kilmarnock, Howie and Brown, where he was later employed as an ornamental carver. It was while renovating a tombstone in Crosbie kirkyard, Troon, in 1827 that he attracted the attention of David Auld, a barber in Ayr and custodian of the Burns monument at Alloway. On Auld's suggestion Thom carved a bust of Robert Burns from the copy of the portrait by Alexander Nasmyth that hung at the Burns monument. So impressed was Auld by the bust that he encouraged the sculptor to attempt a more ambitious work, and in 1828 Thom carved a life-size statue of Burns's Tam O'Shanter (Burns monument, Alloway). This was hewn without any preliminary sketches, directly from a block of rough-grained sandstone supplied from a neighbouring quarry. It was followed soon afterwards by the companion statue of Souter Johnnie (Burns monument, Alloway), for which a subscription was raised locally to meet the costs.<br>
<br>Before placing the statues at the Burns monument, Auld exhibited them in Ayr in July 1828 with great success. Afterwards he took them to Edinburgh&#151;where they received the praise of Sir Walter Scott&#151;and Glasgow. In April 1829 they went to London where the critics at once hailed them as inaugurating a new era in sculpture. They were seen as works of untutored genius unconstrained by academic convention and perfectly capturing the spirit of Burns's poetry. The homely naturalism of the pair's clothing&#151;particularly Tam's circular cap and knitted stockings&#151;and their expressive attitudes and humour were much admired. Sixteen replicas of the figures were said to have been ordered as well as small-scale reproductions carved by Thom and his brother Robert. Moreover, 1 shilling admission was charged to see the works, and the net profit raised from the exhibitions was said to have been nearly &pound;2000; this was divided equally between the sculptor, Auld, and the trustees of the Burns monument. Thom in addition received a special award of 20 guineas from the board of manufacturers in Scotland.<br>
<br>Encouraged by his successes, Thom made companion statues of the Landlord and Landlady from the same poem (Burns monument, Alloway; versions at the Cottage of Souter Johnnie, Kirkoswald, Ayrshire). He also carved a group representing <span class="italic">Old Mortality and his Pony</span> (1830) from Scott's novel, a figure based on Burns's song &#145;Willie brew'd a peck o' maut&#146;, and statues of Burns (1830) and Sir William Wallace (freestone, 1830; Wallace Tower, Ayr). In 1835 a second exhibition of Thom's work was organized in London though this did not meet with the success of the earlier venture.<br>
<br>About 1836 Thom went to America. Some of his works had been sent there for exhibition and sale but his agent had kept the proceeds. Recovering a portion of the money, Thom decided to remain in America and he settled at Newark, New Jersey, where in the following years he executed many replicas of his best-known works. They included the Tam and Souter figures, <span class="italic">Old Mortality and his Pony</span> (version at Laurel Hill cemetery, Philadelphia), a statue of Burns, as well as ornamental garden pieces. He is also credited with discovering the freestone quarries at Little Falls, New Jersey; these provided the materials for his architectural carvings at Trinity Church, New York. Having amassed a considerable fortune, he purchased a farm at Ramapo, Rockland county, New York, where he built a house to his own designs. He is said to have abandoned sculpture in his last years and died of consumption in his lodging house in New York city on 17 April 1850. He married and had a son, James Crawford Thom (<i>b</i>. 1835), who became an artist, and a daughter, Ada Crawford Thom.<br>
<br>Thom was one of a group of Scottish so-called &#145;mason sculptors&#146; (others were John Greenshields, Robert Forrest, David Anderson, and John Currie) who enjoyed a vogue in the early nineteenth century for genre works and familiar subjects from Scottish history and literature. Their direct and often humorous approach to everyday subject matter&#151;extending a distinct tradition in local stone carving&#151;significantly influenced the development of mainstream sculpture in both Britain and America during the mid-nineteenth century.<br>
<br>Another artist of the same name, <a name="cosubject_27190"></a><span class="headword">James Thom</span>  (<em>b. </em><em>c.</em>1785), <span class="occ">subject painter</span>, was born in Edinburgh. He studied art in his native city, and between 1808 and 1815 exhibited in Edinburgh some thirteen pictures, of which one or two were historical, three were portraits, and the rest of domestic subjects (including two designs for vignette illustrations to Burns). In 1815 he sent two pictures to the British Institution, and about that time moved to London where he had some success. In 1825 his <span class="italic">Young Recruit</span> was engraved by A. Duncan.<br>
