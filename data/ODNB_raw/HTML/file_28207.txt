<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Vere, Sir  Charles Broke</span>  (1779&#150;1843), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, born on 21 February 1779, was the second son of Philip Bowes Broke (1749&#150;1801) of Nacton, Suffolk, and his wife, Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1822), daughter and eventual heir of the Revd Charles Beaumont of Witnesham, Suffolk. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/3495/', "Rear-Admiral Sir Philip Bowes Vere Broke")</script> was his brother, whom he followed at Ipswich School. Charles was commissioned ensign in the 5th foot on 23 June 1796; lieutenant on 7 December, and captain on 21 February 1799. He served with the 5th in the expedition to the Netherlands in that year. He was at the Royal Military College from 1799 to 1803. In 1805, while on his way to join Lord Cathcart's expedition to the Elbe, he was wrecked on the Dutch coast, and made prisoner. He was soon released, and served in the force sent to South America under Craufurd in 1807. In the disastrous attack on Buenos Aires he was employed as assistant quartermaster-general. On 4 February 1808 he obtained a majority in the 5th.<br>
<br>After a short time on the staff in Ireland, Vere went to the Peninsula in 1809, and was appointed assistant quartermaster-general to the 4th division. He was present with it at Busaco, Albuera, Ciudad Rodrigo, Badajoz, and Salamanca; at Badajoz he was severely wounded while leading the men of the division to the breach in the Trinidad bastion. He was made brevet lieutenant-colonel on 27 April 1812. He had been removed from his regiment and made a permanent assistant quartermaster-general on 7 February 1811. During the campaigns of 1813&#150;14 he was employed on the headquarters staff. He not only attended to the routine business but also drafted operation orders. He was present at Vitoria, the Pyrenees, Nivelle, Nive, Orthez, and Toulouse. He received the gold cross with five clasps, and was made KCB in January 1815. In the 1815 campaign he was at first attached to Hill's corps, and Hill in his report of 20 June expressed his particular thanks to him; when Sir William Howe de Lancey was killed in the battle of Waterloo, Wellington chose Broke, though he was not the senior, to perform the duty of quartermaster-general. Broke fulfilled this role during the latter half of the battle, and on the march to Paris, and he was afterwards deputy quartermaster-general in the army of occupation. He received the Russian order of Vladimir (second class) and the Netherlands order of Wilhelm (second class). He was placed on half pay on 4 July 1823, and was promoted colonel on 27 May 1825, when, on Wellington's recommendation, he was appointed aide-de-camp to the king. He held this post until 10 January 1837, when he became major-general. In 1822 he had taken the additional name of Vere. A Conservative, in 1832 he contested East Suffolk without success, but he was returned second on the poll in 1835, and unopposed in 1837, while he again defeated the whig candidate in 1841. He published a pamphlet, <span class="italic">The Danger of Opening the Ports to Foreign Corn at a Fixed Duty Considered</span> (1834). He died at Bath on 1 April 1843, and was buried at Nacton.<br>
