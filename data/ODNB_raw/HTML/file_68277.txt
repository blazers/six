<span class="headword">Heton,  George</span>  (<em>b. </em><em>c.</em>1515, <em>d.</em> in or after 1598), <span class="occ">merchant and religious activist</span>, was described in the memorial inscription of his son <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13138/', "Martin Heton")</script>, bishop of Ely, as <i>armiger</i> (esquire), and as descended from the family of Heton of Lancashire. If so he was evidently a younger son. However, an alternative parentage may be suggested by the will of one William Heton, merchant tailor of London. Dated 28 October and proved on 22 December 1523, Heton's will refers to &#145;George, Anne, and Thomas, mine own natural children&#146;, all of whom were then underage. As George later did, William Heton also owned property at Stratford Bow, Middlesex. Apprenticed to and made free of the Merchant Taylors' Company by the end of 1538, he settled in the London parish of St Dionis Backchurch, where on 20 January 1539 he married Elizabeth Paget. Only one child of the marriage is recorded in the register&#151;Ann, baptized on 24 April 1540&#151;and Elizabeth was buried on 12 September 1546.<br>
<br>Heton appears to have prospered early. In the London subsidy assessment of 1541 he was rated on the basis of an income of &pound;60, and was thus reckoned one of the half-dozen wealthiest parishioners of St Dionis. His suitability as a son-in-law was not lost on London's merchant &eacute;lite and on 24 January 1547 he married Joan Roocke, widowed daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/3055/', "Sir Martin Bowes")</script>, lord mayor of London in 1545. Five children quickly followed&#151;William (1547), Elizabeth (1548), Grace (1550), Thomas (1551), and finally Martin (1554), the future bishop. Joan Heton was buried ten days after Martin's baptism.<br>
<br>In 1551 Heton bought a substantial estate in Bromley St Leonard and Stratford Bow, Middlesex, from another former lord mayor, Sir Henry Hoblethorne. Like his father-in-law, he was by this time deeply committed to protestantism. He and his brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13139/', "Thomas Heton")</script> were among the principal &#145;sustainers&#146; of London protestants under Mary. Two letters from the martyr John Bradford to George, his &#145;dear friend and brother in the lord&#146;, were afterwards published  (Bickersteth, 342&#150;6).<br>
<br>Heton contrived to combine this clandestine activity with the mastership of the Merchant Taylors in 1556&#150;7. Henry Machyn describes the company feast which ended Heton's mastership on 30 June 1557. Continuing to prosper under Elizabeth, Heton was rated in the higher assessment of London of 1559 on the basis of a taxable sum of &pound;80 and was thus reckoned among its 700 wealthiest citizens. Yet he had evidently overstrained his resources in the protestant cause. He sold his Middlesex estate to Nicholas Culverwell in 1561 and disaster struck soon afterwards. On 17 May 1563 he made &#145;humble request&#146; to his company for an annuity for his relief and that of his &#145;poor children, being in great need and necessity &hellip; by reason of the great losses that he hath of late &hellip; had and sustained as well by sea as by land&#146;  (Clode, 1.192). He was granted an annual pension of 20 marks.<br>
<br>This reversal, coupled with his godly reputation, perhaps prompted the corporation to offer Heton the post of chamberlain of London, the city's principal financial officer, which he took up on 1 August 1563. In August 1565 he witnessed his father-in-law's will, which released him from a debt of &pound;300, and in 1569 he was granted the gaugership of wine and oils for thirty years at &pound;40 per annum.<br>
<br>In 1572 Heton relinquished his pension from the Merchant Taylors on the grounds that &#145;God hath otherwise well provided for him&#146;  (Clode, 1.192). It was, however, restored between April 1576 and June 1577, for disaster had struck again. On 13 December 1577 Heton was dismissed from the chamberlainship for undisclosed reasons. It may be significant that Elizabeth had recently complained that loan money dispatched for repayment to certain city officials had failed to reach them. Heton was, moreover, once again heavily in debt to private creditors and to the city itself, owing the latter no less than &pound;1463. Attempts to settle the debt and audit his accounts dragged on through numerous committees until, on 26 April 1598, a final one was appointed to examine and close them.<br>
<br>Since no more is heard of the matter, nor of Heton himself, this may be evidence that he had recently died. Unless the description of him on Bishop Heton's tomb was merely an attempt to obliterate the memory of his financial disasters, it perhaps suggests that he had in the interim retired to a small estate in decent obscurity among his Lancashire relatives. Heton's second son, Thomas (<i>d</i>. 1606), MP for Southampton in 1593, was in 1600 appointed bailiff of the Isle of Ely by his brother Martin.<br>
