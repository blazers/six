<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Baker,  David</span> <span class="st"> [<em>name in religion </em>Augustine]</span>  (1575&#150;1641), <span class="occ">Benedictine monk and mystical writer</span>, was born in Abergavenny, Monmouthshire, on 9 December 1575, the thirteenth and youngest child of William Baker (<i>d</i>. 1606), receiver-general of the barony of Abergavenny and recorder of the borough&#151;two positions which at this time were virtually hereditary in the Baker family&#151;and his wife, Maud Lewis, daughter of the vicar of Abergavenny and sister to David Lewis, judge of the admiralty and first principal of Jesus College, Oxford. The Bakers, on their part, claimed direct descent from Owain Glyn D&#373;r and were distant cousins of the earl of Salisbury through the Welsh origins of the Cecil family. Although Monmouthshire was second only to Lancashire as a hotbed of recusancy, the Bakers conformed to the established church while retaining a benevolent attitude towards Catholicism. After some years at the local grammar school David Baker was sent in February 1587 to Christ's Hospital, London, partly in order that this Welsh-speaking boy should acquire fluency in English. On 20 May 1590 he matriculated as a commoner at Broadgates Hall, Oxford, where, although he was under the tutelage of a relative, William Prichard, student of Christ Church, he fell into dissolute company; his father summoned him home in May 1592 without his taking a degree. Two plans of his father for settling his feckless son&#151;one an advantageous marriage, the other a local church benefice&#151;came to naught, and he was put to studying law under his brother's guidance until, in November 1596, he was ready to go to London again to become a member first, very briefly, of Clifford's Inn, then of the Inner Temple. Law proved to be a world which captured his enthusiasm: even if he went to the theatre he took a law manual with him in case there were any <i>longueurs</i> in the performance. He retained a lifelong affection for the gardens of the inns of court, and several leading lawyers later testified that he could have reached the summit of their profession. But on 7 October 1598 his brother died and his father recalled him to Abergavenny, procuring for him the recordership, but also counting on his help with the many far-flung courts he was obliged to hold as steward of the barony.<br>
<br>It was in the course of this business that Baker found his road to Damascus. In 1600, riding home at nightfall, he had what he was convinced was a miraculous escape from drowning while negotiating a narrow bridge across the torrential River Monnow. Previously totally without any faith he now began to reflect upon his religious position and, as always, worked it out by reading many books. He was reconciled to the Roman Catholic church by Father Richard Floyd in May 1603. In January 1605 he took the familiar road to London to seek out some Englishmen who, he heard, were Benedictines, belonging to the Italian reformed congregation of St Justina in Padua, where he entered the noviciate on 27 May, taking the name of Augustine. The superiors treated him with great kindness, even providing him with twenty wines to sample and choose which suited him best, but his health broke down and, though remaining a monk, he returned to England in June 1606 just in time to attend to his dying father, who now also embraced the Catholic religion.<br>
<br>In 1607 in England Baker was professed as a Benedictine, at first belonging to his Italian congregation. But on 21 November its two leading English members, Vincent Sadler and Edward Maihew, having made contact with the blind and long imprisoned nonagenarian Father Sigebert Buckley, who had been a monk of the Marian refoundation at Westminster Abbey and was the last surviving representative in good standing of the pre-Reformation English Benedictine congregation, were aggregated to that congregation by him, as was also Baker shortly afterwards. This whole episode is rather obscure and scholars dispute whether it was masterminded by Baker whose legal instincts had led him to see the advantages that would accrue to the new wave of Benedictine monks arising in the early seventeenth century if they could claim membership of the same historic corporation as had existed in England since its conversion, as well as the legal right to its properties and privileges in the event of a Catholic restoration. This was a live issue at this time of high hopes for England's conversion under the Stuarts, when Robert Persons was asserting the claims of the Jesuits, as the religious order most attuned to the needs of the times, to some share of the former monastic patrimony. It seems unlikely that Baker himself took the initiative in devising this adroit manoeuvre&#151;he was hardly in a position to do so&#151;but he undoubtedly placed his legal expertise at its service. Here is shown the high value he always set on continuity, though he may have been unconsciously straining the evidence in assuming that the former English Benedictine congregation was a legal corporation and a tightly knit entity like the more centralized congregations of his own age.<br>
<br>In 1608, after some time as a poor man's lawyer, Baker embarked on a life of retirement and prayer at Sir Nicholas Fortescue's house at Cook Hill in Worcestershire. Here he claims to have been granted for a short time the grace of passive contemplation. He also read widely in the mystical writers of Spain, the Rhineland, and fourteenth-century England. In 1610 he was in London again, where he gave legal tuition to Philip Powell, the future Benedictine martyr, also from Abergavenny, and subsequently financed his education at Louvain. In 1613 Baker was ordained priest at Rheims, not out of any missionary or pastoral zeal, but, as he says, to confirm him in his prayerful ways. He does not appear to have received any formal theological training. On 23 August 1619 the three independent groupings of Benedictine Englishmen&#151;those attached to Italian monasteries, those who had joined monasteries in Spain, and those like Baker who belonged to the revived English congregation&#151;after many false starts and protracted negotiations, were united into a single body by a papal brief, <span class="italic">Ex incumbenti</span>, of Paul V. Baker was the first of the monks to accept this union and now affiliated himself to one of its monasteries, the priory of St Lawrence at Dieulouard in Lorraine (later at Ampleforth), though there is no evidence that he ever resided there.<br>
<br>There remained, however, a coterie of English monks who did not accept this union. One of them, the eccentric John Barnes, attacked the validity of its historical claims in his <span class="italic">Examen trophaeorum congregationis praetensae Anglicanae ordinis sancti Benedicti</span> (Rheims, 1622), in which he contended that the only fully formed congregation existing in England before the Reformation was that of Cluny. Baker was commissioned by the president of his congregation, Rudesind Barlow, to collect materials for a refutation of Barnes and embarked on a <i>voyage litt&eacute;raire</i> of the principal English libraries, particularly that of Sir Robert Cotton, and consulted all the leading antiquaries: Camden, Selden, Spelman, and Bishop Godwin, being readily accepted as one of their circle. These researches, now embodied in four folio volumes in Jesus College, Oxford, provided the historical basis for Clement Reyner's <span class="italic">Apostolatus Benedictinorum in Anglia</span> (Douai, 1626). An ecclesiastical history of England was also projected, but never realized.<br>
<br>In 1624 the negotiations for the royal Spanish marriage broke down, and fearing renewed persecution of Catholics Baker returned to the continent where he was asked to undertake the spiritual formation of a group of young Englishwomen who had just begun a Benedictine nunnery at Cambrai, the ancestor of the modern Stanbrook in Worcestershire. They included four descendants of Sir Thomas More, one of whom, Gertrude More, was to be Baker's most receptive disciple. He took infinite pains over instructing these nuns in the life of prayer, especially as this had to be done more from books than from contact with a living tradition. He translated and copied out for their use whole treatises by the contemplative masters which he borrowed either from Sir Robert Cotton or from the exiled English Carthusians and Bridgettines. Thus he rescued from oblivion the medieval English spiritual tradition represented by Walter Hilton, Richard Rolle, Julian of Norwich, and the <span class="italic">Cloud of Unknowing</span>, another instance of his zeal for continuity. He also composed many treatises of his own, forty of which would be drawn upon by Serenus Cressy to compile a systematic digest of his teaching, the <span class="italic">Sancta sophia</span>, in 1657. The distinctive notes of his doctrine were interior freedom and responsiveness to the promptings of the spirit. He discouraged dependence on spiritual directors and stood loosely to external observances. This ran counter to prevalent axioms of spiritual practice and aroused suspicions of illuminism in Father Francis Hull who had come to be chaplain to the nuns in 1629. The controversy was brought before the general chapter of the English congregation on 1 August 1633. The commission there appointed to examine Baker's manuscripts gave unstinted approval to his teaching, but for the sake of harmony removed both protagonists from their posts at Cambrai. Baker thereupon took up residence at St Gregory's Priory, Douai (later Downside), where the prior was Rudesind Barlow.<br>
<br>Here events repeated themselves. For a man much given to solitariness, who kept to his room and would not join the community even for the choir offices, Baker nevertheless had a talent for attracting a following, not only among the younger monks, but also from many in the seminaries and religious orders of the town. At this time when the English Benedictines were only beginning to find their bearings there were tensions between those who saw the <i>raison d'&ecirc;tre</i> of their life as the mission to England, and those, led by Rudesind Barlow, who gave priority to the establishment of a full monastic observance. Baker had written a treatise on the English mission whose first draft suggested that he was inclined to support the conventual party. But he was annoyed when these began to make partisan use of his writings because he felt that their rigid attachment to external forms was as harmful to spiritual progress as total absorption in the apostolate. He therefore composed a second edition of his treatise in which he held up as a cautionary tale a description of an activist conventual easily recognizable as a portrait of Rudesind Barlow. At first Barlow took the rebuke very edifyingly, thinking it was a private admonition, but he was outraged when he discovered it was being publicly circulated. This was a grave lapse of judgement on Baker's part and revealed a man who, although his writings show him to have a very fine intuition into human psychology, had little sense of what made for community living, especially in a house where he was a guest.<br>
<br>In 1638 the president was induced to order Baker, aged and infirm as he was, to leave Douai for the English mission. He gently submitted to this harsh decision in spite of the outcry by his followers, and passed the last three years of his life near the inns of court, saved from pursuivants only by the rumour that the plague infested his lodgings. He had to change his lodgings four times and died of a fever on 9 August 1641, while being cared for by Mrs Watson, mother of one of the Cambrai nuns. He was buried in St Andrew's churchyard, Holborn. His teaching on prayer, although written in a crabbed and parenthetical style often attributed to his legal background, has remained a central element in the English Benedictine spiritual patrimony, but it has also attained a far wider audience including the Cambridge Platonists, the Quakers, the nonjurors, German pietists, and the Scottish mystics. So experienced an authority as Evelyn Underhill has rated him &#145;one of the most lucid and orderly of guides to the contemplative life&#146;  (E. Underhill, <span class="italic">Mysticism</span>, 13th edn, 1960, 559).<br>
