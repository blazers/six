<span class="headword">Umfraville, Sir  Ingram  de</span>  (<em>d.</em> in or after 1321), <span class="occ">baron</span>, was certainly a descendant of the Umfraville family of Prudhoe, Northumberland, though his exact parentage is obscure. He was perhaps born about 1260, since in 1279 he or a namesake sought from Edward I the lands of his late father Robert, perhaps the younger brother of Gilbert de Umfraville, earl of Angus (<i>d</i>. 1245). However, Robert was born before 1212 and died before 1257, dates which make him a somewhat unlikely father to Ingram and his younger brothers. Although he was said to have been married to a daughter of Ingram de Balliol of Urr (in Kirkcudbrightshire) and Redcastle (in Angus), Ingram de Umfraville was given a Balliol forename, and his mother or grandmother must have been Ingram de Balliol's sister or daughter; he himself assumed the Balliol of Redcastle arms.<br>
<br>Knighted and in receipt of an annual fee of 20 merks from Alexander III, Umfraville was not among the barons who acknowledged Margaret, the Maid of Norway, as heir presumptive to that king in 1284, and, apart from his fee, is not mentioned during the period of guardianship (1286&#150;91). He accepted Edward I's overlordship at Norham on 13 June 1291, and was named an auditor in the Great Cause by Balliol; he was present at King John's homage to Edward at Newcastle on 26 December 1292, when he was named eighth of sixteen barons, and witnessed a charter of John at Dundee, 23 February 1293. But he was not among the eighteen Scottish magnates summoned to serve Edward in Gascony in June 1294, and in July 1295, when a parliament at Stirling deprived King John of power, Umfraville was probably not one of the council of twelve then appointed, for he was one of four commissioners sent to France to conclude an alliance with Philippe IV. Probably he was still in France during Edward I's invasion and the Scots' defeat at Dunbar in 1296, but he had returned by 28 June, when he surrendered Dumbarton Castle; his homage to Edward at the end of August calls him &#145;of the county of Ayr&#146; and the order to restore his lands was sent to the sheriffs of Berwick and Ayr. It is not clear how he acquired these lands, some apparently in Carrick.<br>
<br>Umfraville was one of sixteen Scottish nobles ordered by the English to support the guardian, Brian Fitzalan on 26 September 1297, in response to the Scottish victory at Stirling Bridge (11 September); he had not supported Robert Bruce's rising (June 1297), nor that of Wallace, but he must have deserted the English and was probably active against them in 1298. In February 1299, on the recent death of Ingram de Balliol, Edward I gave all his lands to one coheir, Henry Percy, because the other, Ingram de Umfraville, was the king's enemy and rebel. In August of that year, when the Scots invaded Ettrick Forest, Umfraville was named first as their leader, in a host which included several earls and the two guardians, Robert Bruce, earl of Carrick (the future Robert I), and John Comyn the younger. As a result of the guardians' bitter quarrel, the Scots named William Lamberton, bishop of St Andrews, as principal guardian and Umfraville as sheriff of Roxburgh (a castle in English hands) with 100 horse and 1500 foot (a large force for the Scots) to attack the border.<br>
<br>The following May, 1300, another quarrel, between the bishop and Comyn, led to Umfraville being chosen to replace Carrick as guardian; if this act was not as inconsequential as it seems at first sight, Umfraville must have been seen as a peace-keeper with influence over the volatile Comyn. In the first half of 1301 a truce allowed the Scots to contact King John, who appointed John Soulis as guardian; in September Umfraville and Soulis led a large force in attacking Lochmaben, unsuccessfully. In 1302 a delegation of six, including Umfraville, went to Paris in a desperate but unsuccessful search for continued French support. The war was renewed and in 1303 Edward I reconquered southern Scotland. When the Scottish leaders submitted in February 1304, Umfraville was still in France, and in July Edward I would offer no safe conduct to him, Soulis, or James Stewart until Wallace was handed over to him. Umfraville returned, perhaps after Wallace's taking (3 August 1305); his lands were restored in October 1305 for a fine of his rents for five years&#151;the longest period imposed on any of the Scottish leaders&#151;and in March 1306 he was in Liddesdale, as one of Edward I's captains. He had been driven from his patriotic role by the murder of John Comyn at the hands of Carrick's followers.<br>
<br>In the years that followed Umfraville played a minor role as an English commander in south-west Scotland; in August 1308 he was made guardian of Galloway and was keeper of Caerlaverock Castle; he and it disappear in 1310&#150;11, when he may have been taken prisoner. With other Scots he attended Edward II's parliament, probably in August 1312, to advise on Scottish affairs. On 24 June 1314 he was taken prisoner at Bannockburn and despite leave a month later to his brother William and others to seek money for his ransom in France, he remained in Scotland for six years. At some point before 1320, Robert I had Ingram de Balliol's barony of Redcastle partitioned to give Umfraville his moiety (Robert kept Percy's half); it is clearly implied that Umfraville had made terms, and this is confirmed by finding his name fifteenth in the long list of nobles who petitioned Pope John XXII on 6 April 1320, a document sponsored by the government (the declaration of Arbroath).<br>
<br>Not long after, in August 1320, a major conspiracy against Robert I was revealed, and among those tried and executed was Sir David Brechin, who had not been party to it, but had had guilty knowledge of it. Moved by his execution, states Barbour in <span class="italic">The Bruce</span>, Umfraville sought Robert's leave to return to England, which was chivalrously granted. The role of Umfraville in that poem is indeed remarkable. He is said to have gone to Perth with Valence in 1306 and instructed the latter in a successful ruse to catch the Scots unawares; he sent Carrick men to kill Bruce by subterfuge; as commander in Galloway he had a red bonnet on a spear carried before him as token that he was the most chivalrous knight; he advised Edward II on the morn of Bannockburn to play the &#145;feigned withdrawal&#146; strategy, but was rebuffed by an over-confident king; on his departure from Scotland he advised Edward to make a long truce so that the Scots would lose their military skills, advice which in 1323 Edward took, though to no profit. Barbour had some written source, perhaps a treatise on chivalry, which portrayed Umfraville as a wily but chivalrous tactician. Barbour's story of his departure from Scotland fits with his recorded arrival at Edward II's court in December 1320, when he disingenuously claimed that he had never made peace with Robert I. Edward gave him generous gifts and, in February 1321, leave to depart to France&#151;the last that is heard of Ingram de Umfraville. His career epitomizes the conflicting claims to loyalty which beset a minor Scottish baron in 1290&#150;1314; Edward I could not win him for the English, but Robert I did.<br>
<br>In 1346 a namesake, described as &#145;Scot&#146;, fought on the English side at Nevilles Cross, and for thirty years served Edward III on the border; he was perhaps a great-nephew of the earlier Ingram. The name of the latter's wife is not known; in 1296 he had two daughters, Eve and Isabel, but since no son is recorded, he probably had none.<br>
