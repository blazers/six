<span class="headword">Harris,  Richard</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1734), <span class="occ">slave trader and lobbyist</span>, is of obscure ancestry. He was in St Kitts in the West Indies in 1694, where he observed that French privateers, by intercepting provisions from British North America, caused Barbados planters &#145;to suffer much &amp; their Negroes perish for want&#146;  (TNA: PRO, CO 137/8, 40). After establishing himself as a merchant in London he began sending cargoes to Africa, and from 1702 to 1712 he dispatched the second highest valuation among London merchants. From 1718 to 1734 eleven vessels owned by him transported slaves to Jamaica, Barbados, Virginia, and Buenos Aires, in the notorious &#145;triangular trade&#146;.<br>
<br>Harris early developed an interest in the Jamaica trade (importing slaves and exporting sugar). In 1709, concerned about wartime security, he advised the Board of Trade: &#145;What seems absolutely necessary, especially for Jamaica, is to remove the French from among our settlements in America&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP col.</span>, 24.319). As the Royal African Company undertook its long quest to recover its monopoly over trading in Africa, lost in 1698, Harris united with London merchants in opposition. They proposed that the trade be vested in a regulated company. Parliament refused to renew the African Company monopoly, but failed to establish a regulated company until 1750.<br>
<br>By 1708 Harris stood to the fore among London slave merchants; the Board of Trade that year wrote to Harris enclosing queries to be communicated to the separate traders to Africa. Jamaica legislators and merchants employed Harris's services in petitioning for an open trade to Africa, asserting that &#145;Jamaica hath been better supplied with negroes by the seperate traders to Affrica than at any time by the Affrican Company&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP col.</span>, 25.336). In a quest for information the Board of Trade in 1731 wrote to &#145;Mr. Harris, one of the principal Separate Traders to Africa&#146;, requesting him to &#145;communicate to some others of the Principal Separate Traders, and let their Lord's have your and their answers&#146;  (TNA: PRO, CO 389/28, 447). Marketing slaves in American colonies encountered obstacles in the shape of colonial duty laws. Recognizing that the laws interfered with the slave trade, the crown in 1717 prohibited the passage of laws imposing a duty on importation of Africans. Jamaica and Virginia, where Harris held an economic interest in the trade, were major offenders. Harris persistently protested against the existing laws, only to find that the colonial legislatures no less persistently maintained them.<br>
<br>Harris won greater success in other measures. London merchants faced impediments to the recovery of colonists' debts. Colonial laws exempted houses and lands from liability for debts. Although Harris and others reminded the Board of Trade that such exemption defied English law and royal instructions, the board, noting the laws were of long standing, recommended that the privy council not interfere. The merchants then turned to parliament and pushed through the <span class="roman">Credit Act</span> of 1732, a triumph described as &#145;the Palladium of Colony credit, and the English Merchant's grand security&#146;  (Sheridan, 288&#150;9). The act made lands, tenements, and slaves owned by colonial debtors liable to be seized for repayment of debts. The following year the passage of the <span class="roman">Molasses Act</span> had Harris's support. He had earlier advised the Board of Trade that, &#145;if the French sugar colonies were not supplied with provisions and lumber from our northern colonies, it would not be possible for them to carry on their sugar trade in the manner they do&#146;  (<span class="italic">Journal of the Commissioners</span>, 1728&#150;34, 253).<br>
<br>To the end of his life Harris pursued his long career as a slave trader. In 1733 the Board of Trade appealed to &#145;Mr. Harris, one of the most ancient traders to the West Indies&#146;, for information  (<span class="italic">CSP col.</span>, 40.52). Six weeks after his death his ship <i>Antelope</i> imported 286 Africans from Angola into Virginia. On 14 September 1734 <span class="italic">Read's Weekly Journal</span> recorded: &#145;Last Tuesday Night [10 September] died at his House on Tower-Hill, Mr. Richard Harris, who for many Years was an eminent Trader to the Coast of Africa, and the West Indies&#146;.<br>
<br>For three decades Harris, without any official capacity, probably wielded more influence in shaping slave-trade policy than any other Briton. He enjoyed the esteem of London merchants and the Board of Trade, and testified frequently on the policy. He had the satisfaction of seeing free trade in slaves won, colonial exclusionary laws opposed, and two significant parliamentary measures&#151;the <span class="roman">Credit Act</span> and the <span class="roman">Molasses Act</span>&#151;made law. He also foretold the imperial policy of evicting France from North America.<br>
