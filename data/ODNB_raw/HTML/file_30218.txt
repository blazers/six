<span class="headword">Yeo,  Richard</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1779), <span class="occ">coin- and medal-engraver</span>, produced silver season tickets for entry to Vauxhall Pleasure Gardens. These tickets were sold from 1737 and carried images symbolizing the arts and pleasures to be enjoyed in the gardens. Yeo's signature appears on tickets showing the muses Euterpe and Thalia. Forrer suggests that two other tickets showing the muses Calliope and Erato are by him, as is a ticket showing the sculpture of Hogarth by Roubiliac, which was erected in Vauxhall Gardens in 1738. The tickets were in an ornate rococo style with loops to enable them to be worn; the wearer's name and season number was engraved on the back.<br>
<br>One of the most important pieces produced by Yeo was the official Culloden medal celebrating the duke of Cumberland's victory at the battle of Culloden in 1746. The medal had an ornamental scroll border in a gently decorated style and incorporated a loop, again to enable it to be worn. Later, another Culloden medal was produced by Yeo for a collector's market. It showed the duke of Cumberland, apparently rendered from life, on the obverse, and on the reverse it carried an image of Rebellion being defied by Hercules, while Britannia stands adjusting her garments. The medal was available in gold, silver, and copper by subscription and was advertised in the <span class="italic">London Gazette</span>. In 1745 Yeo had premises in the Strand and lived in lodgings at a Mrs Sutcliff's, a druggist near Craven Street; a year later he is recorded as living in Tavistock Street, Covent Garden.<br>
<br>Yeo was, from 1749, employed as second engraver at the Royal Mint. In 1768 he called attention to his own great input into the production of the dies and punches for the new coinage under George III, when the chief engraver, John Sigismund Tanner, had been unable to produce very much work owing to the deterioration in his eyesight. Yeo's work was officially acknowledged and recognized by Lord Viscount Chetwynd, the mint-master, who proposed to the Treasury to make Yeo chief engraver on Tanner's death. Yeo became chief engraver of the mint in 1779.<br>
<br>Yeo's name appears on the establishment papers for the Society of Artists in November 1759, and he exhibited there between 1760 and 1768. He was a director of the Incorporated Society of Artists from 1765 to 1768 and was a founder member of the Royal Academy when it was established in 1768 [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/94593', "Founders of the Royal Academy of Arts")</script>]. He showed at the academy's first two exhibitions in 1769 and 1770, when his contributions to the displays included impressions on sealing wax of engraved gems (1769) and a gold proof from a die of a 5-guinea piece (1770). In 1769 the <span class="italic">Middlesex Journal, or, Chronicle of Liberty</span> accused the founder members of the Royal Academy, Yeo among them, of being self-seeking cheats who benefited from the royal prerogative for personal reasons rather than being admirable leaders in the arts.<br>
<br>Yeo's contribution to British coinage includes a series of pattern 5 and 2 guineas between 1768 and 1777 that were never minted for circulation. He produced pattern guineas, half-guineas, and shilling pieces, among them the Northumberland shilling issued to be distributed among the population of Dublin in 1763 when Hugh, earl of Northumberland, became lord lieutenant of Ireland. Only &pound;100 worth of these were issued, according to Grueber. Some of the patterns are kept in the British Museum. Yeo continued to engrave medals and gems, and his 1750 medal for the Academy of Ancient Music, the 1752 Chancellor medal, and the Winchester College prize medals are in the British Museum. He probably produced other society medals, and tickets unsigned by him may still await attribution. He signed his work R. YEO; YEO:F; YEO:FECIT, or R. YEO.F. Of his gems can be mentioned <span class="italic">Ixion Embracing a Cloud</span>, a portrait bust of Cromwell in amethyst, and a bust of Shakespeare in cornelian.<br>
<br>After Yeo's death in London, on 3 December 1779, his tools and a small collection of medals were sold at auction. His personal belongings were distributed among his closest friends, servants, and relatives.<br>
