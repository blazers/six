<span class="headword">Ogborne,  John</span>  (1755&#150;1837), <span class="occ">engraver</span>, was born on 22 July 1755, and baptized at Chelmsford, Essex, on 6 August, the fourth of seven children but the only surviving son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20576/', "David Ogborne (d. 1800/01)")</script>, an artist, and his first wife, Ruth Howe. He was apprenticed to William Wynne Ryland and was later one of the stipple engravers who worked for him. He may himself have taught his sister Mary Ogborne (<i>b</i>. 1764), who was an equally capable stipple-engraver and produced plates after William Redmore Bigg and William Hamilton for John Raphael Smith and John Thane.<br>
<br>One of John Ogborne's earliest employers was John Thane, for whom he engraved a number of stipples during the 1780s as well as contributing portraits to his <span class="italic">British autography: a collection of facsimilies of the handwriting of royal and illustrious personages, with their authentic portraits</span> (1788&#150;93). After Thane's death in 1818 Ogborne engraved a portrait of him by Bigg (1819) which was added to later editions of <span class="italic">British Autography</span>. He did similar work for other printsellers, such as Thomas Macklin and James Birchall. Ogborne also worked for Messrs Boydell, engraving a fine plate of <span class="italic">Mrs Jordan in the Character of the Country Girl</span> (1788) after Romney, three plates after Richard Westall, and four large plates for the <span class="italic">Shakspeare Gallery</span>. Two of his prints reproduced paintings by Josiah Boydell (1794, 1795) and proved, through no fault of Ogborne's, to be two of the worst in the series. The other two, after Robert Smirke (1791, 1801), were much better.<br>
<br>Ogborne's marriage to Elizabeth Jackson (1763/4&#150;1853) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20577/', "Ogborne, Elizabeth")</script>] probably took place on 20 March 1790 at St Pancras Church. They resided at her house, 58 Great Portland Street, Westminster, from where Osborne published a few of his own prints, including <span class="italic">Rural Misfortune</span> (1793), after Bigg.<br>
<br>Their son, John Fauntleroy Ogborne (1793&#150;1813), was a student at Middlesex Hospital and had already qualified in surgery and dressing in 1813 when he died in May from blood poisoning contracted during a dissection. After his death Elizabeth began work on her history of Essex, to which Ogborne contributed drawings and engravings.<br>
<br>In 1828 Ogborne exhibited a picture at the British Institution and in 1837 another at the British Artists in Suffolk Street, but he died in November that year, a pensioner of the National Benevolent Institution, and was buried at Tottenham Court Road burial-ground on 13 November. <br>
