<span class="headword">Tinniswood,  Peter</span>  (1936&#150;2003), <span class="occ">writer</span>, was born on 21 December 1936 at 5 Granard Road, Wavertree, Liverpool, the son of Thomas Henry Bismarck Tinniswood (1892&#150;1978), newspaper compositor, and his wife, May, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Broley (1910&#150;1995). When Tinniswood senior was offered a job on the <span class="italic">Manchester Guardian</span> they moved to Manchester, where his wife opened a small dry-cleaning business. Tinniswood was educated at Sale grammar school and Manchester University, though he liked to claim that listening to the customers in his mother's shop did more to arm him for a career as a humorist. Certainly it endowed him with an instinct for the lugubrious cadences of northern speech which would be such a feature of his work. Meanwhile, after a spell of teaching and a sojourn in Vienna as an insurance salesman, he made a start in journalism on the <span class="italic">Sheffield Star</span> in 1958. A fellow reporter was David Nobbs. They became friends for life and occasional collaborators, beginning with jokes and sketches for comedians of the day. By 1963 they formed one of the script partnerships (others included Dennis Potter and David Nathan, and Keith Waterhouse and Willis Hall) eager to shock the bourgeoisie glaring at BBC Television's satirical <span class="italic">That Was The Week That Was</span>. They went on to write the radio comedy series, <span class="italic">Hardluck Hall</span> (1964), and material for David Frost's <span class="italic">The Frost Report</span>, and for comedians including Dick Emery and Roy Hudd.<br>
<br>It was not until 1967, when he was working on the <span class="italic">Western Mail</span> in Cardiff, a long way from his roots, that Tinniswood applied himself seriously to his first novel and the fount of much of his later output. On 22 October the previous year he had married Patricia Mary Theresa Mallen, a 23-year-old draughtswoman, and daughter of Sean Mallen, customs officer. With their first child on the way and the rent of their flat to find, it was a bold decision to take six months off from the newspaper in order to concentrate on his book, but one that was eventually justified. First published in 1968, <span class="italic">A Touch of Daniel</span> was selected by the Book Society and taken up by the Americans, while the Boulting brothers acquired the film rights. It featured the extended Brandon family, led by the gloomy Uncle Mort, dependent on the tireless errand-running of Carter Brandon, and collectively given to a northern idiom at once down-to-earth and aloft with fancy. As David Nobbs later remarked, no one else could have written such lines as &#145;It's a bit of a devil when your fianc&eacute;e is the last one to hear about you having a baby owl&#146;, or &#145;I don't suppose wiping your nose was one of those things they taught them in the merchant navy&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Guardian</span>). Two further chronicles of the Brandon family followed, and although the Boultings' film option was never taken up the saga formed the basis of the long-running television comedy <span class="italic">I Didn't Know You Cared</span> (BBC, 1975&#150;9). Tinniswood's first solo television series had been <span class="italic">Never Say Die</span> (1970), a hospital comedy set in Yorkshire.<br>
<br>His other great creation was the cricket-loving brigadier first encountered in <span class="italic">Tales from a Long Room</span> on BBC2 in 1980, and subsequently in full bloom in a thirteen-part series for Channel 4 in 1985. Owing much to the author's own passion for sport, these were in effect monologues delivered by Robin Bailey, who had memorably played Uncle Mort, and instead of northern pessimism was now dispensing languid reminiscence, with ever wilder flights of fancy. The brigadier was the central character in a series of half a dozen novels written by Tinniswood between 1981 and 1987, from <span class="italic">Tales from a Long Room</span> (1981) to <span class="italic">Tales from Witney Scrotum</span> (1987).<br>
<br>Tinniswood went on to complete a total of seventeen novels, innumerable television scripts, and in his later years much work for radio, which he loved. In the theatre, he never quite overcame a dismissive review of his first play, <span class="italic">The Investiture</span>, in 1971, by the critic Harold Hobson. His rare excursions into &#145;serious&#146; drama tended likewise to be undervalued, notably <span class="italic">Stoker Leishman's Diaries</span> (1981), derived from the journal of one of the lower-deck members of Scott's ill-fated south pole expedition of 1912. But his radio play <span class="italic">Anton in Eastbourne</span>, imagining an encounter between Anton Chekhov and Katherine Mansfield, was chosen by Paul Scofield (playing Anton) to mark his eightieth birthday in 2002.<br>
<br>Tinniswood's first marriage, which produced four children, ended in divorce after twelve years. On 20 September 1980 he married Elizabeth Kathleen (Liz) Goulding, the actress who had played Carter Brandon's wife Pat in <span class="italic">I Didn't Know You Cared</span>. She was the daughter of James Callaghan, company director, and had also been married before. Goulding and Tinniswood separated in 1997. When his health deteriorated, however, she invited him to rejoin her, in Surrey, so that she could care for him. Cancer of the larynx had been diagnosed in 1995, and despite an initially successful operation returned in 1998. He had an operation which left him dependent on an artificial voice-box but which also seemed to give him a last burst of creativity, helped by BBC radio producers who sensed that he was happiest when working and continued to commission him. His final play, <span class="italic">The Last Obit</span>, also staged at the New End Theatre, Hampstead (2002), was the meditation of an elderly obituaries editor as, on her last day at the newspaper, she toils to sum up the life of a dying dame of the Order of the British Empire. She ends with the note that this subject &#145;is not survived by her obituarist&#146;. He died on 9 January 2003 in the Princess Alice Hospice, Esher, Surrey. He was cremated at Randalls Park, Leatherhead, and his ashes were scattered on common land in a place dear to both him and Liz. He was survived by her and the four children of his first marriage.<br>
