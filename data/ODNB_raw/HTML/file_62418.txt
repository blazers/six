<span class="headword">Clark,  Hugh</span>  (1745&#150;1822), <span class="occ">heraldic engraver</span>, was born on 17 March 1745 and baptized on 31 March 1745 at St Martin-in-the-Fields, Westminster, the son of Hugh Clark, cordwainer, and Grisseld Matheson. On 11 June 1760 he was apprenticed to Thomas Orpin, a goldsmith in the Strand, for a term of seven years; a premium of &pound;3, much less than for Orpin's other apprentices, was paid by the trustees of the charity school near Hungerford Market, Charing Cross. He completed his apprenticeship on 13 April 1768. Subsequently he lived for most of his life in Soho, much of it in Rupert Street and Princes Street, now the southern part of Wardour Street. Despite the migration of the aristocracy in the middle years of the eighteenth century, particularly to Mayfair, Soho continued to be fashionable, attracting many highly skilled craftsmen such as Clark.<br>
<br>In 1775 Clark and Thomas Wormull, also a heraldic engraver, jointly edited <span class="italic">A Short and Easy Introduction to Heraldry</span>. It was a small pocket-sized booklet of some fifty-five pages, consisting mainly of twelve plates and a glossary. The preface, the only text apart from the glossary, stated: &#145;The following work was first designed to instruct a few private Persons, who, by its short and easy Method, gained a knowledge of the Science&#146;. Unlike other heraldry books of the period it was not aimed at the nobility. Of Clark's 217 subscribers all but three lived in London or its environs, only three were titled, and a significant proportion lived in, or close to, Soho. This appears to be the first book on heraldry compiled specifically for middle-class readers with little or no knowledge of the subject. George Kearsley, an enterprising London bookseller, saw the potential of the book and published an enlarged edition in the following year; three further editions followed in quick succession. Much of the credit for this success must go to Kearsley, who had had similar successes with other books, particularly travel guides. In 1778 Clark and Wormull produced <span class="italic">The Arms of the Nobility of England, Scotland and Ireland</span>, which was also published by Kearsley, and in the following year their <span class="italic">Peerage of the Nobility of England, Scotland and Ireland</span> was published in Dublin. Clark, encouraged by the success of the earlier works, compiled <span class="italic">A Concise History of Knighthood</span> (2 vols., 1784). This work, not published by Kearsley, appears to have been less successful; Moule stated that &#145;The 82 plates of the Stars and Badges are not to be depended upon, particularly those of the Foreign Orders&#146;  (T. Moule, <span class="italic">Bibliotheca Heraldica Magnae Britanniae</span>, 1822, 450).<br>
<br>Clark died aged seventy-seven in Haymarket, London, in May 1822 and was buried on 26 May, probably in the burial-ground of St James, Piccadilly, on the Hampstead Road. He had been the sole author of the eighth (1812) and ninth (1818) editions of the <span class="italic">Short and Easy Introduction to Heraldry</span>, which continued to prosper during the nineteenth century; a further nine editions were published after his death. &#145;It was&#146;, wrote J. R. Planch&eacute;, Somerset herald, &#145;one of the earliest and handiest little books published on the subject in a popular form&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Recollections and Reflections of J. R. Planch&eacute;</span>, 2 vols., 1872, 2.249). However, in basing it on the work of others Clark and his successors had perpetuated incorrect information and myths. In 1866 Planch&eacute; prepared a revised, eighteenth edition, in which &#145;exploded theories [were] omitted and erroneous opinions corrected&#146;  (ibid., 2.250). This edition was reprinted seven times, the last in 1910. A facsimile of the eighteenth edition was published in 1974.<br>
