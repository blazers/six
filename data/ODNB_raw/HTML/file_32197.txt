<span class="headword">Burroughs, Sir  Frederick William  Traill-</span>  (1831&#150;1905), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was born at Fatehgarh, India, on 1 February 1831, the eldest of the seven children of Major-General Frederick William Burroughs (1806&#150;1879) of the Bengal army. His grandfather, Sir William Burroughs of Castle Bagshaw, co. Cavan, was advocate-general of Bengal under Marquess Cornwallis. His mother, Caroline (1807&#150;1863), only daughter of Captain Charles Adolphus Marie de Peyron of the Bengal light cavalry, was granddaughter of Charles Adrien de Peyron, who was killed in a duel in Paris in 1777 by the comte de la Marck.<br>
<br>Burroughs spent the first nine years of his life in India. After education at Kensington grammar school, at Blackheath proprietary school, and at Hofwyl in Switzerland, he was commissioned ensign in the 93rd highlanders on 31 March 1848. Promoted lieutenant on 23rd September 1851, he became captain on 10 November 1854 and major on 20 July 1858. On his twenty-first birthday, in 1852, Burroughs succeeded to the Scottish estates of his uncle, George William Traill (1792&#150;1847), a civil servant in Bengal who became British commissioner in Kumaon, of Viera, Orkney, and assumed the surname of Traill-Burroughs. He served with the 93rd under Sir Colin Campbell throughout the Crimean War, and was at the battle of the Alma and at Balaklava, when he commanded the left centre company of his regiment, the &#145;thin red line&#146;. Traill-Burroughs took part in the expedition to Kerch and Yenikale, the siege and fall of Sevastopol, and assaults of 18 June and 8 September. He was awarded the Mejidiye (fifth class).<br>
<br>During the Indian mutiny Traill-Burroughs was engaged again under Campbell, now Lord Clyde, in the fighting before the relief of Lucknow and in the storming of the <i>sikandarabagh</i> and of the Shah Najaf mosque (both outer defences of Lucknow). He was the first through the breach at the <i>sikandarabagh</i>, and with some dozen men overpowered the gate guard. For this action, in which he received a slight wound, he was recommended for, though not awarded, the Victoria Cross. For his conduct at the battle of Cawnpore on 6 December, and the pursuit to Serai Ghat at the action of Khudaganj, the storming of the Begfam Kuthi, and the siege and capture of Lucknow, he was mentioned in dispatches, and received a brevet majority (29 July 1858). The wounds he received during the mutiny campaign disabled him for two years, and it was not until 1860 that he rejoined his regiment. In 1862 he succeeded to the temporary command of the 93rd highlanders, which had lost two commanding officers from cholera.<br>
<br>Traill-Burroughs accompanied the Yusufzai field force, under Sir Neville Chamberlain, in the campaign against the Hindustani fanatics and other groups on the north-west frontier in December 1863, commanded the 93rd in the action at Ambela, and was mentioned in dispatches (1864).<br>
<br>Promoted lieutenant-colonel on 10 August 1864, Traill-Burroughs became full colonel on 10 August 1869. He returned to Britain with his regiment early in 1870. On 4 June 1870 he married Eliza D'Oyly (1850&#150;1908), youngest daughter of Colonel William Geddes, Bengal horse artillery, JP and deputy lieutenant of Midlothian (<i>d</i>. 1879), and Emma, daughter of Edward D'Oyly of Zion Hill, Yorkshire; they had no children. Retiring from the command of the 93rd highlanders in 1873, he was promoted major-general on 16 March 1880 and lieutenant-general (retired list) on 1 July 1881. He commanded the Orkney volunteer artillery, 1873&#150;80. In 1904 he was transferred from the colonelcy of the Royal Warwickshire regiment, which he had held since 1897, to that of the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders. He was appointed CB on 24 May 1873 and KCB in 1904.<br>
<br>Burroughs owned about 12,000 acres; his seat was on the island of Rousay, Orkney, at Trumland House, which he built in 1876. He was vice-lieutenant of Orkney and Shetland. As a result of conflicts with his crofter tenants he &#145;had the reputation of being the worst of the nineteenth century Orkney lairds&#146;  (Thomson, 1). The estates he had inherited were encumbered with debt, which was added to by borrowing to make further land purchases and by taking on the debts of his spendthrift father. The crofters were subjected to threefold rent increases, only partly attributable to investments in agricultural improvement, and these became a source of contention after 1879, when farming went into depression. Burroughs became notorious for evicting two of his tenants who, in 1883, gave evidence to the royal commission appointed by Gladstone and chaired by Francis Napier to investigate the conditions of crofters in the highlands and islands of Scotland. Burroughs himself gave evidence to the commission. An active member of the Liberty and Property Defence League, he attacked the legislation introduced by Gladstone's government in 1886 to give crofters security of tenure and to establish a permanent commission to fix fair rents, writing on the subject in the <span class="italic">National Review</span> (November 1891). A combative figure, he was at the centre of a public controversy that roused public opinion against him, though by the late 1890s he had recovered some of his influence on Orkney. He died at 61 St George's Road, London, on 9 April 1905 and was buried at Brompton cemetery.<br>
