<span class="headword">Butler,  Walter</span>  (1752&#150;1781), <span class="occ">army officer in America</span>, was born in Butlersbury (now Fonda), New York, the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/53613/', "John Butler (1728&#150;1796)")</script>, an army officer and official in the British department of Indian affairs, and his wife, Catherine Bratt. Little is known of his early life, but having been brought up in his father's well-to-do household he would have enjoyed the maximum comforts allowed by New York frontier life; he would also have been exposed to the Native Americans who populated his native Mohawk valley and dealt with his father. In the early 1770s he was sent to Albany to study law, and in 1775 he was admitted to the New York bar. However, his legal skills proved of little use in the difficult struggle that lay ahead.<br>
<br>The same year that he was admitted to the bar, Butler and his father, prominent declared loyalists, were forced to flee to Montreal. The rest of the family was rounded up and held by force in Albany. Butler, like most of the young loyalists of the New York frontier, sought to avenge his losses through service in the king's army. In autumn 1775 he was with the combined white and Native American force that captured Ethan Allen near Montreal. If British success on the middle colonies' frontier was to be lasting, however, the full co-operation of the region's Native Americans, most notably the powerful Iroquois confederacy, was essential. Unfortunately, Britain's department of Indian affairs had been thrown into disarray in the previous year with the death of its northern superintendent, Sir William Johnson, who for two decades dominated the scene and placed the affection of the Iroquois above all else. A group of his closest allies and heirs soon departed for England to secure Sir William's position and power. In their absence Butler's father, who was something of a rival to the group, was named acting superintendent. Walter, however, accompanied the party to England. The reasons for his journey are unclear, as there was no love lost between the Butlers and Johnson's heirs, particularly Joseph Brant, who was the brother of Sir William's Mohawk wife, Molly. Perhaps Butler was sent to ensure that the group did not ostracize the Butlers from any affection of the king. Nevertheless, Colonel Guy Johnson, Sir William's nephew, returned with the superintendency, and Butler returned as an ensign in the King's 8th regiment of foot.<br>
<br>Britain's strategy on the middle colonies' frontier was to conduct a series of annual raids with Native American support, which were intended to support the movement of the main armies and drain American patriot resources. This frontier saw some of the most brutal fighting of the conflict, as divided colonial and Native American communities turned on former neighbours, friends, and family members. Butler played an integral part in this. By summer 1777 he had risen to the rank of lieutenant and fought under Sir John Johnson, Sir William's son, in the assault on Fort Stanwix, located in Butler's native Mohawk valley. The siege of the fort failed, but not before the British force, dominated by loyalists from the region and Mohawk and Seneca braves (members of the Iroquois confederacy), attacked an American patriot relief column at Oriskany on 6 August. In the intense fighting that followed, the rebels lost several hundred men, many of whom were scalped, and the British lost a number of key Seneca war leaders. In the aftermath of the battle, a contingent of the British-led force broke away and avenged the loss of the Seneca by burning a village of the neutral Oneida (also a component nation of the Iroquois confederacy)&#151;an action which plunged the already fragile confederacy into civil war.<br>
<br>Butler soon returned to the Mohawk valley on a recruiting campaign, but was captured and taken to Albany. Although he was declared a spy and given a death sentence, he escaped eight months later and fled to the British stronghold at Niagara. Meanwhile his father had been assigned the charge of raising a new corps of loyalists, aptly called Butler's rangers, who were to be used as special forces units on the New York frontier. They were expected to be highly mobile guerrilla fighters who spoke Native American languages and used native methods of wilderness warfare. Such skills were essential, as these men were expected to fight side by side with Native Americans. They took the scalps of the enemy dead and wounded; tortured captives; and even used the chilling war whoop of native warriors as their battle cry. As the major commandant of this force, John Butler could choose his officers, and so his recently returned son was made a captain.<br>
<br>Butler's most remembered service in the rangers was as the leader of the expedition in November 1778 against Cherry Valley, New York. In his command were 321 natives (mostly Seneca), 150 rangers, and 50 British regulars from the 8th regiment of foot. Butler ill-advisedly insulted and mistreated Joseph Brant, who, unlike Butler, had long since earned the respect of Native American war chiefs. Moreover, many of the whites in Brant's party refused to serve under the novice commander, which left Butler at the head of a force that generally wanted confidence in his abilities and wholly lacked respect for him. Unfortunately, Cherry Valley was defended by an equally incompetent force, which had ordered inhabitants to withdraw their possessions from the local fort and had billeted its officers in comfortable houses outside the fort's protection. Butler attacked on 11 November, sending a large body composed mostly of Seneca to deal with the officers in the houses and leading his most disciplined troops to assault the fort. In the chaos that followed, the natives and whites who had little respect for Butler's authority proceeded to pillage the settlement and massacre anyone, loyalist or patriot, who resisted. Despite Butler's pleas, when the force departed the next day the settlement had been destroyed, and thirty-two loyalist and patriot civilians, mostly women and children, lay dead. Only through the intervention of Brant and a handful of other respected men was an even worse atrocity prevented.<br>
<br>Butler vehemently rejected accusations that he could have prevented events at Cherry Valley, but his superiors nevertheless never put so large a force under his command again. He continued to participate in the raids along the frontier until 30 October 1781, when, covering the retreat of the British force, he was shot and scalped at West Canada Creek by an Oneida warrior serving with the American patriots.<br>
