<span class="headword">Whincop,  Thomas</span>  (1697&#150;1730), <span class="occ">playwright and literary biographer</span>, was the only son of Dr Thomas Whincop (<i>d</i>. 1713), rector of St Mary Abchurch, and Judith Hastings (<i>fl</i>. 1694&#150;1712), of Shadwell in Middlesex. He was born in London on 2 June 1697, and baptized three days later in his father's church. Among his relatives may be numbered Dr John Whincop (<i>d</i>. 1653), rector of St Martin-in-the-Fields between 1642 and 1643, and Samuel Whincop (<i>d</i>. 1660), vicar of Cheshunt. Between 1706 and 1709 Whincop attended Merchant Taylors' School in London. He then moved to a school in Bishop's Stortford, before gaining admission to Corpus Christi, Cambridge. In 1713 Whincop's father died, leaving instructions that the family inheritance, invested &#145;upon Mortgages or upon East-India Bonds or any other new Securities&#146;, should be held in trust until his son's twenty-fourth birthday. After graduating BA in 1719, Whincop had every expectation of inheriting this estate. However, before the funds could be released, the entire fortune disappeared in the South Sea stock crash of 1720&#150;21. At an unknown date he married a woman named Martha (<i>d</i>. 1782).<br>
<br>Little is known of the final years of Whincop's life. He died at home in Totteridge, Hertfordshire, on 1 September 1730, having spent his final months as a lodger in the house of a Mr Porter. The parish register of St Andrew's Church, Totteridge, where he was buried, describes Whincop as a &#145;Poet&#146;, yet his only known drama, <span class="italic">Scanderbeg, or, Love and Liberty</span>, remained unpublished until 1747. The tragedy, which dramatizes the struggle of George Castriot to defend Albania from Turkish conquest, takes as its source the 1721 English translation of <span class="italic">Scanderbeg the Great</span> by Anne de La Roche-Guilhem. In the light of the patriot whig opposition to Walpole, Whincop's dramatic portrait of the Albanian hero whose &#145;conqu'ring sword / Oppos'd the torrent of the tyrant's power&#146;  (<span class="italic">Scanderbeg</span>, 16) may well have been intended as a propaganda piece. However, Whincop's play was never performed, John Rich telling Whincop's widow that &#145;it will by no means do for the Stage&#146;  (ibid., preface).<br>
<br>More than a decade after its rejection by Rich, Martha Whincop finally succeeded in publishing her husband's play by subscription. Appended to the printed edition of 1747 is &#145;A compleat list of all the English dramatic poets, and of all the plays ever printed in the English language&#146;, illustrated with a series of small medallion engravings by Nathaniel Parr. This &#145;List&#146;, which contains details of over 1500 plays and 350 authors, draws heavily upon Gerard Langbaine's <span class="italic">Account of the English Dramatic Poets</span> (1691), and Giles Jacob's <span class="italic">Poetical Register</span> (1720&#150;21). However, as Whincop died in 1730, the extent of his involvement in its compilation is uncertain. Internal evidence suggests that the &#145;List&#146; was revised and expanded by John Mottley, the entry on Mottley himself being full of personal anecdote.<br>
<br>Following the publication of <span class="italic">Scanderbeg</span> in 1747, Martha Whincop found work in London as a linen draper. She died on 21 March 1782 and was buried near her husband in the north-east corner of the churchyard at Totteridge.<br>
