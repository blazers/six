<span class="headword">Goddard,  Joseph</span>  (1840&#150;1900), <span class="occ">architect</span>, was born on 11 April 1840 in Leicester, the younger of the two children of Henry Goddard (1792&#150;1868) and his wife, Ann, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Gardiner (1806&#150;1885). He is the best-known figure in a dynasty of local architects spanning six generations, still in practice at the end of the twentieth century, and the longest-surviving in Britain in a father-to-son line. His grandfather Joseph (1751&#150;1839) had migrated, as a young man, some 5 miles from Kirby Muxloe to Leicester, where he prospered as a carpenter, builder, and property speculator. By 1827 he and his son Henry were styling themselves &#145;architects&#146; as well as &#145;surveyors&#146; and &#145;appraisers&#146;. The architectural side of the practice increased and, by the time the younger Joseph was established, the family's professionalization was complete.<br>
<br>Goddard was educated at Mr Packer's school in Nottingham, which specialized in technical training, before being articled to his father in 1856. He became a partner in 1862. He greatly increased the output of the practice and capitalized on the boom in church building and restoration. His most notable achievement in the 1860s was Tur Langton church, Leicestershire (1865&#150;6), which shows the strong influence of G. E. Street's important St James-the-Less, Pimlico (1859&#150;61). Much of this church work was in the prime hunting country of south Leicestershire, where he also developed a thriving practice for houses and stables.<br>
<br>On 6 October 1864 Goddard married Annie Wright (1839&#150;1933) from Pontefract, Yorkshire, whose connections provided a commission for the church and parsonage at nearby Skelbrooke (1871&#150;2). This was one of the few jobs outside Leicestershire where the volume of work available meant that, like many other provincial architects, he had little need to seek commissions elsewhere. An active social life brought him into contact with potential clients in town and country, and success in the Leicester clock tower competition (1868), followed by the impressive Gothic premises of the Leicestershire Banking Company (1872&#150;4) in Granby Street, sealed his reputation.<br>
<br>In 1871 Goddard became a fellow of the Royal Institute of British Architects, and in 1874 he took on a partner, A. H. Paget (1848&#150;1909). The practice prospered and in 1886 Goddard moved from Beausite, a spacious house he built in 1875&#150;6, to an even larger residence, Knighton Spinneys in the leafy suburb of Stoneygate, where he built numerous houses for Leicester's successful middle classes. The 1880s produced two of the practice's most striking Leicester buildings, Melbourne Hall (1880&#150;81), a large octagon based on the Union Chapel in London, and St John the Baptist (1884&#150;5), probably Goddard's best work, an ingenious reinterpretation of J. L. Pearson's great church of St Augustine, Kilburn, London.<br>
<br>In 1888 Henry Langton Goddard (1866&#150;1944), the second of Joseph's six children, became a partner and, like his father a quarter of a century before, brought new dynamism to the practice. The firm followed the trend of the time by providing well-designed buildings in a great variety of styles. Joseph's success was epitomized by his move about 1898 to the Manor House at Newton Harcourt, south of Leicester. Here he died of apoplexy on 10 October 1900, aged sixty.<br>
