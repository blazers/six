<span class="headword">Moore,  Raymond Ethelbert</span>  (1920&#150;1987), <span class="occ">photographer</span>, was born on 26 August 1920 at 43 Liscard Road, Wallasey, Cheshire, the son of Alfred Ethelbert Moore, an architect's assistant, and his wife, Winifred Ethel Agnes Mayne; he had one brother. Nothing is known of Moore's early education but in 1937, intending to become a painter, he enrolled at the Wallasey School of Art. In 1940 he joined the RAF, spending the war years in the Middle East. After winning a scholarship to study painting, he enrolled in 1947 at the Royal College of Art (RCA) in London, graduating in 1950 as an ARCA. While at the RCA Moore began to experiment more with photography, a medium familiar to him since his teenage years: examples of this early work are found in the Moore archive. Among his influences at this time were Henri Cartier-Bresson, Edward Weston, Walker Evans, Hugo Van Wadenoyen, and the two publications <span class="italic">Subjektive Fotografie</span> (1950) and <span class="italic">Subjektive Fotografie 2</span> (1956). The work in these books by international photographers emphasizes modernist trends and displays a strong graphic awareness. It tends to consider the photographic potential within the mundanities of man-made and natural phenomena, rather than the conventionally beautiful.<br>
<br>From 1950 to 1975 Moore taught lithography and painting at the Watford School of Art, while continuing his interest in photography. In 1956 the principal of the school asked him to start a photography course for graphic design students. He based the course on Ansel Adams's books, later published as <span class="italic">The Camera</span> (1980), <span class="italic">The Negative</span> (1981), and <span class="italic">The Print</span> (1983), and simultaneously gave up painting, destroying all but one of his works, <span class="italic">Skomer 1949</span>. With the painter Ray Howard-Jones, he spent nine summers on Skomer, off the Pembrokeshire coast. There, among the craggy rock formations and tactile stretches of sand, he began to develop his photographic &#145;voice&#146;. His first exhibition of seventy prints was held in 1959 in the architectural department of the Regent Street Polytechnic, but more significant was an exhibition in 1962 which he shared with painter Malcolm Hughes and sculptor Peter Startup at the Artists' International Association Gallery in Soho. At this event he met the renowned photo-historian Helmut Gernsheim, who bought some prints and became a supportive lifelong friend.<br>
<br>In 1967 Moore was invited to participate in Modfot 1 by a breakaway group from the Croydon Camera Club; other exhibitors included Don McCullin and Roger Mayne. The exhibition was opened by the Arts Council chairman, Lord Goodman, and was a valiant attempt to balance the preponderance of pictorialism then prevalent by showing radical, modern photography. In 1968 the Welsh Arts Council asked Moore to mount a retrospective exhibition of his work at its principal gallery in Museum Place, Cardiff. It was the first time a British arts council exhibited work by a living British photographer, and it marked the first time Moore's work would be seen in such an auspicious gallery. The exhibition subsequently toured Wales.<br>
<br>In 1970 Moore visited America where he met Minor White, Harry Callahan, and Aaron Siskind, three of the most influential American photographers of the time. Although the nature of their work differed greatly within the genre of the black and white fine print, they all had in common with Moore a need to express an inner, personal truth through their photography. In America Moore found stimulus and support: six exhibitions of his work were mounted there during the 1970s. Appreciation in America bolstered his reputation at home and in 1973 the Photographers' Gallery in London mounted a one-man show. In 1975 eight prints were included in &#145;The Land&#146;, selected by Bill Brandt for the Victoria and Albert Museum. Also in 1975 Moore became senior lecturer on the diploma in creative photography course at Trent Polytechnic and moved to Clipstone. However, his career here was brief: in 1977 he was awarded a bursary by the Arts Council to pursue personal work, which he did after resigning from Trent Polytechnic and moving to Carlisle in 1978.<br>
<br>In 1979 Moore took part in &#145;Three Perspectives on Photography&#146;, a controversial exhibition at the Hayward Gallery which included politically slanted work. He was invited back to the Hayward in 1981 to mount a major retrospective, becoming the second living British photographer, after Bill Brandt, to be given this honour. A book, <span class="italic">Murmurs at every Turn</span>, was published to coincide with the exhibition. A further book of Moore's photographs, <span class="italic">Every so Often</span>, was published in 1983 by BBC North East to coincide with a film portrait of that title.<br>
<br>Raymond Moore found his mature photographic voice working in the abandoned areas between town and country and deserted seaside towns out of season, where man's presence was only apparent in the traces left&#151;the marks of car tyres, litter, or a game of hopscotch abandoned in the sand. He said &#145;For me&#151;the no-man's land between the real and fantasy&#151;the mystery in the common place&#151;the uncommonness of the commonplace&#146;  (Moore, 12). Moore's work observed those forgotten, overlooked fragments of life, making the viewer aware of the extraordinary residing within the ordinary. It was founded on a strong sense of design and impeccable technique, and he cast magic on the most immemorable scene. Latterly working exclusively with a 35 mm camera in black and white, he meticulously crafted prints which annotated the tones of the grey scale with the precision of the notes in a musical score. He has been described as the first &#145;independent&#146; photographer to have made his mark in British photography during a career founded upon personal, artistic work, rather than that dependent on commissions.<br>
<br>Raymond Moore was of medium build, with piercing eyes set in a somewhat hawk-like face. He was an essentially private person whose strength of character enabled him to develop his photographic voice in a cultural environment which was not sympathetic to &#145;art&#146; photography. He was twice married: first to Pauline in the late 1960s at Hemel Hempstead and then, on 11 November 1978, to Mary Margaret Cooper (<i>b</i>. 1954/5) at Mansfield register office. Moore moved to Chapelknowe, Canonbie, Dumfriesshire, in the early 1980s, where he died on 6 October 1987. He was buried at Chapelknowe, and was survived by his second wife. Posthumously Moore was represented in two major exhibitions in London mounted to commemorate photography's 150th anniversary in 1989, &#145;The Art of Photography&#146; at the Royal Academy and &#145;Through the Looking Glass&#146; at the Barbican Centre. His work is held in several American collections, as well as major British institutions including the Victoria and Albert Museum and Welsh Arts Council.<br>
