<span class="headword">Baker,  Shirley Waldemar</span>  (1836&#150;1903), <span class="occ">missionary and prime minister of Tonga</span>, was born in Camden Town, London. He was the son of George Baker and his wife, Jane Woolmer, daughter of a Methodist minister, who married &#145;below her station&#146;. He grew up in drab circumstances and in 1852 stowed away to Australia, where he acquired a knowledge of pharmacy and some experience as a schoolteacher, and studied for the Wesleyan ministry. He married Elizabeth Powell in 1859; they had one son and four daughters. In 1860 Baker was sent as a missionary to the island of Tonga in the south Pacific where, despite his lack of formal training, he soon acquired a reputation as a skilled medical practitioner. Combined with his personal ambition and evident sympathy for indigenous interests, this soon earned him considerable influence, especially with the king, Siaosi Taufa'ahau Tupou I (known to the British as King George), whose wife he regularly attended.<br>
<br>For some time before the cession of Fiji to Britain in 1874 the Tongans, wary of colonial encroachments, had been concerned for the preservation of their own independence. To this end Baker, at the request of King George, negotiated treaties with Germany and Britain recognizing Tonga as an autonomous kingdom, and drew up a new constitution and legal code which were promulgated in 1875. The policy of remaining Tongan by appearing Western was successful, but the changes wrought by Baker and the personal power he had acquired antagonized his rivals for influence in Tonga. He was suspected of disloyalty to both Wesleyan and British interests. In 1879, therefore, the Wesleyan conference in Sydney, at the request of Sir Arthur Gordon (afterwards Lord Stanmore), British high commissioner for the Western Pacific, appointed a commission to inquire into charges made against Baker by the British vice-consul in connection with his aggressively competitive method of collecting money from the Tongans, even though it was for church purposes. Baker was recalled to Australia, but he returned independently to Tonga in 1880, whereupon the king appointed him prime minister. In 1881 he resigned from the Wesleyan ministry.<br>
<br>Under Baker's guidance the Tongan constitution was revised, giving the little kingdom of 20,000 people a cabinet, a privy council, and a parliament. Also its land laws were simplified, a state education system was introduced, and Tongan law was applied to European settlers. In 1885 the Free Wesleyan Church of Tonga was set up independently of the conference in Sydney. These changes aroused much opposition among traders, traditional Wesleyans, and various Tongan title-holders whose position as king's advisers Baker had usurped. In January 1887 their discontent, encouraged by a visiting British official, Basil Thomson, culminated in an attempt on Baker's life, in which his son and daughter were injured. Six Tongans were executed and others given lesser sentences for this assault. None the less, opposition remained strong and further disorder likely. Besides, Sir John Thurston, high commissioner for the Western Pacific, was resentful that Baker did not do more to promote British interests yet had accepted an award from the German government, so in 1890 he exiled him to New Zealand.<br>
<br>Although Baker had secured Tonga's political and ecclesiastical independence, when he returned to Tonga in 1897 his influence was at an end, King George having died in 1893. Disappointed in his hope of preferment among Free Wesleyan adherents, he introduced the Church of England to Tonga. He died at Ha'apai on 30 November 1903. Baker had many faults of character but he deserved to be more sympathetically memorialized than he came to be in the well-known writings of his opponent Basil Thomson, who ridiculed him as an uncouth upstart. He was self-seeking but he was also the king's loyal and capable servant. &#145;Tonga for the Tongans&#146; was not just his slogan; it became his enduring achievement.<br>
