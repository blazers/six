<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Peel, Sir  Robert</span>, first baronet  (1750&#150;1830), <span class="occ">calico printer and politician</span>, was born at Oswaldtwistle, Lancashire, on 25 April 1750, the third of the seven sons of Robert Peel (1723&#150;1795), a dealer (or chapman) in the linen and cotton cloth known as &#145;Blackburn Greys&#146;, and his wife, Elizabeth, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Howarth. About 1760 the father went into partnership with his brother-in-law Jonathan Howarth, and four years later they began a small calico printing factory at Brookside, Oswaldtwistle; William Yates, the publican of the Black Bull inn, was brought in to provide warehouse space and additional capital. The earliest success of the enterprise was the production of a simple parsley leaf design from which Robert Peel senior earned his trade nickname, &#145;Parsley&#146; Peel. Young Robert gained his early commercial and industrial experience in this small concern before attending Blackburn grammar school and undergoing an apprenticeship to one of the Yates family of Blackburn. He also had some brief commercial experience in London and on the continent.<br>
<br>Parsley Peel, according to his son Robert, &#145;possessed in an eminent degree a mechanical genius&#146;, and, seizing on a number of innovations in the 1760s, carried his firm into the forefront of development of the early English cotton industry. James Hargreaves, the inventor of the spinning jenny, was one of Howarth and Peel's weavers, so it was not long before Parsley Peel induced him to part with his secret. Arkwright was a close rival in the calico printing business, and his originality was vigorously contested by Peel and a group of other Lancashire manufacturers while they devoured what was most profitable in his new system of factory spinning, then quickly improved it. Robert Peel junior inherited his father's mechanical ability and enterprise, and had a similar way of assuming a leading role in successive innovations by means of acquisitions and partnerships. In particular, he was among the first group to buy an interest in Crompton's mule spinning technique (1780), and, through the Ainsworths of Haliwell, Bolton, he was in the vanguard of muslin making and chemical bleaching (1790). He was probably the first to apply steam power to mule spinning (1787).<br>
<br>Parsley Peel is said to have given Robert &pound;500 to start business on his own account, very likely because his most able son was restless in the family fold. In 1772, at the age of twenty-two, he started a new enterprise on the Chamber Hall estate at Bury, 8 miles from Manchester, in partnership with William Yates and his uncle Howarth. The core of the business was a calico printing works, and there were also spinning mills in the vicinity and hundreds of handloom weavers employed in the Pennine villages and hamlets roundabout. The concern was established just as the cotton industry was taking off in Lancashire, and grew rapidly. On 8 July 1783 Peel married Ellen (1766&#150;1803), the daughter of William Yates; they had nine surviving children, six sons and three daughters. By 1784 he was employing at least 6800 people directly or indirectly. Dr Aiken, writing in 1795, reported that the fabrics made and printed were &#145;chiefly the finest kind of the cotton manufactory &hellip; in high request both in Manchester and London&#146;  (Aiken, 268). When the site became inadequate&#151;bleaching fields took up many acres round all print works at this time&#151;more land was acquired, then a second site was opened at Ramsbottom, just to the north of Bury. For most of the 1780s, Livesey, Hargreaves &amp; Co. of Preston was the largest of the Lancashire calico printers, but the collapse of this leviathan of the trade in 1788 left Peel, Yates &amp; Co. of Bury as undisputed leaders.<br>
<br>Not content with this spectacular achievement, Peel found further partners to start calico printing on other virgin sites. In the later 1780s, under the impetus of Crompton's mule spinning technique, Bolton was emerging as the centre of fine cotton spinning, and the possibility of imitating fine Indian cotton fabrics (muslin) challenged the Lancashire industry. Peel was the foremost partner in an integrated spinning, weaving, and finishing operation at three sites in Bolton, in 1787. The other partners were the Ainsworths, already noticed as pioneers of muslin manufacture and then of chemical bleaching in the area. Hand-loom weavers were in short supply, so Peels, Ainsworth &amp; Co. employed them as far away as Warrington, Burnley, Chorley, Wigan, and even Paisley in Scotland.<br>
<br>The pinnacle of this tireless expansion was reached in the early 1790s, when Peel purchased an estate of 4000 acres at Fazeley, near Tamworth, Staffordshire, both to build another integrated cotton works and to satisfy his social and political ambitions. Tamworth is 70 miles from Manchester, well outside the area stimulated by the expansion of the cotton industry, and so lacked the internal economies of location, but this does not seem to have deterred Peel. The town had good communications by road and canal, adequate water power, cheap labour, and local capitalists willing to back him. Peel's net profits were said to be running at over &pound;70,000 a year at this time, so there was no shortage of resources, at any rate for the time being. However, Peel's principal motive for this new venture was quickly revealed, for in 1790 he was elected member of parliament for Tamworth. There is some evidence of financial strain at points in the later 1790s&#151;particularly the closure of Peel's Bank in Manchester in 1793&#151;but by this time the entrepreneur was so rich that his position must have been virtually impregnable.<br>
<br>&#145;Peel was to calico printing what Arkwright was to spinning: a man of iron frame and mind, possessing great mercantile talent and application&#146;  (Potter, 10), a quality much rarer in the industrial revolution than its early historians assumed. Like Arkwright, he &#145;introduced among his operatives that order, arrangement and subdivision of employment which form the marked characteristics of the factory system &hellip; he insisted on a system of punctuality and regularity which approached the discipline of military drill&#146;  (Taylor, 1.6). But, perhaps most important of all, he had that keen sense of market opportunity that has been recognized as the common characteristic of all the outstanding entrepreneurs of the industrial revolution in Britain. English calico printing was established three-quarters of a century before Peel launched out in business, and was in high repute in Europe and America throughout the eighteenth century. Peel's policy was evidently the assiduous cultivation of the popular market, at first by copying London designs and undercutting the metropolitan prices, then by adoption of the new machinery and factory system which Lancashire pioneered.<br>
<br>In politics, as in industry, Peel learned much from his father, and drew on his family's status and authority in the cotton trade&#151;Parsley Peel having appeared at the head of several Manchester-based agitations in the 1780s. Although Arkwright and his partners had secured the repeal of the <span class="roman">Calico Act</span>, the industry still laboured under a heavy excise duty, so the younger Robert Peel and his friends took up the cause of freedom from taxation. It was in this cause that he entered parliament and supported William Pitt, whom he regarded as an enlightened protector of industry.<br>
<br>However, Peel's political career is remembered principally for his promotion of the <span class="roman">Health and Morals of Apprentices Act</span>, effectively the first British factory legislation. By the end of the century Peel employed more than a thousand pauper apprentices, children sent from distant parts of England to work on routine tasks in the spinning factories. Having so many other matters to attend to, the partners delegated the supervision to overseers who were sometimes less than adequate; there were scandals at Radcliffe mill (1784) and following a report from the Birmingham overseers about children sent to Lancashire (1796). Peel had the candour to admit the excessive hours worked and his neglect of juvenile employees. The letter-books of Edward Smith Stanley, MP for Preston, show the Lancashire manufacturers' angry opposition to Peel's act, so that his success displays his sincerity and determination as a reformer.<br>
<br>Peel was created a baronet in 1800 following his firm's &pound;10,000 donation to the voluntary contribution against French invasion (1797) and his raising of six companies of militia soldiers at Bury (1798). The bankruptcy of the Howarths (former partners) in 1799 and of Peel, Wilkes, Dickinson and Goodall (the London branch of Peel's Bank) in 1806 evidently terminated any further expansion that Sir Robert had planned for his business. From this period he began to run down his industrial interests, mainly by sale (or gift) to competent managers and other connections. By the end of the Napoleonic War only a few peripheral members of the Peel family retained an interest in textiles. On 17 October 1805 Peel married Susanna, the daughter of Francis Clerke; there were no children of this union. She died in 1824. Peel had a serious illness that same year and a relapse in 1830. He died on 3 May 1830 at Drayton Manor, the house he had built near Tamworth, and was buried next to his first wife in the vault of Drayton Bassett church on 11 May. Of Sir Robert's nine surviving children, five, including <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21767/', "William Yates Peel")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21760/', "Jonathan Peel")</script>, became MPs, two daughters married MPs, a son became a dean in the Church of England, and a daughter married a clergyman who later became a dean. His heir, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21764/', "Sir Robert Peel")</script>, was prime minister in 1834&#150;5 and from 1841 to 1846. His youngest son was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/73765/', "Laurence Peel")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21761/', "Peel, Sir Lawrence")</script>], MP for Cockermouth from 1827 to 1830.<br>
