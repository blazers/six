<span class="headword">Ridley,  Walter John <span class="st"> [Wally]</span></span>  (1913&#150;2007), <span class="occ">songwriter and record producer</span>, was born at 23 Medburn Street, St Pancras, London, on 28 February 1913, the eldest of five children of Walter Ernest Ridley, at the time a cloth worker's salesman, later a furniture dealer, and his wife, Edith Elizabeth Rose, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Sutton. He started piano lessons when he was six and was soon demonstrating the instruments his father sold in his furniture store in Camden Town. In 1926 he won a scholarship to the Northern Polytechnic, London, to study piano manufacture. When he was fifteen he joined the music publisher Feldmans to demonstrate songs to stage and radio performers. His first composition, written with the veteran music hall composer Harry Castling, &#145;One Little Hair on his Head&#146;, was recorded by Gracie Fields. By 1935 he was a manager at another publisher, Peter Maurice, and he promoted Michael Carr and Jimmy Kennedy, helping them without credit (according to his testimony) to write the standards &#145;Dinner for One Please, James&#146; and &#145;Did Your Mother Come from Ireland?&#146; He matched &#145;Home Town&#146; with the Crazy Gang comedians Bud Flanagan and Chesney Allen, and he wrote &#145;My Way&#146; for the Paul Robeson film <span class="italic">Jericho</span> (1937). On 15 April 1939 he married Libus&eacute; (Liba) Izerova (1918&#150;1997), a secretary, born in Czechoslovakia, daughter of Cyril Izer, tailor. They had one son and two daughters.<br>
<br>Because of suspected tuberculosis Ridley was exempted from military service during the Second World War, but his contribution to the war effort was considerable. He coached a young singer, Vera Lynn, thereby expanding her range. He produced her radio series, <span class="italic">Sincerely Yours</span>, which made her the Forces' Sweetheart, and found her biggest success, &#145;We'll Meet Again&#146;. He was impressed with a Canadian army captain based in Britain, Robert Farnon, and promoted his talent.<br>
<br>In 1948 Ridley persuaded the BBC to broadcast a radio series live from a theatre. The series starred Donald Peers, and his signature tune, again found by Ridley, was &#145;Powder Your Face with Sunshine&#146;. Ridley expected the BBC to mock his suggestion of a radio series featuring a ventriloquist, but <span class="italic">Educating Archie</span> with Archie Andrews and Peter Brough captured twenty million listeners and made household names of Beryl Reid, Max Bygraves, Harry Secombe, and Tony Hancock. Later in 1948 Ridley joined EMI Records to establish a popular catalogue for the HMV label. The label, restricted by shellac shortages, only had regular releases from Joe Loss and George Melachrino and their orchestras. Soon Ridley was having success with Peers, Bygraves, Ronnie Hilton, and Malcolm Vaughan. There was also Alma Cogan, known as &#145;the girl with the giggle&#146;, another of Ridley's suggestions. In 1955 a tearful Jeannie Carson told Ridley that she needed a decent song, &#145;something like &#147;The Trolley Song&#148;&#146; (made famous by Judy Garland), for a film she was making, <span class="italic">An Alligator Named Daisy</span>. Ridley wrote &#145;I'm in Love for the Very First Time&#146;.<br>
<br>At EMI Ridley had to determine which records from America's RCA Victor label were right for release in the UK. In 1956 he released Elvis Presley's &#145;Heartbreak Hotel&#146;, and EMI nearly sacked him. However, the public bought the record and it went to number two. Although he tried with Don Lang and Bert Weedon, Ridley knew that British artists couldn't capture that sound and he had his main success with middle of the road ballads, producing &#145;St Therese of the Roses&#146; for Malcolm Vaughan and &#145;No Other Love&#146; for Ronnie Hilton. They fitted Ridley's maxim that if a song was well written, had a clear, clean message, and was delivered with sincerity with a good quality performance, good orchestra, and good sound, it would sell and sell. His first venture into rock 'n' roll was with Johnny Kidd and the Pirates, who topped the UK charts in 1960 with &#145;Shakin' All Over&#146;. The British beat explosion of the mid-1960s was not for him but he did produce top ten hits by the Swingin' Blue Jeans, including &#145;Hippy Hippy Shake&#146; (1963).<br>
<br>When a music publisher asked Ridley to cover an American song, &#145;Mad Passionate Love&#146; (1958), he expected the song to be taken seriously, but Ridley placed it with the comic actor Bernard Bresslaw, whose lugubrious delivery made it a hit. Ridley worked with many comedians, finding Morecambe and Wise's signature tune, &#145;Bring Me Sunshine&#146;, and producing Max Bygraves's &#145;Gilly Gilly Ossenfeffer Katzenellen Bogen by the Sea&#146; (1954), Benny Hill's &#145;Ernie (the Fastest Milkman in the West)&#146; (1971), and Windsor Davies and Don Estelle's &#145;Whispering Grass&#146; (1975). He also produced big-selling albums by the Black and White Minstrel Show as well as recording the Deep River Boys, Andy Stewart, Iris Williams, and the Mike Sammes Singers.<br>
<br>In retirement Ridley undertook occasional projects, producing, for example, <span class="italic">Love is Jose Carreras</span> (1984). He won two Ivor Novello awards for his contributions to the music industry. He died at his home, Vermala, Southlea Road, Datchet, Berkshire, on 23 January 2007, of a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm. He was survived by his three children.<br>
