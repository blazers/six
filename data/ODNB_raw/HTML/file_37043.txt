<span class="headword">Wrong,  George Mackinnon</span>  (1860&#150;1948), <span class="occ">historian of Canada</span>, was a descendant of English and Scottish families whose efforts to recreate British rural gentry in the unfavourable environments of Barbados, New York, New Brunswick, or Upper Canada petered out just after his birth, on 25 June 1860, at his grandfather's pioneer farm at Grovesend, Upper Canada, near Lake Erie. His bookish, fanciful father, Gilbert Wrong, his mother, Christian Mackinnon, and their many dependants moved a few miles eastward to Vienna, a village which was dwindling (with the forest industries) but possessed a good grammar school, where Wrong received his early education. He then worked for a time in a bookstore in Toronto, where he also converted from Methodism to evangelical Anglicanism.<br>
<br>At the age of nineteen Wrong enrolled in theology at the newly incorporated Wycliffe College, a low-church divinity school, and in 1880 in the arts course at University College in Toronto. By 1883 his energies and abilities had enabled him concurrently to complete his studies in divinity and to graduate with first-class honours in mental and moral philosophy. Although he entered holy orders and occasionally thereafter served and preached, he never held a parish but followed his scholarly bent as lecturer in ecclesiastical history and liturgics at Wycliffe and by vacation study in England and on the continent. He was actively involved in charity and social work, serving on the founding committee of the Toronto Mission Union and raising funds for various social Christian projects. In 1886 he married Sophia Hume (<i>d</i>. 1931), the daughter of (Dominick) Edward Blake, formerly prime minister of Ontario.<br>
<br>When Sir Daniel Wilson, president of Toronto University and professor of English literature and history at University College, died in 1892, Wrong applied for the chair, but was made lecturer only. Two years later he became the first professor of history at the University of Toronto. This appointment was attributed by some to nepotism by Wrong's father-in-law, who was chancellor of the university. A professor who made the charge in the press was dismissed, and his removal provoked a &#145;students' strike&#146; in which W. L. Mackenzie King and Hamar Greenwood took a leading part. This and other university matters were investigated by royal commission in 1895, but Wrong was cleared of the accusation.<br>
<br>Wrong's chosen role was to prod Canadians into realization and emulation of the new historical scholarship of Germany, Great Britain, and the United States by founding the <span class="italic">Review of Historical Publications Relating to Canada</span>, which from 1897 to 1919 (and from 1920 as part of the quarterly <span class="italic">Canadian Historical Review</span>) annually listed or reviewed exactingly every discoverable cogent item and made it unwise to publish uncritical history. Wrong managed to combine extensive study, writing, editorial work, public and academic responsibilities, and social activity in Canada, Great Britain, and the United States, perhaps because he rose daily at 5 a.m. Between 1894 and his retirement in 1927 he secured the recognition of history as a distinct discipline and created a separate department at Toronto, drawing heavily on Oxford for personnel and teaching methods.<br>
<br>More than any other person of his day, Wrong made English-speaking Canadians aware of sound history, an achievement which was signalized by honours at home and abroad. Shortly after 1900 he and others whom he had influenced directly or indirectly began to furnish good, readable textbooks of British and Canadian history which secured recognition in the primary and secondary schools. Co-operative scholarship provided higher education and serious readers with large series of biographical and historical monographs which incorporated the best available scholarship. Wrong's editorial assistance to the Canadian publisher Robert Glasgow in the <span class="italic">Chronicles of Canada</span> (32 vols., 1914&#150;16) laid the foundations for Glasgow's later <span class="italic">Chronicles of America</span> (50 vols., 1918&#150;21), to which Wrong contributed <span class="italic">The Conquest of New France</span> (1918) and <span class="italic">Washington and his Comrades in Arms</span> (1921). In 1905 he played a leading role in founding the Champlain Society, whose admirable editions of original or rare historical materials reflected his editorial hand for at least twenty years. He used his retirement after 1927 for writing some long-planned books until health and eyesight began to fail him about 1940. In particular <span class="italic">The Rise and Fall of New France</span> (2 vols., 1928) and <span class="italic">Canada and the American Revolution</span> (1935) are very attractive examples of his style. <span class="italic">A Canadian Manor and its Seigneurs</span> (1908), a charming product of research into the records of Murray Bay, was reprinted in 1926.<br>
<br>Wrong's publications were, however, rarely based on archival research, and he was critical of excessive specialization. He was particularly influenced by Lord Acton, from whom he drew the conclusion that, although the historian must be as impartial as possible, it was also his duty to draw moral judgements from the past that could be applied to the present. His studies of Canadian history focused on two major themes. A committed imperialist and one of the founders in 1909 of the Canadian branch of the Round Table, Wrong was concerned to document Canada's significance in the evolution of the Commonwealth. His other fascination was English&#150;French relations in Canada. He drew heavily on Francis Parkman's work, but he did not share Parkman's disdain for the <i>ancien r&eacute;gime</i> in New France. None the less, in retrospect, there is little in Wrong's work that was original. That on French Canada was frequently patronizing and only slightly altered the standard interpretation of New France as an essentially conservative and backward society. As Carl Berger points out, even <span class="italic">Canada and the American Revolution</span>&#151;perhaps Wrong's best-known work&#151;&#145;was anachronistic and derivative as a piece of historical scholarship&#146;  (Berger, 46). None of it is much read today.<br>
<br>Wrong's marriage to his first wife provided him with access to the Canadian social &eacute;lite, and their children formed an unusual Anglo-Canadian group. Margaret Christian (1887&#150;1948) became a leader in African education; Edward Murray (1889&#150;1928) was fellow and tutor of Magdalen College, Oxford; Harold Verschoyle (1891&#150;1916) was killed in action; Humphrey Hume (1894&#150;1954), after teaching history at the University of Toronto, entered the Canadian department of external affairs in 1927 and subsequently held its highest posts at home and abroad; and Agnes Honoria (<i>b</i>. 1903) married C. H. A. Armstrong, QC, of Toronto. In 1933, following his first wife's death, Wrong married Elizabeth Burgwynne. She survived him when he died, about midnight, on 28 June 1948 in Toronto.<br>
