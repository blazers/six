<span class="headword">Barnsley,  Alan Gabriel</span> <span class="st"> [<em>pseud. </em>Gabriel Fielding]</span>  (1916&#150;1986), <span class="occ">novelist and poet</span>, was born on 25 March 1916 in Hexham, Northumberland, the fifth of the six children of George Barnsley (1875&#150;1956), a clergyman in the Church of England, and his wife, Katherine Mary Fielding-Smith (1884&#150;1974), who claimed descent from the eighteenth-century novelist and playwright Henry Fielding. Barnsley's father suffered from sleeping sickness, contracted in the First World War; his mother was a playwright and a breeder of whippets. Barnsley described his childhood as &#145;golden&#146; until at the age of eight he was sent off to the Grange School, Eastbourne, Sussex, where he experienced hostility from masters and fellow pupils. Looking back as an adult on his time at the Grange, he thought that it probably &#145;was the beginning of the pain out of which I write&#146;  (Newquist, 196). He later attended St Edward's School, Oxford, and Llangefni county school, Anglesey, Wales. When his time came for university study, Barnsley enrolled at Trinity College, Dublin. His parents felt that Trinity would lead to a &#145;sympathetic career&#146; in medicine and convinced Barnsley that his studies would also be a good preparation for writing  (Newquist, 197). At Trinity Barnsley won prizes in anatomy, biology, and oratory and was a member of the Philosophical Society; but after earning his University of Dublin BA in May 1940, he was unable to gain admission to a local hospital for medical studies, probably because he was known to have written a satire on Dublin hospitals. Instead, he enrolled in May 1941 at St George's Hospital, London. He qualified MRCS LRCP in 1942.<br>
<br>In 1943 Barnsley married Edwina Eleanora Cook (<i>b</i>. 1923) of Storrington, Sussex, and joined the Royal Army Medical Corps, in which he served until 1946, leaving with the rank of captain. Barnsley entered in 1946 into general medical practice in Maidstone, Kent, a practice that continued until 1966. In time he also assumed the duty of deputy medical officer of Maidstone Prison. He and his wife were received into the Roman Catholic church on 8 September 1954. Barnsley's religious conversion also had literary links, which, along with illness and the stress of work, led him to take up writing in earnest. He had carefully read Graham Greene and Evelyn Waugh, both converts to Catholicism, and was a close friend of Muriel Spark, another convert. Spark dedicated her first novel, <span class="italic">The Comforters</span>, to the Barnsleys and was godmother to one of their children. Early on, Greene encouraged Barnsley's writing. For additional encouragement there had always been the example of his mother, of whom he wrote, &#145;it was her ardour and longing&#151;not for me but for her own work&#151;that contributed to my determination [to be a storyteller]&#146;  (Wakeman, 472).<br>
<br>Barnsley first tried poetry. <span class="italic">The Frog Prince and other Poems</span> came out in 1952. <span class="italic">Brotherly Love</span> (1954), his first novel, introduced John Blaydon, the character whose often disheartening experiences are at the centre of five novels. In <span class="italic">Brotherly Love</span> John Blaydon is troubled by a domineering mother and a lustful older brother, a misfit of a clergyman. A second volume of poetry, <span class="italic">XXVIII Poems</span>, appeared in 1955 and reflected the author's developing religious sensibility. In the second Blaydon novel, <span class="italic">In the Time of Greenbloom</span> (1956), the girl he loves is raped and murdered, he is treated cruelly at school, and he meets and is saved from despair by a fantastic Jew named Greenbloom, an Oxford student. In the novel <span class="italic">Eight Days</span> (1958), Barnsley temporarily departed from the world of the Blaydon family to enter Graham Greene country: a prison doctor, a recent convert to Roman Catholicism, on vacation in north Africa, becomes caught up in spy intrigue. Then with the publication of <span class="italic">Through Streets Broad and Narrow</span> (1960) Barnsley completed what at the time he considered a trilogy about John Blaydon, now a medical student in frequent distress in Dublin.<br>
<br>According to Barnsley, <span class="italic">The Birthday King</span> (1962) was an attempt to get away from the subjectivity of the trilogy  (Wakeman, 472). The novel is about a family of part-Jewish Catholic industrialists in Nazi Germany. It won the W. H. Smith prize for literature as well as the St Thomas More gold medal in the USA in 1964. <span class="italic">Gentlemen in their Season</span> (1966), about a Catholic convert and an atheist working in the religious division of the BBC, followed. <span class="italic">New Queens for Old</span> (1972) consisted of a novella and nine short stories. It won the 1972 Governor's literary award in the state of Washington, USA. In <span class="italic">Pretty Doll Houses</span> (1979) Barnsley returned to the Blaydons with the usual echoes&#151;in this case movement of the family from Sussex to Yorkshire to Anglesey&#151;of Barnsley's own upbringing. Finally in 1986, the year of his death, he published <span class="italic">The Women of Guinea Lane</span>, in which John Blaydon, now a surgeon at Guinea Lane Hospital in Middlesex during the Second World War, observes the women around him.<br>
<br>J. K. L. Walker wrote in the <span class="italic">Times Literary Supplement</span> of <span class="italic">The Women of Guinea Lane</span>: &#145;It is difficult not to admire Fielding's humanity, his sense that life, especially for women, is hard, that happiness is precarious and daily vulnerable to some unexplained assault on body or mind&#146;  (Walker). That humanity shows frequently in the novels in Barnsley's characters' search for love. To Barnsley &#145;it is not at all so lucky to <i>be</i> loved as it is to <i>love</i>&#146; as the character Rachel says to John Blaydon in <span class="italic">Greenbloom</span>  (p. 254). Barnsley himself told an interviewer that &#145;The most important part of living is loving&#146; and that &#145;I have never seen a man make a success of his life without loving his fellow creatures&#146;  (Newquist, 203, 206).<br>
<br>As his writing took up more and more of his time and interest, Barnsley gradually cut back on his medical practice. In addition to his creative writing, he was publishing essays in literary journals, and from 1961 on he was doing occasional broadcasts for the BBC. For his journalism he received a Catholic Press Association award in 1965. Then in 1966 he accepted a one-year appointment as author-in-residence at Washington State University in Pullman, Washington. He never returned to medical practice. After his year as visiting artist ended, he accepted an appointment as professor at Washington State, where he taught until retiring in 1981. Barnsley had been made DLitt by Gonzaga University in Spokane, Washington, in 1967, and after his retirement Washington State named him professor emeritus.<br>
<br>Barnsley died on 27 November 1986 at 14625 NE 34th Street, apartment G 19, in Bellevue, Washington, having suffered for some months the effects of lung cancer. He was cremated on 2 December 1986 at Sunset crematory in Bellevue, Washington; later his ashes were interred in a churchyard near Aylesford, Kent. Inscribed on his headstone are the words &#145;Love is always more&#146;. Barnsley was survived by his widow, three sons, and two daughters.<br>
