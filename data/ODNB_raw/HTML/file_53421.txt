<span class="headword">Nesbitt family</span>  (<em>per. </em><em>c.</em>1717&#150;<em>c.</em>1900), <span class="occ">merchants and bankers</span>, came to prominence with <a name="cosubject_53419"></a><span class="headword">Albert Nesbitt</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1753)<span class="occ"></span>, a son of Andrew Nesbitt (<i>d</i>. 1692) and his wife, Anne Lindsay. Presumably born in Ireland, he was introduced about 1717, most likely by a kinsman, to the firm of Gould, Baltic merchants in London. In 1729 he married Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1781), sister of his business partners, Nathaniel Gould (<i>d</i>. 1738) and his brother John (<i>d</i>. 1740); they had a daughter, Rachel.<br>
<br>Albert Nesbitt and the Gould brothers became the sole partners in the firm after the deaths of the latters' uncle, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/37477/', "Sir Nathaniel Gould")</script>, in 1728 and their father, John Gould, in 1736. The firm was based in Coleman Street until about 1752 when it moved to 8 Bishopsgate Within. It was the chief house in the city dealing with Irish business: its partners acted principally as bill agents between London and Ireland, and had many distinguished Irish clients, including members of the Conolly family. Albert, a man of sound judgement, directed the firm's business away from the Baltic to include the import of wines from Bordeaux and elsewhere to London and Ireland. He took as apprentices three of his brother Thomas's younger sons, <a href="#cosubject_53420">Arnold [<i>see below</i>]</a>, Albert (<i>d</i>. 1776), and Alexander (<i>bap</i>. 1730, <i>d</i>. 1772).<br>
<br>Albert Nesbitt's commercial success enabled him to move from the city to a suburban villa at Putney about 1738 and to buy estates in Sussex, at Ringmer in 1741, at Whyly in East Hoathly in 1750, and at Winchelsea in 1751. The wealth engendered by the firm, and his family and business connections, through the Goulds, with the Pelhams allowed him to enter parliament, sitting on the Treasury interest for Huntingdon in 1741 and for Mitchell in Cornwall in 1747. He died on 12 January 1753 in his coach near London on the Bath Road and was buried on 19 January at Putney.<br>
<br>The business was carried on by Albert's nephew <a name="cosubject_53420"></a><span class="headword">Arnold Nesbitt</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1721, <em>d.</em> 1779)<span class="occ"></span>, a younger son of his brother Thomas and Thomas's second wife, Jane Cosby (<i>d</i>. 1771), an Irish heiress. Arnold was baptized in Kilmore Cathedral near Cavan in Ireland on 27 March 1721, was apprenticed to his uncle by 1744, and was his partner by 1753. The wealth of the firm and the continued patronage of the Pelhams allowed him, like his uncle, to represent the Treasury interest in parliament and to buy more properties in Sussex, Icklesham Manor in 1760 and at Winchelsea between 1753 and 1767. He briefly succeeded his uncle at Mitchell in 1753, and sat for Winchelsea from 1754 to 1761 when the duke of Newcastle requested that he stand down. An ambitious and enterprising man, he rejected Newcastle's control, successfully challenged the Treasury interest there in law suits called the Winchelsea causes, and after 1769 controlled one of the borough's two seats. He sat again in 1770 but, having established his influence there beyond doubt, chose instead to sit from 1774 for Cricklade in Wiltshire, the borough and hundred of which he had bought during his exclusion from Winchelsea.<br>
<br>Arnold Nesbitt's domestic base in London was the counting house in Bishopsgate, the lease of which had been devised to him by his uncle, until about 1772 when he moved to a newly built house in Grafton Street. In the same year the firm moved to 18 Aldermanbury where it remained until 1802. In 1750 Arnold Nesbitt was prosperous enough to lease a suburban villa at Keston, Kent, where he lived until about 1760, when he moved to another at West Wickham, also in Kent. He is known to have had liaisons with four women: Nancy Parsons; Martha Yeates, by whom he had two sons, Colebrooke Nesbitt and Arnold Nesbitt (1756&#150;1813); Ann Dryland, later Stevenson (1735&#150;1783), by whom he had a son John (<i>bap</i>. 1761); and another by whom he had a daughter, Elizabeth or Frances Moore. In 1758 Nesbitt married Susanna, daughter of Ralph Thrale and sister of his close friend Henry Thrale, the Southwark brewer. He consequently became part of the social circle formed around Samuel Johnson from 1765 at Thrale's houses in Streatham and Southwark which included Sir Joshua Reynolds, David Garrick, and Oliver Goldsmith.<br>
<br>Under Arnold Nesbitt's leadership, banking and remitting to Ireland, where clients included Thomas Conolly (1738&#150;1803), remained the chief business of the firm. To it he added the import of sugar and rum from estates in Grenada and the West Indies, and, from 1756, the supply under government contract of provisions and money for troops in the American colonies. Sir George Colebrooke, bt (1729&#150;1809), was his chief associate in those enterprises, and in the founding of a cambric manufactory in Winchelsea in 1761 and of a bank in Dublin in 1764.<br>
<br>Both Colebrooke and Nesbitt suffered a severe reverse in the financial crisis of June 1772. Heavy borrowing after 1772 and the burden of his government contracts may have hastened Nesbitt's death. He was unwell in March 1779 and, according to Samuel Johnson, did not fight his illness  (<span class="italic">Letters of Samuel Johnson</span>, ed. B. Redford, 1992&#150;1994 3.371). He died in Grafton Street on 7 or 12 April 1779 and was buried in Icklesham church on 18 April. Examination of his affairs showed that he was insolvent.<br>
<br>Unresolved chancery proceedings and debts to the Treasury allowed the business to continue uninterrupted under the direction of Arnold Nesbitt's nephew <a name="cosubject_53418"></a><span class="headword">John [i] Nesbitt</span>  (1745/6&#150;1817)<span class="occ"></span>, whom he had taken as a partner after the death of his brother Albert in 1776. A younger son of Arnold's eldest brother Cosby Nesbitt and Cosby's wife, Anne Enery, John Nesbitt was presumably born in Ireland and was apprenticed to his uncle as a youth. When in the city he lived in the Aldermanbury counting house and, possibly from 1776, outside London in the villa at Keston either inherited or bought from the younger Albert Nesbitt.<br>
<br>John Nesbitt's cousin and apprentice, the younger Arnold Nesbitt, also lived in the counting house. In 1784 they were joined by Edward Stewart and until 1802 the firm was usually called Nesbitt and Stewart. The younger Arnold later left, and was replaced by John Nesbitt's nephew, John [ii] Nesbitt (<i>d</i>. 1853). The type of business remained similar, although in 1797 the firm ceased to act for Thomas Conolly after his repeated failure to take up bills presented to him.<br>
<br>The elder John Nesbitt moved to a house in Grafton Street about 1787. He, too, was a member of parliament and sat for Winchelsea (1780&#150;90), Gatton (1790&#150;96), and Bodmin (1796&#150;1802). He was a friend and political ally of Charles James Fox who proposed him for Brooks's in 1783. A connoisseur of wines and paintings, he was from 1796 to 1802 the owner of the version of Gainsborough's <span class="italic">Blue Boy</span> later in the Huntington Library. His career was overshadowed by his uncle's insolvency, and, because of it, he was forced into bankruptcy in 1802 and his connection with the firm ended. The Keston house was sold and the lease of that in Grafton Street given up.<br>
<br>At the request of the prince regent, with whom he had enjoyed a friendship, John [i] Nesbitt was appointed a commissioner of hackney carriages in 1814. In 1815 he secured the discharge by statute of Arnold Nesbitt's estate from his debt to the Treasury and afterwards reduced the remaining debt to &pound;26,114 by negotiation. He died in Bolton Street, where he had lived from about 1807, on 15 March 1817 and was buried in the parish of St George, Hanover Square, on 22 March. From 1803 his nephew John [ii] Nesbitt was based at 16 Tokenhouse Yard and the firm, staffed by younger members of the Nesbitt family, continued as general provision merchants in the city and Southwark until the early twentieth century.<br>
