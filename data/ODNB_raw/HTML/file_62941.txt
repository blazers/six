<span class="headword">Clarke,  Augustine Joseph <span class="st"> [Austin]</span></span>  (1896&#150;1974), <span class="occ">writer and radio broadcaster</span>, was born on 9 May 1896 at 83 Manor Street, Dublin, the eleventh of twelve children (four of whom survived to adulthood) of Augustine Matthew Clarke (<i>d</i>. 1918), plumber, son of Denis Clarke, farm labourer, of Blackditches, co. Wicklow, and Ellen, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Browne (1860&#150;1944), daughter of William Browne, skinner, of Watling Street, Dublin. At retirement Clarke's father had become superintendent of waterworks of Dublin corporation. His mother, who had grown up illiterate in a Dublin tenement, was a cold and forceful character. <h2>
<a name="Earlyyearseducationandliteraryinfluences"></a>Early years, education, and literary influences</h2>As the youngest surviving child of the family, and often in poor health, Clarke was much cosseted. A strong religious consciousness and puritan reserve, especially in physical matters, pervaded the household. Considerable emphasis was placed on sinfulness and religious duties, and the boy grew up fearing eternal damnation; as an adult he strenuously resisted his inherited religious beliefs. However, visits to the theatre and cinema, violin lessons and holidays in Wicklow, co. Meath, and with relatives in Liverpool, punctuated the rigour. Clarke's early education began at the Convent of the Holy Faith, Dominic Street. A short stint at the national school, Dorset Street, was followed by another in an Irish Christian Brothers' school at St Mary's Place, from which he was withdrawn because of frequent beatings. In 1905 he was enrolled in Belvedere College, Dublin, a Jesuit public school established in 1832 and James Joyce's alma mater; he remained there until 1912, except for a single unhappy term at Mungret College, Limerick, a Jesuit boarding-school. In 1912 he was awarded seventy-first place in the intermediate examination, and won a municipal scholarship to University College, Dublin. <br>
<br>There Clarke encountered antiquarians and scholars of the Literary Revival, including Osborne Bergin, George Sigerson, and Douglas Hyde. Performances at the Abbey Theatre, among them plays by W. B. Yeats, Lady Augusta Gregory, and Gerhart Hauptmann, and at the Irish Theatre, which staged continental plays, inspired him. Perhaps encouraged by his lecturer George O'Neill, whose assignments included exercises in poetic form, he began to write verse. In 1915 he was awarded a first-class honours degree in English language and literature, and enrolled for a master's degree. He proposed to write a thesis on Elizabethan lute music, under the supervision of Thomas MacDonagh, the poet and revolutionary, but the latter's execution for his part in the 1916 Easter rising obliged Clarke to submit an alternative dissertation on the dramatist John Ford. He was awarded a first-class honours degree and second place in the arts faculty. <h2>
<a name="Breakdownandmarriage19171921"></a>Breakdown and marriage, 1917&#150;1921</h2>Now Clarke's literary circle included F. R. Higgins, George Russell, Joseph Campbell, and Stephen MacKenna, and in 1917 his first book of verse, an epic poem, <span class="italic">The Vengeance of Fionn</span>, was published to considerable acclaim. Treating its mythic subject matter in Miltonic blank verse, it is Romantic in mood, with flashes of lyricism. Among its detractors was Campbell, who charged that it was derivative and pretentious. That the book became a topic of vehement debate helped to establish its writer. <br>
<br>In autumn 1917 Clarke was appointed assistant lecturer in the department of English at University College, Dublin. As civil unrest intensified, his mental health deteriorated and in March 1919 his mother committed him to St Patrick's Hospital, where he was confined for over a year with severe depression and physical breakdown. Before his hospitalization he had met Cornelia Alice Mary Cummins (1889&#150;1943), daughter of Edward Cummins, a bank manager from Drogheda, co. Louth, and his wife, formerly Winifred Blake. A well-educated older woman with a small private income who had lived abroad, Cummins established a career as a journalist who also published short stories and poor-quality verse under the pseudonym Margaret Lyster. She was considered eccentric, even mad; violently antisemitic, she harboured strong Nazi sympathies in later life. She and Clarke married secretly in a register office in Dublin on 31 December 1920, but the union was probably unconsummated and lasted less than a fortnight. About 1928 Clarke instigated unsuccessful divorce proceedings. <br>
<br>Two books of epic poetry, <span class="italic">The Fires of Ba&auml;l</span> and <span class="italic">The Sword of the West</span>, were published in 1921. Reviews were disappointing. Excessive verbal decoration, incoherent plot, and poor character portrayal were among the charges levelled against them. <span class="italic">The Spectator</span> responded to the first by commenting that Clarke &#145;neither rises to the sublime nor sinks to the incompetent&#146;  (28 May 1921). <h2>
<a name="England19211937"></a>England, 1921&#150;1937</h2>Whether because of his absence due to illness or, as Clarke suggests, his civil marriage, University College, Dublin, dispensed with his services as a lecturer. After visiting Paris, and still prone to bouts of depression which plagued him throughout his life, he established himself in London as a literary journalist. However, he also continued to spend time in Ireland, and his critical writings and verse maintained their focus on the matter of Ireland. Among the journals that printed his workmanlike reviews were the <span class="italic">Times Literary Supplement</span>, the <span class="italic">Nation and Athenaeum</span>, the <span class="italic">New Statesman</span>, and, from 1927, <span class="italic">T.P.'s Weekly</span>, a popular paper owned by T. P. O'Connor MP, where he regularly undertook editorial duties. In addition, in the 1930s, his reviews appeared in <span class="italic">The Observer</span> and the <span class="italic">London Mercury</span>. The publishers George Allen and Unwin issued a vigorous collection of poems: <span class="italic">The Cattledrive in Connaught</span> (1925). The following year Clarke's first play, <span class="italic">The Son of Learning</span>, was published in the <span class="italic">Dublin Magazine</span>, having been rejected by W. B. Yeats at the Abbey Theatre. Terence Gray staged it as part of the Cambridge Theatre Festival in 1927, and Hilton Edwards and Micheal Mac Liamoir had it performed in the Gate Theatre, Dublin, in 1930, the year in which <span class="italic">The Flame: a Play in one Act</span> was also published. <span class="italic">Pilgrimage and other Poems</span> (1928) signalled Clarke's departure from mythological subject matter in favour of the historically verifiable late medieval monastic period. The first of three romance novels set in medieval Ireland&#151;<span class="italic">The Bright Temptation</span> (1932), <span class="italic">The Singing-Men at Cashel</span> (1936), and <span class="italic">The Sun Dances at Easter</span> (1952), all proscribed under the <span class="roman">Censorship of Literature Act</span> (1929)&#151;sold well. <br>
<br>In 1932 W. B. Yeats nominated Clarke a founder member of the Irish Academy of Letters, whose aim was to resist censorship, which Clarke passionately opposed all his life. By 1931 he had met Norah Esmerelda Patricia Walker (1900&#150;1985), daughter of journalist Frederick Walker and his wife, formerly Nannie Harris, daughter of Matt Harris, MP for East Galway (1885&#150;90). Together they raised three boys: Donald (1931&#150;1976), Aidan (<i>b</i>. 1933), and Robert Dardis (<i>b</i>. 1939). They married on 3 January 1945, after the death of Clarke's first wife. Walker was a kindly, intelligent, self-effacing woman; she had been educated at Loreto College, St Stephens Green, Dublin and at University College, Dublin. She spoke German fluently and held strong republican beliefs. The union was happy and mutually supportive but because of its irregular status until the marriage, it attracted disapproval, not least from the Clarke family. From 1933 to 1937 the family settled in St Albans, Hertfordshire. A proposal in the mid-1930s that Clarke write a biography of W. B. Yeats had to be abandoned when Yeats's co-operation was not forthcoming. From 1933 to 1937 Clarke acted as an adjudicator at the Oxford Festival of Spoken Poetry, and his fortieth birthday saw the issue of his <span class="italic">Collected Poems</span>. <h2>
<a name="ReturntoIrelandtheatreradio19371955"></a>Return to Ireland, theatre, radio, 1937&#150;1955</h2>In 1937 Clarke settled in Bridge House, Templeogue, outside Dublin, in which property he held a life interest, and there he remained until his death. Despite Templeogue's pleasant ambience, the tortuous poems of <span class="italic">Night and Morning</span> (1938) bespeak a scrupled individuality struggling with the loss of faith. By the time the war began Clarke's weekly &#145;at homes&#146; had become a feature of Dublin literary life, and he could be seen first in The Pearl bar, and then, when the literati moved their custom, at The Palace bar. In his guise as member of the writers' association PEN, and sometime president of its Dublin centre (1942), he continued to resist censorship. His reviews were a regular feature of the <span class="italic">Irish Times</span>'s literary page from 1940 until his death, except for a five-year hiatus (1962&#150;7), and he contributed substantially to Seumas O'Sullivan's <span class="italic">Dublin Magazine</span>. Given the sheer volume of reviews he was obliged to undertake to eke out a living, the quality inevitably varied. Often his income was negligible, always it was uncertain, but he prided himself in being one of the few contemporary Irishmen of letters earning a livelihood entirely from writing. <br>
<br>Theatre and radio also beckoned. In 1939 Clarke and Robert Farren, broadcaster and poet, established the Dublin Verse-Speaking Society, and it remained active until the late 1960s. It frequently broadcast dramatic and choral poetry, introduced and directed by Clarke, on Radio &Eacute;ireann. In addition it performed verse plays and dramatic verse annually in the Peacock Theatre. In 1944 Clarke formed the Lyric Theatre Company, which drew on the talents of the society but also employed professional actors and directors. Until the Abbey Theatre was destroyed in 1951 it successfully staged verse performances, usually twice a year, often including Clarke's own plays in its repertory. Radio &Eacute;ireann broadcast many of these performances. In the 1940s Clarke published eight plays, most under his own Bridge Press imprint and in limited editions, all performed by the Lyric or his verse-speakers. Clarke's radio programmes, broadcast regularly over more than quarter of a century, sought to popularize and evaluate poetry, and his series of poetry competitions held considerable appeal, attracting entries from some notable aspiring writers. Clarke also served as president of the Irish Academy of Letters from 1952 to 1954. <h2>
<a name="Post1955satireandsuccess"></a>Post-1955: satire and success</h2>After seventeen years devoted to verse theatre, the poems of <span class="italic">Ancient Lights, Poems and Satires</span> (1955) found Clarke confronting contemporary social problems and railing against injustice, especially clerical. Institutional inhumanity and rapacity are topics revisited in the years and the many poetry collections that follow. Contraception, the ostracism of single mothers, corporal punishment in schools, the spartan regime of orphanages, the misled piety of spinsters, poverty&#151;all come under his caustic scrutiny, attracting comparison with Jonathan Swift. Little wonder that he styled himself &#145;local complainer&#146; in one poem. Liam Miller's Dolmen Press found him new readers and by the 1960s many regarded him as the greatest Irish poet since Yeats. The publication of the long poem <span class="italic">Mnemosyne Lay in Dust</span> (1966) was a personal landmark as well as a critical success: its subject matter is Clarke's breakdown of 1919, here confronted publicly for the first time. His <span class="italic">Collected Plays</span> appeared in 1963, followed by <span class="italic">Two Interludes Adapted from Cervantes</span> (1968) and <span class="italic">The Impuritans</span> (1973). <br>
<br>Among the awards bestowed on Clarke were a commission from the British Arts Council (1961), the Denis Devlin Memorial award for poetry (1964), an honorary DLitt degree from Dublin University (1966), the supreme award of the Irish Academy of Letters, the Gregory medal (1968), and the American Irish Foundation literary award (1972). <br>
<br>In old age Clarke returned often to the epic form to proclaim secular redemption and release, attainable through eroticism, with some success in &#145;The Healing of Mis&#146;. Austin Clarke died at his home, Bridge House, of prostate cancer on 19 March 1974, having previously suffered at least two heart attacks. His body was cremated privately in Belfast and a memorial tribute was held in the Abbey Theatre on 7 April 1974. His <span class="italic">Collected Poems, 1917&#150;1974</span> and an edition of the <span class="italic">Irish University Review</span> (1974) devoted to his work were then in preparation. A second volume of collected plays mooted before his death did not materialize, but <span class="italic">The Third Kiss: a Comedy in one Act</span> was published in 1976 and <span class="italic">Liberty Lane</span> in 1978. <br>
<br>Clarke's technical virtuosity and experimentation earned him the respect of fellow poets, but his tendency to load himself with chains and then try to get out of them (as he termed his art) led him into infelicities. For too long the matter of Ireland preoccupied him, as did Gaelic prosody: he was forty-two before <span class="italic">Night and Morning</span> was published. However, his especial contribution to literature is a lyricism as intense as his swingeing critique of Irish society. His work includes eighteen books of poetry, eighteen completed verse plays, thousands of literary reviews, three romance novels, three volumes of autobiography, numerous critical works and broadcasts. <br>
<br>Lugubrious but witty, Clarke's urbane sensibility proved a necessary antidote to the pastoral pieties to which the Ireland of his times subscribed. Possessed of an acute sense of injustice that informed his satire, his governing myth comprised a world that never lived up to its promise. His accomplished but savage indignation is his especially enduring legacy.<br>
