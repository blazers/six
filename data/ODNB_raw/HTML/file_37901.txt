<span class="headword">Robertson,  Henry</span>  (1816&#150;1888), <span class="occ">civil engineer</span>, was born in Banff on 11 January 1816, the youngest of the twelve children of Duncan Robertson, Inland Revenue official, and his wife, Christian Anderson. With the aid of a scholarship he studied at the University of Aberdeen, where he graduated MA before he was twenty. At about that time his father died and the family moved to Glasgow; soon afterwards Robertson decided to become an engineer.<br>
<br>After some training under Peter McQuistin, a Glasgow civil engineer, and working as a mining engineer in Lanarkshire and on Dundee waterworks, Robertson became increasingly involved in railway engineering. He assisted in Joseph Locke's survey of the west coast main line route between Lancaster and Glasgow on the Shap Fell section, and took a masonry contract on Locke's Glasgow, Paisley, and Greenock line which brought him into contact with William Mackenzie and other engineers. He was approached by capitalists in 1842 to report on the practicality of restoring the derelict Brymbo ironworks in Denbighshire, which formerly belonged to John Wilkinson. The shareholders included Mackenzie, William Betts, and A. M. Ross, all former associates of Hugh MacIntosh. Robertson was so favourably impressed by the industrial potential of the area that when the necessary capital was raised he moved south to Chester. In 1846 he married Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1892), daughter of William Dean of London. They had one son and three daughters.<br>
<br>Robertson realized that the improvement of communications throughout the area was a pressing need, and became involved in the construction of many of the railway lines on both sides of the Welsh border, including the North Wales Mineral Railway which served the Brymbo ironworks, the Shrewsbury to Hereford line, the LNWR central Wales line from Craven Arms to Llandovery, the Ruabon to Dolgellau line, and the branch to Bala and Blaenau Ffestiniog. The contractor for many of these lines was Thomas Brassey. As part of these works Robertson designed a number of fine masonry viaducts, such as those at Cefn and Chirk, as well as the Kingsland Bridge over the Severn at Shrewsbury, then one of the largest single-span iron bridges in Britain.<br>
<br>When steel began to supersede iron in the 1880s Robertson developed the Brymbo ironworks into the largest steelworks in north Wales, and by that time he had also acquired a number of important collieries and other industrial concerns. In 1855 he had been brought in as a partner to Beyer and Peacock's Gorton factory in Manchester, recently built for the manufacture of railway locomotives, and he maintained an active role in the management of Beyer, Peacock &amp; Co. until his death. He was also a partner in the firm of Robertson and Mackintosh, civil engineers, with offices in London.<br>
<br>Robertson was chairman of three of the railway companies of north Wales as well as the Wirral Railways Company; chairman of the Minera Lime Company, the Broughton and Plas Power Coal Company, the Brymbo Steel Company, and the Brymbo Water Company; and director of the Wrexham, Mold, and Connah's Quay Railway Company. He was also an active politician, elected to represent Shrewsbury as a Liberal in parliament 1862&#150;5 and 1874&#150;85. In 1885 he was elected MP for Merioneth. He was a JP for Merioneth and Denbighshire.<br>
<br>Robertson was elected a member of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers in 1848 and of the Institution of Civil Engineers the following year. He died on 22 March 1888 at his mansion, Crogen, near Pal&eacute;, Llandderfel, Merioneth, and was buried in Llandderfel churchyard. His wife died in 1892.<br>
