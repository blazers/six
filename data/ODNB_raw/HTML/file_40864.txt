<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Payne,  Ernest Alexander</span>  (1902&#150;1980), <span class="occ">Baptist minister and ecumenist</span>, was born on 19 February 1902 at 38 Ickburgh Road, Upper Clapton, London, the eldest of the three children of Alexander Payne (1862&#150;1941), partner in an accountancy firm bearing his name, and his wife, Catherine Griffiths (1863&#150;1943). The family became deeply involved in the life of the Downs Baptist Church in Clapton. It was in this church that Ernest Payne was baptized as a believer in July 1917.<br>
<br>Two further children were born to Alexander and Catherine Payne, Margaret in 1903 and Philip in 1905. In September 1911 Ernest Payne became a pupil at Hackney Downs secondary school. In spite of the difficulties of the war years he achieved well academically, so much so that in October 1919 he entered King's College, London, to study for a general arts degree in Latin, English, history, and philosophy. He graduated after two years and spent the next year studying for an honours degree in philosophy, which he gained in June 1922.<br>
<br>Payne became convinced that his future lay in full-time service within the Baptist denomination&#151;very possibly abroad with the Baptist Missionary Society. He applied successfully for entrance to Regent's Park College, a Baptist ministerial training college in London. Here he studied from October 1922 to July 1925, gaining the degree of bachelor of divinity of London University. In 1923 he attended the first of his many Student Christian Movement conferences at Swanwick. These experiences introduced him to the early development of the ecumenical movement.<br>
<br>Payne's college years were increasingly clouded by the health problems of his younger brother and sister. Both developed early symptoms of Friedreich's ataxia, a disease which was thought to run in families. This raised questions as to the wisdom of his serving overseas with the Baptist Missionary Society. As an interim measure in October 1925 he took up a place at Mansfield College, Oxford. Here he studied Sanskrit and wrote a thesis on the Saka movement in Hinduism, for which he was awarded in 1927 the degree of bachelor of letters. He was granted a scholarship by Mansfield College which enabled him to spend a semester at Marburg University. On his return to England in March 1928 he decided to seek settlement as a Baptist minister.<br>
<br>On 23 October 1928 Payne was ordained to the ministry and inducted to the pastorate of Bugbrooke Baptist Church in Northamptonshire. Here he met and married, on 28 October 1930, Freda Davies (1905&#150;1997). In 1932 he accepted an invitation to join the staff of the Baptist Missionary Society and in 1936 he became its editorial secretary. During his tenure of this office he developed his considerable talent for writing, including for the <span class="italic">Baptist Quarterly</span>, the journal of the Baptist Historical Society to which he contributed ultimately more than seventy articles. Late in 1939 he was invited to join the staff of Regent's Park College. The college had, in 1927, moved to Oxford, and since 1933 Ernest Payne had been acting as secretary to the college council. So in June 1940 he moved to Oxford, where he stayed for eleven years. At the college he taught Christian doctrine, comparative religion, and church history, becoming an acknowledged expert on the Anabaptists. For six years he was university lecturer in comparative religion and history of modern mission. He was a popular tutor, enjoying the stimulus of teaching and discussion. He produced three significant books: <span class="italic">The Church Awakes</span> (1942), which is an outline history of the modern missionary movement, <span class="italic">The Free Church Tradition in the Life of England</span> (1944), and <span class="italic">The Fellowship of Believers: Baptist Thought and Practice Yesterday and Today</span> (1952). He became involved in the World Council of Churches, attending in 1948, as a Baptist Union delegate, the inaugural assembly of the World Council of Churches in Amsterdam.<br>
<br>In 1950 Payne was invited to succeed M. E. Aubrey as general secretary of the Baptist Union of Great Britain and Ireland. He left Oxford reluctantly. When he was asked by his students if they could congratulate him on his move his reply was typical &#145;You may not congratulate me, but you may wish me well&#146;. From 1951 to 1967 he led the Baptist Union. It was a period of reconstruction. He continued and developed the policies of his predecessor in the reconstruction of bombed church buildings. He encouraged the development of new churches, particularly through special grants for initial pastorates in new areas of building development. He helped to enlarge the union's finances and brought into action a new Home Work Fund Scheme for support of ministers in smaller churches. He called the denomination to celebrate the ter-jubilee of the union in 1962, which included the raising of a &pound;300,000 Ter-Jubilee Fund. In preparation for these celebrations he wrote <span class="italic">The Baptist Union: a Short History</span> (1959), which in spite of its title was a significant and substantial contribution to Baptist history.<br>
<br>Payne's Baptist interests were worldwide: he served the Baptist World Alliance as a vice-president; he helped to develop European federation; ecumenically he served the Free Church Federal Council, being its moderator in 1958&#150;9. He was involved in the British Council of Churches from its inception in 1942, holding office from 1962 to 1971 as chairman of its executive committee, and finally as its honorary president.<br>
<br>For twenty-seven years Payne shared in the work of the World Council of Churches. He was a member of the faith and order commission from 1947 to 1962. He was elected to the central committee of the world council in 1954 and immediately to its vice-chairmanship. His contributions to its deliberations were considerable, most particularly because of his negotiating skills in difficult situations and his drafting ability in preparing complex resolutions on divisive issues. He believed in pragmatism, but never adopted it as a principle. He was elected a president of the world council on his resignation from the central committee in 1968 and held that office until he retired from the council itself in 1975.<br>
<br>When he retired in 1967 Payne was elected to honorary membership of the Baptist Union council, and in 1977 he was president of the Baptist Union. His retirement years were spent at Pitsford, in Northamptonshire, and then back in Oxford. In the new year's honours list of 1968 he was made a Companion of Honour to mark his services not only to Baptists but also to the wider Christian church. Payne died suddenly at the Bonnington Hotel in Southampton Row, London, of heart failure on 14 January 1980; he was cremated in Oxford on 21 January and his ashes were interred in Bugbrooke parish church.<br>
<br>Ernest Payne was small in stature and somewhat shy in disposition. He never sought office, but accepted it when it came. He had an incisive mind and balanced judgement. Ecumenically, he was acknowledged as a leader of outstanding quality. On the initiative of the dean of Westminster a thanksgiving service for him was held in Westminster Abbey. On 27 February 1980 the abbey was filled to capacity by a congregation which was representative of the world church. All had come to honour the memory of one who was a faithful Baptist, a profound ecumenist, a learned scholar, and a humble man.<br>
