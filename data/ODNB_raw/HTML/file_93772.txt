<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Murray,  Lionel <span class="st"> [Len]</span></span>, Baron Murray of Epping Forest  (1922&#150;2004), <span class="occ">trade unionist</span>, was born on 2 August 1922 in Hadley (possibly at 3 Gladstone Street), Shropshire, of unknown parentage. On his marriage certificate Murray identified his father as Peter Allan Murray, a local farm labourer; however, on his application to New College, Oxford (1944), he gave his father's name as Ernest J. Potter and his occupation as schoolmaster. He knew his mother&#151;albeit he was always careful to deflect any reference to her except to closest friends. She died when he was eight years old.<br>
<br>From infancy Murray was fostered and brought up by a local district nurse, a friend of his mother, who had known him from birth and who became his guardian. In later years he would describe her&#151;again only to close friends&#151;as &#145;auntie&#146;, though she was not related. He had distant cousins who were farm workers in the Hadley area and whom he occasionally visited as a child but as he grew older the contact was not maintained. It was &#145;auntie&#146; who tutored Murray from an early age, instilled in him a love of literature and poetry, and steered him at the age of eleven into the grammar school in Wellington, Shropshire. There he prospered under the sympathetic influence of a headmaster, H. Cloke, who guided him to his first university place&#151;at Queen Mary College, London&#151;and with whom he maintained a long friendship. Murray's was, therefore, a hard childhood with little natural warmth&#151;not unlike that of such earlier Labour leaders as Keir Hardie, Ernest Bevin, and Ramsay MacDonald. They, similarly, came from illegitimate births and extremely poor backgrounds and they, like Murray, carried with them a certain inner loneliness diligently protected behind the carapace of privacy. In Murray's case it was reflected in a certain hesitancy and even lack of self-confidence. His public persona was frequently presented with some inner pain.<br>
<br>There were two critical turning points in Murray's life after Wellington grammar school and his brief time at Queen Mary College, where, between October 1941 and June 1942, he studied English. The first of these was his experience of war, through which, as with so many of his generation, he grew quickly to manhood. Murray served with a regiment of his choice, the King's Shropshire light infantry, and after very tough training in the Scottish highlands he was landed on the Normandy beaches on D-day (6 June 1944). He survived the initial carnage but six days later he came under severe fire and was badly wounded. Later he described how he woke up in a London hospital trying to remember what had happened. Some years later a local bank manager told one of Murray's Trades Union Congress (TUC) colleagues how Lieutenant Murray had pulled him from a blazing tank and saved his life&#151;shortly before Murray himself was wounded. Back in England he slowly recovered from the wounds before being invalided out of the army, whereupon he decided not to return to London University but rather to try his hand at teaching. This was not a success and he returned to the midlands, taking a job as a storekeeper in a Wolverhampton engineering firm. There he joined a trade union, became actively involved on the shop floor, joined the Communist Party, and sold the party's daily newspaper, the <span class="italic">Daily Worker</span>, on Wolverhampton street corners. His spell as a communist was only brief and he then joined the local Labour Party. While attending hospital for residual problems with his wounds he met a nurse, Heather, the daughter of William Almond Woolf, duty clerk. This was the second important turning point in Murray's early life. The couple married on 22 September 1945. His marriage was a transforming influence in every respect and gave Murray, for the first time, a sense of emotional security within a family of his own. The couple had two sons and two daughters, and Heather remained the most powerful influence in his life.<br>
<br>Murray, who was always a voracious reader, decided to take up the ex-serviceman's opportunity to study at Oxford University and was admitted to New College to read philosophy, politics, and economics. His talent was quickly recognized, notably by a former fellow of the college, Richard Crossman, who was about to become Labour MP for Coventry East in the 1945 general election, and who during the 1930s had tutored another brilliant young working-class student, George Woodcock, before Woodcock went on to join the TUC. Murray's name was mentioned to Woodcock by Crossman and when, in 1947, a job fell vacant in the TUC's economic department, Murray&#151;armed with a good degree and Crossman's nod&#151;applied and was appointed to the TUC staff by Woodcock, then head of its economic department. Thereafter Murray remained a prot&eacute;g&eacute; of Woodcock, who was another powerful influence on his career. In joining the TUC at that time Murray was fortunate not only to have Woodcock's guidance but to be schooled during the most demanding period of the post-war social revolution, during which the Attlee government nationalized key sectors of British industry and introduced the National Health Service, along with widespread social welfare and industrial reform measures. It was also a period of considerable industrial tension, chiefly on account of a policy of wage restraint necessitated by Britain's precarious balance of payments. All this imposed enormous strain on relations between government, trade unions, and employers and led to frequent personal and ideological divisions within the trade union movement. Murray found himself in the midst of these as the TUC struggled to contain union rivalries while co-operating with the Attlee government.<br>
<br>In 1954 Murray became head of the TUC's economic department. He remained in this role for fifteen years, during which time there was a marked growth in the strength and influence of the trade unions and the TUC as an institution. Murray's early years as head of the economic department saw the creation of the National Economic Development Council (NEDC), which brought together the TUC (including Murray), government ministers, and employers to discuss national economic policy. In 1969 Murray became deputy general secretary of the TUC on the appointment of Vic Feather to succeed Woodcock as general secretary and in September 1973 he was elected unopposed as Feather's successor.<br>
<br>Murray took charge of the TUC at the beginning of a period of economic and industrial crisis that eventually led to the fall of Edward Heath's Conservative government (in February 1974) and would come to be seen as an important watershed in relations between government and the trade unions. Heath had plans to reform industrial relations in the face of massive trade union opposition and this put Murray and the TUC under constant pressure to adopt militant counter measures. Relations deteriorated with the Middle East oil crisis that led to a quadrupling of oil prices and precipitated the mineworkers' wage dispute in late 1973. Negotiations took place directly between Heath's government and the mineworkers' leaders, with the TUC on the fringe. But Murray was constantly involved, even if at arm's length. He handled that situation with a maturity that surprised his friends as well as his critics&#151;most notably at a meeting of the NEDC in January 1974 when the miners' crisis was at its peak. Murray sought to break the deadlock by offering a TUC pledge that if the government accepted the miners' pay claim as &#145;a special and exceptional case&#146; he would use TUC influence to curb other unions from immediately demanding similar rises. It was a brave and remarkable&#151;if tentative&#151;offer that the Heath government rejected. None the less it produced widespread regard for Murray's stature as TUC leader.<br>
<br>Murray's later years as general secretary can be divided into two very different phases. During the first, between February 1974 and May 1979, he sought to bring the trade unions into a new relationship with the Labour governments of Harold Wilson and James Callaghan. The TUC and its affiliated unions played a vital role in sustaining a government with a very slender and disappearing parliamentary majority. In this task Murray was fortunate to have the support of two exceptional union leaders, Jack Jones of the Transport and General Workers' Union and Hugh Scanlon of the Amalgamated Union of Engineering Workers. Together they formed the essential partnership that helped introduce Labour's &#145;social contract&#146;&#151;a framework for relations between unions and the government&#151;then held it together with surprising success for most of the period. This was also a time of immense personal pressure and in 1976, as the social contract began to operate, Murray suffered a mild heart attack. However, he quickly returned to play a vital role in bringing trade union leaders into regular contact with Labour ministers to debate not just wages policy but also wider questions of social and economic affairs. Murray saw this as a development in modern trade unionism, albeit one that often led to serious tensions between union leaders and members in a climate of wage restraint. For him it was an important opportunity to bring the TUC into dialogue and partnership with government, which, he believed, held out the promise of a more mature democratic relationship. This was dramatically changed by the worsening industrial relations of the &#145;winter of discontent&#146; (1978&#150;9) in which Murray sought to act as a moderator, and then in May 1979 by the election of Margaret Thatcher as Conservative prime minister. <br>
<br>The change of government marked the second significant phase of Murray's term as TUC general secretary. In later years he confessed that he had underestimated Thatcher's determination to transform the entire canvas of government&#150;trade union relations. Along with other senior union leaders he believed Thatcher would ultimately respond to reasoned argument and compromise. As he admitted with profound candour, and regret: &#145;I seriously underestimated that lady &hellip; I was simply astonished that Thatcher declined to change direction despite industrial conflict and ever more appalling economic conditions&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Independent</span>, 22 May 2004).<br>
<br>The critical years were from 1980 to 1984 when the Thatcher government began the process of reforming industrial relations with legislation to limit the powers and activities of trade unions, notably by curbing strike action and secondary picketing. The <span class="roman">Employment Acts</span> of 1980 and 1982 set the scene for the conflict, and in May 1980 the TUC agreed to organize a &#145;day of action&#146; when all affiliated unions called for a one-day national strike in protest against the government's policies. Murray wished to avoid such a demonstration but had little option. There followed eighteen months of disputes in which the TUC was directly involved in seeking to avoid wider confrontation. Murray personally helped to resolve a major rail dispute in July 1982, though the settlement made the unions increasingly cautious of involving the TUC in future disputes. At the same time he was engaged in broadening representation on the TUC general council by providing for a wider and more democratic platform to include smaller white-collar unions, which were now emerging with different agendas and ambitions from the older industrial manual unions. It was Murray's hope that this strategy would help find a way towards a compromise between Margaret Thatcher and the unions, in which the unions accepted the government, and were prepared to work with it in return for the government's acceptance of the unions' role in, and contribution to, economic and industrial life. He described his approach as &#145;new realism&#146; and as one that was essential following the Conservatives' second and overwhelming general election victory of June 1983. In September he put his formula to the TUC conference and fought with great courage to win his case in the face of severe opposition, especially from unions already feeling the backlash of government legislation. Ultimately he was unsuccessful, though the outcome might have been different but for two unexpected industrial disputes&#151;the printworkers' confrontation with Eddy Shah and the Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) affair at Cheltenham. Shah, a provincial newspaper proprietor from the north-west, employed the government's new legislation against the powerful print union, the National Graphical Association (NGA), on grounds of unlawful picketing at his Warrington print works. The union called for TUC support, which threw Murray into a dilemma. The general council voted to support the NGA, but only within the law. A TUC committee on employment policy then voted to back a one-day print strike in defiance of the law. Murray summoned a special meeting of the TUC leaders, who reversed that strike decision&#151;for which he won a 29&#150;21 vote of confidence from the full general council. Yet his authority was badly undermined when the prime minister, of all people, publicly praised Murray's courage. It was a bouquet that brought him close to resignation at Christmas 1983. The final blow came in February 1984 when Thatcher announced that trade unionism would be banned for the 7000 civil servants who worked at GCHQ in Cheltenham. Murray protested to Downing Street, but his plea was dismissed by the prime minister despite a powerful attempt by the cabinet secretary to seek a compromise. It was a severe blow for Murray, who, still three and a half years away from scheduled retirement, announced his resignation on 1 May 1984. His struggle to find a <i>modus operandi</i> between Thatcherism and trade unionism lay in ruins&#151;and, arguably, trade union effectiveness never regained its former status. Murray's retirement came two months after the start of the bitter year-long miners' strike, which the TUC could neither avert nor affect as a mediator. In fact the leader of the National Union of Mineworkers, Arthur Scargill, contemptuously refused to give Murray his private telephone number. He bade farewell to the TUC at the congress in September 1984, when he was succeeded as general secretary by Norman Willis.<br>
<br>In 1985 Murray was made a Labour life peer. Although he spoke occasionally he rarely played a prominent role in the House of Lords, where he was a strong advocate of the chamber's reform. In retirement he preferred to maintain his privacy, though both he and his wife continued to dedicate much of their time to a range of church and charitable affairs. After his brief spell in the Communist Party he was an active Methodist and lay preacher. He had been appointed OBE in 1966, was elected an honorary fellow of New College, Oxford, in 1975, and was sworn of the privy council in the following year. He was a governor of the National Institute of Economic and Social Research and the London School of Economics, a member of the Social Science Research Council, and a visiting fellow of Nuffield College, Oxford, and served several terms as a trustee of the Anglo-German Foundation for the Study of Industrial Society. He was also involved in numerous international trade union bodies. He died on 20 May 2004 at Whipps Cross University Hospital, Leytonstone, from pneumonia and heart disease. He was survived by his wife and their four children.<br>
