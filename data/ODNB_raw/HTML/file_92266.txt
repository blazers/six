<span class="headword">Schapera,  Isaac</span>  (1905&#150;2003), <span class="occ">ethnographer and social anthropologist</span>, was born in Garies, Namaqualand, Cape Colony, on 23 June 1905, the youngest of five children of Herman Schapera and his wife, Rosa, Jewish immigrants from White Russia. His mother died in 1918. His father, who began as a pedlar and became a small shopkeeper, went bankrupt in 1924, and in 1925 committed suicide.<br>
<br>Schapera left home at the age of fifteen, when his father remarried, and moved into a boarding house. (For the rest of his life he was to live alone in furnished rooms.) He graduated from the South African College School and entered the University of Cape Town in 1921. There he was drawn into social anthropology by Alfred Reginald Radcliffe-Brown, who held the first established chair in the subject anywhere in the British empire. Radcliffe-Brown introduced his students to a Durkheimian view of social systems, but Schapera was more impressed by his insistence that South Africa was becoming a single society, and that segregation was impossible. He went to the London School of Economics to study for a doctorate in 1925, just a month after his father's suicide. His thesis synthesized what was known about the Bushmen and Hottentot peoples of southern Africa, for whom he adopted the umbrella term Khoisan. Published in 1930, this study remained the standard reference work for a generation. He was greatly influenced by Bronislaw Malinowski, the dominant figure in social anthropology at the LSE, and would remark that, in contrast to Radcliffe-Brown, Malinowski always made his students think. He kept thinking for many years about Malinowski's ideas, but his feelings about him were decidedly ambivalent.<br>
<br>Soon after his return to South Africa in 1929 Schapera began to do research among the Kgatla, a Tswana tribe in the Bechuanaland protectorate. His fieldwork took the form mainly of interviews with experts (including rain doctors, chiefs, and elders), while literate assistants conducted more routine interviews and collected texts and census and genealogical data. Between 1929 and 1934 he made annual visits to Mochudi, the Kgatla capital, usually in university vacations, spending just over fourteen months in the field over this period of five years. In 1930 he was appointed to a lectureship at the University of Cape Town, and was promoted to the chair of social anthropology in 1935. He was a conscientious but not inspiring teacher and department head. He was more active in broader academic circles, particularly in the national network of African studies. During this period he edited two survey volumes, <span class="italic">Western Civilization and the Natives of South Africa: Studies in Culture Contact</span> (1934), and <span class="italic">The Bantu-Speaking Tribes of South Africa: an Ethnographical Survey</span> (1937).<br>
<br>In 1934 Schapera began studies on behalf of the Bechuanaland administration. His first commission was to produce a compilation of Tswana law. His <span class="italic">Handbook of Tswana Law and Custom</span> (1938) was designed to represent the laws that were in force at the time. Schapera insisted on the emergence of a modern Tswana law, fed by traditional principles but also by tribal and governmental legislation, and responsive to social changes in Tswana society. His two other major commissions concerned labour migration and issues relating to land tenure. In 1940 he published another and very different study of social change, his one attempt to reach a broader audience. <span class="italic">Married Life in an African Tribe</span> described courtship, love affairs, and sexual practices, including masturbation and homosexuality, and documented in remarkable detail the day-to-day life of married people. He also made pioneering statistical and demographic studies. He described the pattern of cousin marriage among the Tswana, relating it to the class structure and documenting changes over four generations. He published his monograph <span class="italic">The Ethnic Composition of Tswana Tribes</span> in 1952.<br>
<br>By the late 1940s Schapera's fieldwork days were over, and in 1950 he moved from the University of Cape Town to a chair at the London School of Economics. He continued to teach and to write about South Africa and published comparative essays on the traditional political systems of the region. He also edited important historical sources, notably <span class="italic">Praise Poems of Tswana Chiefs</span> (1965) and five volumes of David Livingstone's letters and journals. He took early retirement from the LSE in 1969, bored with teaching (never his forte) and unsympathetic to the student insurgency of the time.<br>
<br>Orderly and ascetic, lonely, and liable to depression, Schapera never married, and had no significant love affair. He was elected a fellow of the British Academy in 1958 and dutifully undertook official functions in professional bodies, including as president of the Royal Anthropological Institute (1961&#150;3), but after his retirement he withdrew within a small circle of loyal friends, although he enjoyed gossiping about anthropologists, kept up with new research on South Africa, and read widely. Frail but in good health to the end, he died from a heart attack, apparently while cooking himself breakfast, on 26 June 2003; he was declared dead at University College Hospital, Camden.<br>
<br>Schapera's publications on the Tswana represent the most complete single-handed ethnography of an African people. They provide the baseline for modern studies of Botswana, and are valued by the educated people in the country. He tended to be dismissive of anthropological theories, preferring to describe himself as an ethnographer, a role which he thought of as very like that of an economic or social historian.<br>
