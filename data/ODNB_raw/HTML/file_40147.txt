<span class="headword">Odell,  Noel Ewart</span>  (1890&#150;1987), <span class="occ">geologist and mountaineer</span>, was born on 25 December 1890 in St Lawrence, Isle of Wight, the third child in the family of two sons and three daughters of the Revd Robert William Odell, rector of St Lawrence, and his wife, Mary Margaret, daughter of James Bell Ewart, timber merchant, of Dundas, Ontario, Canada. He was educated at Brighton College and at the Royal School of Mines at Imperial College, London, where he studied geology and gained the ARSM. During the First World War he was commissioned as a lieutenant in 1915 in the Royal Engineers. Wounded three times, he returned to civilian life in 1919, having, in 1917, married Gwladys Mona (<i>d</i>. 1977), daughter of Robert Jones, rector of Gyffin, north Wales. They had one son.<br>
<br>Odell embarked on a career in the petroleum and mining industries, first as a geologist with the Anglo-Persian Oil Company (1922&#150;5) and then as a consultant in Canada (1927&#150;30). In his late thirties he transferred to academic geology, first as a lecturer in geology and tutor at Harvard University (1928&#150;30), then as a research student and lecturer at Cambridge, where he stayed on as a fellow commoner and supervisor of studies at Clare College (1931&#150;40). His research for the degree of PhD, awarded in 1940, investigated the geology, glaciology, and geomorphology of north-east Greenland and northern Labrador. In 1940&#150;42 he served as a major in the Bengal Sappers and Miners.<br>
<br>After the Second World War he took up various appointments at universities in Canada, New Zealand, and Pakistan. He lectured at McGill and was visiting professor at the University of British Columbia (1948&#150;9). He was also professor of geology at the University of Otago (1950&#150;56) and at Peshawar University (1960&#150;62). On finally retiring he returned to Clare and in 1983, at the age of ninety-two, was made an honorary fellow, an event which much pleased him.<br>
<br>Although Odell published several important papers on the geology of the Himalayas, and other mountain regions, and was a fellow or member of numerous geological, geographical, glaciological, and Arctic institutions, he probably never aspired to be in the front rank of academic research. It was in mountaineering that he made his name, and managed with singular success to combine the career of a geologist with the pleasures of mountaineering. Odell made his first discovery of the hills of the Lake District at the age of thirteen and soon acquired wide climbing experience in Britain and the Alps. Many an aspiring rock climber has cut his teeth on Odell's severe tennis shoe climb on the uncompromisingly smooth slabs of Cwm Idwal in north Wales (1919). He participated in the Oxford University Spitsbergen expedition (1921) and led the Merton College Arctic expedition (1923).<br>
<br>Odell was picked for the Everest expedition of 1924 and was the last man to see George Mallory and Andrew Irvine before they disappeared in their attempt to scale the final slopes of the world's highest mountain. Odell was in close support. In a period of four days he climbed mostly without oxygen, first alone to 25,000 feet to look for them, and then twice alone beyond Camp 6 to over 27,000 feet and back. On returning home he was invited to a private audience by George V. Odell was undoubtedly most widely known for his account of the last sighting of Mallory and Irvine which contributed to the enduring mystery of whether they ever reached the summit of Everest. The sensational discovery of Mallory's body by a special research expedition on 1 May 1999 on the slopes where he had fallen at 26,770 ft has renewed speculation but still not solved the mystery.<br>
<br>There followed several visits for geological research, mountaineering, and exploration in the Canadian Rockies (1927&#150;47) and with American friends to north Labrador (1931), north-east Greenland (1933), and the St Elias Mountains in Yukon and Alaska (1949 and 1977). While at Harvard he inspired a generation of undergraduates to climb steep ice and to organize expeditions to the greater ranges of the world. An ice route he pioneered in the White Mountains bears his name, Odell Gully, and two mountains, a lake, and a glacier are also named after him.<br>
<br>Odell's greatest mountaineering achievement was the first ascent of Nanda Devi (25,695 feet) in 1936, with an Anglo-American party. H. W. Tilman and Odell reached the summit, which for fourteen years remained the highest peak climbed. Two years later he again joined Tilman in the 1938 attempt on Everest, but deep powder snow made the last 1500 feet impossible to climb. Odell continued to defy the normal limitations of old age. In 1984, at the age of ninety-three, he strode across the glacier to attend the seventy-fifth anniversary of the Britannia hut in the Alps, and recalled that as a young climber he had also been present at its opening. He was a founder member of the Himalayan Club and an honorary member of the Alpine Club and of kindred clubs in North America, Canada, South Africa, New Zealand, Switzerland, and Norway. He received the Livingstone gold medal (1944) of the Royal Scottish Geographical Society and, unusually, a star in the constellation Lyra was named after him (<span class="italic">International Star Register</span>, 1925). He became a familiar figure at the Alpine Club and the Royal Geographical Society, retaining in old age his earnest enthusiasm and the tall, spare figure and purposeful gait which had carried him to record heights on the earth's surface. His genial nature and patriarchal figure earned him the nickname Noah, which he relished. Odell died suddenly on 21 February 1987 at his home, 5 Dean Court, Holbrook Road, Cambridge, and his body was donated to medical science at the Cambridge anatomy department.<br>
