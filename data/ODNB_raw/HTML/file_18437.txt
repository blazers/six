<span class="headword">Maynard, Sir  John</span>  (1592&#150;1658), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was the second son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/67006/', "Sir Henry Maynard (b. after 1547, d. 1610)")</script> of Little Easton, Essex, secretary to Lord Burghley, and Susan (<i>d</i>. in or after 1612), second daughter of Thomas Pierson (or Pearson), gentleman usher of Star Chamber. His elder brother was William, first Lord Maynard (<i>b</i>. in or before 1589, <i>d</i>. 1640). There is no certain record of him attending a university, but it is known that he entered the Inner Temple in 1610.<br>
<br>By 1619 Maynard had come to the notice of the marquess of Buckingham and had become a member of his circle at court. His participation in court masques in January 1619 and January 1620 was noted by John Chamberlain, who commented on the first occasion that &#145;young Maynard &hellip; beares away the bell for dauncing, and were otherwise a very proper man but that he is extreme poreblind&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Letters of John Chamberlain</span>, ed. N. E. McClure, 1939, 200). Maynard reported to Buckingham from the siege of Bergen-op-Zoom in July 1622, and sent him news from the English court when the duke was with the prince of Wales in Spain in 1623. In October that year he was chosen to carry the king's condolences to the French ambassador following the collapse of the chapel at the latter's residence, and in the following November his masque congratulating Prince Charles on his return from Spain was performed at York House. The masque was reported to have offended the Spanish ambassador, in whose presence it took place. A masque of Maynard's was also performed at Burley on the Hill in August 1624.<br>
<br>Maynard served as member for Chippenham, Wiltshire, in the 1624 parliament, and represented the borough again in 1625. In the 1628&#150;9 parliament he sat for Calne in the same county. At the coronation of Charles I Maynard was made knight of the Bath and a servant of the privy chamber. On 25 November 1624 he married Mary (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1680), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/19685/', "Sir Thomas Myddelton (1549x56&#150;1631)")</script> of Stansted Mountfichet, a former mayor of London, through whom he gained significant political contacts in the City. Maynard made his principal home at Tooting in Surrey, but also acquired estates at Isleham in Cambridgeshire and Bradford in Yorkshire.<br>
<br>By 1628 Maynard had become an effective agent and propagandist for Buckingham, working to advance his patron's interests in parliament and the City while defending him against the charge that he favoured Arminianism and popery. One product of this work for Buckingham was a forged letter, widely circulated before parliament sat in 1628, which purported to be written by an English Jesuit to the father rector in Brussels and which identified Buckingham as the Jesuits' most formidable enemy in England. The letter angered Buckingham, however, as did Maynard's speech in parliament attacking the use of foreign mercenaries by the English crown, and it is possible that Maynard was still out of favour when the duke was assassinated in August 1628. His involvement in court affairs was much reduced following the death of his patron, and an incident in 1637, when he attacked John Craven on the bowling green at Whitehall over a debt, and struck Lord Powis when he tried to intervene, cannot have helped his ambitions.<br>
<br>Maynard sided with parliament on the outbreak of civil war. He lent at least &pound;700 to parliament on the propositions in the autumn of 1642, and in November he was appointed a Surrey deputy lieutenant. In the following August he was involved in moves to secure the arrest of MPs close to the earl of Northumberland who were suspected of planning to go over to the king. In the same month he emerged as a leading figure on the committee for the safety of Surrey, a new committee set up by parliament to take over the control of military affairs from the county's deputy lieutenants. Maynard used his influence on this committee to support his kinsman Colonel Samuel Jones, who had been appointed governor of Farnham Castle in August 1643. Between April 1644 and April 1645 Maynard was engaged in a series of disputes with the Surrey politician Sir Richard Onslow and his allies, who sought to reduce the costly Farnham garrison and return the control of the Surrey forces from the committee to the deputy lieutenants. Although Maynard benefited from the support in print of the poet George Wither in his conflicts with Onslow, and from the support of militant parliamentarians in London and the south-east, it was Onslow who won the backing of parliament in April 1645 when a new county committee was established from which Maynard and his supporters were excluded. Maynard continued to serve on the Surrey subcommittee of accounts, which clashed regularly with the county committee, but his involvement in Surrey affairs had ceased by December 1646.<br>
<br>Sir John was elected as MP for Lostwithiel, Cornwall, in January 1647, and quickly became identified as an outspoken opponent of the army and ally of the presbyterian leadership in the Commons. He had, two years before, supported the creation of the New Model Army, but his doubts about the trustworthiness of leading Independents were evident as early as June 1645, when he was suspected of spreading rumours that the earl of Northumberland, Viscount Saye and Sele, Sir Henry Vane, Oliver St John, and Oliver Cromwell were engaged in secret negotiations with the king to end the war and &#145;bring in all manner of religions&#146;  (House of Lords RO, main papers series, 1645, 24 June&#150;9 July, fol. 211). Maynard was an active member of parliament, being appointed to several committees including the indemnity committee and committee for the fens. On the latter committee, before which he had appeared on behalf of fenland inhabitants in June 1646, he soon became known as a vigorous opponent of drainage undertakings. In June 1647 he was one of the eleven members singled out for impeachment by the army. When details of the particular charges were published it was clear that no specific charge could be levelled against Maynard, whose name was included only in the general charges laid against the group as a whole. His hostility towards the army leadership was no doubt the main reason why he was accused with the rest, but at least one commentator suggested that his name was on the list only because he had opposed the fen drainage schemes in which Cromwell was &#145;so deeply engaged&#146;  (W. Prynne, <span class="italic">A Declaration of the Officers and Armies illegall, Injurious Proceedings &amp; Practices Against the XI impeached Members</span>, 1647, 5).<br>
<br>Maynard withdrew from parliament after 26 June 1647, when the Commons granted the eleven members leave of absence. Although reports from London in early July suggested that he was openly accusing the army of being all &#145;rebelles and traytors&#146;  (C. H. Firth, ed., <span class="italic">The Clarke Papers</span>, 1891, 1.150), there is no evidence that he was involved in planning the apprentices' assault on parliament on 26 July. After the speakers and several members of both houses fled to the army following the riots Maynard resumed his seat in the Commons, and by 3 August he was signing warrants as a member of the revived committee of safety. In an intercepted letter he reiterated his earlier claims about the duplicity of Independent politicians, on this occasion accusing Lord Saye and several of his allies in the House of Commons of being the true authors of the army's <span class="italic">Heads of Proposals</span>.<br>
<br>Maynard was, with John Glynn, one of only two of the eleven members to obey the summons to attend the House of Commons following the army's march on London and the return of the speakers and fugitive members. On 7 September 1647 he appeared before the house and, having refused to answer the charges against him, was committed to the Tower. On 28 October articles of impeachment against him were read in the house and assented to. By 3 November he had made contact with his fellow prisoner in the Tower, John Lilburne, who became an important friend and ally. When Maynard was brought before the House of Lords on 5 February 1648 he refused to listen to the charges made against him or to answer them, and was fined &pound;500. His insistence that the Lords had no right to proceed against him drew comparisons in the press with Lilburne, and in the following two months not only Lilburne but his allies John Wildman and John Harris published pamphlets in support of his cause.<br>
<br>Maynard's impeachment was discharged on 3 June 1648 and he was allowed to resume his seat in the Commons. On 27 June he spoke in favour of the City of London petition for an accommodation with the king, and denounced those he called &#145;Royal Independents&#146; and &#145;Royal Presbyterians&#146;, terms which had first appeared in print in February in <span class="italic">The Royall Quarrell</span>, the pamphlet published on his behalf by John Harris. On 1 August his persuasive speech in the Commons in favour of Lilburne helped secure the latter's release from imprisonment.<br>
<br>Sir John supported the treaty of Newport and was secluded from the Commons at Pride's Purge. Although his name does not appear alongside those accused of involvement in presbyterian plots against the new regime, he continued to act with Lilburne in opposing the activities of drainage undertakers in the fens, who in the Great Level included several prominent supporters of the government. In 1649 he argued before the parliamentary committee for the Great Level that the drainage scheme was chiefly the work of courtiers whose disregard for property rights in the 1630s had been a principal cause of civil war. His continuing activities in 1653 against the scheme led to complaints about the interference in these matters of &#145;discontented busy persons&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 25302, fol. 130), and one supporter of the scheme suggested to Secretary Thurloe that &#145;we are in the same danger of him that the State is of Lilburne&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1653&#150;4</i>, 120).<br>
<br>Little is known of Maynard between late 1653 and his death in Tooting on 29 July 1658. He was buried at Tooting; he was survived by his wife and was succeeded by his son John, who was knighted on 7 June 1660 and died on 14 May 1664.<br>
