<span class="headword">Nongqawuse <span class="st"> [Nonquase]</span></span>  (<em>b. </em><em>c.</em>1840, <em>d.</em> in or after 1905), <span class="occ">prophet</span>, was orphaned at an early age, possibly during the 1850&#150;53 Cape Frontier War between the Xhosa and the British, and went to live with her uncle, Mhlakaza, at the Gxarha River in independent Xhosa. Reliable documentation on her life and character is very thin, and although her prophecies and their consequences have been extensively recorded, the details of her motivations and her personal life must remain forever obscure.<br>
<br>In April 1856 Nongqawuse and a younger cousin, Nombanda, went out into the fields to scare the birds away from the standing corn. When they returned home Nongqawuse reported that they had met two strangers who introduced themselves as persons long dead, and, according to the reliable account of W. W. Gqoba, continued as follows:<blockquote>You are to tell the people that the whole community is about to rise again from the dead &hellip; all the cattle living now must be slaughtered, for they are reared with defiled hands as the people handle witchcraft. Say to them that there must be no ploughing of lands, rather must the people dig deep pits (granaries), erect new huts, set up wide, strongly built cattlefolds. (Peires, 79)</blockquote>These prophecies were accepted by Nongqawuse's uncle Mhlakaza, a Christian convert who had been dismissed by his former employer, an Anglican clergyman, on account of his increasingly visionary religious experiences. Such prophecies were not entirely new. They had multiplied in the climate of despair which had been generated by continual Xhosa military defeats, and they had lately been boosted by exaggerated reports of Russian successes against the British in the Crimea. The notion that existing cattle had somehow become contaminated was a reaction to the recent outbreak of lung sickness, a hitherto unknown and deadly cattle disease newly arrived from Europe. Enquirers who visited Nongqawuse's place were shown black shapes bobbing up and down in the misty sea and told that these were the dead, waiting to rise as soon as all the cattle had been slaughtered. On other occasions Nongqawuse entered a particular bush, and conversed with spirits audible only to herself.<br>
<br>A turning point was reached in July 1856 when Sarhili, king of all the Xhosa, visited Nongqawuse and became convinced of the truth of her prophecies. He ordered his subjects to kill all their cattle and destroy their entire stock of corn. Disappointment followed disappointment as the dead failed to rise, but the movement was kept going by the desperation of the committed believers, who had slaughtered all their cattle and could no longer retreat from the path they had chosen. The fact that many Xhosa remained sceptical and refused to kill their cattle only incensed the believers and provided an excuse for the continued non-fulfilment of the prophecies. The situation was further exacerbated by the actions of Governor Sir George Grey, who took advantage of the catastrophe to break the power of the Xhosa chiefs and to free their land for colonial settlement.<br>
<br>The relationship between the two figures at the centre of the prophecies, Nongqawuse and Mhlakaza, remains unclear, but it would seem that Nongqawuse alone had visions which were subsequently interpreted by Mhlakaza. The only contemporary description of Nongqawuse, provided by a colonial spy, depicts her as &#145;a girl of about 16 years of age, has a silly look, and appeared to me as if she was not right in her mind&#146;  (Peires, 87). As the movement approached its climax, Nongqawuse seems to have become increasingly unable to cope with the consequences of her prophecies; she became sick, and her role as prophetess was taken over by her cousin Nombanda.<br>
<br>The prophecies peaked with the &#145;great disappointment&#146; of February 1857 but the flames of despair kept it going until June 1857, when all hope was finally extinguished. By that time, more than 400,000 cattle had been killed and approximately 40,000 Xhosa had starved to death. Among these was Mhlakaza. Nongqawuse herself did not die, but fled across the Mbashe River into Bomvanaland. In March 1858 the chief of the Bomvana handed her over to Major John Gawler, a British magistrate responsible for implementing the policies of Governor Grey. Grey had set up a military tribunal with the purpose of convicting the Xhosa chiefs of levying war against the British crown. Gawler was charged with the task of preparing Nongqawuse as a witness in this dubious case. He brought her to King William's Town, dressed her up, and had her photograph taken, but he was unable to get a coherent statement out of her, and the fragments that survive have clearly been doctored by colonial officials.<br>
<br>Nongqawuse and another prophet were taken by Major Gawler to Cape Town in October 1858, for purposes unknown. The two women were accommodated with other female Xhosa prisoners in the Paupers' Lodge, but after that Nongqawuse disappears from the official records. A colonial administrator mentioned in a passing reminiscence that she had married, and that she was living with her husband in the Alexandria district as late as 1905. Her reputed grave is located on the farm Glenthorn, and there is a plaque erected by local residents. But her journey to Alexandria and the exact nature of her relationship with the colonial officials remain, like so many other aspects of her life, a complete mystery.<br>
