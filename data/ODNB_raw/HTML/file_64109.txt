<span class="headword">Aubrey, Sir  John</span>, sixth baronet  (1739&#150;1826), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born on 4 June 1739 at Boarstall, Buckinghamshire, where he was baptized on 2 July 1739, the eldest of the three sons and one daughter of Sir Thomas Aubrey, fifth baronet (1707/8&#150;1786), landowner, of Boarstall and Llantriddyd, Glamorgan, and his wife, Martha (1713&#150;1788), the daughter of Richard Carter of Chilton, Buckinghamshire, a Welsh judge. Having been educated at Westminster School (1752&#150;8) he went to Christ Church, Oxford (1758&#150;62), and received the DCL in 1763. From 1764 to 1765 he undertook a grand tour of France and Italy, and in Paris he met, and soon deserted, Cornelia (afterwards De Vasse), the mother of his illegitimate daughter Mary (<i>c</i>.1765&#150;1843), whom he eventually brought home and endowed generously. Aubrey married first, on 9 March 1771, Mary (1750&#150;1781), the daughter and coheir of Sir James Colebrooke, first baronet, a banker, of Gatton, Surrey, and his wife, Mary Skinner, of Leyton and Walthamstow, Essex; their only son, John (1771&#150;1777), died accidentally from poisoned food. His second marriage, on 26 May 1783, to his first cousin and ward, Martha Catherine (1764&#150;1815), the daughter and coheir of George Richard Carter of Chilton, was childless. He commemorated the &#145;rare excellence&#146; of both wives in Boarstall church, which he rebuilt in 1818.<br>
<br>Aubrey's parliamentary career spanned fifty-eight years. He first entered parliament on Lord Abingdon's interest as MP for Wallingford in 1768. Friendly to Chatham and Shelburne when elected, he was opposed to the Grafton and North administrations. His maiden speech, on 17 March 1769, was in defence of the radical John Wilkes. He spoke in favour of curtailing parliamentary privilege, on 15 April of that year, and backed the perpetuation of the Grenville reform act on 25 February 1774. It was at this time that he purchased Dorton, which became his Buckinghamshire home after 1777, when he demolished Boarstall. To Lord Abingdon's vexation, he avoided candidature for the county in 1774 and instead successfully contested Aylesbury. A persistent critic of government policy in North America, he called on North to resign in Chatham's favour on 17 March 1778. He also championed Irish legislative independence at debate on 18 December 1779. In 1780 he resumed sitting for Wallingford, and on 6 May 1782 he supported Edmund Burke's attack on sinecures. Aubrey served under Shelburne as a lord of the Admiralty, from July 1782 to April 1783, and Pitt seated him at the Treasury board in December 1783. He was returned after an expensive contest for Buckinghamshire in 1784, but he was often ill in the ensuing parliament. On 18 April 1785 he backed Pitt on parliamentary reform. After speaking in favour of the opposition's proposal for a regency during the king's illness he ceased to be summoned to the Treasury board, and so abandoned it on 3 March 1789. In October 1789 he renounced the county seat and threatened to quit the county altogether and retreat to his ancestral Welsh estate.<br>
<br>In 1790 Aubrey returned to parliament as MP for Clitheroe, where his patron Thomas Lister was a Portland whig. While he voted with the opposition, he maintained an obstinate silence in debate. He became a member of the Whig Club on 7 June 1791 and joined Charles James Fox's followers, with whom he voted from December 1792. The opposition whigs found him, in 1796, a seat at Aldeburgh on the Crespigny interest, which he retained unopposed for sixteen years. However, he seceded from the Commons with Fox in May 1797 and returned only occasionally for particular votes until 1801, when he resumed regular opposition with his leader. On Fox's elevation to office in 1806 Aubrey requested a peerage but was told to wait. The fall of Grenville's ministry in April 1807 dashed his hopes, but he continued to act with the whig opposition, though ill health affected his attendance from 1808. Expected to retire in 1812, he came in again, for the duke of Norfolk's borough of Steyning, and resumed fitful attendance. In the 1818 parliament, where he again sat for Steyning, he supported the call for George Tierney to lead the opposition. In 1820 Norfolk returned him for Horsham. Aubrey died &#145;father of the house&#146; at Dorton on 1 March 1826 and was buried at Boarstall on 11 March. A nephew, the last baronet, succeeded to Boarstall, and his unentailed estates were bequeathed to other relatives.<br>
