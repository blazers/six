<span class="headword">Sedding,  Edmund</span>  (1836&#150;1868), <span class="occ">architect and musician</span>, was born on 20 June 1836, the son of Richard and Peninnah Sedding of Summerstown, near Okehampton, Devon. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25004/', "John Dando Sedding (1838&#150;1891)")</script> was his younger brother. At an early age he displayed antiquarian tastes, which led to his visiting cathedrals, abbeys, and churches in England and France. In 1853 he entered the office of George Edmund Street, where he devoted himself to the study of Gothic architecture. For some time he resided as an architect in Bristol, and, after again spending a period in London, moved about 1862 to practise in Penzance. He married, on 18 August 1862, Jessie, daughter of John Proctor, chemist, of Penzance; they had four children, one of whom, Edmund Harold (1863&#150;1921), was articled to J. D. Sedding and set up an independent practice in Plymouth in 1891. In Cornwall, Sedding rebuilt or restored the churches of Gwithian, Wendron, Altarnun, North Hill, Ruan, St Peter, Newlyn, and St Stephen by Launceston, while he had in progress at the time of his death a new church at Low Marple, Cheshire, a rectory, and two churches in Wales, the restoration of Bigbury church, Devon, and a mansion at Hayle, Cornwall, for W. J. Rawlings.<br>
<br>Sedding was a performer on the harmonium and organ, and an admirer of ancient church music. He was closely involved with two leading ritualistic churches, being for a time cantor of the church of St Raphael, Bristol, and organist of St Mary the Virgin, Soho. He greatly exerted himself in the revival of carol singing, and his books of Christmas carols were very popular. His chief musical compositions included: <span class="italic">A Collection of Nine Ancient Christmas Carols for Four Voices</span> (1860), which ran to six editions; <span class="italic">Jerusalem the Golden: a Hymn</span> (1861); and <span class="italic">Seven Ancient Carols for Four Voices</span> (1863). To F. G. Lees's revisions of J. Purchas's <span class="italic">Directorium Anglicanum</span> (2nd edn, 1865) he supplied fifteen quarto pages of illustrations. In 1865 Sedding's health failed, and he died at Penzance on 11 June 1868. He was buried in Madron churchyard on 16 June. His wife survived him.<br>
