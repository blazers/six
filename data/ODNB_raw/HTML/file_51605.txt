<span class="headword">Lefroy,  Harold Maxwell</span>  (1877&#150;1925), <span class="occ">entomologist</span>, was born on 20 January 1877 at Itchel House, Crondall, Hampshire, the fourth son of Charles James Maxwell Lefroy, landed proprietor, and his wife, Elizabeth Catherine McClintock. He was educated at Marlborough College and King's College, Cambridge, where he matriculated at Michaelmas 1895. Pursuing his boyhood interest in insects he achieved a first class in the natural sciences tripos, part one, and took his BA in 1898. After less than a year as assistant master of Seaford College, Sussex, Lefroy became the entomologist for the newly created department of agriculture in the West Indies, arriving at Barbados on 24 December 1899. In lectures to sugar planters, in pamphlets, and in articles for the <span class="italic">West Indian Bulletin</span>, he produced detailed accounts of the insect pests of sugar cane, and of thrips that attacked cacao trees. Lefroy's colonial experiences quickly convinced him of the centrality of the applied entomologist and his insecticides as &#145;tools of empire&#146;.<br>
<br>In April 1903 Lefroy arrived in Calcutta to take up an appointment as entomologist to the government of India. He began his career in India working under E. P. Stebbing at the Indian Museum, but soon became connected with the Imperial Agricultural Research Institute at Pusa. The following year he married Kathleen Hamilton O'Meara, daughter of William O'Meara of British Guiana. During the nine years that he spent in India, Lefroy &#145;revolutionized all previous methods of studying the insect pests of agricultural crops&#146;  (Stebbing). In addition to serving on the managing committee of the Bombay Natural History Society, and producing numerous entomological pamphlets and articles, he wrote two major texts. His first, <span class="italic">Indian Insect Pests</span>, appeared in 1906. With the assistance of F. M. Howlett, he followed this three years later with <span class="italic">Indian Insect Life</span>.<br>
<br>In 1912 Lefroy accepted a position as professor of entomology at the Imperial College of Science and Technology in South Kensington; he arrived in England in January 1913. Already a fellow of the Entomological Society (1900) and the Zoological Society (1902), he quickly became an active participant in London's scientific circles. But he openly declared himself an applied scientist. Identifying himself as the representative of colonial economic entomologists he asserted that the naming of insects was best left to metropolitan museum staff who were accustomed to working with dead specimens. He later reiterated this position in his definitive textbook, <span class="italic">Manual of Entomology</span> (1923). Between 1911 and 1914 the British Museum (Natural History) engaged him to deal with economic entomological enquiries, and upon the creation of the Imperial Bureau of Entomology in 1912 he joined the committee of management as the representative for India. In 1913 he became honorary curator of the insect house at the zoological gardens. At about the same time he was asked to deal with an infestation of death watch beetles in the roof timbers of Westminster Hall. Contemporaries consistently remembered Lefroy as a man of boundless energy. One manifestation of this was his driving technique. A friend recalled:<blockquote>He was an ardent and dangerous motorist. It was an experience to be driven by him in a car whose battered wings gave little confidence, as fast as the car could go, through London traffic, in company with a biscuit-box of noxious living insects, a few glass bottles of poisons, and a cylinder of some lethal gas. (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 15 Oct 1925)</blockquote>On 17 April 1914, this motoring passion resulted in a near fatal accident.Although rejected for service in the First World War Lefroy instructed sanitary officials, doctors, and army officers on the dangers of insects as vectors of disease. In the same capacity he served as temporary lieutenant-colonel in the Mesopotamian field force in 1916. And at the behest of the British Wheat Commission he and R. A. Lowe travelled to Australia to vanquish a large infestation of weevils in stored wheat in early 1918. An original member of the Association of Economic Biologists (established in 1904), Lefroy served as honorary secretary in 1914 and as honorary editor of the association's journal, the <span class="italic">Annals of Applied Biology</span>, from 1914 to 1916. His involvement with the association was indicative of his desire for professional recognition. Aware of his roles as both scientist and publicist Lefroy freely used Royal Institution lectures, newspapers, popular magazines, wireless broadcasts, and even cinematograph films to promote his subject. Lefroy's decision to become chair of the panel of applied biology at the College of Pestology was undoubtedly motivated by the same professional and entrepreneurial aspirations.<br>
<br>In the end Lefroy succumbed to the thing that he saw as his greatest tool in the struggle for professional recognition&#151;insecticides. On Saturday 10 October 1925 he was overcome by a gas insecticide of his own invention while working at his laboratory at Imperial College. He rallied for several hours before exposing himself to a final fatal dose. Presciently he admitted, &#145;The little beggars have got the best of me this time&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 17 Oct 1925). Later that day Lefroy was found unconscious on the floor of his laboratory; he never regained consciousness. He was rushed to St George's Hospital, where he died at 6.25 p.m. on 14 October 1925. At an inquest held two days later it was revealed that Lefroy was a victim of &#145;very chronic toxaemia which had been carrying on for a period of six or seven years&#146;  (ibid.). Mourned by his wife and only son, Cecil, Harold Maxwell Lefroy was buried at Kensal Green cemetery, London, on 17 October 1925.<br>
