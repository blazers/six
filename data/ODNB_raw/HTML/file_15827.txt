<span class="headword">Kynnesman,  Arthur</span>  (1682&#150;1770), <span class="occ">schoolmaster</span>, was born in London on Christmas day 1682, the son of Harold Kynnesman, a mercer. He was educated at Christ's Hospital and, with an exhibition from his school, was admitted sizar to Trinity College, Cambridge, on 30 June 1702, whence he graduated BA (1706) and MA (1709). He was ordained deacon on 23 September 1710 and priest on 22 March 1713.<br>
<br>For some time Kynnesman was an usher at Westminster School but in 1715, recommended by Robert Freind, headmaster of Westminster, he was appointed master of the grammar school at Bury St Edmunds. Here he adopted the system of teaching practised at Westminster, expanded the school to some 150 pupils, and secured for it an excellent reputation. The dramatist Richard Cumberland was a pupil and left an affectionate account of his headmaster. Kynnesman was extremely proud of his school and of his pupils' achievements, and he once boasted to his college friend Richard Bentley (Cumberland's grandfather) that he would make Cumberland as good a scholar as his grandfather, to which Bentley replied joshingly, &#145;Pshaw! Arthur, how can that be, when I have forgot more than thou ever knewst?&#146;  (<span class="italic">Memoirs</span>, 24). Kynnesman continued the tradition of performing school plays to audiences of parents and the local gentry, and raised money to buy books for the library by taking a collection after each play. Cumberland described him as &#145;an excellent master, a very sufficient scholar&#146;, who had &#145;all the professional requisites of voice, air and aspect, that marked him out at first sight as a personage decidedly made on purpose&#151;<i>habere imperium in pueros</i>&#146;  (ibid., 23).<br>
<br>Kynnesman resigned as headmaster in 1745 and took up the post of rector of Barnham, Suffolk; for a few months in 1751 he was reader of St James's, Bury, and in 1766 he obtained the living of Eriswell in Suffolk. In 1768 he published his only work, <span class="italic">A Short Introduction to Grammar</span> (2nd edn, 1775). His wife, a former Miss Maddocks of Troston, Suffolk, died in 1766. He himself died on 10 July 1770 at Bury and was buried on 17 July at Barnham, next to his wife.<br>
