<span class="headword">Puckering, Sir  John</span>  (1543/4&#150;1596), <span class="occ">administrator and speaker of the House of Commons</span>, was the eldest son of William Puckering of Flamborough, Yorkshire, and his wife, Anne, daughter of John Ashton of Great Lever Hall, near Bolton, Lancashire. Admitted to Lincoln's Inn on 10 April 1559, he was called to the bar in 1567. On 21 February 1569 he married Jane (<i>d</i>. after 1599), daughter of Nicholas Chowne of Aldenham, Hertfordshire, and Fairlawn, near Wrotham, Kent, and his second wife, Elizabeth Scott. They had a son, <a href="#cosubject_22861">Thomas [<i>see below</i>]</a>, and four daughters.<br>
<br>Under-treasurer of Lincoln's Inn in 1569, Puckering was a governor of the inn by 1575, and in that year became a justice of the peace in Hertfordshire. He was Lent reader of Lincoln's Inn in 1577, and became in the same year a member of the council in the marches of Wales and a justice of the peace in Welsh and border counties. On 7 September 1577 he was appointed justice of the Carmarthen circuit, becoming chief justice when Richard Atkyns was associated with him on 15 September 1578. Puckering retained his London practice, though his letters patent to act by deputy in Wales caused discord with Atkyns. A close ally of Robert Devereux, earl of Essex, in building up Essex's influence in south-west Wales, Puckering was created serjeant-at-law in October 1580. In 1582 he bought the priory of St Sepulchre, Warwick, from Edward Fisher, whose fraud necessitated an act of parliament confirming Puckering's title.<br>
<br>Of the <i>quorum</i> of the commission of the peace in Hertfordshire in 1583, on 19 November 1584 Puckering was returned to parliament for Carmarthen, but chose instead to sit for Bedford, where the government had had him returned on 2 November. The parliament was relatively inexperienced, and as a newcomer Puckering was chosen as speaker. A &#145;very able member of the &hellip; House&#146;  (D'Ewes, 333), he acted as the government's agent, relying upon Burghley for assistance. In the parliament of 1586&#150;7 he was returned for the borough of Gatton, near Reigate, Surrey, and again elected speaker. He had been appointed queen's serjeant-at-law on 3 July 1585, and in 1586 he prosecuted at the trial of Edward Abington and other Babington plot conspirators. In 1587 he resigned his place as counsel to the town of St Albans, and appeared for the crown at the trial of Secretary Davison for his conduct in sending off the death warrant for Mary, queen of Scots. In 1589 came the trials of Philip Howard, earl of Arundel, for treason, and of Sir Richard Knightley and others for sedition. In the following year, in which he became recorder of Warwick, Puckering presided with Mr Baron Clarke over the trial for sedition at the Surrey assizes of the puritan minister John Udall. Puckering's last appearance at a state trial was at the prosecution for treason in 1592 of Sir John Perrott, late lord deputy of Ireland.<br>
<br>On 28 May 1592 Puckering was knighted, sworn of the privy council, and appointed lord keeper of the great seal, succeeding Sir Christopher Hatton since whose death in November 1591 the seal had been in commission. Lacking Hatton's accomplishments, and despite his reputedly extraordinary knowledge of the real actions, Puckering was not an automatic choice for the lord keepership. Almost all his chancery orders date from after Sir Thomas Egerton's appointment as master of the rolls in April 1594, though Puckering launched a broad offensive against lesser equity courts, much in keeping with his hostility towards the earls of Pembroke and Huntingdon, presidents respectively of the councils in Wales and in the north. Never certain of royal favour, Puckering solicited reassurance from the court, and entertained Elizabeth lavishly when she visited him at Kew in Surrey in 1595. Despite such expenditure, and while petitioning the queen for a grant of land in 1595, Puckering complained that as speaker he had lost &pound;2000 from his practice, and that the lord keepership cost him &pound;1000 a year. But like lord keepers Bacon and Egerton, Puckering bought land on a large scale, acquiring the manor of Weston, Hertfordshire, in 1593, and further Warwickshire lands in 1596. It was said that he had abused the lord keeper's ecclesiastical patronage, though Camden assigned the responsibility to his servants. He died intestate of apoplexy on 30 April 1596, aged fifty-two, according to his memorial inscription, leaving &#145;no regret of him&#146;  (BL, Lansdowne MS 982, fol. 194); he was buried in St Paul's Chapel, Westminster Abbey where his widow erected a substantial monument.<br>
<br>His son, <a name="cosubject_22861"></a><span class="headword">Sir Thomas Puckering</span>, baronet  (1591/2&#150;1637)<span class="occ"></span>, was aged four at his father's death. Educated at the King's School, Warwick, under John Owen the epigrammatist, and admitted to the Middle Temple in 1605, he was for some years a companion to Henry, prince of Wales, before completing his education in Paris, having left England in September 1610 in the company of Thomas Lorkin with whom he was to maintain a regular correspondence. Created baronet on 25 November 1611 and knighted on 3 June 1612, on 2 July 1616 he married Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1652), daughter of Sir John Morley of Halnaker, Sussex, and his wife, Cicely Carryll. They had three daughters, of whom two died as children. A member of the North West Passage Company, he was admitted to Lincoln's Inn on 20 February 1621; represented the borough of Tamworth, Staffordshire, in the parliaments of 1621, 1625, 1626, and 1628; and was sheriff of Warwickshire in 1625. Living mainly in Warwick, he founded there a hospital for poor women and a charity to provide houses for tradesmen. He died on 20 March 1637 and was buried in St Mary's, Warwick. Jane, his surviving daughter, died childless in 1652, the Puckering estates passing to Sir Henry Newton, son of Sir Thomas's sister Katherine.<br>
