<span class="headword">Kelly,  Thomas</span>  (1769&#150;1855), <span class="occ">hymn writer and founder of the Kellyites</span>, was born at Kellyville, Queen's county, on 13 July 1769, the only son of Thomas (<i>d</i>. 1809), the Rt Hon. Chief Baron Kelly of Kellyville, Queen's county, justice of the Irish court of common pleas. He was educated at Portarlington and Kilkenny before entering Trinity College, Dublin, on 14 November 1785 and taking his BA degree in 1789. Initially Kelly intended to practise law. While studying for the bar in London he attracted the attention of Edmund Burke, in whose house he was a frequent guest. He was admitted to the Middle Temple on 4 July 1786. Back in Dublin, after being challenged by John Walker on the necessity of inward conversion, he passed through an ascetic period, eventually emerging as an articulate exponent of the tenets of &#145;serious religion&#146;. Against the wishes of his family Kelly then decided to abandon law in favour of ordination in the Church of England, which occurred in 1792. Three years later, in July 1795, he married Elizabeth, eldest daughter of William Tighe (<i>d</i>. 1782), MP (and Irish patron of John Wesley), of Rosanne, co. Wicklow, who brought a sizeable fortune to the marriage. They had at least one daughter.<br>
<br>Inspired by the visit of the English evangelical Rowland Hill in 1793, Kelly began preaching the &#145;doctrines of grace&#146; in and around Dublin. In early 1794, together with three clerical allies, Kelly began preaching the Sunday afternoon sermon at St Luke's, Dublin, until his success awakened the opposition of the rector. Soon afterwards they were inhibited by Robert Fowler, the archbishop of Dublin, for preaching &#145;certain strange and pernicious doctrines&#146;. The focus of their spiritual efforts then began to disperse throughout the country, Kelly abandoning Dublin for Athy. After his marriage he migrated to Blackrock, outside Dublin, preaching at an Anglican chapel of ease recently constructed from his own resources. Here Kelly appeared, as Walker described it, &#145;all on fire, as if he would set the world in a blaze&#146;  (<span class="italic">Evangelical Magazine</span>).<br>
<br>For some years Kelly continued to preach at the principal evangelical churches and chapels throughout Ireland. In 1802 he founded the Kellyites, a religious connexion based on a congregational plan. Although the precise details of the Kellyites remain uncertain, it is known that congregations were founded at New Ross, Waterford, Blackrock, Dublin, Athy, Kilkenny, Cork, Limerick, Portarlington, and Wexford. Some pulpits were filled by laymen and local ministers, others with students from the academy formed by Robert and James Alexander Haldane in Scotland. In 1803, concluding that a national establishment of religion was incompatible with <span class="roman">New Testament</span> principles, Kelly severed his relationship with the Church of England.<br>
<br>At first glance Kelly's secession and the advancement of his connexion outside the established church appear a mere episode in the complex religious history of Ireland; yet when they are considered within the overall context, occurring simultaneously with John Walker's spectacular secession and the founding of his connexion, the Walkerites, they take on added significance.<br>
<br>Kelly continued to minister to the bodies meeting at Dublin and Athy until his death in Dublin on 14 May 1855. By the following year a number of the chapels had closed. Congregations still met at Dublin, Waterford, New Ross, Athy, and perhaps elsewhere, but the number of adherents had begun to diminish considerably. Kelly published a number of controversial religious tracts, although he is best known as the author of some 765 sacred hymns which appeared in three principal volumes: <span class="italic">A Collection of Psalms and Hymns Extracted from Various Authors</span> (1802), <span class="italic">Hymns on Various Passages of Scripture</span> (1804), and <span class="italic">Hymns by Thomas Kelly, not before Published</span> (1815).<br>
<br>One of the outstanding figures in early Irish evangelicalism, Kelly was a deeply learned man, skilled in oriental languages; his friends and acquaintances alike found him a likeable man, frank and generous in manner.<br>
