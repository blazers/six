<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Stratford,  Nicholas</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1633, <em>d.</em> 1707), <span class="occ">bishop of Chester</span>, was baptized on 8 September 1633 in Hemel Hempstead, Hertfordshire, the son of Nicholas Stratford, variously described as a draper or shoemaker, and Anne, his wife. He matriculated as a commoner at Trinity College, Oxford, on 29 July 1651, becoming a scholar on 17 June 1652. He graduated BA on 25 January 1654, proceeded MA on 20 June 1656, and became a probationer fellow of his college on 4 June 1656 and fellow on 20 June 1657. On 29 November 1664 he proceeded BD and on 9 July 1673 was created DD. He was incorporated at Cambridge in 1663.<br>
<br>In August 1667 Stratford was appointed by the crown as warden of the collegiate and parish church of Manchester by the interest of John Dolben, bishop of Rochester. By about this time he had married the daughter and coheir of Stephen Luddington, archdeacon of Stow and Dolben's nephew. They had two sons and two daughters. Stratford accumulated several other preferments: prebendary of Lincoln (1670); rector of Llansanffraid-ym-Mechain, Montgomeryshire (1672); chaplain-in-ordinary to the king (1673); dean of St Asaph (1674), and later rector of Llanrwst, Denbighshire.<br>
<br>As warden Stratford lived close to his church and began vigorously to restore church practices abandoned during the interregnum. Communion was to be received kneeling at the altar rails; the chaplains were to wear surplices for baptisms, churchings, weddings, and funerals; antiphonal singing and chanting in the choir were restored. Incumbents in the parish were to attend strictly to their cures, keep the church registers, render account of fees, and observe prayer book rubrics. The college fellows were encouraged to reside, chaplains' stipends improved, and the college's affairs were carefully administered. Stratford gave much to the poor and encouraged charitable giving by others.<br>
<br>Stratford upheld the divine right of kings and implemented observance of the political occasional services in the prayer book, including a sermon on Charles the martyr on 30 January. Despite his apparently severe political and religious opinions, however, Stratford had the reputation of being conciliatory and forbearing towards dissenters, probably in hopes of reconciling them to the Church of England. The leading Manchester presbyterian minister, Henry Newcome, thought Stratford on his appointment as warden &#145;likely to be a mercy to this place. A good man, of a sweet temper, brave scholar &hellip; and one that &hellip; seems to resolve to settle in the place and to reside. This was thought then, and then it was so&#146;  (<span class="italic">Autobiography</span>, 1.167). Although Newcome's subsequent comments on Stratford were frequently equivocal, the warden appears to have helped Newcome's clergyman son to obtain a Cheshire living. Stratford's relatively conciliatory attitude to dissent and his disquiet at Roman Catholic influence at court is alleged by local historians to have exposed him to attack from extremists and precipitated his departure from Manchester. In 1683 he was nominated vicar of St Mary Aldermanbury, London, by its parishioners. Richard Wroe, lobbying the bishop of Chester for the succession to the wardenship, wrote in June that Stratford had left Manchester &#145;and in such manner as the people think he will not return again&#146;  (<span class="italic">Palatine Note-Book</span>, 2.3&#150;4). On 2 April 1684 Wroe was presented to the wardenship following Stratford's resignation. In the dedicatory epistle addressed to &#145;my worthy and beloved friends, the inhabitants of Manchester and Salford&#146;, prefaced to his <span class="italic">Dissuasive from Revenge</span> (1684) it is perhaps significant that Stratford pleaded for a spirit of charity, while upholding the duty of obedience to rulers. He nevertheless claimed that he had not left Manchester &#145;for any unkindness to me on your part, nor out of any low or mercenary respect on mine&#146;.<br>
<br>Stratford remained at Aldermanbury until the revolution of 1688. Alienated by James II's favouring of Roman Catholics, Stratford supported the accession of William and Mary and was appointed bishop of Chester on 15 September 1689 along with the rich living of Wigan, Chester being a notoriously impoverished see. His upholding of Anglican order together with conciliation of dissent was shown by his membership of the committee for the abortive scheme to revise the prayer book with a view to comprehension of Presbyterians within the established church.<br>
<br>As bishop of Chester, Stratford once again demonstrated his administrative and pastoral abilities. Of his immediate predecessors as bishop John Pearson had been increasingly incapacitated by illness from the late 1670s, while Pearson's successor, Thomas Cartwright, caused scandal by his outspoken advocacy of James II's political and ecclesiastical policies and fled with his master. A zealous pastor, constantly in residence, Stratford was well fitted to deal with a difficult diocese containing large parishes, numerous more or less independent chapelries, nonjuring clergy, and dissenters. He complained of poor parish conditions due to inadequate curates and the lack of visitations for thirteen years. He was keen to improve the quality of the clergy with regular visitations from 1691 and his <span class="italic">Charge</span> that year showed what he expected: study, catechizing, regular communions, public baptisms, preparation for confirmation, reduction of clandestine marriages. He was an active administrator, presiding regularly in the diocesan court and gathering round him a body of high-church tory officials, including his chancellor and archdeacons. Under his immediate successors the Cheshire clergy became notorious for their real or alleged Jacobitism especially when George I's ministers opposed promotion for tory clergy. Stratford's son William (1671&#150;1729), archdeacon of Richmond and canon of Christ Church, Oxford, was a more extreme man than his father. Stratford did not rely simply on formal discipline to improve the church's performance. He was a member of the SPCK, founded in 1699 to improve piety and education as the best means for strengthening the church and combating dissent. Assisted by Dean Fogg of Chester, Stratford supported the societies for the reformation of manners (suspect to many high-churchmen for their co-operation between churchmen and dissenters) and monthly lectures to promote morality.<br>
<br>Stratford's publications included pamphlets (notably against Roman Catholicism), sermons, and visitation charges. In character he was described by a Manchester colleague as &#145;very laborious and extraordinary charitable, affable and humble in his place and generally beloved&#146;, as well as practical in business  (Raines, 143). Surviving portraits of him in his sixties give him a benevolent and intelligent appearance. Stratford died of a stroke in Westminster on 12 February 1707 and was buried in Chester Cathedral on 20 February. He died intestate but on his son's recommendation part of his money went to support a blue coat school for thirty-five poor boys in Chester. The school buildings have survived but the school was closed in 1949.<br>
