<span class="headword">West,  John</span>, first Earl De La Warr  (1693&#150;1766), <span class="occ">politician and army officer</span>, was born on 4 April 1693, the son of John West, sixth Baron De La Warr (<i>c</i>.1663&#150;1723), and his wife, Margaret (<i>d</i>. 1738), the daughter and heir of John Freeman, a London merchant. He was educated at Eton College and then went on the grand tour, from which he returned in 1712. On 18 August of that year he was appointed clerk-extraordinary of the privy council, a post he held until 1723. He was elected as MP for Grampound in Cornwall on 27 January 1715. A loyal government whig, he voted with the ministry on all but one occasion, and did not stand for re-election in 1722.<br>
<br>West continued to serve in the army, rising to the rank of lieutenant-colonel in December 1717. On 25 May 1721 he married, in secret, Lady Charlotte Maccarthy (<i>d</i>. 1735), the daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17378/', "Donough Maccarthy or MacCarty, fourth earl of Clancarty")</script>, with whom he had two sons and two daughters. On his father's death in May 1723 he became seventh Baron De La Warr. He was made lord of the bedchamber to George I on 3 June 1725, became KCB in the same year, and on being assigned treasurer of the household in 1731 he was sworn of the privy council. In March 1736 he was sent to Saxe-Gotha to accompany Princess Augusta to England, where she was to marry Frederick, prince of Wales. According to Lord Hervey, De La Warr was chosen on account of his unprepossessing figure and awkwardness in company. This, it was hoped, would prove unattractive to the princess and curb the prince's jealousy.<br>
<br>On 2 July of the following year De La Warr was appointed captain-general and governor of New York and New Jersey, though he remained in England, where he continued to play an active role in politics from the Lords. In February 1732 he criticized the reintroduction of Samuel Sandys's <span class="roman">Pension Bill</span>. He served as speaker during the absence of Peter, Lord King, in 1733, actively promoted legislation against Edinburgh following the Porteous riots in 1736, and criticized in February 1739 those who petitioned against the recent convention with Spain. In the same month he attempted to have the author and publisher of an anti-government satire, <span class="italic">Manners</span> (1739), questioned in the Lords. His bid to arrest the author, Paul Whitehead, for non-attendance was at first opposed but then supported in the house.<br>
<br>De La Warr's eclectic but always pro-government political career continued in the 1740s. In June 1742 he spoke against a measure to secure trade and navigation rights for merchants in wartime. He later defended the ministry's <span class="roman">Spirituous Liquors Bill</span> and criticized a bill proposing increased trade to the Levant (May 1744) while defending the Turkey Company&#151;of which he was governor&#151;against charges of being a monopoly. He also took an active part in debates over the political responsibilities of the House of Lords. In February 1740 he defended the ministry's decision to request war finances from the Commons alone. This was a position he later came to regret, as a speech on 12 March 1742 makes clear. Later in the same year he introduced several changes to procedures in the Lords, notably on the issue of proxy voting. In December 1747 he was appointed governor of Tilbury, and on 29 April 1752, of Guernsey. In March 1754 he was for a second time elected speaker of the house, during Lord Hardwicke's absence.<br>
<br>On 15 June 1744 De La Warr married his second wife, Anne Nevill, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Walker (<i>d</i>. 1748), the widow of George Nevill, thirteenth Baron Abergavenny. In May 1749 he made an appearance at the jubilee masquerade at Ranelagh dressed as Queen Elizabeth's porter, a costume he wore again at a Russian masquerade at Somerset House on 6 February 1755. He also pursued his military career in the 1740s: he commanded a brigade at the battle of Dettingen (1743) and was promoted to the rank of major-general (March 1745), lieutenant-general (September 1747), and general (March 1755). In March 1761 he was created Earl De La Warr and Viscount Cantelupe by George III. He died on 16 March 1766 and was buried on 22 March at St Margaret's, Westminster.<br>
<br>His son, <a name="cosubject_29088"></a><span class="headword">John West</span>, second Earl De La Warr  (1729&#150;1777), <span class="occ">politician and army officer</span>, entered the army in 1746 as an ensign in the 3rd infantry guards and rose to the rank of colonel (May 1758), major-general (8 March 1761), and lieutenant-general (30 April 1770). From 1761 to 1766 he was vice-chamberlain to Queen Charlotte, and served as master of the horse from 1766 to November 1768, when he was named lord chamberlain. He died in Audley Square, London, on 22 November 1777, and was buried on 30 November at St Margaret's, Westminster. He married on 8 August 1756 Mary (<i>d</i>. 1784), the daughter of Lieutenant-General John Wynyard. They had two sons, William Augustus (1757&#150;1783), who became third Earl De La Warr, and John Richard (1758&#150;1795), fourth earl, who married Catherine (<i>d</i>. 1826), the daughter of Henry Lyell and Catherine Allerstree of Bourne, Cambridge.<br>
<br>The fourth earl's son, <a name="cosubject_29083"></a><span class="headword">George John  Sackville-West</span>, fifth Earl De La Warr  (1791&#150;1869), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born in Savile Row, London, on 26 October 1791. He was educated at Harrow School and Brasenose College, Oxford, and graduated BA in 1812 and MA in 1819. He was appointed a lord of the bedchamber to both George III and George IV and served from July 1813 to March 1828. He was created LLD of Cambridge in 1828, and DLC of Oxford in 1834. On 21 June 1813 he married Elizabeth (1795&#150;1870), the daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/24445/', "John Frederick Sackville, third duke of Dorset")</script>, and in November 1843 acquired a royal licence to put his wife's surname of Sackville before his own. In September 1841 he was sworn of the privy council and appointed lord chamberlain by Sir Robert Peel, a post he held until 1846. He held the same office under Lord Derby from February 1858 to June 1859. De La Warr, who met Byron while at Harrow, was the &#145;Fair Euryalus&#146; of the latter's &#145;Childish Recollections&#146; and the inspiration behind two further poems. He died at Knole Park, Kent, on 23 February 1869; he was succeeded by his eldest son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29078/', "Charles Richard Sackville-West")</script>, sixth Earl De La Warr, and was survived by his wife, who in April 1864 had been created Baroness Buckhurst in her own right. She died at 17 Upper Grosvenor Street, London, on 9 January 1870.<br>
