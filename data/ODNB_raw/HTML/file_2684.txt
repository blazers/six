<span class="headword">Blount,  Charles</span>  (1654&#150;1693), <span class="occ">freethinker and author</span>, was born at Upper Holloway, Islington, Middlesex, on 27 April 1654 and baptized at Highgate Chapel, Hornsey, on 10 May 1654, the fourth son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2687/', "Sir Henry Blount (1602&#150;1682)")</script>, traveller, of Tittenhanger, Hertfordshire, and his wife, Hester (<i>c</i>.1620&#150;1678), daughter of Christopher Wase of Upper Holloway, Middlesex. He was clearly a precocious child &#145;endowed by nature with a great capacity, and with a strong propensity to learning&#146;  (Kippis, 2.380) and his father had him and his elder brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2698/', "Thomas Pope Blount")</script>, educated at home, being opposed to &#145;sending youths to the universities&#146; where &#145;they learnt &hellip; to be debaucht&#146;  (<span class="italic">Brief Lives</span>, 1.109). On 3 December 1672 at Westminster Abbey he married Eleanor (<i>c</i>.1654&#150;1689), fourth daughter of Sir Timothy Tyrrell of Shotover, Oxfordshire, with whom he had three sons and three daughters. About the same time Blount inherited some lands in Islington and was also given the family estate of Blount's Hall, in Staffordshire, where he lived the life of a gentleman and man of letters.<br>
<br>Blount's first publication was the anonymous <span class="italic">Mr Dreyden Vindicated</span> (1673), a defence of John Dryden's play <span class="italic">The Conquest of Granada</span> (1672) against the criticisms of both Richard Leigh's <span class="italic">The Censure of the Rota</span> (1673) and <span class="italic">The Friendly Vindication</span> (1673) attributed to Robert Howard. In 1696 Dryden made a complimentary reference to him in his <span class="italic">The Life of Lucian</span> prefixed to the edition of <span class="italic">The Works of Lucian</span> (1711) partly translated by Blount himself. On 19 December 1678 Charles became a member of the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/92786', "Green Ribbon Club")</script>, a political group of whig activists and propagandists. In the same year he published anonymously the first of his major works, <span class="italic">Anima mundi</span>, with the false imprint &#145;Amsterdam, <i>Anno Mundi</i>. 00000&#146;, in the writing of which he probably had the assistance of his father, whose libertine ideas he inherited (see Sir Henry Blount's fragment &#145;De anima&#146; in <span class="italic">The Oracles of Reason</span>, 1693). Relying mainly upon unorthodox authors such as Montaigne, <span class="italic">Anima mundi</span> is an essay on pagan doctrines about the nature of the human soul and its destiny in the afterlife. The author apparently argues in favour of the immortality of the soul on moral and psychological grounds but is purposely ambiguous and unconvincing throughout. The sceptical tone of the book raised a great clamour. The bishop of London ordered only &#145;the Bare Suppression of it&#146;, but &#145;Advantage was taken&#146;  (L'Estrange) and during the bishop's absence from London the book was burnt. Blount sent a copy of it to Hobbes with a letter, dated 1678, in which he expressed his preference for the religion of the Arians and gave a polemical description of the first Christian councils. The same sceptical conclusions on the nature of the soul reappeared in two letters that he sent in February 1680 to his libertine friend the earl of Rochester (printed in <span class="italic">The Oracles of Reason</span>).<br>
<br>In 1679, under the pseudonym Junius Brutus, Blount published a pamphlet of strong whig tendencies, entitled <span class="italic">An Appeal from the Country to the City</span>, defending the reality of the Popish Plot and describing the fate of London should the duke of York and the papists gain control of the city. Benjamin Harris, the printer of this work, was brought to trial and fined, while the pamphlet was condemned to be burnt by the common hangman. In the same year Blount, under the pseudonym Philopatris, addressed parliament with <span class="italic">A Just Vindication of Learning</span> (1679), asking that body to consider his arguments against the renewal of the <span class="roman">Licensing Act</span>, which was due to expire. Following the arguments of Milton's <span class="italic">Areopagitica</span>, Blount stressed the importance of freedom of the press for the achievement of liberty and condemned censorship as the greatest affront to learning. Soon after Hobbes's death in 1679 he edited anonymously <span class="italic">The Last Sayings, or Dying Legacy of Mr Thomas Hobbs</span> (1680), a broadsheet chiefly consisting of extracts from <span class="italic">Leviathan</span> whose ambiguous nature concealed the real intentions of the author.<br>
<br>The influence of Thomas Hobbes and Edward Herbert, Lord Herbert of Cherbury, is strongly evident in Blount's next two works, published in 1680: <span class="italic">Great is Diana of the Ephesians</span>, published anonymously with the false imprint &#145;Cosmopoli&#146;, and <span class="italic">The Two First Books of Philostratus</span>. The former, mixing the libertine criticism of positive religions with analysis of the origin and decline of the rational creed, is an open attack upon heathen sacrifices concealing a harsh polemic against Christianity. The latter is an English translation of the life of Apollonius Tyaneus by Philostratus with long discursive annotations partly taken from the anonymous manuscript &#145;Dialogue between a tutor and his pupil&#146;. The text, a biography of the neo-Pythagorean philosopher Apollonius, whose life offered an ironic surrogate for that of Christ, was later condemned in 1693.<br>
<br>In 1683 Blount published anonymously <span class="italic">Miracles, No Violations of the Laws of Nature</span>, a set of quotations (without acknowledgement) from Thomas Burnet, Hobbes, and Spinoza proving the groundlessness of any pretended miracles. The text drawn from Spinoza was Blount's translation of the sixth chapter of <span class="italic">Tractatus theologico-politicus</span>, the first English translation of any of Spinoza's writings. In the same year Blount published <span class="italic">Religio laici</span>, a deistic tract chiefly taken from Herbert's &#145;Religio laici&#146; (first published in 1933) and <span class="italic">Dialogue between a Tutor and His Pupil</span>. Expressing his adherence to the five Herbertian principles of any natural religion and to the concept of reason as the only foundation of faith, Blount thus answered Dryden's criticism against deists contained in a poem with the same title published in 1682.<br>
<br>Ten years later, in January 1693, Blount issued anonymously <span class="italic">King William and Queen Mary Conquerors</span>, a tract which claimed that both sovereigns came to the throne in 1689 by right of conquest and, following Hobbes and Grotius, that subjects should submit to any rulers who could protect them, even if conquerors. The pamphlet was, however, moderate, arguing that only certain circumstances could justify conquest, and that a conqueror could not legitimately claim absolute power. It was licensed by Edmund Bohun, the tory licenser of the press, who agreed with its political theory. It was probably not, as previously thought, deliberately written to discredit Bohun and had only a small role in the demise of the <span class="roman">Licensing Act</span>, which was renewed in 1693 but expired in 1695. Its argument, however, proved highly controversial. Many whigs agreed with its moderate conquest doctrine but it also found both whig and tory opponents in the House of Commons, which after a heated debate, concluded that it was &#145;highly injurious to their Majesties; and inconsistent with the Principles on which this Government is founded&#146;  (<span class="italic">JHC</span>, 10.788). On 23 January the book was condemned to be burnt by the common hangman, and the following day Bohun was dismissed from office. No action against the author is recorded. Soon after that, a pamphlet was published under the initials J. M.&#151;<span class="italic">Reasons Humbly Offered for the Liberty of Unlicens'd Printing</span> (1693). Another adaptation of <span class="italic">Areopagitica</span> against the futility of licensing acts and the inadequacies of Edmund Bohun, this was generally presumed at the time to be by Blount, but in fact it is unlikely that he wrote it. Just before his death Blount published <span class="italic">The Oracles of Reason</span> (1693), a collection of miscellaneous tracts and letters written by himself, his friend Charles Gildon, and other freethinkers from 1678 to 1693. The volume questioned or denied the validity of &#145;many strongly held beliefs, by raising doubts over Genesis, denying revelation, doubting miracles, and even venturing the eternity of a plurality of worlds&#146;  (Redwood, 497).<br>
<br>Blount's wife had died in 1689, and he and his deceased wife's sister fell in love, but both knew that a marriage between persons so connected was illegal. On 8 March 1693 Blount wrote a letter to his friend Gildon &#145;to Justifie the Marrying of two Sisters, the one after the other&#146;  (<span class="italic">Oracles of Reason</span>, 135) and also petitioned the archbishop of Canterbury, but to no avail. Having long laboured in vain to convince her that she might marry him anyway, at last, whether in a deliberate attempt to kill himself or in the hope of touching her heart, Blount attempted suicide. After languishing for about a month he finally died in Catherine Street, London, at the end of August 1693, and was buried in the family vault at Ridge, Tittenhanger. His freethinking is confirmed in his will of 11 February 1693, in which he resigned his &#145;soul into the universal spirit whereof she [<i>sic</i>] is a particle&#146;, and submitted himself &#145;to the allwise and great God's disposall not distrusting his divine providence in the next world who hath been so good and gracious to me in this&#146;  (will). He also sent his &#145;prayers to the great and only supream mind for his blessing upon my poor children&#146;  (ibid.). Concerning his books he instructed that if his heirs had &#145;any vallue for my memory they will never sell or dispose of that study and theire collection which I have with soe much charge and trouble gathered together&#146;  (ibid.). He left his estate to his five children and earnestly requested that if his executors carried out only one of his instructions it would be to bury him next to his wife, &#145;my dearest Nelly the best woman that ever lived&#146;  (ibid.). Perhaps because of difficulties over the manner of his death, the will was not proved until 18 June 1697, by his eldest son, Henry. In 1695 Charles Gildon published <span class="italic">The Miscellaneous Works of Charles Blount</span> with a preface by himself containing a defence of suicide. Wrongly considered a plagiarist by some, Blount was rather author, compiler, and propagator of important freethinking works, widely circulated and criticized.<br>
