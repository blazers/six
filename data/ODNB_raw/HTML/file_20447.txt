<span class="headword">O'Brien,  Daniel</span>, first Viscount Clare  (1577?&#150;1663), <span class="occ">politician and soldier</span>, was the third and youngest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20446/', "Conor O'Brien, third earl of Thomond (c.1535&#150;1581)")</script>, and his second wife, &Uacute;na 
    (Owyne; <i>d</i>. 1589)
  , daughter of Turlough Mac I Brien Arra of co. Tipperary. Unlike his protestant brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20453/', "Donough O'Brien")</script> and his nephews, Henry and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20440/', "Barnabas O'Brien")</script>, he remained a staunch Catholic throughout his life. During the Nine Years' War he fought for the crown. In 1598 he defended his brother Donough's estates in co. Clare from rebels under the command of the earl of Tyrone but was forced to surrender Ibrickan Castle in 1599. He was wounded during the assault, and the insurgents took him prisoner, but released him a week later. On the return of his brother Donough from England, O'Brien fought alongside him for the remainder of the war and in July 1604 received a knighthood and lands for his loyalty; henceforth he was known for most of his adult life as Sir Daniel O'Brien of Moyarta and Carrigholt. In 1600 he married Lady Catherine, third daughter of Gerald Fitzgerald, sixteenth earl of Desmond; they had four sons and seven daughters.<br>
<br>In 1613 O'Brien sat as MP for County Clare and became involved in the furore over the election of the speaker of the House of Commons, allegedly holding the Catholic candidate, Sir John Everard, in the chair. Summoned to England to answer for his conduct, he escaped with a reprimand (perhaps due to the influence of Donough, who had been dispatched to court as an agent for the government). In 1634 he was re-elected MP for County Clare in place of his nephew Barnabas who had gone to England, but clashed with Lord Deputy Wentworth in parliament over the proposed plantation of Connaught. Increasingly the Anglicizing and tenurial policies of the earls of Thomond aroused O'Brien's ire and he complained that the fourth earl had forcibly acquired lands from McNamarras prior to 1624, &#145;being then Lord President of Munster and so powerful that [none] could or dare oppose him in any his actions&#146;, and that the fifth earl was &#145;so powerful, so wealthy and allied and befriended with all the gent[lemen] Freeholders in the several countries of this kingdom as your supplicant [O'Brien] may not expect any indifference of trial to be had by course of common law&#146;  (petition of February 1637, Thomond papers, Petworth House Archives, W. Sussex RO).<br>
<br>O'Brien was an active confederate during the 1640s, and regularly sat in the general assemblies. He took part in the siege of Ballyally Castle, co. Clare, but in 1645 his nephew Barnabas pre-empted his attempt to seize Bunratty Castle by surrendering it to forces loyal to parliament. His own castle of Carrigholt, co. Clare, fell to the Cromwellians on 7 November 1651. Despite this he appears to have reached an accommodation with the Cromwellian army and was one of twenty-six major Catholic landowners to secure an exemption from the <span class="roman">Act for the Settling of Ireland</span> (1652), perhaps thanks to the marriages of two of his sons to prominent protestant families. The influence enjoyed by his grandson <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20448/', "Daniel O'Brien")</script> at the exiled royalist court ensured that O'Brien was named in Charles II's &#145;gracious declaration&#146; (30 November 1660), and raised to the peerage as Baron Moyarta and Viscount Clare in 1662 (patent of 11 July). He died the following year. His heir, Donough, predeceased him, and Conor (<i>c</i>.1605&#150;<i>c</i>.1670), his second son, succeeded to the viscountcy. Like his father Conor had been an active confederate, representing County Clare on the supreme council. He married his third cousin, Honora, daughter of Daniel O'Brien of Dough, and had seven daughters and one son, Daniel. Thanks to the latter's royalist contacts, the <span class="roman">Act of Settlement</span> (1662) and the <span class="roman">Act for Explanation</span> (1665) restored the family to their pre-war estates and to a house in Limerick. An extant lease of 1667 suggests that the second viscount was an &#145;improving&#146; landlord, requiring his tenants to enclose an acre of land with a stone wall, to build a stone house, and to plough any land &#145;after the English manner&#146;  (Ainsworth, 365).<br>
