<span class="headword">Clunes,  Alexander de Moro Sherriff <span class="st"> [Alec]</span></span>  (1912&#150;1970), <span class="occ">actor and theatre manager</span>, was born at 2 Western Road, Brixton, London, on 17 May 1912, the son of Alexander Sherriff Clunes, actor, and his wife, Georgina Ada Sumner, actress. He was educated at Cliftonville, Margate. Although he came of stage stock on both sides, he did not originally intend to adopt his parents' profession, but earned his living in advertising and journalism while keeping his inherited acting talent to enliven his leisure time. He was, however, a natural player and after considerable and valuable experience with leading amateur groups he found the urge to turn professional too strong for him. By 1934 he was touring with Sir P. Ben Greet and later in the same year joined the Old Vic Company. His progress thereafter was steady, and the parts he was called upon to play, both in the classics and in contemporary drama, grew in importance until in 1939 he was one of the leaders of the company at the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre at Stratford upon Avon, playing Petruchio, Richmond, Iago, Benedick, and Coriolanus. He was now firmly established and what was more his work during the Malvern festival of 1938 had caught the eye and ear of George Bernard Shaw who in 1940 gave him the part of Godfrey Kneller in <span class="italic">In Good King Charles's Golden Days</span> at the New Theatre in London. In 1941 Clunes toured with the Old Vic Company, during its wartime exile, playing Young Marlow, Malvolio, and Taffy in <span class="italic">Trilby</span>; but he left them in order to embark, in the following year, upon a project of his own which was to prove his most important contribution to the theatre and carry him to the peak of his career.<br>
<br>This was the foundation, in May 1942, of the Arts Theatre Group of Actors, a body which Clunes served as leading spirit, manager, director, and actor for the next ten or eleven years. Some movement of the kind was badly needed at the time; for although in a general way the theatre was prosperous during and after the last years of the war, the taste of the emergent new playgoing public was for revivals of established favourite plays rather than for new work. One of Clunes's best claims to respect during his time at the Arts Theatre Club was his readiness to help high-aspiring new dramatists. He subsidized Christopher Fry during the writing of <span class="italic">The Lady's not for Burning</span>, and then staged the play (1948) with himself in the lead. And he accepted John Whiting's obscure <span class="italic">Saint's Day</span> (1951) at a time when it was unlikely that any of the regular theatre managers would have taken the risk. In all, he was responsible for the production of more than 100 plays at this little theatre, and the artistic standard at which he aimed was always impressively high.<br>
<br>Clunes's work at the Arts Theatre was very much to his credit and might well have carried him to the topmost rank in his profession; but this did not quite happen. The reason was not easy to see, for in every technical respect he was an exceptionally well-graced actor. He had a good stage presence, a fine voice which he knew very well how to use, an impressive sense of character, and a lively intelligence. All these qualities were well in evidence when in 1945 he played Hamlet; while the performance was going on it was possible for a critic to rate it among the best Hamlets of the day. Yet somehow when the final curtain was down there was a feeling that his Hamlet had been addressed to the intellect rather than to the emotion of its audience, and it did not have much hold upon the memory.<br>
<br>So the later years of Clunes's stage career seemed to be tinged with disappointment: his varied natural talent and intensive experience had not availed to put him among those leaders of his profession whom the public acclaimed. He lacked, perhaps, that personal magnetism popularly known as &#145;star quality&#146;. For instance, when he succeeded Rex Harrison as Professor Higgins in <span class="italic">My Fair Lady</span>, his performance was striking; yet it was Harrison's image that lived more vividly in the memory. Luckily for him, Clunes had other interests. He collected prints and drawings and owned and ran a bookshop. In 1964 he published a handsomely produced volume, <span class="italic">The British Theatre</span>.<br>
<br>In 1956 Clunes married Daphne Acott, with whom he had one son and one daughter. An earlier marriage, in 1949, to <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/89780/', "Stella Richman (1922&#150;2002)")</script>, had been dissolved in 1954. Clunes died in London on 13 March 1970. His son Martin also became an actor.<br>
