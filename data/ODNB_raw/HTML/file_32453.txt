<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Clodd,  Edward</span>  (1840&#150;1930), <span class="occ">banker and popular anthropologist</span>, was born at Queen Street, Margate, Kent, on 1 July 1840, the eldest child of Edward Clodd and his wife, Susan Parker. Of his six brothers and sisters four died in infancy and two did not survive childhood. His father was a Trinity House pilot, and in early life was captain and part owner of a brig. Born at Aldeburgh, Suffolk, he had lived for a time at Margate, from where his brig traded with the north, but he returned to Aldeburgh soon after his son's birth. From his mother Clodd early acquired a love of reading. His parents, of Suffolk farming and fishing background, were Baptists, and Edward was intended for the ministry. After receiving instruction at a dame-school, he attended Aldeburgh grammar school, of which Joseph Buck was master. During a visit to London at the age of fourteen, Clodd obtained work as a clerk and settled there. Initially employed in an accountant's office in Cornhill, he subsequently worked for two other firms, one of which was James Coster &amp; Co., Fountain Court, before he became a clerk at the London Joint Stock Bank in 1862; ten years later, he was appointed secretary. On 20 August 1861 he married Eliza Sarah (1836&#150;1911), the daughter of a surgeon, Cornelius Garman, of Bow, London.<br>
<br>From his early days in London Clodd attended the Birkbeck Institute, read assiduously in the free libraries, and heard lectures. On Sundays he listened to the best-known preachers of every denomination and followed the controversies with lively interest. His Baptist creed was exchanged for Congregationalism and Unitarianism, and he soon became friendly with many of the more liberal leaders of religious thought. The debates generated by biblical criticism and evolutionary theories instilled in him an interest in science. In 1869, with the help of William Huggins, he was admitted to the Royal Astronomical Society. Here he met Richard Anthony Proctor, who invited him to contribute to the weekly scientific periodical <span class="italic">Knowledge</span>. During Proctor's lecture tours in the USA and Australia in the 1880s Clodd acted as sub-editor, and he gave occasional lectures on science and literature.<br>
<br>In 1873 Clodd published his first book, <span class="italic">The Childhood of the World</span>. Written as a primer on evolutionary anthropology, it introduced children to the latest information on prehistoric man. It quickly passed through four editions and was translated into six European and two African languages. Two years later he expanded his analysis with the <span class="italic">Childhood of Religions</span>. This marked his foray into folklore. His address of the same year to the Sunday Lecture Society, entitled &#145;The birth and growth of myth, and its survival in folk-lore, legend, and dogma&#146;, ultimately culminated in his <span class="italic">Myths and Dreams</span> (1885). One of the six men who constituted the &#145;great team&#146; of British folklorists, Clodd was a self-proclaimed &#145;anthropological folklorist&#146;  (Dorson, 202&#150;65). In 1877 he joined the unconventional <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/95110', "Century Club")</script>, where he met Samuel Butler, W. K. Clifford, John Tyndall, E. B. Tylor, and many other men of distinction in science and letters. In 1878 he resigned from the Royal Astronomical Society and joined the Folk-Lore Society. Although a departure from his earlier theistic writings, his <span class="italic">Jesus of Nazareth</span> (1880) was pronounced &#145;one of the best of its kind in the language&#146; by the Unitarian <span class="italic">Inquirer</span>  (McCabe, 47). It won for Clodd the friendship of T. H. Huxley, York Powell, John Collier, Frederick Pollock, Leslie Stephen, Mrs Lynn Linton, and other well-known people.<br>
<br>Clodd's success had been laboriously won. Long hours of reading, after an average of ten hours a day at work in the bank, resulted in recurrent bouts of insomnia and neuralgia. His <span class="italic">Story of Creation</span> (1888), a popular study of evolution, sold five thousand copies in three months, and publishers began to court him. At this time, under the influence of James Cotter Morison, he had leanings towards the Positivist Society, but he found a corrective in his friendship with the novelists Grant Allen and George Meredith.<br>
<br>Clodd had, as Thomas Hardy (who knew him well) noted in 1915, &#145;a genius for friendship&#146;  (Haddon, 185). From 1878 he used his weekend home in Aldeburgh, Strafford House, for annual Whitsuntide gatherings of eminent intellectuals. In addition to the friends already mentioned, J. B. Bury, Sir Ray Lankester, Sir James Frazer, Sir Alfred Lyall, Sir Mortimer Durand, and George Haven Putnam were often there. In 1900 thirty-four friends, including Herbert Spencer, W. Holman Hunt, Edmund Gosse, and Clement Shorter, presented him with a carved oak table as a sixtieth birthday gift. Historically, Clodd continues to be remembered for his friendships. His letters and diaries have provided insight into the lives and intellectual careers of Thomas Hardy, James Frazer, George Gissing, and W. B. Yeats. Meredith called Clodd &#145;Sir Reynard&#146;, perhaps because of his shrewd expression, but on his native heath he looked like a sailor and radiated a bluff benevolence. According to contemporaries, he was essentially a man of generous and sociable disposition, who devoted unremitting attention to his guests, and showed himself a zealous humanitarian on all public issues.<br>
<br>In 1881 Clodd was elected to the Savile Club; he was an original member of the Johnson Club and the Omar Khayyam Club, founded in 1884 and 1892 respectively. President of the Omar Khayyam Club in 1895, Clodd adopted the epicurean philosophy of the Persian poet from his fiftieth year onwards. In the true Huxleyan sense of the word, Clodd had become an agnostic. His presidential addresses of 1895 and 1896 to the Folk-Lore Society demonstrated the implications of his agnosticism for the study of folklore and embroiled him in controversy. W. E. Gladstone, an original member of the society, resigned in protest against what he regarded as Clodd's offensive remarks, and the Catholic Truth Society responded with a 24-page pamphlet. Clodd became notorious for his condemnation of the culturally atavistic superstitions behind spiritualism and &#145;dogmatic&#146; Christian theology and ritual. Through lectures and numerous journal articles and reviews, he established himself as a prolific popularizer of scientific naturalism. From 1906 to 1913 he served as chairman of the Rationalist Press Association, and, upon the founding of the Secular Education League in 1907, he was appointed to its general council. Through the character of Edwin Dodd in <span class="italic">Boon</span> (1915), H. G. Wells provided a trenchant satirization of Clodd, the rationalist. According to Boon, Dodd &#145;looked under his bed for the Deity, and slept with a large revolver under his pillow for fear of a revelation&#146;  (Wells, 45). In the early twentieth century, Clodd vociferously objected to another threat to rationalism: psychoanalysis.<br>
<br>Clodd's first wife, from whom he was separated, died in 1911. He confided in his diary that he was pleased to be a widower. Three years earlier, Arnold, one of their eight children (six sons, two daughters), had died. He, in turn, had been predeceased by two brothers, who died in infancy. On 18 December 1914 Clodd married 27-year-old Phyllis Maud Rope. The daughter of a farmer, Arthur Mingay Rope, of Leiston, Suffolk, she was a student of biology at the Royal College of Science. The following year, on Clodd's seventy-fifth birthday, he retired from the Joint Stock Bank, and proceeded to write his <span class="italic">Memories</span> (1916) at his now permanent residence in Aldeburgh. A &#145;shrewd and excellent handler of credit&#146;, the <span class="italic">Investors' Review</span> said of him on his retirement. He was still vigorous in mind and body, lecturing at the Royal Institution in 1917 and 1921, and writing much on folklore and occultism. After 1922 he suffered occasional illness, sometimes severe. In May 1928 he had a stroke, and for more than a year he suffered from aphasia, and could not read owing to cataract. He seemed to recover, but in the spring of 1930 he contracted bronchial asthma. &#145;I die, I die&#146;  (McCabe, 215), he murmured minutes before the end. He died fully conscious on 16 March 1930 at Strafford House, 33 Crag Path, Aldeburgh. In accordance with his wishes his body was cremated at Ipswich four days later and the ashes were scattered upon the sea off Aldeburgh. He had no children by his second marriage. He was survived by his wife.<br>
