<span class="headword">Power,  William</span>  (1873&#150;1951), <span class="occ">writer and journalist</span>, was born at 16 Arlington Street, Glasgow, on 30 August 1873, the eldest of the five children of William Power (1839/40&#150;1886/7), shipmaster, and his wife, Ada, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Denham (1839/40&#150;1904). Both parents came from Brechin, Forfarshire. He attended Woodside School in the west end of Glasgow, but had to leave at the age of fourteen as a result of his father's death at Gibraltar from west African fever. In 1887 he obtained a position with the Royal Bank of Scotland in Glasgow, where he was employed for twenty years. On 20 August 1906, he married Giulia Dick (1871/2&#150;1922), a schoolteacher, and the following year, encouraged by the success of essays he had contributed to the <span class="italic">Glasgow Herald</span>, he joined the paper as a full-time member of its editorial staff and remained there as essay and leader writer for nearly another twenty years. His first wife died in 1922, and in 1924 Power married Williamina Mills (<i>d</i>. 1946); there were no children of either marriage. In 1926 Power resigned from the <span class="italic">Glasgow Herald</span> to become editor of the <span class="italic">Scots Observer</span>, a new weekly supported by the Scottish churches. The paper was not successful and he left the editorship in 1929 to work for Associated Newspapers.<br>
<br>William Power was much more than a journalist. Although forced by circumstances to be largely self-educated, he had a wide knowledge of his country's history and literature, and of literature generally, together with a keen critical understanding, qualities developed through his mother's love of the songs and sayings of her native Forfarshire. He was a considerable essayist and critic himself, and a supporter of the new writing of the inter-war Scottish cultural revival&#151;he was in touch with all the major figures of the &#145;Scottish renaissance&#146;. His autobiography is significant for its contemporaneous perspectives on the events of that period, both within and outside of Scotland. His first published work, in 1893, was an extended blank verse poem, <span class="italic">Clutha</span>, about the river-spirit of the Clyde. Among his many subsequent writings about Scotland, his principal publications include <span class="italic">The World Unvisited</span> (1922), <span class="italic">Robert Burns and other Essays and Sketches</span> (1926), <span class="italic">My Scotland</span> (1934), <span class="italic">Scotland and the Scots</span> (1934), <span class="italic">Literature and Oatmeal</span> (1935), <span class="italic">Should Auld Acquaintance &hellip; : an Autobiography</span> (1937), and <span class="italic">The Culture of the Scots: its Past and Future</span> (1943). He stood unsuccessfully as Scottish nationalist candidate in the parliamentary by-election in Argyll in 1940, and was associated with the movement for a parliament in Edinburgh as chairman and then president of Scottish Convention.<br>
<br>Power was no narrow nationalist, however. Like Hugh MacDiarmid and Neil Gunn he saw nationalism and internationalism as being essentially complementary. He was a founder member of Scottish PEN and its president (1935&#150;8), and was latterly a president of the Glasgow Esperanto Society. Other interests are seen in his presidency of the Scottish Ramblers' Federation (1934) and his membership of the Glasgow Art Club and Edinburgh Arts Club.<br>
<br>Power lived principally in Glasgow and later at Corra Linn, Stirling. He died in hospital in Alloa, Clackmannanshire, on 13 June 1951; his funeral service was held at Glasgow Cathedral on 16 June, and he was buried in Old Eastwood cemetery, Glasgow. Obituaries commented on his intellectual curiosity, his kindness towards young writers, his humour, his love for his country, and on his being &#145;a good European and a world citizen&#146;. His own words from his autobiography make a fitting epitaph: &#145;To help in the restoration of national culture was my central aim&#146;.<br>
