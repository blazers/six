<span class="headword">Fitzalan,  Richard (III)</span>, fourth earl of Arundel and ninth earl of Surrey  (1346&#150;1397), <span class="occ">magnate</span>, was the eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9534/', "Richard (II) Fitzalan, third earl of Arundel and eighth earl of Surrey (c.1313&#150;1376)")</script>, and his second wife, Eleanor (<i>d</i>. 1372), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/12959/', "Henry, earl of Lancaster")</script>, and widow of John, Lord Beaumont. He was married first in 1359 to Elizabeth, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2778/', "William de Bohun, earl of Northampton")</script>, and second, on 15 August 1390, to Philippa, daughter of Edmund (III) Mortimer, earl of March, and widow of John Hastings, earl of Pembroke. She was aged fourteen and Arundel about forty-four. On the death of his father on 24 January 1376 he inherited his lands, titles, and most of his enormous wealth, though not without opposition from his half-brother Edmund, the son of Earl Richard (II)'s first wife, Isabella Despenser, who raided his lands in Essex in an attempt to assert his own claims to them. Edmund's challenge was ineffectual, however, and Arundel remained one of the wealthiest men in England until his death, although unlike his father he generally declined to lend his money to the crown, the only loan of comparable size to his father's being that of 5000 marks which he and his brother John Arundel advanced to Edward III in March 1377. This was probably one among many sources of friction between him and the new king, Richard II.<br>
<br>Arundel was appointed to the &#145;continual council&#146; set up in the Good Parliament of 1376 to advise the aged Edward III, and he served as butler at Richard II's coronation, where he was one of several earls who carried the young king on his shoulders. Shortly after the coronation he was made admiral of the western fleet, and was also appointed to the minority councils of July 1377 and November 1378, and to the (ineffective) commissions set up to reform the royal household in the 1380 and 1381 parliaments. He was with the king in London during the great revolt of 1381, and was given custody of the great seal for two days following the murder of Archbishop Sudbury, the chancellor, on 14 June. In the next parliament, that of November 1381, he and Michael de la Pole were appointed to remain in the royal household &#145;to counsel and govern the king's person&#146;  (<span class="italic">RotP</span>, 3.104). During these years he took an active, though not always distinguished, part in the war: he was repulsed from Harfleur in 1378, and held to blame by some for the English failure to take St Malo in the same year. He was subsequently rejected by the bishop of Norwich as the king's representative on the Flemish crusade of 1383.<br>
<br>Within another year there occurred Arundel's first open breach with the king, when he launched a fierce attack on the royal government in the Salisbury parliament of 1384 and was told by Richard II to &#145;go to the devil!&#146;  (<span class="italic">Westminster Chronicle</span>, 68). Although he joined the royal campaign to Scotland in 1385, he was to spend the remaining years of his life in open or covert opposition to Richard II, his personal relations with whom were never good. His chief grievances against the government in the 1380s seem to have been first, his objection to the king's favouritism towards men such as Robert de Vere, earl of Oxford, and Michael de la Pole, earl of Suffolk; second, his desire to prosecute a more active war policy against France than that preferred by the king and his advisers; and third, his belief that serious incompetence and corruption characterized the crown's financial administration. His misgivings were shared by many of the parliamentary Commons, with whom he was frequently appointed to confer during the stormy sessions of the 1380s. In the Wonderful Parliament of October 1386, in which these criticisms came to a head, he, his brother Thomas, bishop of Ely, and their political ally, the duke of Gloucester, were all appointed to the commission of government set up to reform the royal household and administration, which held power during the following twelve months. Arundel was also reappointed as admiral. Despite the king's lack of co-operation, a financial reform programme was put into effect and a more aggressive policy adopted towards France, the highlight of which was Arundel's capture off Margate, on 24 March 1387, of the Franco-Flemish wine fleet on its way from La Rochelle to Sluys; the Westminster chronicle records that 8000 tuns of wine were captured and subsequently sold in England for 4<i>d</i>. a gallon, thus ensuring the earl's popularity.<br>
<br>The commission was due to relinquish power in November 1387. However, when Gloucester, Arundel, and their ally, the earl of Warwick, heard of Richard II's &#145;questions to the judges&#146; of August 1387, which threatened the lives of those who had opposed the king's wishes in the parliament of 1386, they refused to come to Westminster. According to the monk of Evesham, the subsequent crisis was precipitated by Richard II's attempt to have Arundel arrested at his castle of Reigate, whereupon Gloucester, Arundel, and Warwick appealed of treason five of the king's principal favourites (de Vere, de la Pole, Alexander Neville, archbishop of York, Robert Tresilian, the king's chief justice, and Nicholas Brembre, mayor of London) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/53093/', "Lords appellant")</script>]. It is from this action that they and the earls of Derby and Nottingham, who later associated themselves with the appeal, are known to history as the appellants. On 13 November 1387 Gloucester, Arundel, and Warwick assembled their retinues at Haringay Park, Hornsey, Middlesex, and on 17 November, accompanied by 300 followers, presented their appeals to the king in person at Westminster. Richard II declared that the appeals would be heard in the next parliament, but in the meantime prepared for war, dispatching de Vere to Chester to raise an army. However, de Vere's army was defeated by the combined forces of the appellants at Radcot Bridge, near Witney, on 20 December, following which the five lords returned to London, arrested some fifty of the king's supporters, purged the royal household, and probably deposed the king for two or three days. Their control of the government was now assured, and when parliament opened on 3 February 1388 they secured the conviction and execution of eight of the king's supporters (including Sir Simon Burley, Tresilian, and Brembre, although de Vere, de la Pole, and Neville had fled abroad), the exile of all the royal justices to Ireland, and the dismissal of a further forty or so of the king's supporters from court. Then, having voted themselves &pound;20,000 for their expenses in saving the realm and secured an indemnity for themselves and their followers, they brought the Merciless Parliament to a close on 4 June. Meanwhile Arundel, now captain of Brest as well as admiral, crossed to Brittany in May, but failed to achieve anything of note. The appellants remained in control for another year, but on 3 May 1389 the king resumed power, replacing Earl Richard as admiral and captain of Brest on 18 May.<br>
<br>During the next few years, while some of his former colleagues made their peace with the king, Arundel remained unreconciled, particularly on the question of the French war; and when a rising&#151;directed apparently against Richard II's and John of Gaunt's negotiations for peace with France&#151;broke out in Cheshire in the spring of 1393, he was accused by Gaunt of taking no action against it, despite the fact that he was at the time residing at his nearby castle of Holt. In the parliament of January 1394 he launched a characteristically rash verbal assault against the king and Gaunt, complaining among other things that Richard II and his uncle were too intimate, that the king and members of his retinue should not wear Gaunt's livery collar, that Gaunt was so overbearing in meetings of the royal council that other lords dared not speak their minds, and that Richard II should not have granted Gaunt either the duchy of Aquitaine or such a large sum of money for his Spanish campaign of 1386. He received no support from his fellow lords, however, and was compelled to make a humiliating apology to Gaunt in full parliament. On 30 April 1394 he took the precaution of securing a comprehensive pardon from the king, but on 3 August they clashed again when the earl arrived late for Queen Anne's funeral at Westminster Abbey, then promptly asked leave to depart. So incensed was the king that he seized a baton from an attendant and struck Arundel on the head with it so forcefully that he &#145;fell to the ground, with blood streaming out all over the floorstones&#146;  (Riley, 168), and the funeral service had to be delayed until the church had been cleansed. As a result Arundel was imprisoned in the Tower of London for a week, and only released on bail of &pound;40,000. Nor did his relations with the king improve thereafter. He continued to raise objections to the terms of both the peace negotiations with France, and the conditions attached to the twenty-eight-year Anglo-French truce of 1396. It was probably because of this that he and Gloucester refused to attend a meeting of the council in February 1397.<br>
<br>Five months later the king decided to strike against those who had previously humiliated him. On 10 and 11 July, without warning, he arrested Gloucester, Arundel, and Warwick. Arundel was apparently persuaded by his brother Thomas Arundel, archbishop of Canterbury, to give himself up to the king under assurances of safe conduct, but having done so was promptly dispatched to Carisbrooke Castle. On 5 August, at Nottingham Castle, an appeal of treason was presented against all three of them, accusing them of raising rebellion against the king in 1387, usurping the royal authority with their commission of 1386, and putting to death various supporters of the king without good cause in 1388. Arundel was brought into parliament on 21 September to face his accusers. He conducted himself with a degree of courage and defiance which clearly made a strong impression on the chroniclers of the time, for several of them include vivid descriptions of his trial. Claiming the benefit of his pardons of 1388 and 1394, he was told by the speaker, Sir John Bussy, that these had been revoked &#145;by the king, the lords, and us, the faithful commons&#146;. &#145;Where are those faithful commons?&#146; retorted Arundel. &#145;I know all about you and your crew, and how you have got here&#151;not to act faithfully, but to shed my blood&#146;. When his former fellow appellant, the earl of Derby, rose to accuse him of plotting to seize the king in 1387, he replied, &#145;You, Henry earl of Derby, you lie in your teeth. I never said anything to you or to anyone else about my lord king, except what was to his honour and welfare&#146;  (Given-Wilson, <span class="italic">Chronicles</span>, 59). He was nevertheless convicted of treason and sentenced to be drawn, hanged, beheaded, and quartered. Because of Arundel's noble birth Richard II commuted the sentence to beheading only, and he was immediately led away&#151;&#145;no more shrinking or changing colour than if he were going to a banquet&#146;, says Walsingham&#151;to Tower Hill, followed all the way by a great throng who, according to the monk of Evesham, &#145;mourned him as much as they dared&#146;. His desire to be led along Cheapside may have been born of the hope that he might be rescued by the throng, but this was not to be. Walsingham reports that immediately following his execution, his headless body rose to its feet for as long as it took to recite the Lord's prayer, and that so persistent were the rumours of miracles at his grave&#151;in the church of the Augustinian friars in Bread Street&#151;that the king had his body exhumed and reburied at an unmarked spot.<br>
<br>Arundel's conviction for treason meant that all his estates, entailed or otherwise, as well as his vast personal wealth (which probably amounted to at least &pound;50,000), were forfeited to the king, and his heir disinherited. Following the deposition of Richard II in 1399, however, the judgment against him was reversed and his son and heir, Thomas Fitzalan, restored to his lands and titles. Arundel had at least eight children with his first wife: his first son Richard was alive in 1393 but predeceased him, his second, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9536/', "Thomas Fitzalan")</script>, became his heir, while William (<i>b</i>. after 1381) entered the church; his daughters were Elizabeth, who married first Sir William Montagu and second, in July 1384, Arundel's fellow appellant Thomas (I) Mowbray, earl of Nottingham; Eleanor, who married Robert, eldest son of William de la Pole, earl of Suffolk (they both died before 1376); Alice, who married John Charlton of Powys, and is said in a later pedigree to have been seduced by Henry Beaufort, bishop of Winchester; Joan, who married William Beauchamp, Lord Bergavenny; and Margaret, otherwise unknown. Countess Elizabeth died on 3 April 1385 and was buried in Lewes Priory. There were no children of Arundel's second marriage. In his will, dated 4 March 1393, he made generous bequests to the hospital of the Holy Trinity which he had founded for twenty paupers at Arundel, and the college of the Holy Trinity, for a master and twelve secular canons, which he also founded at Arundel, the statutes for which were approved in 1387. Despite his irascible and violent nature, and his tempestuous and often ill-judged political career, he was apparently a man of considerable personal piety. That he was a leading figure in the politics of Richard II's reign there can be no doubt, and although his own political career ended in disaster, the opposition to Richard's policies for which he stood, as well as his own reputation, were to be vindicated in the revolution of 1399 when the king was deposed.<br>
