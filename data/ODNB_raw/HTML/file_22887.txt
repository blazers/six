<span class="headword">Pulteney <span class="st"> [Neale]</span>, Sir  John</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1349), <span class="occ">merchant and mayor of London</span>, was probably the son of Adam Neale, or Neel, of Clipston in Leicestershire, rather than of Clipston in west Sussex, as has been suggested. His mother was Matilda Napton, daughter of a Warwickshire landowner. Pulteney was probably married twice, on both occasions to a wife called Margaret. He had married first by 1333, when he was granted permission to choose a confessor for himself and his wife, of whom little is otherwise known. He had married his second wife by 1341, when their son William was born. The second Margaret was the daughter of John St John of Lageham; within a year of being widowed she had married Sir Nicholas Loveyn. It is possible that Pulteney had a son of his first marriage, also named William, who predeceased him. He had a brother and a sister; the latter, Ellen, married William Owen and their son, Robert, inherited the family lands. Both his brother and sister predeceased him.<br>
<br>Pulteney was not a Londoner. Although the extent of the family lands suggests that the Pulteneys were among the substantial minor landowners of Leicestershire, he moved to the city from his family lands, probably in search of higher social status through the opportunities that trade afforded for enrichment and land purchase. He was established in London by 1316, when he was appointed attorney with Simon Swanlond, mayor from 1329 to 1330, for Ralph Walecote, a London merchant who was travelling overseas on pilgrimage; and he stood surety for Richard Bluntesham and William Flete, merchants of London, who were supplying corn to the royal fortresses of Berwick and Newcastle. He had achieved citizenship by May 1322.<br>
<br>Pulteney became a wealthy merchant who dealt in wool and wine and traded overseas. He was a draper and moneylender with extensive business dealings among the foreign merchants in London. He supplied the king's wardrobe and the royal army overseas in 1338. He lent money to merchants, clerics, minor gentry, knights, and nobles, including Sir William Zouche, the earl of Huntingdon, the earl of Kent, and the prior of the hospital of St John of Jerusalem in England. Throughout the 1330s and 1340s, moreover, Pulteney had a close financial involvement with the crown, making twenty-six loans between 1332 and 1347 to the exchequer of receipt. Many of these loans, which ranged from a few pounds to &pound;1100, were termed &#145;for the King's secret affairs&#146;. Often he acted as a guarantor for royal repayment of debts. It is not surprising that these close links with the crown benefited him. He was knighted in February 1337, and granted an annuity of 100 marks to support this knighthood. After 1326 he was regularly granted exemption from taxation and from royal and civic offices, and in 1341 he obtained a licence to crenellate his manor houses in Cambridgeshire, Kent, and London. Such closeness also had its dangers. In 1341 he was arrested when Edward III returned from France, and his conduct investigated for corruption or mismanagement. He was imprisoned in Somerton Castle, Lincolnshire, and only released in 1343.<br>
<br>Pulteney was alderman of Coleman Street ward (1327&#150;34), of Candlewick Street ward (1334), and of Vintry ward (1335&#150;8), and he may have been alderman of Farringdon ward in 1334 also. Mayor in 1331, 1332, 1334, and 1337, he represented the city at royal councils in 1328 and 1345; and in January 1329 he was appointed by the city to meet the king to assure him of London's loyalty in the aftermath of the rebellion of Henry, duke of Lancaster. In 1335, 1336, and 1340 he acted on behalf of the city in its dealings with the crown. He was appointed to array troops for the campaign in Scotland in 1335, and for the campaign in France in 1337, and in 1338 he was one of those entrusted with the organization of the city's defences. Pulteney was also frequently employed by the crown. Thus he was commissioned in 1332 to investigate the establishment of a wool staple at Bruges, in 1339 to investigate complaints concerning taxation and the decline in business at Westminster, and in 1343&#150;4 to audit the accounts of Italian merchant houses in England. For almost every year between 1332 and 1345 he was a commissioner of oyer and terminer. He was a royal envoy overseas in 1334, 1336, and 1338, and collector of customs and subsidies in London in 1343&#150;4.<br>
<br>At his death Pulteney held land in Cambridgeshire, Hertfordshire, Kent, Leicestershire, Middlesex, Northamptonshire, Suffolk, and Warwickshire. The great hall of his manor house at Penshurst Place in Kent is arguably the finest surviving example of mid-fourteenth-century domestic architecture. In London he held a number of small properties and two major ones: Pulteney's Inn, later called the Manor of the Rose, in St Lawrence's parish, which his wife and son inherited; and The Coldharbour in the parish of All Hallows-the-Great, which was sold at his death and became the residence of Edward, prince of Wales, until 1359. Pulteney died during the black death on 8 June 1349, although the cause of his death is unknown. Nor is it certain where he was buried, although Stow states that he was buried in the chantry chapel that he had endowed in St Paul's Cathedral. C. L. Kingsford argues that Pulteney was buried at St Lawrence's, Candlewick Street, as he requested in his will, and which the dean and chapter of St Paul's confirmed in 1439. Both in his will and during his lifetime Pulteney made many religious benefactions; these included the establishment of the chapel of Corpus Christi in St Lawrence's Church, Candlewick Street, the building of the church of All Hallows-the-Less, Thames Street, and his chantry at St Paul's Cathedral. The supervisors of his will were the earl of Huntingdon and the bishop of London. His son having died in 1367 without heir, the family property passed to his sister's family from whom William Pulteney, earl of Bath (<i>d</i>. 1764), the earls of Harborough, and the barons and earls of Crewe, were descended.<br>
