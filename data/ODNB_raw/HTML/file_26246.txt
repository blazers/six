<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Stanhope,  George</span>  (1660&#150;1728), <span class="occ">dean of Canterbury</span>, was born on 5 March 1660 in Hartshorne, Derbyshire, the thirteenth son of Thomas Stanhope (<i>d</i>. 1675), rector of Hartshorne, vicar of St Margaret's, Leicester, and chaplain to the earls of Chesterfield and Clare. His mother's maiden name was Allestry (or Allestree), and she was also from Derbyshire. Stanhope was educated at Uppingham School until 1667, when he entered Eton College. He was admitted into King's College, Cambridge, in 1677, became a fellow in 1680 and gained his BA in 1682 and his MA in 1685. He was vicar of Quy (Quoi), Cambridgeshire, in 1687&#150;8, vice-proctor in 1688, and rector of Tewin, Hertfordshire (1689&#150;1702). In 1689 he was given the vicarage of Lewisham in Kent by the earl of Dartmouth, having been his chaplain and tutor to the earl's son, and he continued to hold this post until his death. Stanhope was made chaplain to William and Mary in 1694 and continued in that post under Queen Anne and George I. He was incorporated at Oxford in 1696 and gained his DD in 1697. He became a Boyle lecturer in 1701, and continued to hold the position in 1702. Encouraged by Archbishop Thomas Tenison, he subsequently published his Boyle sermons, dedicating them to the primate.<br>
<br>In 1702 Stanhope was made vicar of St Nicholas, Deptford, in Kent and he was installed as dean of Canterbury on 23 March 1704. He was also the Tuesday lecturer at the church of St Lawrence Jewry until 1708, when he resigned. It was said that Queen Anne was considering promoting Stanhope or Robert Moss to the bishopric of Ely, but that she was prevented from giving either cleric the see by her death in 1714  (Nichols, <span class="italic">Lit. anecdotes</span>, 4.153). Stanhope married Olivia Cotton of Beresford, Stafford, and they had one son and five daughters. Olivia died on 1 June 1707. About 1709 Stanhope married Ann Parker, the daughter of Captain Alexander Parker and Prudence Wager. Thomas Hearne considered this marriage a scandal, as Stanhope's new wife was relatively young. Ann Stanhope outlived her husband, dying in 1730, aged fifty-four.<br>
<br>Stanhope had strong links with the high church. He and Dr Robert Moss both refused to preach a thanksgiving sermon before the lord mayor and aldermen on 5 December 1709, as a protest against the treatment the high-churchman Dr Henry Sacheverell had recently received for the inflammatory sermon he had delivered on 5 November 1709. Stanhope was also a member of the tory October Club, through which he was associated not only with Dr Sacheverell but also with the high-churchmen Joseph Trapp and Francis Atterbury. However, Stanhope was also friendly with low-churchmen, and was not as extreme as these high-flying divines. For example, in October 1705 Stanhope was nominated as prolocutor of the lower house of convocation by the moderate clergy, though on this occasion he was not chosen. Also when convocation met in February 1714, Francis Atterbury wanted the high-churchman Thomas Sprat to be made prolocutor rather than the more moderate and Hanoverian Stanhope. This time Stanhope was given the position. Thomas Hearne even called Stanhope a member of the low-church party, although this is unlikely.<br>
<br>Stanhope held the position of prolocutor twice more, and was involved in this capacity in the attempted censure of Bishop Benjamin Hoadly in 1717 for the principles he had expressed in his <span class="italic">Preservative</span> (1716) and his infamous sermon <span class="italic">The Nature of the Kingdom or Church of Christ</span> (1717). Stanhope, who objected to Hoadly's views, used his position as prolocutor to prevent Edward Tenison, one of Hoadly's supporters, from defending Hoadly by reading the schedule for prorogation in the middle of Tenison's speech. Tenison responded by publishing his full speech and criticizing Stanhope's actions in two pamphlets (1718). Stanhope replied to these criticisms, further denounced Hoadly's views, and defended the actions of the lower house in two pamphlets entitled <span class="italic">A Letter from the Prolocutor to the Reverend Dr Edward Tenison</span> (1718) and <span class="italic">The Report Vindicated from Misreports</span> (1718). It was for his role in the attack upon Hoadly that Stanhope was removed from the list of royal chaplains.<br>
<br>In 1718 Stanhope engaged in a correspondence with Francis Atterbury over a recent decrease in the number of baptisms, and these letters were published in 1758. Stanhope published the <span class="italic">Paraphrase and Comment upon the Epistles and Gospels</span> (vols. 1 and 2, 1705; vol. 3, 1706; vol. 4, 1708). This book was originally written for the use of Prince George; however, he died in 1700 before its publication. Stanhope translated many works, and was believed to have been the translator of <span class="italic">The Wisdom of Charron</span> (1697) and <span class="italic">The Maxims of Rochefoucault</span> (1706) though they both appeared anonymously. The publication of these two books prompted Dr Thomas Warton to assert that &#145;it appears a little strange that so orthodox a Divine as Stanhope should translate two books that are supposed to favour libertinism and scepticism&#146;  (Nichols, <span class="italic">Lit. anecdotes</span>, 4.155). Stanhope also published numerous sermons throughout his life, as well as his Boyle lectures. He was considered an excellent preacher, who delivered sermons on a number of public occasions and in front of the monarch. John Evelyn, who heard him preach a sermon in 1695 at Whitehall, wrote in his diary that &#145;This Mr Stanhop[e], is certainly one of the most accomplish[ed] preachers that in my life I ever heard, both for Matter, Eloquence, Action, Voice, Authority: &amp; one of an excellent Conversation as I am told&#146;  (Evelyn, 5.223).<br>
<br>George Stanhope died on 18 March 1728 at Bath, and was buried in the chancel of the church at Lewisham. A memorial was placed within the rails of the communion table of Lewisham church, and his widow erected a second memorial in the old church at Lewisham. In his will he left &pound;250 to Canterbury School to establish an exhibition for a scholar chosen by the dean and chapter of &pound;10 per annum to be held at King's College, Cambridge.<br>
