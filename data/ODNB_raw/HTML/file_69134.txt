<span class="headword">Tillam,  Thomas</span>  (<em>d.</em> in or before 1674), <span class="occ">Seventh Day Baptist minister</span>, was by his own testimony born a Roman Catholic, and in his youth travelled on the continent. Like many other Englishmen during the political and economic hardships of the 1620s and 1630s, Tillam had looked towards the New World and arrived in America on 29 June 1638. He commemorated his freedom with a poem, &#145;Uppon the First Sight of New-England&#146;, which still appears in anthologies of early American verse. Tillam returned to England during the revolutionary 1640s, spent some time in Wales, where he was ordained in an Independent church in Wrexham about 1648 or 1649, became a Baptist preacher at Hill Cliffe, Cheshire, where he may have met his wife, Jane, and eventually became a member of the Baptist church in London led by Hanserd Knollys. Tillam practised for some time as an apothecary, but seems to have distinguished himself in the Baptist community, for by the end of 1651 he was selected to be their &#145;messenger&#146; to the town of Hexham, about 20 miles up the River Tyne from Newcastle. He was also appointed to one of the puritan lectureships in the gift of the parliamentary commission for propagation of the gospel in the northern counties. Despite this promising start, by March 1653 Tillam was already under attack from the slightly older and neighbouring Baptist congregation at Newcastle, whose leaders prevailed upon the parent assembly in Coleman Street, London, to deny him the status of full pastor.<br>
<br>It was the scandal of the so-called False Jew of Hexham, however, that brought Tillam down and propelled him on his extravagant adventures. A man calling himself Joseph ben Israel had arrived in Hexham from Newcastle on 4 June 1653, claiming to be a Jew of the tribe of Judah, born in Mantua, conversant in eight languages, and educated in philosophy as well as the religion of his ancestors. Curiously, he also spoke English with a local accent, but Tillam did not think this linguistic talent significant at the time. Joseph told of his conversion to Christ and his wanderings through Europe, until he arrived one day in Hamburg and heard of the English Baptists. He made his way to Newcastle, he said, and lived for about a month at the home of Paul Hobson, the deputy governor of the town and one of the founders of the new Baptist congregation there. Hobson told Joseph that if he really wanted to become a Baptist, he might like to try the brethren at nearby Hexham. Tillam baptized Joseph only a few days after his arrival, in the wake of declarations and public confessions by this &#145;Jew&#146; who had &#145;seen the light&#146;. However, Joseph had arrived in Hexham with a letter of introduction from Hobson himself which also warned Tillam not to believe everything he was told by his latest spiritual conquest, and as soon as the report of Tillam's hasty baptism reached Newcastle it was announced that this supposed Italian Jew might actually be a certain <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/23097/', "Thomas Ramsay (alias Horsley)")</script>, who had just recently passed through the city. Tillam and Joseph were called to Newcastle to answer charges there at meetings held from 21 June 1653. Joseph's story soon began to unravel, its falsehood clinched by a misdirected letter from his mother, the wife of a Dr Alexander Ramsay of Scotland. Joseph-Horsley-Ramsay broke down and confessed to being a former student at various Scottish and continental universities, sent to England by the Jesuits to stir up trouble. Ramsay was imprisoned without trial in London for about six years, and two months before the Restoration was allowed to leave the country.<br>
<br>It was quite apparent that Tillam's mission to the north, while not quite a failure, had succeeded in bringing shame and disgrace to the Baptist movement as a whole. Yet he was allowed to remain in his post for another two and a half years, until doctrinal differences with the central congregation at Coleman Street led the Baptists in the first fortnight of November 1655 to replace Tillam with George Ritschel, the Bohemian divine then serving as chief master at the free school in Newcastle. Tillam's movements that winter are unknown, but the revelation in December 1655 of a genuine secret Jewish community in London must have brought back bitter memories. Notwithstanding, by May 1656 Tillam was baptizing dozens of converts in Colchester, where his community met in a ruined parish church, and a number of local aldermen successfully petitioned Cromwell himself that something more permanent be found for him in the town. Some time before the following January, however, Tillam underwent his final metamorphosis, and began proclaiming in the pulpit and in print that Saturday was the sabbath, and that at least on that score the Jews were correct. It was also at about this time that Tillam met Christopher Pooley, the Cambridge-educated Baptist and Fifth Monarchist, whose millenarian views Tillam enthusiastically shared. The two men travelled together in the last few years before the king's return, as Tillam preached the Saturday sabbath&#151;whose merits he argued in a debate at the Stone Chapel by St Paul's, London, in 1659&#151;and flirted with Quakerism. Between 1651 and 1660, Tillam published seven works, the most notable being his account of the &#145;False Jew&#146; episode which was printed in Newcastle in 1653.<br>
<br>Tillam was arrested along with many other old radicals at the Restoration, but he and Pooley managed to escape to the Netherlands. They returned to England in August 1661 in the company of a mysterious Dr Love. This was none other than Paul Hobson, the original magnet for the False Jew of Hexham, freshly ejected from his post as chaplain at Eton College and driven now to forget old quarrels and plot more dramatic action. The plan was to establish an &eacute;migr&eacute; sabbatarian colony in the Palatinate, and whereas Hobson was soon occupied with his own seditious affairs, Tillam and Pooley led an underground life in 1662 and 1663 and may have returned to the continent to promote their settlement. They were certainly back in England by the end of 1664 before they fled abroad again, and Pooley at least spent the second half of 1666 travelling in the north, trying to convince believers to join the continental colony and to subscribe to its sabbatarian covenant. A vessel with eight or nine passengers set sail in March 1668, bound for Tillam's little colony. According to English intelligence reports it had actually been established, at a monastery granted by Frederick William, the tolerant &#145;great elector&#146; of Brandenburg, and was thriving. The subsequent fate of his band of Saturday sabbatarians remains unknown; Tillam had died by 5 August 1674, when his death in Germany was reported by a London Seventh Day Baptist, Joseph Davis, to a Seventh Day Baptist congregation in Rhode Island.<br>
