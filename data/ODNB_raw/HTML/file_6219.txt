<span class="headword">Cooper,  Grey</span>  (<em>c.</em>1726&#150;1801), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was the eldest son of William Cooper, physician, of Newcastle upon Tyne, and Mary Grey of Alnwick. He received a legal education at the Middle Temple, London, and was called to the bar in 1751. On 5 October 1753 he married Margaret Grey (<i>d</i>. 1755), daughter of Sir Henry Grey, first baronet, of Howick. Following her death he married Elizabeth Kennedy (1733/4&#150;1809) of Newcastle upon Tyne on 19 July 1762; they had two sons and two daughters. In 1775 he assumed the baronetcy of the Coopers of Gogar, supposedly created in 1638, on the grounds that he was the great-grandson of the Revd James Cooper, brother of the second baronet, but both the title and his claim to it are disputed  (GEC, <span class="italic">Baronetage</span>, 2.446&#150;7).<br>
<br>By 1765, when Cooper entered politics, his legal practice was earning him an estimated &pound;1000 per annum. His advocacy of the duke and duchess of Atholl in their petition to sell their sovereignty of the Isle of Man made a strong impression in the House of Commons. The same year he defended the Rockingham administration in two pamphlets entitled <span class="italic">A Pair of Spectacles for Short-Sighted Politicians</span> and <span class="italic">The Merits of the New Administration Truly Stated</span> in response to the criticisms levelled in an anonymous pamphlet, <span class="italic">An Honest Man's Reasons for Declining to Take Any Part on the New Administration</span>, thought to have been written by Charles Lloyd, George Grenville's private secretary. These publications brought him to the attention of the administration and in October 1765 he was appointed secretary to the Treasury after protracted negotiations concerning his pension, for he wished to be fully compensated for the loss of his legal practice which he would have to give up on taking office. Rockingham granted him an annuity of &pound;500 per annum and engineered his election as MP for Rochester. Cooper continued as joint secretary to the Treasury for the next sixteen years under the successive governments of Pitt, the duke of Grafton, and Lord North, but he went out of office on the downfall of the last ministry in 1782. Under North he managed the electoral interests in the Cornish boroughs and the duchy revenues, but on the whole his business was restricted to financial matters. He represented Grampound from 1768 to 1774 and Saltash from 1774 to 1784, both in Cornwall, and he returned to office briefly as a lord of the Treasury in the Fox&#150;North coalition government. He failed to be nominated for the government seat of Saltash at the general election in 1784 and he was out of parliament until February 1786, when he was elected MP for Richmond on the Dundas interest. During the debates in 1787 on the commercial treaty with France he took an active part in the opposition and &#145;yielded to few in his accurate knowledge of the complicated interests which it included&#146;  (<span class="italic">Memoirs of &hellip; Wraxall</span>, 4.398). On this and Pitt's other financial measures he directed a keen and searching criticism. At the height of his career in the early 1780s his income from his office and accumulated sinecures earned him over &pound;5500 per annum. In addition he had managed to secure for his sons under a reversionary patent the post of auditor of the land revenue in virtually every county in England, which was worth about &pound;2000 per annum. Cooper did not stand for parliament in 1790 but he continued to be involved in politics and went over to Pitt in 1793. Hoping for return to office, he had to be content with his nomination in 1796 as a privy councillor. A volume of his verse dedicated to his friend the poet William Mason was published in 1780. Cooper died very suddenly at Worlington, Suffolk, on 30 July 1801, and was buried in the church there, where a monument was erected to his memory. His widow died at Worlington on 3 November 1809, aged seventy-five.<br>
