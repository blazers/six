<span class="headword">Gibbs <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Cox]</span>,  Olive Frances</span>  (1918&#150;1995), <span class="occ">local politician and political campaigner</span>, was born on 17 February 1918 at 1&#150;3 Christ Church Old Buildings, St Thomas's, Oxford, the daughter of Lazarus Cox, then a private in the Army Service Corps but in peacetime a letterpress printer, and his wife, Mary Ann, formerly Quarn. Her aunt delivered her. She was baptized in 1918 at St Thomas's Church and the Oxford high-church tradition was an important influence on her life. Hers was a comfortably off working-class family, with good housing and a steady income. She was frightened of her spasmodically violent father and learned from his dictatorial behaviour a lifelong considerateness and concern for the position of those like her browbeaten mother, whose family was partly of Portuguese extraction. She attended St Thomas's School, won a scholarship to Oxford high school, but preferred to hold it at Milham Ford School, where in due course she passed the school certificate in seven subjects but also set a record of thirty-seven detentions. In 1934 Mother Anna Verena, Olive's godmother, arranged a post for her in Juan-les-Pins, France, as a companion to a French girl in the hope that the change of climate would end Olive's pleurisy. Having learned good French, and in better health, she returned to Oxford in March 1936. Frustrated in her ambition to be a newspaper reporter, she then worked until October 1944 as a librarian at Oxford Central Library. She regularly attended mass at St Thomas's and was from time to time a Sunday school teacher. On 14 September 1940 she married Edmund Reginald Gibbs, son of R. W. M. Gibbs (a prominent left-wing councillor in Oxford) and his wife, Rose. Edmund Gibbs was later, after an unhappy time as a local government civil servant, company secretary to Headington (later Oxford) United, a successful chartered accountant in Oxford, and, like his wife, a prominent figure in the life of the city. The Gibbses moved in left-wing circles and causes in Oxford but without joining a political party. The births of their two sons, in 1944 and 1951, were separated by Edmund Gibbs's service in the Royal Artillery. Olive recalled that she &#145;hated pregnancy&#146;  (Gibbs, 110). Olive joined the Oxford City Labour Party not on the question of nuclear weapons or capital punishment, both of which she passionately opposed, but on an issue of school closures in 1952. She represented with considerable, though not total, success a group of mothers whose nursery schools were being closed by the tory council. In May 1953 she was elected councillor for West ward, which comprised a miscellany of political and class interests, and Oxford University Press and the area of Victorian artisan housing known as Jericho, in which Thomas Hardy set parts of <span class="italic">Jude the Obscure</span>. The frosty reception which her gender and her left-wing views provoked from her fellow Labour councillors made her ever welcoming to new political figures. Worried about her children's illnesses and unnerved by the challenges of public work in Oxford, and also, she believed, suffering a delayed reaction to her father's treatment of her, she suffered a nervous breakdown in 1954. She recovered from this, partly through working politically for M. R. D. Foot in a council by-election and partly through psychiatric treatment from Dr Sam Davidson.<br>
<br>Olive Gibbs's long career in local government was distinguished by two campaigns, in both of which she was successful. She and her husband led a revolt of six Labour councillors on the majority Labour group on the question of the building of a road through Christ Church meadows, one of the earliest proposals to raise the question of conservation priorities as against motor convenience in urban areas. The road was not built, and Olive was temporarily expelled from the Labour group in 1959. In the 1960s she successfully prevented the Jericho area from being demolished&#151;the fate that befell the similar Oxford area of St Ebbe's. Olive Gibbs was not a theoretical conservationist, but represented what became a much more general hostility to needless &#145;progress&#146;; in such campaigns she was prepared to work with whatever allies she could find, regardless of the party line. She retired from the city council in 1983 and from Oxfordshire county council in 1985, having sat on the latter for twelve years and been its first Labour chair (1984&#150;5). She was lord mayor of Oxford in 1974&#150;5 and 1982, and in 1985&#150;6 was lady mayoress, supporting her friend Roger Dudman, a widower. She was an energetic chair of the college of further education and a governor of Oxford Polytechnic.<br>
<br>Though for family reasons she declined to stand for parliament, Olive Gibbs played some part in national politics. In 1955 she was &#145;upset by Nye Bevan, horribly upset&#146; when he changed his position on the nuclear bomb  (Taylor, 282). She was one of the founders of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (CND) in 1958 and was a very active national chairwoman in 1964&#150;5, &#145;popular, hardworking, enthusiastic and committed&#146;  (Taylor and Pritchard, 14). She disapproved of direct action and, when students painted CND graffiti on college walls, she personally scrubbed it out. She became a firm friend of Michael Foot, of whom she remarked that &#145;we shared just about everything, except a sleeping bag.&#146; Her period in the chair coincided with the start of Wilson's Labour government; its failure to respond adequately to the demands of CND was a disappointment but not a surprise. On reflection, she concluded: &#145;after 1961, it was impossible to be committed both to the labour party and to CND and yet many of us attempted to do just that&#146;  (unpublished typescript).<br>
<br>Despite this wider involvement, Olive Gibbs's political skills were essentially local: she astutely understood the complex class and status issues of a university and manufacturing city such as Oxford, and she knew how to get her way. In 1989 she published her autobiography up to the 1950s, a lively and candid account. A cheery but not a boisterous personality in the Labour mould, she was short and in her latter years ample, with frizzy brown hair and green-brown eyes. A heavy smoker from the 1950s, she suffered from cancer and died of carcinoma of the lung caused by tobacco, on 28 September 1995 at 95 Iffley Road, Oxford, the Gibbs's home since 1953. Her husband and their two sons, Andrew and Simon, survived her.<br>
