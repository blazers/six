<span class="headword">Baltzar,  Thomas</span>  (<em>c.</em>1630&#150;1663), <span class="occ">violinist</span>, was the eldest child of David Baltzar (<i>d</i>. 1647), town musician of L&uuml;beck, and his wife, whom he married on 4 October 1630 but whose name is unknown. His father's family had been musicians for at least four generations. It is possible, as Tilmouth suggests, that he studied the violin with Gregor Zuber (a civic musician in L&uuml;beck from 1641) and composition with Franz Tunder. The composer-violinist Nicolaus Bleyer taught Thomas Baltzar's younger brother Joachim in L&uuml;beck, and (particularly given their shared interest in writing sets of divisions for solo violin) it seems likely that he also taught Thomas. To complicate matters further, a note (attributed to one Dreyer) in Samuel Hartlib's &#145;Ephemerides&#146; of 1656 claims that &#145;Hee lived under that famous Musitian and Componist of Hamburg Schoppius [Johann Schop], who hath scarce his like in all Europe&#146;. By 1653 Baltzar held a position at the Swedish court (and, in fact, it was probably here that he came under Schop's influence). There he must have met the English musicians who accompanied Bulstrode Whitelocke on his embassy to Sweden (1653&#150;4). Baltzar left Stockholm, presumably after Queen Kristina's abdication in June 1654, and returned to L&uuml;beck where, early in 1655, he was appointed <i>Ratslautenist</i>. Before long, however, he had moved to England, and it seems that it was his Swedish associations that took him there. Hartlib's &#145;Ephemerides&#146; (1656) twice describes him as being in the service of Count Christer Bonde, the Swedish ambassador who arrived on 27 July 1655. Baltzar stayed on after the ambassador's departure thirteen months later and was listed among the instrumentalists who performed in <span class="italic">The Siege of Rhodes</span> (originally planned for September 1656 but possibly not presented until 1659). According to Anthony Wood, from the summer of 1658 Baltzar was &#145;entertained by Sir Anthony Cope of Hanwell House, Banbury, Bart., with whom he continued about two years&#146;  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Wood D.19(4)). In 1658 he played in both Cambridge (at Benjamin Rogers' MusB degree ceremony) and, on several occasions, in Oxford. In 1661 he became a member of the king's private musick at the very favourable salary of &pound;110 per annum.<br>
<br>Several extended descriptions of his playing convey a sense of the impact Baltzar made in England. John Evelyn recorded in his diary for 4 March 1656 that:<blockquote>This night I was invited by Mr. <i>Rog: L'Estrange</i> to heare the incomperable <i>Lubicer</i> on the Violin, his variety upon a few notes &amp; plaine ground with that wonderfull dexterity, as was admirable, &amp; though a very young man, yet so perfect &amp; skillfull as there was nothing so crosse &amp; perplext, which being by our Artists, brought to him, which he did not at first sight, with ravishing sweetenesse &amp; improvements, play off, to the astonishment of our best Masters: In Summ, he plaid on that single Instrument a full Consort, so as the rest, flung-downe their Instruments, as acknowledging a victory.</blockquote>Anthony Wood heard him in Oxford two years later and was similarly impressed by his dexterity:<blockquote>A. W. did then and there, to his very great astonishment, heare him play on the violin. He then saw him run his fingers to the end of the finger-board of the violin, and run them back insensibly, and all with alacrity and in very good tune, which he nor any in England saw the like before. (<span class="italic">Life and Times of Anthony Wood</span>, 1.257)</blockquote>On this occasion John Wilson, the professor of music in Oxford (and described by Wood as the greatest judge of music that ever was) &#145;did, after his humoursome way, stoop downe to Baltzar's feet, to see whether he had a huff on, that is to say to see whether he was a devill or not, because he acted beyond the parts of man&#146;.<br>
<br>Inevitably, Baltzar was compared with his English confr&egrave;res. Evelyn pronounced that &#145;There were at that time as excellent in that profession as any were thought in Europ: <i>Paule Wheeler</i>, <i>Mr. Mell</i> and others, 'til this prodigie appeared &amp; then they vanish'd&#146;. Wood offered a more extended comparison:<blockquote>One Davis Mell was hitherto accounted the best in England for the violin but after Baltzar had shewed his parts, he by the generality [was] accounted better yet those that were proficient in music did acknowledge that Mell though he had not the ground or the command of his hand to run up and back the fingerboard yet he played sweeter far. (Bodl. Oxf., MS Wood D.19 (4))</blockquote>Baltzar's surviving compositions are musically interesting and indicate a more advanced technique than Mell's. His &#145;divisions&#146; (found in John Playford's <span class="italic">The Division Violin</span>, 1684) require the ability to move about the violin rapidly. Some of his other works reveal more of his virtuosity. Two movements in a C major suite for three violins (Bodl. Oxf., MSS mus. sch. D.241&#150;3) have rapid semiquaver scale passages ascending to <i>e</i>''', requiring the use of the fourth position (which to English observers in the 1650s might well have seemed as close &#145;to the end of the finger-board&#146; as a violinist might safely go). His D major suite for two violins and continuo bass (Bodl. Oxf., MS mus. sch. D.102) is quite similar in this respect, while his solo violin pieces  (Bodl. Oxf., MS mus. sch. F.573) demand facility in chord playing and string crossing. Baltzar wrote a number of pieces with <i>scordatura</i> (non-standard) tunings.<br>
<br>Baltzar was apparently a heavy drinker, and this (according to Wood) hastened his death on 24 July 1663. He was buried in the cloisters of Westminster Abbey.<br>
