<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Boileau, Sir  John Peter</span>  (1794&#150;1869), <span class="occ">antiquary</span>, was born at Hertford Street, London, on 2 September 1794, the eldest son of the John Peter Boileau (1747&#150;1837) and his wife, Henrietta (<i>d</i>. 1817), the daughter of the Revd George Pollen of Little Bookham, Surrey. His father, who had been a member of the council at Masulipatam, had returned to England in 1785 and invested his Indian earnings in the Tacolneston estate in Norfolk. The family was descended from Charles Boileau, baron of Castelnau and St Croix, a Languedoc Huguenot immigrant to England in 1691, and his French aristocratic origin, even more than his recent nabob inheritance, gave Boileau a taste for heraldry, genealogy, and antiquities, and a decidedly masterful streak of personality.<br>
<br>Boileau was educated at Merton College, Oxford (he matriculated in 1811 but did not take a degree), and at Edinburgh University. He was commissioned into the rifle brigade on 9 September 1813, and served under Lynedoch in the Netherlands, where he was present at the capture of Bergen-op-Zoom. On 14 November 1825 he married Lady Catherine Sarah Elliot (<i>d</i>. 1862), the third daughter of the first earl of Minto. He acquired Thursford Hall, near Fakenham, and then in 1836 the Ketteringham estate, where he built a spacious Gothic hall and resided from 1841. On 24 July 1838 he was created a baronet in the coronation honours. A prominent whig, Boileau was a county magistrate and a deputy lieutenant; he was high sheriff of Norfolk in 1844.<br>
<br>In London Boileau was connected with many learned and charitable organizations and at various times served as a vice-president of, among others, the Archaeological Institute, the British Association, the Royal Institution, the Society of Arts, the Statistical Society, and the Zoological Society. He was elected FRS on 1 June 1843.<br>
<br>Wealthy and civilized, Boileau was a learned antiquary with a keen interest in local, especially Roman, history. His estates included the site of the large Roman fort Garianonum, at Burgh Castle, just over the Suffolk border, near Great Yarmouth. He was a founding vice-president of the Norfolk and Norwich Archaeological Society, and its president from 1849. He published a number of papers in <span class="italic">Norfolk Archaeology</span> (volumes 5 and 7), and commissioned from Joseph Hunter a monograph on Ketteringham published in the same journal (3, 1852, 245&#150;314) and reprinted for private distribution. He was elected a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries on 9 December 1852, and served two four-year terms as a vice-president of the society between 1858 and 1867.<br>
<br>Boileau's diligent local service and cultivated metropolitan activity are reflected in his diary, now in the Norwich City Library. This was skilfully drawn on in 1960 by Owen Chadwick, whose <span class="italic">Victorian Miniature</span> portrays a strong personality of pious disposition and a high sense of pastoral responsibility to his rural tenantry. By way of contrast Chadwick also had the use of the diary (in private hands) of William Wayte Andrew, the evangelical vicar of Ketteringham. Andrew was as proud-spirited a minister to his flock as his squire was a paternal governor of his broad acres. The contrasting journals provide an unusually detailed vignette of acrimonious relations between mansion and parsonage, but one which nevertheless confirms Boileau's high contemporary reputation in antiquarian circles.<br>
<br>Boileau, who died at Torquay on 9 March 1869, was buried at Ketteringham. He had four sons and five daughters; his second son, Francis George Manningham Boileau, succeeded him in the baronetcy and estates.<br>
