<span class="headword">Dawes <span class="st"> [<em>married name </em> de Feuch&egrave;res]</span>,  Sophie</span>, Baroness de Feuch&egrave;res in the French nobility  (1792&#150;1840), <span class="occ">adventuress and courtesan</span>, was the daughter of Richard Daw or Dawes, a drunken fisherman and smuggler of St Helens, Isle of Wight, and Jane Callaway. Her parents were probably not married, her mother being recorded as a spinster on her death certificate. Sophie (or Sophia as her name was often given) was one of ten children, of whom only four grew up, and who were taken into &#145;public charity&#146; in the house of industry (or workhouse) in Newport, Isle of Wight. As a child she helped her father by picking winkles on the beach. Nine years later she was servant to a local farmer and then seems to have gone to Portsmouth as a chambermaid at the George Hotel. Next she went to London, where she became a milliner's assistant, but was dismissed when she became involved with a water carrier. Like Nell Gwyn, she sold oranges at Covent Garden and is reputed to have appeared briefly on the boards there. Later she became the mistress of an army officer who set her up in a house in Turnham Green, giving her an income of &pound;50 a year when the liaison ended. She sold this annuity to pay for an education at a school in Chelsea. Falling on hard times, she became a servant at a house of ill-repute in Piccadilly, where the servant of Louis Henri Joseph, the duke of Bourbon, pointed her out to his master, who subsequently &#145;won&#146; her in a bet on a card game with the earl of Winchilsea and the duke of Kent. The liaison with Bourbon began in 1810, and by 1811 he had taken a house for her and her mother, to whom she always remained close, in Gloucester Street, Queen Square, in London. She studied with the Abb&eacute; Briant, her lifelong mentor, to make herself acceptable to the society in which she meant to move. Her exercise books, showing great prowess, were still extant when Billault was writing about her about 1870. By 1812 she had &pound;800 a year from Bourbon, who lived in Paris as well as in London. He grew tired of Sophie and departed to Spain to try to be rid of her, allying himself to another Englishwoman, a Miss Harris. Sophie went to Paris to await his return and managed to wheedle her way back into the favour of her &#145;poor dear&#146; as she called him when speaking both English and French. In 1817 she was baptized a Roman Catholic. The duke then contrived her marriage in London on 6 August 1818 to an officer in the French royal guard, Adrien Victor de Feuch&egrave;res, Baron de Feuch&egrave;res, who was led to believe that Sophie was Bourbon's illegitimate daughter. At the time of the marriage, which was conducted in a protestant ceremony in St Martin-in-the-Fields and in a Catholic one at St James's, Spanish Place, she falsely made herself out to be the widow of William Dawes and the daughter of one Richard Clarck, all of which subterfuges were later to make matters of inheritance difficult. Bourbon made a settlement of 214,000 francs on her at the time of the marriage. By 1822 her husband had discovered the true state of affairs and parted from his wife, returning her dowry, a judicial separation following five years later. Louis XVIII, on hearing of the situation from the baron, banned her from court. The liaison with Bourbon continued despite her lowly origins and bullying nature, both parties being said to be &#145;mediocre in everything&#146; and Sophie being reputed to take coarse lovers of her own original social standing. In order to re-establish herself in court society, Sophie started to ingratiate herself with the king's relatives. First she approached the duke of Berri, who was the king's nephew. When this failed, she approached the duke of Orl&eacute;ans, a nephew of Bourbon's wife, who died about this time. Bourbon was not fond of his relatives, whom he considered renegade, but was by now old and weak and succumbed to Sophie's machinations to accept the son of Orl&eacute;ans, the duke of Aumale, as his godson. But he was not yet prepared to name him his heir, as she wished. However by 30 August 1829 she coerced Bourbon into signing a will which left 2 million francs to herself, along with estates of St Leu, Montmorency, Enghien, Mortefontaine, and le Boissy, the remainder of the estate to go to Aumale. By now Charles X had succeeded his brother Louis, and in February 1830 readmitted Sophie to court, recognizing her liaison with Bourbon unofficially. Bourbon was unhappy, and said he was sure that once Sophie and others had obtained from him all that they wanted his life could be at risk. Sophie was an accepted hostess, known as the Queen of Chantilly and La Montespan of St Leu, with whom Talleyrand often dined; his nephew, the marquess of Chabannes, married Mathilda Dawes, who was Sophie's niece. Her nephew, James Dawes, was given a position in the Bourbon household and the lands and title of baron of Flassons.<br>
<br>The revolution of 1830 altered Bourbon's attitude to his country and he, at the age of seventy-four, made plans to leave for Switzerland, possibly revoking his will. An important letter to Sophie from the new king, Louis Philippe d'Orl&eacute;ans, Aumale's father, begged her to prevent this flight &#145;at all costs&#146;, presumably to ensure the considerable financial succession. On 26 August Bourbon was at St Leu and passed a pleasant evening playing whist, asking his servant to call him at eight the next day. In the morning he was found dead in his room attached to the handle of the french window by two handkerchiefs. Many and various rumours were generated by conflicting evidence at the post-mortem inquiry, where it was proved, for instance, that the duke was by now so feeble that he could not tie his own shoelaces let alone hang himself. To some Sophie was guilty of, if nothing worse, conniving at the death from her room on an adjoining and easily accessible staircase, and she might even have been placed under arrest had not it been for intervention, it was supposed, by the king, the judges deciding that there was no case for prosecution. Whether or not the king's letter played any part is open to speculation, the letter eventually being sent back to the king and later vanishing from the collection of documents about the case in his sister's possession. Bourbon's will was contested by the De Rohans, collateral heirs, on grounds of undue influence, but this also failed. Sophie became estranged from the Orl&eacute;ans when they disregarded a bequest of Bourbon to provide for a charitable institution for old Vend&eacute;ean soldiers at &Eacute;couen, and finding Paris uncomfortable as a residence she moved to a house she had built at Bure Homage in Hampshire, with a leasehold house at 5 Hyde Park Square also. She gradually disposed of her considerable French estates. She became dropsical and died of that illness on 15 December 1840 at 18 Great Cumberland Street (later Place), London, and was buried at Kensal Green cemetery on 22 December. She was worth, it was said, &pound;500,000, although the total of personal assets in the English probate was at one time reckoned at &pound;140,000. There was much disputation about her will and her legitimacy. Eventually James Daw or Dawes, her brother, received &pound;70,000; Mary Ann Clark, her sister, &pound;70,000; and the Paris hospitals to which her husband assigned his share, &pound;13,000. The remainder went to (Mary) Charlotte Thanaron or Tanceron, who had lived with her for some time and who was the daughter of her sister Charlotte, who had become insane, and a retired French army officer.<br>
<br>Sophie's place is more in the history of France than in English society, although <span class="italic">The Times</span> carried details of her career when reporting a court case of Mary Clark's lawyer suing for his fees in 1843. Sophie was described as being of an inflexible character, seeking only social and financial success, though astute; she was pretty but not beautiful, with flashing dark eyes, tall, and squarely built, with arms and legs which &#145;could have served as models for a statue of Hercules&#146;.<br>
