<span class="headword">Sullivan,  John William</span> <span class="st"> [Jacobite Sir John Sullivan]</span>  (<em>b. </em><em>c.</em>1700, <em>d.</em> in or after 1760), <span class="occ">Jacobite army officer</span>, was born in co. Kerry; details of his parentage are unknown. He is said to have been descended from the O'Sullivans of Munster, but consistently spelled his name Sullivan. At the age of nine he was sent to France to study for the Catholic priesthood, but in 1721 he instead entered the French army under the patronage of Marshal Maillebois. Subsequently Sullivan served under Maillebois in Corsica, Italy, and on the Rhine, gaining considerable experience of irregular warfare and eventually becoming a captain on the general staff. On the strength of this useful experience the stoutly built professional soldier was offered a colonel's commission to act as military adviser to the Jacobite heir, Prince Charles Edward Stuart, in 1745. Shortly after the prince landed in Scotland, Sullivan's position was formalized by his appointment as adjutant-general and quartermaster-general in the Jacobite army. As such he was primarily responsible for drafting orders, and for drawing up the elaborate marching tables which enabled the prince's forces to move swiftly in dispersed columns and to evade the British army's attempts to intercept them. Unfortunately, however, he clashed from the first with Lord George Murray, one of the Jacobite lieutenant-generals, who afterwards accused him of incompetence and blamed him for much of what went wrong during the campaign. Sullivan's own account (not published until 1938) and a number of surviving regimental orderly books reveal the reverse to be the case. Sullivan was, in fact, a very capable and professional staff officer, but it cannot be denied that he went out of his way to be condescending towards Murray, whom he considered with good reason to be an impetuous amateur.<br>
<br>At the outset of the campaign Sullivan was involved in an attempt to capture Ruthven barracks, near Kingussie&#151;successfully defended by another Irishman, Sergeant Terry Molloy, and just twelve men. He was rather more successful with his friend Donald Cameron of Lochiel in seizing Edinburgh by a <i>coup de main</i> on 16 September 1745. He was present at the battle of Prestonpans, but after reaching Manchester he grew increasingly pessimistic about the invasion of England. He did not take part in the crucial council of war at Derby, when the decision was taken to return to Scotland, but wholeheartedly supported it, and in his narrative is critical of the prince's behaviour at this time. At both the battles of Falkirk on 17 January 1746 and Culloden on 16 April he was in effective command of the Jacobite army, since both lieutenant-generals present simply acted as brigade commanders and the prince was no more than a passive spectator. Having escaped to the continent after Culloden, Sullivan was knighted for his services by the Jacobite King James VIII and III and again served on the French staff at the battle of Lauffeldt on 21 June 1747. Despite being very close to Prince Charles during the Jacobite rising and having been largely instrumental in arranging his rescue, Sullivan became estranged from the prince shortly afterwards. This was due to persistent rumours that Sullivan had shared Charles's mistress, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28523/', "Clementine Walkinshaw (c.1720&#150;1802)")</script>, whom he had met at Falkirk in 1746. He was living in Cambrai in the summer of 1752. He is last heard of in 1760.<br>
<br>The date of Sullivan's death is unknown, but he had married a Miss Fitzgerald and left a son, <a name="cosubject_20915"></a><span class="headword">Thomas Herbert Sullivan</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1824), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, who was commissioned in the Franco-Irish regiment Walsh. In 1779 he served with a detachment of the regiment assigned as marines on board John Paul Jones's privateer <i>Bon Homme Richard</i>. He took part in the famous fight with the <i>Serapis</i> off Flamborough Head on 23 September 1779. Subsequently, however, he deserted to the British army and then transferred to the Dutch service, dying a major at The Hague in 1824. Thomas Sullivan's son John, employed in the American consular service, died in 1825.<br>
