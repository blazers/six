<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Ormerod,  George</span>  (1785&#150;1873), <span class="occ">county historian</span>, was born in High Street, Manchester, on 20 October 1785, the only (and posthumous) son of George Ormerod (1757&#150;1785) of Bury, Lancashire, who had died thirteen days earlier. His mother was Elizabeth (1752&#150;1822), daughter of Thomas Johnson of Manchester and Tyldesley and his wife, Susanna Wareing of Bury. He was initially educated privately, probably at Ardwick Green, Manchester, but in July 1798 was sent to King's School, Chester, of which a family friend, the Revd Thomas Bancroft, was a former headmaster. From 1793 Bancroft had been vicar of Bolton, Lancashire, and in 1799 he agreed to take Ormerod as a private pupil. Ormerod remained at Bolton vicarage until midsummer 1803, receiving a thorough classical education. He matriculated from Brasenose College, Oxford, on 21 April 1803, graduated BA in 1806, received the honorary degree of MA in 1807 and that of DCL in 1818, the last being in recognition of his recently published history of Cheshire.<br>
<br>On his twenty-first birthday Ormerod came into his inheritance, including the extensive estates in south Lancashire left by his paternal grandparents and his mother's family. On 2 August 1808 he married, at Sandbach, Cheshire, Sarah (1784&#150;1860), daughter of Dr John Latham MD, and his wife, Mary Mayer; Sarah was the sister of John Latham, a college friend. Between 1809 and 1828 the couple had seven sons, including the anatomist <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20839/', "William Piers Ormerod")</script>, and three daughters; the youngest child, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35329/', "Eleanor Anne Ormerod (1828&#150;1901)")</script>, became a distinguished entomologist.<br>
<br>During 1808 the Ormerods lived at Rawtenstall, but in 1809 they moved to Great Missenden, Buckinghamshire. By this time Ormerod&#151;who had had a passion for genealogy and an interest in local history from his schooldays&#151;was involved in extensive research for his history of Cheshire. To make the task easier, he decided to move back north, and in 1811 he bought the 83 acre Chorlton House estate, 4 miles from Chester. From then until 1817 the family spent the summers there, living in London during the winter so that Ormerod could conduct research in the British Museum. In Chester Castle he made use of a large collection of original documents, and a valuable loan of books and documents was made to him by Hugh Cholmondeley, dean of Chester, whose assistance and sympathy Ormerod warmly acknowledged. Ormerod also borrowed material extensively from leading county families, using introductions from Cholmondeley as well as his own social connections. Although he supervised the research, and was self-taught in palaeography, most of the transcribing was undertaken by his research assistant the Revd J. Eaton, and by Faithful Thomas, the deputy keeper of the records at Chester Castle. Ormerod himself made lengthy tours of the county and claimed to have visited every township at least once, and to have made copious notes on the spot.<br>
<br>The resulting work was entitled <span class="italic">The history of the county palatine and city of Chester &hellip; incorporated with a republication of King's Vale Royal and Leycester's Cheshire antiquities</span>, and it appeared in ten parts, forming three volumes, between 1816 and 1819. A second edition, revised and enlarged by Thomas Helsby, wholly independently of Ormerod's family, was published in parts during 1875&#150;82.<br>
<br>Ormerod's history of Cheshire is a classic antiquarian county history. He wrote only between a quarter and a third of each volume, the remainder being lengthy transcripts of documents, and reprinted portions of earlier printed works. The <span class="italic">History</span> was very enthusiastically received at the time, and was well regarded for many years afterwards, although some doubting voices were heard at an early stage. The great Yorkshire historian Joseph Hunter described it in 1822 as &#145;a succession of facts detached, a rope of sand&#146;  (Hess, 62), while the editor of the second edition of the work, Thomas Helsby, felt that &#145;the swelling stems of genealogy were permitted to have all their own way&#146;  (Helsby, xvi). Ormerod himself deliberately excluded all reference to commerce, industry, and urbanization as being outside the scope of his work, and his emphasis was thus heavily towards family history, manorial history, and antiquarian topography.<br>
<br>After the completion of the work on Cheshire, in the autumn of 1817, Ormerod immediately left the county and never again lived in the north of England. In 1823 Chorlton House was sold and in the same year Ormerod inherited important property, mining, and financial interests from his uncle Thomas Johnson. With this increased wealth he was able, in 1825, to buy the 208 acre Barnesville estate at Sedbury, Gloucestershire, on the narrow peninsula between the Severn and Wye estuaries. He renamed the property Sedbury Park, and lived there from 1828 until his death. He was appointed a JP for Gloucestershire in 1827 and for Monmouthshire in 1830, and served as deputy lieutenant for the former in 1861, but otherwise his role in county administration was limited.<br>
<br>As a leading county historian, Ormerod was a founder member of the Historic Society of Lancashire and Cheshire (1848) and of the Chester Archaeological Society (1849). He was a council member of the Chetham Society from its foundation in 1843 until 1846. For this society he edited, among other works, <span class="italic">Lancashire Civil War Tracts</span> (1844), which is probably of more lasting value than his history of Cheshire. After 1819, with the exception of the <span class="italic">Lancashire Civil War Tracts</span>, Ormerod's output was drastically diminished and, although he made a number of contributions to the transactions of learned societies in the north-west, little of significance emerged. After his move to Gloucestershire he became particularly interested in the antiquities and Roman history of the Sedbury area, and in Offa's Dyke, which has its southern end close to Sedbury Park. He published a series of books and papers on these subjects between 1850 and 1861, culminating in <span class="italic">Strigulensia</span> (1861), a volume on the archaeology of the district between the Severn and the Wye.<br>
<br>Ormerod was thus a prosperous leisured gentleman with a genuine and abiding interest in antiquarian history and archaeology: his researches were undertaken in part to &#145;avert the irksomeness of superabundant leisure&#146; but also because of a &#145;decided predilection&#146; for the subject. His character was remembered by his niece Dorothy Latham: &#145;an autocrat in his own family and intolerant of any shortcomings or failings that came under his notice &hellip; The family discipline was strict, the younger children were expected to yield obedience to the elders&#146;  (Latham, 14). As he grew old his sight began to fail, and for the last few years of his life he was blind. He died on 9 October 1873 at Sedbury Park, Beachley, and was buried with his wife at Tidenham, Gloucestershire, on 15 October.<br>
