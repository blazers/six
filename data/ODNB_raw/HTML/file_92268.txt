<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Shawcross,  Hartley William</span>, Baron Shawcross  (1902&#150;2003), <span class="occ">barrister, politician, and businessman</span>, was born on 4 February 1902 at Giessen, a small university town in Germany, the elder son (there were no daughters) of John Shawcross (1871&#150;1966), lecturer in English literature at Giessen, and his Danish wife, Hilda Constance, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Asser (<i>d</i>. 1942), an ardent suffragette. While still an infant he was brought to England, living first near Oxford and then on Clapham Common, although a cottage in the heart of Ashdown Forest was, in his own words, &#145;the real family home&#146;  (Shawcross, 13). At first privately tutored at home, at the age of twelve he gained entrance to Dulwich College. He joined the Labour Party in 1918 and served as ward secretary for Wandsworth Common, and in 1922 as the official election agent for Lewis Silkin, later a fellow minister in the Attlee government.<br>
<br>Unwilling to follow his father to Oxford, Shawcross decided to become a doctor but spent a gap year at Geneva University studying French. When in 1923 the Second Socialist International convened in Geneva, he boldly offered his services as translator, and so became a prot&eacute;g&eacute; of Herbert Morrison, who urged him to forsake medicine for the law as being the better route into politics. He joined Gray's Inn, and in 1925 came top of his year in bar finals, winning the certificate of honour. Briefless in London (supporting himself by coaching Malay princes for the bar examinations, one of whom became the first prime minister of Malaysia), in 1927 he moved to Liverpool. There he became a part-time lecturer in law at Liverpool University. Ensuring that his lectures took place at a time convenient to his court work, he joined the northern circuit in the chambers of David Maxwell Fyfe, the future home secretary and lord chancellor.<br>
<br>A rising star at the provincial bar, in 1933 Shawcross became head of his own set at 43 Castle Street, Liverpool (where the members included Rose Heilbron), while also a door tenant at 1 Hare Court in the Temple. In 1939 he took silk, and became a master of the bench of Gray's Inn. With a fixed place in the legal firmament he practised thereafter exclusively from London chambers. He gained judicial experience as an assistant chairman of east Sussex quarter sessions in 1941, recorder of Salford from 1941 to 1945, and recorder of Kingston upon Thames from 1946 to 1951.<br>
<br>Immediately after the outbreak of the Second World War, Shawcross became chairman of the enemy aliens tribunal for the Golders Green&#150;Hampstead area. A member of the emergency reserve of officers since 1937, he was dissuaded by the Admiralty from taking a commission in the navy. In 1940 he became legal adviser to the regional commissioner (a crown appointee whose role was to co-ordinate the machinery of government and liaise with the military) for the south-east region, and soon afterwards a deputy commissioner. Between 1942 and 1945 he was regional commissioner for the north-west region. From 1940 to 1945 he was independent chairman of the Kent district coalmining board. In 1943 he became chairman of the Catering Wages Commission, and sought to improve conditions for workers in the industry. Multi-tasking, in the jargon of a later era, was a constant theme of his professional life.<br>
<br>Returning to the bar after the war, Shawcross was approached by various constituency parties in the north-west, where his reputation had grown during his years as a commissioner, to become a candidate (not all in the same interest, for his particular socialist sympathies, the product more of emotion than of economics, had not been widely publicized for some twenty years). He chose to become Labour candidate for the St Helen's constituency, and duly won the seat in the general election of July 1945.<br>
<br>Appointed in August 1945 attorney-general in the first Attlee government, Shawcross was the lead British prosecuting counsel in the Nuremberg trials (assisted by two future lord chancellors, Maxwell Fyfe and Elwyn Jones). He made memorable opening and closing speeches, the latter described by the writer Rebecca West as &#145;full of a living pity which gave the men in the box their worst moment&#146;  (R. West, <span class="italic">A Train of Powder</span>, 1955, 21). Decades later he spoke out in the House of Lords against what became the <span class="roman">War Crimes Act</span> (1991), which conferred jurisdiction on United Kingdom courts to try persons suspected of war crimes in Nazi Germany. In his view the identification of suspects, difficult enough after five days, would be all but impossible after fifty years.<br>
<br>As attorney-general, Shawcross was active on the crown's behalf in litigation, pursuing a tradition which waned in the years after his departure from office and was only intermittently revived. Abandoning the practice by which fees were paid in addition to the attorney-general's salary, he arranged with the Treasury for the latter to be fixed at &pound;10,000 per annum&#151;the equivalent of the prime minister's. After initial demur, in 1945 he accepted the knighthood which then conventionally went with the office and in June 1946 he was made a privy councillor. He prosecuted William Joyce (Lord Haw-Haw) and John Amery for treason, Alan Nunn May and Klaus Fuchs for disclosure to Russia of British nuclear secrets, and John George Haigh, the so-called &#145;acid bath murderer&#146;. In 1948 he represented Britain at the International Court of Justice in The Hague in a case arising from the mining by Albania of British ships in the Corfu channel. He was widely recognized as the finest advocate of his generation.<br>
<br>In 1948 Shawcross took the lead role in the Lynskey tribunal into suspected corruption amongst civil servants and government ministers. His characteristically devastating cross-examination of Sydney Stanley, one of the key suspects, prompted the latter to exclaim, &#145;Sir Hartley, you are trying to trick me with the truth&#146;  (A. Smith, address at memorial service). While his public profile was raised, so was the level of suspicion of him in the Labour Party, and such suspicion was further increased in 1951 by his prosecution for conspiracy of communist strike leaders in the docks. He also incurred the enmity of Hugh Dalton, a witness, who referred to him as &#145;Sir Peacock&#146;. His critics were unsympathetic to the constitutional principle sometimes known as &#145;the Shawcross doctrine&#146;, that an attorney-general's decisions on prosecution had to be taken independently of governmental instructions. He was offered but declined the chance to become lord chief justice in 1946, and master of the rolls in 1949. Lord Goddard, who served in the former position from 1946 to 1958, privately favoured him as his successor, but with the advent of a series of Conservative administrations his chance had passed.<br>
<br>On the political front, Shawcross led in 1946 in the Commons on the repeal of the trade union legislation of 1927 and spoke in favour of the nationalization of the coal industry, with which he had become familiar in representing in 1937 the pit owners at an inquiry into the gas explosion at the Gresford colliery in 1934. He was best remembered for his&#151;frequently misquoted and abbreviated&#151;observation in his winding-up speech on the third reading of the former bill, &#145;We are the masters at the moment. And not only at the moment but for a very long time to come&#146;  (Shawcross, 141&#150;2). In 1946 he made an attack on the press barons lords Kemsley and Beaverbrook, for which Attlee compelled him to apologize. His aggressive forensic skills were not always shown to their best advantage in the political arena. From 1945 to 1949 he served as a principal British delegate to the peripatetic United Nations assembly. In consequence, in April 1951 he was considered (but rejected by Attlee, who was averse to having a lawyer in that position) as a possible successor to Ernest Bevin as foreign secretary. Instead he became president of the Board of Trade. His promotion to the cabinet compensated for the halving of his income.<br>
<br>After the general election of October 1951, when he participated in the first televised election broadcast, but unwilling to oppose tory economic policies with which he essentially agreed, Shawcross declined to shadow his old department and became a shadow spokesman on foreign affairs. His attendance in the House of Commons became increasingly sparse, and he resumed in lieu a highly successful legal practice. He represented the <span class="italic">Daily Mirror</span> against Winston Churchill's claim for libel for the newspaper's headline &#145;Whose hand on the trigger?&#146;, but later had Churchill himself as a (non-paying) client and friend. A projected profile by Woodrow Wyatt, &#145;Man or superman&#146;, for the <span class="italic">Sunday Express</span> in 1953, which might have been perceived (unfairly) as breaching the bar's code of conduct against self-advertisement, was never published because of Churchill's intervention with Lord Beaverbrook. He was chairman of the bar council from 1954 to 1957 and treasurer of Gray's Inn in 1954.<br>
<br>In 1956 some of his Labour Party colleagues pressed Shawcross to contest the party leadership, but he would not stand against his old patron, Morrison, even though he realized that Morrison's was a lost cause. Furthermore, he was by now moving rapidly to the right&#151;or, as he put it, &#145;my political opinions became more mature&#146;  (Shawcross, 232). He was against unofficial strikes and nationalization, and in favour of moral values, lower taxation, and a strong relationship between the United Kingdom and the USA. He was never shy to promulgate his views in articles for and letters written to newspapers. His lifestyle was that of a champagne socialist. He enjoyed the benefits of an apartment in London, a country house (Friston Place, a grade one listed building in Sussex), a yacht (his hobby was sailing), two cars, horses, nannies, and staff, and described his existence with a degree of meiosis as &#145;not living in a particularly modest way&#146;  (ibid., 223). From 1953 he was a member of the Other Club. He had realistic hopes of the woolsack had Hugh Gaitskell become prime minister. (Woodrow Wyatt later commented waspishly in his diaries, &#145;I had the impression that the only person Hartley thought would have been suitable as Lord Chancellor in this lifetime was himself&#146;  (<span class="italic">Journals of Woodrow Wyatt</span>, 1.379).) However, in 1958 he decided to quit both politics and the bar. He resigned his seat and in 1959 became a cross-bench life peer, as Baron Shawcross, of Friston, Sussex.<br>
<br>It was Bernard Levin (not Churchill) who dubbed Shawcross &#145;Sir Shortly Floorcross&#146;, but he never became a card-carrying Conservative. From the early 1950s he was an instinctive coalitionist but, while showing an interest in the new Social Democratic Party in the early 1980s, he ended up a devotee of Margaret Thatcher. He was not the only man of the left whose political pilgrimage reached the same destination. He based the latter part of his career in the City. He became a director of many blue-chip companies, including Ford, Rank Hovis McDougall, Hawker Siddeley, and Thames Television Ltd (of which he was chairman from 1969 to 1974), as well as being special adviser to Morgan Guaranty Trust of New York between 1965 and 1994. He also became a classic establishment figure with what he called a parcel of &#145;odd-jobs&#146;&#151;chancellor of Sussex University (1965&#150;85), governor of Dulwich College, chairman of the Panel on Takeovers and Mergers (1969&#150;80), chairman of the Press Council (1974&#150;78), and chairman of Justice (1956&#150;72). He was the recipient of nine honorary degrees and sundry other distinctions, including, reflecting his adolescent ambitions, honorary membership of two royal medical colleges.<br>
<br>Shawcross's public success was not always mirrored in his private life. A handsome man, he was always attracted by (and attractive to) women&#151;a flirt, but never promiscuous. On 24 May 1924 he married, at St Joseph's Roman Catholic church, Romford, Alberta Rosita Shyvers, the 23-year-old sister of a fellow Gray's Inn student, and daughter of William Shyvers, ship broker; she became a chronic invalid. In his autobiography he revealed that in consequence he had never had sexual relations with her. In 1943 she died of an overdose. On 21 September 1944 he married, at Rotherfield parish church in Sussex, Joan Winifred Mather, aged twenty-six, the only daughter of Hume Mather, a Yorkshire banker. She had been his wartime driver. They had two sons, William and Hume, and a daughter, Joanna. Tragically, Joan Shawcross died in a riding accident in 1974. In his last decade Shawcross's increasing incapacity compelled his family to put him under the care of the court of protection. His third marriage, on 18 April 1997, to Susanne Monique Huiskamp (<i>d</i>. 2013), the former wife of Bob Huiskamp, which his family opposed, was for that reason contracted in Gibraltar. He died on 10 July 2003 at Cowbeech Farm, Cowbeech, near Hailsham, Sussex, and was survived by his third wife and the three children of his second marriage. He was buried at St Andrew's Church, Jevington, next to his second wife. A memorial service was held at St Clement Danes on 4 February 2004.<br>
<br>Shawcross had a career of both brilliant achievement and unfulfilled promise. Identified at various junctures of his life as a candidate for the highest political and legal offices in the land, he attained none of them. His self-deprecatory memoirs, <span class="italic">Life Sentence</span> (1995), written in his ninetieth year, suggest a wistful, though not painful, awareness of the limits of his considerable success. But if, for all his many achievements, he could fairly be described as the &#145;nearly man&#146; of British law and British politics in the mid-twentieth century, few, if any, of his contemporaries came so close to the top of both trees.<br>
