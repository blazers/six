<span class="headword">Cokayne, Sir  William</span>  (1559/60&#150;1626), <span class="occ">merchant</span>, was the second of the seven sons of William Cokayne (<i>d</i>. 18 Nov 1599) of Baddesley Ensor, Warwickshire, a freeman of the Skinners' Company of London and sometime governor of the Eastland Company, and his first wife, Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 2 April 1589), the daughter of Roger Medcalfe of Wensleydale, Yorkshire, and of Alspade and Meriden, Warwickshire, also a freeman of the Skinners' Company of London. His family had been established near Ashbourne, Derbyshire, since the middle of the twelfth century, and included the judge Sir John Cokayne (<i>d</i>. 1438); Thomas Cockayne, recorder of London in 1439, was probably a member of the same family. William was apprenticed to his father at Christmas 1582, and became free of the Skinners' Company by patrimony on 28 March 1590. He was admitted to Gray's Inn on 10 August 1600. On his father's death he succeeded to the latter's business, and quickly achieved prominence among London merchants. Like his father, he was a leading member of the Eastland Company, which at that time was the chief rival trading company of the Company of Merchant Adventurers (of which neither Cokayne nor his father were members). He was also an active member of the East India Company committee (1606&#150;9), and was master of the Skinners' Company in 1609, 1611, and 1625.<br>
<br>Cokayne exported cloth to the Baltic on a considerable scale, becoming enormously wealthy, and he lent money to James I. By 1603, if not earlier, he was purveyor to the English force sent to quell the Irish rising, and for many years he employed William Cradock as his resident factor respecting the purveyorship in Hamburg (through which port most munitions used to be bought or transported at that time). Cokayne served as a sheriff of London (1609&#150;10) and alderman for the wards of Farringdon Without (1609&#150;13), Castle Baynard (1613&#150;18), Lime Street (1618&#150;25), and Broad Street (1625&#150;6). He was lord mayor of London in 1619&#150;20, and first governor of the Irish Society, from 1610 to 1614, when he took in hand the defences of Londonderry (1613). He was auditor (1606&#150;7), colonel of the trained bands (1618&#150;26), and president of St Thomas's Hospital (1622&#150;6), as well as a benefactor and governor of Christ's Hospital.<br>
<br>Cokayne married, on 22 June 1596, at St Leonard Eastcheap, London, Mary (<i>bap</i>. 10 May 1573, <i>d</i>. 1648/9), the fifth and youngest daughter of Richard Morris of Suffolk, a freeman of the Ironmongers' Company of London, and his wife, Maud, formerly the wife of John Barlow, also a freeman of the Ironmongers' Company of London, and the daughter of John Daborne or Dawborne of Guildford, Surrey. After Cokayne's death Mary married Henry Carey, first earl of Dover, the father of her future son-in-law. Mary was buried on 8 January 1649 with Cokayne in St Paul's Cathedral.<br>
<br>Cokayne became an influential adviser to James I, who frequently consulted with him both in council and privately, speaking highly of his business methods and his &#145;language, accent and manner of delivering himself&#146;  (G. E. Cokayne). As early as 1606 Cokayne was concerned with what he considered to be the great project of his life: the dyeing and dressing of all cloths made in England before their exportation. His chance came in 1612, with the death of Salisbury: James was increasing his power, and the treasury was trying to improve the state revenues. Cokayne used his influence with the king to override privy council concerns and promote his own, and the Eastland Company's, project to transform the Merchant Adventurers' sole privilege of the exportation of undyed and undressed cloths into an exportation of the finished product. The Company of Merchant Adventurers considered the project doomed, refused to co-operate, and was suppressed. The New Company of Merchant Adventurers was established in its place and received its letters patent on 29 August 1615; Cokayne became its first governor. The nucleus of this company consisted of Eastland merchants, and included William Cradock, Cokayne's old factor from Hamburg, which became the King's Merchant Adventurers' staple town in Germany. All licences for the exportation of undyed and undressed cloth were withdrawn, which annoyed the Dutch, the principal buyers. The project, and the new company, failed, and gave rise to one of the most severe trade crises ever to devastate England.<br>
<br>During the brief term of the new company, on 8 June 1616 Cokayne entertained the king in his own home, Cokayne House, directly opposite the church of St Peter-le-Poer in Broad Street. The cost of the entertainment came to over &pound;3000, and was paid for by the new company, although Cokayne took the credit; he was knighted with the City's sword at the end of the festivities on that day. A gold basin and &pound;1000 was given to the king, and &pound;500 to Prince Charles. However, by the autumn of 1616 the king had lost faith in the New Merchant Adventurers', and Cokayne was out of favour. By 1 January 1617 the king had restored the old Merchant Adventurers' company, and the New Company of Merchant Adventurers was dissolved. Cokayne managed to avoid falling into disfavour for long, however, and by 1618 his reconciliation with the king was complete.<br>
<br>During his mayoralty, on 26 March 1620, Cokayne received in great state the king and the prince of Wales, who visited St Paul's Cathedral with a view to raising money to complete the spire, which had blown down in 1561. The title of his mayoral pageant, which was paid for by the Skinners' Company, was <span class="italic">The Triumphs of Love and Antiquity</span>; it was written by Thomas Middleton, who also wrote <span class="italic">The First Entertainment</span>, held at Cokayne House on Monday and Tuesday in Easter week 1620. On the Saturday following, 22 April, the latter entertainment was reworked for the privy council, and on the same day Cokayne's eldest daughter, Mary, married Charles Howard, third baron Howard of Effingham.<br>
<br>Cokayne was one of the financiers who equipped William Baffin for his voyage in search of a north-west passage in 1612, and in his honour Baffin named a harbour in Greenland Cockin's Sound.<br>
<br>As well as Cokayne House in Broad Street, which was destroyed by fire on 12 November 1623 and had to be totally rebuilt, Cokayne purchased large estates in several counties, including (in 1619) Elmesthorpe, Leicestershire, and Rushton, Northamptonshire, the latter of which was the home of his descendants until 1828. He also possessed a manor house, Coombe Nevill (once owned by the earls of Warwick), at Kingston, Surrey, where he died, after two days' illness, on 20 October 1626, aged sixty-six. He was buried on 12 December in St Paul's Cathedral, where a stately monument, including effigies of him and his wife and a lengthy Latin inscription, was erected to him. Of this monument, only part of his effigy, comprising his figure down to the knees, still survives in the crypt of the cathedral. The monument and epitaph are illustrated in Sir William Dugdale's <span class="italic">History of St Paul's Cathedral</span> (1658). His funeral sermon was preached by John Donne, dean of St Paul's. Letters of administration were granted on his estate on 20 December 1626, and his nuncupative will was proved on 20 June 1627. He left his son Charles estates worth &pound;12,000 per annum and &pound;10,000 for each of his six daughters, and he bequeathed to the Skinners' Company five silver-gilt loving cups, which they still possess, in the form of cocks standing on turtles.<br>
<br>Cokayne was the ancestor of a number of English aristocratic families. His only surviving son, Charles (1602&#150;1661), was created Baron and Viscount Cullen of co. Tipperary in the peerage of Ireland in 1642 and married Lady Mary O'Brien, the first daughter and coheir of Henry, fifth earl of Thomond in Ireland. His eldest daughter, Mary (1598&#150;1650/51), married Charles Howard, third Baron Howard of Effingham, later second earl of Nottingham. Anne (1604&#150;1668) married Sir Hatton Fermor, of Easton Neston, Northamptonshire, and was the ancestor of the earls of Pomfret. Martha (1605&#150;1641) married firstly John Ramsay, earl of Holdernesse, and secondly Montagu Bertie, Lord Willoughby de Eresby, who succeeded as second earl of Lindsey in 1642; by the latter marriage she was ancestor of the earls of Lindsey, the dukes of Ancaster, and the earls of Ancaster. Elizabeth (1609&#150;1667/8) married Thomas Fanshawe, created Viscount Fanshawe of Dromore in Ireland in 1661, remembrancer of the exchequer. Abigail (1610&#150;1687/8) married John Carey, Viscount Rochford, later second earl of Dover, whose father, the first earl, had married her mother some six months earlier. Jane (1611/12&#150;1683), Cokayne's youngest daughter, married the Hon. James Sheffield, the son of the earl of Mulgrave.<br>
