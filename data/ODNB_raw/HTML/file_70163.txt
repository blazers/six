<span class="headword">Werner <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em>Chaima]</span>,  Abraham Abel</span>  (1837&#150;1912), <span class="occ">rabbi</span>, was born in Tels, a small town in the Kovno (Kaunas) district of Lithuania, then part of the Russian empire. Of his parents little is known, save that they were Orthodox Jews. His father was Yakov Chaima; the surname Werner was adopted by Abraham before he moved to Finland. Lithuania then boasted some of the most vibrant centres of Talmudic scholarship in Europe, and Tels was especially distinguished in this respect. The young Werner studied under the direction of prominent Lithuanian rabbis; at the age of twenty he received the rabbinical diploma, and in 1865, at an astonishingly young age, he was appointed a <i>dayan</i>&#151;that is, a member of the Jewish ecclesiastical court&#151;of Tels, a testimony to the reputation of his rabbinical scholarship. In 1854 Werner had married Sima Gittel (1837&#150;1906). There were two sons and a daughter of the marriage. In 1880 he moved to Helsingfors (Helsinki) to become the chief rabbi of Finland. Eleven years later he accepted an invitation to journey to London to become the rabbi of a small but immensely influential community of Orthodox Jews in that city.<br>
<br>In 1891 London Jewry was in the middle of a veritable <i>Kulturkampf</i>. That summer Hermann Adler had succeeded his father, Nathan Marcus Adler, as chief rabbi of the British empire, a post which was, in effect, in the gift of the United Synagogue, presided over by the house of Rothschild. The Judaism of the United Synagogue represented a compromise: nominally it was Orthodox, but most of its members did not practise this orthodoxy, and there had developed during the 1880s a bitter rift between the United Synagogue (in effect, the Anglo-Jewish establishment at prayer) and the Jewish refugees from Russia and Poland who flooded into England, and primarily into London, during that decade to escape persecution and to seek economic advancement.<br>
<br>The Yiddish-speaking immigrants had accepted the authority of Nathan Adler, a Talmudic scholar of international repute, but they had much less time for Hermann, whom they regarded as lacking in rabbinical scholarship and weak in commitment to Orthodox Judaism. Moreover, they were outraged at Hermann's determination that he alone should be accorded the status and title of rabbi (indeed, of chief rabbi) within the British empire; in eastern Europe every Jewish town had one or more rabbis, all of whom could exercise ecclesiastical jurisdiction. To fight Hermann's claims an alliance had been formed between two rigidly Orthodox communities, one of German and Austro-Hungarian origin, the other composed of Russian and Polish immigrants. Together, these groups established the Chevra Machzike Hadath (&#145;the society of the upholders of the religion&#146;). And it was from this Chevra that Werner received the invitation to come to London a short time after Hermann had succeeded to his father's position.<br>
<br>Werner lost no time in declaring war on United Synagogue Judaism and on the United Synagogue's rabbinical leadership. He condemned the meat and poultry sold as kosher under Hermann Adler's authority, and established a quite separate facility, under his supervision, for the slaughter and preparation of kosher meat and meat products. He solemnized marriages and authorized divorces without any reference to Hermann Adler, and he established a Talmud Torah (religion school) which taught in Yiddish, a language the Anglo-Jewish establishment despised.<br>
<br>The Machzike Hadath grew in popularity and size, and in 1898 moved into a former Huguenot chapel at the corner of Brick Lane and Fournier Street, in the heart of the Jewish East End of London. Known as the Spitalfields Great Synagogue, it became the acknowledged centre of immigrant opposition to Adlerian Judaism. Its success inspired other communities of Jewish immigrants in Liverpool and Manchester to rebel also against Hermann Adler's jurisdiction. By the end of the nineteenth century Hermann was faced with a full-scale rebellion on the part of the immigrants, who now comprised the numerical majority of the Jews in Great Britain. What saved his authority, and that of the Anglo-Jewish establishment, was the financial poverty of the Machzike Hadath and of its members. In 1905, in return for financial assistance, the community agreed to recognize Adler's jurisdiction; Werner renounced his right to authorize marriages and divorces, and his separate slaughtering facilities were also brought under Adler's overall authority. Werner was criticized in some quarters for what was seen as a capitulation. A man of great humility, his concern was never for his own status, but rather for the status of Orthodox Judaism; in this respect, the United Synagogue had learned a lesson which it was never to forget: that it had to accommodate the wishes of East End as well as of West End Jews.<br>
<br>Werner also clashed with Adler over Zionism. Hermann, fearful for the status of emancipated Jews in Britain, had condemned Zionism as contrary to Jewish principles. Werner, from a much stronger Talmudic perspective, supported the Zionist movement, and spoke at the famous monster rally which Theodor Herzl addressed at the Great Assembly Hall, Mile End, east London, in October 1898.<br>
<br>In his long black frock coat and flowing beard, Werner was an imposing figure. He wrote little. His strengths lay in his faith, his piety, his Talmudic learning, and in the propagation of the study of the <span class="roman">Talmud</span> among British Jews. His death in London at 9 Princelet Street, Spitalfields, on 20 December 1912, provoked one of the largest gatherings of Jews ever seen in Britain, and his funeral, at the Federation Jewish cemetery, Edmonton, the same day, witnessed an outpouring of grief which was certainly without precedent; it merited a report in the <span class="italic">Manchester Guardian</span> (23 December).<br>
