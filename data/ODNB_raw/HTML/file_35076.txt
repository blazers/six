</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Montagu,  Samuel</span>, first Baron Swaythling  (1832&#150;1911), <span class="occ">merchant banker and philanthropist</span>, was born Montagu Samuel in Liverpool on 21 December 1832, the second son and youngest child of Louis Samuel (1794&#150;1859), watchmaker and silversmith of Liverpool, and his wife, Henrietta, daughter of Israel Israel of Bury Street, St Mary Axe, London. The Samuel family had emigrated from Mecklenburg-Strelitz in northern Germany in the mid-eighteenth century. Both of Montagu's parents were Orthodox Jews and he was to remain a strict adherent of Orthodox Judaism.<br>
<br>Montagu's parents altered his given name of Montagu Samuel to Samuel Montagu as soon as he completed his education at the Mechanics' Institution (later the Liverpool Institute). His name change was confirmed by royal licence in 1894. After Louis Samuel retired from business in 1847, the family moved to London, where Montagu joined the money-changing business of his brother-in-law Adam Spielmann. In 1850 or 1851 he was appointed London manager of V. Monteaux &amp; Co., a private bank in Paris, but in 1852 he persuaded his father to provide &pound;5000 to start his own firm. This investment was on condition that Montagu&#151;not yet twenty-one&#151;should run the business in partnership with his elder brother, Edwin Samuel, who was a bullion merchant and banker in Liverpool. On this basis the firm of Montagu and Samuel was founded at 142 Leadenhall Street, London, in February 1853. The brothers took on Monteaux's lease at 21 Cornhill in 1862 and in 1865 moved to 60 (later renumbered 114) Old Broad Street, which remained the firm's address until 1987.<br>
<br>The new firm specialized in bullion and exchange services, bill collection, and bankers' drafts. Montagu's experience and expertise in bullion and foreign exchange were the key factors in the business, and within two decades the firm had &#145;assumed an undisputed lead in the silver market&#146;  (<span class="italic">Jewish Chronicle</span>, 20 Jan 1911). His skilful use of fine margins in foreign exchange gave him the reputation of founding his fortune on &#145;the quarter-pfennig and the half-centime&#146;  (Franklin, 4).<br>
<br>Edwin Samuel played little part in the development of the firm, remaining in Liverpool until he wound up his own bank in 1872. Montagu's main support came from Ellis Abraham Franklin, who had been the firm's first employee. Franklin married Montagu's sister Adelaide in 1856 and became a partner in 1862. The business was then renamed Samuel, Montagu &amp; Co. (the comma was dropped from the title when Edwin died in 1877). In 1868 the three partners, who were each to have four sons, founded and financed the independent firm of A. Keyser &amp; Co. at their old office in Cornhill; it was later agreed that two sons of each partner in Samuel, Montagu &amp; Co. would be admitted to the new concern.<br>
<br>By the 1870s Montagu had diversified into the market for foreign loans and bills. He cultivated this new interest by frequent visits to western Europe, where he acted as &#145;the bank's courier&#146;  (Montagu, 61). In 1896 these international contacts led to the appointment of Samuel Montagu as the issuing house for the Belgian government's &pound;1 million 3 per cent loan. By that time the financial success of the firm was assured. Montagu himself admitted in 1896 that &#145;we have a capital of at least &pound;1,000,000. Some people give us credit for having more than this&#146;  (Green, 299). &#145;For practical purposes&#146;, reported one London banker in the same year, &#145;they are as good as Rothschilds&#146;  (HSBC Group Archives, M153/44).<br>
<br>Throughout his career Montagu maintained direct and narrow control over the firm. Procurations, for example, were not granted to members of staff; consequently for the first fifty years of the firm's existence it was necessary for Montagu or Franklin to sign every letter and every cheque issued by the bank. Montagu was also famously impatient with staff or customers who would not accept instructions and advice. Outside the partnership he was an active shareholder in many British and overseas companies. As an investor in the Chartered Mercantile Bank of India, for example, he was a powerful influence in the successful reconstruction of the company as the Mercantile Bank in 1893.<br>
<br>Montagu was elected Liberal MP for the Whitechapel division of Tower Hamlets in 1885. Although he was &#145;far from being a brilliant speaker&#146;  (Montagu, 67), he was a popular figure in his East End constituency and in the Commons. In 1888 he was a member of the select committee of the House of Commons on alien immigration, an issue on which he opposed over-restriction and spoke for the interests of persecuted Jews. A devoted follower of Gladstone, he was active as a &#145;home-ruler&#146; (he contributed to the Parnell expenses fund) and as an advocate of free trade. He was chief author of the <span class="roman">Weights and Measures Act</span> 1897 which legalized the use of metric weights and measures, and he ensured that the <span class="roman">Finance Act</span> of 1894 exempted from death duties bequests to public libraries, museums, and art galleries. An ardent supporter of bimetallism, he was a member of the gold and silver commission (1887&#150;90) and president of the Decimal Association; he advised both Liberal and Unionist governments on financial issues and gave evidence to the national monetary commission in the USA.<br>
<br>In his activities outside business and politics, Montagu was equally tenacious and purposeful. He was closely identified with the work of the Anglo-Jewish community. He was a life member of the council of the United Synagogue, a prominent member of the Board of Deputies of British Jews (from 1862), and a member of the board of guardians and the religious education board. In 1870 he founded and became president of the Jewish working men's club in Aldgate. He was until 1909 president of the Shechita board (for supervising the slaughtering of animals according to Jewish practice) and he was chairman of the building committee of the New West End Synagogue in Bayswater (his own place of worship). One of his greatest services to the Jewish community was the formation in 1887 of the federation of the smaller East End synagogues, where he insisted that English became the official language. He was a seat holder at no fewer than forty synagogues.<br>
<br>Montagu worked energetically in the interests of the east London poor, both Jewish and non-Jewish. He was treasurer of the Jews' Temporary Shelter, founder of the East London Apprenticeship Fund in 1887, trustee of the People's Palace at Mile End, member of the house committee at the London Hospital, and a director of the Four Per Cent Industrial Dwellings Company. In 1903 he gave &pound;10,000 to London county council for its housing scheme for the poor of Tottenham.<br>
<br>Montagu frequently travelled overseas in the interests of his co-religionists. In 1875 he visited the Holy Land and later founded with Lord Rothschild the first secular and industrial school in Jerusalem. In 1884 he visited the United States to assist the formation of Jewish agricultural colonies in the far west, and two years later he visited all the chief towns of Russia in order to investigate the condition of the Jews there&#151;an enterprise which on his arrival in Moscow led to his expulsion from Russia at forty-eight hours' notice. Thereafter he was prominent in the affairs of the Mansion House Fund (later the Russo-Jewish Committee), and he served as president from 1896 to 1909.<br>
<br>Samuel Montagu, who was made a baronet on 23 June 1894, retired from the House of Commons in 1900 and was succeeded there by his nephew and partner Stuart Montagu Samuel. On Campbell-Bannerman's recommendation, in 1907 he was raised to the peerage as Baron Swaythling, taking his title from Swaythling near Southampton, where he had a country house, at South Stoneham.<br>
<br>In 1862 Montagu married Ellen (1848&#150;1919), the youngest daughter of Louis Cohen, a merchant and stockbroker. They had ten children, including <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/53683/', "Henrietta Franklin (1866&#150;1964)")</script>, educationist and suffragist <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35074/', "Edwin Montagu (1879&#150;1924)")</script>, later secretary of state for India, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/40837/', "Lilian Montagu (1873&#150;1963)")</script>, vice-president of the Jewish Religious Union. Over several decades Montagu amassed a large and celebrated collection of antique silver and a fine collection of English paintings (including works by Reynolds, Turner, and Morland). He was elected a fellow of the Society of Arts in 1897 and he was a conscientious contributor to Palgrave's <span class="italic">Dictionary of Political Economy</span>, the <span class="italic">Encyclopaedia Britannica</span>, and the <span class="italic">Jewish Chronicle</span>. He retired from active business life in 1909 and died on 12 January 1911 at his London home, 12 Kensington Palace Gardens, leaving an estate with a gross probate value of &pound;1,150,000. He was buried at the Federation Jewish cemetery at Edmonton, Middlesex, and was survived by his wife, four sons, and six daughters. Most of his fortune was left in trust for his children on the condition that they should neither leave nor marry outside the Jewish faith.<br>
