<span class="headword">Prime, Sir  Samuel</span>  (1701&#150;1777), <span class="occ">serjeant-at-law</span>, was born on 21 August 1701, the second son of Thomas Prime, a grocer at Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, and his wife, Elizabeth, and attended the grammar school there before going up to St John's College, Cambridge, in 1718. Two years later he was admitted to the Middle Temple, where he was called to the bar in 1724. Numerous surviving opinions under his name show that he had an extensive chambers practice, and he distinguished himself sufficiently at the bar to be given the coif at the last general call of serjeants, in 1736, and a patent as one of the king's serjeants in 1738. Together with Serjeant Birch he was knighted in 1745. On 23 August 1748 he married Hannah, daughter of E. Wilmot of Banstead, Surrey, and widow of John Sheppard of Campsey Ash.<br>
<br>By dint of seniority as a king's serjeant Prime became in 1749 the king's prime serjeant-at-law, and as such leader of the bar of England until his retirement in Trinity term 1758. The reason for his retirement, according to Lord Thurlow, was a chance remark by the latter on the affront to his rank by the government in entrusting the prosecution of the French spy Florence Hensey, for high treason, to Sir Fletcher Norton. He was treasurer of Serjeants' Inn, Chancery Lane, from 1749 until the same year. His office of king's serjeant was not renewed after the demise of the crown in 1760. Professional anecdotes of him, handed down into the following century, suggested that he was a dry and long-winded advocate with little or no sense of humour. Nevertheless, the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> perhaps intended a compliment when it said, after his death: &#145;He was the Sir Fletcher Norton of his time.&#146; Serjeant Prime lived nearly twenty years in retirement. He died on 24 February 1777 and was buried in the Temple Church, where there is an inscription. His only son, Samuel Prime (<i>d</i>. 1813), followed him to St John's College and the Middle Temple, where he was called in 1773.<br>
