<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Thornycroft,  Thomas</span>  (1815&#150;1885), <span class="occ">sculptor</span>, was born in Great Tidnock, near Gawsworth, Cheshire, on 19 May 1815 and baptized on 16 June 1816 in Gawsworth church, the eldest of three sons of John Thornycroft (1791&#150;1822), a farmer, and his wife, Ann Cheetham (1795&#150;1875), who also came from a farming background. Thornycroft was educated at Congleton grammar school. After a brief apprenticeship to a surgeon, in 1835 he went to London, where he spent four years as a studio assistant to the sculptor <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/10074/', "John Francis")</script>. On 29 February 1840 Thornycroft married at the Old Church, St Pancras, Francis's daughter, Mary (1809&#150;1895) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27368/', "Thornycroft, Mary")</script>], a fellow sculptor. Following a visit to Italy (1842&#150;3), the Thornycrofts returned to London, where they established a studio near Regent's Park.<br>
<br>Through the recommendation of John Gibson, Mary Thornycroft received commissions for portrait busts and statuettes of the children of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert. The royal couple admired Thomas Thornycroft's over-life-sized plaster equestrian statue of Queen Victoria, shown at the Great Exhibition in 1851. Thornycroft portrayed the queen wearing a close-fitting riding habit and gave her horse a jaunty gait. While the statue's informal realism drew mixed critical reactions, it contrasted refreshingly with the more dignified, iconic images usually accorded to monarchs. Thornycroft was subsequently commissioned by the Art Union to produce fifty bronze statuettes, several of which he cast in his studio, and in 1868 he executed a full-sized version for Liverpool town council (St George's Hall, Liverpool). Thornycroft's accompanying memorial statue of Prince Albert, commissioned in 1862, stands near by; there are similar versions in Halifax (1864) and Wolverhampton (1866).<br>
<br>Although Thornycroft was now established as a leading English sculptor, few major commissions were forthcoming. In 1857 he was placed joint fifth in the competition for the Wellington memorial at St Paul's Cathedral. Ten years later he was commissioned to carve the marble group representing <span class="italic">Commerce</span> for the Royal Albert Memorial (Kensington Gardens, London), a competent, if mundane, Victorian allegory. From the mid-1850s onwards Thornycroft's sculptural ambitions focused on the monumental equestrian group <span class="italic">Boadicea and her Daughters</span> (Westminster Bridge, London). Although Prince Albert warmly supported the idea, the monument was not cast in bronze until 1902, seventeen years after Thornycroft's death. Its erection was made possible by the donation of the plaster model and &pound;1500 by his son, the marine engineer <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36512/', "Sir John Thornycroft")</script>.<br>
<br>In his later years Thornycroft devoted little attention to sculpture and more towards assisting his son John with designs for steam launches. One of his last works, the <span class="italic">Poets' Fountain</span>, near Hyde Park Corner, London (1875; destr. 1947), was jointly executed with Mary and another son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36513/', "(William) Hamo Thornycroft")</script>. Photographs of it indicate an incongruous amalgam of high Victorian realism and the elegance of Hamo Thornycroft's New Sculpture. More successful is the charming, if sentimental, memorial to John Hamilton-Martin (1857; St Michael's, Ledbury, Herefordshire). It is signed by both Thomas and Mary Thornycroft; the latter carved the effigy which, following the tradition of Thomas Banks and Francis Chantrey, portrays the child not dead, but sleeping.<br>
<br>Although the Thornycrofts' marriage was a happy one, Mary's more sustained and distinctive talent aroused her husband's periodic jealousy. Thomas Thornycroft died at Brenchley, Kent, on 30 August 1885, survived by his wife and six of their seven children. He was buried in Chiswick Old Church, Middlesex. His correspondence (Henry Moore Institute, Leeds) indicates a man of lively intelligence and inventiveness who practised sculpture during a creatively bleak era, caught between the neo-classicism of Gibson and the &#145;renaissance&#146; of the New Sculpture. Further examples of his work are in the Old Bailey and Westminster Abbey, London.<br>
