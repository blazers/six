<span class="headword">Miranda,  (Sebasti&aacute;n) Francisco  de</span>  (1750&#150;1816), <span class="occ">campaigner for Spanish American independence</span>, was born on 28 March 1750 in Caracas, Venezuela, the eldest of ten children of Sebasti&aacute;n de Miranda Ravelo (1721&#150;1791), an entrepreneurial merchant who had emigrated to Venezuela from the Canary Islands, and his wife, Francisca Antonia Rodr&iacute;guez de Espinosa (<i>d</i>. 1777), a member of a prominent Creole family. Miranda was baptized on 5 April 1750 in the metropolitan cathedral in Caracas. He was educated at home by a Jesuit priest, Narciso Y&eacute;pez, and attended the Academy of Santa Rosa before entering the Royal and Pontifical University of Caracas in 1762, where he specialized in the study of law. He graduated as a bachelor of humanities in 1767.<br>
<br>In 1771 Miranda's father purchased a captaincy in the Spanish army for his restless son. Miranda crossed the Atlantic, where he entered the princess's infantry company on 7 December 1772, and was sent to the Spanish garrison at Melilla in north Africa. Temperamentally disinclined to obedience, Miranda was a subversive presence who always thought he was more intelligent than his commanders. He openly admired his Moorish opponents, read the <span class="roman">Koran</span>, and came to identify with their desire to rid their soil of a foreign military presence. His experiences while serving in Europe and north Africa awakened an anti-colonial consciousness, which fused with his tremendous hubris and led him to believe he could lead a glorious movement to emancipate his own American countrymen from Spanish tyranny. He was reprimanded on several occasions for insubordination and was also imprisoned, for example on the Algerian campaign of 1775 after he complained that incompetent senior officers were being decorated just for their status while men of lower rank but greater ability were ignored, and in summer 1777 at Cadiz. An important friend made at this time was John Turnbull, a young English merchant based at Gibraltar, through whom Miranda began to expand his knowledge of the English-speaking world.<br>
<br>Anxious to return to America and start down his path to greatness, Miranda requested a transfer to the Spanish fort at Cuba and set sail for the Caribbean on 28 April 1780. Immediately after his arrival Miranda participated in the expedition that retook Pensacola from the British occupiers. Working under the governor, Juan Manuel Cagigal, he co-ordinated the Cubans' efforts to supply the North American patriots, sending critical financial aid to Admiral de Grasse in the Chesapeake. In August 1781 Cagigal sent Miranda to Jamaica to negotiate an exchange of prisoners with the commander of the British station there. The friendships he made among the British officers in Jamaica enhanced his already pronounced Anglophilia, and rumours started to circulate that he had been recruited as a British spy. Although the charges were never proven, Miranda had become so transfixed by the idea of Spanish American independence that he decided to defect and seek foreign allies for his scheme. He slipped out of his barracks in Cuba in the middle of the night on 1 June 1783 and embarked for the United States.<br>
<br>Having turned himself into a fugitive from Spain, Miranda spent the next two years travelling throughout the United States, following a route that took him through Charleston, Philadelphia, and New York to Boston. He was a purposeful traveller, visiting most significant battle sites of the American War of Independence and talking with many important military and political leaders of the new nation. Miranda became particularly close to Alexander Hamilton, Henry Knox, and Samuel Adams, and also briefly met George Washington and the marquis de Lafayette, whose fame made him jealous. He consciously sought out people and experiences that would help him understand the vast political experiment taking place around him in order to gain valuable lessons for Spanish American independence, and recorded his observations in a highly detailed diary.<br>
<br>Miranda next sought to publicize himself and his cause in Britain, arriving in London on 1 February 1785. From his American friends he had letters of introduction to several British public figures, and worked to expand his acquaintance, calling on the former prime minister the earl of Shelburne, Joseph Priestley, Samuel and Jeremy Bentham, Francis Egerton, third duke of Bridgewater, and many others, and travelled to Edinburgh in an unsuccessful attempt to meet Adam Smith. In August he and Colonel William Steuben Smith, son-in-law of the American minister in London, John Adams, embarked on the grand tour of Europe. They arrived at The Hague and then travelled through the Dutch republic and Westphalia to Prussia, reaching Berlin early in September, where they witnessed and were impressed by the splendour and discipline of Frederick the Great's military on parade. After travelling with Smith to Prague, Budapest (where they met Joseph Haydn), and Vienna, Miranda ventured alone to Italy where he held secret meetings with Spanish American Jesuits who had been exiled <i>en masse</i> by Charles III of Spain in 1767. Many Jesuit exiles had written or were writing natural and geographic histories of their home regions, and thus played a substantial role in the formation of national identities in South America. From there he went to Greece (arriving in May 1786) and Turkey to visit all the sites of classical antiquity and take notes on their contemporary military practices and weaponry.<br>
<br>In October 1786 Miranda headed northward to the Crimea. In early 1787 he encountered Prince Grigory Potemkin and the Russian empress, Catherine the Great, on their famous tour of the Ukraine. He quickly became a favourite of the empress, and spent a year in Russia discoursing with her on the economic possibilities for Russia in Alaska and California that would be opened up by Spanish American independence. Delighted with her dashing young prot&eacute;g&eacute;, Catherine made him a Russian count, and guaranteed that he would receive sanctuary in all her embassies, if danger should ever threaten him. Miranda travelled across Scandinavia where, in Sweden late in 1787, he conducted a month-long affair with Catherine Hall, wife of a wealthy British merchant in G&ouml;teborg. One tradition alleges that Miranda chose the colours of the flag of independent Venezuela to commemorate Catherine's beauty: &#145;yellow for her hair, blue for her eyes, red for her lips&#146;  (Racine, 98). He proceeded through Denmark, the Netherlands, Germany, Switzerland (where he discussed American independence with Edward Gibbon), and Italy, ending his grand tour in France. He arrived in Paris in May 1789 as the estates general met for the first time since 1614. He was appalled at the luxury of the court while the mass of the people suffered in poverty, but was inspired by the humbling of the French royal family, who were from the same Bourbon dynasty as the king of Spain. He returned to London that summer full of energy and ideas and determined to spread liberty to his own continent.<br>
<br>Miranda settled in his former lodgings at 104 Pall Mall and began negotiating with the British government. In 1790, with the encouragement and participation of the prime minister, William Pitt, he drew up a plan for the establishment of an independent state in Spanish America with British military assistance. Pitt's principal immediate interest was in obtaining Miranda's knowledge of South America, whether acquired at first hand or from his correspondents or books, in order to increase the British government's grasp of commercial and diplomatic opportunities there. Miranda eventually realized that his enthusiasm for a British invasion of South America was not shared by his host government, ended his discussions with Pitt, and left for Paris in March 1792.<br>
<br>Miranda's negotiations with the French revolutionary government earned him that August a commission as field marshal in the French army, which he accepted on the understanding that the French government would promote the cause of Spanish American independence indefinitely, and that they accepted that this was Miranda's primary calling in life. In autumn 1792 he was one of the commanders of the French army of the north in its conquest of the Austrian Netherlands. Although Miranda was a competent military leader, his best efforts were doomed by disrupted supply lines and the political intrigues of his superiors. His association with the moderate Girondins did not endear him to the more radical Jacobins. He was accused of military incompetence and anti-revolutionary ideas and tried in May 1793. He was unanimously found not guilty, but when the Jacobins established their ascendancy in July, Miranda was rapidly rearrested and held without trial until January 1795.<br>
<br>Miranda remained in France, but was the frequent victim of political persecution by the conservative administration of the Directory, for whom he was a dangerous radical. In December 1797 he convened a meeting of Spanish American exiles who drew up the &#145;act of Paris&#146;, a declaration proposing Spanish American independence under British protection, and an alliance between Spanish America, Britain, and the United States against France.<br>
<br>Miranda left for London in January 1798 and renewed his acquaintance with Pitt. He also travelled, and while on a tour of northern England, in 1800 or 1802, he met and probably married Sarah (1774&#150;1847), daughter of John Andrews, a shoemaker in Market Weighton, Yorkshire, and his wife, Diana, sister of Stephen Hewson, portrait painter. They are known to have had two children, Leandro (1803&#150;1886) and Francisco (1806&#150;1831).<br>
<br>Miranda's scheme for British intervention in Spanish America to some extent complemented British aspirations for the end of Spanish rule on the continent, but despite support from the Pittite MP and naval officer Home Popham, and the secretary to the Admiralty, Sir Evan Nepean, a planned expedition to the Caribbean in 1804 did not take place. The renewal of hostilities in Europe that year meant that the British government became focused on the European theatre of war; Miranda recognized this and turned to his old friends in the United States. In December 1805 he secured an audience with President Thomas Jefferson and the secretary of state, James Madison, both of whom expressed their interest, even tacit approval, but whose diplomatic sensibilities prevented them from extending any official support. Private investors were more enthusiastic and outfitted a ship for him, which he sentimentally named the <i>Leander</i> after his young son. Dozens of idealistic and unemployed young men volunteered to join the Miranda expedition which left New York on 2 February 1806 and, after spending much of February and March in Haiti and then calling off at various points in the Caribbean, finally landed at La Vela de Coro in Venezuela on 3 August 1806. Far from being received as liberators, however, Miranda's dishevelled and demoralized mercenaries met with little interest from the local inhabitants and he retreated to his ship in less than a week. While several of his unfortunate young followers were captured by Spanish royalists, tortured, and even executed, Miranda hovered, the focus of rumour and speculation, in Trinidad until late 1807 when he sailed home to his young family in London. The whole distasteful episode became a minor controversy in American politics when opponents of Jefferson and Madison later tried to tie the illegal and abortive invasion to their administration during an election campaign.<br>
<br>For Miranda, however, the <i>Leander</i> expedition turned into a propaganda coup. Aggressively pursuing a public relations campaign in England, James Mill, Jeremy Bentham, and Miranda collaborated on books called <span class="italic">South American Independence, or, The Emancipation of South America, the Glory and Interest of England</span> (1807) and <span class="italic">Additional Reasons for Our Immediately Emancipating Spanish America</span> (1808). As a result his London home at 27 Grafton Street (later renumbered 58 Grafton Way) became a beacon for disaffected Spanish American patriots and their English supporters and admirers, who included not only Bentham and Mill but Lady Hester Stanhope and William Wilberforce among many others. In the summer of 1810 representatives of autonomous <i>cabildos</i> (local town councils) from Caracas and Buenos Aires came to London to solicit recognition; the men lodged with Miranda and participated in the so-called Grafton Street symposium, during which the shared vision of continental emancipation was earnestly discussed. Sim&oacute;n Bol&iacute;var, one of the Venezuelans, admired his famous countryman and persuaded Miranda to return to America. He left London for the last time in October 1810 and arrived in Caracas on 10 December. Miranda was elected to the national congress as the representative of the remote province of Pao and was present when the congress officially declared the first republic on 5 July 1811. By then sixty-one years old, Miranda was a marginalized and distrusted figure in independent Venezuela. His Patriotic Club permitted women and mulattos to join as members, which disturbed the Venezuelan male land- and slave-owning &eacute;lite. He took charge of a military expedition against the town of Valencia, whose leaders opposed the revolution, but this led some in Caracas to fear that Miranda was leading a Jacobin coup. Following a devastating earthquake in Caracas on 26 March 1812, on 3 April Miranda was named generalissimo for life and head of state with sweeping powers over the army and the state. This appeared to be further proof of a soaring ambition which reduced his appeal to the younger generation of more moderate, republican patriots.<br>
<br>Later that year, in the wake of a successful campaign by royalist forces which Miranda had underestimated, Sim&oacute;n Bol&iacute;var decided that Miranda was turning dangerously despotic and needed to be stopped. Following the royalist capture of his fort of San Felipe, near Puerto Cabello, he negotiated a ceasefire that would turn over Miranda to his Spanish enemies. He was arrested in August while trying to leave for London. The betrayed Miranda was allowed a written appeal in March 1813, but this was denied and he was taken in chains to the Spanish port of Cadiz, where he survived for four years in the dank prison of La Carraca. His health failed dramatically during those years and he died at La Carraca on 14 July 1816, four months after a severe stroke. Miranda was buried in an unmarked grave outside the prison walls; his bones were dug up during renovations in 1875 but have since been lost.<br>
<br>Francisco de Miranda was not an exceptional military talent, nor was he a gifted diplomat or an innovative thinker. Rather, he was a master propagandist and tireless promoter of the one idea that animated his entire life: Spanish American emancipation. His reputation has undergone several transformations. In the years immediately after his death Miranda was portrayed as a victim of Spanish tyranny and hero of the patriot movement; in subsequent decades, however, his fame was subsumed by the cult of the great and heroic Bol&iacute;var. He was remembered elsewhere: in Paris the Arc de Triomphe listed him as one of the commanders of the victorious army of the north. He eventually found a place in South American mythology as the &#145;precursor&#146; of independence, to Bol&iacute;var's &#145;liberator&#146;, a role established by the middle of the nineteenth century. There is a major avenue named after him in Caracas, and a Venezuelan province also bears his name. In 1895 a cenotaph was established in his memory at the National Pantheon, Caracas: the tomb is held open by a soaring eagle, awaiting the repatriation of Miranda's remains. In London he was commemorated by a bronze statue in Fitzroy Square; his former home at 58 Grafton Way was acquired by the Venezuelan government in 1978 to become a museum and the core of a cultural centre.<br>
