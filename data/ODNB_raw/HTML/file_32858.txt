<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Donat,  (Frederick) Robert</span>  (1905&#150;1958), <span class="occ">actor</span>, the fourth and youngest son of Ernst Emil Donat, civil engineer of Polish origin, and his wife, Rose Alice Green, was born at 42 Albert Road, Withington, Manchester, on 18 March 1905. He went to the Central School, Manchester, and later studied for the stage under James Bernard of the same city. In 1924 he joined Sir Frank Benson, whose company was not then so constantly on tour as it had been; thus Donat could alternate continuing membership with seasons in provincial repertory. This was well-varied and helpful schooling: the Shakespearian apprenticeship was valuable, for among Donat's enduring distinctions were the purity of his diction and the beauty of his voice. He worked for a while with Alfred Wareing, whose repertory seasons at the Theatre Royal, Huddersfield, had unusual ambition and quality. In 1928 he began a year at the Playhouse in Liverpool and this was followed by important work at Terence Gray's Festival Theatre in Cambridge where plays by Euripides, Pirandello, Sheridan, and Shakespeare gave him opportunities to experiment in a range of widely different and challenging leading roles. In 1929 he married Ella Annesley Voysey, having two sons and a daughter before the marriage ended in divorce.<br>
<br>Donat made his mark decisively in London in 1931 when he created the part of Gideon Sarn in a dramatization of <span class="italic">Precious Bane</span> by Mary Webb. His handsome features and beautiful delivery, together with the equipment of technique acquired in his repertory years, promised promotion to the front rank and there was confirmation of his powers in the Malvern festival of 1931. Again at Malvern, in 1933, he played the two Camerons in <span class="italic">A Sleeping Clergyman</span> by James Bridie; the piece was transferred to London and had a long run at the Piccadilly Theatre. Donat's performance of the two roles, the dying consumptive and his son the brilliant doctor, was memorable and was repeated in a revival of 1947. To the simulation of a man with lung trouble he brought his own knowledge of pain, for he was himself a sufferer from asthma and his later career was much impeded by illness.<br>
<br>Donat's success carried him to important film work, as Richard Hannay in Alfred Hitchcock's <span class="italic">The 39 Steps</span> (1935)&#151;one of his best performances&#151;and with Alexander Korda, who was then recruiting remarkable casts from the leading theatre actors. His notable appearances were in <span class="italic">The Private Life of Henry VIII</span> (1933), in which Charles Laughton played the king; <span class="italic">The Ghost Goes West</span> (1935); and, as another Scottish doctor, Andrew Manson, in a screen version of A. J. Cronin's <span class="italic">The Citadel</span> (1938), for which he was nominated for an Oscar. Perhaps his most widely appreciated film role was that of Mr Chips, the ageing schoolmaster in <span class="italic">Goodbye Mr Chips</span> (1939), from the novel by James Hilton, and for which he won an Oscar.<br>
<br>Donat continued to mingle screen work with important returns to the stage, taking on the management at the Queen's Theatre in 1936 when he presented J. L. Hodson's <span class="italic">Red Night</span>. During the war he gave vigour and volume to the eloquence of Captain Shotover in a revival of Shaw's <span class="italic">Heartbreak House</span> (1943). At the Westminster Theatre in 1945 he was much liked in a plebeian comedy part in <span class="italic">The Cure for Love</span> by Walter Greenwood. His last venture as a manager was at the Aldwych Theatre in 1945 when he staged <span class="italic">Much Ado about Nothing</span> with himself as Benedick. His spirited rendering of the wordy warfare with Beatrice was exemplary at a time when Shakespearian speaking on the British stage was much criticized. He gave another lesson in delivery when he joined the Old Vic company in 1953 to play Becket in a production of T. S. Eliot's <span class="italic">Murder in the Cathedral</span>. Directed by Robert Helpmann, this was one of the most effective renderings of a play frequently revived. Donat was far from being a player attached to one type of character. He was, however, seen at his best in parts that asked for splendour of voice and dignity of bearing, and his Becket was held by those who knew the scope of his work to have a singular beauty. Asceticism was a quality that came naturally to his delicacy of feature, but he had learned in his repertory years to be richly versatile. In naming his favourite roles he included the two gusty, outspoken Camerons of <span class="italic">A Sleeping Clergyman</span>, which, with <span class="italic">Murder in the Cathedral</span>, were perhaps the summits of his achievement on the stage.<br>
<br>In 1953 Donat married the actress (Dorothy) Ren&eacute;e Asherson (1915&#150;2014). During the last five years of his life he was a constant invalid. He did not mind the seclusion since he was of a shy and retiring disposition and had never sought the bright lights of publicity. But the frustration was galling for an actor who was only just entering his fifties and should have been at the height of his powers. He died in the West End Hospital, Westminster, London, on 9 June 1958.<br>
