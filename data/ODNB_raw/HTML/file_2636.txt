<span class="headword">Blenerhasset,  Thomas</span>  (<em>c.</em>1550&#150;1624), <span class="occ">poet and writer on Ireland</span>, was a younger son of William Blenerhasset of Horsford Park, near Norwich, who died in 1598. His eldest brother, Edward, who, like Thomas, had a successful career in Ireland, was knighted on 23 July 1603. Thomas was, according to his own account, educated at Cambridge without taking a degree. Thomas subsequently entered the army, and was stationed for some years as captain at Guernsey Castle from 1577 on.<br>
<br>At Guernsey Blenerhasset produced his most important literary work, an expansion of the <span class="italic">Mirrour for Magistrates</span>. He claims that he intended it for the private perusal of a friend, but during his absence &#145;beyond the seas&#146; it was published in London in 1578 by Richard Webster under the title of <span class="italic">The Seconde Parte of the Mirrour for Magistrates</span>. An interesting letter was prefixed, which contained some autobiographical facts addressed by the author to the anonymous friend for whom the work was written. He describes the difficulties of his situation, without access to a library, and &#145;sittyng on a rock in the sea &hellip; in <i>Garnzie</i> Castle, where although there be learned men, yet none whiche spende their tyme so vainely as in poetrie&#146;  (<span class="italic">Parts Added</span>, 381&#150;2).<br>
<br>The original <span class="italic">Mirrour for Magistrates</span>, which dealt with episodes in English history from the time of Richard II, had been issued in 1559, under the editorship of William Baldwin, and had been reprinted in 1563. In 1574 John Higgins wrote a new series of poems on legends drawn from far earlier history than that of which Baldwin's work treated. This book, bearing the title of <span class="italic">The First Parte of the Mirrour for Magistrates</span>, was reprinted in 1575. Blenerhasset's contribution to the <span class="italic">Mirrour</span> was a continuation of Higgins's book, &#145;from the conquest of Caesar unto the commyng of Duke William the Conqueror&#146;. It dealt with the legends of &#145;Guidericus, Carassus, Queen Hellina, Vortiger, Uter Pendragon, Cadwallader, Sigebert, Lady Ebbe, Alurede, Elgured, Edricus, and King Harolde&#146;. Blenerhasset's contribution to the project marks a change in emphasis. Baldwin's original version used episodes from English history to reflect on the present, whereas Blenerhasset&#151;like Higgins&#151;simply tells patriotic stories of England's past. In 1610 ten of these poems of Blenerhasset were included in a complete reprint of the various parts of the <span class="italic">Mirrour for Magistrates</span> undertaken by Richard Niccols.<br>
<br>Blenerhasset's literary work also included&#151;non-extant&#151;a translation of Ovid's <span class="italic">De remedio amoris</span>, executed while at Cambridge but never printed, and a sophisticated poem called <span class="italic">A Revelation of the True Minerva</span>, a panegyric describing Queen Elizabeth's triumph over mutability printed in London in 1582, but of which only one copy, recently in the Heber collection, is known to be extant.<br>
<br>Blenerhasset notes in his dedication of the latter to Lady Leighton, one of the ladies of the queen's privy chamber, that he had taken part in long voyages into the Atlantic. He was named as one of Sir Edward Denny's discharged soldiers in Ireland on 10 April 1589. On 12 May of the same year he is recorded as a freeholder granted 6000 acres by Denny and as having numerous farmers, copyholders, and cottagers in his command. Denny appears to have used Blenerhasset as an intermediary in his feud with Sir William Herbert. It is likely that Blenerhasset remained in Ireland for much of the rest of his life, although he returned to Norfolk with his brother in 1605 or 1606 to deal with property affairs.<br>
<br>In 1610 Blenerhasset was one of the &#145;undertakers&#146; for the plantation of Ulster, and wrote a brief pamphlet dedicated to Prince Henry, entitled <span class="italic">A Direction for the Plantation in Ulster</span>. Here he argued that fortified garrison towns would be required to help extirpate the recalcitrant Irish and make the plantation profitable and successful both for the settlers and the crown. In 1611 he received 2000 acres at Clancally in co. Fermanagh, and in 1612, with thirty-nine others, appealed to the lord deputy, Sir Arthur Chichester, to grant them jointly a part of Sligo, 60,000 acres in co. Fermanagh, and some neighbouring territory, on their undertaking to expend &pound;40,000 on the land, and to settle upon it 1000 &#145;able men furnished for all kinds of handiwork&#146;. In his signature to this appeal Blenerhasset describes himself as being still of Horsford, Norfolk. In 1624 Blenerhasset was stated to own the barony of Lurge and two proportions of Eddernagh and Tullenageane in co. Fermanagh. Blenerhasset died on 11 March 1624, having just built a residence called Castlehasset on the shore of Lough Erne. His father's will proves him to have been married before 1598, and to have had several children. At least two, Lennard and Samuel, survived him. Sir Edward Blenerhasset, who shared with him several grants of Irish land, died in 1618, both having become substantial landowners in Ireland.<br>
