<span class="headword">Townshend,  Horatio</span>, first Viscount Townshend  (<em>bap. </em>1630, <em>d.</em> 1687), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was baptized on 16 December 1630 at Stiffkey, Norfolk, the second son of Sir Roger Townshend, first baronet (1595&#150;1637), of Raynham, Norfolk, and his wife, Lady Mary (<i>c</i>.1611&#150;1669), daughter and coheir of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28211/', "Horace Vere, Baron Vere of Tilbury")</script>. His mother remarried on 21 June 1638, her new husband being <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9139/', "Mildmay Fane, second earl of Westmorland")</script>. Townshend and his elder brother, Roger (1628&#150;1648), matriculated at St John's College, Cambridge, on 9 November 1644 and graduated MA on 27 November 1645. On 16 December 1646 they received leave from parliament to travel abroad for three years. After they had visited France, and with a visit to Rome planned, Roger died in Geneva some time before 13 July 1648. Townshend returned home as the third baronet and shortly after was married (articles, 22 October 1649) to Mary (1634&#150;1673), daughter and sole heir of Edward Lewkenor, of Denham, Suffolk. They had no children.<br>
<br>Townshend began to play a small role in local government, being nominated to parliamentary commissions in 1649 and serving as a JP from 1652. He sat in the protectorate parliaments of 1656 and 1659, but by the latter date he was working in favour of a restoration of the monarchy. Clarendon later recalled that he was &#145;a gentleman of the greatest interest and credit&#146; in Norfolk, and was &#145;liable to no reproach or jealousy&#146; because he had been too young to fight in the civil wars  (Rosenheim, 19). He seems to have been ready to raise the county in 1659 if there was a successful royalist landing nearby. He was appointed to the council of state on 17 May 1659, but only after receiving royal permission to do so, and never actually took his seat. He played a vital role in ensuring that Lord Fairfax came out in support of General Monck, and on 28 January 1660 he delivered to the Rump an address from Norfolk in favour of a free parliament, which he subsequently presented in February to Monck. He was duly elected to the Convention Parliament for Norfolk in April 1660, and was one of the twelve representatives from the Commons sent to escort Charles II from Breda.<br>
<br>Townshend did not stand at the general election of April 1661, probably because he knew that he would shortly be raised to the peerage (20 April) as Baron Townshend of Lynn Regis. Having been a militia colonel since October 1660, he was made lord lieutenant of Norfolk in August 1661. Other local offices soon followed, including the vice-admiralty of Norfolk, and the high stewardship of King's Lynn. Another reward for his services was the farm of the coal duties, which he was granted by the crown in 1664. In politics he seems not to have been close to the old Presbyterian leadership, and he was a supporter of the lord chancellor, the earl of Clarendon. He may have voted against the <span class="roman">Corporation Act</span>, but he then proceeded against conventicles if they seemed a threat to order. He was forecast by Lord Wharton in July 1663 as likely to oppose the motion to impeach Clarendon, and he promoted some measures, such as militia legislation, which the government favoured in the Lords. He was particularly active in the militia during the Second Anglo-Dutch War when invasion threatened the east coast of England.<br>
<br>Townshend buried his first wife on 22 May 1673, and on 27 November 1673 he married Mary (1652/3&#150;1685), daughter of Sir Joseph Ashe, first baronet, of Twickenham, Middlesex. They had three sons. The birth of a male heir in 1675 seems to have changed Townshend's outlook on life and he became concerned to leave his estate in good order, his early years having led to increased indebtedness as he wrestled with outgoings for jointures, portions for his sisters, and the completion of Raynham Hall.<br>
<br>Townshend's position in Norfolk politics changed in the early 1670s when a series of by-elections caused divisions within the county. Townshend supported the candidature of Sir John Hobart, third baronet, in the Norfolk by-election of 1673, which angered the old cavaliers, and in 1675 he opposed the candidate of Lord Treasurer Danby in another by-election at King's Lynn and when the county also faced a contested by-election. At Westminster he was seen as an opponent in April&#150;June 1675 of Danby's proposal for a non-resisting test act, and on 20 November 1675 he voted for an address to Charles II in favour of a dissolution. As a consequence of this opposition to Danby's ministry, he lost his lord lieutenancy on 25 February 1676. For the next few years Townshend was associated with the country party in opposition to Danby and the Court. In 1677 he left his proxy with the earl of Shaftesbury, and was even briefly a supporter of exclusion.<br>
<br>However, Townshend was essentially a moderate figure, and the more extreme Norfolk whigs caused him to draw back towards the court. In January 1682 he disowned the whig county MPs he had helped to get elected. His reward was a step up in the peerage: on 2 December 1682 he was created Viscount Townshend. In August 1683 he signed the loyal address in the wake of the Rye House plot. His political stance in the late 1670s, however, meant that he was never in favour with James II. He spent his last years improving his estates and preparing for the likelihood that his son would succeed him as a minor. Townshend's second wife predeceased him, dying of smallpox on 17 December 1685. Townshend himself died in late November or early December 1687, after making a codicil to his will on 26 November. He was buried on 10 December 1687 at East Raynham, and was succeeded as second viscount by his eldest son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27617/', "Charles Townshend")</script>.<br>
