<span class="headword">Walsh,  John Henry</span> <span class="st"> [<em>pseud. </em>Stonehenge]</span>  (1810&#150;1888), <span class="occ">writer on sport</span>, son of Benjamin Walsh, was born at Hackney, Middlesex, on 21 October 1810, baptized at St John's, Hackney, on 22 February 1811, and educated at a private school. In 1832 he passed as a member of the Royal College of Surgeons, and in 1844 he became a fellow of the college by examination. For some time he was surgeon to the Ophthalmic Institution, and lectured on surgery and descriptive anatomy at the Aldersgate school of medicine. He married, first, on 21 July 1835, Margaret Nash Stevenson, daughter of Thomas Stevenson of Claines, Worcestershire, who died nine months later; second Susan Emily, daughter of Dr Malden of Worcester, who died eight months later.<br>
<br>By 1837 Walsh was in practice at Worcester with Thomas W. Walsh in Foregate Street and The Tything. With William Harcourt Ranking, a Norwich physician, he edited <span class="italic">The Provincial Medical and Surgical Journal</span> from 1849 to 1852. He left Worcester for London in 1852. He always had an intense love of sport, he rode well to hounds, kept greyhounds and entered them at coursing meetings, broke his own pointers and setters, and also trained hawks. He was also fond of shooting, and, owing to the bursting of his gun, lost a portion of his left hand. On 1 January 1852 he married his third wife, Louisa, eldest daughter of the Revd William Parker.<br>
<br>In 1853, under the pseudonym of Stonehenge, Walsh brought out his book <span class="italic">The greyhound, on the art of breeding, rearing, and training greyhounds for public running, their diseases and treatment</span> (3rd edn, 1875), based on articles he had written in <span class="italic">Bell's Life</span>. Three years later, in 1856, appeared <span class="italic">Manual of British Rural Sports</span>, which covers the whole cycle of field sports, and, among other things, deals in a scientific manner with the breeding of horses. It was frequently reprinted, as were <span class="italic">The Horse in the Stable and in the Field</span> (1861) and <span class="italic">A Manual of Domestic Economy Suited to Families Spending from &pound;100 to &pound;1000 a Year</span> (1857). He wrote many other books, mostly on sports but a few of them on cookery. In 1856 he originated the <span class="italic">Coursing Calendar</span>, which he conducted through fifty half-yearly volumes. About 1856 he began to write for <span class="italic">The Field</span>, and at the end of 1857 accepted the editorship.<br>
<br>Between 1858 and 1875, Walsh organized the <span class="italic">Field</span> trials of guns and rifles, which wound up the controversy as to the merits of breech-loaders and muzzle-loaders. Again, in 1878, he endeavoured to make clear what were the respective merits of Schultze and black powder, discovering that light pressure with Schultze produced better shooting than tight ramming. Other experiments led to his invention of the <span class="italic">Field</span> force gauge, which gave results more reliable than the paper pads previously in use. In 1879 another gun trial was carried out to determine the merits of 12-bores, 16-bores, and 20-bores. In 1883 he instituted the rifle trial at Putney to demonstrate and measure the accuracy of shooting of Express rifles at the target, and subsequently organized trials to ascertain the cause of so many breakages in guns, the testing of powders by the lead cylinder method, the various effects of nitro compounds, and the strain on the barrels of small bores. His comments on proof powder in <span class="italic">The Field</span>, when he stated that the powder used in testing gun barrels was 50 per cent below the proof required, led to an action, <i>Birmingham Proof House Guardians v. Walsh</i>, in which a verdict was given against him of 40<i>s</i>. damages. However, the guardians' reluctance to provide powder for independent experts to test made a bad impression, and ultimately Walsh succeeded in obtaining some useful changes.<br>
<br>Walsh was one of the founders of the National Coursing Club and of the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club, and he was on the committee of the Kennel Club. He was a good chess player, and on the managing committees of several clubs. He died at his home, 7 Montserrat Road, Putney, London, on 12 February 1888, owing to sudden complications from kidney stones, and was buried on 16 February in the old cemetery at Putney Common. He was survived by his third wife and two daughters.<br>
