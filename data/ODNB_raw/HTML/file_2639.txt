<span class="headword">Blennerhasset,  Harman</span>  (1764/5&#150;1831), <span class="occ">lawyer and settler in America</span>, born in Hampshire on 8 October 1764 or 1765, was the youngest of the three sons of Conway Blennerhasset of Conway Castle, Killorglin, co. Kerry, Ireland, and his wife, the daughter of Major Thomas Lacy, the descendant of an old Anglo-Norman family. He was educated at Westminster School and Trinity College, Dublin, where he graduated BA in 1790 and LLB in the same year. Having, through the death of his elder brothers, succeeded to the family estates, he spent some time travelling in Europe. During this period he became a republican and resolved to settle in the United States of America. While in England he met and married Margaret Agnew (<i>d</i>. 1842), the daughter of the lieutenant-governor of the Isle of Man. After disposing of his lands to a relative, and supplying himself with an extensive library and scientific apparatus, he sailed for New York in 1796. In 1798 he purchased part of Blennerhasset Island on the Ohio, about 2 miles below Parkersburg, West Virginia, and there lived a retired and studious life. However, in 1806 he became implicated in the treasonable schemes of Aaron Burr without properly realizing their intent. In support of the views of Burr he published a series of papers in the <span class="italic">Ohio Gazette</span>, under the signature of Querist, and spent much of his fortune on boats, provisions, and arms for Burr's contemplated expedition against Mexico, then a territory of Spain, with which the USA was at peace. In the spring of 1807 he was arrested, and although he regained his liberty his fine house was destroyed and looted during his absence. He then turned successively to cotton growing in Mississippi (1807&#150;19), legal practice in Montreal (1819&#150;22), and an attempt to recover his lands in Ireland. Having failed in all three undertakings, he retired to Guernsey, where he died in 1831.<br>
<br>The involvement of Blennerhassett and his wife in the ill-fated schemes of Burr has inspired several novels, including those by William Venable (<span class="italic">A Dream of Empire</span>, 1901), Charles Pidgin (<span class="italic">Blennerhassett, or, The Decrees of Fate</span>, 1901), Edward Stanley (<span class="italic">The Rock Cried Out</span>, 1949), and Marie Wood (<span class="italic">None Called him Neighbour</span>, 1951), and a play by Pidgin (<span class="italic">Blennerhassett, or, The Irony of Fate</span>, 1901), as well as considerable interest in their house on Blennerhasset Island. He was a strikingly unsuccessful man, but his failures were romantic enough to inspire and sustain popular interest.<br>
