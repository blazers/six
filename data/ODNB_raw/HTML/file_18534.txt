<span class="headword">Mellor, Sir  John</span>  (1809&#150;1887), <span class="occ">judge</span>, was born on 1 January 1809 at Hollinwood House, Oldham, Lancashire, the son of John Mellor and his wife (of whom little is known). His father came from an old south Lancashire family and as well as being a partner in the firm of Gee, Mellor, Kershaw &amp; Co., was mayor of the borough of Leicester and justice of the peace there. Mellor was educated at the Leicester grammar school, and afterwards under Charles Berry, a Unitarian minister of Leicester. His schooling caused him to consider the merits of religious belief at an early age and, as a young man, he followed the Unitarian notion in rejecting the idea of subscription to any religious dogma. As a result, he was unwilling to subscribe to the <span class="roman">Thirty-Nine Articles</span> and so had to abandon his plan to attend university at Lincoln College, Oxford. Instead, he read for some time in the office of a Leicester attorney and was admitted as a student to the Inner Temple on 5 June 1828. He then read in the chambers of Thomas Chitty for four years, attended Austin's lectures at University College, London, and was called to the bar on 7 June 1833. On 24 September of the same year he married Elizabeth Cooke Moseley; they had eight sons.<br>
<br>Mellor joined the midland circuit, and practised at the parliamentary bar, at assizes, and (both civil and criminal cases) at Leicester borough and Warwick sessions. After taking silk in 1851 he became leader of the circuit. From 1849 to 1852 he was recorder of Warwick, and from 1855 to 1861 recorder of Leicester. After unsuccessful attempts to be elected as a Liberal for Warwick (1852) and Coventry (1857), in 1857 he was elected for Great Yarmouth, and at the general election of 1859 was returned for Nottingham, but tended to speak little in parliament.<br>
<br>On 3 December 1861 Mellor succeeded Mr Justice Hill in the queen's bench; he was knighted on 11 June 1862. He was a member of the special commission which tried Fenian prisoners at Manchester in 1867 and of the court which tried Arthur Orton, alias Castro, for perjury in claiming to be the long-lost Roger Tichborne in the highly celebrated Tichborne case of 1873. During this unusually protracted trial Mellor often amused the jury with his dry humour, and concluded the proceedings by reading out the long sentence of guilt. Deafness led him to retire in June 1879 when he was given a pension and was sworn of the privy council; he settled on the Kent coast at this time. Although retired, he often attended the judicial committee, went the northern circuit once as commissioner of assize, and frequently acted as an arbitrator in important cases. He also pursued his interest in the activities of his local lifeboat. He died at his London house, 16 Sussex Square, Hyde Park, on 26 April 1887, and was buried on 30 April in Kingsdown churchyard, near his home in Kent. Mellor wrote several papers dealing with religious issues and the question of the oath in court and in parliament.<br>
