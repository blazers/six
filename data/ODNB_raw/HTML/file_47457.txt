<span class="headword">Newby,  Thomas Cautley</span>  (1797&#150;1882), <span class="occ">publisher and printer</span>, was born in Cambridge, where he was baptized on 26 December 1797, the fifth son of John Newby (1760&#150;1828), a coal merchant and clerk to the chapel of Trinity College, Cambridge, and his wife, Anne. In 1821 he acquired the business of the printer and bookseller John Rackham at Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, where he married Anne Elizabeth Craig, with whom he had at least two daughters and one son. By 1843 he had offices in London at 65 Mortimer Street, Cavendish Square, a year later at 72 Mortimer Street, and from 1849 to March 1874 at 30 Welbeck Street, Cavendish Square. About two-thirds of the titles he published were fiction, the rest were non-fiction works such as history, biography, memoirs, travel accounts, translations, and a few works of poetry, drama, and music. <br>
<br>Newby has won literary notoriety as the publisher of first novels by Emily and Anne Bront&euml; (Ellis Bell and Acton Bell), <span class="italic">Wuthering Heights</span> and <span class="italic">Agnes Grey</span>, in a single three-volume edition of December 1847. Newby first asked for a deposit of &pound;50 to cover costs of publication, but kept the corrected proofs until the successful appearance of Charlotte Bront&euml;'s (Currer Bell's) <span class="italic">Jane Eyre</span>, published by Smith Elder in October 1847. Newby then printed fewer than the agreed number of Emily's and Anne's novels and left most errors uncorrected. When Anne sent him her second novel, <span class="italic">The Tenant of Wildfell Hall</span> (1848), Newby offered it to Harper Brothers of New York for publication in America, implying it was by Currer Bell. Charlotte Bront&euml;'s biographer Elizabeth Gaskell had to be restrained from exposing Newby as a warning to other writers, initially naming him as one of the &#145;three people I want to libel&#146;. She referred to him as &#145;the mean publisher to be gibbetted&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters of Mrs Gaskell</span>, 418). <br>
<br>In 1847 Newby also published Anthony Trollope's first novel, <span class="italic">The Macdermots of Ballycloran</span>, after holding the manuscript for over a year. Newby had agreed to divide the profits after costs but evidently printed only enough copies to reimburse himself and barely advertised, so Trollope got nothing. <br>
<br>Two other well-known writers lost money from Newby's publishing of their first novels: Eliza Lynn Linton with <span class="italic">Azeth, the Egyptian</span> (1847) and Charlotte Riddell with <span class="italic">Zuriel's Grandchild</span> (1855). On occasion Newby verged on plagiarism. In 1844 he published William North's <span class="italic">Anti-Coningsby, or, The New Generation Grown Old. By an Embryo M. P.</span>, a satire on Benjamin Disraeli's <span class="italic">Coningsby, or, The New Generation</span> (1844) and in 1845 North's <span class="italic">The Impostor, or, Born without a Conscience: by the Author of &#145;Anti-Coningsby&#146;</span>. After publication of George Eliot's highly lauded <span class="italic">Adam Bede</span> (1859), Newby advertised <span class="italic">Adam Bede, Junior: a Sequel</span>, to be published in 1859, causing an angry exchange of letters in <span class="italic">The Times</span>: G. H. Lewes declared that Eliot was not the first to suffer from Newby's method of trading, but Newby blithely asserted his innocence with respect to the two Bront&euml;s. <br>
<br>In spite of shifty practices, Newby satisfied a legion of minor writers who repeatedly offered him manuscripts; for example, he published about twenty-two novels by [Mrs?] Robert Mackenzie Daniel, about fourteen novels by George Payne Rainsford James (<span class="italic">Leonora d'Orco</span>, 1857, became a best-seller), a number of sea romances by Francis Claudius Armstrong, and historical romances by Louis Alexis Chamerovzow. In non-fiction he responded astutely to contemporary interest in great men, foreign countries, the occult, self-help, scientific enquiry, the military, religion, sport, and the arts. <br>
<br>Thomas Cautley Newby died on 14 June 1882 at his daughter's home, 12 Westbourne Gardens, Folkestone, Kent, aged eighty-four; he was survived by a daughter, the next of kin, Marion Garling. He was buried at St Peter's Church, Southborough, Kent.<br>
