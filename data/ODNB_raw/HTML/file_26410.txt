<span class="headword">Stearne <span class="st"> [Sterne]</span>,  John</span>  (1624&#150;1669), <span class="occ">physician and founder of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland</span>, was born on 26 November 1624 at Ardbraccan, co. Meath, the son of John Stearne of Greenacre, co. Down, and his wife, Mabel Bermingham of Ballogh, co. Dublin, a niece of primate James Ussher of Armagh and great-niece of primate Henry Ussher, the first fellow of Trinity College, Dublin, nominated in the charter of Queen Elizabeth. John Stearne was a direct descendant of James Stanihurst, who was speaker of the Irish House of Commons in the reigns of queens Mary and Elizabeth and it was he who first proposed the founding of a college and university in Dublin. Stearne's father was from Stapleford in Cambridgeshire and came to Ireland as officer to Theophilus Buckworth, bishop of Dromore.<br>
<br>Stearne became a student at Trinity College, Dublin, in 1639 and two years later he was awarded a scholarship. His study was interrupted by the rebellion of 1641. Stearne took refuge in Cambridge, where he studied at Sidney Sussex College, which was at that time the favoured college for students interested in medicine. During his time at Cambridge he collected material for his book <span class="italic">Animi medela</span> (1653). He graduated BA in 1643 and MA in 1646. He spent a short period in Oxford before returning to Trinity in 1651. Stearne had been made a fellow of Trinity in 1643 but had been ejected by the Rump; he was restored on his return to Trinity. There is no record of his having taken any degree in Dublin but it is almost certain that he took his doctor's degree in both laws and medicine. He was appointed registrar of Trinity College in 1652 and he also began to practise as a physician in Dublin.<br>
<br>In 1654 Stearne proposed to Trinity College, Dublin, that he should be appointed president of Trinity Hall, which stood in Trinity Place, off Dame Street, a short distance from the college, and which had served as a hall of residence for students before the rebellion. The hall was in a ruinous state at the time and Stearne was to be allowed accommodation in it provided he repaired the building from his own resources and made space available in it for physicians to meet as a fraternity or college of physicians. However, Stearne was not able to develop the proposal fully at this stage, probably because of the political instability. Stearne was appointed as the first lecturer in Hebrew at Trinity College in 1656 and at the time he was also professor of physic. Arrangements appertaining to the Hebrew lectureship did not go smoothly and Stearne had a disagreement with the provost and senior fellows of the college. It may have been this dispute together with political considerations that prompted Stearne to resign his fellowship of the college in 1659.<br>
<br>On the restoration of the monarchy in 1660 Stearne was nominated to fellowship and he was also appointed public professor of laws. Stearne renewed his former proposal to the board of Trinity College with regard to Trinity Hall and a college of physicians. The proposal was approved in 1661 and six years later the physicians received a charter from Charles II. This charter decreed that John Stearne should be the first president of the College of Physicians and that he should hold the office for life. Sir William Petty was one of the original fourteen fellows of the new college. The provisions granted in the charter were similar to those already enjoyed by the London college. In 1662 Stearne was also elected public professor of medicine and in the following year he was granted &pound;60 a year as a payment for his professorship.<br>
<br>Stearne was the author of several published works. His book <span class="italic">Animi medela</span> (dedicated to Henry Cromwell) discusses the best cure (<i>medela</i>) for the troubled mind which would enable an individual to live serenely despite great physical deprivations. In general his works cover a range of theological, philosophical, and medical subjects reflecting the interests of the author. He drew his inspiration primarily from the work of the stoics and he was particularly influenced by Seneca, Epictetus, and Antonius. Stearne's conversion to stoicism occurred just before his return to Dublin when his peaceful life in Cambridge had been wrecked by the political turmoil of the period, and when he found that the same upheaval was likely to happen at Oxford. He did not become a partisan in the religious debates raging at the time and his works reveal a tolerant mind. He believed that every man had a right to his opinion and that a wise man would not openly challenge the wish of the multitude. He advocated a private rather than a public life and recommended the study of the misfortunes of society purely as an intellectual exercise. Stearne himself adapted to different political regimes during his lifetime, managing to find favour with both puritans and royalists.<br>
<br>Stearne married Dorothy, daughter of Charles Ryves, examiner in the chancery of Ireland, in 1659, and after their marriage they moved into the refurbished Trinity Hall. They had three daughters and a son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26411/', "John Stearne (1660&#150;1745)")</script>, who became dean of St Patrick's Cathedral and vice-chancellor of Trinity College, Dublin. He founded and endowed the university printing house in 1734.<br>
<br>Stearne died in Dublin on 18 November 1669 and was buried in the chapel of Trinity College. A marble plaque which marked the site was preserved when the church was demolished in 1798. It was subsequently placed within the porch of the rebuilt chapel on the left of the entrance door. It was inscribed with an epitaph by his friend Henry Dodwell the elder, who described Stearne as &#145;Philosophus, Medicus, Summusque Theologicus Idem&#146;. The new Trinity College medical library at St James's Hospital was named the John Stearne Library in 1993.<br>
