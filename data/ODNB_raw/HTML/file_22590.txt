<span class="headword">Pory,  John</span>  (1502/3&#150;1570), <span class="occ">college head</span>, was born at Thompson, Norfolk. He entered Corpus Christi in 1520 and was thus an exact contemporary of Matthew Parker, whose friendship was influential in his subsequent career. Graduating as BA in 1524 and MA in 1527 and having taken priest's orders, both Pory and Parker qualified by October 1527 for admission to a college fellowship and a year later served jointly as keepers of the keys. After obtaining the degree of BTh in 1535 Pory made no attempt to proceed further; college affairs increasingly absorbed him. Here his conscientious discharge of duties, attention to detail, and a compliant attitude to higher authority secured him a valued and lasting place in the fellowship. When Parker returned to Corpus as master in 1544 Pory was already president and actively assisted him in reforms of administration and accounting. Pory was also a fellow of the college of St John the Baptist, Stoke by Clare, Suffolk, of which Parker was dean.<br>
<br>Pory retained his fellowship during Mary's reign and in December 1557 succeeded to the mastership. Widely seen as acceptable to all parties, he was elected vice-chancellor of the university in December 1558 for a short tenure which saw the arrival of William Cecil as chancellor and of the Elizabethan commissioners. To grace his office he was awarded the degree of DTh. On the visit of Queen Elizabeth to Cambridge in August 1564 Pory was chosen as one of the four doctors holding the canopy at her entry to King's College chapel and also to speak in the (Latin) theology debate next day. He subsequently attended the queen on a similar visit to Oxford in 1566 and was there incorporated as DTh. Preferments accrued to him: the Norfolk benefices of Bunwell (1555&#150;64), St Stephen's, Norwich (1556&#150;61), and Pulham St Mary (1560&#150;63); and the rectories of Landbeach, Cambridgeshire (1558&#150;69), and of Lambeth (1563&#150;70). Parker procured for him a prebend at Ely (December 1559), exchanged for one at Canterbury (1564), and this for one at Westminster (1569).<br>
<br>In Corpus, Pory restored reformed accounting and tackled shortage of space, made more acute by the archbishop's foundation of scholarships. Building work included contriving habitable attic rooms on the west side of the court and constructing a new library above the kitchen, fitted to house the library left by Peter Nobys on the south side, with equivalent space on the north reserved for the archbishop's anticipated donations. However, by 1569 it was clear that with failing health Pory was unequal to his work. He was frequently absent from college and his personal authority was openly flouted by younger dissidents. Private pressure followed by official proceedings instigated by Parker finally induced a reluctant Pory to resign the mastership on 1 February 1570 and relinquish his cherished preferments. With &#145;his joy gone&#146; and &#145;but a poor man&#146;  (<span class="italic">Correspondence of Matthew Parker</span>, 358&#150;9), he made his will (7 May 1570) and died, aged sixty-seven, at Thompson, where he was buried on 25 June 1570. The John Pory who attended Parker's funeral on 6 August 1575 as a conductor yeoman was probably his nephew.<br>
