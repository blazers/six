<span class="headword">Sitwell,  George</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1601, <em>d.</em> 1667), <span class="occ">landowner and ironmaster</span>, was born at Eckington, Derbyshire, where he was baptized on 15 March 1601, the eldest son of George Sitwell (1569&#150;1607) and Mary, daughter of Thomas Walker of Derby, who later married Henry Wigfall, also of Eckington. The Sitwells rose steadily during the sixteenth century from freeholders to gentry through the acquisition of land in Eckington and neighbouring parishes, a transition completed by George Sitwell, who was a JP, served as high sheriff of Derbyshire in 1653, and received a grant of arms in 1660, which he produced, together with a pedigree, at Dugdale's visitation of the county two years later. The family's rise was confirmed by the building of Renishaw Hall at Eckington, probably in the 1620s, which became the centre of their estate and remains their home today.<br>
<br>Sitwell, in common with many landowners of his day, supplemented his income from land through the exploitation of minerals beneath his estate, in his case chiefly iron. His involvement in the industry probably began with the building of a blast furnace at Plumbley, near Eckington, in the 1630s, jointly with his stepfather, Henry Wigfall. This partnership came to an end in 1649 and three years later Sitwell alone built a new furnace at Foxbrooke, close to Renishaw, which by the 1660s was the nucleus of the most extensive group of ironworks anywhere in Derbyshire or Nottinghamshire, including two other furnaces (at Staveley and North Wingfield) and forges at Staveley, Pleasley, Clipstone, and Cuckney. Sitwell also made saws at Pleasley and in 1656 installed near Renishaw the first rolling and slitting mill in the east midlands, the rod iron from which supplied a large number of local nailmakers.<br>
<br>Sitwell remained in personal control of his works until his death and a letter-book covering the last few years of his career shows that he was in business on a large scale, producing pig and bar iron, castings, saws, nails, and other finished goods for sale both locally and in London, where a cousin acted as his factor. Some products, including rolling mills for the West Indies sugar plantations, went abroad. Sitwell sent iron to London both by water (via the River Idle at Bawtry) and by road, employing his own private carrier as well as using public stage wagons. His correspondence also shows how closely a country landowner could keep in touch with public affairs in the capital through his commercial contacts; in addition, although by this date in his sixties, Sitwell visited London regularly. At home, he made extensive purchases of wood from both the crown and private owners in Sherwood and elsewhere, and was an important figure in an extensive regional credit network. He was also much involved in administrative business as a JP at parish and hundred level and to a lesser extent in the county as a whole.<br>
<br>Sitwell, who married Margaret, the daughter of Hugh Childers of Carr House, near Doncaster, was buried at Eckington on 2 August 1667; his wife died in 1658 and was also buried at Eckington. Of their five sons and two daughters who survived into adult life the eldest son continued his father's iron-making activities from his seat at Renishaw and two others became London iron merchants. In the 1690s, however, the works were leased and, although they retained direct management of their collieries until the mid-eighteenth century, the family were henceforth principally landowners, merely drawing rent from industrial enterprises on their estate. Wealth accumulated from both land and industry would later enable Sir G. R. Sitwell (1860&#150;1943) and his children, Osbert, Sacheverell, and Edith to pursue their various literary careers.<br>
