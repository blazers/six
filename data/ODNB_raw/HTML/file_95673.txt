<span class="headword">Marwick,  Allan Graham</span>  (1877&#150;1966), <span class="occ">colonial administrator</span>, was born at Richmond, Natal, the fourth surviving son of Thomas Marwick, a blacksmith and wagon builder who had come to Natal from the Orkney Islands, and his wife, Elizabeth, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Mackenzie, who had come with her family from Caithness. He attended school in Richmond and in 1895 joined the Natal civil service, in which two of his brothers, John and Robert, also served. They were known for their exceptional fluency in the Zulu language: he and his brother John, who later became prominent in South Africa as a labour recruiter and Natal politician, are said to have tested this by walking through the night with a party of Zulu migrants, who were shocked to discover in the morning that the companions with whom they had been chatting were white youths. He joined the border mounted horse on the outbreak of the South African War in 1899 and was in Ladysmith during the siege.<br>
<br>Marwick was appointed native sub-commissioner in Mbabane, Swaziland, in January 1903, thus becoming a founder member of a skeletal administration. The country was administered through the Transvaal until 1906 when it became a high commission territory. Marwick became assistant commissioner (equivalent to district commissioner) in Mbabane in 1907 and remained in that position until 1916. The defining moment of his life came in the later months of 1907, when he acted as official escort and interpreter for a Swazi deputation to London led by Prince Malunge, the favourite son of the queen regent, Labotsibeni. Its main object was to protest against the land partition that was about to be pushed through by the resident commissioner, Robert Coryndon, and a special commissioner, George Grey, brother of the British foreign secretary. Marwick was present at an interview with the colonial secretary, Lord Elgin. He interpreted the latter as giving an assurance that the third of Swaziland that was designated as crown land would be made available for Swazi occupation. This promise was soon repudiated when the high commissioner, Lord Selborne, permitted crown land to be sold to white settlers to raise revenue. When the Swazi protested, Marwick stood by his interpretation of Lord Elgin's words and continued to argue throughout his life that the Swazi had been betrayed. Through his steadfastness on this issue and his friendship with Prince Malunge, who died in 1915, Marwick gained the respect of the Swazi royal family. He performed a further service for them when he escorted a deputation to inspect Lovedale, the school in the eastern Cape chosen for the education of the young heir to the throne, Sobhuza, who was installed as paramount chief in 1921. Marwick became a mentor to the future king and remained his lifelong friend.<br>
<br>From 1916 to 1932 Marwick served as assistant commissioner in the southern district of Hlatikulu. In the latter year he returned to Mbabane as assistant commissioner and deputy resident commissioner. The Pim report of January 1932 had been politely critical of the administration, and recommended Marwick's appointment as deputy resident commissioner with special responsibility for native affairs and &#145;the framing of native policy&#146;  (&#145;Financial and economic situation of Swaziland&#146;, <span class="italic">Part papers</span>, 1932, Cmd 4114, 44). He was promoted resident commissioner in 1935, holding that post until his retirement in 1937.<br>
<br>The Swazi were under pressure from the late 1920s to accept some form of &#145;indirect rule&#146;. Marwick was always sceptical about this doctrine. He believed that the &#145;traditional&#146; constitution of the Swazi nation was an adequate basis for modernization and that, as a result of agreements with the Swazi, the British government had no legal right to interfere with it. With Pixley Seme, the South African lawyer and founder of the South African Native National Congress, he was the co-editor of a document entitled &#145;The original Swazi political organization&#146;. This was the founding text of Swazi &#145;traditionalism&#146;, of which Marwick became a leading ideologist. In the early 1930s he sought to enlist the support of several social anthropologists, including Winifred Hoernl&eacute;, Isaac Schapera, and Bronislaw Malinowski, and the philosopher and educationist John Dewey, all of whom visited Swaziland.<br>
<br>After his retirement in 1937 Marwick remained in Mbabane and devoted himself to tireless campaigning against legislation that purported to give the colonial government the right to appoint or dismiss the paramount chief and subordinate chiefs. He provided many of the arguments that were incorporated in the Swazi petition of 1942 and used his knowledge of the inner workings of the administration and the Dominions Office to advise Sobhuza on how to deal with, and to outwit, his various successors as resident commissioner. The proclamation of 1950 recognizing the paramount chief as the sole native authority in Swaziland was as much a victory for Marwick as for Sobhuza. His historical critique of the &#145;perfidy&#146; of the British in their dealings with the Swazi over eighty years was brought together in an official publication, <span class="italic">The Attitude of the Swazi towards Government and its Causes</span> (1955). This was the best-documented and most damning indictment of British colonial policy ever written by a long-serving official and it is not surprising that it was rapidly suppressed. His last years were clouded by the clash between his nephew, Sir Brian Marwick, and Sobhuza over the pace of change towards democracy in Swaziland. Sobhuza believed that Allan Marwick took his side against Sir Brian, and sympathized with him over his wayward &#145;child&#146;.<br>
<br>Marwick was described by Sobhuza in 1935 as &#145;a Swazilander in the truest sense of the word&#146;  (<span class="italic">Times of Swaziland</span>, 7 Nov 1935), and by Alan Booth as &#145;the most trusted colonial official of all in the eyes of the Swazi monarchy and chiefdom&#146;  (Booth, 254). He was appointed OBE in 1925, but he told Margery Perham that the greatest compliment that he had ever received was to be made an honorary member of the general council of the Swazi nation&#151;the <i>libandhla</i>&#151;in 1937. He had the Swazi appellation <i>ndhlavela</i>, a reference to the regiment or age grade to which he belonged. He was married to Kathleen Parker, with whom he had a son, Toby, and daughter, Hazel. He died in Mbabane on 7 October 1966, and was survived by his two children, his wife having predeceased him. In a eulogy at his funeral one of King Sobhuza's representatives, Mfundza Sukati, said: &#145;One of the pillars of the Swazi Nation has fallen&#146;  (<span class="italic">Times of Swaziland</span>, 14 Oct 1966).<br>
