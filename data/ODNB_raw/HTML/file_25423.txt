<span class="headword">Sherley <span class="st"> [Shirley]</span>,  Anthony</span> <span class="st"> [<em>known as </em>Sir Anthony Sherley]</span>, Count Sherley in the nobility of the Holy Roman empire  (1565&#150;1636?), <span class="occ">adventurer and diplomat in the Persian service</span>, was born at the family estate of Wiston in Sussex, one of nine children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25435/', "Sir Thomas Sherley (c.1542&#150;1612)")</script> and Anne Kempe (<i>c</i>.1542&#150;1623), daughter of Sir Thomas Kempe of Ollantighe, Kent, and brother to <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25436/', "Sir Thomas Sherley")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25433/', "Sir Robert Shirley")</script>. Having matriculated from Hart Hall, Oxford, in 1579 and after graduating BA in 1581, in November 1582 he was elected a probationer fellow of All Souls College, a position he held until 1589. In 1583 he was admitted to the Inner Temple.<h2>
<a name="WarintheLowCountriesandBrittany"></a>War in the Low Countries and Brittany</h2>Having acquired, as he was later to write, &#145;those learnings which were fit for a Gentlemans ornament, without directing them to an occupation&#146;  (<span class="italic">Sir Anthony Sherley His Relation</span>, 1) Sherley left England in 1586 to serve as a captain of infantry under Robert Dudley, earl of Leicester, in the wars in the Low Countries. He first saw action at Brielle, commanding an undisciplined garrison company. In 1588, after his brother Thomas's inept performance at Zwolle, he was assigned to the remnants of Thomas's cavalry company; however, upon taking charge it was clear that the force was woefully undermanned. The company was disbanded and Sherley was sent home.<br>
<br>After the Spanish capture of the Breton ports in 1591 Sherley returned to the continent to command one of the earl of Essex's three regiments. Though the campaign itself proved indecisive, in June Sherley distinguished himself in battle near Ch&acirc;telaudren when a sizeable Spanish force of some 500 horse and 6000 foot descended upon the English. Hard pressed, Sherley led the English cavalry against the attackers, personally killing a Spanish captain, and was credited with single-handedly turning the tide of the battle. The next day, with a force of only fifteen horse, Sherley repulsed a Spanish counter-attack, though his own horse was shot from under him; his courageous conduct during these actions earned him a reputation for bravery and noblesse which served him well for much of his life.<br>
<br>Early in 1593 Sherley was dispatched on a mission to the French court where Henri IV awarded him the knighthood of the order of St Michel. Elizabeth I was furious that he had accepted a foreign honour without her permission and recalled him to England. He was questioned extensively by Lord Keeper Sir John Puckering and Lord Buckhurst about the details of the oath he had taken; when his answers were found inadequate he was tossed in the Fleet prison. When he was released shortly afterwards it was on condition that he resign the robes of the order. Though the title no longer had any official sanction he was commonly known as Sir Anthony.<h2>
<a name="Privateering"></a>Privateering</h2>At some point in 1594 Sherley secretly married Frances (<i>bap</i>. 1573), daughter of Sir John Vernon of Hodnet, Shropshire, and first cousin to Robert Devereux, second earl of Essex. Although the union brought him closer to the earl, whom he was later to call the &#145;patterne of my civill life&#146; and &#145;a worthy modell of all my actions&#146;  (<span class="italic">Sir Anthony Sherley His Relation</span>, 2), it also incurred the queen's displeasure. As a result he was exiled from court and moved to Inglefield, in Tilehurst, Berkshire, a property sold to him by Essex. Unfortunately the union did not prove happy, and to escape his domestic situation he fitted out an expedition against the Portuguese settlement on the island of S&atilde;o Thom&eacute;, in the Gulf of Guinea. Aided by his father Sherley equipped a fleet of eleven ships and an army of 1500 men at the cost of at least &pound;15,000. However, in order to procure a commission legitimizing his attack he was forced to surrender four ships and 500 men to Essex for his raid on Cadiz. With a much reduced fleet Sherley set sail on 20 May 1596.<br>
<br>Ill fortune dogged the venture from the start as contrary winds caused the sacking of S&atilde;o Thom&eacute; to be abandoned and disease left Sherley despairing for his life. Instead the fleet sailed for S&atilde;o Tiago, in the Cape Verde Islands. Here they seized and held the town for two days against some 3000 Portuguese; however, there proved little worth taking and so they continued 10 miles down the coast to the fortified town of Ribeira Grande (now Cidade Velha). In the ensuing battle Sherley's force lost eighty men while inflicting 250 casualties on the Portuguese, but the English feared a counter-attack and so fled back to their ships, resolving to sail across the Atlantic.<br>
<br>The crossing proved wretched and disease again took its toll. On 17 October the fleet put in at Dominica in the Leeward Islands for six weeks to let the crew recover. Early in February 1597, after one ship mutinied near the mouth of the River Magdalena in Colombia, the remains of the fleet landed in the Spanish territory of Jamaica. Set on plunder Sherley marched a sizeable force 6 miles inland to the capital, Santiago de la Veda (now Spanish Town), only to find it deserted and the pickings slim. Putting to sea once more all but one of his remaining ships mutinied off Havana and so Sherley was forced to curtail his voyage. He returned to Dover in July, alive but poor.<h2>
<a name="ThePersianmission"></a>The Persian mission</h2>Searching for some way to abate his family's ailing fortunes, in winter 1598 Sherley accepted Essex's invitation to conduct a small company of English volunteers to Ferrara to assist Don Cesare d'Este, the late duke's illegitimate son, in his claim to the duchy against Pope Clement VIII. With twenty-five English volunteers Sherley left England in spring 1598; but upon reaching Augsburg he received word that Don Cesare had capitulated. Even though the apparent pretence for the mission had evaporated Sherley continued to Venice, where he was joined by his brother Robert. According to his subsequent account, while in Venice Anthony wrote to Essex, who advised him to continue to Persia for the glory of God and to find parts fit for English navigation. Others were more cynical and charged that having wrung &pound;400 from English merchants in Constantinople and a further &pound;500 from those in Aleppo, billing the sums to Essex, he had gone to seek his fortune  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1598&#150;1601</i>, 130). Either way the enterprise lacked official sanction. According to a letter of April 1601 penned by the English Jesuit Robert Persons, Sherley became a Catholic during his stay in Venice.<br>
<br>By all accounts Sherley's party was well received in Persia with Sherley granted the rank of <i>mirza</i>. But after a stay of five months, Shah &#145;Abbas accepted Sherley's offer to return to Europe as his ambassador to the Christian potentates, charged with engineering an alliance between Persia and Christendom against the Turks; in exchange for Christian support Persia was to be opened up to Christian merchants. Despite the fact that such an alliance would be injurious to English mercantile interests in the region, its terms seem to betray Sherley's influence, for the shah also promised to force the Armenian church to submit to Rome.<br>
<br>Leaving his brother Robert behind as a hostage, Anthony Sherley left Persia in May 1599, accompanied by Hasain Ali Beg Bayat and an Augustinian friar, Nicol&ograve; de Mello. Equipped with an array of gifts for the princes of Europe the party travelled north via the Caspian. But by the time they reached Moscow, Sherley and the friar were at odds: de Mello accused Sherley of stealing 1000 crowns and ninety diamonds from him, while Sherley accused the friar of sodomizing two of his attendants. To this end Sherley denounced de Mello to Tsar Boris Godunov, who had the friar stripped of his possessions and put in a monastery. But Sherley's haughty airs irritated the tsar, for when the party was summoned to an audience he refused to enter behind the Persians, arguing that it was the height of indignity for a Christian to walk behind pagans.<br>
<br>Early in 1600 the party left for Archangel. There Sherley persuaded Hasain Ali Beg Bayat that, in the interests of safety, he should send forward one of the cases of presents given to them by the shah to Rome. Continuing to Prague the two ambassadors presented the idea of a Christian alliance with Persia to Emperor Rudolph II on 7 November 1600. Although the emperor was initially enthusiastic, when Sherley refused to return to Persia immediately and suggested instead that he should proceed to England, his credibility was compromised. As his stay lengthened and it became clear that he was living beyond his means, rumours begin to circulate that he was a Spanish spy. The truth was more mundane, for, by the time he left the court in February 1601, Sherley had contracted debts worth in excess of 46,000 thalers.<br>
<br>In April 1601 the two ambassadors arrived at Rome but were now clearly at odds over the issue of precedence. They quarrelled violently over the matter of accommodation, with Sherley insisting on taking the better of the two apartments given them by the pope. Moreover, it was now clear to the Persian that the presents they had loaded for transport in Archangel had disappeared and he accused Sherley of stealing them; he alleged that Sherley had become so crushed by debt that now his only interest in proceeding with the embassy was to get money from foreign potentates. Indeed, relations between the ambassadors had deteriorated to such a point that they were granted separate audiences with the pope. The situation was further complicated because in their commission from the shah Sherley was not referred to as &#145;ambassador&#146;. Sherley argued that the translation was poor but the pope clearly favoured Hasain Ali Beg Bayat and Sherley was dismissed on 2 June 1601. At this news the Venetian ambassador in Rome remarked that Sherley &#145;has done many out of much money, and loud are the lamentations&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP Venice</span>, <i>1592&#150;1603</i>, 462). At this point Sherley seems to have given up any hope of completing his embassy, for he stayed in Rome secretly, twice offering his services to Cardinal d'Ossat and once making overtures to the French king. He left his brother Robert to his fate in Persia.<br>
<br>From late 1601 until the end of 1604 Sherley was resident in Venice, engaged as a spy for both the Spanish and the Scots, in which capacity he was watched continually by two English agents. In late March 1603 his activities began to concern the Venetian senate and he was arrested for &#145;insult to the Persian merchant's house&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP Venice</span>, <i>1603&#150;7</i>, 1). His position was further complicated because a ship owned by his brother Thomas had just plundered a Venetian galleon returning fully laden from Egypt. In May 1603 he was released from gaol on condition that he leave Venetian territory, but James I intervened, begging the senate to lift the decree. Free, Sherley began to spy again, but this time for the emperor, furnishing him with reports on Turkish strengths. To the Venetians this was intolerable, for it jeopardized their policy of avoiding antagonizing the Ottomans, a cornerstone of their diplomacy. On 1 December 1604 Sherley was summoned to appear before the council of ten and given four days to leave the demesne, never to return under pain of death  (<span class="italic">CSP Venice</span>, <i>1603&#150;7</i>, 194).<h2>
<a name="MissiontoMorocco"></a>Mission to Morocco</h2>On 2 June 1605 Sherley returned to Prague, where he was received by the emperor, who commissioned him to create a diversion against the Turks in north Africa. In October, Sherley landed in Safi, calling himself &#145;ambassador&#146; and living, by all accounts, in the manner of a prince, lavishly entertaining any Christian merchant who came to his door. The money advanced to him by the emperor was quickly exhausted and he resorted to living on credit. In February 1606, with a grand escort of 500 men, he travelled to Marrakesh and the court of Abu Faris. Though he was received with great state, when he came to an entertainment organized by the king he refused to dismount from his horse, instead riding through the hall in a manner befitting royalty. When summoned to the same chamber five days later he found a chain across the entrance. But rather than heed the king's wishes, Sherley was indignant and rode away; the chain, he explained, represented a dishonour to the person he represented.<br>
<br>Despite several meetings, Sherley was unable to persuade Abu Faris to strike against the Turks in Algiers and Tunis; in late June, he was dismissed. However, as was becoming something of a habit, he had incurred such debts that he was obliged to leave behind two of his company as hostages for a debt of 250,000 florins. He extricated himself from a further 60,000 florins of debt to some local Christian merchants by denouncing them to the king for defrauding the treasury of customs.<h2>
<a name="IntheserviceofSpain"></a>In the service of Spain</h2>When he was finally able to leave north Africa in autumn 1606 Sherley had with him two Portuguese prisoners he had ransomed, hoping to be well compensated for his expenses from their families; but when he reached Lisbon they refused to pay him. Temporarily without means, Sherley made for the Spanish court in Madrid in an attempt to persuade Philip III to finance a scheme to capture two Barbary ports. Instead he was given a formal commission to harass ships supplying the Turks in the Levant and the Low Countries and admitted to the order of San Iago. It was widely rumoured that he owed this new position to the influence of Anthony Creswell, a notorious English Jesuit implicated in the Gunpowder Plot. A brief visit to Prague in 1607 saw Sherley created count palatine by the emperor.<br>
<br>Over the period between 1607 and 1610 Sherley came to treat his commission as a licence for piracy. When he seized a Venetian ship, selling its cargo in Palermo, the Venetians complained vigorously to the Spanish and Sherley was relieved of his position. Completely discredited he made his way back to Madrid where he met and quarrelled with his brother Robert, the new ambassador from the Persian shah, although Robert probably helped him publish his self-aggrandizing <span class="italic">Relation of his Travels into Persia</span> in London in 1613. In this work, Sherley presents himself as endowed with a natural nobility; his difficulties, he suggests, are a consequence of the fact that such natural virtue is coming to be regarded as less important than a person's financial worth. While he was sympathetic to Persian customs and evaluated them according to their purpose and effect, he had nothing but bile for the Turks.<br>
<br>Now faced with the direst poverty Sherley was granted an allowance of 3000 ducats a year by the Spanish king out of pity; the greater part of this was spent in paying his creditors. His poverty was such that in December 1619 the English ambassador at Madrid reported that Sir Anthony was on the brink of starvation but was &#145;as full of vanity as ever he was, making himself believe that he shall one day be a great prince, when for the present he wants shoes to wear&#146;  (Penrose, 155).<br>
<br>Through the remainder of his life Sherley tried to ingratiate himself with the Jesuits, and sank to concocting plots against his enemies, all of which came to naught. In March 1618 rumours reached the English court that Sherley intended to flee his creditors and live out his days in the Canaries; but again nothing came of this scheme  (<span class="italic">CSP col.</span>, 3.188). Anthony Sherley died in obscurity, probably in 1636.<br>
<br>In 1607 John Day, William Rowley, and John Wilkins wrote a play entitled <span class="italic">The Travailes of the Three English Brothers</span>. With a striking affinity to the short tract written by Anthony Nixon, <span class="italic">The Three English Brothers</span>, published at almost the same time, their play presents a heavily sensationalized version of Sherley's dealings with the shah and the subsequent embassy to Europe. Sherley typifies the honour and nobility of Christendom against the machinations of the shah's counsellors at the Persian court and of the scheming Halibeck with whom he must discharge his mission to the princes of Europe. In 1888 Scott Surtees advanced the rather dubious argument that Sherley wrote all Shakespeare's plays.<br>
