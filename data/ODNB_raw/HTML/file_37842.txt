<span class="headword">Pelham,  Peregrine</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1602, <em>d.</em> 1650), <span class="occ">politician and regicide</span>, was baptized on 27 September 1602 at Bosham, Sussex, the eldest son of Peregrine Pelham of Wickham, Lincolnshire, and later of Hull, and his wife, Anne. His grandfather was the lord chief justice of Ireland, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21800/', "Sir William Pelham (d. 1587)")</script>, a descendant of the Pelhams of Laughton, Sussex. Pelham was apprenticed to the Hull merchant Thomas Aslaby and later admitted as a burgess of the town on 3 August 1626. He married his first wife, a sister of John Bowes, in or before 1628 when their son, John, was baptized in Hull. Presumably this wife died, as some time in or after 1630 Pelham married Jacoba Vanlore, the widow of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/66557/', "Sir Peter Vanlore (c.1547&#150;1627)")</script>, a wealthy merchant from Tilehurst, Berkshire. Pelham became prosperous in continental trade, importing French wines and exporting lead. He was elected chamberlain of Hull on 30 September 1630 and served as town sheriff in 1636. On Sir John Lister's death Pelham was elected MP for Hull on 18 January 1641, joining his first cousin <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/92986/', "Henry Pelham")</script> in the Commons. His commercial expertise was soon recognized and on 7 June 1641 he was named to the committee to regulate trade with Scotland.<br>
<br>Pelham was in Hull in April 1642 when the king appeared before the Beverley gate demanding entry. Pelham conferred with Hull's parliamentarian governor, Sir John Hotham, reputedly in the building now known as the White Hart inn, and refused the king admission, thereby preserving Hull's crucial arms magazine for parliament. On 18 May 1642 Pelham was appointed to a Commons committee sent north to assist Hotham on 24 May. Present in Hull during the siege of July 1642, he reported the town's successful defence in a letter to Speaker Lenthall on 13 July. However, Pelham soon clashed with Hotham over the town's government; by October Hotham was asking parliament to remove Pelham, whom he accused of spreading &#145;mutinous words&#146; that &#145;disturbed the peace of the town&#146;  (<span class="italic">Portland MSS</span>, 1.66). Claiming that Pelham's anger was rooted in Hotham's refusal to admit into Hull Pelham's brother-in-law, Hotham added that Pelham had accused him of planning to plunder the town. Eventually, Hotham sequestered Pelham's property and sent him on a ship to answer charges in parliament.<br>
<br>Pelham cleared himself of Hotham's charges promptly; on 27 March 1643 he was named a sequestrator for Hull, and on 3 August as a commissioner for levying money. He became more prominent in parliament because of Hull's massive strategic importance and on 24 December 1644 commented on parliament's trial of Sir John Hotham and his son for treachery: &#145;They both deserve death&#146;  (Wildridge, 48). In 1884 a large cache of Pelham's letters was discovered; now held by Hull Record Office, forty-three of them appear in <span class="italic">The Hull Letters</span> edited by T. T. Wildridge. Pelham's correspondence with Hull's corporation reveals him to have been a conscientious and industrious MP. In June 1645 he defended the corporation in parliament; fearing the town's self-government would be threatened, he unsuccessfully opposed its inclusion in the northern association. In August 1647 the Commons accepted his petition for payment of money due to him, and ordered the Sussex sequestration committee to pay him out of the earl of Arundel's estate. In September he was appointed a commissioner for compounding with delinquents. On 30 May 1648 parliament instructed Pelham to travel to Hull to protect the port from the navy's revolted ships, and to confer with General Fairfax over the town's safety.<br>
<br>On 6 January 1649 Pelham was named to the high court of justice that was to try Charles I. Attending twenty-one sessions during the king's trial, he was among the most committed <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/70599/', "Regicides")</script>. He finally became mayor of Hull in September 1649 with the special consent of parliament. He sat in the Rump and was alive in November 1650, but was dead by 27 December 1650. With more than &pound;17,000 owed to him and ruined by the civil war he died, intestate, unable to pay his doctor's bill. Administration of his estate was granted to his son, John. Parliament granted &pound;500 to pay for his funeral and his widow received the bounty of the Hull corporation.<br>
