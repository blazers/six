<span class="headword">Dieren,  Bernard H&eacute;l&egrave;ne Joseph  van</span>  (1887&#150;1936), <span class="occ">composer and writer</span>, was born on 27 December 1887 at 51a Coolsingel, Rotterdam, of Dutch/French ancestry, the last of five children of Bernard Joseph van Dieren (<i>d</i>. 1904), wine merchant, and his second wife, Julie Fran&ccedil;oise Adelle Labb&eacute; (<i>b</i>. 1852), a dressmaker. Although details of his education are shrouded in mystery, it would seem that his initial training was as a scientist, since his first post was that of a research assistant in a laboratory. Highly intelligent and with a phenomenal memory, he was also talented not only in the scientific and literary fields but also at drawing and at playing the violin, which he learned as a boy at school. He began to compose at the age of twenty, and some of his early works (a number of songs and a violin piece) were published locally. By this time he had made up his mind to study composition and music history seriously.<br>
<br>At the end of 1909 van Dieren moved to London together with Frida Kindler (1879&#150;1964), one of a talented musical family, whom he married on 1 January 1910. A son, Hans Jean Jules Maximilian Navarre Benvenuto Bernard van Dieren (1910&#150;1974), was born later that year. In Britain van Dieren carried on composing and, although largely self-taught, spent a year travelling about Europe in 1912, studying for a time in Germany and having contact with composers such as Ferruccio Busoni and Arnold Schoenberg. Strongly influenced by these early twentieth-century atonal composers, his music is highly complex, with counterpoint one of its most important components: the often unexpected resultant harmonic effect gives his work its very distinctive flavour.<br>
<br>Apart from six string quartets and a large corpus of songs, van Dieren's works do not fall easily into any specific categories. Rather, his output encompasses a wide variety of highly complex and often enigmatic compositions that make very considerable demands on the performers and listeners alike. His influence was restricted to a comparatively small band of loyal admirers, of whom Philip Heseltine (Peter Warlock) was the most vociferous, though composers of the stature of William Walton moved briefly into his orbit. Despite various attempts to resuscitate his music, he has not received any notable acclaim or widespread recognition. Finding it difficult to earn a living and to devote time to composing, van Dieren acted for some years as musical correspondent for a number of European newspapers and periodicals, including the <span class="italic">Nieuwe Rotterdamsche Courant</span>. For a brief part of the First World War he was involved in secret service in the Netherlands, employed as a cipher expert by the intelligence department.<br>
<br>Van Dieren spent most of his life troubled by ill health as a result of an operation in 1912 which left him a chronic sufferer from a kidney complaint; this plagued him for the rest of his life, and necessitated numerous operations in Britain, Germany, and the Netherlands. Because of often constant pain he had recourse to morphine, to which he is believed later to have become addicted. These frequent bouts of ill health forced him to spend a great deal of time as an invalid; his wife, Frida, a fine pianist and one-time pupil of Busoni, supported the family by teaching and performing. For much of his life the couple had often to rely on the support and goodwill of their friends. Van Dieren's charismatic, powerful personality and strong intellect drew around him a number of devoted and loyal admirers which included the Sitwell brothers (Osbert and Sacheverell), the sculptor Jacob Epstein (who used him as a model for one of his bronzes, <span class="italic">The Risen Christ</span>, now in the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art), the painter Augustus John, the composer Philip Heseltine, and the critic Cecil Gray. He was fortunate in having this duo of musical supporters, who not only assisted him materially, but also did their utmost to promote performances of his works and to secure for him the place they felt he deserved in English music. In February 1917 Heseltine (aided financially by Gray) organized a concert of his music in the Wigmore Hall in London. The occasion was, in almost every respect, a disaster. Heseltine's and Gray's overblown pre-concert publicity made wild claims about van Dieren's genius, and the critics, finding the music largely inaccessible, were extremely hostile in their reviews. In many ways this occasion did more harm than good, and for a long time a veil of suspicion hung over both the man and his music.<br>
<br>At the end of the war the van Dierens returned to the Netherlands, where they lived in The Hague until March 1921, when the need for further medical treatment necessitated a return to London. Limited and brief success followed: the six <span class="italic">Sketches</span> for piano were published by Universal Edition in 1921, some of van Dieren's works were performed in London, and, in July 1922, the Donaueschingen festival programmed his second string quartet. In 1925 the Oxford University Press published a dozen of his songs, and in the same year a number of his works were performed in a concert conducted by the young John Barbirolli. In 1925 van Dieren briefly went into the world of business, working for the Philips Electrical Company; a return of his illness, however, forced him to resign the post the following year. More works were published in 1927, and in the same year his fourth string quartet was performed at the Frankfurt festival. Although 1929 found him recuperating in Paris from yet another bout of illness, the following year he completed his opera <span class="italic">The Tailor</span> (begun in 1916 with the encouragement of Heseltine and Gray). In addition he wrote the first book on Epstein (1920) as well as a collection of wide-ranging and fascinating essays entitled <span class="italic">Down among the Dead Men</span> (1935). More of his music was heard when the BBC programmed performances of his works: <span class="italic">Diaphony</span> in 1934 and the <span class="italic">Chinese Symphony</span> in 1935. Van Dieren eventually succumbed to the illness that had dogged him for so long and died on 24 April 1936, at home at 68 Clifton Hill, St John's Wood, London. He was buried on the edge of the graveyard of St Laurence's Church, West Wycombe.<br>
