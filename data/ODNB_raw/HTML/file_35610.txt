<span class="headword">Price,  Thomas</span>  (1852&#150;1909), <span class="occ">politician in Australia</span>, born at Harwd, near Wrexham, Denbighshire, on 19 January 1852, was the eldest of the seven children of John Price, a stonemason, and his wife, Jane Morris. In 1853 the family moved to Liverpool, where he was educated at the St George's Church of England penny school, Everton, before being apprenticed at the age of nine to a stonecutter. His father's drinking led Price to temperance and Wesleyanism. After continuing his education at a mechanics institute, he became a teacher and lay preacher at the Boundary Street Sunday school and was active in politics. At St David's Welsh Church of England, Liverpool, on 14 April 1881 he married Anne Elizabeth, the daughter of Edward Lloyd, a timber merchant, of Liverpool. They had four sons and three daughters.<br>
<br>Stonecutting had damaged his lungs, so in 1883 Price and his wife emigrated to Australia and settled in Adelaide at a time when there was much difficulty in getting employment. He lived in suburban Unley, where he resided until his death, and was temporarily employed as clerk of works at the government locomotive shops at Islington. He worked as a stonecutter on many important Adelaide buildings, including the new parliament house, in which he later sat as premier. He was a member and later South Australian secretary and president of the Operative Masons' and Bricklayers' Society of Australia. From 1893 to 1902 he sat in the house of assembly of the colony for the United Labor Party as member for Sturt and from 1902 as member for Torrens. During this time he supported the radical Kingston ministry. In 1899 he became leader of the United Labor Party. In July 1905, after success at the polls, he formed a coalition with the Liberals and became premier, taking the portfolios of public works and education. He held the office of premier until his death.<br>
<br>Price was a kind man with a strong sense of humour and rugged eloquence. He was one of the few parliamentary speakers who are known to have changed votes and decided the fate of a measure by power of speech. During his premiership he was responsible for the completion of the outer harbour at Adelaide, and for acts creating wages boards, municipalizing the tramway system (which had previously been in the hands of seven companies), reducing the franchise for the upper house, transferring after his death the northern territory to the commonwealth, and tightening control on drinking, gambling, and prostitution. His administration was successful in its own right and paved the way for later Labor administrations. In continuing poor health, he died of phthisis and diabetes at the height of his popularity at Mount Lofty, Adelaide, where he was staying with friends, on 31 May 1909, and was buried on 2 June in Mitcham cemetery at Adelaide.<br>
<br>Price's widow went on to become a JP, perhaps the first in British territories, and was also a Labor Party vice-president. Their eldest son, John Lloyd Price (1882&#150;1941), was also a politician, a member of the Labor Party until 1931 and the United Australia Party thereafter.<br>
