<span class="headword">Rickett, Sir  Raymond Mildmay Wilson</span>  (1927&#150;1996), <span class="occ">educationist</span>, was born on 17 March 1927 in Fulham, London, the only son and younger of the two children of Mildmay Louis Rickett (1894&#150;1967), barrister's clerk and later civil servant, and his wife, Winifred Georgina Ann, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Hazell (1900&#150;1974). He spent his formative years at Whitstable in Kent and was educated at Faversham grammar school. He suffered from a severe hearing defect which affected his early education and dogged him throughout his life, but such was his character and determination that he effectively overcame it. He left Faversham grammar school in 1946 and then served in the Royal Navy, on minesweepers, for his two years' national service. An ex-servicemen's grant enabled him to study at Medway Technical College, Chatham, between 1948 and 1953; there he took a London external degree in chemistry, followed by two years' research. From 1955 to 1959 he studied in the USA at the Illinois Institute of Technology, where he was awarded a PhD in physical chemistry. While there he met and on 1 February 1958 married Naomi Nishida (<i>b</i>. 1930), a state-registered nurse of American-Japanese descent. They had two daughters, Kimiyo Megan (<i>b</i>. 1960) and Vanessa Reiko (<i>b</i>. 1963), and a son, Guy Masami (<i>b</i>. 1961).<br>
<br>Following his return to the United Kingdom, Rickett held a series of lecturing posts, at Plymouth College of Technology (1959), Liverpool College of Technology (1960&#150;62), West Ham College of Technology (1962&#150;64), and Wolverhampton College of Technology, where he was head of department (1965&#150;6). In 1967 he was appointed vice-principal of Sir John Cass College. Following its amalgamation with the City of London College to form the City of London Polytechnic (later to become London Guildhall University), he was appointed vice-provost of the new institution (1969&#150;72). In this post he enabled the City of London Polytechnic to become the first institution in the country approved to run a modular degree.<br>
<br>In 1972 Rickett was appointed director of Middlesex Polytechnic, a post he held until his retirement in 1991. What he found at Middlesex was a medley of six different further education institutions on twenty-three separate sites spread over 100 square miles across three London boroughs, which had just been designated a polytechnic. During his period of tenure he moulded it into one of Britain's leading polytechnics. His background (he was the first of his family to enter higher education) and his experience in the United States inspired him with three major objectives: first a belief that there should be opportunities for wider participation in higher education (through part-time courses); second, to adopt modular degrees based on credit accumulation (enabling students to cover a number of different subjects in one degree and to accumulate credits which could be transferred to other higher education institutions); and third to achieve international educational links. As director of Middlesex Polytechnic and also through the posts he held in the wider field of higher education, he had the opportunity to put these ideas forward. It was his belief that because of the existing system society wasted very valuable educational potential.<br>
<br>When Rickett retired in 1991 all three of his major objectives had been achieved. Under his leadership Middlesex took a leading role in introducing modular degrees, which were subsequently adopted by nearly all the other polytechnics. Many part-time courses were introduced, which enabled mature students to benefit from higher education. Middlesex also entered into agreements with a number of foreign higher education institutions, which enabled joint European degree courses to be established in conjunction with French, Spanish, and German institutions. In 1990 Rickett was awarded the Unilever prize for &#145;successful innovation and development in the setting up and improvement of undergraduate and post graduate programmes which require students to achieve operating competence in a European language, complimentary to a vocational education in the field of industry and commerce&#146;  (private information, Middlesex University press office). In December 1989 the <span class="italic">Times Higher Education Supplement</span> described him as an outspoken director who &#145;has observed&#151;and often influenced&#151;the Cinderella-like transformation of Polytechnics from poor cousins to &hellip; the higher education success story of the 1980s&#146;.<br>
<br>Rickett opposed the binary system of higher education which distinguished between universities and the polytechnics, and fought to get equal funding for equal levels of work. He was twice chairman of the committee of the directors of the polytechnics, from 1980 to 1982 and again from 1986 to 1988. While in the post he advocated allowing polytechnics to award their own degrees and be known as universities. He had the satisfaction of seeing this achieved the year after he retired. After retiring from Middlesex he became the last chairman of the Council for National Academic Awards (1991&#150;3), an organization which he had served for many years as a member of several committees, chairman of its policy committee and of its subcommittee on early entry qualifications, and a member of the advisory board for the accredited accumulation scheme. He was a member of the UNESCO advisory committee on higher education in Europe (1974&#150;83) and was chairman of the UK advisory committee of the European Community Action Scheme for the Mobility of University Students, which provided grants for students to study in other EC countries (1988&#150;91). He also had strong links with the British Council, being a member of the council board (1988&#150;91), chairman of its committee for international co-operation in higher education, and a member of its inter-university and polytechnic council for higher education overseas and of its Gulf States committee. He was a member of the Council for Industry and Higher Education (1985&#150;91), of the higher education review group for Northern Ireland (the Chilver committee) (1978&#150;82), of the working group on management of higher education in the maintained sector (the Oakes committee) 1977&#150;8), of the board of the National Advisory Body for Public Sector Higher Education (1982&#150;7), and of the Open University council (1983&#150;93). Among his outside interests were being a governor of the Hosting of Overseas Students Organisation and of the Yehudi Menuhin Live Music Now Scheme. He was chairman of the Mid Kent Healthcare Trust from 1992 until his death.<br>
<br>Rickett powerfully influenced the direction of higher education for twenty years. Kenneth Clarke, secretary of state for education from 1990 to 1992, described him as:<blockquote>one of the major advocates of the ending of the binary system, with its illogical separate status and funding systems for polytechnics and universities. He played quite a part in persuading me that this division was no longer relevant to a sensible system of higher education in this country.</blockquote>In 1988 the German government awarded him the officer's cross of the order of merit of the Federal Republic of Germany. He was knighted for his services to education in 1990, having been made CBE in 1984. He died at the London Hospital on 6 April 1996 following a heart attack, and his ashes were interred in the cemetery of All Saints' Church, Whitstable, Kent; he was survived by his wife and three children.<br>
