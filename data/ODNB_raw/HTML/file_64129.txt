<span class="headword">Howe, Sir  Robert George</span>  (1893&#150;1981), <span class="occ">diplomatist and colonial governor</span>, was born at 96 Carrington Street, Derby, on 19 September 1893, the son of Herbert Harry Howe, a railway fireman, and his wife, Minnie. He was educated at Derby School, and at St Catharine's College, Cambridge. During the First World War, as a second lieutenant in the Sherwood Foresters, he fought at Gallipoli, where he was wounded and left for dead. Taken prisoner by the Turks, he later escaped and eventually returned to Britain. On 9 July 1919 he married Loveday Mary Hext (<i>d</i>. 1970), daughter of George Hext, of Tredethy, Cornwall. They had one son, Peter (<i>b</i>. 1924).<br>
<br>In October 1919 Howe entered the diplomatic service and embarked on a career that was to take him to many parts of the world. His service began as a third secretary in Copenhagen in May 1920 before promotion to second secretary in December that year. In October 1922 he was appointed as second secretary in Belgrade, where he served as charg&eacute; d'affaires from July to September 1923. He next went to Rio de Janeiro early in 1924 and while there was promoted to first secretary, before embarking on a longer period in Bucharest from October 1926 to February 1930. He then returned to London for four years before being posted as counsellor in Peking (Beijing) in May 1934. While there he was appointed CMG in 1937. In March the following year he was transferred back to the Foreign Office. With the coming of the Second World War he was sent as minister to Riga, where he served from 1940 to 1942. In the latter year, following the restoration of Emperor Haile Selassie of Ethiopia, Howe was sent to Addis Ababa as minister from 1942 to 1945.<br>
<br>Howe returned to the Foreign Office in 1945 as assistant under-secretary of state with special responsibility for the Middle East. It was a time of great uncertainty, not least because Britain had just elected a Labour government with a forceful new foreign secretary, Ernest Bevin, who had progressive ideas about the region. Bevin wanted Britain to be seen less as an imperial power in the Middle East than as a friend who wished to work with the Arab world. The core of Britain's position in the region was Egypt, where Britain maintained a large military base on the Suez Canal, but successive Egyptian governments were eager to renegotiate the relationship between the two countries following the end of the war. The situation was complicated by the disagreement of the two countries over Sudan, which was legally the Anglo-Egyptian condominium, though actually under British control. King Farouk of Egypt, however, claimed that it belonged to the Egyptian crown, to which it had been restored by the Anglo-Egyptian reconquest of 1898, and he sought recognition of that in return for an agreement over the British base on the canal. After a number of negotiating failures, in October 1946 Bevin and Egypt's foreign secretary, Isma&#145;il Sidqi, agreed what became known as the Sidqi&#150;Bevin protocol, an ambiguous statement that appeared to recognize the Egyptian claim to Sudan, at least while the condominium lasted.<br>
<br>Officially Sudan was the responsibility of the Foreign Office, rather than the Colonial Office, but in practice it was administered by the self-recruiting Sudan political service. The service was strongly against Egypt's claim, as was the governor-general, General Sir Hubert Huddleston. Huddleston demanded to know what would happen if Sudan later chose independence; and he refused to return to his post in Sudan until he was satisfied with the answer, a move that effectively wrecked the protocol. In April 1947 he was recalled from Sudan, a move that was widely seen by the political service as a sacking. He was replaced by Howe, who was made KCMG in the same year.<br>
<br>There was much fear in the political service that Howe, having been an adviser to Bevin, was appointed as governor-general to ensure that Egypt's claim on Sudan was recognized in the country. In addition some of the more snobbish members of the political service lampooned Howe for his working-class origins. However, if it was the case that he was expected to push the acceptance of Egypt's claim, once in post Howe swiftly came to see the difficulty of any such endeavour. Within Sudan the political service was working actively for constitutional progress towards self-government, in co-operation with the anti-Egyptian Umma Party, which was under the patronage of Sayyid &#145;Abd al-Rahman al-Mahdi, the posthumous son of Muhammad Ahmad ibn &#145;Abdullahi al-Mahdi, the conqueror of General Gordon at Khartoum in 1885. Meanwhile the constitutional process was being boycotted by the other major party, the National Unionist Party, under the patronage of Sayyid Ali al-Mirghani, the leader of the Khatmiyyah sect and rival of al-Mahdi, which was in close alliance with Egypt. Howe soon realized that it was events within Sudan that would determine the way forward rather than negotiations between Egypt and Britain, and he gave his support to the strategy of rapid progress towards self-government that was being strongly led by the forceful civil secretary, Sir James Robertson. Howe's work in this regard was recognized with promotion to GBE in 1949.<br>
<br>Although progress was made in Sudan, it was the coup of the Free Officers in Egypt in July 1952 that dramatically changed the picture. The new republican government withdrew Egypt's claim to impose its crown on Sudan, and instead won the support of the Umma Party as well as the National Unionist Party for an agreement with Egypt that undercut the alliance of the Umma and the political service. Howe recognized the political defeat and accepted its outcome in the form of the Anglo-Egyptian agreement of 1953, which effectively ended the rule of the political service and handed self-government and the question of unity with Egypt directly to the Sudanese. It also established an international governor-general's commission to oversee Howe's position, and this too Howe handled diplomatically. In the election of December 1953 it was the National Unionist Party that won, and many expected union with Egypt to follow. However, Howe and his dwindling band of senior staff, who were being rapidly replaced under a Sudanization programme, swiftly realized that if they could win over the new prime minister, Isma&#145;il al-Azhari, and the National Unionist Party there might still be a chance of stopping a union with Egypt, which developments in the new regime there were making it appear would be against Britain's interests in the region. Howe worked quietly and effectively, helped by the ineptness of Egyptian diplomacy, and by 1954 it was becoming clear that the large majority of Sudanese no longer wished for a union with Egypt. However, by that time Howe was spending a good deal of time outside the country, especially as his wife was in poor health. He was eventually permitted to retire in March 1954. Sudan's independence was declared on 1 January 1956.<br>
<br>Following his retirement from Sudan, Howe lived quietly in Cornwall, his wife's home county, where he served as a JP from 1955 to 1968. He always kept in touch with old Sudanese friends and entertained many of them in his home in Cowbridge, near Lostwithiel. He died at the Duchy Hospital, Treliske, on 22 June 1981, of multiple myelomatosis, and was survived by his son. His funeral was held at St Bartholomew's Church, Lostwithiel, on 25 June.<br>
