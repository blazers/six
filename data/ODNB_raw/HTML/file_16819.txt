<span class="headword">Lloyd,  Charles</span>  (1735&#150;1773), <span class="occ">politician and pamphleteer</span>, was born in Westminster, the second son of Philip Lloyd (<i>d</i>. 1735) of Grosvenor Street, Westminster, and Catherine Cade (<i>d</i>. in or after 1773). His father, who eloped with his mother, an heiress with a fortune of &pound;5000, in 1724, had represented Saltash since 1723 on the duke of Wharton's interest. By 1727, however, Lloyd had changed his political allegiance and was a firm friend of Sir Robert Walpole, a friendship which secured for him in 1730 the position of equerry to George II. Educated at Westminster School as a king's scholar, Charles Lloyd later graduated from Christ Church, Oxford (BA, 1758; MA, 1761). Through his elder brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/39559/', "Philip Lloyd")</script>, who was tutor to George Grenville's sons, he entered the Grenville circle and gained early preferment.<br>
<br>Lloyd was given the sinecure as receiver-general and paymaster of the band of gentlemen pensioners in March 1762 and a clerkship in the Treasury. He became George Grenville's private secretary in April 1763, and was soon entrusted with the patronage of the new administration, thereby establishing himself as Grenville's man of business. Rewarded with a further sinecure as the receiver of Gibraltar, he also became a member of the corporation of the Treasury borough of Orford, Suffolk. There can be little doubt that if Grenville had remained in power he would have found Lloyd a safe seat in the Commons. Lloyd also proved to be adept as a polemic administration penman and he attacked William Pitt's attempt to replace Grenville in <span class="italic">The Anatomy of a Late Negotiation</span>, published in September 1763. He also defended Grenville's actions over the prosecution of John Wilkes and the question of general warrants in <span class="italic">A Defense of the Majority in the House of Commons on the Question Relating to General Warrants</span> (September 1764), in answer to Charles Townshend's pamphlet <span class="italic">A Defense of the Minority in the House of Commons</span>, published the previous month. Removed from his sinecures by Lord Rockingham following Grenville's surprising fall from office in July 1765, Lloyd became a successful and prolific political pamphleteer.<br>
<br>In opposition Lloyd gave full vent to the Grenvillite suspicion that Lord Bute had brought down the administration in his pamphlet <span class="italic">An Honest Man's Reasons for Declining to Take any Part in the New Administration</span> (July 1765), and when Grey Cooper defended Rockingham in September 1765 Lloyd answered with his <span class="italic">A Critical Review of the New Administration</span> (December 1765). After Rockingham's own short-lived ministry fell in the summer of 1766, Lloyd elaborated upon the view that Lord Bute remained the puppet-master behind the throne in <span class="italic">The History of the Late Minority Exhibiting the Conduct, Principles, and Views of that Party</span> (July 1766), a work which gave great offence to George III. When William Pitt succeeded Rockingham, and also accepted a peerage as the earl of Chatham, Lloyd reflected Grenville's own anger in the vicious <span class="italic">An examination of the principles and boasted disinterestedness of a late right honourable gentleman</span> (August 1766), a pamphlet which portrayed Chatham as both corrupt and dictatorial.<br>
<br>Eager to defend the measures of the Rockingham administration, Edmund Burke published a pamphlet in August 1766, which immediately provoked a response from Lloyd, <span class="italic">A True History of a Late Short Administration</span>, and prompted him to research, with Grenville's help, a much longer defence of Grenville's colonial policy. Published in December 1766, <span class="italic">The Conduct of the Late Administration Examined</span> remains one of the best works justifying the <span class="roman">Stamp Act</span>. Portraying Grenville as one of the few senior politicians who was above party, the work also damned Rockingham for repealing the <span class="roman">Stamp Act</span>, a political blunder, Lloyd argued, that would only increase American disobedience.<br>
<br>The opposition intention of creating a united front against the Chatham&#150;Grafton ministry was weakened in 1767 by Grenville's continued hostility towards Rockingham, and all hope of overthrowing the administration died when the followers of the duke of Bedford negotiated terms for their inclusion in the ministry in November 1767. Lloyd himself had tired of opposition and left Grenville's service that year to accept a government place as deputy teller of the exchequer. This did not prevent him, however, from publishing a passing shot at the Bedfordites in the <span class="italic">Political Register</span>, &#145;A word of parting to the grace the d(uke) of B(edford)&#146; (December 1767), a work which greatly offended the duke.<br>
<br>Whether Lloyd continued secretly to publish articles in the <span class="italic">Political Register</span> throughout 1768 remains unknown, but he did remain close to Grenville and until the latter's death in 1770 continued to correspond with him on many of the political issues which would appear in that journal. After a long illness, Lloyd died in St Martin's parish, Westminster, on 22 January 1773. Unmarried, he left his estate, which was administered by his brother Philip, to his mother, Catherine Lloyd.<br>
