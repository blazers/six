<span class="headword">Hogg,  Jabez</span>  (1817&#150;1899), <span class="occ">ophthalmic surgeon</span>, the youngest son of John Hogg and Martha, his wife, was born on 4 April 1817 at Chatham, where his father was employed in the royal dockyard. He was educated at Rochester grammar school, and in 1832 was apprenticed for five years to a medical practitioner. On 25 August 1841 he married Mary Ann, a daughter of Captain Robert Davis of the Indian navy. After her death he married Jessie Terraneau, youngest daughter of Captain James Read, of the Indian army on 16 June 1859; she survived him.<br>
<br>In 1843 Hogg published <span class="italic">A Manual of Photography</span>, which brought him to the notice of the proprietors of the <span class="italic">Illustrated London News</span>. He joined the staff of this periodical, and from 1850 to 1866 he acted as editor of a series of illustrated educational works published by Herbert Ingram. In 1846 he was sub-editor of the <span class="italic">Illuminated Magazine</span>, to which the illustrators Hablot Knight Browne and John Leech contributed, and he edited the <span class="italic">Illustrated London Almanack</span> from 1845 to 1895.<br>
<br>Hogg entered as a student in London at the Great Windmill Street school of medicine and at Charing Cross Hospital in 1845, though he was not admitted a member of the Royal College of Surgeons until 1850. From 1855 he was the personal assistant to George James Guthrie, founder of the Royal Westminster Ophthalmic Hospital, and he was appointed surgeon there from 1871 to 1877. He was also ophthalmic surgeon to the Hospital for Women and Children, Waterloo Bridge Road, London, and to the masonic charities.<br>
<br>Hogg devoted himself to the study of diseases of the eye, and he soon became proficient in the use of the ophthalmoscope, then newly introduced. He was a vice-president of the Medical Society of London in 1851&#150;2, and he was elected a fellow of the Linnean Society in 1866. He served as honorary secretary of the Royal Microscopical Society from 1867 to 1872, and retired in order to become president of the new Medical Microscopical Society, inaugurated in January 1873. He was a prominent freemason, in both the craft and arch degrees. Hogg died at his home, 102 Palace Gardens Terrace, Kensington, London, on 23 April 1899, and was buried in Kensal Green cemetery.<br>
<br>Hogg was an extremely prolific writer; besides works on ophthalmology he authored treatises on the microscope, the elements of physics, and pathology. His book in 1858 on the ophthalmoscope, the first in English, was, however, mediocre. The third edition of 1863 was devastatingly criticized as loaded with dedications to excessively illustrious personages, and &#145;so utterly and unutterably bad &hellip; from beginning to end such an incoherent mass of errors and mis-statements about every subject with which it deals&#146;  (<span class="italic">Ophthalmic Review</span>, 1, 1865, 96&#150;109). Hogg's own comments at this time admit to his uncertainty about the difference between direct and indirect ophthalmoscopy.<br>
