<span class="headword">Withers <span class="st"> [Wither]</span>,  George</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1540, <em>d.</em> 1605), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, was baptized at All Hallows, Bread Street, London, on 15 August 1540, the second son of Laurence Withers or Wither (<i>d</i>. 1573), salter and alderman of London, and his wife, Elizabeth (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Standish), kinswoman of the earl of Derby. His father hailed from an extensive London family which early embraced protestantism, four of its members going into exile after Mary's accession. Laurence's own abrupt departure from the court of aldermen in 1556 suggests involvement with London's secret protestant congregation, which George later described in terms that have the stamp of personal reminiscence. In 1559 Laurence was a member of the syndicate that loaned Elizabeth I &pound;30,000 to launch her reign. Perhaps for that reason he became MP for London in 1563.<br>
<br>George Withers matriculated from St John's College, Cambridge, in 1556. Having graduated early in 1559 he became fellow of Queens' College, from where he proceeded MA in 1562. On resigning his fellowship he was collated vicar of nearby Swaffham Bulbeck on 1 May 1563 and appointed university preacher the same year. In early 1565 he delivered a sermon calling for the destruction of the stained glass in the colleges' windows. Summoned to Lambeth to account for himself before the archbishop of Canterbury, according to Matthew Parker he arrived brimming with confidence, evidently regarding himself as the representative of a party rather than as an individual transgressor. On refusing the prescribed clerical habits he was suspended from preaching and threatened with deprivation. On 24 May 1565, however (as Wither, the signature he habitually adopted), he wrote a submissive letter from Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, where he apparently served as town preacher, explaining that his congregation had urged him not to desert them for such a trifle as the wearing of the square cap. Incorporated MA at Oxford in 1566 he resigned Swaffham shortly afterwards.<br>
<br>When on 26 March 1566 Parker suspended thirty-seven London clergy for refusing the surplice and square cap, his opponents quickly reminded him that he was not only the successor of Augustine but also chief pastor of a reformed church. They attempted to mobilize continental opinion on their behalf, sending Percival Wiburn to invoke the support of Theodore Beza in Geneva and Heinrich Bullinger and Rudolf Gualter in Z&uuml;rich. Wiburn met with mixed success and in mid-1567 Withers and John Bartlett crossed the channel to try again. Like Wiburn they elicited Beza's sympathy but antagonized Bullinger and Gualter, wearied by constant harangues from both sides in the vestiarian dispute. They then appealed to the elector palatine, Frederick III, asking him to intercede with Elizabeth. Frederick prudently ignored the invitation but had no objection to their continued presence in Heidelberg. Gualter later lamented that they were &#145;the chief authors of those changes&#146; which had &#145;inflicted such a blow&#146; upon the palatinate's ecclesiastical affairs  (Robinson, 1. 364).<br>
<br>Bartlett disappears from the record but Withers matriculated at Heidelberg University on 22 March 1568 with three compatriots, including Laurence Tomson, one of the <i>&eacute;minences grises</i> of early nonconformity. He conducted himself like a man in exile, settling down to the preparation of a doctoral thesis. Dissuaded from a full-scale attack on Parker's activities lest he offend the English government, he turned his attention to ecclesiastical discipline in general, denying the right even of godly magistrates to exercise it, and claiming that ministers and elders alone had the power to excommunicate.<br>
<br>This was the full presbyterian programme, as propounded by Thomas Cartwright in 1570, <i>avant la lettre</i>. Withers duly received his doctorate at a ceremony attended by the elector on 21 June 1568 and in July 1570 Frederick established a presbyterian system on Genevan lines. Yet there were to be repercussions. In his <span class="italic">Explicatio</span>, published posthumously in 1589, Thomas Erastus, Heidelberg's professor of medicine, comprehensively attacked Withers, arguing that since excommunication was not a divine ordinance moral offences were punishable by the magistrate. From that proposition were developed all later notions of Erastianism.<br>
<br>After returning to England, Withers succeeded William Cole as town preacher of Colchester, Essex. Made free of the borough on 14 February 1569, two weeks later at nearby Fordham he married Priscilla Shilbery, whose mother was Dutch. Their eldest child, Thomas, was baptized in Colchester on 30 July 1570. On 11 October Edwin Sandys, the new bishop of London, collated Withers archdeacon of Colchester. He probably continued as town preacher until instituted rector of Danbury, Essex, on 17 November 1572, on the presentation of Sir Walter Mildmay.<br>
<br>Twenty-one act books bear witness to Withers's twenty-five years as archdeacon. A radical put in charge of a radical jurisdiction, he put aside the presbyterianism of his Heidelberg heyday but contrived to combine the obligations of office with unwavering sympathy for the evangelical cause: Arthur Dent, for example, was for three years his curate at Danbury. He began his tenure as archdeacon in a flurry of activity, presiding over sessions of his archidiaconal court in Colchester, Kelvedon, and Saffron Walden. Having appointed a new official he thereafter limited his direct involvement in local affairs to his twice yearly visitations.<br>
<br>In 1579 Withers published <span class="italic">Certaine godly instructions, verie necessarie to be learned of the younger sorte before they be admitted to be partakers of the holie communion</span>. These consisted of eleven questions and answers, presumably stemming from his own pastoral experiences. They were published jointly with <span class="italic">An Invective Againste Vices</span> by Richard Rice, minister of Southwark in the 1550s, and a preface by Robert Crowley, another survivor of the protestant congregation of Marian London.<br>
<br>During the divisive 1580s Withers acted as a buffer between his clergy and his new bishop, John Aylmer. On 19 November 1582 he thanked Lord Burghley for his &#145;good friendship and favour&#146; following the indictment of certain Essex ministers at Chelmsford assizes  (<span class="italic">Salisbury MSS</span>, 2.532). When in early 1584 Aylmer introduced Archbishop Whitgift's three articles into London diocese as the official yardstick of conformity, Withers, overtly referring to his continental mission of 1567, reminded Burghley that although he had long been concerned to inculcate obedience to the queen's laws &#145;the urging of this subscription, I fear, will make our division greater&#146;  (BL, Lansdowne MS 40, fol. 44).<br>
<br>There can be no doubt that Withers tacitly condoned the clandestine activities of the conference of ministers known as the Dedham classis. Late in 1584 Edmund Chapman, its leader, devised a scheme signed by a dozen local clergy whereby Withers would exercise his functions as permanent moderator of a synod &#145;where we may use our freedom in conference and determining of ecclesiastical matters with [you] as fellow labourers and brethren&#146;  (R. G. Usher, 89).<br>
<br>In 1585 Withers published <span class="italic">An ABC for Laymen, otherwise called the Laymans Letters</span>, laying out alphabetically the spiritual lessons to be drawn from &#145;thinges sensible&#146;. Beginning with &#145;abundance&#146; he analysed the significance of several hundred common words and concepts, dedicating it jointly to Burghley and Mildmay, &#145;whom my estate hath compelled to trouble and use most, for your constant goodwill and continual favour shewed and benefits bestowed&#146;  (sig. 2<i>v</i>).<br>
<br>In October 1586 Withers and his official were suspended by Aylmer for exceeding their privileges in granting licences. The sequel is unknown but he was back in harness by Michaelmas 1587 and during winter 1587&#150;8 compiled <span class="italic">A view of the marginal notes of the popish testament, translated into English by the English fugitive papists at Rhemes in France</span>, publishing it with a remarkably deferential dedication to Archbishop John Whitgift, dated 12 April 1588. Contrasting his own &#145;mean place&#146; with God's decision &#145;so highly to advance&#146; the primate, Withers spoke of &#145;the love, wherewith you have embraced me these thirty years and upwards&#146;  (sig. A2). Whitgift had apparently been instrumental in having Withers's Heidelberg DD incorporated at Cambridge but there is no other evidence of friendship between the two men.<br>
<br>In late 1595 Withers resigned the archdeaconry in favour of his son, Thomas (1570&#150;1617), who was collated on 8 January 1596. He remained a respected preacher as rector of Danbury until his death there on 25 November 1605. He had made his will on 1 May, requesting a simple funeral, and was buried at Danbury. Having already disposed of his Danbury property (presumably to Thomas and his second son, Laurence, unmentioned in the will) his remaining assets went to his third son from his first marriage, George, appointed his sole executor. He provided for his second wife, Mary (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Scott), whom he had married about 1590, to the tune of &pound;200 and household goods. Of their children Mary, wife of Andrew Cooke, had already received her marriage portion. Abel received a bond of unspecified value. Micah should have benefited from a lease of another Danbury property but defective drafting &#145;casteth it upon George&#146;. Withers declared himself content with the arrangement since George had proved dutiful and Micah &#145;disobedient, unthrifty, stubborn and wilful&#146;  (Will, TNA: PRO, PROB 11/106, sig. 79).<br>
