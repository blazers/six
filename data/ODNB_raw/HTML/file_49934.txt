<span class="headword">Priestland,  Gerald Francis</span>  (1927&#150;1991), <span class="occ">radio and television broadcaster and writer</span>, was born on 26 February 1927 at Meadow Cottage, Berkhamsted, Hertfordshire, the son of Francis Edwin Priestland (1884&#150;<i>c</i>.1962), sales manager for Cooper, McDougall, and Robertson, agricultural chemists, of Berkhamsted, and his wife, Ellen Julianna (Nelly), <i>n&eacute;e</i> Renny (1900&#150;1964). He was educated at Charterhouse School, from where he won an open history scholarship to New College, Oxford. There he read politics, philosophy, and economics, graduated with a second-class degree in 1948, and met his future wife, (Helen) Sylvia Rhodes (<i>b</i>. 1924/5), daughter of Edward Hugh Rhodes and a student at the Ruskin School of Drawing. They married on 14 May 1949, and had two sons and two daughters.<br>
<br>In 1948 Priestland became one of the first six graduates recruited for training by the BBC news division. His career in the news division began with six months as an obituarist and then five years as a sub-editor. He then had a few months' experience working under Thomas Cadett in Paris before being posted in south-east Asia from 1954 to 1958. Then followed postings in the United States (1958&#150;61 and 1965&#150;9) and in the Middle East (1961&#150;5). During his second period in Washington, Priestland interviewed Martin Luther King shortly before the civil rights leader's assassination. From Washington he also covered the Vietnam War. Priestland and his wife, Sylvia, tried hard, and succeeded, in combining his postings with family life for their four children, but in the autumn of 1969 they decided that the children should finish their schooling at home. Priestland persuaded Desmond Taylor, who was then editing BBC television news, to let him provide for the main evening bulletin a short commentary on the lines of the text provided at that time by Eric Sevareid for the CBS evening news in the United States. In the autumn of 1969 Priestland experimented with this format. Charles Curran, the director-general of the BBC, complimented him on the result, but pressure from the television news managers was too strong, and the experiment was discontinued at the end of that year. At the beginning of 1970 he became the anchorman of <span class="italic">Newsdesk</span> on BBC Radio 4, part of the attempt made between 1970 and 1974 to revive that station's fortunes. He also presented radio series such as <span class="italic">Analysis</span>.<br>
<br>In the mid-1970s Priestland suffered a nervous breakdown, which he attributed to the violence he had seen while covering the Vietnam War as well as to the race riots he had witnessed during the civil rights campaigns in the American south. He recovered with the help of his wife, Sylvia, by now a psychiatrist, but also through discovering within himself a belief in the love of God and the reality of forgiveness. He had already developed an engagement with religion at school, where he was known as the school atheist and had thought it important &#145;to emphasize the meaninglessness and boredom of divine worship, which I did by refusing to bow my head during the Creed and by annotating any hymnbook with scornful comments during the sermon&#146;  (Priestland, 52). Having been a nominal Anglican for most of his life, he became a Quaker, partly because of his friendship with Gerard Hoffnung, in 1976. In 1977 he was appointed the BBC's religious affairs correspondent in succession to Douglas Brown. Here he was in his element in bringing religious ideas to a mass audience. <span class="italic">Priestland's Progress</span>, which he described as a plain man's guide to religious faith, was heard by millions and it attracted a postbag of 20,000 letters, an unprecedented response for a religious programme. At the end of 1981 listeners to Radio 4's early morning <span class="italic">Today</span> programme voted him ahead of the pope and second only to the prince of Wales as their man of the year. His Saturday morning talks, <span class="italic">Yours Faithfully</span>, on the same programme brought him more letters in a week, he said, than he used to receive in Washington in a year. After retiring from the BBC in 1982 Priestland continued to present television series on TV South&#151;<span class="italic">Priestland Right and Wrong</span>&#151;and a weekly spot on Terry Wogan's Radio 2 show, as well as continuing to write books mainly concerned with the exposition of a religious view of life. He died at the Royal Free Hospital, Camden, London, on 20 June 1991, after suffering a stroke while returning from a shopping trip. His wife, two daughters, and two sons survived him.<br>
