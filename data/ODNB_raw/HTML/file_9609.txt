<span class="headword">Fitzhugh,  Robert</span>  (<em>c.</em>1383&#150;1436), <span class="occ">bishop of London</span>, was the youngest surviving son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/50151/', "Henry Fitzhugh, third Baron Fitzhugh (1363?&#150;1425)")</script> of Ravensworth, Yorkshire, and of Elizabeth Grey (<i>d</i>. 1427), heir to the Marmion and St Quentin estates. Like many Lancastrian prelates he attended university. In 1399 he was recorded at Exeter College, Oxford, and was MA by 1405. Although he was renting rooms in University College in the years 1409&#150;10 and 1415&#150;16, by 1422 he was studying theology in Cambridge, and had graduated DTh by 1424. In the meantime he had been ordained subdeacon by Bishop John Fordham of Ely (<i>d</i>. 1425) on 19 February 1418, and deacon on 21 May following.<br>
<br>Fitzhugh's first known benefice was the rectory of Mottram, Cheshire, which he had obtained before October 1398. During the thirty-three years that followed before he became a bishop he acquired another five rectories, four prebends, the chancellorship of St Patrick's, Dublin, in 1404, and the archdeaconry of Northampton in 1419. His father's position in Henry V's government ensured that Fitzhugh was not lacking in preferments. In 1415 the king granted him the mastership of St Leonard's Hospital, York, a benefice reserved for royal clerks. As master he settled for the time being a notoriously bitter dispute between the hospital and local inhabitants over the payment of the ancient due of petercorn. On 10 September 1416 he was elected archbishop of Armagh, but his election was subsequently annulled by Pope Martin V (<i>r</i>. 1417&#150;31). By April 1423 he was chancellor of Cambridge University, an office he still held in November 1428. During this time he was named to various royal commissions of the peace for the town of Cambridge. From July 1424 until July 1431 he was also warden of King's Hall, a college founded for the education of clerks in the royal service. In 1428 he preached in convocation against Lollardy.<br>
<br>Like many other bishops, Fitzhugh owed his promotion to the episcopate to a successful career in royal service. His principal activity on the king's behalf was as a diplomat. On 20 June 1429 he was appointed Henry VI's proctor at the papal curia, and in the following July one of the ambassadors to treat for an alliance with the king of Aragon. During his stay at the curia he was entrusted with the delicate task of requesting Pope Martin V to appoint favourable mediators between England and France, and to permit Cardinal Henry Beaufort to be present on Henry VI's behalf during peace discussions. On 30 April 1431 he was provided to the see of London by Pope Eugenius IV (<i>r</i>. 1431&#150;47) and on 6 August received the spiritualities. He was ill at this time, and though he was consecrated bishop on 16 September 1431 at Foligno, Italy, he did not return to his diocese until a year later. He may, however, have briefly represented the crown at the Council of Basel, as he had been appointed to do.<br>
<br>According to the evidence from his surviving episcopal register, Fitzhugh personally supervised his diocesan administration, instituted clerks to their benefices, and held visitations of St Paul's Cathedral and various religious houses in his diocese. He remained active in diocesan affairs while attending to royal matters at Westminster&#151;he attended meetings of the great council, for instance, in April and May 1434. Indeed, he spent two-thirds of his episcopate outside the diocese as Henry VI's proctor and ambassador. Appointed leader of the second English delegation to the Council of Basel, he left London some time after 14 May 1434. During his stay at the council he actively defended the English position. Soon after his return to London in September 1435 he was elected to the wealthier see of Ely, following the death of Bishop Philip Morgan, but died before his own translation was put into effect. At a time when the affairs of the realm were dominated by the well-known quarrel between Humphrey, duke of Gloucester, and Cardinal Beaufort, Fitzhugh diligently carried out his diplomatic assignments regardless of faction. Like many other bishops, Fitzhugh belonged to a group of dedicated public servants whose paramount interest was the well-being of Henry VI and his government. He died at St Osyth, Essex, on 15 January 1436. In accordance with his last wishes he was buried in St Paul's in front of the cathedral's high altar, but his tomb did not survive the great fire of 1666.<br>
