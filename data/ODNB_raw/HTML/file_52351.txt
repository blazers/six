<span class="headword">&AElig;lfgar</span>, earl of Mercia  (<em>d.</em> 1062?), <span class="occ">magnate</span>, was the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/16470/', "Leofric, earl of Mercia")</script>, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/10873/', "Godgifu (Godiva)")</script>. He married, perhaps in the late 1020s, &AElig;lfgifu, probably a kinswoman of Cnut's first wife, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/180/', "&#198;lfgifu of Northampton")</script>. Her known lands lay in the east midlands and East Anglia, and in the 1040s &AElig;lfgar attested an East Anglian will at the head of the Essex witnesses  (<span class="italic">AS chart.</span>, S 1531). These connections perhaps explain why he was given the earldom of East Anglia, first during the exile of Harold Godwineson in 1051&#150;2, and again after Harold succeeded to Wessex in 1053. In 1055 he was outlawed for treason; the E text of the <span class="roman">Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</span> alleges his guilt but the other texts regard him as at most mildly culpable. Perhaps &AElig;lfgar was alarmed at the appointment of Tostig Godwineson, rather than Waltheof, Earl Siward's heir, as earl of Northumbria, and feared that he too might be displaced when his father died. He raised troops in Ireland, and, in alliance with the Welsh king, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/11695/', "Gruffudd ap Llywelyn")</script>, attacked Hereford. The local levies were overwhelmed and the city sacked, and Earl Harold had to collect a force from &#145;very nearly all England&#146;  (<span class="italic">ASC</span>, s.a. 1055, text C) to drive the invaders back into Wales. A peace was concluded on terms noticeably favourable to &AElig;lfgar, who was reinstated. In 1057 he succeeded to Mercia on his father's death; East Anglia passed to Harold's brother Gyrth. &AElig;lfgar's second exile, in 1058, must be seen against the continuing rise of the Godwinesons, for by now Harold had received not only Wessex but Hereford too, after the death of Earl Ralph in 1057. &AElig;lfgar again allied with Gruffudd, now husband of his daughter <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/307/', "Ealdgyth")</script> (their daughter Nest later married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/45588/', "Osbern fitz Richard")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/23505/', "Richard Scrob")</script>] and was reinstated once more. In 1062 he supported the election of Wulfstan (<i>c</i>.1008&#150;1095) as bishop of Worcester, but is not heard of thereafter. He was probably dead before Harold launched his successful campaign against Gruffudd in 1063, for he would surely have tried to help his son-in-law had he been living.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_52351"></a><span class="headword">Eadwine <span class="st"> [Edwin]</span></span>, earl of Mercia  (<em>d.</em> 1071), <span class="occ">magnate</span>, &AElig;lfgar's son, succeeded to his father's earldom. His widowed sister Ealdgyth married Earl Harold and in 1065 Harold supported the election of Eadwine's brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/19160/', "Morcar")</script> as earl of Northumbria, against his own brother Tostig. Eadwine and the Mercians in turn supported Harold's election as king the following year, though the Northumbrians had to be won over by the advocacy of Bishop Wulfstan. Tostig attempted to regain his earldom with the help of Harald Hardrada, king of Norway. They defeated a force led by Eadwine and Morcar at Gate Fulford, on 20 September, only to be killed five days later at Stamford Bridge. Losses among the northern levies probably account for the absence of Eadwine and Morcar from the battle of Hastings on 14 October. After Duke William's victory, they initially supported the election of Edgar &AElig;theling, but later submitted to William at Little Berkhamsted, and accompanied the king to Normandy in 1067. Both were confirmed in office, but the appointment of Roger de Montgomery as earl of Shrewsbury, probably in 1068, undermined Eadwine's position. He sought help from Bleddyn ap Cynfyn of Gwynedd, but a show of power by King William brought him to heel, and the brothers played no part in the English uprising of 1069&#150;70. The merciless crushing of the revolt must, however, have affected their followers, and Eadwine's authority was further reduced by the establishment of the earldom of Chester in 1069&#150;70. In 1071, Eadwine and Morcar &#145;fled away and travelled aimlessly in woods and moors&#146;  (<span class="italic">ASC</span>, s.a. 1071, texts D, E). Eadwine was betrayed by three of his men, and killed, with twenty faithful knights, &#145;all fighting desperately to the last&#146;  (Ordericus Vitalis, <span class="italic">Eccl. hist.</span>, 2.258&#150;9). Morcar joined other English dissidents at Ely and was captured when the isle fell; he spent the rest of his life as a prisoner in the custody of Roger de Beaumont. Neither Eadwine nor Morcar left descendants, but Godric of Corby, another Ely insurgent, may have been a son of their brother Burgheard, who died at Rheims in 1061.<br>
