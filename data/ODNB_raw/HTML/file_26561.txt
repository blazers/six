<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Stokes,  William</span>  (1804&#150;1878), <span class="occ">physician</span>, was born in Dublin in July 1804, the second son of Waterford-born <a name="cosubject_26560"></a><span class="headword">Whitley Stokes</span>  (1763&#150;1845), a talented <span class="occ">physician and surgeon</span>, and his wife, Mary Anne, formerly Picknell, from Loughgall in co. Armagh, whom he married in 1782. As members of the protestant ascendancy with origins in Gloucestershire the Stokes family had long enjoyed a privileged place in Dublin society and also at Trinity College, Dublin. A religious man, Whitley Stokes embraced the radical ideals of the Society of United Irishmen in the early 1790s, earning thereby the respect of Wolfe Tone and the deep mistrust of his anti-Jacobin colleagues at Trinity College, which he attended from 1779. Even though he left the society as soon as the leadership began to espouse insurrection the college authorities suspended him for three years on the grounds of disloyalty. Once reinstated he resumed his university duties and privileges. In 1805 he became a senior fellow and in 1830 he achieved the coveted regius professorship of physic (medicine). His conversion about 1815 to a quasi-Calvinist sect called the Church of God profoundly altered his son's life. Firmly opposed to any kind of Anglican education he tutored the boy at home in the natural sciences, while the charismatic leader of the sect, the Revd John Walker, taught him classics and mathematics. In his youth Stokes also gleaned some knowledge of the world from listening to the table talk of such luminaries as Charles Kendal Bushe, William Magee, John Philpot Curran, and Henry Grattan, who enjoyed the Stokeses' hospitality at 16 Harcourt Street and at their suburban retreat in Ballinteer, south of Dublin. Whitley Stokes died at Harcourt Street on 13 April 1845.<br>
<br>William Stokes's unorthodox education virtually ruled out matriculation at Trinity College. Determined to pursue his father's profession he studied chemistry and anatomy in Dublin before enrolling at the University of Glasgow. Two years later&#151;in the spring of 1823&#151;he transferred to Edinburgh University to study under the professor of medicine, William Pulteney Alison, who instilled in him compassion for the poor. In 1825 Stokes took his medical degree along with his good friend and rival, Dominic J. Corrigan.<br>
<br>Born with a silver scapel, Stokes rose rapidly in Dublin's medical hierarchy despite the lack of a Trinity degree. He had more than enough talent and self-confidence to question some of the outmoded assumptions of older colleagues, who still used the primitive methods and cures of their Georgian precursors. Having used in Edinburgh the simple type of stethoscope invented by Ren&eacute; La&euml;nnec of the Necker Hospital in Paris, Stokes promoted its use in a treatise published in 1825 for which he received a royalty of &pound;70. The first doctor in Ireland to adopt this method of auscultation, he paid the usual price for innovation in the form of scepticism and even ridicule from colleagues. Specializing in diseases of the heart and lungs, he embarked on a brilliant career as a healer, teacher, and researcher. A combination of sheer talent and pure nepotism enabled him to become physician to the Meath Hospital, succeeding his father in this post. At the Meath he teamed with the renowned Robert James Graves in treating patients of all social ranks and reforming clinical instruction. Together they made this hospital the flagship of Irish medical teaching and research.<br>
<br>A fluent and lucid lecturer as well as meticulous researcher, Stokes almost died from typhus during the epidemic of 1826&#150;7 after his resistance crumbled under the strain of overwork. This close call as well as exposure to near starving patients made him aware of the terrible calamity facing the country should the potato crop ever fail. In April 1828 he married Mary, daughter of John Black of Glasgow; he had met her while studying there. In 1845 he succeeded his father as regius professor of physic in the University of Dublin, having already served in this capacity for two years owing to Whitley's failing health. A liberal in social and religious matters, Stokes had welcomed Catholic emancipation in 1829. While he shared Thomas Davis's enthusiasm for Irish culture, he had no time for Daniel O'Connell's repeal movement, and yet he rightly predicted that the Liberator's death would usher in a more militant brand of nationalism.<br>
<br>During the great famine of 1845&#150;9 Stokes worked long and hard treating victims of famine related fevers. Filling his saddle-bags with cornmeal and bread he would ride into the hills and across the moors offering morsels of food to starving families along the way. He knew personally several landlords and poor-law doctors who died from the diseases they were trying to alleviate. In 1846 he urged a House of Commons committee to raise the pay of dispensary doctors given the hazardous nature of their work. By 1849 the cumulative burdens of patient care, medical research, lecturing, editing, and public health duties had exhausted him. Occasionally the sight of a tumulus, dolmen, or round tower in some remote district would stir his passion for antiquities and divert his attention from the terrible suffering of famine or fever stricken patients.<br>
<br>Along with most colleagues Stokes believed that fevers were so many divergent species of the same genus but he also noticed how members of the same family would develop different symptoms&#151;ranging from petechial eruptions (red or purplish spots) to intestinal inflammation. Regarding typhus and typhoid fever as virtually the same &#145;special morbid state or condition &hellip; subject to the law of periodicity&#146;, he insisted that no two epidemics were exactly alike and he warned his students (and readers) to be on the lookout for different signs of the same disease  (Stokes, <span class="italic">On Fever</span>, 74). As for a cure, he recommended wine or port, if not a hot brandy punch made with milk and sugar. Such stimulants were most effective among the peasantry in his view because they were not accustomed to wine and were on that account more readily enlivened thereby. On the other hand, upper-class victims of fever were more likely to die because their &#145;nervous systems&#146; were more highly developed. In addition they were so accustomed to wine that they were less susceptible to its curative powers. Refuting old stereotypes he regarded the peasantry as far more temperate than urban artisans. However, Stokes failed to address the question of how wine or spirits were going to be delivered to the hordes of sick and starving people.<br>
<br>Like Corrigan, Stokes specialized in coronary and pulmonary diseases as well as epidemic fevers. In 1837 he overcame bouts of depression and headaches to produce <span class="italic">A Treatise on the Diagnosis and Treatment of Diseases of the Chest</span>, which plugged some of the gaps in La&euml;nnec's classic work on this subject (1818). Stokes also explored the nature of pneumonia, bronchitis, and pleurisy, while advocating the stethoscope as the best way to detect problems in the lungs. Praised by both Corrigan and Henry Acland, this text elevated Stokes's reputation on both sides of the Irish Sea. Arguably his most respected work, <span class="italic">The Diseases of the Heart and the Aorta</span> (1854), dealt with pericarditis, tachycardia, and inflammation of the aortic valves as well as fatty degeneration, displacement, rupture, and derangement of the heart in the course of twelve long chapters. Translated into French, Italian, and German, this text confirmed his high standing in the profession and enhanced the reputation of Irish medicine abroad. A twentieth-century reviewer praised this work for its &#145;most comprehensive and complete&#146; assessment of pericarditis as well as its insights into heart murmurs and the mechanism of coronary disease  (Mulcahy, 54). In 1839 Trinity College conferred on Stokes an honorary doctorate of medicine. He also became a fellow of the King and Queen's College of Physicians in Ireland and joined the leading medical societies of Berlin, Ghent, Hamburg, Leipzig, Vienna, and Philadelphia.<br>
<br>Stokes is best known for identifying a pattern of periodic breathing in cases of severe illness, when in his own words, the patient's &#145;inspirations become each one less deep than the preceding until they are all but imperceptible&#146;, at which point &#145;apparent apnoea [no breathing] occurs&#146;. Then comes &#145;the faintest possible inspiration&#146; until the &#145;paroxysm of breathing is at its height, again to subside by a descending scale&#146;  (O'Brien, 150&#150;51). This syndrome had also caught the eye of his colleague at the Meath, John Cheyne, and was labelled the &#145;Cheyne&#150;Stokes respiration&#146;. A second eponymous discovery in the realm of cardiology was shared with Robert Adams, also at the Meath. Adams&#150;Stokes disease denoted a slowing of the heart beat or episodic cardiac arrest and syncopy that often ended in unconsciousness. An indefatigable promoter of both Dublin medicine and public health, Stokes treated a wide range of patients, loved to teach, and carried out significant research into diseases of the heart and lungs. Besides publishing numerous articles or lectures and four books on medical matters he edited for several years the prestigious <span class="italic">Journal of Medical and Chemical Science</span> (also known as the <span class="italic">Dublin Medical Journal</span>) and in 1838 he co-founded the Pathological Society of Dublin in order to promote the anatomical study of disease.<br>
<br>After mid-century more honours accrued. In 1861 Stokes was appointed physician-in-ordinary to Queen Victoria in Ireland as well as a fellow of the Royal Society. In the same year Edinburgh University gave him an honorary LLD and in 1865 he received a DCL from Oxford. Two years later he became president of the British Medical Association. In 1874 Stokes published his <span class="italic">Lectures on Fever</span>, Cambridge awarded him an honorary LLD, the Royal Irish Academy chose him as president (1874&#150;6), and Foley completed his statue for the King and Queen's College of Physicians in Ireland. Unveiled by the duke of Leinster on 16 March 1876 the statue stands today in the entrance hall of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland, as the King and Queen's College became.<br>
<br>A passionate advocate of better medical education Stokes promoted the use of modern instruments&#151;especially the microscope and stethoscope&#151;and a curriculum that would teach students about both the diversity and interdependency of the sciences. The doctors of the future, he believed, should be as philosophical and humanistic in outlook as they were scientific and professional in their practice. Besides materia medica his ideal curriculum included religion, law, the classics, botany, and natural history. If medicine was an inexact science it was also progressive and connected to &#145;every branch of knowledge in its progress&#146;  (Stokes, <span class="italic">Stokes</span>, 164). A stickler for the highest standards of medical ethics Stokes also preached compassion for the sick poor. Once while travelling in Donegal he observed several starving peasants. After prescribing some ineffectual pills, he gave each one half a crown and told them to buy some mutton chops&#151;to be consumed daily. In the realm of preventive medicine he wanted the state to play a more active role, especially where epidemic fevers and unsanitary conditions were concerned.<br>
<br>Stokes and his wife had nine children. One son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36315/', "Whitley Stokes (1830&#150;1909)")</script>, a scholarly Indian civil servant, published numerous essays on both the Anglo-Indian legal code and early Irish culture. Another, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26562/', "William Stokes (1839&#150;1900)")</script>, attained renown as a surgeon, became president of the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, and garnered a knighthood in 1886. Stokes's daughter, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26558/', "Margaret M'Nair Stokes (1832&#150;1900)")</script>, acquired expertise in early Irish art and archaeology after accompanying her father on expeditions to the west in search of ancient shrines or burial sites. Commitments to medical research and patient care did not stop Stokes from studying cathedrals in Europe and Celtic areas as well as neolithic ruins in the west of Ireland. Two of his boon companions on field trips to Connaught and the Aran Islands were Edwin, third earl of Dunraven and George Petrie, the topographical painter and archaeologist. Stokes paid an extended tribute to the latter in <span class="italic">The Life and Labours in Art and Archaeology of George Petrie</span> (1868). Later, Margaret edited two volumes dealing with their joint researches into early Irish culture, <span class="italic">Notes on Irish Architecture</span> (1875&#150;7) with a preface by the fourth earl of Dunraven. Besides the Corrigan family, near neighbours in Merrion Square were Sir William Wilde, the noted eye and ear doctor, whom Stokes had taught, and his exotic wife, Speranza, the parents of Oscar. Although a decade younger Wilde shared with Stokes a passion for Celtic antiquities and lively conversation. Stokes's non-medical friends included the painter Frederick Burton and the poets James Clarence Mangan and Samuel Ferguson. Stokes hosted salons for Dublin's illuminati at both 5 Merrion Square and Carrig Breac, his &#145;beloved retreat&#146; at the tip of Howth Head, where witty talk flowed as abundantly as wine and spirits. However, the premature deaths of a daughter and nephew along with the loss of his wife cast some dark shadows over his later years.<br>
<br>Stokes was a smooth spoken and urbane man with an aesthetic streak, who felt fully at ease in upper-class houses. Apparently these qualities did not impress Thomas Carlyle, whose visit to Dublin in 1849 included a meeting with this &#145;clever, energetic, but squinting, rather fierce, sinister-looking man&#146;. Carlyle's disapproval of Stokes was heartily reciprocated.<br>
<br>In November 1877 Stokes suffered a paralysing stroke and lingered for two months before dying in his town house on 7 January 1878. He was buried next to his wife in the cemetery of St Fintan's Church on the Hill of Howth. As someone who knew both Stokes and Corrigan observed, Stokes represented &#145;the poetry&#146; and Corrigan &#145;the prose&#146; of Irish medicine  (O'Brien, 63&#150;4). But there was much more to Stokes's career than poesy. In the words of <span class="italic">The Lancet's</span> obituarist Stokes's writings &#145;elevated vital facts far above all merely mechanical and chemical theories&#146; and the &#145;therapeutic fervour always kept pace with the diagnostic&#146;. In short, he never lost sight of the need to find a cure  (<span class="italic">The Lancet</span>, 108). Perhaps the <span class="italic">British Medical Journal</span> bestowed on Stokes the finest accolade when it pointed out that he neither coveted nor sought any title:<blockquote>He was a prince from birth of the aristocracy of intellect. His name is crowned with the triple coronet of the gratitude of the poor &hellip; the confidence of the public &hellip; and the love and esteem of his profession, whose honour and interests he unflinchingly upheld. (<span class="italic">BMJ</span>, 64)</blockquote>According to Eoin O'Brien, three giants&#151;Stokes, Corrigan, and Graves&#151;made up the triumvirate known as the Dublin school that raised the standard of medical practice and research in Ireland to new heights  (O'Brien, 107). A caring clinician, Stokes found room in his large heart for not only family and friends but also for his profession and his country.<br>
