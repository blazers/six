<span class="headword">Evans,  Arise <span class="st"> [Rhys, Rice]</span></span>  (<em>b. </em><em>c.</em>1607, <em>d.</em> in or after 1660), <span class="occ">prophet</span>, usually known by his adopted name of Arise Evans, was born a mile from Barmouth, in the parish of &#145;Llangluin&#146;, presumably Llangelynnin. Rhys or Rice Evans was the son of Evan Evans (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1614), who was a prosperous member of the gentry class, rich enough to subvent a local curacy by the gift or loan of a &#145;little Tenement of Land&#146;  (Evans, 2). Arise Evans claimed that he could trace his lineage back six generations, and beyond that to legendary times. He had at least two older siblings and one younger brother, perhaps a half-brother  (ibid., 1&#150;3, 35).<br>
<br>Evans's native tongue was Welsh. He was educated by a local clergyman, and learned to read English at a young age and with such facility that &#145;all concluded that God had designed me for some great work&#146;  (Evans, 2). However, his father died when he was seven, leaving a will which apportioned property to his named family but from which Arise's name was excluded, presumably because it had not been revised since his birth. His mother shortly remarried, and he moved with her to &#145;a place four miles off, called <i>Maisellan Kaderise</i>&#146;, probably the Maes-y-llan farmstead near Llanfihangel-y-Pennant, on the south-west flank of Cadair Idris  (ibid., 6). He worked in several other households until he was contracted to work for a tailor from Chester. At eleven he returned to his mother, now widowed a second time, in Maes-y-llan.<br>
<br>About the age of fourteen Evans began to experience visions. A third marriage took his mother to Wrexham, together with Arise. His contract with his first employer was fulfilled, and he was bound apprentice to another tailor, Hugh Jones, also of Chester, an autodidact, who recognized both intelligence and spirituality in Evans, and encouraged both. Jones was responsible for the nickname Arise: he told Evans to call himself by that name and reproved those who called him Rhys or Rice, maintaining, as Evans relates, &#145;they knew not the English of my name, giving me a charge not to answer any but such as did call me Arise. &hellip; This is the main cause why I write myself Arise, for there was a great providence of God in bringing me to understand my name&#146;  (Evans, 11&#150;12). On completing his apprenticeship, Arise worked as journeyman tailor in Coventry and then, from 1629, in London, where he lodged in Creed Lane by Blackfriars Gate, moving by 1633 to Salisbury Court. His lapsed spirituality was reanimated by a sermon he heard at Blackfriars Church, and an intense period of <span class="roman">Bible</span> study, confirmed by recollection of earlier visions, led him to understand that &#145;the King and the Kingdom was to be destroyed suddainly&#146;  (ibid., 17). His distracted and inspired condition lost him his journeyman employment, forcing him to seek out new masters, where, sitting at the shop-board, he &#145;beheld the Angel of the Lord all in white, stood upon the shop-board with a flaming sword in his hand ready to destroy me&#146;  (ibid., 20).<br>
<br>Confirming his fears by randomly consulting the <span class="roman">Bible</span>, Evans felt thus prompted to communicate his prophecy of doom to Charles I, whom he followed to Greenwich, and he gave him the news in a letter presented as a petition. His landlord subsequently declined to give him further lodging out of fear of reprisal. Realizing that his first communication had been ignored, and prompted by further visions, he returned to Greenwich, declaring his revelation publicly to bishops and other worthies around the court.<br>
<br>Evans was then prompted to seek out Robert Devereux, third earl of Essex, in his London house, and to prophesy to him that he would be general of an army that would &#145;execute judgement upon the Court&#146;  (Evans, 28). Essex rewarded him but &#145;turned it all into a jest&#146;  (ibid., 29). While to prophesy that Charles I would face difficulties may have been unremarkable, his identification in 1633 of the future role of Essex, documented with plausible circumstantial detail in his own account, must have seemed singularly uncanny by 1642, and he frequently cites this success in substantiation of his later prophecies.<br>
<br>Most of Evans's prophetic utterances related to English politics, and though he anticipated the civil war he was not himself a puritan. Indeed, when at Essex's presumably amused suggestion he repeated his prophecy to Robert Greville, Baron Brooke, he defended the Church of England to Brooke's puritan chaplain  (Evans, 30). Arise returned to Wales to advise his relatives of the impending crisis, though his sanity was questioned and with his family's consent he was kept in custody until his mental health improved. He married, probably in 1635, though promptly left his wife to return to London, lodging in Blackfriars, and frequenting the court and Somerset House to repeat his prophecies. He was arrested and brought before Sir Francis Windebank, to whom he retorted, &#145;you are the Kings Secretary, and I am Gods Secretary&#146;  (ibid., 46). He was sent close prisoner to the Gatehouse in Westminster, where he remained until 1637, when his wife successfully petitioned for his release. He returned with her to Wrexham and had children before returning to London, once more settling in Blackfriars and working as a journeyman tailor.<br>
<br>Prompted by a voice heard in a trance, Evans attacked Anabaptists and other sectaries, pursuing with reproofs the General Baptist Thomas Lambe the soap-boiler and defending the Church of England. Moving frequently in such radical circles in the mid-1640s and maintaining his own prophetic status, he was rumoured to have represented himself as Jesus Christ. Thomas Edwards, the great heresiographer, basing his account on this incorrect intelligence, included him in the second part of <span class="italic">Gangraena</span> as &#145;one Sectarie who maintained and affirmed he was Jesus Christ&#146;  (Edwards, 2.173). The Independents in Lambe's circle regarded him as &#145;a Decoy sent to catch them&#146;, and drove him from their company  (Evans, 59). He was arrested for the alleged blasphemy and brought before the recorder, Sir John Glynne, at the Old Bailey, and later before his deputy, who remanded him to Bridewell. He signed a confession:<blockquote>I know the Bench and people thought I recanted, but alas they were deceived, for I never beleeved nor understood my self any otherwise then thus. &hellip; [Christ] is my Saviour, and I am but his bought servant to do his will. (ibid., 65)</blockquote>At the following sessions, he was released.Evans detected a concerted presbyterian conspiracy to imprison him or have him secured in Bedlam, and in the late 1640s, while retaining his loyalty to the captive king, in reaction he sought out Cromwell and his circle, visiting him and Henry Ireton at Cromwell's house in Drury Lane, and urging him to release Charles I and restore him to power.<br>
<br>Evans published about twenty-five pamphlets. The overwhelming majority date from the period 1652&#150;5. Several are addressed to Cromwell, and the recurrent theme is that Charles II should be restored and that Cromwell is the destined agent to accomplish that task. The idiom is generally prophetic, and sometimes he bases his prophecies on interpretations of the visionary experiences of others, as in <span class="italic">The Bloudy Vision of John Farly</span> (1653) or <span class="italic">A Message from God by a Dumb Woman [Elinor Channel] to the Lord Protector</span> (1653). These tracts are either printed for the author to be sold at his house in Long Alley in Blackfriars, or bear the spoof imprint of &#145;Giles Convert&#146;, in allusion to the most active publisher of radical tracts, Giles Calvert. His autobiography and apologia, <span class="italic">An eccho to the voice from heaven, or, A narration of the life, and manner of the special calling, and visions of Arise Evans</span> (1652), is both a vivid evocation of the radical margins of London political and religious life in the 1640s and fascinating documentation, from an age of faith, of a mind obsessed with intrusive and delusional thoughts. As early as 1652, Evans referred to himself as &#145;being old, not able to labour&#146;  (Evans, 84), and it is unlikely that an unemployed journey-tailor could have financed such a publishing campaign without the assistance of presumably royalist funding.<br>
<br>Evans's last publication, <span class="italic">To the most High and Mighty Prince, Charles II</span>, dates from 1660. Early in the Restoration John Aubrey, citing Elias Ashmole as his source, relates that he was touched for the King's Evil:<blockquote>Arise Evans had a fungous nose, and said it was revealed to him that the king's hand would cure him, and at the first coming of King Charles II into St James's Park he kissed the king's hand, and rubbed his nose with it, which disturbed the king, but cured him. (Aubrey, 128)</blockquote>No later life record is known. Since so much of his prophetic output had related to anticipating the Restoration, the absence of further publication claiming credit and personal justification may suggest he died shortly after his meeting with the restored king.<br>
