<span class="headword">Clancy,  Michael</span>  (1703/4&#150;1776), <span class="occ">physician and playwright</span>, was born in co. Clare, Ireland, the son of Daniel Clancy, physician. He was sent to school in Paris, where he attended the Coll&egrave;ge de Navarre from about 1712 until 1716; he then ran away after an escapade in which he had played truant in order to glimpse the duke of Ormond, who was paying a visit to Mary of Modena, queen of James II, at St Germain.<br>
<br>Back in Ireland with no money and only a vague idea of where his family home was, Clancy was fortunate to be taken in by a certain Captain Tracy, son of the judge Robert Tracy. Tracy was under some sort of obligation to Clancy's father, who, it seems, had by this time died. At Tracy's expense Clancy was sent to Kilkenny College, where he was to remain for three years, during which time he made the acquaintance of the noted physician Richard Helsham. Tracy's sudden mental breakdown and the consequent cessation of his remittances threw Clancy back on his own resources. This time he was successful in making contact with his relations in co. Clare; despite their somewhat straitened circumstances they were able to send him to university.<br>
<br>Clancy was entered as a sizar at Trinity College, Dublin, on 6 June 1721, aged seventeen. He was singularly unimpressed by the academic life of the college, and in his <span class="italic">Memoirs</span> wrote some very tart words on the subject. Especially disillusioning to the rather na&iuml;ve young man was the realization that advancement depended not on merit but on favour. While at Trinity he cemented his friendship with Helsham, who was a senior fellow and &#145;the only Person to whom I owed any Obligations while I was at the University&#146;  (Clancy, 1.46).<br>
<br>Clancy left Trinity College in 1724 without taking a degree, having resolved to return to France to study medicine. He studied at Bordeaux for three years, and after leaving there about 1728 was resident for some time at Montpellier, where it is probable that he continued his studies. He graduated MD, but it is not clear from which university he gained his degree. He loved France and made many friends there, chief among whom was Montesquieu. A strong attachment developed between Clancy and the older man, and for six glorious months during 1725 Clancy was Montesquieu's f&ecirc;ted guest at his country estate at La Br&egrave;de, near Bordeaux.<br>
<br>By 1737 Clancy had returned to Dublin, where his career as a physician was brought to an abrupt end when he &#145;had the Misfortune of loosing his Sight by a cold&#146;  (Clancy, 2.54). Completely blind and unable to practise medicine, Clancy, with admirable resolve and an optimism born of ignorance, turned to literature for his livelihood. He worked up into a play a series of dramatic sketches he had composed for amusement during the summer of 1737; the play, <span class="italic">The Sharper</span> (1750), a comedy inspired by the life of the notorious Francis Charteris, was performed at the Smock Alley Theatre, Dublin, in January 1738, and was well received. Clancy made the acquaintance of Swift, who had praised <span class="italic">The Sharper</span>, and quickly became a well-known figure in Dublin society. A second play, <span class="italic">Tamar Prince of Nubia</span>, was performed at Smock Alley in 1740.<br>
<br>Blindness did not prevent Clancy from travelling, and in 1741 he was again in France. He was now at the height of his literary celebrity. In 1744 he visited London, where on 2 April Dryden and Lee's <span class="italic">Oedipus</span> was revived at Drury Lane Theatre with Clancy himself taking the part of Tiresias, in a performance given for his benefit.<br>
<br>Clancy was possessed of a very useful skill in making friends in high places. He was on good terms with Viscount Molesworth and with the viceroy, the earl of Chesterfield; and in 1745 he secured the grant of a life pension from the Irish public purse of &pound;40 per annum. After his next play, <span class="italic">Hermon Prince of Choraea</span> (1746), Clancy retired from writing for the stage. His <span class="italic">Memoirs</span> appeared in 1750 in two volumes, and in 1751 he produced <span class="italic">The Wanderings of the Heart and Mind</span>, a translation of the novel <span class="italic">Les &eacute;garements du c&#339;ur et de l'esprit</span> by C.-P. Jolyot de Cr&eacute;billon; he continued to publish occasional verse up to the end of his life.<br>
<br>Clancy was very well aware of the charge&#151;not entirely groundless&#151;that his success derived from his blindness rather than his talent as a writer. He certainly considered himself fortunate in his short career as a playwright, and he quit the world of the theatre with little regret.<br>
<br>On 1 September 1752 Clancy opened a grammar school in Dublin for the teaching of the Greek, Latin, and French languages, and he devoted the rest of his life to pedagogy. On 4 June 1758 he was appointed master of the diocesan school at Kilkenny, a post which he held until his death.<br>
<br>John O'Keeffe recalls meeting Clancy at Kilkenny about 1769: &#145;He was upwards of eighty, quite blind, yet seemed comfortable in circumstances, though living entirely alone. He was polite and communicative; yet melancholy; a large, well-looking man, with a great white wig&#146;  (J. O'Keeffe, <span class="italic">Recollections</span>, 1826, 1.vi.212).<br>
<br>Clancy died at Kilkenny on 7 April 1776.<br>
