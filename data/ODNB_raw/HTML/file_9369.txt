<span class="headword">Ferrier,  James Frederick</span>  (1808&#150;1864), <span class="occ">philosopher</span>, was born on 16 June 1808 at 15 Heriot Row, Edinburgh, the eldest son of John Ferrier, barrister and writer to the signet, and Margaret Wilson, sister of John Wilson (the essayist and poet Christopher North). James Ferrier was thus heir to a dual legacy&#151;to a tradition of successful advocacy and public commitment from his father's family and to a world of letters and culture from his mother's kinsmen. He therefore grew to maturity not merely in an atmosphere of wealth and learning, but also in the expectation of achievement and service. Intended to pursue his family's customary legal career, Ferrier was privately educated at the manse of the Revd Henry Duncan in Ruthwell, Dumfriesshire, and then, from 1817 to 1821, at the Royal High School, Edinburgh. After two additional years at the school of the Revd Charles Parr Burney at Greenwich, he enrolled at the University of Edinburgh for the sessions of 1825&#150;6 and 1826&#150;7. At the urging of John Wilson, he followed his uncle's example and enrolled, in 1828, as a gentleman commoner at Magdalen College, Oxford, where he received a BA degree in 1832. Contrary to the wishes of his father, and against the contours of his later career, he exhibited little intellectual discipline or academic distinction at Oxford, devoting his time to riding, hunting, and conversation.<br>
<br>In 1832 Ferrier returned to Edinburgh and qualified for the bar, although he seems never to have practised. Instead, he devoted his energies to courting his cousin Margaret Anne Wilson, enjoying the literary society of John Wilson's home at Elleray, toying with his own prospective literary career, and exulting in the company of Sir William Hamilton. Hamilton, then at the summit of his reputation, made a strong and enduring impression on Ferrier. Dissatisfied with the narrow provincialism and arid pieties of the then dominant common-sense school of Scottish philosophy and determined to reinvigorate that school in the light of contemporary German thought, Hamilton set himself the task of philosophical revisionism and cultural reform. To such an enterprise the young Ferrier was an enthusiastic recruit. At Hamilton's urging Ferrier visited Germany for some months in 1834, immersed himself in its language and literature, acquired an extensive library of German-language philosophy and literature, and returned&#151;miniature of Hegel literally in hand&#151;to join the vanguard of intellectual combatants against the intellectually orthodox in Edinburgh. Pausing only to marry Margaret Wilson on 3 October 1837, Ferrier rejoined Hamilton's circle and set to work on serious literary and philosophical writings.<br>
<br>The first evidence of Ferrier's labour was a lengthy article, &#145;An introduction to the philosophy of consciousness&#146;, which appeared in seven instalments in <span class="italic">Blackwood's Magazine</span> in 1838 and 1839; this was closely followed in 1840 by an essay on Coleridge's alleged plagiarisms from Schelling in <span class="italic">Biographia literaria</span>. These articles&#151;lucid, learned, and iconoclastic&#151;established Ferrier as a major new presence in Scottish intellectual life. Recognition of that standing was his election in 1842 to the chair of civil history at the University of Edinburgh and, in 1845, to that of moral philosophy and political economy at St Andrews. With that second election, Ferrier moved to St Andrews, where he quickly established himself as a popular teacher, an able committee man, and a valued conduit to a broader cultural and intellectual life beyond Fife. In the twenty years of his teaching at St Andrews, Ferrier gave courses of lectures on moral philosophy, Greek philosophy, political economy, and metaphysics. In such lectures, which he revised and published as articles in major reviews and encyclopaedias, Ferrier revealed himself to be an uncommonly subtle dialectician, an unusually outspoken innovator, and an unapologetic partisan in the intellectual controversies that convulsed Scotland in the wake of the Disruption of 1843.<br>
<br>Sharing Hamilton's conviction that Hume's corrosive scepticism was at once intellectually misguided and culturally dangerous, Ferrier grew dissatisfied with Hamilton's adoption of an intuitionist metaphysics well within the mainstream of traditional Scottish common-sense philosophy. To Ferrier's mind, Hamilton did not so much prove the principles of common-sense philosophy as rebut criticism of it, and he himself was sharply critical of the uncompromisingly psychological approach of his mentor. It was therefore to the more rigorous task of elucidating the foundations of common sense, of offering such a rationally conceived and presented &#145;reconciliation of philosophy and common sense&#146;, that Ferrier set himself. Insistent upon the non-empirical character of philosophy, Ferrier elaborated&#151;most fully in his chief work, <span class="italic">Institutes of Metaphysics</span> (1854)&#151;a resolutely a priori account of epistemology and metaphysics and one described by Ferrier himself as &#145;Scottish to the very core&#146;. In that task&#151;self-consciously aimed as a contribution to distinctly Scottish debates&#151;Ferrier's great innovation was not merely his own rigorous logical thoroughness but also his careful and approving use of the arguments of German idealism&#151;arguments he had read for himself. After Ferrier, with his ferocious attacks on Coleridge's bogus&#151;because secondhand and uncomprehending&#151;&#145;Germanness&#146;, it was no longer intellectually respectable among Scottish or English philosophers not to read Kant, Hegel, Fichte, and their contemporaries in their original form.<br>
<br>Such claims, explicitly indebted to contemporary German thought, won Ferrier not merely renown but notoriety. Appearing after the Disruption and amid challenges to theological and intellectual orthodoxy presented by biblical criticism, Ferrier's views, forcefully and uncompromisingly expressed, won him many critics. To those either unwilling or unable to distinguish between metaphysics and theology, and others determined to brand any expression of German thought as necessarily atheistic, Ferrier seemed not so much an innovator as an infidel. Evidence of this stigmatization was his failure, twice, to be elected to chairs at the University of Edinburgh&#151;in 1852 to that of moral philosophy and in 1856 to that of logic and metaphysics. Such failures stung Ferrier badly, and in <span class="italic">Scottish Philosophy, the Old and the New</span> (1856) he bitterly condemned the insularity and intolerance of his critics.<br>
<br>Failure at Edinburgh rooted Ferrier permanently at St Andrews, where he proved to be a determined reformer and gifted teacher. Never forsaking either his literary interests or his contact with the wider cultural world of Scotland, Ferrier, with his wife and five children, served as a centre of intellectual gravity in the ancient university community. He died on 11 June 1864 at his home, 12 York Place, West Park, St Andrews, and was buried on 16 June at St Cuthbert's kirkyard, Edinburgh. His wife survived him.<br>
