<span class="headword">Ley,  John</span>  (1549?&#150;1604), <span class="occ">explorer</span>, was the third of four sons who lived to adulthood of Henry Ley of Teffont Evias, Wiltshire (<i>d</i>. 1574), and his wife, Dionysia (<i>d</i>. 1589), the younger of the two daughters of Walter Seymour of Berwick St John, Wiltshire. He was educated at Winchester College, and attended Oxford University and Clement's Inn, but &#145;beinge nothing affected to Studie the lawe He betooke himself to marshiall Courses&#146;  (Wilts. &amp; Swindon HC, 366/1, fol. 8<i>v</i>). He accompanied Martin Frobisher on two of his three voyages in search of a north-west passage (1576&#150;8). He later served with the rebels in the Low Countries &#145;longe tyme&#146;, rising to the rank of captain. Ley also undertook several privateering voyages &#145;at his owne charge&#146;. He was captain of the <i>John Young</i> of Southampton in 1590. In 1592 he commanded the <i>Alcedo</i> in Frobisher's fleet, dispatched by the earl of Cumberland to seek East Indies carracks. Although Ley went to Ireland in August 1594 with the new lord deputy, Sir William Russell, his contacts in the seafaring community appear to have kept him abreast of Sir Walter Ralegh's efforts to discover El Dorado in Guiana and to have inspired him to venture in search of it also.<br>
<br>Ley was among the earliest Englishmen to explore the coast of Guiana and the first to enter the Amazon. He sailed from Dartmouth with one ship on Shrove Tuesday 1597. He sighted what he called the &#145;westerne Cape&#146; of the Amazon on 23 March before running up the coast to anchor in the Wiapoco (Oyapock). There he assembled a shallop and proceeded to explore the lower reaches of every river up to the Curratyne (Corantijn) for potential routes to El Dorado, making numerous contacts with Amerindian groups in the process. In the Curratyne Ley met up with Ralegh's <i>Watte</i>, commanded by Leonard Berry. The captains made for the Windward Islands and then parted company. Ley traded for tobacco with natives at St Lucia and took a Spanish frigate off Cumana. He returned to London with his prize on 24 August, his ship having arrived some time earlier.<br>
<br>In March 1598, when Cumberland's fleet set forth for Puerto Rico, Ley accompanied it as far as Lanzarote and then made off alone for Guiana in his prize frigate, now called the <i>Black Ley</i>. He reached the Amazon delta in June and spent about a month exploring 300 miles upriver, hoping to pick up news of an empire of Amazon women. He visited various native settlements, noting the longhouse dwellings built on piles above the flood. He found their inhabitants less welcoming than the natives he had contacted a year earlier. From the Amazon, Ley stopped in all the rivers he had visited previously, before making for the Caribbean and thence for England.<br>
<br>It is not known why Ley delayed his third voyage to Guiana until October 1601. He dispatched an account of his two earlier voyages and of his progress to date in the third to his brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/16619/', "James Ley, the future earl of Marlborough")</script>, in a letter from the Cape Verde Islands in December. John Ley's account, a response to his brother's plea for a record of his discoveries, also contained lists of the rivers between the Amazon and the Orinoco, and of the peoples who inhabited them. He included descriptions of their customs and local fauna, as well as tales of monstrous peoples such as those &#145;without heads, haveinge their Eies, nose and mouth in their breastes&#146;, or &#145;with two faces one behinde and thother before, fower Armes, fower legs &hellip; and they goe and come and shoote both waies&#146;. Ley probably touched in the Amazon in 1602. He certainly visited the Wiapoco, leaving a man there whom Charles Leigh met when he entered the river later in the year. Having &#145;Referred the settinge downe&#146; of his third voyage after his return, John Ley &#145;was prevented by death&#146;  (Wilts. &amp; Swindon HC, 366/1, fol. 15<i>v</i>). He died in London on 7 June 1604, and was buried in the chancel of St Andrew by the Wardrobe.<br>
