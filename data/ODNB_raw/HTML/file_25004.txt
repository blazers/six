<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Sedding,  John Dando</span>  (1838&#150;1891), <span class="occ">architect</span>, was born on 13 April 1838 at Eton, the second son of Richard and Peninnah Sedding. In 1858 he joined his elder brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25003/', "Edmund Sedding (1836&#150;1868)")</script> in the office of G. E. Street, where William Morris, Philip Webb, and Richard Norman Shaw were also pupils. All reacted against Street's hard-edged style in favour of later, more gentle idioms. After leaving Street's office in 1863 Sedding inclined towards decorative work, concentrating on the study and design of embroidery, wallpapers, and metalwork. From 1865 he worked with Edmund in Penzance, then moved to Bristol after Edmund's death in 1868 and to London in 1874; there he established himself at 18 Charlotte Street before transferring in 1880 to 447 Oxford Street, next door to Morris &amp; Co.<br>
<br>In 1872 Sedding married a kindred spirit, Rose Catherine Tinling (<i>d</i>. 1891), daughter of Edward Douglas Tinling, canon of Gloucester, and through her brother the Revd G. D. Tinling came his first major commission, for St Clement's Church, Bournemouth. After his move to London, and with his wife's support, the architectural side of his practice, hitherto limited to schemes for hypothetical houses, began to develop steadily. He had learned much about building texture by copying plates in Ruskin's books, and in 1876 he submitted sketches to Ruskin, who encouraged him, saying that &#145;if you would be a real architect, you must always have either pencil or chisel in hand&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Works of John Ruskin</span>, ed. E. T. Cook and A. Wedderburn, 1903&#150;12, 37.199). Believing architecture to be, not a commercial venture, but a divinely inspired art inseparable from handicraft, he formed a school of masons, carvers, and modellers from nature, and exerted a powerful influence over them by his friendly enthusiasm and close working knowledge of their craft.<br>
<br>Sedding's church restoration work, principally in and around London and in Somerset, Devon, and Cornwall, drew on his understanding of the organic nature of old churches acquired during his time in Cornwall. There too he had developed a response to the spirit of place, made clear in three new churches: Holy Redeemer, Clerkenwell (1887&#150;95), for the Italian quarter, is in the Renaissance style; at Holy Trinity, Chelsea (1888&#150;90), for an artistic locality, he attempted to create a synthesis of furnishings by leading artists; and for St Peter's, Earling (1889; built by Wilson in 1892&#150;3), for a prosperous suburb, he devised a broad open chamber lit by a large west window with flowing Perpendicular tracery. Nor did he shun modern materials: Clerkenwell has concrete columns enclosing steel girders. His Catholic churchmanship (he was sidesman and later churchwarden at St Alban the Martyr, Holborn, from 1878) ensured that his church plans are focused on a prominent altar. His other principal new churches were St Dyfrig's, Cardiff (1885&#150;93; dem. 1961), St Edward's, Netley (1886), St Elwyn's, Hayle, (1886&#150;90), All Saints', Falmouth (1887&#150;90); and St Augustine's, Highgate (1885&#150;8).<br>
<br>Sedding's church furnishings, especially silversmith's work, embroidery, and woodwork, were ornamented, not with conventional symbolic devices, but with details drawn from nature: animals and birds enliven lush foliage on screens, doors and reredoses in churches such as Meavy (1884), Holbeton (1887), and Ermington (1889) in Devon, all restored for the Mildmay family, for whom he designed a lodge at Flete, a rare secular commission. Other examples are found in four silver pastoral staves designed around 1890.<br>
<br>Although elected FRIBA in 1874 and appointed diocesan architect for Bath and Wells, Sedding showed little interest in architectural politics and held few formal appointments; but he joined the committee of the Art-Workers' Guild at its founding in 1884 and became its second master (1886&#150;7). His influence was exercised through training his pupils, including the jeweller John Paul Cooper, the cabinet-makers Ernest Barnsley and Ernest Gimson, and the ceramicist Alfred Powell, as well as the architect C. A. Nicholson. His chief assistant was Henry Wilson (1864&#150;1934), who after Sedding's death completed several of his works, adding towers at Bournemouth and Clerkenwell.<br>
<br>In 1888 Sedding moved to West Wickham, Kent, and developed his affection for the old English style of gardening, with formal plans and clipped yew hedges, which he championed in <span class="italic">Garden-Craft Old and New</span> (1891). After his death was published <span class="italic">Art and Handicraft</span> (1893), embodying views on architecture originally formulated in a paper read before the Edinburgh Art Congress in 1889.<br>
<br>Sedding was a simple, impulsive, warm-hearted man with a sense of fun, who inspired undying devotion in his friends and pupils. His published writings show the spontaneity and freshness of his thought, and are characterized by elegance and feeling. He died suddenly at Winsford vicarage, Somerset, where he was engaged on the restoration of the church, on 7 April 1891 and was buried in West Wickham churchyard with his wife, who died (probably of grief) a few days later. They had four sons, but his practice was inherited by Edmund Harold Sedding (1863&#150;1921), son of his brother Edmund, who practised in Plymouth, carrying out church building and restoration in Devon and Cornwall, and published <span class="italic">Norman Architecture in Cornwall: a Handbook to Old Cornish Ecclesiastical Architecture</span> (1909). The nephew's new churches of St Peter, Shaldon (1893&#150;1902), and St Mary, Newton Abbot (1904&#150;8), show how thoroughly he had absorbed his uncle's ecclesiastical style, just as his care for craftsmanship is mirrored in his repairing of the chancel screens at St Buryan and St Winnow and the exuberant naturalistic woodwork at Crantock, by Pinwill of Exeter.<br>
