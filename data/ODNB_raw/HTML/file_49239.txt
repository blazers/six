<div class="para">
<span class="headword">McGill,  James</span>  (1744&#150;1813), <span class="occ">fur trader and politician in Canada</span>, was born on 6 October 1744 in Stockwell Street, Glasgow, Lanarkshire, Scotland, the second child and eldest son of James McGill (<i>bap</i>. 1717, <i>d</i>. 1784) and his wife, Margaret Gibson. His father, grandfather, and great-grandfather James Craig were all ironsmiths and members of the Incorporation of Hammermen, the guild controlling the craft. The father prospered, and young James was not apprenticed to his father's trade but after attending Glasgow grammar school matriculated at Glasgow University in 1756. To stay until graduation would have indicated an intention to enter one of the learned professions, but he opted for something more adventurous and emigrated around 1760, probably for the tobacco plantations of the Carolinas. The first definite news of him in North America comes from 1766, when he served as factor, or agent, in the Canadian fur trade for William Grant, travelling from Montreal by canoe to Mackinac, the trading post at the junction of lakes Superior, Michigan, and Huron.<br>
<br>For the next nine years McGill engaged in the arduous life of an itinerant fur trader, often wintering in the frozen wilderness with native bands. He returned permanently to Montreal in 1775, just in time to experience the American occupation of the city, and was one of the signatories to the terms of surrender. But revolutionary fervour, even though expounded by Benjamin Franklin, failed to win Canadian support, and the Americans departed, leaving McGill determined never to suffer that indignity and financial loss again. On 2 December 1776 he married a French-Canadian widow, Marie-Charlotte Desrivi&egrave;res, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Guillimin (<i>d</i>. 1818), and that same year with the Irishman Isaac Todd established the fur and general merchandising company of Todd, McGill &amp; Co. He continued in trade, less actively in his senior years, until his death, by which time he was reputed to be the richest man in Canada.<br>
<br>McGill was named to the magistracy in 1776, and continued to serve conscientiously when he was elevated to justice of the peace in 1796. In 1792 he was elected to the first legislative assembly of Lower Canada as a member for Montreal West; he declined to stand in 1796 but was re-elected in 1800 and 1804. He was prominent in the assembly's business because he was fluently bilingual. In 1793 he became a member of the governor-general's executive council, and continued very actively until his death. The first <span class="roman">Canada Militia Act</span> was proclaimed in 1777; ten years later another fur trader, Alexander Henry, wrote in a letter from Montreal: &#145;At my return here I found all our friends Militia Mad; James McGill is a Major and Isaac Todd a Captain&#146;  (Alex Henry to William Edgar, 22 Oct 1787, letters and accounts of the North West Company, 1763&#150;1803, 81). McGill worked assiduously to prepare the local forces for any second American invasion. When the Anglo-American War began his rank was that of colonel commanding the Montreal garrison. As chairman of the Montreal committee of the executive council, he was also head of civil government in the city. In that capacity he quelled a local rebellion opposing mobilization. His military rank was raised to acting brigadier-general, and it was the forces he and his friends had readied that on 26 October 1813 defeated the American army attacking from the south.<br>
<br>McGill died at his home on rue Notre Dame, Montreal, on 19 December 1813, a month after receiving the order to demobilize his troops; he was buried at Montreal protestant cemetery on 21 December. His will assigned the bulk of his fortune to his wife and her sons, but he bequeathed his farm, Burnside, and &pound;10,000 for the founding of McGill College in Montreal &#145;for the purposes of education and the advancement of learning in this Province&#146;. The college received a royal charter naming it a university on 31 March 1821.<br>
