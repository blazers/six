<span class="headword">Kirke,  George</span>  (<em>c.</em>1600&#150;1675), <span class="occ">courtier</span>, was probably born in Scotland, the son of George Kirke (possibly MP in 1626 for Clitheroe, Lancashire) who was groom of the bedchamber and gentleman of the robes to both James I and Charles I and was succeeded in 1630 by his son who had been appointed groom of the bedchamber to Prince Charles in 1621. In 1632 complaints were made after Kirke claimed &pound;5000 expenditure on the king's robes but refused to present the bills.<br>
<br>Kirke's first wife was Anne (<i>bap</i>. 1607, <i>d</i>. 1641), the eldest daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15537/', "Sir Robert Killigrew")</script> and sister of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15541/', "William Killigrew")</script>, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15538/', "Thomas Killigrew")</script>, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15534/', "Henry Killigrew")</script>. As a wedding present, Charles gave them the manor of Sheriff Hutton, in Yorkshire, which Kirke sold in 1650. A son, Charles, was born in 1633, and it is likely that the George Kirke born 27 January 1635 at Sunbury (2 miles from Hampton Court) was also their child. An unnamed daughter was buried in Westminster Abbey in 1640. Anne, who was painted by Van Dyck, was appointed dresser to Queen Henrietta Maria in 1637. Anne was drowned under London Bridge on 8 July 1641 when her barge overturned. She was buried in Westminster Abbey.<br>
<br>Kirke took every opportunity to make money. From about 1629 he became involved in projects to drain marshes. Together with Sir Robert Killigrew and Sir John Heydon, he organized marshland drainage in Norfolk, Lincoln, Kent, Sussex, and Carmarthen. Kirke took particular responsibility for the Holland Fen project near Swineshead in Lincolnshire, which was first proposed in 1635. The draining of the fens provoked disturbances among the fenmen who were intent on defending their traditional economy. In 1636 there were riots at West Fen. The leaders were imprisoned at Lincoln, where Kirke believed they should remain as &#145;by which means the rest of the rioters will be found out these being the ringleaders of all the rest&#146;  (Lindley, 89). Further unrest occurred at Holland Fen in 1640 and in August the following year rioters expropriated large amounts of grain from Kirke's tenants. Kirke lost these lands during the Commonwealth but tried, unsuccessfully, to regain them in 1661.<br>
<br>Kirke was also a lessee of Gillingham Forest, Dorset, part of the crown's disafforestation scheme, a device used to raise revenue. At some point he obtained rights over clay used for manufacturing tobacco pipes and in 1631 was involved in a precursor of the Royal African Company. In 1634 he failed to obtain the post of sayer (of threads) in Ireland; however, the lord deputy, Wentworth, promised to advance Kirke's other Irish projects.<br>
<br>In 1642 Kirke, who four years earlier had described himself as &#145;his Majesty's ancientest servant&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1638</i>, 144), was additionally appointed keeper of Whitehall Palace at &pound;186 per annum. At Oxford on 26 February 1646 Kirke married Mary (<i>d</i>. 1701?), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27608/', "Aurelian Townshend")</script>. Mary was given away by Charles I. While imprisoned in Hampton Court Charles borrowed from her a painting of the queen. Edmund Ludlow refers to a Mrs Kirk's enjoying a splendid, and lavish, entertainment by Lord Francis Villiers the night before he was killed in the earl of Holland's abortive rising in 1648. The children of the second marriage were <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15664/', "Percy Kirke")</script>, Diana (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1648), Mary (<i>b</i>. 1649/50), and Philip.<br>
<br>Kirke House, &#145;next le Timberyard&#146; adjoining Spring Garden, was acquired in 1632 and is described in the <span class="italic">Survey of London</span>  (16.82&#150;6). During the Commonwealth Kirke stayed in obscurity. He was assessed in 1643 at &pound;500, being described in the <span class="italic">Calendar &hellip; of the Committee for Compounding</span> for October 1645 as &#145;Kirke, of Nonsuch, Surrey, and Charing Cross&#146; in a list of notables &#145;who are all Papists&#146;. Kirke lost the post of keeper of Whitehall Palace, his house and goods were sequestered and demised to Lord Sheffield and Mr Lisle at &pound;50 a year but the sequestration was discharged two years later. Kirke rebuilt the house on a grand scale between 1648 and 1652, living temporarily at 5 Chandos Street.<br>
<br>In 1664 Kirke regained the post of keeper of Whitehall Palace:<blockquote>Grant to George Kirke of the office of keeping the King's palace called York Place with the great garden and orchards, bowling alleys and coney yard near the Cockpit, with the jewels and robes in the palace; and a further grant of all the tenements etc. in Westminster belonging to his place, except three houses (called Paradise, Hell and Purgatory) near the Exchequer, in lieu of which he is to have an annuity of &pound;12.3.4. (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1664</i>, 498)</blockquote>In 1674 the post passed to the younger son Philip. Kirke's wife, Mary, who claimed a place as volary keeper in 1663 and who clearly enjoyed royal protection, was then granted several rooms in Whitehall, on condition that her husband surrendered some of his rooms. When Kirke's daughter Diana was born, Charles I promised her &pound;2000, which was given later, probably on her sixteenth birthday, in 1664. Diana married Aubrey de Vere, earl of Oxford, in 1673. Her sister Mary, who was reputedly simultaneously the mistress of the duke of York, the duke of Monmouth, and the earl of Mulgrave, married Sir Thomas Vernon in 1677. Kirke's family was severely lambasted in Charles Sackville's poem &#145;A Faithfull Catalogue of our most Eminent Ninnies&#146;  (<span class="italic">Poems on Affairs of State</span>, 4.191&#150;211), where Mary was &#145;Vernon, the glory of that lustful tribe&#146;.<br>
<br>George Kirke was buried on 26 May 1675 at St Margaret's, Westminster, unlike most of his family who were buried in the abbey. He died intestate but a limited administration, involving a sum of &pound;2000, was granted to Henry Killigrew in 1680. Philip Kirke's appointment as keeper (worth &pound;500 in 1685) was confirmed on his father's death, but Philip died two years later so the position went to his brother Piercy, and then to his son, also Piercy (<i>d</i>. 1741).<br>
