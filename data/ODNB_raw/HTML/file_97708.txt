<span class="headword">Auld,  William <span class="st"> [Bill, Viljo]</span></span>  (1924&#150;2006), <span class="occ">Esperanto poet and writer</span>, was born on 6 November 1924 at Hainault, Lesney Park Road, Erith, Kent, the son of George Auld, a draughtsman and structural engineer, who composed and recited comic verse, and his wife, Williamina Rose (Minnie), <i>n&eacute;e</i> Roy, shorthand typist. At the time of his birth his parents lived at 24 Bexley Road, Crayford, Kent. His father's ambition to become an actor had been thwarted at the age of fifteen, on the death of his own father (a soldier in a Scottish regiment). Auld's mother came from a more well-to-do family: her father owned a company that produced a particular type of cloth used in mines. Auld had a sister, almost eight years younger than him. Perhaps because of the age difference, they had little in common and were brought up almost as only children.<br>
<br>When Auld was nine the family left Kent and returned to its roots in Scotland. He won a scholarship to the prestigious Allan Glen's School in Glasgow, where he excelled at sport. He ran, and played football, rugby, and hockey. He was also an avid reader. From the age of ten he was a regular visitor to the public library in the Gorbals district of Glasgow, where he found books in such languages as Russian and Polish, reflecting the cosmopolitanism of the city. It was in another library, this time in Glasgow itself, that Auld discovered books in the international language Esperanto. In addition, as a twelve-year-old boy scout, he encountered the scout promise in Esperanto, and asked his troop-leader if he knew about the language. The scoutmaster obliged by giving Auld <span class="italic">Step by Step in Esperanto</span>, by Montagu C. Butler. From this book Auld acquired a sound theoretical knowledge of the language. However, it was not until he was sixteen that he persuaded his friend John Francis (subsequently a member of the so-called Scottish school of Esperanto writing) to learn Esperanto, and they began to use the language between themselves. At this time Auld's mother bought him a <span class="roman">Bible</span> in Esperanto, hoping&#151;unsuccessfully&#151;to convert her son from his atheism.<br>
<br>At the outbreak of the Second World War Auld's family moved to Helensburgh, where he completed his schooling. In 1942 he volunteered for the RAF and underwent pilot training in Rhodesia. Two years later he came top of fifty candidates for high-level reconnaissance work. In this capacity he piloted Spitfires in north Africa, the Near and Middle East, Italy, Greece, and Palestine. After the war he was briefly a test pilot.<br>
<br>In 1947 Auld enrolled at Glasgow University to study English language and literature, meanwhile continuing to hone his Esperanto. He would meet John Francis and the Esperanto poet and essayist Reto Rossetti, and the three would test each other's knowledge of obscure Esperanto vocabulary. Encouraged by Rossetti, Auld began to read widely in Esperanto, and to contribute to the periodical <span class="italic">Esperanto en Skotlando</span>.<br>
<br>Also in 1947 Auld became engaged to Margaret Barr (Meta) Stewart, two years younger and whom he had known since he was fifteen. She was the daughter of William Stewart, ship plater. At her request they decided not to marry until 1952, to allow her to complete her training as a nurse. They eventually married in Clydebank on 8 August 1952. To help support his wife and family (a daughter, Judith, was born in 1954, and a son, Roy, in 1956), Auld found work in a factory manufacturing bogies for railway vehicles. He finally graduated MA from Glasgow University in 1955 and obtained a teaching qualification in 1956. He taught in Johnstone and Paisley before moving in 1960 to be head of department at Lornshill Academy, Alloa, where two years later he was promoted to depute rector (deputy headteacher). He remained at the school until retirement. In 1963 the family moved to Dollar, Clackmannanshire, and set up home at 20 Harviestoun Road, where Auld lived for the rest of his life.<br>
<br>Much of Auld's most important writing dates from his time as a teacher or trainee teacher, including the epic poem <span class="italic">La infana raso</span> (&#145;The infant race&#146;), published in 1956 and described in a contemporary review as &#145;almost without parallel&#146; in Esperanto  (Waringhien, 116). The poem deals with the insignificance of the human race in the vastness of space and time. A collection of poems, <span class="italic">Unufingraj melodioj</span> (&#145;Melodies for one finger&#146;), followed in 1960. In 1952 appeared the first of many translations into Esperanto, Jack London's <span class="italic">The Whale Tooth</span>. Auld's translations later encompassed Byron, Burns, <span class="italic">The Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam</span>, and, by 1997, Tolkien's <span class="italic">The Lord of the Rings</span>.<br>
<br>In 1999 Auld became the first Esperanto writer to be recommended for the Nobel prize in literature, by PEN. He was again nominated in 2004 and 2006. He died on 11 September 2006 at Hillview Court Care Centre, Sauchie, near Dollar, after a stroke. He was survived by his wife, Meta, and their two children. He was buried according to family wish in the parish church in Dollar on 18 September.<br>
