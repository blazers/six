<span class="headword">Ada</span> <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Ada  de Warenne]</span>, countess of Northumberland  (<em>c.</em>1123&#150;1178), <span class="occ">consort of Prince Henry of Scotland</span>, was one of the family of three sons and two daughters of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28737/', "William (II) de Warenne, earl of Surrey (d. 1138)")</script>, and his wife, Isabel (Elizabeth) de Vermandois (<i>d</i>. 1147), widow of Robert de Beaumont, count of Meulan and earl of Leicester (<i>d</i>. 1118), daughter of Hugues le Grand, count of Vermandois, and granddaughter of Henri I of France. Her eldest brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28738/', "William (III) de Warenne")</script>, had succeeded as earl of Surrey by 1138 and her sister Gundreda married as her first husband <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/47233/', "Roger, earl of Warwick (d. 1153)")</script>. Ada's wider family included the eight children of her mother's first marriage, most notably the mighty Beaumont twins, her half-brothers <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1882/', "Robert, earl of Leicester")</script>, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1887/', "Waleran, count of Meulan and earl of Worcester")</script>. Her marriage to <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/12956/', "Prince Henry (c.1115&#150;1152)")</script>, the only surviving son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7208/', "David I, king of Scots")</script>, was celebrated in England soon after the second treaty of Durham of 9 April 1139, when King Stephen had sought peace with the Scots by confirming Henry's rights to the earldom of Huntingdon, and in addition granting him the earldom of Northumberland. Although Orderic Vitalis speaks of a love match, the marriage was almost certainly arranged at Stephen's command; and possibly one of the Durham treaty's terms (its text is lost) had specifically provided for it in order to bind Henry more effectively to Stephen's cause, in the support of which the Beaumont twins were then at the forefront.<br>
<br>While Ada's marriage failed to settle relations between the kingdoms, her contribution to Scottish history was profound. Her public role as first lady of the Scottish court (there was no queen of Scotland from 1131 to 1186) was originally limited by her numerous pregnancies; but her fecundity averted a catastrophe when Henry, the expected successor to the kingship, died prematurely in 1152. During her widowhood she enjoyed in full measure the respect and status to which she was entitled as mother of two successive Scots kings, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17860/', "Malcolm IV")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29452/', "William the Lion")</script>. After Malcolm's enthronement as a boy of twelve in 1153, she figured prominently in his counsels and was keenly aware of her responsibilities. According to the well-informed William of Newburgh, Malcolm's celibacy dismayed her, and she endeavoured, albeit fruitlessly, to sharpen his dynastic instincts by placing a beautiful maiden in his bed. She was less frequently at William the Lion's court from 1165, no doubt because of the periodic illnesses that obliged her to turn to St Cuthbert for a cure. Her chief dower estates were the burghs and shires of Haddington and Crail, and Haddington possibly became her main residence. She also had lands in Tynedale at Whitfield, near Hexham, and in the honour of Huntingdon at Harringworth and Kempston.<br>
<br>Ada's cosmopolitan tastes and connections reinforced the identification of Scottish &eacute;lite society with European values and norms. Reginald of Durham regarded her piety as exemplary, and she played a notable role in the expansion of the reformed continental religious orders in Scotland. If she had a preference, it was for female monasticism, and by 1159 she had founded a priory for Cistercian nuns at Haddington, apparently at the instigation of Abbot Waldef of Melrose (<i>d</i>. 1159). Her household attracted Anglo-Norman adventurers, and she personally settled in Scotland knights from Northumberland and from the great Warenne honours in England and Normandy. Ela, the wife of Duncan (II), earl of Fife (<i>d</i>. 1204), was probably one of Ada's Warenne nieces, and her great-nephew <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/23962/', "Roger (d. 1202)")</script> became chancellor of Scotland and bishop of St Andrews. Two of Ada's three sons became kings of Scots; <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/49365/', "David")</script>, the youngest, was the fifth Scottish earl of Huntingdon. She and Henry also had three daughters: Ada (<i>c</i>.1142&#150;1205), who married Florence (III), count of Holland; Margaret (<i>c</i>.1145&#150;1201), who married first <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/59576/', "Conan (IV), duke of Brittany (c.1135&#150;1171)")</script>, and second <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2774/', "Humphrey (III) de Bohun")</script> of Trowbridge (<i>d</i>. 1181); and Maud, or Matilda, who died in infancy in 1152. Ada outlived Henry by twenty-six years and died in 1178.<br>
