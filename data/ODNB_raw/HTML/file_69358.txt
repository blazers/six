<span class="headword">Bradshaw,  Henry</span>  (<em>c.</em>1500&#150;1553), <span class="occ">judge</span>, was the only surviving son of William Bradshaw of Wendover, Buckinghamshire, who died in 1537. He was admitted to the Inner Temple from Barnard's Inn in 1521. Although he was temporarily put out of commons for quarrelling in 1529, he was called to the bar about that time and became a bencher in 1536 when he gave his first reading. He served as double reader in 1542, notwithstanding that he had the king's letters to be excused (as a law officer), and was treasurer for three years from 1544. It was probably during the 1540s that he erected chambers in the inn, known for a while as Bradshaw's Rents; these were on the east side of what became Tanfield Court, near the present library staircase.<br>
<br>Bradshaw married Jane (<i>d</i>. 1598/9), daughter of John Hurst of Kingston and widow of William Mainwaring (<i>d</i>. 1529) of East Ham, Essex; they had four sons and four daughters. In 1540 he was appointed solicitor-general, and he was promoted to attorney-general in 1545. The latter appointment enabled him to act as a justice of assize, and he went on the midland circuit from 1545 until his death. Edward VI renewed his office of attorney-general, which he held until 21 May 1552 when he became chief baron of the exchequer in succession to Sir Roger Cholmeley. He did not take the coif, but his arms were displayed in the windows of Serjeants' Inn, Fleet Street, where barons of the exchequer seem sometimes to have been given privileges. After little more than a year in office, he died on 27 July 1553, and was buried at Halton in Buckinghamshire.<br>
<br>Besides his paternal estate at Wendover, Bradshaw also left estates and houses at Halton (where he kept a study) and at Noke in Oxfordshire, where his widow lived on until her death. By his will, made in 1546, he established a charity under which his executors were to hire eight craftsmen &#145;well instructyd in their misteris&#146; to live in Wendover, Halton, and Noke and &#145;take and instructe in their mysteres and handycraftes such poor folke and childreyn bothe men and women kynde as shalbe put to them&#146; by his widow or his heirs, or the vicar of Wendover; they were to be fed, clothed, and lodged out of the profits of their own labours  (TNA: PRO, PROB 11/36, fols. 122<i>v</i>&#150;124). This arrangement was to last for twenty years. There are three kneeling figures of Bradshaw on memorial brasses: in a long gown on his father's brass at Wendover and in judicial robes both on his own monument at Halton and on his wife's at Noke.<br>
