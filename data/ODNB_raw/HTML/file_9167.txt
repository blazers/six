<span class="headword">Farmer,  Hugh</span>  (1714/15&#150;1787), <span class="occ">dissenting minister and theological writer</span>, was born on 20 January in 1714 or 1715 at Isle Gate Farm, near Shrewsbury, the younger son of William Farmer and his wife Mary Owen. His mother was the daughter of Hugh Owen (1639&#150;1700), who was licensed as an Independent minister in 1672 at Bronclydwr, near Llanegryn, Merioneth, and had been imprisoned for his nonconformity. The Owen family were strong dissenters, and both Hugh Farmer and his elder brother, John, were destined for the dissenting ministry from an early age. They received their early education from relatives at Llanegryn and later at Warrington from Dr Charles Owen, who ran an academy in conjunction with his ministry at Cairo Street Chapel. Farmer became one of the first students of Philip Doddridge at Northampton and soon proved to be among the most able. He was much influenced by the eirenical views of his tutor. &#145;It was in men like &hellip; Hugh Farmer &hellip; that the Doddridge spirit in Nonconformity lingered for a quarter of a century after Doddridge himself had departed&#146;  (Colligan, 49).<br>
<br>Farmer commenced his ministry as assistant to David Some at Market Harborough in 1736, and early the following year he was recommended by Doddridge to William Coward of Walthamstow, Essex, to become his private chaplain. Coward, one of the leading dissenting laymen of his day, was then in his late eighties, idiosyncratic, and very rich. He was impressed by the young man, as were other members of the congregation that met at the chapel built by Coward in 1695 at Marsh Street, Walthamstow. Farmer refused an offer of a ministry at Taunton, and following Coward's death in 1738 continued his ministry in Walthamstow in a new chapel built in 1740. Farmer had increased the congregation in a short time, and it was clear that he was well on his way to becoming a notable preacher.<br>
<br>William Snell, a solicitor, and his wife, Cecilia, who were ardent dissenters, invited Farmer to live with them at Walthamstow in 1737, and he stayed for over thirty years until Mrs Snell's death. Freed of domestic care, he was able to give his whole attention to preaching and theological study. He later warned young ministers not to follow his example, as he did not like<blockquote>the care of a house establishment which he had to follow later and being left alone. &hellip; When visiting some of his acquaintance, with whom younger ministers boarded, he would sometimes say, in his jocular manner, &#145;Don't use him too well; treat him roughly, that he may not be tempted to follow my example.&#146; (Dodson, 10)</blockquote>In the succeeding decades Farmer became a celebrated preacher among the dissenters. He attracted large numbers to hear him at Walthamstow and the congregation expanded considerably, becoming one of the most wealthy dissenting churches in or near London. &#145;Mr Farmer's services proved highly acceptable, so that he had (with one exception) the largest afternoon audience amongst the Presbyterians; for such was the congregation denominated though Mr Farmer himself ranked with the Independents to the last&#146;  (Wilson, 2.60). This dichotomy makes it difficult to categorize Farmer in either denominational or theological terms. Unlike his brother John (a dissenting minister from 1730 to 1758, lastly at Needham Market) he was not a Calvinist, but<blockquote>had an admirable talent, without trimming, of pleasing persons of very different temperaments. &hellip; His voice was clear, strong, flexible, and harmonious. His address was handsome, insinuating and distinguished by its animation. &hellip; When he had raised his voice to a certain pitch, he would happily drop it, in a manner that gave great variety to his elocution, and which had a powerful effect &hellip; he was one of the best preachers that have appeared amongst the Protestant Dissenters. (Kippis, 5.681)</blockquote>In 1762 he accepted the post of afternoon preacher at Salters' Hall, as well as that of merchants' lecturer there on a Tuesday, where he attracted the largest afternoon congregation among the Presbyterian congregations in London.<br>
<br>Farmer was a radical in theological terms, but refused to join in theological dispute and rejected bigotry in any form. While he appealed to a wide spectrum of thought because he consciously avoided controversies which engendered strife, some of his regular listeners claimed that &#145;no one ever learned his own views&#146;  (Dodson, 32). He did not support the unitarian position, but some of his works were greatly admired by the rational dissenters. The Walthamstow chapel, which started as Independent, was the only one in the London area to eventually become Unitarian, although after Farmer had retired from its ministry.<br>
<br>Surprisingly few of Farmer's sermons were printed, but he more than made up for this deficiency with his pen. His best-known books were <span class="italic">An Inquiry into the Nature and Design of Christ's Temptation in the Wilderness</span> (1761), <span class="italic">A Dissertation on Miracles</span> (1771), and <span class="italic">An Essay on the Demoniacs</span> (1775). Farmer's views tended towards the rational rather than didactic, particularly on miracles and evil forces. His strong belief in divine sovereignty led him to conclude that invisible agents did not operate in this world. According to the Unitarian minister Thomas Rees, &#145;He was generally considered as having relinquished all belief in the Devil, and several jokes passed in consequence, in connexion with his name &hellip; he did not deny evil spirits however, but with no dominion over the natural world&#146;  (<span class="italic">Monthly Repository</span>, 561&#150;2). Farmer held that the demoniacs described in the <span class="roman">New Testament</span> were not possessed of the devil or evil spirits but were rather epileptics or deranged in mind; this view, though not novel, encountered strong opposition and was &#145;considered by some as contrary to the whole tenor of Christian scripture evidence, and subversive even of Christianity itself&#146;  (Wilson, 1.104).<br>
<br>Farmer believed strongly in natural law, but he also argued that the proof of the divine origin of a doctrine is that its statement was followed by a miracle. However, for Farmer the former overrode the latter, a view which eventually undermined the basis for his argument on miracles. The rational dissenters followed these arguments keenly, and in Alexander Gordon's view Farmer &#145;exercised a decisive influence on the current of opinion in liberal dissent&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>).<br>
<br>In the early 1770s Farmer decided to retire from some of his offices. Various legacies had made him financially independent. He resigned his Sunday post at Salters' Hall in 1772 (he had wanted to resign in 1768 but he was exhorted not to do so) due to &#145;his growing infirmities and frequent returns of disorder, which deprived him of the hopes of preaching twice a day with any constancy&#146;  (Wilson, 2.60). In 1780 he retired from the merchants' lectureship and shortly afterwards from his long ministry at Walthamstow. One of the main reasons for his resignation was the deterioration in his eyesight through cataracts, and by the early 1780s he was virtually blind. In 1785 the cataracts were removed, his sight was restored, and he was able to return to his studies.<br>
<br>No portrait of Farmer is known, but he was described as being tall, spare, of a dark complexion, with small eyes, and prominent nose and chin, &#145;which gave him a nutcracker face when he lost his teeth&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>). He never married. He was a lively conversationalist and easily became animated and excited, but was always polite and understanding. Although he did not like keeping house for himself, he maintained an open and liberal table for his many friends at his home in Walthamstow, being generous with both his time and money. In retirement he spent long periods each year at Bath, remaining active on dissenting trusts and preparing papers for publication.<br>
<br>Farmer was highly regarded by his contemporaries as an outstanding preacher and a cogent theological writer whose clarity and learning reflected the best of the Doddridge tradition. Richard Price writing to Benjamin Franklin in America on 30 September 1772 expressed the general view: &#145;He is one of the most admired preachers we have&#146;  (<span class="italic">Correspondence of Richard Price</span>, 1.142). Farmer died of &#145;gout of the stomach&#146; (probably cancer) on 5 February 1787 at Walthamstow, and was buried on or about 10 February in the parish churchyard in the Snell tomb. His will made several legacies, but required his executors to burn his papers or they would be rescinded; all his papers were therefore burnt. Farmer describes himself in his will as &#145;gentleman&#146;, and apart from bequests to denominational charities there is no other reference to his connection with dissent and its ministry.<br>
