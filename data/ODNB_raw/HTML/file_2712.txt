<span class="headword">Blundell,  Henry</span>  (1724&#150;1810), <span class="occ">art collector</span>, was born at Ince Blundell, Lancashire, the son of Robert Blundell (<i>d</i>. 1773) and his wife, Katharine, daughter of Sir Stanley Rowland, bt, of Hooton, Chester. Like many Catholics he received his education abroad, first at the college of the English Jesuits at St Omer, and then at the English College at Douai, where he remained until 1745. He then travelled to Paris where he was placed under the care of Dr Joseph Holden, president of the St Gregory's English seminary. He returned to England by 1750, and in 1760 married Elizabeth (1733/4&#150;1767), daughter of Sir George Mostyn, bt, of Talacre, Flintshire, with whom he had a son, Charles Robert, and two daughters, Katherine and Elizabeth. The year following Henry's marriage his father settled the family estates on him, and retired to Liverpool with his second wife, Margaret Anderton, whom he had married in 1752. It was a marriage that was to prove providential to Henry. The family's modest income was dramatically increased with the death in 1760 of Sir Francis Anderton without male heir. His estates of Lostock and Lydigate then passed to the Blundell family. Henry's wealth increased further with the deaths in 1767 and 1773, respectively, of his wife and father, his wife's income and that from his mother's estates devolving to him. With this substantial change in his financial fortunes, and the loss of much of his immediate family, Blundell devoted himself to improving the house and estate at Ince.<br>
<br>Blundell's collection began modestly in the 1760s, with the limited patronage of leading artists of his generation. He commissioned a portrait of his wife from Joshua Reynolds, and, on Edward Penny's advice, employed Richard Wilson to paint four pieces (<i>c</i>.1763&#150;7) for the dining room at Ince Blundell Hall. Blundell paid 70 guineas for the paintings, although Wilson asked only 50, for what were mainly studio works. This was not the only example of Blundell's generosity: he also paid Antonio Canova 100 zecchini more than the agreed price for a sculpture, <span class="italic">Psyche</span>, commissioned in 1790. In the 1770s Blundell began to buy old masters, eventually amassing a collection of over 300 works which included paintings by and after Poussin, Ruisdael, Breughel, Jacopo Bassano, Veronese, and Andrea del Sarto. He purchased some of these paintings on visits to Paris, including a copy of Veronese's <span class="italic">Marriage at Cana</span>. However, many works were bought in Italy, where he also patronized the painters Gavin Hamilton and Anton Raphael Mengs, and acquired most of the classical antiquities for which his collection was, and is, renowned.<br>
<br>Blundell was probably encouraged to start collecting at the age of fifty-three not only by his new-found wealth, but also by his Catholic friend and neighbour Charles Townley, who had already formed a significant collection. In 1776 Blundell set out for Italy with the intention of joining Townley there. Travelling via Milan, Venice, and Ancona, he arrived in Rome in February 1777 before making a brief tour to Naples with his neighbour. Townley, who was well connected with those involved in the excavation and sale of antiquities in Rome, introduced Blundell to the dealer Thomas Jenkins. It was through Jenkins that Blundell made his first purchases of antiquities: a seated philosopher and eighty pieces from the Villa Mattei. This latter purchase included not only busts and statues but also urns and inscriptions, and represented what remained of a large collection from which &#145;the very best pieces had already been extracted&#146;, those items still in Jenkins's hands being &#145;heavily, and often, very imaginatively, restored&#146;  (Vaughan, 14).<br>
<br>Initially Blundell was not a highly discriminating collector, and his wholesale acquisition of antiquities continued with a group from Villa Borrioni (probably also in 1777); again the best pieces had already been dispersed. He was happy to buy works he knew to have been imaginatively restored, purchasing a number of pieces from the restorers and dealers Bartolomeo Cavaceppi and Giovanni Volpato. He was also content for his collection to include modern copies, to which end he bought from Giuseppi Angelini and Carlo Albacini. Blundell may simply have been &#145;interested in the sculptures for the classical ideas that they represented &hellip; and not unduly worried initially whether a piece was ancient or not&#146;  (Southworth). This opinion is further encouraged by Blundell's treatment of the statue <span class="italic">Sleeping Hermaphrodite</span>, which he purchased in 1801 from Lord Bessborough's sale. He had the subject's male genitalia and the genii that surrounded the figure removed, in order to recast the subject as a sleeping Venus.<br>
<br>Blundell made three further visits to Italy; he was in Rome in 1782&#150;3, 1786, and 1790, when he also revisited Naples. He had grown to distrust Jenkins, and on the last two visits relied principally on Father John Thorpe (whom he had probably first met at St Omer) to assist him as his agent. However, it was through Jenkins that he purchased, in 1786, the statue of Minerva from Palazzo Lante. This was an important acquisition and, as an antique of the finest quality, marked a new phase in the sort of works Blundell sought to acquire. For example, he purchased twelve pieces from Villa d'Este including a <span class="italic">Theseus</span> that Townley regarded as the &#145;best specimen in Blundell's collection&#146;  (Vaughan, 16). In addition he bought significantly more marbles&#151;Townley observed 39 pieces in 1786 and 325 in 1793  (ibid.). However, the Napoleonic wars halted the expansion of his collection, for a time anyway.<br>
<br>In England, Blundell paused in his collecting mania and built a garden temple to house his collection. However, in the early 1800s, perhaps having come into further money, he began to collect again. Advised by Townley, he bought at the sales of the collections of Lord Cawdor (1800) and Lord Bessborough (1801). The extent of Blundell's increased wealth may be exemplified by his purchase of a sarcophagus relief, <span class="italic">Phaeton before Helios</span>, at Christies. The work had been recovered in May 1800 from a French cargo ship <i>en route</i> for Paris from Italy, where it had previously been in the papal collection. Blundell had earlier bought this work soon after it was uncovered at Villa d'Este, for &pound;10. After cleaning, its fame had spread and Blundell obliged Pope Pius VI's desire for it to enter the papal collection. Blundell had to pay 260 guineas for the same piece in 1801, but as he proclaimed in a letter to his brother-in-law that same year, &#145;You may think me extravagant &hellip; but if I lay out 1000 pounds it is no great affair to me: the money is no object&#146;  (Fejfer and Southworth, 12).<br>
<br>In 1801 Blundell began work on the construction of a pantheon in the grounds of Ince Blundell Hall, also to house his growing collection. He evidently received many visitors, for he found it necessary to limit the number of days he made the collection available to the public. In 1803 he published <span class="italic">An account of the statues, busts, bass-relieves, cinerary urns, and other ancient marbles, and paintings at Ince. Collected by H.B.</span> which was &#145;written with the sole view of serving as a kind of interpreter, in order to obviate the daily questions of those visitors who are not much versed in history, or heathen mythology&#146; (frontispiece). This publication listed 553 items, but by the time of the next published account in 1809&#150;10 there were 599 items in the collection, then the largest private collection of antiquities in Britain. It was on the advice and with the assistance of Townley that he published in 1809 <span class="italic">Engravings and etchings of the principal statues, busts, bass-reliefs, sepulchral monuments, cinerary urns etc. in the collection of Henry Blundell, esq., at Ince</span>, a two-volume collection of 150 engravings.<br>
<br>Although, as a Catholic, Blundell could not hold public office, he was a well-known figure in Liverpool society. He was involved with the early exhibitions held in Liverpool and was the first patron of the Liverpool Academy in 1810. In November 1808 Joseph Farington recorded that Blundell was nearly blind  (Farington, <span class="italic">Diary</span>, 10 Nov 1808). He died on 28 August 1810 at Ince Blundell and was interred in the family vault at Sefton church in Lancashire. The funeral procession was reputed to have extended nearly half a mile  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 385).<br>
<br>The relationship between Blundell and his son was unhappy. Charles was unsociable and refused to marry. Consequently, to preserve the family succession, Blundell left the Lostock estate to his daughters and only Ince Blundell to his son. The will was contested, but sustained. When Charles died in 1837 he left the estate to a cousin, Thomas Weld of Lulworth, on the condition he took the Blundell name; again following litigation the will was upheld. Despite these problems with inheritance, Charles kept the collection intact, adding a significant number of old master drawings. In 1959, with the sale of the estate, the Ince Blundell collection of antiquities was offered as an unconditional gift to the city of Liverpool; it is now part of the collection of the National Museums and Galleries on Merseyside, housed in the Walker Art Gallery, Liverpool. It is the largest collection of antiquities in Britain outside the British Museum. The pictures, bronzes, and modern sculptures remained with the family for many years, although most of the pictures were dispersed at Christies in 1980 (12, 18 December), 1991 (12, 19 April), and 1992 (3 April).<br>
