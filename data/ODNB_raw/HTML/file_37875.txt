<span class="headword">Rackam,  John</span> <span class="st"> [<em>nicknamed </em>Calico Jack]</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1720), <span class="occ">pirate</span>, was quartermaster under Charles Vane, one of the leaders of the New Providence &#145;pirate republic&#146;, when, in November 1718, he challenged Vane's decision not to attack a French frigate in the Windward passage, and was elected captain in his place. Essentially a small-time and not particularly bloodthirsty pirate, who preyed mostly on fishing boats and small coastal vessels, his main claim to fame is that his ship was the one in which two female pirates, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/39085/', "Anne Bonny")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/45454/', "Mary Read")</script>, pursued their scandalous careers. Rackam was supposedly a tall, dark-eyed, handsome man whose swashbuckling manner was matched and supported by his theatrical dress: striped calico shirt, jacket, and trousers.<br>
<br>In May 1719 Rackam, like many of his profession, took advantage of the pardon being offered by the governor of the Bahamas, Captain Woodes Rogers, and while ashore in Nassau he met Anne Bonny (1698&#150;1782), who became his mistress, and joined his crew when he again took up piracy. Mary Read joined them later when Rackam captured the ship on which she was travelling. On 22 August 1720, Rackam and his twelve crew stole the 12 ton sloop <i>William</i> from Nassau harbour, hoisted Rackam's distinctive skull and crossed cutlasses, and attacked several small vessels on a cruise from the Bahamas to Jamaica. On 5 September Woodes Rogers issued a proclamation naming &#145;Rackum&#146; and his crew, including Bonny and Read, as pirates, and sent out vessels to hunt them down. In early November they were captured by &#145;a brisk fellow, one Jonathan Barnet&#146; in the well-armed 90 ton <i>Tyger</i>, one of ten vessels commissioned in 1715 by the then governor of Jamaica, Lord Hamilton, to hunt pirates.<br>
<br>On 16 November 1720, Rackam along with his sailing master George Fetherston, his quartermaster Richard Corner, and most of his crew were tried for piracy before a vice-admiralty court at Spanish Town, Jamaica, under the presidency of the governor, Sir Nicholas Lawes. All eleven were condemned and sentenced to hang. In a separate trial, held ten days after Rackam's execution, Mary Read and Anne Bonny were also sentenced to hang, but were reprieved when they informed the court that they were both &#145;quick with child&#146;.<br>
<br>Rackam and his ten male accomplices were hanged at Gallows Point, Port Royal, Jamaica on 18 November 1720. His body was afterwards hung in irons from a gibbet on Deadman's Cay at the entrance to the harbour, as a deterrent to others. This sandy islet is today named Rackam's Cay.<br>
