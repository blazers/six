<span class="headword">Lodge,  John</span>  (1692&#150;1774), <span class="occ">archivist and genealogist</span>, was born at Bolton-le-Sands, Lancashire, and baptized there on 22 January 1693, the son of Edmund Lodge, a farmer. He was educated at Clapham School, Yorkshire, under Mr Ashe, and entered St John's College, Cambridge, on 26 June 1716, graduating BA in 1719&#150;20 and proceeding MA in 1730. He was ordained deacon at Lincoln on 12 June 1720 and priest at Ely on 23 September 1721. He received a licence to preach at March, Cambridgeshire, on 20 September 1722; a year later he was licensed curate there, and on 15 June 1725 schoolmaster. He afterwards settled in Dublin, where he issued his printed prospectus for his <span class="italic">Irish Peerage</span> in 1742. In 1744 he published <span class="italic">Report of the Trial in Ejectment of Campbell Craig</span>, from notes in his own shorthand, which continued to be a feature in his manuscripts. In 1751, then living in Abbey Street, Dublin, he was appointed deputy keeper of the records in Bermingham Tower; in 1759 he became deputy clerk and keeper of the rolls, and was subsequently deputy registrar of the court of prerogative. He married, first, Miss Hamilton, who claimed kinship with the Abercorn family; and, secondly, Edwarda Galland.<br>
<br>Lodge's chief work, <span class="italic">The Peerage of Ireland</span> (4 vols., 1754), is a monument of industry, accuracy, and learning. Although now superseded in practical use by the second edition of Cokayne's <span class="italic">Complete Peerage</span>, it remains a mine of detailed information about the families connected with the peerage that is not otherwise available. When Mervyn Archdall was preparing his revised edition (published 1789) from Lodge's annotated copy of the <span class="italic">Peerage</span>, he found the experts completely baffled in their attempts to read the cipher Lodge had used for his notes, and was about to give up the task in despair when his wife discovered the key.<br>
<br>In 1770 Lodge published anonymously <span class="italic">The Usage of Holding Parliaments in Ireland</span>, and in 1772, also without his name, a selection of state papers and historical tracts illustrating the government of Ireland during the reigns of Elizabeth I, James I, and Charles I, which he called <span class="italic">Desiderata curiosa Hibernica</span>.<br>
<br>Lodge died at Bath on 22 February 1774. Of his nine children, only one survived him: his son, the Revd William Lodge LLD (1742&#150;1813), who became in 1790 chancellor of Armagh Cathedral. Since 1785 he had been the first librarian of the public library of Armagh, newly established by his munificent patron, Primate Richard Robinson, the creator of Georgian Armagh. Through him, some of John Lodge's books, with marginal notes and corrections, came into the library, but Lodge himself had earlier presented the primate with several important collections dealing with Armagh. In 1865 the librarian William Reeves, who later became bishop of Down and Connor, purchased Lodge's manuscripts from his grandson, William Robinson Lodge, rector of Killybegs. These included not only some of his grandfather's collections, but also the manuscripts he had inherited from Michael Ignatius Dugan (<i>d</i>. 1768), a Dublin broker, among them manuscripts of Sir James Ware, Bishop Anthony Dopping, and Walter Harris, which thus greatly enriched the public library.<br>
<br>Lodge's importance now lies principally in the abstracts and indices he made from the records in his care, which serve in some measure to replace the loss of the records in the destruction of the Public Record Office in Dublin in 1922. The most used of these collections, now in the National Archives of Ireland, were purchased by the government from Lodge's heirs in 1783, in return for annuities of &pound;100 to his widow and &pound;200 to his son, and a detailed catalogue was printed in <span class="italic">The Fifty-Fifth Report of the Deputy Keeper of the Public Records &hellip; in Ireland</span> in 1928. Other significant parts of his collections will be found in the National Library of Ireland, the British Library, and the College of Arms.<br>
