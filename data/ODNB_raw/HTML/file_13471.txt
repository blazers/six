<span class="headword">Hogg,  James</span>  (1806&#150;1888), <span class="occ">publisher</span>, was born near Edinburgh on 26 March 1806, the son of James Hogg. He was educated by the Revd Thomas Sheriff (<i>d</i>. 1836). On 24 August 1818 he was apprenticed to James Muirhead, printer, in Edinburgh. He subsequently entered the printing house attached to the <span class="italic">Caledonian Mercury</span>, where the printing of the seventh edition of the <span class="italic">Encyclopaedia Britannica</span> had commenced in 1827, and became reader on the <span class="italic">Caledonian Mercury</span>. On 13 November 1832 he married Helen Hutchison (1803&#150;1890), of Hutchiestown Farm, near Dunblane.<br>
<br>In 1837 Hogg set up business on his own account as a printer and publisher in Edinburgh. The first publication which bears his imprint is <span class="italic">The Honest Waterman</span>, a small tract brought out in 1837. On 1 March 1845 the first number of <span class="italic">Hogg's Weekly Instructor</span> appeared, a non-sectarian periodical. In 1849 the title was changed to <span class="italic">The Instructor</span> and later to <span class="italic">Titan</span>. The last number is dated December 1859, and the entire work comprises twenty-nine volumes. Hogg did his own editing, latterly with the assistance of his eldest son, James. He also published the principal works of George Gilfillan.<br>
<br>In 1849 he made the acquaintance of Thomas De Quincey, who contributed his <span class="italic">Autobiographic Sketches</span> and other papers to the <span class="italic">Weekly Instructor</span>. He then agreed with Hogg to bring out his <span class="italic">Collected Works</span>, and Hogg later contributed his reminiscences of De Quincey to H. A. Page's (A. H. Japp) <span class="italic">Thomas de Quincey: his Life and Writings</span> (1877). In 1858 Hogg's printing office was discontinued, and in the autumn of that year his sons John and James, who had been taken into partnership, set up a branch publishing office in London, where Hogg later re-established the whole business. Besides the <span class="italic">Churchman's Family Magazine</span>, the firm then published several series of successful books for young people. The periodical entitled <span class="italic">London Society</span>, which was projected by James Hogg jun. in February 1862, attained at one time a circulation of twenty-five thousand monthly. The firm of James Hogg &amp; Sons was dissolved in July 1867. Hogg died at The Acacia, 7 Crescent Road, St John's, Kent, the home of his son John, where he had been living, on 14 March 1888.<br>
