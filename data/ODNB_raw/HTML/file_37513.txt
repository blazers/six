<span class="headword">Harris,  Geoffrey Wingfield</span>  (1913&#150;1971), <span class="occ">physiologist and endocrinologist</span>, was born on 4 June 1913 in Acton, Middlesex, the elder child and only son of Thomas Harris, physicist, from Oxfordshire, who worked at University College, London, at the ballistics department at Woolwich arsenal, and later at Cambridge, and his wife, Winifred Irene, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Stiles, of Buckinghamshire. He was educated at Dulwich College, and for a few months at University College, London, before he went in 1932 to Emmanuel College, Cambridge, where he was awarded a double first in the natural science tripos, 1934 and 1935. He chose St Mary's Hospital, London, for his clinical training and gained the Cambridge degrees of MB (1939), MD (1944), and ScD (1950). His life's work led to the creation of neuroendocrinology, of which he is regarded as the father figure.<br>
<br>In 1936 Harris married Georgina Mary Birnie, daughter of a Scottish engineer. They had a son who qualified in medicine. This marriage ended in a divorce in 1951. In the same year Harris married Margaret (Peggy), daughter of Dr Michael John O'Kane, general practitioner, of Cushendall, Northern Ireland. They had two daughters.<br>
<br>From 1940 to 1947 Harris was demonstrator in anatomy at Cambridge, in 1947&#150;8 lecturer in anatomy, and from 1947 to 1952 lecturer in physiology. In 1952 he became head of the laboratory of experimental neuroendocrinology at the Maudsley Hospital, London, and in 1953 professor of physiology at the University of London. From 1962 until his death he was Dr Lee's professor of anatomy in Oxford, honorary director of the Medical Research Council's neuroendocrinology unit in the university, and fellow of Hertford College, Oxford. He was also an honorary consultant in psychiatry at the Littlemore Hospital, Oxford. He played an important part in establishing the new physiological sciences honour school, in which neuroendocrinology was one of the options.<br>
<br>To understand the significance of Harris's work, it is necessary to realize that until the mid-1930s the connection between the nervous system and the endocrine glands was unknown. In the early 1930s, however, Francis Marshall of Cambridge&#151;who had an immense influence on the young Harris&#151;pointed out that the great majority of animals have a more or less definite season when they breed, raising the question of what it is that controls breeding seasons and how the body is able to react to environmental signals.<br>
<br>While still an undergraduate, Harris took this as his starting point and developed the idea that the seasonality of breeding might be controlled by the transmission of stimuli from the brain to the anterior lobe of the pituitary gland. It was a brilliant insight which led to what is possibly his best known work, <span class="italic">Neural Control of the Pituitary Gland</span> (1955), in which he established that environmental stimuli, acting through the nervous system, led to the release of what later became known as releasing factors from the hypothalamus. These factors travel through a portal system of blood vessels (so called because of the analogy with the hepatic portal circulation), which links the under surface of the hypothalamus and the anterior pituitary, and controls the release of pituitary hormones. Later he showed that this mechanism was common to a wide range of vertebrates, suggesting that it must have a very important functional role. It was this which led to the establishment of neuroendocrinology as a new and rapidly expanding discipline.<br>
<br>Although his ideas were accepted by most of his contemporaries, Harris had his opponents, most notably Solly Zuckerman&#151;an extremely powerful figure in the world of science&#151;who, on the basis of a single flawed experiment on one ferret, decided Harris was wrong and described his work in 1952 as &#145;an edifice of speculation &hellip; that has been erected because of an urge to explain the incomprehensible&#146;  (Vogt), a view which Zuckerman held throughout his life, although everyone else knew that Harris's findings were so firmly based as to be incontrovertible.<br>
<br>Harris then showed that there was a link between the central nervous system and other endocrine glands. For example, he showed that the control of the secretions of the adrenal cortex was mediated through the release of ACTH (adrenocorticotrophic hormone) by the anterior pituitary when it received the appropriate signals from the hypothalamus. Further research by Harris was concerned with the effect of gonadal hormones on sexual differentiation of the brain during neonatal life, and the isolation of hypothalamic releasing factors.<br>
<br>It has been said that &#145;Harris put the brain into the endocrine system&#146;  (Raisman). Certainly his work was immensely broad and influential. It has led to an understanding of the neural mechanisms which underlie cycles of birth, growth, reproduction, and death in the animal kingdom. In medicine it has clarified a whole range of clinical conditions, and it has increased our understanding of the physiological changes associated with stress, emotional trauma, and jet lag.<br>
<br>Harris was a large, powerfully built, and energetic man, a keen boxer and rugby player in his youth, who continued to play squash into his fifties, often beating much younger players. He was an excellent teacher and generous and helpful colleague; his outstanding success was based on the combination of an excellent operative technique, a continual bubbling flow of ideas, and a huge capacity for work. His publications included chapters in more than twenty texts, and over a hundred original papers. He was elected FRS in 1953, received an Oxford DM in 1962, was appointed CBE in 1965, and received the Dale medal of the Endocrine Society in 1971. Harris died at the Radcliffe Infirmary, Oxford, on 29 November 1971, survived by his wife. His ashes were later buried in Bladon churchyard. The Physiological Society established a lecture in memory of Harris in 1986.<br>
