<span class="headword">Hilton,  John</span>  (1880&#150;1943), <span class="occ">social scientist and broadcaster</span>, was born at 14 Rumworth Street, Bolton, Lancashire, on 28 December 1880, the first son and the last of seven children of John Hilton (<i>b</i>. 1841) and his wife, Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Bowden. He avoided much of the poverty that the rest of his family had had to endure. His father had risen steadily from spindle polisher to become Bolton's first school attendance officer and his mother, with the assistance of her six daughters, had opened a confectioner's shop which had improved the family's fortunes by the time of John's birth. After attending elementary schools, at the age of twelve he won a two-year scholarship to Bolton grammar school, but turning his back on further study, he left at the age of fourteen to become a handyman in a bicycle repair shop. In 1896, on his sixteenth birthday, he took up an apprenticeship as a mill mechanic, attending evening classes at Bolton Technical School. He became a fitter in a loom works in Bury, but within two weeks was promoted to foreman and later manager in this and another mill in Heywood. On 25 June 1902 he married Ellen (Nellie) Chadbond, a cotton mill worker, daughter of Joseph Chadbond, file cutter; they had one son and two daughters.<br>
<br>Hilton's career was interrupted by a bout of sciatica, and he spent the period from September 1907 until June 1908 recuperating in St Petersburg. Having returned to England, he became a lecturer and journalist with the Free Trade Union in Brighton, before moving to London where he became interested in the Norman Angell Movement, dedicated to maintaining peace through fostering knowledge about international relations. His connections here led to his appointment as acting secretary of the Garton Foundation which, after the First World War, hosted a government-sponsored study of trade organizations and combinations in the United Kingdom, featuring such figures from the labour movement as Sidney Webb and Ernest Bevin who, together with Hilton, were critical of the ineffective <span class="roman">Profiteering Acts</span>.<br>
<br>In 1919 Hilton became assistant secretary and director of statistics in the Ministry of Labour, where he focused his work on understanding the plight of the unemployed. Eschewing purely quantitative analyses of unemployment figures, he developed techniques for more detailed investigations into case histories using interviews and observations of labour exchanges. These methods led him to point out not only the abuse of the system by certain recipients, but the more important problem of the application of inappropriate rules for assessing individuals' eligibility. His work here gained the respect of the international statistical community and he became a strong advocate of the work of the International Labour Organization in Geneva. He also promoted international real-wage comparisons. President of the third and fourth conferences of labour statisticians, he also became a member of the International Institute of Statistics and a council member of the Royal Statistical Society.<br>
<br>In 1931 Hilton took up, as its first holder, the Montagu Burton chair in industrial relations at the University of Cambridge. He was co-author of a survey <span class="italic">Are Trade Unions Obstructive?</span> (1935). He maintained an uneasy relationship with his colleagues, particularly since his position never led to an election to a college fellowship. He believed that too few Cambridge economists were concerned with the social side of economics. In 1933 he began his work at the BBC with a series of talks on industrial relations. Adopting a clear, chatty, and non-patronizing tone, his broadcasts soon attracted an audience and he was invited to give the industrial talks for a much wider series, the <span class="italic">National Stocktaking</span>, from the end of 1933. In 1934 he broadcast <span class="italic">This and That</span>, which spoke to the unemployed on a whole series of issues encountered in their day-to-day existence.<br>
<br>Along with his weekly column and daily questions and answers in the <span class="italic">News Chronicle</span> from 1936 to 1939, the broadcasts secured Hilton something of a reputation as friendly uncle figure to ordinary men and women. He received thousands of letters from the public requesting help on many subjects, some of which became the basis for future broadcasts (his third series of <span class="italic">This and That</span> dealt with problems of a contractual nature, such as the relationship between landlord and tenant). Others led to wider public debates, such as his investigations into the credit system which had some impact on the 1938 <span class="roman">Hire Purchase Act</span>. Listeners' responses formed the basis of his book <span class="italic">Why I Go in for the Pools</span> (1936), a survey of the aspirations of those who invested in football pools. His championing of the poor and disadvantaged led to criticism, but also greater public recognition. In 1939 he participated in an early television programme in which he questioned such prominent individuals as Sir Walter Citrine on the future of the trade unions.<br>
<br>During the Second World War Hilton became director of home publicity at the Ministry of Information; he toured the country to listen to the problems of ordinary people so that he could better explain the government's wartime measures. He continued broadcasting (<span class="italic">John Hilton Talking</span>) and in March 1942 he took up an invitation from the <span class="italic">News of the World</span> to direct their new advice bureau which was soon receiving 2&#150;3000 letters a week (after his death it was renamed the John Hilton bureau). Furthermore, he visited the forces in north Africa, writing an 80,000 word report on the administration of the armed services, a tour which only added to his exhaustion and overwork. In 1943 he suffered a cerebral haemorrhage and died at the Evelyn Nursing Home in Cambridge on 28 August 1943.<br>
<br>Although connected to the labour movement and an academic economist by profession, Hilton's empathy for the plight of the poor owed less to political theory than to a deep-seated humanism, influenced by his own family and social background. At times this meant he came across as a cloth-capped John Bull, but his concerns for the problems faced by ordinary people were clearly genuine. As he wrote in the <span class="italic">News Chronicle</span>: &#145;I believe &hellip; in Tom, Dick and Harry (and, of course, in Peggy, Joan and Kate) &hellip; I know how important to the scheme of things are Sir Thomas, Professor Richard, and the Right Honourable Henry &hellip; but if they start throwing their weight about too much and I have to take a side, I side with Tom, Dick and Harry&#146; (16 Nov 1936, cited in Lyddon, 95). The context within which his broadcasts must be placed therefore is the general interest in social conditions developed during the depression era. It is no surprise that Hilton was highly interested in the anthropological investigations of Tom Harrisson into the lives of the working class, coincidentally focused on Hilton's home town of Bolton. His broadcasting style owed much to the &#145;middle brow&#146; intimacy and intelligence of J. B. Priestley, who similarly sought to address universal issues on the radio which could be of interest to all. But Hilton's attention to the everyday problems also anticipated the consumer journalism which was to become highly popular after the Second World War. By responding to concerns over the &#145;tallyman&#146; and other &#145;rackets&#146; Hilton drew attention to many of the consumer problems which were increasingly preoccupying a population having to negotiate its way through an increasingly complex market place and official bureaucracy. In the title of one of his radio series, <span class="italic">On Having a Bit of Money</span> (1938, published posthumously as <span class="italic">Rich Man, Poor Man</span>, 1944), Hilton highlighted his understanding of not only the problems faced by the poor, but the hopes and desires to which he believed they rightly aspired.<br>
