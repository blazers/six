<span class="headword">Philip,  George</span>  (1800&#150;1882), <span class="occ">cartographer and map publisher</span>, was born at Huntly, Aberdeenshire. His father was John Philip, farmer, who, with his wife (of whom nothing is known) had at least three sons and a daughter. The family was staunchly Calvinist: two of the sons became ministers and the teaching of the local minister, George Cowie, gave George an abiding zeal to promote education for all. In 1819 he went to Liverpool where his brother Robert was a nonconformist minister. As a prolific writer of devotional books, Robert was familiar with the local bookselling trade and through Robert's introduction George became assistant to the leading Liverpool bookseller, William Grapel, in 1819. In 1834 he set up his own business as bookseller and stationer in Paradise Street, but rapidly expanded to produce books, particularly maps and educational works, and within the first year had to move to larger premises, the Atlas Buildings in South Castle Street. He placed orders with well-known cartographers, notably John Bartholomew the elder, August Petermann, and William Hughes, for maps on copper plates which he printed and had hand-coloured by his women tinters. His maps ranged from the expensive <span class="italic">Imperial Library Atlas</span> (1864) to an atlas costing as little as 3<i>d</i>. and, although the bulk of his production was for the commercial, and particularly the educational market, he also produced important scientific maps, notably of North America, especially the Arctic and Pacific Northwest, and of the West Indies.<br>
<br>Nothing is known of Philip's marriage save that he had one son, also George (1823&#150;1902), who in 1848 was admitted as a partner in the business. It is likely that Philip took into his care his nephew, Thomas Dash Philip (1829&#150;1913), after the death of his father, Philip's brother John, in 1837 (such care for his family was typical&#151;he also supported his sister in her old age). Thomas joined the firm in 1851, assumed control of the retail bookselling and school supply departments in 1854, and became a partner in the newly formed additional company, Philip, Son and Nephew, in 1859. In 1851&#150;2 a London house was opened at 32 Fleet Street (later also 30 and 31 Fleet Street) to promote sales of the firm's geographical and educational publications at home and abroad. The Fleet Street premises had been owned by the publisher John Murray and with them Philip acquired Murray's trademark of &#145;the ship&#146;. The firm's rapid growth was helped by new technology&#151;notably power-driven lithographic presses and the machine colouring of maps (used effectively on his county maps of 1862); and by the separation of printing, housed in the purpose-built Caxton Buildings in Liverpool, from publishing and sales, still at South Castle Street and after in Hope Street. Further expansion was prompted by the demand from board schools established after 1870 for general textbooks, school stationery and equipment, and specialist atlases and wall maps. The firm also supplied atlases and textbooks for many overseas countries in several languages, beginning with an atlas for Australian schools in 1865 and for New Zealand in 1869. Philip retired from the business on 1 July 1879 to The Retreat, Bickley, Kent, and died on 3 October 1882 at Huntly House, Lilley Road, Fairfield, Liverpool, the home of one of his executors, James Askins Crowe, merchant. He was shrewd and canny, energetic, innovative and ready to take advantage of opportunity; in build he was short and solid with a head of thick sandy hair. His success in business is shown by his leaving over &pound;95,000 in his will. His son exploited the same markets as his father and promoted several educational publications, notably the <span class="italic">Systematic Atlas</span> (1894), initiated and edited by the eminent geographers E. G. Ravenstein, John Scott Keltie, and Halford Mackinder which combined new ideas of scientific geography with high technical standards. George Philip &amp; Son Ltd remained a flourishing family firm until in April 1988 it was sold to the Octopus Publishing Company, part of Reed International Group of Companies, London; it continued to trade as George Philip Ltd.<br>
