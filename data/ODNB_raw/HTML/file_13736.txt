<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Hope, Sir  Thomas, of Craighall</span>, first baronet  (1573&#150;1646), <span class="occ">advocate and politician</span>, was the son of Henry Hope, an Edinburgh merchant of French descent, and his wife, Jacqueline de Tott (or de Jott). The couple witnessed the St Bartholomew's day massacre of Huguenots in Paris before fleeing to Scotland. His father was dead by the time of his graduation, as master of arts at Edinburgh University on 12 August 1592, and his mother subsequently returned to France for nearly thirty years.<h2>
<a name="Advocateandwriter"></a>Advocate and writer</h2>Hope committed himself to a career in law, but lack of means to finance further study meant that his progress was at first slow. By 21 March 1600 he had made sufficient progress to be appointed by the general assembly of the Church of Scotland to be the church's solicitor and advocate, and about the same time he entered the service of his cousin John Nicolson of Lasswade, a well-established Edinburgh writer (solicitor). Shortly before his own death he was to remember Nicolson as &#145;my maister, under quhom I learnit not only my calling as a citizen, but my calling as a Christian&#146;  (Fraser, 1.xxxv).<br>
<br>Hope married Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1660), daughter of John Bennet, in or before 1602 (their first child being born in June 1603), and he was admitted to the Faculty of Advocates in Edinburgh on 7 February 1605. He quickly made a name for himself through being one of the four advocates for the defence at the trial at Linlithgow on 10 January 1606 of six parish ministers accused of treason for declining to acknowledge the authority of the privy council of Scotland over the general assembly of the church. The lawyers urged their clients to submit as they had no defence, and on their refusal to do so the two most senior advocates withdrew from the case. Hope, however, led such an eloquent defence that, though his clients were found guilty, his boldness and skill made his reputation. He won for himself &#145;the estimatioune both of a guid man and of a guid advocate&#146;  (J. Melvill, <span class="italic">Autobiography</span>, ed. R. Pitcairn, 1842, 621). &#145;His pleading that day procured him great estimatioun and manie clients; and his credite has ever grown sensyne [since]&#146;  (D. Calderwood, <span class="italic">History of the Kirk of Scotland</span>, ed. T. Thomson, 8 vols., 1842&#150;9, 6.379).<br>
<br>This trial &#145;laid the foundation of a phenomenally successful professional career&#146;  (Hope, <span class="italic">Major Practicks</span>, 1.vii), and already by 1608 Sir Thomas Hamilton, the lord advocate, who had led the prosecution at the 1606 trial, could refer to Hope as one of &#145;the most learned and best experienced&#146; advocates in Scotland  (J. Maidment, ed., <span class="italic">State Papers &hellip; of Thomas Earl of Melros</span>, 2 vols., 1837, 1.50). Much of the profit from his lucrative legal practice was invested in land, including the estate of Craighall in Fife, and he also remembered his old college, paying for the building of two chambers for the use of Edinburgh University in 1625&#150;6. Hope also found time for writing, drafting his <span class="italic">Minor Practicks</span>&#151;by, according to family tradition, dictating the text to his sons while he was dressing  (T. Hope, <span class="italic">Minor Practicks</span>, new edn, 1726, vii)&#151;and compiling the <span class="italic">Major Practicks</span>, a comprehensive digest of statutes and decisions interspersed with &#145;practical observations&#146;  (H. Mackechnie, ed., <span class="italic">Introductory Survey of the Sources and Literature of Scots Law</span>, 1936, 36). He also published a Latin poem on the accession of Charles I, and translations into Latin of the <span class="roman">Psalms</span> and the <span class="roman">Song of Solomon</span> and a genealogy of the earls of Mar are also attributed to him.<h2>
<a name="ServantofCharlesI"></a>Servant of Charles I</h2>With the accession of Charles I in 1625 Hope added public business to his private practice, being given a central role in the king's plans to revoke grants of church property to subjects. The main achievement of the complicated investigations and negotiations that followed was a settlement of the chaotic matter of teinds (tithes) in Scotland. Eventually most other property which had passed to the nobility and gentry was confirmed in their hands in a settlement ratified by the Scottish parliament in 1633. In these years Hope emerged as one of the most active and talented of the king's Scottish servants, ready to use all his skills to uphold the king's powers. His services were acknowledged by his appointment on 29 May 1626 as joint lord advocate with the elderly Sir William Oliphant (<i>d</i>. April 1628). His appointment was evidently not popular with the court of session, which was rebuked by Charles I for its treatment of him in December 1626. Further royal favour brought him admission to the Scottish privy council on 10 January 1628, and appointment as a baronet of Nova Scotia on 19 February the same year.<br>
<br>Hope's rise was closely connected to that of William Grahame, earl of Menteith, who was appointed president of the Scottish council in February 1628. When Menteith claimed the ancient earldom of Strathearn he was advised and encouraged by Hope, and the king recognized his title in July 1631. Hope received his reward in favours to his family. His second son, Thomas, was knighted in 1631, and his youngest, James, was appointed a judge of the court of session in 1632&#151;though only after a delay during which Hope bombarded Menteith with grovelling pleas on his son's behalf, terrified by rumours that the post would go to a rival and begging the earl not to treat him with &#145;contempt and ignomie&#146; by allowing him to be so disgraced  (Fraser, 2.128&#150;9). A major threat to Hope's reputation emerged when allegations were made that possession of the earldom of Strathearn, which he had gained for his patron, implied a claim to the throne. This led to the earl's disgrace in 1633, when he was stripped of his offices and his new title. Hope was left open to allegations that in his advice to Menteith he had put the earl's interests before those of the crown, but he survived this crisis and had the courage to help his former patron to reach a settlement with the king. A political enemy, Lord Napier, charged him with being &#145;a base follower of greatness, and maliciously eloquent&#146;  (M. Napier, <span class="italic">Memoirs of Montrose</span>, 2 vols., 1856, 1.110), but he showed loyalty to one fallen from greatness in a way that could have damaged his own career.<br>
<br>In 1634 Hope acted for the crown in the prosecution of Lord Balmerino, who was charged with leasing-making for being connected with an unpublished text critical of royal policy in religion. Hope secured Balmerino's conviction and condemnation to death on 14 November, though he was later pardoned. Thus Hope played leading roles in enforcing all the main policies&#151;the revocation, religious reform, and the suppression of aristocratic dissent&#151;which were central to the alienation of Scotland's landowners from the crown. But though he was zealous in upholding the civil powers of the crown, at heart he was sympathetic to those who opposed the changes in church government and worship which Charles I wished to impose. He probably expressed his reservations in council, for it seems likely that it was more than coincidence that a week after the privy council approved preliminary orders for the introduction of a new prayer book (20 December 1636) Hope heard rumours that he was to be removed from office, or have a joint lord advocate appointed to work with him. He indignantly protested, stressing &#145;my sufferings&#146; and great losses&#151;estimated at over &pound;100,000 Scots (presumably lost private practice revenue)&#151;in the king's service. He attributed the move to replace him to the earl of Traquair, the treasurer and Charles I's most influential Scottish adviser, who was becoming notorious for his bullying of anyone who opposed him. A report in January 1637, however, suggests that it was Hope's disagreement with Traquair over a private case that led the earl to threaten him with dismissal from office.<h2>
<a name="Thetroublesof16371640"></a>The troubles of 1637&#150;1640</h2>Such early indications of Hope's crisis of conscience lend credibility to the allegation that in April 1637 he was present at a meeting at which demonstrations to be held when the prayer book was first used were planned. Certainly in that month he went to Pencaitland to take communion according to traditional forms, and this was regarded as a public enough declaration of his dissent to earn him a rebuke from William Laud, the archbishop of Canterbury. In the months that followed the first riots against the prayer book on 23 July 1637, Hope became a major embarrassment to the regime. In September he stated that although he had consented to the imposing of the prayer book &#145;he meant not an active but a passive obedience to the King's desyre, and that he never intended to accept it as warrantable&#146;  (J. Gordon, <span class="italic">History of Scots Affairs</span>, 3 vols., 1841, 1.14). When in November those supplicating the king on grievances began to elect commissioners to meet in Edinburgh, he infuriated the king's supporters by declaring that their proceedings were legal, and as a privy councillor he refused to sign a proclamation of 20 February 1638 denouncing the king's opponents on the grounds that in it Traquair had exceeded the king's orders. At the end of the month he refrained from signing the national covenant, but joined other lawyers in declaring it legal and justifiable. In the opinion of royalists, he now became the covenanters' &#145;oracle&#146;, advising them on their policies  (<span class="italic">Memoirs of Henry Guthry</span>, 26, 130).<br>
<br>When the marquess of Hamilton arrived in Scotland as the king's representative in May 1638 to try to reach a settlement, &#145;one of the greatest troubles&#146; was that many lawyers, and especially Hope, supported the covenanters. Hamilton was ignorant of Scottish law while Hope &#145;was as skilled as much as any ever was&#146;, and in the privy council frequently ruled that actions proposed by Hamilton were illegal  (Burnet, 53). On the issuing of the &#145;king's covenant&#146; as a rival to the national covenant Hope indeed signed it, and urged others to do so. But he then declared that, contrary to the king's intentions, the new covenant bound its signatories to reject the innovations in religion that he was seeking to enforce. When the covenanters none the less decided to oppose the king's covenant, Hope declared himself &#145;almost stupefeit&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters and Journals of Robert Baillie</span>, 1.474) with disappointment, because he had thought that his stratagem of imposing his interpretation of the new covenant would have forced the king to back down.<br>
<br>Hamilton ordered Hope to attend the Glasgow assembly in November 1638 and defend episcopacy, but he refused. When threatened with dismissal from office, he replied that Hamilton could not remove him, as his appointment had been ratified by parliament. Hamilton furiously denounced him as &#145;A bad and most wicked instrument&#146;, warning the king that while Hope remained in office, with his great influence in the privy council &#145;no thing will goe a right in your service conserning the Churche; nay, so pernicious is he, that I doe confes &hellip; that I take him to be a woorse instrument then anie Covenanter&#146;  (S. R. Gardiner, ed., <span class="italic">Hamilton Papers</span>, CS, new ser., 27, 1890, 50&#150;51). Hope &#145;should be removed, for he is ill dispposed&#146;  (P. Yorke, earl of Hardwicke, <span class="italic">Miscellaneous State Papers</span>, 2 vols., 1778, 2.117). However, one of the peculiarities of Charles I was that he sometimes retained men in office even though he knew they were opposed to his plans, confident that he could make them obey. With Hope this proved a disastrous miscalculation. Not until January 1640 did he act against Hope&#151;and even then he only banished him to his own house of Craighall. Hope responded dramatically &#145;I am to goo to morrow to the place of my confyning And to remayne and die thair, if so be youre majesty's plesure&#146;  (NA Scot., GD 406/1/1285, 1286). He seemed to royalists a traitor, betraying the king's regime from within, but in his own mind he was a loyal servant in civil matters, and indeed an upholder of royal power, but considered that in religion obedience to his interpretation of God's will had to overrule allegiance to the crown. In accordance with this stance he urged the earl of Rothes in January 1640 not to press the king on &#145;civill pointis&#146; (constitutional reform) because this would allow the king to win support by claiming that the covenanters were attacking monarchy. &#145;For civill points, luik nevir to haif me to go with yow&#146;  (Hope, <span class="italic">Diary</span>, 115&#150;16).<h2>
<a name="Parliamentandthecovenanters16401643"></a>Parliament and the covenanters, 1640&#150;1643</h2>Charles I, climbing a new peak of political folly, accepted Hope's distinction between civil and religious affairs sufficiently for him to believe it safe to release Hope from his confinement so that he could represent the crown by implementing an order to postpone the session of the Scottish parliament which was due to meet on 2 June 1640. But Hope, citing technical problems about the validity of the commission under which he was supposed to act, failed to prevent parliament meeting. To royalists this was further betrayal, and the legislation subsequently passed by the parliament aimed at achieving a massive reduction in the powers of the crown. This, however, was in fact as little to Hope's taste as it was to the king's. One act abolished the civil right of officers of state, including the lord advocate, to sit in parliament, and when Hope tried to take his seat in August 1641 he was removed. He complained furiously at the loss of a traditional right of the crown's legal agent, and it was eventually conceded that he could be present in parliament when called for, to give advice or plead, but not to vote. However, when he was duly summoned his arguments in parliament were a source of irritation to the covenanters. His &#145;idle curiositie&#146;&#151;which may be interpreted as regard for legal technicalities&#151;blocked legislation on schools and stipends. Far more significantly, at the end of the 1641 session when the king was ready to assent to legislation which amounted to a constitutional revolution at the expense of royal power, Hope urged him to include a statement reserving the crown's rights, thus indicating that royal prerogative remained undamaged. Robert Baillie interpreted this as &#145;idlenesse&#146; or irresponsibility  (<span class="italic">Letters and Journals of Robert Baillie</span>, 1.394, 397), but it was far more than that. It was a clear statement of Hope's constitutional beliefs in civil matters. Charles, however, ignored his advice, for making any such reservation would have led to the collapse of settlement between him and the Scots, which was vital to the king to free him to turn his attention to crises in England and Ireland.<br>
<br>Hope's support for royal authority led him to oppose the covenanters again in 1643. They summoned a convention of estates after the king refused permission for the Scottish parliament to meet to discuss the crisis caused by the English civil war, but Hope joined Hamilton in protesting that this could not be done without the king's sanction. It was perhaps partly this stand that led to the appointment of Hope to act as king's commissioner to the general assembly of the church which was due to meet on 2 August, though the main reason was evidently that no royalist nobles were willing to act. It was clear that, in the prevailing mood in Scotland, the assembly would favour intervening in the English war on the side of parliament, and whoever acted as commissioner would then be blamed by the king for not preventing it from doing so. The assembly proceeded to draft the solemn league and covenant. By one account Hope failed to execute the king's instructions, being so influenced by his two covenanter sons &#145;that he resolved to say nothing to the Church or countrey's prejudice&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters and Journals of Robert Baillie</span>, 2.83&#150;4), but in fact he tried to continue balancing his conflicting religious and civil allegiances, declaring &#145;his personal heartie consent&#146; to the new covenant, but then as king's commissioner assenting to it only so far as it concerned religion and the liberties of the church, and refusing to accept civil alliance with the English parliament. However the covenanter leaders &#145;did so alwayes overawe his Grace, that he made us not great trouble&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters and Journals of Robert Baillie</span>, 2.95&#150;6).<h2>
<a name="Reputationandfinalyears"></a>Reputation and final years</h2>Hope's actions as king's advocate in 1637&#150;43 were hugely damaging to Charles I, frequently preventing effective action and giving the covenanters the propaganda advantage of being able to claim that the king's senior legal adviser supported their interpretations of the law. On the occasions when he tried to support the crown's civil power he was ignored. In public he expressed his support for much of what the covenanters did concerning religion in terms of interpreting the law, but in private his religious zeal revealed itself in emotional outbursts on paper. Thus when episcopacy was declared unlawful by the 1639 general assembly Hope recorded this as being &#145;to the unspeakabill joy of all of them that feiris the Lord, and waittis for his salvatioun&#146;  (Hope, <span class="italic">Diary</span>, 104). However, his diary also bears evidence of the strain of trying to reconcile duty to God and king when the two were in conflict. From April 1639 he was strengthened by a voice that spoke to him, which he came to accept as divine. After praying that the king would spare the Scots from the rage of their enemies, the voice said &#145;I will preserve and saiff [save] my peopill&#146;. When he prayed that God would take pity on the kirk, the voice said &#145;I will pitie it&#146; and &#145;I will arisse&#146;  (Hope, <span class="italic">Diary</span>, 89, 96, 98). In 1641 his fear of the consequences of his actions led to bad dreams in which he was lost in mist or darkness, or was accused of treason. An unsympathetic nineteenth-century editor reacted to Hope's voices and dreams by denouncing him for being &#145;degraded &hellip; by strange and humiliating indications of weakness and credulity&#146;  (Hope, <span class="italic">Diary</span>, v), but they may now be recognized as symptoms of the intense conflicts of loyalties he was experiencing.<br>
<br>In his last years Hope played little part in public affairs: the covenanting regime which ruled the country employed their own procurators of state in legal matters. In February 1646, in anticipation of his death, he recommended that he be succeeded as lord advocate by Thomas Nicolson, his cousin, because of ties of blood and Hope's respect for Nicolson's dead father and uncle. If he declined, Sir Archibald Johnston of Wariston was to have the office  (Fraser, 1.xxxv). In the event Wariston was appointed&#151;but Nicolson succeeded him in 1649. On 1 October 1646, in Edinburgh, after a few days' illness, Hope died &#145;about 10 a clocke at night&#146;  (J. Hope, &#145;Diary&#146;, <span class="italic">Miscellany of the Scottish History Society</span>, 9, 1958, 194) after giving his blessing to his family. Contemporaries agreed in accepting that he had been a remarkably talented and successful lawyer, but disagreed as to whether he had treacherously betrayed his king, or admirably put conscience before any worldly considerations. His diary makes clear his love and concern for the advancement of his family. Six of his children reached adulthood. The two daughters married a knight and a lord; three sons&#151;<script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13728/', "Sir John Hope, Lord Craighall (1603x5&#150;1654)")</script>, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13735/', "Sir Thomas Hope of Kerse (1606&#150;1643)")</script>, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13722/', "Sir James Hope of Hopetoun (1614&#150;1661)")</script>&#151;became judges in the court of session, and the fourth the king's cupbearer. This was to be the foundation for a remarkable dynasty of eminent Scottish lawyers in the following centuries.<br>
