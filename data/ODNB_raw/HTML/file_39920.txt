<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Albery, Sir  Donald Arthur Rolleston</span>  (1914&#150;1988), <span class="occ">theatre manager</span>, was born on 19 June 1914 at 33 Cumberland Terrace, Regent's Park, London, the elder son and second of the four children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30754/', "Sir Bronson James Albery (1881&#150;1971)")</script>, theatre director, and his wife, Una Gwynn (<i>d</i>. 1981), daughter of Thomas William Rolleston, Irish scholar and poet. He was educated at Alpine College, Switzerland, and joined the family firm of Wyndham and Albery, owners and managers of three London theatres: the Criterion in Piccadilly Circus, and Wyndham's and the New (after 1972 the Albery), both built by his grandmother, the actress <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/37053/', "Mary Charlotte Moore")</script>, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/37051/', "Sir Charles Wyndham")</script>, her partner and second husband. His first position of importance, as general manager of Sadler's Wells Ballet in London (1941&#150;5), was complicated by wartime emergencies. On one occasion he arrived in Bath to find that the trucks containing scenery and costumes were immobilized in a siding close to unexploded bombs.<br>
<br>On first nights at his theatres Donald Albery, a tall lean figure, would be seen walking about the auditorium with a slight limp. He was prematurely bald and had a long narrow face, and in later years his resemblance to his father became more marked. He inherited the family business sense, though his taste in plays was modern, whereas Sir Bronson Albery was known for his classical productions. In 1953 he formed his own company, Donmar, and his choice of dramatists included Graham Greene, Tennessee Williams, Edward Albee, Jean Anouilh, and Iris Murdoch (adapted by J. B. Priestley). Greene's <span class="italic">The Living Room</span>, with Dorothy Tutin, was his favourite production, and <span class="italic">I am a Camera</span>, John van Druten's adaptation from Christopher Isherwood, gave him &#145;enormous pleasure&#146;.<br>
<br>Although he ran his theatres with an eye to commercial success, Albery could spring surprises and on occasion was prepared to take risks. He had youthful memories of going to Paris with his parents to see the Compagnie des Quinze, which Bronson admired and brought to London knowing that their appeal would be limited. On hearing about Samuel Beckett's <span class="italic">Waiting for Godot</span>, Albery went to Paris and decided to put it on in London. He hoped to cast star names in the roles of the tramps, but after two years of failing to persuade any of them&#151;including Laurence Olivier and Ralph Richardson&#151;the play opened at the Arts Theatre Club in 1955, directed by the young Peter Hall and without stars. In a daring move, he transferred it to the Criterion in the heart of the West End, where it survived for nearly 300 performances, though the audiences were frankly puzzled. Many left at the interval; the performances were disturbed by shouts of &#145;Take it off!&#146;, &#145;Rubbish!&#146;, and &#145;It's a disgrace!&#146; The run was dogged by illness in the cast and inadequate understudies. In these unhappy circumstances the high teas provided by the management between the Saturday performances were greatly appreciated.<br>
<br>During the late 1950s and the 1960s the idiosyncratic productions of Joan Littlewood at the Theatre Royal, Stratford East, appealed to Albery. Under his management they moved to the West End and some even went to New York&#151;another example of his adventurous spirit. These included <span class="italic">A Taste of Honey</span> and Brendan Behan's <span class="italic">The Hostage</span> (both 1959) and <span class="italic">Fings ain't what they used t'be</span> (1960). Out of gratitude to Joan Littlewood he presented a crystal chandelier to the Theatre Royal. This connection brought him his greatest success, the musical <span class="italic">Oliver!</span> (1960) by Lionel Bart (who also wrote the score of <span class="italic">Fings ain't</span>). <span class="italic">Oliver!</span> had been turned down by three managements and opened so disastrously at Wimbledon that doubts were expressed about the wisdom of taking it to the West End, where advance bookings (at the New) amounted to just &pound;145. A new musical director had to be found at the last moment, but the first night changed these gloomy expectations, and Sean Kenny's revolving set, on which everything took place, was rapturously received. <span class="italic">Oliver!</span> ran for 2618 performances and has since been revived.<br>
<br>In 1960, against strong competition from Bernard Delfont, Albery added the Piccadilly to the Wyndham&#150;Albery empire. Thus 3360 seats were offered to the public at every performance in these four theatres. At one point, when it looked as if the Criterion, the oldest of them, would be endangered by a Piccadilly Circus development scheme, Albery leapt eagerly into the fray and fought hard&#151;enjoying the battle&#151;and finally won. After <span class="italic">Oliver!</span> he produced several other musicals: in 1966 a failure, <span class="italic">Jorrocks</span>, which lost &pound;70,000; and in 1968 a success, <span class="italic">Man of La Mancha</span>, which called for extensive structural alterations to the Piccadilly stage, and so, by special permission of the lord chamberlain, the safety curtain was never lowered during the run. Albery was the first manager to investigate the tourist trade in relation to the theatre. This pioneering survey proved beyond doubt that without overseas visitors the theatres would suffer irreparably (though this situation had been suspected for years).<br>
<br>When Sir Bronson Albery died in 1971 Donald Albery took control. In 1977 he became the third member of his family to receive a knighthood; in the following year he sold the theatres and retired to Monte Carlo. His son Ian carried on for a time, later becoming chief executive of the rebuilt Sadler's Wells Theatre. During the Albery regime their theatres were regarded as being among the best run in London, and the two back-to-back theatres, Wyndham's in Charing Cross Road and the Albery in St Martin's Lane, housed some of the most interesting productions of the period. From 1958 to 1978 Donald Albery was also a director of Anglia Television.<br>
<br>Albery was married three times. On 7 July 1934 he married Rubina (Ruby), daughter of Archibald Curie Macgilchrist, medical officer in India; she died in 1956 as a result of injuries incurred in a Second World War air raid. Ian Albery was their only son. In 1946, the year of his divorce from Ruby, he married, on 1 February, (Cicely Margaret) Heather (<i>b</i>. 1915/16), daughter of Brigadier-General Reginald Harvey Henderson Boys. They had two sons, one of whom was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/75949/', "Nicholas Bronson Albery (1948&#150;2001)")</script>, social activist and charity founder, and a daughter. The marriage was dissolved in 1974, and in 1978 in New York he married Nobuko, daughter of Keiji Uenishi, businessman, and former wife of Professor Ivan Morris. Albery died in Monte Carlo on 14 September 1988.<br>
