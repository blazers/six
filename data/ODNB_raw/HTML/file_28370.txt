<span class="headword">Wadding,  Peter</span>  (1583&#150;1644), <span class="occ">Jesuit and theologian</span>, was born at Waterford in Ireland, the son of Thomas Wadding and Mary Walsh (<i>d</i>. before 1601). Both parents belonged to prominent Roman Catholic families of whom many members entered religious orders. Five of Peter Wadding's brothers and many of his cousins were ordained priests, mostly Franciscans or Jesuits, among whom was his cousin, the well-known Franciscan Luke Wadding, later founder of St Isidore's College, Rome. Thomas Walsh, archbishop of Cashel from 1626 to 1654, was related to Peter Wadding on his mother's side.<br>
<br>Wadding studied humanities for seven years in Ireland, probably at the local grammar school in Waterford, before he left for the continent, where he studied for some time at the Irish College, Douai. He entered the Jesuit noviciate on 24 October 1601 at Tournai. There he studied and subsequently taught theology, philosophy, poetry, and rhetoric. On 18 October 1609 he was ordained priest. In 1611 one of his superiors described him as<blockquote>a man of remarkable talent, judgment and virtue, and fit for all offices in the Society; he will be a good preacher, and good superior, and he is gifted with conversational powers. As he is a man of great promise, it seems desirable that he should complete his theological studies at Louvain, before he is sent to Ireland or destined for anything else. (Hogan, 183ff.)</blockquote>There were several requests from Ireland for his return, but his superiors decided otherwise and he continued his studies at Louvain, where he became professor of theology in 1615. He also taught for some time at the Jesuit college at Antwerp. He was certainly active in Antwerp in 1621, when he had a public dispute about theological questions regarding predestination and grace with the Dutch Arminian Simon Biscop or Episcopius. A Latin manuscript relating to this dispute is preserved in the Bodleian Library. An account of it was later published in Dutch under protestant auspices as <span class="italic">Twee brieven van den gelerden Peter Wading in sijn leven Jesuit tot Antwerpen</span> (1649).<br>
<br>Wadding continued to work at Louvain until 1629 when he was transferred to Prague. There he became chancellor of the Fernandean Academy, a university newly founded by the Jesuits next to the old Karl or Caroline University. His position involved him in disputes with the archbishop of Prague and the Franciscans concerning the authority of conferring degrees and the relations between the two universities. The correspondence between the cousins Luke and Peter Wadding illustrates the resulting conflict between Irish Jesuits and Franciscans. While at Prague, Peter Wadding wrote, besides several minor treatises, <span class="italic">Tractatus de incarnatione</span>, a solid theological work of more than 600 pages. It was published at Antwerp in 1636.<br>
<br>In 1641 the general of the society decided to move Wadding in view of controversies relating to the university chancellorship. In July 1641 he left for Graz, where he also became chancellor of the university and the first professor of canon law. He died there on 13 September 1644.<br>
