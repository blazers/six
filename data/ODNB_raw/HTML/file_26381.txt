<span class="headword">Stephens,  Edward Bowring</span>  (1815&#150;1882), <span class="occ">sculptor</span>, was born at Exeter, Devon, on 10 December 1815, the son of James Stephens (1777&#150;1849), a statuary mason. His artistic training began under the guidance of John Gendall, a local draughtsman and landscape painter, but in 1835 he went to London and became a pupil of the sculptor Edward Hodges Baily. In 1836 he won a silver medal from the Society of Arts for a model of a figure and in that year became a student at the Royal Academy Schools. His earliest exhibited works there were three ideal subjects and a bust (all 1838). These were followed in 1839 by <span class="italic">Diana</span> and another bust. That year he went to Italy and worked for some time in Rome, returning nearly three years later to Exeter, where he executed a life-size statue in marble of Lord Rolle. He returned to London in 1842, and in 1843 was awarded the gold medal of the Royal Academy for a small relief titled <span class="italic">The Battle of the Centaurs and Lapithae</span>. On 24 July 1845 he married, in the parish church of Crediton, Devon, Jane Harris Emes (1814/15&#150;1888), daughter of James Emes, a serge manufacturer.<br>
<br>In 1846 Stephens carved a marble chimney-piece for Buckingham Palace. His two groups <span class="italic">Satan Vanquished</span> and <span class="italic">Satan Tempting Eve</span> attracted notice in the Great Exhibition of 1851. Apart from his busts, whose subjects included Lord Palmerston, Bishop Phillpotts, the earl of Devon, Earl Fortescue, and Viscount Ebrington, he contributed many groups and statues to the exhibitions of the Royal Academy, for example <span class="italic">Eve Contemplating Death</span> (1853), <span class="italic">The Angel</span> (1861), <span class="italic">The Earl of Lonsdale</span> (1863, mausoleum, Lowther Castle, Westmorland), <span class="italic">The Bathers</span> (1877), statuettes <span class="italic">Ophelia</span> and <span class="italic">Lady Godiva</span> (both 1879), and <span class="italic">Shielding the Helpless</span> (1882). He also exhibited at the British Institution from 1838 to 1853, and his <span class="italic">Preparing for the Chase</span> was shown at the Manchester Art Treasures Exhibition in 1857.<br>
<br>Besides these works in 1862 Stephens executed a colossal marble statue of Sir Thomas Dyke Acland, placed on Northernhay, Exeter. Exeter has further examples of his work including an imposing marble statue of Earl Fortescue in Castle Yard, a statue of the earl of Devon in Bedford Circus, and one of the prince consort (1870, Royal Albert Memorial Museum and Art Gallery). His bronze group <span class="italic">The Deerstalker</span>, exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1876, is generally regarded as his finest work. Purchased by public subscription, it was placed at the entrance to Northernhay in Exeter. He also produced public statues of Alfred the Great, for the Egyptian Hall of Mansion House, London; Alfred Rooker, for Guildhall Square, Plymouth, Devon; Sir John Cordy Burrows, for Brighton, Sussex; and a recumbent figure of Elizabeth, countess of Devon, for her monument in Powderham church, Devon. These were well received and greatly increased his reputation. In 1873 he executed the statues of Leonardo, Wren, and Reynolds on the fa&ccedil;ade of Burlington House, Piccadilly, London.<br>
<br>Stephens was elected an ARA in 1864, but it was generally believed that his election was due to his having been confused with Alfred Stevens, the sculptor of the Wellington monument in St Paul's Cathedral. He died at his home, 110 Buckingham Palace Road, London, on 10 November 1882, and was buried in Kensal Green cemetery. He was survived by his wife.<br>
