<span class="headword">Dale,  Benjamin James</span>  (1885&#150;1943), <span class="occ">composer</span>, was born on 17 July 1885 at 7 Hill Side, Upper Holloway, London, a son of Charles James Dale (<i>b</i>. 1842), potter, and his wife, Frances Anne Hallett. His father was an amateur musician who conducted the Finsbury Choral Association. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32694/', "Sir Henry Hallett Dale")</script>, the physiologist and pharmacologist, was his brother.<br>
<br>Dale attended the Stationers' Company's School, Hornsey, and Oakfield School, Crouch End. The fourteen-year-old made his d&eacute;but as a composer with the performance of his orchestral overture <span class="italic">Horatius</span>. At the Royal Academy of Music, where he enrolled in 1900 on the same day as Arnold Bax, he studied the piano and organ. Here Dale won several prizes, including the Sir Michael Costa composition prize and the Charles Mortimer prize in 1902, the Charles Lucas medal in 1903, and the Royal Academy of Music club prize and the Dove medal in 1905.<br>
<br>The piano sonata in D minor, one of Dale's most significant works, was begun in 1902 while he was still a student. Completed in 1905, it was an ambitious and virtuosic piece consisting of four substantial movements, lasting in total about forty-five minutes and covering sixty-two pages of printed music. As well as following a Lisztian model, it demonstrated the influences of Richard Wagner, Richard Strauss, and the Russian nationalists, composers to whom Frederick Corder, his teacher at the academy, introduced his pupils.<br>
<br>The Russian pianist Mark Hambourg had established an annual competition for a new piano work at the Royal Academy of Music. At the last minute Dale decided to submit his piano sonata, which was chosen in 1906 as the winner from sixty entries. Hambourg played only the variations, and his interpretation was not faithful to Dale's score. Dale refused to join him on stage, despite the rapturous reception, and he subsequently returned the prize. Dale's fellow students York Bowen (to whom he dedicated the sonata), Myra Hess, and Irene Scharrer subsequently performed the sonata in public recitals. The technical demands of Dale's sonata and its colossal length prevented it from getting firmly established in the repertory. The movements were sometimes performed separately, but the issue of the sonata on pianola roll in 1910, and its subsequent reissue in 1924, helped to bring the work to a wider public.<br>
<br>Dale is remembered also for his compositions for viola. Inspired by Lionel Tertis, he wrote his suite for viola and piano in 1906. The final two movements were orchestrated, with the &#145;Romance&#146; becoming one of the most frequently played pieces in Tertis's repertory because of its wonderful and memorable melodic line. Dale also wrote a <span class="italic">Phantasy</span> for viola and piano, and an <span class="italic">Introduction and Andante</span> for six violas for Tertis's pupils. In 1913 he completed a choral setting of Christina Rossetti's Christmas hymn &#145;Before the paling of the stars&#146;.<br>
<br>Before the First World War, Dale held several posts as organist in London, and he was appointed professor of harmony at the Royal Academy of Music in 1909. He was devoted to German and Norwegian culture, and admired the music of Grieg. A frequent visitor to Germany, he was on his way to the Bayreuth Festival in 1914 when war broke out. Along with many other musicians, Dale was interned in Ruhleben, Germany, where he continued to write music, now for camp entertainments. Towards the end of the war he broke his arm and was moved to the Netherlands.<br>
<br>Dale returned to England in 1918, but his health had suffered during internment, and he composed little until his return from an examining tour of Australia and New Zealand in 1919&#150;20. This tour prompted him to write a violin sonata in 1921&#150;2 and the festival anthem &#145;A Song of Praise&#146; in 1923. His last work, <span class="italic">The Flowing Tide</span>, was sketched in 1924, although not completed until 1943. Dale married former composition student Kathleen Richards (1895&#150;1984) in October 1921. A composer and musicologist, she was also a pianist, who broadcast frequently from 1927 to 1931. Following their divorce Dale married (Frieda Emma Auguste) Margit Kaspar of Munich in December 1936.<br>
<br>In later years Dale worked as a professor of composition and harmony at the Royal Academy of Music, and was appointed warden there in 1936. He continued to examine for the Associated Board of the Royal Schools of Music, and was one of the three musicians on the BBC's music advisory panel from 1936. His administrative and teaching roles left him little time to compose, and this, coupled with his hypercritical approach, meant that he produced few works. He had a precocious talent, and it is remarkable that a young student composer should have developed his own style so quickly, but the activity burnt him out. Dale wrote demanding and lengthy works, which were infrequently played. His musical style was an extension of the Romantic aesthetic, which fell out of favour after the First World War; he was strongly opposed to advanced contemporary trends.<br>
<br>During rehearsals in London on 30 July 1943 for <span class="italic">The Flowing Tide</span>, Dale collapsed with a heart attack, and he died on the way to St Mary Abbots Hospital, Kensington. Sixty years after his death he was still remembered as an understanding and inspiring teacher with a great sense of humour.<br>
