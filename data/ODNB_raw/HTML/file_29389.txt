<span class="headword">Wilcocks,  Joseph</span>  (1673&#150;1756), <span class="occ">bishop of Gloucester and dean of Westminster</span>, born on 19 December 1673 at Bristol, was the son of Joseph Wilcocks, a physician of Bristol. He entered Merchant Taylors' School in the City of London on 11 September 1684, and matriculated from St John's College, Oxford, on 25 February 1692. From 1692 to 1703 he held a demyship at Magdalen College, and from 1703 to 15 February 1722 a fellowship. He graduated BA on 31 October 1695, MA on 28 June 1698, and BD and DD on 16 May 1709. For a while from about 1709 he served as chaplain to the English factory and embassy at Lisbon, where his devoted ministry throughout an outbreak of smallpox earned widespread admiration. His wife, Jane (<i>d</i>. 1725), was the daughter of John Milner, the British consul at Lisbon. On his return to England, Wilcocks was appointed chaplain-in-ordinary to George I and preceptor to the daughters of the prince of Wales. On 11 March 1721 he was installed a prebendary of Westminster, and on 3 December 1721 he was consecrated bishop of Gloucester, holding his stall <i>in commendam</i>.<br>
<br>Over the next few years Wilcocks published several sermons, which reflected his enthusiasm for the Hanoverian succession and his keen interest in the work of the Society for the Reformation of Manners and the charity school movement. On 21 June 1731 he was installed dean of Westminster, and on the same day was nominated bishop of Rochester. He was a conscientious diocesan, who steadily refused further promotion, declining even the archbishopric of York. At Westminster he devoted himself to completing the restoration of the abbey and to finishing the building of Sir Christopher Wren's two west towers. He died on 28 February 1756, at Westminster and was buried on 9 March in Westminster Abbey under the consistory court, where his son erected a monument to his memory in 1761.<br>
<br>Wilcocks's only son, <a name="cosubject_29389"></a><span class="headword">Joseph Wilcocks</span>  (1724&#150;1791), <span class="occ">antiquary and philanthropist</span>, was born in Dean's Yard, Westminster, on 4 January 1724. He was admitted to Westminster School in 1731, becoming a king's scholar in 1736. He was elected to Christ Church, Oxford, in 1740, matriculating on 10 June and graduating BA in 1744 and MA in 1747. He was scholarly by nature, winning several college prizes, and after leaving Oxford he undertook serious antiquarian work in Italy. &#145;An account of some subterraneous apartments, with Etruscan inscriptions, discovered at Civita Turchino in Italy&#146; was published in <span class="italic">Philosophical Transactions</span> in 1763, and the posthumously published <span class="italic">Roman Conversations, or, A Short Description of the Antiquities of Rome</span> (2 vols., 1792), which contains many biographical details of himself and of his father, reflected his extensive knowledge of Roman history and archaeology. He was elected FSA in 1765. His considerable wealth, which was supplemented by the bequest of an aunt's lottery winnings, was largely devoted to works of piety and benevolence. During his time in Rome, Pope Clement XIII was said to have referred to him as &#145;the blessed heretick&#146;  (Bickerstaffe, xli), and he was noted for support of several hospitals and his kindness to the poor and to the animal creation. He lived for some time in Barton, Northamptonshire. His friends included Edmund Burke, Benjamin West, Granville Sharp, and Adolphus Kempenfelt, in whose estate at Hurley, Berkshire, Wilcocks had a life interest; he never married. He died of an apoplectic stroke at The Crown inn, Slough, on 23 December 1791, and was buried in Westminster Abbey on 31 December, in his father's vault.<br>
