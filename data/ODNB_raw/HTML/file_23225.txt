<span class="headword">Reade,  Edward Anderdon</span>  (1807&#150;1886), <span class="occ">administrator in India</span>, born at Ipsden, Oxfordshire, on 15 March 1807, was the fifth son of John Reade of Ipsden and his wife, Anna Maria, daughter of Major Scott-Waring, MP for Stockbridge. His youngest brother was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/23224/', "Charles Reade (1814&#150;1884)")</script>, the novelist. His four elder brothers, like himself, joined the East India Company's service. The eldest, John Thurlow (1797&#150;1827), went to Bengal in 1816, and, attached to the revenue department, helped to frame the famous regulation VII of 1822, the basis of the periodical revision of land revenue settlements in the North-Western Provinces. He died in 1827, shortly after his appointment as the magistrate of Saharanpur.<br>
<br>Educated at the prebendary school at Chichester, Edward was nominated in 1823 to a writership in the East India Company's service, and studied at the East India College, Haileybury, where he distinguished himself as a linguist. Initially delayed by ill health, in June 1829 he was made assistant to the magistrate and collector of Gorakhpur district. Promotion and transfer to Cawnpore followed in 1832, where, to the government's satisfaction, he introduced the cultivation of the opium poppy to the district. In 1835 he returned to Gorakhpur as the magistrate and in 1841 completed the settlement of that district. In 1846 he was made commissioner of the Benares division, a post which he held until his further promotion in 1853 to the Sudder board of revenue, based in Agra.<br>
<br>Wherever he served, Reade cultivated good relations with the local gentry and respected their social pretensions. In the 1830s and 1840s such an affinity with the propertied classes was out of step with the revenue policy of the government of the North-Western Provinces, which aimed to circumvent landlord interests and make settlements directly with the peasant cultivators. After the 1857 uprising, however, Reade's inclination to patronize &#145;respectable native gentlemen&#146; became the norm for a government chastened by the social upheaval its policies had apparently unleashed. He was in many ways the archetypal district officer: self-sufficient, plain-speaking, and somewhat opinionated. He privileged local knowledge far above provincial perspectives and often criticized his seniors for the abstraction of their political designs. He prided himself on his refusal to mystify Indian traditions as inscrutably exotic, disparaging as &#145;nervous&#146; or &#145;excitable&#146; those of his fellow officers who did.<br>
<br>At the outbreak of the uprising in 1857 Reade was in Agra as the senior member of the board of revenue, with John Russell Colvin as the lieutenant-governor of the North-Western Provinces. Reade knew Colvin well and considered him a timid man; his administration during the crisis, Reade thought, swung perilously between battle-shyness and imprudent bravado. Unlike Colvin, Reade did not fear widespread rebellion around Agra and he was confident that local merchants and landlords would side openly with the British if only given sufficient encouragement. He was furious, therefore, when Colvin ordered a forced loan from the city's bankers, which ruptured his own delicate negotiations with them for a voluntary loan, and he fumed at the siege mentality of the local military authorities, which, in early July 1857, saw European soldiers holed up in the Agra Fort while straggling bands of mutineers plundered the European station at will. He broke openly with Colvin over the fate of the government's papers and against his orders personally arranged for the conveyance of the huge bulk of the revenue records to the safety of the fort&#151;an act of foresight which later won him favourable mention in a dispatch to the secretary of state. Colvin died on 9 September, whereupon Reade took temporary charge of the government and grasped the opportunity to curb the European instinct for indiscriminate revenge with relief. In May 1858 Lord Canning appointed him as one of the special commissioners to try rebels because, as Reade himself put it, the &#145;Sudder Judges &hellip; passed sentences of death so continually&#146;. He repeatedly urged on government the loyalty of the propertied classes and subsequently received grateful testimonials from the bankers and merchants of several towns.<br>
<br>Reade's last official act at Agra was to read the proclamation transferring the government of India from the East India Company to the crown. In April 1860 he retired and returned to his ancestral home in Oxfordshire. He was made a Companion of the Bath and a magistrate for Oxfordshire and Berkshire. For twenty years he was chairman of the county bench at Wallingford. In retirement his appreciation of locality, always in evidence in India, flourished. He presented the Bodleian Library with several essays on local topography, along with court rolls, deeds, and copiously annotated transcripts of the Ipsden parish registers. He maintained an affectionate correspondence with the maharaja of Benares, Ishri Prasad Narayan Singh, who had looked upon Reade as a friend and adviser since his days as the commissioner of Benares. In 1863 the maharaja established a public well for the villagers of Stoke Row, a hamlet on the upper portion of the Ipsden estate. In charge of the well's construction, Reade was wryly amused that an Indian prince should thus give a lesson in charity to the English gentry.<br>
<br>Reade had married on 7 April 1838 Eliza, the youngest daughter of Richard Nossiter Burnard of Crewkerne and Colyford in Somerset. Five of their ten children survived him. He died at his home, Well Place House, Ipsden, on 12 February 1886, and was buried in Ipsden churchyard.<br>
