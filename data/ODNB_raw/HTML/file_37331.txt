<span class="headword">Cumming, Sir  Mansfield George  Smith</span>  (1859&#150;1923), <span class="occ">intelligence officer</span>, was born Mansfield George Smith on 1 April 1859 in India, the youngest in the family of five sons and eight daughters of Colonel John Thomas Smith (1805&#150;1882) of the Royal Engineers, of F&ouml;ellalt House, Kent, and his wife, Maria Sarah Tyser. After entering the training ship <i>Britannia</i> at the age of thirteen, he began his career afloat as acting sub-lieutenant on HMS <i>Bellerophon</i>. He served in operations against Malay pirates during 1875&#150;6 and in Egypt in 1883. He suffered, however, from severe seasickness and in 1885 he was placed on the retired list.<br>
<br>Cumming (he changed his name in 1889 after marriage) spent the early 1890s largely as a country gentleman on his second wife's Moray estate. In 1898, while still on the Royal Navy retired list, he was posted to Nelson's old flagship <i>Victory</i> &#145;for special service at Southampton&#146;. The &#145;special service&#146; included occasional intelligence work abroad, but his main work for the next decade was the construction and command of the Southampton boom defences.<br>
<br>In 1909 Cumming was appointed head of what became the foreign section of the Secret Service Bureau (the forerunner of the Secret Intelligence Service, better known as SIS or MI6). He described pre-1914 espionage as &#145;capital sport&#146;, but was given few resources with which to pursue it. His early operations were directed almost entirely against Germany. Between 1909 and 1914 he recruited part-time &#145;casual agents&#146; in the shipping and arms business to keep track of naval construction in German shipyards and acquire other technical intelligence. He also had agents collecting German intelligence in Brussels, Rotterdam, and St Petersburg.<br>
<br>With the outbreak of the First World War, Cumming's control of strategic intelligence gathering as head of the wartime MI1c was challenged by two rival networks run by general headquarters. Cumming eventually out-performed his rivals. His most important wartime network, &#145;La Dame Blanche&#146;, had by January 1918 over 400 agents reporting on German troop movements from occupied Belgium and northern France. Cumming was less successful in post-revolutionary Russia. Despite a series of colourful exploits, his agents obtained little Russian intelligence of value.<br>
<br>Like the rest of the British intelligence community, the post-war SIS was drastically cut back. Cumming succeeded, however, in gaining a monopoly of espionage and counter-intelligence outside Britain and the empire. He also established a network of SIS station commanders operating overseas under diplomatic cover. To the end of his life Cumming retained an infectious, if sometimes eccentric, enthusiasm for the tradecraft and mystification of espionage, experimenting personally with disguises, mechanical gadgets, and secret inks in his own laboratory. His practice of writing exclusively in a distinctive green ink was continued by his successors. He was appointed CB in 1914 and KCMG in 1919.<br>
<br>Cumming had a fascination with most forms of transport, driving his Rolls at high speed around the streets of London. In his early fifties he took up flying, gaining both French aviators' and Royal Aero Club certificates. But his main passion was boating in Southampton Water and other waters calmer than those which had ended his active service career. In addition to owning &#145;any number&#146; of yachts, Cumming acquired six motor boats. In 1905 he became one of the founders and first rear-commodore of the Royal Motor Yacht Club.<br>
<br>In 1885 Cumming married Dora, daughter of Henry Cloete of Great Constantia, Cape Colony. After her death he married, on 13 March 1889, a Scottish heiress, Leslie Marian (May), daughter of Captain Lockhart Muir Valiant (afterwards Cumming), of the 1st Bombay lancers and Logie, Moray. As part of the marriage settlement he changed his surname to Smith-Cumming, later becoming known as Cumming. Their only son, Alastair, a dangerous driver like his father, was killed in October 1914, driving Cumming's Rolls in France. Cumming himself lost the lower part of his right leg in the same accident. He died suddenly at his home, 1 Melbury Road, Kensington, London, on 14 June 1923, shortly before he was due to retire.<br>
