</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Don, Sir  George</span>  (1756&#150;1832), <span class="occ">army officer and colonial governor</span>, was born in Edinburgh on 30 April 1756, the second of the three sons of John Don, a wine merchant, and his wife Ann Seton or Seaton. He entered the army as an ensign of the 51st regiment on 26 December 1770 and was promoted lieutenant in June 1774, after he had joined his regiment at Minorca. His qualities attracted the notice of General Johnstone, the lieutenant-governor and commander-in-chief, who took him on his staff as aide-de-camp, and he served General James Murray, Johnstone's successor, in the same post. General Murray also made him his military secretary. At this time he met General Murray's niece Maria Margaretta Murray (<i>c</i>.1760&#150;1854), an illegitimate daughter of Patrick Murray, fifth Lord Elibank, and married her on his return to Britain in 1782.<br>
<br>Don was chief of the staff during the gallant but unavailing defence of Fort St Philip (1781&#150;2) and was sent to London with his report on the siege by Murray, who commended him highly. In November 1783 he received a brevet majority and in April 1784 a substantive majority in the 59th regiment, which he joined in Gibraltar; he purchased the lieutenant-colonelcy in April 1789. He left Gibraltar in 1791 to take up a staff appointment in England. In 1792&#150;3 he was with his regiment in Jersey. He was deputy adjutant-general to Sir James Murray (later Murray-Pulteney) in the duke of York's army in the Netherlands in 1793, and for his services was made aide-de-camp to the king and promoted colonel in February 1795.<br>
<br>Don remained on the continent after the departure of the army, as military commissioner with the Prussian army. He appears to have been engaged in co-ordinating espionage activities at this time. He was promoted major-general on 1 January 1798 and appointed to command the troops in the Isle of Wight. In 1799 he joined the duke of York's unsuccessful expedition to The Helder, commanding the 3rd division under Sir David Dundas. He was captured and imprisoned by the French while carrying messages to General Brune, who accused him of carrying documents intended to subvert the Batavians, and was not released until June 1800. While in captivity he succeeded Sir John Moore as colonel of the 9th West India regiment. There seems to be no evidence for the statement in the <span class="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</span> that on his return he rejoined the staff of the Horse Guards as assistant adjutant-general. In 1802 he was in Scotland, where he was in command of the south-east, organizing a large force of militiamen against a possible invasion. He was promoted lieutenant-general in 1803. When the war with France resumed, Don returned to London to organize and command the newly formed King's German Legion, which consisted mainly of Hanoverians. With this corps and other troops, amounting in all to 14,000 men, he sailed for Germany in 1805 on a diplomatic and military mission, in which he was later superseded by Lord Cathcart.<br>
<br>On 20 October 1805 Don became colonel of the 96th regiment and in 1806 he was appointed lieutenant-governor of Jersey, where he commanded until 1814; however, he was absent in 1809&#150;10, when he was sent to Walcheren in order to command and supervise the withdrawal of the forces engaged in that disastrous expedition. He kept Jersey in a good state of defence, improving fortifications, building roads, and reorganizing the militia, and won the trust of the inhabitants. He was promoted general in June 1814 and appointed lieutenant-governor of Gibraltar, where he arrived in October 1814 during an epidemic of yellow fever. Recollecting the terrible toll taken by disease in the enclosed communities of Fort St Philip and Walcheren, Don improved sanitation and the water supply, built a hospital for the civilian inhabitants, and created a public park, the Alameda. The sanitary police which he established evolved in 1830 into the first British police force outside the United Kingdom. He also built Gibraltar's court house, and the charter which established Gibraltar as a crown colony was published during his term of office (1830). He repaired and completed defences which had been in disrepair since the great siege (1779&#150;83) and built roads in Gibraltar and neighbouring parts of Spain. He was made GCH in 1816 and GCB in 1820, and received the grand cross of military merit of France in 1817 for services to the French royal family. He was appointed colonel of the 36th regiment in 1818 and transferred to the 3rd regiment (the Buffs) in 1829. In 1831 he retired as lieutenant-governor of Gibraltar and was made governor of Scarborough Castle. He died in Gibraltar of influenza on 1 January 1832 and was buried on 4 January with full military honours in the new garrison church in Gibraltar (later the cathedral of the Holy Trinity), which he had built.<br>
