</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Stanley,  Thomas</span>  (1625&#150;1678), <span class="occ">poet and classical scholar</span>, was born in September 1625 in Cumberlow Green, Hertfordshire, the eldest son of Sir Thomas Stanley and his second wife, Mary, daughter of Sir William Hammond, of St Alban's Court, Nonnington, Kent. Through his mother he was cousin to the poet Richard Lovelace and nephew to the poet <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/12163/', "William Hammond")</script>, to both of whom he paid tribute in his verse &#145;Register of Friends&#146;. At the house of his father, a substantial landowner in Hertfordshire, Stanley was tutored from an early age by William Fairfax, son of Edward Fairfax, the translator of Tasso, who remained his mentor and friend for many years, providing the groundwork for Stanley's later career as classical scholar and translator.<br>
<br>In June 1639, at thirteen, Stanley entered Pembroke College, Cambridge, his uncle's college, matriculating on 13 December; he proceeded MA in March 1642. Stanley remained in residence in Cambridge until 1643, with brief intervals at Oxford and a trip to Durham in 1641 in Hammond's company, where he met and befriended the precocious &#145;early blossom of the wondring North&#146;, the poet John Hall (Hall was then fourteen and Stanley sixteen). At the outbreak of the civil war, distressed at &#145;the fury of unruly Times&#146;, Stanley left England for the continent, returning &#145;from his Travells in France&#146; in 1646  (<span class="italic">Poems and Translations</span>, 356). He then took up residence in the Middle Temple, living in chambers adjacent to those of his kinsman Edward Sherburne, with whom, united by &#145;the double Ty of Sympathy and Blood&#146;, he &#145;entred into a near Communication of Friendship and Studies&#146;  (ibid., xxv, 363). It is likely that Stanley provided financial assistance to some of his fellow royalist poets at this time and afterwards: the dramatist James Shirley, another close friend of this period, acknowledged his generosity as patron at a time of &#145;poverty&#146;, as did Hall  (Bentley, 220&#150;21).<br>
<br>Like his friends Sherburne and Lovelace (and unlike Hall, who wrote pamphlets urging submission to the <i>de facto</i> power of the Commonwealth), Stanley was an ardent royalist. In 1646 he founded an order of the Black Riband, in which sympathizers of the king in his distress indicated their continued loyalty by a symbolic ribbon of mourning worn on the arm. <span class="italic">Psalterium Carolinum: the Devotions of his Sacred Majestie in his Solitudes and Sufferings</span> (1657) is Stanley's verse paraphrase of Charles I's <span class="italic">Eikon basilike</span>, with a musical setting by John Wilson. The 1660 reissue includes a dedication to Charles II, describing the work as motivated by &#145;a pious Duty to the sacred memory&#146; of the martyred king. Stanley's name does not appear in the 1657 edition, and though the &#145;Register of Friends&#146; treats the civil war period as &#145;barbarous Times&#146; of &#145;servitude&#146;, this poem was written long after the Restoration and remained unpublished until after Stanley's death.<br>
<br>On 8 May 1648 Stanley married Dorothy Enyon, eldest daughter of the late Sir John Enyon of Flower (Floore), Northamptonshire, and his widow, Lady Jane Enyon. His friends Shirley, Sherburne, Hammond, and Fairfax wrote epithalamia celebrating the wedding, as did Lovelace in an &#145;Anniversary&#146; in the following year. Stanley had nine children, the eldest of whom, Thomas Stanley the younger (<i>b</i>. 1650), was admitted to Pembroke College, Cambridge, in 1665, and published a translation, <span class="italic">Claudius &AElig;lianus his Various Histories</span>, in the same year.<h2>
<a name="PoemsandTranslations"></a>Poems and Translations</h2>Stanley's <span class="italic">Poems and Translations</span> was published in 1647, when the poet was twenty-two; the title-page states that the volume was &#145;Printed for the Author, and his friends&#146;. According to the editor of the 1743 edition of Stanley's <span class="italic">History of Philosophy</span>, the &#145;Madrigal Poems and other Pieces &hellip; together with some Translations out of the <i>French, Italian</i>, and <i>Spanish</i>&#146; in the 1647 collection were largely written at Cambridge, before Stanley set out on his travels (CUL, MS Add. 7514 shows that Stanley revised the poems extensively in 1646 and 1647). Bibliographically, <span class="italic">Poems and Translations</span> is a complex volume, since it consists of several distinct sections, with separate title-pages, signatures, and pagination, which are bound together in the British Library copy and several other extant copies. As originally conceived, the volume seems to have consisted of two parts, each separately paginated: poems (sixty-two love lyrics, all highly conventional, with titles such as &#145;Love Deposed&#146; and &#145;Speaking and Kissing&#146;) and a series of extended translations from the Greek and Latin: &#145;Europa&#146;, &#145;Cupid Crucified&#146;, and &#145;Pervigilium Veneris&#146;, with the Greek or Latin text on pages facing the translations and a Latin commentary appended. Yet even among the ostensibly original poems, a large proportion are imitations or translations: Praz points out close parallels with Marino, Tasso, Lope de Vega, and other poets  (Praz, 280&#150;88). Commendatory poems described the volume as &#145;forraign wealth transferr'd&#146; and &#145;improv'd&#146;, praising Stanley's learning which<blockquote>
<div class="indent">extends through all<br>
</div>
<div>Languages which we <i>Europaean</i> call.<br>
</div> (<span class="italic">Poems and Translations</span>, sig. A2, A3<i>v</i>)</blockquote>
<span class="italic">Europa</span> and its two companion poems were reissued by Humphrey Moseley as a separate publication in 1649, and Moseley is also identified as publisher in 1647 (2nd edn, 1650) of two further translations by Stanley: <span class="italic">Aurora</span>, from a prose romance by the Spanish author Montalvan, and <span class="italic">Oronta the Cyprian Virgin</span>, from a poem by the Italian author Preti.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">Poems, by Thomas Stanley Esquire</span> (1651) is a thoroughly revised and expanded version of the first part of <span class="italic">Poems and Translations</span> (1647). It includes forty-two lyric poems from the earlier collection (omitting twenty) and adds twenty-one new poems, each of which explicitly indicates a source: &#145;To his Mistress in Absence. Tasso&#146;; &#145;The Sick Lover. Guarini&#146;; &#145;The Enjoyment. St. Amant&#146;. As with the 1647 collection, there is a second volume of translations, largely from the Greek and Latin, separately paginated (260 pages, where the <span class="italic">Poems</span> volume has only 86 pages). The title-page, with no general title, lists the authors and poems translated: &#145;Anacreon. Bion. Moschus. <span class="roman">Kisses</span>, by Secundus. <span class="roman">Cupid Crucified</span>, by Ausonius. <span class="roman">Venus Vigils</span>&#146;. Later in the volume there are separate title-pages for the &#145;excitations&#146; or notes on these poets, for a separate section of translations from the French, Spanish, and Italian (four new poems and two from earlier editions), and finally, for a prose translation from Pico della Mirandola, <span class="italic">A Platonick Discourse upon Love</span>. In several extant copies, the prose translation <span class="italic">Aurora</span>, with separate pagination and signatures, is bound with the two volumes of verse poems and translations, but it is unlikely that this third volume (with a title-page dated 1650 and listing Moseley as publisher) was &#145;ever intended to form part of&#146; the 1651 collection  (<span class="italic">Poems and Translations</span>, l&#150;li). <span class="italic">Poems, by Thomas Stanley Esquire</span> (1652), listing Moseley as publisher, is made up of sheets of the 1651 edition with a new title-page; Moseley also advertised &#145;Poems and translations, the compleat workes of <i>Thomas Stanley</i> Esquire, 1653&#146;, in a bookseller's catalogue, but no copy dated 1653 is extant.<br>
<br>The 1651 volume of verse translations includes the first complete English translation of the <span class="italic">Anacreontea</span>. This translation, in tetrameter couplets, was published at a time when the poems attributed to Anacreon, with their refined hedonism, were particularly influential among Stanley's fellow Caroline poets; &#145;in an era that was not outwardly congenial to their kind of poetry&#146;, such poems could be taken to have &#145;definite royalist subtexts&#146;  (Revard, &#145;Stanley&#146;, 160, 171). Stanley's translation of the <span class="italic">Anacreontea</span> remained the standard English version for some time thereafter, as did his version of the <span class="italic">Basia</span> of the neo-Latin poet Johannes Secundus. In translating Secundus, Stanley omits the five most openly erotic poems in the sequence and thus &#145;has subtly altered the character of the <span class="italic">Basia</span>&#146; in ways consistent with his own love poems, described by Hall and others as &#145;chaste&#146;  (Revard, &#145;Secundus&#146;, 556&#150;7). Saintsbury, in his anthology <span class="italic">Minor Poets of the Caroline Period</span>, comments that in his translations Stanley &#145;has almost unerringly selected writers who are suitable to the poetical style of his own day, and has transposed them into English verse of that style&#146;  (Saintsbury, 3.98). The assessment of Crump, his modern editor, is that &#145;as a translator he was unmatched by any of his contemporaries, with the possible exception of Richard Crashaw&#146;, writing poems closely modelled on those by earlier poets which nevertheless &#145;attained the freedom and spontaneity of original expression&#146;  (<span class="italic">Poems and Translations</span>, xl).<br>
<br>In 1656 the composer John Gamble published <span class="italic">Ayres and Dialogues</span>, musical settings of lyric poems by Stanley. The collection contains eighty-seven songs, with accompaniment for the bass viol or lute, taken from the 1647 and 1651 volumes, as well as three poems by Stanley written before 1647 but not published earlier. <span class="italic">Ayres and Dialogues</span> includes thirteen poems from 1647 not included in 1651, fifteen poems from the translations of Anacreon, four from the translations of Secundus, and nearly all the lyric poems from 1651 (with texts generally agreeing with 1647 where the two earlier editions differ). In his preface Gamble apologizes that the poems had been &#145;so long with&#146; him, and variant readings suggest that for some of the songs he used unrevised drafts in his possession since 1646  (<span class="italic">Poems and Translations</span>, xxxii). Poems by Stanley were also set to music by Henry Lawes, Jeremy Savile, Henry Bowman, and John Roffey, appearing in various songbooks between 1653 and 1686, and by John Wilson, who also set <span class="italic">Psalterium Carolinum</span>.<h2>
<a name="HistoryofPhilosophyandAeschylus"></a>History of Philosophy and Aeschylus</h2>After 1648 Stanley's principal residence was Rushden Manor in Hertfordshire where, accompanied for the next five years by his kinsman and fellow translator Sherburne, he devoted his time to scholarly pursuits. According to the 1701 &#145;Account&#146; of his life and writings, an &#145;Affection to Learning&#146; was his dominant characteristic: &#145;Neither his Cares nor Concerns for his Family, nor the Caresses and Endearments of a young Wife, could prevail with him to intermit his ordinary Studies, on which he was obstinately bent&#146;  (&#145;Account&#146;, sig. A2<i>v</i>). The first volume of his ambitious <span class="italic">History of Philosophy</span>&#151;the &#145;Life&#146; claims that &#145;Mr <i>Stanley</i> has outshone all that preceded him in the Extent of his Design, and the vast Multitude of Particulars he has amassed together&#146;  (ibid.)&#151;was published in folio by Humphrey Mosely and Thomas Dring in 1655. In its account of &#145;those on whom the Attribute of Wise was conferred&#146; in antiquity, with particular attention to Thales, Solon, and Socrates, the first volume established the pattern of &#145;Lives and Opinions&#146; followed in the later volumes. Volume 2, which included detailed accounts of the philosophical doctrines of Plato, Aristotle, and Stoicism, was published in 1656, and volume 3, which encompasses Pythagoras and the pre-Socratics, Scepticism, and a particularly detailed and sympathetic account of Epicureanism, appeared in 1660. In these three volumes Stanley sought to give a comprehensive account of the various schools of Greek philosophy, in as impartial a way as possible: &#145;there is due to every one the Commendation of their own Deserts&#146;, he writes in the dedication to volume 1. A fourth folio volume, <span class="italic">The History of the Chaldaick Philosophy</span> (evidently an afterthought, since the title-page of volume 3 describes it as &#145;the third and last volume&#146;), published in 1662, is briefer and more tentative in treating the occult learning of ancient Egypt, Babylonia, and Persia: &#145;there is not any thing more difficult to be retrieved out of the Ruins of Antiquity than the Learning of the Eastern Nations&#146;  (ibid., 756). Stanley's <span class="italic">History of Philosophy</span> was accepted as a standard authority for many years, republished in a single volume in 1687, 1701 (with an informative &#145;Life&#146;), and in 1743 (once more with the biography), and translated into French and Latin.<br>
<br>Stanley's next scholarly project, no less ambitious in scope, was an edition of the plays of Aeschylus. The edition, published in folio in 1663, contains a complete Greek text (seven plays and fragments), a Latin translation of each play, and detailed notes, textual and explanatory, in Latin. Stanley devoted nearly ten years to this edition, which has been described as &#145;the first substantial contribution made by English scholarship to the study of Greek poetry&#146; and &#145;one of the most influential editions&#146; of any Greek author, superior to any previous editions of Aeschylus  (Fraenkel, 40&#150;41). In its early stages Stanley had the assistance of the classical scholar John Pearson, later bishop of Chester, whose detailed annotations of Stanley's copy of a 1557 edition of Aeschylus formed the basis of many of Stanley's notes and textual emendations. As well as seeking to establish a reliable text, Stanley is primarily concerned with providing in his edition &#145;a full and scholarly illustration of the plays&#146;  (ibid., 40, 43). Stanley continued working on Aeschylus after the publication of his edition, and eight volumes of detailed notes, presumably intended for a second, revised edition, are extant (CUL, MS Gg.iii.7&#150;14). Stanley's Aeschylus remained the standard edition for many years, and when the Revd Samuel Butler published a revised and enlarged edition, based on that of Stanley, in 1809&#150;16, he eulogized him in the following terms:<blockquote>Stanley was the greatest scholar of his age in this country, the greatest ornament to the University of Cambridge; he was a liberal, a candid and an upright scholar, yet wholly free from vanity, from envy, and from self-importance. I venerate the memory of such a man. (Flower, 143)</blockquote>In addition to his notes on Aeschylus, there are a number of other manuscripts by Stanley which attest to his scholarly interests, indicating projects for further publications which, perhaps for reasons of ill health, never came to fruition. He was particularly interested in the poet Callimachus (his annotated copy of a 1577 edition of Callimachus is in the British Library, and two further volumes of notes in Cambridge University Library), and may also have planned an edition of the plays of Euripides  (Flower, 143, 169&#150;70). A volume of Adversaria or notes, primarily textual, on Sophocles, Euripides, Theocritus, Juvenal, Persius, Theophrastus, and other Greek and Latin authors is in Cambridge University Library, along with a second large volume containing notes on Demosthenes, a translation of Sophocles' <span class="italic">Philoctetes</span>, with notes on the play, and a lengthy treatise (over 100 pages) on St Paul's <span class="roman">Epistle to the Hebrews</span>. Stanley was elected to the Royal Society in 1661 and became a fellow in 1663, remaining active in the Royal Society at least until 1670.<h2>
<a name="Finalyears"></a>Final years</h2>Stanley was a generous patron to poets and translators during the 1650s and the 1660s: one of many volumes dedicated to him speaks of him as &#145;the true Lover of all good Learning&#146;  (Flower, 142). He seems to have been in straitened circumstances in the late 1650s, partly as a result of inheriting the debts of his royalist father-in-law, and after the Restoration he petitioned the king several times for redress, with the last appeal in 1663 being successful. His principal residence in his later years continued to be Rushden Manor in Hertfordshire, though he seems also to have maintained a London residence. From the mid-1660s to his death in 1678 he suffered from poor health, and may have been diabetic. The dedication to <span class="italic">Scarron's Novels &hellip; Rendered into English</span> (1665) by John Davies of Kidwelly, a recipient of Stanley's patronage, refers to &#145;a general report of your death&#146; that year after a serious illness. Letters by John Hall suggest that even in the 1640s Stanley's health was not good, and there are several references to illness in letters by and to Stanley during his later years, as well as a poem by one of his friends praising the doctor who has given &#145;Balsome to Stanleys Life&#146;  (<span class="italic">Poems and Translations</span>, xxxiii). He died on 12 April 1678, in Suffolk Street, Strand, his London residence, and was buried at St Martin-in-the-Fields. He was survived by his wife. The 1743 &#145;Life&#146; speaks of him as &#145;a Gentleman of a comely Aspect, and exceeded by none of his Time for Modesty, Candour, and Learning&#146;  (&#145;Account&#146;, sig. b2<i>v</i>).<br>
