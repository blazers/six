<span class="headword">Colvill <span class="st"> [Colville]</span>,  Alexander</span>  (1699/1700&#150;1777), <span class="occ">non-subscribing Presbyterian minister</span>, was probably born at Newtownards, co. Down, where his father, Alexander Colville (<i>d</i>. 1719), was ordained minister on 26 July 1696. He originally spelt his name Colville but changed it to Colvill about 1715. He graduated MA from Edinburgh University in 1715 and studied medicine at Glasgow University; he graduated MD from Edinburgh in 1728. His father, who in 1700 became minister at Dromore, co. Down, was an early member of the Belfast Society and successfully introduced New Light ideas to the congregation. When he died, on 1 December 1719, the Dromore congregation wanted Colvill to succeed as minister and delayed filling the post until he was qualified. He duly studied theology at Edinburgh, under William Dunlop, and after briefly working as tutor in the family of Major Hay of Parbroath he was licensed by the Cupar-Fife presbytery on 19 June 1722. Called to Dromore, he was refused ordination in 1724 by the Armagh presbytery, because he refused to renew his subscription to the Westminster confession. He appealed to the sub-synod and then to the general synod but finally resorted to going to England, where in December 1724 he was ordained in Edmund Calamy's vestry by Joshua Oldfield, leader of the London non-subscribers.<br>
<br>On his return to Ireland the Armagh presbytery refused to receive Colvill. He appealed to general synod, which in June 1725 suspended him from ministerial duties for three months and sent a replacement minister to Dromore, despite threats from Calamy to withdraw the <i>regium donum</i>. Colvill had earlier, on 29 March 1725, applied for admission to the non-subscribing presbytery of Dublin and was duly installed at Dromore on 25 October 1725. The subscribers in the Dromore congregation immediately called a new minister, who was ordained in May 1726, but the majority (over 400 heads of families) adhered to Colvill. In 1730 he and his congregation transferred themselves to the non-subscribing presbytery of Antrim, which had been expelled from the synod in 1726. A new meeting-house was built for him on Pound Hill, Dromore. On the outbreak of the Jacobite rising of 1745 Colvill obtained from Lord Chesterfield a commission for raising a volunteer corps, which he himself commanded. He published only a few works; the first was the sermon that he preached at the funeral of fellow non-subscriber Thomas Nevin of Downpatrick, on 24 March 1745. In 1749 he attacked the seceding ministers from Scotland who were seeking to recruit new adherents from Ulster congregations in a pamphlet entitled <span class="italic">The Persecuting, Disloyal, and Absurd Tenets of those who Affect to Call themselves Seceders</span>, in which he accused them of antinomianism. He returned to the subscription controversy in his final work, <span class="italic">Some Important Queries</span> (1773), defending John Cameron against the criticisms of Benjamin McDowell. Some years earlier, in 1759, Colvill had led a delegation of non-subscribers to propose reconciliation to the general synod, and a dialogue between the two was resumed in 1768 when Cameron was moderator of the general synod.<br>
<br>According to his will (dated 3 October 1772) Colvill had a son, Maturin, and five daughters, two of whom married. He died, of apoplexy, at Dromore on 23 April 1777, aged seventy-seven, and was buried there on 4 May. His funeral sermon, &#145;On the immortality of the soul&#146;, was preached by James Bryson, who eulogized his &#145;rich, clear, and comprehensive understanding&#146;  (Bryson, 154). His congregation returned to the general synod after his death but left it with the remonstrants of 1829.<br>
