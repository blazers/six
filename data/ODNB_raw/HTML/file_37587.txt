<span class="headword">Inge, Sir  William</span>  (<em>c.</em>1260&#150;1322), <span class="occ">lawyer and justice</span>, was probably born in or before 1260 at or near Dunstable, Bedfordshire, the son of Thomas Inge of Dunstable, a minor local landowner active in local administration. Between 1281 and 1285 he acted as the attorney of a number of different litigants in the common bench and the exchequer, perhaps while studying law as an apprentice of the king's court. He was retained by the king as one of his serjeants between 1287 and 1293, and is to be found acting for him on the Gloucestershire eyre of 1287 and on the northern circuit eyres of 1292&#150;3, as well as in the common bench and in the exchequer. Surviving reports show that he also acted for other litigants during the same period, both in the common bench and on eyres. In 1293 he became a regular assize justice but continued to act for private clients in the common bench until the court moved to York in 1298. By 5 April 1300 he had been knighted.<br>
<br>In 1303 Inge accompanied Edward I to Scotland, and in 1305, and again in 1307, was appointed a justice of one of the trailbaston circuits. By 1303 he had also entered the service of the future Edward II, and become one of his closest and most trusted advisers. In 1305 it was only Edward's intervention that prevented him being appointed a justice in Scotland. Inge remained close to Edward II after his accession, being retained as part of the king's household, and in 1310&#150;11 he was sent to Gascony as one of the English commissioners at the Process of P&eacute;rigueux, which was intended to resolve Anglo-French differences. In Hilary term 1313 he was appointed a justice of the common bench and served in that capacity for just over three years.<br>
<br>When Roger Brabazon (<i>d</i>. 1317) retired from the chief justiceship of king's bench, Inge replaced him (at Easter term 1316). But serious allegations had already been made against him by this date. It was claimed that he had purchased the Surrey manor of Woodmansterne from its tenant while litigation about the manor was pending in the common bench before him and his colleagues. This allegation seems never to have been proved, but, in connected proceedings brought against the sheriff of Surrey, a jury found that Inge had borrowed the plaintiff's original writ from the sheriff and tampered with it. Inge was not himself a party to the latter proceedings, and the verdict came only after his dismissal from the chief justiceship (in June 1317), but it seems probable that the dismissal was connected with these charges. Inge took no further part in public life.<br>
<br>Inge's first wife, Margery (1277&#150;1310/11) (whom he married between 1298 and 1300), was one of four daughters and coheirs of Henry Grapinel, a landowner in Essex and Sussex. His second wife, Isolda (whom he married between November 1311 and March 1312), was the widow of Urian de Sancto Petro. His only surviving child at the time of his death was Joan, the daughter of his first marriage, who had married Eon la Zouche. He died shortly before 10 May 1322.<br>
