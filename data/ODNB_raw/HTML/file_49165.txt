<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Lister,  Thomas</span>, fourth Baron Ribblesdale  (1854&#150;1925), <span class="occ">politician and huntsman</span>, was born at the H&ocirc;tel de France, Fontainebleau, on 29 October 1854, the eldest son of Thomas Lister, third Baron Ribblesdale (1828&#150;1876), and his wife, Emma (<i>d</i>. 1911), youngest daughter of Colonel William Mure of Caldwell, Ayrshire. His father had been a devotee of the turf, and in straitened circumstances had taken his young family to live in France. Ribblesdale later observed that a spell abroad was &#145;a method of reconstruction often adopted in those days by families and single gentlemen who had outrun the constable, or, in Burton's phrase, had galloped themselves out of their fortunes&#146;  (Lister, 22). Lister's formal education was, however, in England, where he attended a preparatory school, Winton House, in Winchester and Harrow School (1868&#150;72).<br>
<br>In 1873 Lister joined the army. Initially with the 64th regiment, he later transferred to the rifle brigade, from which he retired in 1886 with the rank of major. He succeeded his father, who committed suicide, in 1876, and took his seat in the Lords the following year, but seldom attended the house. He later confessed that army life induced in him political apathy. By the time that he was appointed a lord-in-waiting to the queen in 1880 he had &#145;lost, if not forgotten&#146; the whig principles that he had imbibed in youth from his stepgrandfather, Lord John Russell  (Lister, 155). Ribblesdale found life at the royal court agreeable without always being stimulating, and he was conscious of the peculiar atmosphere that prevailed. News came practically first-hand to Windsor, but &#145;at the Household dinner &hellip; it was seldom mentioned and never discussed&#146;  (ibid., 107). He left court in 1885, with the fall of the Liberal government, but returned in 1892 as master of the buckhounds. Gladstone's intimation that this office might lead to greater things spurred Ribblesdale to be more active on behalf of the government. He was its spokesman in the Lords on agriculture and, later, Ireland, and with the fall of the ministry in 1895 he became chief Liberal whip, continuing until 1911. This office proved to be the acme of his political career, but by his own admission it carried little influence.<br>
<br>It was riding, rather than politics, that dominated Ribblesdale's life. He had been successively a soldier, a courtier, and a politician, but was best known to his contemporaries as a great huntsman, and is best known to posterity as the subject of a great painting. John Singer Sargent's magnificent portrait of Ribblesdale (1902) captures the spirit of an age, as much as the image of one man. The subject's casual elegance exudes the confidence of the English aristocracy in its heyday before the First World War. He is depicted by Sargent wearing his favourite hunting clothes. These were not the dark green gala coat and white leathers of the master of the buckhounds: though more striking than the chosen mufti, this uniform would have been less apt. Ribblesdale's life was one of understated grandeur, and did not need the imprimatur of a uniform. An expert horseman, in 1897 he published a substantial history, <span class="italic">The Queen's Hounds</span>. His love of hunting was shared by his first wife, Charlotte (Charty) Monckton Tennant (1858&#150;1911), daughter of the industrialist <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36455/', "Sir Charles Tennant, first baronet")</script>, whom he married on 7 April 1877. She was one of the celebrated sisters who took London society by storm (the others being Laura Lyttelton, Lucy Graham Smith, and Margot Asquith) and formed the nucleus of the aristocratic set the Souls. She died after a three-year fight against tuberculosis in 1911. They had five children; both their sons died on active service&#151;the elder in Somaliland in 1904, the younger after the Gallipoli campaign in 1915. It was in their memory, as well as their mother's, that Ribblesdale gave his Sargent portrait to the National Gallery (of which he had been a trustee since 1909) in 1916. He spent his widowhood at Rosa Lewis's Cavendish Hotel, and in 1919 married an American, Ava, widow of John Jacob Astor and daughter of Edward Willing. He died at 18 Grosvenor Square, London, on 21 October 1925; his widow renounced her title and resumed her American citizenship. His autobiographical <span class="italic">Impressions and Memories</span>, both interesting and well written, was posthumously published in 1927, with an introduction by his eldest daughter.<br>
