<span class="headword">Laking, Sir  Guy Francis</span>, second baronet  (1875&#150;1919), <span class="occ">antiquary and museum curator</span>, was born on 21 October 1875 at 5 Cleveland Road, Westminster, London, the only son of Sir Francis Henry Laking, baronet (1847&#150;1914), physician-in-ordinary and surgeon apothecary to Queen Victoria and to her two successors on the throne, and physician to the royal household, and his first wife, Emma Ann Mansell (<i>d</i>. 1905).<br>
<br>Educated at Westminster School and Westminster School of Art, Laking very early developed an overwhelming interest in antiques and works of art, and, above all, in early arms and armour, and devoted most of his spare time to studying them. He often visited Christie's salerooms, only a short distance from his parents' home in Pall Mall, where he attracted the attention of one of the firm's partners, T. H. Woods, to whom he became a kind of unofficial apprentice. The association eventually led to his joining Christie's as art adviser, a position he continued to occupy for the rest of his life, despite being involved in many other activities. On 21 July 1898 he married Beatrice Ida, daughter of Charles Mylne Barker, a solicitor, with whom he had a son and a daughter.<br>
<br>Laking's father's royal appointments, and the location of the family residence, meant that, in Francis Sheppard's phrase, he was &#145;brought up almost literally within the shadow of royalty&#146;  (Sheppard, 46). There can be little doubt that the post at Christie's, with its all-embracing title, was created for him with an eye to the business that the firm hoped his royal and aristocratic connections might produce as much as in recognition of his expert knowledge. That he possessed the latter is, however, demonstrated by the quality of his first catalogue for Christie's (of the Zschille collection), produced at the beginning of 1897 when he was only just twenty-one, and by the speed with which he established thereafter a reputation as a leading expert on the decorative arts in general, and especially on medieval and later arms and armour.<br>
<br>In 1900 Laking was appointed honorary inspector of the armouries at the Wallace Collection&#151;recently bequeathed to the nation&#151;where he was already busy compiling a catalogue of the European pieces that went through four editions and two reprints between that year and 1910. Shortly afterwards he wrote a catalogue of the armoury of the knights of St John at Valletta (published in 1903), and in 1902 Edward VII created the post of keeper of the king's armoury at Windsor specially for him. This led to his producing a massive catalogue of its European pieces in 1904, followed in 1905 and 1907 respectively by catalogues of the furniture at Windsor Castle and of the S&egrave;vres porcelain both there and at Buckingham Palace. He had achieved all this by the time he was thirty-two, while also carrying on his work for Christie's together with related activities, leading an extremely active social life, and raising a family.<br>
<br>In 1911 Laking was made the first keeper and secretary of the London Museum (now part of the Museum of London), which was then little more than an idea. He has been described as the greatest holder of this office, and so far as its collections were concerned he was certainly the museum's founder, since he was responsible for forming them from scratch and arranging them in Lancaster House, its first home. His long-standing connections with the royal family, some of whom took a personal interest in the museum, as also with the art and antiques trade, were specially advantageous, and the opening to the public on 23 March 1914, towards which he worked with tireless energy, was immensely successful. On the death of his father in that year he became the second baronet.<br>
<br>While organizing the new museum, Laking was also involved in, among other things, gathering material for what was to be the other achievement for which he will be most remembered: his <i>magnum opus</i>, <span class="italic">A Record of European Armour and Arms through Seven Centuries</span> (5 vols., 1920&#150;22). It was unfinished at his death&#151;he lived only to see an advance copy of the first volume&#151;and was completed by his literary executor, F. H. Cripps-Day. It remains the largest and most fully illustrated survey of its subject ever published.<br>
<br>Laking's capacity for hard concentrated work was to some extent masked by a playboy image. A man of extraordinary charm&#151;he seems to have been loved by everyone who knew him, not least by women&#151;he was also known for his great kindness, immense generosity, and wild extravagance. He had expensive tastes in all the good things of life, including the collection of works of art, above all of fine early arms and armour. His friend Oswald Barron wrote of him that he spent his money &#145;like one who has a store of gold angels and gold nobles in an iron chest rather than as one who draws cheques on a banking account&#146;  (Barron, 43), and many stories used to be told about his extravagances. The most celebrated is probably that of his entertaining the members of the Meyrick Society (of arms and armour collectors) to a medieval feast at his home, which included a roast peacock in its feathers and his children's governess in armour handing round a loving-cup. In order to maintain his lifestyle he appears to have supplemented his income by giving expert advice to both collectors and dealers about works of art. There is considerable evidence to suggest that his need for money was so great that he did not always behave ethically when doing so.<br>
<br>Laking died on 22 November 1919 at his home, Meyrick Lodge, 16 Avenue Road, Regent's Park, and was buried in Highgate cemetery. He was survived by his wife. His son, Guy Francis William Laking (1904&#150;1930), succeeded as third and last baronet.<br>
