<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Feibusch,  Hans Nathan</span>  (1898&#150;1998), <span class="occ">mural painter</span>, was born in Frankfurt am Main, Germany, on 15 August 1898, the elder son of assimilated Jewish parents, Carl Feibusch (<i>d</i>. 1929), dental surgeon, and his wife, Marianne, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Ickelheimer, an amateur painter. He received a classical education and saw military service on the Russian front (1916&#150;18). Following the war he briefly pursued medical studies, but then turned to painting and studied in Munich and Berlin. After a period travelling in Italy (1921&#150;3) and further study in Paris, where he joined the studio of Andr&eacute; Lhote, he settled in Frankfurt in 1925 to pursue an artistic career and was awarded (in December 1930) the German state prize for painters from the Prussian Academy of Arts for <span class="italic">The Fishmonger</span> (1930). Consequent upon the persecution of Jews, he emigrated to England in 1933, was elected a member of the London Group (in 1934), and exhibited regularly at the Reid and Lefevre Gallery in London. On 3 July 1935 he married Sidonie Charlotte Cramer (1888&#150;1963), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/47517/', "David Gestetner")</script>, manufacturer of duplicators, and divorced wife of Max Cramer. There were no children of the marriage.<br>
<br>With the onset of war Feibusch spent some years in Cheltenham, joining actively in firefighting and first-aid work (he swore the oath of allegiance to the crown on 9 May 1940), and continued to paint&#151;exhibiting at the Royal Academy summer exhibition in 1944 (the first of many occasions)&#151;and began an association with the Church of England that was to dominate his life for the next thirty or so years. The catalyst for this association was Feibusch's first public mural, a commission from Edward D. Mills in 1937 for <span class="italic">The Footwashing</span> at the New Methodist Hall in Colliers Wood, London. Feibusch's paintings, in the strongest of which the figures, instead of occupying a perspectival third dimension, seem context-free and appear to float across the two-dimensional area of the wall, appealed greatly to modernist architects; and both Frankland Dark and E. Maxwell Fry commented favourably on work he accomplished in private houses.<br>
<br>The mural at Colliers Wood was widely acclaimed in the press and when the bishop of Chichester, George Bell, sought an artist to assist in &#145;the adornment and beautifying&#146;  (Foster, &#145;The Goring judgement&#146;, 255) of places of worship, Feibusch was the recommended artist. A meeting between the bishop and the painter took place in Brighton on new year's day 1940 and led to Feibusch's first commission in an Anglican church&#151;a nativity cycle at St Wilfrid's, Brighton. Following completion, and with the support of Bell (someone whom Feibusch, in old age, was to insist was the finest man he had ever known), other commissions followed&#151;for an extensive narrative, <span class="italic">Pilgrim's Progress</span>, at St Elisabeth's, Eastbourne, and for two murals at the Festival Church of St John, Waterloo (1950&#150;51). This last, commissioned by Thomas Ford, who was war damage surveyor in the diocese of Southwark, together with a substantial body of writing about the art of mural painting&#151;notably <span class="italic">Mural Painting</span> (1946)&#151;led to additional work in the Southwark diocese and, despite doubts in some quarters about employing a former German national and a Jew, to an assured reception in Anglican circles.<br>
<br>Commissions followed across the country&#151;at Coventry, Wellingborough, and Preston (Lancashire) to the north; Goring by Sea (opposition from traditionalists at diocesan advisory committee being resolved by George Bell presiding in his own consistory court), Paulsgrove, Christchurch, and Exeter in the south and west; and in London at St Ethelburga, Bishopsgate (a triptych), and at St Alban the Martyr, Holborn. It was at this last that Feibusch worshipped for some years (he was baptized and confirmed into the Church of England in 1965), painted his largest mural, <span class="italic">Trinity in Glory</span> (1966), together with fourteen stations of the cross, and, later, produced a bronze figure of Christ for the outer wall of the church. In all he worked in thirty Anglican churches (twenty-eight as a muralist, two&#151;including Ely Cathedral&#151;as sculptor only) and produced what is probably the largest body of work in his particular m&eacute;tier by any artist in the history of the Church of England.<br>
<br>A deep passion for his art, sensitivity to architectural space (much of his work was on panel but he always worked on site), and skilful interpretation of a client's commission did not restrict Feibusch to Anglican subjects, and he achieved notable work at Portmeirion (for Clough Williams-Ellis), at Dudley town hall, and at Newport (south Wales) where, assisted by Phyllis Bray&#151;who also worked with him on many church murals&#151;he completed twelve large panels in the civic centre depicting the history of the town. In later life he completed five portraits of <span class="roman">Old Testament</span> figures at Stern Hall, Seymour Place, London. These last, in concert with the approach of the fiftieth anniversary of the Second World War, marked a watershed in his association with Anglicanism and, although in 1985 he was awarded an honorary doctorate at Lambeth Palace, his mind turned increasingly to the past. In his final decade he renounced Christianity and prepared a sequence of gouaches that depict the agony of separation. The experience of exile was a powerful force throughout his life and many of his murals and canvases (for he painted mythological subjects and landscapes as well as biblical events) explore an aspiration for union&#151;his most prolific religious subject, for example, being the ascension.<br>
<br>In 1989 Feibusch was awarded the German grand cross of merit, and a few years later he arranged to gift the contents of his studio (some 464 works in all) to Pallant House Gallery, Chichester. He died on 18 July 1998 at the Royal Free Hospital, Camden, London, and was buried according to the rite of the Jewish Reform synagogue at Golders Green Jewish cemetery, on 21 July.<br>
