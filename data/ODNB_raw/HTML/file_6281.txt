<span class="headword">Copsi <span class="st"> [Coxo]</span></span>, earl of Northumbria  (<em>d.</em> 1067), <span class="occ">magnate</span>, first appears as the deputy of Tostig, earl of Northumbria (1055&#150;65), and, according to a text on the earls of Northumbria incorporated into the <span class="italic">Historia regum Anglorum</span> attributed to Symeon of Durham, was responsible for the government of the earldom. Copsi's origins are obscure but his name (probably the Old Norse Kofsi or Cofsi in Yorkshire <span class="roman">Domesday Book</span>) and the location of lands granted by him to the church of St Cuthbert suggest that he was a Yorkshire thegn. Symeon of Durham records a gift of several manors in north Yorkshire together with the church of St Germanus at Marske which had been dedicated by &AElig;thelric, bishop of Durham (1042&#150;56). Tostig's relations with members of the comital house of Bamburgh were strained and it is likely that Copsi's gift to St Cuthbert, like those of Tostig and his wife, was designed to bolster support for the regime north of the Tees. Copsi's gift was accompanied by the presentation of a silver cup which, Symeon noted, the church of St Cuthbert retained as a remembrance of the donation.<br>
<br>Copsi was expelled with Tostig by the Northumbrians in 1065. The twelfth-century source, Gaimar, suggests that in the spring of 1066 Copsi met Tostig at Thanet bringing seventeen ships with him from Orkney. Subsequently they seem to have joined with Harold Hardrada's invasion force and Copsi may have fought with his lord and the Norwegians at the battle of Stamford Bridge on 25 September 1066, although, unlike Tostig and Harald Hardrada, he survived. Copsi made his submission to King William at Barking early in 1067 along with earls Eadwine and Morcar. Morcar had been appointed to the earldom of Northumbria after Tostig's downfall and &#145;because he was burdened with other matters&#146;  (Symeon of Durham, <span class="italic">Opera</span>, 2.198). Morcar handed control over the north of the earldom (that is the land north of the Tyne), to Osulf, the representative of the native comital house of Bamburgh. On Morcar's arrest by William, Copsi was granted Osulf's earldom and in February 1067 he ventured north and forced Osulf to take refuge in the woods and mountains. There Osulf managed to gather together a band of supporters and they attacked Copsi while he was feasting at the ancient comital manor of Newburn-on-Tyne. Copsi escaped but was trapped in the nearby church (possibly now St Michael's, Newburn). The Northumbrians set fire to the church and when Copsi emerged he was decapitated by Osulf. Copsi's death occurred on 12 March, only five weeks after his appointment to the earldom. The Norman sources, which call him Coxo, suggest that some of Copsi's men had tried to persuade him to abandon his oath of fealty to the Conqueror and that his refusal to do so had driven them into opposing and finally murdering him. For both William of Poitiers and Orderic Vitalis, Copsi was the very model of a faithful vassal, a &#145;statesmanlike and honest man&#146;  (Ordericus Vitalis, <span class="italic">Eccl. hist.</span>, 2.207), and his death was eloquent testimony of his steadfast loyalty. His career highlights the very real difficulties which the later Anglo-Saxon and early Norman kings experienced in their attempts to govern Northumbria.<br>
