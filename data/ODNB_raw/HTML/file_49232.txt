<span class="headword">Littlejohn,  James</span>  (1921&#150;1988), <span class="occ">social anthropologist</span>, was born on 20 April 1921 at Clydevale, Clydesdale Street, Hamilton, Lanarkshire, the second of three sons and a daughter of James Argentine Littlejohn, schoolteacher, and his wife, Ann Robertson, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Shanks. From Hamilton Academy (1933&#150;9) he went with a Kitchener bursary to the University of Glasgow, where he matriculated in the faculty of arts in 1939 and studied English literature, history, and philosophy. Before he graduated he was called up in 1941 into the Cameron Highlanders. After officer training at Poona, he was posted to the 14th Punjabi regiment and was in action in the Burma campaign. After the war he was with the Black Watch before being discharged in 1947. It was in India that he met his future wife, Isabella (Ann) Anderson.<br>
<br>James Littlejohn's academic career was spent entirely in the service of the University of Edinburgh. In 1948, after completing a postgraduate diploma in anthropology at the London School of Economics, he was appointed to the department of social anthropology of the university. In 1971 he succeeded Professor Kenneth Little to the chair of social anthropology. When he retired in 1983 he was elected emeritus professor and university fellow. For his doctorate Littlejohn conducted ethnographic field work in the parish of Eskdalemuir, in the Scottish borders, between 1949 and 1951. The results were presented in 1955 in a thesis entitled &#145;The social structure of a Scottish rural community&#146;. The rather prosaic title conceals an intellectually ambitious project which has come to be recognized as an outstanding success. Littlejohn showed how contemporary social and cultural differentiation in the parish was the outcome of a relatively recent historical process transforming a locally determined agrarian community into one organized by a class structure embedded in the wider national social system of the United Kingdom. He also sought to find out how far anthropological techniques of research could be used effectively in the study of modern society. In this respect his research was the first study in Britain of social class by an anthropologist. The effectiveness of such techniques is evidenced in his pioneering analysis of the relationship of men and women to the class system. The thesis was published in 1963 as <span class="italic">Westrigg: the Sociology of a Cheviot Parish</span>.<br>
<br>Littlejohn then became part of a major multidisciplinary research project into industrialization and urbanization in Africa. The focus of this research was the mining town of Lunsar in Sierra Leone. Littlejohn's particular objective was to provide ethnographic data about a world defined in terms of magical relations changing into one of technical and rational relations. Field research among Temne-speaking people began in April 1959 and continued until March 1960. As in the earlier work in Scotland, Littlejohn set about investigating, through anthropological research into everyday life at a local level, historical processes of great generality. However, he was now attempting to document and explain something much more problematical: a human trajectory which Max Weber had called &#145;the disenchantment of the world&#146;. In a series of articles, of which the best-known is &#145;The Temne house&#146;, first published in 1960 and reprinted in <span class="italic">Mythology and Symbolism</span>, edited by John Middleton (1967), he attempted to elucidate forms of knowledge and modes of thought in &#145;a world from which the gods have not yet departed&#146;. In 1977 he returned to Sierra Leone and carried out further research with Temne diviners. Some of the results were presented in his unpublished Frazer lecture &#145;Magic boughs&#146;, at the University of Oxford on 30 November 1978. In all this work he became increasingly aware that notions such as that of &#145;sign&#146;, &#145;system&#146;, or &#145;metaphor&#146; as organizing principles of knowledge were inextricably contaminated with their own European history and, while they could not provide him with concepts adequate to the larger task he had set himself, they were, as a result, subject to searching critical analysis.<br>
<br>Jimmy Littlejohn (as he was widely known) died at his home, 14 Merchiston Avenue, Edinburgh, on 17 October 1988 after a short illness. His funeral took place at Mortonhall crematorium, Edinburgh. He is remembered by his students, many of whom now enjoy academic distinction themselves, as an inspiring teacher and intellectual, but also as a reserved and rather private man.<br>
