<span class="headword">Meidner,  Ludwig Baruch</span>  (1884&#150;1966), <span class="occ">painter and graphic artist</span>, was born on 18 April 1884 in Bernstadt, Silesia, one of four children of Gustav Georg Meidner (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1818), a textile merchant, and his wife, Rosa Glogauer (<i>d</i>. 1942). Meidner grew up in a Jewish family who owned a textile shop. In 1901 he started training as a bricklayer in preparation for the study of architecture. Two years later he began studying drawing at the K&ouml;nigliche Kunst- und Gewerbeschule in Breslau, Silesia. In 1905 he left the school and moved to Berlin; from there he went to Paris in 1906 to take painting lessons at the renowned academies Julian and Cormon. He became close friends with Amadeo Modigliani, whom he later commemorated in an article  (&#145;The young Modigliani: some memories&#146;, <span class="italic">Burlington Magazine</span>, 82, 1943, 87&#150;91). In 1907 he returned to Berlin, where he lived, with some intervals of absence, until 1935. In the years from 1907 he produced many works on paper for his finances hardly allowed him to paint in oil, a situation which changed in 1911 when he received a scholarship, largely owing to a testimonial from Max Beckmann. In 1912 he co-founded the group Die Pathetiker, which dissolved after its only exhibition at Der Sturm Gallery, Berlin, in the same year. About this time his style became more expressive and he produced urban landscapes such as <span class="italic">Apokalyptische Landschaft (Beim Bahnhof Halensee)</span> (1913; Los Angeles County Museum of Art), in which people run in several directions, houses seem to hang on to one another, and clouds scud across the sky, echoing the cubists' agitation of form and the futurists' dynamism. These works established Meidner's reputation as a central figure within the expressionist movement. Additionally he produced self-portraits, a genre which ran through his entire output, giving him the reputation of being the most frequently portrayed twentieth century artist.<br>
<br>From 1916 to 1918 Meidner served in the infantry and as a French interpreter in prisoner-of-war camps in Merzdorf, near Cottbus, Germany. Concurrently he wrote expressionist prose, including <span class="italic">Septemberschrei</span> (1920). In February 1918 he had his first solo exhibition at the Paul Cassirer Gallery, Berlin, which then went to the Kestner Society, Hanover. A year later he co-founded the Novembergruppe. From 1919 his expressionistic style became more relaxed and baroque, while Jewish and <span class="roman">Bible</span> themes replaced his earlier urban landscapes. At this time Meidner converted to Orthodox Judaism. From 1924 to 1926 he taught at the studios for painting and sculpture in Berlin-Charlottenburg, where he met his future wife, the painter and graphic artist Else Meyer (1901&#150;1987), whom he married in 1927 and with whom he had his only child, David (<i>b</i>. 1929). After the Nazis' rise to power Meidner was condemned as a degenerate artist and forbidden to work or exhibit because of his earlier expressionist style and his adherence to Judaism. The only employment he could find was at a Jewish institution, the Gymnasium Jawneh in Cologne, Germany, where he taught drawing between 1935 and 1938. Many of his works were confiscated from museums, such as the Nationalgalerie Berlin, and included in the Munich Degenerate Art Exhibition of 1937.<br>
<br>Because of these events, in August 1939 Meidner and his family left Germany for Britain with the help of Augustus John and Thomas Tufton, who acted as personal guarantors. Meidner went to London, where he lived throughout his time in Britain except for his internment as an enemy alien on the Isle of Man between June 1940 and January 1942. Strangely enough this was his happiest time in exile as he was stationed with other kindred German artists. In Britain he had little artistic recognition and, as a result, became impoverished; the only gallery to mount an exhibition of his (and his wife's) work was the Ben Uri Gallery, London, in 1949. Despite the paucity of artistic acceptance he produced numerous works, including charcoal, chalk, and watercolour series, ranging from political themes, such as <span class="italic">Massacres in Poland</span> (1942&#150;5, Stadtarchiv Darmstadt, Germany), to burlesque prints, for example, <span class="italic">Caf&eacute;s, Theater, Vari&eacute;t&eacute; (und Comics)</span> (1951; priv. coll.). These series reflect the influence of William Blake, who, as Meidner felt, was a kindred spirit in visionary painting and writing.<br>
<br>Since he never felt at home in Britain Meidner returned to Germany, without his wife, in 1953. For the first two years he lived in a Jewish old people's home in Frankfurt and then in Marxheim (near Hofheim). He stayed there until 1963, when the town of Darmstadt provided him with a studio flat at the same time as holding a large retrospective of his work. He died on 14 May 1966, of a heart attack in Darmstadt (where he was buried at the Jewish cemetery), and so he could only briefly experience recognition as one of the most important German artists of the twentieth century. He received decorations such as the Grosses Bundesverdienstkreuz of the Federal Republic of Germany in 1964, and had national and international exhibitions, including the 1991 retrospective at the Institut Mathildenh&ouml;he Darmstadt, where thirty-five oils and numerous works on paper were shown. Besides his main archive, held at the Stadtarchiv Darmstadt, his works appear in the collections of, among others, the St&auml;dtische Kunstsammlungen in Darmstadt, the Marvin and Janet Fishman collection in Milkwaukee, USA, and the Deutsches Literaturarchiv in Marbach, Germany.<br>
