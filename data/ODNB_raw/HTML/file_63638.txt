<span class="headword">Wood,  Arthur Henry</span>  (1875&#150;1953), <span class="occ">conductor and composer</span>, was born on 24 January 1875 in Cemetery Road, Heckmondwike, Yorkshire, the eldest child of George Henry Wood (<i>b</i>. 1850), tailor, and his wife, Henrietta Jackson Hepworth (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1853/4). His father played in a local amateur orchestra as violinist, on which instrument Arthur initially followed him before settling on the flute and piccolo. In 1882 the family moved to Harrogate, where Wood received lessons from Arthur Brookes, a member of the municipal orchestra. He left school at the age of twelve, and at fourteen was organist of St Paul's Presbyterian Church, Harrogate. More particularly he became flautist, accompanist, and eventually assistant conductor of the municipal orchestra under J. Sidney Jones. He later recalled conducting four times per day, especially rueing the 7.30 a.m. band-calls designed to attract visitors to take the waters. At these he sometimes had to conduct in mittens, while the musicians played with their noses running. Later Wood joined the Bournemouth Municipal Orchestra under Dan Godfrey, and also had a spell in Llandudno.<br>
<br>It was Sidney Jones, the son of the Harrogate Municipal Orchestra's music director and composer of the musical play <span class="italic">The Geisha</span>, who brought Wood to London as music director for his comedy opera <span class="italic">My Lady Molly</span> at Terry's Theatre in 1903. About this time Wood married, and he and his wife, Ethel Louise, had a son and two daughters. Wood subsequently conducted at the Apollo Theatre in 1904 for Andr&eacute; Messager's <span class="italic">V&eacute;ronique</span> and in 1906 for the musical <span class="italic">The Dairymaids</span> by Paul Rubens and Frank E. Tours. The latter was the start of an association with the producer Robert Courtneidge that included Wood's appointment as the music director of the Shaftesbury Theatre from 1908 to 1916.<br>
<br>Wood's tenure as conductor at the Shaftesbury was notable especially for Lionel Monckton's and Howard Talbot's musical play <span class="italic">The Arcadians</span>. It was Wood who arranged the overture on Monckton's and Talbot's melodies that has often been used as a concert item. During this period he became recognized as one of the most accomplished and reliable of West End music directors, and he went on to fill the same position at the Gaiety (1917&#150;21), the Prince of Wales's (1921&#150;2, 1927&#150;8), Daly's (1922&#150;6, 1929&#150;30), His Majesty's (1928&#150;9), the Cambridge (1930&#150;31), the Savoy (1931), the Coliseum (1932), and the Garrick (1934). During these years he also composed scores for several touring musical comedies and revues, including <span class="italic">Oh, Caesar!</span> (1916), <span class="italic">Petticoat Fair</span> (1919), <span class="italic">Fancy Fair</span> (1919), <span class="italic">Too Many Girls</span> (1919), <span class="italic">Archie</span> (1924), and <span class="italic">The Sheik of Shepherd's Bush</span> (1924). His tenure at Daly's during the 1920s covered the 1923 revival of <span class="italic">The Merry Widow</span> with Evelyn Laye, Derek Oldham, Carl Brisson, and George Graves. In 1925 Wood took the entire Daly's Theatre orchestra to the Opera House, Manchester, for the try-out of Oscar Straus's <span class="italic">Cleopatra</span>, but the orchestra pit flooded, and he conducted in evening dress and gumboots.<br>
<br>During the 1930s Wood conducted on tour&#151;notably with No&euml;l Coward's <span class="italic">Bitter-Sweet</span> (1931&#150;2) and George Posford's <span class="italic">The Gay Hussar</span> (1933&#150;4). In addition he became a frequent guest conductor for the BBC. Throughout his career he composed much finely crafted light orchestral music, of which <span class="italic">Three Old Dances</span> (1902) was an early example. As a composer for Boosey and Hawkes he produced works that particularly commemorated his native Yorkshire, as in <span class="italic">Three Dale Dances</span> (1917), <span class="italic">Three More Dale Dances</span> (1927), <span class="italic">Yorkshire Moors Suite</span>, <span class="italic">My Native Heath</span> (1925), <span class="italic">Yorkshire Rhapsody</span>, and <span class="italic">Barnsley Fair</span>. Besides other suites, such as <span class="italic">Three Mask Dances</span> (1927), his compositions ranged from a one-step, <span class="italic">You Can't Keep Still</span>, to a concertino for flute, published in a reduction for flute and piano in 1948. True to his north-country origins, he also composed marches for brass bands and became a respected adjudicator.<br>
<br>Of his light orchestral compositions the piece that gave Wood his greatest fame was the suite <span class="italic">My Native Heath</span>, which comprised four movements&#151;&#145;Knaresboro Status&#146;, &#145;Ilkley Tarn&#146;, &#145;Bolton Abbey&#146;, and &#145;Barwick Green&#146;. The final movement, a portrayal of a maypole dance on the village green of Barwick in Elmet, east of Leeds, was adopted as the signature tune for the BBC radio series <span class="italic">The Archers</span>, a role it went on to fulfil into the twenty-first century.<br>
<br>Wood was a member of the Green Room and Savage clubs. He lived for many years at 20 Arlington Gardens, Chiswick, London, where he died on 18 January 1953, aged seventy-seven.<br>
