<span class="headword">Douglas,  James</span>, ninth earl of Douglas and third earl of Avondale  (<em>c.</em>1425&#150;1491), <span class="occ">magnate and rebel</span>, was the second son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7891/', "James Douglas, seventh earl of Douglas and first earl of Avondale (d. 1443)")</script>, and Beatrix Sinclair (<i>d</i>. in or before 1463), daughter of Henry Sinclair, second earl of Orkney.<h2>
<a name="Entryintonationallife"></a>Entry into national life</h2>In his earliest years Douglas seemed destined for an ecclesiastical career. His father favoured the Council of Basel against the pope, representing a minority view within Scotland, and sought preferment from the anti-pope Felix V for James to the bishopric of Aberdeen in 1441 (despite his youth). As Scotland remained loyal to Eugenius IV, however, James's hopes were dashed. Although he seems to have matriculated at the University of Cologne in mid-1443, no more is heard of his ecclesiastical ambitions. That is probably no accident. He had a twin brother, Archibald, earl of Moray, and in 1447, after evidence was taken from his mother and other women, a decision was made that James was the elder and might therefore succeed to the title and estates if their brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7928/', "William Douglas, eighth earl of Douglas")</script>, remained childless.<br>
<br>A more martial turn to James Douglas's career had already been demonstrated in late 1446, when he was briefly keeper of Hailes Castle. It was underlined by his fighting in the lists at Stirling in February 1449 in the presence of James II, with two other Scots against three Burgundians, all of whom were knighted by the king at the time. His own opponent, Jacques de Lalain, had apparently become aware of Douglas's prowess and issued a challenge to him, and was successful in their encounter.<br>
<br>The occasion of Douglas's succession to the earldom could scarcely have been less propitious. He was among the notable entourage who accompanied his brother Earl William when he visited Rome in the jubilee year of 1450. On their return James spent part of 1451 in England, perhaps seeking English support, as the absence of the Douglases had brought to the surface discontent at court about the earl's posturing. The king harboured doubts about the earl's ambitions and about his confederacies with other nobles, and summoned him under a safe conduct to Stirling in February 1452, ostensibly to discuss his bonds with the earls of Crawford and Ross. When on 22 February Earl William refused to break them, the king suddenly stabbed him, setting in train a chain of blows from other courtiers standing near by from which he died instantly.<h2>
<a name="Conflictaccommodationandrevolt"></a>Conflict, accommodation, and revolt</h2>A month passed before Earl James displayed his anger at the circumstances of his brother's death, when he and his allies wreaked havoc in Stirling, after denouncing the king and his courtiers to the blast of twenty-four horns and dragging the safe conduct through the town tied to a horse. It must have been a remarkable sight. The king was absent, and made no immediate effort to confront Douglas. In (probably) May 1452 the earl conferred with John MacDonald, lord of the Isles, in Knapdale, rewarding MacDonald's entourage with wine and clothes, perhaps as an inducement to foment trouble. When parliament met in Edinburgh in June and exonerated the king from blame for the slaying of Earl William, Earl James and others, including James, Lord Hamilton, fixed a letter on the parliament house door renouncing their allegiance to the king and saying that they would not hold their lands of him. This has been considered an example of <i>diffidatio</i>, the breaking by a vassal of his fealty to his lord. Meanwhile, Douglas was also holding negotiations with Henry VI of England. King James had to react, and he conducted a destructive raid upon the border areas where Douglas might have found followers.<br>
<br>This military action seems to have persuaded Douglas to draw up a bond in August 1452 under which, among other matters, he and his party agreed to forgive those who had taken part in the killing of his brother and to make no bonds which threatened the king. Such notable concessions by Douglas imply that he considered that an accommodation with the king would serve him better in the long run. It was a useful boost for the king; he showed his uneasiness by sealing at the same time in parliament a pardon for the surviving members of the Livingston family who had been disgraced and forfeited in 1449&#150;50.<br>
<br>Perhaps to underline his concern to negotiate with Douglas, James II made a further accord with him in January 1453, whereby the earl promised to give manrent and service to the king in return for restoration of certain lands. About the same time the king granted Douglas permission to marry his brother's widow and cousin, Margaret, the fair maid of Galloway (<i>c</i>.1432&#150;<i>c</i>.1476?), daughter of Archibald Douglas, fifth earl of Douglas, if the necessary dispensation could be obtained from the pope. This was a significant act of patronage, for Margaret was the sister and heir of the sixth earl of Douglas (<i>d</i>. 1440), and therefore possessed the lordship of Galloway and other estates. Earl William's marriage to her had been engineered by his father to ensure that the Douglas patrimony was not sundered; but that marriage lacked offspring and the patrimony would have been divided had the king not been prepared to allow James to marry his sister-in-law. The marriage was duly celebrated, and Douglas was then accepted back into court circles, to the extent that he, as ambassador, sealed a new truce with England in May 1453. Even so, he remained a fringe figure. The only formal offices he held in Scotland were those of sheriff of Lanark, a post hereditary in his family, to which he succeeded on his brother's death, and warden of the west and middle marches (against England).<br>
<br>Notwithstanding his concord with the king, Douglas seems to have continued to intrigue with potential supporters. Douglas castles in Moray, Kirkcudbrightshire, Lanarkshire, and Linlithgowshire were fortified, and the queen's dower lands and a grange of the king's justiciar were burnt. Early in 1455, however, the king, intending to pre-empt (and perhaps also to provoke) further manoeuvres by Douglas, besieged and threw down Douglas's castle of Inveravon near Linlithgow, and then began to sweep west and south to ravage Douglas lands. By April he was besieging Abercorn, Linlithgowshire, which Douglas attempted to defend with all his forces; but his lack of strength was all too clearly shown when Lord Hamilton, sensing that Douglas was wavering, switched sides, causing Douglas to flee to England. Without him his men were no match for a force of borderers loyal to the king when they met at Arkinholm on 1 May 1455.<br>
<br>The consequences of defeat included the forfeiture in parliament in June of the earl, his mother, and brothers after a charge of treason, and also the execution of his younger brother Hugh, earl of Ormond. The sentence on Douglas was carried out in his absence since he was in England, where he remained for almost all the rest of his life. His extensive estates were split up, some being annexed in perpetuity by the crown and others forming significant prizes for its supporters. One of the Douglas kindred, George Douglas, fourth earl of Angus, the head of the so-called Red Douglases, was rewarded with the lordship of Douglas, and quickly sought to establish authority over former Douglas vassals in Lanarkshire. The Douglas estates formed a substantial bloc, and are estimated to have brought the king gross cash rents of about &pound;2000 Scots, approximately one-third of the total for all crown lands. They comprised land in Dumfriesshire, Kirkcudbrightshire, Wigtownshire, Lanarkshire, Linlithgowshire, Edinburgh, Haddingtonshire, Berwickshire, Peeblesshire, Roxburghshire, Selkirkshire, Aberdeenshire, Ayrshire, and Renfrewshire: the largest accumulation of property held by one individual in Scotland apart from the king. The lands in the western and mid-borders lay at the traditional heart of the Douglas domains, but Earl James drew most of his support from his father's patrimony in Lanarkshire and Linlithgowshire.<h2>
<a name="PensionerofEngland"></a>Pensioner of England</h2>Douglas had now to rely on charity from the king of England. His first gift from Henry VI was received as early as 4 August 1455, a pension of &pound;500 until his estates were restored by James II. Douglas, however, had already surrendered Threave Castle, his principal stronghold, to Henry in return for succour and provisions (an ineffectual move, as the castle was annexed by James II). The comparative peace between Scotland and England in the next few years provided no opportunities for Douglas, apart from a possible raid on Kirkcudbright in 1457 in the company of the Stanleys, English lords of the Isle of Man (a retaliation for an earlier Scottish attack on the island).<br>
<br>The circumstances surrounding the accession of Edward IV in England in 1461, and the death of James II on 3 August 1460, renewed Douglas hopes of political influence in Scotland. The Lancastrians had made a successful bid for Scottish support in December 1460, and in response Edward sent Douglas, together with his brother John Douglas, Lord Balvenie, to communicate with John MacDonald, who as earl of Ross as well as lord of the Isles had continued to be a thorn in the flesh of successive Scottish kings. The result was the document known as the treaty of Westminster&#150;Ardtornish, made in February 1462, by which Ross and his associates bound themselves to become vassals of Edward and to co-operate with his forces in the conquest of Scotland. Should this occur, the reward for Douglas would include the restoration of his estates and the division of the remainder of Scotland with the earl of Ross, all these lands to be held of the king of England. As Ross swiftly rebelled against James III, this approach brought some short-term benefit. The following spring Douglas, again with Edward's connivance, was in the field in the borders, culminating in early March in an encounter in which the earl of Crawford, among others, was temporarily imprisoned; Douglas also appears to have been in Galloway in the early summer.<br>
<br>The Scots themselves had been pursuing an aggressive policy towards England, but this could not be sustained once a truce between England and France was agreed in October 1463, and they sealed their own truce with England in December. At that time Douglas, apparently at his own request, was appointed governor of Carrickfergus in Ireland by Edward. For his services Edward made Douglas a knight of the Garter, the first Scot to receive the distinction.<h2>
<a name="Revancheandretirement"></a>Revanche and retirement</h2>The more stable relations between England and Scotland thereafter gave Douglas little leeway. He continued to collect his annuity from Edward, and served with the English army during Edward's major expedition to France in 1475, while in 1480 he was paid for services on the Anglo-Scottish border. Soon afterwards Douglas became involved with Alexander Stewart, duke of Albany (James III's brother but a fellow exile). In 1482 Albany had engaged, with English assistance, in a campaign to re-establish himself in Scotland. The attempt failed, but in February 1483 Edward made a treaty with the duke, whereby Albany renounced his Scottish allegiance in return for English help in capturing the Scottish throne; for his part Albany undertook to assist Douglas in recovering his Scottish estates. The childless Douglas apparently also made an agreement with Archibald Douglas, fifth earl of Angus, who was also a rebel against James III, perhaps about the destination of Douglas's estates after his death. All these manoeuvres came to nothing. In July 1484 Douglas accompanied Albany and about 500 men when, without English support, they raided Lochmaben, in a lordship formerly held by his family where Douglas clearly expected to receive support. Instead they were attacked by local forces and easily defeated on 22 July, and Douglas was made captive. The king evidently now feared Douglas little, as he permitted him to reside thenceforth in the abbey of Lindores in Fife, where he died in mid-1491 and where he was most probably buried. By then he had become a pensioner of James IV. The later historian of the Douglas family, David Hume of Godscroft, claims that James III, aware of the pressure he had to face in 1488&#151;he was eventually defeated in battle by forces including his son and heir, and was killed during his flight from the fray&#151;personally sought assistance from Douglas, offering restoration of his titles and possessions in return. The offer was curtly rebuffed. Hume was anxious to paint Douglas in a favourable light. He makes little reference to the earl's career as a liegeman of successive English kings; and he told this tale to emphasize Douglas's resolution against a suppliant king whose father had brought about the violent death of the earl's brother and had later forfeited the earl himself.<br>
<br>Douglas's first marriage, to Margaret Douglas, probably occurred in early 1453. She fled to England with him, but (after apparently obtaining a divorce) returned to Scotland <i>c</i>.1459, and then married the king's half-brother John Stewart, earl of Atholl; she may have died <i>c</i>.1476, when Stewart remarried. Douglas's second marriage was to Anne (<i>c</i>.1430&#150;1486), daughter of John Holland, duke of Exeter (<i>d</i>. 1447), and his first wife, Anne Stafford (<i>d</i>. 1432). Relict successively of John Neville (<i>d</i>. 1450) and of the latter's uncle John, Lord Neville (<i>d</i>. 1461), she married Douglas some time after 1461. She predeceased him, dying on 26 December 1486. From neither marriage did Douglas have children.<br>
