<span class="headword">Tesdale,  Thomas</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1547, <em>d.</em> 1610), <span class="occ">benefactor</span>, was baptized on 13 October 1547 at Stanford Dingley, Berkshire, the son of Thomas Tesdale (1507&#150;1556), farmer and trader, and his second wife, Joan (<i>d</i>. 1548), daughter of William Knapp of Harcourt, Berkshire, and widow of Richard Foster of Stanford Dingley. Following his father's death Tesdale was brought up by his uncle Richard Tesdale, a saddler of Abingdon, Berkshire, and was the first scholar admitted to John Roysse's reconstituted free school there in 1563. By the age of twenty he had taken over the malt-making side of the family business and in June 1567 married Maud (1545&#150;1616), the daughter of Reginald Stone of Henley-on-Thames, Oxfordshire, and widow of Edward Little of Abingdon. None of their children survived infancy.<br>
<br>Tesdale was active in the public life of Abingdon and in 1580 became both a principal burgess and master of Christ's Hospital. He was elected mayor in 1581 but declined to serve as he had left the borough on moving to Ludwell Manor near Kidlington, Oxfordshire. Soon after 1586 he moved to Glympton near Woodstock, Oxfordshire, where he rented the manor house and successfully engaged in the production of woad for dyeing, in addition to other agricultural enterprises. He became a wealthy man. He died at Glympton on 13 June 1610 and was buried at Glympton church, where he was commemorated by a black marble tombstone with a brass figure and inscription. Following his widow's death in 1616 a fine alabaster monument to husband and wife was erected close by his original tombstone.<br>
<br>Tesdale's will dated 31 May 1610 made generous provision for his widow and other relatives as well as a number of bequests to Abingdon charities; he also left &pound;5000 to establish places at any Oxford college for six scholars and seven fellows from Abingdon School. He stated a preference for Balliol, but although the six scholars eventually took their places there it was not for long. There were similar connections between other schools and foundations at other Oxford colleges, like that between Reading and St John's College according to Sir Thomas White's bequest. Tesdale's generosity was part of a wider pattern of collegiate expansion during the early seventeenth century. There were protracted delays in finalizing the arrangements and when in 1623 Richard Wightwick, rector of East Illsley, Berkshire, offered to supplement Tesdale's bequest, the Abingdon corporation petitioned James I to allow its transfer from Balliol to found a new college. With the assistance of George Abbot, archbishop of Canterbury, one of Tesdale's three feoffees to uses, and the approval of the chancellor of the university, William Herbert, third earl of Pembroke, whose name it took, Broadgates Hall was refounded as Pembroke College on 29 June 1624.<br>
