<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Overton,  Richard</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1640&#150;1663), <span class="occ">Leveller and pamphleteer</span>, is of uncertain background and origins.<h2>
<a name="Earlylife"></a>Early life</h2>There are two conflicting accounts of Overton's early life, both largely conjectural. In Amsterdam there exists a signed Latin confession of faith made by Overton on his conversion to General Baptism, and it was once generally assumed that this was made at the same time as other General Baptist confessions in the same archive, about 1615. If so, this would give him a probable date of birth some time before 1600. The relatively greater emphasis than other Levellers in his writings on such rural grievances as enclosure may indicate that he had rural origins, possibly in Lincolnshire, a county in which the surname Overton was common and which was the original centre of General Baptism in England. By the time he made his confession he was living in the Dutch republic, and he returned to England some time prior to 1640. On the basis of his later printing activities and the existence of a printer called Henry Overton, it has also been widely assumed that Overton was a professional printer. This reconstruction of Overton's early life is doubtful. There is evidence that Overton's confession of faith may date from as late as 1643, and there is no known connection between Richard and Henry Overton; both the quality of works printed by Richard and his habitual use of other professional printers suggest that his own printing activities were undertaken on an amateur basis, as a by-product of his political activities.<br>
<br>A Richard Overton matriculated as a sizar from Queens' College, Cambridge, at Easter 1631, and this may have been the future Leveller; if so, this may indicate a date of birth about 1614 or slightly before. Overton's works do suggest a relatively high level of educational attainment, showing a competent command of Latin, traces of classical culture, and some knowledge of medicine, the law, formal rhetoric, astronomy, astrology, and alchemy.<br>
<br>Some conjectures have been made about Overton's life on the basis of works attributed to him, but these are made uncertain by the difficulty of establishing his <i>&#339;uvre</i>. About 150 pamphlets and journalistic writings have been attributed to Overton, although only about a sixth were signed or subsequently acknowledged by him. In many cases there is clear evidence against Overton's authorship; conversely, there is evidence that he was the author of some later anonymous pamphlets generally attributed to John Lilburne or William Walwyn. A reference to himself in the anonymous <span class="italic">Old Newes Newly Revived</span> (June 1641) as &#145;the little Levite that writ <span class="roman">Lambeth Faire</span>&#146;  (sig. A2<i>v</i>) implies that Overton had been a clergyman, and a passage in <span class="italic">The Curates Conference</span> (April 1641), attributed to Overton on stylistic grounds, suggests that he left university to become a curate, and that he subsequently accompanied the English army during the bishops' wars in the capacity of a chaplain; a question asked by the earl of Essex in 1646 implied that Overton had at some time been a soldier, but whether during the bishops' wars or the early years of the civil war is not known. Some of Overton's early works take dialogue form and include stage directions, and he may have been involved in writing and performing anti-Laudian satirical playlets between 1640 and 1642.<br>
<br>Overton's first signed pamphlets were <span class="italic">Articles of High Treason Exhibited Against Cheap-Side Crosse</span> (January 1642) and <span class="italic">New Lambeth Fayre</span> (March 1642), an expanded version of the anonymous <span class="italic">Lambeth Faire</span> (June 1641). Strong stylistic evidence and internal references suggest that he was also the author of other pamphlets at this time, beginning with <span class="italic">Vox Borealis</span> (October 1640), claiming to be printed by Margery Mar-Prelate. The pseudonym had already been used by the author of several presbyterian pamphlets in 1588&#150;9, two of which were twice reprinted in 1641&#150;3, possibly by Overton; his use of this pseudonym foreshadows the Martin Mar-Priest persona he was later to adopt.<br>
<br>The works written by and attributed to Overton in 1640&#150;42 are all primarily anti-Laudian and anti-Catholic satires, attacking church courts, the high commission, the &#145;etcetera oath&#146;, pluralism, the <span class="roman">Book of Sports</span>, surplices, bowing at the name of Jesus, and wedding rings. They are written from the point of view of a puritan within the Church of England: he criticizes the tithe system, not because tithes were wrong in themselves, but because the income they generated was used to support lazy parsons rather than industrious curates; and his criticism of episcopacy was aimed more at the conduct of particular bishops than the office itself. He also occasionally satirized separatists, suggesting that Overton had not yet converted to General Baptism. The early pamphlets often raise such secular grievances as ship money and monopolies, and they already display Overton's marked hostility to lawyers, but there is little in them that foreshadows his later radicalism. The king is not attacked as such, but is represented as being misled by his evil councillors, especially William Laud and Thomas Wentworth, first earl of Strafford. These early works are frequently written either in verse or as dialogues. Overton depended heavily on punning, employed a good deal of coarse humour, and had a tendency to use violent language, features which were to remain characteristic of his style throughout his later career. They contain no indication of the theoretical sophistication that he was later to achieve, and nothing in the way of a positive programme other than a call for triennial parliaments.<h2>
<a name="GeneralBaptismandtheMarPriesttracts"></a>General Baptism and the Mar-Priest tracts</h2>Overton seems to have ceased writing between April 1642 and January 1644. It has been suggested that he may have married his wife, <a name="cosubject_70367"></a><span class="headword">Mary Overton</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1646&#150;1647), <span class="occ">Leveller</span>, in this period. Nothing is known of her background or parentage and she was first mentioned by her husband in 1646. There is no evidence to support the identification of Overton and his wife with the Richard and Mary who were married at St George the Martyr, Southwark, in March 1643, but the fact that the couple had three young children and a six-month-old baby in 1647 would suggest a marriage some time in the early 1640s. A pamphlet of 1643 protesting against imprisonment for debt has been attributed to Overton; the evidence for Overton's authorship is not compelling, but if this attribution is sound he himself was in prison for debt at this time.<br>
<br>Overton had resumed his writing career by January 1644 when he published his treatise <span class="italic">Mans Mortalitie</span>, the first edition of which was printed by himself; a second edition correcting the copious printer's errors was published shortly afterwards. The treatise argued in favour of the mortalist heresy known as thnetopsychism: Adam had originally been created to be immortal, but after the fall both his soul and body became subject to death; both, however, would be miraculously reconstituted at the last judgment. Although some historians have taken <span class="italic">Mans Mortalitie</span> to be evidence of Overton's secularism and rationalism, thnetopsychism was widespread in General Baptist circles; this, together with the anti-separatism of his earlier works, makes it probable that Overton's conversion to General Baptism occurred about 1642&#150;3. Thnetopsychism was a doctrine which tended to be accompanied by the belief that the kingdom of God would be established on earth rather than in heaven, and it involved strong millenarian tendencies. <span class="italic">Mans Mortalitie</span>, together with Milton's <span class="italic">Doctrine and Discipline of Divorce</span>, was condemned by the Commons on 26 August 1644, and it subsequently attracted much criticism from presbyterian writers. Throughout his life thnetopsychism remained an important concern of Overton's. He was present at a General Baptist meeting in London discussing the topic in January 1646; the lord mayor ordered the meeting to be broken up, but at Overton's instigation the participants succeeded in debating both mortalism and the right of civil authorities to interfere in matters of conscience for a further five hours. Overton published a revised edition of <span class="italic">Mans Mortalitie</span> (<span class="italic">Man Wholly Mortal</span>) in 1655; unsold copies of this edition were reissued with a new title-page in 1675.<br>
<br>The debate on mortalism in 1646 took place in Thomas Lambe's General Baptist congregation in Bell Alley, Coleman Street, and Overton was a member of this church at least as early as January 1644. According to Overton the church was frequently harassed by presbyterian mobs, ranging from throwing stones in the street to firing musket-shots into the congregation. The London General Baptists included a number of other future Levellers, including Nicholas Tew. Overton was mentioned in connection with Tew after the latter's arrest for operating an illegal press on 17 January 1644. Tew's press was also used for printing works by Lilburne and possibly Walwyn, suggesting that the future Leveller leaders may already have been in close contact.<br>
<br>In April 1645 Overton published <span class="italic">The Araignment of Mr Persecution</span> under the pseudonym Martin Mar-Priest. This was the first of a series of satirical attacks on the presbyterians: <span class="italic">A Sacred Decretall</span> (May), <span class="italic">Martin's Eccho</span> (June), <span class="italic">The Nativity of Sir John Presbyter</span> (July), <span class="italic">The Ordinance of Tythes Dismounted</span> (December), and <span class="italic">Divine Observations upon the London Ministers Letter</span> (January 1646). Overton evidently regarded these tracts as the source of his celebrity, since he continued to refer to himself as &#145;little Martin&#146; in several of his later Leveller pamphlets published under his own name. Richard Baxter recorded that the Mar-Priest tracts were &#145;abundantly dispersed&#146; in the army  (<span class="italic">Reliquiae Baxterianae</span>, ed. M. Sylvester, 1696, 53) and their popularity is witnessed by the appearance of several imitations, published mostly under the pseudonym of Sir John Presbyter; these latter tracts, however, appear to be the work of a royalist satirist.<br>
<br>The Mar-Priest tracts are primarily concerned with arguing for complete freedom of conscience and a rigorous separation of church and state. They also mount a vigorous attack on the system of tithes, an issue raised to prominence by an ordinance of November 1644 which attempted to enforce their payment. Overton argued that the clergy should either work for a living or be supported by voluntary contributions; tithes themselves might continue to be collected, but they should be used to create a system of poor relief. The Mar-Priest tracts repeatedly contrast the Independents and Baptists in the army, whom he believed primarily responsible for parliamentarian victories, with the presbyterians in parliament and the City, who are represented rather paradoxically as war profiteers who were eager to capitulate to the king. In <span class="italic">Martin's Eccho</span> Overton became the first of the future Levellers to raise the issue of the soldiers' arrears of pay, foreshadowing the attempt to forge a Leveller&#150;agitator alliance in 1647. The Mar-Priest tracts mark an important stage in Overton's intellectual development. They are still primarily concerned with issues affecting Overton and his fellow sectaries, but they also introduce the basic elements of his later political theory. He repudiated any notion of rule by divine right, and he asserted that all legitimate political authority is held as a &#145;trust&#146; from the people. Overton, however, did not as yet give an elaborate exposition of his political theory or detail any of the practical constitutional arrangements that would be necessary to ensure that political authorities would not betray the people's trust.<h2>
<a name="Levellercareer"></a>Leveller career</h2>Overton may have developed a more secular political outlook by September 1645, if he was the author of <span class="italic">Englands Miserie and Remedy</span>. There is, however, no firm evidence for Overton's authorship of this pamphlet, but it is possible that he was the author of <span class="italic">Englands Birth-Right Justifed</span> (1645), a pamphlet often attributed to John Lilburne. This tract is of some historical importance, since it gives for the first time a fairly full statement of what became the Leveller programme. The author calls for the abolition of tithes, monopolies, and the excise; all taxation should be by way of &#145;subsidy&#146; (a tax on wealth). Arbitrary imprisonment is to be abolished, no one is to be forced to testify against themselves, and all laws should be written in English. Lawyers and anyone holding a paid state office were to be excluded from parliament, and parliament itself should meet and if necessary be elected on an annual basis.<br>
<br>Overton was probably the author of a number of anonymous pamphlets published early in 1646, beginning with <span class="italic">The Last Warning to All the Inhabitants of London</span>, a call for democratic reform of the City government. The pamphlet warns against compromise with the king, condemns the presbyterians' intolerance, and shows traces of the anti-Scottish sentiments which were prominent in Overton's later works. It was condemned by the Commons on 22 March; the printer William Larner was arrested and a number of pamphlets were seized, including <span class="italic">The Afflicted Christian Justified</span> and <span class="italic">Divine Light</span>, which show traces of Overton's style. More doubtful attributions to Overton at this time include <span class="italic">The Interest of England Maintained</span> and <span class="italic">A Pearle in a Dunghill</span> (otherwise ascribed to Henry Marten and William Walwyn respectively).<br>
<br>Overton was almost certainly sole or part author of <span class="italic">A Remonstrance of many Thousand Citizens</span> (1646), which is widely regarded as the founding manifesto of the Levellers. The <span class="italic">Remonstrance</span> attacks the presbyterian-dominated Commons for merely attempting to substitute their own tyranny for that of the king; more significantly, it marks a shift to republicanism in attacking kingship as such rather than Charles I's conduct of the office. Nevertheless, Overton does not seem to have been a republican on principle, and in his later works he veered from expressions of qualified support for monarchy to outright republicanism in accordance with the exigencies of the current situation. The <span class="italic">Remonstrance</span> also expounded what was to become a favourite theme in subsequent Leveller propaganda: the theory of the Norman yoke (that the English had enjoyed full constitutional liberty before the Norman conquest, and that William the Conqueror and all his successors were tyrannical usurpers). The programme suggested in the <span class="italic">Remonstrance</span> is simply an expanded version of that offered in <span class="italic">Englands Birth-Right Justified</span>; its underlying political theory is substantially the same as that of the Mar-Priest tracts, but developed at greater length.<br>
<br>In July 1646 Overton published <span class="italic">An Alarum to the House of Lords</span>, which was condemned by the House of Commons on 4 August. He was subsequently arrested at his Southwark home in a dawn raid on 11 August, while his wife was recovering from having given birth to their youngest child. Overton attempted to escape but was captured by a party of musketeers waiting outside and robbed of his money before being led away. A number of manuscripts were seized, including that of <span class="italic">The Last Warning</span>, &#145;A propheticall warning and sounding of the trumpet&#146;, and a treatise on baptism and the Lord's supper; if this last was the work of Overton himself, it clearly suggests that despite his politicization he continued to be interested in purely theological issues. After his arrest Overton was taken before a committee of the House of Lords chaired by the earl of Essex, refusing to answer any questions on the basis that no one should be forced to testify against themselves. As a consequence he was committed to Newgate for contempt.<br>
<br>While in Newgate, Overton may have written <span class="italic">Liberty Vindicated Against Slavery</span> (a pamphlet usually attributed to Lilburne, despite his own disclaimer). This tract calls for comprehensive prison reform, a theme which was prominent in Overton's other writings. Gaolers should be forbidden to charge fees from their prisoners, and were instead to be paid a salary by the state; prisoners were no longer to be expected to maintain themselves, but were to be provided with food and bedding at the state's expense. Imprisonment for debt was to be abolished, and prisons themselves were to be institutions purely for the remand of prisoners awaiting trial.<br>
<br>In September 1646 Overton published the first of his signed Leveller tracts, <span class="italic">A Defiance Against All Arbitrary Usurpations</span>, calling for the removal of all tyrants, whether &#145;Royall, Lordly or Clericall&#146;. This was followed in October by <span class="italic">An Arrow Against All Tyrants</span>, a pamphlet which completed Overton's contribution to political theory. It restated his theory of political trusteeship, but it also developed one of the earliest statements of what has been called the theory of &#145;possessive individualism&#146;, a theory which was later to be expounded by John Locke and which became central to eighteenth-century political thought. Overton argued that everyone possesses a &#145;self-propriety&#146; or right of property in their own person. This self-propriety was inalienable and it formed the basis of all other political rights.<br>
<br>On 3 November 1646 Overton appealed to a Commons' committee for protecting the liberties of the subject, chaired by the republican Henry Marten. The committee found him guilty of nothing, but nevertheless recommitted him to Newgate. Overton refused to co-operate, and his gaolers were forced to carry him, beating him along the way. His copy of Coke's <span class="italic">Institutes</span> was confiscated, and he was put in leg-irons.<br>
<br>Overton may have collaborated with Henry Marten on <span class="italic">Vox plebis</span> (1646), and later that month he published <span class="italic">An Unhappy Game of Scotch and English</span>, a savage attack on the Scottish presbyterians which the Commons condemned to be burned on 30 November. He was also the probable author of <span class="italic">Regall Tyrannie Discovered</span>, published in January 1647 (often attributed to Lilburne, despite his own disclaimer), the first Leveller pamphlet to call for the execution of the king. The Lords condemned this pamphlet as treasonous, ordering the arrest of anyone involved in its publication. On 6 January officers of the Stationers' Company raided Overton's house where they discovered his wife and his brother Thomas stitching copies of the offending pamphlet. Mary and Thomas were arrested and taken before the Lords where they refused to answer interrogatories. As a result Thomas and Mary, accompanied by her six-month-old baby, were consigned on the same day to Maiden Lane prison; Mary's three older children were left in the care of Overton's sister and brother-in-law. On the following day a second raid was mounted in search of Overton's sister and her husband, but both escaped. Overton condemned the treatment of his family in <span class="italic">The Commoners Complaint</span> (1647), describing how on 7 January the Lords ordered his wife, a &#145;poore little harmlesse innocent woman&#146; with a &#145;tender Babe on her breast&#146;  (p. 18), to &#145;be cast into the most infamous Goale of <i>Bride-well</i>, that common Centre and receptacle of bauds, whores, and strumpets&#146;  (p. 17). When Mary refused to obey the order she was<blockquote>drag'd &hellip; headlong upon the stones in all the dirt and mire of the streetes, with the poore Infant still crying and mourning in her Armes &hellip; and all the way as they went, utterly to defame and render her infamous &hellip; the fellowes which dragged &hellip; her on two Cudgels, calling her <i>Strumpet</i> and vild [<i>sic</i>] <i>Whore</i> &hellip; a sufficient matter to blast her reputation for ever &hellip; and this is the honour that their Lordships are pleased to conferre on the free Commoners wives who stand for their Freedoms and Liberties. (<span class="italic">Commoners Complaint</span>, 1647, 19&#150;20)</blockquote>In March Overton drew up <span class="italic">The Humble Appeale and Petition of Mary Overton</span> on his wife's behalf, a pamphlet which was more an attack on the Lords and Commons than an appeal for clemency. Mary herself petitioned the Lords privately in April, by which time her infant child had died.<br>
<br>In February Overton and Lilburne collaborated on <span class="italic">The Out-Cryes of the Oppressed Commons</span>, arguing that arbitrary government had dissolved the social contract and returned the people to a state of nature, enabling them legitimately to draw up a new constitution. The Commons' refusal to hear petitions was condemned, and the right of petitioning was to be a prominent concern of Overton's subsequent writings; as presbyterian critics were to note, Overton and other Levellers tended to reduce parliament's proper role to that of ratifying mass petitions, provided they had been openly and fully debated.<br>
<br>In March 1647 the Levellers began their major petitioning campaign with the circulation of the large petition; a number of Levellers were subsequently arrested. In April Overton published <span class="italic">A New Found Stratagem</span>, which vigorously defended the right of petitioning parliament. This pamphlet was primarily addressed to the army, and its distribution among the soldiery led to the arrest of two officers. <span class="italic">A New Found Stratagem</span> voiced the grievances that were coalescing in the agitator movement; the presbyterian plan to disband the New Model Army should be abandoned and the soldiers should receive their arrears of pay. It also made the first tentative appeal to the army to become the arbiter of revolution.<br>
<br>Overton renewed his call for the army to intervene in the affairs of the nation in <span class="italic">An Appeale from the Degenerate Representative Body</span> (1647), which explicitly called for the House of Commons to be purged of its &#145;putrified and corrupt members&#146;. Apart from attempting to forge closer links between the Levellers and the New Model's agitator organization, this pamphlet also demonstrates the flexibility of Overton's political strategy, since it contains a remarkable passage calling on the nation to rise up and free the king from his parliamentary captors. It also develops Overton's theory of law, the legitimacy of which derives from its conformity with &#145;common equity and right reason&#146; rather than on the legislative body that enacts it. Overton's appeal to reason has been widely misinterpreted as evidence of his rationalism; his concept of reason, like that of other General Baptists, in fact has mystical overtones, virtually identifying it with the spirit of God working in the human soul.<br>
<br>At the end of the <span class="italic">Appeale</span> Overton appended &#145;Certain articles for the good of the common wealth&#146;, in effect a first draft of the series of constitutions proposed by the Levellers between November 1647 and May 1649. Legislative authority was to reside in a single elected chamber, members of which were to be supervised by county commissioners throughout their term of office. The law was to be administered in monthly or twice-monthly hundredal courts, the officers of which were to be elected. All laws were to be written in English and there was to be full equality before the law. Prisons were to be reformed along the lines already suggested in <span class="italic">Liberty Vindicated Against Slavery</span>, but with specific recommendations for alternatives to the purely punitive function of prisons. A first offence of theft was to be punished by forced labour, with thieves compensating their victims; a second offence would result in branding, and a sentence of &#145;perpetual servitude&#146; was to be imposed on anyone offending for a third time. Overton also makes a number of economic and social recommendations, including the throwing open of enclosures, a rural grievance which attracted little attention among the Levellers. Monopolies were to be abolished and there was to be complete freedom of trade. There were to be no tithes and glebe lands were to be used to finance &#145;hospitals&#146; (for the poor rather than the sick). A system of schools should be established throughout the country to ensure basic literacy for all &#145;the free men of England&#146;.<br>
<br>Overton was released from prison on 16 September 1647, and from early November he and Lilburne were reported to be involved in a series of City meetings with army agitators at The Mouth in Aldersgate Street and the Windmill Tavern in Coleman Street. He also accompanied Lilburne to Ware in Hertfordshire on 15 November, in the vicinity of the Leveller-inspired mutiny at Corkbush Field. After the failure of the mutiny there is no certain information about Overton until April 1648, when the agitators were renewing their efforts to gain control of the army; on 18 April Overton consulted the astrologer William Lilly, asking for advice on whether or not to support the agitators.<br>
<br>Overton may have contributed to the Leveller petition of 18 January 1648 and may have written <span class="italic">The Mournfull Cryes of Many Thousand Poore Tradesmen</span> (1648), both of which express the lively sympathy for the poor which can be found in his other writings. Throughout 1648 there is an apparent decline in his literary output. This may reflect disillusionment on his part, or he may have been devoting his energies to committee work for the Leveller organization, which was acquiring a more formal structure at this time. The Levellers also established their own newspaper, <span class="italic">The Moderate</span>, in July 1648, and several of the paper's leaders between October 1648 and April 1649 have been attributed to Overton. These leaders are more radical than contemporary writings by other Leveller leaders, but are consistent with Overton's known opinions. Whereas Lilburne opposed the trial and execution of the king, for example, Overton and the editor of <span class="italic">The Moderate</span> supported it as necessary for securing English liberties. <span class="italic">The Moderate</span>'s editorials at this time are also characterized by an emphasis on the economic grievances of the people.<br>
<br>On 14 December 1648 Overton was at Whitehall during the debate between army grandees, Levellers, and City Independents concerning the settlement of the nation through a Leveller-inspired constitution, the <span class="italic">Agreement of the People</span>. The specific question on that day was what power, if any, the representative should have over religious matters. Overton and Lilburne withdrew after the first session, having been under the impression that the content of the <span class="italic">Agreement</span>, including a clause denying the magistrate any power in the religious sphere, had been agreed at earlier discussions. Although their Leveller colleagues Walwyn and John Wildman chose to attend the debate on 18 December, the discussions at Whitehall ended in failure for the Levellers. On 28 December Lilburne and Overton were among a Leveller deputation that delivered a petition to General Fairfax, protesting at the officers' alteration of the <span class="italic">Agreement</span>, published the same day as <span class="italic">A Plea for Common Right and Freedom</span>.<br>
<br>While Oliver Cromwell and his allies were overthrowing the monarchy in January 1649 the Levellers as a whole remained puzzlingly quiescent, but on 3 March Overton published a <span class="italic">Humble Petition</span> in which he commended the purging of parliament and execution of the king, while at the same time condemning the new council of state. Following the court martial of five troopers for organizing a petition critical of the new military regime, Overton mounted a more vigorous attack in <span class="italic">The Hunting of the Foxes</span> (March), warning that Cromwell was simply aspiring to replace the old monarchy with &#145;a new regality&#146;.<br>
<br>On 24 March 1649 Lilburne published <span class="italic">The Second Part of Englands New-Chaines Discovered</span>, and the Rump Parliament declared its supposed authors to be guilty of high treason; as a consequence, Lilburne, Overton, Walwyn, and Thomas Prince were arrested on 28 March. The prisoners were taken before the council of state and, after refusing to answer any questions, dispatched to the Tower. In April Lilburne, Overton, and Prince recounted the story of their arrest and interrogation in <span class="italic">The Picture of the Councel of State</span>. In his contribution Overton states that an unfinished manuscript of a treatise called &#145;Gods word confirmed by his works&#146; was seized; his account of this text suggests that it was a fairly typical specimen of natural theology, attempting to prove the truth of Christian revelation on the basis of natural phenomena.<br>
<br>All four Leveller prisoners subscribed a <span class="italic">Manifestation</span> on 14 April (probably written by Walwyn), calling for a third and final <span class="italic">Agreement of the People</span>; this was duly published on 1 May, again subscribed by all four men. A month later Overton and Lilburne published a joint protest against the execution of a parliamentarian soldier, Robert Lockyer, for his part in a small London mutiny on 24 April.<br>
<br>In May 1649 another Leveller-inspired mutiny broke out at Salisbury, and was ultimately suppressed at Burford. Among the leaders of the mutiny was Henry Denne, who had been associated with Overton throughout his career as a General Baptist and Leveller. Denne earned a reprieve by issuing a denunciation of the Levellers, prompting Overton to condemn him bitterly in <span class="italic">Overton's Defiance of the Act of Pardon</span>; he also defended himself from accusations by the Levellers based at the Whalebone Tavern that he had ceased to be politically active. The Whalebone Tavern Levellers were offended by certain remarks in this pamphlet, especially a reference to seizing the bull of Bashan (Cromwell) by his genitals. In his last signed pamphlet, <span class="italic">The Baiting of the Great Bull of Bashan</span> (1649), Overton defended his sense of humour and condemned the Whalebone Tavern Levellers for their own cowardice and apathy.<h2>
<a name="Laterlife"></a>Later life</h2>Overton and the other Leveller leaders were released from the Tower on 8 November 1649, following Lilburne's acquittal on charges of treason. A condition for their release was that they should take the oath of engagement to the new regime; according to a royalist satirist Overton agreed to take the engagement, adding the promise to be as faithful to his oath as the present council of state had been to the solemn league and covenant (i.e., not at all).<br>
<br>Various Leveller petitions of 1650&#150;51 have been attributed to Overton, as has <span class="italic">Vox plebis</span> (1653), an attack on the Rump, but there is no firm evidence for these attributions. He was present at Lilburne's trial in June&#150;August 1653. He tried unsuccessfully to secure a lawyer for Lilburne, delivered a letter to one of the judges and was part of a deputation presenting a petition to parliament on Lilburne's behalf.<br>
<br>In December 1653 Overton was paid &pound;20 by Cromwell's secretary of state, John Thurloe. This may have been in connection with Edward Sexby's mission to the Huguenots in Bordeaux, but the evidence also suggests that Overton was by this time acting as a double agent. On 6 September 1654 Overton again offered his services to Thurloe in connection with a conspiracy against the government. Shortly afterwards a plot led by Wildman and Sexby was discovered; Sexby fled to Amsterdam, where he was joined by Overton in February 1655. While in Holland, Overton and Sexby entered into a conspiracy with Sir Marmaduke Langdale and other exiled royalists. The plot collapsed in November, apparently because of Sexby's republicanism; Langdale reported that Overton himself was more favourable to the king's cause.<br>
<br>Overton subsequently returned to England and lodged with Colonel William Wetton in Bedford Street, London, in 1655. It was at this time that he published the revised version of his mortalist treatise, <span class="italic">Man Wholly Mortal</span>. He may have taken part in the republican campaign for the good old cause in 1659, but none of the pamphlets attributed to him at that time belongs unquestionably in his <i>&#339;uvre</i>. He was, however, imprisoned for some unspecified offence in 1659, and the restored Rump ordered an investigation of his committal on 30 December. In 1662 Overton was living in Kennington, but he had moved by the time that a new warrant for his arrest was issued on 22 October 1663. It is not known why this warrant was issued, but the simultaneous order for the arrest of the radical publisher Elizabeth Calvert suggests that it may have been on account of subversive publications; alternatively, it may simply have been as part of the general crack-down on known radicals following the Derwentside plot. No other direct evidence on Overton's life exists, but unsold copies of <span class="italic">Man Wholly Mortal</span> were reissued with a new title-page in 1674. No more is heard of Mary Overton by name after 1647, but in a letter of 13 September 1655 Overton mentioned his intention of going to Rotterdam to meet his wife.<h2>
<a name="Historicalsignificance"></a>Historical significance</h2>Overton played a decisive role in the Leveller's history although on occasions he was as much an embarrassment as an asset; both opponents and some fellow-Levellers criticized the vulgarity of his humour, and there were rumours that he led a sexually dissolute life. Accounts of the Levellers have concentrated on Lilburne's role and tended to neglect that of Overton, but it was Overton who may have been primarily responsible for publishing their first full and coherent programmes. He was also significant in giving greater emphasis than his fellow-Levellers to social and economic policy in his programmatic statements. He was particularly concerned with the abolition of imprisonment for debt, the reform of the poor relief system, and the establishment of a national education system. He was also one of the few Levellers to address such rural grievances as enclosure, calling for a redistribution of land. Overton is rightly regarded as the Levellers' principal theoretician, since his writings contain the fullest and most coherent exploration of the philosophical basis of the Leveller programme. Overton also seems to have played a leading role in devising the Levellers' strategy of attempting to make the army an instrument for implementing the Leveller programme between 1647 and 1649.<br>
