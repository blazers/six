<span class="headword">Selby,  Walford Dakin</span>  (1845&#150;1889), <span class="occ">archivist and historian</span>, was born at home on 16 June 1845, the eldest son of Thomas Selby of Whitley and Wimbush Hall, Essex, and his wife, Elizabeth, youngest daughter and coheir of Ralph Foster of Holderness, Yorkshire. His great-great-grandfather had taken the name Selby by royal licence in 1783, but the family name was originally Browne, and they claimed descent from the Brownes, viscounts Montagu. Selby once pursued a claim to that dormant peerage, but abandoned it as he was unable to prove a marriage on which the claim rested. He was educated successively at Brighton College, Tonbridge School, and with Dr Stromberg at Bonn, where he studied German and French.<br>
<br>In 1867 Selby became a junior clerk in the Public Record Office, where he ultimately became superintendent of the literary search-room. In 1882 his standing in the antiquarian world was recognized by a pay rise of &pound;50 a year. In 1883, in conjunction with his friend James Greenstreet, he founded the Pipe Roll Society, of which he was director-in-chief and honorary treasurer until his death. At the Public Record Office he was known for his courtesy and a minute knowledge of the records under his charge. From 1884 to April 1889 he edited <span class="italic">The Genealogist</span>, and he was a frequent contributor to <span class="italic">The Athenaeum</span>, <span class="italic">The Academy</span>, <span class="italic">The Antiquary</span>, <span class="italic">Antiquarian Magazine</span>, and other periodicals. His papers on <span class="italic">The Robbery of Chaucer at Hatcham</span> and <span class="italic">Chaucer as Forester of North Petherton</span> (1886) were published in a series of <span class="italic">Life-Records of Chaucer</span>, which he edited for the Chaucer Society from 1875. He compiled <span class="italic">The Jubilee Date Book</span> (1887) and edited <span class="italic">Lancashire and Cheshire Records</span>, (2 pts, 1882&#150;3), and <span class="italic">Norfolk Records</span>, with Walter Rye (1886). In 1875 he published a second edition of the <span class="italic">Book of Rules and Tables for Verifying Dates</span> by his colleague John Bond. At the time of his death he was preparing a new edition of the <span class="roman">Red Book of the Exchequer</span>, which was completed by Hubert Hall, an edition of Queen Elizabeth's manuscript translation of Boethius's <span class="italic">De consolatione philosophiae</span>, and a new index to the <span class="italic">Inquisitiones post mortem</span>. He contracted typhoid fever in November 1888 and while the balance of his mind was disturbed by the illness, he cut his throat and died at his home, 9 Clyde Street, Redcliffe Gardens, South Kensington, on 3 August 1889. It was suggested that the fever had been caused by poor sanitary conditions at the Public Record Office. He was buried on 8 August 1889 at Kensal Green cemetery.<br>
