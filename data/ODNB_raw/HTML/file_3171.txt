<span class="headword">Bradock <span class="st"> [Braddocke]</span>,  John</span>  (1655/6&#150;1719), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and theological author</span>, was born in Shropshire; his parents' names are not known. On 6 May 1671 he was admitted as a pensioner to St Catharine's College, Cambridge. Having matriculated in 1673 he graduated BA in 1675, proceeded MA in 1678, and held a fellowship from 1680 until 1688. In 1687 the university vice-chancellor sent him, together with George Stanhope, with letters to James II's ministers petitioning the king to revoke a mandate to confer a degree of MA on a Benedictine monk without the statutory oaths being taken.<br>
<br>About 1689 Bradock moved to Kent, where he became chaplain to Sir James Oxenden, bt, of Dene, and curate to John Batteley, rector of Adisham. In 1694 he was nominated by the archbishop of Canterbury, Thomas Tenison, to the perpetual curacy of Folkestone, which he resigned for the vicarage of St Stephen alias Hackington, to which he was presented by Batteley, archdeacon of Canterbury, on 30 March 1699. In 1703 he was appointed one of the Six Preachers of Canterbury Cathedral. Ofspring Blackall, his friend and contemporary at St Catharine's, made him his chaplain when he became bishop of Exeter in 1708, although &#145;he got nothing by it, but the Title&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 5863, fol. 114<i>v</i>). He was collated to the mastership of Eastbridge Hospital, Canterbury, on 12 January 1710.<br>
<br>Bradock wrote <span class="italic">The doctrine of the fathers and the schools consider'd: concerning the articles of a Trinity of divine persons and the unity of God</span>, part the first (1695). In it he defended William Sherlock's <span class="italic">Vindication of the Doctrine of the Holy and Ever Blessed Trinity</span> (1690), against Robert South's <span class="italic">Animadversions upon Dr Sherlock's Book</span> (1693). Examining patristic, scholastic, and later writers on the Trinity he aimed to demonstrate that &#145;<i>Three Divine Persons</i> may be orthodoxly stiled <i>Three Infinite Minds or Spirits</i>&#146;  (p. iv). He was answered by Thomas Holdsworth in <span class="italic">Impar conatui</span> (1695). The proposed second part concerning the unity of God, <span class="italic">Deus unus et trinus</span>, was almost ready for publication when it was suppressed at the direction of Archbishop Tenison, who did not wish the controversy prolonged. James Bonnell wrote to John Strype in 1699 that he feared Bradock was &#145;warping towards Socinianism, by an Account he gave me of Something he was about to publish&#146;.<br>
<br>Bradock died at his vicarage on 14 August 1719, aged sixty-three, and was buried in the chancel of Hackington church.<br>
