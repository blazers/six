<span class="headword">Shute,  Robert</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1590), <span class="occ">judge</span>, was born at Gargrave in Yorkshire but his father, Christopher Shute, resided at Oakington, Cambridgeshire, and it was there that Robert made his home. Cooper said he was probably educated at Christ's College, Cambridge, perhaps because it was his son's college, though he is more likely the Shutte admitted as a scholar of Peterhouse in 1542 or 1544. What is known for certain is that he studied at Barnard's Inn in the late 1540s before being admitted to Gray's Inn in 1550. He was doubtless patronized by his neighbour Sir John Hynde, justice of the common pleas and former bencher of Gray's Inn, whose widow left Shute &pound;4 a year in 1555, &#145;towardes his fyndynge at the innes of court&#146;  (TNA: PRO, PROB 11/37, fol. 262). By 1557 he was an ancient of Gray's Inn, and the following year the borough of Cambridge elected him as their recorder in succession to George Freville. He made a Latin oration to the queen when she visited Cambridge in 1564, and represented Cambridge in the parliaments of 1571 and 1572&#150;81. In November 1577 he was created serjeant-at-law, his patrons being Lord Burghley and Lord North, and gave a double reading in Gray's Inn as serjeant-elect.<br>
<br>Shute's appointment as second baron of the exchequer on 1 June 1579 made a new departure. Until then the junior barons had never been serjeants and therefore did not go on circuit as assize judges, associate with the judges of the coif in the serjeants' inns (except by invitation), or wear full judicial robes with linings. After Shute the barons were always serjeants and became full members of the higher judiciary. Shute's patent gave him &#145;the same order, rank, estimation, dignity, and pre-eminence&#146; as the puisne justices of the benches, and an increased stipend of &pound;80, though parity of stipend with the other courts was not reached until 1645. On 8 February 1585 Shute was translated to the queen's bench, with arrears of salary from the death of his predecessor, William Ayloffe, in November 1584. On his deathbed, on 14 April 1590, he said to his wife, Thomasine, &#145;Thou haste ben a good wife to me and I have ben true to the, and I do give the all my worldlie goodes&#146;  (TNA: PRO, PROB 11/75, fol. 236). This nuncupative will was proved on 5 May. Thomasine was the daughter of Christopher Burgoyne of Long Stanton, Cambridgeshire. She was the judge's only wife, and they had at least eight children. The eldest son, Francis, settled at Upton, Leicestershire, and was the ancestor of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1531/', "John Shute Barrington, first Viscount Barrington (1678&#150;1734)")</script>. Shute was probably buried at Oakington.<br>
<br>Shute's fourth son, <a name="cosubject_25487"></a><span class="headword">Robert Shute</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1621)<span class="occ"></span>, matriculated from Christ's College, Cambridge, in 1598, and graduated bachelor of arts in 1601&#150;2. He was admitted to Gray's Inn in 1600 and called to the bar in 1605. He seems to have lived a disreputable life; he became heavily in debt, and was outlawed seventeen times. Attaching himself to George Villiers, the future duke of Buckingham, he secured through his influence the chief clerkship of the king's bench (jointly with Robert Heath) in 1616, under a settlement by John Roper, first Lord Teynham, against the wishes of Sir Edward Coke. On the death of Richard Martin in 1618, Shute became the court candidate for the recordership of London, but was refused on account of his past and Heath was elected instead. In 1620 Shute's reputation underwent a change. During Lent he delivered a reading in Gray's Inn, where he had been a bencher since 1617, and on 29 December he was returned to parliament for St Albans. John Lewis dedicated <span class="italic">Ignis coelestis</span> to him the same year. The recordership becoming vacant again on Heath's appointment as solicitor-general, Shute was elected on 20 January 1621, the king remarking that, although there was formerly some colour for the objections against him, &#145;there was none now, besides which he hath since been reader of that society, whereby he hath given public satisfaction of his worth and ability in that profession&#146;  (Overall, 294, 303). However, he died within a few days of achieving his ambition, before 10 February.<br>
