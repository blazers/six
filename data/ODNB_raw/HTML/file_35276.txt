<span class="headword">O'Brien,  Charlotte Grace</span>  (1845&#150;1909), <span class="occ">author and social reformer</span>, born on 23 November 1845 at Cahirmoyle, co. Limerick, was the younger daughter in a family of five sons and two daughters of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20471/', "William Smith O'Brien (1803&#150;1864)")</script>, Irish nationalist, and his wife, Lucy Caroline (<i>d</i>. 1861), eldest daughter of Joseph Gabbett, of High Park, co. Limerick. She was educated at St Columba's College, Rathfarnham, near Dublin, and privately. Smith O'Brien had been transported to Van Diemen's Land after the 1848 rebellion, and on his release in 1854, his daughter joined him in Brussels, and stayed there until he was allowed to return to Cahirmoyle in 1856. After her mother's death in 1861 she and her father moved to Killiney, near Dublin, and she lived with him until his death at Bangor, Wales, in 1864. From 1864 she lived at Cahirmoyle with her brother Edward, a widower, caring for his children, until his remarriage in 1880. She then went to live at Foynes, co. Limerick, and there devoted herself to writing.<br>
<br>Charlotte O'Brien was a committed nationalist, supported the Land League, and opposed the 1881 <span class="roman">Coercion Act</span>. She contributed articles and letters to the <span class="italic">Nineteenth Century</span> and the <span class="italic">Pall Mall Gazette</span>, attacking the government's Irish policies, in 1880 and 1881.<br>
<br>One particular interest, however, increasingly occupied her time. The disastrous harvest in Ireland in 1879, combined with Irish political unrest led to a sharp rise in the number of emigrants to America. At Queenstown, co. Cork, the port of embarkation, women emigrants suffered greatly from overcrowded lodgings and from robbery. Charlotte O'Brien's article in the <span class="italic">Pall Mall Gazette</span> (6 May 1881) led to an investigation of the White Star Line by the Board of Trade, and the enforcement of the law on lodging-houses. In 1881 she founded a boarding-house at Queenstown to receive and protect women about to emigrate. In order to improve the steamship accommodation for women emigrants, and to study their prospects, she made several steerage passages to America. In New York she founded another boarding-house for women.<br>
<br>When she retired in 1886 Charlotte O'Brien returned to Ardanoir, Foynes, on the bank of the Shannon, to write and to study plant life; she contributed articles on the flora of the Shannon district to the <span class="italic">Irish Naturalist</span>. In 1887 she converted to Roman Catholicism. She died on 3 June 1909 at her home, Ardanoir, Foynes, and was buried at Knockpatrick.<br>
<br>O'Brien's contributions to <span class="italic">The Nation</span> and to <span class="italic">United Ireland</span> were vigorous and direct. As well as writing for the periodical press, she wrote fiction, drama, and poetry. Her novel <span class="italic">Light and Shade</span> (1878) was based on the recollections of the Fenian leaders whom she knew, and deals with events in the 1867 rising. In <span class="italic">Lyrics</span> (1886) she wrote nationalist ballads and poems describing emigrant life. She wrote a series of sonnets in praise of W. E. Gladstone, collected by Stephen Gwyn (1909), and corresponded with him. Works by Charlotte O'Brien have been incorrectly attributed to Charlotte Grace O'Brien.<br>
