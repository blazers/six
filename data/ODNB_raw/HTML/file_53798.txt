<span class="headword">Kinnear,  Georgina</span>  (1826/1828&#150;1914), <span class="occ">headmistress</span>, was born in Edinburgh, the second of the seven children of John Gardiner Kinnear and his wife, Mary, the daughter of banker Alexander Smith. About 1832 the family moved to Glasgow, where John Kinnear became the partner in a firm of commission merchants and power-loom manufacturers. The only one of their children to marry was the eldest sister, Marion, who married Robert Lockhart, a brother of Sir Walter Scott's son-in-law. The younger brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/34331/', "Alexander Smith Kinnear")</script>, became Baron Kinnear of Spurness and senator of the college of justice. Aptly, he chaired the Scottish universities commission of 1889 that passed the ordinance admitting women to degrees and university classes.<br>
<br>Georgina Kinnear never went to school, receiving the usual superficial education of girls of her time. But she was a natural student. While quite a young child she developed the habit of getting up about 5 a.m. to sit wrapped in a shawl reading, and it was a habit she retained to within a few years of her death. She learned languages from her brothers' tutors, but owed most to her own efforts and industry and instinctive knowledge of how to learn. As was the convention of the time, when older she travelled widely in Europe and became fluent in French and German and later Russian.<br>
<br>In 1860 Miss Kinnear, by then in her thirties, was &#145;permitted&#146; by her parents to travel with family friends, Lord and Lady Napier, to The Hague to assist with the education of their sons. The following year Napier was appointed ambassador at St Petersburg. Miss Kinnear accompanied his family there and immediately began to study the Russian language and culture. When the Napier's sons went to school she transferred herself to the family of Nikolay Milyutin, a reforming minister under Tsar Alexander II. According to Miss Kinnear's cousin, Marion Murray, Milyutin frequently consulted Miss Kinnear, particularly about British political methods. She later returned to Russia after his death, spending several summers with Mme Milyutin and her daughters in the interior of Russia or in the Crimea. She saw and learned much about the life of the peasants, for whom she had a high esteem: &#145;They are a fine people and only need education&#146;  (Murray, 529).<br>
<br>It was, however, the secondary and higher education of women and girls that was of particular interest to Miss Kinnear. Alice Younger believed that during a visit to London in the 1860s Miss Kinnear assisted in some of the inquiries on which the women's evidence to the schools inquiry commission was based  (<span class="italic">The Park School, Glasgow, 1880&#150;1930</span>, 23). Wishing to become acquainted with the practical organization of a large school, she joined the staff of Cheltenham Ladies' College under Dorothea Beale in 1874. There she made such an impact that, when Louisa Lumsden (also a teacher there) was appointed headmistress of the new St Andrews School for Girls (later St Leonards School) in 1877, at her strong recommendation Miss Kinnear was made the fourth founder member of the staff.<br>
<br>In 1880 Miss Kinnear was selected from fifty candidates to be the first headmistress of the Park School, Glasgow, founded by the newly established Glasgow Girls' School Company. Appointed at a salary of &pound;400, she remained in the post for twenty years. She was left without interference by the directors to manage the school as she wished, and pupils, staff, and inspectors alike agreed that her inexhaustible questing spirit permeated the whole atmosphere of the school. Having taken up schoolteaching late in a life much involved in thinking about educational matters, and after experiencing other cultures and conventions, she had her own decided views on educational methods and aims, in many of which she differed from the conventional wisdom of even the reformers of the day.<br>
<br>Miss Kinnear herself taught English and history in a style more appropriate for a university and often above the understanding of most of her pupils. Nevertheless they found her lessons immensely stimulating. Her battle cry was &#145;think for yourself&#146;, and her &#145;Whys?&#146;, thrown into lessons on the most taken for granted of subjects, encouraged pupils to do just that. She disapproved of examinations on intellectual grounds, but reluctantly accepted them as practical means of forwarding girls' educational standards, and Park pupils who entered public examinations did well. Pupils went on to enter the Oxbridge women's colleges or Queen Margaret College, Glasgow, before the opening of the Scottish universities to women in 1892. Miss Kinnear believed in keeping school and play hours separate and disliked homework as she felt this encouraged desultory habits of work. Like many Scots she preferred day schools to boarding-schools. She also held strong views on adequate pay and refused part of her salary so that no member of staff should be underpaid.<br>
<br>Miss Kinnear was an ardent Liberal and reformer. She only once attended the headmistresses' conference, and then said nothing because she disagreed with so much, particularly the complacency of the participants as to the progress of women's education. &#145;Compare the number of men and women students in the Universities; when there are more women than men, as there ought to be, we may begin to speak of progress&#146;  (Murray, 529). She was described by an early Park pupil as &#145;a charming but formidable woman, full of new ideas of a woman's place in the world&#146;  (Lightwood, 29).<br>
<br>Miss Kinnear was small, with a dignified but rather old-fashioned appearance. She had dark, piercing eyes and a wonderful smile which occasionally lit her face. She always dressed in black, with a fine lace collar held in place by a flashing diamond and a lace cap over thick braids of dark hair. She would rustle into the classroom in full silk skirt with a swinging step and hoist herself onto the high chair at the desk, giving a little kick to get into position. She had great tolerance and a high sense of justice. She was concerned with overall schemes, not petty matters: &#145;It is of no significance, my dear&#146; was an often-used phrase. She treated the girls as equals, though they in turn regarded her with a mixture of awe and fear. She aimed at instilling religious and moral principles, a love of study, and habits of diligence, concentration, and self-control in her pupils. She was kind, always willing to help, insightful about character, and unselfconscious about herself.<br>
<br>A natural, self-taught intellectual, Miss Kinnear loved history, especially the Elizabethan period, Russian politics, the <span class="roman">Old Testament</span> (which she interpreted as a dramatic picture of human life), and the growth and structure of a language (she published privately in 1904 a grammar book quite incomprehensible to most of her pupils, <span class="italic">The Use of Words</span>). She was a fine needlewoman and loved walking, which was her only exercise. Above all she was a brilliant talker, combining graphic description with keen analysis and illustrating her remarks with shrewd and humorous comments, the words flowing so rapidly listeners had difficulty keeping up with her.<br>
<br>When Miss Kinnear retired she drew up an elaborate scheme of study for herself, but could not pursue it, for her health broke down shortly after she moved back to Edinburgh to live with her remaining family. For the next fourteen years she lived a restricted and latterly invalid life, reverting in her final illness to speaking much of the time in Russian. She died on 26 April 1914 at her home, 11 Darnaway Street, Edinburgh, and was buried three days later at the city's St George's Church.<br>
