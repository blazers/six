<span class="headword">Lyttelton <span class="st"> [Littelton]</span>, Sir  Charles</span>, third baronet  (1629&#150;1716), <span class="occ">colonial governor and politician</span>, was born in Frankley, Worcestershire, a younger son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17309/', "Sir Thomas Lyttelton, first baronet (1595/6&#150;1650)")</script>, royalist officer and politician, and Catherine Crompton (<i>d</i>. 1666). As a member of a substantial county family which by the next century had developed into &#145;a powerful Whig cousinhood&#146;  (Montgomery-Massingberd, 92), Lyttelton committed himself wholeheartedly to the royalist cause; he served in the royalist forces at Colchester in 1648, and after their defeat escaped to France, where in 1650 he was appointed cupbearer to the exiled Charles II. He appears to have served as a messenger between the king and his English supporters during the late 1650s, and after the Restoration Charles II recognized his services by knighting him in 1662. That same year Lyttelton and Katherine Fairfax (<i>d</i>. 1663), whom he had married in 1661, departed for Jamaica, where Lyttelton was to serve as lieutenant-governor to Thomas Windsor, seventh Baron Windsor. In the course of the voyage Katherine gave birth to the couple's first child, a son, but neither mother nor infant survived for long; both died in January 1663 and were interred in the cathedral at Spanish Town, Jamaica.<br>
<br>By that time Lyttelton had succeeded to the governorship of Jamaica, Windsor having turned the office over to him on 20 October 1662, a mere ten weeks after the two men's arrival on the island. Lyttelton immediately set to work on the project of developing a full civil government for encouraging English settlement of the colony, which England had acquired from Spain in 1655. He was instrumental in the creation of an island assembly, a body which was &#145;fairly and indifferently drawn by the votes of all the inhabitants&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>), and which was responsible for dealing with the colony's financial and legal needs. The assembly passed legislation regarding taxation, hunting, and planting, and set up religious and judicial authorities throughout the island, creating an infrastructure upon which the following decades' prosperity was based. Lyttelton also made Jamaica's internal and external security a priority, granting letters of marque to English privateers, with the intent that they serve as a striking force against potential Spanish and Dutch attacks. He entered into negotiations with the Maroons, African slaves who had run away from Spanish plantations and frequently attacked English settlements, granting them landholdings and promising them &#145;the same state and freedom as the English enjoy&#146;  (Dunn, 242) provided that they cease their raids. Not all Maroons were willing to accept the offer, but enough did so that the threat they posed diminished sufficiently for planters to become more willing to settle in remote areas of the island. Lyttelton's other activities as governor included establishing a town and fortifications at Port Royal, erecting Fort Charles, and repairing St Katherine's Church, in Spanish Town.<br>
<br>In Lyttelton's opinion, the English settlers were &#145;generally easy to be governed, yet rather by persuasion then severity&#146;  (Cundall, <span class="italic">The Governors of Jamaica</span>, 19), and local residents asserted that under his administration Jamaica was peaceful, healthy, and prosperous. None the less, on 13 February 1664 the king recalled Lyttelton and issued a warrant for Sir Thomas Modyford to assume the office of governor. On 2 May of that year Lyttelton sailed for England, where he was commissioned as major and subsequently lieutenant-colonel of the lord admiral's regiment, precursor to the Royal Marines. He served as governor of Harwich and Landguard Fort, and then of Sheerness, and after 1682 he and Sir William Beeston acceded to the request of the governor and council of Jamaica that they serve as the London agents for the colony. On 12 May 1685 he entered parliament as member for Bewdley, Worcestershire, a seat he retained until the revolution of 1688, at which time he resigned all of his appointments rather than subscribe to the oaths mandated by William and Mary. In 1693 Lyttelton's elder brother Henry died, allowing him to succeed to the family's title and estates. At this time Lyttelton, his second wife, Anne Temple (<i>d</i>. 1718), and their children settled at Hagley, Worcestershire, where Lyttelton spent the remainder of his life. He died at Hagley on 2 May 1716, and was buried with Anne in the vault at Over-Areley, Staffordshire.<br>
