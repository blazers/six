<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Mare,  Thomas  de la</span>  (<em>c.</em>1309&#150;1396), <span class="occ">abbot of St Albans</span>, was perhaps born in Northumberland, where he is known to have had family connections. He was related to several noble families: through his father, John de la Mare, and his mother, Joanna (both <i>c</i>.1275&#150;<i>c</i>.1340), daughter of Sir John Harpsfield, he claimed kinship with William Montagu, earl of Salisbury, William, Lord Zouche, and John Grandison, the distinguished bishop of Exeter.<h2>
<a name="Novicepriorandabbot"></a>Novice, prior, and abbot</h2>Thomas de la Mare was one of five children, and his three brothers and his sister followed him into the religious life, two brothers also becoming monks at St Albans. Nothing is known of his early life, but he probably studied for a time at a local grammar school. He must have entered St Albans in his late teens, because according to the <span class="italic">Gesta abbatum</span> he made his profession soon after the election of Abbot Richard of Wallingford in 1326. He passed his novitiate year at the abbey's dependent priory at Wymondham, Norfolk, and returned there after his profession to serve as chaplain to the prior. According to the <span class="italic">Gesta</span>, while at Wymondham, he also devoted himself to the study of the <i>ars dictaminis</i> and rhetoric and became so proficient in letter-writing that later, when he became abbot, he composed all his own letters himself, including correspondence with the pope.<br>
<br>De la Mare was recalled to St Albans in 1336 and was made an obedientary, serving first as kitchener and then in the more substantial office of cellarer. In 1340 he was appointed prior of the abbey's dependent priory at Tynemouth, Northumberland. Located near the Scottish border the community had suffered repeated attacks and had almost fallen into ruin. De la Mare appears to have succeeded in reviving both its material fortunes and religious life. He attracted the support of substantial local patrons, such as the Percys, to whom he became confessor, and implemented a series of wide-ranging internal reforms. In particular, he encouraged the monks to engage in intellectual activities and invited scholars from nearby houses to teach and preach in the community. He forged especially close links with the monks and scholars in the circle of the archbishop of York, John Thoresby, and with the Augustinian friars at the York convent, one of whom, Dr John Waldeby, later dedicated a series of homilies on the apostles' creed to de la Mare. In early 1349, following the death of Michael Mentmore, de la Mare returned to St Albans and was elected abbot. The black death was at its height, fifty monks in addition to Mentmore had died from the pestilence, and although he was not the preferred candidate, de la Mare seems to have emerged as the best prospect after the monks' first choice, Prior Henry Steukly, had himself fallen ill. Following his election de la Mare travelled to Avignon to receive papal benediction. Shortly after arrival he became ill, having drunk infected water. According to the <span class="italic">Gesta</span> he came near to death, but experienced a miraculous recovery through the agency of St Alban: despite this, news reached the abbey that he had died. Before his return de la Mare entered into negotiations with the authorities in the curia to secure confirmation of the abbey's many exemptions and privileges. His efforts were inconclusive, and so costly that no abbot travelled to the papacy again for eighty years.<h2>
<a name="ReformingabbotofStAlbans"></a>Reforming abbot of St Albans</h2>After his return to St Albans in 1350 de la Mare concentrated his energies on repairing the damage done to community life by the black death. In 1351 he issued a series of reforming constitutions for St Albans and its dependent cells. He also conducted a thorough visitation of all the communities and churches under his jurisdiction, and established an annual chapter at which disciplinary problems were resolved and further reforming constitutions ratified. The rigour of his administration was such that Thomas Walsingham compared his rule to that of Julius Caesar. In addition, he began a substantial programme of rebuilding, renewing the abbot's chambers, the cloister, the dormitory, and the infirmary, and constructing a fortified gatehouse at the main entrance to the abbey. He also sought to increase the community's income, both by improving the administration of his officials and through the acquisition of a wide range of properties in the St Albans area and in London: according to the <span class="italic">Gesta</span> he even surrendered some of his own income to increase the abbey's resources. De la Mare's efforts to revive the fortunes of St Albans also led him to enter into litigation with a considerable number of local landowners and tenants. He fought protracted and very public battles over rights, rents, and taxation with the king's escheator, John of Gaunt, duke of Lancaster, and Alice Perrers, as well as more local figures. His dispute with John Chiltern, a Langley tenant, continued for almost thirty years, between the 1360s and 1390s. He also brought actions against landowners and patrons who threatened the independence of the St Albans cells: his dispute with Henry Despenser, bishop of Norwich, over the latter's appointment of the prior of Binham as collector of a subsidy was only resolved through royal mediation.<br>
<br>In most of these disputes de la Mare emerged victorious, but the cost to the community was considerable and even at his death there remained debts arising from his litigation. De la Mare also continued to negotiate through his proctors in the curia for further confirmation of the abbey's exemptions, and before his death he had succeeded in securing several important new privileges, including certain episcopal rights for the abbot, release from the latter's obligation to receive papal benediction in person, and exemption from the reversion of abbatial resources to the crown during a vacancy. In the first decades of his administration de la Mare also dedicated himself to raising the profile of the shrine of St Albans. He encouraged pilgrimage to the church, inaugurating a lavish procession on the martyr's feast day and building extensive new accommodation for visitors: in 1368 the cort&egrave;ge bearing the body of Blanche, duchess of Lancaster, to London halted for a night's vigil at St Albans. About 1376 he refounded the abbey confraternity, and over the next decades attracted a succession of distinguished figures to become members, including Richard II, his mother, Joan of Kent, Robert de Vere, earl of Oxford, and Sir Lewis Clifford. About 1379 he attempted to establish a similar confraternity for the townsmen in the church of St Peter at St Albans, but their hostility forced him to abandon the project.<br>
<br>De la Mare was above all a determined administrator, but he also did much to encourage education and scholarship among his monks. He introduced a more rigorous curriculum of studies into the cloister and even taught liturgy and song himself. He also encouraged able monks to attend the universities, constructed separate chambers where they might pursue their studies, and made significant benefactions to Gloucester College, the Benedictine studium in Oxford. He bought and commissioned a large number of new books for use in the cloister, and in the 1370s constructed a new scriptorium in which, under the supervision of the chronicler Thomas Walsingham, a wide range of new books was compiled and copied. He also began work on a conventual library above the cloister, which was completed after his death. He was a supportive patron of his own monks' scholarship: he encouraged Walsingham in his historical writing, and between 1377 and 1385 he commissioned Nicholas Radcliffe to compile a series of dialogues on the errors of Wyclif. He also offered his patronage to other scholars and artists, attracting to St Albans such figures as the illuminator Alan Strayler, and the architect Henry Yevele.<h2>
<a name="SpokesmanfortheBenedictines"></a>Spokesman for the Benedictines</h2>In addition to his work for his own community de la Mare also pursued a very public career as a leader and spokesman for the Benedictine order in England. He served as president of the order's general chapter continuously from the 1350s to the end of the 1380s, and played a key role in its efforts to reform English communities. In 1363 he compiled and issued a series of statutes to reinvigorate monastic study at the universities, making substantial changes to the curriculum and requiring each community to support its students with sufficient funds. His reputation led Edward III in the 1360s to appoint him to conduct visitations and introduce reforms at Abingdon, Battle, Chester, Eynsham, and Reading. In the 1370s he was also called upon to settle a rebellion and supervise an abbatial election at Bury St Edmunds. He was, however, also a vigorous and vocal defender of the monasteries' traditional independence. In 1389 he intervened on behalf of Gloucester College in its dispute with William Courtenay, archbishop of Canterbury, over a threatened visitation, and persuaded Courtenay to abandon his plans not only in Oxford but with regard to all exempt houses within his province.<br>
<br>In his defence of his own house and of his order as a whole de la Mare benefited from close relations with the crown&#151;he seems to have been on intimate terms with Edward III almost from the time of his election. Walsingham recalls the &#145;great love&#146; shown to the abbot by the king, and makes uncorroborated claims that the king appointed de la Mare a member of his privy council. Edward was certainly a frequent visitor to St Albans and a considerable benefactor, but the evidence suggests de la Mare actually enjoyed closer relations with his son Edward, the Black Prince, who intervened on several occasions to defend de la Mare and protect the interests of St Albans. The Black Prince's register records a number of gifts of plate and wine to the abbot.<h2>
<a name="Theexemplarymonk"></a>The exemplary monk</h2>In the course of his career de la Mare emerged as a distinguished public figure of no small political importance. But according to the memoir in the <span class="italic">Gesta abbatum</span> he also continued to adhere to the highest monastic and ascetic ideals in his personal life. He submitted to frequent flagellation and other mortifications of the flesh, and observed frequent vigils, often reciting the psalter alone &#145;while the other monks slept&#146;  (<span class="italic">Gesta abbatum</span>, 3.403). He was said to have abstained from meat and other rich food, even when entertaining important visitors, and forswore the hawking and hunting enjoyed by many in the community. In the late 1350s he seems to have undergone a spiritual crisis, and encouraged by Jean II, king of France, who was held captive at St Albans, he briefly contemplated retiring from the abbacy to lead a solitary ascetic life. In addition to these mortifications de la Mare also continued to pursue his studies in scripture and other devotional literature. In his theological knowledge, according to Walsingham, he surpassed &#145;the sum of learned clergy&#146;  (<span class="italic">Gesta abbatum</span>, 3.409).<br>
<br>De la Mare suffered from poor health for much of his life. Although unaffected in 1349, he was struck down in the second wave of pestilence in the 1360s and never fully recovered, his infirmity being compounded by his own punishing regime of abstinence. Even before the end of the 1380s illness had forced him to pass many duties over to his younger officials. From 1390 to his death in 1396 the community was effectively governed by the cellarer, John Moot. De la Mare's long decline undermined much of what he had achieved: his long absences from parliament led to the abbot of Westminster's claim to the title of first among the parliamentary abbots, and St Albans was once more threatened by the king's escheator. But he continued to be regarded as a distinguished elder statesman, and even on his deathbed he was visited by Richard II, John of Gaunt, and the archbishops of Canterbury and York. De la Mare died on 15 September 1396 and was buried in the north aisle of the abbey church beneath an elaborate Flemish brass which he himself had commissioned. He was regarded in later generations as the greatest of all the abbots of St Albans, and his achievements were celebrated in various lives written during the fifteenth century.<br>
