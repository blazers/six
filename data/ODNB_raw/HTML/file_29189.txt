<span class="headword">Wheeler,  Maurice</span>  (1647/8&#150;1727), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, was the son of Maurice Wheeler of St Giles, Dorset. He matriculated from New Inn Hall, Oxford, on 1 April 1664, aged sixteen, and proceeded BA on 17 October 1667. He was ordained deacon on 19 December 1668 at Worcester. He was appointed chaplain of Christ Church, Oxford, in 1670, and on 5 July that year proceeded MA. Also in 1670 he was appointed rector of St Ebbe's, Oxford. In 1673 he became the tutor of William Wake, the future bishop of Lincoln and archbishop of Canterbury. Also in 1673 Wheeler published <span class="italic">The Oxford Almanac for the Year of Our Lord 1673</span>, more than 30,000 being printed. Such was his success that the Society of Booksellers &#145;bought off the copy for the future&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 4.785&#150;6). While rector of St Ebbe's Wheeler married. Both the identity of his bride and the date of the marriage are uncertain, but the most likely possibility is that he married Anne Lowe in Christ Church in 1679. The St Ebbe's parish registers record the burial of twin sons in June 1680. According to his will his son George was the only survivor of eight sons, although he also had a daughter, Susanna, who survived him out of a total of eleven children.<br>
<br>On 4 August 1680 Wheeler was installed as rector of Sibbertoft, Northamptonshire. He stayed four years before being appointed on 11 September 1684 master of the cathedral school in Gloucester, known as College School. In 1684 Wheeler demonstrated his interest in the manufacture of clocks when he published <span class="italic">A letter to Dr. Robert Plot, concerning a movement that measures time after a peculiar manner, with an account of the reasons of the said motion</span>, and that same year he contributed a section &#145;Of curiosity&#146; to an English translation of Plutarch's <span class="italic">Moralia</span>. Thereafter Wheeler concentrated on west country affairs and in particular his school. According to Bonner he &#145;new modelled it in every respect, both within doors and without&#146;  (Bonner, 17&#150;18), even to the extent of designing the school clock. While in Gloucester Wheeler maintained a regular correspondence with William Wake, by now a rising star in the Church of England. In June 1702 he offered Wake the opinion that &#145;I have more charity for any sort of honest dissenter, than for such kind of church-man among us who of all men seem to me to have the least sense of religion&#146;  (Wake MSS, 23/138). It was Wheeler's connection to Wake which saw him installed as a prebendary of Lincoln on 13 March 1708. From about 1708 Wheeler's letters to Wake evinced a yearning to retire. On 3 October 1708 he recorded that he had preached for the first time in &#145;about 25 years&#146;  (Wake MSS, 23/183). On 19 August 1711 Wheeler's wife died after many years of ill health. This allowed Wheeler to leave Gloucester after twenty-eight years as master, following his installation as rector of Wappenham on 17 May 1712. By this date Wheeler suffered from poor eyesight, which made reading difficult. His intention was to retire once his daughter had been provided for, and on 20 May 1714 she married his curate, John Fletcher. Wheeler duly resigned Wappenham to his son-in-law, who was installed on 13 May 1715 &#145;by my interest in the R. R. William Ld Bp of Lincoln&#146;  (will, fol. 234<i>v</i>).<br>
<br>Wheeler was installed as rector of Thorpe Mandeville, Northamptonshire, on 12 November 1720, which he retained until his death. According to Rudder he died on 6 October 1727, being buried at Wappenham on 9 October 1727. He made his will in his seventy-eighth year in May 1726. He referred to his son George as &#145;now in a languishing condition&#146;  (will, fol. 234<i>r</i>); he received just &pound;10 &#145;having formerly in his education and farther encouragement bestowed upon him more than at that time could well be afforded&#146;  (ibid.). His daughter Susanna Fletcher received furniture including the desk &#145;where I have spent many delightfull hours in usefull meditations upon the vanitys of this World&#146;  (ibid.). John Fletcher received his books and mathematical, musical, and mechanical instruments. There was also a bequest to Wappenham's rector and churchwardens towards a charity school and workhouse to be formed &#145;by a friendly combination of the neighbouring parishes&#146;  (ibid., fol. 234<i>v</i>), but if no progress had been made after two years the money was to go to the charity school and workhouse at Gloucester with which Wheeler had been much concerned.<br>
