<span class="headword">Ailred <span class="st"> [&AElig;lred, &AElig;thelred]</span> of Rievaulx</span>  (1110&#150;1167), <span class="occ">religious writer and abbot of Rievaulx</span>, was probably the youngest of the three sons of Eilaf, the last hereditary priest of the church of St Andrew at Hexham, grandson of Eilaf, treasurer of Durham, and great-grandson of the learned Alfred, son of Westou, sacristan of Durham and guardian of the shrine of St Cuthbert.<h2>
<a name="Earlyyears"></a>Early years</h2>Ailred was born at Hexham early in 1110 and, as a youth, was said to have been as intelligent as he was eloquent. He received a basic classical and literary education at Hexham and, probably, at Durham, but some time after 1124 he joined the court of David I, king of Scots, as a companion to David's eldest son, Henry, with whom he developed a deep friendship, and David's stepson, Waldef, another saint in the making. Here he sowed his wild oats, and here too he was elevated to the position of David's seneschal and was employed by his royal master on numerous diplomatic missions in Scotland and northern England.<br>
<br>It was on one such mission to Archbishop Thurstan of York about 1134 that Ailred first learned of the Cistercians of Rievaulx. The abbey had been founded in 1132 by Walter Espec and, according to Walter Daniel in his life of Ailred, it took but a single visit to persuade Ailred to relinquish the court for the cloister. Whether his decision was really as precipitate as Walter describes may perhaps be questioned, for the <span class="italic">Vita Ailredi</span>, important though it is, is a hagiographical work and its author was not averse to manipulating the truth to suit his purposes. But whatever the facts of the matter, with his entry into Rievaulx there is no doubt that Ailred had found his true home.<br>
<br>The new postulant, however, was unusual: he was familiar with the court, accustomed to power, and practised in diplomacy; and it would have been strange had William, abbot of Rievaulx, not profited from his talents. Thus, in 1138, during the war between Stephen and Matilda, Ailred probably accompanied William to Wark on the Scottish border to negotiate the surrender of Walter Espec's castle to King David; and in 1142, as William's representative, he journeyed to Rome to present to Innocent II the Cistercian objections to the election of Archbishop William of York.<h2>
<a name="AbbotofRevesbyandthenRievaulx"></a>Abbot of Revesby and then Rievaulx</h2>On his return from Rome, Ailred was appointed novice master at Rievaulx&#151;he was tender and compassionate with his charges, though there are indications that he was also somewhat lax&#151;but shortly thereafter, in 1143, he was appointed first abbot of Revesby in Lincolnshire. He governed the new abbey with a combination of deep spirituality and hard-headed business acumen, and as the religious life of the house grew in fervour, so its wealth and possessions grew in quantity.<br>
<br>Meanwhile, in 1145, William of Rievaulx had died and his successor, Maurice, found the abbatial burden too heavy. He therefore resigned in 1147 and Ailred was elected to succeed him: he would hold the office for the next twenty years. His election, however, was not unopposed, for there were some who thought him ambitious, self-indulgent, and too involved with worldly affairs. But once elected, Ailred brought to Rievaulx all the talents he had displayed at Revesby, and under his guidance Rievaulx &#145;doubled its monks, lay-brothers, laymen, granges, lands, and goods, and trebled its religious life&#146;  (<span class="italic">Life</span>, &sect;30).<br>
<br>The new abbot, however, was hardly a model of monastic stability. He was much in demand as a fine preacher and was regularly sought out as an effective mediator in conflicts both secular and monastic. Thus, in the early 1160s he played an important role&#151;perhaps a decisive role&#151;in persuading Henry II to support the papacy of Alexander III; on 13 October 1163 he preached at Westminster at the translation of St Edward the Confessor; on 20 March in the following year&#151;it was St Cuthbert's day, a saint to whom he had a particular devotion and to whom he composed a (lost) eulogy&#151;he was preaching in a church in Kirkcudbright; and at about the same time (the year is uncertain) he negotiated peace between Fergus of Galloway and his contumacious sons. It was neither his first nor his last visit to Scotland, and on his way he would sometimes spend the night with his friend Godric of Finchale whose life, by Reginald of Durham, was written at Ailred's request. As abbot of Rievaulx he was also required to attend the annual general chapter at C&icirc;teaux and to make annual visitations of Rievaulx's five daughter houses: Wardon, Melrose, Dundrennan, Revesby, and Rufford. As a consequence he was often away from his monastery, but even when he was within its walls his influence spread far and wide: he was in contact with the pope, kings, archbishops and bishops, and the most distinguished men in the realm, and the loss of his collected letters has deprived scholars of a wealth of literary evidence for the period.<h2>
<a name="Illnessanddeath"></a>Illness and death</h2>For the last ten years of his life Ailred was plagued by serious and painful illness: he suffered from arthritis, gout, and kidney stones; and, for the twelve months before his death, from some chronic bronchial disorder. So severe were his sufferings (which were exacerbated by his own austerities) that in 1157 the general chapter gave him leave to move into the infirmary at Rievaulx and to conduct the business of the house from there. This he did for a short time, but then moved from the infirmary to a small hut nearby. There he read and worked, and there too he received visitors, both heavenly (according to Walter Daniel) and earthly, though the latter were surely the more importunate. The monks came to him in dozens&#151;even up to a hundred, says Walter&#151;and it seems that the Rievaulx community intended to reap all the benefit it could from the enforced presence of its ailing abbot.<br>
<br>By January 1167 Ailred knew that he was dying. On the third of the month he spoke to his monks for the last time, advised them how best to choose his successor, and asked for certain relics and three books: his glossed psalter (it was preserved in the library after his death), Augustine's <span class="italic">Confessions</span>, and the gospel of <span class="roman">St John</span>. On 5 January he was anointed <i>in extremis</i> and given the viaticum by Roger of Byland, and as his body became ever feebler he grew impatient for death. &#145;Festinate [Hasten], for Crist luve&#146;, he would say  (<span class="italic">Life</span>, &sect;54), yet he lingered on for another week before he died on 12 January 1167 at about 10.30 p.m. He was fifty-seven. He was buried the next day in the chapter house at Rievaulx (his body was later translated to the church), and although never formally canonized, he became the centre of a local cult in the north of England which was recognized officially by the Cistercians in 1476.<h2>
<a name="Ailredasauthor"></a>Ailred as author</h2>Ailred was an accomplished writer of historical, hagiographical, spiritual, and theological works. He had lived in troubled times and, as a man who had enjoyed the trust of kings, was well placed to write of current events. That he did so with apologetic interest is only to be expected.<br>
<br>His earliest historical work is the <span class="italic">Vita Davidis Scotorum regis</span> written in 1153 on the death of his friend and former patron. The work is a paean in praise of David's virtues and a plea for loyalty to his grandson and heir, Malcolm IV. Ailred then made the <span class="italic">Vita</span> the first chapter of his <span class="italic">Genealogia regum Anglorum</span> (1153&#150;4), a work that is partly advice on how to be a good king and partly a careful (if tenuous) argument for accepting the young Henry II as a lineal descendant of Edward the Confessor and for seeing the Norman kingship as the true successor to the Anglo-Saxon royal line. The same intent appears in the <span class="italic">Vita S. Eduardi regis et confessoris</span> (1162&#150;3) written at the request of Lawrence of Westminster and dedicated to Henry II. It is not a particularly original work, being heavily dependent on an earlier biography by Osbert of Clare, but with Ailred's additions the book proved immensely popular and played an important role both in advancing the cult of the Confessor in England and in establishing the myth of Plantagenet legitimacy.<br>
<br>Between the <span class="italic">Genealogia</span> and the <span class="italic">Vita</span> came <span class="italic">De bello standardii</span> (1155&#150;7), an account of the battle of the Standard fought near Northallerton between the Scots and the English on 22 August 1138. Ailred's account, however, was written at least seventeen years after the affray and the roles played by certain of the protagonists were not quite as Ailred wished to remember them.<br>
<br>In the <span class="italic">Vita S. Niniani</span> (1154&#150;60) and <span class="italic">De miraculis Hagustaldensis ecclesiae</span> (on the saints of Hexham, begun in 1155), history mingles with hagiography, for little definite was known of any of the saints in question. But although both works amalgamate earlier traditions with pious imagination, the story of the saints of Hexham is enriched by personal reminiscences of Ailred's own family&#151;the saints of Hexham were, after all, his family's saints&#151;and his comments are an important source for his own biography.<br>
<br>The extraordinary and horrible story of the nun of Watton is contained in a letter written by Ailred (<span class="italic">De sanctimoniali de Watton</span>) <i>c</i>.1160, after he had been asked by Gilbert of Sempringham to investigate events at Watton Priory. There a young novice, having taken the veil despite showing little inclination towards the religious life, had an affair with a man of the house and became pregnant. When this was discovered, the nuns forced her to castrate her lover, and placed her in irons in a cell. She then claimed to have been restored to her virginal condition through the miraculous intervention of the now deceased archbishop of York, Henry Murdac, who had placed her in the convent as a young girl. Ailred, dismayed at the ease with which male and female religious could meet, was undoubtedly relieved when the investigation was over.<br>
<br>Of Ailred's surviving spiritual treatises much has been written. The earliest (and finest) was the <span class="italic">Speculum caritatis</span>, a work requested by Bernard of Clairvaux whom Ailred had undoubtedly met on his way to Rome in 1142. It was begun when the author was novice master at Rievaulx and perhaps completed at Revesby. The last was the Augustinian <span class="italic">De anima</span> (not one of his best works) which was composed during the last two or three years of his life. Between these came <span class="italic">De Iesu puero duodenni</span> (1153&#150;7), an allegorical exposition of <span class="roman">Luke</span> 2:41&#150;52; the Ciceronian dialogue <span class="italic">De spiritali amicitia</span> (<i>c</i>.1160), a very popular work; the influential <span class="italic">De institutione inclusarum</span> (1160&#150;62) addressed to his sister (for whose existence this is our only evidence); the brief but very personal <span class="italic">Oratio pastoralis</span> (<i>c</i>.1163&#150;6); and a whole variety of sermons&#151;about 200 according to Walter Daniel's conservative estimate&#151;delivered at different times on different occasions: sermons that are in many ways more important than the treatises and certainly more neglected.<br>
<br>In these works Ailred emerges as a theologian and spiritual director, and as a man wholly consumed with a love for the incarnate Christ. Much of his thought is rooted in the writings of the standard Western authorities (especially Augustine and Gregory the Great) and in the Cistercian tradition of which, in England, he was the foremost representative; but in his discussion of human and divine relationships and in his conception of God as friendship (<i>amicitia</i>) he made important and original contributions to spiritual theology.<br>
<br>Not all Ailred's works have survived. The loss of his letters and his eulogy to St Cuthbert have already been mentioned, but the Rievaulx library catalogue also lists an otherwise unknown <span class="italic">De fasciculo frondium</span>, and Walter Daniel notes that he composed a liturgical homily on <span class="roman">Luke</span> 11:33 to be read on the feast day of St Edward the Confessor. A number of other treatises, both historical and spiritual, have at times been attributed to him (they are listed in Anselme Hoste's <span class="italic">Bibliotheca Aelrediana</span>), but none is certainly from his pen and some are clearly spurious. And as to Charles Dumont's suggestion that Ailred was the author of the pseudo-Bernardine <span class="italic">Jubilus rhythmicus de nomine Iesu</span>, that remains no more than an attractive hypothesis.<br>
