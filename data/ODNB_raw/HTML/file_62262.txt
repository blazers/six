<span class="headword">Watson,  (James) Wreford</span>  (1915&#150;1990), <span class="occ">geographer and poet</span>, was born on 8 February 1915 in Sanyuan, Shensi (Shanxi), China, the third of five children of the Revd James Watson (1878&#150;1952), and Evelyn Russell (<i>d</i>. 1926). His parents were Scottish Baptist missionaries in the Far East and the young Wreford travelled much, a fact he regarded as influential in his geographical writing.<br>
<br>Wreford Watson was educated at George Watson's College, Edinburgh, between 1927 and 1931 and at the University of Edinburgh from where he graduated with first-class honours in geography in 1936 and where he met fellow geographer Jessie Wilson Black (1915&#150;1989), with whom he founded the university's Geographical Society (he was first president, she first secretary). They married in 1939. Watson received part of his training from Alan Ogilvie and Arthur Geddes, son of Sir Patrick, both of whom emphasized the importance of regions and regional differentiation. These issues, central to Watson's own work, were reinforced following his meeting, in 1937, the Australian geographer Griffith Taylor, professor of geography at Toronto. In 1939, after two years as an assistant lecturer in geography at the University of Sheffield, Watson moved to Canada as a PhD student under Taylor, and became an instructor at McMaster University. He spent the war years in Canada.<br>
<br>In 1949 Watson moved to Ottawa to take up an appointment as chief geographer and director of mines and technical surveys. From this time Watson developed interests in applied and social geography, initially evident in a key paper, &#145;The sociological aspects of geography&#146; (1951). In 1952 he took up the chair in geography at Carleton in Ottawa, a position held concurrently with that of chief geographer.<br>
<br>From 1954 until retirement in 1982, Watson held a chair in geography at the University of Edinburgh. Watson's inaugural lecture at Edinburgh&#151;&#145;Geography: a discipline in distance&#146;&#151;was ahead of its time in its attention to mental perceptions of distance and landscape. It has been undeservedly neglected. While in Edinburgh, he was prominently involved in international geographical congress meetings, was president of the geography section of the British Association for the Advancement of Science (1970), vice-president and president of the Royal Scottish Geographical Society (1968&#150;76, 1977&#150;83 respectively), and, for 1982&#150;3, was president of the Institute of British Geographers. He was elected a fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1978. In Edinburgh he established the Centre for Canadian Studies in 1972, a largely humanities-based research centre which provided both a home for visiting scholars and courses on Canada's history and geography. In Edinburgh, with his wife and their son and daughter, Watson created a happy home and a welcoming environment for students, colleagues, and visiting scholars. His retirement was spent quietly in south-west Scotland.<br>
<br>Watson's contribution to geography is most evident in his regional and social geography texts, notably <span class="italic">General Geography</span> (1953), <span class="italic">Canada: its Growth and Prospects</span> (1968), <span class="italic">Social Geography of the United States</span> (1979), and <span class="italic">The United States: Habitation of Hope</span> (1983), although he took greatest pleasure from co-writing with his wife <span class="italic">The Canadians: how they Live and Work</span> (1978). For his geographical work, Watson received honorary degrees from five Canadian universities, awards from the Association of American Geographers, the Canadian Association of Geographers, and the Murchison medal (in 1960) and the research medal (1964) from the Royal Geographical Society. For contributions to Canadian studies, he was awarded the gold medal of the International Council for Canadian Studies in 1984. His poetry volume, <span class="italic">Of Time and the Lover</span>&#151;published under the <i>nom de plume</i> James Wreford&#151;was awarded the governor-general of Canada's poetry medal in 1954.<br>
<br>Both for his writings and for his immense organizational abilities, Watson may be considered one of the great British and North American geographers of the post-1945 era. His written work and fluent lecturing style owed much to his literary skills. His textbooks stressed the regional differentiation of social characteristics, and, in his papers on social geography, he extended geography's conceptual boundaries by emphasizing the place of the imagination in geography. In such ways, he helped develop what would now be understood in geography as &#145;behaviouralism&#146; and stressed the importance of perception and belief in understanding the social world.<br>
<br>Watson died on 18 September 1990 at Castle Douglas, Kirkcudbrightshire, where he was buried on 22 September.<br>
