<span class="headword">Gee,  Henry Simpson</span>  (1842&#150;1924), <span class="occ">shoe manufacturer and businessman</span>, was born on 6 April 1842 at Lowerhead Row, Leeds, the eldest son of George Walker Gee, linen draper, and his wife, Ellen, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Simpson. He was educated privately at Grange School, Thorp Arch, near Leeds. After working briefly for his father, in 1863 he joined the successful leather tanning and dressing business of Stead and Simpson, which had been founded in 1834 by Edmund Stead and Gee's uncle, Edward Simpson.<br>
<br>Gee's appointment coincided with significant technological innovations in the footwear industry, notably the application of sewing and riveting machines, which facilitated the rapid expansion of factory production of ready-to-wear boots and shoes in the last third of the nineteenth century. Recognizing the importance of this, the firm had opened new boot factories in Leicester and Daventry, and in 1864 Gee moved to Leicester to oversee them. Under his control the business expanded rapidly. By the mid-1880s the Leicester factory alone was producing 30,000 pairs per week, and the firm employed over 1750 workers on various sites. In 1889 the partnership was converted into a private company, Stead and Simpson Ltd, with Gee as chairman, and after closing the original leather processing works in 1892 it concentrated entirely on footwear production and distribution.<br>
<br>By this time Gee had diversified into retailing to secure outlets for the firm's products, opening a network of more than 100 shops by as early as 1889. These adopted pioneering marketing strategies common to other emerging multiples of the time&#151;using central locations, vigorous selling methods, low prices, and minimal fixtures. By the end of the century, therefore, Gee was responsible for one of the largest vertically integrated footwear businesses in the country. He was also personally involved with other leading firms, notably Freeman, Hardy, and Willis, of which he was a board member and later deputy chairman; its chairman, Edward Wood, was a member of Stead and Simpson's board.<br>
<br>Gee's interests, however, extended well beyond the footwear industry. He was &#145;a master of management well nigh in every field of industry and speculation&#146;  (<span class="italic">Leicester Mail</span>, 24 July 1924), and &#145;by far the most prominent and interesting personality in local commercial circles for nearly half a century&#146;  (<span class="italic">Shoe and Leather News</span>, 25 July 1924). From 1874 he was chairman of the Leicester Horse Tramway Company and, in 1886, successfully negotiated its takeover by the corporation. He was elected to the board of the Leicestershire Banking Company in 1878, became its chairman in 1890, and was instrumental in initiating and conducting negotiations which led to its amalgamation with the London City and Midland Bank Ltd (later the Midland Bank) of which he also became a director. He was also chairman of the Bagworth Colliery Company and of Richard Hornsby &amp; Sons Ltd, agricultural engineers of Grantham. As a commercial magnate he acquired a reputation for being able to turn round struggling businesses, which led to numerous directorships in fields as diverse as engineering, grocery, dress, drapery, and shipping. As a businessman Gee had a reputation for being something of an autocrat who did not relish challenges to his authority, and this occasionally led to bitter boardroom battles. Nor did he suffer fools gladly or sadly, sweeping the slacker and trifler from his presence &#145;without the slightest regard to their position or connections&#146;  (<span class="italic">Leicester Mail</span>, 21 July 1924).<br>
<br>Gee's involvement in local affairs was restricted to spheres in which he had particular interests. He was briefly Liberal town councillor for the North St Margaret's ward between 1878 and 1881, but he resigned due to pressure of business. In 1889 he became JP for the city and county of Leicester. He was a passionate advocate of vocational education, promoting the Leicester technical schools and leaving &pound;20,000 in his will, the largest single bequest, to the endowment fund of the Leicester, Leicestershire, and Rutland College, later the University of Leicester. He was also president of the Leicester Trade Protection Society, the Leicester chamber of commerce, and the board of governors of the Royal Infirmary. He was firmly discriminating in his support of charities, approving in particular the work of the Charity Organization Society. Initially a Liberal, he became a unionist as a result of the home rule crisis, but he remained a committed free-trader. His political conversion was mirrored by his religious affiliation, for he abandoned the Wesleyan Methodism of his youth to become a staunch Anglican.<br>
<br>Gee was married three times: on 5 May 1870 to Isabella Gorham, daughter of John Gorham, surgeon, of Tonbridge; then to Mary Blanche, daughter of James Dalton of Fillingham Manor, near Lincoln; and finally to the widow of Mr S. R. Wykes, who survived him. He had four sons, all of whom eventually joined the board of directors of Stead and Simpson: Harry Percy, George Cecil, Ernest Gorham, and Charles Dalton. He also had four daughters, one of whom married Dr Astley V. Clarke, a prominent promoter of university education in Leicester.<br>
<br>Gee died on 20 July 1924 at his fashionable residence of Knighton Frith at Knighton, near Leicester, aged eighty-two. His funeral service was held on 24 July at St John the Baptist Church, Leicester, and he was interred at St Mary's, Knighton.<br>
