<span class="headword">King,  Mary <span class="st"> [Moll]</span></span>  (1696&#150;1747), <span class="occ">businesswoman</span>, was born on Vine Street in the parish of St Giles-in-the-Fields, London. Her father, Crispin, was a cobbler, and her mother peddled fruit, greens, and fish. At a young age Moll began to sell fruit from a barrow and earned a reputation for industry and good temper. She married Thomas King (1694&#150;1739), who had been educated at Eton College and admitted to King's College, Cambridge, in 1717, and the two of them saved enough money to open a stall in Covent Garden. After a few years they bought a house in Covent Garden market in which she sold coffee, tea, and chocolate. Soon they owned three adjoining shacks, and the business flourished; it became, in fact, &#145;a feature of the Piazza itself&#146;  (Chancellor, 62). They catered to the early morning market crowd, daytime shoppers and idlers, and, in a tavern atmosphere, to the evening pleasure-seekers, who ranged from actors from the nearby theatres and fashionable couples seeking slightly risqu&eacute; experiences to ladies of pleasure and their clients. Among the services she offered was sending a servant bearing a light with her customers to the bagnios she recommended.<br>
<br>The Kings benefited from upper-class acquaintances, Tom from his time at school and Moll from her brief affair with William Murray, first earl of Mansfield. A common legend is that George II once came with Viscount Gage and was almost drawn into a fight. &#145;Noblemen and the first <i>beaux</i> &hellip; after leaving Court would go to her house in full dress, with swords &hellip; and in rich brocaded silk coats, and &hellip; conversed with &hellip; chimney-sweepers, gardeners, and the market-people&#146;  (Chancellor, 63). Visitors described playing fashionable card-games and enjoying &#145;the best of conversation&#146;  (Shelley, 208).<br>
<br>Moll and Tom bought land at Haverstock Hill near Hampstead and built a large, comfortable country house. They had a son born on 30 August 1730 and named for his father, whom they sent to Westminster School. For over twenty years King's was the most notorious and successful meeting-place in Covent Garden. William Hogarth depicted Moll's coffee house in his <span class="italic">Morning</span>; her building and sign are clearly visible, and a fight is going on inside. Ronald Paulson points out that Hogarth places it to the other side of the square from its actual location so that it partially obscures Inigo Jones's St Paul's and forms the juxtaposition he wanted. Henry Fielding refers to it in <span class="italic">Pasquin</span>, and the prologue to his <span class="italic">Covent Garden Tragedy</span> asks &#145;What rake is ignorant of King's Coffee House?&#146;.<br>
<br>Throughout her career, King was prosecuted for keeping a disorderly house. <span class="italic">The Life and Character of Moll King</span> says she was indicted nearly twenty times but very rarely convicted. For example, in May 1736 she was censured for allowing the men who disrupted a mass to get drunk at her house, and in November 1737 she was fined for keeping a &#145;Disorderly House at which sexual offences were committed&#146;  (Burford, 58). She was in king's bench prison briefly in June 1739 for refusing to pay a &pound;200 fine for beating a young man in her coffee house; she insisted she was keeping order and said &#145;if she was to pay Two Hundred Pounds to all the insolent Boys she had thrash'd for their Impudence, the Bank of <i>England</i> would be unable to furnish her with the Cash&#146;  (<span class="italic">Life and Character</span>, 15).<br>
<br>King retired to Hampstead in 1745, rented a pew in a church, and lived her last years quietly. She died at Hampstead on 17 September 1747. Some time afterwards, possibly that year, an anonymous account of her life and character was published.<br>
