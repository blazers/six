<span class="headword">Ram, Sir  (Lucius Abel John) Granville</span>  (1885&#150;1952), <span class="occ">parliamentary draftsman</span>, was born on 24 June 1885 in Chester Square, Belgravia, London, the only surviving son of Abel John Ram (1842&#150;1920), barrister, and his wife, Mary Grace O'Brien (<i>d</i>. 1912), daughter of the thirteenth Baron Inchiquin. The family was of Anglo-Irish descent. His father specialized in local government work at the parliamentary bar. Granville, who had two sisters, went to Eton College in 1898 and Exeter College, Oxford, in 1904 where he took a pass degree in 1909 before studying law with H. A. McCardie. He was called to the bar by the Inner Temple in 1910.<br>
<br>The First World War took Ram to Egypt, Gallipoli, and France as a captain in the Hertfordshire yeomanry, and he became adjutant of the South Irish horse. When demobilized in 1919 he entered the civil service as assistant solicitor to the Ministry of Labour, succeeding (Alfred) Clive Lawrence as solicitor in October 1923. His intention was to study government from inside as preparation for a parliamentary career. On 9 February 1924 he married Elizabeth Mitchell-Innes (<i>b</i>. 1901), daughter of a barrister. They had three sons and two daughters by 1938 and lived at Berkhamsted Place, an old mansion bought by his late father in Berkhamsted, Hertfordshire. A magistrate from 1923, Ram became deputy chairman (1932) and chairman (1946) of the Hertfordshire quarter sessions. Shooting and sailing were his hobbies.<br>
<br>In February 1925 Granville Ram was appointed to the office of the parliamentary counsel to the Treasury, the small yet high-powered department that drafted all government legislation. As the third counsel of three, he worked on the text of a variety of bills, notably the <span class="roman">Trade Disputes Act</span> of 1927, which outlawed sympathy strikes. Promotion to second parliamentary counsel in January 1929 and CB in January 1931 raised his expectations of the top job when Sir William Graham-Harrison resigned as first parliamentary counsel in November 1933; the selection of Maurice Gwyer came as an unwelcome surprise. Gwyer, who had no previous experience of drafting bills, tactfully allowed Ram a free hand with such important projects as the <span class="roman">Unemployment Act</span> of 1934 and the <span class="roman">Public Order Act</span> of 1936. The <span class="roman">Abdication Bill</span> engaged them both in December 1936, when Ram belatedly noticed a flaw. Conventionally, an act of parliament takes effect at the start of the day on which it receives the royal assent. Edward VIII could not therefore give the royal assent to the <span class="roman">Abdication Bill</span> (as it stood) without <i>ipso facto</i> invalidating that purported royal assent. A hasty addition specified that the abdication would take effect on the royal assent being signified.<br>
<br>Ram, &#145;a shortish bespectacled man with a suspicion of a paunch and a rather misleading air of Pickwickian benevolence&#146;  (Kent, 19), was perhaps less scholarly and certainly more rumbustious than the typical parliamentary counsel. He usually relied on his assistants to produce the first draft of a bill, before he pulled their work to pieces and comprehensively recast it. His pride in his own legal prose was such that he would repeatedly smother texts with stylistic alterations, some of them trivial. Subordinates, who favoured more functional wording, called him the Maestro behind his back. Not that Ram was indifferent to the content of legislation; on the contrary, he was remarkably free with opinions that went beyond the purely legal. Politics still fascinated him, and government ministers, once they grew used to his presumptuousness, came to appreciate an inventive draftsman who would readily consider how a particular form of words might play on the back benches.<br>
<br>Ram succeeded Gwyer as first parliamentary counsel in January 1937 with a salary of &pound;3000 per annum and a knighthood (KCB) a year later. The office now consisted of five counsel and three assistants. Sir Granville ran it as though it were his own legal chambers. Other civil servants had always to come to see him; even assistant counsel never went out to meet anyone less than a permanent secretary. He stoutly defended his staff at all times: the only person with a right to criticize them was himself, and he exercised it to the full. At his worst, Ram could reduce his secretary to tears, yet colleagues learned to tolerate his moods, for he was basically good natured and keen to advance their careers. His excesses moreover caused amusement. Relations between the parliamentary counsel and ordinary departments were inevitably tense, for laymen failed to understand the technical difficulties faced by lawyers. Ram relished confrontation; his idea of success was to leave a meeting without having given an inch. Quick to form decided views, he was very slow to revise them.<br>
<br>For all his vigour, Granville Ram felt the strain of maintaining a full programme of legislation while also preparing a stream of emergency defence regulations for possible use in wartime. From late 1938 until 1940 he struggled to shake off a virus infection. Once back on form he drafted the <span class="roman">Emergency Powers (Defence) Act</span> of 1940, giving power to require persons &#145;to place themselves, their services, and their property at the disposal of His Majesty&#146;. It was legally otiose but just what Churchill wanted to express the will of the nation. Bombed out of the Treasury, the office moved to Old Queen Street, where, while his expanded staff toiled away at wartime control orders, Ram took charge of the <span class="roman">Education Act</span> of 1944. He served as a governor of the Berkhamsted schools and the Francis Holland Church of England schools for girls and belonged to the Association of Governing Bodies of Public Schools. He was a king's counsel from June 1943.<br>
<br>Despite his antipathy to socialism, Ram enjoyed the professional challenge offered by the rush of major legislation that followed the election of a Labour government in 1945. He persuaded Jowitt, the lord chancellor, to endorse his ambitious plans for an ideal statute book, in which statute law on any given subject would be found in a single act kept up to date by a continuous process of consolidation. The parliamentary counsel's office created a new branch to pursue this, and Ram took charge of it on retiring as first counsel in July 1947, combining the post with the chair of the statute law committee from December 1947.<br>
<br>Though he came to London only twice a month from his new home at Furze Park, Polruan by Fowey, Cornwall, Ram achieved twenty-nine consolidation acts in five years, thanks to the <span class="roman">Consolidation of Enactments (Procedures) Act</span> of 1949, which authorized the making of slight amendments. The purist doctrine of preserving ambiguities in the existing law had always struck him as absurd. He had time to become a lay preacher and a church commissioner from 1948. In spring 1952 Granville Ram developed leukaemia. The <span class="roman">Magistrates' Court Act</span> of 1952 nevertheless kept him busy in the private wing of University College Hospital, Gower Street, London. He died there on 23 December 1952, having been the dominant personality in the office of the parliamentary counsel for a generation.<br>
