<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Cory,  William Johnson</span>  (1823&#150;1892), <span class="occ">poet and schoolmaster</span>, was born William Johnson at Torrington, Devon, on 9 January 1823, the second son of Charles William Johnson, formerly an indigo planter in India, and his wife, Theresa, daughter of the Revd Peter Wellington Furse of Halsdon, Devon, and a great-niece of Sir Joshua Reynolds. His elder brother, Charles Wellington Johnson (1821&#150;1900), assumed his mother's surname of Furse; he was well known from 1894 until his death as canon and archdeacon of Westminster. William Johnson received his education at Eton College, where he was elected king's scholar in 1832 and Newcastle scholar in 1841, and at King's College, Cambridge, where he was elected to a scholarship on 23 February 1842. In 1843 he gained the chancellor's medal, &#145;won by a casting vote&#146;, for an English poem on Plato. In 1844 he won the Craven scholarship, succeeded to a fellowship at King's in February 1845, graduated BA, and in September of that year was appointed an assistant master at Eton, where he remained for upwards of twenty-six years.<br>
<br>Eton in 1845 still had very large forms (&#145;divisions&#146;) taught in unsuitable rooms, and Johnson, who was extremely short-sighted and weak-voiced, did not easily keep order. The main activities in class were the testing of lessons previously prepared and the hearing of recitations (&#145;saying lessons&#146;). The master had the duty of talking about the set texts or the background history and geography; Johnson could fascinate responsive boys, drawing parallels from modern history and literature out of his amazingly well-stocked mind.<br>
<br>The most constructive work was done in smaller groups of boys under their tutor, who might be in charge of them throughout their school career. Here Latin prose and verses were composed, and Johnson produced suitable textbooks for this purpose. The most famous, <span class="italic">Lucretilis</span>, was used at Eton for 100 years; the sapphics and alcaics were said by H. A. J. Munro to be the best since Horace and were reprinted in the 1940s. (The boys produced their own versions, working from English texts.) Also a tutor would give &#145;private business&#146; to his pupils, and &#145;Sunday private&#146;, in which he could range off the syllabus. Johnson excelled at this, taking immense pains to encourage his pupils to think over a wide area. He also wrote perceptively about them&#151;his most often quoted judgement being on the future prime minister, A. P. Primrose, the fifth earl of Rosebery: &#145;he is one of those who likes the palm without the dust&#146;. His tutorial letters to parents set a lasting standard for his successors.<br>
<br>Johnson also contributed to educational theory. Two pamphlets, <span class="italic">Eton Reform</span> and <span class="italic">Eton Reform II</span>, written in reply to criticisms, define his view of the purpose of school life: &#145;You go to a great school not so much for knowledge as for arts and habits&#146;&#151;which include taste and discrimination, the art of expression, the art of entering quickly into another person's thought, and the habits of attention and accuracy, of submitting to censure and reputation, and of mental courage and mental soberness. In 1867 he contributed an essay, &#145;Education of the reasoning faculties&#146;, to Dean F. W. Farrar's <span class="italic">Essays on a Liberal Education</span>, in which he mentions some of the ways he tries to develop his pupils' ability to think rationally, including the analysis of argumentation found in sermons and newspapers. A pamphlet, <span class="italic">Hints for Eton Masters</span>, published only in 1898, circulated among his friends; along with much else that was wise, it encouraged the boys' freedom, a distinguishing feature of Eton. His influence was to some extent surprisingly close to the muscular Christians, then becoming important in education. For he loved action from boys, which he could not himself match. He was an imperialist, even if a liberal in the whig tradition at home. Yet he differed from the caricatural muscular Christian by his love of music and learning, and the scepticism of his Christianity.<br>
<br>Johnson was considered as a possible professor of history at Cambridge, though he himself would have preferred political economy, a subject which he began to teach at Eton when the curriculum for older boys was expanded. He taught many of the ablest boys in the school and had, as the senior assistant master, progressed to teaching the second classical division.<br>
<br>In April 1872 Johnson suddenly resigned at Eton, and no one can be quite sure of the exact circumstances of his resignation. There is no question, however, that he was dangerously fond of a number of boys. Although he probably did not allow his affections to take any physical form, he permitted intimacies between the boys. This conduct was brought to the notice of the headmaster, James Hornby, who demanded Johnson's resignation, and Johnson retired quietly to the family home, Halsdon, which he had leased from his brother. He also resigned the fellowship of King's; his influence there had been on the side of opening up the college from its traditional Etonian exclusiveness. Wanting a fresh start, he changed his surname to Cory. In 1878 he went to Madeira for his health, and there married, in August, a twenty-year-old Devon neighbour, Rosa Caroline Guille (1858&#150;1906), whose father was rector of Little Torrington. The couple had a son, Andrew. While in Madeira he wrote an idiosyncratic <span class="italic">Guide to Modern English History</span>, covering the period from 1815 to 1835, without the aid of reference books. It was published, but never brought to a conclusion, on his return from Madeira in 1882. The family settled in Hampstead, London, where he taught some girls gratis, who found him still a magical teacher. He died at his home, 4 Rosslyn Villas, Pilgrim's Lane, Hampstead, on 11 June 1892, after a period of gradually declining health, and was buried at Hampstead on 16 June; his wife survived him.<br>
<br>Johnson's poetry was mostly written at Eton, published privately and anonymously in two slim editions in 1858 and 1877 and then somewhat enlarged in 1891. His most famous lines, &#145;Heraclitus&#146;, were a translation of a Greek construe thrown off for his pupils, illustrating the excellence of his ear. Many other of the better pieces were inspired by particular boys; the words of &#145;The Eton Boating Song&#146; were written in 1865 for an ephemeral published by his pupil Everard Primrose and later set to music by another old pupil, Algernon Drummond. Curiously his literary judgement was unorthodox, for example placing Tennyson above Shakespeare.<br>
<br>Some of Johnson's best writing is found in his letters and journals, of which a selection was published by Francis Warre-Cornish in 1897. A certain censorship was exercised by a young Old Etonian, Reginald Brett (later second Lord Esher), who was with him at Halsdon at the crisis of his life, but even so there is still much of interest which Cornish did not like to make public. Johnson remains therefore someone probably known to few general readers. His main influence has been exerted through a large number of distinguished pupils, and through a chain of gifted teachers who knew him or were inspired by his writing.<br>
