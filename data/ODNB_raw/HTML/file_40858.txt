<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Anson,  Peter Frederick</span>  (1889&#150;1975), <span class="occ">monk, writer, and artist</span>, was born Frederick Charles Anson on 22 August 1889 at 32 South Parade, Southsea, the son of Charles Eustace Anson (1858&#150;1940), subsequently rear-admiral, and his wife, (Maria) Evelyn, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Ross (1863&#150;1904). His father came from a family with strong connections to the Church of England and to the monarchy: his grandfather Frederick Anson (1811&#150;1885) and great-grandfather Frederic Anson (1779&#150;1867) had been a canon of Windsor and dean of Chester respectively, while his uncle Harold Anson (1867&#150;1954) became master of the Temple. His mother was passionately devoted to Scotland, where she had been born. It was striking that Anson was born within sight and sound of the English Channel and with an ecclesiastical background, for those themes, the sea and the church, were to dominate his adult life and the attempt to synthesize them was to cause him much anguish.<br>
<br>The young Anson was educated locally on the Isle of Wight, and then at Wixenford preparatory school, where he remained until just before his fifteenth birthday. He never proceeded to public school because of ill health, which plagued him throughout his life, and he then failed to pass the entrance examination for Christ Church, Oxford. In 1908 he went to study at the Architectural Association school in London. His talent for drawing was apparent from an early age and by this time he had begun to display the obsessive interest in churches and their rituals that continued all his life.<br>
<br>The pivotal period in Anson's long life was 1910&#150;13, when he was a member of the Anglican Benedictine community on Caldy Island, Pembrokeshire, founded by Aelred Carlyle (1874&#150;1955). In 1913 a majority of the community, including Anson, was received into the Roman Catholic church, a move he never regretted. His life thereafter was marked by a restless spirit which left him unable to settle for too long in one situation, and, particularly in his later years, led to his moving from place to place without any great warning or forethought. It was that characteristic, together with his variety of undefined ailments, some of mental rather than physical origin, that led to the failure of his many attempts to adopt a monastic way of life after his first departure from Caldy shortly after the secession.<br>
<br>In 1920 Anson made an attempt to unite his various interests with the establishment of a worldwide Catholic organization for seamen, to be known as the Apostleship of the Sea, but after a short time his health broke down again and he relinquished the work to others. He began, however, to paint and draw maritime and ecclesiastical subjects and his output in those fields was enormous. He had an idiosyncratic style of drawing with an obsessive regard for accuracy. In 1924 he was received into the third order of Franciscans in Italy and adopted the name Peter, under which all his books were published.<br>
<br>By 1927 Anson had decided to make his living from art and writing and he had about forty books published. These ranged from specialist studies of fishermen in Scotland to work on churches and ecclesiastical history, many of which drew on his own experiences on Caldy. In 1936 he moved to north-east Scotland, where he lived for most of his remaining years. Resident from 1938 until 1952 at Harbour Head, Low Shore, Macduff, Banffshire, he became involved with the early stirrings of Scottish nationalism and numbered Neil Gunn and Compton Mackenzie among his circle. This period of unusual stability did not result in major works apart from <span class="italic">The Benedictines of Caldey</span> (1940).<br>
<br>In 1952 Anson began wandering again, but the period of personal restlessness which followed was marked by the publication of a number of important works, including <span class="italic">The Call of the Cloister</span> (1953), a pioneering study of Anglican monasticism, <span class="italic">Abbot Extraordinary</span> (1958), a biography of Aelred Carlyle that revealed the ambivalence of the respect he had always held for his mentor, and then his masterpiece, <span class="italic">Fashions in Church Furnishings, 1840&#150;1940</span> (1960), a quirky book that incorporates a great deal of material not discoverable elsewhere. Only Anson could have written and illustrated that volume, which referred to some of the thousands of churches he had visited and depicted the interiors of many, with period fashions among the congregation. In 1964 he had no fewer than four books published, including <span class="italic">Bishops at Large</span>, a detailed description of <i>episcopi vagantes</i> never equalled, which has acquired cult status.<br>
<br>In 1966 Anson's contribution to ecclesiastical history was marked when he was honoured by Pope Paul VI, who made him a knight of the order of St Gregory. In 1970 he returned once more to live on Caldy Island (which was by then occupied by Cistercians) and acquired the status of choir-oblate. His literary work continued and <span class="italic">Building up the Waste Places</span> (1973) returned to familiar themes of Caldy and elsewhere.<br>
<br>Anson left Caldy for Sancta Maria Abbey at Nunraw, East Lothian, when increasing infirmity made it impossible for him to remain on the island that meant so much to him. Eventually the brothers there were unable to care for him any more, and he died at St Raphael's Hospital, Edinburgh, on 10 July 1975. He was buried at Nunraw.<br>
<br>Peter Anson's dual preoccupations with monasticism and with the sea were reflected in his two autobiographies: <span class="italic">Harbour Head</span> (1944) dealt with maritime matters, while <span class="italic">A Roving Recluse</span> (1946) related his ecclesiastical experiences. Many of his drawings of ships are in the National Maritime Museum, and with his books on fishing and fishermen they provide a picture of a world that all but disappeared in the late twentieth century. He would be worthy of respect if they were all he produced, but his ecclesiastical work, although variable in quality, has not only chronicled episodes in which he himself was directly involved but has illuminated a number of diverse areas left unexplored by others. No more recent books have superseded his studies of Anglican monasticism or of church furnishings in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. The production of this large corpus of work is even more impressive when seen against the instability of Anson's life, with his frequent changes of residence and of direction, which did not cease once he finally abandoned his attempts to take on the religious life.<br>
