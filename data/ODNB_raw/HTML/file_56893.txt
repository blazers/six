<span class="headword">Lawrence,  Robert Daniel <span class="st"> [Robin]</span></span>  (1892&#150;1968), <span class="occ">physician</span>, was born on 18 November 1892 in Aberdeen, the second son of Thomas Lawrence, brush manufacturer, and Margaret Lawrence. He was educated at Aberdeen grammar school and at the university, and graduated MB in 1916. He joined the Royal Army Medical Corps and served in India until being invalided home in 1919. He intended a career in ear, nose, and throat surgery and took a junior appointment at King's College Hospital, London. While practising a mastoid operation on a corpse a bone chip flew in his eye. Because the injury was slow to heal he was admitted to hospital where it was found that he had diabetes, a diagnosis which at that time and at his age was fatal. Determining not to be a burden on his family and to eke out his remaining time as pleasantly as possible he moved to Florence to practise among the British colony there. Then came a dramatic telegram from his friend G. A. Harrison, biochemist at King's College Hospital: &#145;I have got some insulin. It works. Come back quick.&#146; Lawrence arrived on 29 May 1923 and had his first injection of insulin the next day. His life was saved.<br>
<br>Lawrence rapidly learnt how to manage diabetes and he acquired a large practice in the specialism. From the beginning he realized how important it was that doctors, nurses, and above all patients learned how to manage the disease. He published his famous and well-named book, <span class="italic">The Diabetic Life</span>, in 1925, and in 1929 he produced a practical guide, especially to his &#145;line&#146; diet, <span class="italic">The Diabetic ABC</span>. Both works ran to numerous editions. Lawrence married Doreen Nancy (Anna) Batson (<i>d</i>. 1964), daughter of Thomas Batson, schoolmaster, on 7 September 1928. They had three sons.<br>
<br>Lawrence's professional achievements came quickly&#151;membership (1927) and fellowship (1932) of the Royal College of Physicians, and appointment as physician in charge of the diabetic department at King's College Hospital in 1939, a department he had himself created with the help of friends and well-wishers and which became the largest in Britain. Doctors and patients came from all over the world to see &#145;RDL&#146;. He made special contributions to the treatment of diabetic coma and of pregnancy in the diabetic (with his colleague W. G. Oakley)&#151;previously nearly half the babies born to diabetic mothers had died. In 1934 with the public support of his friend and patient H. G. Wells he founded the Diabetic Association (later the British Diabetic Association); he was chairman of its executive council from 1934 to 1961. In 1950 he helped found the International Diabetic Federation and was its president until 1958. In that year he had a stroke and retired from hospital practice, though he continued in private work.<br>
<br>Lawrence was awarded the Banting medal of the American Diabetes Association in 1946 and was its Lilly lecturer in 1955. He was Banting lecturer of the British Diabetic Association in 1949, and honorary life president from 1962 to 1968. He was Oliver Sharpey lecturer of the Royal College of Physicians in 1946. In 1964 he was awarded an honorary LLD from Toronto University.<br>
<br>Lawrence was a highly individual, even flamboyant figure as a consultant physician, but few doctors have made a greater contribution to the care of patients. He dominated the diabetic scene in Britain to a unique extent from the mid-1920s until the 1950s. He was an enthusiastic golfer, a keen player of hockey and tennis (real and lawn), and a fisherman; and he loved music. He was Presbyterian by upbringing but lost his religious faith in early adult life. He died peacefully at his home, 7 Sheffield Terrace, London, on 27 August 1968.<br>
