<span class="headword">Lysons,  Daniel</span>  (1762&#150;1834), <span class="occ">antiquary</span>, was born on 28 April 1762, probably at Rodmarton rectory, Gloucestershire, the elder son of Samuel Lysons (1730&#150;1804), rector of Rodmarton and Cherrington, and his wife, Mary (1734&#150;1791), daughter of Samuel Peach of Chalford in the same county. He had a brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17298/', "Samuel Lysons (bap. 1763, d. 1819)")</script>, antiquary and archaeologist, and a sister, Mary (1765&#150;1848).<br>
<br>After attending Bath grammar school Lysons went to Oxford, matriculating from St Mary Hall on 26 March 1779. He graduated BA in 1782 and proceeded MA in 1785. He was ordained and served as assistant curate of Mortlake from 1784 to 1789 and curate of Putney from 1789 to 1800. At this time he began work for his <span class="italic">Environs of London</span> (4 vols., 1792&#150;6), a topographical account of the parishes within 12 miles of London. A contemporary recounted that Lysons &#145;spent seven hours up to his knees in water in the vaults of Stepney Church copying epitaphs&#146;  (Fleming, 49) and he extended this industry and meticulousness to all his work. He treats Surrey parishes in the first volume, which includes notable demographic sections compiled from primary sources. This volume was only partly superseded by <span class="italic">The History and Antiquities of Surrey</span> of Owen Manning and William Bray (3 vols., 1804&#150;14). The second and third volumes cover Middlesex parishes and are a great advance on previous works. The sections on Essex parishes draw quite heavily on <span class="italic">The History and Antiquities of the County of Essex</span> (2 vols., 1762&#150;8) of Philip Morant but their range is greater, covering births and baptisms and agriculture. The work was supplemented by <span class="italic">A Historical Account of those Parishes in &hellip; Middlesex &hellip; not Described in the &#145;Environs&#146;</span> (1800), and in 1811 by a second edition of and a supplement to the <span class="italic">Environs</span>. Many of the illustrations were drawn and etched by Lysons and his brother Samuel and the whole represented a very considerable antiquarian achievement.<br>
<br>The <span class="italic">Environs</span> was dedicated to Horace Walpole, a close friend of the two brothers and their keen correspondent. Walpole nicknamed Daniel &#145;Stumpity&#146; or &#145;Stumpety Stump&#146;, perhaps a reference to a limp, or to his incessant toil and travels. He talks of &#145;the two Lysons, and their strong legs and activity and perseverance. Of their being so absorbed by their pursuits as to believe those who they speak to are equally interested with themselves&#146;  (Lewis, 15.334). Despite the gentle mockery Walpole was obviously fond of the two and had earlier appointed Daniel Lysons his &#145;chaplain&#146;. The brothers had other well-placed friends and connections; their correspondence with Thomas Lawrence, who painted them both, and Mrs Piozzi survives.<br>
<br>On the death of his uncle, the physician <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17295/', "Daniel Lysons (1727&#150;1800)")</script>, Lysons inherited Hempsted Court and the family estates in Gloucestershire. On 12 May 1801 he married, at Bath, Sarah (1779/80&#150;1808), eldest daughter of Lieutenant-Colonel Thomas Carteret Hardy of the York fusiliers. They had two daughters, Sarah (1802&#150;1833) and Charlotte (1807&#150;1848), and two sons, Daniel (1804&#150;1814) and the antiquary <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17299/', "Samuel Lysons (1806&#150;1877)")</script>. In 1804 Lysons succeeded to the family living of Rodmarton.<br>
<br>The two Lysons brothers collaborated on <span class="italic">Magna Britannia, being a concise topographical account of the several counties of Great Britain</span>. It was intended to fill the gap between large-scale county histories and Camden's <span class="italic">Britannia</span>, and was even more ambitious than the <span class="italic">Beauties of England and Wales</span>, on which work had recently begun. The brothers made personal visits to collect material and still more was collected, following established practice, by circulating printed questionnaires to local worthies, the post office exceptionally allowing replies by clergymen to be sent free of charge. The first volume of <span class="italic">Magna Britannia</span>, covering Bedfordshire, Berkshire, and Buckinghamshire, appeared in 1806; Cambridgeshire, Cheshire, Cornwall, Cumberland, Derbyshire, and Devon had also been published by 1822, when the work ended. The decision to curtail the project was taken on the death of Samuel Lysons in 1819; Daniel, who was extremely fond of him as well as dependent on his expert archaeological skills, declared: &#145;I cannot go on with[out] my fellow labourer. Our lives wd not have sufficed to the completion had they been protracted even to old age. It is as well to give up now&#146;  (Steer, 49). The papers amassed in compiling the work are at BL Add. MSS 9408&#150;9471.<br>
<br>Unsurprisingly there are parts of <span class="italic">Magna Britannia</span>, such as that on Buckinghamshire, where the Lysons brothers seem on weaker ground than Daniel Lysons did in Middlesex, but overall the standard of the work is extremely high. Although their emphasis on church and manor was traditional, they included new material on such topics as commerce, population, and manufacture, and were far less preoccupied than many antiquaries with arms and pedigrees, and far less concerned than local topographers to rehearse the glories of the county.<br>
<br>On 2 July 1813 Lysons married Josepha Catherine Susanna (1780/81&#150;1868), daughter of John Gilbert Cooper of Thurgarton Priory, Nottinghamshire; they had one child, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17297/', "Daniel Lysons (1816&#150;1898)")</script>. Lysons was a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries (1790) and of the Royal (1797) and Linnean societies. In addition to his antiquarian writings he published several religious works and collected cuttings from newspapers which were subsequently deposited at the British Museum. His <span class="italic">History of the origin and progress of the meeting of the three choirs of Gloucester, Worcester, and Hereford</span> (1812) remains a standard work of reference on that festival. He died at Hempsted Court on 3 January 1834 and was buried at Rodmarton.<br>
<br>Lysons was one of many clergyman&#150;topographers but he had the advantage of ample means, an excellent collaborator in his brother, and very considerable scholarly and artistic talent. His work stands out for his ability to organize and present clearly a mass of material, for the emphasis he laid on primary sources such as parish records, deeds, and censuses, and for his scrupulous citing of sources. His documented accounts corrected those of earlier antiquaries who had relied on folk memories, and set the standard for successors, including the <span class="roman">Victoria History of the Counties of England</span>. The contents of his books were more widely copied than his methods, and the volumes remain of value nearly 200 years after their publication.<br>
