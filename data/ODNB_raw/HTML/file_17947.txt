<span class="headword">Mann,  Robert James</span>  (1817&#150;1886), <span class="occ">medical practitioner and writer on science</span>, was born in Norwich on 5 January 1817, the second of four children and only son of James Mann (<i>c</i>.1787&#150;1820/21), watchmaker and jeweller, and his wife, Elizabeth Hilling of Horstead, Norfolk. He was four when his father died, leaving his mother in straitened circumstances. As a result he was brought up by an aunt and uncle in London until about 1830, thereafter in Norfolk. Apart from a little education at a school in London, mostly from the Latin master, the only competent teacher, he was self-taught. He had a craving for books and became especially interested in botany, geology, and the physical sciences. At seventeen Mann was apprenticed to the surgeon of the Norwich Dispensary. Then, in September 1837, he enrolled at University College, London, where he studied anatomy, physiology, medicine, surgery, midwifery, obstetrics, botany, and medical jurisprudence and, for part of 1840, dressed for the professor of clinical surgery, Robert Liston. He became a licentiate of the Society of Apothecaries on 16 April 1840 and a member of the Royal College of Surgeons on 26 June 1840. That same year the first of his many publications appeared, a list of central Norfolk's flowering plants, published in the <span class="italic">Natural History Magazine</span>.<br>
<br>From 1840 to 1853 Mann made his living in Norfolk as a general practitioner and surgeon, first in Norwich (from the autumn of 1840 for about a year), then in the village of Buxton (until 1849), and finally in Aylsham, where, on 1 October 1850, he married Charlotte Elizabeth (<i>b</i>. 1822/3), daughter of the Revd John Neville White of Tivetshall, Norfolk. In the autumn of 1853 he turned to writing as his principal means of livelihood but continued his medical profession on a casual basis. To help alleviate his wife's chest ailments, he chose to spend the next few winters and springs at Ventnor, Isle of Wight, the summers and autumns in Norfolk. He qualified as a physician by gaining, on 27 March 1854, his MD from the University of St Andrews.<br>
<br>At Buxton Mann developed an interest in astronomy. He published <span class="italic">The Planetary and Stellar Universe</span> (his first book) in 1845 and soon afterwards built his own observatory. His second book, on elementary chemistry, appeared in 1848 and <span class="italic">The Book of Health</span>, a volume in <span class="roman">Gleig's School Series</span>, followed in 1850. While at Aylsham he published further works on astronomy and, in 1851, the first of his many articles for <span class="italic">Chambers's Edinburgh Journal</span>. At Ventnor he became friendly with the poet laureate, Alfred Tennyson, who sanctioned and approved a sketch he published in 1856, <span class="italic">Tennyson's &#145;Maud&#146; Vindicated: an Explanatory Essay</span>. Also at Ventnor he wrote the first of his many articles for the <span class="italic">Edinburgh Review</span>.<br>
<br>In October 1857, at the invitation of Dr John Colenso, bishop of Natal, Mann became lay head of Colenso's missionary station near Pietermaritzburg and a teacher of medical and scientific subjects. He found the work frustrating and was greatly relieved when, in July 1859, the lieutenant-governor of Natal appointed him the colony's superintendent of education. When he returned to England on secondment in March 1866, he left a system of public education which proved effective and enduring, a legacy of his diligence and zeal and his ability to manage limited means carefully. While in Natal he had taken up photography, pursued his interest in astronomy, served as a director of the Natal Bank for several years, organized the Natal court at the London Exhibition of 1862, and had written many books and articles, some of them about Natal, others educational. Encouraged by Sir John Herschel he had taken up meteorology. He observed the weather methodically from early 1858 to early 1866, returned his records to the meteorological department of the Board of Trade, and published a number of works on the climate of Natal.<br>
<br>Back in England Mann served as emigration agent for Natal until 1869, when the colony's legislative council closed his office. He thereupon resigned as superintendent of education, remained in London, and devoted the rest of his life to scientific and literary pursuits. He organized scientific exhibitions and published many articles of a popular nature, the majority intended for young people. He belonged to the Photographic Society from 1866 to 1878 and served on its council for several years. He joined the Meteorological Society in 1867 and served it as president from 1873 to 1875. He served the Society of Arts as secretary of its African (later foreign and colonial) section from 1874 to 1886. He was elected a fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society in 1855, the Royal Geographical Society in 1866, and the Royal College of Surgeons in 1878.<br>
<br>Mann's enthusiasm for Natal never waned and he was, indeed, immediately before his death, busy preparing the catalogue of the Natal court for the Colonial and Indian Exhibition held in London in 1886. He suffered a seizure on 2 August 1886 and died two days later at his home, 5 Kingsdown Villas, Bolingbroke Grove, Wandsworth, London, where he had lived since 1870. Thus passed a man who was kindly, honest, unselfish, and modest. He was buried in Kensal Green cemetery on 9 August and his estate passed entirely to his widow, there being no offspring of the marriage.<br>
