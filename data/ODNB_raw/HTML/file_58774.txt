<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Dunsterville,  Lionel Charles</span>  (1865&#150;1946), <span class="occ">army officer and literary prototype</span>, was born on 9 November 1865 in Lausanne, Switzerland, the son of Lieutenant-General Lionel D'Arcy Dunsterville (1830&#150;1912) of the Indian army and his wife, Susan Ellen (1835&#150;1875). The family moved to Jersey and then to the Isle of Wight, and Dunsterville was brought up by his older sisters as his mother was an invalid: &#145;I needed a strong hand, and I got five pair of strong hands. Bless them&#146;  (Dunsterville, <span class="italic">Stalky's Reminiscences</span>, 16). He was then sent to Woolwich under the care of an officer's widow, with whom he remained for five years.<br>
<br>In 1875, about the time his mother died, Dunsterville began to attend the United Services College at Westward Ho! in Devon, where he was to be a studymate and boon companion of the young Rudyard Kipling. &#145;I was in the passive condition of a bundle of Chinese fire-crackers to which his fertile brain eagerly applied the torch&#146;  (Dunsterville, <span class="italic">Stalky's Reminiscences</span>, 26), Dunsterville later recalled. He is too modest by half; before Kipling's arrival in 1878 the young squib had been thoroughly bullied, had failed in an attempt to run away to sea, and had almost blown himself up with gunpowder. With the advent of Kipling and George Charles Beresford, Dunsterville and his two cronies read and lolled out of bounds in a hut in the furze-bushes, smoked cigars Dunsterville had helped smuggle into England from the continent, and hatched plots against those who had &#145;incurred our odium&#146;. The result was his &#145;incorporation&#146; into Kipling's <span class="italic">Stalky &amp; Co.</span> (1899), perhaps Dunsterville's most lasting claim to fame. In later life he noted that<blockquote>[n]o amount of explanation could convince the public that Stalky is a character of pure fiction and I frequently have to undergo a severe examination on the details of exploits which are purely imaginary. Certainly the episodes narrated are very much like things that did happen fifty years ago in the old college at Westward Ho! And it is certain that Kipling, Beresford and myself shared a study and were generally at war with masters and boys who incurred our dislike. Our various plots were often highly ingenious and often hugely successful. From this solid foundation arises the noble structure of &#145;Stalky &amp; Co&#146;. (<span class="italic">New York Times</span>)</blockquote>Dunsterville subsequently passed the army examination and attended the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, from 1883 to 1884. Commissioned in the Royal Sussex regiment, he was posted to Malta, where he received numerous mess fines, and then to Egypt, where he was almost arrested for gambling debts. Ordered to India, Dunsterville transferred to the 24th Punjab regiment and subsequently to the 20th. While he became acclimatized to Indian army life, it is clear that his exuberant tendencies remained; on one occasion when asked to suggest a new march-past tune, he offered &#145;The Man that Broke the Bank at Monte Carlo&#146;. He admits to having &#145;acquired some renown as a singer of somewhat vulgar music-hall songs&#146;  (Dunsterville, <span class="italic">Stalky's Reminiscences</span>, 106), and on another occasion was accused of having stolen a horse and trap. Bitten by a mad dog in 1891, Dunsterville was sent to Paris for treatment by Louis Pasteur and also began a lifelong friendship with the archaeologist and explorer Sir Aurel Stein. In 1894&#150;5 Dunsterville took part in the Waziristan campaign before coming down with rheumatic fever (a native friend wished to sew him up in the skin of a dead sheep for ten days, but was overruled).<br>
<br>Subsequently Dunsterville visited Germany and Russia to learn and perfect these languages: &#145;it took me some little time to learn the &#147;song&#148; wherein resides the spirit of the language&#146;  (Dunsterville, <span class="italic">Stalky's Reminiscences</span>, 149). Throughout his career Dunsterville possessed both an ease with people and a facility for foreign languages. A friend noted of &#145;Stalky&#146; that<blockquote>He speaks Russian like a Slav. In Peking (Beijing) he was the only Englishman who could converse easily with representatives of the different powers in their own tongue. In his command of Pushtu and all the patois of the Northwest Frontier, he is second to none. And he can interpret what is in the hearts of strange peoples as well as what is on their lips. (<span class="italic">New York Times</span>)</blockquote>On 9 November 1897 he married Margaret Emily, the daughter of Colonel W. Keyworth of Bishopsteignton, Devon, whom he had met while in Wiesbaden. Dunsterville returned with his wife to India, where they hopscotched across the country according to his orders, moving on no fewer than five occasions.<br>
<br>It was at this time that Dunsterville published his own newspaper, <span class="italic">The Jhansi Herald</span>: it was &#145;not a financial success &hellip; but the unlimited opportunity it gave me of libelling my friends amply compensated me for the money I lost by it&#146;  (Dunsterville, <span class="italic">Stalky's Reminiscences</span>, 171). In 1900 he and his unit were ordered to China to help suppress the Boxer uprising. He vividly describes the effects of halting a company in hobnailed boots on the ice, playing early morning music for the Royal Navy (the officers of the <i>Algerian</i> threatened to open fire if the noise did not cease at once), and &#145;capturing&#146; towns whose cannon had red rags hanging out of their muzzles: &#145;[t]his was done to make us believe that these were flames coming out of the muzzles of the guns and it was hoped that we would retire under the impression that the guns were firing at us&#146;  (ibid., 187). In 1902 the Dunstervilles' first son was born before he and his wife received orders back to India. The family visited England in 1903&#151;he almost dying of malaria on the passage&#151;and returned to India, after a continental tour, in late 1904. Dunsterville, who took command of the 20th Punjab regiment as lieutenant-colonel in 1908, continued his session there until early 1914, a daughter being born in 1911.<br>
<br>At the outbreak of the First World War Dunsterville was appointed a train-conducting officer in France&#151;and later wrote an amusing account of being shunted in cattle trucks, with cheeses and sides of bacon, as well as the passengers, being hurled in the air. A year later he assumed the command of Jhelium brigade in India, and he saw action for the next two years on the north-west frontier. A Sikh poet memorialized at least some of his achievements here, but Dunsterville was unable to obtain a copy as the gentleman in question was also a shopkeeper who had copied his verses on the back of his customers' bills! He was appointed CB in 1916. Early in 1918 Dunsterville was appointed head of a mission to Tiflis, Georgia, involving the reorganization of revolutionary Russian troops using a core group of officers and NCOs pulled from various fronts to oppose the Turkish push towards Baku's oilfields and the Caucasus. However, &#145;Dunster force&#146; was understaffed and undersupplied at best, and had no real impact up to its disbanding in September 1918. The Russian General Baratov is alleged to have commented &#145;&#147;Dunsterforce&#148;! &hellip; I know Dunster all right, but where is the <i>Force</i>?&#146;  (Dunsterville, <span class="italic">Stalky's Reminiscences</span>, 277). Indeed one of Dunsterville's officers improvised &#145;a very fine armoured car out of a Ford van and some tissue-paper &hellip; [A]s no one was allowed near enough to poke their fingers through the &#147;armour&#148;, it terrorized the whole countryside&#146;  (ibid., 278). Promoted major-general in June 1918, he later returned to India, where he commanded the Agra brigade until his retirement in 1920.<br>
<br>In retirement Dunsterville participated in many activities, including the founding of the Kipling Society&#151;about which Kipling rather unfairly commented, &#145;How would <i>you</i> like to be turned into an anatomical specimen, before you were dead, and shown upon a table, once a quarter?&#146; Dunsterville wrote a number of fascinating volumes of memoirs, including <span class="italic">The Adventures of Dunsterforce</span> (1920), <span class="italic">Stalky's Reminiscences</span> (1928), and <span class="italic">Stalky Settles Down</span> (1932). He was also the author of such fictional works as <span class="italic">And Obey</span> (1925) and <span class="italic">More Yarns</span> (1931). He died at Camelot, Barton Hill Road, St Mary Church, Torquay, on 18 March 1946.<br>
