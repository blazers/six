<span class="headword">Clifford,  Camilla Antoinetta <span class="st"> [Camille]</span></span>  (<em>c.</em>1885&#150;1971), <span class="occ">actress</span>, was born in Belgium, the daughter of Reynold Clifford. She was brought up in New York and became a chorus girl, appearing in 1902 in the musical comedy <span class="italic">The Defender</span> at the Herald Square Theater in New York. In 1903 she won a beauty contest to find a Miss New York, organized by Charles Dana Gibson, the popular illustrator, whose drawings of &#145;the American Girl&#146; from 1890 onwards had idealized American womanhood and had led millions of young women to copy her &#145;look&#146;. When <span class="italic">The Prince of Pilsen</span>, a musical comedy by Frank Pixley, opened at the Broadway Theater, New York, in March 1903, Camille Clifford appeared in the chorus representing New York in &#145;The American Girl&#146;, also known as &#145;The Song of the Cities&#146;, in which a succession of girls paraded across the stage, each representing a different American city: they became known as the &#145;Gibson girls&#146;.<br>
<br>When <span class="italic">The Prince of Pilsen</span> opened at the Shaftesbury Theatre in London in May 1904, Camille Clifford, with her hourglass figure (and reputedly an 11 inch waist) was a sensation: after the show closed at the end of September and the company returned to the United States she remained in London to join the cast of <span class="italic">The Catch of the Season</span> by Seymour Hicks and Cosmo Hamilton. A musical comedy based on the story of Cinderella, this had opened a few weeks earlier at the Vaudeville Theatre. The characters included a Mr. William Gibson and his ten tall daughters, who paraded across the stage singing:<blockquote>
<div>Seeing we were proving a sensation<br>
</div>
<div>We thought we might become a bigger one<br>
</div>
<div>By walking in single file<br>
</div>
<div>In the Dana Gibson style.<br>
</div>
<div> 
<br>
</div>
<div>We realize the pictures, tall and divinely fair,<br>
</div>
<div>By society invited, we go everywhere,<br>
</div>
<div>We've copied every detail, dress, stately walk, and curls<br>
</div>
<div>And everybody calls us &#145;Dana Gibson Girls&#146;.<br>
</div>
</blockquote>Wearing very beautiful clothes designed by Lady Duff-Gordon following the fashions sketched by Charles Dana Gibson, and made by her firm, Mme Lucille of Hanover Square, the Gibson Girls became the most popular feature of the show when Camille Clifford took on the role of Miss Sylvia Gibson, appearing in a number, &#145;The Gibson Girl&#146;, written specially for her. Although her singing voice was non-existent, she was given a few lines to speak, and a new song, which declared:<blockquote>
<div>As she comes strolling down she sets their hearts in a whirl<br>
</div>
<div>She is the cutest little pearl, Sylvia, the Gibson Girl.<br>
</div>
</blockquote>
<span class="italic">The Catch of the Season</span> was followed in 1906 by a new musical comedy, <span class="italic">The Belle of Mayfair</span> by C. H. Brookfield and Cosmo Hamilton, a modern <span class="italic">Romeo and Juliet</span>, which opened at the Vaudeville Theatre in April 1906. In a part written specially for her Clifford played the Duchess of Dunmow, the American wife of an English duke, and was given a song &#145;Why do they Call me a Gibson Girl&#146;, and also sang &#145;I'm a duchess&#146;. Her billing as &#145;the Original Gibson Girl&#146; attracted so much publicity that the leading lady, Edna May, walked out of the show.<br>
<br>Camille Clifford retired from the stage at the end of 1906 after touring in <span class="italic">A Grand Flying Matinee</span>, and on 11 October 1906 married the Hon. Henry Lyndhurst Bruce (1881&#150;1914), eldest son of Henry Campbell Bruce, second Baron Aberdare. They had one daughter, Margaret, born in 1909, who died in infancy. A captain in the 3rd battalion, the Royal Scots, her husband was killed in action in December 1914. After his death she returned briefly to the stage, appearing in the music-hall <span class="italic">The Girl of the Future</span> in 1916, but retired again in 1917 on her marriage on 9 August 1917 to Captain John Meredyth Jones Evans MC (<i>b</i>. 1894), of the Royal Welch Fusiliers, son of Owen Lloyd Jones Evans of Broom Hall, Caernarfon. She was a widow when she died on 28 June 1971 at her home, Wishanger Lodge, Headley, near Alton, Hampshire.<br>
