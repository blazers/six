<span class="headword">Woodall, Sir  Corbet</span>  (1841&#150;1916), <span class="occ">gas engineer</span>, was born on 27 August 1841 at Liverpool, the youngest of the three sons of William Woodall, manager of Liverpool gasworks, and his wife, Martha Basson. After education at the Crescent School, Liverpool (run by Congregationalists), he followed his brothers into the gas industry; he became the most notable of a dynasty of gas engineers stretching over four generations. After a couple of years gaining experience under his eldest brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/37007/', "William Woodall")</script>, at Burslem in the Potteries, Corbet moved to London in 1859 to work at Woolwich under Robert Morton, one of the leading gas engineers of the day.<br>
<br>When he was twenty-four Woodall was appointed engineer and manager of the small Stockton-on-Tees municipal gas works; he was one of many young men given major responsibilities in the rapidly expanding industry. There he was responsible for rebuilding the works on a substantially larger scale. Woodall's talents were quickly recognized and he began to act as a consultant to other gas undertakings in the north-east. After four years he returned to London as engineer and manager of the large Vauxhall gasworks of the Phoenix Company, where he could again combine his duties with private consultancy. His reputation as an engineer grew rapidly. He was interested not only in the making of gas but also its utilization. When electric lighting first threatened the gas lighting market in the late 1870s, he worked closely with a lighting manufacturer, William Sugg, to improve standards of street lighting. Their technical changes and designs were particularly successful and were widely adopted both in Britain and overseas. Woodall presented many technical papers to the Institution of Gas Engineers, of which he was elected president in 1877&#150;8, 1897&#150;8, and 1912&#150;13; he was also an active member of the Institution of Civil Engineers and the Institution of Mechanical Engineers. When the Phoenix was taken over in 1880 by the neighbouring South Metropolitan Gas Company under Sir George Livesey, Woodall's near contemporary, his consultancy practice was so well established that he was able to devote himself to it full-time.<br>
<br>Woodall soon became recognized as one of the world's leading gas engineers, and he travelled widely abroad. As well as inspecting gasworks and advising on improved methods of gas making, he was in great demand to represent companies, giving evidence before parliamentary committees and acting as valuer or arbitrator in proceedings between companies. In 1889 he visited the USA on behalf of the Gas Light and Coke Company to advise on the practicability of new gas-making methods as an alternative to the traditional coal carbonization process used in Britain. In 1897 Woodall was invited to join the court of Gas Light and Coke; he also became a director of a number of other British and foreign gas companies.<br>
<br>In 1865 Woodall married Anne, daughter of W. H. Whiteman of Craydon; they had five daughters and five sons, four of whom entered the gas industry. Henry went into partnership in his father's consultancy and also became a director of the Gas Light and Coke Company. Harold was an engineer at Bournemouth and, in partnership with Arthur Duckham, developed the use of vertical retorts for gas making in Britain in place of the traditional horizontal retorts. Their contracting firm, Woodall&#150;Duckham, became internationally known.<br>
<br>For some years before Woodall became a director of Gas Light and Coke, the company, which operated largely north of the Thames, had been in fierce rivalry with South Metropolitan, which supplied gas in south London. Although Gas Light and Coke had been the first gas company established in Britain (in 1812), South Metropolitan under Livesey was more technically advanced and better managed, and could therefore sell its gas much more cheaply. This caused considerable public unease, but with Woodall's guidance and great practical and managerial experience, the rehabilitation of the Gas Light and Coke Company began. Woodall's influence in technical matters was complemented in commercial matters by David Milne-Watson. On the death in 1906 of the governor of the company, Sir William Makins, Woodall was appointed to succeed him as head of what had become the largest gas company in the world.<br>
<br>As a young engineer, Woodall defended existing patterns of labour relations against nascent trade unionism. In later life he became convinced of the advantages of the partnership between managers and employees so enthusiastically promoted by his friend Livesey. When Woodall became governor of Gas Light and Coke he introduced &#145;co-partnership&#146; to the company and, following his lead, it was adopted by far more companies after Livesey's death than during the latter's lifetime. Woodall was also instrumental in developing various training schemes for employees. He helped to form a Territorial Army battalion largely composed of employees, of which he was honorary colonel. In 1912 he received the honorary degree of DSc from the University of Leeds. In the following year, he was knighted for services to the gas industry. A Liberal in politics, he was active only at a local level, whereas his brother William was MP for Stoke-on-Trent (1880&#150;85), and Hanley (1885&#150;1900). He was appointed a JP for Bromley, Kent, in 1911. He was a committed Congregationalist and a generous supporter of charities.<br>
<br>In 1914 Woodall began to suffer from heart problems and spent much time in the south of France; but he never fully recovered, and died at Phyllis Court, Torquay, on 17 May 1916. Survived by his wife, he left estate valued at &pound;97,442 11<i>s</i>. 9<i>d</i>. In a fitting tribute, his successor as governor of the Gas Light and Coke Company, David Milne-Watson, argued that he &#145;would have made a great statesman, a great lawyer or a great diplomatist&#146;  (<span class="italic">DBB</span>). Along with Sir George Livesey, he was one of the leading gas engineers of the time.<br>
