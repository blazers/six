<span class="headword">Clerk, Sir  George Russell</span>  (1800&#150;1889), <span class="occ">administrator in India</span>, was born at Worting House, Hampshire, in 1800, the eldest son of John Clerk (1759&#150;1842) and his wife, Anne (<i>d</i>. 1820), daughter of Carew Mildmay of Shawford House, Hampshire. In 1815 he was nominated to the Bengal civil service and entered the East India Company's college at Haileybury.<br>
<br>Clerk arrived in Bengal in February 1818 and initially appeared destined for a career in the secretariat; as early as 1822 he was first assistant to the secretary in the secret and political department. Some time in the 1820s, however, he began an affair with Mary, wife of Colonel Stewart, but was unable to marry her until Stewart died some years later. When Calcutta society refused to receive Mary, Clerk, who had been disinherited by his father over the affair, opted for a career on Bengal's far-flung western frontier.<br>
<br>In 1829 Clerk became first assistant to the resident in Delhi; in 1831, political agent at Ambala; in March 1840, agent to the governor-general for the affairs of the Punjab; and, finally, in October 1842, envoy to the court of Lahore. He effectively controlled British relations with Lahore from 1831 until 1843, and, in contrast to Auckland's pro-Afghanistan policy, advocated the construction of a strong Sikh buffer state in the Punjab to break what he saw as the chain of Islam running from central Asia to Hindustan.<br>
<br>In 1843 Clerk was appointed lieutenant-governor of the North-Western Provinces. Distrustful of the social-engineering objectives of the utilitarians, he briefly interrupted the levelling land revenue policies then in vogue in the North-Western Provinces, before being promoted in November 1844 to a seat on the executive council in Calcutta. In January 1847 he was appointed governor of Bombay, but was forced by ill health to retire early the following year.<br>
<br>Back in England, Clerk declined the governorship of the Cape of Good Hope, but went instead to South Africa in 1853 as a commissioner to negotiate the boundaries of the Orange Free State. In 1857 he became secretary of the India board and in 1858 permanent under-secretary of state for India. In May 1860 he again accepted the governorship of Bombay but two years later, as before, was compelled by ill health to resign. In 1863 he was appointed to the secretary of state's council for India, which position he retained until his retirement in 1876.<br>
<br>Clerk was a Conservative, who trusted to experience and common sense rather than political theorizing. He disapproved, on both financial and moral grounds, of the annexations of Sind, the Punjab, and Oudh, arguing that the rebellion of 1857 was largely the result of Britain breaking faith with her former allies. He disliked evangelicalism and was scathing about missionary hopes of universal Christianization.<br>
<br>Clerk was made a KCB in 1848, KCSI in 1861, and GCSI in 1866. He died at his home, 33 Elm Park Gardens, Middlesex, on 25 July 1889 and was buried at Bournemouth. He was survived by his three sons: the eldest, Claude, who was born in 1833 and became tutor to the nizam of Hyderabad; General Sir Godfrey Clerk (1835&#150;1908); and Colonel John Clerk (<i>d</i>. 1919). Mary Clerk had died in 1878.<br>
