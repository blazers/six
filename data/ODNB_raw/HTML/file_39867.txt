<span class="headword">Fisher,  Alan Wainwright</span>  (1922&#150;1988), <span class="occ">trade unionist</span>, was born in Birmingham on 20 June 1922, the fourth of five sons (there were no daughters) of Thomas Wainwright Fisher, accountant, and his wife, Ethel Agnes Guest. He was educated at Sparkhill Commercial College, Birmingham. He went to work at the National Union of Public Employees (NUPE), becoming a junior clerk in 1939. On the outbreak of the Second World War that year, he began to serve in the Fleet Air Arm. After demobilization in 1945, he returned to NUPE.<br>
<br>By 1953 Fisher had become the midlands divisional officer, and in 1962 he was appointed assistant general secretary. NUPE was the fastest-growing trade union at the time, its development assisted by Fisher in three main ways. First, as assistant general secretary in the early 1960s, he saw more clearly than most that NUPE needed to break with the organizational principles and oppositional ideology of the previous general secretary, the &#145;Welsh fire-eater&#146;, Bryn Jones. Jones was an old-time centralist-socialist, never so happy as when denouncing other Trades Union Congress leaders who refused to take seriously his version of militant industrial unionism. Fisher saw that NUPE must make its peace with the leaders of the &#145;general unions&#146; within the general council of the TUC, seeking for allies in a common struggle against public sector employers and hostile governments.<br>
<br>Second, after involvement in his first major national dispute, the &#145;dirty jobs&#146; strike of 1970, Fisher, who had become general secretary in 1968, sensed that NUPE itself was in need of radical reform. As he saw it, the key lay in the development and training of lay activists, integrated into union government as accredited shop stewards. He even came to argue that membership growth was a function of organizational effectiveness, and that this probably involved a process of constant change and adaptation. To this end he sponsored, and sought to implement, the findings of the 1974 Warwick report, a radical plan for constitutional change written by three friendly sociologists. Most members of the general council would not have dared to commission and publish such an investigation into the working of their union. Nobody but Fisher would have handed the job to students of the subject.<br>
<br>Fisher's third major contribution was double-edged and ill-timed. He decided NUPE needed a rallying cry, to help to achieve real progress for its lowest paid members and attract further recruits. This took the form of a campaign for a national minimum wage, high enough to benefit the union's membership, and potential membership, in the National Health Service and local government. It was to be achieved partly by militant wage bargaining and partly by legislation. Unfortunately he converted the TUC to this policy just before Labour's prime minister, James Callaghan, committed his government to a pay limit of 5 per cent in 1978.<br>
<br>In the mythology of the labour movement, the difference between Fisher's aspirations and Callaghan's inflexibility led inevitably to the series of disputes known as the &#145;winter of discontent&#146;. This was the prelude to the return of a Conservative government in April 1979. Of course the truth was more complex. The 5 per cent limit was unacceptable to many employers as well as to all other unions. Once into the dispute Fisher did his best to secure a settlement that would avoid a total government defeat. All the same, he could not quite escape some blame. He enjoyed his moment of history, until he realized the cost.<br>
<br>Fisher remained as NUPE's general secretary until 1982. He was a member of the TUC's general council from 1968 to 1982, and chairman of the TUC (1980&#150;81). He was also a member of the board of the British Overseas Airways Corporation (1970&#150;72), British Airways (1972&#150;82), and the London Electricity Board (1970&#150;80). He was a director of Harland and Wolff, shipbuilders (1975&#150;83), a governor of Henley Administrative Staff College (1977&#150;83), and a member of the board of the Council for Educational Development Overseas (governor from 1970).<br>
<br>Fisher was a modest and extremely funny man, with the best line in trade-union repartee of any union leader of his generation. He had an effortless fluency, and his high-speed loquacity added to his charm. He was of average height, and until his long and fatal illness he looked younger than his years. Despite his illness, his high spirits and good nature did not desert him. He was married three times. In 1946 he married Peggy, daughter of Oscar Kinipple, technical representative. There were no children. Peggy died in 1956, and in 1958 he married Joyce Tinniswood, whose father was a farmer. They had two sons and one daughter. The marriage was dissolved in 1976, and in 1978 he married Ruth, formerly Woollerton, the daughter of Walter Henry Olliver, bank courier. There were no children of the third marriage. Fisher died of leukaemia on 20 March 1988 in Maelor Hospital, Wrexham.<br>
