<span class="headword">Dormer,  Robert</span>, first earl of Carnarvon  (1610?&#150;1643), <span class="occ">royalist army officer</span>, was the only son of Sir William Dormer, baronet (<i>d</i>. 1616), and Alice, daughter of Sir Richard Molyneux of Sefton, Lancashire. The Dormer family had risen to power and influence under the Tudors, gained court connections (<script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7836/', "Jane Su&#225;rez de Figueroa, n&#233;e Dormer")</script>, was a close friend of Mary Tudor), and were allied by marriage to such prominent midland and northern Catholic families as Catesby, Dacre, and Huddlestone. Robert Dormer's mother was a recusant and his sister married the later earl of Glamorgan. They acquired large holdings in Buckinghamshire and Oxfordshire. His grandfather, Sir Robert Dormer, prospered as a flockmaster, supplying wool and meat for the London market. He owned twenty-four manors in Buckinghamshire alone, and had an income of about &pound;6000 p.a.  (L. Stone, <span class="italic">The Crisis of the Aristocracy, 1558&#150;1641</span>, 1965, 761). He acquired the title of Baron Dormer of Wing, Buckinghamshire, on 30 June 1615. It was said that he paid &pound;10,000 for it in the first of the substantial sales of peerages at the Jacobean court. He was also appointed to the hereditary post of chief avenor or keeper of the king's hawks. Sir William Dormer predeceased his father, who died on 8 November 1616, leaving his grandson, a minor, heir to a great fortune. The king sold this lucrative wardship to one of his favourites, Philip Herbert, earl of Montgomery (later also earl of Pembroke) for &pound;4000.<br>
<br>Dormer was educated at Eton College between 1621 and 1624, and in April of the latter year matriculated at Exeter College, Oxford. He proceeded MA on 25 May 1627. Pembroke consolidated an expensive purchase by marrying the ward to his eldest daughter, Anne Sophia Herbert (<i>c</i>.1610&#150;1643), on 27 February 1625, when Dormer was probably fifteen. Before the wedding Dr Prideaux, vice-chancellor of Oxford, instructed the couple in religion, presumably to counteract the Catholic influence of the Dormer family. He may have had success with the bride, who refused later to take part in a court masque on a Sunday, but not with her husband. As office-holders the Dormers no doubt conformed, while retaining their old beliefs.<br>
<br>Shortly after the wedding Dormer set out on the grand tour. Unusually, after visiting Spain, France, and Italy, he journeyed to Turkey and the Middle East: he was a more observant traveller than most, according to Clarendon, whose eulogy on his death, in the <span class="italic">History of the Rebellion</span>, is the best source. Now a wealthy man in his own right, and well connected to the court (Pembroke was lord chamberlain of Charles I's household), he was further advanced in the peerage as Viscount Ascott and earl of Carnarvon in 1628. He was the very picture of a sumptuously attired Caroline courtier in the well-known Van Dyck portrait of the Herbert family at Wilton, painted about 1635. He too held an office in the household, and was the owner of a great house, Ascott, near Wing. He had Inigo Jones prepare plans for its enlargement, which the onset of war halted. The house fell into ruin later and is now lost. He also had a house in London, where a son, Charles (who was to succeed to the earldom), was born in 1632.<br>
<br>Appropriately to his position at court, Carnarvon was a keen follower of country sports. Later royalist apologists felt bound to admit that he was &#145;extreamly wild in his youth&#146;  (Lloyd, 372), and devoted to the &#145;looser exercises of pleasure, hunting, hawking, and the like&#146;  (Clarendon, <span class="italic">Hist. rebellion</span>, 3.178), if only to point the contrast with his later seriousness as a soldier. He loved gaming, and spent heavily. &#145;His Recreations were rather expensive than bruitish&#146;  (Lloyd, 369). He briefly served at sea, for in 1637 he was reported aboard the man-of-war <i>Triumph</i> in the Downs, presumably as a gentleman volunteer, enjoying shipboard life. After an excellent supper on a fine night, and with a good bed ready, he swore that &#145;by God's blood he would have three whores&#146;  (Conway to Gerrard, 10 July 1637, <span class="italic">Portland MSS</span>, 3.44).<br>
<br>When the bishops' wars loomed Carnarvon was appointed second in command to Pembroke of the regiment of horse raised by the royal household, and took part in the first campaign of 1639. In the second bishops' war he commanded a regiment of cavalry in 1640. A leading figure in Buckinghamshire, and acceptable to parliament, he was appointed lord lieutenant of the county in June 1641.<br>
<br>But early in 1642 Carnarvon detached himself from the Pembroke connection, and local opinion, by declaring for the king. He sided with his wife's brothers in deploring their father's support for the popular party, and was furious that Pembroke had used his proxy vote in the Lords against the king. In response to his father-in-law's bullying he is supposed to have said, &#145;leave me to my Honor and Allegiance&#146;  (Lloyd, 371). He was active in promoting the royal commission of array in Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire, unpromising territory for the king. He joined the royal court in the north, was knighted at York in April 1642, and was one of the peers who pledged financial support for the cause in June. By August he had raised one of the first regiments of 500 horse, a complex and expensive operation, speedily accomplished. All this activity earned him an early place in the list of those to be excepted from pardon by parliament. His regiment fought with distinction in Wilmot's left wing at Edgehill in October 1642. For his good service at the battle he was awarded, with 400 others, an honorary degree at Oxford in November. His house was plundered, and a convoy of plate and jewels, destined for the king at Oxford, seized.<br>
<br>Carnarvon took part in Rupert's successful assault on Cirencester in February 1643, and was commended for his mercy in capturing rather than killing the many runaways. In June he was lieutenant-general, under the marquess of Hertford, of the Oxford cavalry force sent to join Hopton's Cornish army advancing from the west. In several actions against Waller's army he showed himself a resourceful and daring cavalryman, who, &#145;with incomparable gallantry &hellip; always charged home&#146;  (Clarendon, <span class="italic">Hist. rebellion</span>, 3.86). He was wounded in the leg at the battle of Lansdown on 3 July 1643, however, and was temporarily replaced. With the foot under Hopton bottled up in Devizes by Waller's superior forces, Carnarvon and Hertford with the horse made their way with difficulty back to Oxford. He returned to take part as a volunteer in the battle of Roundway down, on 13 July. According to Clarendon it was his good knowledge of Waller's tactics and prompt advice to Lord Wilmot which helped to clinch the victory  (ibid., 3.85&#150;7, 98&#150;9).<br>
<br>After the fall of Bristol Carnarvon was sufficiently recovered to continue as general of the western army and lead an expedition (of about 2000 horse and dragoons) into Dorset, intended to follow up these successes in a &#145;malignant&#146; area. The cavaliers' reputation for invincibility was inflated by the stories told by former soldiers of Waller's army and defenders of Bristol returning to their homes. Carnarvon's horse must have been reassuringly well disciplined as well as victorious, and himself seen as someone who could be trusted to keep his word, for Dorchester and Weymouth, both famous for godliness, quickly surrendered to him, on generous terms, without a fight, on 2 and 5 August 1643. But when the rest of the army, mainly infantry, under Prince Maurice, arrived shortly after, they plundered the inhabitants anyway. Carnarvon, &#145;who was full of honour and justice upon all contracts&#146;, was so disgusted that he immediately resigned his command and rejoined the main army with the king at the siege of Gloucester  (Clarendon, <span class="italic">Hist. rebellion</span>, 3.158).<br>
<br>It is not certain which unit Carnarvon rode with to the first battle of Newbury, but he was one of several notables who perished that day, 20 September 1643. He had been fully engaged, charging Essex's lifeguard, as usual with success. But while he was rejoining his men a stray trooper, recognizing him, ran him through. His body was carried to Oxford and buried in Jesus College chapel. It was removed to Wing church in 1653. His wife had died in Oxford, of smallpox, in June 1643, and her body had been buried at Wing immediately after. The church contains many monuments to the family.<br>
<br>Carnarvon was a prominent landlord and courtier, whose family had strong Catholic leanings. He abandoned a life of pleasure in peacetime to devote himself, against the wishes of several powerful interests, including that of his father-in-law, to the royalist cause. He showed unexpected qualities of courage and organization in building and commanding part of the king's mounted arm, and was a successful colonel and (briefly) general in the field, before losing his life in battle. As a playboy turned gallant soldier, and exemplary man of honour, he was the subject of later cavalier eulogies.<br>
