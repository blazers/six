</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Lumisden,  Andrew</span>  (1720&#150;1801), <span class="occ">Jacobite politician and antiquary</span>, was the only son of William Lumisden (1688&#150;1756), an Edinburgh law agent and burgess, and Mary (<i>d</i>. 1755), daughter of Robert Bruce, a merchant of the same city; and the grandson of another Andrew Lumisden, the nonjuring bishop of Edinburgh (1654&#150;1733). Born into a family with marked Jacobite sympathies, he was educated for a career in the law, following both the precedent of his father and the traditional path for a Scottish gentleman into the respectable professions. However, the arrival in September 1745 of the highland army into Edinburgh prompted a dramatic break with his former existence. Having been deprived of the services of his original secretary, Prince Charles Edward, the Young Pretender, had asked Alexander Cunningham to fill the vacancy. Though refusing the offer himself, Cunningham warmly recommended Lumisden&#151;his second cousin&#151;as an individual who would ideally suit the post. Thereafter Lumisden served as the under-secretary and the first clerk of the treasury to the Young Pretender throughout the campaign of 1745&#150;6. He accompanied the army into England, supplied money for its current expenses, and left detailed and graphic manuscript accounts of the battles of Prestonpans, Falkirk, and Culloden, at which he was present  (now in NL Scot., MS 279). On the eve of the battle of Culloden (15 April 1746) special orders were given to ensure his safety, as he carried with him &#145;the sinews of war&#146;  (Dennistoun, 1.85), and following the defeat he fled the field, having first been entrusted with the safe keeping of the prince's seal. He obeyed the order to rendezvous with the other remnants of the Jacobite army at Ruthven on 17 April, only to hear that the Young Pretender had advised his followers to disband and to &#145;Let every man seek his own safety the best way he can&#146;  (Youngson, 261).<br>
<br>As a consequence of this Lumisden spent the next four months wandering the highlands as a hunted fugitive, his importance to the authorities underlined by his inclusion in the act of attainder issued by the Hanoverian government. He returned to Edinburgh heavily disguised as a lady's servant: his yellow hair hidden beneath a black wig and his eyebrows corked to match. Taking refuge at his father's house, he remained hidden in Edinburgh until October 1746, when, having assumed the dress and manner of a poor schoolteacher, he made the acquaintance of a king's messenger and with &#145;happy audacity&#146; journeyed to London under his protection  (H. W. Lumsden, 106). In contrast to his later pursuit of a quiet scholarly life, at this point he seems to have delighted in his various disguises&#151;passing his old schoolmates by unnoticed in the streets of Edinburgh and slipping into Newgate gaol so that he might visit his friends who had been captured after the failure of the rising. For this latter escapade his father remarked that he truly deserved to be hanged for jeopardizing himself in such a rash and foolish manner. Taking a boat at Tower stairs, he finally made his escape to the continent and journeyed to Paris via Rouen.<br>
<br>From his place of exile Lumisden maintained a lively correspondence with his family, written in various sorts of sympathetic ink, including milk and water, in order to preserve its secrecy. However, both the novelty of life in a foreign land and his early optimism about his prospects soon evaporated under the grim realities of poverty and unemployment. His application for a commission in Lochiel's regiment was submitted late, and his fluent command of the French language did not, as he had hoped, ensure him a place in a prominent mercantile company. His father's unwillingness to provide credit for his private trading schemes spelt the end of his dreams of financial independence, and he turned instead to the exiled Jacobite court as his primary means of subsistence. Unable to afford the rent in Paris he returned to Rouen, but on the strength of favourable references provided by the officials of the Scots College he secured an annual pension of 600 livres in June 1749. Before the end of that year he had travelled to Rome in the hope of securing employment in the service of the Old Pretender, but had to wait another year to acquire the post of his assistant secretary, working under the direction of James Edgar. On assuming his duties he began to keep scrupulous notes of his correspondence, and his letter-books for the period 1751&#150;73 provide a vital source for reconstructing the diplomatic and social life of the exiled court during those years.<br>
<br>Lumisden distinguished himself as a competent and dutiful servant, concerned above all with the promotion of a noble and seemly image for the leadership of the Jacobite movement. In the winter of 1758&#150;9 he was dispatched on a secret mission through France and the Italian states to drum up support for a projected French raid upon the coast of England. In Paris he attempted to heal the rift between the Old Pretender and his son, and to urge Charles Edward to reconcile himself to the French crown. After the death of Edgar in September 1764 he became the secretary of state to the Jacobite court. In this capacity he served the Old Pretender faithfully until the latter's death in January 1766 and officiated at his funeral, discharging his last duty to his master by placing three seals in his coffin and seeing that it was closed up.<br>
<br>Though Lumisden was there to greet Charles Edward upon his entry into Rome on 23 January 1766, and had been quick to congratulate him on his accession to the &#145;throne&#146;, he enjoyed none of the rapport that he had had with his late father. The hero worship which had characterized his accounts of the prince's role in the battles of the 'Forty-Five had rapidly dissipated during his years of exile, and his letters of the 1750s and 1760s speak all too often of a thinly veiled contempt for his new royal master. In particular he strongly disapproved of the prince's drinking and womanizing, and he joined forces with Cardinal Henry Stuart and John Waters, the Parisian banker and factor for the exiled court, to exert pressure on Clementine Walkinshaw to sign a declaration, dated 9 March 1767, that she had never been married to the Young Pretender. It seems likely that Lumisden had threatened her with the severance of her pension if she did not comply with their demands.<br>
<br>In this light, Lumisden's dismissal by the Young Pretender on 8 December 1768 did not come as a surprise, but formed part of a dramatic incident none the less. After an evening witnessing the prince's heavy drinking at the dining table, a quarrel arose as Lumisden and his friends refused to accompany their master to an oratorio on the grounds that he was too hopelessly drunk to appear in public. Undaunted, Charles Edward staggered out to his coach commanding that they follow him, but when they refused he dismissed them all on the spot. Within two days the prince had thought better of his rash decision and commanded Lumisden to return to his duties. However, on the advice of Cardinal Henry Stuart, Lumisden had resolved to quit his service as secretary of state. He had long complained of Rome's hot climate and mosquitoes, and been shunned by many of the local &eacute;lites on the grounds of his staunch protestantism.<br>
<br>From 1769 to 1773 Lumisden resided in Paris and was visited by many British tourists and gentlemen on the grand tour. From 1772 he discontinued his practice of writing an annual letter to the Stuart princes and increasingly distanced himself from their cause. This did much to hasten the raising and acceptance of a petition to allow him to revisit his native land (dated 15 February 1773), which was signed by forty-five of the most distinguished men in Edinburgh society, including David Hume and eight members of the judiciary. Lumisden arrived back in Edinburgh in June and chose to divide his time between Scotland, Paris, and Bath. While in Paris he put himself at great pains to buy up a collection of rare books for George, prince of Wales, which greatly helped to secure him a full pardon from the British government in 1778.<br>
<br>A member of the royal and antiquaries' societies of Edinburgh, Lumisden corresponded with Joseph Banks, James Boswell, Adam Smith, and David Hume. In 1797 he published his <span class="italic">Remarks on the Antiquities of Rome and its Environs</span>, the product of almost forty years of intermittent research, which contained a thorough description of those classical remains still extant in the city, as well as copious engraved illustrations. The book was well received and ran to a second edition in 1812. His last years were spent in Edinburgh, sharing apartments with another elderly bachelor, John McGowan, first in Luckenbooths&#151;which had gained a reputation for its literary salons&#151;and then in the more fashionable new developments of Princes Street. Lumisden was renowned as a popular and sociable figure in Edinburgh society, much in demand as a dinner guest. On Christmas night 1801 he went to bed in good health, but was seized by a sudden fit of apoplexy at some point in the early hours of the morning and was found dead upon the floor the following day. Writing in 1855, James Dennistoun mentioned that his copious anecdotes and stories were still fondly remembered by those that knew him  (Dennistoun, 2.274). Distinguished for his contemporaries by his singularly old-fashioned, <i>ancien r&eacute;gime</i> manners and &#145;natural mildness of disposition&#146;  (<span class="italic">Scots Magazine</span>, 182), Lumisden, it should not be forgotten, was also committed to the absolute necessity of divine-right monarchy, with an almost total distrust of democratic institutions, and manifested a fierce and brutal antisemitism in many of his writings (Dennistoun, 1.174; A. Lumisden, <span class="italic">Remarks on the Antiquities of Rome</span>, 299).<br>
