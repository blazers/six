<span class="headword">Ellenshaw,  Peter</span>  (1913&#150;2007), <span class="occ">special effects artist and landscape painter</span>, was born William Samuel Cook Ellenshaw at 76 Chatham Road, Battersea, London, on 24 May 1913, the son of Adeline Eyles. His mother was named on his birth certificate as Alice Ellenshaw, formerly Eyles, and his father as William Ellenshaw, engine driver at a laundry. The origin of the name Ellenshaw was unknown to him and he always understood that his father was James S. Alcock (<i>d</i>. 1921), an Irishman whose family came from Enniscorthy, co. Wexford, who had once owned a silver mine in Rico, Colorado, but now operated a laundry in the Wandsworth area. Although the names William Samuel appeared on official documents well into his adult life, he was known as Peter from childhood. He had two older sisters (registered as Eyles), Dorothy and Lulu, with whom he was evacuated during the First World War to Vange, Essex. At one point he briefly attended a preparatory school in Deal, Kent. He acquired a younger half-sister, Irene, after his mother married Edward James Hook, a gardener, in 1920. Sent to school in Chipstead, Surrey, he left at the age of fourteen and worked as a garage mechanic.<br>
<br>A talented, self-taught amateur artist, Ellenshaw spent his evenings making copies of paintings by the old masters that earned the encouragement of the Royal Academician Walter Percy (&#145;Pop&#146;) Day (1878&#150;1965), a pioneering special effects artist at Alexander Korda's London Films. Day specialized in creating hand-painted mattes: paintings on large sheets of glass which, suspended in front of the camera, or double exposed, created the illusion of scenery, thus obviating the need for elaborate sets or location filming. Day became Ellenshaw's mentor and, in the early 1930s, engaged him as his apprentice; Ellenshaw gave uncredited assistance with the creation of mattes for films including <span class="italic">The Scarlet Pimpernel</span> (1934), <span class="italic">Things to Come</span> (1936), <span class="italic">Fire over England</span> (1937), <span class="italic">The Four Feathers</span> (1939), and <span class="italic">The Thief of Baghdad</span> (1940). The closeness of Ellenshaw's relationship with his employer led to his introducing his mother, Adeline, to the widowed Day. She left James Hook and moved in with him, initially as his &#145;cook&#146;, although she subsequently adopted his surname, and in 1953 they married.<br>
<br>Ellenshaw joined the Civil Air Guard in 1938, and served as a fighter pilot in the RAF during the Second World War. In 1941 he was posted to Albany, Georgia, USA, for training. There he met Bobbie Palmer (<i>d</i>. 2000), a nurse at the Lawson General Hospital. They married in 1942 and had a son, Peter (known as Harrison), and a daughter, Lynda. On demobilization he returned to work with Day, most notably on three films produced and directed by Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger, <span class="italic">A Matter of Life and Death</span> (1946, chosen for Britain's first charity royal film performance), <span class="italic">Black Narcissus</span> (1947), and <span class="italic">The Red Shoes</span> (1948).<br>
<br>Ellenshaw's long association with Walt Disney began in 1947, when he undertook the matte paintings for the producer's first live-action film, <span class="italic">Treasure Island</span> (1950), filmed in England. The tutelage of Day paid off and Ellenshaw created highly convincing shots of Bristol harbour crowded with three-masted schooners as well as giving the English locations the appearance of an exotic Caribbean island. In an era before computer-created effects the work of the matte artist was indispensable and Ellenshaw's ability to render paintings with a photographic realism resulted in his becoming rapidly established as a master of the craft.<br>
<br>The success of Ellenshaw's work on <span class="italic">Treasure Island</span> led to his painting a vista of ancient Rome for Mervyn LeRoy's MGM epic <span class="italic">Quo vadis?</span> (1951) and two more projects for Disney that involved a year's work painting fifty-two and sixty-two matte paintings respectively for <span class="italic">The Story of Robin Hood and his Merrie Men</span> (1952) and <span class="italic">The Sword and the Rose</span> (1953). The skill with which he discharged this huge undertaking resulted in his moving to California in 1953 to enter into an exclusive contract with Walt Disney Productions, although this did not prevent his taking on occasional uncredited jobs for other studios, including more scenes of ancient Rome, this time for Stanley Kubrick's <span class="italic">Spartacus</span> (1960).<br>
<br>Between 1953 and 1979 Ellenshaw painted the mattes for every live-action film Disney produced (some thirty-four in total) as well as contributing to the concept art and special effects for many films and, on some titles, acting as production designer. Significant work included the underwater sequences in <span class="italic">20,000 Leagues under the Sea</span> (1954), which were shot in the demanding format of Cinemascope; the astonishing sequences set in the underground leprechaun kingdom in <span class="italic">Darby O'Gill and the Little People</span> (1959); and the vertigo-inducing alpine landscapes of <span class="italic">Third Man on the Mountain</span> (1959). Among other notable films to which he contributed were <span class="italic">Swiss Family Robinson</span> (1960), <span class="italic">Kidnapped</span> (1960), <span class="italic">In Search of the Castaways</span> (1962), and <span class="italic">Summer Magic</span> (1963). Between films he worked on Disney's television shows, including <span class="italic">Davy Crockett</span> (1955), <span class="italic">Zorro</span> (1957&#150;60), and <span class="italic">Walt Disney's Wonderful World of Color</span> (1955&#150;65). He also painted one of the first aerial maps of Disneyland, featured on early guidebooks and postcards, as well as contributing to the design of several attractions at the theme park.<br>
<br>Ellenshaw won an Academy award (or Oscar) for best visual effects for his work on <span class="italic">Mary Poppins</span> (1964), which memorably featured the title character's flight across the skyline of Edwardian London, the &#145;feed the birds&#146; sequence set around St Paul's Cathedral, and the rooftop antics of the chimneysweeps, whose dance number, &#145;Step in Time&#146;, was inspired by his recounted memories of the London pub dance &#145;Knees Up, Mother Brown&#146;. He was Oscar-nominated three more times, for <span class="italic">Bedknobs and Broomsticks</span> (1971), on which he served as art director, and for <span class="italic">The Island at the Top of the World</span> (1974) and <span class="italic">The Black Hole</span> (1979), on both of which he acted as production designer.<br>
<br>Throughout his career Ellenshaw painted powerful landscapes and seascapes, notably of the south-west coast of Ireland (where he kept a holiday home), the Mojave Desert, the American Pacific coastline, and the Himalayas. After his official retirement in 1979 he devoted more time to his paintings, which fetched high prices at leading New York galleries, although, with a defensiveness born out of his lack of formal art training, he disarmingly confessed that &#145;sophisticates think they're corny&#146;  (<span class="italic">New York Sun</span>, 15 Feb 2007). He came out of retirement to work with his son, providing mattes for <span class="italic">Superman IV: the Quest for Peace</span> (1987) and Disney's <span class="italic">Dick Tracy</span> (1990). He also contributed somewhat over-prettified paintings of scenes from Disney animated films, which became a line of best-selling lithographs for the Disney studio's merchandising arm. Designated a &#145;Disney legend&#146; in 1993, Ellenshaw was a man of huge charm who concealed a considerable ego beneath a cloak of self-effacing modesty. He died at his home in Santa Barbara, California, on 12 February 2007 and was survived by his two children, both of whom had followed him into the film industry, Harrison as an Oscar-nominated visual effects artist and Lynda as a visual effects producer.<br>
