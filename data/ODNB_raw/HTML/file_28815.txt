</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Waterland,  Daniel</span>  (1683&#150;1740), <span class="occ">theologian</span>, second son of Henry Waterland, rector of Walesby and Flixborough, Lincolnshire, and his second wife, was born at Walesby on 14 February 1683. He was educated at the free school in Lincoln and at Magdalene College, Cambridge, where he was admitted on 30 March 1699, elected scholar on 26 December 1702, and fellow on 13 February 1704. He graduated BA in 1703 and BD in 1714, and proceeded MA in 1706 and DD in 1717. On 8 May 1724 he was incorporated DD at Oxford University. He married in 1719 Theodosia (<i>d</i>. 1761), daughter of John Tregonwell of Anderton, Dorset.<h2>
<a name="CambridgeandtheAriancontroversy"></a>Cambridge and the Arian controversy</h2>A dedicated teacher and an able administrator, Waterland devoted his considerable energies to his college and his university. In February 1714 he was appointed master of Magdalene by the visitor, Lord Suffolk and Bindon, whose son he had tutored as an undergraduate, succeeding another Lincolnshire man, Gabriel Quadring, in the office; he was also presented to the living of Ellingham, Norfolk. He was a vigorous and very successful master of Magdalene, the college of his father and grandfather. This family connection was strengthened when he brought in his brother Theodore from Clare College as, successively, a foundation fellow, dean, and, by 1718, president of the college. On 14 November 1715 Waterland succeeded Thomas Sherlock as vice-chancellor of the university. On 7 June 1716 he preached a sermon on the occasion of the university's public thanksgiving for the suppression of the Jacobite rising, and on 22 October he presented to the prince of Wales, at Hampton Court, a congratulatory address that he had devised with Richard Bentley, the master of Trinity College; this entailed the beginning of an enmity with the not inconsiderable Jacobite elements in Cambridge. In 1717 Waterland became a chaplain-in-ordinary to the king; he received no further promotion at Cambridge and was especially disappointed never to have been offered either the Lady Margaret or the regius chair in divinity.<br>
<br>Waterland and Bentley were the leading moderate whigs in early Hanoverian Cambridge and their acceptance of Bishop Moore's library, from George I, was symbolic of the good relations they successfully sought to have with whig politicians. Waterland was responsible for the arrangements in accepting and organizing this considerable gift of books. His relationship with Bentley cooled somewhat as a result of his involvement in the censure passed by heads of houses, in January 1721, on Bentley's libel on John Colbatch (1664&#150;1748); Bentley had attacked Colbatch, a professorial fellow of Trinity, for writing a tract (in fact the work of Conyers Middleton) which was critical of Bentley's conduct during the 1717 ceremony for the presentation of DDs, at which Waterland had received his own degree. Waterland was a member of the syndicate appointed on 26 September 1723 to take such steps as might be advisable for the purpose of defeating or delaying Bentley's restoration to office in the university, which they eventually granted him in March 1724.<br>
<br>It was widely felt that Waterland studied too hard at great long-term cost to his health. He drew up a detailed programme of reading for undergraduates in the 1710s, which he first published as <span class="italic">Advice to a Young Student</span> in 1730; it reached a third edition in 1760. In this work he recommended much of the new learning, especially the mathematical works of Newton and his expositors; he also recommended a reading of Locke's <span class="italic">Essay</span>, though he alerted his readers to what he considered to be dangerous elements in that work. He advised that strictly theological study be left until after intensive study of the classics and philosophy for the BA degree. It was, however, in the study of theology that he was to make his own mark. He quickly took up the orthodox cause in the engagement over the doctrine of the Trinity, which began in earnest when Arianism began to be promoted by Samuel Clarke and his Cambridge followers. At the public commencement at Cambridge in 1714 Waterland held a much admired disputation with Sherlock on the question of Arian subscription to the <span class="roman">Thirty-Nine Articles</span>, which was then being discussed as a result of the Arian tendency of Clarke's controversial <span class="italic">Scripture Doctrine of the Trinity</span> (1712). John Jackson (1686&#150;1763), an Arian-inclined disciple of Clarke, subsequently published the correspondence that he had had with Waterland on the matter, without Waterland's permission, leading Waterland to respond with a public attack on the Arianism of Clarke and of Daniel Whitby (an influential clerical critic of the doctrine of the Trinity) in a learned tract, <span class="italic">A Vindication of Christ's Divinity</span> (1719). In the course of this work Waterland attacked Clarke's motivation in pleading, as a human infirmity, the right of Arians to subscribe to Trinitarian formulas in the <span class="roman">Thirty-Nine Articles</span>; to Waterland this was pure dishonesty, an argument which he reaffirmed when he replied, in an <span class="italic">Answer</span> (1720), to Whitby's critique of the <span class="italic">Vindication</span>. In his own reply, <span class="italic">The Modest Plea, &amp;c. Continued</span> (1720), Clarke indicted Waterland for relying on the testimony of the church fathers and tradition in making the Trinitarian case, stating that he himself preferred to argue about points of doctrine on purely scriptural grounds. The appeal to the fathers (principally as interpreters of scripture) to church history and to modern philosophy had become marked features of Waterland's style of thought very early in his publishing career, and in this he revealed his moderate high-churchmanship and his own preference for the considered results of theological learning over direct and simple appeal to scripture. He once again strongly condemned Clarke-inspired attempts at opening up the meaning of the articles away from orthodox interpretation, which he defined as the sense which the church intended, in a stinging rebuke, <span class="italic">The Case of Arian Subscription Consider'd</span> (1721). He continued on the orthodox offensive with the publication of <span class="italic">The Scriptures and the Arians, Compared in their Accounts of God the Father and God the Son</span> (1722), which tried to meet Clarke on his home ground of scriptural authority, and in two further supplemental works which also contained replies to his other critics, <span class="italic">A Second Vindication of Christ's Divinity</span> (1723) and <span class="italic">A Farther Vindication of Christ's Divinity</span> (1724). He had returned to the fray over subscriptions in <span class="italic">A Supplement to the Case of Arian Subscription Considered</span> (1722), in which he developed his strongly Arminian reading of the articles. His firmly liturgical sense of the Anglican tradition informed his final major engagement with Clarke's Arianism, <span class="italic">Remarks upon Dr. Clarke's Exposition of the Church Catechism</span> (1730). Waterland similarly replied to Arianizing tendencies among dissenters in <span class="italic">An Answer to some Queries Printed at Exon</span> (1721). He reaffirmed the importance of antiquity as a means of defending the orthodox doctrine of the Trinity in his last major work on the subject, <span class="italic">The Importance of the Doctrine of the Holy Trinity Asserted</span> (1734).<h2>
<a name="Indefenceofreligiousorthodoxy"></a>In defence of religious orthodoxy</h2>Waterland's learning and acumen impressed Bishop Robinson of London, who consequently appointed him as the first lecturer on the Lady Moyer foundation (1719&#150;20). The sermons that he preached on the foundation at St Paul's Cathedral restated, in a more polemical tone, his anti-Arian argument that the authority of antiquity and scripture vindicated the orthodox interpretation of Christ's divine nature. They were published as <span class="italic">Eight Sermons in Defence of the Divinity of our Lord Jesus Christ</span> (1720) and enjoyed a wide circulation; they were the most immediately influential of his works. Following the success of his Lady Moyer lectures Waterland was presented by the dean and chapter of St Paul's to the London rectory of St Augustine with St Faith. On 21 December 1722 he was appointed chancellor of the archdiocese of York by Archbishop Dawes. He was made a canon of Windsor on 27 September 1727 and he became archdeacon of Middlesex on 13 August 1730; he was also presented to the vicarage of Twickenham in October 1730, whereupon he resigned his London rectory. In 1723 he published another major defence of theological orthodoxy, his <span class="italic">Critical History of the Athanasian Creed</span>. This acted as a farther bulwark against Clarke's Arianism since the creed contained the most explicit formulation of the orthodox doctrine of the Trinity. In an exhaustive review of the evidence Waterland assigned composition of the Athanasian creed to the years 426&#150;30 and attributed its authorship to St Hilary of Arles. He justified writing such a learned work in English by pointing to the obvious need to obviate the potentially dangerous effects of heterodox argument on this matter. Its importance was immediately recognized and a second edition was issued in 1728. He also actively engaged in the controversy about deism, producing <span class="italic">Scripture Vindicated</span> (1730&#150;32), a reply to Matthew Tindal's <span class="italic">Christianity as Old as the Creation</span>, in three parts. This developed his method of interpreting the scriptures, which demonstrated that since their teaching was often parabolic and mystical in form then they could not be easily and simplistically condemned in the manner promoted by Tindal. Scripture was also, Waterland argued, a vital record of historical truth. He denied that natural religion was enough for humanity by emphasizing how only revealed religion contained the essential doctrines of the reward of eternal life and the status of Christ as mediator. A more sophisticated critique of Waterland's reading of scripture, a <span class="italic">Letter to Dr. Waterland Containing some Remarks on his Vindication of Scripture</span>, appeared in 1731. This was the work of Conyers Middleton, who had begun to enjoy something of a rivalrous relationship with Waterland at Cambridge. Middleton urged that many of the stories of the <span class="roman">Old Testament</span> could only make sense to rational people if they were understood allegorically, thus compromising Waterland's emphasis on other, more direct modes of exegesis; Waterland's vexed response to this work can be seen in his heavily annotated copy of the text, which is now in the Bodleian Library (8<sup>o</sup> Rawlinson, 437). These exchanges led, in the early 1730s, to something of a pamphlet war concerning deism. Waterland also rather conventionally attacked deism, as a morally corrupting system of ideas, in a charge to the archdeaconry of Middlesex, which he published in 1732 as <span class="italic">Christianity Vindicated Against Infidelity</span>.<br>
<br>Waterland's continuing efforts at countering the influence of Clarke's metaphysics on religious orthodoxy led him to contribute <span class="italic">A Dissertation on the Argument a priori for Proving the Existence of a First Cause</span> as an anonymous appendix, &#145;the work of a learned hand&#146;, to Edmund Law's <span class="italic">Enquiry into the Ideas of Space, Time, Immensity, and Eternity</span> (1734). In this largely historical as well as philosophical work Waterland objected to Clarke's use of the ontological argument; he was supported in this endeavour not only by Law but also by Joseph Clarke, a young fellow of Magdalene, who would later edit Waterland's sermons for the press. This was a major element of a significant rearguard action against Clarke's version of Newton's physico-theology that occurred in Cambridge, hitherto the centre of such reasoning, in the 1720s and 1730s. Some of Waterland's correspondence in the British Library reveals his deep suspicion of Newton's Arianism, the influence of which at Cambridge he saw it as his duty to counteract (BL, Add. MS 5831, fols. 172&#150;3, 173&#150;5; BL, Add. MS 6396, fol. 14). Law dedicated his translation of Archbishop King's <span class="italic">The Origin of Evil</span> (1731) to Waterland, who had acted as his patron at the outset of his career.<br>
<br>Waterland also contributed to the debate on the eucharist that had been inaugurated by Bishop Hoadly's <span class="italic">Plain Account of the Nature and End of the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper</span> (1735) by producing a very detailed and scholarly <span class="italic">Review of the Doctrine of the Eucharist as Laid Down in Scripture and Antiquity</span> (1737). This work retained its status as a vigorous statement of Anglican doctrine until well into the nineteenth century. Waterland maintained that the sacraments were a major support of central elements of Christian teaching, not least because they emphasized Christ's divine nature. The eucharist was explained as a material and spiritual symbol of Christ's sacrifice; it could not then be merely the service of commemoration which the low-church Hoadly insisted it was. In the plethora of writings on the subject produced at this time Waterland's words were to prove the most influential. In making his argument he once again appealed to patristic authority and to the testimony of antiquity and tradition. He had been concerned with such matters some time before Hoadly went into print on the matter, having already produced a work entitled <span class="italic">The Nature, Obligation, and Efficacy of the Christian Sacraments Considered</span> in 1730. In common with so many of his fellow churchmen Waterland was also a critic of enthusiasm, as can be seen in his tract on the rite of baptism, <span class="italic">Regeneration Stated and Explained According to Scripture and Antiquity</span> (1740), which denounced the Methodists and the doctrine of the new birth. For Waterland baptism was a once-only event, the beginning of the Christian life, and any subsequent renewal was simply the maturing of that life, not some new salvific event. Regeneration was not, then, a distinct new birth but a continuing process of spiritual maturation. These considerations were extended in a posthumously published study, <span class="italic">An Inquiry Concerning the Antiquity and Practice of Infant Communion</span>, which discussed the history and doctrine that informed the proper time for the incorporation of young people into the church. The attack on Whitefield and Wesley was also continued in another posthumously published tract, <span class="italic">A Summary View of the Doctrine of Justification</span> (1742). Waterland was afraid that Methodist faith in justification would prove a stimulus to antinomianism and he wanted to emphasize the centrality of a moral life which is implied in the orthodox view of justification as the incorporation of the individual believer within the church. Waterland denounced any belief in the primacy of salvation by faith alone; he stressed instead the need for good works and a strenuous moral life in achieving salvation.<h2>
<a name="Lateryearsandreputation"></a>Later years, and reputation</h2>Although popular with his fellow clergy as a succinct defender of theological orthodoxy Waterland declined the office of prolocutor in the lower house of convocation in 1734; he also refused the see of Llandaff in 1738 and in 1740. Indeed his beliefs were closer to those of the lower clergy than they were to those of the latitudinarians, who tended to enjoy higher preferments in the church, which led his friend the antiquary William Cole to claim that &#145;Dr Waterland was long talked of for a Bishopric &hellip; tho' his <i>Church notions</i> did not exactly square with the fashionable Opinions&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 5831, fol. 171). He was a deeply and unusually learned man and his researches encompassed a wide area of theological and historical enquiry. In common with a number of his clerical contemporaries he was a scholar of Old English; he also corresponded with the clerical historian John Lewis on the subject of Reginald Pecock, the controversial fifteenth-century theologian. Waterland died on 23 December 1740 and was buried in the south transept of St George's Chapel, Windsor. A fine funeral sermon was preached for him by his Middlesex colleague Jeremiah Seed, a fellow of the Queen's College, Oxford. His <span class="italic">Sermons</span> were published posthumously under the editorship of Joseph Clarke in 1742.<br>
<br>Waterland was one of the most able and influential theologians in the eighteenth-century Church of England. A firm opponent of the Arianism that had grown up in Cambridge as a legacy of Newton's and of Clarke's theologies, he helped to keep theological heterodoxy at bay in the first half of the eighteenth century. An able controversialist, he was suspicious of both mysticism and metaphysics, looking instead to history and external evidence, often of a textual kind, in making the orthodox case. He belonged to the Anglican patristic tradition championed by George Bull, to whom he became a natural successor in the theological debates of the first half of the eighteenth century. His theology remained influential into the early nineteenth century and he was championed both by Samuel Taylor Coleridge, who thought it the duty of all Anglican clergy to make themselves familiar with Waterland's writings, and by William van Mildert, who produced a major edition of Waterland's works, in ten volumes, at the Clarendon Press in 1823. Mark Pattison, in his important essay &#145;Tendencies of religious thought in England, 1688&#150;1750&#146;, first published in <span class="italic">Essays and Reviews</span> in 1860, noted the continued importance of Waterland for high-church thinking and saw in him the one figure in the eighteenth-century church to whom appeal could be made by &#145;the genuine Anglican&#146;, who, in &#145;constructing his <span class="italic">Catena patrum</span> &hellip; closes his list with Waterland or Brett, and leaps at once to 1833, when the <span class="italic">Tracts for the Times</span> commenced&#151;as Charles II dated his reign from his father's death&#146;  (M. Pattison, <span class="italic">Essays</span>, ed. H. Nettleship, 1889, 2.49). He was one of the most learned divines of his age and he used his considered erudition against such equally learned, but considerably less orthodox, Cambridge contemporaries as Clarke, Whitby, Whiston, and Middleton, as well as against deists such as Tindal, low-churchmen such as Hoadly, and Methodists such as Whitefield and Wesley. As a controversialist Waterland took on an unusually varied group of often extremely talented adversaries in engagements in which he invariably came out rather well. His writings are absolutely central to any appreciation of the religious life of eighteenth-century England, and they mark a degree of continuity in Anglican thinking from the close of the seventeenth century, in the tradition championed by George Bull, to the high-church revival that followed in the wake of the Oxford Movement.<br>
<br>The last volume of van Mildert's edition of the <span class="italic">Works</span> is largely taken up with letters, to which may be added <span class="italic">Fourteen Letters to Zachary Pearce</span> (ed. E. Churton, 1868), which covers a range of theological matters, and <span class="italic">Five Letters to William Staunton</span>, appended to Staunton's <span class="italic">Reason and Revelation Stated</span> (1722). There are also important letters in the British Library and the Bodleian Library.<br>
