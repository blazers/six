<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Wilson,  Henry Joseph</span>  (1833&#150;1914), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born at Old Radford, Nottinghamshire, on 14 April 1833, the son of William Wilson (1800&#150;1866), a Nottingham cotton spinner, and his second wife, Eliza, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Read, (1803&#150;1851), whose family had managed the Sheffield smelting works since its inception in 1760; William Wilson became a partner in the company after his marriage. The missionary <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/100955/', "Sarah Poulton Kalley")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/49010/', "Kalley, Robert Reid")</script>] was his elder half-sister. Living in Torquay in his adolescence, Wilson was educated by a private tutor, then at the West of England Dissenters' Proprietary School at Taunton (1848&#150;50), and at University College, London (1850&#150;51). His university education was terminated prematurely by family illness, and he was apprenticed as a farmer at the 1000 acre Newlands farm near Mansfield, leased by his father in 1853. On 23 November 1859 he married Charlotte (1833&#150;1921), daughter of Charles Cowan, a paper manufacturer and Liberal MP for Edinburgh. Their children included: Katie (1861&#150;1868), Cecil (1862&#150;1945), <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/57832/', "Helen Mary Wilson (1864&#150;1951)")</script>, Oliver (1866&#150;1955), and Gertrude (<i>b</i>. 1876). Wilson's family had been committed Congregationalists, but the strong nonconformist sensibility he retained was impatient of dogma, and he regularly attended Quaker meetings in later life.<br>
<br>The farm at Newlands brought little profit despite arduous and unremitting labour. Nevertheless, here Wilson marked out the causes which brought them a life lived constantly under the pressure of agitation. His championing of &#145;teetotal farming&#146; presaged a life of temperance activism: he later served as vice-president and then president of the British Temperance League. His organization of the Mansfield Mechanics' Institute illustrated his recognition of the need for wholesome alternatives to the public house. His service as the first president of the Mansfield Co-operative Society likewise reflected his deep-seated commitment to self-improvement, while his support for anti-slavery campaigns and the North in the American Civil War foreshadowed his lifelong struggles against female slavery and the state regulation of vice.<br>
<br>After his father's death in 1866 Wilson gave up the farm to join his brother at the Sheffield Smelting Company. He quickly became its dominant force, and encouraged diversification into standard silver, which considerably augmented profitability and financed a generous company paternalism. As soon as he had mastered the smelting business Wilson threw himself into politics, championing ultra-progressive Liberalism in opposition to the dominant whiggish Liberalism of the <span class="italic">Sheffield Independent</span> and the Sheffield Liberal Association. Although in 1875 he was appointed secretary of a united Sheffield Liberal Association, and in 1876 was elected to the Sheffield school board, Wilson remained almost perpetually at odds with moderate Liberalism, fighting a rearguard action after 1900 against a powerful local Liberal imperialism. It is one aspect of this, his long-running attempts to launch a radical paper for the city, which has most often brought Wilson to the attention of modern historians.<br>
<br>Nevertheless Wilson's contemporary significance lay more in his co-operation with Josephine Butler in the campaign against the <span class="roman">Contagious Diseases Act</span> than in his local activism. Joint secretary (with Butler) of the British, Continental and General Federation for the Abolition of Government Regulation of Prostitution, he toured in the USA in 1875, and was active from 1876 onwards in the International Abolitionist Federation. After the 1886 <span class="roman">Criminal Law Amendment Act</span> he played a prominent role in the National Vigilance Association. Wilson was a member of a committee of investigation into prostitution in India appointed in 1892, and a member of the royal commission on the opium traffic, for which he visited India in 1893&#150;4, eventually issuing a dissenting minute severely critical of the official sanctioning of the trade. He gave his own account of this activity in <span class="italic">Copy of a rough record of events and incidents connected with the repeal of the Contagious Diseases Acts</span> (1907).<br>
<br>Serving as MP for the Holmfirth division of Yorkshire, West Riding (1885&#150;1912), Wilson was a prominent Liberal internationalist and anti-imperialist. From 1886 to 1890 he made ten visits to Ireland, actively supporting Irish nationalism, and was at the forefront of the conciliation movement during the South African War. Wilson's radicalism was that of the Newcastle programme (adopted by the National Liberal Federation in 1891), in which individual rights loomed more prominently than social obligations; nevertheless, after 1900 he shifted steadily towards the support of a greater measure of social legislation: not only old age pensions, but also the <span class="roman">Eight Hours Bill</span> for miners, which he had opposed in the 1890s. He had always been a firm champion of Lib&#150;Labism; nevertheless, socialism and the rise of an organized Labour Party discomforted him. He retired from the Holmfirth seat in 1912.<br>
<br>When Wilson died, at his residence at Osgathorpe Hills, Sheffield, on 29 June 1914, his friends paid tribute to a persevering campaigner, perhaps brusque and inflexible, but to the last both family man and combative Christian, while his Conservative opponents remembered &#145;a man of war, full of fight to his fingertips &hellip; [an] untattoed political savage&#146;  (<span class="italic">Sheffield Daily Telegraph</span>). Wilson was cremated at City Road cemetery, Sheffield, on 3 July 1914.<br>
