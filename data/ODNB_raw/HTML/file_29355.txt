<span class="headword">Widdrington,  Ralph</span>  (1614/15&#150;1688), <span class="occ">scholar</span>, was born at Cheeseburn Grange, Stamfordham, Northumberland, the son of Lewis Widdrington (<i>d</i>. 1630) and his wife, Catherine, daughter and heir of William Lawson of Little Usworth, co. Durham. From Morpeth School on 25 June 1632 he was admitted to Christ's College, Cambridge, as pensioner and pupil of John Fenwick. There he graduated BA in 1636, proceeded MA in 1639, and was elected fellow, probably in 1639. He was admitted to Gray's Inn in March 1641 but was ordained and thenceforth tutored actively at Christ's, where his family connections brought him sons of north-country gentry. Fourteen of his younger relatives entered Christ's between 1649 and 1670.<br>
<br>Widdrington was one of three Christ's fellows not removed in March 1644, another being Henry More. Later he denied taking the covenant and claimed to have left college for almost two years, returning only through the influence of &#145;a relation or two&#146;&#151;presumably his elder brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29358/', "Sir Thomas Widdrington, MP")</script> and subsequently speaker  (Peile, <span class="italic">Register</span>, 1.421&#150;2). On 24 October 1650 he succeeded Henry Molle as university orator (a position he retained until 1673) and soon after took the engagement, as Samuel Dillingham informed Sancroft on 30 December. Cromwell named him Greek professor on 12 December 1654; Isaac Barrow, who &#145;had the consent of the University&#146;, had to wait for the professorship until Widdrington resigned at the Restoration  (J. Aubrey, <span class="italic">Brief Lives</span>, ed. A. Clark, 2 vols., 1898, 1.90). He attempted in 1659 to displace Ralph Cudworth as master of Christ's. Pepys heard on 21 February 1660 &#145;how he did oppose all the fellows in the college&#146;; a year later he had given up his pupils &#145;and was now quite out of interest&#146;  (Pepys, 1.63, 2.44). Charged with &#145;failure in trust&#146; and &#145;fraudulent dealing&#146;, he refused to co-operate and in April 1661 &#145;was removed from the college for contumacy and neglect of statutes&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1660&#150;61</i>, 574&#150;5).<br>
<br>However, Widdrington still had political influence and obtained a king's bench mandamus (20 June 1661), then reinstatement by a privy council committee. In 1665 he unsuccessfully made what Henry More called &#145;a long rabble of accusations&#146; against Cudworth, and &#145;collaterally&#146; against More himself  (<span class="italic">Conway Letters</span>, 243, 242). When a fellow was elected in 1667, and a proctor in 1676, Widdrington again sought outside intervention. Meanwhile his personal affairs prospered: he was created DD by royal mandate in 1661 and preferred to the rectories of Thorpe on the Hill, Lincolnshire (6 February 1661), Wendon Lofts, Essex (1666; resigned 1676), Terrington, Norfolk (1673), and Great Munden, Hertfordshire (17 December 1675). Already Lady Margaret preacher (since 1664), he was chosen professor of divinity on the king's recommendation of 30 December 1672.<br>
<br>Widdrington contributed verses to <span class="italic">Justa Edovardo King</span> (1638), <span class="italic">Luctus et gratulatio</span> (1658) on the funeral of Oliver and succession of Richard Cromwell, <span class="italic"><i>S&#333;stra</i></span> (1660) on the return of Charles II, and other university collections. He wrote a short treatise on the Lord's supper for the Cambridge edition of Thomas &agrave; Kempis's <span class="italic">De Christo imitando</span> (1688). His long correspondence with Sancroft suggests he was a difficult friend, in particular his letters of 25 November and 3 December 1672 which then reaffirm their friendship. He died in college on 10 June 1688, having made Christ's the beneficiary of his will, dated 19 March 1688, but only after three nephews were dead&#151;an inevitably contentious arrangement, which lost the college most of his substantial estate.<br>
