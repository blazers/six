<span class="headword">Champion family</span>  (<em>per. </em><em>c.</em>1670&#150;1794), <span class="occ">metal manufacturers and merchants</span>, came to prominence with <a name="cosubject_57867"></a><span class="headword">Nehemiah [ii] Champion</span>  (1649&#150;1722)<span class="occ"></span>, son of Nehemiah [i] Champion (<i>b</i>. 1614). As a merchant dealing countrywide in iron goods, and a Quaker from about 1670, Nehemiah [ii] became Bristol agent and largest customer of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7137/', "Abraham Darby (1678&#150;1717)")</script> of Coalbrookdale. He appears also to have represented Bristol interests in Newcomen's new atmospheric pump for mining. His sons included Nehemiah [iii] and Richard (1680&#150;1764). He died on 1 May 1722 at Bristol.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_49063"></a><span class="headword">Nehemiah [iii] Champion</span>  (1678&#150;1747)<span class="occ"></span> is known to have been married three times. His first wife was Susanna, daughter of John Trueman, a Bristol Quaker. Their five children included <a href="#cosubject_49064">John [i] (1705&#150;1794) [<i>see below</i>]</a> , Nehemiah [iv] (1709&#150;1782), <a href="#cosubject_49065">William (1710&#150;1789) [<i>see below</i>]</a>, and also Rachel (1712&#150;1766), who, in 1731, married Quaker iron smelter Sampson [ii] Lloyd (1699&#150;1779), it being his second marriage. Nehemiah [iii] made a second marriage, to Hannah Ball, and a third, in 1742, to Martha Vandewall, daughter of Quaker merchant William Goldney. Richard, younger brother of Nehemiah [iii], a merchant of Bisley, Gloucestershire, briefly partnered Abraham Darby in 1711, providing capital for expansion at the Coalbrookdale ironworks, later becoming a leading partner of the Bristol brassworks after the death of Nehemiah [iii].<br>
<br>From 1706 Nehemiah [iii] Champion was purchasing Cornish copper ores on behalf of brassworks established in 1702 by Abraham Darby and his Quaker partners at Bristol. This company was to achieve success in establishing brass production in England as a thriving industry, whereas those before had failed under domination from exports from traditional European centres of manufacture. After Darby left Bristol for Coalbrookdale, some time between 1708 and 1710, Champion replaced him as manager, later becoming a partner, with responsibility for developing new technical expertise, particularly in adopting coal instead of charcoal as the main source of fuel.<br>
<br>Champion's new techniques in brass production and manufacture, patented in 1723 (no. 454), increased the output of alloy from its raw materials, copper and the zinc ore calamine. Included also were new methods of annealing&#151;or heating&#151;brass goods during manufacture to prevent cracking. A further patent, no. 567 in 1739, concerned overshot water-wheels, possibly for use in conjunction with the Newcomen pumping engine. Champion's methods brought the Bristol brass company to predominance throughout Britain and, later in the century, throughout Europe. He died on 9 June 1747.<br>
<br>Of Nehemiah's sons, <a name="cosubject_49065"></a><span class="headword">William Champion</span>  (1710&#150;1789)<span class="occ"></span>, born on 26 April 1710, achieved greatest distinction, although he was often confused with his elder brother John [i]. William married Ann, daughter of George Bridges, on 18 June 1741. Travelling Europe as a young man, he became interested in producing zinc, which was only beginning to be understood and accepted as a metal rather than as a stone or earth which converted copper to brass. At that time its production was not possible on a large industrial scale in Europe. He returned home in 1730 and experimented for eight years until in 1738 he registered his patent (no. 564), which was obscurely worded for secrecy. The sound technical process he developed displayed a true understanding of problems previously encountered by others. To avoid the oxidization of zinc vapour at the high temperatures required for metal production, he built a large-scale distillation furnace, based on the Bristol glass cones and heated by coal. When the city fathers complained of the harmful &#145;smoke&#146; from his Bristol furnaces, he moved in 1746 to Warmley, 5 miles away. An 80-acre site had been purchased by his father, Nehemiah [iii], who, shortly before he died, joined his son and other Quaker merchants in a new Warmley partnership.<br>
<br>William Champion established a large integrated works at Warmley, where, in addition to exploiting his new zinc smelting process, he incorporated the smelting of copper, together with brass production and manufacture. The output consisted mainly of hollowware&#151;pots, pans, and vats&#151;and wire, similar to the output of the Bristol company. Under such direct competition, antagonism soon developed between the two companies, which increased as the Warmley site was developed to capacity.<br>
<br>The principle of completely integrated production on one site was new to the industry, contrasting strongly with the Bristol company, which operated several separate manufacturing watermills in addition to two copper smelting sites. The water-wheels powering the Warmley hammers, rolling mills, wire mills, and other manufacturing equipment were kept working by recycling water with a large Newcomen pumping engine. This was the first time such an engine had been used in manufacturing processes. Zinc production proved less profitable than had been anticipated, however, especially after the refusal of an extension of patent rights; nevertheless, William Champion continually expanded his premises, plant, and processes, adding brass pin manufacture. By 1765 his business was still expanding, although he was forced to borrow heavily, and personal losses occurred after the failure of his dock improvements in the port of Bristol. He registered patent no. 867 for manufacturing brass and brass wire in 1767, but was bankrupt by 1769, his Warmley company premises eventually being purchased by the Bristol brass company. William Champion died on 22 May 1789 at Somerset Street, Bristol.<br>
<br>William and Ann Champion's five children included John [ii] Champion, born in Bristol in 1746, who was manufacturing metals at Cheese Lane, Bristol, at the end of the century. He corresponded in the 1790s with Matthew Boulton (1728&#150;1809), through his Birmingham cousin Charles Lloyd, on the more efficient use of his rotative steam engine, with which he intended to operate a rolling mill for copper and lead in addition to producing iron and brass wire. He patented new methods of wire manufacture in 1798, but in the following year his premises were advertised for sale. He is known to have approached Lord Ribblesdale in 1806, in connection with purchasing calamine mined at Malham Moor for new zinc production in Yorkshire; but by 1810 at the age of sixty-four John [ii] Champion was declared a bankrupt.<br>
<br>William's elder brother <a name="cosubject_49064"></a><span class="headword">John [i] Champion</span>  (1705&#150;1794)<span class="occ"></span>, who was born on 22 June 1705, developed separate interests in metals. His patent (no. 569) of 1739 involved antimony and arsenic to toughen metals; and no. 726, of 1758, registered brass production and the smelting of zinc from its sulphide ore, known as blende, instead of from calamine, the zinc carbonate used previously. Although receiving his father's share in the Bristol brass company and being agent for the Warmley company, he took no major part in either, but established his own brassworks at Holywell, north Wales, near local resources of blende and calamine. His production there appears to have been of a quality more suited to cast products, in contrast to the greater degree of purity required for the rolled-sheet goods, beaten hollowware, and drawn wire typical of the traditional Bristol processes. He relinquished the Holywell works in 1765 when under financial pressure.<br>
<br>His son John [iii] Champion (1754&#150;1779), at the age of sixteen, was responsible for patent no. 950 (1770) for hatching eggs and rearing young domestic birds by artificial heat. He later worked on the extraction of sulphur during the roasting of copper sulphide ores, which his partner, William Roe of Macclesfield, patented in 1779, after John's early death at the age of twenty-five. During that same year his father was patenting another process for brass production in large sealed crucibles. Ten years later, aged eighty-four, John [i] Champion was writing to Matthew Boulton on coal gas, the &#145;inflammable matter for lighting&#146;  (Day, <span class="italic">Bristol Brass</span>, 120) he had produced, and which he thought suitable for lighthouse illumination. John [i] Champion died in Warwick Row, Pimlico, on 4 April 1794, aged eighty-eight.<br>
<br>Another member of the family, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5094/', "Richard Champion (1743&#150;1791)")</script>, grandson of Richard Champion (1680&#150;1764), became noted for collaboration with the Quaker <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6199/', "William Cookworthy (1705&#150;1780)")</script>, pioneer of hard-paste porcelain in England. Richard had shown interest in attempting to make porcelain before meeting Cookworthy in 1764, after Cookworthy's difficulty in establishing works in Cornwall. Successful manufacture was introduced to Bristol by the partners, with sole rights from Cookworthy's patent of 1768 being transferred to Champion by 1774. However, his petition to parliament, challenged by Josiah Wedgwood (1730&#150;1795) and others, failed to obtain an extension of patent rights, and Champion's Bristol works proved unable to withstand the ensuing competition from other manufacturers.<br>
<br>The widespread contribution of members of the Society of Friends to eighteenth-century metal industries is well recognized, and the Champions, centred in Bristol, were deeply involved in the Quaker life of the city. Nevertheless, some members of the family were at times disciplined for un-Quakerly activities: their bankruptcies were not approved; Nehemiah [iii] Champion was proscribed for privateering; and Richard Champion (1743&#150;1791) was admonished for irresponsible financial dealings. By marriage they were interrelated to many of the most prominent members of Quaker families, in the city and elsewhere, and in old age John [i] Champion particularly received support from the society.<br>
<br>The death of John [i] Champion in 1794 brought an end to the significant contributions of the Champion family to the technology of the eighteenth century. Their interests were widespread and of national significance, ranging from Cornish copper mining to manufacturing in Coalbrookdale, Swansea, Macclesfield, and Liverpool, but mainly concentrated on important developments in non-ferrous metal production.<br>
