<span class="headword">Cook,  Henry</span>  (1642?&#150;1700), <span class="occ">decorative painter</span>, has been described as the son of a portraitist of the same name employed by the Ironmongers' Company in 1640; it is impossible, however, to reconcile this with the accounts of the company, which record payments to an Edward Cocke, painter. According to Bernard Buckeridge, Henry Cook was well educated and accomplished; he may have attended Cambridge University. It is possible that he travelled to Italy to study painting and that he spent some time working in Salvator Rosa's studio, although accounts of this journey are confused.<br>
<br>Cook did not enjoy a great deal of success in the early stages of his career and seems to have lived in obscurity until he obtained an introduction to Sir Godfrey Copley from Edward Lutterell which led to his decorating the former's new house in Yorkshire for &pound;150. He subsequently spent five years living with the painter Theodore Russel (nephew of the artist Cornelius Johnson and pupil of Van Dyck); during this period he killed a man in a brawl over a woman&#151;whom he was eventually to marry&#151;and fled abroad, spending at least seven years in Italy until his crime was forgotten. He then went into partnership with a house painter in Knaves Acre, off Wardour Street, London.<br>
<br>Cook was employed by William III to reintegrate Raphael's cartoons (they had been cut up and kept as strips since being sent to the tapestry works at Mortlake). This took place about 1697, with the help of Parry Walton, the surveyor of paintings. The adhesion of the strips on to canvas and the restoration of the cartoons was devised in conjunction with Sir Christopher Wren's remodelling of the king's gallery at Hampton Court, which was designed to display the repaired works. Cook was also responsible for making at least one set of copies of the cartoons, using turpentine and distemper, a new technique which he pioneered. This set was presumably made for William III, who sent it to Holland. He also seems to have restored other paintings in the Royal Collection and to have made copies of them for the king.<br>
<br>Most of Cook's painting was on a large scale and of a decorative nature. He completed a wall-painting at Chelsea Hospital which had been begun by Antonio Verrio in 1687 (Verrio was paid &pound;210 15<i>s</i>. for the work in 1688), signing the work in the lower right-hand corner &#145;H. Cooke Pinxit&#146;. He was paid &pound;295 for the work about 1690. The central area of the painting contains a life-size equestrian portrait of Charles II attended by marine deities, with the hospital in the background. According to George Vertue, the painting was a gift from the earl of Ranelagh whose house in Chelsea Cook had decorated.<br>
<br>Cook's other decorative schemes included the ceiling of the board room of the New River Company in Islington, London, which survives. This oval compartment, which depicts William III supported by winged allegorical figures, was painted between 1688 and 1697. He also painted the east end of New College chapel, Oxford, with a <span class="italic">Salutation</span> within a false apse; this was destroyed in 1788.<br>
<br>Apart from being a restorer and decorative painter, Cook was also an easel painter, his picture of <span class="italic">A Listening Faun</span> having been commemorated in an epigram by John Elsum, while George Vertue records a picture of <span class="italic">Charity</span> with life-size figures. He amassed a significant collection of books, paintings, and drawings which were sold after his death. He died on 18 November 1700 at his house in Bloomsbury Square, London; he was buried on 22 November at St Giles-in-the-Fields. His executors were the portraitist John Closterman and the banker and goldsmith James Seamer. The latter owned his self-portrait &#145;in his own hair&#146; which was passed from George Vertue to Horace Walpole. It appeared in the Strawberry Hill sale of 18 May 1842, and was engraved by Bannerman for Walpole's <span class="italic">Anecdotes of Painting</span> (1862).<br>
