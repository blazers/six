<span class="headword">Lowe,  Edward</span>  (<em>c.</em>1610&#150;1682), <span class="occ">organist and composer</span>, was born in the parish of St Thomas's, Salisbury, probably into the family of John Lowe (<i>d</i>. 1632), lawyer, of Salisbury, and his second wife, Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1639?), daughter of Thomas Hyde, chancellor of Salisbury Cathedral from 1588 to 1618. Although there is no direct evidence that Edward Lowe was their son, he called a Humphrey Hyde &#145;cousin&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 29396). According to Anthony Wood, Lowe was &#145;bred a chorister&#146;  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Wood D.19 (4), fol. 87<i>v</i>) at Salisbury Cathedral under John Holmes, master of the choristers from about 1621 to 1629.<br>
<br>After Michaelmas 1631, but before 1641, Lowe succeeded William Stonard as organist and master of the choristers at Christ Church Cathedral, Oxford. On 14 December 1633 he married Alice (1607/8&#150;1649), daughter of Sir John Peyton of Doddington, Isle of Ely, at St James's, Clerkenwell, in London; they had nine children. Since Alice's coat of arms was depicted with Lowe's in a pane of painted glass in the house at Hampton Gay, near Shipton-on-Cherwell, Oxfordshire, which he occupied fifty years later, he may already have been living there during this period. Alice died on 17 March 1649, and Lowe probably married his second wife, Mary, about 1654.<br>
<br>During the interregnum Lowe gave private lessons and took part in weekly music meetings at the house of William Ellis, formerly organist of St John's College, Oxford. The vice-chancellor's accounts for 1657&#150;8 name him as university organist, and he acted as deputy to the professor of music appointed in 1656, John Wilson, whom he succeeded in 1661.<br>
<br>Soon after the Restoration Lowe became one of the three organists of the Chapel Royal (with William Child and Christopher Gibbons), a post he retained along with his Oxford appointments until his death, and he compiled <span class="italic">A short direction for the performance of cathedrall service, published for the information of such persons as are ignorant of it, and shall be call'd to officiate in cathedrall, or collegiate churches where it hath formerly been in use</span> (1661; rev. 1664), containing simple settings of the liturgy for newly reconstituted choirs. Lowe's enduring achievement, however, was in administration. As professor of music he fostered performance at the Thursday afternoon meetings of the music school and continued the development of the school's music collection  (Bodl. Oxf., MSS mus. sch.), an outstanding source of English music of the early and mid-seventeenth century. Despite his long service in Oxford, however, Lowe was not granted university privileges until 19 August 1667.<br>
<br>The music school's holdings at Lowe's death are outlined in a catalogue made in 1682 by his successor Richard Goodson  (Bodl. Oxf., MS mus. sch. C.204* [R]), which also lists &#145;The Gift of Mr Lowe late Professour&#146;. Manuscripts purchased for the music school during Lowe's professorship included the North family's collection of works by John Jenkins and other composers, bought for &pound;22 from &#145;Mr Wood&#146; (possibly but not certainly Anthony Wood) in 1667  (MSS mus. sch. C.81&#150;91, C.98&#150;101, and E.406&#150;9). Lowe's regular contact with court musicians was a great advantage: John Hingeston, formerly Cromwell's household musician, presented music of his own, encouraged by &#145;what I have heard &amp; seen of the care, dilligence and industry, of the present Professor of that faculty in the University, my Honored frind and fellow servant Mr Edward Lowe&#146;  (MSS mus. sch. D.205&#150;11), and four books in William Lawes's autograph  (MSS mus. sch. D.229 and 238&#150;40), together with mus. sch. B.2 and 3 in Lowe's private collection, were probably given by Henry Lawes, whose will Lowe witnessed in 1662. Other material was donated by Oxford musicians, commissioned from copyists or copied by Lowe himself, many manuscripts being annotated by Lowe with informative practical or historical details.<br>
<br>The professor's duties included the organization of music for the degree ceremony or &#145;act&#146; and for other official occasions. Lowe copied performing parts for several of the odes, known as act songs, performed at these events, among them two works of his own; one of these, <span class="italic">Nunc est canendum</span>, might have been composed for the opening of the Sheldonian Theatre on 9 July 1669; the other, <span class="italic">Eia eruditam</span>, was performed on 7 July 1671 and may have given rise to the unfounded assertion that he was not formally installed as music professor until that year. For Christ Church Lowe copied twenty-seven anthems, including several composed by himself, into the cathedral partbooks  (Mus. 1220&#150;24): a competent but minor composer, he also wrote a few songs and partsongs, and one keyboard piece is ascribed to him  (Christ Church, Mus. 1177). Further sources in Lowe's handwriting include a Christ Church organ accompaniment book  (Mus. 1002), a collection of voluntaries in Christ Church  (Mus. 1176), and a song anthology at Edinburgh University Library  (MS Dc.I.69) and its companion volume  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Mus.d.38).<br>
<br>Lowe was described by Anthony Wood as &#145;a proud man&#146; who &#145;could not endure any common Musitian to come to [Ellis's] Meeting, much less to play amongst them&#146;  (Clark, 1.205), but this observation may reflect Lowe's concern for the status and standards of his profession rather than personal vanity. In his will he described Richard Goodson, an Oxford innkeeper's son who succeeded him in his university appointments, as his friend, and his manuscripts suggest that he actively encouraged local composers, including at least one, Henry Bowman, with no official connection with the university.<br>
<br>Lowe died on 11 July 1682 and was buried near his first wife in the divinity chapel of the cathedral. Two children were living from that marriage: Edward (1635&#150;1711), who had become vicar of Brighton in 1674 and rector of Slinfold, Sussex, in 1681, and Elizabeth, who had married Thomas Burtchall of London, a comb maker and dissenter, at St James's, Duke's Place, in 1667. There were also at least two surviving children from his second marriage: Susanna, who married John Strype, the church historian, at Christ Church on 7 February 1682, and, almost certainly, Charles Lowe (<i>b</i>. 1654/5), of St Katharine Cree, London, who was aged twenty-three when on 28 August 1678 he obtained a faculty office licence to marry Mary Downes. Lowe's place in the Chapel Royal was granted to Henry Purcell; at Christ Church the next organist was probably William Husbands, then too young to collect his payment in person.<br>
