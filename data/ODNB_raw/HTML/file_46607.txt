<span class="headword">Batey,  John Thomas</span>  (1862&#150;1951), <span class="occ">shipbuilder</span>, was born in Newcastle upon Tyne on 28 July 1862, one of the eleven children of the tug boat operator Francis Batey (1842&#150;1915) and Margaret, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Nicholls (1842&#150;1912). Batey was educated at the Royal Grammar School, Newcastle, and in 1880 began an apprenticeship at Andrew Leslie's shipyard at Hebburn. In 1886 the shipyard amalgamated with the engine builders R. and W. Hawthorn to form R. and W. Hawthorn, Leslie &amp; Co. Ltd. While still an apprentice, Batey took evening classes and obtained a bronze medal in naval architecture and a first class honours degree, a rare qualification on Tyneside at that time. Later he lectured part-time in naval architecture at Rutherford College in Newcastle. Batey married Adelaide Frederick Sewell (1861&#150;1946). They had two daughters and two sons.<br>
<br>Batey became chief draughtsman at William Dobson's Low Walker shipyard in 1889 and remained there for twelve years. In 1901 he rejoined the Hebburn shipyard of Hawthorn Leslie as chief draughtsman, but soon became general manager under Herbert (later Sir Herbert) Rowell. In 1907 Batey became a director of the company. In this period Hawthorn Leslie had a series of Admiralty contracts to build torpedo boat destroyers, turning out more than thirty by 1914. Nevertheless, a number of merchant ships were also built, including several specialist iron-ore carriers. One of these, the <i>Sir Ernest Cassel</i> (10,800 deadweight tons) built in 1910, was the largest single-decked vessel engaged in ocean trade at that time. Rowell and Batey carried through a shipyard modernization programme shortly before the First World War, with capital investment including cranage and pneumatic tools.<br>
<br>During the First World War the yard built two light cruisers, twenty-one destroyers, and twelve merchant ships. In 1916 Rowell became company chairman and Batey took on increased responsibility for running the shipyard. On Rowell's death in 1921 Batey was appointed managing director. During the 1920s Hawthorn Leslie built several passenger liners, such as the <i>Andania</i> (14,000 gross tons) of 1922 for Cunard, a type of large merchant ship the management had long wanted to build. Close production control and bold sales policy led to the shipyard being more successful than many of its rivals in the depressed inter-war years. After a small loss in 1932&#150;3, increasing naval orders improved the yard's performance. Batey retired from the company in 1935.<br>
<br>In 1934 Batey had become president of the North East Coast Institution of Engineers and Shipbuilders, a body he had first joined in 1885, soon after its foundation. Similarly, after many years of membership, Batey became president of the Institution of Naval Architects in 1938. He was awarded an honorary DSc by Durham University in 1935 and in the following year he was honoured with presidency of the international conference of naval architects held in New York. An early supporter of standardization in shipbuilding and engineering, Batey served as a member of the British Engineering Standards Association, which later became the British Standards Institution. Batey was active in various employers' organizations, being chairman of the Tyne Shipbuilders Association for four years and later serving on the central board of the Shipbuilding Employers' Federation.<br>
<br>Early acquaintance with inadequate responses to accidents at work led Batey to take a keen interest in the St John Ambulance Brigade, an activity he pursued right up until his death. In recognition of his work he was made a knight grace of the venerable order of St John of Jerusalem. Batey was president of the Hebburn Nursing Association and chairman of the chest hospital in the west end of Newcastle. Batey died of cancer on 23 July 1951 at Egypt End, Farnham Common, Farnham Royal, Buckinghamshire.<br>
