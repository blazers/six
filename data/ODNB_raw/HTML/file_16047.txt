<span class="headword">Langton,  William</span>  (1803&#150;1881), <span class="occ">banker</span>, son of Thomas Langton (1770&#150;1838), a merchant who spent some years in Russia and Canada, and his wife, Ellen (1766&#150;1846), the daughter of the Revd William Currer, vicar of Clapham. He was born at Farfield, near Addingham, in the West Riding of Yorkshire, on 17 April 1803. He was educated mainly in Switzerland, and became fluent in several foreign languages, especially Italian. From 1821 to 1829 he was employed by the mercantile house of T. and W. Earle of Liverpool, latterly as agent for several Russian firms. In August 1829, after the Russo-Turkish War of 1827&#150;9, which had disrupted the Russian trade, he joined Heywoods Bank in Manchester. He remained with Heywoods until 1854, when he was appointed managing director of the Manchester and Salford Bank, which flourished under his aegis for the next twenty-two years. He resigned in October 1876, after losing his eyesight.<br>
<br>Langton was one of the leading members of the influential &eacute;lite which guided and dominated the cultural, intellectual, and philanthropic life of mid-nineteenth-century Manchester. He was associated with the establishment of some of its prominent institutions, and was among the founders of the Manchester Athenaeum in 1836 and the mechanics' institution two years earlier. His services were publicly recognized in 1881 by the presentation to the Athenaeum of his marble medallion bust, along with those of his co-founders, Richard Cobden and James Heywood. When the Chetham Society was founded in 1843, he was elected treasurer, and he subsequently served as the honorary secretary. He edited several volumes for the society. In 1846 he acted as secretary to a committee which was formed to promote a university for Manchester. Though unsuccessful, this scheme was instrumental in suggesting to John Owens the foundation of the college which bears his name and which formed the basis of the later university.<br>
<br>Langton was also, in association with Dr Kay (afterwards Sir J. P. Kay-Shuttleworth), a chief promoter of the Manchester Provident Society and of the Manchester Statistical Society, both established in 1833. In all his many cultural and philanthropic activities he was the close associate and collaborator of his friends and employers the Heywood family.<br>
<br>Langton married at Kirkham, Lancashire, on 15 November 1831, Margaret, daughter of Joseph Hornby of Ribby, Lancashire; the Hornbys and Langtons had had close business ties for over a century. The couple had three sons and six daughters; two of the daughters married sons of Sir Benjamin Heywood. Langton was an accurate genealogist, herald, and antiquary, a philologist, a skilful draughtsman, and a graceful writer of verse, both in his own language and in Italian. He spent his retirement at his house, Docklands, in Ingatestone, Essex, where he died on 29 September 1881. He was buried in Fryerning churchyard, Essex.<br>
