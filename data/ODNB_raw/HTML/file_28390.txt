<span class="headword">Wadsworth,  James</span> <span class="st"> [<em>pseud. </em>Diego  de Vadesfoote]</span>  (<em>b. </em>1604), <span class="occ">writer and government official</span>, was the second son and youngest child of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28389/', "James Wadsworth (c.1572&#150;1623)")</script>, vicar of Tharston, Suffolk, and his wife, Susannah. His father departed for Spain in 1605 as chaplain to the ambassador but left the embassy when he became a Catholic, and after 1610 his wife and children joined him in Andalusia. James the younger attended schools in Spain until 1618, when he entered the Jesuit English College at St Omer in Artois. After four years alongside the sons of English recusants, he joined other former students in a voyage from Calais to Sanl&uacute;car. On 16 August 1622 they were captured by the Dutch, who transferred them to a Hamburg merchant ship headed southward. On 3 September they were captured by Moroccan pirates and held at Sal&eacute;, near Rabat, until a ransom was pledged for their release and, finally, on 14 November the group reached Seville. Later in 1623 Wadsworth was asked to be an interpreter for courtiers in Prince Charles's entourage in Madrid.<br>
<br>Following the death of Wadsworth's father on 30 November 1623, his older brother, Hugh, and his mother lived on his father's pension, while his two sisters entered convents: Katherine at Lisbon in the Bridgettines, and Mary at Cambrai in the Benedictines. James was granted by Philip IV a captain's commission in the army of Flanders, although he had slight interest in a career on a battlefield, but he enjoyed the use of the title of captain. Late in 1625 he returned to England where he publicly denounced popery and offered his services as a spy to the privy council. Sent to Paris and later Calais, his performance was not successful, for he was imprisoned in both cities. Eventually Wadsworth settled down in London, where he wrote a memoir of his escapades that appeared in 1629 as <span class="italic">The English Spanish Pilgrime, or, A New Discoverie of Spanish Popery and Jesuitical Strategems</span>. Its popularity led to a second printing in 1630, and for its third he wrote a new prelude called <span class="italic">Further Observations &hellip;</span>. Here he was eager to establish his protestant credentials by warning of the dangers of Spain and St Omer and to dwell on his success with the pirates at Sal&eacute; in contrast to the Jesuits in Seville. A manuscript by William Atkins, of the original group on the voyage from St Omer, was printed with original evidence to contradict Wadsworth only in 1994. He ended the year 1630 with two new English translations. From an unknown Italian original he produced an essay entitled <span class="italic">The Present State of Spayne</span> and a French text by Jacques Gaultier appeared in English as <span class="italic">Miles gloriosus, the Spanish Bragadacio</span>.<br>
<br>For over two decades Wadsworth was a pursuivant, or messenger, of the court of high commission and the privy council. Armed with their warrants, he arrested for a fee recusants and priests, several of whom he knew from his years overseas with Catholic students. In 1635 he was summoned to answer charges of corrupt practices before the high commission but escaped conviction. His petitions for reimbursement by the crown give examples of his activities. In 1634 he sought the costs of &#145;bringing jesuits and papists to conviction&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1633&#150;4</i>, 319). In August and October 1643, Captain Wadsworth and two other messengers submitted their expenses for the &#145;priests indicted and attainted at the Old Bailey since 22 July 1640&#146;  (<span class="italic">Fifth Report</span>, HMC, 102, 109). He produced two more translations in 1640&#150;41: <span class="italic">On the Nature and Quality of Chocolate</span> from an original by Antonio Colmenero and, under a pseudonym of Diego de Vadesfoote, a guide to the fairs of Europe called <span class="italic">The European Mercury</span>. However, the fees of a pursuivant attracted him still. In December 1642 his testimony convicted his schoolmate at St Omer, the Jesuit Thomas Holland. He appeared at several other trials, including that of another Jesuit, Henry Morse, in January 1645.<br>
<br>After the civil war the role of the pursuivants declined, so that a contemporary royalist observed an impoverished Wadsworth in 1656 to be a &#145;renegade, proselyte, turncote of any religion&#146; who lived in Westminster as a &#145;common Hackney to the basest catchpole Bayliffs&#146;  (Sanderson, 491). The date of his death is unknown.<br>
