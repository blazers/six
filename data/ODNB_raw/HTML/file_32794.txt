<span class="headword">Syllas,  Stelios Messinesos <span class="st"> [Leo]</span>  de</span>  (1917&#150;1964), <span class="occ">architect</span>, was born at Northbrook, Holmwood, Surrey, on 24 July 1917, the younger son of Stelios de Syllas, painter, and his wife, Vera Rose Palatiano. His mother came from a very conventional Greek family in Corfu, but had Anglo-Irish connections on her mother's side. Her parents disapproved of de Syllas, who came from a less respectable background, and as a result they eloped first to Munich, before moving to Britain in 1911. De Syllas's father had little success as a painter and turned to making toys. Leo was educated at Haberdashers' Aske's School, Hatcham, and Christ's College, Finchley, and proceeded to the Bartlett school of architecture at University College, London, in 1933. Here he rebelled against the classicism of Professor Albert Richardson by designing a modernist project, which was failed. He transferred in 1936 for his two final years to the Architectural Association, where the implications of modernism were being extended from the formal to their left-wing social, political, and intellectual dimensions by a lively group of students with whom de Syllas was associated as an editor of the magazine <span class="italic">Focus</span> (1938&#150;9). Richard Llewelyn-Davies was a close friend and mentor, especially in political matters. In 1939 de Syllas, Anthony Cox (another <span class="italic">Focus</span> editor), and nine other recent Architectural Association graduates formed the Architects' Co-operative Partnership with the intention of practising in the new collaborative and research-based manner for which they had campaigned as students.<br>
<br>Further progress was interrupted almost immediately by the war. De Syllas joined the research and experiments department of the ministry of home security. On 1 August 1942 he married Phoebe Helen (1913&#150;1986), daughter of Ralph Lucas, engineering designer, and sister of the architect Colin Lucas, whose first husband, A. W. Nicol, an original Architects' Co-operative Partnership member, was killed in an accident. He had two stepsons and a son and daughter. In 1943 de Syllas went to the British West Indies as assistant architect to Robert J. Gardner-Medwin in the Colonial Development and Welfare Organisation to work on a programme of buildings for education, housing, and health. In 1946 he was appointed architect and planning officer to the government of Barbados, whose sugar production was valuable for the post-war British economy, and was responsible for the master plan of Bridgetown. De Syllas designed a training college in the grounds of Erdiston House (1947), which incorporated well-lit dormitories and classrooms, shaded with overhanging roofs, in local coral block masonry. On returning to Britain in 1947, de Syllas rejoined the pre-war partnership, which in 1951 was renamed Architects' Co-Partnership (ACP). Work was seldom attributed to individuals, but de Syllas was involved at this time in the design of Leesbrook School, a secondary modern, at Chaddesden in Derbyshire, completed in 1955.<br>
<br>The opportunities for building in developing countries continued to excite de Syllas, and in 1954 he opened a branch office of ACP in Lagos, Nigeria. Work included the Bristol Hotel, Lagos, completed in 1961, and a large housing development at Akosombo in Ghana to serve the upper Volta River project. He remained most fascinated by the technical and social aspects of architecture, describing himself on one occasion as &#145;only 99 per cent architect&#146;. None the less, his rooftop extension to Simpson's, Piccadilly, London (1963), contributes by spirited contrast to Joseph Emberton's original building of 1935. In 1962 de Syllas was responsible for the winning ACP competition design for the St Paul's Cathedral choir school in New Change, which followed the materials of Wren's cathedral while breaking its own mass into separate units. Following his death this was built with only minor changes.<br>
<br>A man of enthusiastic energy, de Syllas pursued his overseas commitments without any diminution of his interest in architectural affairs at home. He was elected to the council of the Architectural Association in 1956 and was next in line for the presidency when he died. He strongly supported the merger, then being proposed, with Imperial College. He was active in the association's pioneering department of tropical studies and was largely responsible for establishing a link between the Architectural Association and the University of Science and Technology at Kumasi, Ghana. In 1963 he was chairman of the Royal Institute of British Architects Commonwealth Architects' Conference.<br>
<br>De Syllas was tall and striking in appearance. Although initially hampered by his non-English name and background, he came to recognize their exotic value. He was animated and fluent in movement, talking and gesticulating continuously. Warm-hearted and gregarious by nature, he showed a readiness to communicate in several languages uninhibited by an imperfect command of some of them, which was always compensated for by his genuine charm and sincerity. Full of stimulating ideas and with an infectious optimism, he got on notably well with young people, whose outlook he found refreshing. His early vision of modernism was modified by an increasing awareness of architectural context and tradition. He believed in combining practice with teaching and in the early 1950s joined other ACP partners in teaching the third year at the Architectural Association.<br>
<br>In 1951 de Syllas took his family to live in a Victorian house, St Julian's, near Sevenoaks, which was established as an experiment in communal living. Phoebe de Syllas, whose talents were overshadowed by her husband, was an interior designer and wrote on this subject. Leo de Syllas was killed in a road accident near Le Kef in Tunisia on 30 January 1964, while working on a project for new schools for the Tunisian government.<br>
