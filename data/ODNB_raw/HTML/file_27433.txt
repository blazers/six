<span class="headword">Tidcomb <span class="st"> [Tidcombe]</span>,  John</span>  (1642&#150;1713), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was the son of Peter Tidcomb of Calne, Wiltshire. The claim in the <span class="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</span> that he was a servitor at Oriel College, Oxford, has now been disproved, the Oxford Tidcomb having died in 1663. During the reign of Charles II he was appointed gentleman pensioner and officiated at the coronation of James II. Gazetted captain in the earl of Huntingdon's foot on 20 June 1685, he was absent without leave in part of 1688, probably helping to co-ordinate the army conspiracy against James II. Between 14 and 16 November 1688, in company with Ensign Samuel Bonfoy, a known conspirator, Tidcomb left his post in Plymouth garrison and deserted to William's camp at Exeter. Promoted colonel of the 14th foot on 14 November 1692, he accompanied William III to Oxford in 1695 and was created DCL on 9 November. His regiment was transferred to the Irish establishment during the great disbandment following the treaty of Ryswick in 1697. In August 1701, on receipt of notice to embark for the West Indies, one company deserted from Limerick and fled into the mountains. A prot&eacute;g&eacute; of the second duke of Ormond, he was created brigadier-general on 17 August 1702, major-general on 1 January 1704, and lieutenant-general on 1 January 1707. Tidcomb,<blockquote>while he continued a subaltern officer, was every day complaining against the pride, oppression, and hard treatment of colonels towards their officers; yet in a very few minutes after he had received his commission for a regiment, walking with the friend on the Mall, he confessed that the spirit of colonelship was fast coming upon him, which spirit is said to have daily increased to the hour of his death. (<span class="italic">Prose Works of Jonathan Swift</span>, 192)</blockquote>A member of the Kit-Cat Club, Tidcomb was a society figure and wit. When Mrs Manley (Mary de la Rivi&egrave;re) was dismissed by the duchess of Cleveland, he &#145;offered her asylum at his country house&#146;, but she declined his overtures  (Noble, 2.199). Tidcomb is the Sir Charles Lovemore who, in Mrs Manley's memoirs, relates her story to his friend, the Chevalier d'Aumont, in the gardens of Somerset House. In the introduction he is characterized as a &#145;person of admirable good sense and knowledge&#146;  (<span class="italic">Rivella</span>, 1). Tidcomb died at Bath in June 1713.<br>
