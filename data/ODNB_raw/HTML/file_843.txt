<span class="headword">Atkins,  William</span>  (1601&#150;1681), <span class="occ">Jesuit</span>, was born in Cambridgeshire. In August 1622 he was one of a party of twelve Catholic students sent from the Jesuit college at St Omer to the English seminary at Seville who sailed from Calais on a ship of the Dunkirk fleet. Captured after a battle with a Dutch privateer, they were transferred to a merchantman crewed by Hamburg Mennonites. This vessel, in turn, was boarded off Cape St Vincent by Morisco corsairs and conveyed to their base at Sal&eacute;, on the Moroccan coast. The students' month-long imprisonment, escape, and subsequent voyage to Gibraltar by way of Mamora, Alarache, and Tangier were equally hazardous. Atkins's later narrative of their adventures was discovered in manuscript at Moseley Old Hall, near Wolverhampton, in 1855. It is the earliest account by a European of the pirate state of Sal&eacute; established between 1609 and 1614 by Spanish speaking Moriscos expelled from Extremadura who, joined by English and Dutch pirates, made Sal&eacute; the base for raids on Atlantic shipping. Atkins's narrative is a unique eyewitness account of Sal&eacute; in its formative state, affording evidence about its everyday life and customs, government, and the treatment of captives. Written some time after 1637, it corrects the much shorter version of events in <span class="italic">The English-Spanish Pilgrime</span> (1629) of James Wadsworth, another of the twelve students, who later turned apostate and informer.<br>
<br>After six years at St Gregory's College, Seville, where he was ordained priest in 1628, Atkins entered the Society of Jesus at the noviciate of the English province in Watten, Spanish Netherlands, in 1629. He was in England by 1631 and spent the following fifty years as a missioner in and around Wolverhampton. The fact that the manuscript of his narrative was preserved at Moseley Old Hall, the home of the Whitgreave family, suggests a connection with Thomas Whitgreave (1625&#150;1702), the squire of Moseley, famous for having sheltered the future king Charles II in September 1651. In 1653 Atkins was appointed rector of the Jesuit college, or sub-province, of St Aloysius, covering Lancashire, Derbyshire, Cheshire, and Staffordshire. He was living at Wolverhampton, an old man in his late seventies, when he fell victim to the persecution provoked by Titus Oates. In August 1679 he and Andrew Bromwich, a secular priest, appeared at Stafford assizes before Lord Chief Justice Scroggs on a charge of being Romish priests. A stroke six years earlier had left Atkins paralysed, deaf, and virtually speechless: he could answer only through a spokesman, and the sentence of death had to be shouted in his ear. Reprieved on account of his age, he died in Stafford gaol on 17 March 1681.<br>
