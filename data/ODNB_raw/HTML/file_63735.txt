<span class="headword">Pollard,  Alfred Oliver</span>  (1893&#150;1960), <span class="occ">army officer and author</span>, was born at Rycroft, Melbourne Road, Wallington, Mitcham, on 4 May 1893, the second son of James Alfred Pollard (<i>d</i>. 1933), who worked in the City of London for Alliance Assurance Co., and his wife, Ada Jane Payne. He spent his early years at Tidbury, Belmont Road, Wallington, and was educated between 1906 and 1908 at Merchant Taylors' School, London.<br>
<br>At the outbreak of the First World War, Pollard was working as an insurance clerk for the same company as his father, in their St James's Street branch. He hurried to enlist in the Honourable Artillery Company (HAC), fretted at the delay in getting to the war, and then spent most of it in France and Flanders, in the course of which he won the Victoria Cross for his actions at Gavrelle (28&#150;9 April 1917), and two MCs (gazetted 26 March 1917 and the bar 18 June 1917); he also received the DCM for his bravery, while a sergeant, on 30 September 1915 in Sanctuary Wood, near Ypres. He received his VC and MC and bar at Buckingham Palace on 21 July 1917.<br>
<br>Pollard's chief claim to fame lies in an autobiographical account of his time in the war, with the entirely apposite title <span class="italic">Fire-Eater: the Memoirs of a VC</span>; this was published in 1932. Pollard's book shows that he enjoyed his war in much the same way that Ernst J&uuml;nger's autobiographical <span class="italic">Storm of Steel</span> (1929) showed that J&uuml;nger enjoyed his. Pollard was utterly convinced of the justice of the war. He noted in <span class="italic">Fire-Eater</span>, after recovering from a wound received while winning his DCM,<blockquote>I had fought for a year for the joy of it, for My Lady [his future wife], because I happened to be sent to France, for no particular reason. In future I would fight for my Country because it was the right thing to do. (<span class="italic">Fire-Eater</span>, 130)</blockquote>He writes in a lively, &#145;Schoolboy's Own&#146; style, but this should not fool the reader into concluding that he was unthinking or without emotion. In January 1917, on the Somme, he led a patrol into the German lines and comments on his feelings.<blockquote>In June 1915 I was a mere boy looking on life with hopeful optimism, and on war as an interesting adventure. When I saw the Hun corpses killed by our shellfire I was full of pity for the men so suddenly cut off in their prime. Now I was a man with no hope of the War ending for years. I looked at a trench full of corpses without any sensation whatever. Neither pity nor fear that I might soon be one myself, nor anger against their killers. Nothing stirred me. I was just a machine carrying out my appointed work to the best of my ability. (ibid., 173)</blockquote>
<span class="italic">Fire-Eater</span> has many somewhat bitter references to his first wife, Mary Ainsley (<i>b</i>. 1891/2), whom he had eventually married on 4 June 1918; the marriage ended in divorce in 1924. He found it hard to settle, and in June 1924, at about the time of his divorce, he entered the Royal Air Force as a pilot; he resigned as a flying officer in December 1926. On 5 September 1925 he married Violet Irene Swarbrick (<i>b</i>. 1899/1900), who was to outlive him by three months, dying on 4 March 1961. There were no children of either marriage.<br>
<br>Pollard took a variety of jobs, including ones which involved training salesmen and being director of a small aero-engineering firm. In 1930 he turned to writing, mainly mystery, murder, and spy novels, with titles such as <span class="italic">Pirdale Island</span> (1931) and <span class="italic">Murder Hide and Seek</span> (1931). <span class="italic">Fire-Eater</span> was his fourth book, and by far the best. During the Second World War the books had a contemporary note, for example <span class="italic">ARP Spy</span> and <span class="italic">Gestapo Fugitive</span>, both published in 1940. The last of his fifty-three titles was <span class="italic">Wrong Verdict</span> (1960). Another of Pollard's jobs was that of a columnist, on a range of London and provincial papers, writing about chivalry (or the lack of it), air power, courage, and the appalling treatment of war veterans. He claimed in the <span class="italic">Dundee Evening Telegraph</span> (January 1932) that his attempts to pawn his medals in &#145;twenty or thirty pawnshops in London&#146; resulted in the reply that his VC they could not take and the others were &#145;not worth bothering with&#146;. Pollard also engaged in some broadcasting for the BBC. He died suddenly on 4 December 1960 at his home, Linkwood, 18 Queen's Park Gardens, Bournemouth, and was cremated in Bournemouth on 7 December.<br>
