<span class="headword">Knollys, Sir  William Thomas</span>  (1797&#150;1883), <span class="occ">army officer and courtier</span>, born on 1 August 1797, was the eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15761/', "General William Knollys, styled eighth earl of Banbury")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15754/', "Knollys, Charles, styled fourth earl of Banbury")</script>], and his wife, Charlotte Martha Blackwell. Until 1813 William held the courtesy title of Viscount Wallingford. Educated at Harrow School and the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, Knollys received his first commission in 1813, when little more than sixteen, in the 3rd, later Scots, Guards, and was almost immediately dispatched to the Peninsula. From there he crossed the Bidassoa into France with the victorious British army, and, after the passage of the Adour, was attached to the force that invested Bayonne. Knollys narrowly escaped capture during a French attack at Bayonne on 14 April 1814.<br>
<br>On the signing of peace he returned to England, but directly after the battle of Waterloo he was sent to join the army of occupation in Paris. In 1821 he was appointed adjutant, and from this worked his way through successive grades to become lieutenant-colonel of his battalion in 1844, and then regimental colonel in 1850. His adjutant was Sir Frederick Stephenson, and under their joint efforts the regiment was held to be one of the best drilled, disciplined, and organized in the British army. On 29 September 1830 he married Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1878), the illegitimate daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/24481/', "Sir John St Aubyn")</script>; they had five sons and three daughters.<br>
<br>From 1850 Knollys instructed Prince Albert in the art of soldiering, and won his firm support. In 1854 he was promoted major-general and appointed governor of Guernsey, and in 1855 he went to Paris to study the French system of supplying troops when in action. At the same time the camp at Aldershot was created, with Knollys in command. The army at the time utterly lacked administrative cohesion. It therefore fell to Knollys's lot not only to form his Aldershot staff and to organize the troops into brigades and divisions, but to initiate the diverse departments of commissariat, transport, stores, and even the medical and chaplain's departments. He took it upon himself to instruct some of the first arrivals in camp in how to pitch tents, and by sharing a tent life with them taught them the elementary duties of soldiers in the field. On the death of General Bucknall Estcourt, chief of the staff in the Crimea, in June 1855, Knollys was selected to succeed him; but the appointment was cancelled, on the ground of his seniority, which would have entailed the supersession of many other Crimean generals. Notwithstanding his disappointment, he resumed his labours at Aldershot with undiminished energy. Aldershot was unpopular with the public, but Knollys received undiminished support from Prince Albert, who with the queen visited the camp frequently. Success exceeded expectation. General von Moltke was one of the foreign visitors to the camp, and, on the rare occasions when he broke his habitual silence, he evinced his surprise and approval at the progress made by British troops. When Knollys's command came to an end in 1860 he had established Aldershot on a basis of efficient organization.<br>
<br>In 1861, at the instance of the prince consort, Knollys accepted the post of president of the council of military education. In 1862 he was selected by the queen as treasurer and comptroller of the household of the prince of Wales. For fifteen years he performed the responsible and laborious duties attached to this confidential position, frequently accompanying the prince, especially during the earlier period, in his travels abroad and in his visits to foreign courts. The position was no sinecure. Victoria regarded him as &#145;a species of Mentor &hellip; who would be responsible to Me to a great extent for what took place&#146;, and tried to hold him to account when the prince's actions displeased her, as they did when he visited Garibaldi at Stafford House in 1864. Knollys's reports to the queen convey his constant anxiety over the prince's gambling and morals, and over the intransigent dislike of the Prussians felt by Alexandra, which caused particular difficulties during a visit to Wiesbaden in 1867. He retired from office in 1877, and became gentleman usher of the black rod in the same year.<br>
<br>The honorary distinctions of LLD and DCL were conferred on Knollys by the universities of Oxford and Cambridge (respectively) in 1863 and 1864. In 1867 he was created a KCB, and in 1871 he was made a member of the privy council. In 1872 he once more had a short interlude of military duty, when he was appointed umpire in chief in conjunction with Sir Hope Grant during the Salisbury manoeuvres. On 19 June 1883 Knollys was gazetted to the colonelcy of the Scots Guards, the regiment in which he had begun his career. He died four days later, on 23 June 1883 at his home, Black Rod's House, Westminster Palace, in his eighty-sixth year, and was carried to his grave in Highgate cemetery on 27 June by sergeants of his old regiment. His second son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/34351/', "Francis Knollys, later Viscount Knollys")</script>, inherited the family estates, to the exclusion of his elder brother.<br>
