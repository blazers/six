<span class="headword">Medley,  Samuel</span>  (1738&#150;1799), <span class="occ">Particular Baptist minister and hymn writer</span>, was born at Cheshunt, Hertfordshire, on 23 June 1738, the second son of Guy Medley (<i>d</i>. 1760), tutor, and Elizabeth, the youngest daughter of William Tonge, schoolmaster in Enfield, Middlesex. His grandfather, Samuel Medley, had been a diplomatist, and his father, who was a considerable linguist, had served as attorney-general of St Vincent before settling in Cheshunt, where he kept a school. His father was a deacon at Eagle Street Particular Baptist Church, Holborn, where the pastor was Andrew Gifford, and corresponded frequently with the religious writer James Hervey, offering loving criticism on his works.<br>
<br>After being educated at William Tonge's school in Enfield, at the age of fourteen Samuel Medley was apprenticed to an oilman of the city of London, but in 1755 secured his freedom in order to follow his brothers into the navy. During his naval years he confesses &#145;he had neither the fear of God nor man&#146;  (<span class="italic">Memoirs</span>, 66). Severely wounded, with incipient gangrene threatening the need for amputation of a limb, he turned to prayer, and an apparently miraculous cure ensued. However, as his health improved, so his new-found seriousness declined. Invalided out of the navy, he lived with his grandfather and was convinced of sin under a grand-paternal reading of a sermon by Isaac Watts. Attendance on the preaching of Whitfield and Gifford led to his conversion in July 1760, just before the death of his father. He sealed this by joining the Eagle Street church, which practised strict communion, by public profession of his faith in baptism in December 1760. Using his grandfather's excellent library he equipped himself in biblical languages and the study of the sacred text.<br>
<br>Following his marriage to Mary, daughter of William Gill, a hosier from Nottingham, on 17 April 1762, Medley started a school in Soho. However, under the tutelage of Gifford, he discovered a call to the ministry to which he was set aside by the Eagle Street Church on 29 August 1766, with his first endeavours exercised at Harlington, near Hounslow. Ivimey says that Gifford had hoped Medley might have become his assistant, but in June 1767 he accepted a call to the church at Watford which had been pastorless for five years. He was ordained on 13 July 1768, Gifford presiding, with Robert Robinson of Cambridge offering the ordination prayer. Because of the financial deficiencies of the congregation Medley combined the pastorate with running a school.<br>
<br>The Particular Baptist church in Liverpool, which practised closed communion, was in 1771 facing severe difficulties consequent on the revelation of the moral lapses of its then pastor. John Livesley, a senior deacon, on a visit to London discovered that Medley might be persuaded to take a northern pastorate, and accordingly Medley was invited to preach in Liverpool for two Sundays in December 1771. The impression was such that he was immediately invited to the vacant pastorate, and the family accordingly moved to Liverpool in April 1772, where Medley was able to devote all his energies to the pastorate. Within a year the church needed to be enlarged, and in 1789 new and commodious premises were opened on Byrom Street. In addition to his normal pastoral duties he took a special interest in the Liverpool seamen.<br>
<br>In 1786 a group of northern Baptist leaders met in Preston and determined to break the spell of hyper-Calvinism and reshape their association on the model of what was happening within the Northamptonshire Association. Much of the leadership fell to Medley in association with his good friend John Fawcett of the Wainsgate church at Hebden Bridge, both of them successful hymn writers. Of Medley's hymns, only &#145;I know that my Redeemer lives&#146; remains in regular use, though it has been suggested that Thomas Kelly's &#145;We sing the praise of him who died&#146; is really Medley's. By contrast to the urbane Medley, Fawcett was a rough-hewn northern autodidact. That Fawcett became a successful schoolmaster was partly due to instruction he received from Medley.<br>
<br>With his well-kept wigs and cultivated southern education, Medley suggested a very different appearance from the other northern Baptist leaders, but commitment and faith soon brought them together. Sellers argues that Medley &#145;preached a warm Evangelical Calvinism&#146; but, out of deference to the narrower &#145;walled garden&#146; mentality of the staunch Calvinists of the north-west, never avowed himself a Fullerite  (Sellers, 114). The extent to which Medley shared the views of Joseph Ivimey, Gifford's successor at the Eagle Street Church from 1805, in criticizing those who &#145;preached upon the non-application, non-invitation scheme&#146; of higher Calvinism has been contested. Some claim that he did not, but implicit invitation seems very evident in the way in which the attractions and admonitions of the gospel were placed before &#145;Christless sinners&#146;. Medley exhorted in a sermon preached at Moorfields in October 1777<blockquote>let me intreat you to consider what will all your worldly wealth do for you in a dying hour &hellip; Oh, sirs, the unsearchable and inexhaustible riches of Christ are the one thing needful, to make poor sinners rich, and miserable sinners happy. May the Lord help you to consider this to your soul's eternal welfare and salvation. (<span class="italic">Memoirs</span>, 196)</blockquote>Halley, who speaks of the Lancashire Baptists being &#145;neither very general nor very particular, neither low Arminians nor high Calvinists&#146;, ranks Medley as &#145;a great preacher&#146;  (Halley, 2.478, 480). Medley exercised an &#145;earnest, popular and prolonged ministry&#146;, while displaying &#145;his liberal and catholic spirit&#146; in forming happy associations with the Liverpool Independents  (ibid., 2.480). He was certainly one of those who readily gave support to the infant missionary society in which his son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18502/', "Samuel Medley (1769&#150;1857)")</script>, painter, took a particular interest.<br>
<br>Medley maintained close contact with metropolitan revivalist Calvinism, and regularly supplied the pulpit at Whitfield's chapels at Moorfields Tabernacle and Tottenham Court Road. Indeed it was on a visit to these churches that his final illness began upon its critical progress. With difficulty he returned to Liverpool, where he died on 17 July 1799, anxious to clarify that he was no Arminian, Arian, or Socinian. He was buried in Liverpool on 24 July.<br>
