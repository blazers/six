<span class="headword">Strutt,  William Goodday</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1762, <em>d.</em> 1848), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was baptized at Springfield, Essex, on 26 February 1762, the third son of John Strutt (1727&#150;1816) MP, of Terling Place, Essex, and his wife, Anne (1732&#150;1814), the daughter of the Revd William Goodday of Maldon, rector of Strelly, Nottinghamshire. He also had an elder sister. After attending Felsted School and Lochee's military academy, Chelsea, he entered the army, joining his regiment, the 61st, at Minorca. In 1799 he was promoted lieutenant, and later was appointed to a company in the 91st, with whom he took part in the defence of St Lucia. In 1782, having exchanged into the 97th, he served at the siege of Gibraltar. He purchased a majority in the 60th regiment in 1783 and, being placed on half pay, visited several German courts to observe their military organization. In 1787 he went with his regiment to the West Indies. He purchased a lieutenant-colonelcy in 1790 and was removed in 1792 to the 54th. In 1793 he saw much hard fighting in Flanders. On his return he was sent to St Vincent, where he was promoted brigadier-general in 1795. In January 1796, with two hundred men, he attacked a force of twelve hundred, was wounded three times, and had to have his right leg amputated above the knee. After returning to England in 1796 he received the governorship of Stirling Castle, a sinecure, on 23 February, but afterwards served on the staff in Ireland. The loss of his leg and attendant poor health obliged him to cease active service, although on 23 June 1798 he was promoted major-general. On 13 May 1800 he was given another sinecure, that of governor of Quebec. He never visited that city, though he held the post until his death.<br>
<br>In retirement Strutt spent much time at Southend, Essex, and was one of the prime movers in the building of Southend pier, the longest in the world, and of the nearby church of St John the Baptist. He died unmarried at his home, Tofts, Little Baddow, Essex, on 5 February 1848 and was buried in the family vault at Terling.<br>
