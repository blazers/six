</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Chain, Sir  Ernst Boris</span>  (1906&#150;1979), <span class="occ">biochemist</span>, was born on 19 June 1906 in Berlin, the only son of the two children of Dr Michael Chain, a Russian-born industrial chemist, and his wife, Margarete Eisner, who was related to Kurt Eisner, the socialist prime minister of Bavaria assassinated in 1919. Chain's parents were both Jewish, and faith played an important role in the house. His father died in 1919, leaving the family without an income; Chain's mother turned the family home into a guest house, but nevertheless their financial situation remained strained. The young Chain showed flair for both music and science, but the influence of his cousin (Mrs Sacharina, a widow twenty years his senior, who joined the household in 1923) turned him towards science.<br>
<br>Chain was educated in Berlin at the Luisengymnasium and the University of Berlin from which he graduated in chemistry and physiology in 1930. He then obtained a doctorate for research in the chemical department of the Institute of Pathology at the Charit&eacute; Hospital. After graduation Chain dabbled with the idea of a musical career, performing on numerous Berlin platforms, writing as music critic for the newspaper <span class="italic">Welt am Abend</span>, and (unsuccessfully) attempting to organize exchanges of musicians between Russia, Germany, and Argentina (1930&#150;31). However, contemporaries said that Chain now began to realize that, although a good pianist, he would never be a truly great one.<br>
<br>With the election of Hitler to power in 1933 Chain emigrated to Britain and sought to begin a scientific career. After a few months at University College Hospital, London, he obtained a place in the department of biochemistry at Cambridge. Chain worked under Sir Frederick Gowland Hopkins for a second PhD, believing a Cambridge doctorate would advance an English career. During his years at Cambridge, Chain developed an irrational fear of being poisoned in the laboratory, which led to panic attacks and weakness. As a result, stomach pains were misdiagnosed as a psychological illness and he was temporarily placed in a specialist nursing home, from which he was released only by the combined efforts of a European acquaintance and his friend Ashley Miles. He was then seen by Mrs Sacharina's doctor in Paris, who diagnosed appendicitis.<br>
<br>The election of Howard Florey to the chair of pathology at Oxford in 1935 set the scene for Chain's subsequent life. Florey believed that experimental pathology would benefit from the collaboration of pathologists with chemists and offered him the chance to develop a department of biochemistry within the Sir William Dunn School of Pathology. In 1936 he became university lecturer and demonstrator in chemical pathology. At Florey's suggestion he began to study the mode of action of a bacteriolytic enzyme, lysozyme. This led him to read other accounts of the production of anti-microbial substances by micro-organisms, and, during discussions with Florey in 1938, he suggested that they should jointly investigate some of these substances. Their decision to do this was motivated by scientific rather than medical interest, but fortunately penicillin (found by Fleming in 1928) was one of three substances chosen for study. Fleming had first believed that penicillin might be useful as an antiseptic, but he was quickly disheartened by its instability and did not realize that it might cure bacterial infections. Thus, for more than ten years, penicillin had aroused little medical interest.<br>
<br>Although Chain was confident that the problem of penicillin's instability could be overcome, little progress with its purification was made until N. G. Heatley suggested that it could be transferred from organic solvent into a neutral aqueous solution. In the spring of 1940 Florey, urged by Chain to begin his intended biological experiments, showed that preparations of penicillin no more than 1 per cent pure would protect mice from infections with streptococci and staphylococci when introduced into the bloodstream. This dramatic result entirely changed the focus of research. High priority was given to the laboratory production of enough penicillin for a small clinical trial. With the success of this trial, even using only 3 per cent pure preparations, penicillin suddenly became a substance of major medical importance and of potential value in surgery during the Second World War.<br>
<br>Chain, together with Edward P. Abraham, showed some bacteria were resistant to penicillin because of their production of a penicillin-inactivating enzyme, penicillinase. They then began to purify penicillin and, early in 1943, joined with Sir Robert Robinson, Wilson Baker, and others to study its chemistry. Chain became a strong supporter of a &#946;-lactam structure for penicillin, which was proposed in October 1943 but remained controversial until Dorothy Hodgkin and Barbara Low confirmed it two years later by X-ray crystallography. During these war years Chain played an active part in a major Anglo-American enterprise to produce penicillin by chemical synthesis. However, although this collaborative effort threw interesting light on the chemistry of penicillin it failed in its final aim, and, in the event, it was the increased yield obtainable by fermentation of <i>Penicillium chrysogenum</i> that enabled penicillin to be produced on a large scale.<br>
<br>Chain was a stimulus to Florey and for some years their relationship was amicable, but it deteriorated when Chain began to complain that he was receiving too little credit for his research and to believe that his failure to realize his ambitions in England was due to his foreign background. In 1948 he left Oxford for Rome to become director of a new international research centre for chemical microbiology at the Istituto Superiore di Sanit&agrave;. Before leaving he married, on 7 October 1948, <a href="#cosubject_50825">Dr Anne Ethel Beloff [<i>see below</i>]</a>, who was herself a biochemist; they subsequently collaborated in studies of the mode of action of insulin. They had a son (Benjamin) and then twins, a son and a daughter (Danny and Judy). Their married life was most contented.<br>
<br>In Rome, Chain faced no financial problems and set up a pilot plant for antibiotic production. He was strongly in favour of collaboration between academic and industrial institutions. He became a consultant to the Beecham Group and suggested that it should explore further the potential of penicillin. Two members of this company, G. N. Rolinson and F. R. Batchelor, were seconded to his laboratory in 1956 to become acquainted with penicillin fermentation. During their visit they made observations that later led to the isolation of the nucleus of the penicillin molecule and to the chemical synthesis from this nucleus of a series of new and clinically valuable penicillins.<br>
<br>In the 1950s Chain became anxious about the future of the Istituto Superiore di Sanit&agrave; after its influential director-general, Domenico Marotta, had retired. In 1961 he accepted the chair of biochemistry at Imperial College, London, although he retained his position in Rome until 1964. His requirements were expensive and the return to England involved him in plans for a new department with a fermentation plant and the raising of relatively large sums of money to construct and maintain it. Despite a number of large grants, the financial base for his operations was not entirely secure.<br>
<br>At Imperial College, Chain worked with different colleagues on a variety of topics, ranging from a phytotoxin to an inducer of interferon production and the mode of action of insulin. But, as the time for his retirement in 1973 approached, he became deeply absorbed in an unsuccessful attempt to ensure that his successor would be in a field closely related to his own and would not be a molecular biologist.<br>
<br>Chain's role in the initiation of the work on penicillin in Oxford was his major contribution to medicine. He shared a Nobel prize with Fleming and Florey in 1945 and was elected to the fellowship of the Royal Society in 1949. He became an honorary fellow of the Royal College of Physicians in 1965 and was knighted in 1969. His many honours from other countries included the Paul Ehrlich centenary prize in 1954, appointment to the order of the Rising Sun, second degree, from Japan in 1976, and the grand decoration of honour in gold of the Federal Republic of Austria in 1973. In 1976 he became foreign member of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR.<br>
<br>Chain was a highly gifted and voluble man, with a jolly face, which was permanently adorned with a voluminous moustache. He was able to converse fluently in German, French, Russian, and Italian, as well as in English, and was socially engaging. Music always remained a major interest in his life and he played the piano with distinction. Throughout Chain's later life his Jewish identity became increasingly important to him. He became involved with the Weizmann Institute of Science at Rehovoth, becoming a member of the board of governors in 1954, and later a member of the executive council. He ensured his children were brought up securely within the Jewish faith, arranging much extra-curricular tuition for them. His views were expressed most clearly in his speech &#145;Why I am a Jew&#146; given at the World Jewish Congress Conference of Intellectuals in 1965.<br>
<br>In 1971 Chain built a house at Mulranny in co. Mayo. He died there on 12 August 1979.<br>
<br>Chain's wife, <a name="cosubject_50825"></a><span class="headword">Anne Ethel  Beloff-Chain</span>  (1921&#150;1991), <span class="occ">biochemist</span>, was born in Hampstead, Middlesex, on 26 June 1921, the youngest of the five children of Simon Beloff, export merchant, of Russian Jewish origin, and his wife, Marie, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Katzin. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/72047/', "Max Beloff, Baron Beloff (1913&#150;1999)")</script>, historian, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/65232/', "Nora Beloff (1919&#150;1997)")</script>, journalist, were among her older siblings. She read chemistry at University College, London, graduating with first-class honours in 1942, and pursued her doctoral research on the biochemistry of skin burns at Oxford under Sir Rudolph Peters, and subsequently at Harvard Medical School with Dr Chris Anfinson and Dr Baird Hastings. In 1947 she returned briefly to Oxford as a tutor in biochemistry at Somerville College before marrying Chain and accompanying him to Rome. While raising their children she held the post of chief research scientist at the Istituto Superiore di Sanit&agrave;, investigating intermediate metabolism in animal tissues, especially the biochemistry of insulin and other hormones. On their return to London, both were employed at Imperial College, Anne as reader in biochemistry and, from 1983, professor of biochemistry. In 1986 she moved to the new University of Buckingham as professor to set up and direct an active research group in biochemistry, with funding from the Clore Foundation. She shared with her husband delight in their extended families and a concern with social and charitable causes. She was also involved with the Weizman Institute of Science in Israel, where she was a governor and member of its executive council. She died at her home in Camden, London, on 2 December 1991.<br>
