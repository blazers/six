<span class="headword">John,  Griffith</span>  (1831&#150;1912), <span class="occ">missionary</span>, was born on 14 December 1831 at Swansea in Wales, youngest of the four children and the only son of Griffith John and Ann, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Davies. His parents were deeply religious Welsh Congregationalists; his mother died before his first birthday. Having joined Ebenezer Chapel (Congregational) when he was only eight years old, what formal education John enjoyed was primarily church-related, and his precocity enabled him to memorize and often dramatically to recite large portions of scripture. At twelve years old he entered the employ of John Williams&#151;pious owner of extensive iron and coal mines and smelting furnaces&#151;as a clerk in the general store in Onllwyn. It was here that John, aged fourteen, preached his first sermon, successfully surmounting doubts concerning his youth; he was known throughout south Wales as the Boy Preacher by the time he was sixteen.<br>
<br>Determined to enrol in college John returned in 1848 to Swansea, where he was privately tutored in preparation for entry to Memorial College, Brecon, in September 1850. He graduated with his credentials for the Congregational ministry in 1854. He was deeply influenced by Henry Griffiths, then principal of the college, and offered himself to the London Missionary Society (LMS) in 1853 for missionary service in Madagascar, the land in which David and Mary Griffiths (parents of his future wife) had served with distinction from 1821 to 1834. Madagascar being at the time closed to missionaries, he was persuaded by LMS directors to accept an appointment in China instead.<br>
<br>John's brief attendance at Bedford Academy for missionaries in 1854 was followed by his ordination at Ebenezer Chapel in Swansea, and by his marriage to Margaret Jane Griffiths on 13 April 1855. The Johns set sail for China on 21 May 1855 and arrived at Shanghai on 24 September 1855. Margaret John was constantly plagued by ill health and died on 24 March 1873 on a voyage to England. On 23 October 1874 John married Jeannette Jenkins, widow of Dr Benjamin Jenkins, a missionary of the American Methodist Episcopal church; she was much admired and widely emulated for her work among foreign sailors. She died at Hangchow (Hangzhou) in China, on 29 December 1885. John's two sons, Griffith and David, were both born in China, as was his daughter, Mary Beatrice Louisa (<i>b</i>. 1863); she later became the wife of the LMS missionary Charles George Sparham.<br>
<br>John manifested a lifelong penchant for adventure. An inveterate traveller, he became well known for his extensive missionary journeys into the Chinese interior, journeys which sometimes stretched to distances of 3000 miles or more. In July 1861 he moved to Hangchow, which remained his base until his final departure from China in 1912. It was here that John&#151;fluent in both spoken and written Chinese&#151;was to make his major contribution to the Chinese church as an author, translator, and preacher. A powerful and eloquent speaker, he was immensely popular with the Chinese, who would gather in great numbers to hear him preach, and he was notably successful in training and mentoring numerous Chinese evangelists.<br>
<br>John was a prolific pamphleteer, writing numerous tracts and serving for many years as chairman of the Central China Tract Society. He was founder of the first protestant church in inland central China (in Wei-kya-wan), and is credited with a Mandarin translation of the <span class="roman">New Testament</span>, <span class="roman">Psalms</span>, and <span class="roman">Proverbs</span>, as well as a Wenli <span class="roman">New Testament</span>, published in 1885. Nominated as chair of the Congregational Union of England and Wales for 1889, he declined the honour, electing to remain in Hangchow. It was also in 1889 that the University of Edinburgh conferred on him the degree of DD. John was instrumental in establishing the London Missionary Society's theological college in Hangchow (formally opened on 18 April 1904) for the theological and medical training of Chinese preachers, evangelists, and pastors.<br>
<br>Highly influential within the larger missionary community, initially because of his linguistic and oratorical skills, and later because of his seniority, John took an intense and outspoken interest in the Chinese political affairs of his day. Throughout his lengthy tenure as chaplain to the English community in Hangchow, he was deeply, though not uncritically, sympathetic to British interests in China. He was not averse to calling upon European gunboats for protection on occasion, and he was highly partisan in his sympathy for the &#145;Christian uprising&#146;, better known as the Taiping uprising. He played an active role in advocating the payment of indemnities to missions whose properties were damaged or destroyed in the uprising. Though critical of the opium trade and of other manifestations of unscrupulous commercial exploitation of the Chinese by Europeans, to his dying day John held firmly to the twin convictions that most of China's problems were directly attributable to the ineptitude and self-serving intransigence of its leaders, and that the Chinese masses yearned for freedom from what they perceived as the tyranny and oppression of their rulers.<br>
<br>During a missionary career spanning sixty years, John left China only three times (1870&#150;73, 1880&#150;82, and 1906&#150;7). He finally returned to England in January 1912, and died in London six months later, on 25 July; he was interred in Wales four days later, in Swansea cemetery.<br>
