<span class="headword">Roth,  Mathias</span>  (1818&#150;1891), <span class="occ">homoeopath and exercise therapist</span>, was born in Kaschau (Ko&#353;ice), in the Habsburg empire, the posthumous and fourth surviving child of M&aacute;ty&aacute;s Roth (<i>d</i>. 1818), a merchant, and his wife, Anna Schwarz (<i>d</i>. 1877), who ran a kosher restaurant. Educated in his home town and in Vienna, Roth obtained a medical degree by examination in Pavia in 1839. From 1840 he practised as a homoeopath and hydropath in Kaschau. As a supporter of the unsuccessful Hungarian revolt against the Habsburgs he had to flee the country, and he arrived in London in October 1849. He became friends with homoeopaths R. E. Dudgeon and M. J. Chapman, and in 1850 he was one of the founding members of the short-lived Hahnemann Hospital and Hahnemann Medical Society.<br>
<br>In 1851 Roth established a private practice in London at 16<span class="smallcap">A</span> Old Cavendish Street; he later moved to 48 Wimpole Street. In 1852 he married Anna Maria (<i>d</i>. 1907), daughter of a civil servant, William Collins. Roth was Jewish but not religious, and the wedding took place in the Marylebone register office, both witnesses being fellow Hungarian refugees. Seven sons and two daughters were born to the couple. Four became medical doctors themselves, and the oldest, Bernard Roth FRCS (1852&#150;1915), eventually took over his father's practice.<br>
<br>Swedish gymnastics, originally developed by P. H. Ling, became Roth's principal curative method. In his Institution for the Cure of Disease by Swedish Gymnastics, to which he also added the Institute for Russian Baths, he treated various physical deformities, paralytic afflictions, and some chronic diseases with therapeutic exercise. Roth later opened another institution at 21 Gloucester Place in Brighton and employed assistants who held exercise classes for the healthy and able-bodied as well. For many years he divided his time between London and Brighton, commuting every other day.<br>
<br>Roth regarded the promotion of Swedish gymnastics as part of the sanitary movement. In 1851 he published <span class="italic">The Prevention and Cure of many Chronic Diseases by Movements</span>, a 302-page treatise on the philosophical, physiological, and medical foundations of Swedish gymnastics. This book also included a detailed, illustrated description of exercises for use in schools. The latter part was reprinted several times. Roth also published many journal articles on educational and therapeutic exercise and gave free lectures to housewives, teachers, college students, and army officers. Roth exhibited models of gymnastic positions at the 1862 International Exhibition in London &#145;for educational, sanitary, and military purposes as well as for the development of the blind, deaf, and dumb&#146;  (<span class="italic">Illustrated Catalogue of the Industrial Department, British Division</span>, 2.68&#150;9). These were shown again at the 1867 Universal Exhibition in Paris; and also in 1884 at the International Health Exhibition in London, with additional aids such as adjustable school benches, improved clothes for infants, rational and irrational fashionable boots, and digitized socks.<br>
<br>Roth developed the concept of scientific physical education, advocating the teaching of physiology, hygiene, and Swedish educational gymnastics. He campaigned tirelessly for the introduction of scientific physical education into the school curriculum. To this end he published three pamphlets: <span class="italic">A letter to the Rt. Hon. the earl of Granville &hellip; on the importance of rational gymnastics as a branch of national education</span> (1854); <span class="italic">A plea for the compulsory teaching of the elements of physical education in our national elementary schools</span> (1870); and <span class="italic">On the neglect of physical education &amp; hygiene by parliament &amp; the educational department &hellip;</span> (1879). Partial success came in 1878 when the London school board appointed a Swedish woman gymnast to train physical education teachers for girls' schools.<br>
<br>Roth considered that ill health and high infant mortality were due mainly to ignorance and to lack of exercise. For this he blamed the negligence of the authorities who did not listen to his admonishments. To help improve the health of the nation, in 1856 he suggested the establishment of the Ladies' Sanitary Association. This society, supported by the wives of several high-ranking statesmen, was effective in popularizing contemporary ideas on, for example, hygiene, infant management, and nutrition. In 1880 Roth established the Society for the Prevention of Blindness, and in 1886 he was asked to give evidence to the royal commission on the blind, the deaf, and the dumb.<br>
<br>Roth's medical qualifications enabled him to be registered in 1859 as a medical practitioner, yet as a naturalized foreigner and homoeopath he did not become part of the medical establishment. His aggressive style and constant reference to European medical authorities were not welcome, especially when he visited workhouses and ragged schools and reported on their poor sanitary conditions. However, Roth was well regarded in homoeopathic circles. He became a fellow of the British Homoeopathic Society in 1884 and its president for 1886&#150;7. He published widely in homoeopathic journals on a variety of topics. He was critical of what he considered unscientific methods of homoeopathy but kept an open mind towards newly promoted remedies such as electricity and hypnosis. He never failed to send scientific reports about the spas he visited during his holidays abroad. Roth was always an active participant at the congresses of the National Association for the Promotion of Social Science and at national and international congresses on homoeopathy, and on hygiene.<br>
<br>Financial success enabled Roth to acquire a villa in Divonne-les-Bains, France. He retired there in 1888, though he returned to London for the 1891 International Congress on Hygiene and Demography. In October 1891 Roth fatally scalded himself while taking a vapour bath in the local hydropathic institution; on 20 October he died at his home, Villa Beaujeu, in Divonne-les-Bains. In his will he bequeathed his left arm, thought to be ankylosed owing to excessive bleeding and leeching early in his life, to the pathological museum of University College, London, for the use of medical students. He wished to be cremated for hygienic reasons, and without any religious ceremony. He was survived by his wife.<br>
