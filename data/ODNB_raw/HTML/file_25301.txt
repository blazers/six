</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Sheil,  Richard Lalor</span>  (1791&#150;1851), <span class="occ">playwright and politician</span>, was born on 17 August 1791 at Drumdowney, co. Kilkenny, the eldest of the four sons of Edward Sheil and Catherine McCarthy of Spring House, co. Tipperary. Edward Sheil was one of a burgeoning and successful Irish Catholic mercantile middle class. He purchased an estate and married into a family with aristocratic connections. For his eldest son he planned a professional career. As Richard Sheil later explained, in an autobiographical aside to a parliamentary committee, a Catholic who made money in trade considered it a feather in his own cap if he made his son a barrister, for the bar in Ireland enjoyed more station than in England because of the absence in the former country of persons of real rank. Educated initially by a resident tutor in the person of a refugee French priest, he was then dispatched to a school in Kensington run by French Jesuits settled in England. Its &eacute;migr&eacute; character and the language of much of the instruction ensured that precious little sense of Britishness was inculcated here. However, he was transferred to the intensely English Roman Catholic environment of Stonyhurst College in Lancashire in October 1804. He found a role model among the members of staff&#151;a mind steeped in classical knowledge, with highly polished manners and great eloquence&#151;and was taught to be loyal to the constitution and liberties of Britain despite the religious discrimination to which Catholics were subjected. As much as Sheil resented those remaining disabilities which threatened to restrict the reach of his ambition, he emerged from Stonyhurst not only with an understanding of English Catholic opinion&#151;which was invariably more moderate than Irish&#151;but also well indoctrinated in the glories of the British nation. Hence his later claim that he was &#145;as devoted to the maintenance of the glory, the honour, and the power of this great country&#146; as any native born Englishman  (MacNevin, 202).<h2>
<a name="ThebarmarriageandLondonlife"></a>The bar, marriage, and London life</h2>Admitted to Trinity College, Dublin, in November 1807, Sheil graduated in July 1811 and subsequently kept terms at Lincoln's Inn for the requisite two years before being called to the Irish bar. These years brought the first crisis in his life, when his father was reduced to virtual bankruptcy. He completed his university education with the assistance of a small allowance from a member of his mother's family, and sought to cover the costs of setting up and establishing himself in his profession through playwriting. His interest in literature and drama&#151;first awakened at Stonyhurst&#151;had developed at Trinity. Beginning in 1814, and over a period of a decade, he earned a modest but useful income with a succession of plays, eight in all, which made him something of a favourite of contemporary literary critics. His taste was for sentimentality and horrors, perhaps a reflection of a desire more to dazzle the audience with staging than dramatic content, hence his anxiety to secure Eliza O'Neill (1791&#150;1872), one of the most celebrated actresses of the day, for starring roles. His one enduring success was <span class="italic">Evadne, or, The Statue</span>, which reworked Shirley's <span class="italic">The Traitor</span> (1635) and has been described as an illustration of the nineteenth-century mind at work on Jacobean drama. The heavy emphasis on infidelity and sin is lightened by a resolution which sees a happier triumph of Sheil's heroine than Shirley's. Performed some thirty times at Covent Garden during its first season, it was staged again as late as 1881.<br>
<br>Sheil's choice of a bride in 1816 may have been influenced not merely by her physical attractions but also by her connections. She was the niece of the master of the rolls, William McMahon, who had the ability to promote a legal career. However, Sheil's increasingly conspicuous participation in the agitation for Catholic relief saw him shunned by his wife's cautious relative, who had been born into a Catholic family but conformed to the established church. All the master ever gave him was breakfast, he later joked. Nevertheless, his practice did slowly prosper despite his refusal to give it his full attention. And when, shortly after the birth of his only son on 9 January 1822, his wife died, Sheil found solace not at the bar but in popular literature. He began to publish a series of sketches of his contemporaries in the profession. First appearing in the <span class="italic">New Monthly Magazine</span>, but subsequently expanded to embrace political figures and events, and republished in book form, they were characterized by grace, wit, and generosity. They won a wide and admiring readership and even helped to facilitate a reconciliation with Daniel O'Connell, with whom he clashed over political strategy. Many of the articles, including that on O'Connell, were in fact the work of his friend and collaborator William Henry Curran. But O'Connell assumed, as did most contemporaries, that they all came from Sheil's pen  (<span class="italic">Sketches of the Irish Bar</span>) and was surprised by its tone given the bitter nature of their dispute.<br>
<br>A rigorous training in rhetoric at Stonyhurst, membership of the Trinity College Historical Society, and of the Eccentrics debating club during his terms at Lincoln's Inn, provided Sheil with a firm grounding in public speaking and the confidence to seek to master his natural defects as an orator. Painfully self-conscious about his diminutive size, and struggling always to modulate his high-pitched voice, Sheil quickly concluded that passion was his key to capturing and holding the attention of an audience. He cultivated the arts of the demagogue. He was blessed with &#145;as fine a pair of eyes as ever graced a human head&#151;large, deeply set, dark, liquid, flasing like gems&#146;&#151;which fixed listeners &#145;like a basilisk&#146; and helped them to forget all else about his appearance  (<span class="italic">Blackwood's Magazine</span>, 30 (1831), 411). When he spoke he deliberately sought to sweep his listeners away with passages of poetic beauty, savage satire, and unrestrained emotion. &#145;Sheil possesses in eminent degree the surprising faculty of exciting himself to the verge of delirium without once losing his complete self-possession&#146;, commented a French listener. &#145;I was seduced, I was dazzled, and together with me, the whole assembly&#146;  (McCullagh, <span class="italic">Memoirs of Sheil</span>, 1.310&#150;11). These were the emerging skills he put, while still an undergraduate, at the service of Catholic emancipation, and one of that cause's leading lights admiringly observed that he had seldom seen a youth from college quite so well informed.<h2>
<a name="RelationswithOConnell"></a>Relations with O'Connell</h2>Yet Roman Catholics were far from united, either by rank or in strategy. Those of the highest social rank, together with a more substantial number of professional men and merchants, and English Catholics, were willing to try to facilitate emancipation through concessions to liberal protestant opinion, such as a crown veto over Catholic episcopal appointments. His education at Stonyhurst, his political pragmatism, his rank, his personal desire for full and equal citizenship in the British nation, made Sheil a natural vetoist. This was the issue which eventually brought him into acrimonious conflict with <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20501/', "Daniel O'Connell")</script>, the uncompromising leader of the anti-vetoists. Convinced that an obdurate O'Connell was delaying emancipation, he launched a stinging personal attack on his adversary in 1821. Not that Sheil was a match for O'Connell in the art of personal abuse. The latter savagely ridiculed the younger man's pretensions as a dramatist and style as a speaker. Only with great difficulty were friends able to dissuade Sheil from completing the breach in Catholic ranks by challenging O'Connell to a duel. The two men did combine early in 1822 on an address of welcome to a new viceroy, Richard Wellesley, whose appointment they both unwisely regarded as the harbinger of emancipation, and were formally reconciled at a dinner party on 8 February 1823, at which the decision was taken to reinvigorate the emancipation agitation through the agency of a new Catholic Association.<br>
<br>Sheil's contribution to the successful launch of this powerful instrument of extra-parliamentary popular pressure was widely recognized as second only to that of O'Connell. Suppressing his initial doubts about the mobilization of the lower orders, he loyally supported the decisions to embrace the entire range of peasant grievances and to offer inexpensive associate memberships as means of binding the masses more closely to the cause while filling association coffers. He tirelessly toured the provinces delivering inspirational harangues, and was paired with O'Connell in the deputation dispatched to London early in 1825 in an unavailing effort to defend the association from suppression and advance emancipation. They testified before parliamentary committees, with Sheil developing the familiar themes of a justice system blighted by aristocratic and religious bias. Further, he avowed that removal of the impediments to advancement in his profession would lead him to retire from politics. It may have been this assurance which prompted O'Connell privately to describe his examination as &#145;most comical&#146;. Sheil also renounced his support of the veto, insisted that emancipation would remove priests from politics and that Roman Catholics would accept higher franchise qualifications in return for relief, and declared that those who still qualified as voters would not show a partiality in elections for their fellow religionists. However, the impact of his evidence was lessened by his interrogators' scepticism that the lower orders would long be content with a measure which directly benefited only their betters. Similarly, his credibility was damaged by his past demagogic excesses.<br>
<br>Bitterly disappointed by the failure of emancipation to soar even with a pair of protestant &#145;wings&#146;, Sheil was in the vanguard of the new association and its more aggressive politicization of the enfranchised lower orders. Like O'Connell, he publicly expressed regret for his earlier willingness to sacrifice their voting rights on the altar of relief. He also retreated from his earlier opposition to any concession of a special position to priests in the struggle for emancipation. They clearly had a vital role to play in the staging of freeholder uprisings against landlord electoral domination. He played his part in the limited uprising of 1826, which to his mind amounted to a political revolution because the people had at last been taught to know their rights. Sheil it was who interested the French press in the Irish problem, much to the embarrassment of the government, and he proposed a series of imaginative measures, such as a Catholic census and simultaneous parish meetings, to re-emphasize the numerical supremacy of Catholics in Ireland and their wholehearted commitment to the cause. Indeed, he consistently encouraged his fellow religionists to recognize the power their number gave them to intimidate and extract concessions without a resort to violence. And when O'Connell made the fateful decision to contest the by-election in County Clare in 1828, Sheil served as his counsel and campaigned on his behalf.<h2>
<a name="SheilasMP"></a>Sheil as MP</h2>Sheil's personal ambition following emancipation in 1829 was to make the difficult transition from agitator to politician, and even to statesman. He was assisted by his marriage on 20 July 1830 to Anastasia Power (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Lalor), a wealthy widow, for he was at last ensured of financial security. But his years of demagoguery, and not least a pitiless attack on the character of the duke of York in 1826, had made him powerful enemies. Indeed, he had been saved from prosecution in 1827 only by the formation of the brief Canning administration. A proposal originating with a viceroy that he be put into parliament was resisted by prime minister Wellington, even though many tories were keen to exploit the differences which were re-emerging between Sheil and O'Connell over the latter's turning to the issue of repeal of the union: Sheil was still willing to reconcile himself to the status of a west Briton. He was called to the inner bar in 1830, while O'Connell continued to be denied a silk gown and was left to fume at this studied insult. Sheil did dicker with the tories for a parliamentary seat, but remained unacceptable to Wellington, whose distrust of him extended to the issue of parliamentary reform. The formation of a whig government in 1830 appeared to enhance his prospects, for even those leading lights who visited Ireland and left scornful of its people and scenery were impressed with Sheil. Moreover, he proffered his services as a parliamentary counterweight to O'Connell. Indeed, the Liberator's suspicion that Sheil was provided with a seat for the purpose of &#145;abusing&#146; him was not entirely unfounded. Temporarily accommodated with the rotten borough of Milbourne Port, Sheil entered the Commons on 8 March 1831. The dissolution two months later saw him returned for co. Louth, having unsuccessfully contested it in 1830, but this time he had the backing of the viceroy's extensive local interest. Nevertheless, disillusionment with whig policy in Ireland, a visceral dislike of Edward Stanley, the Conservative chief secretary, and the apparent unwillingness of ministers to reward him with office, led him to make his peace with O'Connell and secure election for co. Tipperary as a repealer in 1833. This prompted accusations that he was a mere &#145;mercenary&#146; whose loyalty could only be purchased with favours, and his reputation was further sullied early in 1834 when he found himself at the centre of an ugly controversy over the English complaint that Irish members were &#145;perfect swindlers&#146; who privately supported legislation which publicly they opposed. He weathered the crisis with the staunch support of O'Connell, and warmly advocated the latter's informal arrangement with the whigs which restored them to office under Melbourne in 1835, following a brief tory hiatus.<br>
<br>Sheil rebuilt his parliamentary career and reputation on the strength of his oratory. Careful not to speak too often and coldly calculating in the timing of his interventions, he devoted days to the preparation of his speeches and on occasion took rooms so as to be able to rehearse at full volume. He was equally careful to ensure their publication, making an arrangement with the <span class="italic">Morning Chronicle</span> in 1835. Alternately employing the stiletto of irony and the cudgel of sarcasm, he made repeated appeals for religious and political equality in Ireland, though even to sympathetic listeners he appeared to undervalue the importance of social grievances as sources of discontent; he memorably castigated the former, and future, tory lord chancellor, Lyndhurst, for his offensive dismissal of the Irish as aliens in blood, language, and religion; eloquently defended the whig commitment to conciliation of Ireland, as distinct from tory coercion; evoked the historic memory of centuries of misgovernment to explain Irish lawlessness; and distanced himself from O'Connell's resurrection during the late 1830s of repeal. All of this time he was assiduously pursuing office. In 1836 he requested the vice-treasurership of Ireland, only now to learn of the insuperable opposition of William IV who had neither forgotten nor forgiven the attack a decade earlier on his brother. In 1838, following the accession of Victoria, he received a demeaning offer of the clerkship of the ordnance, which he naturally declined. He did subsequently accept the commissionership of Greenwich Hospital. Senior whigs objected to a more senior post because of his commitment to the (secret) ballot, which he believed would provide Irish tenants with greater protection from the political tyranny of landlords. Not that he was long content, and within a few months he was soliciting closer connection with the government on the grounds that this alone could help him justify to his constituents his refusal to stand with O'Connell. In 1839 he sought the vacant vice-presidency of the Board of Trade, explaining beseechingly that his &#145;great object&#146; was to hold such an office if only for a short period. A fragile ministry desperate to bolster its support in the Commons duly appeased him. And when Melbourne undertook a last minute reconstruction of his government in 1841, he finally appointed Sheil to the position he had long sought, that of judge advocate. Melbourne's earlier objection to this promotion had been the fact that it would give an Irish Roman Catholic and an &#145;agitator&#146; frequent access to the queen as well as control of the discipline of the army. However, now asked whether the appointment would be disliked, she surprisingly replied that she would not object because she had a &#145;high opinion&#146; of Sheil.<br>
<br>The 1841 general election, a tory triumph, found Sheil sitting for the less taxing constituency of Dungarvan. Throughout the Peel administration he continued to make his mark as a trenchant critic of the government. At the same time, he spoke as one of a handful of Irish Liberal Unionists who continued to urge the conciliation of their native land as an alternative to O'Connell's ever more popular demand for repeal. Nevertheless, perhaps to retain his credibility in Ireland, he served in 1844 as counsel to one of the traversers, John O'Connell, in the trials which followed the suppression of the monster repeal meetings. In a long and powerful opening address, whose wide publicity he had thoughtfully arranged before leaving London, he restated his conviction that Ireland's grievances were rooted in the colonial attitude of Britain. &#145;The union has never been carried into effect&#146;, he protested, having long since warned that to draw &#145;odious distinctions&#146; between England and Ireland, to insist that they required different laws, was to provide repealers with a more &#145;plausible pretence&#146; that they also required different lawgivers  (MacNevin, 291). The year 1845 was largely devoted to desperate attempts to halt the deterioration in the health of his son, only for him to die on the island of Madeira in November. Sheil was on hand the following spring, however, to participate in the ousting of Peel and receive a reward. He was appointed master of the Royal Mint, which he flattered himself was an office just below cabinet rank. The last politician to occupy the position, but the first Roman Catholic to be sworn a member of the privy council since the reign of James II, it fell to him to announce the government's compromise with the demands for decimalization by minting a florin at one-tenth of a pound. Unfortunately, the omission of the traditional Latin contractions for &#145;By grace of God defender of the faith&#146; from the side bearing the queen's image was regarded in some quarters as a sinister manifestation of the master's religion. Instead, the simplified inscription had been suggested by Prince Albert, but Sheil was obliged to apologize for the change, which was corrected on the second issue of the coin in 1851. He was more successful in the appointment in February 1848 of a royal commission, with himself in the chair, to examine the structure and expenses of the mint, but resigned the mastership before any of its recommendations could be implemented.<br>
<br>During these years Sheil spoke infrequently, and rarely at length, in the house. He did pay a short tribute to O'Connell following the Liberator's death in May 1847 and took this opportunity briefly to discuss the famine. He denied that it was merely a provincial problem, acknowledged that some men had permitted &#145;national kindness&#146; to be overcome &#145;by their austere political economy&#146; and observed that Britain would happily spend a fortune on a war. Irish gratitude for assistance, he added, would be commensurate with English generosity  (<span class="italic">Hansard 3</span>, 93.1013&#150;16).<h2>
<a name="Finalyears"></a>Final years</h2>By 1850 Sheil was anxious to retire from the political fray, having long suffered painfully from gout and having become alarmingly dependent on an opiate which friends feared was far from safe. Further, the &#145;infamous ingratitude of this vile populace&#146; made his return for Dungarvan increasingly problematic  (Sheil to Hope, 6 Aug 1847, NL Ire., Wyse MS 15026). In 1848 Russell had seriously considered dispatching him to Greece as minister there. On 4 November 1850 he did nominate him minister to Tuscany. The allure of Italy was its history and gentler climate, while Florence had been the scene of Shirley's play which had been the basis of his greatest success as a dramatist. However, in departing a Britain convulsed by a frenzy of anti-Catholicism released by the pope's announcement of the restoration of a Catholic hierarchy in England, and Russell's unfortunate Durham letter, Sheil entertained hopes of being the instrument of reconciliation between faith and nation, hence his determined assertion of his authority over the resident British agent in Rome. But he was denied the time in which to achieve anything of substance. He arrived in Florence on 26 January 1851 and died suddenly, probably of a heart attack, on the morning of Sunday 25 May, only two days after he and his wife received the tragic news of her son's death in Ireland. Following an impressive funeral at the church of San Michelino, attended by Tuscan ministers and the entire diplomatic corps, Mrs Sheil requested as a final mark of respect that the body be transported home to Ireland aboard a naval vessel. Only after much dithering was this done. Sheil's remains were delivered to Dublin on 24 February 1852, and interred at his home, Long Orchard, co. Tipperary.<br>
<br>If Sheil's career, and life, expired in the relative diplomatic obscurity of the Tuscany mission, this was a fate he had invited. Indeed, the sense of anticlimax had long been palpable. His fame had been won at a very young age, first as a dramatist and then as a demagogue. Yet few of his plays had enjoyed more than transitory success, and his reputation as a dramatist was to suffer because of their lack of realism. His powers of speech did see him make the transition from agitator to orator. Giants on the parliamentary stage, such as Gladstone and Disraeli, singled him out for praise, yet within two generations of his death Justin McCarthy could write that he was nothing more than an orator, that he had failed to leave a mark on parliament or politics and had allowed his career to fade away into &#145;second class ministerial office&#146;. There is a large measure of truth in the last accusation. Nevertheless, Lecky did embrace him as one of the <span class="italic">Leaders of Public Opinion in Ireland</span> and acknowledged that his speeches met Burke's test of perfect oratory&#151;&#145;half poetry, half prose&#146;&#151;but was critical of the profusion of ornaments and the paucity of spontaneity. There have been modern echoes of this criticism, with both his literary style and his public speaking dismissed as &#145;stilted&#146;.<br>
<br>Such cavils do less than justice to Sheil. Fashions in oratory inevitably change over time, but in his day Sheil captivated members of parliament just as earlier he had swept away throngs of Irishmen. Moreover, there was a consistent and modernist theme to his many well-constructed and carefully crafted speeches on Ireland. He argued that inequalities&#151;economic, social, sectarian, and political&#151;were breeders of discontent and violence. &#145;If something not be done by those who ought to derive a warning from the past&#146;, he repeatedly cautioned, if they<blockquote>do not in time adopt the measures requisite to correct abuses proved and indisputable, the next requisition for change, which shall be made, perhaps by an excited people, will be far more formidable than that which we propose, and may lead to consequences by which the worst prognostications may be realized. (MacNevin, 254)</blockquote>He voiced the fear that &#145;the spirit of eminence and masterdom&#146; was &#145;so fixedly settled&#146; in the English that they could never bring themselves to regard Irishmen as their equals  (<span class="italic">Hansard 3</span>, 87.1013).<br>
<br>That Sheil placed the greatest emphasis on existing political inequalities reflected his personal ambition for advancement and desire for full integration within the United Kingdom. No doubt his political reputation has suffered because he was found, eventually, on the wrong side of history. Persuaded that repeal was a dead end, he accepted the status of a west Briton. Unlike O'Connell, he never spoke of his &#145;hatred&#146; of Britain. However, he has received his due from modern historians of Catholic emancipation. His alliance with O'Connell has been described as &#145;absolutely crucial&#146; to the successful launching of the Catholic Association  (O'Ferrall, 31); James Reynolds has pointed out that the two men shared national popularity, while the Liberator's most recent biographer has acknowledged him as &#145;the foremost observer and delineator of the immediate in the Association&#146;  (Macdonagh, <span class="italic">The Hereditary Bondsman</span>, 244).<br>
