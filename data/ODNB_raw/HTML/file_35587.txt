<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Pound, Sir  (Alfred) Dudley Pickman Rogers</span>  (1877&#150;1943), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, was born on 29 August 1877 at Park View, Wroxall, Isle of Wight, the eldest child of Alfred John Pound, barrister, and his wife, Elizabeth Pickman, daughter of Richard Saltonstall Rogers of Boston, Massachusetts. Pound received most of his early education at Fonthill School in East Grinstead. In his youth he enjoyed riding and fishing, and had enough family connections to receive an offer from an uncle to find a place for him in the firm of Pierpont Morgan. But close proximity to the sea and the lure of a more glamorous career proved a stronger call. In January 1891 Pound entered the training ship <i>Britannia</i> as a cadet, embarking on a lifelong career as a naval officer.<h2>
<a name="Earlycareer"></a>Early career</h2>Varied service, ranging from China to the channel, from the training squadron under sail to specialization as a torpedo officer and service at the Admiralty, led to promotion to commander at the age of thirty-two in June 1909. Along the way Pound made useful friendships as he expanded his range of experience. His next notable appointment was as instructor at the new Naval Staff College in 1913, where he first encountered a most important factor in his advancement: fate. By accepting an offer from William Fisher to become his commander in the battleship <i>St Vincent</i>, Pound found himself at sea under a useful patron when the First World War broke out. Promoted captain in December 1914, he served at the Admiralty in the first half of 1915 as second naval assistant to the first sea lord, the pugnacious &#145;Jackie&#146; Fisher. Pound thus saw at first hand the titanic struggle between his masters, as Fisher squared off with the first lord, Winston Churchill, in a battle that saw both men ousted from office. Pound surely drew some conclusions about how not to handle ministers, in particular Churchill, which years later he would find useful.<br>
<br>Later that year Pound returned to sea as flag captain of the Grand Fleet, in the battleship <i>Colossus</i>. In that vessel he fought in the battle of Jutland on 31 May 1916, being commended for his service that day. Then in 1917 fate again brought Pound back to the fast track with an appointment that marked him out for future high command. He was selected to launch what became in due course the plans division of the Admiralty, charged with foreseeing and thinking out operations and problems that the navy might have to face. This was the first such division dedicated to this important task, a major step in the modernization of the navy, and it was a feather in Pound's cap to secure the billet. He soon moved on, at the end of 1917, to be director of operations (home), where he ended what was for him personally a very good war.<br>
<br>Pound's subsequent peacetime career followed the pattern laid down for those being considered for the very top positions in the navy, a mixture of staff, shore, and sea appointments. In 1920 he took command of the battle cruiser <i>Repulse</i>. In 1922 he returned to the Admiralty as director of the plans division. In 1925 he was named chief of staff to Lord Keyes, who was now the commander-in-chief, Mediterranean Fleet; in that appointment Pound was promoted to flag rank in March 1926. He then spent two more years in the Admiralty as assistant chief of naval staff from 1927 to 1929. He returned to sea in May 1929 to command the battle-cruiser squadron of the Atlantic Fleet. Detached service as a naval representative to the ill-fated general conference on disarmament in 1932 helped bring Pound back to the Admiralty in August of that year as second sea lord. He was appointed KCB in 1933.<br>
<br>This mix of appointments in a dozen years gave Pound both the sea time he needed to round out his qualifications for high command and staff appointments that brought him in touch with all the great naval and international issues of the time: the naval limitation negotiations, naval aviation, imperial defence, the future of capital ships, to name a few. He succeeded well enough all around to be nominated in September 1935 for one of the two most coveted commands in the service, as commander-in-chief, Mediterranean Fleet.<br>
<br>The Dudley Pound who accepted this attractive appointment was by now a seasoned 58-year-old full admiral, a character and personality developed through forty-five years of service. The most marked feature of that character was Pound's total dedication to the navy. In 1908 he had married Bessie Caroline Grace (<i>d</i>. 1943), daughter of John Livesay Whitehead, a physician from Ventnor, Isle of Wight. Their married life was apparently happy but little is known of it; references to his wife note how much she helped him and the service but little else. They had a daughter and two sons, the older of whom followed his father into the Royal Navy, while the younger took a commission in the Royal Marines. Pound continued to enjoy fishing and now also shooting, but as he rose in rank and responsibility took less and less time off to indulge these interests. The picture seems clear: for this man, the navy was his life. In that service he was seen as sharp but not brilliant, an indefatigable worker, a good listener, a driver rather than a delegator, and above all utterly loyal to his superiors. He had an immense capacity for work and revelled in carrying out in hands-on fashion even the myriad duties of higher appointments. Personally, colleagues found him serious, reserved, not hard to work with but difficult to befriend. Subordinates respected rather than idolized him, many remembering the care he took to look after their interests, enquire after their families, and nurture their careers. Pound seems to have had limited social graces and narrow intellectual horizons. His sense of fun, such as it was, emerged in his other passion: driving automobiles at breakneck speed, especially with a passenger aboard to be suitably unnerved. The image that emerges is of a thorough but narrow professional, entering the service too young and throwing himself into it too completely to develop a fully rounded character.<br>
<br>It would be quite wrong to see Pound as personally ambitious. For all his faults, he consistently put the service before himself. That was made clear when he offered to delay his appointment to the Mediterranean command in order not to disrupt the fleet; the change of command coincided with the onset of the international crisis provoked by Italy's attack on Ethiopia. Pound acted as chief of staff to Fisher until finally assuming command in March 1936, a situation which must have had awkward moments with two full admirals on the scene but had no apparent repercussions. Pound gave further evidence that personal ambition did not consume him when in 1938 he calmly received the news that he was not seen as a probable first sea lord. Given a choice, he opted to take the offer of a one-year extension in command in the Mediterranean, followed by retirement, rather than a transfer to one of the home port commands for a final three years. As commander-in-chief, Mediterranean, Pound enjoyed perhaps his happiest years in the navy, relentlessly training his fleet for war by leading from the bridge as much as possible. When the fleet was handed over to the command of Andrew Browne Cunningham, he noted that it was &#145;in great fettle and obviously in a high state of efficiency&#146;  (Cunningham, 207). It was left to Cunningham to take this fleet to war while fate, in one last twist, brought Pound to the summit of his service after all.<h2>
<a name="Firstsealord"></a>First sea lord</h2>A succession of untimely deaths and disabilities left Pound the only possible choice for an appointment the navy had not intended him to assume. Concerns about his physical fitness, his perceived inability to see different sides to a question, and his tendency to take too much into his own hands all had to be set aside when he emerged as the only senior admiral with the range and depth of experience to become the professional head of the service. Pound took office as first sea lord and chief of the naval staff in June 1939, being promoted to admiral of the fleet the next month. Within two months events forced him to lead the navy into the Second World War. The rest of his life was taken up by the demanding job which made him a figure of historical significance, directing the senior service in a global total war which stretched it beyond its strength almost from the start.<br>
<br>Pound was <i>ex officio</i> a major figure in the central direction of the war as a member of the chiefs of staff committee. It is also fair to say that the strain upon him was greater than that on his army and air force counterparts, for two reasons. First, the war at sea knew no boundaries and only from the centre could it be co-ordinated, the Admiralty acting as an operational headquarters and intervening directly in battle by issuing orders to fleets at sea. Second, geography pushed the Royal Navy to the forefront of both the defence of the home islands and any attempt to carry the war to the enemy. In these circumstances anyone holding Pound's appointment would have become a controversial figure in history. For most of his tenure the allies seemed to be losing the war. As professional head of the navy he had to take or be involved in decisions which many feel aggravated rather than reversed that trend; this plus his own personality and deportment made Pound a uniquely controversial first sea lord. Three themes dominated his direction of the navy in total war: his role in British grand strategy, his role in the conduct of fleet operations, and his working relationship with Churchill.<br>
<br>As a maker of grand strategy it cannot be said that Pound ever developed a broad outlook or mastered the challenge of seeing problems from other than a naval perspective. On the other hand, he understood that the maritime war must be related to a co-ordinated grand strategy. Colleagues from other services noted, sometimes in exasperation, how stolidly Pound argued any naval brief and how completely prepared he was to weigh in with the naval perspective on any broader issue. Yet his own subordinates sometimes became frustrated at the first sea lord's insistence on reaching a consensus among the chiefs of staff, even at times by making compromises the naval staff considered uncomfortable. But not even his fiercest critics ever denied that he saw from the start the foundation of the maritime dimension of grand strategy: in Pound's own words, &#145;if we lose the Battle of the Atlantic we lose the war&#146;  (Barnett, 460). The struggle to secure the lifeline by which alone the United Kingdom could be maintained, and any great counter-offensive prepared, never strayed from the centre of his efforts to contribute to the central direction of the war.<br>
<br>The degree to which Pound contributed to a war-winning grand strategy remains a complicated question. The major complication was the relative weakness of the Royal Navy, indeed of British empire forces in general, after the defeat of France in June 1940. Forced now to cope with an expanded surface and submarine threat in the Atlantic, the imminent threat of invasion of the homeland, a new war in the Mediterranean, and possible trouble in the Far East, Pound became markedly cautious. He had to be persuaded to drop a call to abandon the eastern Mediterranean, which secured the Suez Canal and the vital oil supplies of the Middle East, before any direct threat even materialized. Despite his emphasis on the battle of the Atlantic, Pound for too long did not do all he might have done to master that struggle. Not until November 1942 did he appoint a really first-rate commander&#151;Admiral Sir Max Horton&#151;to take charge of the pivotal convoy struggle. Above all he allowed the all-important struggle to secure more effective support from the Royal Air Force to drag on so long as to threaten the whole war effort.<h2>
<a name="Burdensofleadership"></a>Burdens of leadership</h2>Nevertheless Pound won the confidence, respect, and even friendship of his chiefs of staff colleagues, and was generous enough to make way as chairman of the committee when it became clear the chief of the Imperial General Staff, Alan Brooke, would be more effective. Yet that in itself also indicated that Pound could not translate his understanding of the need to work together into anything more helpful than an ever more defensive emphasis on naval problems. Nor did Pound prove very successful in helping to direct global coalition warfare when the entry of the United States into the war led to the formation of the combined chiefs of staff. He did not really win the confidence of his American opposite number, Admiral Ernest J. King&#151;admittedly a difficult task for any British naval officer&#151;and the combined efforts of the two navies to secure a determined commitment to the Atlantic convoy battle as a priority in grand strategy suffered as a result. Not until early 1943 did the battle at last receive the definitive priority, and the air support, that it required. But the most frequent criticism of Pound as grand strategist is that he was too much the navy man, while his most dangerous failure was to take too long to secure full national commitment to the navy's most vital campaign. As a result, only one conclusion seems fair: as a grand strategist, Pound was barely adequate.<br>
<br>One important mitigating factor was the fact that Pound had the heaviest burden to carry among the chiefs of staff. The tension between fleet commanders at sea wanting to run their own show and a first sea lord at home feeling the responsibility on his shoulders and wanting to play a direct role in operations was nothing new. It was almost assumed wisdom in the Royal Navy that seniority conferred greater insight as well as authority, and only the Admiralty could see the &#145;full picture&#146;. The fact that Pound and the Admiralty often enjoyed the advantage of more reliable information, provided especially by signals intelligence, only reinforced this assumption. On occasion it was not unjustified, as for example during the hunt for the German battleship <i>Bismarck</i>. But there seems little doubt that Pound was predisposed, by personality as well as naval tradition, to take too much into his own hands. One critic went as far as to argue that he &#145;ran the Navy as if he were the executive officer of a ship&#146;  (Barnett, 732).<br>
<br>Pound's style in running the Admiralty displayed his strengths and weaknesses. He commanded the respect of his subordinates and helped train his wartime staff to a high level of efficiency; if anything he became too comfortable with them, and was reluctant to suffer changes in his entourage. Nor did he ever shirk from taking personal responsibility for Admiralty decisions great or small, regardless of what advice he received. But it must be said that his inability to delegate was a serious mistake, given the sheer scope and strain of his responsibilities. He blocked the appointment of a deputy chief of the naval staff until July 1942, too long for his stamina to hold up against the strain of the job. His principal fleet commanders respected the frankness with which he discussed matters with them and enjoyed generally satisfactory personal relations with him, but came for the most part to resent what they regarded as his undue and unwise interference in fleet operations.<br>
<br>As a fighting admiral Pound reflected the conventional wisdom of the navy and adjusted to the lessons of war with reasonable promptness. He entered the war still focused on the dominance of the capital ship and the big gun, paying not enough attention to air weapons and the submarine. But his confidence in the ability of surface vessels to defend themselves against aircraft did not survive the Norway campaign of spring 1940. By 1941 the first sea lord was at least rating the need for stronger antisubmarine forces as of equal importance to maintaining the battlefleet. And only one direct intervention by Pound in an ongoing operation at sea can really be argued to have led to avoidable disaster. The decision to scatter convoy PQ17 in July 1942 on the basis of negative intelligence&#151;the fear that the battleship <i>Tirpitz</i> might be at sea on its trail in the absence of confirmation by signals intelligence that it was not&#151;did indeed show Pound at his worst. He never really grasped the limitations of signals intelligence nor how best to apply it, made up his mind too rigidly and readily in the face of conflicting advice, and overruled the commander on the spot without adequate justification. But other heavy defeats suffered by the Royal Navy were not directly attributable to intervention by the first sea lord. The sinking of the <i>Hood</i> hit all as a shock, the decision to send force Z to Singapore was taken over Pound's fierce opposition, and the heavy losses suffered by the Mediterranean Fleet in 1941 did not result from Admiralty intervention. The broadly critical reception of Pound as operations supervisor stemmed more from the general pattern of his behaviour than any specific cases, from the manner of his day-to-day handling of fleet operations and orders from the top which taken in sum unsettled the fleet. Perhaps the single most important cause of this perception was the problem that amounted to Pound's most important challenge and heavily affected all his other tasks: his working relationship with Churchill.<h2>
<a name="HandlingChurchill"></a>Handling Churchill</h2>Pound had to answer to the most self-confident and interventionist political master any first sea lord has ever worked for. Churchill worked hard to maintain control of the broad direction of grand strategy in his own hands, and constantly involved himself in fleet operations even to the point of issuing orders and instructions personally to fleet commanders. The struggle to help harness the positive energy of this human dynamo yet prevent him from making impulsive decisions that might lead to disaster, or meddling in operations to the point where the fleet had no idea to whom it answered nor confidence in its direction, may have been Pound's greatest contribution to victory. Yet it is in his pattern of &#145;handling&#146; Churchill that many at the time and since found the cause of Pound's most serious errors.<br>
<br>In general Pound's approach to handling Churchill was never to oppose any idea or suggestion directly unless there was absolutely no other choice. Unwise proposals would be sent to an irritated and overworked staff to be examined thoroughly, while the first sea lord carried on a slow lobby of suggestion to lead his master back to safer ground. Pound tried to strike a balance, to let Churchill vent his frustration on matters not vital, to shield subordinates as much as possible without provoking an open dispute with the prime minister, and to keep control of the maritime war yet retain the confidence of his mercurial boss. This led to subordinates such as Cunningham and James Somerville being shaken in their faith in Pound when they were badgered by unfair telegrams from the top, and there were whispers that sometimes Pound let his personal feelings get in the way when he allowed someone to be damaged by prime ministerial wrath. But Pound never allowed Churchill to remove someone in whom he had confidence, and usually prevented him from changing strategy when he disagreed.<br>
<br>On some crucial matters Pound did fall short. Force Z went east despite his determined opposition to sending out a force too important to lose but too weak to hold off the Japanese. And the effort to secure consistent and sufficient priority for the Atlantic struggle dragged on in part because he was reluctant to push matters to the point of an open breach. This has to be seen as a judgement call. Pound saw the weapon of a threat to resign as an act of desperation, dangerously close to the abandonment of duty, and indeed it was not to be bandied about lightly amid total war. He also realized that whatever his faults no one else could lead the war with the same fire and resolve as Churchill. Yet critics on both sides have not been fair to Pound on this issue. It was the very manner of Pound's handling of Churchill that provoked the controversy, some inevitably seeing it as, on balance, too compliant. Only on the Atlantic issue does this seem right. When Pound finally did make the ultimate threat, very quietly, in October 1942, results soon followed. But he received little credit for this from a navy already convinced he had allowed Churchill to bully it for too long. To balance this, Pound deserves credit for restraining Churchill as much as he did while retaining his confidence as well as he did.<br>
<br>Working with Churchill no doubt aggravated the final controversy surrounding Pound, his fitness for the demanding job fate thrust upon him. This arose because of his increasingly obvious fatigue as the war went on, and behaviour that suggested his powers were fading. He suffered from osteoarthritis, a painful condition which must have sapped his energy. Though medically certified fit to assume his appointment in 1939, he rarely took time off for real relaxation. Pound's tendency to put his head down and appear to be asleep in meetings became more pronounced from 1941. His defenders argue that this was in fact a way of concentrating, and insist that whenever any issue bearing on the navy came up, the first sea lord became fully alert and intervened in the discussion. Yet at best this would confirm the argument that Pound's participation in the central direction of the war was too narrow; at worst it spread the belief that he could not bear the strain.<h2>
<a name="Lastmonths"></a>Last months</h2>The death of his wife in July 1943 hit Pound very hard. But the condition that finally killed him was malignant glioma, a slowly developing brain tumour. Pound suffered a stroke in early September and was forced to tell Churchill on 8 September that he was no longer fit to serve. It is not possible to be definitive about whether this was the case. Supporters who argue that Pound remained fit until near the end are offset by critics who insist he was unfit long before. Whatever evidence he himself might have left went up in smoke when his personal papers were destroyed by burning, shortly after the war, by his fellow admirals Cunningham and Geoffrey Blake&#151;possibly to conform with another naval tradition.<br>
<br>Death came for Pound in the Royal Masonic Hospital, Ravenscourt Park, London, on 21 October 1943, Trafalgar day&#151;surely a last and most appropriate intervention by fate for this most devoted servant of the Royal Navy&#151;and he was buried at sea on 27 October. He refused the late offer of a peerage, further testimony to lack of personal ambition, and died with the tide of war having truly turned. But as it was his lot to guide the navy during the difficult years of overstretch, so it has remained his fate to be a controversial figure among historians. The burning of his papers ruled out a definitive biography and made it more difficult to weigh Pound's role in the controversies of his career. Yet the mass of documentation surrounding any first sea lord has produced a long debate on Pound's life and career. The forgiving reception accorded by the post-war generation, which stressed his part in laying the foundations for victory, has now become a more critical discourse&#151;should it have taken so long to win and at such cost, were serious errors made, and if so why? Assessments have ranged from calling Pound one of the weakest professional heads of the navy ever to lead the service in war to the claim that he did a more than adequate job when it fell to him. The most balanced view seems to be that for better or worse he was a product of the service to which he gave his life. The navy certainly could have benefited from stronger leadership at the top, but Pound was not a failure. He helped both to build a navy able to contribute to victory and to make sure no irreversible blunder was ever made. Pound's wartime successes and failures were those of the navy he led; he and it were inseparable.<br>
