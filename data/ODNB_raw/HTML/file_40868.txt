<span class="headword">O'Flaherty,  Liam</span>  (1896&#150;1984), <span class="occ">novelist and short-story writer</span>, was born on 28 August 1896 at Gort na gCapall on Inishmore, the largest of the Aran Islands, the second son of Michael O'Flaherty (<i>b</i>. 1846), farmer and fisherman, and Margaret Ganly (<i>b</i>. 1856?). His father was a nationalist who had been active in the Land League and his mother was descended from Plymouth Brethren who had moved from co. Antrim early in the century to build lighthouses. The boy grew up speaking English and Irish, and wrote short stories in both languages. His last published work was <span class="italic">D&uacute;il</span> (1953), a collection of stories in the Irish language.<br>
<br>O'Flaherty received his early education at Oatquarter national school, close to the family cottage, but in the autumn of 1908, through the influence of a visiting priest, Thomas Naughton of the Holy Ghost order, he was sent to Rockwell College in co. Tipperary to complete his secondary education. Naughton's hope was that this bright Aran Island youth would study for the priesthood with a view to working as a missionary priest in Africa. He did well at school, but when the time came for him to assume the clerical soutane, appropriate dress for a priestly novice, he flatly refused to do so and went home to Inishmore. Father Naughton then arranged for him to enter the order's college at Blackrock, near Dublin, in September 1913. He won an entrance scholarship in classics to University College, Dublin, but in reaction to the strict Thomism of his university lecturers began to read the writings of Karl Marx and other works of social revolution. Claiming that he was tired of waiting for revolution to break out in Ireland, he withdrew from the university and on 1 February 1916 enlisted in the Irish Guards. He signed on as William Ganly, choosing to use his mother's maiden name for what his family might regard as a surprising decision to renege on his Irish nationalist background by joining the British army. After training at Caterham barracks, he went with his regiment to France. His experiences at the front informed one of his poorest fictional works, <span class="italic">The Return of the Brute</span>, the grossly realistic semi-documentary which he published in 1929. In September 1917, while working with a transport unit between the canal at Boesinghe and the front, he was wounded in the head by an exploding shell and suffered severe shell-shock. Diagnosed as suffering from melancholia acuta, he was invalided out of the army on 7 May 1918, received a small pension, and was placed in his father's care. In the autobiographical <span class="italic">Shame the Devil</span> (1934) he wrote, &#145;You have to go through life with that shell bursting in your head&#146;, and for the rest of his life he suffered periodic bouts of depression as a result of his war injuries.<br>
<br>There followed a period of wandering worldwide. This took O'Flaherty as an ordinary seaman to South America in 1920. He subsequently visited Greece, Turkey, Canada, and the United States and took such work as he could find&#151;sometimes in factories, at other times as a lumberjack. When he gradually tired of all this restless travelling, he returned to Ireland. In the savage civil war which followed the signing of the treaty and the establishment of the Irish Free State, he fought on the unsuccessful republican side. In January 1922 he enacted his own eccentric mini-revolution when, with a handful of unemployed dockers, he seized the Rotunda building at the northern end of Dublin's O'Connell Street and raised a red flag over it. He gave himself the title of &#145;Chairman of the Council of the Unemployed&#146; but after three days he abandoned this rather absurd effort at social rebellion and fled to Cork. From there he went to London and began trying to write. After numerous rejections he embarked on his first serious effort at a novel about his native island, <span class="italic">Thy Neighbour's Wife</span> (1923). This was accepted by Jonathan Cape on the recommendation of their reader Edward Garnett, who became for a time O'Flaherty's friend and literary mentor. Garnett's wife, Constance, a celebrated translator of numerous Russian classics, was also to exert considerable influence on O'Flaherty, many of whose tormented, guilt-ridden characters owe a debt to such Russian predecessors as Dostoyevsky's Raskolnikov. The decade and a half from 1922 to 1937 proved O'Flaherty's most prolific period and saw the publication of more than a dozen novels and four collections of short stories. On 8 March 1926 he married Margaret Louise Curtis, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Barrington (1895/6&#150;1982), a fellow writer. They had one daughter.<br>
<br>Broadly speaking, O'Flaherty's novels, with the exception of the historical trilogy <span class="italic">Famine</span> (1937), <span class="italic">Land</span> (1946), and <span class="italic">Insurrection</span> (1950), choose as setting either his native Inishmore or the Dublin which provided his main urban experience. Both the Aran and Dublin novels show him as a caustic, indeed corrosive, critic of the social pressures which shaped early twentieth-century Ireland and, in particular, the new Ireland which emerged with the founding of the Irish Free State. His principal target was the Catholic church, whose clerics figure prominently as villains in his fiction, and he excoriated them memorably in the satirical <span class="italic">A Tourist's Guide to Ireland</span> (1929).<br>
<br>In his novels O'Flaherty generally discarded the disciplines of style in favour of energy and passion. &#145;In order to be a work of genius&#146;, he once wrote, &#145;a novel must offer something more than a perfect style &hellip; It must be a relentless picture of life&#146;  (<span class="italic">Irish Statesman</span>, 7 March 1925). Accordingly, his fictional protagonists tend to be powerful figures mired in violence. His <i>&#339;uvre</i> offers an impressive gallery of such types: Gypo Nolan in his greatest popular success, <span class="italic">The Informer</span> (1925); Fergus O'Connor in <span class="italic">The Black Soul</span> (1924); the eponymous heroes of <span class="italic">Mr Gilhooley</span> (1926) and <span class="italic">Skerrett</span> (1932); Ramon Moore in <span class="italic">The House of Gold</span> (1929). His second novel, <span class="italic">The Black Soul</span> (1924), was inspired largely by the author's own experience of depression and near despair after his war injuries. In this novel Fergus O'Connor flees to &#145;Inverara&#146; where he eventually finds solace in the arms of the wife of an islandman. The pair finally elope to the mainland after a climactic cliff-top adventure in which O'Connor saves the life of the cuckolded husband. O'Flaherty had hoped for a great success with this intensely personal novel and was disappointed by the lukewarm critical response. He reacted by abandoning the intensity and Lawrentian sensuality of <span class="italic">The Black Soul</span> and embarked instead on his first thriller, which ironically proved his greatest popular success. <span class="italic">The Informer</span> (1925) is the story of Gypo Nolan, a stupid giant who betrays a comrade and is hunted to his death as an informer. The novel, filmed for the first time in 1929 and again by John Ford in 1935 with Victor MacLaglen in the title role, was the work by which most people knew O'Flaherty. While the murky Dublin first depicted in this contrived thriller continued to provide an appropriately Dostoyevskian locale for morbid novels&#151;such as <span class="italic">Mr Gilhooley</span> (1926), <span class="italic">The Assassin</span> (1928), and <span class="italic">The Puritan</span> (1932)&#151;O'Flaherty located his more convincing fictions in the Aran Islands, where he was in every sense more at home. <span class="italic">Skerrett</span> (1932), based on a real-life story of conflict between the island's schoolteacher and an arrogantly authoritarian priest, in which Skerrett is subjected to a Lear-like process of suffering and utter frustration, is one of O'Flaherty's most considerable achievements. Only in <span class="italic">Famine</span> (1937), the first novel of his historical trilogy, did O'Flaherty again find a theme huge and horrible enough to sustain his intense sense of human suffering. This memorable study of the anguish of the Irish people in the great famine of 1845&#150;8 is focused on the destruction of the Kilmartin family by hunger and disease. In Mary Kilmartin the author achieved his finest portrait of female heroism and endurance. Regrettably, the other two novels of the trilogy, <span class="italic">Land</span> (1946) and <span class="italic">Insurrection</span> (1950), failed to match the opening volume. <span class="italic">Insurrection</span>, a sentimental and melodramatic version of the Easter rising of 1916, was O'Flaherty's last novel. Critics have speculated on the reasons for his creative decline, but no definitive biography which might throw light on this problem has yet appeared.<br>
<br>In sharp contrast to the violent complexity of the novels, O'Flaherty's short stories, now seen by critics as his most enduring legacy, were often models of forceful brevity. Many are vivid, minutely observed sketches of the world of nature, in which he manifests a remarkable empathy with animals, birds, and even fish. Other stories depict the harsh world of his native island. Some of the stories adopt an anti-romantic, even satirical, stance. Young love is given its <i>cong&eacute;</i> in &#145;The Touch&#146;, where two lovers are parted when the girl is given in marriage to a suitor selected by her mean-spirited father. In &#145;The Fairy Goose&#146;, which, according to O'Flaherty's celebrated contemporary Frank O'Connor  (in <span class="italic">The Lonely Voice</span>), contains in its few pages the &#145;whole history of religion&#146;, superstition and rustic intolerance are portrayed with bleakly comic vigour. In his finest stories O'Flaherty achieves a marvellous detachment which contrasts sharply with his very evident personal involvement in the tormented lives of the protagonists of his novels. Where the violence of the novels suggests  (in the words of his friend Sean O'Faolain in &#145;Don Quixote O'Flaherty&#146;, <span class="italic">London Mercury</span>, 37, 1937, 170&#150;75), &#145;the scream of a safety valve&#146;, the short stories generally present the author as a wisely detached observer of nature and of man in nature. George Russell (AE) summed up this contrast by saying, &#145;When O'Flaherty thinks, he's a goose, when he feels, he's a genius&#146;  (F. O'Connor, <span class="italic">The Lonely Voice</span>, 38).<br>
<br>In addition to his novels and short stories O'Flaherty published two idiosyncratic autobiographies: <span class="italic">Two Years</span> (1930) and <span class="italic">Shame the Devil</span> (1934). In 1930 he visited Russia, and the following year published an account of his trip entitled <span class="italic">I Went to Russia</span>. While scriptwriting in Hollywood in 1934, he met a young divorcee, Kitty Harding Tailer (<i>d</i>. 1990), who remained his companion for the rest of his life. O'Flaherty's marriage ended in separation in 1936. He spent the Second World War in America with Kitty, sometimes working in Hollywood, and visiting Arizona, Florida, and Connecticut. In 1952 he rented an apartment in Dublin at 9 Wilton Court. This was one of the first apartment blocks in Dublin and was O'Flaherty's home for the rest of his life. His letters, many to Kitty Tailer, offer a painfully revealing glimpse of his life during this period when his creative powers declined and he suffered from protracted writer's block. He embarked on a novel, <span class="italic">The Gamblers</span>, to which he occasionally refers in his letters, but it remained unfinished and exists now only as a 40,000 word typescript. He was seen at occasional public events in Dublin and still visited Europe from time to time until his health began to fail. In the 1970s Wolfhound Press began to reissue some of his novels which had long been out of print. University College, Galway, awarded him an honorary degree in 1974. He made a final visit to his native island in the summer of 1980. He died in St Vincent's Hospital, Elm Park, Dublin, on 7 September 1984. The funeral service at the university church on St Stephen's Green on 10 September was followed by cremation at Glasnevin cemetery.<br>
