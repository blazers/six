<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Young, Sir  Allen William</span>  (1827&#150;1915), <span class="occ">merchant navy officer and polar explorer</span>, was born at Twickenham on 12 December 1827, the son of Henry Young, of Riverdale, Twickenham. After being educated at home he joined the merchant service in 1842 and rose quickly. During the Crimean War he transferred from the <i>Marlborough</i>, an East Indiaman, to the command of the troopship <i>Adelaide</i>, but remained in the merchant service. In 1857, when Francis Leopold McClintock was fitting out the yacht <i>Fox</i> in order to follow up the discoveries of John Rae bearing on the fate of the expedition of Sir John Franklin, he chose Young as navigating officer. Young declined any salary and contributed &pound;500 to the cost of the expedition. During the two years spent in following Franklin's tracks, Young made notable sledge journeys, exploring about 380 miles of new coast line, including the southern and western coasts of Prince of Wales Land and both shores of Franklin Strait. He also discovered McClintock Channel, but was unable to cross its rough ice. In 1860 he had command of the <i>Fox</i> in the north Atlantic telegraph expedition, which surveyed a telegraph route between Europe and America via the Faeroes, Iceland, and Greenland. He visited the east coast of Greenland, but, believing it to be impracticable for a cable route, did not land. He sailed on for the west coast, landed with Rae (who was in charge of the land part of the expedition), and ascended to the ice cap near Julianeh&aring;b; but he returned on deciding that a telegraph line could not be carried across Greenland. He next went to China to assist Admiral Sherard Osborn in equipping the Chinese navy, and commanded the gunboat <i>Kwangtung</i> during the Taiping uprising, 1862&#150;4. In 1871 he was commissioner to the Maritime Congress at Naples, and in 1875 he was present at Suakin, on the Red Sea, as commissioner of the National Aid Society.<br>
<br>With the object of assisting the government Arctic expedition which set out in May 1875 under the command of George Strong Nares, Young took his steam yacht <i>Pandora</i>, with a crew of thirty-one men, to Baffin Bay. He tried to make the north-west passage, but was stopped by heavy ice in Peel Strait. On the return journey he picked up George Nares's dispatches from the Carey Islands, bringing home the latest news of Nares's expedition. The next year he again took the <i>Pandora</i> north, continuing his efforts to pass through the north-west passage, and in spite of great difficulties landed dispatches for Nares at Cape Isabella and Littleton Island. On his return he sighted Nares's ships homeward bound off Cape Farewell. In June 1882 he commanded the whaler <i>Hope</i>, chartered with government help, in order to search for the explorer, Benjamin Leigh Smith, who had sailed for Franz Josef Land in July of the previous year. Nares and Young were instrumental in launching the relief expedition and in August 1882 the <i>Hope</i> found Leigh Smith and his party at Matochkin Shar, on the west coast of Novaya Zemlya, which they had reached in boats after the destruction of their vessel off Franz Josef Land.<br>
<br>Young was knighted in 1877 for his services to Nares's expedition and was created CB in 1881 and CVO in 1903. He also held orders from the crowns of Denmark, Sweden, Austria, and the Netherlands. He was a commander in the Royal Naval Reserve (1862) and a younger brother of Trinity House. A member of the wealthy brewing family Young, he was well connected. Lillie Langtry and her husband were guests on his yacht at Cowes and he introduced her to the prince of Wales, one of his close friends.<br>
<br>Young died at the York Hotel, 11 Albemarle Street, London, unmarried, on 20 November 1915 after a long illness. He was buried in Brookwood cemetery, near Woking, Surrey. He wrote comparatively little and had a strong dislike of publicity. He contributed to the <span class="italic">Cornhill Magazine</span> in 1860 an account of his experiences in the <i>Fox</i> expedition in search of Franklin, and was the author of <span class="italic">The Cruise of the Pandora</span> (1876) and <span class="italic">The Two Voyages of the Pandora</span> (1879). He died leaving over &pound;35,000 and his wealth, skill, and pleasant personality all contributed to the success of his Arctic journeys.<br>
