<span class="headword">Wonfor <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Duncan]</span>,  Andrea Jean</span>  (1944&#150;2004), <span class="occ">television executive and producer</span>, was born at Upton Lodge nursing home, Alpha Road, Birchington, Margate, Kent, on 31 July 1944, the daughter of George Duncan, an army officer in the Buffs (Royal East Kent regiment), and his wife, Audrey Joan, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Player. She was educated at Simon Langton School for Girls in Canterbury and subsequently read history at New Hall, Cambridge. After graduating she was recruited in 1966 as a trainee by Granada Television in Manchester. Her father was from South Shields and the family spent time in the north-east as she was growing up. An early affection for the area blossomed into a lifelong bond when she joined Tyne Tees Television in 1969 as a researcher. Two years earlier, on 29 April 1967, she had married Patrick William Bussell Masefield (<i>b</i>. 1942/3), theatre director, whose father, Geoffrey, was a university lecturer. They had one daughter. She parted from her husband on moving to the north-east and the marriage was dissolved in 1973. She married her second husband, the film-maker Geoffrey Spencer (Geoff) Wonfor (<i>b</i>. 1948/9), son of Wilfred Wonfor, a security officer, on 15 January 1974; they had one daughter.<br>
<br>Wonfor progressed smoothly at Tyne Tees to directing and in 1976 stepped onto the executive ladder as head of children's and young people's programmes. Her passion for spotting and unlocking the creative potential of those around her injected new zest into making programmes for young people. Her most daring and important contribution to this genre was launched in 1982 when <span class="italic">The Tube</span> (broadcast on Channel 4) unleashed the anarchic and sometimes profane pairing of Jools Holland and Paula Yates on a live, Friday teatime audience. Accused by the industry's regulator of bad taste, and stalked by the tabloids, the show became a runaway success and at the same time placed Tyneside at an unaccustomed epicentre of youth and rock culture.<br>
<br>In 1983 Wonfor extended her distinctive approach and personal trademark to the complete range of Tyne Tees's output as director of programmes. Her regard and ambitions for the region shone out of the programmes she made. After eighteen years with Tyne Tees she left to form Zenith North, a production company geared to nurture northern talent. There she came up with the idea of <span class="italic">Byker Grove</span> (first broadcast in 1989), a series for the BBC that became something of a northern fame academy with Anthony McPartlin and Declan Donnelly (better known as Ant and Dec) as two of its most notable alumni.<br>
<br>In 1990 Michael Grade took Wonfor to Channel 4, initially as controller of arts and entertainment, then as deputy director of programmes. Her daring and ingenuity introduced a flurry of young discoveries, Chris Evans, Gaby Roslin, Caitlin Moran, and Johnny Vaughan among them. A canon of programmes swiftly emerged that dovetailed with the channel's provocative character&#151;<span class="italic">The Word</span>, the first up-to-the-minute sitcom, <span class="italic">Drop the Dead Donkey</span>, <span class="italic">The Crystal Maze</span>, <span class="italic">Rude Women</span>, <span class="italic">Eurotrash</span>, and <span class="italic">Movie Watch</span>. But her boldest venture and her biggest impact was undoubtedly in the morning schedule. The tired and largely ignored <span class="italic">Channel 4 Daily</span> was thrown out and Wonfor brought in Planet 24, the production company of Bob Geldof and Paula Yates. The result, from September 1992, was <span class="italic">The Big Breakfast</span>, which transformed the comfortable coffee table and sofa breakfast television scenario. Its brash, harum-scarum formula attracted new categories of viewers and trebled Channel 4's early morning audience.<br>
<br>Wonfor took her golden touch back to Granada in 1993, where she became its first female director of programmes and subsequently joint managing director. Firmly established Granada favourites benefited from her individuality and she oversaw a string of new hits, including <span class="italic">Prime Suspect</span>, <span class="italic">Cracker</span>, <span class="italic">The Royle Family</span>, and <span class="italic">Cold Feet</span>. In 1995 she was diagnosed with breast cancer. After surgery and six months of chemotherapy she was back at work, her energy and determination undimmed. Typically she had her experiences written into the storyline of <span class="italic">Coronation Street</span>, hoping that the resulting heightened awareness of cancer among women would encourage earlier detection. It did&#151;the Christie Hospital in Manchester reported a rise in cervical smear tests from 2000 a week to 2000 a day following the relevant episode.<br>
<br>Within a year of her treatment Wonfor became the first woman to chair the Royal Television Society. As the Granada group grew larger, absorbing London Weekend and Yorkshire Tyne Tees Television, so too did her responsibilities. She became chair of Granada Production and then creative director with teams across the UK, as well as New York, Los Angeles, Berlin, and Sydney. In 2002 she took early retirement from Granada and co-founded the independent producer Liberty Bell, with which she had further successful programmes including <span class="italic">Grumpy Old Men</span> (BBC2). She was appointed OBE in the 2003 new year honours list. Her illness returned just as the company was making its mark. But even as she fought cancer a second time she was active in new local theatre, film, and media ventures in the north-east. She also produced, alongside her husband Geoff, an intimate portrait of Stella McCartney for Alan Yentob's BBC1 <span class="italic">Imagine</span> series, and in the last week of her life was discussing further projects with major channels. She died of breast cancer at her home, Fell Pasture, Ingoe, Matfen, Northumberland, on 10 September 2004. She was survived by her husband and her two daughters.<br>
