<span class="headword">Ravenhill,  William Lionel Desmond</span>  (1919&#150;1995), <span class="occ">geographer and historian of cartography</span>, was born on 30 December 1919 in Carmarthen, the son of George Ravenhill (<i>c</i>.1880&#150;1967), a master plumber, and his wife, Elizabeth (1893&#150;1993). He had a brother and a sister. Ravenhill won a scholarship to Queen Elizabeth Grammar School, Carmarthen, in 1930 and entered the University College of Wales, Aberystwyth, in 1938 to read geography. His academic studies were interrupted in 1940 by war service as a Royal Air Force fighter pilot in Malta, Italy, Yugoslavia, and Egypt. After demobilization, he completed his degree and took a diploma in education; he was then appointed to an assistant lectureship at the University College of the South West, later the University of Exeter (1948), and was subsequently promoted to lecturer (1951) and senior lecturer (1962). He became professor of human geography in 1969 and Reardon Smith professor of geography and head of department in 1971, which post he held until his retirement in 1983; he also served the university as dean of its faculty of social studies and deputy vice-chancellor.<br>
<br>Ravenhill inherited a department of geography which the university had allowed to languish in the 1960s&#151;that decade of great expansion elsewhere in higher education. But he had a clear, long-term vision for the future of what he saw very much as his department. He devoted himself to its development, won a series of new posts in the 1970s, and appointed wisely&#151;no fewer than eight of his then &#145;junior&#146; colleagues (Ravenhill had a strictly hierarchical view of university departments and their personnel) later held professorial chairs. Always a very formal man, even somewhat austere and forbidding to the non-academic members of his department, Ravenhill delighted in the collegiality of the senior common room and lectured with the panache and sense of theatre so characteristic of university teachers of his generation.<br>
<br>Despite a long life in, and great affection for, the south-west of England, Ravenhill remained fiercely proud of his Welsh roots. It is thus no surprise that his earliest research concerned the Celtic origins of settlement. His MA thesis for the University of Wales (1951) analysed early settlement in Devon, and his doctoral thesis for the University of London (1957) investigated early settlement sites in Devon and Cornwall and their influence on the modern settlement pattern. His seminal contribution to the historical geography of south-west England is his analysis of the settlement patterns, agrarian economy, and rural society of eleventh-century Cornwall, published as &#145;Cornwall&#146; in <span class="italic">The Domesday Geography of South-West England</span> (H. C. Darby and R. Welldon Finn, 1967). A series of articles in learned journals by Ravenhill in association with the archaeologist Lady Aileen Fox confirmed the academic reputation of this geographer among archaeologists. He was elected a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London and in 1989 was appointed president of the Devon Archaeological Society. In his retirement he was co-editor with Roger Kain of a <span class="italic">Historical Atlas of South-West England</span> (1999), a work which celebrates his lifelong commitment to the University of Exeter's regional mission.<br>
<br>Significant though these works on the historical geography and archaeology of the south-west are, Ravenhill's particular and lasting academic contribution was to pioneer the history of cartography in Devon and Cornwall. It was within the close-knit academic world of cartography and map history where humanistic scholarship is combined with scientific analysis that he felt academically most comfortable. His <span class="italic">Benjamin Donn: a Map of the County of Devon, 1765</span> (1965) was followed by <span class="italic">John Norden's Manuscript Maps of Cornwall and its Nine Hundreds</span> (1972) and (with Oliver Padel) <span class="italic">A Map of the County of Cornwall Newly Surveyed by Joel Gascoyne, 1699</span> (1991). These major studies are supported by numerous papers in local and national journals and more popular books such as <span class="italic">Christopher Saxton's 16th-Century Maps: the Counties of England and Wales</span> (1992). Leukaemia, fought with great stoicism over a number of years, took Ravenhill from this life before he could bring all the strands of his cartographic work together in a much-hoped-for monograph on the cartographic history of south-west England. He died in the Royal Devon and Exeter Hospital, Wonford, Exeter, on 9 October 1995, and was cremated on 16 October. His widow, Mary Rose, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Atkinson (<i>b</i>. 1928), whom he married on 5 August 1952, worked with him throughout his life, and following his death continued his work with publications on historical maps of the west country. They had no children.<br>
