<span class="headword">Nugent,  Thomas</span>  (<em>c.</em>1700&#150;1772), <span class="occ">writer and traveller</span>, was born in Ireland, and apparently graduated from Trinity College, Dublin, but spent most of his life in London. Comments in his works show him to have been a protestant, and an ardent supporter of the Hanoverian constitutional settlement. In 1765 he received from the University of Aberdeen the honorary degree of LLD, and in 1767 was made a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries. He has been confused with Johnson's friend and Edmund Burke's father-in-law, Dr Christopher Nugent (1698&#150;1775), to whom he may have been related, and who is mentioned in Thomas Nugent's will.<br>
<br>Nugent was a prolific author and a skilful translator. He wrote so much that he thought it had taken its toll on his health. In his lifetime he was perhaps best known for his <span class="italic">New Pocket Dictionary of the French and English Languages</span> (1767), which went to at least twenty-eight editions. After his death, in Britain and more especially in Germany, he was best known for <span class="italic">The history of Vandalia: containing the ancient and present state of the country of Mecklenburg, its revolutions under the Venedi and the Saxons, with the succession and memorable actions of its sovereigns</span> (3 vols., 1766&#150;73); <span class="italic">Travels through Germany, with a particular account of the courts of Mecklenburg: in a series of letters to a friend</span> (2 vols., 1768); and <span class="italic">The Grand Tour, or a Journey through the Netherlands, Germany, Italy, and France</span> (4 vols., 1749). <span class="italic">Travels through Germany</span> presents a mixture of history, topographical descriptions, quotations from other authors, and anecdotes about the trials of daily life. Above all he seeks to describe the &#145;customs and manners&#146; of the people  (p. 5). There are flashes of humour as when he, a doctor of law, remarks, &#145;As Hamburg is over-stocked with most commodities, so it is with lawyers&#146;  (p. 61). The work is in epistolary form, ostensibly unrevised for the press, but his standard disclaimer wears very thin, notably when his ship strikes a sandbank in the middle of the night as he is returning to England, and his immediate impulse is to recite an ode of Horace. <span class="italic">Travels through Germany</span> describes much that is entertaining from the author's own travels, while <span class="italic">The Grand Tour</span> is a guidebook in the much narrower sense of providing information on inns, road and boat connections, and sights to visit. It is a compilation of his own experience and that of others reproduced in duodecimo for ease of packing. He uses the format later popularized by Murray and the <span class="roman">Blue Guides</span> of taking in sights by means of a series of tours from the capital. Among Nugent's very numerous translations, mostly from French, his translation of Benvenuto Cellini's autobiography (2 vols., 1771) attracted considerable attention and ran through several editions.<br>
<br>Nugent made his will on 24 April 1772 and died in his rooms at Gray's Inn on 27 April 1772. His residuary legatee and sole executor was Mary Hooper, spinster, &#145;for her long and faithful service and attendance&#146;. He appears to have been unmarried and childless.<br>
