<span class="headword">Douglas,  William</span>, eighth earl of Douglas and second earl of Avondale  (1424/5&#150;1452), <span class="occ">magnate</span>, was the eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7891/', "James Douglas, seventh earl of Douglas and first earl of Avondale, known as the Gross")</script>, and Beatrix Sinclair, daughter of Henry, earl of Orkney. An adult when he succeeded his father in 1443, William must have been born within a year of his parents' marriage in early 1424. He is first recorded at the baptismal celebrations for the twin sons of King James I on 16 October 1430 at Holyrood Abbey. As a mark of favour to William's father, a trusted royal councillor, the young William was knighted by the king alongside the two princes and a number of other noble children, including his cousin and namesake, the future sixth earl of Douglas.<h2>
<a name="Inheritanceandmarriage"></a>Inheritance and marriage</h2>It was the violent death of this other William Douglas at the so-called &#145;Black Dinner&#146; on 24 November 1440 which led to the succession of James Douglas to the earldom of Douglas and to the bulk of the family lands which passed by entail to the heirs male. William was heir to the greatest magnate inheritance in Scotland but his father sought to add to his fortune by arranging the marriage of his son and Margaret Douglas, the Fair Maid of Galloway (<i>c</i>.1426&#150;<i>c</i>.1476). Margaret was the sister of the sixth earl and heir to the lordship of Galloway. The match between these cousins was intended to reunite the Black Douglas estates, but Earl James's attempts to achieve it antagonized many other councillors of the young King James II. The earl's leading enemies were the chancellor, William, Lord Crichton, and his family, but there were many other Scottish magnates who were reluctant to see the power of the Black Douglases reconstituted and, when Earl James died in March 1443, his son was still unmarried.<br>
<br>William Douglas succeeded his father in extensive lands, titles, and offices, and also in his readiness to dispense with legalities. Along with the earldom of Douglas, William also inherited his father's lands in Clydesdale and Lothian which had been united to form the earldom of Avondale in 1437. The lord of castles like Abercorn, Bothwell, Douglas, and Newark in Ettrick Forest, Earl William was the greatest magnate in southern Scotland and assumed his father's offices of justiciar, sheriff of Lanark, and warden in the west and middle marches towards England. The new earl may well have spent the spring and summer of 1443 securing this southern inheritance and building new alliances with those on the royal council and especially the Livingston family, which had custody of the young king. With the backing of these allies Douglas sought to defeat those who remained opposed to his marriage and the other interests of his house.<br>
<br>On 22 August 1443 Douglas led a large army against the lands of the Crichtons where they bordered his own in Linlithgowshire. The earl presented his attack as more than a private feud. The young king was in his force and Douglas flew the royal banner, demanding that his opponents surrender to the crown. Control of the king was further exploited in the aftermath of military victory. In November the Crichtons were summoned to parliament to answer for their resistance and, on their failure to appear, were stripped of their offices. Although he had not finally defeated the Crichtons, during late 1443 Douglas had successfully allied physical force and legal justification to achieve private goals. It was an approach to politics which would characterize the rest of his career. Earl William's ascendancy was evident in 1444. He abandoned his father's support of the conciliar movement in the church, and thereby removed the last obstacle to his marriage, receiving a papal dispensation (dated 24 July) for a match which reunited Galloway with the rest of the Douglas lands. Elsewhere, too, Earl William secured his family's interests where his father had failed, imposing his will in local disputes in Lothian and Berwickshire.<h2>
<a name="Extensionsofpower"></a>Extensions of power</h2>These actions demonstrated Douglas's predominance in southern Scotland but by the end of the year the earl was looking to extend his family's influence in the north of the kingdom. In alliance with a group which included David Lindsay, earl of Crawford, and the Livingstons, Douglas participated in a series of attacks on their enemies, a group headed by Queen Joan, Bishop Kennedy of St Andrews, and Crichton. This sporadic conflict lasted from late 1444 until the following summer and ended with the eclipse of Crichton and the death of Queen Joan while under siege in Dunbar Castle. Even before victory had been secured Douglas and his allies held a parliament to secure their gains. Two of Douglas's brothers, Archibald and Hugh, were created earls of Moray and Ormond. These new Douglas earldoms lay in the north, and to ensure his brothers' ability to enjoy their estates, Douglas sought friends in the north. Initially these included Alexander Gordon, earl of Huntly. However, Huntly soon clashed with Douglas's other northern ally, the earl of Crawford, and it may have been in March 1446 that Douglas entered into a band, or private alliance, with Crawford and Alexander, earl of Ross and lord of the Isles. Designed to secure Douglas lands in the north, this agreement would ultimately prove fatal to Earl William.<br>
<br>However, in the later 1440s the position of Douglas and his brothers seemed secure. Control of king and council was largely left to the Livingstons, while Douglas sought to increase his status further. During 1447 Earl William secured direct control of the lordship of Galloway. His wife's grandmother, Margaret Stewart, the widow of the fourth earl of Douglas, had been given custody of Galloway for life but Douglas forced her to spend her last years in the priory of Lincluden near Dumfries, and took possession (illegally) of her principal castle of Threave. In the late 1440s Douglas also followed the example of his forebears in attitudes to European politics. The ascendancy of Douglas over the king's council from late 1444 coincided with the adoption of a closer relationship with Charles VII of France. Three sisters of James II (and of the dauphin's wife, Margaret) were sent to the continent to become pawns in French diplomatic ventures, and in 1448 the alliance with France was formally renewed. During the negotiations with France, Douglas put forward a claim to a share of the duchy of Touraine on behalf of the recently dispossessed Margaret Stewart. His claim was politely denied, but Douglas still sought fame abroad. In the border war with England which broke out in 1448 Douglas and his brothers took a leading role, defending the Scottish marches and raiding into northern England.<br>
<br>Such echoing of traditional Douglas roles had a serious domestic purpose. For all Earl William's political successes since 1443, his lordship rested on shallower roots than that of his predecessors. The Black Dinner had brought his family to power but had weakened the cohesion of the traditional Douglas following. The murder of James Auchinleck by Richard Colville in 1449, which Earl William punished, was the killing of one Douglas adherent by another. When, during 1448, the earl reissued a code of march law established by his predecessors, he was not just reorganizing border defence. He was also emphasizing the link between his lordship in the marches and that of earlier Douglas magnates. Earl William had other problems. In 1447 his brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7892/', "James Douglas")</script> was designated as his heir and was consistently referred to as master of Douglas. An exceptional instance of such a title being held by a magnate's brother, this may in part have reflected problems in the earl's marriage, which had produced no offspring in nearly a decade. Without children from this match the earl's hold on Galloway remained uncertain, which in turn emphasized his difficulties with local men who resented his treatment of Margaret Stewart.<h2>
<a name="Conflictwiththecrown"></a>Conflict with the crown</h2>By 1449 Earl William had established his branch of the Douglas family at the head of Scottish political society. However, flaws remained in this strength and, with hindsight, the emergence of James II as an active force with his destruction of his Livingston keepers in September 1449 heralded a new political atmosphere. There was no obvious sign of impending conflict between crown and Douglases, nor of personal animus between the two young men at the head of Scottish politics. Earl William had aided and benefited from the fall of the Livingstons. In January 1450 he received royal charters confirming his hold on Galloway and Ettrick Forest, and he joined a number of major magnates in giving loans to the king. Like others, Douglas was seeking to secure his position with the king while maintaining his family's gains since 1437. The only indication of the earl's anxiety was his decision to leave Scotland on a pilgrimage to Rome in October 1450. Yet his journey had other purposes. Douglas travelled with an impressive entourage via the courts of Burgundy, France, and England. As well as winning papal blessings, William may have been offering his services at a moment of crisis in the Anglo-French conflict.<br>
<br>However, in his absence the king launched an assault on the estates of the pilgrim. In December 1450 James II travelled to Melrose, in the middle of Douglas's border lordships, and called together the earl's local enemies. Early the next year the king went south-west to Annandale and Galloway, this time using force to obtain the submission of the earl's tenants. His aim was not the destruction of Douglas power but the establishment of control over lands to which Douglas's rights were dubious. James II was able to win over a significant number of the earl's allies and may have expected Douglas to accept his losses. When Earl William returned to Scotland in April 1451, though, it was to resist not submit. He secured English support and may have been acclaimed lieutenant by his followers to justify his opposition to the king. During May and early June Douglas clearly forced the king to recognize his failure. In a parliament in late June Douglas resigned his lands to receive a fresh grant and a remission for his actions. Only the lands of Wigtown and of Stewarton in Ayrshire were withheld by James. In October these too were restored to the earl.<h2>
<a name="Violentdeath"></a>Violent death</h2>Douglas's ability to withstand royal attack was testament to his power. It was also a product of the king's wider problems. During late 1451 royal actions had driven two of the major northern magnates, the earls of Crawford and Ross, to take up arms. In this crisis, the king turned to Douglas and his brothers, Moray, Ormond, and John, lord of Balvenie, to provide support in the north. At a series of meetings during the winter of 1451&#150;2, the king sought Douglas's aid in an increasingly tense atmosphere. By late February Douglas would only attend the king's council at Stirling with a written safe conduct. When the two men met in Stirling Castle on 22 February 1452 Douglas once again refused to take action which would break his band with Ross and Crawford. In response the king replied that if Douglas would not break the band he would, and stabbed William in the neck. The wounded earl was then killed by others at the council, among them his own former adherents.<br>
<br>Earl William's killing precipitated a conflict which the king was fortunate to survive. Ultimately he failed for a second time to defeat the Douglases and was forced to recognize William's brother James Douglas as heir to all the dead earl's lands and as the husband of his widow. Subsequently the death of Douglas became recognized as a defining moment in crown&#150;magnate relations in fifteenth-century Scotland. To sixteenth-century historians like Hector Boece and Robert Lindsay of Pitscottie, Douglas epitomized the overmighty subject, arrogant, lawless, and heedless of royal justice. Stories of the earl's tyrannous treatment of his own vassals justified the king's killing of a protected guest, but may also derive from Douglas's own difficulties in maintaining the support of his own followers after the disruption of his family's lordship between 1424 and 1449. In his short career, Douglas represented the power, ambition, and independence of the greatest Scottish magnate dynasty at its fullest extent.<br>
