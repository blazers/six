<span class="headword">Thomson,  John</span>  (1837&#150;1921), <span class="occ">photographer and travel writer</span>, was born on 14 June 1837 at Portland Place, Edinburgh, the third of the four children to survive infancy of William Thomson (1794&#150;<i>c</i>.1870), tobacconist, and his wife, Isabella Newlands (1801&#150;1863). His early education is unknown, but by 1851 he had become an apprenticed optician in Edinburgh, probably with the firm run by James Mackay Bryson on Princes Street. While an apprentice, he attended the Watt Institution and School of Arts during the sessions 1856&#150;7 and 1857&#150;8, gaining the attestation of proficiency in natural philosophy, and in junior mathematics and chemistry. He was awarded the life diploma in 1858, and also gained a Watt Club prize for English. Bryson proposed him for election to the Royal Scottish Society of Arts, although he became a member only for 1861&#150;2.<br>
<br>For reasons that are not entirely clear Thomson left Edinburgh on 29 April 1862 to join his elder brother William in Singapore. Soon after his arrival he began advertising his services as a photographer, although the following year he and his brother joined forces as makers and repairers of optical and nautical instruments. While in Singapore he began to take serious photographs, mainly cartes-de-visites, although some landscapes have survived. He also used the opportunity to travel widely around the neighbouring territories, especially Penang, and Province Wellesley. In 1865 he decided to travel to Angkor in Cambodia, accounts of which had recently been published by Henri Mouhot. He sailed first to Bangkok, arriving there on 28 September 1865, and with the assistance of H. G. Kennedy, an official at the British consulate, he gained audience with the Siamese royal family, many of whom, including King Mongkut, were the subjects of important portrait photographs. Mongkut granted permission for Thomson and Kennedy to travel to Angkor, for which they set out on 27 January 1866, and where he became the first photographer to document the site. They travelled on to Phnom Penh, returning to Bangkok to leave a set of photographs with King Mongkut. In May 1867 several of Thomson's images were reproduced in the <span class="italic">Illustrated London News</span>. By the middle of 1866 he had returned to Britain, where he set about publicizing his travels and photographs, writing articles for the <span class="italic">British Journal of Photography</span>, and exhibiting and lecturing in Edinburgh, Glasgow, and London. His first major work, <span class="italic">The Antiquities of Cambodia</span>, was published in Edinburgh in 1867.<br>
<br>Late in 1867 Thomson returned to the Far East, visiting Vietnam at first, then moving his studio from Singapore to Hong Kong in 1868. He wrote a number of articles, illustrated with his own photographs, for the <span class="italic">China Magazine</span>, became the official photographer for the duke of Edinburgh's visit in 1869, and published a second book of photographs, <span class="italic">Views on the North River</span>. After marrying Isabel Petrie in Hong Kong on 19 November 1868, he began an intensive period of travelling around mainland China, taking a large series of wet-collodion photographs with the intention of returning to Britain and publishing them in book form. Between 1870 and 1872 he undertook four distinct journeys, up the north branch of the Pearl River, up the River Min to the area around Foochow (Fuzhou), to Peking (Beijing), and finally up the great Yangtze (Yangzi) River. The photographs taken on these journeys form one of the most extensive photographic surveys of any region taken in the nineteenth century. The range and depth of his photographic vision mark Thomson out as one of the most important travel photographers. During the early part of this period he was based in Hong Kong, but in 1870 he sold his business as a going concern, leaving part of his stock of collodion negatives behind but taking the best material with him. In Foochow he worked closely with Justus Doolittle, an important American missionary in the area, and in 1871 he travelled to Taiwan, visiting a Scottish medical missionary, the Revd James Laidlaw Maxwell, in whose company he took the earliest extant photographs. In Peking, Thomson again sought out westerners, especially through the British legation, and for a time acted as the correspondent of the <span class="italic">Illustrated London News</span>. The British minister, Sir Thomas Wade, gave him the important task of photographing senior Chinese officials including Li Hongzhang, Shen Kew Fen, and Prince Gong himself. Thomson's photographs of China form what he himself intended to be a &#145;visual encyclopaedia&#146; of the land, its people, customs, industry, and architecture. The surviving body of work embraces most of the principal genres of photography with equal skill. Although Thomson's intention for his photographs was for them to be an impassive documentary record&#151;truthful in a way that he felt only photography could be&#151;they none the less betray a viewpoint coloured by his background as a product of Britain's imperial ascendancy.<br>
<br>In the autumn of 1872 Thomson returned to Britain, reunited himself with his family, who had returned in 1870, and settled in London. He immediately began the task of promoting and disseminating his photography. He contributed a series of illustrated articles on life in China to <span class="italic">The Graphic</span> in 1872&#150;3, published privately a magnificent portfolio of carbon prints, <span class="italic">Foochow and the River Min</span> (1873), and more importantly a large-scale work, <span class="italic">Illustrations of China and its People</span> (1873&#150;4), which was responsible for firmly establishing his reputation as a photographer, traveller, and leading authority on China. A series of well-received books and articles followed, most importantly <span class="italic">The Straits of Malacca, Indo-China, and China</span> (1875), a condensed version of his Far Eastern travels, and his edition and translation of Gaston Tissandier's work as <span class="italic">History and Handbook of Photography</span> (1876) which, in its second edition (1877), included the last writings of William Henry Fox Talbot. In 1876 he joined forces with the journalist Adolphe Smith on an important monthly publication entitled <span class="italic">Street Life in London</span>, which pioneered the genre of photojournalism, combining hard-hitting, albeit posed, street photography, with documentary-style prose. His final overseas travelling took place in 1878 to Cyprus, a journey that resulted in the de luxe two-volume publication <span class="italic">Through Cyprus with the Camera in the Autumn of 1878</span>.<br>
<br>Throughout the 1880s Thomson concentrated on building up his commercial portrait studio, which he moved from Buckingham Palace Road to settle eventually in New Bond Street, and which gradually acquired a clientele of the fashionable rich, which increased after he gained the royal warrant on 11 May 1881. Throughout the 1880s and 1890s Thomson was employed on a number of commissions to take portraits of the royal family, both in Scotland and London. He also gained commissions through his associations with the Royal Geographical Society, of which he was made a fellow in 1867, and for whom he became instructor in photography in 1886, tutoring prospective travellers in photography, writing instructive articles in the society's publications, and organizing exhibitions, such as the Sixth International Geographical Congress, for which he acted as secretary. As his reputation grew, lucrative commissions followed, including those to document the art collection of Alfred de Rothschild, and to act as one of the official photographers at the Devonshire House fancy dress ball in 1897. In later life he continued to allow his photographs to be reproduced in a wide variety of publications, most notably children's encyclopaedias, and a number of awards followed, including a gold medal at the Paris International Geographical Exhibition in 1889. In 1890 the explorer Sir Halford Mackinder named a peak of Mount Kilimanjaro Point Thomson in honour of his services to the Royal Geographical Society. Thomson died on 29 September 1921 in London, and was buried on 4 October in Streatham Vale cemetery. His latter years were spent in relative comfort and wealth, divided between the Royal Geographical Society and the Royal Societies Club. He was survived by his wife and six children. Some of Thomson's negatives are held by the library of the Wellcome Institute for the History of Medicine, London; his photographs appear in the Lacock Abbey collection and the Stephen White collection in the Tokyo-Fuji Art Museum, Tokyo.<br>
