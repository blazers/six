<span class="headword">Northcote,  James Spencer</span>  (1821&#150;1907), <span class="occ">college head and historian</span>, born at Feniton Court, near Honiton, Devon, on 26 May 1821, was the second son in the family of two sons and four daughters of George Barons Northcote (1796&#150;1875), landowner, of Feniton Court and his wife, Maria (<i>d</i>. 1836), daughter and coheir of Gabriel Stone of South Brent, Somerset. Educated at Ilmington grammar school (1830&#150;37), he entered Corpus Christi College, Oxford, in 1837, was awarded a scholarship, and graduated BA in 1841 with a first class in the classical school. While at Oxford he came under the influence of J. H. Newman and E. B. Pusey. On 10 December 1842 he married his cousin Susannah Spencer Poole (<i>d</i>. 1853), the daughter of Joseph Ruscombe Poole, solicitor, of Bridgwater, Somerset. Having been ordained deacon at Exeter Cathedral on Trinity Sunday 1844, he served as a supernumerary curate at Ilfracombe, but his doubts about the Anglican position steadily increased.<br>
<br>In 1845 Northcote's wife, with three of her sisters, joined the Church of Rome. After resigning his curacy, Northcote himself followed her example and was received at Prior Park, Bath, on 7 January 1846. The move caused a lasting rift with his father. He set out his position in <span class="italic">The Fourfold Difficulty of Anglicanism</span>, published in 1846. A French translation by Jules Gondon appeared the next year. From 1847 to 1850 he resided at Rome and there developed a close friendship with G. B. De Rossi, the historian of the catacombs&#151;a subject which he now made his lifetime study. His stay at Rome coincided with the first years of the pontificate of Pius IX, and he witnessed the dramatic events attending the assassination of the papal prime minister and the pope's flight to Gaeta.<br>
<br>Northcote spent the years 1850&#150;53 at Clifton, devoting himself to literary work. From June 1852 to September 1854 he was acting editor of <span class="italic">The Rambler</span>, to which he had been a contributor since its inception by his friend John Moore Capes in January 1848. Following the death of his wife on 3 June 1853 he began studies for the priesthood, first at the Birmingham Oratory (1854) and then at the Collegio Pio in Rome (1854&#150;5). Having been ordained priest on 29 July 1855 at St Dominic's Convent, Stone, Staffordshire, he was in charge of the mission at Stoke-on-Trent until his appointment in January 1860 as vice-president of St Mary's College, Oscott, near Birmingham. He became president the following July.<br>
<br>Northcote's seventeen-year presidency came to be regarded as the golden age of the college. He modernized the studies and the regime in line with the principles established by Thomas Arnold, and Oscott gained the status of the leading Catholic public school, attended by the sprigs of the aristocracy. During his later years in office, however, Northcote had to contend with competition from the Oratory School, Birmingham, and with two severe epidemics, one of which led to the death in 1867 of his only surviving son, then a pupil at the college. In February 1865 he was involved in a highly publicized court case which came before the lord chief justice, Sir Alexander Cockburn, at the queen's bench. The case revealed some tension at the college between the fee-paying students and the clerical students, supported by charity, who went on to study divinity. David Fitzgerald, the son of an Irish appeal judge, was expelled by Northcote for leading a campaign of derision against the church students, as being &#145;of inferior extraction&#146;, and took an action against him for technical assault. The plaintiff was awarded damages of only &pound;5 but Northcote had to pay costs of &pound;800&#151;a sum which was raised by his supporters. Another of the many Irish pupils at the college was the future novelist George Moore, who in his memoirs recalled Northcote, unflatteringly, as &#145;a great-bellied, big, ugly fellow, whom we used to call the Gorilla. He was almost as hairy, great tufts starting out of his ears and out of his nostrils&#146;  (Moore, 421&#150;2).<br>
<br>Northcote retired through ill health in 1877, and twelve years later the college at Oscott was converted to exclusive use as an ecclesiastical seminary. He was parish priest at Stone from 1877 to 1881, and of Stoke-on-Trent from 1881 to 1887, when creeping paralysis forced his retirement from active work. He died at the presbytery in Stoke on 3 March 1907 and was buried at Oscott cemetery. His three sons and three daughters all predeceased him. The only one who survived into adulthood became a Dominican nun at Stone.<br>
<br>Northcote's most lasting literary legacy was his work on the Roman catacombs, first adumbrated in articles for <span class="italic">The Rambler</span> (January and July 1860). His most substantial scholarly publication, <span class="italic">Roma sotteranea, or, An Account of the Roman Catacombs</span> (1869), based on G. B. De Rossi's <span class="italic">Roma sotteranea</span>, was revised for a much expanded edition in 1879, which took account of De Rossi's important later work. De Rossi himself contributed a preface in which he praised Northcote for having &#145;remodelled&#146; his own work to produce &#145;a new and partly an original book&#146;. Northcote also published some popular guides to the catacombs as well as other devotional and controversial volumes. He was awarded the degree of DD by Pope Pius IX in January 1861.<br>
