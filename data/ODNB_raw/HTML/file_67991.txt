<span class="headword">Philip ap Rhys</span> <span class="st"> [Philipp Ryse]</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1547&#150;1559), <span class="occ">organist and composer</span>, was apparently of Welsh descent, although all available biographical information refers to London. According to the churchwardens' accounts of St Mary-at-Hill, near Billingsgate in the city of London, &#145;Philipp Ryse, organ player&#146; received wages of &pound;2 15<i>s</i>. for the three months ending at Christmas 1547. St Mary-at-Hill engaged a number of significant musicians in the first half of the sixteenth century, including Thomas Tallis, and had musical connections with the Chapel Royal and St Paul's Cathedral. It is not known when Philip ap Rhys arrived at St Mary-at-Hill, for there is a gap in the accounts between 1540 and 1547, but his engagement appears to have ceased at Christmas 1547. It is just possible that he was related to Ryse William who was paid 6<i>s</i>. 8<i>d</i>. for keeping the organ daily at the Lady mass for three months also in 1547&#150;8. (An older, apparently unconnected Phylip ap Rice is named in the churchwardens' accounts of St Martin Outwich in 1508&#150;9 as owing 16<i>s</i>., and in 1522&#150;3 as one of two wardens &#145;of our lady bretherhed&#146;.)<br>
<br>In 1559, as a musician at St Paul's Cathedral, Philip ap Rhys subscribed to the <span class="roman">Acts of Supremacy and Uniformity</span> on the visitation of the royal commissioners; his signature takes the Welsh form, &#145;philip apryse&#146;, and is preserved on the document in LPL, Cartae miscellaneae xiii/57. He is most likely &#145;mr philip of poles&#146; who was paid 16<i>d</i>. &#145;for playing at organs one evensong&#151;the xvii daie of July, at the Salutaction&#146; at St Mary-at-Hill in 1559, and is undoubtedly the composer of keyboard music found in BL, Add. MS 29996 attributed to &#145;phelyppe apprys Off Saynt poulls in london&#146;. It is assumed that he left St Mary-at-Hill at Christmas 1547 in order to succeed John Redford, organist and almoner of St Paul's, who died in late October or early November 1547. There is no known record of his appointment, nor of his death, which must have been after 1559.<br>
<br>Philip's musical significance rests on the liturgical compositions for organ, found uniquely in BL, Add. MS 29996, and specifically on the survival of the only largely complete British organ mass, a genre better known on the continent, in which the organ plays sections of the mass in alternation with sung plainsong (or polyphony based on the chant). However, there are signs that this mass was compiled, rather than composed, as a cycle. The scribe copied five of six intended pieces as a coherent group: <span class="roman">Kyrie</span>, <span class="roman">Gloria</span>, offertory <span class="italic">Benedictus sit Deus Pater</span>, <span class="roman">Sanctus</span>, and <span class="roman">Agnus Dei</span>; there is a blank opening after the <span class="roman">Gloria</span>, with the title <span class="roman">Credo</span>. The offertory is headed &#145;in die Sancte Trinitatis&#146;, and the whole cycle may have been intended for use on Trinity Sunday. However, the plainchant melodies used for the <span class="roman">Sanctus</span> and <span class="roman">Agnus Dei</span> are not those normally associated with that feast, suggesting that they may originally have come from a different cycle.<br>
<br>Philip ap Rhys is given some prominence in this important mid-sixteenth-century source of liturgical organ music: his setting of the Miserere is placed at the very beginning, and he is one of only two composers whose place of work is noted. That the copyist found it necessary to explain that St Paul's was in London (rather than using the common abbreviation, &#145;Poulls&#146;) suggests that the manuscript may have been compiled or intended for use in the provinces. It was later owned by Thomas Tomkins (<i>d</i>. 1656), born in St David's as son of the organist there, and himself appointed organist of Worcester Cathedral in 1596. There is therefore a possibility that it may have been intended for a church in Wales or on the Welsh borders. All of the compositions by Philip ap Rhys are in the earliest layer of the manuscript, along with works by John Redford and several other composers associated with St Mary-at-Hill in the 1540s. None of the music by Philip ap Rhys is taxing to play or especially striking, and it may have been written out for teaching purposes.<br>
