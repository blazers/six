<span class="headword">Smith,  Lancelot Grey Hugh</span>  (1870&#150;1941), <span class="occ">stockbroker</span>, was born on 4 August 1870 at 71 Princes Gate, Kensington, London, one of the six sons of Hugh Colin Smith (1836&#150;1910), merchant and banker, and his wife, Constance Maria Josepha Adeane. Both parents came of distinguished and large families; his father was a great-grandson of Abel Smith, who established the bank of Smith, Payne, and Smiths in London, as well as opening branches of the (Nottingham-based) Smiths Bank in Lincoln and Hull. H. C. Smith founded the Hays Wharf Company, an important firm of Thames wharfingers, owned by the family, and he became a director of the Bank of England in 1876 and was its governor in 1897&#150;8. Smith's mother was the daughter of H. J. Adeane and his wife, Maud, daughter of John Thomas Stanley, first Baron Stanley of Alderley.<br>
<br>Lancelot Smith was educated at Eton College and at Trinity College, Cambridge, though he left Cambridge in 1889 without taking a degree. He spent some time in the family businesses, the Hays Wharf Company in London and Smiths Bank in Derby, before visiting the USA in 1897. On that visit he struck up a friendship with Jack Morgan, son of Pierpont Morgan, senior partner of J. P. Morgan &amp; Co. in New York and J. S. Morgan &amp; Co. (later Morgan Grenfell) in London. It was through this friendship that Lancelot's brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36165/', "Vivian Hugh Smith (later Lord Bicester)")</script> joined J. S. Morgan &amp; Co. in London in 1905.<br>
<br>When he returned from America, Smith, against the wishes of his father, joined the then newly established stockbroking firm of Rowe and Pitman. Tradition has it that the two partners, George D. Rowe and Frederick Pitman, who were both keen oarsmen, needed a non-rowing person to look after the office during the Henley regatta. Lancelot, or Lancey as he became known in the City, fitted the bill in that respect, but of course he offered much more to a new stockbroking firm seeking business. Well known in the City of London and beyond, the ramifications of the Smith clan&#151;consisting not only of his brothers (who came to be strategically placed in Morgan Grenfell and Hambros Bank) but also of his numerous cousins&#151;gave Lancey useful connections in many institutions across the City. Indeed, it has been suggested that all the immense stock-exchange business of the Hugh Smith clan poured through Rowe and Pitman. Stockbroking, it turned out, suited Smith. Summing up his skills, the stockbroker Alfred Wagg noted:<blockquote>He certainly had not got the ability of several other members of his family. He had no patience with detail, but he had great flair. He seemed to possess the gift of being able to &#145;smell out&#146; that a security was attractive before it even occurred to other people. (Kynaston, 312)</blockquote>In 1910 Smith met the young Jean Rhys [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/31833/', "Williams, Ella Gwendoline Rees (1890&#150;1979)")</script>], then a chorus girl, and later a novelist. She became his mistress, but the liaison lasted only just over two years before Smith terminated it, and &#145;paid her off&#146; with a small allowance. He was, according to her biographer, the love of her life, and in her novel, <span class="italic">Voyage in the Dark</span> (1934), she wrote an affectionate portrait of him as Walter Jeffries. During the First World War Smith served for a time in 1914 as a lieutenant in the Westminster dragoons. He was sent in 1915 as the principal delegate in the British mission to Sweden, and in 1917 he was made a CBE. When he returned he was appointed chairman of the Tobacco Control Board. At the end of the war he returned to Rowe and Pitman.<br>
<br>Smith's flair and his connections in the City continued to benefit the firm; he was a leading partner and ultimately its senior partner. Rowe and Pitman attracted a large number of well-connected and wealthy private clients: Smith's own clients included members of aristocratic and royal families, both British and European; and in the inter-war years he also built up the firm's corporate finance advisory work. Smith had many friends in the City and, Alfred Wagg remembered, also many enemies, offended by his supercilious manner, his tendency to pomposity, and his air of superiority. He never married, and his personal wealth enabled him to own and enjoy several grand houses in London, in Surrey, and in Norfolk. He was a director of the Australian Agricultural Company, and the National Mortgage and Agency Company of New Zealand.<br>
<br>Lancelot Smith died on 23 March 1941 at his home, Old Hall, Garboldisham, Wayland, in Norfolk. In the week following his death a memorial service was held for him at the Savoy Chapel in London.<br>
