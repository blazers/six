<span class="headword">Davis,  Joseph Barnard</span>  (1801&#150;1881), <span class="occ">physician and craniologist</span>, second child of Joseph Davis, draper, and his wife, Marianne, was born on 13 June 1801 and was baptized next day in York. In 1820, while still studying surgery, he went as surgeon on a whaling ship to the Arctic. He qualified LSA in 1823, and on 25 September that year married Elizabeth Haslam in Shelton, Hanley, Staffordshire, where he settled for the rest of his life. They had three children.<br>
<br>Soon after his arrival there Davis was appointed medical officer for the Stoke upon Trent district, and acted as parish medical officer in Shelton until his death. He qualified MRCS in 1843, became FSA in 1854, and graduated MD at St Andrews in 1862. As a Methodist of the New Connexion he was concerned for the underprivileged and with the betterment of social conditions, and his religious beliefs were matched by a liberal outlook on life. The small fee he received as a medical officer meant a reduced lifestyle but despite this he doggedly pursued learned interests. In 1828 he offered to write a history of cholera for the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge, and in 1839 was revising a previous article for them. His commitment to disseminating information was also reflected in <span class="italic">A Popular Manual of the Art of Preserving Health</span> (1836) which dealt with the activities common to most nineteenth-century health regimens&#151;air, diet, exercise, and bathing.<br>
<br>For many years Davis devoted himself to craniology, and gradually accumulated a huge number of skulls and skeletons of various races, most with carefully annotated histories. Although it is unclear if Davis was influenced by the phrenological enthusiasm of the 1820s, like a number of other scientists he thought that significant information could be extracted from the study and measurement of skulls and other skeletal remains. He was elected into the Ethnological Society in 1856, and joined the Anthropological Society on its commencement in 1862. While members of the Ethnological Society had genuinely scientific interests, many of those in the Anthropological Society mixed science with politics in the shape of the behaviour and abilities of living races. Davis seems not to have ventured into print on this aspect, possibly because he was somewhat isolated from the main body of members in London. Besides a valuable memoir on osteology of the Tasmanians, he published numerous papers in <span class="italic">Anthropological Review</span> and the <span class="italic">Journal of the Anthropological Institute</span>. From 1870 he was a joint editor of the <span class="italic">Journal</span> and of <span class="italic">Anthropologia</span>. He was elected FRS in 1868.<br>
<br>In 1856 Davis and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27410/', "John Thurnam")</script> commenced work on their <span class="italic">Crania Britannica</span>, in two volumes, completed in 1865. Supported by a grant from the Royal Society they travelled abroad to gather material to compare with British specimens, many excavated from burial mounds, seen as representing the various races which made up the British population. Davis's own collection of skulls was published in 1867 as <span class="italic">Thesaurus craniorum</span> (1867), delineating many examples and providing 25,000 careful measurements with copious bibliographical references. Davis spared no time or expense in his collecting: he made contact with travellers and collectors throughout the world, amassing eventually a collection larger than the combined material held in other museums. He was very clubbable and by the end of his life had joined almost thirty medical, anthropological, and general scientific societies and associations in America, Italy, Holland, Spain, Russia, Germany, and Austro-Hungary, as a full or corresponding member. These contacts provided him with information and ample opportunity to publish his own work and ideas.<br>
<br>After the death of his first wife Davis married, on 31 July 1878, Emma Moorhouse (<i>b</i>. 1851), a woman who was fifty years his junior. This led to friction with his son Joseph, and in his will he provided that this son of his first marriage should receive his annuity only if he resided outside the county of Staffordshire, and that the executors must ensure that his debts were not charged to the estate.<br>
<br>In 1880 Davis conveyed to the Royal College of Surgeons fourteen complete articulated skeletons, representing various races, and a large quantity of bones, casts, and other objects. He died at his home, 4 Albion Street, Shelton, on 19 May 1881.<br>
