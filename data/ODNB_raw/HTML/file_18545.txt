<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Melville,  David</span>, third earl of Leven and second earl of Melville  (1660&#150;1728), <span class="occ">army officer and politician</span>, was born on 5 May 1660 at Monimail, Fife, third son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18546/', "George Melville, first earl of Melville (1636&#150;1707)")</script>, and Lady Catherine Leslie (1639&#150;1713), daughter of Alexander Leslie, Lord Balgonie and second earl of Leven. In 1677, after the death of his maternal grandfather, the second earl, and of his two aunts, Catherine and Mary (both of whom held the title as countesses in their own right), David Melville claimed the right to succeed as third earl. He was opposed by his kinsman the earl of Rothes who, as lord chancellor, pursued the claim in the court of session until his death and a favourable judgment from Charles II in July 1681. Thereafter David Melville took a seat in the Scottish parliament with a rank equal to that of his father.<br>
<br>When Leven's father fell under suspicion for the Rye House plot, Leven fled with him to the United Provinces in 1683. From there, Leven travelled to Kiel, Hamburg, and Berlin, eventually entering the service of the elector of Brandenburg through the patronage of Sophia, electress of Hanover, accepting the rank of colonel. Leven also acted as the envoy of William of Orange in Berlin, arranging a meeting between the prince and the elector of Brandenburg at Cleves. In 1688 he was granted permission to raise a regiment (the 25th regiment) of Scottish refugees living in the German states and United Provinces, which was used to garrison Plymouth during the prince of Orange's invasion. Subsequently, William sent Leven to Edinburgh as his envoy to the Scottish convention in March 1689.<br>
<br>As part of his mission to Scotland, Leven was commissioned to raise a force of 800 to defend the capital until regular troops arrived from England. Following the departure of Viscount Dundee from the convention, and the declaration of the duke of Gordon that he held Edinburgh Castle for James II, Leven successfully summoned a force which, until the arrival of his own men from Plymouth, calmed the convention and the populace. Having joined General Hugh Mackay to fight against Dundee, Leven raised more troops and was awarded the power to treat with those who surrendered.<br>
<br>At the battle of Killiecrankie (17 July 1689) Leven's regiment, on the far right of the battlefield, held fast while other regiments, including Mackay's, broke and ran in the face of a highlander charge. The composure and courage of the regiment under fire won great respect for Leven, who held them together as they covered the army's retreat to Stirling. When the duke of Gordon surrendered Edinburgh Castle in June 1689, Leven was appointed its keeper, as well as acting as a privy councillor, and as commissioner for forfeiture of estates, for plantation of kirks, and of supply for Perth and Fife. During this period he also spent time on campaign in Flanders with William of Orange, paying his regiment out of his own pocket.<br>
<br>On 3 September 1691 Leven married his first cousin, Anne Wemyss (1675&#150;1702), who joined him in living in Edinburgh Castle. While there, he acquired a seat in the Tron Church and became a patron of local horse-racing. One of his most trying duties, however, was the keeping of Jacobite prisoners, among them lords Seaforth, Breadalbane, and Strathmore. Leven also quarrelled incessantly over castle appointments with the commander-in-chief in Scotland, Sir Thomas Livingstone. Perhaps because of this, and despite his active opposition to the <span class="roman">Act of Security</span> and promotion of the succession of Queen Anne, he was removed from the keeping of the castle in December 1702 and instead named major-general of the Scottish forces. Rewarded in 1704 with the wards that had been in the hands of the crown since 1689, he was also called to London to advise on Scottish affairs. While there he was caught up in the Queensberry plot, in which the second duke of Queensberry, working with Simon Fraser, Lord Lovat, alleged that Leven and others, including lords Seafield, Cromarty, and Tweedale, had through him been in communication with James Stuart, the Jacobite Pretender. Although disproven, this allegation later returned to haunt Leven. In 1705 he returned to Scotland as keeper of Edinburgh Castle, although this time without his wife, who had died on 9 January 1702. This was followed by his appointment as master of ordinance (1705) and commander-in-chief in Scotland (1706). An enthusiastic promoter of the union, in the following year he was chosen as a representative peer, a position he held until 1710. In 1707 he also inherited the title second earl of Melville upon the death of his father and the prior death of his elder brothers. During the Jacobite attempts of 1708 Melville once again had the custody of high-ranking Jacobites in Edinburgh Castle, a job he handled with such discretion that even George Lockhart of Carnwath admitted that he had treated the prisoners civilly and fairly. Melville, however, was a harsh critic of the government's neglect of Scottish fortifications and ordinance, and was stripped of his position as commander-in-chief and governor of the castle in 1712, with considerable arrears in pay.<br>
<br>Melville eagerly greeted the accession of George I, to whom he was known from his time in Brandenburg and through the Electress Sophia. The new king briefly returned his friendship upon his arrival at Greenwich, but this action aroused considerable envy among other courtiers. That same year Simon Fraser revived suspicions first raised during the Queensberry plot when he suggested to Lord Ilay, brother of the duke of Argyll, that, in France, he had had contact with Melville through Jacobite messengers and had sent him medals from the Pretender. Although Melville proved his innocence, suspicion stalled his career. During the rising of 1715 Jacobites seized Melville's house at Balgonie, while government troops rudely searched his Edinburgh house.<br>
<br>With no further royal preferment, Melville fell into debt sufficient to force the sale of family lands and his retirement to Markinch, where he died on 6 June 1728 and was buried six days later. Melville had two sons: George, who married Margaret Carnegie, daughter of the fourth earl of Northesk and predeceased his father, producing a son, David, who became fourth earl of Leven and third earl of Melville; and Alexander, who succeeded his nephew as fifth earl of Leven and fourth earl of Melville. He also had two daughters, Mary, who married William, second earl of Aberdeen, and Margaret, who died in infancy.<br>
