<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Warner <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Huddart]</span>,  Mary Amelia</span>  (1804&#150;1854), <span class="occ">actress and theatre manager</span>, was born in Manchester, the daughter of Thomas Huddart (<i>d</i>. 1831), a Dublin chemist turned actor, and his wife, Ann, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Gough, of Limerick. Huddart had acted briefly at the Crow Street Theatre, Dublin, before appearing in London at the Theatre Royal, Covent Garden, in October 1798 as Othello and enjoying some success later in provincial theatres. After playing at Greenwich for her father's benefit, Mary Huddart joined John Brunton's company at the reputed age of fifteen, appearing at Plymouth, Exeter, Bristol, and Birmingham. She is said to have played also at the Surrey and Tottenham Street theatres in London. In 1829 she joined the company at the Theatre Royal, Dublin, and on 22 November 1830, as Miss Huddart from Dublin, appeared at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, as Belvidera in Thomas Otway's <span class="italic">Venice Preserv'd</span>, having been recommended to the managers, Captain Polhill and Alexander Lee, by W. C. Macready, who took the part of Pierre. Macready's diaries suggest that there was for a time a strong mutual attraction, and, despite his growing criticisms of her, both professional and personal, their friendship lasted until her death.<br>
<br>Among the parts played by Huddart in her first season were Emma in Sheridan Knowles's <span class="italic">William Tell</span>, Alicia in Nicholas Rowe's <span class="italic">Jane Shore</span>, and Constance in <span class="italic">King John</span>. She was also the original Queen Elswith in Knowles's <span class="italic">Alfred the Great</span>. She then returned to Dublin and played leading roles under Granby Calcraft. In 1836, under Alfred Bunn's management, she was again at Drury Lane, where she supported the American actor Edwin Forrest in John Galt's <span class="italic">Lady Macbeth</span> and was the original Marian in Knowles's <span class="italic">Daughter</span>, then called <span class="italic">The Wrecker's Daughter</span>. This led to her engagement at the Haymarket Theatre for the first production in London of <span class="italic">The Bridal</span>, on 26 June 1837. The play was an adaptation by Macready and Knowles of <span class="italic">The Maid's Tragedy</span>, in which Huddart appeared as Evadne with Macready as Melantius. She also played Portia to Samuel Phelps's Shylock and Helen McGregor to his Rob Roy. On 6 July 1837, at St George's, Bloomsbury, she married Robert William Warner, formerly the landlord of The Wrekin tavern, Broad Court, Bow Street, a haunt of actors and journalists, who had become bankrupt four months earlier. Warner described his subsequent role as making engagements for his wife and escorting her to and from rehearsals and performances.<br>
<br>In the autumn of 1837 Mrs Warner joined Macready's company at Covent Garden, where she stayed for two years, supporting him in many Shakespearian parts and gaining in reputation. She was the original Joan of Arc in T. J. Serle's play of that name. Premature labour prevented her from playing at Covent Garden the heroine of Thomas Talfourd's <span class="italic">The Athenian Captive</span>, but she took the part at the Haymarket on 4 August 1838. She was again in Macready's company when he took the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, in the autumn of 1841, and played the Queen in <span class="italic">Hamlet</span> (29 April 1842), and the original Lady Lydia Lynterne in Westland Marston's <span class="italic">The Patrician's Daughter</span> (10 December 1842). In 1843 she acted with Phelps in Bath, and on 27 May 1844, with him and T. L. Greenwood, began the memorable management of Sadler's Wells Theatre, London, in which they sought to make the theatre &#145;a place for justly representing the works of our great dramatic poets&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Era</span>, 1 Oct 1854). She spoke the address, by Serle, on the opening night, when she played Lady Macbeth.<br>
<br>During the first season Mrs Warner appeared in many roles, including those of Mrs Oakley in Colman's <span class="italic">The Jealous Wife</span>, Gertrude in <span class="italic">Hamlet</span>, Lady Allworth in Kemble's <span class="italic">A New Way to Pay Old Debts</span>, Queen Margaret in <span class="italic">Richard III</span>, Portia in <span class="italic">The Merchant of Venice</span>, Evadne in <span class="italic">The Bridal</span>, Lady Frugal in Massinger's <span class="italic">City Madam</span>, Queen Katharine in <span class="italic">Henry VIII</span>, and Madeline in Serle's <span class="italic">The Priest's Daughter</span>. On 21 May 1845 she played Madame Chateaupres in Sullivan's <span class="italic">The King's Friend</span>. During the 1845&#150;6 season she again took many parts, including Julie in Bulwer Lytton's <span class="italic">Richelieu</span>, Belvidera in <span class="italic">Venice Preserv'd</span>, Elvira in Sheridan's <span class="italic">Pizarro</span>, Hermione in <span class="italic">The Winter's Tale</span>, Clara Douglas in Bulwer Lytton's <span class="italic">Money</span>, and Alicia in <span class="italic">Jane Shore</span>. She then retired from the management of Sadler's Wells, and, in a spirit of apparent rivalry, undertook that of the Marylebone Theatre off the Edgware Road, then described as &#145;one of the prettiest minor theatres in London&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 31 Aug 1847). She opened on 30 August 1847 with <span class="italic">The Winter's Tale</span> and a farce, <span class="italic">The Windmill</span>, by Thomas Morton junior. She aimed, as at Sadler's Wells, to provide productions of Shakespeare based on the authentic text. She also sought historical accuracy in costume and set. Perhaps unwisely, she took parts better suited to a younger actress, such as Julia in Knowles's <span class="italic">The Hunchback</span>, Lady Teazle in Sheridan's <span class="italic">The School for Scandal</span>, and Lady Townly in Cibber and Vanbrugh's <span class="italic">The Provoked Husband</span>. In November she revived <span class="italic">The Scornful Lady</span> of Beaumont and Fletcher, altered by Serle, in which she played the Lady; and in April 1848 she put on Serle's <span class="italic">The Double Marriage</span>, playing Juliana. Macready starred with the company that month, but the theatre closed on 9 May with a reputed loss of &pound;5000. Mrs Warner then returned to the Haymarket, where she supported Macready during his farewell performances before his departure for America. On 28 July 1851 Sadler's Wells was opened for a few nights before the beginning of the regular season to give Mrs Warner an opportunity of playing her best-known characters before also starting for America. What proved to be her last appearance in England was made in August, as Mrs Oakley in <span class="italic">The Jealous Wife</span>. She met with great success in America, but after developing cancer she travelled to England in 1852 for an operation, and then revisited New York. There she became too ill to fulfil her engagements, and she returned to London in June 1853, gravely ill. On 10 December 1853, through her husband, she applied for protection to the insolvent debtors' court, where it was reported that a fund had been established on her behalf by a group of friends, among them Dickens and Macready. Subscribers to this included the queen and Angela Burdett-Coutts. A benefit at Sadler's Wells brought her &pound;150. Miss Burdett-Coutts undertook the charge of a daughter and Macready of her son, John Lawrence Warner, who later tried but failed to make a career as an actor. Mrs Warner died on 24 September 1854 at her home, 16 Euston Place, Euston Square, and was buried on 2 October at Highgate cemetery. Despite child bearing and a perennial burden of debt, Mrs Warner sustained leading roles in the principal London theatres for some fifteen years, most notably in tragedies, and was ranked second only to Helen Faucit (Lady Martin) and Mrs Charles Kean (Ellen Kean). She was equally good in pathos and in tragic emotion. Her chief success was obtained as Evadne, in which role Dickens described her as a &#145;defiant splendid Sin&#146;. Both energy and intensity were at her disposal, though she was open to the charge of ranting. In management she followed Macready and Phelps in insisting on the original text of Shakespeare's plays, although she was happy to accept contemporary versions of other stage classics. Macready spoke of &#145;a sympathy in her friendship, a strong good sense in her observations and an acuteness of penetration that makes her society soothing and pleasing&#146;  (<span class="italic">Diaries</span>, 1.196), but later referred to her mind &#145;never very elevated, undergoing a process of vulgarization&#146;  (ibid., 2.357).<br>
