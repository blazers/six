<span class="headword">Lower, Sir  William</span>  (<em>c.</em>1570&#150;1615), <span class="occ">politician and natural philosopher</span>, was the eldest of the six sons of Thomas Lower and his wife, Jane, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Reskimer, minor Cornish gentry of St Winnow, near Lostwithiel. His father &#145;thrust forth his sonnes to be trayned in martiall knowledge and exercise for the publike service of the country&#146;  (MacLean, 3.378). In 1586 Lower matriculated at Exeter College, Oxford, where he maintained a connection at least until 1593. In 1589 he entered the Middle Temple, where he was penalized on several occasions for riotous behaviour. He became member of parliament in 1601 for Bodmin, and in 1604 was returned&#151;for seven years&#151;as member for Lostwithiel. The same year he and his brothers Nicholas and Francis were knighted by James I. Lower married Penelope, the daughter of Sir Thomas Perrott and stepdaughter of Henry Percy, ninth earl of Northumberland, at some unknown date, most likely following his move to London in 1601 since Penelope, apparently, was only twenty-five when Lower died in 1615. His marriage brought him about 3000 acres in Carmarthenshire, with a home farm in Tra'venti, near Laugharne. Percy and Walter Ralegh&#151;who was a friend of Thomas Perrott's&#151;were both patrons of the mathematician and natural philosopher Thomas Harriot. It was most likely through these connections that Lower and Harriot became acquainted and that Lower began to study astronomy, mathematics, and alchemy under Harriot's tutelage.<br>
<br>Nine letters survive from Lower to Harriot, spanning the period 1607&#150;11. They reveal that Lower studied advanced algebra, geometry, and trigonometry, read Kepler in Latin and repeated many of Kepler's calculations, used a telescope in 1610 to observe the heavens, made a celestial sphere from &#145;the desolution of a hogshead&#146; and discussed these matters with Harriot as well as with other &#145;Traventane philosophers&#146;  (<span class="italic">Miscellaneous Works</span>, 25&#150;6, 28, 42&#150;5). In a letter to Harriot, Lower has left a record of the cross-staff observations which he made of the comet of 1607, later known as Halley's comet. His suggestion in 1610 to Harriot that Kepler's elliptical orbits for the planets might also apply to comets may be the earliest surviving record of what is now the accepted theory of comet orbits.<br>
<br>Lower's presence with Northumberland at a dinner on 4 November 1605, the eve of the Gunpowder Plot, led to his interrogation concerning the conversation at dinner. His association with the disgraced Ralegh and Percy, and with Harriot, who was under suspicion of atheism, must have made his position difficult. He had other problems: in a letter of 1611 to Harriot, following a discussion of trigonometry and Kepler, Lower concluded, &#145;I have lost my second boy also, and wel neere eighty catle of the murraine, and they die still; now you know all my discomforts and losses&#146;  (Halliwell, 40). He died at Tra'venti on 12 April 1615, on the same day as his mother, Jane, leaving his wife, a daughter, Dorothy, and a posthumous son, Thomas. Although he has no scientific achievement or publication to his credit Lower was a competent astronomer and mathematician and a stimulus to Harriot. His letters capture the excitement generated among natural philosophers by Kepler's discovery of elliptic orbits, the invention of the telescope, Galileo's telescopic discoveries, and the new symbolic algebra.<br>
