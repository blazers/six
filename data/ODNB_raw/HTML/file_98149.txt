<span class="headword">Kelly, Sir  (William Archibald) Howard</span>  (1873&#150;1952), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, was born in Southsea, Hampshire, on 6 September 1873, the third son of Lieutenant-Colonel Henry Holdsworth Kelly, Royal Marine artillery, and his wife, Elizabeth, daughter of Johm Collum of Bellevue, co. Fermanagh. His elder brother was Admiral of the Fleet <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/34266/', "Sir John Donald Kelly (1871&#150;1936)")</script>. He entered the navy in January 1886 as a cadet in HMS <i>Britannia</i> and in 1888 joined the battleship <i>Temeraire</i>. Kelly became a sub-lieutenant in September 1892 and served as navigator in the gunboats <i>Firefly</i> and <i>Onyx</i> at Harwich and the gunboat <i>Hebe</i> in the Mediterranean. He was promoted lieutenant in December 1894 and in May 1896 was in the sailing sloop <i>Cruiser</i>, used for training seamen in the Mediterranean. In January 1899 he joined as navigator another training ship, the corvette <i>Calliope</i>, followed by service in the cruiser <i>Spartiate</i>. In May 1903 he qualified as an interpreter in French, an ability that would have important results for his later career.<br>
<br>In July 1903 Kelly was selected as navigating officer and first lieutenant of the cruiser <i>Hyacinth</i>, the flagship of Rear-Admiral G. L. Atkinson-Willes, commander-in-chief of the East Indies station. He participated in the Somaliland campaign, earning the Africa general service medal with Somaliland 1902&#150;4 bar, and was promoted commander in December 1904. Kelly was still in <i>Hyacinth</i> when she became the flagship of Vice-Admiral Sir Edmund Po&euml;, whose daughter Nora (<i>d</i>. 1951) he married in 1907. They had one son and one daughter.<br>
<br>Kelly next served in the battleships <i>Russell</i> and <i>Nile</i>, followed by a period in the naval intelligence department at the Admiralty as head of the French section. He commanded the third-class cruiser <i>Barham</i> in the Mediterranean, 1910&#150;11, and in February 1911 was appointed naval attach&eacute; in Paris. There he was greatly embarrassed when the French minister of marine referred to earlier secret staff conversations between the British and French staffs, assuming that Kelly had been informed of them. After returning to London he was ready to offer his resignation, regarding his position as untenable if the Admiralty did not take him into their confidence. In fact the information the Admiralty actually had on hand was vague and Kelly on his return to Paris was obliged to ask the French for their copy of the record to &#145;correct discrepancies&#146; in the virtually non-existent Admiralty records. The tempo of the conversations with the French increased after the Agadir crisis of 1911, although in 1912 Kelly's paper advocating an alliance with France did not meet with favour at the Foreign Office. In 1913 Prince Louis of Battenburg, the first sea lord, travelled to Paris incognito for talks with his French counterpart but until the outbreak of war there would be no binding commitment on the part of the British. Nevertheless the very fact that the talks were taking place tended to create a moral obligation to go to the assistance of the French in the event of war. Kelly was promoted captain in December 1911 and in a major public manifestation of the Anglo-French entente was attached to the suite of the French president, Raymond Poincar&eacute;, during the latter's state visit to Great Britain in June 1913.<br>
<br>In March 1914 Kelly was appointed to command the light cruiser <i>Gloucester</i> in the Mediterranean Fleet. As war became imminent in the summer of 1914 the greatest threat to the British and French in the Mediterranean was the German <i>Mittelmeerdivision</i> consisting of the powerful new battle cruiser <i>Goeben</i> and the light cruiser <i>Breslau</i>. The situation was complicated by the uncertain attitude of Italy, then an ally of Germany and Austria-Hungary in the triple alliance. <i>Goeben</i> and <i>Breslau</i> had made use of the Italian port of Messina and <i>Gloucester</i> had been detached to watch the southern entrance to the Strait of Messina. Italy's declaration of neutrality at the beginning of August 1914 clarified the situation but the German movements were uncertain. Kelly detected the two German ships passing through the Strait of Messina on 6 August and shadowed them for over a day and a half, reporting their movements by wireless, exchanging fire with the <i>Breslau</i> but keeping out of range of the powerful guns of the <i>Goeben</i>, which could easily have destroyed the <i>Gloucester</i>. Kelly, whose cruiser was running low on coal, was eventually ordered to break off the chase and the German ships made their escape to the Dardanelles where their presence in Turkish waters was an important (although not the only) factor in Turkey's entry into the war on the side of Germany and Austria on 29 October. Kelly's conduct was the only bright spot in the otherwise dismal British performance during the episode, which led to criticism of the two commanders, Berkeley Milne and Ernest Troubridge. Winston Churchill, first lord of the Admiralty, personally wrote the citation praising Kelly's &#145;combination of audacity with restraint&#146; in a &#145;naval episode which may justly be regarded as a model&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 15 Sept 1952). Kelly was made CB in April 1915 for his actions.<br>
<br>Kelly and the <i>Gloucester</i> remained in the Mediterranean or the Indian Ocean before being ordered to join the 2nd light cruiser squadron of the Grand Fleet in December 1914. In January 1916 he was called for several weeks to the intelligence division at the Admiralty but was back in the <i>Gloucester</i> by March. It was only a short stay, for the following month he relinquished his command and was sent to Paris to serve as naval liaison officer with the French. His time in Paris coincided with the growing problem of German submarines and a preoccupation with countering the menace. In the summer of 1917 he was ordered to take command as a commodore second class of the British light cruisers at Brindisi in the southern Adriatic. As a result of the agreements bringing Italy into the war the British and French had been obliged to provide naval assistance to the Italians, and a mixed force of British warships and French destroyers co-operated with the Italians. They were joined in 1918 by American &#145;submarine chasers&#146;. The Italians, however, insisted that supreme command in the Adriatic remain in their hands. A large portion of the initial British contribution had consisted of drifters who attempted to snare submarines in their nets and force them to the surface. This evolved into the so-called Otranto barrage, an attempt to bar the Otranto Straits to the passage of German and Austrian submarines working from bases in the Adriatic. The barrage grew more and more elaborate although its effectiveness remained doubtful.<br>
<br>In April 1918 a reorganization took place and Kelly became &#145;commodore commanding British Adriatic forces&#146;, with detailed control of operations on the barrage and command of all British seagoing and air forces in the Adriatic, but with the obligation to keep both the British Mediterranean and Italian commanders-in-chief informed of his actions. It was a convoluted situation and hard to avoid friction. Kelly's problems remained even after the armistice for the Adriatic became the scene of intense and bitter rivalry between the Italians and the new south Slav state, supported by the French. The British, with a multitude of problems elsewhere, were forced to remain as peacekeepers.<br>
<br>Kelly returned to England in April 1919 but his now proven ability to act in international situations led to his appointment as head of the British naval mission to Greece with the rank of vice-admiral in the Royal Hellenic Navy. It was not an easy position, for the Greeks were sharply divided between royalist and anti-royalist forces and efforts for reform were further hampered by the military operations in Asia Minor as the Greeks sought to expand their areas of control. The effort led eventually to disaster in 1922 but Kelly's period in Greece had ended in October 1921. He was promoted rear-admiral in May 1922 and in May 1923 became rear-admiral in the 1st battle squadron of the Atlantic Fleet. In 1924 he was charged with revising the fleet's signal books as head of the signal books committee. He commanded the 2nd cruiser squadron in the Atlantic Fleet, May 1925 &#150; May 1927, and was promoted to vice-admiral in July 1927. Kelly was again chosen for a diplomatic position in July 1927, with a two-year appointment as British naval representative at the League of Nations in Geneva. This was followed in May 1929 with appointment as vice-admiral commanding 1st battle squadron and second-in-command, Mediterranean station.<br>
<br>Kelly finally achieved a truly independent command in December 1930 when he was appointed commander-in-chief in China. During his first year what was probably the most controversial event of his career took place. On the night of 11 November 1931 the minesweeping sloop <i>Petersfield</i>, used as the commander-in-chief's yacht, ran aground and became a total loss. Kelly with his wife and daughter had taken passage in the ship and during the subsequent court martial of her captain it was revealed that the autocratic Kelly had frequently intervened with navigational instructions. When poor visibility altered the situation <i>Petersfield</i>'s captain had been afraid or unwilling either to deviate from those instructions concerning the course or to rouse the admiral, who had retired to bed. The court martial found against the officer concerned but opinion on the China station was sharply divided between those who felt Kelly had stifled the initiative of his officers and those who believed, as the court martial did, that the ultimate responsibility belonged with the commanding officer to take measures to ensure the safety of his ship when circumstances changed. The affair was made all the worse by the attention the press devoted to it.<br>
<br>Kelly, who had been promoted admiral and knighted in 1931, was faced with a severe challenge at the end of January 1932 when the Japanese, apparently on the initiative of their local naval commander, attacked the Chinese at Shanghai, where there was a considerable British presence in the international settlement. The threat of war was great, especially since relations between Japan and the western powers supporting the League of Nations had been strained by Japanese aggression in Manchuria during 1931. Kelly, who had been away in Batavia in his flagship, returned at full speed, cabled for reinforcements, and over the next few weeks entered into personal negotiations to bring about a ceasefire. There were those in the Foreign Office and War Office in London who found Kelly's telegrams alarmist and his actions precipitate but by his combination of firmness and tact (including recognition of the Japanese need to save face) he was able to arrange a ceasefire between the two sides, and the British minister in China, Sir Miles Lampson, was subsequently able to broker a formal agreement.<br>
<br>Kelly, while commander-in-chief, also sent warnings about the &#145;deplorable&#146; situation of the defences of the Singapore base and its consequent vulnerability. He relinquished his command in 1933 but found no further active employment and was placed on the retired list in 1936 after a career of fifty years. He took an active part in the Royal Central Asian Society and Anglo-Hellenic League before being recalled to active service in 1940 and sent to Ankara as the personal representative of the Mediterranean commander-in-chief, Admiral Sir Andrew Cunningham. He reportedly became well known in leading Turkish circles and a friend of the former chief of the Turkish general staff, with whom he played bridge regularly. Turkey did not enter the war on the allied side until February 1945, but the manner in which the Turks interpreted their neutrality was favourable to the British. Kelly returned from Turkey in July 1944 and reverted to the retired list that December. He resumed his role as an active member of the Royal Central Asian Society and was chairman in 1950. He died at the Middlesex Hospital, London, on 14 September 1952.<br>
<br>Kelly was an imposing and intellectual officer with high standards and firm opinions who did not suffer fools easily and on occasion had a sharp tongue. He was a great contrast to his brother Sir John (Joe) Kelly, known for his congeniality, though reportedly not nearly as bright. This could account for the fact that unlike his brother Joe he never became a sea lord or received a major port command at home. There may have been a lingering effect of the <i>Petersfield</i> affair, and Kelly might also have been considered too uncomfortable to work with. On the other hand a naval career of over fifty years with retirement as a full admiral cannot be considered unsuccessful. Naval historians tend to remember him best for his conduct of the <i>Gloucester</i> in 1914 but his other missions or commands in an international context were equally if not more important.<br>
