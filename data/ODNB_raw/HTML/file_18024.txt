<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Mara <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Schmeling]</span>,  Gertrud Elisabeth</span>  (1749&#150;1833), <span class="occ">singer</span>, was born in Kassel, Germany, on 23 February 1749, the daughter of the violinist Johann Schmeling. She received her early musical education from her father, who trained her as a violinist. He subsequently exhibited her as a child prodigy in many countries of Europe, including the Netherlands, Germany, and England. On the advice of some London ladies, she abandoned the instrument, regarding it as unladylike, and took up singing. Her first lessons, while profitable, were fraught with difficulty; she was removed from the so-called care of the London master Pietro Domenico Paradies 
    (formerly Paradisi; 1707&#150;1791)
  , who was said to have been less than discreet in their pupil&#150;teacher relationship, although the details of his aberration are unknown. Her soprano voice was soon noted for its brilliance, rapid execution, and wide range. As a diva, she was unusual in that she sang in tune and kept accurate time. The brilliance and rapid execution appear to have come from subsequent lessons in Leipzig with Johann Adam Hiller, to whom her accurate time-keeping can also be attributed; his course of instruction included work as a keyboard player, and her study culminated in public performances of harpsichord concertos. There can be no doubt that this conservatory-style training was one of the chief causes of her ability to survive well past the usual age in the less than kind career of a professional singer. However, she was considered to be an extremely poor actress, a factor which was doubtless responsible for the large number of concert and oratorio engagements she undertook, including a close association with the Lenten oratorio season.<br>
<br>Schmeling's personal appearance was the subject of comment by many, and was not prepossessing; Burney, describing her aged twenty-three, thought her &#145;short and not handsome&#146;  (Highfill, Burnim &amp; Langhans, <span class="italic">BDA</span>) with irregular teeth, but commented on her good humour, which &#145;rendered her addresses <i>very</i> engaging&#146;  (ibid.). These physical drawbacks were probably the result of malnutrition; there is evidence that she had rickets in her early childhood, and her father's business as a freelance musician and repairer of instruments suggests if not poverty, at least periods of hardship.<br>
<br>Throughout her career, Schmeling was dogged by controversies both manufactured and otherwise, and her capricious behaviour was destructive both personally and professionally. Perhaps it was the security and wealth she had acquired when she was taken up by Frederick the Great, king of Prussia, in 1771 as a permanent court singer at Berlin and Potsdam on a salary for life (reputed to be in the order of 11,250 francs), or perhaps it was the sudden privileges of being a court <i>prima donna</i>, but whatever the reason, she proceeded to live the role of the diva to the full. Against all advice and objections from the king, she married in 1772 Giovanni Battista Mara (1744&#150;<i>c</i>.1808), who as a husband proved to be what all those who objected to him thought he would be; an uncouth womanizer, a sub-standard musician, and more attached to alcohol than to his wife. According to Mozart, at a concert in Munich in 1780 Mme Mara, her husband, the orchestra, and the conductor were involved in a public row on the concert platform before the elector of Bavaria. She was restive in Berlin, and antagonized Frederick, who finally released her from her contract. She travelled via a number of cities to Paris, where in 1782 she immediately entered into rivalry with the Portuguese mezzo-soprano Luiza Todi. French musical society divided into the &#145;Maratistes&#146; and the &#145;Todistes&#146; in a debate which was conducted with wit and panache.<br>
<br>Mara's London d&eacute;but in 1784 was a triumph. It was witnessed by Mrs Papendiek, who noted that:<blockquote>the <i>tutti</i> or symphony of the air commenced, and led up in a crescendo to a high note, upon which Mara began. She held it for a few bars, then brought it to a long shake, and from it ran down an octave or more in notes as clear as bells. When she had finished her song the excitement was intense. The people almost screamed. (Papendiek, 1.215&#150;16)</blockquote>The performance earned her the recognition of the prince of Wales (afterwards George IV), although he was not, as he later claimed, the first to recognize her talents.<br>
<br>Mara was soon engaged for a short series at the Pantheon, which was a financial failure; Charles Burney blamed the general election. This did not stop the Mara star ascending, and she was in demand to sing opera and oratorio alike, appearing both in the Pantheon concerts and in the concerts of the Academy of Ancient Music. In February 1786 she made her d&eacute;but at the King's Theatre, where she appeared until 1792; her roles included Dircea in <span class="italic">L'usurpatore innocente</span>, Cleofide in <span class="italic">La generosit&agrave; d'Alessandro</span>, and the title role in <span class="italic">Dido, queen of Carthage</span> by Prince Hoare and Stephen Storace. She also excelled in Handel roles such as Cleopatra in <span class="italic">Giulio Cesare</span>. As her voice declined, she took on a number of roles in ballad opera, such as Polly in John Gay's <span class="italic">The Beggar's Opera</span> and Rosetta in <span class="italic">Love in a Village</span> by Isaac Bickerstaff and Thomas Arne. She also made a number of continental forays to fulfil prestigious singing engagements. During this period her husband, who had accompanied her to London, found work in the London orchestras.<br>
<br>It was not long before a new London rivalry grew up, this time between Mara and the great Elizabeth Billington. The London press loved, fomented, and sometimes created this sort of polarized competition, but as far as the Mara&#150;Billington axis is concerned, their careers naturally followed similar paths&#151;so much so, in fact, that not only was the most famous role for both sopranos&#151;the part of Mandane in Arne's <span class="italic">Artaxerxes</span>&#151;performed with &#145;the anticipated and pleasing labour of encores&#146;  (Bacon, 219), but attempts were made to personalize it in a competitive manner by the addition of numerous extra songs; this claim is borne out by the numerous published song sheets of their additional arias.<br>
<br>Mara's English career was blighted by professional incidents. Although she sang successfully at the 1784 Handel commemoration, in 1785 the press were outraged at her &#145;insolent&#146; behaviour (she laughed during the rehearsals) and at her leaving the abbey before the end of the performance. Her attempts to organize a subscription series which challenged the Professional Concert&#151;referred to by the newspaper <span class="italic">The Register</span> in November 1785 as the &#145;Hanover Square phalanx&#146;&#151;met a hostile reaction in the press; she appears to have mishandled some of the administration, laying herself open to charges of deception, of being a dishonest foreigner, of employing only foreigners, and of being a profiteer. By June she was singing in Oxford, where her insistence on leaving the stage after she had sung and her refusal to stand up during the choruses led to her being hissed and booed and ordered to leave the Sheldonian Theatre by the vice-chancellor. She publicly apologized, offering a chronic problem with her leg as an excuse, and carefully placed articles, mostly written by John Taylor, seem to have had some effect. But the following year she was pilloried in a vicious caricature entitled the &#145;Wapping Concert&#146;, an illustration which shows her sitting, and referring to &#145;Le Genou Inflexible, or (Stiff Knee) which prevents her standing&#146;  (Highfill, Burnim &amp; Langhans, <span class="italic">BDA</span>). By April 1787 she was being attacked again, this time because she was refusing to sing in the Handel commemoration that year in protest at the request by the dean and chapter of Westminster Abbey for &pound;1200 to be deducted before the proceeds were given to charity. Her oratorio performances were cancelled by order of George III in the same year because they clashed with performances by the Academy of Ancient Music, an event which inspired a vicious poem by John Wolcot, which also made use of the stiff knee image.<br>
<br>However, Mara's voice was universally praised, and most contemporary essays and discussions of vocal technique refer to her on at least one occasion, and usually many. They mostly touch on her vocal agility and brilliance, but Bacon reports that she was unusual in being able to dance and sing at the same time. She survived many attacks on both her personal attributes and her integrity, a survival that may well be in part attributable to her &#145;masculine understanding&#146;  (Taylor, 2.103); she preferred male society and &#145;was animated in company, and uttered humorous and shrewd remarks&#146;  (ibid.).<br>
<br>Mara ended her days as flamboyantly as she lived the earlier years of her life. She was financially ruined by imprudent&#151;and well-publicized&#151;love affairs with two obviously unsuitable, much younger, singers. By 1786 she was having an affair with the 26-year-old singer <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/12444/', "Samuel Harrison (1760&#150;1812)")</script>, with whom she visited Margate and Paris, but the relationship ended about 1787.<br>
<br>By summer 1794 she had eloped to Bath with Charles Florio, with whom she remained until the end of his life (she and her husband separated at some point after 1795). She courted public censure by living openly with him in Brompton, and public disgrace by beating her cook in 1798; although she and Florio were both brought before the magistrate Sir Richard Ford on 11 August, the matter was settled out of court. She left England with Florio in 1801, and after travelling to Paris and to Berlin in 1803, she settled in Moscow in 1807, only to be made destitute by the burning of the city by Napoleon in 1812; she lost two houses and all her worldly goods in the flames. After Florio's death in 1819 (he had starved himself for days and become violent, insisting that Mara was attempting to poison him) she suffered the indignity of attempting a disastrous London comeback on 16 March 1820, unaware that her musical powers had declined. She died in Reval, Russia (now Tallinn, Estonia), on 20 January 1833, not entirely forgotten; Goethe had sent her a birthday poem &#145;Sangreich war dein Ehrenweg&#146; in 1831.<br>
