<span class="headword">Davies,  Howell</span>  (1717?&#150;1770), <span class="occ">Methodist leader</span>, was of unknown origins, though historians usually refer to him as a Monmouthshire man. His family connections and his early employment as a schoolteacher at Talgarth suggest that he could have been brought up in Brecknockshire, where, in 1737, he was converted by Howel Harris. On Harris's advice, in 1738 Davies went to Llanddowror to study under Griffith Jones. After his ordination in 1740 he served as curate at Llandeilo Abercywyn, but he could not resist the urge to preach in the Methodist way far outside his curacy, a practice Jones severely criticized: &#145;it is the cry of the crowd that he will be governed by, which grieves me very much for his own sake&#146;  (D. Jones, <span class="italic">Life and Times of Griffith Jones of Llanddowror</span>, 1902, 252). In 1741 he became curate of Llys-y-fr&acirc;n, near Haverfordwest. The parish soon became the chief meeting-place for Pembrokeshire Methodists.<br>
<br>From 1743 until his death, Davies was the undisputed leader of the Pembrokeshire Methodists: his power as a preacher (a power not discernible in his only printed sermon, <span class="italic">Llais y priodfab</span>, 1768), his standing as an ordained clergyman, and his financial independence gave him a rare combination of spiritual and social advantages. Ill health was his main disadvantage. He worked in both the English and Welsh parts of the county; in 1755 he opened, at Woodstock, the first chapel built especially for a Welsh Methodist society. His staunch Calvinism allied him to George Whitefield, whose pulpits in London and the west country he sometimes filled, and made him &#145;violent against John Wesley&#146;  (T. Benyon, <span class="italic">Howell Harris, Reformer and Soldier (1714&#150;1773)</span>, 1985, 161). Through Selina Hastings, countess of Huntingdon, he became one of the countess of Walsingham's chaplains.<br>
<br>Davies married, first, in 1744, Katherine (daughter of John Poyer) of Parke, Henllan Amgoed, Carmarthenshire, &#145;a wife with a thousand dracmas&#146;, as Lewis Morris sarcastically noted  (H. Owen, &#145;The Morrises of Anglesey and the Methodists of the 18th century&#146;, <span class="italic">Transactions of the Anglesey Antiquarian and Field Society</span>, 1943, 55). She died in childbirth a year later. The daughter who was born died before the age of two. Then, some time before the summer of 1747, he married Elizabeth, daughter and only surviving child of Philip and Luce White (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Phillips) of Prendergast, near Haverfordwest. A son born to them died in infancy; their daughter Margaret (Peggy) survived both, and in 1776 married Nathaniel, son of Daniel Rowland.<br>
<br>Several of his contemporaries describe Davies as tender and gentle, modest, shy even. No doubt he was, in private. The public man who earned for himself the title Apostle of Pembrokeshire must have been tenacious and fearless, like most of the Methodist revivalists. On the title-page of Williams Pantycelyn's elegy to Davies, the poet notes that he died on 13 January 1770, &#145;in the fifty-third year of his age&#146;  (W. Williams, <span class="italic">Marwnad ar y parchedig Mr H. Davies</span>, 1770). He died in Parke and was buried in Prendergast cemetery.<br>
