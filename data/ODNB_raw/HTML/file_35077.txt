<span class="headword">Montague,  Charles Edward</span>  (1867&#150;1928), <span class="occ">journalist and novelist</span>, was born at Ealing, Middlesex, on 1 January 1867, the third of the four sons of Francis Montague (<i>d</i>. 1893) and his wife, Rosa McCabe (<i>d</i>. 1906), daughter of a merchant in Drogheda, Ireland. His father renounced his priesthood in the Roman Catholic church and settled in England. Montague was educated at the City of London School (1879&#150;85) and at Balliol College, Oxford, where he obtained a first class in classical moderations in 1887 and a second in <i>literae humaniores</i> in 1889. He was recruited to the staff of the <span class="italic">Manchester Guardian</span> in 1890 by its editor, Charles Prestwich Scott; six years later Montague became chief leader writer. He opposed the South African War, and his commitment to the great Liberal causes was demonstrated during the Edwardian era in his leaders on protectionism, female suffrage, home rule, and the constitutional crisis. His novel <span class="italic">A Hind Let Loose</span> (1910), which was first written as a farce during the South African War, angrily condemned &#145;rotten journalism&#146; and was inscribed &#145;To C.P.S., through whom an English paper is clear of these stains&#146;.<br>
<br>Although Montague was often acting editor after 1906, when C. P. Scott was an MP, their differences of outlook became more apparent. In August 1914 Montague's leaders quickly noted that Germany was responsible for the war and that &#145;Prussian Junkerdom&#146; must be defeated  (<span class="italic">Manchester Guardian</span>, 24 Aug 1914). Conversely, C. P. Scott worked for peace and feared the &#145;impossibility of harmony of feeling&#146; with Montague on this vital issue  (C. P. Scott to L. T. Hobhouse, 12 Dec 1914, Guardian archives 132/186). In the autumn months of 1914 Montague, aged forty-seven, astonished his colleagues by his urgent attempts to enlist. In December 1898 he had married Madeline (1876&#150;1958), daughter of C. P. Scott and the educationist Rachel Scott, at Platt Unitarian Chapel, Rusholme, and they had five sons and two daughters. The couple were keen mountaineers and climbed together in the Alps and the Lake District before the First World War. In December 1914 Montague dyed his white hair&#151;a widely cited action in the literature of the war&#151;and succeeded in joining a unit for &#145;elderly&#146; sportsmen. This battalion, the 24th service battalion, Royal Fusiliers, appeared as the king's own Middlesex fusiliers in his later writings. He joined as an alpinist, as mountaineering was his favourite recreation, made clear in <span class="italic">The Morning's War</span> (1913).<br>
<br>In 1915 Montague revelled in the comradeship of soldier-sportsmen, who sacrificed comfortable standards of living and believed, with crusading innocence, in the cause of defending small nations. His personal experience of enlistment, training, embarkation, and a brief period of front-line service, up to February 1916, provided raw material for his post-war writing. After slow recovery from a bombing incident and a wretched period at base depot, Montague was posted to a reserve battalion at Leith.<br>
<br>In June 1916 he was commissioned into the intelligence department at general headquarters, where he accompanied war correspondents to the front line and censored their daily reports. Captain Montague courteously and quietly fulfilled the role of a conducting officer and he also guided guests such as H. G. Wells and Bernard Shaw on their journeys on the western front.<br>
<br>Montague was demobilized in January 1919, appointed OBE (military), and returned to the <span class="italic">Manchester Guardian</span>, but not to the role of chief leader writer, for L. T. Hobhouse, J. L. Hammond, and Ted Scott were more influential adjuncts of C. P. Scott's seemingly endless editorship. Instead, in short leaders, Montague became the voice of the demoralized provincial middle class. The years before 1914 became &#145;a lost Golden age&#146;  (<span class="italic">Manchester Guardian</span>, 30 Dec 1920) when compared with the &#145;discordant, blatant and vulgar&#146; post-war years, characterized by revolution, industrial unrest, decadence, and the loss of self-control  (&#145;Armistice day meditation&#146;, <span class="italic">Manchester Guardian</span>, 11 Nov 1920).<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">Disenchantment</span> was an episodic and impressionistic commentary on the course and impact of the war, comprising articles published in the <span class="italic">Manchester Guardian</span> between April 1920 and November 1921. As an early liberal perspective on the war in France it has no equal, but its title has erroneously been used to identify a school of anti-war writers. Montague opposed the <i>conduct</i> of the British war effort and the lack of generosity and decency in the post-war years. The delicate allusiveness, romanticized treatment of voluntary recruiting, and pungent wit did not mask the moral indignation in <span class="italic">Disenchantment</span>. As a highly contemporary manual for living it had a didactic purpose, and character stereotypes were used to explore the themes of idealism and cynicism.<br>
<br>Montague revisited these themes in a collection of short stories, <span class="italic">Fiery Particles</span> (1923), in which the moral shallowness of the political &eacute;lite featured strongly. <span class="italic">The Right Place</span> (1924) continued the condition of England theme, but conveyed with much enjoyment the propinquity of landscape. In those years Montague expressed the interests and distinctiveness of Manchester in a newspaper which had begun to emphasize political news from London. The closure of Miss Horniman's Gaiety Theatre in 1920 effectively ended his work as a theatre critic, which earlier in his career was published in <span class="italic">The Manchester Stage, 1880&#150;1900</span> (1900) and <span class="italic">Dramatic Values</span> (1911). In December 1925 he departed from the <span class="italic">Manchester Guardian</span> with much dignity and regret.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">Rough Justice</span> was published in 1926. It presented in fiction the message of <span class="italic">Disenchantment</span>, but was much more popular; in 1926 20,000 copies were sold. Montague made much use of his war diary in this depiction of England at war. Molly and Auberon were hero types, but social &#145;betters&#146; had generally failed the test of war and the only redeeming feature of English society was the &#145;ineradicable decency of the plain man&#146;  (Montague MSS I.8). As an old Liberal Montague expended much literary effort in charting institutional failure, a dysfunctional social structure, and a cultural shift which affronted his adherence to individualism and anti-modernism. He was a diffident writer, whose elliptical phrasing and awkward rendition of vernacular idiom provided feats of linguistic contortion.<br>
<br>After <span class="italic">Rough Justice</span>, which is full of his own experiences, Montague could not think of another plot for a novel and feared that he would be remembered primarily as an essayist. After the publication of <span class="italic">Right off the Map</span> (1927), an allegorical study of the causes and consequences of war, Chatto and Windus suggested that a further opportunity for reflections on Englishness would lie in a series of semi-historical essays. However, his final, posthumously published works were <span class="italic">Action and other Stories</span> (1928) and <span class="italic">A Writer's Notes on his Trade</span> (1930).<br>
<br>In retirement Montague lived at Burford, Oxfordshire, and in 1926 he received the honorary degree of LittD from the University of Manchester. He remained a director of Manchester Guardian Ltd. He died of pneumonia at The Firs, Fallowfield, Manchester, on 28 May 1928, and was cremated on 30 May at the Manchester crematorium. His wife, one of the first female magistrates appointed in Manchester (1920), died on 11 December 1958.<br>
