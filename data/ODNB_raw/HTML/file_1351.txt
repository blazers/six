<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Barclay,  Thomas</span>  (1792&#150;1873), <span class="occ">Church of Scotland minister and university principal</span>, was born at Unst, in Shetland, in June 1792, the youngest of the five sons of James Barclay (1745&#150;1793), the minister of the parish, and his wife, Ursula, daughter of William Archibald, James Barclay's predecessor as minister. Educated at Lerwick Academy, Thomas headed the bursary competition in 1808 for a place at King's College in the University of Aberdeen, where he graduated MA in 1812. He remained in Aberdeen, completing his theological studies with a view to following his father into the church. He supported himself by teaching elocution, publishing in 1815 <span class="italic">The Academic Reciter, or, Select Classical Extracts in Prose and Poetry</span>. Barclay abandoned his chosen career in 1818 in favour of journalism with <span class="italic">The Times</span> in London. As a general and parliamentary reporter he covered many national events, including the Peterloo massacre, the Glasgow radical riots, and the trial of Queen Caroline. On 21 September 1820 he married Mary (<i>d</i>. 1881), daughter of Captain Charles Adamson of Kirkhill, with whom he had nine children.<br>
<br>Barclay was licensed by the presbytery of Lerwick in June 1821 and presented to the parish of Dunrossness in September 1822 by Lord Laurence Dundas. Five years later, again on Dundas's recommendation, he moved to the more prestigious charge of Lerwick, where he made a reputation as a preacher and a liberal. It was during his time here that Sir Henry Holland heard him preach and on the Monday went sailing with him. A storm got up, the helmsman panicked, and Barclay, taking over, steered the boat safely to shore. Holland was much impressed. Barclay was elected synod clerk of Zetland in 1831. He left Shetland in September 1843 for Peterculter, where he remained for just ten months before accepting the charge of Currie near Edinburgh. In 1849 the University of Aberdeen conferred upon him the degree of DD. These were difficult times for the Church of Scotland in the immediate aftermath of the Disruption. Barclay took a moderate liberal position, and became a close friend and supporter of Dr Robert Lee (1804&#150;1868), minister of Greyfriars and, from 1847, professor of biblical criticism at Edinburgh University. He defended Lee's innovations in forms of worship and church architecture.<br>
<br>In 1858 Dr Duncan Macfarlane, principal of Glasgow University, died and Barclay was appointed his successor (13 February 1858), reputedly on the recommendation of Holland, who remembered their earlier encounter. This is unlikely and it is more probable that the professors, led by Alexander Hill, lobbied the chancellor, the fourth duke of Montrose, and the rector, Lord Lytton, for the appointment of a moderate, tolerant churchman. His scholarly interests included biblical learning and philology, more particularly in the languages of northern Europe. As principal his remarkable physical resemblance to John Knox immediately made him a popular figure with the students. His arrival in Glasgow coincided with profound changes in the organization of the university following the <span class="roman">Universities of Scotland Act</span> (1858), which transformed the powers of senates and established university courts and general councils representing graduates. The legislation caused a considerable storm in Glasgow, where the twelve professors of the old foundation were shorn of most of their privileges, particularly the patronage of the non-regius chairs, which passed to the court. The moderate reforms embodied in the act were to be implemented by commissioners, with whom Barclay was in constant contact&#151;often travelling to London for the purpose.<br>
<br>The university occupied a cramped site in the old city centre surrounded by slums and industry. Most of Barclay's principalship was dominated by securing funds to obtain a fresh location in the west end of Glasgow and the construction of new buildings. These, built to the designs of George Gilbert Scott, were the largest public buildings undertaken in Victorian Britain after Barry's Palace of Westminster and cost more than &pound;266,000, of which more than half was raised by donations. On 19 July 1870, when the structure was as complete as money would allow, Barclay led a symbolic procession of his colleagues through the city to view their new home. By this time his health had succumbed to the Glasgow smog and he was forced to spend time in Egypt during the winter to relieve chronic asthma. Barclay died at his official residence, The College, Gilmore Hill, Glasgow, on 23 February 1873 and was buried at Sighthill cemetery, Glasgow. His wife, two married daughters, and a son survived him. One biographer noted: &#145;With an energy derived from his old Norse descent, he combined love of liberty, which determined his attitude to the changes of his time, and he was ever found on the side of freedom in both Church and State&#146;.<br>
