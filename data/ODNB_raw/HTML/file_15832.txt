<span class="headword">Cooper,  Edward</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1725), <span class="occ">print seller</span>, became the most distinguished print publisher of his generation and a leading figure in the art world. Nothing is known of his early life, but he first appeared as publisher of a portrait of Thomas Thynne in an advertisement in the <span class="italic">True Protestant Mercury</span> on 21 February 1682. He first began to challenge Alexander Browne's command of the mezzotint publishing business in 1684, and in 1686 he obtained a royal privilege protecting his plates against copies for a term of fourteen years. By this time he was already employing the talented engraver John Smith and cultivating certain leading portrait painters, notably Willem Wissing, Frederic Kerseboom, Godfrey Kneller, and (soon after) Michael Dahl. He also published contemporary landscapes, still lifes, and &#145;fancies&#146; by Robert Robinson, Bernard Lens the younger, and Jan vander Vaart, and old master paintings, undertaking such important initiatives as a set of mezzotints of the Raphael cartoons (1707).<br>
<br>Mezzotint was the characteristic staple of Cooper's publishing business, but he also issued some engravings. He was co-publisher with Richard Tompson of Peter Vandrebanc's etchings of the ceilings in the north range at Windsor Castle (1682&#150;6?) and publisher of Dirck Maas's large etching of <span class="italic">The Battle of the Boyne</span> (1691). He also reissued some old plates, including a set of twenty-five <span class="italic">Birds and Beasts</span>, after Francis Barlow, later stolen during the view of the sale that followed his death. As a retailer, Cooper dealt in old master prints, imported Italian prints, and was named in advertisements as a principal distributor of such important English undertakings as Nicolas Dorigny's Raphael cartoons and James Thornhill's prints of his designs for the cupola of St Paul's.<br>
<br>However, Cooper's business in art was not confined to prints: he also sold paintings and artists' materials and was widely acknowledged as an art expert. In 1703 he valued Robert Hooke's print collection and by 1711 he was distributing catalogues of important auction sales of paintings; it is likely that he was the cataloguer and possibly the auctioneer of many of these sales. One at least, in 1719, was of pictures &#145;collected by Mr Edward Cooper&#146;  (<span class="italic">Daily Courant</span>, 21 Jan 1719). He mixed with the leading connoisseurs in the country. In 1714 he was steward at the feast of the exclusive club the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/96316', "Society of the Virtuosi of St Luke")</script>, &#145;the earliest organized group of art experts and art advisers in this country&#146;  (Bignamini, 21). Cooper was a member from at least 1714 to 1720. He was also one of George Vertue's trusted informants about art history.<br>
<br>Cooper remained at the Three Pigeons in Bedford Street, between Covent Garden and the Strand, until his death. He married Priscilla and they had at least three children, Elizabeth, John, and Priscilla. Portraits of all the family were engraved in mezzotint. Cooper's decision to retire was signalled by the advertisement of a sale of &#145;the large and curious collection of prints and drawings of Mr Edward Cooper (who is leaving off the business)&#146; in the <span class="italic">Daily Courant</span> of 2 February 1723. At this point he published his own portrait, engraved by Pelham after vander Vaart, showing a corpulent man holding a proof mezzotint. John vander Vaart was mentioned as a &#145;dear friend&#146; in Cooper's will. This document indicated substantial affluence: he left a second house to his wife. He died early in 1725, and his death was followed by another sale, of household goods and shop goods, including a &#145;four-Wheel'd Chaise&#146; as well &#145;as Copper-Plates, Paints, Pictures, fine Colours, &amp;c. likewise several sorts of Materials belonging to Painting, Printing, &amp;c.&#146;  (<span class="italic">Daily Post</span>, 1 May 1725). Prints published by Cooper may be found in the British Museum, London, and the Yale Center for British Art, New Haven, Connecticut.<br>
<br>His son <a name="cosubject_69320"></a><span class="headword">John Cooper</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1729/30), <span class="occ">art auctioneer</span>, was the leading figure in this field during the 1720s, as well as co-publisher of Hogarth's <span class="italic">Hudibras</span> (1726) and publisher of <span class="italic">The Hampton Court Beauties</span> (1727). It would appear that father and son fell out, since John was left in Edward's will &#145;one shilling British money and no more by reason I have already given him a greater part or share out of what I had than by his behaviour to me he hath deserved&#146;. John Cooper was probably the auctioneer whose widow was Elizabeth Cooper, compiler of <span class="italic">The Muses Library</span> and author of <span class="italic">The Rival Widows</span> (1735).<br>
<br>During his long career Edward Cooper provided employment for most mezzotint engravers of the time. Of his regular employees, Isaac Beckett, John Smith (1652&#150;1743), William Faithorne the younger, Bernard Lens (1659/60&#150;1725), Jan vander Vaart, and Peter Pelham are separately noticed. <a name="cosubject_29538"></a><span class="headword">Robert Williams</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1680&#150;1704), <span class="occ">engraver</span>, born in Wales, was a pupil of Theodore Freres, and had the misfortune to have his leg amputated. He worked chiefly for Cooper, occasionally publishing his own mezzotints. <a name="cosubject_15832"></a><span class="headword">Francis Kyte</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1710&#150;1745), <span class="occ">engraver</span>, at first worked exclusively for Cooper and later also for John Bowles. He was pilloried for forging a bank note in 1725 and this may have been the reason why at this time he sometimes Latinized his name to Milvus. It is fairly certain that he was the same person as the &#145;rather good&#146;  (Waterhouse, 212) portrait painter with dated work in the 1740s, some of which was published.<br>
