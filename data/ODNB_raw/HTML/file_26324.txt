</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Staunton, Sir  George Leonard</span>, first baronet  (1737&#150;1801), <span class="occ">physician and diplomatist</span>, was born at Cargin, co. Galway, on 10 April 1737, the only son and heir of George Staunton (1700&#150;1780), landowner and colonel of militia, and his wife, Margaret (<i>c</i>.1700&#150;1784), daughter of John Leonard of Carra, co. Galway. In 1753 he was sent to complete his education in France at the Jesuit college in Toulouse and a year later he joined the school of medicine in Montpellier, whence he graduated MD in 1758. In October the following year he arrived in London and acquired a reputation as a writer on medical subjects. He counted Dr Johnson among his friends, and Boswell quotes a farewell letter from Staunton to Johnson on his departure for the West Indies in 1762. There he practised as a physician and held several official appointments, being at one time secretary to the governor of Dominica. Having acquired a large fortune he purchased an estate in Grenada, where he took up the legal profession.<br>
<br>In 1770 Staunton returned to England, and on 22 July 1771 he married Jane (1753&#150;1823), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/59343/', "Benjamin Collins (bap. 1715, d. 1785)")</script>, banker and newspaper proprietor of Milford House, near Salisbury, and his second wife, Mary Cooper (1725?&#150;1808). They had two sons, George (<i>b</i>. 1775), who died in infancy, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26325/', "George Thomas Staunton (1781&#150;1859)")</script>, Sinologist and politician. His interests being neglected by agents Staunton was obliged to return to the West Indies in 1772. He remained there until 1779 and became a member of the legislative council and attorney-general for Grenada. In 1774 he began his lifelong friendship with George Macartney (afterwards Earl Macartney), who that year had been appointed governor of Grenada and Tobago. When Grenada was attacked by the French in 1779 Staunton, as colonel of militia and aide-de-camp to the governor, took an active part in the defence. Following capitulation he and his wife were among the hostages sent to Paris. He left the West Indies a ruined man, his plantations having been pillaged by the freebooters following the French fleet and army. During his detention in France he managed to enjoy an active social life; he was also able to negotiate an exchange of prisoners that released Lord Macartney from his parole, and in 1781, when Macartney was appointed governor of Madras, Staunton accompanied him as private secretary. In this capacity he proved a very able assistant and performed several important missions for Macartney, who was often in dispute with Warren Hastings.<br>
<br>In 1782 Staunton was dispatched to Calcutta for a confidential conference with Hastings but failed to improve relations between him and Macartney. In 1783, secret information having been received from England of the near conclusion of peace with France, Staunton was appointed to negotiate with the marquis de Bussy and Admiral Suffren for a suspension of hostilities. In September that year he was sent, with a small party of sepoys, to arrest the commander of the Madras troops, General James Stuart, who had defied the governor's authority. Later in the year, with two other envoys, he was appointed to treat with Tipu Sultan; after protracted negotiations a treaty of peace was signed at Mangalore on 11 March 1784. Lord Macartney's appreciation was conveyed in a letter of 28 July 1784 to the court of directors of the East India Company. On the same day, in a private letter to Charles James Fox, he wrote that Staunton's &#145;sound head and singular talents peculiarly fit him for public business&#146;  (<span class="italic">Private Correspondence of Lord Macartney</span>, 224).<br>
<br>Staunton was sent back by Macartney to England in 1784 with official dispatches and letters to several prominent politicians about the state of affairs in India. The court of directors awarded him in 1785 a pension of &pound;500 a year for life and a grant of &pound;500 to pay for his return to India. He received an Irish baronetcy from the crown on 31 October 1785 and that year took possession of his father's estate at Cargin, on paying the balance of the sum for which it had been conveyed for a term of years to Robert French.<br>
<br>In February 1787 Staunton was elected a fellow of the Royal Society and on 16 June 1790 he was made an honorary DCL at Oxford, probably in recognition of the comparison of English and French literature that he had written for the <span class="italic">Journal &Eacute;tranger</span> during his time in France. He remained in England, without public employment, until 1792. During this period he enjoyed the confidence and friendship of Edmund Burke, who looked to him for advice, for instance before he made his famous speech in parliament on the nawab of Arcot's debts. Burke recommended him to Lord Charlemont as &#145;the first among the few persons who have done real credit and real service to this Nation and its government in the East Indies. His abilities are great and unquestioned and not more so than his Virtues&#146;  (<span class="italic">Correspondence of Edmund Burke</span>, 5.219).<br>
<br>In 1792 Staunton was appointed principal secretary to Lord Macartney's embassy to China (and provisionally minister-plenipotentiary in the event of his death). The embassy sought to improve commercial relations with China, through Canton (Guangzhou), and to establish regular diplomatic relations between the two countries. Though Macartney and Staunton had an audience with the emperor their proposals were rebuffed. Macartney kept a detailed journal of his embassy, while in 1797 Staunton published his own, well-known account of this unsuccessful mission, which was later translated into French and German. While at Rio de Janeiro, on the voyage out, Macartney wrote in his diary that &#145;Staunton, whose curiosity and activity are seldom repressed by difficulty or fatigue thought of little else than visiting &hellip; the highest pinnacle of the mountain&#146;  (Robbins, 198). In China he closely observed and noted all that he saw, and during expeditions he was able to collect botanical specimens. His son, George Thomas, then just twelve years old, accompanied him to China as page to Lord Macartney, and was the only member of the mission who bothered to learn Chinese.<br>
<br>Soon after his return from China Staunton suffered a stroke, which caused him to be paralysed down one side and his speech to be severely affected. He died after this lingering illness, on 14 January 1801 at his home, 17 Devonshire Street, London, the leasehold of which he had purchased in September 1795. He was buried on 23 January in the north aisle of Westminster Abbey, where a monument by Chantrey was erected to his memory some years later. His widow died on 16 June 1823 and was buried at St Marylebone, Middlesex, on 24 June.<br>
