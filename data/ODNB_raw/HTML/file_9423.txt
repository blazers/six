<span class="headword">Filmer,  Edward</span>  (1651/2&#150;1703), <span class="occ">playwright</span>, was the second son of seven children of Sir Robert Filmer, baronet (1621&#150;1675), of East Sutton, Kent, and his wife, Dorothy (<i>d</i>. 1671), daughter of Maurice Tuke of Layer Marney, Essex, and his wife, Amy. He matriculated at Corpus Christi College, Oxford, on 17 April 1668, aged sixteen, and was admitted as founder's kin fellow at All Souls in 1672 (Filmer was descended from a brother of Archbishop Henry Chichele, the founder of All Souls, through his mother.) He graduated BA that same year and became a bachelor of civil law on 21 February 1676. He took a doctorate in civil law in 1681. Filmer was admitted to Gray's Inn on 7 January 1675.<br>
<br>In 1687 Filmer married Archibella Clinkard (1664?&#150;1743), only daughter and heiress of Archibald Clinkard, esquire, of Sutton Valence, Kent, with whom he had six sons and four daughters. Three sons and three daughters survived him. His eldest son, Edward Filmer (1688&#150;1724), joined the army and served in the War of the Spanish Succession. Filmer's first two children were baptized at East Sutton but his subsequent children, beginning with Archibald (<i>bap</i>. 28 December 1690 and buried shortly afterwards) were baptized at Sutton Valence, indicating that Filmer and Archibella moved to her family's estate.<br>
<br>Filmer's one dramatic effort was a long and mediocre blank-verse tragedy, <span class="italic">The Unnatural Brother</span> (1697) based on an episode in Madam de Calprenede's romance <span class="italic">Cassandra</span>. <span class="italic">The Unnatural Brother</span> was produced by Betterton's Company at Lincoln's Inn Fields in early January 1697. Filmer's petulant preface to the published play blamed its failure on the bad taste of the public and his principled refusal to include a comic sub-plot. He also claimed to have been criticized for never including more than three characters on stage at one time, defending himself by claiming to follow the practice of classical antiquity. An abridged version of Filmer's play entitled <span class="italic">The Unfortunate Couple</span> was included in Peter Anthoine Motteux's <span class="italic">The Novelty</span> (1697), a series of short plays presented one after another at Lincoln's Inn Fields that summer. <span class="italic">The Unfortunate Couple</span> was revived separately after Filmer's death on 17 August 1704 at Lincoln's Inn Fields.<br>
<br>Filmer's most notable contribution to the theatre was a well-argued response to Jeremy Collier's attacks on its &#145;immorality and profaneness&#146;, begun in 1698. His response was published posthumously as <span class="italic">A Defense of Plays, or, The Stage Vindicated</span> (1707). (The anonymous 1698 <span class="italic">A Defense of Dramatick Poetry</span> and its sequel, <span class="italic">A Farther Defense</span>, are sometimes ascribed to Filmer, but the author was Elkanah Settle.) Collier, seemingly unaware of Filmer's death, replied the following year in <span class="italic">A Farther Vindication of the Short View of the Profaneness and Immorality of the English Stage</span> (1708). Filmer died at Sutton Valence, and was buried there on 20 June 1703.<br>
