<span class="headword">Whately,  (Elizabeth) Jane</span>  (1822&#150;1893), <span class="occ">religious author</span>, was born on 1 June 1822 in Oxford, the eldest child of the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29176/', "Revd Richard Whately (1787&#150;1863)")</script>, and Elizabeth Pope (<i>d</i>. 1860). She had three sisters and one brother. She spent the first few years of her life in Suffolk, where her father had been presented to the living of Halesworth. The family returned to Oxford in 1825, when her father took up the principalship of St Alban Hall. Her sister described the young Jane (as she was known) as &#145;earnest and thoughtful&#146;. Her mother, who was herself an author of some religious works, took charge of Jane's education, although Richard Whately saw to it that all of the children had some grounding in Latin. Jane's early interests, however, mirrored her mother's and she showed an early interest in, and aptitude for, music, French, and Italian. On her family's relocation to Dublin in 1831, when her father became archbishop, Jane's education was continued by a governess and &#145;the best masters Dublin then possessed&#146;; as a bright eldest daughter Jane also pursued subjects &#145;not then usual for girls&#146;  (Wale, 11, 9). Since her governess could not provide this, she shared her brother's lessons with the Revd Blanco White as well as receiving instruction from her father.<br>
<br>Jane benefited from her father's Oxford connections: when in London they stayed with the Nassau Seniors and summer holidays often included a visit to the Arnolds at Rugby. Richard Whately evidently encouraged his children in their pursuits, offering affectionate criticism; <span class="italic">A Selection of English Synonyms</span> (1851; many later editions) is one result of his interest. With her mother and sisters Jane was active in local philanthropic endeavours; she and her sister <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/59107/', "Mary Whately")</script> taught for the Irish Church Mission Society. Italians living in Dublin were also a focus of her attention, as was the cause of converting Spain to protestantism. As the eldest daughter of an archbishop Jane had extensive social and domestic responsibilities which increased after the death of her mother in 1860. As her two surviving sisters (the youngest had died in 1859) were living abroad for health reasons, the burden of caring for the ailing Richard Whately as well as her brother's children fell on her.<br>
<br>The death of Archbishop Whately in the autumn of 1863 marked the end of Jane Whately's settled residence in Dublin and the development of her literary and missionary career. Before her father's death Jane had written a few small works based on her own <span class="roman">Bible</span> study, co-authored a book on mothers' meetings, and produced a biography of Martin Luther as well as the <span class="italic">Selection of English Synonyms</span>. After her father's death Jane began work on his biography; she began in 1864 by publishing a collection of his sermons and <span class="italic">Miscellaneous Remains from the Commonplace Book of Richard Whately</span>. Her <span class="italic">Life and Correspondence of Richard Whately, D.D.</span> (1866) was completed with the assistance of her father's pupil and friend Nassau Senior. She later published abridged versions of Richard Whately's <span class="italic">The Kingdom of Christ Delineated</span> (1877) and <span class="italic">The Errors of Romanism</span> (1878).<br>
<br>Jane seems to have had stronger evangelical leanings than her father and was ever ready to elucidate the dangers of Roman Catholicism; a substantial portion of her published works deal with this subject, for example: <span class="italic">Maude, or, The Anglican Sister of Mercy</span> (1869) and <span class="italic">Romanism in the Light of the Gospel</span> (1882). The bulk of her writings, however, took home and foreign missions as their subject. Indeed, missionary journeys dominated Jane Whately's later life. Until her sister Mary's death in 1889, Jane spent most winters at her sister's mission in Egypt where she established a school for girls. Jane never acquired a facility for Arabic, so the girls were taught in French and English. Summers were spent largely in France or Switzerland with her sister Henrietta and her family. Throughout her life Jane was troubled by asthma and many of her travels (whether to Egypt, Spain, or Italy) were intended to improve her health. These sojourns were transformed by Jane into missionary opportunities&#151;when travelling she was known to take tracts with her and speak openly to passers-by. Her health weakening, Jane was advised to winter in Guernsey; she died there, unmarried, at St Peter Port on 19 February 1893 and was buried on the island.<br>
