<span class="headword">Primrose,  Archibald, of Dalmeny</span>, first earl of Rosebery  (1664&#150;1723), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born on 18 December 1664 at Edinburgh. He was the only son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22793/', "Archibald Primrose, Lord Carrington (1616&#150;1679)")</script>, lord justice-general, and his second wife, Agnes, daughter of Sir William Gray of Pittendrum, and widow of Sir James Dundas. In his youth he travelled abroad and served in the imperial army of Hungary, returning to Scotland in 1687. On 26 June 1688 he was summoned before the privy council on the charge of spreading discord among the officers of state opposed, like him, to James II's policies in Scotland. Through the intervention of the duke of Berwick, however, the investigation was suspended.<br>
<br>After the revolution of 1688 Primrose was appointed one of the gentlemen of the bedchamber to Prince George of Denmark, on whose death in 1708 the salary of &pound;600 a year attached to the office was continued to him for life. He married on 3 February 1691 Dorothy Cressy (<i>b</i>. 1672/3?, <i>d</i>. after 1724), daughter of Everingham and Anne Cressy of Birkin, Yorkshire; they had six sons and six daughters. In 1695 he was chosen to represent the county of Edinburgh in the Scottish parliament, and, on account of his consistent support of the government, he was in April 1700 created Viscount Rosebery, Lord Primrose and Dalmeny. On the accession of Queen Anne in 1702 he was sworn of the privy council, and in April 1703 created earl of Rosebery, viscount of Inverkeithing, and Lord Dalmeny and Primrose in the Scottish peerage. He was one of the commissioners for the Union with England, and after its accomplishment was chosen as a Scottish representative peer in 1707, 1708, 1710, and 1713. Between 1703 and 1714 he also served as chamberlain of Fife and Strathearn. Rosebery died on 20 October 1723, and was succeeded by his eldest son, James Primrose, second earl of Rosebery (1691&#150;1755), who on the death in 1741 of his kinsman Hugh, Viscount Primrose, inherited the family estate and baronetcy of the elder branch of the family.<br>
