<span class="headword">Fitzgerald,  Thomas</span>, seventh earl of Kildare  (<em>d.</em> 1478), <span class="occ">administrator</span>, was the son of John Fitzgerald (<i>d</i>. in or before 1434), reputedly the sixth earl, and his wife, Margaret de la Herne, and grandnephew of Gerald Fitzgerald, the fifth earl (<i>d</i>. 1432). In 1432 James Butler, fourth earl of Ormond, had secured possession of most of the Kildare estates in right of his second wife, Elizabeth, daughter and heir of the fifth earl of Kildare. &#145;Thomas fitz Morice of the Geraldynes&#146; first emerges in 1453&#150;4, when he was disputing the Butler claim to the Kildare ancestral manors of Maynooth and Rathmore. He was probably recognized as earl only during 1454. In October 1454 he was elected justiciar of Ireland after the death of the deputy of Richard, duke of York, and he served as York's deputy lieutenant from 1455 until the duke took refuge in Ireland in 1459 after the battle of Ludford Bridge. Kildare's association with the Yorkists during these years, and the eventual attainder of the Lancastrian earl of Ormond and Wiltshire, enabled Earl Thomas to retrieve all the Kildare estates and more from the Butlers. He also began the recovery of those possessions in the Kildare&#150;Carlow region which had been reoccupied by Gaelic clans during the abeyance in the earldom, notably the border manor of Rathangan, probably in 1459 after the earl's defeat of Conn &Oacute; Conchobhair Failghe. In this way, Earl Thomas laid the foundations for the later Kildare ascendancy.<br>
<br>After York's departure in 1460, Kildare again served as governor, being rewarded by Edward IV in 1461 by confirmation of Duke Richard's grant of the manor of Moylagh, Meath. The next year he was superseded by Roland FitzEustace, Lord Portlester, but in January 1464 he was made lord chancellor. Kildare was married to Joan, daughter of James Fitzgerald, sixth earl of Desmond (<i>d</i>. 1462/3), and sister of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9584/', "Thomas Fitzgerald, the seventh earl (d. 1468)")</script>, and in 1464 he and his wife founded the Franciscan convent at Adare in Limerick. In 1468 he incurred, with his brother-in-law Thomas Fitzgerald, the hostility of the new deputy, John Tiptoft, earl of Worcester. Both were attainted by parliament at Drogheda, but the reprisals which followed Desmond's execution brought out so clearly the weakness of a government without Fitzgerald support that Kildare was respited. On his promise of faithful service and to cause the Irishmen of Leinster to be at peace, parliament repealed the attainder and restored Kildare to his estates. During autumn 1470 he was re-elected justiciar and held a parliament in Edward IV's name in November. He was serving as deputy lieutenant for Henry VI the following February, as justiciar for Edward IV in May, and, on Clarence's reappointment, became deputy again and remained in office until 1475. By building a dyke to protect the pale, and by excluding &#145;disloyal Irish&#146; from garrisons, Kildare sought to uphold English rule. In 1472 eighty archers were provided for him as the nucleus of a permanent force, but he was expected to defray half the cost. In 1473 the archers were increased to 160, with sixty-three spearmen; and in 1474 a Brotherhood of the Arms of St George was established to defend the pale, of which Kildare was president, while his son Gerald was its first captain. This put a force of 120 mounted archers and forty men-at-arms in his hands. The period of Kildare's government is also an epoch of some importance in the history of the Irish coinage.<br>
<br>In 1475 Kildare was superseded by William Sherwood, bishop of Meath. He was re-elected justiciar in February 1478, but he died on 25 March and was buried in the monastery of All Hallows in Dublin. He and his wife apparently had four sons and two daughters, and Kildare was succeeded by his eldest son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9554/', "Gerald Fitzgerald (1456?&#150;1513)")</script>, the eighth earl.<br>
