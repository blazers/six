<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Davies, Sir  William Llewelyn</span>  (1887&#150;1952), <span class="occ">librarian</span>, was born at Plas Gwyn schoolhouse, near Pwllheli, on 11 October 1887, the third child and younger son of William Davies and his wife, Jane Evans, both natives of Llanafan, Cardiganshire. His father, formerly the earl of Lisburne's gamekeeper, was then similarly employed at Broom Hall, near Pwllheli, but joined the staff of Sir Arthur Osmond Williams, of Castell Deudraeth, when his son was five years old. Davies was brought up at Minffordd, near Penrhyndeudraeth. He was educated at Porthmadog county school (1900&#150;03), Penrhyndeudraeth pupil&#150;teacher centre (1903&#150;6), and the University College of Wales, Aberystwyth, where he graduated BA (1909) with upper second-class honours in Welsh and proceeded MA (1912) following research on a family of sixteenth- and seventeenth-century Ardudwy poets. He held various teaching posts from 1909 until the beginning of 1917; during a period in Cardiff (1914&#150;17) he also lectured part-time in Welsh at the university college there in 1916. Subsequently he served in the Royal Garrison Artillery, and later as a commissioned officer in the army education service.<br>
<br>In September 1919 Davies was appointed first assistant librarian under John Ballinger at the young National Library of Wales at Aberystwyth. When Ballinger retired in 1930, Davies succeeded him as chief librarian, a position which he held until his death. He continued the work, so successfully begun, of building up in Wales a national library which would rank among the great libraries of the world. His experience as Ballinger's deputy, his interest in Welsh history and literature, and his ability to communicate in both Welsh and English served him in good stead. He proved to be an effective organizer and a conscientious worker. During his period as librarian Davies was able to complete the construction of the first library building. The first stage was opened in 1937 but he did not live to see the opening of the completed building in 1955.<br>
<br>Davies was convinced from the outset that one of the library's most important functions was to collect and preserve the mass of manuscript and documentary material relating to Wales which was scattered (often in a state of neglect) throughout the principality and farther afield. His task was made easier by changing economic conditions, which brought about the disintegration of large estates and the vacating of old country houses. The list of individual owners, institutions, and official bodies who responded to his diplomatic persuasion to transfer their records to the library, either absolutely or on permanent loan, is a notable one. Of particular importance was the housing at the library of the Calvinistic Methodist archive (1934), a number of Baptist and Congregationalist records, and the Church in Wales records (1944&#150;5). Of the approximately 3.5 million documents housed in the library when Davies died, all but 200,000 or so were acquired during his period of administration. Collection and preservation, however, were only the beginning: he also aimed to make the records available to researchers without undue delay. This was achieved by substituting handy, typewritten, brief-entry schedules and handlists for printed detailed calendars, and by the compilation of subject indexes: the printed <span class="italic">Handlist of Manuscripts</span> began to appear in 1940. Equally anxious to persuade other authorities to preserve the records in their custody, he urged the various county councils of Wales to establish records committees and he gave to municipal, ecclesiastical, and other bodies and to individuals valuable advice and practical assistance. He kept the National Library of Wales in close touch with other institutions with similar aims through his membership of the Historical Manuscripts Commission, the Society of Antiquaries, the executive committee of the Council for the Preservation of Business Archives, and the British Records Association, of which he was a vice-president representing the interests of Wales.<br>
<br>The preservation of records was only part of Davies's service to Welsh culture. He was also responsible for organizing the lending of books to adult study classes throughout Wales, for operating in eleven counties the regional libraries scheme for Wales and Monmouthshire, and for the selection, acquisition, and distribution of books for patients in the sanatoria of Wales. During the Second World War he established a national committee to provide Welsh books for those serving in the forces. During the war also he undertook the responsibility of housing some of the manuscripts and books of the British Museum in a specially constructed tunnel in the library grounds, as he described in an article in the <span class="italic">Transactions of the Honourable Society of Cymmrodorion</span> in 1946. Davies missed no opportunity, through lectures, broadcast talks, and publications, of bringing his library into closer contact with the Welsh people. In 1937 he published <span class="italic">The National Library of Wales: a Survey of its History, its Contents, and its Activities</span>, and two years later he launched the <span class="italic">National Library of Wales Journal</span>, which he edited for fourteen years. He was also honorary editor of the journals of the Welsh Bibliographical Society (1932&#150;49), the Cardiganshire Antiquarian Society (until 1951), and the Merioneth Historical and Record Society (1949&#150;51). In addition he was associate editor (from 1947 until his death) of <span class="italic">Y bywgraffiadur Cymreig</span>, the Welsh biographical dictionary published in 1953 by the Honourable Society of Cymmrodorion, to which he contributed some 200 entries on gentry families, antiquaries, and bibliophiles. A member of numerous academic and other cultural bodies, he was a leading spirit in every organization promoting the intellectual life of the principality.<br>
<br>Most of Davies's published work relates to his work as librarian and he had little opportunity to follow his research interests. Parts of his MA dissertation appeared in the <span class="italic">Transactions of the Honourable Society of Cymmrodorion</span> (1931) and an article on David Samwell (<i>d</i>. 1799), an eighteenth-century poet, in the <span class="italic">Transactions</span> for 1938.<br>
<br>Davies had married in 1914 Gwen, daughter of Dewi Llewelyn, grocer and baker, of Pontypridd, and afterwards adopted the additional name of Llewelyn; the couple had one daughter. Davies was knighted in 1944 and received the honorary degree of LLD from the University of Wales in 1951. In the year of his death he was high sheriff of Merioneth. He died at home at Sherborne House, Aberystwyth, on 11 November 1952, and his ashes were scattered in the grounds of the library following cremation at Pontypridd on 14 November. His wife survived him.<br>
