<span class="headword">Hartley,  John</span>  (1839&#150;1915), <span class="occ">dialect poet and writer</span>, was born on 19 October 1839 at 7 Bedford Street, Halifax, the youngest of the five children of John Hartley, tea dealer and travelling draper, and his wife, Rachel, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Riley. His paternal grandparents were members of the choir at St Mary's Church, Illingworth, and had &#145;more than ordinary musical talent&#146;  (Waddington, 4), but little is known about the cultural influences of his childhood. He received an elementary education at a local dame-school and at John Farrar's academy in Halifax before serving his apprenticeship as a textile designer at James Akroyd &amp; Sons, worsted spinners, in 1851. In his early twenties he joined the Beacon Club, a young men's literary and musical club which met at the Corporation Arms inn, Gibbet Street, Halifax, where he found an audience for his developing literary aspirations.<br>
<br>Hartley's first published poem, &#145;Bite Bigger&#146;, a poignant story of an encounter with two young street urchins in a Yorkshire mill town and issued as a penny broadsheet, was a phenomenal success, selling thousands of copies. It was directly influenced by Edwin Waugh's Lancashire dialect piece &#145;Come whoam to thi childer an me&#146;. It resulted in Hartley's appointment in 1866 as editor of the <span class="italic">Original Illuminated Clock Almanack</span>, which provided a vehicle for his prolific output of dialect poetry and prose. Under his editorship, which extended over almost half a century, the almanac became Yorkshire's most popular and enduring dialect magazine, achieving annual sales of 80,000 by 1887 and continuing publication until 1957. A radical Liberal, Hartley combined in his writing sentimentality and social realism, spiced with an earthy Yorkshire humour and reflecting a strong sense of community. He also displayed an extraordinary versatility in his writing, choosing subjects ranging from simple tales to abstract philosophical themes, and utilizing a variety of forms of literary expression. Many of his stories were based on the fictional, semi-autobiographical character of Sammywell Grimes, and he was both a brilliant essayist and a master of the pithy aphorism. His homespun observations included such classics as &#145;A chap 'ats nivver had to struggle doesn't know his strength&#146; and &#145;If yo say nowt, tho' yo know nowt, folk'll credit you wi' wisdom&#146;  (Waddington, 4). A contemporary bibliophile, J. Horsfall Turner, writing in 1906, concluded that &#145;undoubtedly&#146; Hartley had &#145;the greatest popularity of any Yorkshire writer&#146;  (Turner, 134).<br>
<br>Hartley supplemented his income from writing with a business dealing in and designing carpets and upholstery, but his career displayed some enigmatic twists and some imprudent commercial decisions. Having temporarily handed over responsibility for editing the almanac to others he made a disastrous trip to North America between 1872 and 1875. During this visit he invested most of his money in the hire of a public hall in Quebec for the purpose of giving a public recital; but he failed to attract an audience and he then moved up the St Lawrence to Montreal, where he tried his hand variously as a newspaper canvasser, painter and decorator, theatre manager, and even a circus acrobat. Moreover, in 1875, on his return to England, he foolishly sold the copyright of his <span class="italic">Yorkshire Ditties</span> to his publisher. On a later, twelve-year sojourn in North America he enjoyed some success as a businessman in Philadelphia, but by the turn of the century he was poor, even though the <span class="italic">Illuminated Clock Almanack</span> continued to record buoyant sales. In 1904 some of his readers petitioned for a civil-list pension for him, but without success, and in 1909 he was presented with a purse of 100 guineas at a seventieth birthday dinner at the Great Northern Hotel in Bradford.<br>
<br>Hartley's often precarious financial situation failed to subdue his genial, optimistic, warm-hearted character. Photographs and sketches reveal a man of sturdy build, with dark hair combed back, sparkling eyes, an aquiline nose, and a patriarchal beard. He married three times. His first wife, Martha, whom he married at Halifax parish church on 23 May 1859, bore him five children, but died following the birth of the youngest, Percy, in 1878 or 1879. His second wife was Sophia Ann Wilson, the daughter of Alfred Wilson, a Halifax hatter and the originator and publisher of the <span class="italic">Illuminated Clock Almanack</span>. They married in 1880 and she featured as Mally Grimes in many of his stories. After her death in January 1915 Hartley married, on 21 September 1915, a widow and former schoolteacher, Annie Spencer (<i>b</i>. 1859), daughter of Thomas McCandlish, a safe and bedstead salesman. Shortly after his third marriage Hartley died of a cerebral haemorrhage, pneumonia, and heart failure on 18 December 1915 at his home, 11 Seaview Avenue, Wallasey, Cheshire. He was survived by his wife. A small private funeral service was held in Wallasey on 23 December 1915, conducted by the Revd Dr Gasking of Walton.<br>
