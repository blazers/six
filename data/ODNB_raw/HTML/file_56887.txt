<span class="headword">Pugh,  Edwin William</span>  (1874&#150;1930), <span class="occ">novelist, short-story writer, and critic</span>, was born on 22 January 1874 at 47 Foley Street, Marylebone, London, the second of four children of David Walter Pugh (1843&#150;1887), a theatrical property maker, Covent Garden orchestra player, and sometime member of the Moore and Burgess Minstrels, and his wife, Emily, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Harris (1845&#150;1925), a Covent Garden wardrobe mistress. Pugh attended a local board school, leaving aged thirteen in 1887 to work in an iron factory, where he worked fourteen hours a day for three months. He then worked in a lawyer's office for eight years and later drew on his experiences in his writings.<br>
<br>Pugh began his writing career by publishing a short story when he was twelve. His first collection was <span class="italic">A Street in Suburbia</span> (1895), a series of sketches of London working-class life, closely followed by his first novel, <span class="italic">The Man of Straw</span>, in the following year. The former, though rather sentimental, was similar in style to the work of Arthur Morrison, the latter to that of Dickens. Both books were favourably reviewed and Pugh turned to full-time writing as a result. His early work dealt with the life and times of the London East End cockney, and he established himself as a member of the &#145;cockney school&#146; of writers, which included William Pett Ridge (1860&#150;1930) and Henry Nevinson (1856&#150;1941). Pugh's enthusiasm for the East End and its inhabitants was a reflection of his own early background and his ability to better himself.<br>
<br>Pugh's depiction of working-class life is over-sentimental and unrealistic. Unlike Morrison he fights shy of the vicious, criminal life of the East End, writing rather of the unkind circumstances and ugliness of life, of poverty, and of the problems caused by personal relationships. A good example is the novel <span class="italic">Tony Drum: a Cockney Boy</span> (1898), a story of the trials and tribulations of a very untypical cockney. He is physically deformed and an innocent; all that is good in his life is destroyed, including in the end his own life itself. This is the essence of Pugh's attitude towards the working class; his characters are frequently untypical and he portrays a rather false picture. In his essay &#145;Real realism&#146; in <span class="italic">Slings and Arrows</span> (1916) Pugh was critical of writers who painted a one-sided picture of East End life, emphasizing the brutal and criminal aspects, and neglecting much that was good in the everyday. Pugh himself, however, was guilty of such bias.<br>
<br>Autobiographical elements appear in a number of Pugh's books, especially in <span class="italic">The Eyes of a Child</span> (1917) and <span class="italic">The Secret Years</span> (1923). In these two novels the character Tobias Morgan relates the trials and tribulations of his early life and his working in a factory at the age of thirteen and then, after a breakdown, finding employment in a lawyer's office.<br>
<br>In his essay &#145;The decay of the short story&#146; Pugh wrote that &#145;the short story has fallen into decay, not because we lack living authors capable of excelling in that form of literature, but because we deceive ourselves with false notions of what the public needs&#146;  (<span class="italic">Slings and Arrows: a Book of Essays</span>, 1916, 199). Here Pugh, to a certain extent, must include himself, not only as a short-story writer but also as a novelist. At the turn of the nineteenth century the vogue for working-class novels of the cockney school was in decline and by the end of the first decade interest had virtually ceased. Despite this Pugh continued to write of the East End, publishing <span class="italic">Harry the Cockney</span> (1912) and <span class="italic">The Cockney at Home</span> (1914).<br>
<br>Apart from his cockney novels Pugh produced two novels on alcoholism: <span class="italic">The Heritage</span> (1901), in collaboration with Godfrey Burchett, and <span class="italic">The Fruits of the Vine</span> (1904). Pugh greatly admired Dickens, publishing <span class="italic">Charles Dickens: the Apostle of the People</span> in 1908, and he saw Sam Weller as &#145;the typical Cockney&#146; of the late Victorian period  (<span class="italic">The Charles Dickens Originals</span>, 1912, 206). If Pugh is remembered today it is for his cockney novels and stories, but he also wrote a mystery novel, <span class="italic">The Purple Head</span> (1905), and various books about London including <span class="italic">The City of the World</span> (1912).<br>
<br>Pugh always had to struggle to make a living and he supplemented his novel writing by his many contributions to journals and newspapers including the <span class="italic">Sun</span>, <span class="italic">Morning Leader</span>, <span class="italic">New Review</span>, <span class="italic">Idler</span>, <span class="italic">To-Day</span>, <span class="italic">English Illustrated Magazine</span>, <span class="italic">Chapman's Grand Magazine</span>, the <span class="italic">Bookman</span> (where he was a reviewer for many years), and the <span class="italic">New Age</span>. In the last of these Pugh expounded his socialist views in articles with such titles as &#145;Why I joined the Fabian Society&#146; (<span class="italic">New Age</span>, 1, 1907, 40) and &#145;Socialism and suburbia&#146; (<span class="italic">New Age</span>, 3, 1908, 330). He also contributed &#145;The Mere Clerk&#146;, a series of articles in volume 1.<br>
<br>Pugh suffered from financial problems from the beginning of the twentieth century and applied on four occasions to the Royal Literary Fund between 1902 and 1916. He received a civil-list pension of &pound;100 in 1929.<br>
<br>Thomas Burke described Pugh as &#145;short, stocky in build, with a high colour, and hair, before it went white, of jet-black&#151;altogether Welsh&#146;  (Burke, 187). He also had a beard in later life. Pugh died in sad circumstances. According to Burke he was found in Putney unconscious, battered, and bruised, and died a few days later in hospital on 5 February 1930, aged fifty-six. Yet the death certificate records that Pugh died of alcoholism at 164 St John's Hill, the address of the Lambeth, Battersea, and Wandsworth public assistance committee local offices: the hospital was next door. Pugh was saved from a pauper's burial through a subscription raised by the writer Arthur St John Adcock and was buried at Magdalen Road cemetery, Wandsworth, on 8 February 1930.<br>
