<span class="headword">Holmes,  John</span>  (1800&#150;1854), <span class="occ">antiquary</span>, son of Nathaniel Holmes (1761/2&#150;1840), was born on 17 July 1800 in Deptford, Kent. He was brought up in the house of a bookseller, John Lepard, 108 Strand, London, and for a short time had his own business in Derby. Catalogues of manuscripts that he prepared for the bookseller John Cochrane in 1829 attracted the notice of Lord Bexley and Lord Glenelg, and through their influence he was appointed temporary assistant in the department of manuscripts at the British Museum on 15 January 1830. On 8 September 1832 he married Mary Anne, eldest daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/23697/', "Charles Rivington (1754&#150;1831)")</script>, publisher [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/70881/', "Rivington family")</script>], of St Paul's Churchyard, and sister of the publisher Francis Rivington; she died at Highgate on 8 February 1870. They had five children, one of whom, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/33955/', "Richard Rivington Holmes")</script>, became librarian at Windsor Castle. Their eldest son, the Revd Charles Rivington Holmes, was father of Sir Charles John Holmes, director of the National Gallery.<br>
<br>Holmes was promoted to senior assistant in the manuscripts department in April 1837, and to assistant keeper on 6 May 1850. His most valuable official work was the <span class="italic">Catalogue of Maps, Plans and Topographical Drawings</span>, of which the first two volumes were published in 1844. The third volume was printed in 1861 with a preface, additions, and corrections by Sir Frederic Madden, the keeper of manuscripts, but the trustees of the museum refused to sanction publication, as Madden's corrections might have been thought to imply some inadequacy in the previous volumes: Sir Antony Panizzi, the principal librarian, told Madden that he &#145;must not cry <i>stinking fish</i>&#146;  (Madden, 12 June 1861). The whole impression, already bound, was almost entirely destroyed in a bindery fire in 1865, but some surviving sheets were published lithographically as volume 3 in 1961. Descriptions made by Holmes for a fourth volume have since disappeared. He began a classified index to the manuscript collections, of which a specimen was submitted to the trustees in 1836. It was evident, however, that the project could not be pursued until the collections were adequately catalogued, and the idea came to fruition only in the keepership of Sir E. A. Bond (1866&#150;78). He gave evidence to the royal commission on the British Museum which reported in 1850. After the British Museum had failed to purchase the manuscripts of Guglielmo Libri in 1846, he negotiated their purchase for Lord Ashburnham; a transaction of doubtful propriety, as it was already suspected that many of them were stolen. Holmes was elected FSA in 1832. He published little original work apart from articles in <span class="italic">The Athenaeum</span> and <span class="italic">Quarterly Review</span>, but he produced new editions of George Cavendish's <span class="italic">Life of Cardinal Wolsey</span> (1852) and Christopher Wordsworth's <span class="italic">Ecclesiastical Biography</span> (1853), and contributed notes to the 1854 edition of Lord Braybrooke's <span class="italic">Diary and Correspondence of Samuel Pepys</span> and to Samuel Wilberforce's edition of John Evelyn's <span class="italic">Life of Mrs. Godolphin</span> (1847).<br>
<br>Obituarists described Holmes as a learned and kindly man, generous in his help to scholars. Madden, however, thought that he was lazy and neglected his duties in favour of social climbing, a view no doubt coloured by his subordinate's close friendship with Panizzi, whom Madden detested. Holmes tried, unsuccessfully, to effect a reconciliation between the two men in 1852. After Holmes's death Madden nevertheless welcomed the appointment of Holmes's second son, Richard, as junior assistant in his department, &#145;a proper and gracious act on the part of the Trustees in consideration of Mr. H.'s period of service&#146;  (Madden, 5 April 1854). Holmes died suddenly at his home, 4 Park Terrace, Highgate, Middlesex, on 1 April 1854. His library was sold by Puttick and Simpson on 15 June 1854. The British Museum bought his antiquarian papers from his widow in 1855  (BL, Add. MSS 20751&#150;20777).<br>
