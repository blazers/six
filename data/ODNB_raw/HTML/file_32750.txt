</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Dawkins, Sir  William Boyd</span>  (1837&#150;1929), <span class="occ">geologist and palaeontologist</span>, was born on 26 December 1837 at the vicarage, Buttington, near Welshpool, the only son of the Revd Richard Dawkins and his wife, Mary Ann Youngman. He was educated at Rossall School, an Anglican public school near Fleetwood, and then went up to Jesus College, Oxford, in 1854. It was there that his career as a geologist began, with a first-class degree in natural sciences (1860) and the encouragement of the professor of geology, John Phillips. As an undergraduate he met J. R. Green (later a distinguished historian) and a mutual interest in history led to a pact: Green would deal with the history of Britain in the written record, while Dawkins resolved to explore the prehistory as revealed by geology and archaeology.<br>
<br>At that time there was widespread interest in human prehistory and particularly in the survival of human implements and other remains. As an undergraduate Dawkins turned his attention to cave research. In 1859 he began the excavation of a hyena den at Wookey Hole, near Wells, Somerset, which launched him into a lifetime's interest in extinct mammalia and also a lifelong link with that county. In 1861 he became the first recipient of the Burdett-Coutts scholarship, then recently founded at Oxford to promote the study of geology. Between 1861 and 1869 he was a member of the Geological Survey of Great Britain and became a junior colleague of T. H. Huxley at the Royal School of Mines in Jermyn Street, London. For eight years he mapped parts of the Wealden and other formations in Kent and the Thames valley, which furthered his interest in mammalian remains in the river gravels. This led to the publication of numerous memoirs and papers, exploring subjects as diverse as the dentition of the woolly rhinoceros and the origins of the cave lion, and to his election as a fellow of the Royal Society in 1867.<br>
<br>In 1866 Dawkins married Frances Evans (<i>d</i>. 1921), the daughter of a clerk to the Admiralty. Three years later Huxley's recommendation took Dawkins to Manchester, where he was to spend the rest of his working life. His first appointment was as curator of natural history at the old Manchester Museum in Peter Street. Founded in 1821, the museum housed both natural history and geological specimens, which by Dawkins's day had fallen into desuetude and were neglected by students and the public alike. Dawkins began cataloguing and sorting the collections, and also lectured in geology at Owens College. In 1872 he became the first lecturer in geology at Owens, when the subject was split from the natural history department of William C. Williamson. He was appointed professor in October 1874 (occupying the chair until his retirement in 1908), though he continued as an adviser to Manchester Museum&#151;which by then had become part of the university&#151;and did what he could to develop its collections and publicize its work with his lectures.<br>
<br>Dawkins's reputation for his work on natural history was still growing, particularly for his researches on English fossil mammals and early man. Between 1875 and 1878, for example, he made further excavations in caves in the Creswell crags, near Worksop, on the border of Derbyshire. He also travelled widely to the continent, Australia, and America. Besides his lecturing and prolific output of papers, he wrote two books, <span class="italic">Cave Hunting</span> (1874), and <span class="italic">Early Man in Britain and his Place in the Tertiary Period</span> (1880). The first was a pioneering attempt to correlate within a single volume the growing mass of material which had been unearthed in numerous European countries; the second was intended as a companion to Green's <span class="italic">A Short History of the English People</span> (1874). Dawkins also collaborated with W. Ayshford Sandford on <span class="italic">British Pleistocene Mammalia</span>, which was issued in several parts by the Palaeontographical Society between 1866 and 1872.<br>
<br>To his contemporaries Dawkins was an appealing mixture of Victorian man of letters and cave-hunter, a man who was perhaps:<blockquote>at his best in the open air at some such place as Arbor Low which, with vivid imagination, he could people with the black-haired, long-headed men of prehistoric times whose every-day life was an open book to him. (<span class="italic">Transactions of the Lancashire and Cheshire Antiquarian Society</span>, 46, 1929, 141&#150;3)</blockquote>However his personal papers show that after the 1870s&#151;to the evident dismay of many of his more traditional colleagues&#151;he was increasingly drawn to &#145;applied&#146; (or engineering) geology. In 1882 he became adviser to one of the pioneering attempts to bore a channel tunnel. That scheme proved abortive, but led to his involvement with the Kent coalfield, which was discovered (through his guidance) in 1890. In the early 1880s he was also a consultant on the Humber Tunnel project. He advised on water supply at Hull, Dover, Eastbourne, Brighton, Worthing, Croydon, and other places and after 1877 also paid particular attention to the water supply from chalk in London by providing consultancy to various private and parliamentary bodies. Apparently, on questions of water supply &#145;he was more often engaged as an expert witness in the Law Courts than any other geologist of his day&#146;  (<span class="italic">Manchester Guardian</span>, 16 Jan 1929). His work also encompassed environmental damage and in 1892 he supported efforts to obtain compensation for those who suffered the effects of subsidence due to brine pumping in the Northwich salt district. Abroad he consulted for diamond mining firms in South Africa, oil shale prospectors in Australia, and Italian Carrara marble quarries.<br>
<br>Dawkins's industrial geology reached a peak between 1890 and 1910. His work was an important bridge between academe and industry in Manchester, where after the 1870s a number of academics&#151;for example, Sir Henry Roscoe in chemistry and Sir Arthur Schuster in physics&#151;were busy transforming Owens College into an advanced training and industrial research centre that owed much to the German model. Dawkins used the expertise he gained as a consultant to inform his teaching at the university and at Manchester Museum, where he widened the subject matter and gave it a practical bent. As museum curator he organized free public lectures on Saturday and Sunday afternoons. At the university, as professor of geology, palaeontology, and mining, he was attuned to the opportunities and commitments that stemmed from a location close to the northern coalfields, the salt deposits of Cheshire, the lead mines of Derbyshire, and the iron and copper mines of north Lancashire and Cumberland. In 1905 he instituted teaching classes for mining students and also appointed an assistant lecturer, so that he himself would have more time for the practical side of geology.<br>
<br>Dawkins was a man of great energy, who even at the age of ninety-one insisted on travelling to London to propose a toast at a Geological Society dinner. He also had a taste&#151;some have said weakness&#151;for the limelight of archaeological discovery. A great publicist, he had a number of acrimonious arguments that led to much press reporting. His industrial geology, especially the discovery of the Kent coalfield, brought him to even greater prominence. Among the honours that inevitably followed were the Lyell medal (1889) and the Prestwich medal (1918) awarded by the Geological Society of London, and a knighthood, conferred on him in 1919. He lived in some style (his income doubtless boosted by his engineering consultancy) first in Fallowfield, Manchester, and then at Richmond Lodge in Bowdon, Cheshire, surrounded by books and his collections of antique furniture and <i>cloisonn&eacute;</i> enamels (which he later donated to Manchester City Art Gallery). Dawkins's first wife died in 1921 and the following year he married Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Poole, the widow of Hubert Congreve.<br>
<br>He died at Richmond Lodge on 15 January 1929, survived by his daughter, Ella (<i>d</i>. 1969), and by his second wife. His remains were cremated at Manchester crematorium. He bequeathed his books and many of his papers to the town of Buxton, which later established a Boyd Dawkins room at its museum.<br>
