<span class="headword">Harvey,  Charles Barnet Cameron <span class="st"> [Roscoe]</span></span>  (1900&#150;1996), <span class="occ">army officer and racing administrator</span>, was born on 19 July 1900 in Sarawak, the son of Charles David Harvey, merchant of the Borneo Company. Following his father's death in 1901 he came to England with his mother. She rode to hounds with the Beaufort and Harvey learned to ride at an early age and fox-hunted throughout his youth. Despite inherited myopia which forced him to wear thick spectacles he was an outstanding games player and fine amateur rider. His first ride was at Cheltenham, when he fell off at the last fence while lying fourth. He also took up showjumping and lost the King George V Cup at the royal international horse show only after a jump off. He was known as Charles until one day in 1921 when he rode 2 pounds overweight at an Irish steeplechase; a fellow officer likened him to the film star Roscoe (Fatty) Arbuckle and the sobriquet stuck.<br>
<br>Educated at Downside, where he scraped through his school certificate, and at Sandhurst, where he required an interview to compensate for his poor entrance exam, Harvey joined the 10th hussars in 1920. After a spell at the Weedon Cavalry School he was appointed regimental equitation officer. On 25 October 1926 he married Iris Daphne (Biddy) Mylne (<i>b</i>. 1902/3), daughter of Ernest Mylne, merchant. There was one son and one daughter of the marriage, which ended in divorce. In 1929 Harvey went with his regiment to Egypt, where he spent his leisure time organizing a racing stable. He was then posted to Meerut in India, where he took up polo to international standard, tent-pegging, and pig-sticking, in which he reached the final of the Kadir cup, the blue riband of that sport. Later he was involved in the mechanization of his squadron and, wearing a red hat rather than the official tin one, he proved a dashing, front-line leader of armour in the Second World War, in which he was awarded three DSOs. In May 1940 he embarked for France as second in command of the 10th hussars and fought several brisk actions in tanks which, in his own words, &#145;wouldn't even stop a rifle bullet&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 30 March 1996) before being evacuated from Brest in June. He served in the Middle East in 1941 and for the final stages of the north African campaign he was commander of the 8th armoured brigade. On one occasion his thirty tanks, most of which were destroyed, engaged 160 Panzers of the German Afrika Korps and halted the German advance long enough for the British army to retreat behind the Alamein line. He also found time to organize horse-races in the sands of Tripoli. Later he took the 11th armoured division into France, where it fought its way across the Orne. Despite heavy casualties Harvey's vigorous leadership kept morale high. He spearheaded the recapture of Antwerp and was the British officer responsible for liberating Belsen. His men also captured William Joyce&#151;Lord Haw Haw&#151;and Heinrich Himmler, the SS chief. He once told Montgomery that &#145;being a master of hounds is a damn sight more difficult than being a general&#146;  (<span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span>, 29 March 1996). In Schleswig-Holstein at the end of the war he organized a series of race meetings with commandeered German thoroughbreds.<br>
<br>At the age of forty-six Harvey decided to leave the army, though he later became colonel of the 10th hussars. He wrote to his friend at the Jockey Club, Sir Humphrey de Trafford, enquiring about becoming a stipendary steward. On leaving the army in 1946 he was appointed a stewards' secretary, becoming senior stewards' secretary five years later. In this position he had a major role in controlling the discipline of British racing for two decades, though generally he aimed to prevent malfeasance rather than to punish it. As in his army days his humour and imperturbability concealed a determined and imposing character. He owned and bred National Hunt horses at Oddington Top, his Cotswold home near Moreton in Marsh, Gloucestershire. For three years he was also a member of the British Boxing Board of Control. On 23 February 1966 he married Betty Stoddard Horn (1905/6&#150;1980), a widow, and daughter of Louis Ezekiel Stoddard, financier. On Harvey's retirement in 1970 he was elected a member of the Jockey Club. Although he modestly claimed that he continued as senior steward for so long &#145;because he couldn't do anything else&#146;, champion jockey Sir Gordon Richards acknowledged him as &#145;the greatest man racing has known in my lifetime&#146;  (<span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span>, 29 March 1996). He died at his Gloucestershire home, Oddington Top, Oddington, on 28 March 1996 of bronchopneumonia, a few months after taking the salute from his wheelchair at the VJ parade at Stow on the Wold. He was survived by the daughter of his first marriage, Marion Jennefer Matthey.<br>
