<span class="headword">Chivers,  John</span>  (1857&#150;1929), <span class="occ">jam manufacturer</span>, was born on 27 June 1857 at Histon, near Cambridge, the third son of Stephen Chivers and his wife, Rebecca Frohock, from nearby Waterbeach. The Chivers family, active as farmers and fruit growers at Histon since 1806, had latterly built up a substantial trade in fruit deliveries to outside markets, assisted by the arrival of the railway in 1847. They established a wholesale depot at Bradford in Yorkshire in 1871, supplying the town's markets and local jam manufacturers with fruit. Two years later they began making jam in an unoccupied barn, using the recipe of a relative who was the chef at Pembroke College, Cambridge. A friendly grocer offered to dispose of their entire output.<br>
<br>John Chivers, after being educated locally and helping out during school holidays, took over the Bradford depot, but in 1875 was recalled to Histon. There he and his elder brother William ran the firm jointly, as their father moved towards retirement. In 1891 John married Emily Ann, daughter of Ephraim Barker Batterson, a farmer; they had four children. By the end of the century, the firm had diversified into jellies, tinned fruit, and custard powders, thus providing employment throughout the year. When William Chivers died prematurely in 1902, John became sole manager.<br>
<br>Under Chivers's control the firm grew from 1000 employees in 1902 to 3000 in 1929, the output of jams and jellies rising from just under 2800 tons in 1906 to 4600 tons in 1929. With the aid of a research laboratory, he steadily improved the quality of his products. In 1925 he opened a factory in Montrose, Scotland, for canning raspberries. While he paternalistically discouraged trade union activity, he set up a profit-sharing scheme for male employees as early as 1891, later allowing workers to buy shares in Chivers &amp; Sons Ltd. He also provided medical and nursing facilities, a subsidized canteen, and some housing. In common with many progressive firms at that date, in 1918 he formed a workers' committee to meet regularly with management.<br>
<br>Of modest stature, Chivers had a kindly, moustached face, with clear blue eyes and a fresh, outdoor complexion. An unobtrusive man, he revealed his mental gifts only in conversation, being able to make business problems interesting even to lay people. In his private life he strongly held that health could be improved by the daily consumption of some raw food. His principal interest outside his business lay in religious affairs, and he attended and supported Histon Baptist Church, which his father had founded in 1858; in the wider sphere he was treasurer of the Cambridgeshire Baptist Association, and for a time was on the council of the Baptist Union in London.<br>
<br>Among Chivers's benefactions, in 1903 he set up the Histon Social Institute and provided a field for the village's football and cricket clubs. He later paid for a building where evening classes were held for local people as well as employees. He was president of the Liberal associations of Histon and Impington, and of the county, and served as a JP. After a long illness, he died at his home, Homefield, Histon, on 15 March 1929.<br>
