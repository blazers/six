<span class="headword">Fairbairn, Sir  Peter</span>  (1799&#150;1861), <span class="occ">mechanical engineer</span>, youngest son of Andrew Fairbairn, a farmer, and brother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9067/', "Sir William Fairbairn")</script>, was born at Kelso, Roxburghshire, in September 1799. He left school at eleven to work in the Percy Main colliery near Newcastle upon Tyne. At fourteen he was apprenticed to John Casson, a millwright and engineer, in Newcastle.<br>
<br>After completing his apprenticeship, Fairbairn worked for Henry Houldsworth of Glasgow, a cotton spinner and machine maker, first as foreman, later as traveller. He then spent five years broadening his experience in millwrights' and machine-making firms in England and France, including spells with his brother William in Manchester, and at the works of John Rennie (1761&#150;1821) in London. He returned to Glasgow as a partner of Houldsworth.<br>
<br>Fairbairn's first wife, mother of his only son, Andrew, and two daughters, was Margaret, daughter of Robert Kennedy of Glasgow; she died in 1843. In 1855 he married Rachel Anne, fourth daughter of Robert William Brandling, of Low Gosforth, Newcastle, and widow of Captain Charles Bell RN.<br>
<br>Armed with ideas for improving flax and woollen machinery, Fairbairn moved to Leeds about 1826, where he set up in business in a small rented room. Lack of capital did not long hold him back, for he was assisted by John Marshall, the flax spinner, who had seen potential in Fairbairn's improved and simplified flax machinery. Marshall helped Fairbairn to move to larger premises, and for a time bought as many machines as Fairbairn could produce. Fairbairn's innovations included applying differential motion to the roving frame; introducing a rotary gill which was used widely on tow machinery; developing the screw gill motion into usable form; and increasing flax-spinning frames from forty spindles to eighty, as well as producing machines for preparing and spinning silk waste, and improvements in machinery for making rope yarn.<br>
<br>Fairbairn's designs were praised for their classical neatness, and they revolutionized flax and hemp preparation, enabling spinners to produce a far superior yarn at lower cost. He soon grew independent of Marshall's support, expanding his Wellington foundry to employ 550 men and boys by 1841, 850 a decade later, and 1400 in 1861. Fairbairn had been asked by the government to make special machine tools for armament production at Woolwich and Enfield during the Crimean War, and general engineering tools subsequently made up a large share of his business.<br>
<br>A Liberal of moderate views, Fairbairn served on the town council from 1836 until 1842, and in 1854 was elected an alderman. A Leeds and West Riding magistrate, Fairbairn was mayor of Leeds in 1857&#150;8 and 1858&#150;9. A new town hall was opened by the queen in 1858 and Fairbairn was knighted during the royal visit. Besides the energy, resolution, and business acumen which had brought him commercial success, he was admired for his integrity. He supported educational and religious causes, and had a broad interest in the arts, including music and drama.<br>
<br>Peter Fairbairn died on 4 January 1861, at Woodsley House, Clarendon Road, Leeds, and was buried in Adel churchyard, Leeds, after a public funeral attended by 700 of his workpeople. He was survived by his second wife.<br>
