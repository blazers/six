<span class="headword">Schonfeld,  Solomon</span>  (1912&#150;1984), <span class="occ">rabbi and rescuer of persecuted Jews</span>, was born on 21 February 1912 at 125 Green Lanes, Stoke Newington, London, the second of seven children (six boys and one girl) of Victor (Avigdor) Schonfeld (1880&#150;1930), rabbi and teacher, and his wife, Ella (Rachel-Leah) Sternberg (1890&#150;1971). Schonfeld was educated at the Highbury county school (1923&#150;7), and studied at the <i>yeshiva</i> in Tyrnau (Trnava), Czechoslovakia (1927&#150;9), with Rabbi Michael-Ber Weissmandl (his distant relative, mentor, and inspiration for rescue efforts). Schonfeld returned to London in December 1929 intending to study law but, as a consequence of his father's sudden death in January 1930 and his being chosen to assume his father's role, he went back to rabbinical school, subsequently transferring to the <i>yeshiva</i> of Slobodka, Lithuania, simultaneously studying for a doctorate at the University of K&ouml;nigsberg.<br>
<br>In 1933, at the age of twenty-one, Schonfeld returned to London with a beard, ordination, and a PhD to assume his father's positions as rabbi of the Adath Yisroel Synagogue and presiding rabbi of the Union of Orthodox Hebrew Congregations. He greatly expanded both the union and his father's Jewish secondary school (renamed the Avigdor School after his father), the first Jewish Orthodox day school in England. Later he founded the Hasmonean Grammar Schools. He eventually established four Jewish primary schools, whose goal was to instil in the students a pride as Orthodox Jews, comfortable in both Jewish and general society. This reflected the deep-seated commitment by father and son to the Hirschian ideology (so called after Rabbi Samson Raphael Hirsch) of combining strict, independent Orthodoxy with secular education.<br>
<br>Beginning in 1933 the massive refugee problem caused by Hitler's antisemitism resulted in large-scale immigration of German and later Austrian Jewish refugees, for whom the Anglo-Jewish establishment provided a guarantee to the British government to prevent their becoming a public charge. Since the ultimate destination for these refugees was re-emigration elsewhere, including Palestine, the organizations gave priority to the young and the Zionist orientated. This resulted in discrimination against the Orthodox, especially against rabbis, teachers, and other religious functionaries, who were deemed most unassimilable by the secular Jewish organizations, with whom they feared to be identified. Prompted by pleas from Weissmandl to aid those forsaken, Schonfeld changed his focus to rescue. To gain access to governmental agencies and important non-Jewish personalities Schonfeld associated with the chief rabbi, Joseph H. Hertz, in early 1938, creating the Chief Rabbi's Religious Emergency Council (known as the Chief Rabbi's Council or the CRREC). The chief rabbi publicly supported Schonfeld despite the vehement opposition of the Anglo-Jewish establishment, Hertz's natural constituency, which considered Schonfeld a loose cannon. Their refusal to support his rescue efforts necessitated Schonfeld's personal guarantee for every refugee. Since he eventually had full personal responsibility for the physical and spiritual well-being of more than 2000 people, including children and rabbis, he had to raise funds and intercede with the government and non-Jewish leadership. Although the council had a formal secretary, close associates, and a volunteer staff, it was essentially a one-man operation. The chief rabbi gave Schonfeld complete freedom in matters of rescue, and lent Schonfeld the full prestige of his office. One result of Schonfeld's frequent contact with Hertz was meeting his eldest daughter, Judith (1913&#150;1987), whom he married on 16 January 1940; they spent their honeymoon in Palestine. They had three sons, Victor (<i>b</i>. 1940), Jonathan Benedict (<i>b</i>. 1944), and Jeremy (<i>b</i>. 1951).<br>
<br>In addition to his creative approach Rabbi Schonfeld was blessed with a dynamic personality and an awesome physical presence. He was described by Rabbi Hertz, his newly acquired father-in-law, as &#145;an exceptionally handsome man, six-foot high, blue eyes, a renowned <i>shnorrer</i> [fund-raiser]&#146;, persuasive and affable, willing to do everything in his power, including bending rules, and displaying &#145;fearlessness toward the assimilated [Jewish] aristocracy&#146;  (private information), to save Jewish lives. Raising half a million pounds for relief and rescue while living solely on the meagre salary paid by his congregation he earned the respect and admiration of both government officials and lay leaders. He mobilized all his incredible strengths to meet his greatest challenge: saving Jewish lives.<br>
<br>During the year and a half before war broke out Schonfeld obtained permission from the Home Office, which was most co-operative, to bring more than 1300 rabbis, teachers, and their families from Germany. He also organized a transport of 300 children from Vienna, whom he placed in Jewish homes or kosher hostels. In order to bring out about 200 rabbinic students aged sixteen to eighteen he created and staffed a <i>yeshiva</i> (Ohr Yisroel). At the same time he helped Weissmandl and the Revisionist Zionists organize an illegal transport from Vienna to Palestine. He also obtained 340 Mauritius visas that served as protective papers for many Jews in Nazi-occupied territories.<br>
<br>During the war his efforts shifted back to Britain. When in 1940, due to fear of a German invasion, 25,000 aliens, mostly Jewish refugees, were interned Schonfeld was the first, and for a long time the only person to tour the camps and obtain physical and spiritual improvements for all, including the release of 1000 hardship cases. When he learned that two million Jews had been murdered he devised a rescue plan in January 1943, with the help of Eleanor Rathbone MP, to convince 277 MPs to offer a rescue resolution that would provide sanctuary for Jews throughout the dominions. However, due to Zionist objections to the omission of Palestine, this resolution never materialized. He also conveyed, unsuccessfully, Weissmandl's plea for the allies to bomb the rail lines to Auschwitz. Schonfeld obtained permission for thirty rabbis and families to leave Siberia for Palestine via Tehran. He likewise provided 25,000 Jewish servicemen in Britain and abroad with free kosher food packages and religious articles. He supervised the evacuation of 550 students from the Avigdor School during the London blitz to the village of Shefford, where, throughout the war, he provided them with a complete Jewish educational programme and kosher facilities.<br>
<br>The conclusion of the war presented Schonfeld with a new array of challenges. First, he fitted out twelve large mobile synagogue&#150;ambulances with kosher food, religious articles, medicine, and clothing. They were sent to newly liberated territories including the Netherlands, Germany, France, and Czechoslovakia, and displaced persons camps. Their objective was to set up Orthodox communities and help the broken survivors regain their physical, psychological, and spiritual health, and especially a renewed pride in being Jewish. Schonfeld brought hundreds of youngsters from Prague (the last in 1948), and made five trips to post-war Poland to help returning survivors reconstruct Orthodox communities and above all, rescue 500 orphans (Orthodox and non-Orthodox) from a dangerous situation. In the process he narrowly escaped assassination. When another situation required immediate exodus, Schonfeld simply purchased a boat to take 150 children to England. In 1946 he went on a mission to Cyprus to improve the physical as well as spiritual lives of thousands of Jewish internees. By 1948 Schonfeld concluded the council's work. In all more than 3700 refugees were virtually single-handedly rescued by Rabbi Schonfeld. In addition countless thousands of others directly benefited from his efforts. He now focused on his rabbinic, education, and writing projects. During the 1960s he set up a community centre in Ashdod, Israel, complete with a synagogue and <i>yeshiva</i>. His writings included <span class="italic">Jewish Religious Education</span> (1943), <span class="italic">The Universal Bible</span> (1955), <span class="italic">Message to Jewry</span> (1959), <span class="italic">Why Judaism</span> (1963), <span class="italic">Standard Siddur-Prayer Book</span> (1973), and <span class="italic">A New&#150;Old Rendering of Psalms</span> (1980). His health deteriorated following an operation in 1965 for a benign tumour. By 1982 he was an invalid, cared for by some of those he saved. He died at the Whittington Hospital, Archway, Islington, on 6 February 1984. He was buried next day in the cemetery of the Adath Yisroel Synagogue in Cheshunt, Hertfordshire.<br>
