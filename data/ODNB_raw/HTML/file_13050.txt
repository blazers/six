<span class="headword">Herbert,  Thomas</span>, eighth earl of Pembroke and fifth earl of Montgomery  (1656/7&#150;1733), <span class="occ">politician and government official</span>, was probably born at Castle Baynard, London. He was the third surviving son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13043/', "Philip Herbert, fifth earl of Pembroke (bap. 1621, d. 1669)")</script>, MP for Wiltshire (1640) and Glamorgan (1640&#150;49), councillor and president of the council of state (1651&#150;2) [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13042/', "Herbert, Philip, first earl of Montgomery and fourth earl of Pembroke")</script>], and his second wife, Katherine Villiers (<i>d</i>. 1678), daughter of Sir William Villiers, bt, of Brooksby, Leicester. Thomas was the brother and heir of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13044/', "Philip Herbert, seventh earl of Pembroke (1653&#150;1683)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13042/', "Herbert, Philip, first earl of Montgomery and fourth earl of Pembroke")</script>], a notorious rake &#145;chiefly known for deeds of drunkenness and manslaughter&#146;  (GEC, <span class="italic">Peerage</span>, 10.422), who had himself succeeded his elder brother, William Herbert, sixth earl (1640&#150;1674), MP for Glamorgan (1661&#150;9).<br>
<br>Thomas Herbert matriculated from Christ Church, Oxford, on 18 March 1673 at the age of sixteen. In 1676 he undertook a three-year tour of France and Italy, upon which he met and befriended John Locke. He is also supposed to have studied the law. He was elected on his own interest as a moderate tory MP for Wilton (1679&#150;81). He sat on no committees, made no speeches, and was absent from the division on the <span class="roman">Exclusion Bill</span>. Following his accession to the peerage on 29 August 1683 he was named lord lieutenant of Wiltshire, serving almost continuously until his death in 1733. He was also JP and <i>custos rotulorum</i> of Glamorgan (1683&#150;1728) and of Pembroke (1683&#150;1715).<br>
<br>Pembroke married, first, on 26 July 1684, Margaret Sawyer, who was the daughter and heir of Sir Robert Sawyer of Highclere, Hampshire, attorney-general (1681&#150;7), and his wife, Margaret, daughter of Ralph Suckeley of Canonbury, Islington, Middlesex. This union produced seven sons and five daughters. The countess died on 27 November 1706 and was buried on 9 December in Salisbury Cathedral. Pembroke married, second, on 21 September 1708 at St James's, Westminster, Barbara, the widow of John Arundell, Lord Arundell of Trerice, and, previously, of Sir Richard Mauleverer. She was the daughter of Sir Thomas Slingsby, bt, of Scriven, Yorkshire, and Dorothy, daughter and coheir of George Cradock of Caverswall Castle, Staffordshire. The countess gave birth to a daughter. She died on 1 August 1721 and was buried in Salisbury Cathedral on the 9th. Pembroke married, third, on 14 June 1725, Mary, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13964/', "Scrope Howe, first Viscount Howe of Ireland")</script>, and Juliana, daughter of William, third Baron Alington of Killard, Ireland. She was a maid of honour to Caroline as princess of Wales and a lady of the bedchamber to her as queen. Their marriage apparently caused &#145;much pleasantry&#146; at court  (GEC, <span class="italic">Peerage</span>, 10.424).<br>
<br>Pembroke bore the third sword at the coronation of James II and was to bear swords at those of every subsequent monarch crowned in his lifetime. In June 1685 he commanded the Wiltshire and Hampshire trained bands raised to oppose Monmouth's rebellion. In September of that year he was appointed commander of the British regiments in the Netherlands. However, in 1687, upon his refusal to put the three questions on repeal of the test and penal laws or to assist in regulating municipal corporations, he was deprived of his lieutenancy.<br>
<br>During the revolution of 1688&#150;9 Pembroke played the ambiguous role of a moderate tory: though in correspondence with the prince of Orange, he offered his services to King James upon the Dutch landing. While he was one of four peers who conveyed to the prince the invitation of 11 December to summon a free parliament and suggested the expedient of a Convention on the 24th, in debate he raised the issue of the prince of Wales's claims; argued against the demise of the crown to Mary and for a regency; and finally voted against declaring William and Mary king and queen. However, when his position on the disposition of the crown was defeated he demonstrated characteristic thoughtfulness and practicality, counselling Clarendon against seceding from the Convention on the grounds that &#145;the government must be supported, or else we should all be ruined&#146;  (Western, 315).<br>
<br>Pembroke began a distinguished administrative and diplomatic career under William III by being restored to the lieutenancy of Wiltshire and by serving as ambassador to the Dutch states general from April to October 1689. In the same year he was named a privy councillor and a lord of trade and plantations. In January 1690 he became first lord of the Admiralty. He rose from the Admiralty to be lord privy seal in March 1692, then lord president of the council in May 1699. He combined the latter duty with his previous post at the Admiralty from March 1701 to January 1702, when he became lord high admiral. Pembroke was an active naval administrator and his contemporaries thought him more than competent. He was also named lord lieutenant of south Wales and Monmouth from 1694 to 1715. More substantial indications of the king's regard for him include his appointment as a lord justice during each of William's absences from England; his position as first plenipotentiary at the treaty of Ryswick in 1697; and his nomination as a knight of the Garter and grant of &pound;1000, in addition to his official salaries, in 1700. Mary, on the other hand, thought him a &#145;man of honour, but not very steady&#146;  (Van der Zee and Van der Zee, 326).<br>
<br>At the accession of Queen Anne, Pembroke ceased to be lord high admiral in favour of Prince George, but was reappointed lord president of the council and was awarded a pension which rose by 1704 to &pound;2500 per annum. His position as a reliable court tory who supported the War of the Spanish Succession allowed Anne to appoint him in preference to insistent Junto candidates for the lord lieutenancy of Ireland in 1707 and, at the death of Prince George, lord high admiral on 25 November 1708. Anne finally gave way to the Junto in November 1709 by asking for Pembroke's resignation, but not before raising his pension to &pound;3000 per annum some two months previously. Apart from his appointment as a commissioner of claims for the coronation in 1714, this marked his virtual retirement from active government service.<br>
<br>In office, Pembroke was the very soul of moderate court toryism. According to Geoffrey Holmes, &#145;No Tory could object to him, and no Whig could consider his presence there in any way threatening&#146;  (Holmes, 253&#150;4). In cabinet, he supported Marlborough and Godolphin's war strategy against his high-tory colleagues; and he was one of the few tory negotiators for the Union. He continued to defend the duumvirs during the ministerial crisis of 1708, when he followed Somerset in refusing to sit in cabinet without them. In parliament his voting record tended to be more independent. Thus, he voted for the <span class="roman">Occasional Conformity Bill</span> in 1703 and for Henry Sacheverell's innocence in 1710, but against the resumption bill in 1701 and in favour of the voting rights of Scottish peers of Great Britain in 1709. A Hanoverian tory, he opposed the Oxford ministry on the Hamilton peerage and No Peace Without Spain in 1711, the commercial treaty in 1713, and the <span class="roman">Schism Bill</span> in 1714. He was anything but doctrinaire or vindictive: in 1717 he voted against the impeachment of Oxford, an act which eventually cost him his pension, which had been reduced previously by George I to &pound;2000. Similarly, he opposed Fenwick's attainder in 1697, though he was willing to use the bill as a threat in order to exact full disclosure from the accused.<br>
<br>Pembroke had a reputation as a patron of the arts and sciences, a collector, and a virtuoso. Gilbert Burnet described him as a man &#145;of great and profound learning, particularly in the mathematics&#146;  (Burnet, 4.361). He was elected FRS on 13 May 1685, admitted on 26 January 1687, and served as president of the society in 1689&#150;90: initially a fairly active member, he attended not a single meeting during his presidency. He patronized Locke, who dedicated the <span class="italic">Essay Concerning Human Understanding</span> to him. He purchased most of the collection at Wilton, including the Arundel marbles. William III thought so highly of his Van Dycks that he insisted that his secretary Constantijn Huygens, who had bypassed Wilton, go back to see them during his progress to London in December 1688. Macky described Pembroke as &#145;a good judge in all the several sciences&#146;, but Hearne thought him &#145;not a man of that deep Penetration nor of that profound Learning he is taken to be&#146;  (GEC, <span class="italic">Peerage</span>, 10.424). There seems to be a similar disagreement over Pembroke's character and private life. While Macky commended him for his simplicity of life and unaffected manners, and Marlborough thought him &#145;a very honest man &hellip; of an extreordinary good temper&#146;  (Snyder, 1.86&#150;7), it would appear that he possessed some of his family's hot-headedness when in drink. This may help to explain Halifax's equivocal estimation of him: &#145;as mad as most of his family tho' very good natured&#146;  (Western, 329).<br>
<br>Pembroke died at his house in St James's Square, London, on 22 January 1733. He was buried on 31 January in Salisbury Cathedral. He was survived by his third wife, who married, second, the Hon. John Mordaunt in 1735. The earl's first son and heir, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13033/', "Henry Herbert, ninth earl of Pembroke and sixth earl of Montgomery (c.1689&#150;1750)")</script>, was a gentleman of the bedchamber to George II as prince of Wales (1714&#150;27) and as king (1728&#150;35), and groom of the stole from 1735 until his death.<br>
