<span class="headword">Findlay,  John Ritchie</span>  (1824&#150;1898), <span class="occ">newspaper proprietor and philanthropist</span>, born at Arbroath on 21 October 1824, was the son of Peter Findlay (<i>d</i>. 1833?), draper, and grandnephew of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/23676/', "John Ritchie")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/23679/', "Ritchie, William")</script>], one of the founders of the <span class="italic">Scotsman</span> newspaper. He was educated at Bathgate Academy and the University of Edinburgh. In 1842 he joined <span class="italic">The Scotsman</span>; it was then a small paper, published twice a week at the price of 4<i>d</i>. He was engaged at first on the commercial side (writing addresses on the covers of the country papers), then took part in editing the paper under the supervision of Alexander Russel and Charles M'Laren (see Findlay's memoir in Cooper, <span class="italic">Editor's Retrospect</span>). Findlay was interested in the literary side of the paper; in his youth he was a friend of De Quincey, whose <span class="italic">Personal Recollections</span> he edited in 1886. He also wrote on Scottish poverty. In April 1868 he became a partner in the firm, and on the death of his great-uncle in 1870, the bulk of the property passed into his hands. In his later years Findlay gave up the immediate direction of his paper, but never ceased to take a deep interest in it and to control its general policy. The politics of <span class="italic">The Scotsman</span> were initially Liberal, but in the home-rule controversy of 1886 it took a very strong unionist line. The adoption of this attitude by the leading Scottish paper, and the main paper of Gladstone's constituency, was a political event of no small import.<br>
<br>During the period of Findlay's connection with <span class="italic">The Scotsman</span> the influence and circulation of the paper greatly increased, and its proprietor became a rich man. But he lived unostentatiously, and regarded his wealth chiefly as a means of benefiting his fellow citizens. He did not approve of posthumous benevolence, but spent large sums on public objects during his lifetime. In November 1882 Findlay anonymously offered &pound;10,000 to get under way the establishment of a Scottish national portrait gallery. He became a trustee of the portrait gallery committee, though without revealing his role as donor, and gave further sums, which by the 1890s amounted to over &pound;60,000. His position as anonymous donor became extremely complicated as he was also on the board of trustees of manufactures and he was secretary of the Society of Antiquaries, both of which were involved in the negotiations, the antiquaries sharing the building in Queen Street, Edinburgh, built with Findlay's money. His identity as donor was announced when the gallery was inaugurated in 1889. Findlay was also active in the affairs of the Scottish National Gallery, to which he gave works of art. He was interested in the history of Edinburgh and paid for the restoration of the Dean Village, with the provision of working-class housing. Findlay was a vehement proponent of the university education of women and was chairman of the Association for the Medical Education of Women. He was a director of the Sick Children's Hospital in Edinburgh, and one of the founders of the Society for Improving the Condition of the Poor. On his estate of Aberlour in Banffshire, which he acquired in 1885, Findlay spent more than he received in reclaiming land, making roads, and building cottages for his tenants. Disliking political elections he never held a municipal office, and he refused a baronetcy in 1896; but the same year he accepted the freedom of the city of Edinburgh.<br>
<br>On 27 October 1863 Findlay married Susan Leslie, the thirty-year-old daughter of James Leslie, civil engineer, at 2 Charlotte Street, Edinburgh; they had ten children. Their town houses were in Queen Street and Rothesay Terrace, Edinburgh, and they lived for a time at Hatton House, Midlothian, whose history Findlay wrote. He was a member of the Church of Scotland: his religious views were strong, but entirely devoid of sectarianism or bitterness. In person he was somewhat below middle height, spare, and of a fair complexion. His features were sharply cut, his expression shrewd but kindly. He died at Aberlour House, Aberlour, on 16 October 1898, his wife surviving him.<br>
