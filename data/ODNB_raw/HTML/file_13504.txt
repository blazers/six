<span class="headword">Holgate,  Robert</span>  (1481/2&#150;1555), <span class="occ">archbishop of York</span>, was the youngest son of Thomas Holgate and his wife, Elizabeth, members of a family of lower gentry in Hemsworth, Yorkshire.<h2>
<a name="Canonandbishop"></a>Canon and bishop</h2>Holgate was educated in Cambridge, where he proceeded BTh in 1524, and DTh in 1537, having resided near Peterhouse in a study house belonging to the Gilbertine order. He entered that order as a canon and was to play an important role in the life of the community in the years before the dissolution of the monasteries. Appointed prior of St Catherine's-without-Lincoln in 1529, by 1534 he had been promoted to the position of master of Sempringham, the head of the Gilbertine order. His opponents were to claim that he owed this appointment to the agency of Thomas Cromwell, but Holgate's career continued long after Cromwell's fall, as one of the main players in the religious upheavals in England between 1530 and 1555.<br>
<br>As master of the Gilbertines Holgate settled at the house in Watton in Yorkshire as its prior, and he continued to exercise this role even after his promotion to higher office in the church. He was to be responsible for the surrender of the Gilbertine order in December 1539, during the dissolution, and as prior of Watton he received a substantial pension, amounting to some &pound;68 per annum. In 1541 he was granted priory land and eight of its manors, as well as a house in the London parish of St Sepulchre. In March 1537 he was appointed as bishop of Llandaff, a position that again seems to have been due to Cromwell's favour. He was consecrated as bishop by John Hilsey, who had replaced the executed John Fisher as bishop of Rochester, and who had marked out his own evangelical credentials in the campaign to expose the alleged fraud behind the rood of Boxley and the blood of Hailes. It has been suggested that Holgate had gravitated towards the emerging evangelical grouping in Cambridge during his time there, and that the choice of Hilsey to officiate at the consecration was thus in keeping with Holgate's own views. He had certainly been a contemporary of such men as Cranmer, Barnes, and Ridley in Cambridge, and was not unsympathetic to the Reformation of the 1530s and 1540s.<h2>
<a name="Thegovernmentofthenorth"></a>The government of the north</h2>Holgate's position at Watton had come under threat in 1536 when the house was targeted by the rebels leading the Pilgrimage of Grace. His position was not without ambiguities. In his confession, Robert Aske made it clear that he viewed Holgate as a prot&eacute;g&eacute; of Cromwell, but there were also charges that Holgate did little to ensure the defence of the house from the rebels, and indeed he fled as the rebel army approached. But the canons seem to have remained loyal to their prior, and in fact Holgate was to benefit from the turbulent events of 1536&#150;7. In the aftermath of the defeat of the rebels efforts were made to strengthen royal government in the north of the county, and Holgate was appointed president of the council of the north in 1538, a post he held for eleven years. Despite his importance within the Gilbertines he was not a major force in the politics of the north, and probably for this reason he received upon his appointment a number of instructions from the crown, outlining the structure of the council and concerns of the king. Most reflected the perceived need for &#145;good governance&#146;, including the collection of rents, the limitation of liveries, and the suppression of pro-papal sentiments and acts. After initial troubles, not least the fact that the new lord president would need a residence in the north (the former house of the abbot of St Mary's was provided), it is clear that Holgate was a useful appointment for the crown, in both practical and financial terms&#151;after he became archbishop Henry was able to cut by two-thirds the payments made to him as lord president.<br>
<br>Following the death of Archbishop Lee on 13 September 1544, the earl of Shrewsbury recommended Holgate, as &#145;an honest and painstaking man&#146;, to be his successor  (<span class="italic">LP Henry VIII</span>, 19/2, no. 239), and Holgate was duly consecrated at Lambeth on 26 January 1545, renouncing papal authority. Henry VIII was quick to seize the opportunities for land transfer presented by Holgate's elevation, and one of the latter's first actions as archbishop of York was to alienate some sixty-seven diocesan manors, to the impoverishment of the see. The baronies of Hexham, Ripon, Sherburn, Scrooby, and Churchdown were ceded to the crown, in return for the rectories which made up what came to be known as the &#145;great collection&#146;. But Holgate escaped the seizures of church land under Protector Somerset, and his activities as archbishop suggest he was one of the more competent of the former religious to rise to high office. Certainly he made the best of the uncertain financial situation of his bishopric and the available lands. At his death he was able to leave the estate of Sand Hutton to the hospital that he had founded at Hemsworth, and his will suggests strong investment in farming, showing that he possessed some 2500 sheep, about 100 horses, and quantities of grain in store.<h2>
<a name="Theologianandreformer"></a>Theologian and reformer</h2>Archbishop Holgate was to be a loyal servant of the crown, acting as both lord president and archbishop for five years. He did much to assist the military efforts of the duke of Somerset in Scotland in the reign of Edward VI, at great personal cost. His policy of co-operation with Somerset was built upon the relationship that the two men had developed during the latter's time as lieutenant-general in the north in the latter years of the reign of Henry VIII, but their alliance and friendship would cost Holgate dear after the fall of Somerset and the rise to power of John Dudley, later duke of Northumberland. As someone who had worked closely with Somerset, Holgate was clearly an object of suspicion, even after his removal from the presidency in 1550, and he himself records that Northumberland taunted him as a papist. But Holgate's own words and actions suggest that he was sympathetic to reform. He is listed in the commission for the composition of the <span class="roman">Bishops' Book</span> in 1537, and in 1540 was appointed a member of the committee that compiled the <span class="italic">Rationale of Ceremonial</span>; the latter remained unpublished until 1910, probably because the evangelical members of the committee, most notably Goodrich and Holgate, prevented any discussion of the eucharist. Holgate was also named to the doctrinal commission established by Henry VIII in April 1541, while in 1542, as part of the plan to produce a revised translation of the <span class="roman">Bible</span>, the epistles of <span class="roman">Peter</span> were assigned to him.<br>
<br>In his response to a set of questions sent to the bishops late in 1547 concerning matters of doctrine and practice, Holgate displayed an enthusiasm for the vernacular liturgy, arguing that it was appropriate to use &#145;such speech in the Mass as the people might well understand&#146;  (Burnet, 5.211&#150;12). His injunctions for York Minster, issued in August 1552, display a strong commitment to the vernacular scriptures, and a clear concern that the clergy of the diocese should be well equipped to preach the word. All vicars and deacons were required to memorize parts of the Pauline epistles each week, and the choristers were to learn chapters of <span class="roman">Acts</span> or the gospels. All vicars were expected to possess a copy of the vernacular scriptures, and to read a chapter after dinner and after supper. The minster library was to be supplied with the works of the fathers, Lutheran literature, and works by Erasmus, Calvin, and Bullinger. Education was clearly important to the archbishop, who founded three schools, in York, Hemsworth, and Old Malton, and offered financial support to several others. Holgate was appointed to serve on the two Yorkshire chantry commissions, and his apparent friendship with the evangelical William Turner suggests that there was some common ground between the two men. The archbishop was also happy to find employment for the Scottish reformer John Rough in his diocese, securing a stipend for him at Hull.<br>
<br>Holgate's acceptance of doctrinal change in the reign of Edward VI is evidenced by the visible changes that he made to his cathedral. After his first visitation of the minster in 1547 Holgate had demanded that repairs be made to the fabric, and that the condition of ornaments and clerical vestments be improved. However as the Edwardian Reformation advanced Holgate was to oversee substantial changes, including the removal of images from above the high altar, and their replacement with texts from scripture. Organ music in the minster was abolished, and singing was expected to be plain and audible. The result of Holgate's work has been described as the transformation of the building from &#145;a resplendent if somewhat shabby edifice of late medieval Catholicism to a sombre temple of the new Protestantism&#146;  (Cross, 200).<br>
<br>Nevertheless there were signs that Holgate did not hold to some of the more radical opinions expressed in the reign of Edward. In response to the question on the eucharist put to him in 1547, Holgate's reply, buttressed with references to the <span class="roman">New Testament</span>, suggests a more conservative attitude than that of some of his fellow bishops, stating that:<blockquote>the oblations and sacrifice of Christ in the Mass is the presenting of the very body and blood of Christ to the heavenly father, under the forms of bread and wine, consecrated in the remembrance of his passion with prayer and thanksgiving for the universal church. (Burnet, 5.201, 203)</blockquote>Although he was appointed to the committee for the revision of the prayer book in 1551, Holgate's allegiance was given rather to the first Edwardian prayer book of 1549. But his evangelical credentials should not be doubted: he has been suggested as a plausible successor to Thomas Cranmer had the plot to subvert the succession in 1553 succeeded and the protestant Jane Grey secured the throne.<h2>
<a name="Marriagedeprivationanddeath"></a>Marriage, deprivation, and death</h2>Doctrinal issues were not the only cause of conflict between Holgate and Dudley. The latter secured Holgate's removal from the presidency of the council of the north, and his designs on the archbishop's lands at Watton were to sour relations further. Moreover Holgate was later to claim that it was pressure from Northumberland that had led him to marry at the age of sixty-eight, and this marriage to Barbara Wentworth, celebrated in January 1550, threatened to become something of a scandal. The legality of the marriage was challenged by one Anthony Norman, who had been espoused to Wentworth in childhood. The law required that both parties give their consent to marriage on reaching the age of discretion, and this Barbara refused to do, instead pursuing a claim for annulment, evidently successfully. Perhaps inspired by the financial rewards reaped by the first husband of the wife of John Ponet, bishop of Winchester, Norman lodged a suit against Holgate, with the result that in November 1551 Holgate and his wife were summoned before the privy council. The order was then retracted, however, suggesting that the marriage of the archbishop was accepted by the government. But the same was not true of the more conservative laity and clergy of the diocese of York, including Robert Parkyn, curate of Adwick-le-Street, whose account of the Reformation made much capital out of the embarrassment of Holgate, and indeed of other married clerics. Holgate's position was to worsen dramatically with the accession of Mary in 1553. He was deprived of his see on 16 March 1554, alongside bishops Ferrar, Bird, and Bush, all married men and former monastics. The commissions of deprivation made it clear that marriage was their major offence, and when Holgate tried to recover his position later in 1554 in his <span class="italic">Apology</span>, his marriage provided the starting point.<br>
<br>The text of the <span class="italic">Apology</span>, addressed to the council through Sir Richard Southwell, is a valiant effort at self-justification, and sheds light upon both the character of the archbishop, and the events and controversies of the Reformation in the north of England. A. G. Dickens, writing in 1937, denounced it as a &#145;cringing&#146; document, but later modified this position and, in recognition of the importance of the text, printed it in full. Probably writing late in 1554, Holgate uses his <span class="italic">Apology</span> to petition to be released from imprisonment in the Tower, and expresses the hope that he may be restored to sacerdotal functions. He was indeed released in January 1555, but that was the limit of his success. Holgate died on 15 November following, apparently in his London house, and was probably buried in the church of St Sepulchre nearby.<br>
<br>Holgate's <span class="italic">Apology</span> expresses regret on only one point&#151;his marriage. The petition opens with an admission that he has married a &#145;gentilwoman&#146; named Barbara Wentworth, but asserts that he did so only &#145;by the councell of Edwarde then the Duke of Somerset and for feare of the laite Duke of Northumberlande using to call him papiste and he thought verelye then that he myght have done soo by Godes lawes and the Kinges&#146;  (Dickens, <span class="italic">Reformation Studies</span>, 355). In contrast to this error of judgement, he outlines the able service that he has given to Henry VIII and Edward VI in the defence of order in the north, and promises that he will serve the queen if she grants him his freedom. Holgate points to the example of the other deprived bishops and claims that they were &#145;moche further gone amysse in religion then he was&#146;  (ibid., 357), although he does concede that by his marriage he has set a poor example to others, particularly those clergy in his diocese who have married. Holgate clearly hopes that he will be permitted to recover his lands and incomes, and concludes his petition by offering the queen the sum of &pound;1000 as a token of his obedience and service. At the age of seventy-four, imprisoned in the Tower, Holgate had clearly decided to throw in his lot with the new regime. His career and more particularly his marriage point to sympathy with the ideals of the Edwardian Reformation, but his last months suggest a return to loyalties formed before the decade of more radical activity that did so much to shape his reputation.<br>
