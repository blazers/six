<span class="headword">Perry <span class="st"> [Parry]</span>,  Henry</span>  (1560/61&#150;1617), <span class="occ">linguistic scholar</span>, was born at Greenfield, Flintshire. Through his father, Harri Owen, he was descended from the Tudor family of Penmynydd, Anglesey, and could trace descent from Llewellyn ap Gruffudd, last native prince of Wales (<i>d</i>. 1282). His name is also given as Parry, and he was possibly the elder brother of Robert Parry, rector of Llanfair Pwllgwyngyll (1603). He matriculated at Balliol College, Oxford, on 20 March 1579, aged eighteen, graduated BA from Gloucester Hall on 14 January 1580, and proceeded MA on 23 March 1583 and BTh from Jesus College on 6 June 1597. He is recorded in Bishop Rowlands' register as holding the degree of DTh in 1601, but there is no corroboration of this. After leaving the university about 1583 he spent some years abroad and married for the first time, but little is known of him until he returned to north Wales as chaplain to Sir Richard Bulkeley of Baron Hill, near Beaumaris. After his first wife's death he married about 1600 Elizabeth, daughter of Robert Vaughan, gentleman, of Beaumaris. Through Bulkeley's influence he secured a succession of benefices in Anglesey&#151;rector of Rhoscolyn (21 August 1601), of Trefdraeth (3 December 1606), and of Llanfachraeth (5 March 1614). On 6 February 1613 he was installed as a canon and prebendary of Bangor Cathedral.<br>
<br>The lexicographer John Davies describes Perry as a man very skilled in languages who worked towards the compiling of a Welsh dictionary, but his only published work was <span class="italic">Egluryn ffraethineb</span> (&#145;The elucidator of eloquence&#146;). Published in 1595, this was a pioneer work in Welsh on rhetoric which drew on earlier work by William Salesbury and treatises by English writers of the period. The thirteen poems which preface this edition, variously in Greek, Latin, English, and Welsh, show the esteem in which Perry was held by his contemporaries. A second edition, with omissions, was published in 1807 and reprinted in 1829. A reprint of the original was published in 1930; the introduction (in Welsh) by G. J. Williams contains a valuable assessment of Perry's work.<br>
<br>Perry had a daughter from either his first or his second marriage who married Thomas Maurice, curate of Llangristiolus, Anglesey, and they were the parents of Henry Maurice, Lady Margaret professor of divinity at Oxford. Perry died some time before 30 December 1617, when a successor was appointed to his prebend. His widow, Elizabeth, married William Owen, his successor as rector of Llanfachraeth.<br>
