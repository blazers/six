<span class="headword">Boydell,  Josiah</span>  (1752&#150;1817), <span class="occ">artist and publisher</span>, was born on 18 January 1752 at the Manor House, Hawarden, Flintshire, the fourth of nine children of Samuel Boydell (1727&#150;1783), farmer, and his wife Ann, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Turner (1725&#150;1764). Apprenticed in 1766 to his uncle, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/3120/', "John Boydell")</script>, for seven years, he studied painting under Benjamin West and mezzotint engraving under Richard Earlom. His later, principal, plates included <span class="italic">Charles I</span>, <span class="italic">Jane Wenman</span> (after Van Dyck and published in 1778 and 1779, respectively) and the frontispiece to <span class="italic">Liber veritatis</span> (a self-portrait of Claude Lorrain).<br>
<br>When John Boydell undertook to publish engravings after the paintings in Houghton Hall, Norfolk, prior to their imminent export to the empress of Russia, Josiah Boydell, with Joseph and George Farington, made the necessary drawings in preparation for the engravers. While in Norfolk he married, on 6 December 1774, Jane North (<i>fl</i>. 1760&#150;1820), granddaughter of Sir Roger North. They were to have several children, one of whom, John North Boydell, became involved in the family publishing business. An accomplished artist as well as engraver, Josiah Boydell exhibited at the Royal Academy between 1772 and 1779, giving his addresses in London as 90 Cheapside (1772&#150;3), Great Castle Street, Leicester Fields (1776), and Southwood, Highgate (1779). He was adept at portraiture and historical painting, and his output included a portrait of Alderman John Boydell (exh. Royal Academy, 1772); one of his wife (when Miss North) in the character of Juno (exh. Royal Academy, 1776), and one of himself and his wife (exh. Royal Academy, 1776). Though not identified conclusively, the latter may be the portrait in Newport Adams School, Shropshire. He painted pictures for John Boydell's Shakspeare Gallery (receiving &pound;157 10<i>s</i>. each for scenes from <span class="italic">1 Henry VI</span> and <span class="italic">3 Henry VI</span>, and &pound;105 each for two scenes from <span class="italic">2 Henry IV</span>). His <span class="italic">Field of Battle Near Towton</span> was presented to the City of London by John Boydell (this decayed and was subsequently disposed of just prior to the Second World War), together with <span class="italic">The Battle of Agincourt</span> (of which the City has no record).<br>
<br>While living at West End, Hampstead, Josiah Boydell helped form the Hampstead infantry in 1798 and became their captain. After its standing down he became lieutenant-colonel commandant of the subsequently formed Loyal Hampstead Volunteers from 1803. After his uncle's death in 1804 he succeeded John Boydell as alderman of Cheap ward and was in control of the print publishing business at Cheapside of which he had formerly been a partner. Although his business acumen was not equal to that of his uncle, he was as enthusiastic towards promoting the arts in England. His <span class="italic">Suggestions towards forming a plan for the encouragement &hellip; of the arts &hellip; in this country in two letters addressed to Robert Udney, dated 22 &amp; 23 December 1801</span> (1805) reveals a sincere believer in the importance of the arts to the country's economy. His own artistic talent was generally underestimated. It was of some &#145;surprise, that an artist of such promise, is not to be found among the Royal Academicians&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 3 April 1790). A member of the Royal Society of Arts from 1790 and master of the Stationers' Company (1811&#150;12), he was forced to resign his aldermanic status in 1809 owing to ill health. Having suffered respiratory problems for some years, he died at his home at Halliford, Middlesex, on 27 March 1817 and was buried in Hampstead church. Examples of his work are in the Guildhall Library, London.<br>
