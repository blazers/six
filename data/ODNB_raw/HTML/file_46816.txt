<span class="headword">Clark,  Alfred Corning</span>  (1873&#150;1950), <span class="occ">record and electrical goods manufacturer</span>, was born in New York, USA, on 19 December 1873, the elder son of Walter Lowry Clark, a chocolate manufacturer, and his wife, Mary Rowe. His parents' families were both of English extraction and his background was distinctly patrician&#151;his great-uncle had been a United States senator. Alfred Clark was educated at the Franklin School, Washington, DC, public school number 60 in the Bronx, the College of the City of New York, and later at Cooper Union College in New York. He was absorbed in the study of electricity from an early age, according to his contemporary Fred Gaisberg, and, although a brilliant and popular scholar, decided at the age of sixteen to forgo the completion of his formal education and become engaged in the exploitation of sound recording, an invention then beginning to be marketed commercially.<br>
<br>In September 1889 Clark joined the North American Phonograph Company of New York, a business marketing both Thomas Edison's phonograph and its rival Bell Tainter graphophone as office dictating machines. By 1894 North American had collapsed because of problems with the technology, poor management, and a major trade depression. However, the experience taught Clark much about business and technology, and he made useful contacts. For a while after, he was employed by Edison at his film studios in West Orange, New Jersey. At this time Edison's film output consisted principally of vaudeville acts and boxing matches. Clark changed all this, writing the first film scenarios, such as <span class="italic">The Beheading of Mary Queen of Scots</span>, and films of a lynching and of an Indian scalping scene.<br>
<br>Although Clark became manager of Edison film production and sales, his future did not lie in motion pictures. Already interested in 1896 in the possibilities of the gramophone with its flat disc record, he took the opportunity to work with its inventor, Emile Berliner. He recognized immediately the potential of the gramophone, which by playing discs reproduced from a zinc master made possible the production of many thousands of copies. Clark himself made two valuable improvements to the gramophone. First he devised a governor, which reduced the tremor produced by hand cranking the turntable, and then, with Eldridge R. Johnson, later the inventor of other important gramophone innovations, he developed a much improved reproducing soundbox. Clark described Johnson as a mechanical genius, and the improved soundbox, together with Johnson's other later inventions, proved vital in making the gramophone commercially successful. Clark and Johnson became close associates, in a relationship that laid the basis for their later partition and domination of the worldwide gramophone business, with Clark as head of the Gramophone Company and Johnson of its American counterpart, the Victor Talking Machine Company.<br>
<br>Clark would have thrown his lot in with the gramophone immediately, but until Johnson's improvements were perfected it was not ready for commercial exploitation. In 1897 he joined Edison United States Phonograph Company of Newark, New Jersey, and in 1898 moved to that company's overseas sales office in New York city. During this period Clark made up for the education he had lost by enrolling for evening classes at New York's Cooper Union School of Art and Science. Clark also watched with interest the attempts of the American William Barry Owen to find backers for the gramophone business he had started in Britain. Prior to Owen's departure for London in 1897, he and Clark had worked together during his time with Berliner, and in 1898 helped him out with a small loan when he pursued his eventual partner Edmund Trevor Lloyd Williams to America in order to convince him of the gramophone's merits.<br>
<br>In 1899 Clark, together with a sound engineer, Cleveland Walcott, left New York for France as accredited agents for both the Berliner and Edison interests. Unfortunately, the Edison side of the business failed to take off, but, in partnership with Owen and Williams's newly formed Gramophone Company Ltd, Clark formed the Compagnie de Gramophone Fran&ccedil;aise, of which he became general manager. Within a very short time Clark had developed a highly successful business&#151;in 1904 he sold his holding to the Gramophone Company for &pound;23,000 in cash and shares&#151;creating important catalogues of recorded music by popular and classical artists. Among the great performers Walcott recorded in Clark's Paris studio were the composers Claude Debussy and Edvard Grieg.<br>
<br>Clark greatly enjoyed his time in France; within six months he had acquired mastery of the language through a disciplined programme of instruction, a sign, according to Fred Gaisberg, of his industry and orderliness of mind. He had been much taken with the stage and performers when the Berliner Company had recorded them in America. Now he became friendly with the composers Jules Massenet and Camille Saint-S&auml;ens and many of the great names from the Paris opera. He also indulged his passion for gourmet food. In 1907 Clark became the moving force behind the Mus&eacute;e de la Voix, an institution founded to preserve for posterity the voices of great singers in the archives of the National Opera House, Paris. For this work he was awarded the French L&eacute;gion d'honneur. Shortly after, following disagreements with the then managing director, he left the employ of the Gramophone Company.<br>
<br>In 1908, however, Clark came to Britain, where, with Sidney Wentworth Dixon (who stepped down in 1912 to become sales director), he became joint managing director of the Gramophone Company. At that time the company was in financial straits in consequence of poor organizational structures, intense competition, and corruption in Russia, then its largest market. Clark transformed the situation and presided over the company's expansion on a new greenfield site at Hayes, Middlesex. With advice from accountant Colin Cooper and City lawyer John Broad, he set about rebuilding the company along modern business lines. He streamlined the organization and asserted direct control of overseas branches, and, a decade ahead of most other British businesses, he created internal markets, which had the effect of stabilizing profits and identifying cost and profit centres, information he used as an aid to developing investment and other policies. Furthermore, he focused power within the organization away from the board of directors and the selling branches and onto himself.<br>
<br>By 1914 Clark's reforms were working and the Gramophone Company seemed poised to expand. That summer his latest project, a new light engineering factory on the Hayes site to manufacture clockwork gramophone motors and other metal parts, was due to begin production. However, the unexpected outbreak of the First World War intervened, causing production to be deferred for the duration. The war resulted in the loss of important markets in central Europe and, initially, a collapse of sales at home. Responding to this wholly unexpected crisis, Clark quickly converted the company's Hayes factories to war production. As confidence returned, British record sales and market share grew. However, the war crisis brought into sharp relief growing boardroom tensions between Clark and the Gramophone Company's founding chairman, Trevor Williams, and other Williams family members who between them comprised the board. In 1916, at the height of the war, these directors, whose incomes were almost entirely dependent on Gramophone Company dividends and fees, which had been badly hit by the war, attempted to dismiss Clark and take over the business themselves. Their plan failed, however, as the banks, which had loaned the company large sums to retool for war work, would not permit amateurs such as these to take over such a complex manufacturing business. In a deal brokered by Cooper and Broad, Clark was reinstated and the board reconstructed (with Cooper and Broad becoming directors). Thereafter, with the power of the Williams family broken, Clark became the Gramophone Company's unchallenged master.<br>
<br>Another consequence of the war was the seizure in 1917 of the Gramophone Company's German and Russian branches, which between them accounted for about one-third of the company's total assets. The German assets, which included rights to the HMV trademark in Germany and various other states, together with record matrices and plant, were sold to competitors by the German state. Although the matrices were returned after the war, the company failed to recover the rest of its assets, despite protracted legal struggles which resulted in a final unsatisfactory financial judgment in 1930. By this time, however, Clark had established Electrola as the company's new German manufacturing and sales organization. It was not until after the Second World War that the company regained rights to use its HMV trademark in Germany.<br>
<br>From its earliest days the Gramophone Company's business benefited greatly from the licensing and know-how agreements with the American Victor Talking Machine Company, a co-operation that became the cornerstone of Clark's business career. Despite the hostility of the US department of justice which successfully prosecuted Victor for anti-trust violations in 1917, the friendship between Clark and Victor's president, Eldridge R. Johnson, ensured the continuance of the close relationship between the two businesses. In 1920, desperately short of capital to rebuild its business, the Gramophone Company created a large block of new shares which it sold to Victor, making it the largest shareholder, and thus effective controller of the company. Both Clark (whom Johnson saw as his eventual successor at Victor) and Colin Cooper became directors of Victor, while Johnson joined the Gramophone Company's board.<br>
<br>By the late 1920s the Gramophone Company's hold on the burgeoning market of home entertainment was coming under threat from the development of radio. Clark responded in 1929, when, under pressure from David Sarnoff, president of RCA (which had bought Victor after Johnson's retirement), he acquired the Marconiphone Company, important manufacturers of broadcasting equipment and radios in Britain, joint owners of the MOV valve factory, and part of a valuable cross-industry radio patent pool. This move transformed the company into one of Britain's leading electrical manufacturers.<br>
<br>In 1930 Clark succeeded Trevor Williams as Gramophone Company chairman. The following year, in the midst of the great depression, he merged the business with <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/56211/', "Louis Sterling's")</script> Columbia Graphophone Company (in the 1920s his chief competitor), to form Electric and Musical Industries Ltd (EMI). Clark had not sought the merger, but had been forced into it by Sarnoff and the American banks which controlled Columbia's shares. Clark, who became EMI's founding chairman, and Sterling, who became managing director, enjoyed poor personal relations. However, for EMI to survive the great depression, they were forced to work together. With sales in free fall, rationalization of the business proved essential. Production was focused on the Hayes factories with wholesale closure of other factories and sales offices. By 1934 the company had turned in its first profit, and two years later, with the introduction of BBC television broadcasts using EMI's own 405 lines system, its investment in television (which had begun in the mid-1920s) began to bear fruit.<br>
<br>Just before the Second World War a serious board-room rift occurred between Clark and Sterling, at the core of which was Clark's determination that Sterling would not succeed him as chairman. As a consequence of this rift, Sterling left the business. During the war EMI manufactured radar navigation aids and other important defence-related electronics. Clark remained chairman until 1945, and was for a time managing director. On retiring in April 1946 he accepted the honorary position of president. However, six months later, in the wake of a blistering board-room row, he flung his papers across the table and walked out.<br>
<br>Clark married twice. His first wife, whom he married in London on 17 July 1900, was Florence Beecher (<i>b</i>. 1879/80), daughter of George Nellis Crouse, a wholesale grocer; they divorced in 1920. Clark married his second wife, Gertrude Ivy (<i>b</i>. 1890/91), daughter of Heydon Sanders, on 21 July 1921; she was a well-known author and former secretary to Lord Northcliffe, who was a close friend of Clark. There were no children from either marriage. Although he became a naturalized British subject in 1928, Clark never achieved the knighthood he coveted and which was bestowed on Sterling. As recreation, Clark collected jade, and was considered a major expert in this field. He was also interested in photography, played tennis, and was a member of the MCC. In business matters Clark was a single-minded man; he had no business interests outside the company he did so much to create. He died at his home, Black Firs, Fulmer, Buckinghamshire, of a cerebral haemorrhage and arteriosclerosis on 16 June 1950. He was survived by his second wife.<br>
<br>Clark was one of the central figures who pioneered the gramophone record business in Britain, Europe, and the British empire. The first chairman of EMI Ltd, he helped lay the foundations of the British radio, television, and defence-related electronics industries. In his unpublished memoirs Clark surprisingly described his life as &#145;a drab, plugging career, nothing spectacular, a business of laying one brick upon another&#146;. This was a humble assessment by a man who was probably the most important figure in the development of the recording industry outside the United States. A controversial figure, he was once described by Eldridge Johnson as the most selfish man he had ever known. Writing of Clark on his seventieth birthday, his colleague Fred Gaisberg described him, however, as &#145;the fine thread running through the very fabric of HMV history&#146;  (&#145;Emile Berliner Picks a Winner&#146;, <span class="italic">The Gramophone</span>, December 1943). Whatever the truth, Alfred Clark's single-minded dedication to the businesses he controlled undoubtedly saved them from the depredations of two world wars and the great depression and made EMI one of the most important record companies in the world.<br>
