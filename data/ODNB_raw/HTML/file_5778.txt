<span class="headword">Cockburn, Sir  William, of that ilk</span>, sixth baronet  (1769&#150;1835), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was the only son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5772/', "Colonel James Cockburn, afterwards fifth baronet (1723&#150;1809)")</script>, and his wife, Laetitia Little (1732/3&#150;1804), daughter of Luke Little of co. Carlow and heir of the Rossiter family in Ireland. According to the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span>, Cockburn was born &#145;in a camp&#146;. He became an ensign in the 37th regiment in 1778. He was promoted lieutenant in 1779, and after serving through the latter part of the American War of Independence became captain in the 92nd on 27 April 1783. His regiment was disbanded at the end of the war, and he went on half pay until 1790, when he received a company in the 73rd regiment, then in India. On 1 January 1791, in Madras, he married, as her third husband, Eliza Anne Davis (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Creutzer; first married name Clifton) (<i>d</i>. 1829) and they had a son and a daughter. He served through the last campaigns of the First Anglo-Mysore War in the western army, under Sir Robert Abercromby, and when the two armies met before Seringapatam he was appointed acting engineer, and made a valuable survey which was afterwards published.<br>
<br>Cockburn was promoted major in 1794 and lieutenant-colonel on 1 January 1798, and in 1802 he returned to Britain, and exchanged to the lieutenant-colonelcy of the 4th regiment. In 1804 he was appointed inspecting field officer of volunteers in Ireland, and was promoted colonel on 25 April 1808, and major-general on 4 June 1811. On his father's death in 1809 he succeeded as sixth baronet, but seems to have been confused as to which branch of the Cockburn family he was heir to, and often called himself &#145;of Ryslaw&#146; as well as or instead of &#145;of Cockburn&#146;. In 1813 he was appointed inspecting general officer for the Severn district, and on 19 July 1821 he was promoted lieutenant-general. His first wife died in 1829, and in July 1834 he married Martha Honora Georgina, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Jervis, widow of Osborne Markham and great-niece of John Jervis, earl of St Vincent. In his later years he was a prominent supporter of the local charities of Bath, and was particularly active in the Society for the Relief of Occasional Distress, founded by Lady Elizabeth King. Cockburn died on 19 March 1835 at his house in Lansdowne Crescent, Bath. He was survived by his second wife, who died in 1865, and by his children, Sir William Sarsfield Rossiter Cockburn of that ilk, seventh baronet (1796&#150;1858), and Katherine, wife of Edward Cludde, of Orleton, Shropshire.<br>
