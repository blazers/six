<span class="headword">Lloyd,  David</span> <span class="st"> [<em>pseud. </em>Oliver Foulis]</span>  (1635&#150;1692), <span class="occ">biographer</span>, son of Hugh Lloyd, was born at Pant Mawr, in the parish of Trawsfynydd, Merioneth, on 28 September 1635, and was educated in the free school of Ruthin in Denbighshire. In 1653 he became a servitor of Merton College, Oxford, and graduated BA on 30 January 1657 from Oriel College. The warden and fellows of Merton College presented him to the rectory of Ibstone, Buckinghamshire, in May 1658, and he proceeded MA on 4 July 1659.<br>
<br>Resigning his rectory in 1659, Lloyd went to London and was appointed reader in the Charterhouse under Timothy Thurscross. Around 1663 he suffered six months' imprisonment at the suit of the earl of Bridgewater, who resented Lloyd's publication of <span class="italic">The Countess of Bridgewater's Ghost</span> (1663), describing the late countess's virtues. Subsequently he became chaplain to Isaac Barrow, bishop of St Asaph, who gave him several preferments in that diocese and collated him to a canonry.<br>
<br>The majority of Lloyd's published writings belong to the 1660s and are distinguished by a fervent royalism: he was what Robert Watt called &#145;a loyal biographer and historian&#146;  (2.612). Two such works appeared in the year of the Restoration itself, <span class="italic">Modern policy completed, or, The publick actions and councels, both civil and military, of &hellip; General Monck, under the general revolutions since 1639 to 1660</span> (1660)&#151;otherwise known as <span class="italic">Modern Policy, the Second Part</span>&#151;and <span class="italic">Eikon basilike, or, The True Portraicture of his Sacred Majesty Charles the II</span> (1660), which incorporated biographies of the dukes of York and of Gloucester. In choosing the latter title, Lloyd was referring to the far better known book attributed to Charles I. In 1664, Lloyd published, under the pseudonym Oliver Foulis, <span class="italic">Cabala, or, The history of conventicles unvail'd: in an historical account of the principles and practices of the nonconformists</span> (1664), listing 120 plots alleged to have been perpetrated against the present government. Here Lloyd accused the dissenters of continued disloyalty to the monarchy and the Church of England, and of clinging on to ideas of popular resistance inherited from the civil wars and republic.<br>
<br>Perhaps Lloyd's most famous works are <span class="italic">The Statesmen and Favourites of England since the Reformation</span> (1665), reissued in 1670, and <span class="italic">Memoires of the lives, actions, sufferings, and deaths of those noble, reverend, and excellent personages, that suffered by death, sequestration, decimation, or otherwise, for the protestant religion, and the great principle thereof, allegiance to their sovereigne, in our late intestine wars, from the year 1637, to the year 1660</span> (1668), reprinted with a new title in 1677. The <span class="italic">Memoires</span> included &#145;the life and martyrdom of King Charles I&#146;, which conformed entirely to the contemporary royalist Anglican view of Charles as a saint and martyr for the establishment in church and state. In 1766 Charles Whitworth reissued <span class="italic">The Statesmen and Favourites of England</span> in two volumes, under the title <span class="italic">State Worthies</span>, in which he balanced the royalist bias of Lloyd's original by additions of his own and added a biographical sketch of Lloyd.<br>
<br>Anthony Wood says of the <span class="italic">Memoires</span>&#151;which included material already used in <span class="italic">The Statesmen and Favourites of England</span>&#151;that there &#145;are almost as many errors as lines&#146;, and Lloyd gained something of a reputation not only as &#145;a most impudent plagiary, but a false writer and mere scribbler&#146;. Bishop Humphreys relates that in later years Lloyd himself &#145;would express no great esteem of his youthful performances&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 4.349, 352n.). Yet for all the errors of detail, Lloyd's writings provide an insight into the beliefs and opinions of the Anglican and royalist clergy in the first decades of the Restoration.<br>
<br>On 14 August 1671 Lloyd was instituted to the vicarage of Abergele, Denbighshire, which he exchanged in 1672 for that of Northop, Flintshire, where he was also master of the free school. He was also rector of Llanddulas, Denbighshire, in 1672. When his health failed some time after 1673, he retired to his birth place, Pant Mawr, where he died on 16 February 1692. He was buried at Trawsfynydd.<br>
