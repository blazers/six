<span class="headword">Murray, Lady  Evelyn  Stewart-</span>  (1868&#150;1940), <span class="occ">Gaelic folklorist and needlewoman</span>, was born on 17 March 1868 at Blair Castle, Perthshire. She was the third daughter of John James Hugh Henry Stewart-Murray, seventh duke of Atholl (1840&#150;1917) and his wife, Louisa (1844&#150;1902), eldest daughter of Sir Thomas Moncreiffe, seventh baronet, of Moncreiffe, Perthshire. Like her three sisters and two surviving brothers, Lady Evelyn had a conventional upbringing, being educated by governesses at Blair Castle. She was presented at court in 1887. After teenage illnesses in 1881 and 1887, she took up the study of Gaelic. Initially encouraged by her father, her enthusiasm burgeoned, and between February and November 1891 she collected 240 Gaelic stories from a wide area of the family estate and west Perthshire, walking many miles, ignoring meals, and working late into the night. Her family considered her activities inappropriate and her enthusiasm disproportionate, and she came into frequent conflict with her parents, especially her mother who was dismayed and infuriated by Evelyn's refusal to participate in the normal social activities of her class. At the end of 1891, Lady Evelyn was sent to Switzerland on what was intended to be a short visit, but she then refused to return to Scotland. In 1895 she settled in Belgium, where she lived on a small allowance from her parents. She never married, but generally had a servant or companion with her. She maintained contact with her siblings through letters and occasional visits, but never saw her parents again, and in 1907 made arrangements so that she need not even correspond with her father. Her interest turned to needlework, and she became both a collector and a highly skilled practitioner, her own work culminating in a piece depicting the British arms, which has been regarded as being perfect of its kind.<br>
<br>During the First World War Lady Evelyn remained in Belgium, which was suffering terribly under German occupation; her family tried to relieve her privations by sending food and clothing, but her passbook photograph of this period (the only surviving adult likeness) shows the image of a frail, aged lady, although she was only forty-six. After the war, her greatest work completed and her parents dead, she lived on quietly in Belgium, absorbed in her garden, music, and books. To escape the outbreak of the Second World War and in deteriorating health, she returned to Britain, where on 30 July 1940 she died at the house of her brother James at Easter Moncreiffe, Perthshire. She was buried beside her sister Helen at Tirinie on the Atholl family's Perthshire estates.<br>
<br>Lady Evelyn Stewart-Murray's needlework collection was placed on display at Blair Castle, and her Gaelic stories went to the School of Scottish Studies at the University of Edinburgh. Although one scholar has assessed Lady Evelyn's life as one of &#145;tragedy and wasted potential&#146;  (Jalland, 279), the importance of her work as both needlewoman and collector of folk stories was beginning to be recognized some sixty years after her death.<br>
