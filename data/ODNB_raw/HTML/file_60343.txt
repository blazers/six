<span class="headword">Cox, Sir  (George) Trenchard</span>  (1905&#150;1995), <span class="occ">museum director</span>, was born on 31 July 1905 at 19 Craven Hill, London, the son of William Pallett Cox, barrister, and his wife, Marion, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Beverley. He was educated at Eton College and at King's College, Cambridge, where he was a prizeman; in 1926 he took a third in part one of the modern and medieval languages tripos, and in 1928 a first in part two of the modern languages certificate of competent knowledge. Away from his studies Cox developed an interest in the arts. He was encouraged in this by a family friend, Cecil Harcourt-Smith, the director of the Victoria and Albert Museum; and at Cambridge he was inspired by Sydney Cockerell, the director of the Fitzwilliam Museum, to pursue a career in museums. He embarked on this in the then usual way by working, from 1929 to 1932, as a volunteer at the National Gallery and in the department of prints and drawings at the British Museum. During that period he also spent a semester, in 1930, at Berlin University, studying art history under Adolph Goldschmidt. For the rest of his life he would recall Goldschmidt and Charles Holmes, who supervised him at the National Gallery, as his two most important mentors. A brief stay in Paris before returning home led to Cox's <span class="italic">Jehan Foucquet, Native of Tours</span> (1931), a study of the French Renaissance painter.<br>
<br>From the British Museum, Cox joined the staff of the Wallace Collection in 1932 as assistant to the keeper, Sir James Mann. Although Cox did not warm to Mann, he acquired a lasting interest in the decorative arts of eighteenth-century France. He contributed to the catalogue of the exhibition of French art at Burlington House in 1932, and later produced two short works about the Wallace Collection. His marriage, on 14 November 1935, to Mary D&eacute;sir&eacute;e (Maisie), the only daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30408/', "Sir Hugh Kerr Anderson")</script>, master of Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, proved blissfully happy. They had no children, but remained a devoted couple until her death in 1973. In the summer of 1939 Cox had the task of organizing the evacuation of the Wallace Collection's holdings from Hertford House, after which he was seconded for wartime duties at the Home Office, as private secretary to Sir Alexander Maxwell, the permanent under-secretary.<br>
<br>In 1944, having proved himself a most efficient administrator, Cox was appointed director of the Birmingham City Museum and Art Gallery. The challenge at Birmingham was daunting: the museum's premises, mostly converted for use as council offices during the war, had to be recovered for museum use, and extensive repairs and refurbishment had to be accomplished on a slender budget. But with the help of Dr Mary Woodall, keeper of the department of art, Cox established excellent relations with the Birmingham city corporation and overcame all difficulties to re-establish and increase the museum's high standing. He was exceptionally supportive of the museum's staff, never failing to write a note of congratulation to those responsible for an exhibition or new display. He encouraged everyone under his supervision to fulfil their potential, and established one of the most successful museum friends organizations of the period. In 1947 he paid tribute to Birmingham's most famous painter with the publication of his book <span class="italic">David Cox</span>.<br>
<br>In 1955 the minister of education, David Eccles, offered Cox the post of director and secretary of the Victoria and Albert Museum. The retiring director, Sir Leigh Ashton, had lost his grip, and a new man was urgently needed to restore morale at the museum. Cox accepted the offer and, despite Eccles's explanation that he had been selected to keep the seat warm for John Pope-Hennessy, he stayed until 1966. The first task he undertook set the tone of fairness and kindness that was to characterize his directorship: with the help of his assistant Terence Hodgkinson, he learnt the names of all the museum's staff within three weeks. Thereafter he greeted everybody by name&#151;and slipped up only once, when confusing the identities of two typists who had temporarily exchanged places. His directorship was also marked by the creation of the museum's education and conservation departments; the reorganization of the National Art Library; such important acquisitions as the jade wine cup of Shah Jahan; and a high standard of exhibitions, notably that devoted to <span class="italic">Opus Anglicanum</span> in 1963. On Cox's initiative a female research assistant was promoted to assistant keeper grade, and (another first) a black warder was promoted supervising warder.<br>
<br>Beyond the Victoria and Albert Museum, Cox took an active interest in the Museums Association, of which he became president in 1963, and in the International Council of Museums. He was also president of the National Association of Decorative and Fine Art Societies; and a fellow of the Royal Society of Arts and of the Society of Antiquaries. He was a staunch supporter of the social welfare activities of St Martin-in-the-Fields, where in retirement he served as people's warden from 1968 to 1979. Tentative and fastidious in manner, he was free of prejudice and self-effacing to a fault. He had very poor eyesight and when talking animatedly would wave his arms about and sway. He always felt at home on the continent, especially in France. Cox was appointed CBE in 1954, knighted in 1961, and appointed a chevalier of the L&eacute;gion d'honneur in 1967. He died of bronchopneumonia and cancer at his home, 33 Queen's Gate Gardens, London, on 21 December 1995.<br>
