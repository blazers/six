<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Smith,  Sydney</span>  (1771&#150;1845), <span class="occ">author and wit</span>, was born on 3 June 1771 at Woodford, Essex, the second of the five children of Robert Smith (1739/40&#150;1827), merchant, and his wife, Maria (<i>c</i>.1750&#150;1801), the daughter of Isaac Olier, a Huguenot. He had three brothers and a sister; Smith's elder brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25897/', "Robert Percy Smith")</script>, known as Bobus, was a major influence.<h2>
<a name="Earlylifeandeducation"></a>Early life and education</h2>Smith's early life was unhappy. His father was vain, petty, selfish, and tyrannical: after dinner every day he forced his children to sit, often for hours, in motionless silence. For Smith, an energetic boy, the experience was purgatorial. Worse still was watching his mother's attacks of epilepsy. A woman of artistic sensibility and ravishing beauty, Maria Olier was beloved by all her sons. As she grew older the frequency and intensity of her fits steadily increased, and her final hours were gruesome.<br>
<br>Smith's lifelong desire for comfort and financial ease was, at least in part, a reaction against his father's rootlessness and financial imprudence. When Robert Smith was about twenty, he left the family business in Eastcheap in his brother's hands and went off to make his fortune in America. He married in 1768, returning to America shortly afterwards. During the War of Independence his American investments became virtually valueless, but failure did not blunt his entrepreneurial ardour. After his marriage he engaged in commercial ventures as far afield as Europe, India, and the West Indies. Most of his speculations met the same fate as his American investments. The attempts to salvage something from the wreckage necessitated frequent trips abroad, leaving his five children in the care of his dedicated (but increasingly helpless) wife. As though this were not enough, Robert Smith kept moving house. The number of his residences in Sydney's formative years is not known, but was probably more than five.<br>
<br>Smith's early years at Winchester College, where he went as a scholar at the age of eleven, were also painful. The headmaster, Joseph Warton, was brilliant, but also, at sixty, ageing. Winchester, in consequence, was in a state of serious decline. Four years before Smith entered the school there had been 116 fee-paying pupils, but when he left, in 1788, there were only thirty-eight, a third as many. Discipline was poor and there was much bullying. Smith also had other complaints: the curriculum, with its virtually exclusive concentration upon the study of Latin and Greek, was tedious, the way of life monastic, and the food execrable. He nevertheless did well, carrying off a number of prizes and becoming, in his last year, senior boy, known at Winchester as prefect of hall.<br>
<br>On 6 February 1789 Smith entered Winchester's sister foundation of New College, Oxford, as a probationary fellow, becoming a full fellow after he had fulfilled the residence qualification of two years. Life at New College was easy, but it was also dull. For the four-year period 1789&#150;92 there are only fifteen names in the admissions book. Smith was still faced with the drudgery of writing vast amounts of Latin and Greek verse, and he was not encouraged to think. &#145;A genuine Oxford tutor&#146;, he later wrote, &#145;would shudder to hear his young men disputing upon moral and political truth, forming and pulling down theories, and indulging in all the boldness of youthful discussion. He would augur nothing from it, but impiety to God, and treason to kings&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 1.196).<h2>
<a name="CuracymarriageandformationoftheEdinburghReview"></a>Curacy, marriage, and formation of the Edinburgh Review</h2>For a two-year period starting in the summer of 1794 Smith was curate at Netheravon on Salisbury Plain, an isolated hamlet of fewer than fifty families. He was appalled by the desperate poverty of the majority of his parishioners, but could do little to help them because he lacked the financial means. He did, however, start a Sunday school, then considered a bold step, and also set in motion a school of industry for twenty girls. The girls met in the forge of Bendall the blacksmith and were taught to darn, knit, and sew.<br>
<br>Smith was priested soon after his return to New College in the summer of 1796. His whereabouts over the next two years are uncertain but he seems to have been mainly at Oxford, where he learnt thoroughly both French and German. Michael Hicks-Beach, the son of Smith's squire at Netheravon, was intending to set out on a continental tour before going to Oxford, and Smith was to accompany him as private tutor. The invasion of Switzerland by France in February 1798 forced a rethink: Weimar was discarded as a destination in favour of Edinburgh.<br>
<br>Smith set off north with his pupil on 1 June 1798. He did not enjoy his tutorial duties&#151;Beach was a lazy young man of mediocre intellectual ability, whose main interest was socializing with his friends&#151;but he loved Edinburgh and quickly built up a friendship network. A major formative influence was Dugald Stewart, professor of moral philosophy. Stewart was not an original thinker, but he fired Smith's imagination with his eloquent exposition of the enjoyment to be gained from the study of literature and science, and also with his passionate defence of the immortality of the soul. Still more important was the companionship of three ardent young whigs: Henry Brougham, Francis Horner, and Francis Jeffrey.<br>
<br>One evening shortly before the Christmas of 1801, Jeffrey asked Smith and Horner to tea at his house in Buccleuch Place. During the meal Smith suggested, half in jest, that they should start a literary review. The idea was taken up enthusiastically, gaining financial support from Archibald Constable, a leading Edinburgh bookseller. The first issue of the <span class="italic">Edinburgh Review</span> came out on 10 October 1802. Editorial duties were initially shared among Jeffrey, Horner, and Smith; but after three issues Constable&#151;on Smith's advice&#151;appointed Jeffrey editor on a permanent, salaried basis. It was a wise choice: Jeffrey had persistence and an eye for detail, qualities which Smith lacked.<br>
<br>Smith did much to establish the literary reputation of the <span class="italic">Edinburgh Review</span>. Of the 101 articles in the first four issues, he was responsible for nineteen; only Brougham, credited with twenty-one, wrote a greater number. Smith ranged wide, writing on matters as diverse as philosophy, travel, drama, and theology. He was the best communicator among the reviewers, and also the one with the most scabrous wit. As he told Jeffrey:<blockquote>Too much would not do of my style, but the proportion in which it exists enlivens the <span class="roman">Review</span>. I am a very ignorant, frivolous, half-inch person; but, such as I am, I am sure I have done [the] <span class="roman">Review</span> good, and contributed to bring it into notice. (Virgin, 3)</blockquote>By the time the <span class="italic">Edinburgh Review</span> was floated, Sydney was married. Catharine Amelia Pybus (1768&#150;1852) had long been a friend of Sydney's sister, Maria. Her father, John, had been a member of the council of Madras and was the first English ambassador to Ceylon, while her brother, Charles, MP for Dover, was a lord of the Treasury. The marriage, which took place on 2 July 1800, was a love match. Smith revelled in domestic life, and Catharine adored her husband, giving him strong emotional support during his occasional bouts of depression.<br>
<br>There were five children from the marriage, three sons and two daughters, one of whom died in infancy. Sydney pinned high hopes upon his eldest son, Douglas, a diligent scholar but physically weak. Douglas's death in 1829 at the age of twenty-four was the most serious sorrow that Sydney ever had to face: &#145;I never suspected&#146;, he wrote, &#145;how children weave themselves about the heart&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters</span>, 2.496). Sydney's elder daughter, Saba [<a name="cosubject_13541"></a><span class="headword">Saba Holland</span>  (1802&#150;1866)], was born in February 1802, and became the second wife of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13525/', "Henry Holland (1788&#150;1873)")</script>, physician-in-ordinary to Queen Victoria, in 1834. Saba Holland's memoir of her father, who had superintended her education, was published in two volumes in 1855. It records many of Smith's best jokes; his daughter apparently &#145;possessed no slight share&#146; of his humour  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, new ser., 2, 1866, 844), and also contains valuable reminiscences. Saba died at 25 Brook Street, London, on 2 November 1866, and was buried in Kensal Green cemetery.<h2>
<a name="SuccessinLondon18031809"></a>Success in London, 1803&#150;1809</h2>Smith left Edinburgh for London on 8 August 1803, settling at 8 Doughty Street, not far from Gray's Inn Road. He lived in the metropolis for the next six years, the final three of them at 18 Orchard Street, just north of Oxford Street.<br>
<br>During the 1790s Smith's elder brother, Bobus, had introduced him to Holland House, the citadel of whig power and influence [<i>see also </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/93786', "Holland House set")</script>]; now that he was living in London, Smith, along with Samuel Rogers and Henry Luttrell, quickly became known as one of the resident Holland House wits. One of Smith's main specialities was aphoristic analogy. &#145;Correspondences are like small-clothes before the invention of suspenders; it is impossible to keep them up&#146; and &#145;Marriage resembles a pair of shears, so joined that they cannot be separated; often moving in opposite directions, but punishing anyone who comes between them&#146; are memorable examples  (Holland, 1, chap. 11). On a proposal to surround St Paul's with a wooden pavement, Smith remarked: &#145;Let the Dean and Canons lay their heads together and the thing will be done&#146;  (Pearson, chap. 10).<br>
<br>Some of Smith's <i>mots</i> occur in his published books and articles (few other writers have succeeded in making ecclesiastical disputes amusing to a readership almost 200 years later), but many were delivered verbally and recorded by his daughter in her <span class="italic">Memoir</span>. Several of these <i>mots</i> have entered the common currency of British humour, for example, &#145;I never read a book before reviewing it; it prejudices a man so&#146;  (Pearson, chap. 3) and &#145;I am just going to pray for you at St Paul's, but with no very lively hope of success&#146;  (ibid., chap. 13). His humour was reinforced by his incongruous appearance&#151;dark, piercing eyes, a high forehead, and a Roman nose, commanding features that were offset by untidy hair brushed upwards after the contemporary French fashion, a small mouth once unkindly compared to an oyster, careless dress, and clumsy movements.<br>
<br>At Holland House, Smith met royalty, writers, and politicians of all persuasions. He also soon became a close friend of his host, Henry, third Baron Holland, and his formidable wife, Elizabeth. Lord and Lady Holland were, from now on, Sydney's chief patrons. In October 1806 they persuaded Thomas Erskine, lord chancellor in the &#145;ministry of all the talents&#146;, to make Smith rector of the rich living of Foston-le-Clay, 12 miles north-east of York.<br>
<br>During these London years Smith also became a popular preacher. He had the use of three pulpits: Berkeley Chapel in John Street, Mayfair, the Fitzroy Chapel a little further north in the parish of St Pancras, and the Foundling Hospital. Smith's doctrinal views were conventional&#151;he was an uncritical follower of the theology of William Paley&#151;and his sermons were firmly moral in their tone. What made him famous was his fiery delivery. Smith's <span class="italic">Sermons</span>, in two volumes, were published in 1809.<br>
<br>Starting on 10 November 1804 Smith gave two sets of lectures at the Royal Institution in Albemarle Street. An eyewitness gives a graphic account of the press of people. &#145;All Albemarle Street and a part of Grafton Street were rendered impassable by the concourse of carriages &hellip; Many persons, to obtain seats, came an hour before time&#146;  (Holland, 128, n.). Smith's subject was moral philosophy, which he defined in typically cavalier fashion as the study of &#145;everything which belongs to the human mind&#146;. This allowed him to speak on such favourite topics as the nature of wit and the influence of the passions. He used the lectures to popularize Scottish psychology, putting his case with eloquence, humour, and common sense. A third series of lectures, given in the early months of 1806, attracted significantly smaller audiences. His <span class="italic">Elementary Sketches of Moral Philosophy</span> was published posthumously in 1850.<br>
<br>Following the fall of the &#145;talents&#146; in March 1807, Smith defended the late ministry in ten short, and brilliantly funny, pamphlets, published as <span class="italic">Peter Plymley's Letters</span>. Although anonymous, authorship was an open secret. The &#145;talents&#146; had fallen because it had proposed that Irish Catholics should be allowed to serve as officers in both the English army and the English navy. Smith's defence of this ill-fated policy was deft. He appealed to protestant prejudice by ridiculing Catholic ritual: &#145;How would my admirable brother, the Rev. Abraham Plymley, like to be marched to a Catholic chapel, to be sprinkled with the sanctified contents of a pump, to hear a number of false quantities in the Latin tongue, and to see a number of persons occupied in making right angles upon the breast and forehead?&#146; while, at the same time, he also advanced the thoroughly modern, as well as secular, notion that the state should be indifferent towards the religious affiliation of its citizens. In 1808 <span class="italic">Peter Plymley's Letters</span> were printed in a collection which quickly ran through sixteen editions.<h2>
<a name="AtFostonleClay18091829"></a>At Foston-le-Clay, 1809&#150;1829</h2>William Markham, archbishop of York, aged and complaisant, allowed Smith to use his preachership at the Foundling Hospital as an excuse for non-residence in his Yorkshire living of Foston. Markham, however, died in November 1807 at the age of eighty-nine, and was succeeded in the new year by Edward Vernon-Harcourt, who was much more zealous. After a protracted correspondence, Smith set out for Foston in June 1809. For the first five years he hired a house at Heslington, 12 miles from Foston, riding over to his parish on Sundays to take services. But from March 1814 he lived at Foston, in a new parsonage which he had designed himself and upon which he spent about &pound;4000 from his own resources.<br>
<br>Smith was an innovative and unconventional rector, putting into practice what would later be called the social gospel. He planted a number of small gardens with fruit trees, allowing the villagers to gather the produce, and also set aside part of his glebe as allotments at nominal rents. He excelled as a makeshift doctor, keeping copious notes on all his patients and ordering drugs for them from London. In January 1814 he was made a magistrate, subsequently dispensing his own brand of humane justice in preference to the rigours of statute law. He was especially lenient towards poachers.<br>
<br>Influential articles by Smith on social issues appeared in the <span class="italic">Edinburgh Review</span>. &#145;Mad Quakers&#146;, in April 1814, was a defence of the therapeutic practice of The Retreat, an asylum for mentally ill Quakers near York: management did away with chains, using instead the earliest form of occupational therapy. Smith's article was partly responsible for the formation of a House of Commons select committee on madhouses in May 1815. The committee came down heavily in support of the regime at The Retreat, and its findings led to revolutionary changes in the treatment of mental illness.<br>
<br>This was the only issue on which Smith managed to play a part in initiating immediate change, yet his ideas on other topics can nevertheless be commended for anticipating the future direction of official thinking. He turned the fire of his righteous anger on the practice of sending young boys up chimneys in order to sweep them, ridiculed the game laws, and advocated important changes in legal procedure, including payment of defendants' costs out of the public purse. He was also an important early feminist. In an article in the <span class="italic">Edinburgh Review</span> in 1810 he argued that women should participate fully in the economy&#151;&#145;Half the talent in the universe runs to waste, and is totally unprofitable&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 1.203); he challenged the assumption of male intellectual superiority and advocated a radical extension of female educational provision. &#145;A century ago&#146;, he concluded mischievously, &#145;who would have believed that country gentlemen could be brought to read and spell with the ease and accuracy which we now so frequently remark?&#146;  (ibid., 1.216). Although he was perceptive and forward-thinking, Smith's social ideas nevertheless lack coherence. He was a pioneer of humane treatment of the mentally ill, but advocated inhumane treatment of those who were in prison: &#145;We would banish all the looms of Preston jail, and substitute nothing but the tread-wheel, or the capstan, or some species of labour where the labourer could not see the results of his toil&#146;  (ibid., 1.440).<br>
<br>During these Foston years Smith's aristocratic connections continued to grow. He paid annual visits to Earl Grey's home at Howick in Northumberland, where he was accepted as part of the family, thus adding a new string to his patronage bow. His relations with Frederick Howard, fifth earl of Carlisle&#151;the master of Castle Howard, 5 miles to the north of Foston&#151;were more ambiguous and also more fraught. In 1823 Carlisle used his influence to persuade the duke of Devonshire to present Sydney to the living of Londesborough, worth the large sum of &pound;800 a year. Before entering the benefice Smith signed a resignation bond, under which he agreed to vacate nine years later in favour of the duke's nephew, W. G. Howard, who would then be of canonical age. This was a thoroughly dubious transaction; in 1828 resignation bonds were made illegal except in cases where both the presentee and the future incumbent were related to the patron of the living either by blood or by marriage. A year after he gained Londesborough there was a rupture with Carlisle, who was incensed by the astringency of Smith's social articles in the <span class="italic">Edinburgh Review</span>. Smith, much chastened, promised the earl that he would, in future, &#145;attack less frequently, &amp; joke less severely&#146;.<h2>
<a name="RectorofCombeFloreyandcanonofStPauls18291840"></a>Rector of Combe Florey and canon of St Paul's, 1829&#150;1840</h2>Early in 1828 Smith, through the patronage of Lord Lyndhurst and John Ward, first earl of Dudley, was made a prebendary of Bristol Cathedral. Desiring further promotion, Smith immediately gave up writing for the <span class="italic">Edinburgh Review</span>. The next three years were a period of turbulence. In March 1829 Smith exchanged Foston for Combe Florey, 7 miles from Taunton, and the next month he gave up Londesborough. After Grey succeeded Wellington as prime minister in November 1830, Smith entered the political fray, delivering three speeches in favour of the <span class="roman">Reform Bill</span>, most famously at a meeting at Taunton on 11 October 1831, where he compared anti-reformers with Dame Partington, an old woman who, some years previously, had tried to hold back a storm at Sidmouth in Devon with a mop and bucket.<br>
<br>Smith hoped for a bishopric, but it never came. Grey, instead, translated him from his prebend at Bristol to a canonry at St Paul's, a move that took place in September 1831. Smith's pride was hurt, but he did have ample financial compensation. His income, in 1832, was almost &pound;2900. Only twenty-five beneficed clergy of a total of 7500 were paid more.<br>
<br>After Grey's resignation in July 1834, the continuing failure of the whigs to offer him a bishopric made Smith exceedingly angry. There was a fierce row with Lord Holland in November 1834: the third baron, with aristocratic nonchalance, let slip that he would have preferred Samuel Butler, the famous reforming headmaster of Shrewsbury, as the new bishop of Bristol to the successful candidate, Joseph Allen. Desertion by Lord Holland was a bitter pill to swallow. More bitter still was Melbourne's support for the ecclesiastical commission, set up by Peel during his brief administration that lasted from November 1834 until April 1835. Smith was enraged by the commission's plans to trim the patronage of cathedral dignitaries, interpreting the move as a personal attack. In three letters to Archdeacon Singleton, published in January 1837, the spring of 1838, and February 1839, Smith put himself forward as the leading opponent of church reform. He made his position clear in the first letter: any measures for change must not exceed &#145;one thing more than was absolutely necessary&#146;.<br>
<br>The letters won warm approval from the influential section of the whig party, which was strongly opposed to the centralizing tendency of Melbourne's administration, but Smith's defence of ecclesiastical privilege is a shabby episode. A letter to him from Blomfield, bishop of London, written on 24 January 1837&#151;a week after publication of the first letter&#151;shows that Smith had made informal contact with the ecclesiastical commission, and had given an assurance that he would cease his attacks provided his own rights of patronage, as a canon of St Paul's, were not interfered with.<br>
<br>Smith, although still claiming to be a whig, became more politically conservative in the 1830s. His pamphlet <span class="italic">Ballot</span>, published in 1839, was a witty defence of open voting. His arguments were eloquent and original. A man, he contended, should be prepared to stand up for his beliefs; it was wrong to &#145;seek for liberty by clothing ourselves in the mask of falsehood, and trampling on the cross of truth&#146;. <span class="italic">Ballot</span> was well received. &#145;Since the days of Pascal&#146;, said Smith's brother Bobus &#145;no such piece of Irony, involving so much wisdom, had ever been penned&#146;  (Virgin, 269).<br>
<br>After his appointment as canon of St Paul's, Smith spent Christmas and part of the summer at Combe Florey, but was otherwise in London. He initially rented houses, but in the autumn of 1835 purchased a fourteen-year lease on 33 Charles Street, just south of Berkeley Square, moving in the next February. In 1839 he was again on the move: his new house was 56 Green Street, near Park Lane. Smith's life in London was very sociable. In the early 1840s, when he was approaching seventy, he was dining out eight or nine times a week. He was elected to The Club, the highly prestigious literary club founded in the previous century by Samuel Johnson and David Garrick, and also met most of the leading literary figures, including Charles Dickens. It is from this period that most of Smith's conversational <i>bons mots</i> have come down to posterity. He found fame irksome. The poet Tom Moore was amused by Smith's response to the new fashion of lionizing famous authors. &#145;Here&#146;, said Smith, &#145;is a new man of genius arrived; put on the stew pan; fry away; we'll soon get it all out of him&#146;  (<span class="italic">Memoirs, Journal, and Correspondence of Thomas Moore</span>, ed. J. Russell, 8 vols., 1853&#150;6, 7.52).<h2>
<a name="Lastyearsanddeath18401845"></a>Last years and death, 1840&#150;1845</h2>From the autumn of 1840 Smith's letters are full of references to aches and pains, and the dreaded subject of his own death begins to come up for frequent discussion. The former fluency of his pen slows to a trickle, and he shows his old controversial flair only in two minor disputes, both of them conducted in the columns of the <span class="italic">Morning Chronicle</span>. Three letters, written in May and June 1842, persuaded the directors of the Great Western Railway that they had been wrong to try to protect the safety of passengers by insisting that the carriage doors on both sides of trains should be locked while they were in motion. Perhaps it was just as well that the directors gave in, because Smith was planning a fourth letter in which he intended to depict them looking with satisfaction at a trainload of incinerated passengers: &#145;a stewed Duke &hellip; two Bishops done in their own Gravy &hellip; two Scotchmen dead but raw, sulphuric acid perceptible&#146;  (<span class="italic">Miscellanies of the Philobiblon Society</span>, 15, 1872&#150;84, 7.17&#150;18). Smith's two letters of November 1843 attacking the state of Pennsylvania for suspending interest payments on its public debt&#151;Smith had lost &pound;400 on a purchase of Pennsylvanian bonds&#151;were less successful, serving merely to antagonize American opinion.<br>
<br>Smith, always overweight, had a severe heart attack in October 1844 while at Combe Florey. His son-in-law, Sir Henry Holland, hurried down to see him and arranged for him to be moved to his London home at 56 Green Street, where he could be under Holland's constant care. Smith died at Green Street on 22 February 1845. He was buried next to his beloved elder son, Douglas, in Kensal Green cemetery. In one of his best-known <i>mots</i>, he had said: &#145;[Lutterell's] idea of heaven is eating <i>p&acirc;t&eacute; de foie</i> to the sound of trumpets&#146;  (<span class="italic">Sayings</span>, 198&#150;9).<h2>
<a name="Personality"></a>Personality</h2>Like many famous wits, Smith had a depressive streak, of which he was fully aware and which he struggled against. The battle with himself helped to hone his humanity: he was kind, compassionate, full of goodwill, quick to anger, and quick to forgive. Known throughout society as &#145;Dear Sydney&#146;, he was one of the most approachable men of his generation, treating his servants in much the same way as he treated prime ministers. Outgoing and immensely charming, especially to women, Smith was very well liked, had few enemies, and possessed a great gift for friendship. He was at his best with children, speaking to them on their own level and being endlessly amusing.<br>
<br>There were also some contrasts and paradoxes. Although proud, Smith was without the slightest trace of vanity. His language was coarse&#151;he said of a friend called Miss Alcock that &#145;her Latin name would be <i>Domina omnis penis</i>&#146;&#151;and yet he was also capable of revealing, on occasion, an underlying moral earnestness. A man of strong feeling, he was reticent about his deepest emotions. He had a high degree of self-knowledge but there were also some blindnesses&#151;he failed to acknowledge, for instance, that he was ravenously ambitious. It is also true that he failed to outgrow his <i>nouveau riche</i> origins; always socially insecure, he was, when occasion offered, money-grubbing. His unique achievement nevertheless stands: an important contributor to the growth of libertarian thought in England, he was also, as G. K. Chesterton later pointed out, the inventor of nonsense, a very English style of humour.<br>
