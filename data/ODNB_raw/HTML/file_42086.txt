<span class="headword">Chichester <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Clifford]</span>,  Mary Barbara</span>, Lady Chichester  (1801&#150;1876), <span class="occ">diarist</span>, was born on 29 October 1801 at Tixall Hall, Staffordshire, the first of three children of Sir Thomas Hugh Clifford (from 1821 Clifford Constable) (1762&#150;1823), topographer and botanist, of Tixall, Staffordshire, and Wycliffe and Burton Constable, Yorkshire, and his wife, Mary MacDonald (<i>d</i>. 1825), daughter of John Chichester of Arlington, Devon. She had one brother and one sister and grew up in an atmosphere of devout Roman Catholicism.<br>
<br>Mary spent the greater part of her life travelling and assiduously recorded her experiences in diary form. She began her first surviving journal in 1822 <i>en route</i> for Ghent, and included architectural descriptions of the Catholic churches she attended. She stayed at the Normandy estate of the marquis de Montmorency at Beaumesnil in autumn 1823, and on her return to Paris was introduced to Mlle Fouchet, who had secretly visited Marie Antoinette in prison before her execution.<br>
<br>On 13 April 1826 Mary married her cousin, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5276/', "Charles Chichester (1795&#150;1847)")</script>, army officer, the second son of Charles Joseph Chichester (1770&#150;1837) of Calverleigh, Devon, and his wife, Mary Honoria (<i>d</i>. 1831), daughter of Robert Ffrench of Rahasane, co. Galway. She bore eleven children, of whom three sons and two daughters survived to adulthood. During the early years of her marriage she dwelt mainly at Calverleigh Court; however after her husband left to fight in Spain in 1835 as a brigadier-general in the British Legion, she resided in Pau, north of the Pyrenees. The uprising in Upper and Lower Canada in late 1837 took her to the wilds of British North America, when her husband volunteered for the colonial army.<br>
<br>Appointed lieutenant-colonel of the 81st foot in late 1839 and knighted the following April, Sir Charles sailed for the West Indies with his wife in autumn 1840. Based near Port of Spain in Trinidad, Lady Mary was able to visit Caracas in Venezuela over Christmas 1841. There, as the guest of a local landowner, she was served &#145;bologna sausage, cheese, olives and they wanted to add butter, all on the same plate, it seemed a strange mess&#146;  (diary of Lady Chichester, 21 Dec 1841, DDCH/87). She then endured several months in Antigua, where the regiment was stationed in early 1842.<br>
<br>Of the Caribbean islands, Lady Mary became most attached to Trinidad, of which Sir Charles was appointed acting governor in July 1842. Her abiding memories were of Trinidad's natural beauty and the kindness of its inhabitants, coupled with the trauma of witnessing, in February 1843, the impact of an earthquake centred on Guadeloupe which enveloped Montserrat in a cloud of dust, destroyed the dockyard in Antigua harbour, and left thousands of people dead  (diary of Lady Chichester, 15 Feb 1843, DDCH/87).<br>
<br>When Sir Charles's term as governor ended, the 81st was posted to Canada and the Chichesters arrived in Quebec shortly before the new governor-general, Sir Charles Metcalfe, in August 1843. From her vantage point in St John's, Montreal, Lady Mary witnessed the violent elections to the legislature of the united Canadian province in spring 1844. She travelled in the area around the North American lakes, including Niagara Falls, until her husband's sudden death in Toronto on 4 April 1847 caused her to return to England.<br>
<br>Unable to settle in the East Riding, which Lady Mary considered &#145;a frightful county where no family recollection belongs to us&#146;  (diary of Lady Chichester, 20 July 1844, DDCH/88), she moved to Paris in autumn 1847 and so witnessed the early days of the 1848 revolution. Opposed to the republic and fearful of mob violence, she informed her eldest son, &#145;If they bombard Paris I shall go into my cellar&#146;  (Lady Mary to C. R. Chichester, 16 Feb 1848, DDCH/62). However the behaviour of the populace during the &#145;February Days&#146; gained her respect, as did the provisional government's attempts to maintain order. She escaped from Paris on 3 March.<br>
<br>Lady Mary returned to France many times during the 1850s and undertook an extensive European tour in 1856&#150;7 through France, Italy, Switzerland, Germany, and Belgium. At the age of seventy-one, she made her last journey to the continent, but continued to travel around Britain and Ireland, visiting many well-known landed families, until, on 14 December 1876, she died at her London home, 5 Ovington Gardens, South Kensington, from the debilitating after-effects of a large abscess on her thigh.<br>
<br>A woman with a great love of travelling and interest in different cultures, but with a deep commitment to her own faith, Lady Chichester once expressed the belief that &#145;nothing can be so melancholy as a splendid funeral without religious signs because it is only religion which can make it less so, by giving hope for the future&#146;  (Lady Chichester to M. Balfe, 26 Nov 1852, DDCH/63). Her diaries and correspondence combine a wealth of detail with an unusual perspective on nineteenth-century history and bear witness to the hope for the future which guided her life.<br>
