<span class="headword">Vernon,  James</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1646, <em>d.</em> 1727), <span class="occ">government official and politician</span>, was baptized on 1 April 1646 at St Martin-in the-Fields, Westminster, the second son of Francis Vernon (<i>d</i>. 1647), government official, of Covent Garden, Westminster, and his wife, Anne, daughter of George Smithies, goldsmith, of London, and widow of William Welby of Gedney, Lincolnshire. He was educated at Charterhouse School and, from 1662, Christ Church, Oxford, where he graduated BA in 1666 and MA in 1669. He soon came to the attention of Sir Joseph Williamson, under-secretary, and later secretary, of state, who employed Vernon as a collector of news and in March 1672 sent him on a secret mission into Flanders to interview the spy John Scott and to gather military, political, and naval intelligence. The same year, in June, Vernon went with Viscount Halifax as a secretary on the latter's mission to the French court. In 1672 Williamson also recommended Vernon as a private secretary to the earl of Sunderland, then at his ambassador's post in Paris. Sunderland was to thank Williamson &#145;in giving Mr Vernon leave to come to me, desiring very much to have one bred up under you and [in] whome you have a good opinion&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 78/135, fol. 57). In turn Vernon noted that &#145;my L[or]d &hellip; received me very kindly which I owe entirely to the good opinion you have pleased to create in him of me by your letters&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 78/135, fol. 76).<br>
<br>In 1673 Vernon became private secretary to Charles II's eldest illegitimate son, James Scott, duke of Monmouth, and was given a pension of &pound;300 a year. In 1675, by a licence of 6 April, he married Mary (<i>d</i>. 1715), daughter of Sir John Buck, first baronet, of Hamby Grange, Lincolnshire. The couple lived in St Martin-in-the-Fields and had two sons and two daughters. Both sons followed their father in the service of the state: the elder, James, was a government official, and the younger, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28237/', "Edward Vernon (1684&#150;1757)")</script>, became an admiral. Vernon's wealth and position increased further with the death of his elder brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28239/', "Francis Vernon")</script>, in 1677, and in the same year he met Godfrey Kneller and became his patron. Kneller painted Vernon's portrait, and in return Vernon paid the rent on a house in Durham Yard for Kneller. In addition Vernon profitably introduced the artist to Monmouth. Kneller was grateful and noted that Vernon could &#145;introduce [me] to courtiers, for I take him for an honest and most charming gentleman, as all who know him say&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 4277, fol. 104).<br>
<br>As Monmouth's secretary Vernon served with the duke in Scotland and Flanders and was given a seat in parliament as his client. His relationship with Monmouth was close; it was alleged that it was Vernon who erased the word &#145;natural&#146; from Monmouth's patent for the post of commander-in-chief in 1674, which identified Monmouth as Charles II's &#145;natural son&#146;. While in Flanders with the duke Vernon kept a journal of the campaign of 1678 which was meant to illuminate his patron's noble deeds. In the campaign against the Scottish covenanters in 1679 Vernon remained ever close to the duke and was later satirized as one of Monmouth's creatures and a possible evil counsellor. He sat for Cambridge University in the first parliament of 1679 and voted for the bill to exclude the duke of York from the succession. Vernon later became uncomfortable with Monmouth's politics, expressing the wish to Edmund Warcup that &#145;M[onmouth] would leave the party and return to [the] K[ing]&#146;  (&#145;Journals of Edmund Warcup&#146;, 256). He did not, however, leave Monmouth's service until the duke went into exile for a second time in 1684. A warrant was issued for Vernon's arrest in June 1685 during Monmouth's rebellion. A whig &#145;collaborator&#146; in 1688, he went over to William's service by late December. He donated &pound;1500 to the new regime.<br>
<br>Vernon was subsequently employed on the <span class="italic">London Gazette</span> and then served as an under-secretary, or more correctly a private secretary, to the earl of Shrewsbury, secretary of state for the south, from February 1689 to June 1690. He then performed a similar task for Sir John Trenchard, and also served in Flanders as a collector of news from March 1693 to March 1694, until Shrewsbury's return to office from March 1694 until December 1697. In 1693 he was appointed a commissioner of prizes, a post he held until 1705. Vernon's work in the secretary's office was conscientious and professional. Although he was not an innovative bureaucrat, he was one of the new administrators who were engineering a revolution in government. Indeed it was probably he, rather than the increasingly absent Shrewsbury, who really ran affairs in the office. The lords justices appointed Vernon as their secretary during their meetings while William III was on campaign and Vernon was effectively acting as <i>de facto</i> southern secretary during Shrewsbury's absence. He was prominent in the investigations into the assassination plot of 1696, ensuring the charges made by Fenwick against Godolphin, Shrewsbury, Marlborough, and Russell were placed under a suitable veil of obscurity.<br>
<br>Shrewsbury's frequent moral and physical collapses and Sunderland's wrangling with the junto lords eventually led to the crisis of 1697 when, through Sunderland's influence, Vernon was, reluctantly he said, bounced upstairs to the post of northern secretary of state on 2 December in place of Sir William Trumbull. Before his appointment Vernon wrote to Shrewsbury that:<blockquote>You are coming into a strange intricacy. My Lord Chamberlain [Sunderland] in some companies, declares for my Lord Wharton, and knows there is no such thing intended. My lord Wharton shews a willingness to accept it, and, at the bottom, has no mind to it &hellip; One you know [Vernon himself] is secretly designed for secretary, and he is utterly incapable of it. (<span class="italic">Letters Illustrative</span>, 1.431)</blockquote>Shrewsbury's fellow secretary Trumbull had in fact already complained of being slighted and swindled by Vernon in his work, and although Vernon tended to portray himself as a mere official lost in the world of grasping high politics, he was as keenly ambitious as any other later seventeenth-century politician. Despite tearful protests that he had never wanted the post in the first place Vernon seized the seals with alacrity when they were offered.<br>
<br>Vernon clung on to high office for some six years but he was not, however, a policy maker. He was in reality one of the &#145;little men &hellip; such as were framed for a dependence on a premier minister&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters Illustrative</span>, 2.359). He was often kept in ignorance as to the king's intentions in foreign affairs and as one satire put it, &#145;Vernon's by all men believed a meer Tool&#146;  (Lord and others, 6.222). Vernon also sat in parliament as a court whig for Penryn from 1695 to 1698, for Westminster from 1698 to December 1701, and for Penryn again from 1705 to 1710. He claimed in May 1699 that &#145;No man has ever had so little conversation with the Tories as myself&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters from James Vernon</span>, letter 183, 13 May 1699).<br>
<br>Vernon became sole secretary of state from December 1698 to May 1699. When the earl of Jersey was appointed in May 1699 Vernon went into the northern province out of choice, claiming that without rank or ambition he would be exposed to envy should he be placed as senior secretary. It may also be significant that negotiations with France, part of the southern secretary's brief, were also at a delicate stage. With Jersey's dismissal in June 1700 Vernon did take the southern post, but he was able to exchange once more in 1702. He had some part in the formation of the two partition treaties: he was confronted with the terms of the document in the first instance and told to sound out the leading whig responses. In the second case he was merely directed to prepare a commission authorizing the plenipotentiaries with the names left blank. Vernon escaped impeachment, although undoubtedly involved, because it was well known that his role was more of a clerk than a maker of policy and he eagerly produced incriminating documents to a parliament with bigger prey in its sight.<br>
<br>Vernon finally left the secretary's office on 1 May 1702 claiming that he was &#145;too obnoxious to the [Tory] party to be continued&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters Illustrative</span>, 3.222). His whig sympathies did not help his case, despite his still-diligent administrative capacity. It was then falsely rumoured that he was to go to Venice as envoy-extraordinary. To compensate him, however, Vernon was given an annual pension of &pound;1000 and his arrears were paid. He was also made teller in the exchequer, a sinecure post which he lost in 1710 on the victory of the tories. Ultimately Vernon seems to have been relieved that his administrative burden had finally been laid down: &#145;I please myself with the satisfaction I shall find in retirement, and the conversation of honest old authors&#146; and that it was &#145;infinitely preferable to the bustle of secretaryship&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters Illustrative</span>, 3.222&#150;9). He was a commissioner of the privy seal in 1716 but thereafter lived in retirement in Watford in Hertfordshire until his death on 31 January 1727, aged eighty-one. He was buried in Watford parish church.<br>
<br>One contemporary thought that Vernon had &#145;many good qualities, some of which one would not expect under so rough an outside&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters Illustrative</span>, 3.233). Ultimately Vernon was a functional man of government and business rather than a politician or statesman of the first order. Gifted in the administrative field, his earlier career had given him a number of opportunities which he ably exploited, and his voluminous correspondence bears testament to his involvement in much of the complex politics of the 1690s.<br>
