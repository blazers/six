<span class="headword">Pinwell,  George John</span>  (1842&#150;1875), <span class="occ">painter and illustrator</span>, was born on 26 December 1842 at 12 Great Mays Buildings, London, the son of John Pinwell, a carpenter thought to have been involved in building the original station at Surbiton, and his wife, Mary Ann Baker. In 1854 Pinwell's father died and Pinwell, though only twelve years old, was forced to work as a butterman's boy, calling out prices in the street. In 1861 his mother remarried and Pinwell, no longer forced to contribute to the financial support of the family, left home that year to study art. Supporting himself through work as an apprentice draftsman for a company that manufactured embroidery designs, Pinwell attended evening art classes at St Martin's School of Art. In 1862 Pinwell left St Martin's to study at Heatherley's academy. While attending the academy he left the embroidery firm, where he had met his future wife, Isabella Mercy Stevens, whom he married on 25 April 1865 at St Marylebone parish church in London, to create designs for Elkington, the London electroplate manufacturer.<br>
<br>It was in 1862 that Pinwell received his first commission for a wood-engraving illustration for the periodical <span class="italic">Once a Week</span>; <span class="italic">Saturnalia</span>, the title of his first illustration, appeared in the 31 January 1863 edition of the magazine. From 1863 until his untimely death in 1875 Pinwell was employed by the leading engraving firms of the day including Joseph Swain, J. W. Whymper, and the Dalziel Brothers, and produced more than 500 illustrations for books and periodicals. The periodicals included: <span class="italic">Good Words</span>, <span class="italic">Once a Week</span>, <span class="italic">The Graphic</span>, <span class="italic">London Society</span>, the <span class="italic">Churchman's Family Magazine</span>, the <span class="italic">Cornhill Magazine</span>, <span class="italic">Sunday at Home</span>, and <span class="italic">The Quiver</span>. Pinwell's book commissions included: <span class="italic">Dalziel's Illustrated Goldsmith</span> (1865), <span class="italic">Dalziel's Illustrated &#145;Arabian Nights&#146; Entertainments</span> (1865), <span class="italic">The Adventures of Gil Blas</span>, <span class="italic">Ballad Stories of the Affections</span>, and <span class="italic">A Round of Days</span> (all 1866), <span class="italic">Poems</span> by Jean Ingelow, <span class="italic">Golden Thoughts from Golden Foundations</span>, <span class="italic">Touches of Nature</span>, and <span class="italic">Wayside Posies</span> (all 1867), <span class="italic">North Coast and other Poems</span> and <span class="italic">The Uncommercial Traveller</span> (1868), and <span class="italic">Picture Posies</span> (1874). Books published after Pinwell's death continued to reprint the illustrations he had designed for earlier publications.<br>
<br>Pinwell exhibited his first watercolour painting, <span class="italic">An Incident in the Life of Oliver Goldsmith</span> (priv. coll.), in 1865 at the Dudley Gallery, London. The painting was developed from the theme and imagery he used in his illustrations for <span class="italic">Dalziel's Illustrated Goldsmith</span> of the same year; he often used his illustrations as the root subject matter for his watercolour paintings. In 1869 Pinwell was elected as an associate of the Society of Painters in Water Colours and in 1870 he became a full member. He contributed regularly to the society's exhibitions; his more important works included: two subjects from Browning's poem <span class="italic">The Pied Piper of Hamelin</span> (priv. coll., study in Tate collection) and <span class="italic">A Seat in St. James's Park</span> (priv. coll., studies in V&amp;A) in 1869; <span class="italic">The Elixir of Love</span> in 1871; <span class="italic">Gilbert a Becket's Troth&#151;the Saracen Maiden Entering London at Sundown</span> (Lady Lever Art Gallery, Port Sunlight) in 1872; and <span class="italic">The Great Lady</span> (priv. coll.) in 1873. He was also elected an honorary member of the Belgian Society of Painters in Watercolours. Pinwell also painted in oils, again often returning to the subject initially captured in illustrations. At his death in 1875 Pinwell left unfinished a large-scale oil painting entitled <span class="italic">Vanity Fair</span> (priv. coll.) that he had begun in 1873. It is believed that with this painting he was going to seek admission to the Royal Academy.<br>
<br>Pinwell was one of the group of artists referred to as the Idyllists by the art historian Gleeson White in his 1897 treatise on English illustration of the 1860s. Others comprising this group, as further defined by the critic Forest Reid in 1928, were Pinwell's peers Frederick Walker and John William North. In their paintings of figures in domestic or landscape settings the Idyllists blended the Pre-Raphaelite theories of realism with the demands of narrative expression, interjecting sentiment as needed. But, as Christopher Newall observed, &#145;Walker and North favored the thematic treatment of scenes from contemporary life. Pinwell retained the practice of giving imaginative form to historical or literary texts&#146;  (Newall, 83). Pinwell's art is often compared to that of Walker's yet he was in fact a closer friend to North and the two often shared commissions for illustrations.<br>
<br>Pinwell fell ill with a respiratory ailment and sought relief from his symptoms in the dry climate of Tangier. However, these attempts proved futile and on 8 September 1875 at his residence in Warwick House, 86 Adelaide Road, Haverstock Hill, London, Pinwell died. He was buried in Highgate cemetery. His wife survived him. A posthumous exhibition of his work was held in Deschamps's Gallery in New Bond Street in February 1876 and his remaining drawings, paintings, and sketches were sold by auction by Christie, Manson, and Woods on 16 March 1876. The Victoria and Albert Museum and British Museum, London, and the Boston Museum of Fine Arts hold collections of his works.<br>
