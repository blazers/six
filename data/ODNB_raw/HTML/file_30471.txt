<span class="headword">Ashley,  Wilfrid William</span>, Baron Mount Temple  (1867&#150;1939), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born in London on 13 September 1867, the only son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30470/', "(Anthony) Evelyn Melbourne Ashley (1836&#150;1907)")</script>, a Liberal Unionist politician, and his first wife, Sybella Charlotte (<i>d</i>. 1886), second daughter of Sir Walter Rockliffe Farquhar, third baronet. He was a grandson of the famous seventh earl of Shaftesbury. From his great-grandmother Emily Cowper, sister of Melbourne and later married to Palmerston [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/40959/', "Temple, Emily")</script>], he inherited Broadlands at Romsey in Hampshire, and Classiebawn, the Palmerston estate in co. Sligo on the west coast of Ireland. He was educated at Harrow School and at Magdalen College, Oxford, which he left without taking a degree, and then travelled widely, including in Africa and the Americas. He served in the Ayrshire militia (1886&#150;9), the Grenadier Guards (1889&#150;98), and the third (militia) battalion of the Hampshire regiment (1899&#150;1903).<br>
<br>Following his family's Liberal tradition in politics, Ashley acted in 1899 as private secretary to Sir Henry Campbell-Bannermann when he was leader of the opposition. Ashley served in the South African War and, after being invalided home, congratulated Campbell-Bannermann on his &#145;methods of barbarism&#146; speech in June 1901. He married on 4 January 1901 Amalia Mary Maud (1879&#150;1911), known as Maudie, the only child of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32323/', "Sir Ernest Joseph Cassel")</script>, the financier and philanthropist, and his wife, Annette, daughter of Robert Thompson Maxwell, of Croft House, near Darlington. Ashley was, however, soon looking for a Conservative seat in parliament and was elected for Blackpool in 1906 with a good majority, in spite of the Liberal landslide. He held that seat until the general election of 1918, when he became member for the Fylde division of Lancashire. In 1922 he was returned unopposed for the New Forest division of Hampshire, in an earlier form a family seat, which he represented until 1932. He served as a Conservative whip from 1911 to 1913 and was in favour of allowing the <span class="roman">Parliament Bill</span> to pass rather than risk a creation of peers.<br>
<br>Following the death of his first wife, and before setting out for military service in the First World War, Ashley married (on 29 August 1914) Muriel Emily 
    (Molly; <i>c</i>.1881&#150;1954)
  , elder daughter of the Revd Walter Spencer, of Fownhope Court, Hereford, and formerly wife of Arthur Lionel Ochoncar Forbes-Sempill, fifth son of the seventeenth Baron Sempill. After commanding the 20th battalion of the King's Liverpool regiment in 1914 in the rank of lieutenant-colonel, Ashley returned from France in 1915 to become parliamentary private secretary to the financial secretary to the War Office. He reached office in 1922 under Bonar Law as parliamentary secretary to the office of works and Ministry of Transport. The following year, when Baldwin became prime minister, he was transferred to the War Office as under-secretary of state.<br>
<br>In 1924 Ashley was made minister of transport and sworn of the privy council. He held the post until the Baldwin government relinquished office in 1929. He was responsible for the reorganization of that ministry at a time of greatly increasing traffic and growing competition between road and rail. He introduced one-way traffic schemes and roundabouts in London and then in other large cities. He designated &#145;arterial&#146; roads, the precursors of motorways. He consolidated the lighting regulations for motor vehicles, previously subject to local variations. He worked, through legislation and administratively, for the expansion of the electricity supply, particularly in rural areas. His attempts to provide for the building of a further bridge across the Thames near Charing Cross did not come to fruition during his tenure of office. The work of his ministry brought him into touch with the unemployment problem. He did not hold office again after 1929, but remained politically active. In January 1932 he was elevated to the peerage as Baron Mount Temple of Lee.<br>
<br>Among Ashley's many interests were those arising from his ownership of his Hampshire and Irish estates. He was high steward of Romsey, and a justice of the peace, deputy lieutenant, and alderman of the county of Hampshire. He was for several years chairman of the Anti-Socialist and Anti-Communist Union and president of the Navy League, and was one of the founders of the Comrades of the Great War, precursor of the British Legion.<br>
<br>Ashley developed pronounced right-wing, pro-imperialist, anti-socialist and anti-Bolshevik views. He was a strong supporter of the unionist position in Ireland, a political friend of Carson, and was active in promoting opposition to the creation of an Irish free state. He saw Irish republicanism as part of a worldwide conspiracy against the British empire. In 1921, when he felt the British government's writ had ceased to run in much of Ireland, he called for support for the loyalists in southern Ireland. He wrote to the prime minister asking for protection for his property in Ireland.<br>
<br>During the 1920s Ashley advocated Anglo-German understanding and organized Anglo-German conferences of industrialists. Regarding the Hitler regime as a bulwark against Bolshevism, he became in 1935 one of the founders of the Anglo-German Fellowship and was its president. He was a strong supporter of the policy of appeasement, and argued in parliamentary speeches and letters to <span class="italic">The Times</span> that national socialism was the most effective instrument of German national awakening and represented the culmination of the German rise to nationhood. It would make changes in eastern Europe inevitable, such as the federation, though not incorporation, of Austria with Germany and the autonomy of the Germans in the Sudeten areas. He paid several visits to Germany. During one of them, to mark the beginning of Sir Nevile Henderson's tenure of the British embassy in Berlin in June 1937, he had a long interview with Hitler, at which only an interpreter was present. He regarded Hitler's anti-Jewish policy as a major stumbling-block to a better understanding and had as early as March 1933 presided over a meeting at the Whitechapel Art Gallery protesting against the treatment of Jews in Germany. In October 1938, after the Munich agreement, he was among twenty-six signatories of a letter to <span class="italic">The Times</span>, calling the agreement &#145;the rectification of one of the most flagrant injustices in the peace treaties&#146;. A few weeks later, after the anti-Jewish pogrom in Germany in November 1938, he resigned as president of the Anglo-German Fellowship, but he remained a member of the organization. In his letter of resignation he also protested against the treatment of Catholics and Lutherans by the Nazi regime.<br>
<br>Ashley was a strikingly good-looking man, of military bearing, courteous and tactful, with strongly held, rather conventional views, sometimes regarded as reactionary. He had a wide social circle, including royalty, beginning with Edward VII when he was prince of Wales. He died of Parkinson's disease at Broadlands on 3 July 1939. His funeral took place on 6 July in Romsey Abbey and he was buried there.<br>
<br>Ashley had two daughters from his first marriage. The first, Edwina [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35133/', "Mountbatten, Edwina Cynthia Annette")</script>], married in 1922 Lord Louis Mountbatten, later first Earl Mountbatten of Burma. The younger daughter, Ruth Mary Clarisse, married in 1927 her father's parliamentary private secretary, Alec Stratford Cunningham-Reid MP (marriage dissolved, 1940), in 1940 Major Ernest Laurie Gardner, son of Sir Ernest Gardner MP (marriage dissolved, 1941), and in 1943 Thomas Pitt Hamilton Cholmondeley, the fourth Baron Delamere (marriage dissolved, 1955).<br>
