<span class="headword">Coffin, Sir  Isaac</span>, baronet  (1759&#150;1839), <span class="occ">naval officer and inventor of a mechanized oven</span>, was the fourth son of Nathaniel Coffin, an officer of the customs at Boston, Massachusetts, where Isaac was born on 16 May 1759. His mother was Elizabeth, daughter of Henry Barnes, a Boston merchant. On his father's side he was a descendant of Tristram Coffin (1605&#150;1681), one of the founders of Nantucket. He entered the navy as a volunteer in 1773 under the patronage of Rear-Admiral John Montagu, then commander-in-chief on the North American station, and was promoted lieutenant five years later. He was then appointed to the command of the schooner <i>Placentia</i>, and afterwards the armed ship <i>Pinson</i>, the latter being wrecked on the coast of Labrador in 1779. Two years later he was one of the lieutenants of the <i>Royal Oak</i> with Vice-Admiral Marriot Arbuthnot, and acted as signal-lieutenant in the action off Cape Henry. On 3 July 1781 he was made commander, and towards the winter, when Sir Samuel Hood was returning to the West Indies, he obtained permission to serve as a volunteer on the <i>Barfleur</i>, Sir Samuel's flagship. He was thus present in the brilliant action at St Kitt's, and by Hood's interest was promoted captain of the <i>Shrewsbury</i> (74 guns) on 13 June 1782.<br>
<br>Coffin had scarcely taken up his commission before he was involved in a difficulty which an older officer might well have feared. Three youths of respectively five, four, and two years' service at sea were appointed by Sir George Rodney as lieutenants of the <i>Shrewsbury</i>. Coffin, in the first instance, refused to receive them, judging them unfit to hold this rank. Afterwards, understanding that it was Rodney's positive order, he did receive them; he was nevertheless tried by court martial for disobedience and contempt. The trial was held at Port Royal on 29 July, when his own commission was scarcely more than six weeks old. He was acquitted of contempt and also of the charge of disobedience. However, the three lieutenants remained on the <i>Shrewsbury</i> and it was not until Coffin wrote (20 September 1782), begging their lordships to have them suspended, that the Admiralty issued an order (14 December) cancelling their commissions. Before the order came out Coffin had been removed into the <i>Hydra</i> (20 guns), which he took to England and paid off.<br>
<br>Coffin then spent some time in France, and in 1786 was appointed to command the frigate <i>Thisbe</i>, which was ordered to carry Lord Dorchester and his family to Quebec. In 1787 he alerted the Quebec council to the New England exploitation of the fisheries in the Gulf of St Lawrence and to their illicit trade with the Magdalen Islands. In 1798 Coffin received letters patent to the seigneury of these islands. He failed to settle a single family there, and in 1806 he tried unsuccessfully to remove twenty-two families, who had relocated from St Pierre and Miquelon. While still on the North American station he was, in 1788, accused by the master of knowingly signing a false muster. When the case was brought before a court martial it was shown that four young gentlemen were borne on the ship's books as captain's servants, but had not been present on board. This was in fact a common custom and the charge was undoubtedly brought out of malice. The court was compelled to find Coffin guilty, and sentenced him to be dismissed his ship. When the sentence came home Lord Howe, then first lord of the Admiralty, at once saw that it was a blunder, and by way of correcting it ordered Coffin's name to be struck off the list (the punishment required by law). Coffin petitioned against Howe's decision, and by the king's command the case was submitted to the judges, who pronounced the court's sentence illegal, that it could not be enforced by another authority. Coffin was therefore reinstated in the service. The case continued to be quoted throughout the nineteenth century as a precedent, establishing the limits of Admiralty interference with the sentence of a court martial.<br>
<br>Coffin, who had retired to the continent, now returned to England, and in 1790 he was appointed to the <i>Alligator</i> (20 guns). In the following year the <i>Alligator</i> was sent to America to bring back Lord Dorchester and was paid off. Coffin subsequently made a lengthy visit to Denmark, Sweden, and Russia, possibly with the idea of entering the service of one of those states. On the outbreak of the war with France he returned to England, and was appointed to the <i>Melampus</i> (36 guns) in the channel. While serving in her towards the end of 1794 he suffered a recurrence of an injury he had sustained while in the <i>Alligator</i>. Coffin was never again fit for active service. He was appointed regulating captain at Leith, but in October 1795 he was sent to Corsica as commissioner of the navy. When that island was evacuated in October 1796 he was sent to Lisbon in the same capacity. In 1798 he was removed to Minorca and in the following year he was appointed commissioner of Sheerness Dockyard. When instead this responsibility was given to Henry Duncan, then on leave in England, Coffin replaced Duncan at the Halifax yard.<br>
<br>Coffin's six months in Halifax from mid-October 1799, before he was newly appointed to Sheerness, were memorable principally for a reign of terror he initiated. He was the only Halifax commissioner ever regularly to issue orders. He told his yard officers to ignore the naval captains' orders, which frequently strayed from Navy Board rules. He countermanded the vice-admiral's order to the naval storekeeper to issue fuel to yard lodges for officers, occupied when ships were refitting. He accused all ships' warrant officers of embezzlement (a charge which he never investigated) and captains of twice storing their ships without ever proceeding to sea, which &#145;unprecedented insult&#146; they denied  (TNA: PRO, ADM 1/2139). He forbade the yard officers to offer, as had been their habit, immediate assistance to merchant vessels in grave difficulty when entering harbour. He suspected everyone in the yard of fraud and embezzlement, and suspended the master shipwright and foreman of the yard, both of whom were reinstated when Coffin departed. That he was able to act with such brashness undoubtedly owed much to the protection he received from his patron, the earl of St Vincent, then first lord of the Admiralty. As commissioner at Sheerness (1801&#150;5) Coffin &#145;imposed a vigorous reorganization&#146;, with &#145;little regard for artificers' interests&#146;  (Morriss, 123). In April 1801, when he impressed a yard worker for insolence and disobedience, a large number of artificers, riggers, and labourers threatened his life, forcing him to revoke his order  (Coffin to Admiralty, 13 April 1801, TNA: PRO, ADM 106/1844).<br>
<br>If often aggressive in his manner, Coffin was warmly praised by St Vincent for his skills of naval administration. Never losing the Admiralty's or Navy Board's support, he reached flag-rank in April 1804, and a month later was created a baronet. He became admiral-superintendent at Portsmouth, a post he held until promoted vice-admiral in April 1808. On 15 May 1810 Coffin patented a &#145;perpetual oven&#146;, so called &#145;because the operation of baking may be continued for any length of time&#146;  (Giedion, 176). The oven was designed to bake sea-biscuits for the navy, but its use of an endless belt made of loose wire mesh, perpetually running throughout the baking chamber with the help of cast-iron rollers, anticipated the industrial bread-baking ovens patented in the mid-nineteenth and early twentieth centuries and was a substantial technological contribution to the development of mechanized food production.<br>
<br>Although pensioned and on half pay Coffin continued to be advanced in rank, and became admiral of the blue in June 1814. On 3 April 1811 he had married Elizabeth Browne (<i>d</i>. 1839), daughter and heir of William Greenly of Titley Court, Herefordshire. In February of that year he took the name Greenly in anticipation of his marriage, but he dropped it after March 1813. Coffin had expressed interest in becoming an MP for a number of years before he was finally elected for Ilchester in 1818. He sat until 1826 and spoke often on naval issues. Coffin also maintained close personal and business links with New England. He claimed to have crossed the Atlantic on thirty occasions (his last visit coming in 1829) and was responsible for importing English racehorses, plants, and stocks of European turbot for commercial fishing. In 1827 he gave &pound;2500 for the creation, on Nantucket, of Sir Isaac Coffin's Lancastrian School, for the general education of the island's children and for nautical training, which took place on a brig, <i>Clio</i>, which he purchased during his final visit to New England. The school, rebuilt after a fire in 1854, continued until the early twentieth century and is now home to the Egan Maritime Institute. In England he was a regular benefactor to the Royal Naval School, for the last time in June 1839 &#145;fearful I may suddenly &#147;slip my wind&#148;&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 11 June 1839). Coffin died soon after, at Cheltenham, on 23 July 1839, six months after his wife's death. Because he died without an heir Coffin's baronetcy became extinct.<br>
