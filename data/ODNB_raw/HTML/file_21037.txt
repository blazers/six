<span class="headword">Wiliam Ll&#375;n</span>  (1534/5&#150;1580), <span class="occ">Welsh-language poet</span>, may have hailed from Ll&#375;n in Caernarvonshire: the name adopted by Wiliam, and by his brother and fellow poet Huw Ll&#375;n, and references by contemporary poets, support this supposition. In spite of several conjectures&#151;one links Wiliam with the Griffith family of Cefnamwlch&#151;the exact nature of his connection with Ll&#375;n remains a mystery. What is known is that by 1569 he had married and settled in Oswestry (his son, Richard, was baptized there that year), and a lease of 1574 shows that he was residing in Willow Street in a house that he later bequeathed to his wife, Elizabeth, and which she subsequently leased (1587) to Ll&#375;n's bardic pupil and elegist, Rhys Cain.<br>
<br>The earliest poem by Wiliam that can be accurately dated is a series of <i>englynion</i> to Gruffudd Dwnn of Ystradmerthyr, Carmarthenshire, composed in 1557. Thomas Wiliems claims that Dwnn, who was renowned for his patronage and learning, instructed both Wiliam and his brother Huw in the poetic art  (Cardiff Central Library, Cardiff MS 4.330, 223). Wiliam himself acknowledges his debt to the poet Si&ocirc;n Brwynog of Llanfflewin, Anglesey, who died in 1562  (Stephens, poem 101), but his most important bardic teacher, and the figure with whom he is invariably associated, was Gruffudd Hiraethog. Of Gruffudd's numerous pupils it was Ll&#375;n who gained pre-eminence [<i>see also </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/48659/', "Cywyddwyr (act. c.1330&#150;c.1650)")</script>]. According to the master, &#145;Nid oes dim yn anwybodus i Wiliam Ll&#375;n&#146; (&#145;There is nothing that Wiliam Ll&#375;n does not know&#146;; Bowen, 242). After his death in 1564 many of Gruffudd's books found their way to Wiliam's home in Willow Street. Wiliam followed in his mentor's footsteps, and, having previously graduated as <i>disgybl disgyblaidd</i> (&#145;amenable apprentice&#146;), won recognition as <i>pencerdd</i> (&#145;chief of song&#146;), and possibly as bardic teacher, at the Caerwys eisteddfod of 1567. Wiliam's poignant elegy to Gruffudd is regarded as his most outstanding composition.<br>
<br>Gruffudd's books contained genealogical and heraldic material. Wiliam annotated and augmented these; he likewise compiled genealogical and heraldic books which now form part of the Peniarth collection at the National Library of Wales, Aberystwyth, as well as historical, grammatical, and astronomical texts, which have not survived. His vocabulary (Cardiff Central Library, Cardiff MS 3.12) was patterned on Gruffudd's, and he exemplified individual words with quotes from his own poems and those of contemporary and earlier poets. Wiliam in turn bequeathed &#145;all the bookes and rolls that I have&#146; to his pupil Rhys Cain  (Morrice, xx&#150;xxi), who paid tribute to his instructor in a moving elegy, as did another pupil, Si&ocirc;n Phylip.<br>
<br>Between 1557 and 1580 Wiliam composed about 175 <i>cywyddau</i> and <i>awdlau</i>, half of which are safeguarded in two manuscript collections in his own handwriting (Cardiff Central Library, Cardiff MSS 2.103, 5.167). In many cases the year of composition is conveniently recorded. The note &#145;Wm llyn ai k ar diwaytha y kafodd dal am dano 1580&#146; (&#145;Composed by Wiliam Ll&#375;n; the last for which he received payment 1580&#146;) follows the <i>cywydd</i> to Edward Llwyd of Plas Is-y-clawdd, Chirk. These pieces are mostly eulogies and elegies to members of the gentry, and occasionally to church dignitaries such as Richard Davies, bishop of St David's, and to lesser lights, such as Owain ap Gwilym, curate of Tal-y-llyn in Merioneth. In keeping with the poet's social role in late medieval Wales, Wiliam composed verse soliciting gifts on behalf of his patrons; he also had cause to thank two of his patrons for gifts&#151;a peacock and a bow&#151;that he received.<br>
<br>Wiliam seems to have been reluctant to travel far from Oswestry in his search for patronage. The greatest number of his poems by far were addressed to families in the counties of Flint and Denbigh, Merioneth and Montgomery, and visits to Caernarvonshire and Anglesey in the north, and to south Wales, were noticeably less frequent. On one occasion he was induced to seek reconciliation with one Wiliam Gruffudd of Caernarfon. Reading between the lines, it appears that Wiliam had failed to keep an engagement, and, significantly, his two other conciliatory poems sought to appease patrons who lived across the Menai Strait in Anglesey. It is not inconceivable that their evident displeasure could have been the result of a broken promise by the poet.<br>
<br>Welsh poets in the second half of the sixteenth century used the <i>englyn</i> form to a far greater degree than their predecessors, and Wiliam Ll&#375;n was no exception. About 100 of his <i>englynion</i> have been recorded. Those describing the hospitality he received in individual homesteads naturally belong to the same genre as his more formal praise poetry. Others convey his dealings with fellow poets such as Morys Dwyfech, Raff ap Robert, and Simwnt Fychan. Many can be loosely described as love and religious verses, two themes that are given no prominence in the <i>cywyddau</i> and <i>awdlau</i>. Wiliam is credited with only one religious <i>cywydd</i>, which is somewhat reminiscent of Si&ocirc;n Cent, and one love poem (Gruffudd Hiraethog again comes to mind), an <i>awdl</i>, which effectively demonstrates his technical dexterity even if its content lacks passion.<br>
<br>Wiliam Ll&#375;n's importance as an elegist has long been recognized. J. C. Morrice claimed that he was &#145;the best elegist not only of the sixteenth century but, perhaps, of all Welsh bards&#146;  (Morrice, xxxix). The acute expression given to the poet's personal lamentation at the loss of a patron and acquaintance and to the grief felt by family and society alike is in keeping with this particular genre. In Wiliam's elegies, stark and candid comments of the inevitability of death and man's helplessness in view of his impending fate recur with unnerving consistency, all conveyed in a dignified yet sparing and proverbial style that complements the <i>cywydd</i>'s compact couplets. The two most remarkable elegies were composed to Gruffudd Hiraethog and to fellow poet, Owain ap Gwilym, the latter recorded in over ninety manuscript sources. Both feature a dialogue between the dead and the living, a device employed by Rhys Cain when he had cause to mourn Wiliam Ll&#375;n's death, and copied by several poets during the course of the following century, especially in connection with the death of a member of the bardic fraternity. Saunders Lewis and other critics have argued that Wiliam's elegies are an expression of Renaissance stoicism.<br>
<br>Nine poems by Wiliam (including the two elegies mentioned) were included in <span class="italic">Gorchestion beirdd Cymru</span> (1773) and about 100 in <span class="italic">Cynfeirdd Lleyn</span> (1905). The most comprehensive collection of his works, Morrice's <span class="italic">Barddoniaeth Wiliam Ll&#375;n</span> (1908), unfortunately contains verse that cannot now be safely attributed to the poet.<br>
<br>The registers of Oswestry parish church record the death and burial there of &#145;Will'm Llyn Bardus&#146; on the last day of August 1580. According to Rhys Cain, Wiliam Ll&#375;n died before reaching the age of forty-six.<br>
