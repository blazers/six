<span class="headword">Close,  Nicholas</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1452), <span class="occ">bishop of Coventry and Lichfield</span>, was probably a member of a minor Westmorland family, and most likely began his ecclesiastical career in the diocese of Carlisle. Stephen Close, a master of arts of Cambridge and a chaplain of Bishop Lumley of Carlisle in 1448, who acted as Nicholas's proctor in Rome in respect of both his episcopal promotions, was surely a kinsman.<br>
<br>Close's career was established during his time at Cambridge University, where he was acting as a proctor in 1433&#150;5 and obtained the degrees of BTh by March 1441 and DTh by 1445. More especially, he was nominated on 13 February 1441 by Henry VI as one of the first six fellows of King's College. The accounts of the college show Close's heavy personal involvement in the consolidation of the new foundation, and in 1447 he became its official master of works. On 22 March 1446 he had actually been appointed warden of the older King's Hall, remaining so until 1452, but on 30 November that year was appointed warden of King's College, or at least granted the reversion. By 22 March 1446 he had been appointed a royal chaplain, a sign of favour he still held on 9 January 1448, when the pope described him as &#145;continually commensal&#146; with the king  (<span class="italic">CEPR letters</span>, 10.11). In early July 1449 Close was serving as chancellor of the university when he was commissioned to treat for a truce with the Scots. Probably on 30 January 1450 he was granted arms by the king &#145;for the laudable services rendered by him in many diverse ways, both in the work of building our college royal and in other matters&#146;  (Bouch, 117).<br>
<br>Close was admitted as vicar of St Zachary's, Cambridge, on 16 May 1445. On 22 March 1446 he was granted the wardenship of St Nicholas's Hospital, Carlisle, for life, and he was archdeacon of Carlisle by 9 January 1448. The then bishop, Marmaduke Lumley, an impressive treasurer of the realm, was already being vigorously supported by the government for promotion to some greater see, at this time London. It can be no coincidence that Close was made archdeacon of Colchester in that diocese on 15 February 1449. Given the king's personal favour, his own local birth and preferment, and perhaps even the personal goodwill of his predecessor, Close's papal provision to Carlisle on 30 January 1450, when Lumley finally secured Lincoln, is no surprise. The temporalities were restored on 14 March, and his metropolitan, Cardinal Kemp, consecrated him at York House in Westminster on the following day.<br>
<br>Close had secured permission from the pope to make formal visitations of his diocese by deputy for life and to receive procurations in cash, &#145;he being much hindered by the service of [the king], that he cannot do so in person, and it being more burdensome to be visited by the bishop than by his officials&#146;  (<span class="italic">CEPR letters</span>, 10.57). If the second reason was brazenly disingenuous, the first may have been rendered redundant by circumstances even before the bull was issued, although Close's service to the king had not been political. A satirical ballad of the summer of 1450 calls upon the bishop of Carlisle to &#145;sing <span class="italic">Credo</span> full sore, &#147;to such false traitors come foule ending&#148;&#146;, but possibly its author still had Lumley in mind  (Wright, 2.234). Close's whereabouts during 1450 are quite unknown; there is no sign of him in Cambridge, his diocese, or with the king. The loss of his Carlisle register hides his whereabouts throughout his episcopacy. In 1451, however, he was appointed a commissioner to investigate the performance of the conservators of the truce with Scotland, which suggests that he would be at least visiting his diocese.<br>
<br>It is clear, however, that the king retained a high opinion of Close, who on 30 August 1452 was translated to the more considerable see of Coventry and Lichfield, with restitution of temporalities being made as early as 8 September. In the event, he barely lived to enjoy his advancement, and again no evidence survives of his initial administrative arrangements. He died on 24 November 1452, intestate. King's College none the less came to possess his library. As he had already given it a number of valuables, this would no doubt have been to his satisfaction. It had been the corner-stone of his achievement.<br>
