<span class="headword">Stewart,  Robert</span>, first marquess of Londonderry  (1739&#150;1821), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born in Ireland on 27 September 1739, the elder of the two sons of Alexander Stewart (1700&#150;1781), landowner and MP for Londonderry, of Ballylawn Castle, co. Donegal, and Mount Stewart, co. Down, and his wife, Mary (1713&#150;1788), the only daughter of Alderman John Cowan of St Johnston, Londonderry, and the niece and eventual heir of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/63503/', "Sir Robert Cowan (d. 1737)")</script>, governor of Bombay (1728&#150;34). His family roots were Scottish and Presbyterian. His education is obscure, but during his grand tour he was portrayed by Anton Mengs in Rome about 1758. He probably met Lord Charlemont, long his friend, in Italy. He was twice married: first, on 3 June 1766, to Lady Sarah Frances (1747&#150;1770), the second daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6121/', "Francis Seymour Conway, marquess of Hertford (1718&#150;1794)")</script>, a courtier, and his wife, Isabella Fitzroy; his future father-in-law wrote of him just before the marriage that he was &#145;heir to a great property and already in possession of many amiable and good qualities&#146;  (Walpole, <span class="italic">Corr.</span>, 39.71). <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26507/', "Robert Stewart, second marquess of Londonderry (1769&#150;1822)")</script>, the future foreign secretary, was the younger of their two sons; his elder brother, Alexander Francis, died young in 1767. Stewart married second, on 7 June 1775, Lady Frances Pratt (1750&#150;1833), the eldest daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22699/', "Charles Pratt, first Earl Camden (1714&#150;1794)")</script>, lord chancellor, and his wife, Elizabeth Jeffreys. They had three sons and eight daughters. Of his second family, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26467/', "General Charles William Vane (1778&#150;1854)")</script>, an army officer and diplomatist, later third marquess, was the eldest son.<br>
<br>Stewart's family was influential in Down, for which constituency he was elected to the Irish parliament in 1771. He was re-elected in 1776, but lost the seat in 1783 in an embarrassing contest, which diminished his popularity. At the next election, in 1790, by which time he had become a peer, he financed his son Robert's successful contest for the same constituency. He was never a prominent public figure after 1783, though during the Irish volunteer movement he had been one of their colonels, and as a delegate to the second Dungannon convention in 1783 chaired their reform debates, leaving it to Henry Flood to formulate their wishes. He was advanced to the peerage by William Pitt as Baron Londonderry on 20 September 1789, having previously been sworn of the Irish privy council on 17 September 1782 and made a trustee of the linen board during Lord Lansdowne's ministry. He had then declined a peerage. After his brother-in-law, the second Earl Camden, became lord lieutenant, he was created Viscount Castlereagh on 1 October 1795, earl of Londonderry on 8 August 1796, and marquess of Londonderry on 13 January 1816.<br>
<br>From 1801 Londonderry was an Irish representative peer in the Westminster parliament. He had reported to his son Robert and to his brother-in-law in December 1798 that, while the prospect of Anglo-Irish union did not enthuse Ulster, there had been more support for it among leading figures than he expected, and he attributed this to disgust with the corruption of the Dublin parliament. He was appointed in 1801 and 1803 governor and custos of the counties of Down and Londonderry respectively. His claims to be made a peer of the United Kingdom in 1800, in consideration of his son Robert's services, though unsolicited by either father or son, were favourably considered by the crown, and an assurance was given that, if in future he or his descendants should desire the honour, their wish would be granted. Neither he nor his son claimed the fulfilment of this promise, most probably because they wished to prevent Robert's removal from the House of Commons.<br>
<br>In private life Londonderry was not only charitable, but enlightened. He resided on his estates almost exclusively, and encouraged tenant right; he never accepted paper money from tenants, but remitted rents in hard times; he provided work for the unemployed and imported food supplies for the distressed. To his family, and particularly to the career of his son Robert, of whose success he lived to be proud, he was devoted. He remodelled Mount Stewart in 1803&#150;6 after a design by George Dance, who also painted his portrait. He died at Mount Stewart on 6 April 1821, and was buried at Newtownards on 9 April. His widow died on 18 January 1833 at Hastings, Sussex, and was buried at Bayham Abbey, Kent.<br>
