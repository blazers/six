<span class="headword">Ashton,  Hugh</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1522), <span class="occ">Catholic ecclesiastic and university benefactor</span>, apparently never himself had a formal university education, his main expertise lying in administration and estate management. He probably first encountered Lady Margaret Beaufort, countess of Richmond and Derby, in Lancashire, his native county, and rose to prominence through this association. On 7 January 1496 he was admitted to the rectory of Normanton in Derbyshire on the presentation of Thomas Legh of Adlington, and in 1502 he secured the rectory of Barnack in Northamptonshire, which he vacated in 1517. He became Lady Margaret Beaufort's receiver-general in 1502, and controller of her household six years later. In 1504 she gave him the rectory of Lythe in Yorkshire, and in this same decade he acquired the living of Grasmere in Westmorland, which he surrendered in 1509. In July 1522, only months before he died, he obtained the Northamptonshire rectory of Burton Latimer. He also accumulated much preferment without cure of souls, beginning about 1504 with a prebend in the church of Stafford, and including prebends in 1507 in Exeter and Salisbury cathedrals which he surrendered in 1516 and 1517 respectively, soon after receiving from Wolsey in 1515 the golden prebend of Strensall in York Minster, worth &pound;105 a year. In 1509 the crown appointed him to a canonry in St Stephen's Chapel, Westminster, which he retained for the rest of his life. He was also collated in 1511 to the archdeaconry of Winchester, relinquished in 1520, in 1515 to the archdeaconry of Cornwall, kept for only two years, and in 1516 to the archdeaconry of York, which he held until his death.<br>
<br>Lady Margaret involved Ashton in the complicated negotiations which ultimately resulted in the foundation of her two Cambridge colleges of Christ's and St John's, and it was probably at her instigation that he was granted the degree of bachelor of canon law by the university in 1508. On her death in 1509 he served as one of the executors of her will, and in this capacity supervised the building of St John's College. Ashton committed himself personally to St John's, in his lifetime endowing four fellowships at the college for scholars from Lancashire, Yorkshire, or Durham, and adding exhibitions for four students at his death. Before he died he had set in progress the construction of his monument in his chantry chapel within St John's chapel, where his fellows and scholars were to say mass for his soul and the souls of the Lady Margaret, his parents, and his benefactors.<br>
<br>During his last years Ashton seems to have spent part of his time in London, and part in York, where he took up his duties as a canon residentiary and was placed on government commissions to investigate imparking of land and to inspect sewers in Yorkshire. The stained glass window bearing an inscription requesting prayers for his soul, which he donated to St Leonard's Hospital in York, probably dates from this period. He died in York on 9 December 1522, and was buried in the minster on 4 January 1523. In his will, made on 7 December and proved on 9 March 1523, he appointed as his executors Brian Higdon, the dean of York, Robert Shirton, a canon of York, his brother William Ashton, and Roger Ellis. He established obits in St Stephen's Chapel and York Minster, as well as at St John's College, to which he left a quarter of his plate. The remainder of his plate went to his sister's son, Thomas Mawdesley, his brother's son, James Ashton, and his brother's daughter, the wife of Anthony Crook. He bequeathed a tenement in Lathom in Lancashire to Thomas Mawdesley and a tenement and lands in Mawdesley, also in Lancashire, to James Ashton, and, in addition to making legacies to his many servants, he asked his brother to distribute his household stuff among his relatives.<br>
