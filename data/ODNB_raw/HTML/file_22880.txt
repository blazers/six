<span class="headword">Pullen,  Tobias</span>  (1648&#150;1713), <span class="occ">Church of Ireland bishop of Dromore</span>, was born at Middleham, Yorkshire, the son of Joshua Pullen (<i>d</i>. 1657), dean of Middleham, and Hester Stannicliffe, and was the fourth child in a family of four boys and one girl. Owing, it is said, to the interest of his uncle, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22878/', "Samuel Pullen (bap. 1598, d. 1667)")</script>, archbishop of Tuam, he entered Trinity College, Dublin, on 11 March 1664 at the age of sixteen and was elected to a scholarship in 1668. While still a student he was appointed in 1666, by his uncle, as a vicar-choral of St Mary's Cathedral, Tuam, and while he was permitted to enjoy the emoluments of the post he was granted leave of absence for six years to continue his studies in Dublin. It is uncertain if he was ordained at this time as he was below the canonical age, but he had been ordained by 1671, when he was elected a fellow of Trinity College. In May 1667 he was appointed to the college living of Tullyaughnish in the diocese of Raphoe, to which he added, in September of the same year, the treasurership of Armagh Cathedral and the appropriated rectory of Creggan. Having resigned his fellowship in May of the previous year on 16 May 1678 he married Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1691), daughter of alderman Robert Leigh of Drogheda, co. Louth, with whom he had five children: Thomas (<i>b</i>. 1679), Samuel (<i>b</i>. 1682), Isabella (<i>b</i>. 1683), Elizabeth (<i>b</i>. 1684), and Joshua (1687&#150;1767), who became chancellor of Dromore Cathedral in 1727. Pullen resigned his Raphoe and Armagh livings in 1682 when he was appointed dean of Ferns, but retained an interest in Armagh with his appointment as rector of Louth and Bewley and vicar of St Peter's, Drogheda, where he resided. He also retained his links with Trinity College, Dublin, from which he graduated BD and DD in 1688.<br>
<br>In January 1689 Pullen fled to England before the advancing Jacobites, abandoning in Drogheda his books and manuscripts, which were seized by an Irish Roman Catholic, Nicholas Fitzgerald. He was attainted of treason by the Irish parliament in 1689, but, following the accession of William and Mary, Pullen returned to Ireland, where by February 1691 he was attempting to recover his stolen property. Later in the same year his wife died and was buried in St Peter's Church, Drogheda, on 4 October 1691. On the recommendation of Thomas Tenison, bishop of Lincoln, Pullen was appointed by letters patent of 13 November 1694 to the bishopric of Cloyne, with which he was permitted to continue to hold the rectories of Louth and Bewley. However, in the following year he was translated to the see of Dromore, where he built an episcopal residence at Magheralin.<br>
<br>In 1695 Pullen published, anonymously, <span class="italic">An Answer to the Case of the Protestant Dissenters of Ireland</span>, which sought to refute the arguments of Joseph Boyce, a presbyterian minister, who advocated toleration for dissenters in Ireland. Pullen was one of twenty-one bishops in the Irish House of Lords who in the same year voted down a bill which would have eased the position of dissenters, and his loyalty to the establishment was further demonstrated in November 1695 when he preached in Christ Church, Dublin, on &#145;the happy deliverance of James I from the gunpowder plot and the happy accession of his present majesty King William&#146;  (<span class="italic">A Sermon Preached in Christ Church</span>). He returned to the theme of religious toleration in 1697 when he published, again anonymously, a defence of his <span class="italic">Answer</span>. To him also is attributed the anonymous publication <span class="italic">A vindication of Sir Robert King's designs and actions in relation to the late and present Lord Kingston</span>, which appeared in 1699. That his time as bishop of Dromore was not devoted solely to politics is suggested by the gift in 1703 of a silver flagon to Dromore Cathedral, where it is still used. Pullen died on 22 January 1713 and was buried on 18 April in St Peter's Church, Drogheda, where he is memorialized as &#145;an able and faithful minister of Christ &hellip; honoured and beloved in every station&#146;  (Leslie, 239).<br>
