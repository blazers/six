<span class="headword">Greenstreet,  Sydney Hughes</span>  (1879&#150;1954), <span class="occ">actor</span>, was born on 27 December 1879 at The Butts, Sandwich, Kent, the son of John Jack Greenstreet, tanner, and his wife, Ann Baker. Educated at Dane Hill preparatory school, Margate, from 1887 to 1897, he worked as a tea planter in Ceylon between 1899 and 1901, memorizing Shakespeare to ameliorate the tedium. He was serving as agency manager for the Watney, Combe, Reid brewery in Harrow (1901&#150;2) when he joined the Ben Greet School of Acting and made his stage d&eacute;but as killer Jim Creigen in <span class="italic">Sherlock Holmes</span> by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle and William Gillette (1902) at the Marine Theatre, Ramsgate. Two years later he toured the United States with Greet's ensemble, making his Broadway bow in the morality play <span class="italic">Everyman</span> (1904). Settling in America (he became a citizen in 1925), he appeared in everything from <span class="italic">Twelfth Night</span> (1905) to popular farces such as <span class="italic">Excuse me</span> (1912), and he honed his craft with the Harry Davis Stock Company (1909&#150;10) and the Henry W. Savage Company (1910&#150;12). Although Greenstreet claimed to have spent much of this period &#145;sailing like a small blimp through bedroom farces&#146;  (Sennett, 9), he was also an accomplished Shakespearian clown, prompting Sir Herbert Beerbohm Tree, after his 1916 performance in <span class="italic">The Merry Wives of Windsor</span>, to describe him as &#145;the greatest unstarred star of the English stage&#146;  (ibid.). However, it was his Duke in <span class="italic">As You Like It</span> at Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania, that stood out; as the stage collapsed beneath him, he emerged from the rubble to deliver the line, &#145;True it is, we have seen better days&#146;  (Miller, 85).<br>
<br>In 1918 Greenstreet married Dorothy Marie Ogden, with whom he had a son, John Ogden Greenstreet. Meanwhile, his reputation for diverse characterization was continuing to burgeon in such plays as <span class="italic">The Rainbow Girl</span> (1918); <span class="italic">The Humble</span> (1925), a reworking of <span class="italic">Crime and Punishment</span>; <span class="italic">Much Ado about Nothing</span> (1928); Karel Capek's <span class="italic">R. U. R.</span> (1930); and <span class="italic">Roberta</span> by Jerome Kern and Otto Harbach (1933), in which he sang opposite Bob Hope. He also unearthed a talent for dastardy as Dr Grundt in <span class="italic">Berlin</span> (1931), with the <span class="italic">New York Times</span> declaring him &#145;a rip-snorting and delightfully malign villain&#146;  (Sennett, 11). However, his greatest stage successes came with the Broadway productions of the Theatre Guild (1935&#150;41), alongside Alfred Lunt and Lynn Fontanne. In addition to headlining Ben Jonson's <span class="italic">Volpone</span> (1930), he was acclaimed as Baptista in <span class="italic">The Taming of the Shrew</span> (1935), as Dr Waldersee in Robert E. Sherwood's <span class="italic">Idiot's Delight</span> (1936), and as Sorin in Anton Chekhov's <span class="italic">The Seagull</span> (1938). Yet it was Robert E. Sherwood's <span class="italic">There Shall be No Night</span> (1940) that transformed his career, for film director John Huston consequently cast him as Kasper Gutman in Warner Brothers' <span class="italic">The Maltese Falcon</span> (1941). Having rejected countless other Hollywood overtures, the 61-year-old d&eacute;butant made an immediate impression in this prototype <i>film noir</i>, landing a best supporting Oscar nomination. He also began a ten-film partnership with Peter Lorre&#151;their combination of jovial infamy and weaselly grasping earning them the nickname &#145;the Laurel and Hardy of crime&#146;  (Sennett, 2). In the majority of these pictures Greenstreet essayed sophisticated, corrupt villains, who chucklingly delighted in their malevolent ingenuity. He was invariably filmed from below, so that his imposing bulk could dominate the screen (his weight was usually about 285 lbs, but he could balloon to 325 lbs); he also had a genius for injecting black comedy into the most menacing dialogue. Having played Japanese collaborator Dr Lorenz in <span class="italic">Across the Pacific</span> (1942), he excelled as Se&ntilde;or Ferrari in <span class="italic">Casablanca</span> (1942). But, in reteaming with Lorre and Humphrey Bogart in one of the glories of the studio era, he had the misfortune to get stuck in an on-set telephone box, which had to be dismantled to release him.<br>
<br>A consummate professional who tolerated any amount of improvisation, providing he was fed his scripted cues, Greenstreet enlivened several mediocre movies with his inveterate scene-stealing. Warners demanded devilry and Greenstreet delivered: he was Nazi spy Colonel Robinson in <span class="italic">Background to Danger</span> (1943), the vengeful Mr Peters in <span class="italic">The Mask of Dimitrios</span> (1944), duplicitous solicitor Jerome K. Arbutny in <span class="italic">Three Strangers</span> (1946), disgraced police inspector George Grodman in <span class="italic">The Verdict</span> (1946), Count Fosco in <span class="italic">The Woman in White</span> (1948) and, perhaps his most malicious performance, Sheriff Titus Semple in <span class="italic">Flamingo Road</span> (1949). Greenstreet was considerably less effective in benign roles, such as the celestial interrogator in <span class="italic">Between Two Worlds</span> (1944) and the amateur sleuth in <span class="italic">Conflict</span> (1945), but he hankered after comedies, complaining that &#145;you'd hardly expect a musician to stick to one string on his violin&#146;  (Sennett, 197). Conveniently ignoring his unremarkable work in <span class="italic">Pillow to Post</span> and <span class="italic">Christmas in Connecticut</span> (both 1945), he retired in 1952, lamenting<blockquote>I was a character comedian on the stage for forty-one years, but not one single comedy role has come my way in Hollywood. So I'll keep turning down the sinister parts and take it easy until something worthwhile comes along, but it will have to be good. (ibid., 148)</blockquote>Having devoted himself to painting, sculpting, and collecting antiques, Greenstreet died in Los Angeles, California, from a combination of diabetes and Bright's disease, on 18 January 1954. He was buried in Forest Lawn memorial parks, Glendale, California.<br>
