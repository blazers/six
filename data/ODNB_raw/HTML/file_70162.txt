<span class="headword">Moses,  Miriam</span>  (1884&#150;1965), <span class="occ">local politician</span>, was born on 13 November 1884 at 19 Princes Street, Spitalfields, London, one of nine surviving children of Mark Moses (1855&#150;1921), tailor, and his wife, Hannah (Annie) Ehrenberg (1853/4&#150;1899). Mark Moses had been born in Torun, a port on the Vistula, then part of Germany, and came to Britain as an eight-year-old immigrant child. He established himself as a master tailor in a workshop situated on the lower floors of the tall Georgian house in Princes Street (later Princelet Street) where Miriam was born. Mark Moses became a local councillor, a member of the Whitechapel board of guardians, and a school governor. He was made a JP for the City of London in 1909. An Orthodox Jew, he was also active in Jewish communal life, in several synagogues, on the Board of Deputies of British Jews, and as treasurer of the Federation of Synagogues. Miriam was educated at Old Castle Street elementary school in Whitechapel. Her mother, also an active charity worker, died in 1899 at the age of forty-five when Miriam was only fourteen. Choosing never to marry, she followed in her father's footsteps into public life and Jewish communal service.<br>
<br>On the death of her father in May 1921 Miriam succeeded to his seat on Stepney borough council representing Spitalfields East in the Liberal interest. During the period 1921&#150;31 she was returned five times, always heading the poll by a significant majority. She also held office in the Whitechapel and St George's Liberal Association, of which her father had been chairman for twenty-five years. In 1931 Miriam was elected the first female mayor of Stepney. She stood as an independent, but effectively worked in the Progressive cause, in the face of Labour resentment. In fact, her popularity probably accounted for Labour's failure to take control in Spitalfields East until 1934, when she decided not to stand for re-election.<br>
<br>Miriam Moses combined her political work with practical engagement in social issues. She was particularly concerned to broaden opportunities for youngsters from deprived backgrounds. Among her earliest activities was the role of school manager for the Robert Montefiore and Buxton Street schools, and she was honorary secretary of the Stepney committee of the Children's Country Holiday Fund and chair of the Whitechapel Tuberculosis After-Care Committee. She was a member of the Whitechapel and Stepney board of guardians. About 1922 she became the first woman JP in Whitechapel, and she served on the east London juvenile court that sat at Toynbee Hall.<br>
<br>In 1925, together with Elsie Cohen, who later married Barnett Janner MP, Moses established the Brady Girls' Club at Buxton Street School. It was conceived as the girls' parallel of the Brady Boys' Club that had been founded in 1896. Miriam effectively served as club leader for thirty-three years, living in during the Second World War as warden of the purpose-built Brady Settlement which had been opened in Hanbury Street, in the East End, in 1935. Despite her progressive ideas, the boys' and girls' clubs were kept strictly apart along traditional lines. On retirement in 1958 Miriam appeared on the popular television show <span class="italic">This is your Life</span>, in which she was brought face to face with many old &#145;Brady girls&#146; upon whose lives she had exerted such influence.<br>
<br>Miriam saw service on the home front in both world wars: as a Voluntary Aid Detachment nurse at the Bancroft Road Hospital, off London's Mile End Road, in 1914&#150;18, and as chief air raid officer for the neighbourhood in 1939&#150;45. The shelter was located in the basement of the Brady Settlement, and Miriam set up a hostel on the premises for girls made homeless by bombing. She was appointed OBE in 1945, not least in recognition of her outstanding bravery during air raids.<br>
<br>About 1914, the Moses family had moved from the East End to Stamford Hill. Miriam was active on the ladies' guild of the newly built New Synagogue, Egerton Road, not far from the family home in Colberg Place. In 1931, during the same year that she was elected first woman mayor of Stepney, Miriam was the first woman chosen to represent a constituent synagogue of the umbrella United Synagogue on the Board of Deputies of British Jews. She waged a long campaign for the right of women seat-holders to vote in elections for the United Synagogue executive. This right was eventually granted in 1954. She was a founder member and later president of the League of Jewish Women, was on the executive of the Jewish Board of Guardians, and was a vice-president of the Association of Jewish Youth.<br>
<br>As a pioneer woman in public life in the 1930s, Miriam Moses was in favour of the municipal provision of contraception for poor mothers, an issue that she saw as a social question divorced from religion  (Marks, 267). Nevertheless, she personally remained attached to traditional Jewish practice and was known for her public observance of the Jewish sabbath and dietary laws. About 1934 Miriam Moses moved from Stamford Hill to West Hampstead. After returning to the East End during the war years, she subsequently retired to north-west London, living in turn in St John's Wood, West Hampstead, and Maida Vale. She died on 24 June 1965, aged eighty, at the Middlesex Hospital, London, and was buried three days later at the Federation Jewish cemetery, Edmonton.<br>
