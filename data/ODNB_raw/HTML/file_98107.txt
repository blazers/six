<span class="headword">Doyle,  William Joseph Gabriel</span>  (1873&#150;1917), <span class="occ">Roman Catholic priest and military chaplain</span>, was born at Dalkey, co. Dublin, on 3 March 1873, the youngest of seven children of Hugh Doyle, chief clerk of the high court of bankruptcy, and his wife, Christine, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Byrne. He was educated for six years at Ratcliffe College, Leicester, by the priests of the Rosminian order. He entered the Society of Jesus at Tullamore, King's county, Ireland, on 31 March 1891. After his novitiate his health did not allow him to pursue the course of Jesuit studies in its normal sequence and he worked as a teacher and prefect at Clongowes Wood College, co. Kildare, from 1894 to 1898 and from 1901 to 1904, at Clongowes and at Belvedere College, Dublin. He studied philosophy with the French Jesuits in Enghien, Belgium, and with the English Jesuits at St Mary's Hall, Stonyhurst, Lancashire, between 1898 and 1901, and theology at Milltown Park, Dublin (1904&#150;7). His final year of Jesuit training was spent at Tronchiennes in Belgium.<br>
<br>After his ordination as a priest on 28 July 1907 in Dublin, Doyle volunteered to be a missionary in the Belgian Congo but instead was sent to work as a home missioner and a director of retreats. He was in demand for this pastoral work in England, Scotland, and Wales as well as in Ireland. He saw the need for the spiritual care of working men, beyond what could be provided by the occasional missioner, and proposed a retreat house in Dublin to cater for their needs. He wrote some pamphlets which sold in very large numbers for many years and were translated into other languages: <span class="italic">Retreats for Working Men: Why not in Ireland</span> (1909), <span class="italic">Vocations</span> (1913), and <span class="italic">Shall I be a Priest?</span> (1915).<br>
<br>After the outbreak of the First World War Doyle volunteered and was appointed a military chaplain to the 16th division in 1915. He arrived in France early in 1916 as chaplain to the 8th battalion, Royal Irish Fusiliers, and the Royal Iniskilling Fusiliers, which together formed half of the 49th brigade. He gained a notable reputation as a chaplain for his bravery, energetic pastoral care, and kindness. He was awarded the Military Cross (January 1917) for his work with the wounded during the battle of the Somme. In December 1916 he was transferred to the 8th battalion, Royal Dublin Fusiliers, part of the 48th brigade. He was killed by a bomb on Frezenberg ridge, Belgium, during the third battle of Ypres, on 16 August 1917, while aiding the wounded. Reportedly given a hasty burial by soldiers in the field, no trace of his body has been found. He was posthumously recommended for the DSO for his earlier exploits at Wytschaete (June 1917) and for the VC for his bravery at Frezenberg. Neither award was made.<br>
<br>Doyle's personal papers, including his spiritual diary, found in Dublin after his death, were published in Alfred O'Rahilly's biography of Doyle (1920), which was frequently republished and was translated into other languages. Doyle had left instructions that these notes should be destroyed, but his religious superior and his elder brother, also a Jesuit, consented to their publication. They reveal a life of deep prayer and severe penance over many years. Interest in his spirituality led to the popular devotion to Doyle evident in Ireland and the Irish diaspora in the decades after his death. The cause for his canonization was proposed in Rome in 1938 but has not progressed.<br>
