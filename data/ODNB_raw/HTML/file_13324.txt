<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Hillyar, Sir  James</span>  (1769&#150;1843), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, eldest son of James Hillyar, surgeon in the navy, was born on 29 October 1769 at Portsea, Hampshire. He entered the navy in 1779, on the <i>Chatham</i>, under Captain John Orde, and was in her at the capture of the <i>Magicienne</i> off Boston on 2 September 1781. The <i>Chatham</i> was paid off at the peace in 1783, but Hillyar, continuing actively employed on the North American and home stations, was in 1793 appointed to the <i>Britannia</i>, flagship of Admiral Hotham. From there he was removed to the <i>Victory</i>, flagship of Lord Hood, who rewarded his conduct at Toulon, and afterwards in Corsica, with a commission, on 8 March 1794, as lieutenant of the <i>Aquilon</i> with Captain Robert Stopford. In her he was at the action of 1 June 1794; he was shortly afterwards moved, with Stopford, into the <i>Phaeton</i>, one of the frigates with Cornwallis in his retreat of 17 June 1794, and remained attached to the Channel Fleet until June 1799. Hillyar, again following Stopford, was then moved into the <i>Excellent</i>, from which in April 1800 he was promoted to command the <i>Niger</i>, armed <i>en fl&ucirc;te</i>, and sent out to the Mediterranean with troops. On 3 September 1800 he commanded the boats of the <i>Minotaur</i> and <i>Niger</i> in the cutting out of two Spanish corvettes at Barcelona; and in the following year, while on the coast of Egypt, served under Sir Sidney Smith in command of the armed boats on the lakes and the Nile.<br>
<br>Throughout 1803 Hillyar continued in active service, cruising under the orders of Nelson, who wrote to Lord St Vincent, on 20 January 1804, specially recommending him for promotion and immediate employment.<blockquote>At twenty-four years of age he maintained his mother and sisters and a brother, &hellip; he declined the <i>Ambuscade</i> which was offered him, because although he would get his rank, yet if he were put upon half-pay his family would be the sufferers. (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 651)</blockquote>The armament of the <i>Niger</i> was increased, and she was made a post ship, Hillyar being continued (29 February 1804) in the command, which he held, attached to the Mediterranean Fleet, until the end of 1807. In 1809 he commanded the <i>St George</i> (98 guns) as flag captain to Rear-Admiral Sir Eliab Harvey, and afterwards to Rear-Admiral Pickmore in the Baltic, where Sir James Saumarez appointed him to the <i>Phoebe</i>, a 36-gun frigate. In her, in the following spring, he went out to the East Indies, where he assisted in the capture of Mauritius (December 1810) and of Java (August 1811).<br>
<br>After returning to England, Hillyar was early in 1813 sent out to the Pacific to destroy the American fur establishments in the north. At Juan Fernandez, where he was joined by the sloops <i>Racoon</i> and <i>Cherub</i>, he heard that the United States frigate <i>Essex</i> (46 guns) was taking British merchantmen on that station. Having gone as far north as the Gal&aacute;pagos Islands, he sent the <i>Racoon</i> to execute his former orders; and, with the <i>Cherub</i> in company, ranged down the coast looking for the <i>Essex</i>. After five months' search he found her, at the beginning of February 1814, at Valpara&iacute;so, Chile, where she was lying with three prizes, one of which she had armed as a tender, renamed <i>Essex Junior</i>. David Porter, the captain of the <i>Essex</i>, expected an immediate attack; and, if Hillyar had found her, as he had been informed, with half her men on shore and quite unprepared, he might perhaps have closed with her. But as she was ready for action, he gave up any such intention and, allegedly, meeting Porter on shore assured him that he would respect the neutrality of the port. The story, however, rests on Porter's uncorroborated assertion, and is intrinsically improbable, for the <i>Essex's</i> armament of 32-pounder carronades was, at short range, enormously superior to the <i>Phoebe</i>'s long 18-pounders.<br>
<br>Nevertheless, the <i>Phoebe</i> and the <i>Cherub</i> maintained a blockade for six weeks; and after several vain attempts to elude it, Porter resolved on 27 March to force his way through, but he had scarcely got outside before, in a sudden squall, the <i>Essex</i> lost her main topmast. He tried to regain the anchorage but failing ran into a small bay about 3 miles from the town, and anchored within a few hundred yards of the shore. Under heavy fire and after sustaining significant damage, Porter surrendered. Hillyar was accused of a breach of faith, and of making an unfair attack on the <i>Essex</i>, though he had merely pressed home his advantage. The <i>Essex Junior</i> surrendered without resistance, and the <i>Essex</i>, having been sufficiently repaired, sailed in company with the <i>Phoebe</i> for England, where they arrived in the following November. Hillyar was made a CB in June 1815.<br>
<br>In 1830&#150;31 Hillyar commanded the <i>Revenge</i> (74 guns) in the experimental squadron under Sir Edward Codrington, and for a short time as senior officer in the North sea during the siege of Antwerp. He was then appointed to the <i>Caledonia</i> (120 guns) and employed on the coast of Portugal during 1832 and the beginning of the following year. On 10 January 1837 he became rear-admiral. He was made KCH in January 1834, and KCB on 4 July 1840.<br>
<br>Hillyar married on 14 July 1805 Mary (1787/8&#150;1884), a daughter of Nathaniel Taylor, naval storekeeper at Malta. They had three daughters and three sons, among whom were Admiral Sir Charles Farrell Hillyar (<i>d</i>. 1888) and Admiral Henry Shank Hillyar. Hillyar died at his home, Tor House, Torpoint, Cornwall, on 10 July 1843, and was buried on 15 July in the parish churchyard, Anthony, near Torpoint.<br>
