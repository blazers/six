<span class="headword">Pakenham, Sir  Francis John</span>  (1832&#150;1905), <span class="occ">diplomatist</span>, born on 29 February 1832 in London, was the fourth son of Thomas Pakenham, second earl of Longford, and his wife, Emma Charlotte, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17246/', "William Lygon, first Earl Beauchamp")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17245/', "Lygon, Frederick (1830&#150;1891)")</script>]. After private education he matriculated from Christ Church, Oxford, on 17 October 1849. On leaving the university he was appointed attach&eacute; at Lisbon in 1852, and was promoted paid attach&eacute; at Mexico two years later. He was transferred in 1858 to Copenhagen, and in 1863 to Vienna. In June 1864 he was promoted to secretary of legation at Buenos Aires. During April, May, and June of the following year he was employed on special service in Paraguay on board HMS <i>Dotterel</i>, which had been sent up the River Plate and its tributaries for the protection of British subjects during the war between Paraguay, Argentina, and Brazil. He acquitted himself of this duty to the entire satisfaction of his superiors. In August 1865 he was transferred to Rio de Janeiro, but remained in charge of the legation at Buenos Aires until December. In December 1866 he was employed on special service at Rio Grande do Sul in connection with an attempt that had been made on the life of the British consul, R. de Courcy Perry, from motives of personal revenge.<br>
<br>Pakenham was transferred to Stockholm in March 1868, and later in the same year to Brussels. From there he went to Washington, DC, in 1870, and to Copenhagen in 1874. In March 1878 he was promoted to minister-resident and consul-general at Santiago, where he remained until 1885, serving in 1883 as British commissioner for claims arising out of the war between Chile and Bolivia and Peru. In February 1885 he was appointed British envoy at Buenos Aires, with the additional office of minister-plenipotentiary to Paraguay. In February 1896 he was transferred to Stockholm, where he remained until his retirement from the service in 1902. He was made KCMG in 1898. In retirement he lived at Bernhurst House, Hurst Green, Sussex, which he inherited in 1858 by the will of Count Pierre Coquet de Tresseilles. Pakenham married on 29 July 1879 Caroline Matilda (<i>d</i>. 25 June 1938), seventh daughter of Henry Ward, rector of Killinchy, co. Down. They had no children. Travelling for reasons of health, Pakenham died in Alameda, California, on 26 January 1905.<br>
