<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Tuke,  Anthony William</span>  (1897&#150;1975), <span class="occ">banker</span>, was born on 24 February 1897 at Saffron Walden, Essex, the son of William Favill Tuke, a banker, and his wife, Eva Marian, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Nockolds. The Tukes were a Quaker family, originally from York, where they were prominent tea and cocoa merchants. Anthony's grandfather William Murray Tuke left this family business and joined his brother-in-law as a partner in the Saffron Walden and North Essex Bank, one of the banks that in 1896 formed Barclay &amp; Co. Ltd, for which William Murray Tuke served as a local director.<br>
<br>Tuke attended Winchester College, and throughout his life always valued the classical education he received there. During the First World War he served with the Cameronians (Scottish Rifles). In 1919 he married (Agnes) Edna Gannaway (<i>d</i>. 1966), with whom he shared a love of gardening and the arts, especially the theatre; they had three sons, two of whom predeceased him. He joined Barclays in the same year and rose rapidly through the senior positions, being appointed a local director at Luton in 1923, and a London-based general manager in 1931, working with successive chairmen, including his own father. In 1946 he was elected a vice-chairman, and in 1947 he was deputy chairman. In that capacity he worked with the chairman, Sir William Goodenough, whose manifold activities led to his death in 1951. Tuke succeeded him as chairman, a position he held until 1962.<br>
<br>Although shy and somewhat reserved, Tuke was dubbed the Iron Tuke by a financial journalist and the nickname stuck, reflecting both his reserved manner (which sprang from shyness) and his high standards. &#145;His directives were unambiguous and urgent, his memory infallible, and woe betide the careless or the dilatory in executing his instructions&#146;  (Lambert). He was the product of Barclays' decentralized structure, with the principal office-holders appointed largely from family members. He saw nothing wrong in this, provided that family entrants who did not prove satisfactory were quietly eased out of the bank, and that talented outsiders were not barred from promotion.<br>
<br>During Tuke's ten years as chairman bank lending was restricted by government and Bank of England pressures. Nevertheless by the time he retired Barclays had become the largest of the clearing banks. He presided over the beginnings of computerization, and in spite of restrictions the bank's deposits increased from just over &pound;300 million to &pound;3000 million. However, as he grew older he became more wary of innovation, being careful, for instance, to distance Barclays from the moral hazards of hire purchase, even while acquiring a quarter of United Dominions Trust, a major hire-purchase company. He saw Barclays as trustees of the national good and was ready to conform with Bank of England restrictions on lending, though very willing also to forge ahead with export guarantee loans when the signal was given.<br>
<br>In Tuke's view, as custodians of other people's money and providers of credit, and a formative influence in the economy, bankers had wide obligations, not only to their shareholders but also to society. Thus, in addition to committee membership and office-holding for the British Bankers' Association and the Bank Clerks Orphans fund, he served on the committee of the Historic Churches Preservation Trust. He was also a director of Yorkshire Insurance and of the Reinsurance Corporation, and was twice a fellow of Winchester College and in 1962 its warden.<br>
<br>Within Barclays, Tuke resigned his directorships of subsidiaries on becoming chairman, being advised by the board of Barclays not to take on as much as his predecessor had done. He wanted to see Barclays advance overseas, particularly in the Commonwealth, and as its chairman was rather surprised when his strategy of buying into Commonwealth banks was viewed with some suspicion, even hostility, by those increasingly nationalistic bodies. He had na&iuml;vely thought that he was doing them a favour: putting Barclays' name behind them. His pride in Barclays was also shown in his joint authorship of two histories of the bank: the <span class="italic">History of Barclays Bank Limited</span> (1926) and <span class="italic">Barclays Bank Limited, 1926&#150;1969</span> (1972), written after his retirement as chairman. The first is an invaluable (though not entirely accurate) record of the constituent partnerships from which Barclays was formed, and of its early years; the second, a briefer but more analytical account. After retirement as chairman, Tuke became a local director (in Southampton) again, for ten years. He also remained a main board director, his presence accepted with equanimity by John Thomson, his successor. Tuke died peacefully at his home, Freelands, Wherwell, near Andover, Hampshire, on 12 June 1975. His son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/75819/', "Sir Anthony Favill Tuke (1920&#150;2001)")</script>, also made a career with Barclays, serving as chairman from 1973 to 1981.<br>
