<span class="headword">Holte, Sir  Thomas</span>, first baronet  (1570/71&#150;1654), <span class="occ">landowner and royalist sympathizer</span>, was the eldest surviving son of Edward Holte (<i>d</i>. 1592) and his wife, Dorothy Ferrers (<i>d</i>. 1594). At the time of his birth the Holtes had been in possession of estates at Duddeston and Aston in Warwickshire for over a century. On 9 February 1588 Holte matriculated, aged seventeen, at Magdalen College, Oxford, but did not apparently graduate. He was, however, later described as &#145;a gentleman well read in most parts of learning, and versed in several languages&#146;  (Dugdale, 2.872). In 1590 he was admitted to the Inner Temple.<br>
<br>Succeeding his father upon the latter's death on 3 February 1592, Holte substantially increased the family estates through his marriage to Grace, daughter of William Bradburne of Hough, Derbyshire, perhaps in 1598 or 1599. In 1598 he bought the rectory of Aston and its appended properties for &pound;1870. The following year he served as sheriff of Warwickshire. On 18 April 1603 he was knighted by James I during his passage from Scotland to Westminster. In addition to his estates in Warwickshire, Holte acquired or rented a house in Islington, Middlesex, where he baptized a son, Richard, in 1604 and buried a daughter, Katherine, in 1605. In 1606 he was accused of brutally murdering a man employed by him as a cook. Neither he, nor anyone else, was brought to trial, and the victim has remained nameless. Yet the Victorian historian of the family of Holte reluctantly concluded that there is &#145;a very strong degree of probability&#146; that Sir Thomas was guilty of the killing, which took place at Duddeston, and reconstructed the likeliest sequence of events thus:<blockquote>Sir Thomas, when returning from hunting, in the course of conversation, laid a wager to some amount as to the punctuality of his cook, who most unfortunately, for once was behind time. Enraged at the jeers of his companions, he hastened into the kitchen, and seizing the first article at hand, avenged himself on his domestic. (Davidson, 24&#150;5)</blockquote>Holte afterwards reportedly sought to conceal the deed, and sued for slander William Ascrick or Ascherig of Birmingham, whom he charged with publicly claiming on 20 December 1605 that:<blockquote>Sir Thomas took a cleaver and hit his cook with the same cleaver upon the head and clave his head that one side there fell upon one of his shoulders and the other side on the other shoulder; and this I will verify to be true. (Davidson, 25)</blockquote>At the Warwick assizes in July 1608 Ascrick was found guilty and damages of &pound;30 were awarded against him. Ascrick fought back and launched an appeal in king's bench that autumn. There the judges found for him, concluding that, whatever the implication of his words, Ascrick had not actually directly accused Holte of murder but merely of splitting the cook's skull in two, and the man might have recovered from his wounds: &#145;it is not averred that the cook was killed, but argumentative slander ought to be direct &hellip; notwithstanding such wounding, the party may yet be living; and then it is but trespass. Wherefore it is adjudged for the defendant&#146;  (<span class="italic">Reports</span>, 184). By this device the court, faced with a dispute between two pillars of Warwickshire society, was able simultaneously to acquit Ascrick and avoid ruining Holte, who was himself a JP. The cook's failure to demonstrate the remarkable recuperative powers on which the eminent judges based their decision seems not to have caused any further legal difficulties for Holte (though it may explain why he took the precaution of obtaining a blanket pardon from Charles I in 1626 for offences committed in the previous reign). Local tradition had it that Holte was forced, in a symbolic punishment for his crime, to wear a blood-red hand on his coat of arms. The truth is less edifying. Holte was created a baronet on 25 November 1612 for the standard price of &pound;1095, a sum supposedly intended towards the defence of Ulster; all baronets, accordingly, wore the red hand of Ulster on their shields. The emblem was a badge of honour, not of shame.<br>
<br>Holte prospered exceedingly and his income has been estimated as in excess of &pound;1000 per annum. In 1618 he began the building of Aston Hall. The architect John Thorpe had a hand in the elaborate design of a house which &#145;for beauty and state much exceedeth any in these parts&#146;  (Dugdale, 2.872); the building was occupied in 1631 but was not completed until four years later. The portrait of Holte which survives at Aston Hall duly portrays him the lord of his domain, in the deer park created out of enclosed open fields in 1621, with the house in the background. Holte continued to act as a JP in his local division, served as a subsidy commissioner in the 1620s, and was a commissioner for the distraint of knighthood in Hemlingford hundred in 1630&#150;32. He served as a deputy lieutenant in 1638&#150;9. In religion he was a moderate Calvinist.<br>
<br>Holte's marriage to Grace Bradburne produced fifteen children, of whom only a daughter, Grace (<i>d</i>. 1677), who married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25478/', "Sir Richard Shuckburgh")</script>, survived him. After the death of his first wife Holte married Anne (<i>d</i>. 1697), daughter of Sir Edward Littleton of Pillaton Hall, Staffordshire; they had no children. In his dealings with his eldest son Holte acted the part of an implacable patriarch. When Edward (1600&#150;1643) fell in love with Elizabeth King, the daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15568/', "John King (d. 1621)")</script>, bishop of London, Holte forbade the match, and when the couple married anyway, he threatened to disinherit Edward. It took the intervention of Charles I to make Holte withdraw his threat: in August 1627 the king wrote to Holte urging, &#145;The interest we have in all our subjects, and especially the families of the best quality, giveth us cause to interfere in this, while a severe proceeding against your son would endanger the overthrow of your house&#146;  (Colville, 424). Charles further promised to make provision for Edward if his father provided poorly for him, and it is reported that he later kept his word by appointing the young man as a groom of his bedchamber. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15564/', "Henry King")</script>, Elizabeth's brother, recalled in 1653 that &#145;the unnatural usage of an implacable father denied them competent means whereby they might subsist&#146;  (Davidson, 22). Typically Holte proved able to have the last word by outliving his heir. Edward was wounded at the battle of Edgehill and, though he recovered sufficiently to take part in the defence of Oxford, he died there of a fever on 28 August 1643. Sir Thomas, in his will of 1650, left not a penny to the widow. He was somewhat more mellow towards his granddaughter Katherine, to whom he left &pound;300, &#145;although she hath undone herself by her marriage without consent which her husband shall have nothing to do with&#146;  (Hughes, 38).<br>
<br>At the outbreak of the civil war Holte himself was at first uncommitted in the struggle for allegiance in the west midlands between the parliamentarian Lord Brooke and the royalist earl of Northampton in the summer of 1642. By late August, however, he was reported to have joined other royalists at Lichfield. In mid-October, just before the battle of Edgehill, the king stayed at Aston Hall for two days. On 12 December 1643, at Holte's request, a royalist garrison was put into the house; on 28 December it fell to an overwhelming parliamentarian force.<br>
<br>Holte was sequestered by the county committee but discharged by the Lords and Commons in December 1646. The following March, however, he was threatened with renewed sequestration and in October 1648 this was put into effect. In 1650 Holte applied to compound for his sequestered properties, pleading that &#145;having had houses in Birmingham worth &pound;1000 burned by the king's horses, all his goods taken, so that he had neither a bed nor a shirt left, to the loss of &pound;6000 and being 80 years old his fine may be set at 1/10th&#146;  (Green, 4.2556&#150;7). The committee for compounding were perhaps aware that in 1647 the bedless and shirtless Holte had acquired from Viscount Hereford the manor of Erdington, Warwickshire. On 3 February 1652 his fine was set at &pound;4492 2<i>s</i>. 4<i>d</i>., which was paid within three weeks and the estate discharged. Holte died in mid-November 1654 but was not buried until 14 December at Aston. By his will he assigned &pound;300 for the building and endowment of an almshouse at Aston for the maintenance of ten aged poor, five of each sex. He also provided for a monument to the memory of himself and his second wife in Aston church. His baronetcy and the bulk of his estate passed to Edward's eldest son, Robert.<br>
