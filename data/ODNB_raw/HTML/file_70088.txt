<span class="headword">Warburton,  Mabel Clarisse</span>  (1879&#150;1961), <span class="occ">missionary and educationist</span>, was born on 22 June 1879 at Kings Langley, Hemel Hempstead, Hertfordshire, the second of two children of Thomas Frederick Warburton and his wife, Mabel Catherine Harries (<i>d</i>. 1879). Her father was already deceased, and her mother did not survive the birth, so Warburton was raised by her grandmother Mrs Harries, at Bradwell House near Wolverton, Buckinghamshire. Her brother was declared insane and died at an institution.<br>
<br>Mabel Warburton attended Cheltenham Ladies' College from 1895 to 1897, and was greatly inspired by its famous principal and pioneer of women's education, Dorothea Beale. Like Beale, Warburton was profoundly religious in the moderate Church of England mould. A combination of religious conviction, sense of service, and pioneering role for women's education led Warburton, who never married, to join the British Syrian Mission. At the age of twenty-two, after a period in Egypt, Warburton was appointed headmistress of the British Syrian Training College at Beirut, a position she held until the First World War broke out in 1914.<br>
<br>In January 1918, after the British occupation of Jerusalem, Mabel Warburton was one of the first British women to be allowed into Palestine to engage in rescue work. In co-operation with several Anglican mission organizations Warburton founded and partly financed a high school and college for girls, the Jerusalem Girls' College, where she was principal from 1919 to 1926. The institution, which was open to both Arab and Jewish pupils, offered a liberal, English education and high academic standards, including a teacher's training course, for girls from the middle and upper class.<br>
<br>The Anglican schools in Palestine were known as centres of ethnic and religious reconciliation, and the Jerusalem Girls' College stressed tolerance and peaceful co-existence between the Christian, Muslim, and Jewish pupils. The institution was a success not only academically, but also as non-nationalistic alternative in a society characterized by increasingly nationalistic antagonism. Warburton continued to support the college financially until it was forced to close down in 1948, when the British mandate came to an end.<br>
<br>Mabel Warburton, who modernized the traditional missionary role, insisting on academically trained teachers as well as equal treatment of Arab and European staff members, was described by a colleague as:<blockquote>a very cheerful, extrovert woman, deeply religious, friendly to everybody, She had a fat and rather ugly fox terrier called Jim, who always accompanied her on long country walks around Jerusalem. She spoke Arabic well, and never seemed to be conscious of difference in race or national outlook. (Emery MSS, 2/4, 122)</blockquote>While the Middle East and especially the Holy Land had a long tradition of educated, middle-class British women engaging in missionary and educational work, Mabel Warburton played a much more pioneering role. According to the Anglican bishop in Jerusalem, W. H. Stewart, Warburton had the qualifications, the vision, and the gifts of &#145;a missionary and educational statesman&#146;  (<span class="italic">Bible Lands</span>, January 1962). Her talents as organizer and educationist within the Anglican church were given a wide range in the period from 1926 until the 1950s.<br>
<br>From 1926 until 1935 Warburton was active in social work in St Hilda's Settlement, Bethnal Green, London, where she was &#145;one of the most inspiring and beloved workers&#146;  (Beauman, 91). At the same time she held the post as assistant secretary to the missionary council of the church assembly. This work was to give her a unique insight into the policy of the church as a whole&#151;travelling extensively in Egypt, Sudan, Uganda, Palestine, and Persia&#151;and also of the missionary societies whose headquarters were in London.<br>
<br>In 1934 Warburton became educational adviser for the Anglican church in the Middle East, and as secretary of a new diocesan board of education she was given a key role in reviewing and planning Christian education in the Middle East. In her survey of education in Palestine, published in 1937, Warburton's vision of Christian schools was explicitly stated as:<blockquote>to implant in the pupils, the future leaders of the country, Moslem, Jew and Christian, that width of outlook, balance of mind, and sensibility to the claims of others, which will help to build up a better understanding between the peoples of the Holy Land. (Jerusalem and East Mission archives, XXXVII/5)</blockquote>After the Second World War Warburton established the Ahliyyah School for Girls in Amman. However, her base continued to be the home she had built for herself in the 1920s, Welcome Cottage in Waltham Abbey, Essex, which was not only a private retreat, but open for parties from Bethnal Green. During this period Warburton was educational and political counsellor of missionary societies and overseas bishops, a role that led to much travel. In recognition of her work she was appointed MBE. She resigned the last of her church-related advisory posts in 1957. Mabel Warburton died of cancer on 16 November 1961 at the War Memorial Hospital, Waltham Abbey.<br>
