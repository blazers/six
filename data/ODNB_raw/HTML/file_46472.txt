<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Merlin,  John Joseph</span>  (1735&#150;1803), <span class="occ">inventor</span>, was born or baptized, or possibly both born and baptized, on 17 September 1735 at Huy, Southern Netherlands, into a family who were probably inventors. He was the third child of Maximilien Joseph Merlin (born at Cambrai, 8 January 1710) and Marie-Anne Levasseur.<br>
<br>By about 1754 he was working in Paris, gaining for himself a reputation for mechanical ability. In 1760 he came to England in the suite of the Spanish ambassador, the conde de Fuentes, and lived in Soho Square, London.<br>
<br>By 1763 Merlin had left the service of Fuentes and was living, and most probably working (for a goldsmith named Sutton), in New Street, Covent Garden. Shortly afterwards he moved to work at Cox's Museum in Spring Gardens, becoming &#145;the first or principal mechanic&#146;  (<span class="italic">Kirby's &hellip; Museum</span>, 274). The museum housed a collection of large automata which had a profound influence on Merlin, but realizing that the museum was financially unstable, Merlin decided in 1773 to set up on his own as a maker of mathematical instruments. In the same year Merlin designed and patented a dutch oven (not unlike a present-day rotisserie) and in the following year he patented a down-striking piano action which could be fitted to a harpsichord, enabling the player, by the operation of a foot pedal, to use the instrument as either a piano or a harpsichord. A second pedal allowed the player to produce a crescendo or decrescendo when using the harpsichord alone by slowly bringing on the unison and octave registers, or on release of the pedal, removing first the octave register and then the two unisons. In 1780 Merlin built a single-manual harpsichord to which his down-striking piano action was fitted, thereby making it a compound instrument. It has the unusual specification of one 16 ft register, two 8 ft registers, and one 4 ft register. It also incorporates an ingenious recording device: as the performance proceeds, pencils attached to trackers make marks on a roll of paper attached to a clockwork rotating drum. Though innovative, the system was never likely to succeed because the marks on the paper had subsequently to be deciphered and converted to standard musical notation.<br>
<br>Merlin's other inventions included extending the compass of the piano (at the suggestion of his friend Dr Charles Burney) and combining the square piano with an organ (making the square claviorganum). He popularized roller skates (most probably invented in Holland about 1700), and is immortalized in a passage in Busby's <span class="italic">Concert Room and Orchestra Anecdotes</span>:<blockquote>One of his ingenious novelties was a pair of skaites &hellip; Supplied with a pair of these and a violin he mixed in the motley group of one of the celebrated Mrs. Corneily's masquerades at Carlisle House, Soho Square; when, not having provided the means of retarding his velocity, or commanding its direction, he impelled himself against a mirror of more than five hundred pounds value, dashed it to atoms, broke his instrument to pieces and wounded himself most severely. (Busby, 2.137)</blockquote>He also invented the forerunner of the present-day wheelchair, a form of scales for weighing human beings, a number of specialized watches and clocks, and a small portable scale for weighing gold coinage. Among his more bizarre inventions were a rotating table which enabled a hostess to fill up to twelve cups of tea without leaving her place, and a device to enable blind persons to play cards. All of these were to be seen at Merlin's Mechanical Museum, near Hanover Square, a popular place of entertainment for London society, with whom, despite his incomplete Anglicization, Merlin was much in demand. He never married, but was highly thought of, as witnesses his obituary in the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span>, which reported that &#145;he hardly ever let a moment slip by unemployed&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 1st ser., 73/1, 1803, 485). He died in London on 4 May 1803, and left his property to his two brothers and a sister, all of whom lived abroad.<br>
