<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Browse,  Lillian Gertrude</span>  (1906&#150;2005), <span class="occ">art dealer and art historian</span>, was born at 2 Carlton Mansions, West End Lane, Hampstead, London, on 21 April 1906, the younger child of Michael Browse, entrepreneur, champion cyclist, and son of a Jewish White Russian &eacute;migr&eacute; who had settled in southern Africa, and his wife, Gladys Amy, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Meredith, a member of a large, close-knit, well-established Anglo-Jewish family. She was originally named Lily Gertie, but later adopted first Gertrude then Lillian. Aged three, she, her elder brother, Jack (<i>b</i>. 1904), and their mother emigrated to Johannesburg to rejoin their father, who had established himself as a racehorse trainer in the Transvaal. She was educated at Barnato Park High School, Johannesburg. She returned to London in 1928 to train under Margaret Craske at the Cecchetti Ballet School.<br>
<br>In 1930, on tour with Anton Dolin's company to Amsterdam, Browse realized she would never be pre-eminent as a dancer. The following year, despite knowing nothing of the fine arts, she persuaded Harold Leger to take her on, unpaid, to file old master photographs in his Bond Street gallery. Over the next eight years she trained her eye, became familiar with the auction rooms, learned the essential skills of a cataloguer, absorbed the financial and negotiating skills of the commercial art world, and engaged deeply with the work of nineteenth- and twentieth-century French and British artists. In due course Leger made her manager of the gallery and allowed her to mount a series of adventurous one-man shows, as well as mixed thematic shows of contemporary work. On 3 September 1934 she married, in the Liberal Jewish synagogue at St John's Wood, her first cousin Ivan Harold Joseph. Four years her junior, he was a businessman then working as a depot inspector for a catering company, and the son of Walter Gordon Joseph, company secretary for a builders' merchants. They had little in common, and the marriage did not survive. They separated, but did not formally divorce until 1944.<br>
<br>On the outbreak of the Second World War, Browse joined the London ambulance service. However, her unique wartime contribution was to persuade Kenneth Clark, director of the National Gallery, to let her organize exhibitions of contemporary British art to cover the bare walls of his gallery in place of the old masters removed to Wales for safe keeping. In 1940 she mounted &#145;British painting since Whistler&#146; and &#145;Drawings of Augustus John&#146;; in 1941 the first major, non-commercial Walter Sickert retrospective; in 1942 a two-man show of William Nicholson and Jack Yeats. She scoured the country gaining the trust and friendship of private owners and museum curators, and assembling an unrivalled personal archive of work by early twentieth-century British artists. She thus established the bedrock of her future attainments as dealer and scholar. In 1941 she initiated her career as an author by bringing together, in <span class="italic">The Drawings of Augustus John</span>, illustrations of the works she had collected for the 1940 exhibition. 1943 saw the publication of her first volume on Sickert, which included a fine selection of his works with informative catalogue notes.<br>
<br>At the end of the war, together with Henry Roland and Gustav Delbanco, Browse became a founding partner of Roland, Browse, and Delbanco at 19 Cork Street, London. The firm held a succession of well-chosen and well-researched exhibitions, many featuring Browse's favourite artists. In 1946 she became general editor of <span class="roman">Ariel Books on the Arts</span>, overseeing publication of slim volumes on Constantin Guys, James Dickson Innes, Barbara Hepworth, Lesley Hurry, and Eric Ravilious.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">Degas Dancers</span>, published in 1949, brought together Browse's twin passions, dance and art. Widely reviewed and praised, this book led to her appointment from 1950 to 1954 as ballet critic of <span class="italic">The Spectator</span>. A catalogue raisonn&eacute; of paintings by William Nicholson followed in 1956. 1960 saw the summit of her achievement as a Sickert scholar. She selected the Arts Council centenary retrospective and her second, substantial, monograph on Sickert was published. The essence of her achievement as a scholar rested in the combination of individual discrimination and scrupulous research. She trusted her eye.<br>
<br>Browse's second marriage, at the Westminster register office on 17 June 1964, to Sidney Henry Lines (1912&#150;2000), was full and happy. The son of Sidney Augustus Lines, a buyer of oriental goods, he was a widower six years her junior, and a director of Wiggins Teape. They entertained their wide circle of friends in London and indulged their enthusiasm for gardening both in London and at their cottage in Petworth. Although childless, Browse had a clutch of godchildren, several the progeny of theatrical families.<br>
<br>In 1977 Roland and Delbanco retired from their gallery, to be replaced by William Darby. After four years Browse withdrew all but her name and goodwill from the business. In 1978 she published her last monograph, <span class="italic">Forain, the Painter</span>, and in 1999 her autobiography, <span class="italic">Duchess of Cork Street</span>. This sobriquet, bestowed by Rex Nan Kivell, director of the Redfern Gallery next door in Cork Street, alluded to her dignity and astounding elegance. She made many of her own clothes, favouring an Edwardian look with high ruffled necks. She always wore fabulous hats. Her gracious entry into the auction rooms, to take her reserved seat in the front row, held all in thrall.<br>
<br>In 1982, honouring a promise she had made to Anthony Blunt some twenty years earlier, Browse gave much of her private collection of paintings, drawings, and sculpture to the Courtauld Institute of Art. She later bequeathed an important Degas sculpture, <span class="italic">Pr&eacute;paration &agrave; la danse</span>, to the Courtauld, and a few of her favourite pictures to the Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge. Her many contributions to the visual arts were recognized in 1998 when she was appointed CBE. She died at her home, 29 Bloomfield Terrace, Westminster, of pneumonia on 2 December 2005, less than five months short of her hundredth birthday. She was cremated at Putney Vale cemetery on 15 December. A memorial exhibition was held at Browse and Darby in November 2006.<br>
