<span class="headword">Butler,  James</span>, third earl of Ormond  (<em>c.</em>1360&#150;1405), <span class="occ">magnate and justiciar of Ireland</span>, was the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/4186/', "James Butler, second earl of Ormond (1331&#150;1382)")</script>, and Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1390), daughter of Sir John Darcy. He was about twenty-three when he was granted custody of his lands on 2 March 1383. As head of a great lordship centred on Tipperary and Kilkenny, Ormond played a key role in Anglo-Irish affairs. He was justiciar in 1384&#150;5, 1394&#150;5, and in 1404. Richard II clearly regarded him as the premier Irish earl when he appointed him as justiciar during his first expedition to Ireland. The Irish annalists readily acknowledged him as &#145;head of the chivalry of Ireland&#146; at his death.<br>
<br>This leadership did not go unchallenged. Like his father, Ormond became embroiled in a lifelong struggle against his neighbours and tenants, the earls of Desmond, notwithstanding the fact that Gerald fitz Maurice Fitzgerald, third earl of Desmond (<i>d</i>. 1398), was married to his sister Eleanor and was father of Katherine of Desmond, who bore Ormond four sons out of wedlock. In October 1384 the king's lieutenant established a high-ranking commission to treat for peace between Desmond and Ormond. One of the members of the commission, the earl of Kildare, was ordered to intervene again in March 1387. In 1396 Ormond's brother Thomas was killed by John Fitzgerald, son of the earl of Desmond, in a dispute in Waterford. Peace was eventually restored when Desmond agreed to forfeit 800 marks to the earl of Ormond for the death of Thomas. War broke out again in 1399 when, shortly after the arrival of King Richard's second expedition, some English magnates (apparently at Ormond's instigation) captured the Desmond castle of Dungarvan, devastating the surrounding region. In response John Fitzgerald, now earl of Desmond, ravaged the barony of Cahir. Peace was re-established when the earls with their opposing armies met near the monastery of Inishlounaght (Tipperary). Desmond was drowned some days later (11 October) crossing the River Suir.<br>
<br>Ormond restored the fortunes of the family lordship, diminished by territorial losses suffered at the hands of the renascent Irish. He secured his borders through marriage alliances with Tadhg &Oacute; Cearbhaill, lord of Ely (&Eacute;ile), and with the Burkes of Clanricarde (1401). An indenture between the earl and the &Oacute; Braon&aacute;in family of Odogh (1401) provided for the adjudication of frontier disputes in time of peace. Doubtless similar political and military indentures with Irish and Gaelicized Anglo-Norman lords, since lost, extended the earl's influence well beyond his borders. No less significant was the purchase of the Despenser purparty in Kilkenny in 1391, making the Butlers undisputed lords of the strategic Barrow&#150;Nore&#150;Suir basin.<br>
<br>Richard's choice of Ormond as justiciar in Ireland on 24 July 1394, before his own arrival there in October, must be seen in this context. Besides being a fluent Irish speaker, Ormond's network of alliances with Irish and Gaelicized Anglo-Norman lords was a decisive factor in inducing them to submit to the king.<br>
<br>Ormond married Anne (<i>fl</i>. 1386&#150;1397), daughter of John Welles, before 17 June 1386; to her <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/4187/', "James Butler, fourth earl of Ormond (the White Earl)")</script>, was born. A younger son, Richard, was ancestor of Piers Butler, eighth earl of Ormond. Another son, Thomas Butler, prior of Kilmainham, may have been illegitimate. Ormond had in addition four sons&#151;James, ancestor of the Butlers of Cahir, Edmund, Gerald, and Theobald&#151;with Katherine of Desmond. Later tradition, emanating from sources sympathetic to Piers Butler, eighth earl of Ormond, suspected Katherine of incestuous relations with her own brother and of attempting to poison the countess of Ormond together with her children. In December 1399 Katherine offered to surrender &pound;200 granted to her by Ormond if he were successful in securing in Rome a dispensation for their marriage. A curious agreement (18 January 1399) between the earl and the bishop of Cloyne, who undertook among other things to act as the earl's agent in the Roman curia, may represent the opening moves in a legal campaign to clear the way for a marriage that, in the event, never took place. Ormond died on 6 September 1405 and was buried at St Mary's Church, Gowran, Kilkenny.<br>
