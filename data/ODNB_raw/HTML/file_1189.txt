<span class="headword">Balfour, Sir  James, of Denmiln and Kinnaird</span>, first baronet  (1600&#150;1657), <span class="occ">antiquary and herald</span>, was probably born at Denmiln, Fife, the son of Sir Michael Balfour of Denmiln (<i>c</i>.1580&#150;1652), later MP for Fife and comptroller of the household to Charles I, and his wife, Jane or Joanna (<i>d</i>. 1640), daughter of Sir James Durham of Pitkerro. His youngest brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1182/', "Andrew Balfour, later first baronet")</script>, became a noted botanist and antiquary. He was educated at home and entered St Andrews University in 1610, graduating MA in 1614. He was then sent to travel on the continent as a young man, for an unknown period of time.<br>
<br>On his return some time before 1626 Balfour began to interest himself in literary pursuits. His first interest was poetry, and he translated the <span class="italic">Panthea</span> of Johannes Leochaeus, or John Leech, into Scots verse; Leech himself praised Balfour's learning in a poem of 1626. However, the age was one in which many Scots undertook research into the national past, and Balfour soon turned to the study of Scottish history and antiquities. He was particularly interested in heraldry, and to further his knowledge of this subject he went to London in 1628. Here he attached himself to Sir William Segar, Garter king at arms, and became acquainted with antiquarians Roger Dodsworth and Sir William Dugdale, and was awarded the title of herald on 4 December 1628. He later contributed a short account of Scottish religious houses entitled &#145;Coenobia Scotica&#146; to Dugdale's <span class="italic">Monasticum Anglicanum</span>. His chief patron was George Hay, earl of Kinnoul and chancellor of Scotland, by whose influence Balfour was created Lyon king at arms by Charles I as replacement to Sir Jerome Lyndsay of Annatland; he was crowned as Lyon by Kinnoul on 15 June 1630. He also received other marks of favour from King Charles. He was knighted on 7 May 1630, and on 9 January 1631 he was granted the lands and barony of Kinnaird in Fife by royal charter. He seems, however, to have been in possession of these lands before the grant, because some Latin verses addressed to him by Leech in 1626 already refer to him as <i>Kinardius</i>. He was created a baronet by the king on 22 December 1633, and granted 16,000 acres of land in Nova Scotia, of which, however, he appears never to have taken possession.<br>
<br>Although a staunch presbyterian, Balfour was a firm supporter of King Charles, and was frequently at court while the king still held effective power. When the civil war began, he was naturally regarded with suspicion by the party hostile to the king, and to avoid being embroiled in conflict he retired to his Scottish estates, to which he had succeeded on his father's death on 14 February 1652. Here he pursued his antiquarian studies, mostly at Kinnaird. He continued to perform the duties of Lyon king at arms until he was deprived of the office by Cromwell in 1654.<br>
<br>Balfour was four times married. His first wife was Anne, daughter of Sir John Ayton of Ayton, whom he married on 21 October 1630. She died on 26 August 1644. He next married Jean, daughter of Sir James Durham of Pitkerro, who died shortly after the marriage, on 19 July 1645. His third wife was Margaret, daughter of Sir James Arnot of Ferney, who died on 15 December 1653, aged only twenty-five. His fourth and last marriage was to Janet, daughter of Sir William Auchinleck of Balmano, in June 1654. She may have outlived him. By these marriages Balfour had six sons and twelve daughters, many of whom died young.<br>
<br>In the pursuit of his antiquarian interests, Balfour maintained a literary correspondence with Dugdale and Dodsworth, as well as other leading figures in the field, including David Buchanan, Sir Robert Gordon of Straloch, Robert Maule, Henry Maule of Melgum, and William Drummond of Hawthornden. He produced a number of original works, only one of which, the <span class="italic">Annals of the History of Scotland from Malcolm III to Charles II</span>, has ever been published (in 1824&#150;5, edited by James Haig). This was compiled with great care with regard to proper names, titles, and offices, taken from original manuscripts, and a painstaking consideration for the accuracy of dates. As the title implies, however, it is not a history proper, but a chronological list of historical events, with no sustained narrative, and may have been a collection of materials made for the composition of a full history of Scotland. Some of Balfour's manuscript treatises are still preserved in the Advocates' Library in the National Library of Scotland, but many others were dispersed among his friends, and some were destroyed during the English capture of Perth, where he had sent them. The subjects of his treatises were mainly heraldic, but he also wrote on Scottish officers of state, princely revenues, the archbishops of St Andrews, gemstones, the coronation of Charles I, funeral ceremonies, the genealogy of Scottish earls to 1647, and the geography of the Fife coastline.<br>
<br>Balfour was also a diligent collector of manuscripts and related materials, and it is due to him that much material was preserved which might have been lost in the dispersion of Scotland's monastic libraries. These included many chronicles, registers of Scottish religious houses and bishoprics, the cartularies of Dunfermline, Dryburgh, Arbroath, and Aberdeen, and the registers of the priory of St Andrews and the monastery of Cupar. He amassed, at great expense, a large and valuable library of books dealing with Scottish history, antiquities, and heraldry. This and his manuscript collection are thought to have passed to his brother, Andrew, after Sir James's death and were sold at two auctions in 1698 and 1699, the manuscripts being acquired by the Faculty of Advocates.<br>
<br>Balfour died in Fife on 14 February 1657, and was buried in Abdie church in Fife. He was succeeded in the baronetcy by Robert Balfour, his eldest surviving son and heir by his third marriage.<br>
