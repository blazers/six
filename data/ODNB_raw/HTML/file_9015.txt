<span class="headword">Ewer,  Isaac</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1650/51), <span class="occ">army officer and regicide</span>, was a close relation and possibly son of Richard Ewer of Hatfield Broad Oak, Essex, and may have been related to the Ewers of Pinner, Middlesex, and Cheshunt, Hertfordshire. He was living at Hatfield by 1633, having by that year married Joan (<i>d</i>. in or before 1649), daughter of Thomas Thurloe, rector of Abbot's Roding, Essex, and sister of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27405/', "John Thurloe (bap. 1616, d. 1668)")</script>, later Cromwell's secretary of state. Ewer's assessment for 9<i>s</i>. of ship money and post as a surveyor of highways for Hatfield in 1636 suggests he was of middling sort status. After joining parliament's army some time after the outbreak of civil war, he captained a troop of horse by 1643. In March 1645 he was major of the dragoons in the eastern association. Later that year he was appointed lieutenant-colonel to Robert Hammond's foot regiment in the New Model Army, succeeding Hammond as colonel in October 1647. In February 1648 he was granted a coat of arms, recognizing his rising status.<br>
<br>At The Garter inn in Windsor on 20 April 1648 Ewer was overheard plotting with other officers to threaten to disarm the city of London and extract &pound;1 million in order to wage war on their enemies. During the second civil war, his regiment was at first employed in south Wales and was then left by Cromwell to besiege Chepstow Castle. Ewer took Chepstow on 25 May 1648, killing the governor, Sir Nicholas Kemish, and his subsequent report earned him parliament's thanks. The regiment was then ordered to Essex, where Ewer was one of the commissioners who signed the articles for the surrender of Colchester and was presumably a member of the council of war that condemned Lucas and Lisle. Soon after he was appointed governor of Portsmouth and on 20 November 1648 headed the deputation which presented the army's remonstrance against the treaty with the king to the House of Commons.<br>
<br>With the army resolved to bring the king to trial, Ewer was ordered to convey Charles's then custodian, the doubting Hammond, from the Isle of Wight, where he arrived on 26 November 1648; he was eventually forced to arrest his former colonel, leaving his subordinates to remove the king to Hurst Castle. Appointed one of the king's judges, Ewer attended the high court every day and signed the death warrant [<i>see also </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/70599/', "Regicides")</script>]. He later recounted a story that Cromwell and Henry Marten playfully splashed each other's faces with ink after the warrant was signed.<br>
<br>Ewer's foot regiment was selected by lot for Ireland on 20 April 1649, prompting him to draw up his will on 1 August, &#145;not knoweinge whether God maie ever bring mee backe againe&#146;  (PROB 11/215, fol. 149<i>v</i>). His regiment distinguished itself at Drogheda, and on 26 March 1650 Ewer was instrumental in Cromwell's capture of Kilkenny. He was at Clonmel on 9 May, and served under Ireton at Waterford, which fell on 6 August. He is last heard of marching towards Kilkenny on 31 October 1650; he died of plague in Ireland in either the final months of 1650 or in the first two months of the new year, and was buried at Waterford. His will was proved on 25 February 1651 by John Thurloe, who became guardian to his children.<br>
