<span class="headword">Nye,  Nathaniel</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1624), <span class="occ">mathematician and master gunner</span>, was baptized at St Martin's, Birmingham, on 18 April 1624, the son of Allen Nye. A list of governors of King Edward VI's School, Birmingham, for 1638 includes an Allen Nye, who may have been Nathaniel's father. Nathaniel Nye wrote <span class="italic">A New Almanacke and Prognostication</span> for 1642; <span class="italic">A Prognostication</span> and <span class="italic">A New Almanacke and Prognostication</span> for 1643, calculated for &#145;the fair and populous Town of Birmicham&#146;, in which he describes himself as &#145;Mathematitian, Practitioner of Astronomy&#146;; and two almanacs for 1645.<br>
<br>Against the background of Birmingham's arms trades in the civil war, Nye developed an interest in gunnery. In 1643 he tested a Birmingham cannon, and he described an experiment with a saker which he carried out in the Deritend area of the town in March 1645. Following the parliamentarian capture of Evesham in May 1645 Nye held the post of master gunner to the garrison there, and he directed the artillery at the siege of Worcester, from May to July 1646. He then served with the parliamentarian garrison of the city, for he was described as &#145;Master Gunner of the City of Worcester&#146; on the title page of his book, <span class="italic">The Art of Gunnery</span>, published in 1647. Nye's avowed intention in writing the book was to restore the reputation of gunners, which had suffered through the appointment of men because of their connections rather than their ability. Arguing that it was as easy to fire a piece of ordnance as a musket, he provided a detailed practical guide to the preparation and employment of artillery, stressing the importance of arithmetic and geometry. The book's second section, with a separate title page, is entitled &#145;A treatise of artificiall fire-works for warre and recreation&#146;, and includes information on treatments for gunpowder burns. While pointing out that the book was written from his own experiences, he also acknowledged his debt to earlier writers on the use of artillery and preparation of fireworks: William Bourne, John Bate, John Babington, Robert Norton, Niccol&ograve; Tartaglia, and Thomas Malthus. The works on arithmetic to which he refers the reader include those by Robert Recorde and Marcus Jordanus.<br>
<br>Nye also had a practical interest in cartography, and recommended that a gunner should have a map of the environs of his garrison that marked all prominent features within range of the defences. He had copies of such plans for Worcester and Coventry, although they are not included in the book. While he does not state that they were prepared by him, that is implied.<br>
<br>Despite his service with the parliamentarian forces, Nye dedicated <span class="italic">The Art of Gunnery</span> to the prominent royalist and member of the king's household Montague Bertie, second earl of Lindsey. In the dedication he mentions &#145;the particular service I ever did owe and beare to your Lordship and Noble Family&#146;, although the nature of the connection is unknown. Further editions appeared in 1648 and 1670. The frontispiece is a portrait of Nye by Wenceslaus Hollar, drawn in 1644. Nothing is known of Nye's life after 1647.<br>
