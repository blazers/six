<span class="headword">Caryll,  Ivan</span> <span class="st"> [<em>real name </em>F&eacute;lix Tilkin]</span>  (1861&#150;1921), <span class="occ">composer and music director</span>, was born on 12 May 1861 in Li&egrave;ge, Belgium, the son of Henry Tilkin, an engineer. He was educated at the Paris Conservatoire and settled in Britain in the mid-1880s. His earliest days in London were spent largely in musical hack work and teaching, and although he had a comic opera, <span class="italic">The Lily of L&eacute;oville</span>, produced in London as early as 1886, it was as a conductor that he made his first noticeable mark in the musical theatre. When Henry J. Leslie bought the Gaiety Theatre production of <span class="italic">Dorothy</span> and transferred it to the Prince of Wales, the Gaiety's music director, Meyer Lutz, remained at his own theatre, and Caryll was appointed conductor for the revamped show which was to become the musical-theatre hit of the era. He remained Leslie's music director through the four years and three shows of the producer's dramatic career, shifting with him to his new Lyric Theatre on Shaftesbury Avenue, where <span class="italic">Doris</span> and <span class="italic">The Red Hussar</span> were produced, and staying there, when Leslie's operation went under, as music director for the theatre's new manager, Horace Sedger.<br>
<br>Caryll subsequently supplied part-scores for local adaptations of several French musicals and completed the score for the late Alfred Cellier's <span class="italic">The Mountebanks</span>, before he got the opportunity to write the complete music for the latter-day burlesque <span class="italic">Little Christopher Columbus</span>, built around the under-voiced American starlet May Yoh&eacute; and backed by her lordly lover, Francis Hope. It featured two songs&#151;the &#145;coon&#146; song &#145;Oh Honey, my Honey&#146; and the ballad &#145;Lazily, Drowsily&#146;&#151;which took Caryll straight to the fore of the musical-theatre profession.<br>
<br>The young musician was soon snapped up by the watchful George Edwardes for the Gaiety Theatre, where he remained as music director for fifteen years, supplying the music for all the great hits of that theatre's most prosperous period, from <span class="italic">The Shop Girl</span> (1894) through to <span class="italic">Our Miss Gibbs</span> (1909). Under Edwardes's aegis a writing partnership between Caryll and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/39395/', "Lionel Monckton (1861&#150;1924)")</script> evolved, beginning with Monckton as the subsidiary &#145;additional songs&#146; member, but later on equal terms, with both turning out much of the best of the light theatre music on the London stage in its most successful Victorian and Edwardian years.<br>
<br>Caryll did not confine himself in those years to writing for the Gaiety. In the early years of the new century he turned out a bevy of scores, both in the musical-comedy style, notably the charming <span class="italic">The Girl from Kay's</span> (1902), and in the light opera vein, with <span class="italic">The Duchess of Dantzic</span>, a score which echoed the most attractive tones of French <i>op&eacute;ra comique</i>. <span class="italic">The Earl and the Girl</span>, written with Seymour Hicks and staged with the remnants of the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company, was another of Caryll's notable successes in this period. At Christmas 1903 he had the then unparalleled distinction of having five musicals running at the same time in the West End of London.<br>
<br>In 1910, with <span class="italic">Our Miss Gibbs</span> still giving him one of the greatest successes of his career, Caryll left Britain for America, where he combined with the American librettist C. M. S. McLellan on a series of musicals based, like <span class="italic">The Girl from Kay's</span>, on French plays. Their second Broadway venture, <span class="italic">The Pink Lady</span>, in particular, proved as great a success as his English shows, and while, in the wake of <span class="italic">The Merry Widow</span>, everything that was singable in Vienna was making its way to America, <span class="italic">The Pink Lady</span> unusually made the reverse trip, to play London, Paris, and Budapest. This series of shows based on French farces, of which <span class="italic">Oh! Oh! Delphine</span> and <span class="italic">The Girl behind the Gun</span> (known in Britain as <span class="italic">Kissing Time</span>) were the other prime examples, helped largely to set the fashion for modern &#145;musical comedy&#146; on the American stage.<br>
<br>Throughout his career Caryll maintained close links with the European theatre. A considerable number of his musicals got showings in Paris, Vienna, and Budapest at a time when the product of the English-language stage was largely ignored on the continent, and he composed original scores both for Paris (<span class="italic">S.A.R.</span>, or <span class="italic">Son altesse royale</span>, 1908) and for Vienna (<span class="italic">Die Reise nach Cuba</span>, 1901).<br>
<br>Caryll's career encompassed three eras of the musical theatre, and he seemed to be equally happy in each of them. If his first great successes were made in the light musical-comedy area, epitomized by the Gaiety Theatre shows, he proved with scores as divergent as the operettic <span class="italic">The Duchess of Dantzic</span> and <span class="italic">S.A.R.</span>, on the one hand, and the post-war <span class="italic">The Girl behind the Gun</span>, with its modern fox-trot and one-step rhythms, on the other, that he was a theatre composer who (unlike his contemporaries Lionel Monckton and Sidney Jones) could and would move with times and musical styles. His scores for <span class="italic">The Pink Lady</span> and <span class="italic">Oh! Oh! Delphine</span> contain numbers which equal the best that both the Viennese waltz masters and the new wave of American dance- and songwriters were producing in the years around the First World War. Unlike so many of those who followed him, he was as capable of turning out a complicated finale or concerted number as a catchy point number or comedy song but, largely because so much of his work was written for a kind of show which was by its nature ephemeral, few of his songs have survived as standards. Caryll was married for a period to the American singer (Annie) Geraldine Ulmar (1862&#150;1932) and later to another musical-comedy performer, Maud Hill. He died in the Ambassador's Hotel, New York, on 29 November 1921.<br>
