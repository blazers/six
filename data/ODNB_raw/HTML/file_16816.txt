<span class="headword">Llewelyn,  Thomas</span>  (<em>c.</em>1720&#150;1783), <span class="occ">Particular Baptist minister</span>, was born at Penalltau isaf, Gelli-gaer, Glamorgan, the son of a farmer, Evan Llewelyn. After embarking on the tailoring trade as a youth, he was baptized in 1738 in the Hengoed Baptist Church and trained for the Baptist ministry at Trosnant Academy, near Pontypool, in 1740, together with Morgan Edwards. He then studied at Bristol Baptist Academy under Bernard Foskett, and in London at the Independent academy under doctors Walker, Marriott, and Jennings. He was ordained at Prescott Street, Goodman's Fields, London, about 1747, but never took pastoral charge and was described as &#145;no preacher&#146;  (Swaine, 65). After securing financial independence through his marriage to Mary, he established an academy to train poor students for the Baptist ministry, where he taught from 1746 to 1770. He was presented with the degree of MA, and afterwards LLD, by the University of Aberdeen.<br>
<br>Llewelyn played a major role in the promotion and distribution of the Welsh translation of the <span class="roman">Bible</span>. To this end he published in 1768 <span class="italic">An Historical Account of the British and Welsh Versions and Editions of the Bible</span>, translated into Welsh in <span class="italic">Seren Gomer</span> (1815), and his <span class="italic">Historical and Critical Remarks on the British Tongue</span> (1769). His work prompted the SPCK to publish 20,000 copies (8000 more than originally intended) of the Welsh <span class="roman">Bible</span> in 1769. He also joined the Book Society for Promoting Religious Knowledge among the Poor in 1768 and prepared a list of congregations, of all denominations, to whom free copies of the Welsh <span class="roman">Bible</span> might be sent. Both of his works demonstrate his classical scholarship, and his historical research has been used by subsequent writers on the history of the Welsh <span class="roman">Bible</span>. Llewelyn was said to have been a descendant of Thomas Llewelyn of Rhigos, near Aberd&acirc;r, who, it was claimed by Edward Williams (Iolo Morganwg), translated a portion of the <span class="roman">Bible</span> into Welsh about 1540, twenty-seven years before William Salesbury's translation of the <span class="roman">New Testament</span> was printed  (B. H. Malkin, <span class="italic">The Scenery, Antiquities, and Biography of South Wales</span>, 2nd edn., 2 vols., 1807, 1.297).<br>
<br>In 1776 Llewelyn took a prominent part in the establishment of a Baptist mission for north Wales. He was one of the first members of the Gwyneddigion Society of London, and was its president in 1775. He was also a great supporter of the School for Welsh Girls, subsequently located at Ashford in Middlesex. He lived for many years in Queen Square, Bloomsbury, but died in Castleton, Monmouthshire, on 7 August 1783. He was buried in Bunhill Fields. He gave generously to education, and in particular to the Baptist college in Rhode Island and to Bristol Baptist college, to which he left his library, valued at his death at &pound;1500.<br>
