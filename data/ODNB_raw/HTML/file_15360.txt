<span class="headword">Kennedy <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Doyle; <em>other married name </em>Farrell]</span>,  Margaret</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1793), <span class="occ">singer and actress</span>, had an Irish background but, according to Anthony Pasquin, she was born in London and studied music under Gaetano Quilici before becoming a pupil of Thomas Augustine Arne. In his <span class="italic">Musical Memoirs</span> W. T. Parke claimed that some Covent Garden performers heard her singing when she was waiting on the parlour guests at a public house near St Giles-in-the-Fields and took Arne to hear her. She married Thomas Farrell on 7 August 1774 and in 1775 sang at the Haymarket Theatre in three concerts put on by Arne to display his pupils. Each evening included catches, glees, and Arne's <span class="italic">The Sot</span>, in which Mrs Farrell played the male role of Fairlove, with the hunting song &#145;The dusky night rides down the sky&#146;. After another pupils' concert early in 1776 she sang that March in two performances of Arne's <span class="italic">Comus</span> at Covent Garden.<br>
<br>Mrs Farrell joined the Covent Garden company in December 1776, when she was a principal singer in Arne's music for <span class="italic">Caractacus</span>. The <span class="italic">Morning Post</span> praised the duet between Leoni and Mrs Farrell, &#145;who sung with great taste, and fine execution&#146;  (<span class="italic">Morning Post</span>, 7 Dec 1776). Her Ariel in <span class="italic">The Tempest</span> later that month was successful vocally, but she was taller and more heavily built than her Prospero. Suited by her appearance and contralto voice for male roles, she sang the title role in Arne's <span class="italic">Artaxerxes</span> in January and Macheath in John Gay's <span class="italic">The Beggar's Opera</span> early the next season. The <span class="italic">Morning Post</span> of 18 October 1777 admired her voice and praised the judgement and spirit of her interpretation, but Macheath's singing of Arne's hunting song was attacked by the <span class="italic">Public Advertiser</span> as being &#145;in Defiance of Propriety and Common-Sense&#146;  (<span class="italic">Public Advertiser</span>, 18 Oct 1777). In the summers of 1777 and 1778 she appeared at Ranelagh, performing songs by Arne and James Hook, and in those years, besides her theatre appearances, she also sang in festivals in Manchester, Oxford, and Winchester and in the Lent oratorio seasons in London. On 24 January 1779 the widowed Margaret Farrell married an Irish doctor, Morgan Hugh Kennedy (<i>d</i>. 1809), and as Mrs Kennedy she remained a leading singer at Covent Garden until 1789.<br>
<br>Mrs Kennedy performed at Vauxhall Gardens every summer from 1781 to 1785, and numerous songs by Hook, Michael Arne, and others were published as sung by her there. She was heard in the oratorio seasons at Drury Lane (1779, 1784) and the Haymarket (1785). In 1791, two years after Mrs Kennedy's retirement from the stage, Mrs Papendiek was moved in a Handel concert at Westminster Abbey by her &#145;contralto voice melodiously sweet&#146;  (<span class="italic">Court and Private Life</span>, 2.254). At Covent Garden her salary rose from &pound;5 a week to &pound;12 in her last two seasons. She sang much incidental music, and her roles in stock pieces included Don Carlos in Sheridan's comic opera <span class="italic">The Duenna</span> and later Lucy in <span class="italic">The Beggar's Opera</span>. She created a large number of roles designed for her, including Cicely in Hook's <span class="italic">Lady of the Manor</span> (23 November 1778), Orra in Charles Dibdin's <span class="italic">The Islanders</span> (25 November 1780), Margaret and later Allen-a-Dale in William Shield's <span class="italic">Robin Hood</span> (17 April 1784; 12 October 1784), and William in his <span class="italic">Rosina</span> (31 December 1782), the role she played in her final stage appearance on 2 April 1789. The playwright John O'Keeffe gave her the Irish roles of Patrick in <span class="italic">The Poor Soldier</span> (4 November 1783) and Mrs Casey in <span class="italic">Fontainbleau</span> (16 November 1784), both with music by Shield, as well as one of her most frequently performed parts, Don Alfonso in Arnold's <span class="italic">The Castle of Andalusia</span> (2 November 1782). In 1786 the celebrated Mrs Kennedy appeared in her favourite roles in the Edinburgh summer season.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">The Secret History of the Green Rooms</span> claimed that Mrs Kennedy left the stage because of a disagreement with the manager, Thomas Harris, and <span class="italic">The Bystander</span> deplored her departure, praising her &#145;easy, sweet, natural, and unaffected&#146; singing  (<span class="italic">The Bystander</span>, 1790, 140). It is likely that her health was declining; Parke stated that she was prescribed brandy and water for a medical condition and by 1791 was drinking too much. She died on 23 January 1793 at Bayswater Hall, Bayswater (her husband was physician at the lying-in hospital there), and was buried at St Anne's, Soho, on 3 February. Even in 1821 a writer in the Boston <span class="italic">Euterpeiad</span> remembered her thrilling voice, a &#145;sweet counter tenor; a quality so rare in a female, that it charmed by its novelty no less than by its richness of tone&#146;  (<span class="italic">Euterpeiad</span>, 13 Oct 1821, 114).<br>
