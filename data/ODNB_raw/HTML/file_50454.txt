<span class="headword">Kidder,  Edward</span>  (1665/6&#150;1739), <span class="occ">cookery teacher and writer</span>, taught cookery in London between about 1720 and 1734, but little else about his life is known. The evidence for his activities is confined mostly to his one published work, the <span class="italic">Receipts of Pastry and Cookery</span>. In publication by 1720, this exists in six different versions; they give different addresses for his cooking schools and carry his portrait, but the date of the first edition is unknown. All copies are engraved, unusually for a cookery book at the time.<br>
<br>About 1720 Kidder taught at three London cookery schools, in St Martin's-le-Grand, Norris Street, and Little Lincoln's Inn Fields. After abandoning the two latter in 1721 he divided his time between two schools, teaching three afternoons a week at St Martin's-le-Grand and three afternoons at a school next to Furnival's Inn in Holborn, until in 1722 or 1723 he moved to Queen Street, near St Thomas Apostles. Some of his pupils wrote his recipes in blank books with a printed title page, one of which, inscribed by the owner, shows that Kidder was still teaching in Queen Street in 1734. Having risen socially, he donned a gentlemanly wig for his portrait. Passers-by in Holborn &#145;must have taken notice of a pastry-cook's shop with the following remarkable inscription over the door; &#147;Kidder's pastry-school&#148;&#146; an &#145;extraordinary Academy &hellip; calculated to instruct young ladies in the art and mystery of tarts and cheese-cakes&#146;  (<span class="italic">Connoisseur</span>, 2.190&#150;91). The &#145;scholars&#146; were mostly &#145;lower class&#146;  (ibid., 192), but the 1720 title page of <span class="italic">Receipts</span> announced: &#145;Ladies may be taught at their own Houses&#146;.<br>
<br>Although Kidder ran a pastry school, his recipes covered the whole range of soups, salads, meat, fish, poultry, sauces, and jellies, as well as pies and tarts. His recipes were repeatedly plagiarized throughout the eighteenth century, yet Kidder seems not to have plagiarized recipes himself. He probably taught his students to make established favourites, so even if his <span class="italic">Receipts</span> may not be especially inventive, it is a valuable record of 170 standard English dishes of the day, accompanied by attractive designs for pie shapes and decorations. The first recipe for puff pastry (identical to the standard commercial product of today) to appear in print is Kidder's.<br>
<br>Kidder died at his house in Holborn on 23 April 1739, aged seventy-three. One of three almost identical obituaries called him &#145;the famous Pastry-Master&#146; and claimed that he had &#145;taught near 6000 Ladies the Art of Pastry&#146;  (<span class="italic">London Magazine</span>, 205).<br>
