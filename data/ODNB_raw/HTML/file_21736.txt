<span class="headword">Pechell, Sir  Samuel John  Brooke</span>, third baronet  (1785&#150;1849), <span class="occ">naval officer and politician</span>, born on 1 September 1785 in Ireland, belonged to a French family which settled in Ireland after the revocation of the edict of Nantes. He was the eldest son of Major-General Sir Thomas Brooke Pechell, second baronet, and his wife, Charlotte, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5553/', "Lieutenant-General Sir John Clavering")</script>; he was brother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21734/', "Sir George Richard Brooke Pechell")</script>, and nephew of Admiral Sir John Borlase Warren. Under Warren's care he entered the navy on board the <i>Pomone</i> in July 1796. In August 1797 he was moved into the <i>Phoebe</i>, with Captain Robert Barlow, and was present at the capture of the <i>Nereide</i> on 21 December 1797, and of the <i>Africaine</i> on 5 March 1800, two of the most brilliant frigate actions of the war. Barlow, who had been knighted, was next moved into the <i>Triumph</i>, and Pechell followed him, until in February 1803 he was appointed acting lieutenant of the <i>Active</i>, a promotion confirmed by the Admiralty on 1 April. In January 1806 he joined his uncle's flagship, the <i>Foudroyant</i>, and in her was present at the capture of the <i>Marengo</i> and <i>Belle Poule</i> on 13 March. On 23 March 1807 he was promoted to the command of the sloop <i>Ferret</i> on the Jamaica station, and on 16 June 1808 was posted to the frigate <i>Cleopatra</i> (38 guns), in which on 22 January 1809 he engaged the 40-gun French frigate <i>Topaze</i>, at anchor under a battery at Pointe-Noire in Guadeloupe. The battery had, however, only one effective gun, and the <i>Topaze</i>, having sustained great loss, struck her colours when, after forty minutes, the frigate <i>Jason</i> and the sloop <i>Hazard</i> joined the <i>Cleopatra</i>. The disparity of force at the close of the action necessarily dimmed its brilliance, but Pechell's judgement in placing the <i>Cleopatra</i> so as to render the enemy's fire ineffective was deservedly commended. He afterwards took part in the reduction of Martinique. In October 1810 he was moved into the <i>Guerri&egrave;re</i>, but returned to the <i>Cleopatra</i> in July 1811, and commanded her in the North Sea, on the coast of France, and at Gibraltar.<br>
<br>In December 1812 Pechell was appointed to the <i>San Domingo</i>, his uncle's flagship, as commander-in-chief on the coast of North America, and in her returned to England in June 1814. He was nominated a CB in June 1815, and in July 1823 commissioned the frigate <i>Sybille</i> for service in the Mediterranean, where, in 1824, she formed part of the squadron off Algiers, under Sir Harry Burrard Neale, and was afterwards employed in preventing piracy, or the semi-piratical attempts of the Greek provisional government, near the Morea.<br>
<br>The <i>Sybille</i> was paid off in November 1826, and Pechell, having, by the death of his father, succeeded to the baronetcy on 17 June 1826, took the additional surname of Brooke, in conformity with the will of his grandmother, the only daughter and heir of Thomas Brooke of Paglesham in Essex. He married, on 15 April 1833, Julia Maria (<i>d</i>. 6 Sept 1844), daughter of the ninth Baron Petre. They had no children. He had no further service afloat, but from 1830 to 1834, and again from 1839 to 1841, was a lord of the Admiralty. He was in parliament as member for Hallestone in 1830, and for Windsor in 1833. He attained the rank of rear-admiral on 9 November 1846, and died on 3 November 1849. The title passed to his brother, George Richard Brooke Pechell.<br>
<br>Pechell was one of the few officers of his time to recognize the immense importance of speed and precision in the aiming and firing of guns. Following the plan of Captain Philip Broke in the <i>Shannon</i>, he carried out, when in command of the <i>San Domingo</i>, systematic exercise and target practice, by which he obtained results then considered remarkable. In the <i>Sybille</i> he followed a similar method, again with results far superior to anything before known.<br>
<br>Pechell wrote a valuable pamphlet, <span class="italic">Observations upon the Defective Equipment of Ships' Guns</span>, first published in 1812 (3rd edn 1828). In combination with Sir Howard Douglas and Sir William Bowles he prepared the way for the establishment in 1830 of the <i>Excellent</i> gunnery training ship, under George Smith. Shortly afterwards he became a junior lord of the Admiralty at the insistence of William IV, another gunnery enthusiast, and was in a position to secure the permanence of the ship in 1832. He was also influential in the decision to appoint Sir William Symonds as surveyor of the navy. Recognizing that improved gunnery alone was of limited value, he supported larger and faster ships. A royal favourite and a wealthy man, Pechell was one of the architects of the professional navy of the later nineteenth century.<br>
