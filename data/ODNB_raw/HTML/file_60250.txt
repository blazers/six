<span class="headword">Leftwich,  Joseph</span>  (1892&#150;1983), <span class="occ">writer, editor, and translator</span>, was born Joseph Lewkowitz on 20 September 1892 in Zutphen, the Netherlands, the son of Leopold Lewkowitz, a Polish Jewish cobbler, and his wife, Johanna Bachara. According to the &#145;Autobiographical Note&#146; included in his eighty-fifth birthday tribute, he was fortunate to survive a difficult circumcision. The family moved to London in 1897, when he was five. Speaking English at home, he grew up in Whitechapel, referring to himself as a &#145;Whitechapel boy&#146;. He &#145;became an English schoolboy in a Whitechapel board school&#146;  (&#145;Autobiographical note&#146;, 4) and remembered his father taking him to the processions for Queen Victoria's funeral and Edward VII's coronation. He attended his school &#145;a few years late [and] never caught up to the scholarship class, so that [his] schooling ended at 14&#146;  (ibid.). He was known as &#145;Lefty&#146;, and early friendships included Jack Isaacs, the poet Isaac Rosenberg, John Rodker, and Stephen Winsten. Leftwich's reminiscences and his 1911 diary, the only one he kept, subsequently became an important source of information for biographers of his contemporaries. His essays on Yiddish and Jewish literature, and especially his essay &#145;&#147;Jewish&#148; London Fifty Years Ago&#146;, in <span class="italic">1915&#150;1965: Fifty Years' Achievements in the Arts</span> (ed. J. Sonntag, 1966) are the source for the expression &#145;Whitechapel boys&#146; to describe Leftwich, Rodker, Winsten, Rosenberg, Jacob Epstein, and others.<br>
<br>On leaving school in 1906 Leftwich worked briefly as a junior librarian at the Jewish Institute in Mulberry Street, Whitechapel. This was followed by a variety of jobs including as an errand boy and working in a bakery, a tailors' workshop, a Jewish tailors' trade union, a furrier's workshop, and a Smithfield egg merchants. He spent his &#145;days in the libraries, or walking and talking with friends&#146;  (&#145;Autobiographical note&#146;, 7). Graced with a gregarious disposition, and a charming demeanour, he was appointed president of the local Jewish Literary and Social Society. During the First World War many of his friends became conscientious objectors or, as in the case of Rosenberg, were killed, but Leftwich, owing to his Dutch birth, avoided conscription or imprisonment. Initially his &#145;aspirations [were] more towards poetry than Yiddish&#146;  (ibid., 9). He frequented Harold Munro's Poetry Bookshop, and became a regular at the Caf&eacute; Royal, where he met Holbrook Jackson and Jacob Epstein among others. His poems were published in outlets such as <span class="italic">Colour</span> and <span class="italic">The Nation</span>. A meeting with Joseph Cowen, a leading Zionist, resulted in an invitation to meet Meir Grossman, who was starting a Jewish news agency. In 1921 Leftwich joined the Jewish Telegraphic Agency, where he worked until 1936 as London editor and bureau chief. On 20 May 1927, at the Dalston Synagogue, Islington, he married the 25-year-old Sala Bochenek, a shorthand typist, and daughter of Solomon Bochenek, merchant. They had one daughter, Joan, who married the New York-based writer Joseph McElroy.<br>
<br>Increasingly interested in Yiddish, from 1920 Leftwich, together with Leo Koenig, the Yiddish writer, edited <span class="italic">Renaissance</span>, a Yiddish magazine which included Yiddish translations of Israel and Louis Zangwill and Louis Golding among others. It also contained art reproductions of, to name a few, Marc Chagall, Amedeo Modigliani, Jacob Epstein, David Bomberg, and Jacob Kramer. Jewish Telegraphic Agency contacts, combined with Leftwich's political inclinations, led to connections with Poale Zion, the Jewish Social Democratic Labour Party organization. During the early years of the Second World War he became secretary to David Ben-Gurion and Moshe Sharett, future Israeli prime ministers. In 1941&#150;2 the Yiddish P. E. N. Center in New York appointed him its &#145;Permanent Delegate to the International P. E. N. Executive&#146;, in which capacity he served for over thirty-six years.<br>
<br>For more than fifty years Leftwich worked as a journalist, most notably with the <span class="italic">Jewish Chronicle</span>. From 1945 he directed the British Federation of Jewish Relief Organizations. Immanuel Jakobovitz, then chief rabbi, in his contribution to Leftwich's eighty-fifth birthday tribute, commented that Leftwich &#145;is the spokesman of the world in which he has never lived, and the living exponent of a culture which is now all but dead following its martyrdom in the Holocaust&#146;  (<span class="italic">Joseph Leftwich at Eighty-Five</span>, 12). Leftwich's <span class="italic">Yisroel Omnibus of Short Stories by Jewish Authors</span> (1933; rev. edn, 1963) was instrumental in making people aware of the achievements of Jewish writers and especially those writing in Yiddish. Other Leftwich publications serving to enhance the cause of Yiddish literature included <span class="italic">The Golden Peacock Anthology of Yiddish Poetry in English Translation</span> (1939; rev. edn, 1969), <span class="italic">&#145;The Book of Fire&#146;: Stories from Peretz</span> (1960), <span class="italic">The Way We Think: Anthology of Yiddish Essays</span> (2 vols., 1969), <span class="italic">P. E. N. Anthology of Modern Yiddish Literature</span> (1974), translations from the Yiddish of his great friend Abraham Sutzkever (1971), and <span class="italic">Poems by Zalman Shazar</span> (1974), who from 1963 to 1973 was Israeli president. Leftwich was noted too for <span class="italic">Israel Zangwill: a Biography</span> (1957), and co-authored with Joseph Frankel <span class="italic">Herzl: Man and Legend</span> (1943). In addition to innumerable essays and translations, other books included, with the far-right politician Arthur K. Chesterton, an account of <span class="italic">The Tragedy of Anti-Semitism</span> (1948).<br>
<br>Known for his quiet humour, diplomacy, extensive connections, and his and his wife's hospitality at their home at 2 Winchester Place, Highgate, London, Leftwich was respected for &#145;his ability, his dedication and his character&#146;  (<span class="italic">Joseph Leftwich at Eighty-Five</span>, 19), and for &#145;the cardinal virtues of tsedaka (charity) and rachmanut (pity, kindness and consideration)&#146;  (<span class="italic">Jewish Chronicle</span>, 4 March 1983). Bespectacled, stocky, of medium height, he was noted, according to Alexander Baron, for &#145;an occasional fierce flash in the eyes, that made them handsome and betrayed genius [with] &#147;hair like shocks of wheat wind tumbled&#148;&#146;  (<span class="italic">Joseph Leftwich at Eighty-Five</span>, 22), a distinguished mien that lasted well into old age. According to his daughter his most impressive trait was his &#145;tenacity. Coming from such a poor beginning and with no encouragement from home (in fact discouragement), to have reached his position in Jewish life and letters is indeed a most impressive achievement&#146;  (ibid., 32). He died on 28 February 1983 at the Whittington Hospital, Islington, of bronchopneumonia and was survived by his wife and daughter.<br>
