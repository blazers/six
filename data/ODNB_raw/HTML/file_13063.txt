<span class="headword">Herbert,  William</span>  (1778&#150;1847), <span class="occ">classical scholar and Church of England clergyman</span>, was born at Highclere Castle, Hampshire, on 12 January 1778, the third son and fifth child of Henry Herbert, first earl of Carnarvon (1741&#150;1811), and Lady Elizabeth Alicia Maria (1752&#150;1826), eldest daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30139/', "Charles Wyndham, earl of Egremont")</script>. He was educated at Eton College (1790&#150;95), where he edited a volume of poems entitled <span class="italic">Musae Etonenses</span> in 1795. On leaving Eton he obtained a prize for a Latin poem entitled <span class="italic">Rhenus</span> which was published; a translation appeared in <span class="italic">Translations of Oxford Prize Poems</span> (1831). In 1795 Herbert matriculated at Christ Church, Oxford, but soon migrated to Exeter College, where he graduated BA in 1798. Subsequently moving to Merton, he proceeded MA in 1802, BCL in 1808, DCL in 1808, and BD in 1840. Inclining to a political career, he served as MP for Hampshire in 1806&#150;7, after a very expensive campaign, and for Cricklade in 1811&#150;12; he also practised at the bar as a member of Doctors' Commons. On 17 May 1806 he married the Hon. Letitia Emily Dorothea, second daughter of Joshua, fifth Viscount Allen; they had a son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13037/', "Henry William Herbert")</script>, and three other children.<br>
<br>Soon after retiring from parliament in 1812 Herbert changed course. In 1814 he was ordained, and was nominated to the valuable rectory of Spofforth in the West Riding of Yorkshire. He left Spofforth in 1840 on his promotion to the deanery of Manchester. He died suddenly at his house in Hereford Street, Park Lane, London, on 28 May 1847.<br>
<br>As a classical scholar, a linguist, and a naturalist, Herbert acquired a high reputation. In 1801 he brought out <span class="italic">Ossiani darthula</span>, a small volume of Greek and Latin poetry. In 1804 he published part 1 of his <span class="italic">Select Icelandic Poetry, Translated from the Originals with Notes</span>. Part 2 followed in 1806. Both are noteworthy for containing the first adequate illustration of ancient Scandinavian literature to appear in England. Herbert's efforts secured sufficient attention to induce Byron to mention him in his <span class="italic">English Bards and Scotch Reviewers</span> (1809):<blockquote>
<div>Herbert shall wield Thor's hammer, and sometimes<br>
</div>
<div>In gratitude thou'lt praise his rugged rhymes.<br>
</div>
</blockquote>Other translations from German, Danish, and Portuguese poems, with some miscellaneous English poems (1804), attest Herbert's exceptional command of foreign languages. He continued his literary career with articles of a non-political character in the <span class="italic">Edinburgh Review</span>. He also wrote a number of narrative poems, including <span class="italic">Helga</span> (1815); <span class="italic">Hedin, or, The Spectre of the Tomb</span>, a tale in verse from Danish history (1820); <span class="italic">Pia della pietra</span> (1820); <span class="italic">Iris</span>, a Latin ode (1820); and the <span class="italic">Wizard Wanderer of Jutland</span> (1820&#150;22). <span class="italic">Attila, or, The Triumph of Christianity</span>, an epic poem in twelve books with a historical preface, came out in 1838, the fruit of many years' labour, and was followed by a final volume of poems, <span class="italic">The Christian</span>, in 1846.<br>
<br>Early attached to the study of natural history, and a good shot, Herbert helped J. Rennie to edit White's <span class="italic">Selborne</span> in 1833, and E. T. Bennett's edition of the work in 1837 was also indebted to him for many notes, particularly on ornithology. For many years he contributed articles to the <span class="italic">Botanical Register</span> and the <span class="italic">Botanical Magazine</span>, particularly on the subject of bulbous plants. He cultivated a large number of these plants at Spofforth, Yorkshire, and at Mitcham, Surrey; many have since been lost to cultivation. His standard volume on this group of plants, <span class="italic">Amaryllidaceae</span>, was issued in 1837, and reprinted in 1966. This important work also provides examples of Herbert's skill as an artist. His &#145;Crocorum synopsis&#146; appeared in the miscellaneous portion of the <span class="italic">Botanical Register</span> for 1843&#150;4&#150;5. Extremely valuable contributions on hybridization made by him to the <span class="italic">Journal of the Horticultural Society</span> in 1846 and 1847 were the outcome of close observation and experiment. He considered hybridization a factor in evolution and his acquaintance with Charles Darwin led to numerous references to his findings in Darwin's <span class="italic">Natural Selection</span>. His <span class="italic">History of the Species of Crocus</span>, edited by J. Lindley in 1847, was reprinted separately from the journal just after his death. The genus <i>Herbertia</i> of Sweet appropriately commemorates his name. His chief works, including his sermons, reviews, and scientific memoirs, besides his early poetical volumes, appeared in two volumes in 1842.<br>
