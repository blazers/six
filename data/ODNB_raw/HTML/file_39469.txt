<span class="headword">Samuel <span class="st"> [Samuels]</span>,  Moses</span>  (1795&#150;1860), <span class="occ">watchmaker and Hebrew scholar</span>, was born in London, the youngest of three sons of Emanuel Menachem Samuel (<i>c</i>.1755&#150;<i>c</i>.1800) and Hanna (Hinde). Emanuel Samuel, who bore the Hebrew title &#145;the learned&#146;, had left his birthplace, Kempen in the province of Posen, and settled in London about 1775. At the age of ten Moses moved with his mother to Liverpool where his brothers had already settled. He lived there for the rest of his life, residing for the longest period in Paradise Street. He seems to have received little formal education but was an outstanding autodidact and is said to have mastered twelve languages, including Chinese. Samuel set up in business as a watchmaker and silversmith. In 1821 he married Harriet (1793&#150;1843), daughter of Israel Israel of Bury Street, St Mary Axe, London. They had two daughters and three sons; the latter all married daughters of Schreiner Wolfe of Great Yarmouth, first mayor of Kimberley in the northern Cape Colony.<br>
<br>Samuel's main source of literary inspiration was the philosophy of Moses Mendelssohn, whom he called &#145;the grand luminary of science and knowledge&#146;  (<span class="italic">Memoirs of Moses Mendelsohn</span>, 1825, vi). Samuel became his chief English interpreter and translator; he published English editions of Mendelssohn's <span class="italic">Jerusalem</span> (1838) and of the celebrated correspondence between Mendelssohn and Lavater, published as part of <span class="italic">Memoirs</span>. Samuel praised the &#145;inimitable mellifluence&#146; of Mendelssohn's style and the &#145;pleasing ductility of his most exquisite cogitations&#146;. Samuel favoured &#145;a plain, almost literal, flowing, easily comprehended translation&#146;  (<span class="italic">Address on the Position of the Jews in Britain</span>, 1844, 11). His renderings of Mendelssohn succeeded in conveying the charm and lucidity of the original and remained the standard English versions for more than a century.<br>
<br>Samuel also translated into English the pseudepigraphical <span class="roman">Book of Jasher</span>, a supposedly ancient Hebrew text, which Samuel persuaded himself was authentic. He sold his translation for &pound;150 to the American-Jewish newspaper owner Mordecai M. Noah, who published it in New York in 1840. Samuel's name was not mentioned, since the two men differed over the authenticity of the work. The translation was accepted as accurate but the publication provoked criticism by scholars who rejected the claims made on behalf of the text. It won acceptance, however, by the Mormon prophet Joseph Smith.<br>
<br>Samuel was a determined foe of Christian proselytization among the Jews and published anti-missionary pamphlets in 1819, 1822, and 1827. A liberal in politics, he was a vigorous campaigner for Jewish emancipation. In 1840, while attending a meeting on the subject, he collapsed and in 1845 he became paralysed. &#145;My doctor informed me that if I did not give up my abstruse calculations I should have another attack&#146;, he later wrote to Lord Brougham  (Samuel to Brougham, 24 Feb 1850, UCL, Brougham MSS). Samuel nevertheless persisted in his literary activity and attributed his partial recovery to the embrace of total abstinence. During the later part of his life he earned a living as a teacher of languages.<br>
<br>Like his hero Mendelssohn, Samuel combined strict orthodoxy with attraction to the ideas of the Enlightenment. While opposed to the incipient Reform movement in Judaism, he favoured modest innovations in synagogal practice, such as the institution of lectures in English. In 1846&#150;7, with D. M. Isaacs, minister to the Liverpool Jewish community, Samuel edited <span class="italic">Kos Yeshuot</span> (&#145;Cup of Salvation&#146;), a monthly magazine &#145;devoted to the advocacy of Orthodox Jewish principles&#146;. Many of the contributions appeared in Hebrew with English translations. The magazine's publication of original articles in Hebrew on secular subjects, for example, one by Samuel celebrating the railway engine, was unusual for the period, particularly in England.<br>
<br>Unlike his brother Louis (1794&#150;1859), who died a rich man, Samuel remained poor to the end. He nevertheless acquired a library of rare Hebrew books. Samuel's business prospered in the hands of his descendants. By the turn of the century it developed into the first multiple shop jeweller in Britain. Trading as &#145;H. Samuel&#146; it became the most successful retail watch and jewellery chain in the country. Moses Samuel's great-grandson, Gilbert Samuel Edgar, served as chairman from 1935 to 1978. Moses Samuel died at Ranelagh Place, Mount Pleasant, Liverpool, on 17 April 1860 and was buried in the Liverpool Jewish cemetery. He left &#145;effects under &pound;100&#146;. His descendants included a Roman Catholic priest, Father Edward Hill, and a Metropolitan Police magistrate, Geoffrey George Raphael. His great-nephew was Herbert Louis Samuel, first Viscount Samuel.<br>
