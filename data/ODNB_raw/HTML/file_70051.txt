<span class="headword">Cowper,  John</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1603), <span class="occ">Church of Scotland minister</span>, was the son of John Cowper, burgess and tailor of Edinburgh&#151;deacon of the tailors in 1574&#151;and his wife, Marion Duncan; <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6509/', "William Cowper (1568&#150;1619)")</script>, bishop of Galloway, was his brother. John Cowper studied at St Mary's College, St Andrews, where he graduated BA in 1577. Prior to his appointment to a parish, on 3 February 1586, James VI commanded him to pray for Mary, queen of Scots, from the pulpit of St Giles, Edinburgh, something which most of the kirk's ministers had refused to do. When Cowper also refused, the king ordered him to vacate the pulpit in favour of Patrick Adamson, archbishop of St Andrews. Cowper appeared before the king and privy council that afternoon and was warded in Blackness Castle at his own expense. The town council supported him to the extent of granting him &pound;40 Scots to meet the expenses which he incurred during his confinement. On 22 March a bond of caution for &pound;500 Scots was provided by his father and Andrew Borthwick on his release, on the understanding that he would make satisfaction to the king for his offence and would not preach or administer the sacraments without the king's licence. The bond continued to be held by the privy council until the following year.<br>
<br>On 23 November 1586 Cowper was elected one of the ministers of Edinburgh. He did not serve for long, being translated and inducted to the collegiate charge of Glasgow on 28 February 1587. There is no record of his being further involved in public affairs, but at the general assembly of 1602 he was appointed to visit the churches of Lothian. He died in Glasgow on 25 December 1603. Cowper was married to Elizabeth, sister of John Livingston of Baldoran, who survived him. Their son John was bursar of the University of Glasgow in 1603, and in 1614 their daughter Janet married Joseph Laurie, successively minister of Kirkintilloch, Stirling, Longforgan, and finally Perth, where Laurie held the collegiate charge which had once been his wife's uncle's (from 1635 to 1640). Objections to the marriage by Janet's curators, who revealingly included members of the influential Livingston and Fleming families, were not sustained by the presbytery of Glasgow.<br>
