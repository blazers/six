<span class="headword">Ferguson,  William Gouw</span>  (<em>b. </em>1632/3, <em>d.</em> in or after 1689), <span class="occ">painter</span>, was probably born in Scotland. Of his parents nothing is known. He specialized largely in paintings of dead game in the style of Willem van Aelst, and achieved considerable proficiency in this field; works by Ferguson have been honoured with the false signatures of Cornelis van Lelienbergh and Jan Weenix. Of his early works in public collections, a <span class="italic">Still Life with Birds</span> is in the Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam. Other early works are in the Hermitage Museum, St Petersburg. He is said to have trained in his native country, but his style is so Dutch that a partial Netherlandish training seems probable. He was certainly in Holland by 1660, when he hired a house at The Hague, and in 1668 he was still there. Part of the rental contract said that he should paint a picture a year for the owner of the house. In 1681 he was living in the Batavierstraat in Amsterdam, and on 28 June his betrothal to Sara van Someren of Stockholm is recorded in the city archives; the artist was said on this occasion to be forty-eight. According to Walpole &#145;he lived long in Italy and France&#146;  (Walpole, 574), and this has generally been given credence on the basis of a series of dramatically, often eerily, lit landscapes containing classical remains&#151;though the possibility that he worked at home from prints after the antique is surely open. Two of these pictures were made as over-doors for the duchess of Lauderdale in 1673, and are still <i>in situ</i> at Ham House, Surrey. Walpole claimed that &#145;he worked very cheap, and died here&#146;  (ibid., 574), but his place and date of death have yet to be established. His last dated painting bears the year 1689 (Christies, London, 10 November 1967). In 1692 a sale in the Lawnmarket in Edinburgh contained eight works by Ferguson, and four further works were sold in Edinburgh on 3 March 1693. These sales suggest that his last years were spent in his homeland. Three later still lifes and a <span class="italic">Ruined Altar and Figures</span> signed by Ferguson are in the National Gallery, Edinburgh. Other examples of works by Ferguson are in Glasgow Art Gallery, Brodie Castle, Manchester City Galleries, Berlin Art Gallery, and the Kunsthalle, Hamburg.<br>
