<span class="headword">Lowndes,  Marie Adelaide Elizabeth Ren&eacute;e Julia  Belloc</span>  (1868&#150;1947), <span class="occ">author</span>, was born on 5 August 1868 at 11 George Street, Marylebone, London, the first of two children of Louis Marie Belloc (1830&#150;1872), French barrister, and his wife, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/41193/', "Elizabeth (Bessie) Rayner Parkes (1829&#150;1925)")</script>, great-granddaughter of Joseph Priestley, formerly editor of the <span class="italic">English Woman's Journal</span> and an active British feminist, who had converted to Catholicism. Marie Belloc and her younger brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30699/', "Hilaire Belloc")</script>, were brought up as Catholics, spending most of their time at La Celle St Cloud, then a rural suburb of Paris. During the Franco-Prussian War of 1870 and the Paris commune of 1871 the family lived in London at 11 Great College Street, Westminster. Although their house in France had suffered badly from the war, they returned, and continued to spend much of the year there even after the death of Louis Belloc in August 1872. Both Marie and Hilaire considered themselves at least half French, and Marie always seemed to speak English with a slight French accent (although she was known as Mary to her brother and most of her friends). When not in France they lived with Mrs Eliza Parkes, Bessie's mother, at 17 Wimpole Street. However, in 1877 Mrs Parkes died, and shortly afterwards Bessie Belloc lost much of her money through an unfortunate investment, which forced the family to move to a cottage at Slindon in Sussex.<br>
<br>Marie Belloc's life was thus subject to disruption; her formal education seems to have consisted of two years in a convent at Mayfield in Sussex, and even in old age she regretted her poor spelling of both French and English. Despite this, in her teens she decided to become a writer, and in 1888 Cardinal Manning, a family friend, introduced her to W. T. Stead, who accepted her as a contributor to the <span class="italic">Pall Mall Gazette</span> under the tutelage of Edmund Garrett. Her first major assignment was collaborating on a guide to the 1889 Paris Exhibition. From then on she continued to write for the <span class="italic">Pall Mall Gazette</span>, among other periodicals, mainly on French matters, making numerous trips to France, and meeting many prominent French writers of the day, including Edmond de Goncourt, Paul Verlaine, and Jules Verne. In this way she contributed to the family income, helping among other things to subsidize Hilaire Belloc's education. On 9 January 1896 she married Frederick Sawney Archibald Lowndes (1867&#150;1940), a staff writer on <span class="italic">The Times</span>; they had one son and two daughters.<br>
<br>Although she had a reasonably successful career as a journalist, Marie Belloc Lowndes's main ambition was to write books, especially fiction. Shortly after their marriage Frederick Lowndes was left a legacy of &pound;2000 and suggested that they live on this while Marie tried her hand at writing. Her first two books had little success, but she soon began to make a name for herself. In the course of the next fifty years she published at least seventy books of various kinds, mainly under her own name, but for two works using the pseudonyms Philip Curtin and Elizabeth Rayner. Her books included biographies of royal persons, but more usually they were romances or crime novels. It was the last genre with which she came to be most associated, especially through her novels <span class="italic">The Chink in the Armour</span> (1912) and most of all <span class="italic">The Lodger</span>, published in 1913, a story of a London couple in the 1880s who suspect that their lodger is Jack the Ripper; this has undergone various adaptations, as a stage play, several films (including an early Alfred Hitchcock), and an opera by Phyllis Tate. <span class="italic">The Lodger</span> was a best-seller in its day, yet Marie Belloc Lowndes found herself constrained in the summer of 1914 to borrow &pound;350 from her brother, Hilaire Belloc, to pay off an overdraft, a debt which seemed to rankle over the years, although in general brother and sister remained friends.<br>
<br>In 1909 Marie Belloc Lowndes and her husband had set up house at 9 Barton Street, just round the corner from her childhood home at Great College Street. Even before her marriage she had enjoyed an active social life, among other things attending the Sunday &#145;at homes&#146; of Constance and Oscar Wilde, and after her marriage her husband's unsocial working hours allowed her to lead, as she put it, &#145;the life of a happy widow&#146;. During the day she wrote (with a quill pen), but from late afternoon she regularly went visiting or entertained. She made friends with (among many others) Henry James, Rhoda Broughton, and George Meredith, as well as Margot Asquith; during Herbert Asquith's premiership she was a frequent guest at 10 Downing Street. She also helped younger writers, encouraging among others Graham Greene, Hugh Walpole, Margaret Kennedy, E. M. Delafield, and L. P. Hartley. Like her mother, but unlike her brother, she was a strong supporter of women's rights, being president of the Women Writers' Suffrage League in 1913. Also, like many suffragists at this time, she was always a smart dresser, asserting that every woman ought to dress as far as she could afford to do so in the fashion. She was a frequent traveller, especially to the USA, to which she made annual visits in the 1930s, and where she had many admirers&#151;some unexpected, such as Ernest Hemingway, to whom her books had been recommended by Gertrude Stein.<br>
<br>On the outbreak of war in 1939 Marie Belloc Lowndes and her husband (now retired) moved to 28 Crooked Billet, near Wimbledon Common, where her husband died in 1940, to her great grief. Henceforward she embarked on autobiography, producing four highly successful volumes: <span class="italic">I, too, have Lived in Arcadia</span> (1941), <span class="italic">Where Love and Friendship Dwelt</span> (1943), <span class="italic">The Merry Wives of Westminster</span> (1946), and <span class="italic">A Passing World</span> (1948). In 1942 she had moved back to Barton Street, this time to no. 1, and she spent the rest of her life between there and Parfetts House, Eversley Cross, Hampshire, where her daughter Lady Iddesleigh lived. She died at Parfetts House of stomach cancer on 14 November 1947.<br>
