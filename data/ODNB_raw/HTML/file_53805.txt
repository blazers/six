<span class="headword">Jacobi,  Johann Christian</span>  (1670?&#150;1750), <span class="occ">bookseller and translator</span>, was born in Germany. He studied at the University of Halle, probably in the 1690s, where he became closely associated with August Hermann Francke, the leading figure of the pietist reform movement within contemporary German Lutheranism, and his circle. Although his motivation in coming to England is uncertain, he is said to have made the acquaintance of English students at Halle. He was resident in London from 1709 at the latest, setting up as a German bookseller early that year &#145;next door but one to Sommerset-House in the Strand&#146;  (<span class="italic">Der christliche Wandermann</span>, 1710, title page). In this capacity he worked closely with Anthony William Boehm, Francke's closest colleague in England, and with Joseph Downing, printer and bookseller to the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge (SPCK), with which Boehm enjoyed the closest links. Jacobi had married Mary Magdalen (whose surname before marriage is unknown) by 1712. Their son John Owen was baptized at St Paul's, Covent Garden, on 7 June 1712. In that year Jacobi's business premises moved to Southampton Court on the north side of the Strand. From 1714 he was &#145;chapel-keeper&#146; at the German court chapel in St James's.<br>
<br>Jacobi's business can best be understood as a specialist retail outlet aimed at the growing market for German-language materials in an area known for German settlement and in close proximity to the Lutheran chapel at St Mary, Savoy. It was largely based on titles printed by Downing for the SPCK and on items imported from Heinrich Elers's pietist bookshop at Halle. Jacobi was referred to some fourteen times in imprints between 1710 and 1718, sometimes simply as &#145;the German bookseller in the Strand&#146;. <span class="italic">Estrid: an Account of a Swedish Maid, who hath Lived Six Years without Food</span> (&#145;London: printed for J. Jacobi, near Somerset-House, in the Strand, 1711&#146;) may represent a typically pietist title; to this publication was appended a list of &#145;Books to be sold at the German bookseller's shop&#146;, including seven Latin and fifteen English titles almost all of which were written or edited by Boehm and published by or in association with Downing. The list was headed by Boehm's Latin translation of Johann Arndt's <span class="italic">Vom wahren Christenthum</span>, one of the founding texts of pietism.<br>
<br>If the sale of German bibles, psalters, and prayer books represented Jacobi's core business, then the <span class="italic">Guide de Londres dedi&eacute; aux voyageurs etrangers</span>, issued by Jacobi in 1710 with the curious imprint &#145;le German Bookseller-shop&#146;, attempted to appeal to a different market, in this case the many French-speaking immigrants and visitors likely to be found in the Strand area. Despite this diversification, the economic basis for Jacobi's bookshop is not entirely clear; it may not have been sustainable as an independent enterprise without support from Halle or the SPCK. Within a couple of years of his final move about 1717 to the Exeter Exchange, which provided cheap retail space on the Strand for a number of foreign booksellers in this period, Jacobi appears to have given up bookselling altogether.<br>
<br>After his withdrawal from the book trade Jacobi remained active as a translator, publishing <span class="italic">Psalmodia Germanica</span> in 1722; the second edition of 1725 probably represents his last collaboration with Downing. These contributions to the English hymnody were apparently much admired in their day. In 1735 Richard Ford published Jacobi's translation of Johann Jacob Rambach's biography of Boehm. In the same year Jacobi appears to have visited Germany with his three daughters, as a passport was issued for &#145;Johann Christian Jacobi, his daughters and their effects to cross into Holland and thence to Saxony and to return without hindrance&#146;. He died in London on or about 14 December 1750, his will suggesting that his wife had predeceased him.<br>
<br>Jacobi's bookselling represents an important aspect of the dissemination of Halle pietism in the English-speaking world. As the first book trade outlet to be opened in England with specifically German characteristics, it also represents a (minor) milestone in the development of cultural relations between the two countries. After the apparent failure of his business about 1718, no further German bookshop was to open in London for over thirty years.<br>
