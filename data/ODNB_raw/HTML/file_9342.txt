<span class="headword">Ferme <span class="st"> [Fairholm]</span>,  Charles</span>  (1565/6&#150;1617), <span class="occ">Church of Scotland minister and university principal</span>, was born in Edinburgh of unknown parents. He was brought up in the family of Alexander Guthrie, town clerk of Edinburgh, and entered the university there in 1584. In 1588 he graduated MA, and in October that year was an unsuccessful candidate for a regency. He studied Hebrew and theology, and was elected regent in 1589, in which capacity he graduated a class of nineteen on 12 August 1593, and another of thirty-five on 30 July 1597. Among his students were John Adamson (<i>d</i>. 1653), Edward Brice, David Calderwood, Oliver Colt, professor of Latin at Saumur, and William Craig, professor of theology there.<br>
<br>On 13 December 1589 Ferme was authorized by the presbytery to preach, when necessary, in the second charge of St Giles, Edinburgh. In 1596 and again in 1597 he was called to the proposed second charge at Haddington, but chose to remain at the college of Edinburgh. On 12 September 1598 he was still in Edinburgh, preaching in St Giles, but later in the same year he had gone north. He accepted the charge of Philorth, Aberdeenshire (which town changed its name to Fraserburgh in 1613).<br>
<br>The intention of the patron Sir Alexander Fraser (<i>d</i>. 1623) was that Ferme should be the head of a university which he was attempting to establish. Fraser obtained a royal grant on 1 July 1592, confirming his possession of the lands of Philorth, and giving him powers to erect and endow a college and university. A &#145;spacious quadrangular building&#146; was erected, of which Lewis traced the remains at the west end of Fraserburgh  (Lewis, 454&#150;5). In 1594 the project was approved by parliament, which in 1597 appropriated to the university the revenues of the parishes of Philorth, Tyrie, Crimond, and Rathen. In the same year the general assembly endorsed the appointment of Ferme as principal, but it appears that he expected to have no pastoral responsibilities. In March 1600, Fraser having &#145;refusit to intertaine a Pastour &hellip; vnlesse he vndertake both the said charges&#146;, the assembly enjoined Ferme to fill both offices  (Thomson, 3.958).<br>
<br>Ferme's opinions on royal ecclesiastical policy caused him trouble. In October 1600, when Peter Blackburn was appointed bishop of Aberdeen, with a seat in parliament, Ferme denounced this innovation. In February 1605 he appeared before the privy council with John Forbes to justify the excommunication of the earl of Huntly. He attended the general assembly which met at Aberdeen on 2 July, in defiance of a royal command. For this irregularity he was imprisoned on 3 October in Doune Castle, Perthshire, at his own expense. On 24 October he was summoned to appear before the privy council, but declined its authority in causes spiritual, and made his escape, returning north where he attended presbytery meetings. He was again cited for 24 February 1607, appeared before the council on 20 May, and again escaped, hiding himself for four days in Edinburgh.<br>
<br>Accounts of what happened next are confused. Although it has been assumed that Ferme was confined on Bute for some time, the register of the presbytery of Deer shows that he was never absent for more than three months between 1607 and 1610. He appears to have received the stipend of Philorth (&pound;82 17<i>s</i>. 9<i>d</i>.) in 1607, but not in 1608. After 1609 he was restored to his livings, and the university may have maintained a tenuous existence until his death. He died on 24 September 1617, aged fifty-one, and was buried in his church. Although he was married his wife's name is not recorded, nor are any dates of her birth or death. They had one daughter, Agnes.<br>
<br>Ferme published nothing, but after his death two of his manuscripts were given to his former student John Adamson by a student, William Rires. Adamson intended to publish both, but the &#145;Lectiones in Esterem&#146; were not published, and are lost. The <span class="italic">Analysis logica in epistolam apostoli Pauli ad Romanos</span> (1651), is all that remains of Ferme's classwork at Fraserburgh. A translation by William Skae was issued by the Wodrow Society in 1850.<br>
