<span class="headword">Moon, Sir  (Edward) Penderel</span>  (1905&#150;1987), <span class="occ">administrator in India and writer</span>, was born on 13 November 1905 in Green Street, Mayfair, London, the only son and second of five children of Robert Oswald Moon, consultant cardiologist, and his wife, Ethel Rose Grant Waddington. Dr Moon wrote about philosophy and Greek medicine as well as diseases of the heart; he stood several times as a Liberal candidate for parliament.<br>
<br>Penderel Moon followed his father to Winchester College and to New College, Oxford, was placed in the first class in <i>literae humaniores</i> (1927), and in the same year was elected to a fellowship at All Souls College, Oxford, which he held until 1935. In 1929 he was appointed to the Indian Civil Service, arriving in India on 29 November. He was posted to the Punjab and attached for instruction to Gurdaspur district under Evan Jenkins, later private secretary to the viceroy and governor of the Punjab, who formed very early a high opinion of his administrative ability. By the time he had charge of the difficult district of Multan, it was known that Moon decided quickly and acted firmly but was not notably tolerant of the opinions of others, even his elders. None the less, he was appointed in 1938 private secretary to the governor of the Punjab, Sir Henry Craik; he was young for this key position and was also unusual in winning races on the governor's horses.<br>
<br>After his spell as private secretary, Moon was posted in 1941 as deputy commissioner to Amritsar, the focal point of the Sikh religion and of special importance in war in view of the Sikh contribution to the Indian army. Like many young British officers in the Indian Civil Service, Moon considered that the government of the second marquess of Linlithgow was dragging its feet about Indian advance towards self-government. In November 1942 he addressed to the Punjab government a letter arguing that those imprisoned for preaching civil disobedience should receive better treatment; this was in order, but when he received an unsympathetic reply, explaining the critical war situation, Moon's reaction was not. He sent a copy of the government's letter, with his own acid comments, to a brother of Rajkumari Amrit Kaur, secretary to M. K. Gandhi. He was at the time in gaol. This letter was intercepted and Moon was in serious trouble. Eventually the new governor, Sir Bertrand Glancy, persuaded him not to insist on dismissal, but to resign; he refused the suggestion of a proportionate pension.<br>
<br>Moon returned to England in April 1943, on six months' leave pending retirement, but in 1946 Viscount Wavell, now viceroy, on the advice of his private secretary, Sir Evan Jenkins, invited him to return, on contract, as secretary to the boards of development and planning. In April 1947 he became revenue minister of the state of Bahawalpur and stayed on after India's independence, serving as chief commissioner of Himachal Pradesh, as chief commissioner of Manipur state, and as adviser to the planning commission. The tone of an address to the Indian Administrative Staff College suggests that he was sometimes as critical of the new rulers of India as of the old.<br>
<br>During the Second World War Moon had published <span class="italic">Strangers in India</span> (1944), in which he argued that the ills of India could not be solved by a foreign government; it was followed by <span class="italic">Warren Hastings</span> (1947), brilliantly written in a simple, lucid style and notable for its sympathy with Hastings.<br>
<br>Moon's last appointment in India ended in 1961. He was knighted in 1962 for services to good relations between Britain and India, to which indeed he had notably contributed. After his return to England he held brief appointments with the World Bank and as adviser to the government of Thailand but soon put the main thrust of his life into scholarly work on India. In 1961 he published <span class="italic">Divide and quit</span>, which he later believed the most likely to survive of any of his books. It contains a lucid account of the events leading up to the partition of India and Pakistan, and an unflinching assessment of responsibility together with a day-by-day account of his own actions and observations as revenue minister and district magistrate in the border state of Bahawalpur during the months immediately following the division of the Punjab and the slaughter that followed. There can be no doubt that his power of swift decision, and his application of common sense amounting to brilliance, saved many lives; his account constitutes first-hand historical evidence of a high order. His <span class="italic">Gandhi and Modern India</span> is an admirable counterpoise to his <span class="italic">Warren Hastings</span>.<br>
<br>From 1965 to 1972 Moon was a fellow of All Souls, being the college's estates bursar from 1966 to 1969, and from 1972 to 1982 he was at the India Office Library and Records, preparing for publication, with Nicholas Mansergh, the India Office documents on <span class="italic">The Transfer of Power 1942&#150;7</span> (12 volumes). He found time also to edit <span class="italic">Wavell: the Viceroy's Journal</span> (1973), a labour of love carried out with his usual clarity and distinction. When he died his last and most substantial book, <span class="italic">The British Conquest and Dominion of India</span> (1989), was still in proof. It was written, as always, with clarity, detachment, and mastery of complex material. In 1966 he married Pauline Marion, daughter of the Revd William Everard Cecil Barns; the marriage was not a success and was soon dissolved; there were no children.<br>
<br>Moon's life was not all spent toiling at a desk. Before retiring from All Souls he bought a mixed farm near Aylesbury, which he later enlarged. He employed a manager, but took pleasure not only in the business of the farm but in the physical work of haymaking and harvest; he was a generous employer. He was a good horseman and enjoyed both hunting and racing. He sang in Oxford in the Bach Choir and had a particular admiration for the music of Handel.<br>
<br>Penderel Moon resembled in many ways an aristocrat of the Enlightenment. In appearance he was trim and slight; in personal habit, ascetic. In scholarship, as in farming, he combined the confident mastery of the professional with the detachment of the amateur of independent means. He was decisive in his opinions and often autocratic, a champion of the peasant but no egalitarian. In youth, he liked to surprise and even to shock, but he never took up a position merely for effect. He died on 2 June 1987 at home at Manor Farm, Wotton Underwood, Buckinghamshire.<br>
