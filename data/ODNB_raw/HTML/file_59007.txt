<span class="headword">Sprigg,  Christopher St John</span> <span class="st"> [<em>pseud. </em>Christopher Caudwell]</span>  (1907&#150;1937), <span class="occ">writer</span>, was born on 20 October 1907 at 53 Montserrat Road, Putney, south-west London, the third child of Stanhope William Sprigg (<i>d</i>. 1932), then literary editor of the <span class="italic">Daily Express</span>, and Jessie Mary Caudwell (1872/1873&#150;1916), a professional artist.<br>
<br>Stanhope Sprigg, an Irish protestant, had converted to his wife's Catholicism upon their marriage, and their three children were brought up as devout members of the Roman communion. Paula, the eldest (<i>b</i>. 1899), became a nun. Christopher's childhood was mainly spent at East Hendred in Berkshire. His mother died when he was eight, and he was sent away to the Benedictines' Ealing Priory School. His close schoolfriend Paul Beard, who with his wife, Elizabeth, became Sprigg's closest literary confidant and who edited the posthumous <span class="italic">Poems</span>, described Sprigg as greatly interested in both poetry and science even as a schoolboy.<br>
<br>Before he had reached fifteen Christopher Sprigg abruptly left school (family financial difficulties were rumoured, Stanhope Sprigg having lost his job at the <span class="italic">Express</span>), and moved with his father to Bradford, where Sprigg senior became literary editor of the <span class="italic">Yorkshire Observer</span>, and his son worked on that paper as a cub reporter. In 1925 Sprigg returned south to live with his elder brother, Theodore, and his wife, Vida, at Claygate, Surrey. He went through intensely religious phases&#151;though he lost his faith &#145;some time before 1932&#146;. His religious turmoils are a main subject of his poems, which he went on writing in spurts all his life. He never married.<br>
<br>Theodore Sprigg was the editor of <span class="italic">Airways</span>, the first British aeronautical monthly. Christopher threw himself into the burgeoning world of air-minded journalism, reviewing books and films for <span class="italic">Airways</span>, editing <span class="italic">Airways and Airports</span>, and writing short air stories for <span class="italic">Popular Flying</span>. He also found time to edit <span class="italic">British Malaya</span>. He wrote under a large roster of names&#151;including St John Lewis and Arthur Cave. Arthur Cave's stories in <span class="italic">Popular Flying</span> were, said Captain W. E. Johns, author of the famous Biggles air-novels, &#145;some of the best short air stories that have ever been written&#146;.<br>
<br>The Sprigg brothers were busy entrepreneurs, founding Airways Publications Ltd, running an air press agency, starting up <span class="italic">Aeromarine Advertising</span>, editing the short-lived <span class="italic">Work and Opportunities: the National Advertiser of British Training and Service</span>. Very keen, too, on motor cars, Sprigg patented in 1930 a variable-speed gear that attracted praise from the motor industry. But his main source of income in the early 1930s&#151;the many Sprigg commercial enterprises having collapsed by then&#151;was writing. He became, essentially, a full-time freelance. He had learned to fly at Brooklands Aero Club, and he produced popular flying handbooks&#151;<span class="italic">Fly with Me</span> (1932), <span class="italic">Let's Learn to Fly</span> (1937)&#151;and pot-boiling celebrations of air achievements: <span class="italic">The Airship</span> (1931), <span class="italic">British Airways</span> (1934), <span class="italic">Great Flights</span> (1935). He wrote non-stop, not least a sequence of trashy and patently money-spinning thrillers (some of them, he claimed, knocked off in a fortnight or so each): <span class="italic">Crime in Kensington</span> (1933), <span class="italic">Fatality in Fleet Street</span> (1933), <span class="italic">The Perfect Alibi</span> (1934), <span class="italic">Death of an Airman</span> (1934), <span class="italic">Death of a Queen</span> (1935). <span class="italic">The Six Queer Things: Uncanny Stories</span>, edited by Sprigg, came out posthumously in 1937. But by 1935 this autodidactic hack writer, a relentless wide-reader (he was a keen member of the London Library), endlessly curious about the new sciences, especially psychology, psychiatry, anthropology, modern biology, and quantum physics, was turning to political science and educating himself in socialist texts. All on his own he became a Marxist.<br>
<br>In mid-1935, in Porthleven, Cornwall, this embryonic Marxist started a book to be called <span class="italic">Verse and Mathematics</span> (&#145;a study in the Foundation of Poetry&#146;). In November of that year Sprigg left his brother's house in Surrey to live in Poplar, in the East End of London, telling Theodore this was to seek local colour for his fiction, but actually intending to share in the proletarian life his new politics were driving him to value. He joined the Poplar branch of the Communist Party. He started learning Russian with an eye to visiting the Soviet Union. He stopped writing every day at 5 p.m. to go out on party work, flyposting, speaking on street corners, selling the <span class="italic">Daily Worker</span>. His (mainly dock worker) comrades soon lost their suspicions of this loquacious, bourgeois, horse-riding writer ally. He became their delegate on the Poplar Peace Pledge Union council. He was completely unknown to party headquarters in King Street, Covent Garden. He attended some lectures by party intellectuals&#151;Douglas Garman and Alick West&#151;but steered clear of their &#145;verbosity and dogmatism&#146;.<br>
<br>But in addition to his journalism and the rest, by which he &#145;scratched a living&#146;, Sprigg was engaged on the serious work which distinguished him as perhaps British communism's sharpest intellectual of his time. He wrote plays and sub-Kafkaesque short stories, polishing and splitting up <span class="italic">Verse and Mathematics</span> into what became <span class="italic">Illusion and Reality</span> and <span class="italic">The Crisis in Physics</span>. <span class="italic">Illusion and Reality</span> was the first extended British attempt at a Marxist analysis of art, self, and literary history. It was conceptually rough-edged, but impressively ambitious and always suggestive, for all its adherence to Moscow's line on socialist realism and the abhorrence of modernism and popular culture. <span class="italic">The Crisis in Physics</span> boldly linked epistemological problems in science with the perceived threat to bourgeois economics. He also composed the wonderfully alert essays on aesthetics, bourgeois biology, modern thinkers, and cultic heroes (including the especially fine pieces on George Bernard Shaw, D. H. Lawrence, and T. E. Lawrence, comparable in many ways with the essays of the great German Marxist Walter Benjamin) which became <span class="italic">Studies in a Dying Culture</span> and <span class="italic">Further Studies in a Dying Culture</span>. In February 1936 the novel <span class="italic">This my Hand</span> appeared, as by Christopher Caudwell, becoming the only book so to appear in Sprigg's lifetime. It attempted, somewhat weakly, to add social engagement to his crime mode (the usual extreme violences are afforced by some religious and political background analyses, earnest psychologizings, and sentiments against capital punishment). It shows little promise for any future career that Caudwell might have had as a writer of Marxized genre fiction.<br>
<br>Meanwhile practical politics were commanding the attention of Spriggy, as his comrades knew him. In March 1936 he was made branch secretary. He visited Paris to see the new popular front government at first hand. In London he was arrested and beaten up by police while scuffling with Mosley's fascists in Victoria Park, Hackney. When the Spanish Civil War broke out in July 1936 he was, in common with all 1930s leftists, quite magnetized by its significance. In December that year he answered the party's call for all able-bodied men to go and fight for the Spanish republican cause. He drove to Spain the vehicle Poplar people had purchased as an ambulance (usefully this bourgeois communist possessed a passport). Once in Spain he joined up with the International Brigades, trained as a machine-gunner at Albacete, became a machine-gun instructor and group political delegate, and edited a wall-newspaper. Early in February 1937 he and his battalion moved up to the Jarama River in the defence of Madrid. On the afternoon of the chaotic first day of the Jarama battle, 12 February 1937, Sprigg died covering a retreat by his company in the face of overwhelming fascist force. His body was never recovered. The faithful Theodore had tried to have the party in London recall his brother from dangerous action as a valuable intellectual, and did eventually succeed in that by showing General-Secretary Harry Pollitt the proofs of <span class="italic">Illusion and Reality</span>. The telegram summoning Sprigg home arrived just too late.<br>
<br>Paul Beard's selection from the many poems Sprigg wrote appeared in 1939. By then the name Christopher Caudwell had begun to be known&#151;through <span class="italic">Illusion and Reality</span> (1937), <span class="italic">Studies in a Dying Culture</span> (1938), and <span class="italic">The Crisis in Physics</span> (1939). Caudwell's <span class="italic">Further Studies in a Dying Culture</span> was published in 1948. He was Britain's foremost pioneer of Marxist literary theory, and gradually his renown as an inspiring, if never not chaotic cultural analyst, spread across the world. A <span class="italic">Collected Poems</span> came out in 1986, edited by Alan Young, as did a collection of previously unpublished manuscripts, <span class="italic">Scenes and Actions</span>, edited by Jean Duport and David Margolies.<br>
