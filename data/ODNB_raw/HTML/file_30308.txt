<span class="headword">Zukertort,  John Hermann</span>  (1842&#150;1888), <span class="occ">chess player</span>, was born on 7 September 1842, probably at Lublin in Russian Poland, the son of a converted Jew, who had been a protestant pastor of very humble means. In 1855 he entered the <i>Gymnasium</i> at Breslau in Silesia, and in 1861 he was transferred to the university, whence (he said later) he graduated after a full course in medicine in 1866, serving with the medical corps of the German army in the campaign of that year and in 1870&#150;71. It seems generally agreed, however, that his account of this period was exaggerated and that his interest in chess prevented completion of his degree. He learned chess at Breslau in 1861, entering for a handicap tourney in that year, and losing every game that he played, although he received the odds of the queen. He now purchased Bilguer's <span class="italic">Handbook</span> and studied the game.<br>
<br>Before the close of 1862 Zukertort encountered Adolf Anderssen, receiving the odds of the knight, and won a number of games. Henceforth, as Anderssen's most talented pupil, he began to meet first-class players on equal terms. By 1867 he was known as one of the strongest players in north Germany, and assumed the editorship (at first in conjunction with Anderssen and afterwards alone) of the <span class="italic">Neue Berliner Schachzeitung</span>, which had been founded by Neumann and Suhle after the retirement of P. Hirschfeld from the editorship of the Leipzig <span class="italic">Schachzeitung</span>. In this he published a number of brilliant games and new variations of the openings, representing the strategic school of that period. During the previous two years he had joined Jean Dufresne in editing the invaluable <span class="italic">Grosses Schach-Handbuch</span> (see Van der Linde, <span class="italic">Geschichte und Litteratur des Schachspiels</span>, 1874, 2.23&#150;4). In 1871 he defeated Anderssen in a set match, and at the close of the same year the <span class="italic">Neue Berliner Schachzeitung</span> collapsed.<br>
<br>Early in 1872 Zukertort arrived in Britain by invitation of the St George's chess club, and in the tourney of that year he won the third prize (Wilhelm Steinitz taking the first and J. H. Blackburne, the second). It has been disputed whether he was naturalized, but he was thereafter regarded as an English representative in all contests abroad. The rapid strides that he made as an exponent of the game between 1872 and 1878 were attributed by him to the advantage derived from his &#145;assimilation of English characteristics&#146;, steadying his natural nervousness somewhat.<br>
<br>From 1873 to 1876 Zukertort contributed to the <span class="italic">Westminster Papers</span> (the official organ of the St George's club). In 1878 he won the first prize at the Paris Exhibition tournament, after a tie-match with Winawer. In September 1879, in conjunction with Leopold Hoffer, he founded and co-edited <span class="italic">Chess Monthly</span>, which continued for seventeen years to be the leading chess magazine. In March 1881 he captained the City of London club in its match with the rival St George's club, and later in the year was second to Blackburne in the Berlin tournament. He defeated Blackburne (1881) and the brilliant Paris master Rosenthal (1880) in two matches, annotating the games with an elaboration hitherto unknown in chess periodicals. In 1882 he shared the third position in the Vienna tournament.<br>
<br>In 1883 Zukertort achieved one of the great objects of his ambition by triumphing over Steinitz&#151;possibly precipitating the latter's piqued emigration to the USA&#151;and winning the first prize of &pound;300 in the London international chess tournament, in which Steinitz came second and Blackburne third. This tournament, which was the first important gathering of the kind held in London since 1862, took place at the Victoria Hall in the Criterion between 26 April and 21 June 1883. During the first six weeks of the tournament Zukertort achieved a record in first-class chess by winning twenty-two games to one defeat, showing in the performance a combination of brilliance, energy, and accuracy unequalled by any great master hitherto. His games against Winawer (of Warsaw) and Rosenthal (of Paris) were of the very highest order, while that against Blackburne, played on 5 May, was, in Steinitz's opinion, &#145;one of the most brilliant games on record&#146;. But the master's nervous energy had been maintained only by recourse to opiates, leading to a breakdown on 7 June. On that day he made an elementary blunder in his game with Mackenzie, and on the two following days he was successively defeated by the weakest players in the tournament, fortunately only after his position as winner of the first prize had been assured. He never fully recovered the extraordinary mental vigour that he had exhibited during the early part of the London tournament.<br>
<br>Contrary to medical advice, Zukertort persisted in accepting the challenge of Steinitz to an &#145;international match&#146;&#151;subsequently regarded as a world championship match to which Steinitz was provoked by his tournament defeat&#151;the conditions of which (including the innovative use of time limits) were highly unfavourable to a man of his nervous temperament. He could not afford to lose the &pound;400 staked. Twenty games were to be played, at New York, St Louis, and New Orleans. The British chess club entertained him in London in November 1885, before his departure. He won four out of the first five games, but was crushed by ten games to five (with five draws) before the match ended at New Orleans on 29 March 1886. &#145;He returned from the States a broken-down man. His nerves seemed overstrained, an impediment in his speech was noticeable, and he had not the energy to rouse himself from a kind of mental torpor&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Field</span>, 71 1888, 905).<br>
<br>Zukertort lost a short match with Blackburne (1887); more hopefully, in the summer handicap of the British chess club (1888) he headed the list, but on 19 June, while playing at Simpson's chess divan, he had a stroke. He was moved to Charing Cross Hospital and died there on 20 June 1888. He left two young daughters, who later returned to Germany. He was buried at Brompton cemetery on 26 June, when most of the prominent British chess players were represented at his graveside. From 1878 to 1883, said <span class="italic">The Times</span> justly, in an obituary notice, &#145;Dr. Zukertort was considered by many to have attained a degree of excellence in chess that has never been exceeded&#146;  (21 June 1888, 9).<br>
<br>Zukertort was a clever conversationalist and linguist (speaking English like a native), with a marvellous memory and a large store of general information (not always strictly accurate). His memory, it was said, failed him only when he had to answer a letter or keep an appointment; consequently he was known as &#145;the late Dr Zukertort&#146;. At the chess-board it was impossible to gather from his countenance whether he was winning or losing, for he presented in either case the picture of abject misery, clutching his head in his hands. His gaunt, haggard, and &#145;corrugated&#146; appearance was well conveyed by a pen-and-ink caricature which appeared in the <span class="italic">Westminster Papers</span> (1 June 1876). At New York in 1886 he was described as illustrating nerves, while Steinitz illustrated solidity.<br>
<br>As a blindfold player Zukertort was not surpassed even by Blackburne, and as an analyst he probably had no equal. His annotations upon the Morphy&#150;Anderssen match in the pages of the <span class="italic">Chess Monthly</span> were a revelation, entirely superseding the previous analysis by Loewenthal. His knowledge of the openings was exhaustive, and his analyses of the Evans, Muzio, and Allgaier gambits completely altered long-established opinions as to their value. Very few British players equalled Zukertort in devotion and service to the game of which he was such a brilliant exponent.<br>
