<span class="headword">Dicconson,  Edward</span>  (1670&#150;1752), <span class="occ">vicar apostolic of the northern district</span>, was born on 30 November 1670 at Wrightington Hall, near Wigan, Lancashire, being the third son of Hugh Dicconson (<i>c</i>.1621&#150;1691) of Wrightington Hall and his wife, Agnes (<i>d</i>. 1719), daughter of Roger Kirkby of Kirkby in that county. His family were Jacobites. His eldest brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/65475/', "William Dicconson")</script>, followed James II to St Germain and became tutor to the exiled king's son and treasurer to the exiled queen. His elder brother, Roger, joined the 1715 rising. He was educated in the English College at Douai from 1683, and at the end of his course of philosophy, in 1691, returned to England. Subsequently he resumed his studies at Douai, where he took the oath on 8 March 1699. He took priest's orders, became procurator of the college in 1701, and in 1708&#150;9 was professor of syntax and a senior. In 1709&#150;10 he was professor of poetry and in 1711&#150;12 professor of philosophy. He was made vice-president and professor of theology in 1713&#150;14. He assisted Charles Dodd, alias Hugh Tootell, in the preparation of his <span class="italic">Church History of England</span> (3 vols., 1737&#150;42), copying for him most of the records of the Douai College. In 1719 he went to Paris to deal with the college funds invested there but failed in a bid to profit from the Mississippi Bubble. At some point he was awarded the degree of DD. His career involved him in the struggle between the secular clergy, to which he belonged, and the regulars, including the Benedictines, the Franciscans, and the Jesuits, for control of the English mission. The opponents of the secular clergy sought to brand them as Gallicans, lacking in complete respect for papal authority, and as Jansenists, holding heretical views on moral and dogmatic theology. He defended the English College at Douai against the charge of Jansenism by securing the replacement of their accuser as visitor, and himself accepted the papal condemnation of Jansenism by the papal bull <span class="italic">Unigenitus</span> of 1713.<br>
<br>Despite a stammer, which made preaching difficult, and his desire for a continental benefice, Dicconson left the college at Douai to serve the English mission on 30 July 1720, having been invited by Peter Giffard to take the ministerial charge at Chillington, Staffordshire. While there he was Bishop Stonor's principal adviser and vicar-general. Afterwards he was sent to Rome as agent-extraordinary of the secular clergy of England. He failed to secure the replacement of the Jesuit superior of the English College at Rome by a secular, but he did succeed in obtaining a ruling that the Franciscans should observe Innocent XII's decree of 1696 requiring the regulars to seek the approbation of the vicars apostolic before accepting appointments on the English mission. On the death of Bishop Thomas Williams he was nominated vicar apostolic of the northern district of England by Benedict XIV in September 1740, and he was consecrated on 19 March 1741 to the see of Mallus <i>in partibus infidelium</i> by the bishop of Ghent. Proceeding to his vicariate he fixed his residence at a place belonging to his family called Finch Mill (now demolished), in Appley Bridge, Shevington, near Wrightington. Hence he was sometimes jokingly called the Auditor of the Rota (after the head of a Roman ecclesiastical court, <i>rota</i> being the Latin for mill). Together with the other vicars apostolic he obtained from Benedict XIV in 1753 the brief <span class="italic">Apostolicum ministerium</span>, regulating the English mission along the lines already laid down in 1698 and confirmed by the brief <span class="italic">Emanavit nuper</span> of 1748: the regulars were required to secure the approbation of the vicars apostolic before accepting appointments on the English mission.<br>
<br>Dicconson died at Finch Mill on 5 May 1752, and was buried in the private chapel attached to St Wilfrid's, the parish church of Standish, near Wigan. His monument, inscribed with his full episcopal style and carved with his arms, crozier, and mitre, is unusual, if not unique, in being on the wall of the chancel. Francis Petre was his successor in the northern vicariate. Dicconson's diary, covering ten years at Douai, has been published. His manuscripts include a detailed account of his agency in Rome, together with reports and other documents relating to the state of his vicariate. These papers provide a useful source for the study of the English Catholic church in the eighteenth century. His library is now at Ushaw College, Durham.<br>
