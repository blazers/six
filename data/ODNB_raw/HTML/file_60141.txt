<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Troup, Sir  Charles Edward</span>  (1857&#150;1941), <span class="occ">civil servant</span>, was born on 27 March 1857 at Bogie Street, Huntly, Aberdeenshire, the eldest son of the Revd Robert Troup, minister of the Independent church, and his wife, Margaret (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Macdonald). He was educated at a parish school, at Aberdeen University, whence he graduated MA with a first-class degree in mental philosophy, and at Oxford University, where he matriculated as an exhibitioner at Balliol College in January 1880, and graduated BA in 1883. In his final year at Oxford he won the Cobden prize of &pound;20 and a silver medal for an essay entitled &#145;In what respects on purely economic grounds is the further application of a free trade policy required in the legislation of this country&#146;. In 1884 this was published as <span class="italic">Future of Free Trade</span>.<br>
<br>Troup joined the Home Office as a junior clerk in the criminal department in October 1880. He was the first such recruit to be selected through open competition. Though he soon assumed responsibility within the department, his promotion was at first slow. Not until 1886 was he appointed senior clerk, even though he had for some time been performing the duties of a senior clerk. In 1887 he joined the newly created parliamentary branch within the general department, and became responsible for monitoring and evaluating parliamentary bills relating to Home Office business. Troup was called to the bar at the Middle Temple in 1888 and though he never practised law, he developed a &#145;passion&#146; for the legal work of the Home Office  (Petrow, 29). As editor of the judicial statistics of England and Wales between 1893 and 1904, he did much to reform the collation and analysis of Home Office statistics. Under his influence the judicial statistics changed from being among the worst in Europe to among the best. In 1893&#150;4 he chaired a Home Office committee on the identification of habitual criminals, which recommended using photographs, fingerprints, and anthropometric data to assist the identification of convicts and repeat offenders. In 1896 he became principal clerk in the new industrial and parliamentary department. As such, he was responsible for factories and workshops, mines and quarries, and a substantial statistics sub-branch.<br>
<br>Shortly after his promotion Troup married, on 2 January 1897, Winifred Louisa Macdonald, youngest daughter of the poet and novelist Dr George Macdonald and a relative of Troup's mother. They had no children. In 1902 he chaired the departmental committee on cremation that drafted regulations under the <span class="roman">Cremation Act</span>. In the following year he was appointed assistant under-secretary, in which position he was responsible for police and criminal work. He took a special interest in these aspects of Home Office business while permanent under-secretary between 1908 and 1922. He played an important part in settling the police strikes of 1918&#150;19; when serious unrest within the metropolitan force developed during August 1918, however, he was absent from the Home Office on a walking holiday in Berkshire. In a display either of the &#145;ultra-calm&#146; for which he was renowned, or of folly bordering on the negligent, he ignored repeated pleas to return to London to take charge, and returned only on 30 August, by which time the strike was almost solid. As permanent under-secretary he sat on two royal commissions. During the First World War, Troup had important responsibilities on the home front, and was on the departmental committee responsible for enforcing regulations under the <span class="roman">Defence of the Realm Act</span>. He was made CB (civil) in 1897, KCB in 1909, and KCVO in 1918. The University of Aberdeen awarded him an honorary LLD in 1912.<br>
<br>Troup, a man of &#145;rugged Scottish countenance&#146;  (Butler, 110), was &#145;probably the most capable&#146; of those who joined the Home Office with the advent of competitive entry  (Pellew, 42). A contemporary praised him as a &#145;selfless worker&#146; whose minutes were &#145;models of exactitude, lucidity, and precision&#146;  (Redmayne, 139). Efficient, intellectually able, and personally confident, Troup was a civil servant of &#145;manifold talents&#146;  (Radzinowicz and Hood, 106). As Troup's obituary in <span class="italic">The Times</span> (26 September 1941) pointed out, he was a civil servant &#145;of exceptional character and ability, to whom the public of his day owed much and of whom, largely through his own modesty, it knew little&#146;. Given the unrest from suffragettes and militant trade unionism, the Home Office, never an easy department to handle, went through a period of special difficulty while Troup was permanent under-secretary. His influence was crucial in extending Home Office authority over local police authorities and in co-ordinating police powers to cope with industrial unrest. In December 1919 he shrewdly told General McCready that in the next strike special constables would be appointed, so that the military could be held in reserve, commenting that &#145;the one thing to avoid is the appearance of setting labour and the middle classes against one another&#146;  (Morgan, 94). He had scant respect for the idle time-servers who dominated the Home Office clerkships at the time of his appointment. Unlike this older generation of clerks, all too ready to shirk responsibility, he was eager to expand the Home Office's responsibilities and workload and to take on burdensome and complex work. He also recognized the importance of the personal touch, maintaining close contact with his staff and scrupulous in keeping their work up to standard. His one possible flaw as a civil servant was a certain narrowness of vision&#151;related, perhaps, to his inexperience outside the world of bureaucracy.<br>
<br>After he retired from the civil service, Troup published a respected volume on the Home Office in the <span class="roman">Whitehall</span> series (1925). He found a new career as treasurer of King's College, London (1922&#150;39), and served on several public bodies, chairing the tribunal on the Royal Irish Constabulary (1922&#150;3), the Safety in Mines Research Board (1923&#150;39), and the Ministry of Pensions' special grants committee (1929&#150;38). He died from arterio-sclerosis at his home, 13 Addison Road, Kensington, London, on 8 July 1941 and was cremated at Golders Green on 10 July. His wife survived him.<br>
