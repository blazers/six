<span class="headword">Clarke,  Maude Violet</span>  (1892&#150;1935), <span class="occ">historian</span>, was born in Belfast on 7 May 1892, the second child and only daughter of Richard James Clarke (1856&#150;1953), rector of Trinity Church, Belfast, and his wife, Anne Frances Nugent Jessop (<i>d</i>. 1942), daughter of John Thomas Jessop of Mount Jessop, co. Longford. In 1903 her father (later archdeacon of Connor) accepted the living of Carnmoney on the outskirts of the city, and there, in an atmosphere of religion and scholarship, Maude and her three brothers grew up. She was initially educated in Belfast, and then at the Alexandra School and College, Dublin. She read history at Queen's University, Belfast, taking a first-class degree in 1913. She then went with a scholarship to Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford, where she was awarded a first in modern history in 1915.<br>
<br>In 1916 Clarke returned to Queen's University, Belfast, where she deputized for F. M. Powicke, the professor of modern history, for three years. She was appointed history tutor at Somerville College, Oxford, in 1919, a move from &#145;the selfish intrigues of a provincial university, demoralised by the war&#146; which she likened to &#145;coming from darkness to daylight&#146;  (Adams, 155). The rest of her life was divided between Coole Glebe (her father's rectory) and Somerville College, of which she became a fellow in 1922. She was appointed a university lecturer in 1930. Her witty tongue masked a deeply religious nature and an iron will, and she made an indelible impression on her students and contemporaries, living a free social life and extending open hospitality to a wide circle of friends.<br>
<br>Clarke made for herself in these years a many-sided reputation as a college tutor and administrator, lecturer, and scholar. At a time when the history profession was still predominantly male, Clarke distinguished herself as a medievalist in a series of influential articles, including &#145;Irish parliaments in the reign of Edward II&#146; (1926), &#145;The Wilton diptych&#146; (1931), and &#145;The origin of impeachment&#146; (1934). A collection of her papers was published posthumously as <span class="italic">Fourteenth Century Studies</span> (1937), edited by two of her former pupils, Lucy Sutherland and May McKisack. Her important study of the <i>modus tenendi parliamentum</i> was finished shortly before her death and published in 1936 as <span class="italic">Medieval Representation and Consent</span>. Her work was widely accepted and became part of the mainstream in the understanding of the fourteenth century. Colleagues and contemporaries regretted that her early death prevented her from undertaking a projected history of England in the fourteenth century.<br>
<br>Maude Clarke was influential at Somerville, where &#145;her strong sense of constitutional propriety&#146;  (Adams, 73) was a distinctive legacy to the college's governance. In 1933 she was appointed vice-principal, but in the same year was stricken by cancer. She continued to work, and her resignation in 1935 on grounds of ill health was refused; she took sabbatical leave instead. She died in her father's house at Coole Glebe, Carnmoney, on 17 November 1935. A visiting professorship at Queen's University, Belfast, bears her name.<br>
