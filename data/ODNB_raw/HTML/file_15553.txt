<span class="headword">King,  Charles</span>  (1687&#150;1748), <span class="occ">organist and composer</span>, the son of Charles and Mary King, was born at Bury St Edmunds in 1687; since the boy was not baptized until 5 June 1693 it may perhaps be assumed that his parents were nonconformists. If so, the baptism probably took place simply to secure his admission, as a treble, to the choir of St Paul's Cathedral, London, where he would have been trained initially by John Blow and later by Jeremiah Clarke, to whom he was subsequently apprenticed. When his voice broke King evidently stayed on as a supernumerary singer, at a salary of &pound;14 per annum. On 12 July 1707 he took the degree of BMus at Oxford, and three months later (on 14 October) he married Clarke's sister, Ann, in the cathedral, the service being taken by the Revd Sampson Estwick, one of the minor canons and himself a very respectable musician. On 1 December his brother-in-law put a pistol to his head, and very shortly afterwards King succeeded him as almoner and master of the choristers, but not as organist. Curiously, however, he was not formally admitted a vicar-choral until 1730. Meanwhile he had also (in 1715) become organist of St Benet Fink, which post he continued to hold until 1747 when he was dismissed (for dereliction of duties, it may be supposed). When Clarke died it fell to King to see his book of <span class="italic">Choice Lessons for the Harpsichord or Spinett</span> (1711) through the press.<br>
<br>King himself produced almost no instrumental music, but he was a considerable composer of services and anthems; indeed, he wrote more service settings than any other composer of the period, which fact apparently gave rise to his colleague Maurice Greene's witty description of him as &#145;a very serviceable man&#146;  (Bumpus, <span class="italic">Organists</span>, 81). Autograph copies of most of these, many of them dated, are now in the library of the Royal Academy of Music, London. But &#145;featureless competence&#146;, as Ian Spink nicely puts it, &#145;is the level of King's achievement&#146;  (Spink, 302). As almoner and master of the choristers of St Paul's, he had many promising chorister pupils, the most distinguished of whom were Maurice Greene, John Alcock, and William Boyce. Why then he should have wished to become music master of Christ's Hospital in 1720 is something of a mystery. In 1725 King served as master of a short-lived lodge of freemasons which met at the Ship without Temple Bar; in January of the following year he was (with Estwick) one of the thirteen original members of the Academy of Vocal (later Ancient) Music, and it may possibly have been for this body that his two surviving secular vocal works were written. One is a setting of part of Dryden's ode for St Cecilia's day (&#145;'Twas at the royal feast&#146;) first set by Jeremiah Clarke in 1697, the other a <span class="italic">Dialogue between Oliver Cromwell and Charon</span> dated 1731.<br>
<br>It is not known when his wife died, but King later contracted a second marriage which is said (by Bumpus) to have brought him a fortune of &pound;7000 and a villa at Hampton Court later owned by David Garrick. His second wife predeceased him. King died in London on 17 March 1748 and was buried in the church of St Benet Paul's Wharf on the 25th (and not in Hampton parish church as Bumpus, in his book on the organists of St Paul's, earlier maintained).<br>
