<span class="headword">Malcolm II</span> <span class="st"> [Mael Coluim mac Cinaeda]</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1034), <span class="occ">king of Scots</span>, was the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15399/', "Kenneth II (d. 995)")</script>; his mother was possibly a daughter of a U&iacute; D&uacute;nlainge king of Leinster. Having challenged his cousin <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15400/', "Kenneth III")</script> for the kingship, and killed him at the battle of Monzievaird in Strathearn (now Perthshire) in 1005, he reigned for nearly thirty years and at his death he was described by a contemporary annalist as &#145;the honour of all the west of Europe&#146;  (Anderson, <span class="italic">Early Sources</span>, 1.572). A fourteenth-century law tract bears the title <span class="italic">Leges Malcolmi MacKenneth</span>, but has no genuine connection with Malcolm II.<br>
<br>Malcolm was known to medieval chroniclers as &#145;the most victorious&#146;  (Anderson, <span class="italic">Early Sources</span>, 1.573). His martial record was, however, patchy. He won a famous and decisive victory over Uhtred, earl of Northumbria, at Carham on the Tweed in 1018. As a result Earl Uhtred's brother, and successor as earl, formally recognized Malcolm's possession of all of Northumbria as far as the Tweed, which remained part of the Scottish kingdom's territories thereafter. At the beginning of his reign, however, Malcolm had invaded Northumbria and laid siege unsuccessfully to Durham in 1006. He was repulsed and suffered a crushing defeat at the hands of Earl Uhtred. There are unsubstantiated late accounts of Malcolm defeating Danes in battle, which associate his creation of a bishop's see at Mortlach in what later became Banffshire&#151;from where it was moved by David I to Aberdeen&#151;with one of these victories. An Anglo-Danish invasion which did not culminate in a famous victory for Malcolm was that of Cnut in 1031&#150;2, after which Malcolm II was obliged to submit to Cnut, along with Macbeth, king of Moray, and another unidentified king (possibly of the Isles). By this time Malcolm may have become master of the kingdom of Strathclyde. The last recorded king of the Strathclyde royal dynasty was Owen the Bald, who fought with Malcolm at the battle of Carham and died soon afterwards in 1018. The history of Strathclyde is uncertain thereafter. It has been suggested that <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8209/', "Duncan I")</script> was appointed king by his grandfather Malcolm II on Owen's death. This is unlikely, however, because Duncan (who does not appear in the submission to Cnut in 1031&#150;2) was regarded by contemporaries as a young man at his death in 1040. Perhaps Malcolm seized the kingship of Strathclyde for himself while at the zenith of his power following the battle of Carham.<br>
<br>Little is known of Scotland's internal affairs during Malcolm's reign. Although it has been argued that he was responsible for developing a network of thanages throughout his kingdom and even into Moray, these may have been much more ancient in origin, and in any case it is far from certain that Malcolm was in a position to dominate Moray. Findlaech mac Ruaidr&iacute; (<i>d</i>. 1020) and Mael Coluim mac Ma&iacute;l Br&iacute;gte (<i>d</i>. 1029), successive rulers of Moray, are both described in their obits in a (probably) contemporary source as &#145;king of Scotland&#146;, which may suggest that Malcolm's own position in his kingdom was under threat from the north, perhaps after the d&eacute;b&acirc;cle of the campaign against Durham in 1006, and again in the 1020s.<br>
<br>Malcolm's successful bid for the throne in 1005 may have ushered in a period of dynastic stability. At the end of his reign, however, strife within the royal kindred was certainly renewed, resulting in Malcolm II having the grandson of Boite mac Cinaeda (probably Malcolm's brother) killed in 1033. Malcolm was doubtless already an old man, and he died at Glamis on 25 November the following year. A late source claims that he was assassinated. It is also alleged that his body was taken to Iona for burial. With his death the male lineage of Kenneth I relinquished the kingship it had held continuously since 889 and had fashioned into the kingdom of &#145;Scotland&#146;, Alba. It is said, on the strength of the killing of the grandson of Boite, that Malcolm II in his final years was paving the way for the succession of his grandson Duncan I. It is possible, however, that in killing Boite's grandson he was simply beating off a challenge to his own position.<br>
<br>It is not known whether Malcolm had any sons, but he may have had as many as three daughters. The only one whose name in known is Beth&oacute;c, who married Cr&iacute;n&aacute;n, abbot of Dunkeld (<i>d</i>. 1045). Their son was Duncan I, who succeeded Malcolm as king. Another daughter of Malcolm married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/49270/', "Sigurd (II) Hl&#246;dvisson, earl of Orkney (d. 1014)")</script>, whose son was Thorfinn the Mighty, earl of Orkney. The evidence for Malcolm's third daughter is late and uncertain. She is alleged to have married Findlaech mac Ruaidr&iacute; king of Moray, whose son <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17356/', "Macbeth (d. 1057)")</script> succeeded Duncan I as king of Scots in 1040.<br>
