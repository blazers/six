<div class="para">
<span class="headword">O'Leary,  Arthur</span>  (1729&#150;1802), <span class="occ">Roman Catholic priest and religious controversialist</span>, was born at Acres, a townland in the parish of Fanlobbus, near Dunmanway, co. Cork, to a tenant farming couple about whom nothing is known. Having been provided with the rudiments of a classical education at a local &#145;hedge school&#146; O'Leary was obliged by the prohibition on Catholic education to leave Ireland for France to train for the priesthood. He entered the Capuchin college at St Malo in 1747 and was admitted to orders some time later. One of his first duties was as chaplain to the prisons and hospitals in St Malo during the Seven Years' War, when he ministered to British and Irish prisoners of war. Invited by the duc de Choiseul to encourage the Catholics among their number to transfer their allegiance to France, O'Leary declined because, he later maintained, he &#145;thought it a crime to engage the king of England's soldiers and sailors in the service of a Catholic monarch against their Protestant sovereign&#146;  (Buckley, 18). It was an emblematic moment in O'Leary's life and a pointer to his later advocacy of religious toleration.<h2>
<a name="Emergenceasapublicfigure"></a>Emergence as a public figure</h2>O'Leary returned to Ireland in 1771, having spent twenty-four years in France. Following his return he ministered for a number of years in Cork, where he was an energetic addition to the local Capuchin community. His most notable achievement was the construction of a small place of worship, long known as Father O'Leary's chapel, on a site adjoining Blackamoor Lane friary but he also attracted large congregations on account of his preaching, which was chiefly remarkable for strong moral reasoning, bold figure, and scriptural allusion. In 1775 Patrick Blair, a Scottish physician resident at Cork, published a tract entitled <span class="italic">Thoughts on Nature and Religion</span>, in which he challenged several key articles of Christianity, including the divinity of Christ; O'Leary responded with a combative defence of the doctrinal foundations of religion, entitled <span class="italic">A Defence of the Divinity of Christ and the Immortality of the Soul</span> (1776). Though it was unusual for Catholic priests, especially regulars, to engage in public disputation O'Leary tactfully informed the Church of Ireland ordinary of his intentions prior to entering into print. He also attempted to bring all believers on side by affirming general Christian principles as distinct from specifically Catholic principles, against the negative observations of sceptics, deists, and freethinkers. He was helped by his lucid writing style and a capacity for argument, and his work earned him applause from all quarters. Encouraged by this he turned his attention to the disagreement between Catholics as to whether the oath of allegiance approved by the Irish parliament in 1774 was doctrinally sound. He had no doubts of this and, eager to promote religious toleration, he disregarded the reservations of the archbishop of Dublin, Dr John Carpenter, and produced a pamphlet entitled <span class="italic">Loyalty Asserted, or, The New Test Oath Vindicated</span>. For the first time he averred that it was the duty of Irish Catholic subjects not to engage in &#145;conspiracies and treasonable practices&#146; against their protestant king. He was sharply critical of the Stuarts, whose restoration would, he forecast, result in the &#145;aggravation of our yoke and new calamities&#146;. More daringly still he claimed that if Christians focused on that on which they were in agreement rather than on their differences, and emphasized charity as opposed to &#145;religious inflammation&#146; and &#145;evangelical spleen&#146;, it would ensure a welcome diminution in interdenominational dissension  (Buckley, 65&#150;9).<br>
<br>This advocacy of toleration was a radical message, given the depth of religious polarization in Ireland, and it enhanced O'Leary's reputation with Gallican Catholics and liberal protestants who were eager to foster interdenominational concord. However it was not until 1779, when the kingdom was gripped by rumours of a French invasion, that O'Leary achieved national renown, with <span class="italic">An Address to the Common People of the Roman Catholic Religion</span>, in which he urged Catholics to follow the example of their bishops and clergy and support the crown. A French invasion, O'Leary warned, would worsen the condition of the population and, if it brought about a reopening of the seventeenth-century land settlement, would threaten the &#145;free exercise of religion&#146; and the diminution of &#145;the unhappy spirit of persecution&#146;  (A. O'Leary, <span class="italic">Miscellaneous Tracts</span>, 1781, 104). The warm welcome afforded this address stood him in good stead in 1780 in his dispute with John Wesley over the latter's claim that &#145;an open toleration of the Popish religion is inconsistent with the safety of a free people and a Protestant government&#146;. Wesley justified his contention on the traditional ground that, since it was Catholic doctrine that &#145;no faith is to be kept with heretics&#146;, a protestant government could not safely &#145;tolerate or encourage Roman Catholics&#146; so long as they adhered to &#145;their intolerant, persecuting principles&#146;  (ibid., 4&#150;7). This restatement of traditional protestant anxieties concerning Roman Catholicism struck at the heart of the principles of toleration that O'Leary championed, and he responded combatively to what he denominated Wesley's &#145;false assertions&#146;. In a series of letters, first published in the <span class="italic">Freeman's Journal</span> in March 1780, he accused Wesley of seeking to &#145;haunt the living with the images of the dead&#146;  (ibid., 77&#150;8) before embarking on a measured but persuasive appeal for Christian toleration. It was an approach that served O'Leary well as it was he rather than Wesley that emerged from the dispute with an enhanced reputation. This gave his case for the repeal of the remainder of the penal laws against Catholics greater authority but, more significantly, it encouraged him to prepare a fuller statement of his views on religious toleration.<h2>
<a name="Apostleoftoleration"></a>Apostle of toleration</h2>O'Leary's <span class="italic">Essay on Toleration, or, Plea for Liberty of Conscience</span> (1780) was one of the most radical and compelling statements in favour of religious and political forbearance published in late eighteenth-century Ireland. Positing the thesis that reason as well as religion enjoined humanity to observe moderation O'Leary described the multiplicity of instances of persecution in history that were responsible for the premature death of &#145;fifty millions of human beings&#146; as a blight on humanity when &#145;true religion&#146; worked to mitigate and not to justify abuse. He went on to argue that the practice of &#145;true religion should be preserved and perpetuated by the same means that established it&#151;by preaching the Word of God, attended with prudence and discretion, the practice of all Christian virtues, boundless peace and charity&#146;  (A. O'Leary, <span class="italic">Miscellaneous Tracts</span>, 1781, 39). Indeed he cited Montesquieu in support of his contention that &#145;when many religions have got a footing in the state, they are to be tolerated&#146;. His willingness to criticize the leaders of the Christian churches who failed to conduct themselves according to these principles added weight to his argument, particularly in the Irish context, where his plea for the extension of &#145;all social benefits to &hellip; loyal subjects of every denomination&#146; stood out  (ibid., 80). The response to the tract was overwhelmingly positive, although by no means all its admirers embraced its radical implications. The high esteem with which O'Leary was regarded by liberal protestants is vividly illustrated by the decision of the patriot club, the Monks of St Patrick [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/96301', "Monks of the Screw")</script>], to admit him to honorary membership. Catholics were also pleased, as is demonstrated by the willingness of the Irish Catholic Committee to provide &pound;40 in 1781 to defray the cost of publishing a collected edition of O'Leary's writings and of the English Committee to distribute 100 copies gratis.<br>
<br>There was considerable speculation that O'Leary's allegiance to the Catholic church was less than secure because it was very unusual for Catholic priests to express publicly controversial opinions. His involvement with the campaign to safeguard the regular clergy against the threat of the imposition of new&#151;or the enforcement of existing legal&#151;restrictions in the early 1780s gave the lie to this suspicion; he was neither tempted to forsake the Catholic church nor interested in doing so. Indeed he looked with particular optimism to the future as the volunteer corps throughout most of the country admitted Catholics to membership; he became honorary chaplain of the radical Irish brigade, and the Ulster Volunteers pronounced publicly in favour of Catholic relief. His confidence in the volunteers was underlined by his presence at the opening of the grand national convention of volunteer delegates in Dublin in November 1783. However, the refusal of the delegates to promote Catholic enfranchisement, combined with allegations that the radicals who took control of the reform movement in 1784 sought to involve France, compelled him to rethink his attitude. He decided to yield to official blandishments and agreed to report on the activities of the Catholic advocates of parliamentary reform in return for pecuniary reward.<h2>
<a name="Controversialist"></a>Controversialist</h2>More than any other event in his life O'Leary's acceptance of government remuneration in 1784 shaped his posthumous reputation and prompted allegations that he was a &#145;Castle Catholic&#146;. It is indisputable that officials at Dublin Castle identified him as the means by which &#145;the real designs of the Catholics&#146;  (TNA: PRO, HO 100/14, fols. 123&#150;4) could be established and that he apparently agreed to do so in return for an annual payment of &pound;100. His motives are less clear. It is possible that he was drawn by the allure of financial security, since he was dependent on his position as a teacher of rhetoric at the Brunswick Street Academy in Cork, which he took up in 1783. If so it was not a prudent decision, as his failure to produce the required evidence caused officials quickly to lose confidence in him. O'Leary for his part appears to have concluded that what was asked of him was contrary to his commitment to the advancement of toleration. His relationship with Dublin Castle was both less consequential and less personally advantageous than has been suggested. More importantly the strong resistance shown by the Irish administration during the mid-1780s to further relief for Catholics convinced him that his hopes for early implementation of full religious toleration were unfounded. It took the public controversy generated by the Rightboy agrarian movement in Munster in the mid-1780s to disabuse him of the illusion that it was at all attainable.<br>
<br>Given the success of his inspirational appeal for calm in the face of a threatened French invasion in 1779 it was hardly surprising that O'Leary was invited by friends from co. Cork to make another appeal in 1786 as agrarian unrest gripped the southern half of the country. He responded with two addresses &#145;to the Common people&#146;, published in the <span class="italic">Cork Hibernian Chronicle</span> in February 1786, in which he appealed to the Rightboys to obey the law and to desist from violence. However, his observation that the Rightboys' actions were &#145;founded on poverty&#146;, that their mode of proceeding was &#145;moderate&#146;, that the manner in which the tithe was collected was &#145;oppressive&#146;, and that the Church of Ireland clergy were not free of responsibility was incautious  (A. O'Leary, <span class="italic">Mr O'Leary's Defence</span>, 1787, appx). And instead of a repetition of the warm welcome that greeted his 1779 intervention he was plunged into controversy as supporters of the Church of Ireland rushed to defend their church. O'Leary was disturbed by the vehemence of the criticism directed at him, since he had not set out to criticize the Church of Ireland. Moreover his remarks convinced many protestants that the Rightboys were part of a wider Catholic conspiracy to undermine the protestant constitution in church and state, and he was a prime target for the neo-conservative voices that were raised in support of a law and order response. His most passionate critic was Patrick Duigenan, who identified O'Leary&#151;&#145;the Fryar <i>with the barbarous surname</i>&#146;&#151;as the &#145;instructor of the peasantry in religion and politicks&#146;  (Theophilus, 17). This was both offensive and gratuitous but it struck home. Realizing that his hopes for religious toleration as well as his reputation had been severely set back O'Leary prepared a detailed response in which he amply defended himself against the allegations of his accusers. The most striking feature of his defence is his assertion that his critics were intolerant, because it bears witness to his disappointment at the palpable rise in interdenominational antagonism that took place in the mid-1780s. Liberal protestants, well disposed towards tithe reform, were more supportive but this was not enough to ease O'Leary's concerns. Dispirited by the rejection of his vision of a tolerant future he chose to leave Ireland in 1789 for the more congenial atmosphere of England, and he spent the remainder of his life in London.<h2>
<a name="London"></a>London</h2>O'Leary served as a chaplain to the Spanish embassy on his arrival in London. One of his colleagues was Thomas Hussey, later bishop of Waterford, but their relationship was difficult and was the subject of <span class="italic">Narrative of the Misunderstanding between the Rev. A. O'Leary and Rev Mr. Hussey</span> in 1791. O'Leary meanwhile was introduced by Edmund Burke to whig society. His natural bonhomie, abundance of anecdote, and skill as a conversationalist meant that he was a welcome guest even of the prince of Wales for reasons other than his reputation as an apostle of religious toleration. He attended meetings of the English Catholic Committee, although he was less than impressed by their readiness to describe themselves as &#145;Catholic Dissenters&#146;. His residence in London prompted further speculation in Ireland that he had accepted a pension of &pound;200 per annum from the government &#145;upon the secret condition that he should for the future withhold his pen, and reside no more in Ireland&#146;  (Buckley, 351). Successive biographers have argued that this was not so and, while the absence of a clear documentary trail would bear them out, one cannot entirely discount the fact that he was paid from the secret service list. There were also reports in the Irish press in 1790 that he had embraced protestantism, which he vigorously denied, since he never wavered in his belief that the Catholic church represented &#145;the right road to eternal life&#146;  (ibid., 326). Indeed his recognition that the Catholics of London were poorly served for churches prompted him to convert a large hall on Sutton Street, Soho Square, into a chapel that he named after St Patrick and from which he ministered for the remainder of his life. He was a popular preacher who, even when affirming the doctrines of the Catholic church, declined to criticize others. He was encouraged to take this line as much by his alarm at current events in France as by his continuing belief in the merits of religious toleration. His sympathies with the victims of the French Revolution prompted him to support and to promote the cause of &eacute;migr&eacute; loyalists in Great Britain and to warn against the example of France in his sermons. Persuaded that the revolutionaries were driven by &#145;irreligion and licentiousness&#146; he was induced by the mistreatment of Pope Pius VI to make a powerful attack, on 8 March 1797, on the &#145;licentious infidels&#146; whom he held responsible  (ibid., 341). This consolidated his reputation in England, which was affirmed further in 1799 when he offered an equally powerful panegyric to Pius VI on his death.<br>
<br>Understandably O'Leary was no less disturbed by the impact of the French Revolution on Ireland. He maintained that both the Catholic and protestant churches had &#145;everything to dread from the disciples of the New Philosophy, which has made rapid progress amongst their respective flocks&#146;  (Buckley, 375) and he was encouraged by this fact to welcome an Anglo-Irish legislative union when Pitt proposed it in 1799. In <span class="italic">Address to the Lords Spiritual and Temporal of Great Britain</span>, published in June 1800, he pronounced himself &#145;a friend to the Union&#146; because he believed it would &#145;close the tumultary scenes which have distracted my ill-fated country for ages, and make the natives, of every religious description, happy&#146;  (ibid., 372). His expectation, encouraged by Pitt, was that the early concession of Catholic emancipation would help, and he can only have been encouraged in this conviction by the criticism directed at him by Sir Richard Musgrave in his influential <span class="italic">Memoirs of Different Rebellions</span>. Though prompted by this experience to gather materials for a history of his own he was never to write such a work. He made his notes available to Francis Plowden shortly before his death, after a short illness, on 8 January 1802 at 45 Great Portland Street, London. The publication of the funeral oration and the erection of an impressive monument over his grave in St Pancras churchyard, where he was buried on 14 January, provided a final testament to the benign impact of a man who, throughout his life, believed that true religion &#145;instead of inspiring hatred and rancour, commands us to love&#146;  (ibid., 374).<br>
