<span class="headword">Hill, Sir  Dudley St Leger</span>  (1790&#150;1851), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, the eldest son of Dudley Hill, of Welsh descent, and his wife, the daughter of Colonel John Clarges, was born in co. Carlow, Ireland. He was appointed ensign in the 82nd regiment on 6 September 1804, and exchanged the year after into the 95th rifles. As lieutenant he accompanied his battalion to South America in 1806, volunteered for the forlorn hope at Montevideo, and commanded the scaling party that captured the north gate of the city in February 1807. He was wounded and taken prisoner in the subsequent attack on Buenos Aires in June. He accompanied his battalion to Portugal in 1808, was present at Roli&ccedil;a and Vimeiro, was wounded at Benevente, and was present at Corunna. Returning to Portugal in 1809, he was present at the battle of Talavera and the operations on the Coa.<br>
<br>In July 1810 Hill was promoted to a company in the Royal West India rangers, but remained attached to the 95th until appointed to the Portuguese army. He commanded a wing of the Lusitanian legion at Busaco in September 1810, and a half-battalion with some British light companies at Fuentes d'O&ntilde;oro in May 1811. He commanded the 8th Portuguese <i>ca&ccedil;adores</i> at the storming of Badajoz in April 1812, at the battle of Salamanca in July, and in the Burgos retreat, where his battalion lost heavily at the passage of the Carrion, and where he was himself wounded and taken prisoner. After exchange he again commanded his battalion at Vitoria; at the storming of San Sebastian in September 1813 he headed the attack of the 5th division, receiving two wounds, and was present at the repulse of the sortie at Bayonne in 1814. In these campaigns he was seven times wounded.<br>
<br>At the peace Hill returned with the Portuguese army to Portugal, and served there; in 1820 he held a divisional command in the Portuguese service. He was made major in the newly raised 95th (Derbyshire) regiment in December 1823, from which he exchanged to half pay in January 1826. In 1834 he was appointed lieutenant-governor of the island of St Lucia, and took out with him the act of emancipation. He returned home on the occasion of his second marriage in 1838. He became major-general in 1841, and, after serving on the staff in Ireland, was appointed to a divisional command in Bengal in 1848, which post he held at the time of his death.<br>
<br>Hill married, first, the third daughter of Robert Hunter of Kew, Surrey, with whom he had six children, and second, on 23 June 1838, Mary, widow of Mark Davies, of Turnwood, Dorset. Hill was made CB in 1814, knighted in 1816, and made KCB in 1848. He had the Portuguese orders of the Tower and Sword, and of St Bento d'Avis, the latter conferred in 1839. He was presented with a sword and two valuable pieces of plate by his native county. He was appointed to the colonelcy of the 50th regiment in 1849. He died at Ambala, Bengal, on 21 February 1851.<br>
