<span class="headword">Hughes,  Herbert Delauney <span class="st"> [Billy]</span></span>  (1914&#150;1995), <span class="occ">adult educationist and politician</span>, was born on 7 September 1914 at 47 The Mall, Swindon, Wiltshire, the only child of Arthur Percy Hughes, secondary school teacher, and his wife, Maggie Ellen Delauney, former elementary school headteacher. When he was six the family moved to Bakewell, Derbyshire, because of Hughes's ill health. After being taught at home until the age of eleven, he attended Bakewell grammar school and then was a boarder at Manchester Warehousemen's and Clerks' Orphans School at Cheadle Hulme, Cheshire. With a county major and a state scholarship he entered Balliol College, Oxford, in 1933 and graduated with a second-class degree in modern history in 1936. In 1935 he was chair of the Oxford University Labour Club. During this time he was a member of G. D. H. Cole's circle, helped with soup kitchens in Oxford for hunger marchers from south Wales, and later took part in demonstrations in the Rhondda.<br>
<br>From Oxford, Billy Hughes went to Manchester University to train as a secondary school teacher, but he moved to London after only one term to take up the post of assistant secretary of the New Fabian Research Bureau (NFRB) which had been set up by G. D. H. Cole in 1931 to prepare viable plans for the implementation of Labour Party policies in the form of books and research pamphlets. When the NFRB united with the Fabian Society in 1938 Hughes became organizing secretary, editing the bureau's journal and pamphlets and servicing research committees.<br>
<br>In London, Hughes worked with John Parker, MP for Dagenham and secretary of the NFRB, and served as a member of Lambeth borough council. He also got to know Parker's sister (Winifred) Beryl (1912/1913&#150;1995), whom he married on 25 September 1937. The marriage lasted until she died in 1995; there were no children.<br>
<br>From 1942 to 1945 Hughes served with the Royal Artillery, taking part in the invasion of Normandy in 1944. In the following year while his unit was camped on the Dutch&#150;German border he learned that he had been nominated as the Labour candidate for the Wolverhampton West constituency. As the constituency's MP from 1945 to 1950 he served as parliamentary private secretary to Ellen Wilkinson, minister of education. The <span class="roman">Education Act</span> of 1944 was being implemented at this time; despite post-war economic difficulties, schools were rebuilt, emergency measures for the supply of teachers were introduced, the school-leaving age was raised to fifteen, and a beginning was made to provide a secondary education for all children. Ellen Wilkinson (whose personal secretary Beryl had been between 1937 and 1941) died in 1947; she was long mourned by both Billy and Beryl Hughes. Billy stayed in the Ministry of Education for another year, after which he became parliamentary private secretary to Michael Stewart, then financial secretary to the War Office. Here his work was largely concerned with parliamentary committees on colonial development and welfare.<br>
<br>In the general election of 1950 Hughes defended a redistributed constituency against Enoch Powell, the Conservative Party candidate, losing by 600 votes. Later that year the post of principal of Ruskin College, Oxford, became vacant on the sudden resignation of Lionel Elvin to take up a position with UNESCO. Ruskin College was (and is) an independent college, with strong associations with the labour movement and trade unions, which prepared working-class men and women to undertake responsible leadership in their organizations and communities. R. H. Tawney and G. D. H. Cole were academic advisers to the college, and it was Cole who suggested that Hughes apply for the position. The interview panel included Tawney and Cole and he was appointed at a salary of &pound;1000 per annum.<br>
<br>The years of Hughes's principalship from 1950 to 1979 were successful if difficult. Informality was his style of leadership, and this quality characterized college teaching. He was an accessible principal who continued to teach, in particular taking responsibility for courses on politics, public speaking, and trade union studies. In 1950 Ruskin was in danger of becoming a backwater. Finance was a constant problem for the college and its students, and Hughes worked hard on both fronts. The Ministry of Education grant to the college was increased in 1951, and in the 1960s he persuaded the education department to agree to a 50 per cent grant for the development of new buildings; this in turn led to an increase in student numbers and a broadening of the courses on offer. He worked through the Trades Union Congress to encourage trade unions to provide scholarships for their members to pursue Ruskin courses. For much of the time student grants from local education authorities were discretionary, but in 1974 the Department of Education and Science, following a recommendation of the Russell committee on education (1973), made these grants mandatory for students at Ruskin and similar residential adult colleges. During the 1970s, while the two-year University of Oxford special diploma in social studies remained, students increasingly opted for college-validated diplomas in labour studies, history, literature, and development studies. During the same period the history workshop of socialist and feminist historians was established at the college. In October 1976 the prime minister, James Callaghan, inaugurated a national debate on educational standards while laying the foundation stone of the Steve Biko building at the college's Headington site.<br>
<br>As student numbers increased Hughes put special effort into obtaining funding for overseas students. By the time of his retirement one-tenth of the 180 students at the college were from overseas, in particular from Africa, to which he had a strong commitment. Tom Mboya was a former Ruskin student and Hughes helped greatly in establishing and developing Kivukoni College in Tanzania. In later years, as chair of the Webb memorial trust (funded from the sale for &pound;1 million of Beatrice Webb House, at Holmbury St Mary, Surrey), he encouraged students from eastern and central Europe to attend Ruskin as Webb fellows.<br>
<br>During his time at Ruskin and in retirement Hughes was actively involved in educational committees and agencies. These included the Workers' Educational Association (as vice-president and president), the Russell committee on adult education (1969&#150;73), the advisory council for adult and continuing education, the Fabian Society, the National Institute of Adult and Continuing Education, and the Civil Service Arbitration Tribunal. His work at the college and his active involvement with bodies related to the education of adults was his life. He regretted the official neglect of adult education, and that England was still educationally two nations and would remain so until schools and further and higher education institutions were integrated to provide for the whole population in a comprehensive system of continuing education. Hughes survived his wife by four months, dying at his home, the Manor House at Merton, Bicester, on 15 November 1995.<br>
