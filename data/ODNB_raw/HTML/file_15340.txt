<span class="headword">Kempthorne, Sir  John</span>  (<em>c.</em>1620&#150;1679), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, was the second son of John Kempthorne, attorney, of Ugborough, Devon, and his wife, Agnes Simon. John senior served as a royalist cavalry officer in the civil wars, by which time his son seems already to have been at sea for several years, beginning as apprentice to the master of a Topsham vessel and eventually commanding Levant Company ships in the Mediterranean trade. About 1649 Kempthorne married Joanna (<i>d</i>. 1691), a servant to Lady Bendish, the wife of the ambassador to Constantinople from 1647 to 1661. In 1657 his ship, probably the <i>Eastland Merchant</i>, was captured after a hard fight by the Spanish privateer Papachino, who showed great kindness to his prisoner&#151;a generosity of spirit which Kempthorne reciprocated when Papachino was imprisoned in the Tower of London in 1658, eventually procuring the Spaniard's release. On 17 November 1660 John Kempthorne &#145;of Poplar&#146; was elected a brother of Trinity House, and in 1662&#150;3 he was commanding the merchantman <i>Maidenhead</i>, still in the Mediterranean trade, when she was requisitioned by the Turks to transport troops to Candia (Crete). The ambassador at Constantinople, the earl of Winchilsea, noted at the time that &#145;the captain has always been a man of loyal principles&#146;  (<span class="italic">Finch MSS</span>, 1.180).<br>
<br>The mobilization for the Second Anglo-Dutch War in 1664 brought Kempthorne his first naval command, probably through the auspices of his father's old commanding officer, Prince Rupert of the Rhine. He was captain of the <i>Kent</i> from June to October 1664, transferring from her to the <i>Dunkirk</i> and then, on 26 November, to the first-rate <i>Royal James</i>, which he commanded in the battle of Lowestoft on 3 June 1665 as flag captain to Rupert. On 19 July he transferred to the <i>Old James</i>, whose captain, the earl of Marlborough&#151;a distant relative of the Kempthorne family&#151;had been killed in the action. Kempthorne moved from her to the <i>Royal Charles</i> in February 1666, commanding her as flag captain to the duke of Albemarle in the Four Days' Fight of 1&#150;4 June before moving to the <i>Defiance</i> on 10 June, becoming rear-admiral of the Blue squadron in her in September. He stayed in the same ship until the end of 1667 and during this period commanded one of the &#145;flying squadrons&#146; sent out by the bankrupt government instead of a main fleet. His ships convoyed the Mediterranean trade between February and May 1667, then remained in south-western waters, based at Plymouth, during the Dutch attacks on the English and Scottish coastlines in the summer. At the end of June the squadron sailed for Ireland, where it remained until the end of September, usually cruising off the north-west coast between Blackrock and Rockall. After leaving the <i>Defiance</i> in December 1667, he commanded the <i>Warspite</i> during the summer of 1668.<br>
<br>Early in 1669 Kempthorne took command of the <i>Mary Rose</i>, the ship intended to carry Lord Howard as ambassador to Morocco. After landing him at Tangier, Kempthorne collected under his escort a multinational convoy of six merchantmen, only to be attacked north of Cadiz on 18 December by seven Algerine corsairs. The <i>Mary Rose</i> engaged without hesitation. The fighting lasted that day and much of the next, with six of the Algerine force attacking Kempthorne's single warship. Despite severe damage to her masts and rigging, the <i>Mary Rose</i> managed to disable the enemy admiral's vessel, at which point the whole Algerine force withdrew. Kempthorne's squadron arrived safely in Cadiz Bay on the 20th. The event was immortalized by the engraver Wenceslaus Hollar, a passenger on the <i>Mary Rose</i>, and it earned a knighthood for Kempthorne on 24 April 1670. When the Third Anglo-Dutch War began in 1672 he became rear-admiral of the blue once more, flying his flag in the <i>St Andrew</i>, in which he fought at the battle of Solebay on 28 May 1672. The blue bore the brunt of the fighting and Kempthorne's unsuccessful efforts to relieve his doomed admiral, the earl of Sandwich, brought him high praise: &#145;he &hellip; fought till eight with as much conduct and bravery as ever man in the world did, continually engaged on both sides almost the whole day&#146;  (Thomas Lucas to Nathaniel Herne, TNA: PRO, SP 29/310/35). Kempthorne's own account tells of his day-long running battle with the Dutch admiral De Ruyter, who was to regard this action as the hardest he ever fought. Kempthorne subsequently became rear-admiral of the red, and remained in the <i>St Andrew</i> for the 1673 campaign, serving under Sir Edward Spragge as vice-admiral of the blue. As such, he took part in the two indecisive battles of the Schooneveld on 28 May and 4 June, as well as in the battle of the Texel/Kijkduin on 11 August 1673. Spragge's deliberate decision to detach his squadron from the main fleet to pursue his private vendetta with the Dutch admiral Tromp led to bitter recriminations: Kempthorne criticized the conduct of his rear-admiral, Thomas Butler, earl of Ossory, but subsequently retracted the charges. His own part in the action, primarily against Tromp's vice-admiral, Sweers, and Tromp himself, centred on the relief of the severely damaged <i>Royal Prince</i>.<br>
<br>After leaving the <i>St Andrew</i> in October 1673 Kempthorne drew a flag officer's pension of &pound;200 per annum, and served both as master of Trinity House in 1674&#150;5 and as the first steward of the club for naval captains set up in 1674. Early in 1675 he was appointed resident commissioner of the navy at Portsmouth, forming a close relationship with the governor there, Colonel George Legge, later Lord Dartmouth, a fellow naval veteran of the Dutch wars. During the naval mobilization which occurred in 1678 (when there was a threat of war with France), Kempthorne held his last seagoing command, in the post of vice-admiral of the narrow seas and flying his flag in the <i>Royal Charles</i>. In February 1679, through Legge's good offices, he was returned as one of the MPs for Portsmouth in the elections for a new parliament, despite the government's attempts to secure the seat for the chancellor of the exchequer. Kempthorne's parliamentary career was short-lived as he died at Portsmouth on 19 October 1679. He was buried in St Thomas's Church there, where a memorial was erected to him.<br>
<br>All three of Kempthorne's sons had naval careers. His eldest surviving son, John, was born in 1651, followed by Morgan, born at Leghorn in 1655, and Rupert. An unnamed daughter married a prot&eacute;g&eacute; of Prince Rupert, Sir William Reeves, who died of wounds received at the battle of the Texel on 11 August 1673 when in command of the <i>Sovereign</i>. Kempthorne's son John joined the East India Company's service in 1682 and died in 1692. Morgan was killed in command of the <i>Kingfisher</i> in 1681 in an engagement with seven Algerine pirates, an action reminiscent of his father's fight in the <i>Mary Rose</i>. Rupert commanded a fireship in 1690 but was killed in a tavern brawl in 1691, a fate which took an evidently unruly son from his &#145;tender but grossly abused mother&#146;  (BL, Egerton MS 928, fol. 268). In his will Kempthorne left land in Bigbury, Devon, and shares in five merchantmen: he had remained a prominent owner of merchant ships throughout his naval career, hiring the <i>Turkey Merchant</i> to the navy in 1666, in the Third Anglo-Dutch War, and in 1678, as well as being a part owner of the privateer <i>Jamaica Merchant</i> in the third war. Throughout his naval career he had remained popular with the mariners of his native Devon, who often flocked to serve with him.<br>
