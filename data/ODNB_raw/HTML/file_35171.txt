<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Murry,  John Middleton</span>  (1889&#150;1957), <span class="occ">writer and journal editor</span>, was born on 6 August 1889 in Peckham, London, the elder of the two sons of John Murry (1860/61&#150;1947), a clerk in the Inland Revenue, and his wife, Emily (1869/70&#150;1951), <i>n&eacute;e</i> Wheeler. John Murry was a determined man from an impoverished and illiterate background who taught himself to write. Poor but ambitious, he saw education as the sole means to fulfil his aspirations for his son. Subjected to intense pressure to learn from the time he could speak, John Middleton Murry could read by the age of two. He won one of the first six scholarships to Christ's Hospital, where he attended school (1901&#150;8), and then won an exhibition and a scholarship to study classics at Brasenose College, Oxford, where he took a first in honour moderations (1910) and a second class in his finals (1912).<br>
<br>By this time Murry had abandoned Oxford to live with the writer Kathleen Beauchamp (Katherine Mansfield) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35172/', "Murry, Kathleen (1888&#150;1923)")</script>]; they married on 3 May 1918. He had also begun his distinguished editorial career as founder of the avant-garde magazine <span class="italic">Rhythm</span> (1911&#150;13). His friendship with D. H. Lawrence further secured his passionate commitment to modernism in the arts. He and Katherine Mansfield were the witnesses for the Lawrences' wedding in 1914 and the two couples were intimate until their estrangement in 1918. Murry's early career as a journalist demonstrated his exceptional promise and his lifelong capacity for hard work. As well as reviewing literature and art for the <span class="italic">Westminster Gazette</span> (1912&#150;14), and writing for the <span class="italic">Times Literary Supplement</span> (1914&#150;18), Murry worked in the War Office in the political intelligence department from 1916 to 1919, first as a translator and then as editor of the confidential <span class="italic">Daily Review of the Foreign Press</span>. In 1919 he was made chief censor, for which he was made OBE in 1920. As editor of the ailing but still prestigious <span class="italic">Athenaeum</span> from 1919 to 1921, he championed modernism in literature and provided a platform for the work of writers as diverse as George Santayana, Paul-Ambrose Val&eacute;ry, Lawrence, Aldous Huxley, T. S. Eliot, and Virginia Woolf. His own first significant critical work, <span class="italic">Dostoevsky</span> (1916), and his most frequently reprinted book, <span class="italic">The Problem of Style</span> (1922), further secured his reputation with his contemporaries.<br>
<br>Katherine Mansfield's death from tuberculosis in 1923 marked a watershed for Murry, whose subsequent life was shadowed by his devotion to her memory, as well as by his embattled engagement with D. H. Lawrence's ideas. Indeed, despite publishing over forty books and pamphlets, Murry now is remembered chiefly for his relationships with these two central figures of his youth. His controversial, often mystical, criticism and journalism returned obsessively to the ideas of the sanctity of art and the need for a new order of pseudo-religious brotherhood, although the forms these ideas took changed through his life. He designed his journal, <span class="italic">The Adelphi</span>, which he edited from 1923 to 1948, specifically to promote his often fluctuating, but always passionately held principles.<br>
<br>Murry's personal life remained as turbulent as his intellectual affiliations. On 24 April 1924 he married Violet Le Maistre (1901&#150;1931). They had two children: a daughter, Katherine Violet Murry (1925&#150;2003), and a son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/76903/', "John Middleton Murry (1926&#150;2002)")</script>. Preoccupied by his grief for his first wife, Murry was shocked to discover that Violet, who cultivated her uncanny resemblance to Katherine Mansfield, welcomed the tuberculosis that killed her in 1931 as a Romantic disease. His third marriage, to Ada Elizabeth Cockbayne (1896&#150;1954), housekeeper, on 23 May 1931, proved even more difficult. Although the couple produced two children, a daughter, Mary (born 27 January 1932), and a son, David (born 25 May 1938), the marriage was disastrous. Murry left in October 1941 to live with the author and political activist Mary Gamble (1897&#150;1983). They married on 10 March 1954, after Elizabeth's death in the previous month. Murry's final marriage was his happiest.<br>
<br>Throughout his writing career, Murry remained preoccupied by a semi-mystical Romantic humanism which showed itself to best advantage in his books <span class="italic">Keats and Shakespeare</span> (1925), <span class="italic">William Blake</span> (1933), and <span class="italic">Jonathan Swift</span> (1954). His book on D. H. Lawrence, <span class="italic">Son of Woman</span> (1931), is still read for its argumentative fidelity in the presentation of Lawrence's life and ideas. Murry's autobiography, <span class="italic">Between Two Worlds</span> (1935), stands as one of the classic memoirs of the modernist period. Finally, his many essays on Katherine Mansfield, as well as his editions of her stories, journals, and letters, provide invaluable documentary sources for the rise of literary modernism in England.<br>
<br>From the early 1930s through to the end of the 1940s, Murry dedicated himself to socialist and pacifist causes. His writing of this period, such as <span class="italic">The Necessity of Communism</span> (1932) and <span class="italic">The Necessity of Pacifism</span> (1937), reflect these commitments. In demand as a lecturer, in both Great Britain and America, he was the editor of the pacifist publication <span class="italic">Peace News</span> from 1940 to 1946, and suffered a great shock when he learned of Hitler's and Stalin's death camps in 1945. Unsurprisingly, his political views further diminished his already faded reputation during the war. His brief experiment in communal living on his farm, Lower Lodge, Thelnetham, on the Norfolk&#150;Suffolk border, in the 1940s ended with the dozen young men and women he recruited to the project all drifting away. But if the commune foundered, the farm was a success, and Murry ended his life as a well-off gentleman farmer, a Conservative voter, and an integral member of the Thelnetham village community. Murry died of a heart attack on 13 March 1957 in the West Suffolk Hospital, Bury St Edmunds. He was buried three days later in Thelnetham churchyard.<br>
