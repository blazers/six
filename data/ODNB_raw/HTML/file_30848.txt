<span class="headword">Brayley,  (John) Desmond</span>, Baron Brayley  (1917&#150;1977), <span class="occ">glass manufacturer and politician</span>, was born at 10 Mervyn Street, Rhydyfelin, near Pontypridd, Glamorgan, on 29 January 1917, the only son of Frederick Brayley, a caf&eacute; owner, and his wife, Jennie Bassett. He was educated at Pontypridd grammar school, which he left at the age of seventeen to join the regular army in the Royal Artillery, becoming a physical-training instructor. During the Second World War he served in the Army Air Corps with distinction in the African desert campaigns, and was awarded the MC for gallantry in 1942. He went on to Crete and Sicily, where he received a mention in dispatches. From an earlier marriage to Irene Wisden he was presumably divorced, for on 18 August 1945 he married Flight Officer Queenie Elizabeth Selma Bee (<i>b</i>. 1912/13), daughter of Horace Bee, estate agent; they had two daughters. The marriage was dissolved in 1960.<br>
<br>In 1946 Brayley joined the Phoenix Glass Company of Bristol, rising to managing director in the 1950s. In the process he became a wealthy man and was noted in Bristol for his free-spending habits and interest in horse-racing. In 1961 he became chairman of, and a major shareholder in, the Canning Town Glass Works, a bottle-manufacturing firm in London, which he was instrumental in developing. He had been a lifelong member of the Labour Party and did not allow success and wealth to affect his loyalty to it or to blur his early memories of poverty in Wales. He was a generous benefactor to the party and donated 60,000 shares in the Canning Town Glass Works to its funds. Harold Wilson first met Brayley through Lord Wigg, a close political ally and paymaster-general in his 1964 government. Wigg, a former regular soldier, shared Brayley's devotion to the army and his interest in horse-racing, while self-made, flamboyant, and wealthy entrepreneurs always seemed to appeal strongly to Wilson. When the Labour government was defeated in 1970, Wilson recommended Brayley for a knighthood in his resignation honours list, citing his services to the Bristol Labour Party.<br>
<br>Brayley was, however, little known in the party and there was much adverse comment when Wilson made him a life peer in 1973. This was intensified when he was appointed parliamentary under-secretary for defence in March 1974. A few months later rumours began to circulate about his business affairs before becoming a minister. On taking office he had sold his shares in the Canning Town Glass Works for &pound;1 million but on 7 September he was named at a shareholders' meeting as owing the company &pound;16,515 for expenses which had been queried by the auditors; at one stage the company was claiming &pound;200,000 from Brayley and similar sums from other directors.<br>
<br>Although Brayley claimed ignorance of this, concern over allegations affecting a minister's business interests led the president of the Board of Trade to order on 15 September an inquiry under the <span class="roman">Companies Act</span>, and Brayley, after consulting Wilson, resigned from the government. Coming in the midst of the general election campaign these events were embarrassing enough for the Labour Party, but the more so when Brayley's close association with Wilson, and his gift of shares to the party, became known. After Brayley's resignation there were further allegations about misuse of the company's funds. Brayley sued the owners of the <span class="italic">Daily Mail</span> for its disclosure of internal company documents, but in July 1976 he was arrested on five charges of fraud, which he strongly denied. Litigation began but the main issues had not come to trial when Brayley died of abdominal cancer, on 16 March 1977, at Cardiff Royal Infirmary, and the case was closed without the truth ever being known. The administration of his estate showed assets of &pound;87,091 but these were far exceeded by his liabilities. It was a tragic end to the career of a man of great talents and, his friends always insisted, of high honour, whose death, they believed, had been accelerated by the shame of a scandal not of his wilful doing. Nor had he been prepared for the glare of publicity surrounding his ministerial appointment, even before the storm broke over his business life.<br>
<br>Brayley was always noted for his work for charities, particularly those helping mentally handicapped people and those in his native Pontypridd, but not until after his death did the full extent of his personal generosity become known through tributes published in <span class="italic">The Times</span>. The controller of the Royal Artillery Benevolent Fund wrote of his &#145;boundless generosity&#146; to the regiment, and the chairman of the Middlesex sessions, Ewen Montagu, paid tribute to his unfailing readiness to meet anonymously appeals for financial help for prisoners and their families in distress or to assist their rehabilitation on release. In 1961 Brayley became a freeman of the City of London. In 1970 he was appointed an honorary colonel-commandant of the Royal Artillery and in the same year became a deputy lieutenant for Greater London. He was, from 1968, a JP for Middlesex. He had been a noted sportsman and athlete, and an army championship boxer. He held his own private pilot's licence.<br>
