<span class="headword">Sheffield, Sir  Robert</span>  (<em>b. </em>before 1462, <em>d.</em> 1518), <span class="occ">lawyer and speaker of the House of Commons</span>, was the son of Robert Sheffield (<i>c</i>.1430&#150;1502), a lawyer and administrator of South Cave, Yorkshire, and his wife, Jane Lounde. It was through his mother that the younger Robert Sheffield became lord of West Butterwick, Lincolnshire. Trained in the Inner Temple, of which he became a governor in 1511, he had become recorder of London by 21 September 1495, and served in that office until April 1508. Consequently he was <i>ex officio</i> an MP for London in 1495, 1497, and 1504. Knighted by Henry VII after the battle of Blackheath (17 June 1497), by way of thanking the city for its loyalty, in 1504 Sheffield attracted some odium for failing to defend its corporate privileges. In 1497 Giles, Lord Daubeney (<i>d</i>. 1508), tried to buy Sheffield the speakership, but was outbid. From about 1508&#150;9, by now &#145;of counsel&#146; to the king, Sheffield largely retired to his county, receiving royal grants of several stewardships around Lincoln; by 1516 he was Lindsey's <i>custos rotulorum</i>. He probably represented Lincolnshire in the parliaments of 1512 and 1515, but London still paid him an annuity to be mindful of its interests. In February 1512 he was &#145;elected&#146; speaker, the crown paying him &pound;300 for the three sessions held between then and 4 March 1514&#151;an inflated rate.<br>
<br>In 1515 Sheffield helped Thomas Wolsey (<i>d</i>. 1530) to pilot his resumption bill through parliament. However, in the same parliament Sheffield's support for the renewal of an act of 1512, denying benefit of clergy to men not in holy orders, appears to have aroused Wolsey's hostility, and in the following year he was arraigned in Star Chamber, charged with negligence as a JP. He had to give recognizances for 8000 marks, and was dismissed from the county bench. He obtained a pardon in November 1516, but his complaints to the king against the cardinal caused Wolsey to have Sheffield imprisoned in the Tower of London, before bringing him back into Star Chamber, accused of obtaining his pardon without licence and also of harbouring a killer (on which there may have been a real case to answer). Returned to the Tower, he may have died there, on 10 August 1518, though the church of the Austin friars, in which he chose to be buried, adjoined not only the Tower but probably also Sheffield's own house&#151;his first wife, Ellen, the daughter of Sir John Delves of Doddington, Cheshire, was buried in the friary church. Ellen died in or after 1509, and Sheffield later married Anne Barlee (<i>d</i>. 1558?), daughter of William Barlee, of Albury, Hertfordshire. His son and heir, Robert (<i>d</i>. 1531), the child of his first marriage, married Jane Stanley, sister of Thomas Stanley, second earl of Derby; their son <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25292/', "Edmund Sheffield")</script> became first Baron Sheffield in 1547. After Sir Robert's death in 1518 the second Lady Sheffield was twice remarried, to Sir John Grey, of Blisworth, Northamptonshire, and to Sir Richard Clement, of Ightham Mote, Kent; her will was dated 1 October 1557 and was proved on 7 May 1558.<br>
