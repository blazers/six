<span class="headword">Cooper,  Charles Purton</span>  (1793&#150;1873), <span class="occ">lawyer and antiquary</span>, was the son of Charles Cooper, linen draper, of St Dunstan, Kent, and Fleet Street, London. He was educated at Wadham College, Oxford, where he matriculated in 1810 and was a contemporary of Richard Bethell, first Lord Westbury. He graduated BA in 1814 with a double first class in honours, gaining his MA on 5 July 1817. He was called to the bar at Lincoln's Inn on 18 November 1816, and, after practising with success as an equity draughtsman, was appointed a king's counsel in 1836. He was queen's serjeant for the duchy of Lancaster from 1834 to his death. In 1837 he became a bencher of Lincoln's Inn, and in 1843 presented to the society two thousand volumes of civil and foreign legal works, having previously presented a hundred and fifty volumes of American law reports. He was treasurer of his inn in 1855, and master of the library in 1856.<br>
<br>Cooper's enthusiasm for the cause of legal reform attracted the attention of Lord Brougham, who introduced him to the Holland House circle and the heads of the whig party and on 12 March 1831 appointed him secretary of the second record commission. During his period of office Cooper bought and printed so many books that the commission's debt, over and above the &pound;400,000 voted by parliament, rose to &pound;24,000. The commission lapsed on 20 June 1837 on the king's death. Lord Holland recommended Cooper for the post of solicitor-general but R. M. Rolfe, later Lord Cranworth, was appointed.<br>
<br>Cooper played an active part in public affairs in his own county, Kent, where he resided at Denton Court, near Canterbury. He appeared as a whig candidate for Lambeth in 1850, but withdrew from the contest. In 1854 and 1857 he unsuccessfully contested Canterbury. He was proposed as a candidate for West Kent in 1855, but declined to stand. His great knowledge of jurisprudence and legal antiquities procured him a fellowship of the Royal Society on 6 December 1832, and the degree of LLD from the Roman Catholic University of Louvain and from Kiel. He was elected a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries in June 1825 and was a corresponding member of the royal academies of Lisbon, Munich, Berlin, and Brussels.<br>
<br>Cooper enjoyed a leading practice in the court of Vice-Chancellor Knight-Bruce, but he openly quarrelled with that judge, quitted his court, and lost his practice. As business fell off he endeavoured, without success, to obtain government assistance for a project for digesting and sifting all the law reports down to that date. He eventually retired to Boulogne, where, after unsuccessfully attempting to carry on his projects of legal reform, he died of paralysis and bronchitis on 26 March 1873, aged eighty.<br>
<br>Cooper was a prolific writer. He published a large number of varied legal works, including <span class="italic">An Account of the Public Records of the United Kingdom</span> (2 vols., 1832), three volumes of reports of cases, texts on the court of chancery, conveyancing, solicitors' costs, municipal corporations, and the custody of lunatics. In 1860 he published memoranda of his proposals to classify the law reports and digest the statute book. He also published a letter on the pope's apostolic letters of 1850, a pamphlet on the government and the Irish Roman Catholic members (1851), and a work on freemasonry.<br>
