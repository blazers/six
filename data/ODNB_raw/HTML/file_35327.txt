<span class="headword">Ord,  William Miller</span>  (1834&#150;1902), <span class="occ">physician and medical administrator</span>, was born on 23 September 1834 at Brixton Hill, Surrey, the elder of two sons of George Ord FRCS and his wife, Harriet, the daughter of Sir James Clark, a London merchant. Educated at King's College School, Ord entered St Thomas's Hospital in 1852 and gained his MB from London University in 1855 and his MD in 1877. Following a brief period in general practice with his father at Streatham Hill, Ord remained associated with St Thomas's for the rest of his career as house surgeon, surgical registrar, demonstrator of anatomy, and, from 1870, assistant physician and joint lecturer in physiology. He was dean of the medical school from 1876 until 1887. Ord was appointed physician in 1877, a post which he held until 1898, when he became consulting physician.<br>
<br>Ord married on 12 April 1859 Julia, daughter of Joseph Rainbow of Norwood; they had two daughters and a son. It was in the year of his marriage that Ord made his name as an exceptionally youthful member of the pioneering circle of medical men and epidemiologists associated with John Simon at the medical office of the privy council. Simon later recalled that he had looked upon his precocious collaborator as one of his &#145;brightest and most trustworthy students&#146;  (Brockington, 287). In the summer of 1858 the foully polluted River Thames, which had long threatened the environmental stability of the capital, had generated a &#145;great stink&#146; which closed down the law courts and forced members of parliament to flee, half-nauseous, from the debating chamber. Miasmatic theory predicted that the death-rate would soar as a result of a dramatic increase in gastrointestinal infection and that, intermixed with the prevailing &#145;epidemic atmosphere&#146;, the stench from the river would inevitably precipitate yet another outbreak of cholera&#151;there had been severe epidemics in 1848&#150;9 and 1853&#150;4. However, Ord's assiduous analysis of the health of boatmen, wharfingers, and dockers cast serious doubt on this hypothesis and revealed that, in itself, the stinking river was unlikely to generate dysenteric or diarrhoeal disease.<br>
<br>During the next five years Ord undertook investigations into localized outbreaks of typhoid fever on behalf of the medical office of the privy council and produced a classic paper, &#145;The sanitary circumstances of dressmakers and other needlewomen in London&#146;. This meticulous account of the relationship between the fashionable demands of the London social season and its impact on the lives of &#145;thousands of women &hellip; [who were] pursuing their occupation under conditions which constantly undermine their vital and physical powers, and contract, with fatal certainty &hellip; their measure of years&#146;  (&#145;Medical officer &hellip; sixth report&#146;, 28.371) was nevertheless qualified by a cautious conservatism. Eschewing criticism of prevailing economic orthodoxy, Ord remained convinced that market forces would eventually exclude mercilessly exploitative employers and subcontractors.<br>
<br>Following the tragically premature death of his wife in 1864 Ord gradually withdrew from epidemiological and social investigation and, undertaking detailed observations of cretinoid elderly women on the wards at St Thomas's, began to formulate novel ideas on the origins and nature of what he would later term myxoedema. Endemic cretinism had been observed and described in detail by Paracelsus in the duchy of Salzburg. In its sporadic form, however, it was not recognized until C. H. Fogge's account in the early 1870s. This prepared the way for Sir William Gull's authoritative report on the condition among adults in 1873. Building on this work Ord presented a seminal paper in 1877 in which he claimed the essential cause of the disease to be atrophy or fibrosis of the thyroid gland. In 1888 Ord chaired a special committee for the Clinical Society of London and produced &#145;a remarkable review of the subjects of cretinism and myxoedema&#146;  (Ingbar and Braverman, 4). A decade later this was complemented by the synoptic Bradshaw lecture at the Royal College of Physicians, &#145;On myxoedema and allied conditions&#146;.<br>
<br>On his retirement in 1900 Ord moved to the village of Hurstborne Tarrant, near Andover, to &#145;enjoy the country life for which he yearned&#146;  (<span class="italic">BMJ</span>, 1315). However, in 1902 he was stricken with what the journal termed &#145;brain fever&#146; and was moved to the house of his son, The Hall, New Street, Salisbury, where he died on 14 May 1902. He was buried at London Road cemetery, Salisbury. He was survived by his second wife, Jane, daughter of Sir James Arndell Youl, with whom he had two daughters. Ord was a gregarious and life enhancing man, and his London house in Upper Brook Street reflected the &#145;cultured tastes of its owner&#146;  (<span class="italic">Leading Men of London</span>). Exceptionally well versed in the classics, Ord &#145;could read his Ovid with ease [and] put his finger immediately on some quotation from Horace or Virgil which exactly fitted the subject under discussion&#146;  (<span class="italic">BMJ</span>, 1316). If he ultimately failed to fulfil his very great potential as a creative medical scientist it was predominantly the result of his dedication to the tasks of teaching and administration at St Thomas's.<br>
