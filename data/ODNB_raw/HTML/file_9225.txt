<span class="headword">Fawcett,  Joseph</span>  (<em>c.</em>1758&#150;1804), <span class="occ">Presbyterian minister and poet</span>, attended the Revd Mr French's school at Ware, Hertfordshire, and in 1774 entered the Daventry Theological Academy along with his schoolmaster's son, Barron French, whose sister he afterwards married. Most of his theological training was received from Thomas Robins, who succeeded Caleb Ashworth as manager of the academy in 1775. He trained himself to preach by declaiming to the thorn bushes on Burrow Hill, near Daventry. In 1780 Fawcett became morning preacher at Marsh Street Presbyterian Chapel, Walthamstow, on the resignation of Hugh Farmer, where he soon developed both his preaching abilities and unitarian opinions. The expression of the latter led to a split in the congregation in 1786, and he resigned the following year.<br>
<br>On 23 September 1782, at Ware, Fawcett married Charlotte French (<i>d</i>. 1824), daughter of his former schoolmaster, and in 1785 he revived the Sunday evening lecture at the Old Jewry meeting-house in London. It was here that Fawcett became one of the most popular and fashionable dissenting preachers of his day, who &#145;so much distinguished himself by his eloquence&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>). He is said to have attracted &#145;the largest and most genteel London audience that ever assembled in a dissenting place of worship&#146;  (<span class="italic">Monthly Repository</span>, 1817, 90). Dissenters and churchmen of all shades of opinion, together with fashionable actors like Sarah Siddons and the Kembles, were among his admirers. Wordsworth liked his sermons but saw him as unstable, later modelling the Solitary in his poem <span class="italic">The Excursion</span> on Fawcett.<br>
<br>Fawcett gave up his lectureship in 1795 and took a lease on a farm called Edge Grove, near Aldenham, Hertfordshire, to devote himself to farming and poetry. He was disturbed by the war with France and published several anti-war poems (1795&#150;1801), as well as his sermons in two editions. Radicals admired his poems; Joseph Priestley saw his long poem <span class="italic">The Art of War</span> &#145;as discovering a most exuberant imagination &hellip; some parts are very affecting&#146;  (<span class="italic">Theological and Miscellaneous Works</span>, 1/2.323).<br>
<br>Fawcett clearly had a talent for friendship and conversation, exercising a significant influence on both William Godwin and William Hazlitt. Godwin first met Fawcett during his first pastorate at Ware in 1778&#150;9, and they remained lifelong friends. Fawcett was the first of the &#145;four principal instructors&#146; to whom Godwin felt &#145;his mind indebted for improvement&#146;  (Marshall, 47). Hazlitt in later life concluded &#145;With him I passed some of the pleasantest days of my life. The conversation &hellip; of taste and philosophy gave me a delight such as I can never feel again &hellip; he was the person of the most refined and least contracted taste I ever knew&#146;  (<span class="italic">Complete Works</span>, 8.224). Fawcett died at Edge Grove on 24 January 1804 and was buried in Aldenham churchyard on 29 January.<br>
