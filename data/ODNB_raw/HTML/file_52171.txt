<span class="headword">Deorman</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1119&#150;1141), <span class="occ">moneyer and merchant</span>, was a member of the first London family of moneyers for whom biographical details can be assembled, and his importance lies in what they reveal about the prominent but largely unknown class of men responsible for organizing and running the Anglo-Saxon and Anglo-Norman mints. The name of Deorman appears on the coins of London struck in the reigns of &AElig;thelred II, Harold I, and Edward the Confessor, and it is likely that the family held the royal office of moneyer by long descent. The repeated use by successive generations of the names Deorman and Theoderic, long after Saxon names had become unfashionable, hints at the pride they took in their descent. It would appear from the family's connections with the church of St Antonin in Watling Street, most probably built by Deorman's grandfather at the end of the eleventh century, that the church was close to their mint. If this was so, the mint was situated on what seems to have been the main street of King Alfred's London.<br>
<br>The first documentary references to Deorman's family occur in <span class="roman">Domesday Book</span>, and show that his grandfather, also Deorman, held land in Islington, Essex, and Hertfordshire as a tenant-in-chief&#151;some of it by petty serjeanty&#151;apparently as remuneration for his important office of supervising the mints. He was also one of the knights of the archbishop of Canterbury's fee, no doubt because of the financial services which he could render. Four of the elder Deorman's sons were also London moneyers and were prominent among the aldermanic families in the city. One of them, Theoderic, had at least four sons of his own. They included Walter (an alderman in 1132), and the second Deorman.<br>
<br>This Deorman first appears in the documents in 1119, when he claimed the church of St Antonin by hereditary right. He was described elsewhere as a moneyer, and his name, like those of three of his brothers, appears on coins of the London mint&#151;in his case between 1134 and 1141. It seems clear, though, from the family's high social standing that its members were not actively engaged in the work of striking and exchanging coins, work which was probably supervised by goldsmiths. But moneyers were well placed to accumulate trading capital, as they were exempt from royal taxation and could also make use of the deposits of bullion temporarily left in their charge. Moreover they had close contact with foreign merchants, who were obliged to exchange their own coin and bullion at the mints for English coins. Moneyers had the capital to provide hostels for alien merchants, and inevitably these contacts encouraged them to make their own ventures in foreign trade. The unusual dedication of St Antonin's Church suggests that the family of Deorman had trading links with the Castilian town of Palencia, of which St Antonin was patron; here they could profitably acquire gold. It is also likely that they were the founders of the group of London pepperers who by 1180 had their own guild and specialized in selling spices and other luxury goods imported from the Mediterranean.<br>
<br>Confirmation that Deorman dealt in imported luxuries comes from a book of miracles written by Osbert de Clare, the mid-twelfth-century prior of Westminster Abbey, which included a story about a very rich merchant of London called Deorman. This was undoubtedly the London moneyer, whose family the prior must have known well since Deorman's three aunts had given lands to Westminster Abbey in return for rights of burial and confraternity. Abbeys were also used as storehouses of bullion and valuables, and there is considerable evidence for close links between them and moneyers. A later version of the same story by Abbot Samson of Bury (<i>d</i>. 1211), who must also have known Deorman, says that he dealt in expensive spices, silks, and rich fabrics which he took to the fair at Bury St Edmunds. On one occasion, while Deorman was praying in the abbey church, a bag containing jewels and gold was stolen from him. By a miracle he recovered his valuables, and out of compassion for the penitent thief he let her go unpunished. According to the story it was this experience which led Deorman (presumably after 1141, when his name last appears on London coins) to abandon his successful life as a moneyer and merchant to become a monk at Bury, where he lived to a good old age.<br>
<br>Deorman's son, <a name="cosubject_52171"></a><span class="headword">Theoderic Fitzdeorman</span>  (<em>d.</em> in or before 1162), carried on the family mint from 1141 until 1158, when Henry II closed down all the established London mints, dismissed the hereditary moneyers, and apparently established a central workshop in their place. But before then Theoderic had raised his family to even greater heights by his marriage to Matilda, a relation of Gilbert de Clare, earl of Pembroke (<i>d</i>. 1148), one of the most powerful barons in England. The earl was one of Stephen's supporters until 1147, and he held Montfichet Castle in London during the civil war. It would seem that the marriage was Theoderic's reward for assisting Stephen, and this would account for his appointment as justiciar of London between 1143 and 1152. Theoderic died in or before 1162, by when his son Bertram had granted 80 acres of lands at Stoke Newington to St Mary's, Clerkenwell, for the soul of his father. Bertram's son Thomas confirmed the grant shortly before 1187. After this the family's links with London became tenuous and soon untraceable.<br>
