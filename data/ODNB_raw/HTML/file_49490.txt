<span class="headword">Rhodes,  Thomas</span>  (1789&#150;1868), <span class="occ">civil engineer</span>, was born on 7 March 1789 at Apperley Bridge, near Bradford, Yorkshire, one of at least four sons and two daughters of the millwright and carpenter James Rhodes. He attended Calverley School and was then apprenticed to his elder brother William, who carried on their father's business. In 1810 Thomas was employed briefly on the Glasgow and Paisley Canal before obtaining his first important engineering post, on the Caledonian Canal, of which Thomas Telford had overall charge.<br>
<br>Rhodes made three principal contributions to the Caledonian Canal. He designed the lock-gates, originally made from oak, and later from cast iron; he also devised, and built, the equipment for hanging them. It was Rhodes's task to organize the assembly of two of the first steam bucket dredgers in 1816. The parts had been made at Butterley ironworks, and were put together by Rhodes, and his carpenters, on the shores of Loch Oich. During an interval in this work he took charge of the insertion of caissons, and the centering of arches on the Bonar Bridge over the Dornoch Firth.<br>
<br>On leaving Scotland in 1822 Rhodes was immediately engaged by Telford to assist in the building of the Menai and Conwy road bridges in north Wales. His main responsibility was the assembly of the chains for the high-level suspension bridge, at that time the longest ever attempted. The links were manufactured at the Coleham works in Shropshire, and assembled on site. Rhodes observed, from the top of a tower, with Telford and two others, the successful slinging of the first suspension chain across the straits in April 1825. When the bridge was opened in January 1826 he was in the first party to cross by road. Only a week later it was Rhodes's duty to report to Telford the damage caused by a spectacular gale. The introduction of transverse bracings made the bridge safe.<br>
<br>Soon afterwards came a large dock development in London. Telford had been commissioned by the St Katherine's Dock Company, and installed Rhodes as his resident engineer. This scheme was successfully completed (apart from the eastern basin) between May 1826 and October 1828. Telford, always safety conscious, protested against excessive haste. A major novelty of the plan was the provision of two basins within the 10 acre site, and the use of six pumps to draw water through a long culvert from the middle of the river. During his engagement at St Katherine's, Rhodes designed an interlocking-arch swivel bridge, the model for one he later used on the Shannon.<br>
<br>In 1832&#150;3 Rhodes produced major reports on improvements to the River Shannon in the west of Ireland. By 1835 he was one of the Shannon commissioners, who had been given statutory charge over the whole river, with a view to implementing his proposals. The chief purpose was to relieve unemployment, and also to promote passenger transport by steamboat. Much of the work was carried out, especially in the middle sections of the river between Killaloe and Battlebridge. Rhodes was also active in Yorkshire, completing a major survey of the River Ouse in January 1834, which led to many essential repairs. Rhodes was responsible for the twin-bascule bridge, opened in 1840, which carried the Hull&#150;Selby railway over the Ouse. In 1837 he surveyed the River Derwent for Earl Fitzwilliam, and recommended effective improvements.<br>
<br>Rhodes had a wife called Lucy, but little else is known about his private life. More modest, and less celebrated, than several of his contemporaries, Rhodes nevertheless established a sound and well-deserved reputation. He was a member of the Institution of Civil Engineers from 1828. Telford praised his &#145;dexterity as a mechanic, his superior skill and unremitting attention&#146;  (A. Gibb, 185). These skills found outlets in all four countries of the United Kingdom. The period 1849 to 1860 was spent as resident engineer in charge of two harbours in the Channel Islands. After eight years of retirement, Rhodes died at Paignton, Devon, on 6 June 1868.<br>
