<span class="headword">Hilsey,  John</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1539), <span class="occ">bishop of Rochester</span>, may have originated at Hildsley in Berkshire. He is said to have been educated at the Dominican house in Bristol, before becoming a friar there, and subsequently transferred to the Oxford convent, where he became BTh in 1527 and DTh in 1532. Of his religious inclinations at this time little is known, but having become prior of the Bristol Dominicans, he preached against the sermons of Hugh Latimer; in May 1532 he wrote to Thomas Cromwell in apologetic terms explaining why he did so. A little later Cromwell saw his potential value to the crown and the penitent Hilsey, no doubt eager to reassure the king of his loyalty, was appointed provincial of the English Dominicans on 13 April 1534, and at the same time was commissioned with the Augustinian friar George Browne to visit all the friaries in England; they soon secured acceptance of the royal supremacy. In 1535 Hilsey requested the Charterhouse monks to attend at Paul's Cross every week to lighten their hearts by knowledge and save their souls&#151;that is, by assenting to the supremacy. Such was his impact that in May of that year the conservative bishop John Stokesley of London stopped Hilsey from preaching at Paul's Cross, fearing that like George Browne he might have &#145;some pernicious doctrine&#146;  (<span class="italic">LP Henry VIII</span>, 8, no. 1054).<br>
<br>Nevertheless, Hilsey's diligent and effective advocacy of the supremacy quickly brought him rewards, though of a modest sort, when on 7 August 1535 he was elected bishop of Rochester, the poorest and smallest English diocese, in succession to John Fisher, who had been deprived and executed for treason. Royal assent was granted on 12 August, he was consecrated by Cranmer on 18 September, and the temporalities were restored on 4 October. Hilsey's own background, when set against his predecessor's indefatigable stand against the royal supremacy and exemplary record as diocesan, was bound to make his appointment controversial among conservatives, but for the crown and reformers like Cranmer it was a perfectly logical one&#151;the diocese was often held by men with a theological training and its proximity to London could ensure that Hilsey's energy and talents were fully employed.<br>
<br>Hilsey immediately encountered problems with the administration of his temporalities (and consequently saw the royal supremacy from a rather different angle)&#151;he reported to Cromwell that crown agents in his woodland seemed to be taking everything, and asked him for Fisher's mitre, staff, and seal, pleading poverty. This was genuine as Hilsey also pleaded for livings <i>in commendam</i> to supplement his meagre &pound;200 per annum. Cromwell finally licensed him to hold two additional benefices, though at the expense of losing Frekenham manor to Edward North, chancellor of augmentations. During his episcopate the London residence of the bishops of Rochester, Lambeth Marsh, was also lost. It is unlikely that he ever had surplus income, and while it is as well to be cautious about Bishop Griffith's statement in 1558 that the &pound;100 that <i>he</i> had spent on repairs was more than anybody had spent in the last twenty-four years at Rochester, the claim does seem plausible. On the whole Hilsey seems to have been competent at managing his leases and finances, in contrast to some other bishops who had once been monks.<br>
<br>Following his consecration Hilsey appointed Maurice Griffith his chancellor to carry out his primary visitation of the cathedral and diocese. Almost immediately, however, Hilsey's authority was suspended during a royal visitation and he seems to have encountered some hostility from Richard Layton, the king's visitor, late in October telling Cromwell that Layton wanted the advowson of a benefice which Rochester Cathedral priory hoped to give to Hilsey's chaplain. The same letter provides evidence for Hilsey preaching in favour of the royal supremacy, and shows him eager to demonstrate his conformity and reliability. He was installed in person in his cathedral on 30 November 1536 before a large congregation. During his short episcopate he showed himself concerned to appoint those favoured by Cromwell to religious houses. Two clergy were deprived of benefices for reasons unknown, and a mariner named Foster of Greenwich abjured heretical opinions before the bishop at Lambeth Marsh palace on 6 April 1538. Hilsey did not ordain any clergy during his episcopate, but diocesan administration appears to have been efficient, the detailed list of church incomes hinting at thoroughness for taxation purposes at least.<br>
<br>It was preaching the supremacy which brought Hilsey to prominence, and preaching which maintained his high profile. He was appointed by Cromwell to certify preachers for Paul's Cross and himself twice preached there early in 1536. But his most notable appearances there were on 24 February 1538, when he exposed the rood of Boxley to ridicule, and on 24 November following, when he did the same with the blood of Hailes. Hilsey found appointing preachers difficult, partly because of clashes with the conservative Stokesley, but also because of the hostile reception reformers often had from listeners. In 1539 Hilsey suggested that the bishop of London was in a better position to certify preachers, as only Hilsey himself or his chaplain John Bird were willing to take a reforming line. Bird preached at the cross on 20 July 1538 and clearly followed Hilsey's reformist thinking, as Stokesley complained, although Bird's subsequent career as bishop of Chester suggests pragmatism rather than thoroughgoing protestantism, which might raise questions about Hilsey's own theological radicalism. Hilsey's devotion to the pulpit is nevertheless clear&#151;his last sermon at Paul's Cross was delivered only eight days before he died&#151;and his preaching aroused much opposition; in 1539 he claimed to go in fear of his life. His strong views, and perhaps his earlier performance as visitor of the friaries, prompted demands for his removal during the Pilgrimage of Grace, and though he does not seem to have been as radical as fellow bishops like Latimer and Shaxton, in 1537 he was described as &#145;Knave bishop and heretic&#146; and as &#145;heretic and Loller&#146;  (<span class="italic">LP Henry VIII</span>, 12/1, no. 530; 13/1 no. 715).<br>
<br>As far as monks and friars were concerned, Hilsey continued to demonstrate reforming zeal. He criticized one Harcocke of Norwich for seditious preaching and moral laxity, so showing that he maintained his broader role of provincial of his order with some diligence. But he clearly felt no automatic hostility towards the regulars, for in 1535 he defended the patronage rights of Langley Priory, and in 1538 he wrote to commend a friar to Cromwell for his learning. There is no record of disharmony with his own cathedral priory, notwithstanding his enthusiasm for preaching in favour of the royal supremacy.<br>
<br>Hilsey has been described as one of the &#145;more pliable&#146; bishops who helped the royal cause in the last session of the Reformation Parliament  (Lehmberg, 39). He may have assisted in the compilation of the ten articles of 1536. This, and his staunch defence of the royal supremacy, would account for his unpopularity with the Pilgrimage of Grace, but does not reveal much more about his theology than that he was a reformer who supported the king. In 1539 he published <span class="italic">The manuall of prayers, or the prymer in Englyshe, most necessary for the educacyon of chyldren</span>, at Cromwell's instigation, a mildly protestant work which reduced the number of saints invoked in the litany from fifty-eight to thirty-eight but upheld the doctrine of the real presence. He initially opposed the more conservative six articles of 1539, but even at this stage he was probably less doctrinally radical than Cranmer, Latimer, Shaxton, or Fox. Overall he can perhaps best be characterized as pragmatic, conformist, and eager to please his royal master, but none the less sincere and diligent as a diocesan bishop. Hilsey died in Rochester on 4 August 1539, his last letters complaining of &#145;cyatica&#146; and of being sick and asleep, although he preached as late as 27 July, and was still discussing the publication of his manual and the management of leases in his diocese two days later. He was buried in Rochester Cathedral on 8 August, leaving no will.<br>
