<span class="headword">Brown,  John</span>  (1749&#150;1787), <span class="occ">miniature painter and draughtsman</span>, was born on 18 June 1749 in Edinburgh, the eldest of five children of Samuel Brown (1722&#150;1787), and his wife and cousin, Agnes Fyfe Scoular (1716&#150;1787). His father was a watchmaker and deacon of the Hammermen of Edinburgh and a free burgess of Peebles and Edinburgh, and his uncle James Scoular was a musical instrument maker; his cousin James Scoular or Scouler (1740&#150;1812) was also a miniaturist. John Brown studied at the Trustees' Academy, Edinburgh, probably under William Delacour and then Charles Pavillon. By 1769 he was in London, where he ordered a camera obscura, an instrument which he regarded as &#145;useful and even necessary to a landscape painter&#146;  (Pressly, 55). On 15 October 1769 he was ready to set sail from Falmouth for Italy in the company of David Erskine, who was well connected in Rome.<br>
<br>Brown was fortunate in not only having connections to Roman society through Erskine's cousin, Charles, later Cardinal Erskine, but also to its artistic circle through friendship with his fellow Scot Alexander Runciman, who was there from 1767 and who was part of the circle of artists around Henry Fuseli. By spring 1772 Brown was travelling as draughtsman to the antiquary and collector Charles Townley and his companion William Young. Their extensive tour of the lesser-known parts of southern Italy, Sicily, and Malta was documented by Young in his <span class="italic">Journal of a summer's excursion by the road of Montecasino to Naples, and from there over all the southern parts of Italy, Sicily and Malta, in the year 1772</span> ([1773?]), and by Townley, in his personal papers. However, neither Young nor Townley provides a record of Brown's activities and few of the drawings of antiquities made on this tour survive. It was during this tour that Brown contracted malaria.<br>
<br>Townley and Brown enjoyed a warm relationship, and Brown was far from intellectually inferior to his more privileged companions. He was later described by John Burnett, Lord Monboddo, as &#145;more learned in the Italian arts of painting, sculpture, music and poetry than any man I ever conversed with&#146;  (Brown, iii). On his return to Rome in 1773 Brown, probably through Runciman, became involved with Fuseli and his circle; his intellectual interests no doubt found resonance with the Swiss artist's. In Rome, Brown made numerous studies of Roman life as well as sensitive portraits. He worked in pencil, and pen and ink, and like other members of the circle developed &#145;a more emotionally expressive and dramatic approach&#146; which evolved into &#145;a homogeneous style&#146; through artistic exchange  (Pressly, ix). <span class="italic">The Stiletto Merchant</span> (<i>c</i>.1775&#150;80; Pierpont Morgan Library, New York), a scene of sinister dramatically illuminated nightlife, and carefully observed character, is one of Brown's most potent images. The same threatening atmosphere is also found in <span class="italic">Woman Standing among Friars</span> (Cleveland Museum of Art), which employs similar dramatic techniques of strongly contrasting dark and light, forcefully observed character bordering on caricature, and a sinuous line in drawing, typical of Fuseli's circle. Brown also drew the antiquities and landscape of Rome, including <span class="italic">A View of the Coliseum at Rome</span>, which he exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1774, and <span class="italic">The Basilica of Maxentius [and Constantine]</span> (<i>c</i>.1774&#150;6; NG Scot.), and continued to work for Townley, producing drawings of antique sculpture.<br>
<br>Brown was in Florence by 31 August 1776, where he drew in the Uffizi: its director described him as &#145;esatto e diligente, modesto, quiete&#146;  (Ingamells, 138). Thomas Jones met him at the English Hotel in November 1776, and with Christopher Ebden, the architect, the artists visited the collection of Lord Cowper. Brown seems to have remained in Florence for the rest of his time in Italy, continuing to work for Townley and visiting Venice in 1779.<br>
<br>Brown was probably in London by March 1780 and thereafter returned to Scotland. His most important commission there was for a group of thirty-one small-scale portrait drawings (Scot. NPG) of the members of the Society of Antiquaries, commissioned by David Steuart Erskine, eleventh earl of Buchan, between 1780 and 1781 at the cost of 1 guinea each. He may have visited London shortly after this date but was certainly in Edinburgh in 1784 when he sat for a remarkably animated double portrait with and by Runciman (Scot. NPG), for Erskine. He married Mary, daughter of Charles Esplin, variously described as a merchant, painter, and limner, of New Kirk parish, Edinburgh, on 2 February 1786; they had one son, Charles. In that same year he travelled to London; however, the malaria he contracted in Italy forced him to return home, and after making the voyage by sea he died at Leith on 5 September 1787. He was buried on 6 September at Greyfriars burial-ground, Edinburgh. In 1789 his <span class="italic">Letters upon the Poetry and Music of the Italian Opera; Addressed to a Friend</span> were published by their recipient Lord Monboddo, who in the introduction acclaimed Brown as &#145;one of the greatest artists that ever was in Scotland&#146; who, on the subject of this work, was &#145;more learned &hellip; than any man in Great Britain&#146;  (Brown, iii).<br>
