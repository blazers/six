<span class="headword">Owen,  Richard</span>  (1606&#150;1683), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, was the son of <a name="cosubject_20986"></a><span class="headword">Cadwallader Owen</span>  (<em>c.</em>1562&#150;1617), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, who came from Maentwrog, Merioneth, and who matriculated from Jesus College, Oxford, on 24 November 1581, graduated BA in 1583, and proceeded MA in 1589. In 1585 Cadwallader was elected a fellow of Oriel College, and he proceeded BD in 1603, but he must have resigned by 1606, before his marriage to Blanche, daughter of John Roberts, the younger brother of Lewis Anwyl of Parc, Merioneth. In 1608 Owen became rector of Llanbrynmair in the same county, and two years later he also became the sinecure rector there. He was known as a great debater and used the name &#145;Sic doces&#146;. He is also supposed to have written several works, but nothing is known of them. He died in 1617 and was buried on 6 April at Llanbrynmair.<br>
<br>Richard Owen was born on 3 October 1606 at Llanfechain, Montgomeryshire, and baptized there on 7 October. He matriculated at Oxford on 28 June 1622 and entered Oriel College as a servitor. He was a <span class="roman">Bible</span> clerk from October 1624 until 2 February 1627, graduated BA on 19 February 1625, was Dudley exhibitioner from 30 March to 25 October 1626, and on 21 March 1628 was elected a fellow of his college. He proceeded MA on 22 June 1630. At an unknown date he resigned his fellowship and married Anne, whose other name is unknown; they had ten children. In 1634 Owen became rector of Llanfechain, but he was &#145;drawn to the richer livings of the English dioceses&#146;  (Richards, <span class="italic">Puritan Movement</span>, 6). On 10 February 1636 he was installed as the vicar of Eltham, Kent, and on 2 September 1638 he was instituted to the rectory of St Swithin at London Stone. On 4 December that year he proceeded BD.<br>
<br>In 1643, as a consequence of his royalist sympathies, Owen was ejected from his livings, but he continued to live at Eltham, where he was on friendly terms with John Evelyn. As the diarist noted, Owen frequently preached and administered the sacrament at Evelyn's house at Sayes Court, as well as baptizing his son and churching his wife. Owen is supposed to have published in 1650, as <span class="italic">Elenchus motuum nuperorum in Anglia</span>, a free translation and amplification in Latin of George Bate's <span class="italic">Royal Apologie</span> (1648). He also translated into English, but did not publish, most, if not all, of Juvenal's satires. In 1657 he supplied &#145;som British proverbs&#146; for James Howell to enter in his <span class="italic">Lexicon tetraglotton</span>.<br>
<br>Meanwhile, his wife, Anne, having died in March 1653, Owen married, on 6 January 1655, Amy Kidwell, with whom he had at least two sons. On 13 November 1656, with the support of the vice-chancellor of Oxford, John Owen, and Joseph Caryl, he petitioned the council of state for a licence to preach. His appeal was referred to the committee for the approbation of public preachers, and on 30 December he was approved. In the same year he was appointed minister of North Cray, Kent, while in 1658 he resigned his position at Eltham.<br>
<br>Following the Restoration, Owen retained North Cray, and after being given the right to choose which living to hold by act of parliament he was nominated to St Swithin's. On 1 August 1660 he was created DD at Oxford and on 16 August was appointed to the prebend of Reculverland at St Paul's, London. He was held in &#145;high esteem for his holy life and conversation, for his orthodoxness in judgement, conformity to the true ancient doctrine and discipline of the Church of England, and in the former revolutions, for his loyalty to his sacred majesty&#146;  (Williams, 386). His one extant sermon was delivered at St Alfege, London, on 8 May 1666, the sixth anniversary of the proclamation of the king in London, and published as <span class="italic">Paulus, multiformis concio ad clerum</span> (1666). The family friendship with the Evelyns endured: in 1680 Amy Owen wrote an amusing letter to John Evelyn and received a reply on the subject of her &#145;trading for tulips&#146;  (<span class="italic">Diary and Correspondence</span>, 1.41&#150;2).<br>
<br>Owen made his will on 23 January 1683 and died shortly afterwards; he was buried at Eltham, as he had wished, on 27 January. He was survived by his wife, Amy (<i>d</i>. 1694), son, John, and daughter, Elizabeth Evans; nine sons and three daughters who had predeceased him had been commemorated by Owen on a marble inscription in Eltham church in 1679.<br>
