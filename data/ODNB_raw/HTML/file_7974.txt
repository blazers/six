<span class="headword">Downes,  John</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1712?), <span class="occ">theatre prompter and historian</span>, is first heard of in June 1661 when he took the part of Haly in the premi&egrave;re performance of part 1 of Sir William Davenant's <span class="italic">The Siege of Rhodes</span> at the opening of the Lincoln's Inn Fields Theatre in the presence of royalty, and, as he himself reports, was &#145;spoil'd &hellip; for an Actor&#146; by stage-fright  (Downes, 1987, 73). According to the lord chamberlain's records, Downes was sworn as a comedian in the Duke of York's Company on 27 June 1664, and as a comedian in the King's Company successively on 12 January 1688, 22 February 1695, and about 20 April 1697. Some time in the 1660s he became prompter to the Duke's Company. Following the merger of the Duke's and the King's companies in 1682 he worked for the United Company until the split of 1694; thereafter he was a member of Betterton's Company at Lincoln's Inn Fields and, from 1705, at the Haymarket, until his retirement in October 1706.<br>
<br>&#145;[B]eing long Conversant with &hellip; Plays and Actors&#146;  (Downes, 1987, 2), Downes produced the first substantial work of theatre history in English: <span class="italic">Roscius Anglicanus, or, An Historical Review of the English Stage</span> (1708). Usually written by outsiders, earlier publications on the subject had been either scrappy and amateurish in their treatment of Restoration theatre (for example James Wright's <span class="italic">Historia histrionica</span>, 1699) or chiefly concerned with printed drama (such as Gerard Langbaine's <span class="italic">Momus triumphans</span>, 1688, and <span class="italic">An Account of the English Dramatick Poets</span>, 1691). However quirky its chronology, chaotic its narrative, and spotty its coverage of the King's Company, <span class="italic">Roscius Anglicanus</span> is the most comprehensive account of repertory, acting personnel, and casting in the Restoration theatre. Much maligned by earlier critics, Downes's accuracy has been vindicated by modern scholars. When approached with a suitable degree of caution&#151;for instance, the cast lists it provides for stock plays should not be taken to reflect the casting of the earliest performance&#151;<span class="italic">Roscius Anglicanus</span> is a surprisingly reliable source of information about casting, especially of new plays, about actors, their parts and particular strengths and weaknesses, about the commercial success of individual plays, the length of their original runs, and their place in the repertory, and, to a lesser extent, about their authorship. Downes treats plays as scripts for performance, not literary artefacts, and thus is less interested in the artistic quality of the drama. What matters to him is whether the play was profitable to the company (and the playwright) and whether it became a stock offering. He routinely records any major outlay on costumes, scenery, and special effects. For instance, he attributes the success of &#145;<span class="italic">The Tragedy of Macbeth</span>, alter'd by Sir <span class="italic">William Davenant</span>&#146; to its &#145;being drest in all it's Finery, as new Cloath's, new Scenes, Machines, as flyings for the Witches; with all the Singing and Dancing in it&#146;; and he notes the loss incurred by the Duke's Company when the first run of John Dryden's opera <span class="italic">Albion and Albanius</span> was interrupted by Monmouth's rebellion, the play &#145;not Answering half the Charge they were at&#146;  (Downes, 1987, 71, 84).<br>
<br>We know nothing about Downes's marital situation, but he seems to have had a son who aspired to be a musician. A letter of 27 January 1707 addressed to the lord chamberlain by Owen Swiney, the manager of the Haymarket Company, explains that &#145;young Downes&#146; had been denied employment because of lack of qualifications  (LC 7/3, fols. 94&#150;5, quoted in Downes, 1987, xi). However, the letter expresses readiness to grant a pension to Downes <i>p&egrave;re</i> according to the lord chamberlain's suggestions. Downes may have died in 1712, for according to <span class="italic">The Registers of St Paul's Church, Covent Garden, London</span> a John Downes was buried there on 4 June 1712.<br>
