<span class="headword">Williams,  William Peere</span>  (1664/5&#150;1736), <span class="occ">law reporter</span>, was the only son of Peere Williams (<i>d</i>. 1705) of Hoddesdon and his wife, Joanna Oeiles (<i>d</i>. 1705). His father was a member of Gray's Inn (admitted 14 August 1635), and clerk of estreats (1652&#150;79); his mother was of Dutch descent. Educated at Trinity College, Oxford (admitted 10 May 1679, aged fourteen), he was admitted to Gray's Inn on 14 September 1680. He was called to the bar on 11 November 1687, subsequently being bencher of his inn (1722), and treasurer (1726&#150;8).<br>
<br>Williams was counsel in various cases of public importance, for George Seaton, earl of Winton, impeached in 1716 after the Jacobite rising of 1715, and for the duke of Queensberry in his claim to sit in the House of Lords after the Union by virtue of a British peerage. His general practice was in chancery, however, where he acquired much business, and a study has shown that he was one of the most active figures in the court  (Lemmings, 291). A frequent client was James Brydges, first duke of Chandos, through whose influence he was elected MP for Bishop's Castle, Shropshire, in the parliament of 1722&#150;7. In 1722 he purchased from Brydges the manor of Northolt, Middlesex, having declined the duke's offer of his Radnorshire and Bishop's Castle estates. Williams amassed a considerable landed property in other counties, and was reported at the time of his death to be worth &pound;150,000. He married on 10 June 1697 Anne (<i>d</i>. 1724), second daughter and coheir of Sir George Hutchins, king's sergeant and a commissioner of the great seal (1690&#150;93). Williams died on 10 June 1736 and was buried in the parish church, Broxbourne, Hertfordshire.<br>
<br>Williams and his wife had four sons and two daughters. His eldest son, Hutchins Williams, was created baronet on 4 April 1747. The reporter's other sons were William Peere Williams, a lawyer, Frederick Williams, rector of Peakirk, Northamptonshire, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29506/', "George James Williams")</script>, wit, familiarly known as &#145;Gilly&#146;.<br>
<br>Williams collaborated with William Melmoth in the edition of Thomas Vernon's reports of chancery cases (1726&#150;9), but he did not himself publish his own collection, which was published after his death by his son, William Peere Williams (also of Gray's Inn and bencher from 27 May 1742). His collection of chancery cases was the product of a long professional career, covering the judgments in the court under seven lord chancellors, and the reports have always been regarded as a classical repository of equity jurisprudence in the early eighteenth century. William Peere Williams jun., published the first two volumes in 1740 (second edn, 1746) and the third in 1749, under the title <span class="italic">Reports of Cases Argued and Determined in the High Court of Chancery, and of some Special Cases Adjudged in the Court of King's Bench</span>. The reason for deferring the publication of the third volume was said in the preface to be the need for further revision and in some cases to supply the final decision from the registrar's decree books. The comparative quality of the third volume has been questioned, but the reports were dedicated to Lord Hardwicke and received his imprimatur, the chancellor contributing his own notes in at least one important case. The whole work has been cited with approval by later judges. The three folio volumes were reprinted in 1768, and their value enhanced by Samuel Compton Cox, who added scholarly notes to the fourth and fifth editions in 1787 and 1793.<br>
