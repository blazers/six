</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Brogan, Sir  Denis William</span>  (1900&#150;1974), <span class="occ">historian</span>, was born on 11 August 1900 in Glasgow, the eldest of the four sons of Denis Brogan, a master tailor, and his second wife, Elizabeth Toner. His father, a native of co. Donegal, had briefly lived in the USA and Brogan grew up in a home responsive to the politics of both Ireland and America. Educated at Rutherglen Academy, Glasgow University (MA, 1923), and Balliol College, Oxford, where he obtained a first class in history in 1925, he was guided towards the USA by Samuel Eliot Morison, then visiting Harmsworth professor at Oxford. A year at Harvard on a Rockefeller research fellowship established the study of the American past and the American present as the ruling passion of his life.<br>
<br>On his return from the USA, after a brief period on the staff of <span class="italic">The Times</span>, Brogan was appointed in 1928 as lecturer in history at University College, London, and in 1930 as lecturer in politics at the London School of Economics. He was married in 1931 to Olwen Phillis Frances, an archaeologist, daughter of William Kendall, medical practitioner. They had three sons and a daughter.<br>
<br>The literary product of these years was his best-known book, <span class="italic">The American Political System</span> (1933). Appearing at a turning point both in American national development and in British awareness of the United States, its freshness, pungency, wit, and zest rediscovered America for a generation of British readers and profoundly influenced the perception of American politics in both academic and non-academic circles. The book's emphasis was on the actualities of the political process, made vivid by personal observation, a brilliant if teasing allusiveness, and an astonishing breadth of reading in both contemporary and historical literature. <span class="italic">An Introduction to American Politics</span> (1954) had the same qualities; it was indeed a comprehensively revised and rewritten version.<br>
<br>In 1934 Brogan left London for Oxford, as fellow and tutor at Corpus Christi College. There he expanded his academic interests to take in the study of France, with a brio, a range, and an intimacy analogous to his study of the USA. The impressive first-fruit of this was <span class="italic">The Development of Modern France, 1870&#150;1939</span> (1940; revised edition, <span class="italic">1870&#150;1959</span>, 1967), over twice the length of <span class="italic">The American Political System</span>, and packed with detail. Here for the first time, in English or French, the complex phenomena of modern French politics, at home and abroad, are reduced to a comprehensible narrative that does justice to economic and social factors but keeps the individual, from peasant to president, at the heart of the story. The tone is affectionate, but free of illusion, vivacious and sharp-edged. A later study, <span class="italic">The French Nation from Napoleon to P&eacute;tain, 1814&#150;1940</span> (1957), is marked on a smaller scale by the same characteristics.<br>
<br>To fit a figure like Brogan into the machine of the Second World War was never easy. He began in the foreign research and press service, moved briefly to the American division of the Ministry of Information, was then for a short time with the political warfare executive, but finally found his niche with the overseas services of the BBC. Perhaps one should rather say &#145;niches&#146; because Brogan's exuberant energies overflowed from the European service to the North American service; in each capacity his role was that of an intelligence officer, providing background information and policy guidance from his diverse and capacious store of contemporary and historical knowledge. Thrown off, almost, amid these taxing labours was <span class="italic">The English People: Impressions and Observations</span> (1943), characteristically precise, yet wide-ranging and shrewd, an essay in presenting the distinctive features of the English way of life by &#145;a foreigner of a kind&#146;. <span class="italic">The American Problem</span> (1944) was a series of loosely linked essays on the evolution of modern America, which discharges an analogous function from west to east.<br>
<br>In the spring of 1939 Brogan had been elected to the professorship of political science at Cambridge and to a fellowship at Peterhouse and to this he returned at the war's end. His approach to his chair was that of a liberal, a pragmatist, and a historically minded student of institutions. Sceptical of systems, suspicious alike of sociological and philosophical abstractions, he warned in his inaugural lecture, published as <span class="italic">The Study of Politics</span> (1946), against imposing on his subject &#145;a degree of abstractness or bogus neutrality that it cannot stand&#146;. His lectures, delivered with a minimum of notes, regrettably do not survive, but some of the fruits of his approach can be gathered from <span class="italic">The Price of Revolution</span> (1951).<br>
<br>For a historian and an Americanist it was regrettable that Brogan produced no study of the American past on a scale comparable to <span class="italic">The Development of Modern France</span>. His <span class="italic">Abraham Lincoln</span> (1935, revised 1974, posthumously) is a miniature, albeit a classic one. <span class="italic">The Era of Franklin D. Roosevelt</span> (1950, published in Britain as <span class="italic">Roosevelt and the New Deal</span>, 1952) is a useful, balanced, compact treatment curiously lacking in its author's individual touch. <span class="italic">American Aspects</span> (1964), which reprints a number of historical and political articles, including the classic &#145;The illusion of American omnipotence&#146;, has far more of Brogan's range and historical penetration about it. The fact is, however, that the student who would glean all that Brogan has to offer would have to search the pages, particularly the review pages, of a host of journals, but in particular the <span class="italic">Times Literary Supplement</span>, where his fecund genius, particularly in his later years, found a more natural outlet.<br>
<br>Brogan retired from his chair in 1968 and died in Cambridge on 5 January 1974. In addition to many honorary doctorates from France and the United States, he was an honorary LLD of Glasgow (1946) and an honorary DLitt of Oxford (1969). He was an honorary fellow of Peterhouse, Cambridge, and Corpus Christi College, Oxford, and became a fellow of the British Academy in 1955. He was knighted in 1963.<br>
