<span class="headword">Hill, Sir  John McGregor</span>  (1921&#150;2008), <span class="occ">nuclear physicist and public servant</span>, was born on 21 February 1921 at Westminster Nursing Home, 50 Liverpool Road, Chester, the son of John Campbell Hill (1888&#150;1982), a science teacher at Chester College of Scottish background who later became a schools inspector, and his wife, Margaret Elizabeth, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Park (1893&#150;1984). The family moved to Richmond upon Thames in Surrey and he was educated at Richmond county grammar school and King's College, London, where he gained a first in physics. In 1941 he joined the Royal Air Force and spent the rest of the Second World War working in radar development, ending with the rank of flight-lieutenant. On demobilization in 1946 he returned to academic physics at the Cavendish laboratory and St John's College in Cambridge. After gaining a PhD in 1948 for work on radioactive substances with short half-lives, he became a lecturer in physics at the University of London. Meanwhile, on 25 October 1947, at All Saints' Church, Cambridge, he married Nora Eileen Hellett (<i>b</i>. 1927), a nurse at Addenbrookes Hospital, and daughter of Henry John Hellett. They had two sons and a daughter.<br>
<br>In the late 1940s the Labour government led by Clement Attlee initiated the development of nuclear weapons, with Christopher Hinton in charge of fissile materials. Technologically complex factories were required, the largest being the reactors (or &#145;piles&#146;) at Windscale, Cumberland, which would produce plutonium. Expertise in relevant fields was in desperately short supply and in 1950 Hill was recruited as a member of Hinton's team overseeing the completion of Windscale, working partly on site and partly at Risley in Lancashire. The targets were met and plutonium was delivered in time for Britain's first nuclear test in October 1952.<br>
<br>Starting in 1953, Hill, working with J. C. C. Stewart, produced a series of important reports on the future of the industrial side of the nuclear project, and in particular its costs and efficiency. It was the beginning of an involvement with nuclear energy strategy which dominated the rest of his life. He also participated in the design of Calder Hall, the more advanced reactors built next to the Windscale site which were celebrated in 1956 as the first in the world to deliver nuclear-generated electricity to a civil supply system. In that year Britain's nuclear project reached a peak in public esteem, appearing to be a leader in a field of remarkable promise, but the descent soon began. In October 1957 fire in one of the Windscale reactors caused a release of radioactive contamination into the atmosphere, which in turn made necessary the dumping of milk from Cumberland dairy herds. It was the world's worst reactor accident and remained so for another twenty-two years, and there was considerable public alarm. Hill, by now deputy director of technical policy at Risley, was closely involved in the aftermath. Sir William Penney conducted a swift official inquiry but the government statement which followed, though it calmed external concerns, left staff at Windscale and Risley unsatisfied and aggrieved. Hill was asked to review the evidence on the key early stages of the accident and his report in January 1958 blamed faulty instrumentation more than human error. His account was given considerable credit in the official history of the accident, published in 1992.<br>
<br>Hill was by now a rising star. A slight man of medium height, quick-moving and active, he combined a certain modesty with a confidence founded on deep scientific knowledge. He was an exceptional committee chairman with a gift for getting disparate people to work together, and was known for always asking incisive questions. Hinton, a difficult man to please, rated him highly for his judgement and willingness to show the courage of his convictions. Hill soon became manager of the production group, overseeing the full range of factories supporting the industry as well as Windscale (which had been renamed Sellafield after the accident), Calder Hall, and a further reactor site at Chapelcross. He would later say this was the job he most enjoyed, but he did not stay long. In 1964 he became a member of the UK Atomic Energy Authority (UKAEA) and three years later he succeeded Penney as chairman, a post he held until retirement in 1981.<br>
<br>Hill's vision, which altered little, was of a strong British nuclear industry supplying a substantial proportion of the country's electricity needs well beyond the time when North Sea oil ran out. At its heart would be fast-breeder reactors with uniquely efficient fuel consumption, producing relatively little waste. Prototypes were in development at Dounreay in Caithness. This vision, he argued, promised a balanced, sustainable, economical, and independent energy future, as well as one with strong export potential. The state had an essential enabling role to play in delivering it, with UKAEA conducting the research and development. Though Hill made his case eloquently and persistently, and from a position of authority, it was not to be.<br>
<br>The 1970s were exceptionally difficult years for the country and the nuclear industry, in which successive governments found it impossible to make strategic choices. They had to weigh factors such as the oil price shock of 1973, the discovery and landing of North Sea oil, turbulence in the coal industry, and spells of economic difficulty that brought declines in electricity consumption and demands for government stimulus. At the same time public distaste for matters nuclear was growing, encouraged by Sir Brian Flowers's report of 1976, on &#145;Nuclear Power and the Environment&#146; (which emphasized the risks and uncertainties of nuclear energy and called for a halt to further reactors until the problem of disposing the waste safely could be solved), and the Three Mile Island accident in the USA in 1979. Worse still, the British nuclear industry seemed unable to fulfil the promise of cheap energy that in earlier years had dazzled politicians and public alike.<br>
<br>The first-generation civil reactors, known as Magnox stations, though safe and often described as workhorses, proved expensive and troublesome to operate, and UKAEA's successor design, the advanced gas-cooled reactor (AGR), soon ran into problems. These difficulties were not of UKAEA's making but flowed in large measure from a government policy of entrusting plant construction to a number of weak and ill-equipped private industry consortia. Hill declared that this policy did &#145;more damage to the British nuclear industry than any other decision &hellip; more damage than all the other decisions put together&#146;  (<span class="italic">New Scientist</span>, 17 July 1975). Besides the AGR the UKAEA also offered another design, the steam-generating heavy water reactor, as a possible technology to fill the gap until fast-breeder reactors became available, but neither attracted the principal customer, the Central Electricity Generating Board, which preferred the pressurized water reactor made by the American Westinghouse corporation. Ministers, buffeted by events and under pressure from vested interests, could not choose, and meanwhile UKAEA's long-term case was undermined as the fast-breeder reactor began to take on mirage-like properties (always seeming to need a few more years in development).<br>
<br>Through it all, Hill (who was knighted in 1969) remained a patient and persistent advocate for the UKAEA. Though he was sometimes at odds with ministers, notably the Labour energy secretary, Tony Benn, it is a measure of his standing that he was twice reappointed UKAEA chairman and that his fourteen-year tenure was unusually long in a public service post at such a high level at this time. His talents, however, were sometimes less obvious to the public. He was uncomfortable on television and for years maintained a brisk, almost dismissive tone about nuclear anxieties that could be seen as condescending. In 1977 he made international headlines by describing as &#145;science fiction&#146; claims (later largely vindicated) by the Soviet exile Zhores Medvedev about a nuclear waste accident in Russia in 1957. Hill later explained that his remark had related to the alleged scientific causes, rather than the fact, of the explosion, but the damage was done. By the end of the 1970s, facing an increasingly informed and sophisticated anti-nuclear lobby, he had recognized the need to give higher priority to winning public trust.<br>
<br>From 1971, alongside his role at UKAEA, Hill was chairman of British Nuclear Fuels Ltd, a state-owned corporation created from his old northern production group, with Sellafield at its heart. His hope was to build a global business in nuclear fuel reprocessing, but again he was defeated by the combination of changing public attitudes, technical difficulties, rising costs, and political hesitation. Dogged by questions about health risks at Sellafield and about the prospects for safe disposal of nuclear waste, he was dismayed to find his reassuring arguments undermined by accidents and mistakes at the site. Nor was his firm conviction that future generations would solve the long-term storage problem enough to win that argument.<br>
<br>Hill retired from UKAEA on reaching sixty, but remained chairman of British Nuclear Fuels for a further two years, and of Amersham International plc, the former radiochemical centre which produced radioactive materials for industry, from its inception in 1975 until 1988. From 1984 to 1992 he was president of the British Nuclear Forum. His vision for the British nuclear energy industry may not have been realized (the fast-breeder programme was shut down in 1994), but some of his warnings were by the end of his life judged by some to be prescient. As early as the 1970s he argued that the long-term danger to the environment from burning fossil fuels was being underestimated, and he repeatedly stressed the need to have viable alternative energy sources available when British oil and gas supplies began to run out.<br>
<br>Though regarded as an approachable man by his colleagues, Hill liked to keep his private life private. He enjoyed gardening, the occasional glass of malt whisky, and golf. He served as captain and president of the Royal Mid-Surrey Golf Club in Richmond (he lived latterly at Dominic House, Sudbrook Lane, Petersham) and in his UKAEA days he used to say that one of the tests of his management ability and his powers of delegation was whether, once in a while, he could be spared to play eighteen holes on a Friday afternoon. He died on 14 January 2008 at the Royal Star and Garter Home, Richmond upon Thames, of a chest infection and Alzheimer's disease. He was survived by his wife, Nora, and their three children.<br>
