<span class="headword">Wallop,  John</span>, first earl of Portsmouth  (1690&#150;1762), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born on 15 April 1690, the third son of John Wallop (<i>d</i>. 1694), of Farleigh Wallop, Hampshire, and his wife, Alicia (<i>d</i>. 1744), third daughter of William Borlace or Borlase, of Great Marlow, Buckinghamshire. The Wallop family had been landholders in Hampshire since at least the early fourteenth century, and in the eighteenth century claimed descent from the pre-conquest aristocracy. His great-grandfather was the parliamentarian and councillor of state under the Commonwealth, Robert Wallop. Following the death of his father in 1694 and of his elder brother Bluet Wallop from peripneumonia in 1707, he succeeded to the Wallop family estates in Hampshire. In 1708 he left Eton College to complete his education with an extended tour of Europe. On his way to Geneva he served as a volunteer at the battle of Oudenarde. Following a year at school in Geneva he travelled in Italy and Germany, where in Hanover he became acquainted with the elector, later to become George I.<br>
<br>Wallop's background and sympathies were firmly whig, and he inherited influence over the seats at Andover and Whitchurch. He failed to be elected for Hampshire in 1713, but in 1715 was returned for both Hampshire and Andover, choosing to sit for the county. On 20 May 1716 he married Lady Bridget Bennet (<i>bap</i>. 1696, <i>d</i>. 1738), eldest daughter of Charles Bennet, first earl of Tankerville. They had six sons and four daughters. He chose not to go into opposition with Robert Walpole and Charles, second Viscount Townshend, in 1717, and was rewarded with an appointment as a lord of the Treasury on 3 April. He was usually loyal to the Sunderland ministry, but voted against the repeal of the <span class="roman">Occasional Conformity and Schism Acts</span> in 1719. The return of Walpole and Townshend to the ministry in 1720 forced Wallop from office, but he was compensated on 11 June with elevation to the Lords as Baron Wallop and Viscount Lymington. He took little part in state affairs but quietly worked to establish his loyalty to Walpole. In 1731 he wrote to Charlotte Clayton suggesting that he would be a better manager of government patronage than Charles Powlett, third duke of Bolton. His appointment as chief justice in eyre north of Trent on 5 December 1732 acknowledged his loyalty. When Bolton was expelled from his offices after voting against the government on the excise in 1733, Lymington succeeded him as lord lieutenant of Hampshire (7 August 1733), vice-admiral of Hampshire, and lord warden of the New Forest (2 November 1733), and later became governor of the Isle of Wight (18 June 1734) although he then surrendered his chief justiceship. On 7 August 1739 he became a governor of the Foundling Hospital. During this period Lymington rebuilt Farleigh House, his ancestral home which had been burnt down in 1667. The south front, built in 1731, remains much as Lymington left it, but the north front was altered in 1935. His wife died of apoplexy on 12 October 1738 at Lyndhurst, Hampshire, and was buried at Farleigh Wallop. She was survived by four of her sons and a daughter. On 9 June 1741 Lymington married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/62679/', "Elizabeth Griffin (bap. 1691, d. 1762)")</script>, daughter of James Griffin, second Baron Griffin, and widow of Henry Grey. They had no children.<br>
<br>In July 1742, following Walpole's resignation, all Lymington's appointments were terminated. On 11 April 1743 he was compensated with the earldom of Portsmouth. On 19 February 1746 he was reappointed governor of the Isle of Wight, a position he held until his death. He continued to correspond with the duke of Newcastle on political and patronage matters, but seems to have kept his independence; when Newcastle wrote to Portsmouth in 1760, asking him to support the ministerial candidate at Andover, Sir Francis Blake Delaval, alongside his wife's nephew Sir John Griffin Griffin, he replied that he would only intervene in Griffin's favour and not on behalf of another candidate.<br>
<br>Portsmouth died three months after his second wife on 22 November 1762 and was buried in St Andrew's Church, Farleigh Wallop, Hampshire. A marble monument on the south wall bears a lengthy inscription of his life. His eldest son, John, Viscount Lymington (1718&#150;1749), MP for Andover from 1741 until his death, had married Catherine, daughter of John Conduitt, Sir Isaac Newton's successor as master of the Royal Mint, and a close friend of Portsmouth. Catherine was Newton's niece and coheir, and his papers and scientific papers were inherited by her eldest son, John Wallop (1742&#150;1797), who following the death of his grandfather became second earl of Portsmouth.<br>
