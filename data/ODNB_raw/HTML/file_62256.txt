<span class="headword">House,  John William</span>  (1919&#150;1984), <span class="occ">geographer</span>, was born at 23 Horton Grange Road, Horton, Bradford, Yorkshire, on 15 September 1919, the son of John Albert House, railway clerk, and his wife, Eveline, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Brunton. The family home was later at 12 Ellercroft Terrace, Lidget Green, in inner Bradford. He was educated at Bradford grammar school, where he excelled in geography and French. From Bradford he won an open exhibition to Jesus College, Oxford, where he went in 1937 to read geography. His tutor at Jesus was the formidable, distinguished, but sardonic, historical geographer J. N. L. Baker. In 1940, on graduating with a second-class degree, House joined the army, serving in the intelligence corps. On 21 February 1942, having already progressed from second lieutenant to lieutenant, he married the equally strong-minded Eva Timm (<i>b</i>. 1918), of Sheffield. She was the daughter of Albert Edward Timm, a director. Both committed Anglicans, John and Eva married in the parish church of St John the Evangelist, Abbeydale, Sheffield. They were known as a devoted couple and had two sons and two daughters. Meanwhile House's facility in French was put to good use during his wartime service in intelligence and he was awarded the m&eacute;daille de la Reconnaissance Fran&ccedil;aise by the French government in 1944. He left the army with the rank of major in 1946.<br>
<br>For the next twenty-eight years House was based in Newcastle upon Tyne, as lecturer (1946&#150;58), senior lecturer (1958&#150;61), then reader (1961&#150;3) in the geography department of the federal University of Durham's King's College. In 1963 King's College became independent as the University of Newcastle upon Tyne, and House was named as reader in applied geography. In 1964 he succeeded another Oxford geographer, George Henry Daysh, as professor and head of the Newcastle geography department, a position in which he successfully managed its growth in numbers and premises over the next ten years.<br>
<br>House's first academic paper was published in 1949. Between 1951 and his death in 1984 he published every year, often producing several publications in a single year. Altogether he produced seventy-three publications, on a wide range of themes: the industrial structure of Teesside, land use in Newcastle, the changing employment structure of the north-east, labour mobility, rural problems of the borders, the economic geography of the United Kingdom, the economic geography of France, French regional geography, the American&#150;Mexican border of the Rio Grande, and geopolitics. His research interests focused strongly on applied geography, planning, regions, and regional development. He was deeply involved in the planning of the north-east region. From 1966 to 1974 he was a member of the Northern Economic Planning Council, and from 1967 to 1970 of the Northern Pennines Rural Development Board. He was committed to serving the community, as shown by his chairmanship of the Tyneside action group for the young unemployed. His publications, including <span class="italic">Northumbrian Tweedside</span> (1956), <span class="italic">Teesside at Mid-Century</span> (1960), the edited collection <span class="italic">Northern Geographical Essays</span> (1966), and <span class="italic">Industrial Britain: the North East</span> (1969), attest the deep roots he had put down in his adopted region. The Royal Geographical Society's Murchison award in 1970 recognized these contributions.<br>
<br>Although applied geography and planning issues relating to the north-east and its economic problems formed the core of House's publications, in his well-received edited book <span class="italic">The UK Space</span> (1973) he applied his expertise to the wider canvas of the whole country. Migration was also one of his research interests. France and the United States figured prominently in his publications. His book <span class="italic">France: an Applied Geography</span> was published in 1978. He had much earlier published a traditional regional descriptive work, &#145;A comparative study of the landscapes of the plateau de Millevaches and the western Cevennes&#146;, in the <span class="italic">Transactions of the Institute of British Geographers</span> for 1954. His early interest in political geography led to a Leverhulme research fellowship in 1957&#150;8. This allowed him to carry out an extended study of the Franco-Italian border zone. Political geography continued as a leitmotif running through his research, overshadowed for a while by his north-eastern activities, until it flowered again.<br>
<br>The process of House's appointment to the Halford Mackinder professorship at Oxford in 1974 was convoluted. The school of geography's wholehearted wish was for Peter Haggett, the country's outstanding young geographer among a set of outstanding Cambridge geographers. Their quantitative revolution and modelling challenge to traditional regional geography revolutionized the discipline in the 1960s and 1970s. Haggett would have brought a new direction to Oxford geography. Thus, there was jubilation when it was announced that Haggett had been appointed to the newly established Halford Mackinder chair. Shortly afterwards, joy was followed by grief, when Haggett, for family reasons, withdrew his acceptance. Despite House's solid achievements and recognized expertise in planning and in political geography, despite his international reputation in France and the USA, and despite his complete embodiment of the protestant work ethic in his energy, publications, effective organizational skills, and meritocratic ascent, his appointment in Haggett's place was inevitably seen as second best. The fit with Oxford geography's need was not good, and he seemed less at ease in his new role than he had been in Newcastle.<br>
<br>House was a tallish, imposing figure, dark-suited, with a long, vertically lined face and thinning, brushed back, grey hair. He had a military bearing and a sense of his own achievements. His anonymous obituarist in the <span class="italic">Geographical Journal</span> described him as &#145;a little reserved with his colleagues&#146;. A formal man, he was not comfortable with the Oxford school of geography's non-hierarchic style of collegiality. Soon after arriving in Oxford he attempted to refuse appointment as an examiner for the first year undergraduate mods examination, on the grounds that it would be possible for him, as chairman, to be outvoted by two junior staff. On the other hand, he appreciated the fellowship of St Peter's College, to which the Halford Mackinder chair was attached. On his premature retirement in 1983, because of his failing health, the college elected him to an emeritus fellowship.<br>
<br>House spent two periods as a visiting professor in the USA. The first was as visiting Fulbright professor of geography at the University of Nebraska (1962&#150;3); the second as visiting professor at the University of Texas at Austin (1977&#150;8). The Nebraska placement does not seem to have had any published outcome on American or political matters, but the visit to Texas led to his book <span class="italic">The Rio Grande Frontier</span> (1982) and to his edited volume <span class="italic">US Public Policies</span> (1983). His stay in Texas led also to a revitalized interest in political geography and in geopolitics, the field in which Halford Mackinder had been the iconic exponent. Oxford University awarded him the degree of DLitt in 1980 in recognition of his publications.<br>
<br>In Newcastle and Oxford John and Eva House chose to live in rural areas, Corbridge and Islip respectively. The village environment was the one in which they felt most at home. As his obituary in the <span class="italic">Geographical Journal</span> stated, &#145;here he found time to serve on Church Councils, to be a member of the Royal British Legion and to participate fully in the activities of the local dramatic society. He was also a keen allotment holder&#146;. It was a severe disappointment to him that because of his cancer he was not able to succeed Jean Gottmann as head of the Oxford school of geography, and that he was not able to deliver his presidential address in person to the Institute of British Geographers in Durham in 1984. Instead he recorded it on video and it was played to the conference. The address, entitled &#145;War, peace, and conflict resolution: towards an Indian Ocean model&#146;, dealt with the new political geography, and geopolitics. His final paper, with his Newcastle political geography colleague Peter Taylor, was published posthumously. He died at his home, 38 North Street, Islip, on 1 February 1984, of cancer, and was survived by his wife and their four children.<br>
