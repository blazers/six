<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Forrest,  Edwin</span>  (1806&#150;1872), <span class="occ">actor</span>, was born on 9 March 1806 on George Street, Old Southwark, Philadelphia, the sixth of the seven children of William Forrest (1758&#150;1819), a Scottish-American bank messenger, and his wife, Rebecca Lauman (1763&#150;1847). As a young man he took elocution lessons and performed with an amateur acting society, the conventional route to an acting career in a profession still dominated by English theatrical traditions. He also trained his body by practising acrobatics, a regimen he continued throughout his life. Soon after his d&eacute;but in 1820, he went west with a travelling troupe and finally arrived in New Orleans, where he performed for two years. In Albany, New York, in 1825 he played several supporting roles for Edmund Kean. His own performance of Othello in New York city the following year boosted Forrest to stardom, the first native-born American to achieve this status. By 1828 he was touring the country with a repertory that included Macbeth, Mark Antony, and major roles in John Banim's <span class="italic">Damon and Pythias</span> and Otway's <span class="italic">Venice Preserv'd</span>.<br>
<br>The young star was 5 feet 10 inches tall, with a muscular build and a clear, melodious voice that ranged easily from a low growl to rafter-shaking power. In acting style he combined Kean's passionate outbursts with the deliberate declamation of the Kemble tradition. His powerful performances generally gravitated between long passages of rhetorical restraint with little movement and moments of quick action and emotional release.<br>
<br>To increase his starring roles, Forrest held the first play competition in America in 1828. John Augustus Stone won the contest with <span class="italic">Metamora, or, The Last of the Wampanoags</span>, a heroic melodrama featuring a Native American hero. In the eight competitions that followed over the next nineteen years, Forrest awarded prizes to three other plays that he turned into successful star vehicles: <span class="italic">The Gladiator</span> (1831), by Robert Montgomery Bird; <span class="italic">The Broker of Bogota</span> (1834), also by Bird; and <span class="italic">Jack Cade</span> (1841), by Robert T. Conrad. Most of these prize plays featured a hero of primal strength and virtue fighting aristocratic oppression to gain the freedom of his people.<br>
<br>Because of Forrest's charismatic appeal and republican persona, his performances in the 1830s and 1840s induced hero worship from lower- and middle-class males in American cities. His fame increased after a successful London d&eacute;but in 1836; the London press disliked his prize plays, but praised his passionate sincerity. While in England, on 23 June 1837, Forrest married Catherine Norton Sinclair (1819&#150;1891), the daughter of a professional singer and actress. He seriously considered an offer from the New York Democrats to run for Congress in 1838. By 1840 his identification with workers and Jacksonian Democrats led most &eacute;lite playgoers in America to disdain him.<br>
<br>Upper-class antagonism to Forrest continued through the 1840s, reaching a climax in the bloody Astor Place Opera House riot of 1849. The riot derived from a feud between Forrest and the English star William Charles Macready that began in London in 1845. Forrest believed that Macready had hired a spectator to hiss his Macbeth (a charge never proved) and returned this affront by hissing Macready's Hamlet in Edinburgh (where he was joined by others in the audience). Public exchanges of letters kept the actors' rivalry simmering in the newspapers on both sides of the Atlantic, where both stars had their advocates. When Macready went to New York in 1849, workers claiming Forrest as their hero vowed vengeance. To them, Macready and the opera house where he was scheduled to perform were symbols of English and American aristocratic oppression. In the midst of the riot on 10 May, the state militia opened fire, killing twenty-two and wounding scores of others. Although he probably welcomed the show of support, Forrest took no part in the rioters' plans and actions. The Astor Place riot had begun as a dispute between two actors, but it went far beyond their rivalry to engage nationalistic and class-based antagonisms that sharply divided the pro-English &eacute;lite who cheered for Macready from the working-class fans of Forrest.<br>
<br>The breakup of Forrest's marriage and a scandalous divorce trial in 1851 kept the star's name in the headlines. With little evidence, Forrest accused his wife of infidelity, gained a legal separation, and finally sued for divorce. Catherine Forrest brought suit on the same grounds; her lawyers easily proved that Forrest had frequented a house of prostitution and committed adultery with an actress while on tour. The jury upheld Catherine's innocence and Forrest's guilt on every count, and she won her divorce suit, ending their childless marriage. Seeking consolation from his fans, Forrest acted his starring roles at the Broadway Theatre in New York for sixty-nine performances, a record at the time. The Forrest divorce case served as a lightning rod for social antagonisms; it dramatized the division between those who held to traditional patriarchal values regarding family honour and others who favoured notions of mutual responsibility in marriage.<br>
<br>Beginning in 1857, Forrest cut back on his touring to rest for increasingly long periods at his home in Philadelphia. But the star continued to perform, even after an attack of sciatica in 1865 slowed his still powerful body. He last appeared as a platform speaker shortly before his death, which occurred in Philadelphia on 12 December 1872. He was buried four days later in St Paul's churchyard in Philadelphia. His will established his former residence as the Edwin Forrest Home for retired actors.<br>
