<span class="headword">Harrod, Sir  (Henry) Roy Forbes</span>  (1900&#150;1978), <span class="occ">economist</span>, was born in London on 13 February 1900, the only child of Henry Dawes Harrod (<i>d</i>. 1918), a solicitor and a member of the London metals exchange, and his wife, Frances Marie Desir&eacute;e, who was one of the eleven children of John Forbes-Robertson, art critic and journalist, and the younger sister of Johnston Forbes-Robertson, the actor. Frances Harrod, aided by her literary and artistic gifts and her maternal determination, exercised an immense influence on her son, overshadowing that of her husband, whose later years were darkened by his bankruptcy (after misinvesting his remaining capital in a copper mine in Anglesey, he was &#145;hammered&#146; on the metals exchange in 1907 and remained an undischarged bankrupt until 1917, the year before his death).<br>
<br>Roy Harrod won a scholarship to St Paul's School (from its preparatory school, Colet Court), but stayed there for only two years. His mother insisted that he move to Westminster School, which he duly entered as a king's scholar at the second attempt in 1913. Five years later he won a history scholarship to New College, Oxford. After a period from September 1918 in the Royal Garrison Artillery, he went to Oxford and obtained a first in <i>literae humaniores</i> in 1921, despite a discordant relationship with his philosophy tutor, H. W. B. Joseph, and another first, in modern history, only twelve months later. He was elected by Christ Church, Oxford, to a lectureship in 1922, and in 1924 to a studentship (that is, fellowship) in modern history and economics, which he held for forty-three years until he retired in 1967, combining it for the final fifteen years with the Nuffield readership in international economics. He was a fellow of Nuffield College, Oxford, from 1938 to 1947 and from 1954 to 1958. From 1945 to 1961 he was joint editor of the <span class="italic">Economic Journal</span>. On 8 January 1938 he married, at St Mary's Church, Snettisham, Norfolk, <a href="#cosubject_95793">Wilhelmine Margaret Eve (Billa) Cresswell [<i>see below</i>]</a>. They had two sons.<br>
<br>Apart from some study of British currency, banking, and public finance in the context of the Oxford modern history school, Harrod's immersion in economics began after his election to Christ Church. His principal mentors in the subject were J. M. Keynes and colleagues (with whom, at King's College, Cambridge, he spent the autumn of 1922 as part of two terms' leave before embarking on his tutorial responsibilities at Christ Church), and F. Y. Edgeworth, Drummond professor of political economy at Oxford. His own principal contributions to economics, dating mostly from the 1930s, covered three main areas of theory: the firm; aggregate demand; and economic growth and fluctuations.<br>
<br>Under the first head, Harrod was an originator of the marginal revenue curve, clarified the relation between short-period and long-period cost curves, and helped to develop the theory of pricing and output decisions of imperfectly competitive producers, that is, those that are in some degree &#145;price-making&#146;. His papers on these topics were reprinted in <span class="italic">Economic Essays</span> (2nd edn, 1972). As regards aggregate demand, Harrod's <span class="italic">International Economics</span> (1933; 4th edn, 1957) and <span class="italic">The Trade Cycle</span> (1936) pioneered the application of the 1931 &#145;multiplier&#146; concept of R. F. Kahn to an economy engaging in foreign trade. Harrod showed how an increase in exports would, in the presence of underutilized resources and inflexible prices, expand total output and employment up to the point at which imports had risen to match the new level of exports. Keynes's use of the multiplier mechanism in <span class="italic">The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money</span> (1936) followed Kahn in concentrating on the closed economy, where it was investment and saving, rather than exports and imports, that were brought into balance through changes in income. Furthermore, in <span class="italic">The Trade Cycle</span> fixed investment was largely influenced by changes in aggregate output, an innovative linkage that Harrod called &#145;the relation&#146; and that subsequently (following Samuelson and others) became known as the accelerator or, in a looser form, the capital-stock adjustment principle.<br>
<br>The relationships between investment and saving and between output change and investment were both of central importance in Harrod's path-breaking formulation of a one-sector growth model&#151;&#145;An essay in dynamic theory&#146; (<span class="italic">Economic Journal</span>, 1939), later incorporated in <span class="italic">Towards a Dynamic Economics</span> (1948; 2nd revised edn, 1973)&#151;in which he sought to analyse the macroeconomic properties of a long-run expansion path. In the so-called Harrod&#150;Domar model (the Russian-American economist Evsey Domar having produced in 1946 a model similar in important respects to Harrod's) the odds were overwhelmingly against the attainment of steady-state growth. This finding initiated a spate of theoretical literature on macroeconomic growth models from the 1950s onwards.<br>
<br>Harrod's own economic writings after the Second World War concentrated mainly on questions of policy, especially British economic management (<span class="italic">Are these Hardships Necessary?</span>, 1947; <span class="italic">Topical Comment: Essays in Dynamic Economics Applied</span>, 1961; <span class="italic">Towards a New Economic Policy</span>, 1967) and international monetary issues (<span class="italic">The Dollar</span>, 1953, and <span class="italic">Reforming the World's Money</span>, 1965). Following the Keynesian revolution and the post-war development of &#145;growth economics&#146;, Harrod became a persistent and somewhat extreme advocate of fiscal and monetary expansion, arguing that an economy must be run under strong demand pressure if it was to realize its full growth potential, and that inflation and balance-of-payments deficits should be curbed not through general restraints on demand but through direct intervention&#151;namely, incomes policy in the case of inflation, and export subsidies and import restrictions in the case of payment deficits. Internationally, Harrod favoured a rise in the official price of gold to enhance the volume of international reserves. His insistence on expansionary policies at all points owed something to his belief that, even in the post-Keynesian era, it was easier to maintain economic activity at a high level than it would be to restore it after another slump.<br>
<br>Besides his economic writings, Harrod made noteworthy contributions to biography and to philosophy. His official <span class="italic">Life of John Maynard Keynes</span> (1951), though criticized for undue obtrusion of its author's personality in selecting and presenting material, was a compelling and magisterial account of Keynes's career and achievements. <span class="italic">The Prof</span> (1959), his memoir of F. A. Lindemann, Viscount Cherwell, was a slighter work, more in the nature of an extended essay, recalling the author's own disappointingly short period of service in Winston Churchill's &#145;S branch&#146; in the early part of the Second World War as well as painting a sympathetic portrait of the aloof and controversial figure of Cherwell.<br>
<br>In philosophy, Harrod's most ambitious venture, and one to which among all his work he himself attached particular importance, was <span class="italic">Foundations of Inductive Logic</span> (1956). This attempted&#151;unsuccessfully, in the opinion of professional philosophers&#151;to refute Hume by providing a strictly logical justification for induction, that is, for assuming that &#145;because the sun has risen every day so far, it will do so again tomorrow&#146;. But his most influential philosophical work was a paper in <span class="italic">Mind</span> (1936) entitled &#145;Utilitarianism revised&#146;, which sought to defend the utilitarian approach against certain criticisms by elaborating the doctrine. Harrod argued, first, that morality is concerned with means rather than ends, that is, with the promotion of whatever ultimate goals are sought by the greatest number of people, and, second, that utilitarian principles call for adherence to universal rules of conduct (rather than case-by-case decisions) in matters (for example, promise-keeping) where repetition and predictability are themselves socially beneficial.<br>
<br>Harrod combined originality of mind with breadth of interest, and immense power of assimilation and concentration with a fluent and sometimes picturesque writing style. Although not averse to lecturing or orating (including political campaigning, to which he gave considerable energy through much of the inter-war period, besides standing unsuccessfully for parliament as a Liberal Party candidate at Huddersfield in the general election of 1945), he preferred to write (including memoranda and letters to his colleagues on college or university business, characteristically marked &#145;Immediate&#146; on the envelope). He was of lean physique and above-average height; even in later years, when he had a stoop, his manner retained an Olympian element. He was irresistibly discursive with pupils, to whom he conveyed a sense of contact with great minds and grand decisions, and unfailingly courteous to all.<br>
<br>Harrod was made FBA in 1947 and knighted in 1969. He received honorary degrees from the universities of Aberdeen, Glasgow, Warwick, Pennsylvania, Poitiers, and Stockholm. In 1962&#150;4 he was president of the Royal Economic Society. He was an honorary student of Christ Church (1967) and an honorary fellow of Nuffield College (1958) and New College (1975). He died at the family home, the Old Rectory, Holt, Norfolk, on 8 March 1978.<br>
<br>Harrod's wife, <a name="cosubject_95793"></a><span class="headword">Wilhelmine Margaret Eve <span class="st"> [Billa]</span> Harrod <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Cresswell]</span></span>, Lady Harrod  (1911&#150;2005), <span class="occ">architectural conservationist</span>, was born on 1 December 1911 at New Hunstanton, Snettisham, Norfolk, the daughter of Lieutenant (later Captain) Francis Joseph Cresswell (<i>d</i>. 1914) of the Norfolk regiment and his wife, Barbara, <i>n&eacute;e</i> ffolkes (1884&#150;1977). Her father was killed in action at Mons in the early stages of the First World War, aged thirty-one, and in 1918 her mother married, as her second husband, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/98119/', "General Sir (Edward) Peter Strickland (1869&#150;1951)")</script>; she was created DBE in 1923 following a gruelling tour of duty with her husband in Ireland. Billa Cresswell's early years were peripatetic because of her stepfather's postings, and she was educated privately and then, briefly, at the Sorbonne. She then became a wardrobe mistress at various London film studios. In the early 1930s she was briefly engaged to John Betjeman, the poet and Victorian conservationist; they remained lifelong friends. She met Roy Harrod at Sezincote in Gloucestershire, then owned by the Dugdale family. After their marriage she provided hospitality for generations of her husband's colleagues and students at their Oxford house, initially at 6 Beaumont Street, and after 1940 at 91 St Aldates, opposite the entrance to Christ Church meadow. (The latter home was subsequently incorporated, in the early 1980s, into a new quadrangle of Christ Church.) Nancy Mitford reputedly based the character of Fanny in <span class="italic">Love in a Cold Climate</span> on her. She was first drawn into the conservation movement by the campaign to save Beaumont Street from redevelopment. Her love of her home county had already borne fruit in her writing, with Charles Linnell, the <span class="roman">Shell Guide</span> to Norfolk (1957). Her two passions were brought together after her husband's retirement, and their permanent move to Holt, Norfolk, where they had acquired the Old Rectory in 1962. In 1970 she took a leading role in founding the Friends of Norwich Churches, and in 1976 she was the founding chairman of the Norfolk Churches Trust, which raised large sums for the preservation of Norfolk churches, and was in some cases able to restore parish church status to churches that had been made redundant. In 1972 she published <span class="italic">Norfolk County Churches and the Future</span>, with illustrations by Osbert Lancaster and John Piper, and an introduction by Sir John Betjeman. She was appointed OBE in 1992. She died on 9 May 2005 at her home, the Old Rectory, Holt. She was survived by her two sons.<br>
