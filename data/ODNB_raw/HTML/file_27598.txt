<span class="headword">Towne,  Francis</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1739, <em>d.</em> 1816), <span class="occ">landscape painter</span>, was baptized at All Saints, Isleworth, Middlesex, on 19 August 1739. His parents, William Towne, a corn chandler, and his wife, Lydia, had four other children, three certainly older than Francis. Towne must have shown early evidence of an inclination towards the arts, for on 5 August 1752 (probably his thirteenth birthday), he was apprenticed for seven years to the London coach-painter Thomas Brookshead. In 1759, just as his indenture was coming to an end, Towne won the first prize awarded by the Society of Arts for &#145;an original design&#146;, which Towne later recalled as &#145;the best drawing of landscape&#146;  (letter to O. Humphrey, 1803; Wilcox, 163).<br>
<br>Towne is then said to have studied under the court portraitist John Shackleton, but he also continued to earn his living in the trade of the coach-painter. In 1763 he was working for Thomas Watson in Long Acre, London, and it was probably not long after this that he went to Exeter, initially to work in the same line. The reasons for Towne's departure to Exeter, the city with which he remained associated for the rest of his life, are obscure. The city's low cost of living certainly suited his frugal habits; yet his friend James White commented in 1781, &#145;As to painting, you know this is no place for it&#146;  (Wilcox, 31), and Towne resented any suggestion that he was merely a provincial. He had begun to contribute to the exhibitions of the Society of Artists in 1762, followed in 1763 by a &#145;large landscape, with a scene from Shakespear's <span class="roman">Cymbeline</span>&#146; at the Free Society  (Bury, <span class="italic">Towne</span>, 115). Later in life, Towne appeared to claim he had been invited to become one of the founder members of the Royal Academy in 1767, but had declined. Following his first application for membership as an associate in 1775, he made ten more between 1788 and 1803. He was never admitted, a source of evident bitterness.<br>
<br>Towne's first Devon landscape was shown at the Free Society in 1767. He became the preferred artist of the county's great estates, painting views of their parks and often newly remodelled gardens. At Ugbrooke Park, Devon, he drew or painted a dozen views for Hugh, fourth Lord Clifford, between 1773 and 1780. Towne was also popular as a teacher of drawing to leisured amateurs. These were mainly young women, but in John White Abbott (1763&#150;1851), an Exeter apothecary, he found a committed and assiduous pupil whose reputation even outstripped his teacher's. Abbott's uncle, James White, a local lawyer and leading nonconformist, accompanied Towne on a tour of north Wales in 1777. The drawings, chiefly of waterfalls and castles, have a spare, tense quality which sets them apart from the conventions of the picturesque.<br>
<br>In 1780 Towne travelled to Rome. He joined the artist William Pars, an old friend, and also painted alongside the much younger John (Warwick) Smith. James Irvine, another British traveller who encountered him there, described him as<blockquote>one of the strangest genius's I have seen. With a very indifferent understanding he has all the gravity and formality of a profound philosopher and deep reasoner, but he is I believe what we call a good sort of man and applies his art with great industry. (letter to George Cumberland, 16 Dec 1780; Wilcox, 56&#150;7)</blockquote>In March 1781 Towne was being shown around the Bay of Naples by the painter Thomas Jones, but, unlike Jones and many other British artists who remained for several years in Italy, Towne was unhappy and after spending the late spring and early summer in and around Rome he decided to return home. He did, however, time the journey to have the best opportunity of visiting the Alps, inspired, no doubt, by the account by Pars of his tour of 1770. Towne travelled with Warwick Smith via the Italian lakes and the Spl&uuml;gen Pass to Lucerne, then on to Geneva. The climax of the tour was reached in the Vale of Chamonix with two watercolours of the source of the Arveyron (Tate collection and V&amp;A). Never before had the medium evoked such hugeness of scale and such a heart-stopping sense of awe.<br>
<br>Far from capitalizing on these experiences, Towne failed to exhibit any continental views until 1788. He had by then also made a tour of the Lake District in 1786, in the company of White and another Exeter nonconformist, John Merivale. The sketchbook pages fully worked up in watercolour (now scattered), and the larger sheets probably painted on the spot, are among his most vibrant creations. In their lengthy inscriptions, Towne left evidence of a modern preoccupation with the authenticity of the painted image. This emerges forcibly in the one-man exhibition of his watercolours he mounted at 20 Lower Brook Street, London, in February 1805, where some 200 of his original sketches were shown, individually mounted by the artist. This singular event, presented in the rooms which two months later were to house the first exhibition of the Society of Painters in Water Colours, attracted very little attention.<br>
<br>On 5 August 1807 Towne married Jeannette Hilligsberg, a French dancer aged only twenty-seven, who had been a dancing-mistress in Exeter since about 1801. The couple took up residence in London but only eight months later, in April 1808, she died. Towne then began a series of annual summer sketching tours which took him to Wales, Cornwall, and Devon in 1809, to Wales again in 1810, to Scotland in 1811, to Oxford in 1813, and finally to Devon in 1815. Towne died on 7 July 1816 at 31 Devonshire Street, his London home, following two years of failing health. He left provision in his will for his body to be conveyed with great pomp to Exeter, to be laid beside his wife in Heavitree church. This was accomplished on 22 July. He also instructed his executor to deposit his Italian drawings in the British Museum (where they remain), to be housed with the works of Pars, a further sign of his self-awareness as an artist and sure expectation that posterity would accord him the recognition denied to him in life.<br>
