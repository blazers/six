<span class="headword">Read,  John</span>  (1884&#150;1963), <span class="occ">organic chemist</span>, was born in Maiden Newton, Dorset, on 17 February 1884, in his father's seventieth year, the younger of two children of John Read, yeoman farmer, and his wife, Bessie Gatcombe. Apart from his sister, Read also had five older half-brothers and six older half-sisters. Both his parents were descended from a long line of farmers, and he was the first member of the family not to become a farmer.<br>
<br>Read was identified early as a clever boy at the village school at Sparkford, and proceeded after only three years to Sexey's School, Bruton, at the top of the county junior scholarship list; he left there in 1901 as head boy with a senior Somerset county scholarship of &pound;60 per annum. He then spent four years at Finsbury Technical College, London, where he attended courses in both science and engineering before obtaining the college's diploma and chemistry prize in 1904, and becoming for a short time a college demonstrator in the department of chemistry. He was then awarded a London county council senior scholarship which enabled him to leave London, which he disliked, for the University of Z&uuml;rich, to study for a doctorate under Professor Alfred Werner, then in the prime of his scientific life.<br>
<br>It is clear from his writings that Read enjoyed Z&uuml;rich University. Not only did he find the scientific scene stimulating and rewarding, but he was able to develop his interest and proficiency in foreign languages, an interest which he maintained throughout his life. Although not directly involved in Werner's renowned research on the stereochemistry of inorganic complexes&#151;that is, a study of the consequences of the three-dimensional structure of molecules containing metallic ions&#151;he was greatly influenced by the stereochemical concepts being widely discussed. Consequently, after a successful defence of his PhD thesis in 1907, two years after his arrival in Z&uuml;rich, Read decided to spend the remaining year of his scholarship at the Municipal School of Technology in Manchester, working with W. J. Pope, who had earned an international reputation for his studies of the stereochemistry of organic compounds (those based on carbon). Read's decision was important in determining his career, because in 1908 Pope was appointed to the chair of chemistry at Cambridge, and took Read with him as his assistant. Read became a member of Emmanuel College with the status of advanced student. In 1912 he was granted an MA.<br>
<br>For the next eight years Read was committed to his chemistry and made significant discoveries in the field of organic stereochemistry. His dedication is illustrated by the story of his synthesis of methyl ethyl selenide, which not only has one of the most offensive smells known, but can be detected at remarkably low concentrations. In view of this Read felt it wise to synthesize the substance in the open air on the roof of his laboratory; unfortunately his efforts coincided with a number of garden parties held to celebrate the Darwin centenary, and the subsequent furore forced Read into the fens to complete his work. There he noted that both insects and cows were attracted by the smell: &#145;Their whole behaviour indicated that they felt they were missing something really good&#146;.<br>
<br>A major change occurred in 1916 when Read, at the age of thirty-two, was appointed to the chair of organic chemistry in Sydney, Australia. After a long and anxious voyage he arrived to find that he was required to give his first lecture that very day. The problems facing him were now very different. Large classes, the design and supervision of the construction of a new chemistry building, and the administration of the department all combined to reduce the time available for research. Nevertheless, Read initiated and pursued what came to be recognized as a significant investigation of the structure (and stereochemistry) of a series of organic materials which he isolated from Australian flora. These studies were all the more commendable because Read had very little research assistance.<br>
<br>While in Australia, in 1916 Read married Ida, daughter of Arthur Suddards, of Bradford, Yorkshire; they had two sons. Read was very happy in Sydney and his decision in 1923 to accept an invitation to succeed Robert Robinson in the Purdie chair of chemistry at St Andrews was not an easy one. The department there, first under Thomas Purdie, with his foresight in recognizing the importance of research in the context of university chemistry, and then under his outstanding pupil J. C. Irvine, had a reputation which had been enhanced by Robinson, despite his short stay (1921&#150;2). Read soon settled down in the St Andrews atmosphere of scholarship and went on to produce a steady stream of original papers as well as a very successful series of textbooks; his <span class="italic">A Direct Entry to Organic Chemistry</span> (1948) ran to many editions and Read received, in 1949, the Premio Europeo-Cortina, a prize of 1 million lire for the best popular work in the field of physical science published in Europe in the preceding five years.<br>
<br>Read had always been interested in history; he said that, given a choice and free from the pressures of a science-orientated school, he would have specialized in history or languages, rather than science. Once at St Andrews he devoted more time to these interests, building up and writing about an extraordinarily important collection of manuscripts, books, and engravings relating to the history of science, and to alchemy. One notable outcome was his <span class="italic">Humour and Humanism in Chemistry</span> (1947). His interest in the dialects of Somerset and Dorset also found expression in a series of plays and <span class="italic">The Farmer's Joy</span> (1949). His wide distinction is summarized by the citation of Read as &#145;one of the most versatile of Scientists as well known for his literary accomplishments as for his researches in organic chemistry&#146;, on his receiving the Dexter award for services to the history of chemistry, from the American Chemical Society (1959).<br>
<br>Read remained in St Andrews for almost forty years. He was widely acclaimed during his lifetime and was elected FRS in 1935, having gained his ScD at Cambridge in 1934. He was most proud, however, of the esteem in which he was held by his pupils. He was an excellent teacher and kindly man, who appeared untouched by the hurly-burly of modern chemical life.<br>
<br>Read died at his home, 1 Donaldson Gardens, St Andrews, on 21 January 1963, just one month short of his seventy-ninth birthday. He was survived by his wife.<br>
