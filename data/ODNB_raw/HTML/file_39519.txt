<span class="headword">Matthew,  Patrick</span>  (1790&#150;1874), <span class="occ">arboriculturist and social reformer</span>, was born at a farm named Rome on the River Tay near Scone, Perthshire, on 20 October 1790, the son of John Matthew (<i>d</i>. 1808), a gentleman farmer, and his wife, Agnes Duncan, a relative of Adam, Viscount Duncan of Camperdown. He was educated at Perth Academy and then matriculated in 1804&#150;5 at Edinburgh University, where he attended classes relevant to the study of medicine. He never completed a degree at Edinburgh after his studies were interrupted by the death of his father. He assumed his lifelong role in managing Gourdiehill, near Errol, an estate that had been in the possession of the Duncan family for about three centuries. Matthew planted an extensive orchard&#151;numbering in excess of 10,000 trees during his lifetime&#151;and thereby contributed to making the Carse of Gowrie &#145;one of the richest fruit-growing districts in Scotland&#146;  (Wylie, 51). In Perth, on 25 July 1817, he married his first cousin, Christian (<i>d</i>. 1857), daughter of Robert Nicoll of Drumhead; they had eight children.<br>
<br>Matthew's wealth and position gave him the opportunity to travel: in 1815, for instance, he cut short a visit to France after hearing news of Napoleon's return from Elba. Intellectually he was influenced by late Enlightenment Edinburgh and was familiar with the ideas of continental Europe. He combined materialist science with a radical political agenda to produce an amalgam of free-trade political economy, social (imperialist) evolutionism, catastrophist geology, and biological transformism (that is to say early evolutionism). In the 1830s he became involved with the Chartists and was chosen by the Perth Radical Association to be one of the eight Scottish delegates to the General Convention of the Industrious Classes in London in 1839. He waived his claim to &pound;200 for travel and subsistence expenses on the condition that the money would be used to employ an itinerant lecturer in political economy: a Mr Sime was duly hired and toured the east coast of Scotland. After returning from the London convention to consult his Perthshire and Fife constituents, Matthew tendered his resignation to William Lovett on 12 April 1839. He openly opposed Chartist threats of force and thereby incurred the wrath of Feargus O'Connor who denounced him as a &#145;middle-class traitor&#146;  (Wilson, 75).<br>
<br>Matthew remained undeterred in promoting his own programme of radical social and educational reform. He published <span class="italic">Emigration Fields</span> in 1839, in which he used Scottish poor law debates as a springboard for his call for government-supported transportation of impoverished working-class people to temperate British colonies. Although a Perthshire farmer later remembered Matthew as a man who believed in neither God nor the devil, he was clearly influenced by the Scottish evangelical emphasis on individual responsibility. He denounced England's old and new poor laws and indiscriminate charity in favour of voluntary colonization of Britain's poor, funded by a tax imposed on rent received for land. Convinced that the British were &#145;evidently a superior race&#146;  (<span class="italic">Emigration Fields</span>, 3), he predicted that the reign of Queen Victoria would usher in the defeat of &#145;barbarism and human misery&#146;  (ibid., 11) through colonization. Climate, temperature, and circumstances were, however, fundamentally important to his &#145;economy of colonization&#146;: whereas the Caucasian British race would wither in Australia's arid climate, they would thrive in the mild and moist air of New Zealand. Matthew contended that the climate and native population of New Zealand rendered it the most eligible British colony for philanthropic colonization. Consequently his fourth and fifth sons, Charles and James, emigrated to New Zealand where, armed with seeds from Gourdiehill, they established commercial apple and pear orchards at Matakana, near Auckland. Matthew argued that colonies provided sources of raw materials and opened markets for finished goods; they were part of the grand plan of free trade, or &#145;the good which a benevolent Providence has designed for man&#146;  (ibid., 4).<br>
<br>Similar ideological commitments had inspired Matthew to publish <span class="italic">On Naval Timber and Arboriculture</span> (1831). After all, he argued, navigation was of paramount importance for the spread of the British race, and attendant arts and sciences, throughout the world. And navigation relied upon effective management of woods, especially at a time of increasing local shortages. Although this book was reviewed favourably by the likes of J. C. Loudon (<span class="italic">Gardeners' Magazine</span>, Dec 1832) and is still celebrated as a significant contribution to forestry, its possible anticipation of Charles Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection has been its most lasting historical legacy. In the wake of T. H. Huxley's review in <span class="italic">The Times</span> of <span class="italic">On the Origin of Species</span> (1859) Matthew informed readers of the <span class="italic">Gardeners' Chronicle</span> (7 April 1860) that he had discovered the &#145;natural law of selection&#146; several decades earlier; and he offered a series of extracts from <span class="italic">On Naval Timber and Arboriculture</span> as evidence. Darwin conceded that Matthew had anticipated his explanation of the origin of species by natural selection. He contended that his ignorance of Matthew's priority was understandable because he and fellow naturalists were unaware of the brief comments that appeared in an appendix to a book on naval timber and arboriculture  (<span class="italic">Gardeners' Chronicle</span>, 21 April 1860). In the third (1861) and subsequent editions of <span class="italic">Origin of Species</span>, however, Darwin included Matthew in his &#145;Historical sketch&#146; of antecedent literature on transmutation. In a later letter to the <span class="italic">Gardeners' Chronicle</span> (12 May 1860) Matthew contrasted the genesis of his ideas with Darwin's methodology. Whereas Darwin devoted twenty years to careful reading and experimentation, he simply expelled ideas that he intuited as self-evident truths. This admission, which was perhaps a facetious act of conceit, pointed to significant differences. Unlike Darwin, Matthew was not intent on fundamentally reshaping life sciences. He cited virtually no relevant literature in support of his arguments, and explicitly spurned learned naturalists. His transformism was part of his commitment to social and political reform, anchored in free-trade imperialism.<br>
<br>Matthew should be understood in the political, social, economic, and cultural context of the &#145;age of revolutions&#146; of the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, rather than as a precursor of Darwin's <span class="italic">Origin</span> (1859). More particularly, Matthew's <span class="italic">Naval Timber and Arboriculture</span> was significantly shaped by France's July revolution of 1830. The preface indicated that he had addressed &#145;the question regarding species, variety and habit&#146; to &#145;correct the aridity&#146; of the book  (p. vi). But his closing remarks in the appendices make clear his plan. Ostensibly he began his book with the intention of writing an instructive manual on forestry, a work of rural economy. Events in France, however, convinced him that his treatise on &#145;the regeneration of trees&#146; could profitably inform &#145;the regeneration of man&#146;  (p. 390), as it was so clearly occurring across the channel. Within the appendices Matthew referred to imminent changes of circumstance for man that will arise &#145;in the new state of things&#146;  (pp. 366, 368). These prognostications reiterated his earlier observation that &#145;we are &hellip; on the eve of great improvements in arboriculture&#146;  (p. 76n). These great improvements, he argues, follow from the realization that &#145;<i>species</i> may be broken down by art or culture, and that when once the breach is made, there is almost no limit to disorder; the <i>mele</i> [<i>sic</i>] that ensues being nearly incapable of reduction&#146;  (ibid.). The July revolution replaced a strident and increasingly absolutist monarchy with a constitutional one that was underpinned by merchant and industrial capitalists. Matthew argued that laws &#145;manifest in nature&#146; proved that constitutional monarchy was the best form of governance, and that the abolition of the stifling and unnatural law of entail and primogeniture was a necessary step towards the natural and superior leadership of the merchants and capitalists.<br>
<br>To stake his claim to priority over Darwin in the <span class="italic">Gardeners' Chronicle</span> thirty years later, Matthew quoted selectively from at least half a dozen different passages in his 391 page monograph. The immediate contexts of these passages must be appreciated to understand the meaning and intent of the book that Matthew had published in 1831. First and foremost, he wished to proffer &#145;laws of nature&#146; to support his liberal political agenda. He drew on the transformist biology of the likes of Jean-Baptiste de Lamarck and Erasmus Darwin to argue that biological species were not fixed and unchanging. And in a manner similar to T. R. Malthus he constructed an argument grounded in biological and social analogies. When combined, these two strands of thought permitted him to argue that natural and social hierarchies were susceptible to change, according to laws of nature. Thus, &#145;nobility to be in the highest perfection like the finer varieties of fruit&#146; must mix with &#145;wilder stocks&#146; or it is doomed to an effete future  (<span class="italic">Naval Timber</span>, 366). Similarly, a<blockquote>change of seed, that is, a change of place, within certain limits of latitude, is well known to be indispensable to the more sturdy growth and health of many cultivated vegetables; it is probable that this also holds true of the human race. (ibid., 370&#150;71)</blockquote>Consequently the considerable detail afforded to sowing, planting, and thinning woods in <span class="italic">Naval Timber</span> was subsumed in a wider argument about selection of soil and climate for Britain's surplus population: the human species could be improved through emigration. This, he maintained, was in preference to the English &#145;poor-rate law, contravening natural law&#146;  (ibid., 374). His natural law of selection sought to explain the sustenance of &#145;the lion in his strength, the hare in her swiftness, and the fox in his wiles&#146;  (ibid., 364&#150;5), because Matthew desired a natural justification for Britain's &#145;Universal Empire&#146;  (ibid., 363). His political and religious commitments may also have shaped his geological speculations. Unlike Darwin, who espoused a belief in very slow and gradual change that could only be explained with reference to observable present-day forces, Matthew relied upon a variant of Georges Cuvier's catastrophism: aeons of stability were punctuated by catastrophes of a scale and force hitherto unknown. Out of these revolutionary catastrophes arose a new natural order.<br>
<br>Historians have been less inclined to accept Darwin's curious concession that Matthew's explanation of the origin of species was &#145;precisely the same&#146; as his and Alfred Russel Wallace's. There were, in fact, fundamental differences in their conceptions of the pace of geological and organic transformations, and in their relative acceptance of random changes among populations of fauna and flora. In the face of general resistance to his mechanism of evolutionary change Darwin perhaps embraced Matthew's concise summary of a &#145;natural law of selection&#146;, which was clearly grounded in years of arboricultural experience of hybridization. This may explain why, after Darwin's concession, Matthew indignantly noted the injustice of denying the &#145;parent&#146; of Darwin's theory of natural selection his due regard when the British Association for the Advancement of Science rejected his proposed paper on the subject for their Dundee meeting in 1867.<br>
<br>Matthew's prescience, arguably, would be better seen as an early form of environmentalism rather than as a precursor of Darwin. Man, he asserted,<blockquote>has now acquired a dominion over the material world, and a consequent power of increase, so as to render it probable that the whole surface of the earth may soon be overrun by this engrossing anomaly, to the annihilation of every wonderful and beautiful variety of animated existence, which does not administer to his wants principally as laboratories of preparation to befit cruder elemental matter for assimilation of his organs. (Matthew, <span class="italic">Naval Timber</span>, 387&#150;8)</blockquote>Matthew wed Lamarck to Malthus and warned of the potential environmental destruction attendant upon human alterations to the natural world.<br>
<br>Matthew styled himself the &#145;solver of the problem of species&#146; on the title page of his pamphlet <span class="italic">Schleswig-Holstein</span> (1864), which supported the recent Austrian and Prussian occupation of Schleswig and Holstein, on the ground that the territory was the seedbed of the Anglen race. He had travelled extensively in German lands, and had purchased farms in Schleswig-Holstein that were amalgamated into one estate, Schenefeld, between 1845 and 1850. His third son, Alexander, assumed management of Schenefeld, married a German woman, and settled in Germany for the remainder of his life.<br>
<br>In 1869 Matthew repeated a description of himself as &#145;a venerable, crotchety old man, with a head stuffed with old-world notions, quite unsuited to the present age of progress&#146; (<span class="italic">Dundee Advertiser</span>, 13 Dec 1869, repr. in Dempster, 335). It was one of five letters that he submitted about the Tay Bridge, and helped to reinforce his historical reputation for prescience. Matthew, a director of the Edinburgh and Northern Railway, criticized the siting and engineering of the bridge, and predicted its collapse, with train atop and loss of life. Ten years later, in December 1879, his predictions proved tragically correct, and he became known as the Seer of Gourdiehill. Matthew, however, did not live to witness the Tay Bridge disaster, having died from heart disease at Gourdiehill on 8 June 1874. He was buried at Errol churchyard.<br>
