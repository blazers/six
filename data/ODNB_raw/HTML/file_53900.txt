<span class="headword">Healey,  Donald Mitchell</span>  (1898&#150;1988), <span class="occ">car designer and rally driver</span>, was born on 3 July 1898 in Woodbine Cottage, Perranporth, on the north coast of Cornwall, the elder of the two sons of John Frederick Healey, who ran the village shop, and his wife, Emmie, daughter of Sampson Mitchell, shopkeeper, of Perranporth. His parents were Wesleyan Methodists. After studying engineering at Newquay College, he took up an apprenticeship in 1914 with the Sopwith Aviation Company in Kingston upon Thames, Surrey, while continuing his engineering studies at Kingston Technical College. In 1916 he enlisted in the Royal Flying Corps as an air mechanic, and after qualifying as a pilot he went on night bombing raids, but after a series of crashes he was invalided out of the Royal Flying Corps in November 1917 and was transferred to the aeronautical inspection department of the Air Ministry, and spent the rest of the war checking aircraft components. He returned to Perranporth in 1919, and on 21 October 1921 married Ivy Maud (<i>d</i>. 1980), daughter of Faithful James, a hard rock miner, of Perranporth: they had three sons.<br>
<br>With financial help from his father, Healey opened a garage and car hire business in Perranporth in 1920, but he became more interested in rally driving and motor racing, using the garage to prepare cars for his races. He first entered the Monte Carlo rally in 1929, in a Triumph 7, and after he won at Monte Carlo in 1931 in an Invicta he was in demand as a competition driver. In 1933 he sold the garage business, and moved to the midlands to work for Riley, but later that year joined the Triumph Motor Company as experimental manager. Promoted to the post of technical director in 1934, he was responsible for the design of all Triumph cars, and created the Triumph Dolomite 8 sports car in 1935. At the same time he had many competition successes driving Triumphs, winning the light class at the 1934 Monte Carlo rally in a Triumph Gloria, which he had designed. When the company went into liquidation in 1939, Healey stayed on at the factory as works manager, producing carburettors for aircraft engines for the Ministry of Supply. He later moved to the Humber Car Company, to work on armoured cars.<br>
<br>In 1945 Healey founded the Donald Healey Motor Company Ltd, based in a factory near Warwick, and in 1946 his first car, the Healey Elliot, a saloon car with a Riley engine, went into production. This car scored wins in the 1947 and 1948 alpine rallies, and won the touring class in the Mille Miglia in 1948, the first win by a British car in the history of the race. The Healey Silverstone, a high-performance sports car, appeared in 1949, and its success in the United States led to a contract with Nash Motors, an American company, for Healey to build a car with Nash components. Healey opened a new factory, the Cape Works, to assemble the Nash-Healey, and in 1950 he entered the Le Mans 24 hour race for the first time, driving a Nash-Healey, and he drove Nash-Healeys in the Mille Miglia from 1950 to 1952. But his ambition was to design an inexpensive sports car, capable of speeds over 100 m.p.h., and he launched the Healey 100, with an Austin engine and gearbox, at the 1952 motor show at Earls Court. As the Warwick factory could not cope with the expected large export orders, he entered into a royalty agreement with the British Motor Corporation&#151;formed by the merger of the Austin Motor Company and Morris Motors in 1952&#151;by which the British Motor Corporation would build the car while Healey would retain control over the design, and the Austin-Healey 100 went into production at the British Motor Corporation's Longbridge factory in 1953. An immediate success, with its aerodynamic shape and excellent performance, the Austin-Healey 100 won many prizes, including the grand prize at the international motor sports show in New York in 1953. By the middle of 1953 they were producing 120 cars a week, all for export, and by the time production ceased in 1967, 74,000 Austin-Healey 100s had been built, 80 per cent of them for export, proving very popular with American servicemen stationed in Britain. In the 100-S, which he developed purely for racing, Healey achieved his greatest ambition when he recorded 203 m.p.h. at Bonneville Salt Flats, Utah, in August 1956.<br>
<br>In 1955 Healey formed Healey Automotive Consultants, and worked on new designs for the British Motor Corporation, including the Austin-Healey Sprite, a small sports car based on the Austin A35 saloon, which was an instant success when it went into production in 1958. In the 1958 alpine trial, Sprites took the first three places in their class. Another venture was Healey Marine Ltd, set up in 1958 to build the Healey sports boat, advertised as being &#145;as thrilling on the water as the famous Healey sports car is on land&#146;. When he bought a house at Trebah, in Cornwall, in 1963, he converted the outbuildings into workshops where he worked on his designs. He sold the Cape Works in 1963, and opened a car showroom in a disused cinema in Warwick selling all makes of sports car, but this was not a success. When the Leyland Motor Corporation took over the British Motor Corporation in 1967, the new chairman, Sir Donald (later Lord) Stokes, cancelled the agreement with Healey, and stopped the production of Austin-Healey cars at the end of 1967. Healey launched a new sports car, the Jensen-Healey, in 1972, using Vauxhall components, and was chairman of Jensen for a brief period in 1973, but this car fell short of American emission standards. In 1974 he sold his company to the Hamblin Group, keeping Healey Automotive Consultants and the right to the Healey name, but he resisted all offers from companies such as Saab and Ford to produce a new Healey sports car.<br>
<br>Healey loved the competitive side of the motor industry, and was at his happiest driving in a race or a rally: his favourite race was the Mille Miglia, in which he competed eight times between 1948 and 1957. Although he was not interested in serving on committees, and took no part in the activities of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, he loved to travel, and visited the United States several times a year, promoting the sales of Austin-Healey cars. He was made CBE in 1973 for his services to the British motor industry.<br>
<br>Healey died on 15 January 1988 in the Duchy Hospital, Truro, Cornwall, and his funeral was held in the Perranporth Methodist Chapel. The Austin-Healey Club of America raised the money for a memorial window in St Michael's Church, Perranporth.<br>
