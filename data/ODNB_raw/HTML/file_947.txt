<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Ayrton,  Acton Smee</span>  (1816&#150;1886), <span class="occ">politician</span>, born at Kew, London, was a son of Frederick Ayrton (student at Gray's Inn from 27 January 1802, barrister from <i>c</i>.1805, and afterwards in practice at Bombay) and Julia, only daughter of Lieutenant-Colonel Nugent. Acton Ayrton was educated at Ealing School. He went to India and practised as a solicitor at Bombay, returning about 1851 with a moderate fortune. On 30 April 1853 he was called to the bar at the Middle Temple, with the intention of devoting himself to a political career.<br>
<br>Ayrton was Liberal MP for Tower Hamlets, 1857&#150;74, and was always a staunch reformer, supporting the ballot and franchise reform, though being cautious about the extreme effects of free trade. His long speech, on 24 April 1860, in support of the abortive bill for reforming the corporation of the City of London  (<span class="italic">Hansard 3</span>, 1860, 69&#150;85) attracted attention. Towards the end of his life he resumed his interest in that movement. He sat on the royal commissions on railway companies' charges, on the law courts, and on sanitary laws. In 1866, when addressing a meeting of working men in his constituency, he commented severely on the queen's retirement from public life owing to the death of the prince consort, and was rebuked by John Bright, who was present at the meeting. In the administration formed by Gladstone at the end of 1868 Ayrton was nevertheless appointed parliamentary secretary to the Treasury, and held the post until 11 November 1869. From that date, when he was sworn of the privy council, to August 1873 he was first commissioner of works.<br>
<br>Ayrton's administration as commissioner of works was not popular; it was marked by zeal for economy in the public interest, as he saw it (described as &#145;scandalous parsimony&#146; by his fellow radical, A. J. Mundella). He possessed great ability and varied knowledge, with notable independence of character, partly deriving from his membership of the commissions; but his manners were brusque, and he came into personal conflict with numerous prominent people with whom his official duties brought him into contact. He cut down the expenditure on the new Courts of Justice, and treated Alfred Stevens, the sculptor of the Wellington monument at St Paul's Cathedral, as a negligent contractor, and, but for the interposition of Robert Lowe, would have forced him to surrender his models  (Martin, 2.379&#150;80). He curtly dismissed Edward Middleton Barry as architect to the Palace of Westminster, and also had protracted differences with Sir J. D. Hooker, the director of Kew Gardens. Sir Algernon West, &#145;in some very complicated negotiations, made peace between them&#146;, and thought Ayrton the &#145;more reasonable man of the two&#146;  (West, 1.14). With two other members of the ministry (Gladstone and Lowe) Ayrton was caricatured at the Court Theatre in London in March 1873 in the burlesque <span class="italic">The Happy Land</span>, which was written by W. S. Gilbert and Gilbert &agrave; Beckett; the lord chancellor eventually required a softening of the satire.<br>
<br>In August 1873 Gladstone deemed it prudent to transfer Ayrton from the office of commissioner of works to that of judge-advocate-general. Ayrton resigned with the government in March 1874, and his political career came to a somewhat inglorious end. At the general election of 1874 he contested Tower Hamlets again, but was badly beaten, and after the redistribution of seats in 1885, in a contest for the Mile End division of Tower Hamlets, gained only 420 votes.<br>
<br>For the last few years of his life Ayrton was a daily frequenter of the Reform Club. He died, apparently unmarried, at the Mount Dore Hotel, Bournemouth, on 30 November 1886.<br>
