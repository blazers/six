<span class="headword">Carr,  Joseph William Comyns</span>  (1849&#150;1916), <span class="occ">author, gallery director, and theatre manager</span>, was born on 2 March 1849 at 47 Devonshire Street, Marylebone, Middlesex, the seventh of the ten children of Jonathan Carr, a woollen draper, and his wife, Catherine Grace Comyns. His father was from Cumberland, and his mother was Irish. His sister, Kate Comyns Carr, was a portrait artist. From 1862 to 1865 he attended Bruce Castle School, Tottenham, Middlesex, in the dining room of which, he later recalled, he had his first encounter with the wallpaper designs of William Morris. He matriculated at London University in 1870 and was called to the bar at the Inner Temple, London, on 30 April 1872. His ambition, however, was for a literary career. He established his name as a journalist, especially in the fields of dramatic and art criticism, and his appointment as art critic to the <span class="italic">Pall Mall Gazette</span> in 1873 allowed him to retire from the law. On 15 December 1873 he married, in Dresden, Alice Laura Vansittart Strettell (1850&#150;1927), daughter of the Revd Arthur B. Strettell, consular chaplain at Genoa. They had three children: Philip, Dorothy, and Arthur (later <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/61800/', "Sir Arthur Strettell Comyns Carr (1882&#150;1965)")</script>, barrister and Liberal MP).<br>
<br>Carr was a passionate advocate of Pre-Raphaelite art and a vigorous critic of what he saw as the short-sightedness of the art establishment. A series of articles on contemporary artists in <span class="italic">The Globe</span> in 1873 attracted attention and resulted in a friendship with Dante Gabriel Rossetti. In 1875 he became English editor of the sumptuous and influential French journal <span class="italic">L'Art</span>; he founded and edited <span class="italic">Art and Letters</span> in 1881&#150;3; and he was editor of the <span class="italic">English Illustrated Magazine</span> in 1883&#150;6, where he launched the career of the illustrator Hugh Thomson. He published several books based on his journalism, including <span class="italic">Drawings of the Old Masters</span> (1877), <span class="italic">Examples of Contemporary Art</span> (1878), <span class="italic">Art in Provincial France</span> (1883), and <span class="italic">Papers on Art</span> (1885).<br>
<br>In 1877 Sir Coutts Lindsay invited Carr and the amateur artist Charles Hall&eacute; to become co-directors of the newly founded Grosvenor Gallery in Bond Street with the express intention of promoting Pre-Raphaelite painters and challenging &#145;the sleepy self-complacency of the dwellers in Burlington House [the Royal Academy]&#146;  (Carr, <span class="italic">Some Eminent Victorians</span>, 131). The successful opening exhibition, to which many important artists contributed, marked a turning point in the appreciation of the work of Sir Edward Burne-Jones. Carr also organized several innovative exhibitions of old master paintings and drawings. Private views at the Grosvenor Gallery quickly became fixtures in the London social calendar.<br>
<br>At the end of 1886 Carr and Hall&eacute; resigned from the Grosvenor Gallery after a dispute with Sir Coutts Lindsay, and in the remarkable space of barely four months they planned, built, and opened the New Gallery in Regent Street in time to compete with the spring exhibitions of the Royal Academy and the Grosvenor (which closed in 1890). Crucially, they took with them all the Grosvenor's major contributors, and the New Gallery was to remain the most important showcase for Pre-Raphaelite art until the death of Burne-Jones in 1898. Carr continued as co-director until 1908. He was chosen to write the introduction to the British section of the International Exhibition of Fine Arts at Rome in 1911 and was afterwards appointed English representative on the Art Congress.<br>
<br>His gallery work did not cause Carr to neglect his interest in drama. In the early 1880s he contributed several light comedies to the &#145;Entertainment&#146; of Thomas German Reed and his wife, Priscilla, at St George's Hall. He also discovered a talent for adaptation: Hugh Conway's <span class="italic">Called back</span> in 1884 (in collaboration with the author) for the actor&#150;manager Herbert Beerbohm Tree was a huge popular success. Many other adaptations and collaborations followed, including <span class="italic">Madame Sans-G&ecirc;ne</span> by Victorien Sardou and Emile Moreau in 1897 for Sir Henry Irving; <span class="italic">The Beauty Stone</span> in 1898, a comic opera (in collaboration with Arthur Wing Pinero and with music by Sir Arthur Sullivan); and Goethe's <span class="italic">Faust</span> in 1908 (in collaboration with Stephen Phillips) for Tree. Of his original non-collaborative work for the theatre <span class="italic">King Arthur</span> (1895) for Irving is noteworthy for its production; Carr persuaded his old friend Burne-Jones to design the sets and costumes (the artist's only essay in this field) and enlisted Sullivan to compose the incidental music. The result was a <i>succ&egrave;s de spectacle</i> which ran for 100 performances and went on to tour the United States and Canada. Carr wrote two further pseudo-medieval dramas: <span class="italic">Tristram and Iseult</span> (1906) and <span class="italic">The Lonely Queen</span> (unpublished).<br>
<br>Carr was Tree's literary adviser and partner at the Haymarket Theatre (1887&#150;93); leased his own theatre, the Comedy (1893&#150;6); and managed the Lyceum (1899&#150;1904) after Irving transferred its control to a company. He was artistic adviser at the Covent Garden Theatre (1913&#150;14), where he staged the first English performance of Richard Wagner's <span class="italic">Parsifal</span> on 2 February 1914.<br>
<br>Carr's two volumes of memoirs, <span class="italic">Some Eminent Victorians</span> (1908) and <span class="italic">Coasting Bohemia</span> (1914), provide a fascinating record of his artistic and literary friendships. His last work, <span class="italic">The Ideals of Painting</span> (1917), was published posthumously. He died of cancer on 12 December 1916 at his home, 6 Canning Place, South Kensington, London, and was buried in Highgate cemetery.<br>
<br>Carr was, in his own words, &#145;an impenitent Victorian&#146;. He was a man of many talents, of boundless energy, and of unflagging confidence. He had a flair for organization and promotion; he was a great conversationalist, a renowned after-dinner speaker, and an expert fly-fisherman; he was once even offered a seat in parliament in the home-rule interest by Charles Stewart Parnell.<br>
