<span class="headword">Koebel,  William Henry</span>  (1872&#150;1923), <span class="occ">businessman and author</span>, was born at 4 The Drive, Honor Oak Park, Forest Hill, Kent, on 11 January 1872, the eldest son in the family of five sons and two daughters of Oscar Koebel (1835/6&#150;1921) and his wife, Emma Elizabeth (<i>b</i>. 1836/7), daughter of William Mills, an officer in the Royal Navy. Both parents were born in London. The Koebel family lived at The Mount, Duppas Hill, Coulsdon, and was comfortably off. Oscar Koebel was in partnership in the City of London with A. F. Koebel; they acted as East India merchants specializing in the indigo trade until the partnership was dissolved in 1893.<br>
<br>William Koebel was educated privately and in France, Germany, and Switzerland. Early in his adult life he was listed as a wine merchant, and his occupation was given as &#145;merchant&#146; when he married, on 19 March 1898, Eleanor Mabel, who was born in Sydney, New South Wales, and was the daughter of Anthony Garstin of New Zealand. They had one daughter, Marjorie, who seems to have taken her mother's maiden name after the Second World War.<br>
<br>Koebel was a prolific author and traveller, especially in South America, during the years before and after the First World War. His particular interest was trade and the British share in Latin America. Articles that had appeared in the <span class="italic">Manchester Guardian</span> and <span class="italic">The Globe</span> were the basis of his book <span class="italic">Modern Argentina: the El Dorado of Today</span> (1907) which contended that while South America offered considerable business opportunities, Britain's former trade supremacy was being challenged by other nations, which he attributed to the conservatism of British business practice and especially to its failure to respond to the needs of local markets. These were continuing themes of many of his writings. He undertook special commissions for <span class="italic">The Times</span> and such other journals as <span class="italic">The Standard</span> and <span class="italic">The Sphere</span> and was editor-in-chief of the <span class="italic">Encyclopaedia of South America</span> (1913).<br>
<br>Koebel's <span class="italic">British Exploits in South America</span> (1917), which celebrated the Britons who had played a noteworthy part in the making of the Spanish- and Portuguese-speaking countries of South America, was criticized in the <span class="italic">American Historical Review</span> (1917) for its scholarly deficiencies and partiality, but the book's tone was consistent with the propaganda mission he undertook in the region in 1917 and 1918, for which he received the thanks of the war council in 1921. His four brothers were commissioned officers in the British armed forces during the war (one of them dying at Gallipoli) and he refuted journalistic innuendo about possible German sympathies, suggested by his surname, explaining that only a weakness of the heart prevented him from enlisting  (Koebel, <span class="italic">British Exploits</span>, viii&#150;ix).<br>
<br>In the years immediately after the First World War Koebel renewed his urgings that British businesses should address the potential of the South American market, now penetrated by both the United States and Japan. <span class="italic">South America: an Industrial and Commercial Field</span> (1918; 2nd edn, 1923) encouraged British exporters to emphasize the prestige built up by British settlement in the region over the previous century, while <span class="italic">The Great South Land</span> (1919) described the British communities on the River Plate and in southern Brazil, and emphasized the personal ties between Britain and South America, while insisting on the need for more advertisement of British products. One of his recurrent complaints was that the heads of British firms rarely visited South America, and he founded and compiled the <span class="italic">Anglo-South American Handbook</span>, first published in 1921 by the Federation of British Industries as a comprehensive guide to the countries of South America, as well as Mexico and Cuba, and providing commercial data intended specifically for the business traveller. This became <span class="italic">The South American Handbook</span>, which remains his principal legacy.<br>
<br>Koebel's writings did not meet with universal approval and his view of British commercial weakness was often coloured by his emphasis on the failure to employ the decimal system and trained commercial travellers rather than more fundamental and deep-seated issues like shortage of capital and lack of shipping capacity in the post-war years. He was nevertheless a readable and well-informed commentator on British interests in South America. He died on 20 June 1923 at his home, 23 Gilston Road, the Boltons, London, having contracted pneumonia. His funeral was held at Brompton cemetery. He was survived by his wife and daughter.<br>
