</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Middleton,  Richard William Evelyn</span>  (1846&#150;1905), <span class="occ">political agent</span>, was born in Putney, Surrey, on 16 February 1846, the younger son of Alexander Middleton (<i>d</i>. 1846), Admiralty clerk, and his wife, Elizabeth, daughter of Richard Neave, secretary to the Royal Hospital, Chelsea; they had two sons and one daughter. After a private education Middleton entered the navy in 1860 at the age of thirteen. In January 1873 he was promoted navigating lieutenant and his last service posting was in 1876. In 1877 he married Emily Florence, daughter of Colonel J. W. Rickards, which marked his virtual retirement from service, though he remained on the active list until 1882. In that year he was appointed honorary secretary of the Point House Club, Blackheath, one of the first of a new kind of Conservative political club, and in 1883 he became Conservative agent for the West Kent constituency. His model of the type of full-time professional party agent was the Middlesex agent Wollaston Pym, who set new standards of assiduity and expertise. So impressively did Middleton perform in coping with the cumulatively intricate effects of the <span class="roman">Corrupt Practices Act</span> of 1883, the third <span class="roman">Reform Act</span> of 1884, and the <span class="roman">Redistribution Act</span> of 1885, that, at the instance of the &#145;Kent gang&#146; of party managers (Lord Abergavenny, Sir William Hart Dyke, and the chief whip, Aretas Akers-Douglas), he was in 1885 offered the post of principal agent and command of the party's &#145;out of doors&#146; headquarters, Central Office, in succession to G. C. T. Bartley (1842&#150;1910).<br>
<br>Bartley, like his predecessor J. E. Gorst, had seen the principal agentship as a step in a tory democrat political career, and Central Office as a fulcrum for levering the party in a generally conformable democratic direction. Middleton possessed the invaluable attribute of having no political ambitions. He was an organizational technician of high competence with healthily modest notions of what central party organization of itself could achieve in shaping the course of elections. He was well aware of the extent to which his reputation for success in his profession depended on the advantageous turn for Conservatism in the terms of political trade of his times. A shift towards Conservatism in many middle- and lower-middle-class and artisan constituencies had been observable since 1868 and by the 1880s, with the emphasis given to suburban representation by the <span class="roman">Redistribution Act</span>, had become the most telling psephological fact of British politics. The complex registration arrangements left intact in 1884 by the third <span class="roman">Reform Act</span> helped Middleton and his team of constituency agents to perfect their expertise in keeping registers tight and polls low, which in turn reinforced Conservative advantage. Nor was Middleton unwilling candidly to concede benefits accruing from unpopular or controversial Liberal policies: he declared that he was &#145;grateful&#146; when Gladstone adopted home rule for Ireland; grateful also when Gladstone endorsed the Newcastle programme in 1891; and &#145;deeply grateful&#146; when the Liberals attacked the House of Lords and took up the local veto on liquor licences.<br>
<br>It is one thing to be offered advantages; it is quite another to have the wit to exploit them to optimum effect. It was Middleton's skill as an electioneering manager to optimize the prevailing benefits available to the Conservative Party in the epoch of unionism, empire, and what was widely deplored as the &#145;age of plutocracy&#146;. Of businesslike habits, energetic yet tactful in his dealings with the constituencies, urbane in his relationship with both superiors and subordinates, he was well prepared by his naval background to navigate the shoals and shallows and currents of new and uncharted political seas. Accorded the courtesy rank of captain and the colloquial sobriquet of Skipper, he worked harmoniously in trio with Akers-Douglas and with Salisbury's principal private secretary, Schomberg McDonnell (1861&#150;1915), through whom he enjoyed direct access to the &#145;Old Man&#146;. Middleton took &#145;great satisfaction&#146; from having Salisbury's confidence, and Salisbury is recorded as declaring, &#145;Douglas and Middleton have never put me wrong.&#146;<br>
<br>At Central Office (then in St Stephen's Chambers, Westminster Bridge), cramped and &#145;squalid&#146;, with a &#145;surprisingly small&#146; permanent staff, Middleton's managerial expertise reflected the emerging characteristics of the new age of &#145;mass&#146; politics. Central Office eclipsed the whip's office as the hub of the Conservative machine. Salisbury's accolade on Middleton in 1896 as &#145;chief wire-puller of the party&#146; was only half joking. In his comprehensive reorganization of the party's constituencies in 1886&#150;7 Middleton erased the traditional demarcation between counties and boroughs. He dovetailed the National Union apparatus into his new decentralized regional system of divisional subagencies. He worked pertinaciously, on the other hand, to bring the Scottish and Irish organizations under his effective supervision. As honorary secretary of the union he kept a firm grip on it, arranging for his agents to be delegates <i>ex officio</i> and setting one of his ablest subordinates, A. E. Southall, to run it from offices on the floor above Central Office as a propaganda medium. Middleton was always wary of the Primrose League as tending to amateurish meddling; he was wary also of the Liberal Unionists, with whom he dealt with strict propriety, fearful of what he held to be the weakly over-generous dispositions of Salisbury and, particularly, Balfour. He took a great interest in London county council politics and represented Dulwich on the council in 1898&#150;9. He shrewdly kept fences well mended with the police and the drink trade, and solicitously cultivated the &#145;new journalism&#146; represented most famously by the Harmsworths and the <span class="italic">Daily Mail</span>. A criticism increasingly levelled at him within the party was his partiality for a type of Conservative candidate distinguished mainly by wealth and a ready &#145;generosity&#146;, who put himself entirely in the hands of his agent.<br>
<br>Above all Middleton was concerned to raise the status of his agents by encouraging full-time, professionally qualified men to replace the old breed of part-time electioneering attorneys. He was instrumental in founding in 1891 the Society of Conservative Agents, and began the provision of superannuation and other benefits. To the historians of the Conservative agents, Elton Halliley and Arthur Fawcett, Middleton's was ever the &#145;revered and honoured name&#146;. In 1894 he launched the Association of Conservative Clubs.<br>
<br>The reputation of Middleton and Central Office&#151;already raised by their success in the 1892 election in blocking Gladstone's chances of a majority without Irish support&#151;was &#145;made&#146; by the greater achievement in 1895 of gaining a small but telling overall Conservative majority within the Unionist coalition. Lord Londonderry hailed Middleton on behalf of the National Union as the &#145;brilliant agent&#146;, who had done &#145;more than anybody else to secure the great victory we have achieved&#146;. Fears that financial exigency and his large family (five sons and two surviving daughters) might lead to Middleton's being lured away by business interests led to a subscription being raised in the party. On 19 March 1896, at the Constitutional Club, Salisbury presented Middleton with a cheque for &pound;10,000 subscribed by over 4000 admirers in &#145;acknowledgement of eleven years, energetic and successful organizing as head agent of the Conservative party&#146;.<br>
<br>With the unprecedented &#145;double&#146; of Unionist triumph in the &#145;khaki&#146; election of 1900, and with Conservatism's electoral ascendancy so manifest in the metropolitan&#150;home counties&#150;Lancashire axis, Middleton's reputation attained its ultimate lustre. That much was fragile in that ascendancy was soon to be exposed. It became clear also that Central Office's efficiency depended too much on Middleton's force of character and personal assiduity; his principal agentship faithfully reflected the weaknesses as well as the strengths of the era of Salisburian Conservatism. Like Salisbury, however, Middleton did not survive to witness the catastrophe of 1906. His stockily energetic appearance had for long belied uncertain health. After a series of breakdowns he was obliged to retire in July 1903, and he died at 6 Grand Parade, Eastbourne, after a long illness, on 26 February 1905.<br>
