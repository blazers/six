<span class="headword">Byrhtnoth</span>  (<em>d.</em> 996), <span class="occ">abbot of Ely</span>, spent his entire career in reformed Benedictine abbeys and was responsible for the refoundation of Ely Abbey after the depredations of the viking age. He was one of the original band of monks who had assembled under &AElig;thelwold at Abingdon about 954, where he received a Benedictine training and education; and about 963, when his patron became the bishop of Winchester, he was appointed as the prior of the Old Minster. It has been suggested that he was the son of Byrhtferth and the first cousin of the better-known Byrhtnoth (<i>d</i>. 991), ealdorman of Essex. If so, these family connections with the southern Danelaw may have been a factor in his selection as the abbot of Ely in 970. King Edgar granted Byrhtnoth and the monks of Ely authority over the two royal hundreds of the Isle of Ely, which freed the abbey from unwanted diocesan and secular attention, and was the basis of its great immunity in the high middle ages.<br>
<br>Between <i>c.</i>970 and <i>c.</i>990 Byrhtnoth excelled in the acquisition of relics and land for the abbey. During the night of 8 July 974 he and a party of Ely monks stole the body of St Wihtburh from East Dereham in Norfolk. After placing the saint in their wagon, the monks drove for 20 miles to reach their waiting ship. Although the villagers discovered the theft, they could not stop the Ely ship with its naval armaments sailing past them as they stood armed on the river bank. Byrhtnoth's putative kinsman, Ealdorman Byrhtnoth, became a patron of the abbey, with the result that the monks acquired forty-five estates during the late tenth and early eleventh centuries. When purchasing an estate, Byrhtnoth took a careful interest in the livestock before paying out any cash; and when buying land for the monks, he drove a hard bargain at local assemblies. His boldness, business acumen, and family connections ensured that by the end of the tenth century the abbey regained the prosperity that it had enjoyed in the seventh, thereby laying the foundations for the community's elevation into a bishopric about a hundred years after Byrhtnoth's death. In the early twelfth century the Ely monks invented incidents in Byrhtnoth's life, claiming that he played a vital role in the Maldon campaign of 991, and that he was murdered while seeking to curb the witchcraft of Queen &AElig;thelthryth. According to the <span class="italic">Liber Eliensis</span> Byrhtnoth died on 5 May 996 and was buried at Ely. His real achievement was to negotiate his way through the political landscape of the fenland shires for twenty-five years, ensuring that the Ely monks were not overshadowed by their neighbours at Ramsey Abbey.<br>
