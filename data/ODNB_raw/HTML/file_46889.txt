<span class="headword">Drewe <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em>Drew]</span>,  Julius Charles</span>  (1856&#150;1931), <span class="occ">retailer and architectural patron</span>, was born on 4 April 1856 at Pulloxhill vicarage, Pulloxhill, Ampthill, Bedfordshire, the sixth child in a family of four sons and three daughters of the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8049/', "Revd George Smith Drew (d. 1880)")</script> and his wife, Mary Peek. Drew's most recent ancestors had made their living through commerce: his great-grandfather had practised as a surveyor, and his grandfather George Drew became a tea broker in Marylebone, London. Although his mother's family came from Devon, they also made their living through tea; and following schooling at Bournemouth, Drew was sent by his uncle Francis Peek, a partner in the Liverpool tea importing firm of Peek and Winch, to China as a tea buyer. Drew stayed in the Far East for some years and returned shortly after his twenty-first birthday. A staid job with the firm in Liverpool proved not to his taste, however, and in 1878 Drew opened his own &#145;Willow Pattern Tea Store&#146; in that city.<br>
<br>In order to develop the business, in 1883 Drew went into partnership with John Musker. This was a shrewd alliance as Musker's knowledge of the retailing end of the trade was complemented by Drew's expertise as a tea buyer. The establishment of a London shop at 268 Edgware Road was the first fruit of their partnership; this was followed by the establishment of large stores at Islington, Birmingham, and Leeds, as well as a number of smaller tea stores. In 1885 Drew and Musker formed the Home and Colonial Trading Association, with Drew holding a majority of the shares.<br>
<br>Tea, and especially the fashionable Indian tea personally selected by Drew, remained the core of their business; but there was also a considerable trade in other groceries. Specializing in good quality products at low prices, the firm's turnover, and also profits, were very high. The number of retail outlets also continued to expand at a phenomenal rate: the number of shops peaked at 500 in 1903, and annual profits at &pound;220,000 in 1901.<br>
<br>Although founder of the grocery chain, Drew ceased from 1888 to have any active role in its management. Wishing to lead the life of a country gentleman, he was able to do so in his mid-thirties because of the increasingly powerful role played by his solicitor, William Capel Slaughter. The leading partner of the City firm of Slaughter and May, Slaughter had acted as Drew's adviser at the time of the launch of Home and Colonial, and had the entrepreneurial drive and City connections that were needed to mastermind the continued expansion of the firm. When the business was converted to a private limited company in March 1888, Slaughter undertook the chairmanship. Henceforth a very wealthy rentier, Drew nevertheless remained a director of the new firm, and he also personally retained more than half of the 150,000 ordinary &pound;1 shares.<br>
<br>Two years later Drew took the first step towards the establishment of a landed dynasty: on 16 September 1890 he married Frances, daughter of Thomas Richardson of Buxton, a cotton manufacturer. The couple had two daughters and three sons, and their first home was a romantic mock castle, Culverden, near Tunbridge Wells in Kent. In 1899 Drew acquired Wadhurst Hall in Sussex from the estate of the bankrupt Adrian de Murietta, a Spanish banker and extravagant friend of the prince of Wales. This mansion, along with its tapestries and exotic Spanish furniture, remained the family home for the next two decades and should have been enough to satisfy the ambitions of any <i>nouveau riche</i> shopkeeper. However, family tradition maintained that the Drews came from ancient Devon landowning stock, and Julius and his elder brother William investigated this further. With the aid of a professional genealogist they produced a family tree: this showed that one of their putative ancestors was Drogo or Dru, who had accompanied William the Conqueror to England; and his descendant, Drogo de Teign, gave his name to the parish of Drewsteignton (Dru-his-town on the Teign) in Devon in the twelfth century.<br>
<br>Drew was already familiar with the area, as his first cousin Richard Peek was rector of Drewsteignton; and it was probably on one of his visits there that he conceived the notion of building a castle on his ancestral domain. Moreover, the perfect site was available on glebe land belonging to his cousin: on a narrow ridge overlooking the steep gorge of the River Teign to the south and Chagford Vale to the north. Purchasing the site in 1910, along with 450 acres, he also changed his name by deed poll to the more authentic Drewe.<br>
<br>In need of an architect, Drewe was advised by Edward Hudson, the proprietor of <span class="italic">Country Life</span>, that Edwin Lutyens was &#145;the only possible architect&#146;  (Aslet, 168). Although the latter had not yet designed any grand buildings, his domestic architecture would have been familiar to Drewe; and he had also recently remodelled Lindisfarne Castle for Hudson in Northumberland. Lutyens accepted the commission and by 3 August 1910 he was writing to Emily, his wife, that:<blockquote>Mr Drew writes a nice and exciting letter. I go on with drawings not more than &pound;50,000 and &pound;10,000 for the gardens &hellip; Only I do wish he didn't want a castle&#151;but just a delicious loveable house with plenty of good large rooms in it. (<span class="italic">Letters of Edwin Lutyens</span>, 199)</blockquote>The site was staked out one day in early September, but Drewe's ideas were still developing. The principal modification required, Lutyens wrote, was that &#145;He wants to build a large keep or commemorative tower to commemorate the first Drogo &hellip; and this we planned and plotted and he was mighty pleased and proud&#146;. They got on &#145;famously&#146;, and, instead of returning that day to London, Lutyens &#145;went on to Sidmouth to talk more castles that night&#146;. Although his motoring expenses alone came to &pound;5 5<i>s</i>., Lutyens noted that he would get it all back, adding that &#145;Drewe travels and hotels en prince&#146;  (ibid., 205).<br>
<br>Despite what Lutyens had written to Emily, his preliminary sketches suggested a building of heroic proportions. Christopher Hussey noted that:<blockquote>As first conceived Drogo would have occupied the whole summit of its heather-clad promontory, approximating in extent and effect to a feudal castle such as Richmond, built of the glittering granite as massively as Durham, and growing out of its summit like a geological outcrop. (Hussey, 219)</blockquote>Yet because Drewe insisted that the castle had to be built in traditional fashion, using only solid granite laid 6 feet thick, this was never realistic. In the event the original design was scaled down by two-thirds, leaving two wings joined at an angle of 120&deg;, with the commemorative entrance tower and the great hall along the south front.<br>
<br>The foundation stone of Castle Drogo was laid on 4 April 1911. Lutyens was in overall control from his office in London, with Drewe's agent, John Walker, directing operations on site. There was a workforce of up to 100, many of whom hewed and dressed the stone; but, in an almost medieval fashion, every piece of granite was laid by two Devon stonemasons, Cleeve and Dewdney. Drewe's children soon discovered that Lutyens was &#145;a perfect tease&#146;, who would use the pepper and salt containers at table &#145;to illustrate a point connected with the design and he would make a lot of very quick sketches&#146;  (<span class="italic">Castle Drogo</span>, 49).<br>
<br>In the event Castle Drogo took more than twenty years to complete. Construction was delayed by the continued shortage of worked granite, but the major hold-up was caused by the outbreak of the First World War. More than three-quarters of the workers were called up, and progress was &#145;fearfully slow&#146;  (<span class="italic">Castle Drogo</span>, 50). Drewe, like so many other parents, also suffered a personal disaster in 1917, with the death of his eldest son, Adrian, who had been serving in Flanders. A room in the castle was later furnished as a memorial to him.<br>
<br>The last stone was laid at Castle Drogo on 22 December 1925, and two years later the family were able to start living at the house. Yet Drewe hardly lived long enough to enjoy being seigneur of Castle Drogo: he had suffered a stroke in 1924, and he died at Kilmorie, Asham Marine Drive, Torquay, on 10 November 1931, survived by his wife. His remains were buried in the churchyard at Drewsteignton, amid the shades of his ancestors, and covered by a simple granite tombstone designed by Lutyens.<br>
<br>Castle Drogo itself proved to be the lasting memorial to the medieval vision to which Julius Drewe, in alliance with Sir Edwin Lutyens, attempted to give material shape. Although an anachronism, and only a fragment of what was originally conceived, its massive and rugged features are genuinely fortress-like. &#145;The ultimate justification of Drogo is that it does not pretend to be a castle. It <i>is</i> a castle&#146;  (Hussey, 225). Another and more modern view, however, sees it as &#145;a great country house masquerading as a fortress&#146;  (Greeves and Trinick, 55).<br>
<br>In 1974 Drewe's grandson Anthony gifted Castle Drogo to the National Trust. Although it was the first twentieth-century house to pass into the trust's possession, the first thing visitors see as they approach the great entrance tower is, fittingly, the large heraldic Drewe lion carved above the doorway. Beneath it is carved the family motto, <i>Droge nomen et virtus arma dedit</i> (Drewe is the name and valour gave it arms).<br>
