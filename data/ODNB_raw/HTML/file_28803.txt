<span class="headword">Wase,  Christopher</span>  (1627&#150;1690), <span class="occ">schoolmaster and classical scholar</span>, was born in Hackney, Middlesex, and baptized on 6 January 1627, the son of John Wase of London (<i>d</i>. in or after 1670) and his wife, Susan, daughter of Richard Welby of London, merchant. He entered Eton College about 1639 and matriculated as a scholar from King's College, Cambridge, in Michaelmas 1645. A gifted polyglot and prolific scholar, while still an undergraduate he prepared a Greek translation of Hugo Grotius's <span class="italic">Baptizatorium puerorum institutio</span>, which was first published in 1647. He may have been the Christopher Wase, &#145;son of John Wase of Cambridge&#146;, admitted to Gray's Inn on 1 March that year. In 1648 he was elected to a fellowship at King's, from where he graduated BA in 1649. His translation of Sophocles' <span class="italic">Electra</span>, published the same year, was dedicated to Charles I's daughter Elizabeth, and in 1650 he was ejected from King's following his failure to take the engagement. He then travelled in France and the Low Countries. Captured at sea carrying letters to France for the royalists, he escaped and served as a soldier in Flanders. In 1652 he returned to England with financial assistance from John Evelyn the diarist and then became tutor to William Herbert (<i>b</i>. 1640), eldest son of the earl of Pembroke. Wase's translation of Faliscus Gratius's hunting poem <span class="italic">Cynegeticon</span> appeared in 1654. The following year he finally proceeded MA from Cambridge.<br>
<br>For the next thirteen years Wase gained his livelihood as a headmaster, from 1655 to 1662 at Dedham Royal Free School, Essex, and from 1662 to 1668 at Tonbridge School, Kent. By 1662, when his son Christopher was born, he had married Elizabeth, daughter of Gilbert Rayney, rector of St Mary-at-Stoke, Ipswich. In 1660 he published a celebration of the Restoration, <span class="italic">In mirabilem Caroli II</span>, and a dictionary, <span class="italic">Methodi practicae specimen; an Essay of a Practical Grammar</span>; another dictionary, <span class="italic">Dictionarium minus</span> (1662), followed. Convinced that Wase's talents were wasted and his salary of &pound;40 a year was inadequate, Evelyn recommended him for the post of historiographer in the office of Joseph Williamson, secretary of state. Wase was &#145;of a most innocent, sincere, humble and sedulous mind&#146;, with a &#145;style nervous and material but quick&#146;, and in the diarist's opinion he lacked nothing &#145;to qualify him equal to the ablest writer of this age, but his Majesty's favour&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1668&#150;9</i>, 65). Wase was given his appointment in April 1669.<br>
<br>Office gave Wase the opportunity to help his relatives and advance his scholarly interests. In 1671 he published two translations into English&#151;one of Cicero's orations against Cataline, the other <span class="italic">The History of France under the Ministry of Cardinal Mazarine</span>&#151;and, in response to criticisms that the growth of free schools had threatened established social distinctions and (allegedly) contributed to the dissension that led to the civil wars, undertook a pioneer investigation of the nation's grammar schools. His work was interrupted, however, when, arriving in Oxford on Eton College business in October 1671, he found that he had been elected by the university as a supervisor of the press and bedell in civil law. Avowing to Williamson on 15 October that it was done in his absence and without his knowledge, he anticipated trouble, and, via &#145;Dr Wren&#146;, enlisted the support of Archbishop Sheldon. Dean John Fell of Christ Church, delegate of the press, had indeed written to Sir Leoline Jenkins expressing his disgust at the choice of &#145;a Cambridge man, who I hear is crazed in his head and void of all judgement&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1671</i>, 523), but by 17 October Wase was able to write to Williamson that, &#145;the complete kindness of the university has defeated my fears and suspicions&#146;  (ibid., 529).<br>
<br>Wase's <span class="italic">Considerations Concerning Free Schools as Settled in England</span> was finally published in Oxford in 1678. &#145;Miserable is the face of any nation&#146;, he declared, &#145;where neither schools nor universities be frequented: no law, no safe commerce, a general ignorance and a neglect of duty both to God and man&#146;  (p. 34). He therefore proposed to increase rather than to limit the number of free schools in England and Wales, and concluded that adequate instruction should be provided for petty scholars in every parish in the land. This, he maintained, would be both socially and economically advantageous to the nation. The papers he had collected on the subject were consulted by Anthony Wood.<br>
<br>Wase's later publications included another dictionary, two further works on Cicero, <span class="italic">Aelfredi magni</span> (1678)&#151;a Latin version of John Spelman's life of Alfred&#151;and <span class="italic">Senarius, sive, De legibus et licentia veterum poetarum</span> (1687), a treatise on Greek and Latin metrics and rhythmics. Altogether his scholarship in the classical languages established him, according to John Loveday, as &#145;one of the most eminent Philologers which England could boast of in the last age&#146;  (Allibone, <span class="italic">Dict.</span>, 3.2595). Wase died in Oxford on 29 August 1690, and was buried in St Mary's, Oxford.<br>
<br>His son <a name="cosubject_28803"></a><span class="headword">Christopher Wase</span>  (1662&#150;1711), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, matriculated from Magdalen College, Oxford, on 19 October 1677 aged fifteen, and then moved to Corpus Christi College, from which he graduated BA in 1681 and proceeded MA in 1685. From 1687 to 1690 he was vicar of Preston, near Cirencester, Gloucestershire. He returned in 1691 to Corpus Christi, serving as proctor in that year. He proceeded BD in 1694. He died, leaving his coin collection to the college, on 4 April 1711, aged forty-eight, and was buried in Corpus chapel.<br>
