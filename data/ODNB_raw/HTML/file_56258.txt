<span class="headword">Wilks <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Bennett]</span>,  Elizabeth</span>  (1861&#150;1956), <span class="occ">suffragist and tax resister</span>, was born on 17 July 1861 at De Montfort Square, Leicester, the daughter of John Bennett, corn merchant and sometime mayor of Leicester, and his wife, Sarah Annie Swain. She qualified as a doctor, graduating MB in 1894 and MD the following year, and in 1896 received the degree of bachelor of surgery, also from the University of London. She practised in the East End of London for many years. On 30 July 1894 she married Mark Wilks, a teacher at a London county council school; and they had one adopted daughter, Helen.<br>
<br>As part of the Edwardian campaign to obtain the vote for women Elizabeth Wilks resisted payment of income tax, an action which ultimately resulted in her husband's imprisonment in 1912. She was a founder member and treasurer of the Women's Tax Resistance League, a suffragist organization whose aim was to refuse taxation until such time as women were enfranchised on the same terms as men. Established in 1909, the league drew on historic precedents of tax refusal on the principle that taxation without representation was unconstitutional, adopting the rallying cry of &#145;No Vote No Tax!&#146;  (Parkes, 39).<br>
<br>At the time&#151;despite the <span class="roman">Married Women's Property Acts</span> of 1870, 1874, and 1882&#151;a married woman was not legally liable for income tax. Under the <span class="roman">Income Tax Acts</span> of 1848 the separate incomes of husband and wife were aggregated and treated as one; any rebates were automatically paid to the husband. The wife was legally bound neither to pay income tax nor to disclose her income to her husband. Elizabeth and Mark Wilks exploited this anomaly during a four-year protest which confused the authorities and created publicity for the suffrage cause.<br>
<br>From 1908 Elizabeth Wilks refused to comply with the demand for payment of her income tax. In 1910 some of her goods were distrained&#151;that is, her property was seized in lieu of the tax payment. This was against the law since the tax was due from her husband. The Board of Inland Revenue then tried to claim the tax from both of them or from Mark Wilks alone, thus holding him liable for a tax on property which did not belong to him. He refused to pay. As a teacher employed by the London county council at Dalgleish Street School, Stepney, he earned considerably less than his wife, whose income from her medical practice was about &pound;600 a year. After a tortuous legal battle with the Board of Inland Revenue, Mark Wilks was imprisoned in Brixton gaol. Protest demonstrations were held in Trafalgar Square and Hyde Park, and over 3000 London teachers signed a petition objecting to his treatment. The case attracted a good deal of publicity in the national and provincial press, Elizabeth Wilks was very unpopular in some quarters, and the incongruous tax situation provided excellent publicity for the campaign for women's emancipation. Technically, Mark Wilks could have been held in gaol for an indefinite period until the debt was paid. However, he was released after two weeks and the couple were f&ecirc;ted by suffrage campaigners for their stand for equal rights.<br>
<br>The case was debated in the House of Lords, where Earl Russell argued that a state of law, &#145;which rendered a man liable to indefinite terms of imprisonment for matters over which he is by statute deprived of any control is undesirable and should be amended&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 15 Oct 1912, 10). For the government, Lord Ashby St Ledgers admitted the illogicality of the law but condemned the case as a publicity stunt, adding that Mark Wilks's imprisonment had been intended only as a deterrent  (ibid.). In the House of Commons the chancellor of the exchequer, Lloyd George, pointed out that changes in the law would lead to serious losses of revenue but said he would consider amending it  (<span class="italic">Hansard 5C</span>, 42, 1912). The regulations were not changed then, and a law permitting wives to have their earned income assessed separately for taxation purposes was not introduced until 1972.<br>
<br>The Wilks' daughter, Helen, died in 1919, and in 1923 the couple moved to Openlands, Furze Vale Road, Headley Down, Hampshire. In 1932 Elizabeth Wilks became concerned by the poor condition of the local housing stock, and in 1933 she set up the Headley Public Utility Society, which built sixteen new cottages for families in urgent need of rehousing. Elizabeth Wilks died at Openlands at the age of ninety-five on 16 November 1956, her husband having predeceased her. In her will she left Openlands to house a needy local person, and a 10 acre nature reserve; both are in the care of the Headley Public Utility Society.<br>
