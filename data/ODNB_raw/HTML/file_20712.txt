</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Oliphant,  Margaret Oliphant Wilson</span>  (1828&#150;1897), <span class="occ">novelist and biographer</span>, was born in Wallyford, Midlothian, on 4 April 1828, the only daughter and youngest surviving child of Francis W. Wilson (<i>c</i>.1788&#150;1858), a clerk, and his wife, Margaret Oliphant (<i>c</i>.1789&#150;1854). During the first ten years of her life the family moved first to Lasswade, near Edinburgh, and then in 1834 to Glasgow, where her father worked at the Royal Bank. In 1838 her father became excise clerk in the custom house at Liverpool. The Wilsons changed house in Everton at least five times before moving to Grosvenor Road in Birkenhead in 1850. Her reclusive father remained a shadowy figure. Her mother, who educated her daughter at home, was the driving force in the family; she kept abreast of the serious periodicals of the day and counted David Macbeth Moir, contributor to <span class="italic">Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine</span> under the pseudonym Delta, among her friends. Her mother's repertory of tales of Fife and the Oliphant ancestry fostered a lasting pride in Margaret's Scottish heritage and in the name to which she eventually became doubly entitled. Middle-class accomplishments such as music and art played no part in this regime. The family was, however, politically, religiously, and socially committed; her mother and elder brother, Frank Wilson (<i>c</i>.1816&#150;1875), were fervent radicals, and as a teenager Margaret collected signatories for an anti-cornlaw petition. Her parents had joined the breakaway Free Church of Scotland after the Disruption of 1843 and had imbibed the views of its leader, Dr Thomas Chalmers, on the need to practise philanthropy at the local and individual level. Her father was treasurer for the Scottish church's charitable relief work in the fluctuating trade conditions of Liverpool in the late 1840s, and Margaret's early fiction preached the importance of a Christocentric charitable philosophy; it also made use of the seafaring tales of Fife and of the Liverpool docks, and of the lives of the newly arrived workers in the terraced streets of a large city.<h2>
<a name="Earlywritings"></a>Early writings</h2>Margaret Oliphant's first novel, <span class="italic">Christian Melville</span>, was subsequently published in 1856 without her permission by her middle brother, Willie Wilson (<i>c</i>.1819&#150;1885). It had been written, when she was seventeen, to provide herself with &#145;some amusement and occupation&#146;  (<span class="italic">Autobiography</span>, 1990, 24) during her mother's serious illness and the heartache of a broken engagement. The home-instilled puritan work ethic and view of the woman's role as an uncomplainingly sacrificial moral exemplar produced in Margaret a lifelong ambivalence about her professional life as a writer. She was permitted to write &#145;at the corner of the family-table&#146; where the activity could be seen as the equivalent of her mother's sewing, making no claim to the exceptional demand of time and space justified by &#145;genius&#146;. Pride and pleasure in the work could only be justified in the face of constant reminders that women had more obvious domestic obligations to fulfil.<br>
<br>Margaret Oliphant's first published novel, <span class="italic">Passages in the Life of Margaret Maitland</span> (1849), attracted the attention of both Charles Dickens and Charlotte Bront&euml;, but jubilation was overshadowed by anxiety over her brother Willie, who had succumbed to his besetting sins of drink and debt while training for the Presbyterian ministry in London. Margaret was sent to watch over his final three months in London, where they shared lodgings with their Oliphant cousins, Frank and Tom. The miseries suffered by women required to shed a moral influence on male relatives over whom they had no other authority was to become a regular motif in her fiction.<h2>
<a name="Marriageandchildren"></a>Marriage and children</h2>Early in 1851 Frank Oliphant, Margaret's cousin, proposed to her and was refused. In the spring her mother decided to launch her daughter on literary Edinburgh. Mobilizing such connections as Delta and her husband's second cousins Daniel Wilson (1816&#150;1892) and George Wilson (1818&#150;1859), she secured Margaret a coveted introduction to the prestigious publishing firm of Blackwoods. By the autumn of 1851 Margaret had decided to accept Frank. Possibly the alternative of living with her alcoholic brother, Willie, who had been precipitately removed from his first post as minister of Etal in Northumberland before the church took disciplinary action, tipped the balance. On 4 May 1852 she married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20705/', "Francis Wilson (Frank) Oliphant (1818&#150;1859)")</script>, a painter and stained-glass window artist; their honeymoon was spent in Germany. In August her parents, accompanied by Willie, retired to London to be near her. Willie was paid 10 per cent of her profits for making fair copies of her manuscripts. He was to write five novels of his own but also managed to have four of his sister's attributed to his name&#151;<span class="italic">John Drayton</span> (1851), <span class="italic">The Melvilles</span> (1852), <span class="italic">Ailieford</span> (1853), and <span class="italic">Christian Melville</span> (1856).<br>
<br>Margaret's marriage felt the competing strains of her mother's need for her, her husband's consequent resentment, and the demands of two baby daughters, Maggie and Marjorie, who were born on 21 May 1853 and 22 May 1854 respectively. Motherhood had become her absorbing passion. Her adored mother's death on 17 September 1854, and the subsequent departure of Willie and her father, was swiftly overshadowed by the death of Marjorie on 8 February 1855, and that of a day-old son in November of that year. A fourth child, Cyril Francis, known as Tids (or Tiddy), was born on 16 November 1856. In the period between the birth of her daughters she traded upon the success of her first serialized novel, <span class="italic">Katie Stewart</span> (July to November 1852), to obtain regular employment as a reviewer from its publisher, <span class="italic">Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine</span>, and effect her escape from &#145;the Scylla and Charybdis of the novel craft&#146; formed by those commercially exploitative publishers, Bentley and Colburn. In her own self-deprecating terminology she became the &#145;general utility woman&#146;  (Oliphant, <span class="italic">William Blackwood and his Sons</span>, 2.349, 475) at Blackwoods, in some months contributing as much as one-third of their periodical. She adopted a male persona and the common reader's perspective; only politics, science, and philosophy remained outside her range.<br>
<br>Margaret's writing had become an important addition to the family's income. Her husband, the son of Thomas Oliphant, a glass cutter, frequented the minor artistic and literary circles of London and had an idealistic view of his artistic calling. He set up a workshop to execute his window designs and finance his ambition as a painter of the large historical and biblical pictures then in vogue, but in mid-1857 his tubercular condition first appeared. He disbanded the business and in January 1859 the family set out for the curative climate of Italy. When Margaret finally discovered that Frank had not told her his specialist's grim prognosis she was &#145;angry and wounded beyond measure&#146;  (<span class="italic">Autobiography</span>, 1990, 65). Pregnant and buoyed up by laudanum, she nursed him until his death on 20 October. She had to await the birth of her last child, Francis Romano (Cecco), in Rome on 12 December, before travelling home in February 1860 with an insurance policy of &pound;200 on her husband's life, her furniture in store, and &pound;1000 in debt. The only worthwhile legacy of the sojourn in Rome was the friendship of a bohemian couple, Robert and Geraldine Macpherson, to whom, in the early 1860s, she entrusted her alcoholic brother Willie. She contributed to his support for a further twenty-five years.<h2>
<a name="Furtherpublications"></a>Further publications</h2>Margaret moved restlessly between friends and relations while John Blackwood, her banker&#150;publisher, found her translation work on Comte Charles de Montalembert's <span class="italic">Les moines d'Occident</span>. In her despair at the refusal of Blackwoods to publish several of the articles which she submitted at this period, she began a story, in the spring of 1861, which was to inaugurate the provincial saga that made her famous: <span class="italic">The Chronicles of Carlingford</span>. These were published in <span class="italic">Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine</span> as follows: <span class="italic">The Executor</span> (May 1861), <span class="italic">The Rector</span> and <span class="italic">The Doctor's Family</span> (September 1861&#150;January 1862), <span class="italic">Salem Chapel</span> (February 1862&#150;January 1863), <span class="italic">The Perpetual Curate</span> (June 1863&#150;September 1864), <span class="italic">Miss Marjoribanks</span> (February 1865&#150;May 1866). (<span class="italic">Phoebe Junior: a Last Chronicle of Carlingford</span> was published separately in 1876.) Research for a biography of Edward Irving (1862), commissioned by his family, introduced her to what was to become her favourite genre: she wrote lives of the Comte de Montalembert (1872), Richard Brinsley Sheridan (1883), John Tulloch (1888), Laurence Oliphant (1891)&#151;a distant relative&#151;Thomas Chalmers (1893), and Queen Victoria (1890). Research trips also created new friendships, notably with Thomas Carlyle and his wife; John Tulloch, principal of St Andrews, and his family; and Robert Herbert Story, minister of the lochside parish of Rosneath, Dunbartonshire, who probably proposed to her around this time.<br>
<br>Margaret Oliphant settled in Ealing in October 1861, but it was with Mrs Tulloch that she led a large contingent of mothers and children to Rome in November 1863. Here, on 27 January 1864, after four days' fever, Maggie, her only surviving daughter, died. Although she commissioned a memorial window in the church at Rosneath, she avoided all mention of her daughter's name and never revisited Rome. For nineteen months she tried an expatriate peripatetic life, but her sons' need for regular schooling, and perhaps the need to live closer to the source material of her domestic novels, if she were to achieve the goal, that John Blackwood assured her was within her grasp, of joining the first rank of novelists  (<span class="italic">Autobiography and Letters</span>, 198), led her to return to England in September 1865. Blackwood's payment of &pound;1500 for <span class="italic">The Perpetual Curate</span> (1864), the largest sum she was ever paid for a novel, allowed her to choose Windsor as a base from which to send her sons as day boys to Eton College. Her habit of starting work as others went to bed enabled her to be available as a welcoming mother or gracious hostess over the tea or dinner table.<h2>
<a name="Increasingfinancialresponsibilities"></a>Increasing financial responsibilities</h2>A settled, solvent household attracted dependants: a distant cousin, Annie Louisa Walker, soon became Margaret Oliphant's secretary&#150;housekeeper at 6 Clarence Crescent, in Windsor. In 1868, just as Margaret was granted a civil-list pension of &pound;100, her brother Frank was bankrupted; she took in his two older children, while enabling the two youngest, Margaret 
    (or Madge; 1863&#150;1897)
   and Janet Mary 
    (Denny; 1865&#150;1954)
  , to join their parents abroad. In mid-1870 Frank, now widowed and psychologically incapable of work, and his younger daughters looked to his sister for a home. She provided her nephew, Frank Wilson, with an education at Eton and training for an engineering career in India. After their father's death in 1875, Madge and Denny soon became &#145;the unquestioned daughters of the house&#146;, receiving schooling in Germany and artistic training, as an engraver and portrait painter respectively, at their aunt's expense.<br>
<br>Margaret perceived 1870, the year in which she became sole breadwinner for two families, as a watershed in her career. Since her brother Willie had negotiated her first contract with Henry Colburn, she had, unusually for a woman of this period, conducted her own business. Dependent always on advances against the next book, but seemingly blessed with astounding literary fecundity, she had not adopted an economic lifestyle; women travelling companions were reputedly shocked by her habit of ordering revivifying champagne and meat for dinner and, despite proclaiming herself &#145;a fat, little commonplace woman, rather tongue-tied&#146;  (<span class="italic">Autobiography</span>, 1990), portraits of her reveal her love of fine clothes. Now, however, she needed a regular income. She blamed a male-dominated publishing world for her failure to secure an editorship of a periodical such as those achieved by Dickens, Anthony Trollope, or Thackeray; but her loyalty to the Blackwoods, for whom editorships were a matter of family succession, her determination only to consider the top periodicals, and the tartness of speech, of which even her closest friends such as Annie Thackeray accused her, may also have stood in her way. Blackwoods did make her editor of their <span class="roman">Foreign Classic</span> series. She financed holidays by obtaining sizable advances from Macmillans for a sporadic but infinitely extendible series of books which purveyed cultural history through biographical sketches: <span class="italic">The Makers of Florence</span> (1876) was followed by books on Venice (1887), Edinburgh (1890), Jerusalem (1891), and Rome (1896). Finding tenants for their house, or paying members to swell their travelling party, and managing the complex postal arrangements for receiving and dispatching material also fell to her lot.<br>
<br>In 1878, having obtained advances from both Blackwoods and Macmillans, Margaret bought 8&#150;9 Clarence Crescent, Windsor, which she had rented since 1872, for &pound;1600. In the late 1870s she could still command &pound;750 for a three-decker novel, but in the next decade her expenses always exceeded her income and she found herself forced to work incessantly, always in fear of flooding her own market, and without the time necessary for driving harder bargains with publishers. In the 1880s she claimed, &#145;my anxieties were sometimes almost more than I could bear&#146;  (<span class="italic">Autobiography</span>, 1990, 151). Her son Cyril, who had already displayed propensities to drink and debt as an Oxford undergraduate, showed little enthusiasm for work as a barrister. After a spell as private secretary to the governor of Ceylon in 1884 (which proved threatening to his health), he returned to England to become a dependant of his mother, who tried, with little success, to interest him in literary work. Cecco, her younger son, was sent abroad to acquire German after a disappointing degree at Oxford, and in July 1889 he acquired a part-time post in the library at Windsor Castle. He was cited by his mother as her co-author for <span class="italic">The Victorian Age of Literature</span> (1892), but his health and temperament prevented his finding permanent employment.<h2>
<a name="Spiritualityandwriting"></a>Spirituality and writing</h2>During her despair over her sons' indolence Margaret experienced one important source of comfort: the occasional gift of &#145;a great quiet and calm&#146; that she identified with &#145;the peace that passeth all understanding&#146;  (<span class="italic">Autobiography</span>, 1990, 53). This spiritual consolation fed itself into her tales of the supernatural, which undoubtedly responded to a contemporary vogue for such literary antidotes to the age's perceived materialism but also provided her with a genre in which to explore deep-seated preoccupations with family relationships and gender construction. She felt that these tales were &#145;given&#146; to her and took unusual pains with them. She was particularly proud of <span class="italic">A Beleaguered City</span> (1879), an experiment in multiple narrative. Robert Louis Stevenson confessed that he had been moved to tears by this tale of a French city taken over by the spirits of the dead. <span class="italic">The Wizard's Son</span> (1884) was her only novel in this vein. Her popular <span class="roman">Little Pilgrim</span> series of tales, designed to console the bereaved, respond to a Victorian obsession with eschatology (21,000 copies of the first of the series had been printed within five years), but some of her tales of the afterlife, such as her dystopia, &#145;The Land of Darkness&#146; (1888), still hold interest because of her conviction that such a thin veil separates the earthly life from the continuum beyond. Her religious position could best be described as dogmatic Christian unorthodoxy; her sympathies were with those passionate &#145;outsiders&#146;&#151;Montalembert, Irving, or Laurence Oliphant&#151;who seemed, like her, to combine worldly shrewdness with a na&iuml;ve enthusiasm for the supernatural. Friendship with the eminent Scottish churchmen Tulloch and Story won her back to the established church but reinforced her sceptical attitude to clerical spiritual authority. The eclecticism of Anglicanism made it an appropriate haven, and Margaret's political radicalism had also disappeared: in 1886 she and Queen Victoria discussed their mutual detestation of Gladstone.<h2>
<a name="Finalyearsanddeath"></a>Final years and death</h2>In 1889 medical expenses mounted: Cecco was repeatedly sent abroad for his health and Cyril had a seizure in a railway station in Paris. Both sons and Madge accompanied Margaret on the Easter 1890 research expedition for her book on Jerusalem. On 8 November Cyril died, after only four days' illness: there could be no consolation from a life well spent. As the century waned Margaret's only wish was to survive long enough to provide secure futures for Cecco and her nieces. Madge married William Harris Valentine, a Dundee jute manufacturer, in July 1893. Margaret returned from the birth of their daughter and her namesake to find Cecco suffering from &#145;exhaustion after inflammation of the throat and tongue&#146;. He died on 1 October 1894, and within hours his mother was recording the event in her autobiography. By the end of her life she had worn a hole in her forefinger which would not heal.<br>
<br>In April 1896, accompanied by Denny (who had changed her surname to Oliphant by deed poll) and their almost permanent guest, John Tulloch's daughter, Fanny, Margaret moved to The Hermitage, Wimbledon Common. The invitation by Blackwoods to write <span class="italic">Annals of a Publishing House</span> yielded &pound;500 p.a. Despite her sense of being &#145;on the ebb-tide&#146;  (Oliphant, <span class="italic">The Ways of Life</span>), the last three years witnessed a novel, <span class="italic">Old Mr Tredgold</span>; a tale of the unseen, &#145;The Library Window&#146;; and the opening chapters of <span class="italic">The Makers of Rome</span>, which were entirely characteristic of her finest work. In April 1897, commissioned by a new publisher, J. M. Dent, she undertook a research trip to Siena but recognized that she was suffering from more than her chronic rheumatism. She died at The Hermitage on 25 June 1897 from cancer of the colon and exhaustion, and was buried on the 29th alongside her sons in the cemetery at Eton. On 16 July 1908 her friend and admirer, the writer J. M. Barrie, who had edited <span class="italic">A Widow's Tale and other Stories</span> (1898), unveiled a memorial tablet in St Giles's Church, Edinburgh. Windsor's tributary plaque at 8&#150;9 Clarence Crescent was unveiled on 25 June 1997, the centenary of her death.<br>
<br>Assessing her own achievement, this bereft mother remarked &#145;I shall not leave anything behind me that will live&#146;  (<span class="italic">Autobiography</span>, 1990, 136). Her death amid the swiftly changing literary preoccupations of the end of the century made Margaret Oliphant a convenient symbol for the outdated female romancers of domestic fiction who had too often been prepared to sacrifice artistic integrity to financial need. Furthermore the reshaping of her autobiography by her literary executors contrived to transform this passionate, witty, wryly self-aware, and immensely energetic author into a model of quietly suffering Victorian femininity. The herculean fictional output of some ninety-eight novels and fifty or more short stories undoubtedly shows her ability to gauge changing fashion: the novels span social concern, Scottish tales, the Gothic, the sensational, the historical, provincial sagas, and quieter psychological studies. They equally reveal her as creator as much as creation of her literary milieu: the voracious reading involved in her twenty-five works of non-fiction and over three hundred periodical articles fuelled the disconcerting questions repeatedly raised in her fiction as to the age's accepted ideologies of marriage, family, religion, and gender. In her obituary Henry James asserted that &#145;no woman had ever, for half a century, had her personal &#147;say&#148; so publicly&#146;; contemporary writers flinched at the whiplash cracks of epigrammatic wit sometimes woven into her reviews. It seems likely that Anthony Trollope's Lady Carbury in <span class="italic">The Way we Live now</span> (1875) and James's Mrs Stormer in &#145;Greville Fane&#146; (1892) were vitriolic responses to the power her voice carried. Despite her well-known asperity about male failings, her distinctive voice, which encompassed both irony and pathos within its deceptively &#145;artless&#146; cadences, appealed as much to male as female readers: Tennyson, Gladstone, and Darwin all praised her work. Feminist criticism has been slow to recognize her virtues, largely because her thoroughly feminist analysis often resulted in anti-feminist conclusions.<br>
