<span class="headword">Kilvert,  (Robert) Francis</span>  (1840&#150;1879), <span class="occ">diarist</span>, was born in Hardenhuish, Wiltshire, on 3 December 1840, the second child and elder son in a family of four daughters and two sons of the Revd Robert Kilvert, rector of Hardenhuish, and his wife, Thermuthis Coleman. He was educated privately at a small school run by his father at Hardenhuish rectory, and latterly at Claverton Lodge School, Bath, run by his uncle <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15544/', "Francis Kilvert")</script>. He went up as a commoner to Wadham College, Oxford, in 1858, and took fourth-class honours in law and modern history in 1862. He was ordained deacon in 1863 and priest in 1864, served for two years as his father's curate in Langley Burrell, Wiltshire, and then went as curate to the Revd R. L. Venables in Clyro, Radnorshire. He stayed in Clyro until 1872, then returned to a further curacy under his father in Langley Burrell until 1876, when he was appointed vicar of St Harmon, Radnorshire. There he stayed for little more than a year, being appointed vicar of Bredwardine, Herefordshire, at the end of 1877. He was a popular and energetic country clergyman who wrote conventional verse and made a collection of Radnorshire folklore, some of which was published in local newspapers.<br>
<br>Kilvert kept diaries from the beginning of 1870 until his death, but he remained totally unknown to the general public until the publication of a selection from these diaries in a three-volume edition, edited by William Plomer, in 1938&#150;40. Some of the manuscript diaries had already been destroyed by his widow. They appear to have dealt with the courtship of Kilvert and his wife, and with two previous romantic attachments of Kilvert's. In the 1950s the Kilvert descendants agreed that Mrs Essex Hope, Kilvert's niece, who had custody of the diaries, should burn all except three early ones. She told Jeremy Sandford, who had written radio talks and a radio play about Kilvert, that the family was not happy with some of the matter in the diaries. The surviving three diaries have been published in their entirety, two by the National Library of Wales (1982 and 1989) and one by Alison Hodge (1989). Only a few small fragments survive of the rest of the text.<br>
<br>The diary quickly achieved remarkable popularity, and has been republished in numerous editions. It depicts the periods of Kilvert's life as a curate in Clyro and Langley Burrell, and is a picture of the life of mid-Victorian rural society seen by a sensitive member of the gentry. Kilvert, who was very conscientious in the discharge of his pastoral duties, was acquainted with an unusually broad spectrum of village society, and proved himself a sharp, compassionate, and sometimes humorous observer.<br>
<br>Although Kilvert's judgements are generally conventional and his tastes often sentimental, there are many passages where the prose rises to poetic heights of description. A great lover of the works of William Wordsworth and of his sister, Dorothy Wordsworth, who also kept a journal, Kilvert was keenly aware of the beauties of nature, and some of his descriptions of the Wye valley and the Welsh border are classics of landscape writing. There are some memorable set pieces, such as the climb up Cadair Idris, when a shaken Kilvert thought of Moses on Sinai. A week later he wrote of an angel satyr walking the Clyro hills. He loved the Greek classics, and on his walks he believed that he witnessed the Christian and mythic tales blend in a harmonious whole. In a ruined church near Garth, for instance, he thought of owls roosting and satyrs dancing. He walked miles in all weathers, visiting schools and parishioners, and places or people who took his fancy. In 1874 he paid a memorable visit to the Revd William Barnes, whom he called the &#145;great idyllic poet of England&#146;. He described him as &#145;half-hermit, half-enchanter&#146;, and although he laughed at the humorous poems, he really preferred the pathetic ones.<br>
<br>The diary reflected the two aspects of Kilvert's character, displaying the sociable, well-liked, responsible young curate, always welcome at parties, and the poet who needed his solitary walks to admire and wonder at the power and splendour of the world God had made.<br>
<br>The public events of Kilvert's time left little mark on the border country, and, apart from accounts of occasional visits to London and Oxford and of a holiday in Cornwall, which is one of the diary's <i>tours de force</i>, Kilvert's record hardly strays beyond rural Radnorshire and Wiltshire. He paid at least two visits to France and Switzerland, but neither of these is covered by the diary. In 1878 he was offered the English chaplaincy at Cannes, but refused it (against his doctor's advice, for Kilvert was often ill). The more intimate details of his personal life are, however, fully exhibited in the diary. He had no gift for self-analysis, but recorded his propensity for falling in love, just as he recorded in voluptuous detail the sight of the young girls whom he taught in school. Nor was his widow embarrassed by his frankness, for she did not remove those passages. It took readers of a later century to recognize their fundamentally erotic nature. The diary, both a record and a release for Kilvert, took perseverance to complete after a day's work. But he succeeded in turning his diary's limitations&#151;its narrow range of vision and the na&iuml;vety of his own judgements&#151;into advantages, to give it a vividness and a simplicity shared by few similar journals, making it both a major document of Victorian rural life and a minor but moving work of literature.<br>
<br>Kilvert's closest friend was Anthony Mayhew, a fellow of Wadham College. They spent holidays together, and Kilvert stayed with Mayhew when he revisited Oxford. Mayhew was the only person permitted to read Kilvert's diary, and he enjoyed the character studies of unusual personages. When the pair were on holiday in Paris, Mayhew introduced to Kilvert Elizabeth Anne Rowland, the daughter of John Rowland of Wootton, near Woodstock. Three years later, on 26 August 1879, she became Kilvert's wife. He had long wished to be married and have children of his own, but as an impoverished curate had been forced to wait until his late thirties. Tragically Kilvert died at Bredwardine vicarage of peritonitis on 23 September 1879, ten days after returning from the honeymoon. The marriage was childless; his widow survived him until 1911, but did not remarry. She returned to Wootton and pursued a life of charitable work in the village.<br>
<br>In 1948 the Kilvert Society was formed in Hereford on the initiative of William Plomer and a Hereford businessman who was a great admirer of Kilvert. Its aims were &#145;to foster an interest in the Rev. Francis Kilvert, his work, his diary, and the country he loved&#146;. The society has issued a number of publications.<br>
<br>On 16 March 1870, prompted by the sound of a bird singing unseen, Kilvert had written that the words of a good man might live long after he was silent and out of sight, and he quoted: &#145;He being dead yet speaketh.&#146; Those five words were carved above his grave at Bredwardine, and, for the modern reader, reflect his justified hope that his diary would be read after his death.<br>
