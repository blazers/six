<span class="headword">Seymour,  Beatrice Mary  Kean</span> <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Beatrice Mary Stapleton]</span>  (1886&#150;1955), <span class="occ">novelist</span>, was born on 1 September 1886 at 27 Peardon Street, Clapham, London, the second daughter of David George Stapleton (<i>b</i>. 1862/3), a journeyman farrier, and his wife, Margaret, <i>n&eacute;e</i> North (<i>b</i>. 1860/1861). Her memories were to be of a &#145;Puritanic upbringing, with its revivalist meetings and distrust of everything which seemed to me to make life worth living&#146;  (Seymour, 140). Yet her mother would tell stories as she did the housework and in her turn Beatrice told stories to her classmates. She decided to be a writer early on; after secretarial college she earned her living (Horatio Bottomley was one of her employers), possibly studied English literature at King's College, London, and wrote numerous short stories. Encouraged by one of the teachers at the secretarial college, she had entered and won a short story competition with a story written when she was seventeen. After this she wrote regularly for women's magazines and also had stories accepted by more literary publications such as <span class="italic">Bystander</span>, <span class="italic">Queen</span>, and <span class="italic">Magpie</span>. She could not attempt a full-length book because she &#145;left the house at nine, and frequently did not return to it until ten&#146; at night  (ibid., 139). With her marriage to William Kean Seymour (1887&#150;1975) on 23 August 1915 came the leisure to attempt a novel, since her husband earned a living as a bank clerk (and would later be a bank manager, poet, parodist, and anthologist, and fellow of the Royal Society of Literature). It took her<blockquote>three years to write down, in the intervals of running a small house, cooking the meals, doing odd secretarial jobs, teaching shortand to young women &hellip; and &hellip; visiting a husband stuck up on a bleak Lincolnshire plain with what was then the Royal Naval Air Force (Seymour, 140)</blockquote>the novel that was to be <span class="italic">Invisible Tides</span> (1919). This was in part &#145;a study of the war years seen by a young woman who hated them and stayed at home&#146;  (ibid., 141). Kean Seymour declared her first love to be the short story but wrote novels because she believed only they could be used as a vehicle for social ideas; however, her twenty-seven novels written at the rate of almost one a year over thirty-six years were almost entirely rather aimless upper middle-class family sagas. Alas, it was fairly remarked by her critics that she was unthinkingly verbose; for example Rebecca West called <span class="italic">Intrusion</span> (1921) &#145;immensely and incompetently long. Plainly, the idea that art is a selective process as well as a response to life, and demands treatment as well as statement of situations, is not present in Mrs Seymour's mind&#146;  (Kunitz and Haycraft, 1265). Nevertheless, her obituarist in <span class="italic">The Times</span> called her a novelist of &#145;charm and power&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 2 Nov 1955). <span class="italic">Three Wives</span> (1927), <span class="italic">Youth Rides Out</span> (1928), and <span class="italic">False Spring</span> (1929) were reprinted as early Penguins in 1936, 1937, and 1941. <span class="italic">Daughter to Philip</span> (1933) is one of her more interesting novels. Like so many other women writers (G. B. Stern, Sheila Kaye-Smith, Margaret Kennedy, and Elizabeth Jenkins, for example) she wrote a study of Jane Austen (in 1937). The Kean Seymours lived in London, spending weekends at Brown's Gate, Bucklebury, Berkshire. Beatrice Kean Seymour was an exceptionally private person and one has to commend the resourcefulness of Messrs Kunitz and Haycraft who, when compiling their volume <span class="italic">Twentieth-Century Authors</span> in 1942, commented ruefully that she:<blockquote>speaks in one of her novels of &#145;those beautifully rare people who can be content to know a man or woman's work without wishing to pick over the rags of their private lives&#146;. In her <span class="italic">Who's Who</span> biography Mrs Seymour [only] records her address, the name of her publishers, the customary list of her books and the name of her husband. (Kunitz and Haycraft, 1265)</blockquote>. Towards the end of Beatrice's life she and her husband divorced and William married Rosalind Herschel Wade (1909&#150;1989), also a novelist, who was appointed OBE for her services to literature; they had two sons. Beatrice lived on her own at 49 Elm Park Court, Pinner, Middlesex. She was a great dog lover. Her close friend was Constance Evelyn Redfearn. She died aged sixty-nine of heart failure on 31 October 1955 at Northwood Cottage Hospital, Ruislip, Middlesex, and was cremated.<br>
