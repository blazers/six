<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Spragge, Sir  Edward</span>  (<em>c.</em>1629&#150;1673), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, was a son of Lichfield Spragge (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1645) of Roscommon and Mary Legge, an aunt of George Legge, Lord Dartmouth. Spragge's grandfather had served in Elizabeth's Irish army and his father was killed as governor of Roscommon during the civil war. Little is known of Spragge's early career. He is said to have spent some time as a slave in Algiers, and it is possible that he served in Prince Rupert's royalist squadron between 1648 and 1653. He subsequently married Clara Colaert, daughter of the governor of Dunkirk. In company with Clara's brother, Spragge put to sea about 1655 in command of a French privateer, which was badly damaged by an English frigate off La Rochelle; unable to fund a second voyage, Spragge then took a volunteer's place under the royalist captain Richard Beach. He subsequently commanded the royalist privateer <i>Charles</i>, but the Dutch captured this in July 1660, losing him &pound;10,000&#151;or so he claimed. Spragge was always to possess a reputation for avarice, and when he entered the navy shortly afterwards, Charles II's favourite Charles Berkeley remarked &#145;whether it could be thought safe to put one of the king's ships into his hands, lest he should run away with her, his condition being so necessitous, and his former dealings of no better reputation&#146;  (<span class="italic">Samuel Pepys and the Second Dutch War</span>, ed. R. Latham, 1995, 243).<br>
<br>Despite such concerns Spragge became captain of the <i>Portland</i> on 16 March 1661. He served aboard her until the end of 1662, becoming captain of a foot company at Portsmouth in the same year. He commanded the <i>Dover</i> from May to October 1664 before moving into the <i>Lion</i>, which he commanded at the battle of Lowestoft on 3 June 1665; on 24 June he was knighted for his gallantry in this engagement. Spragge commanded the <i>Royal James</i> from August to October 1665. By this time he had abandoned his wife and taken a mistress, probably Dorothy Dennis, with whom he had children. He made the acquaintance of Samuel Pepys at much the same time: the diarist's first impression, not yet clouded by Spragge's later involvement in faction fighting and opposition to Pepys's own patron, Sandwich, was of &#145;a merry man that sang a pleasant song pleasantly&#146;  (Pepys, <span class="italic">Diary</span>, 11 Jan 1666). During the 1666 campaign Spragge commanded the <i>Triumph</i> before moving into the <i>Dreadnought</i> on 27 May and fighting in her during the Four Days' Battle (1&#150;4 June 1666). After this engagement he was appointed vice-admiral of the blue on 8 June 1666, flying his flag in the <i>Victory</i> and taking a prominent part in the St James's day fight (25 July 1666). At this time Spragge was regarded as the leading naval client of Prince Rupert and was accused, falsely, of instigating the &#145;division of the fleet&#146; which precipitated the Four Days' Battle (allegedly so that Rupert would not have to share any glory with his joint admiral, Albemarle). In 1667 Spragge served as commander of a squadron attempting to secure the Medway and Sheerness against the Dutch attack on 9&#150;10 June; in the two disastrous days which followed, he moved ashore to take command of some of the gun batteries, and subsequently led a force of frigates and fireships into battle against another Dutch incursion on 23 July. Spragge's background made him a natural scapegoat for the Medway disaster, and he was accused of being an Irish papist. However, he successfully survived a parliamentary inquiry in October 1667, throwing the blame instead onto Peter Pett.<br>
<br>Spragge commanded the <i>Revenge</i> in 1668, later serving as ambassador to the Spanish Netherlands from 27 November 1668 to 29 January 1669. In April 1669 he rejoined the <i>Revenge</i>, bound for the Mediterranean, where he served as vice-admiral to Sir Thomas Allin in the fleet fighting the Algerine corsairs. When Allin went home Spragge became admiral in his place (24 September 1670). His greatest success in this command was his spectacular victory over the Algerine fleet at Bugia Bay on 8 May 1671. Although the enemy vessels were in a well protected harbour, ships' boats broke the boom, enabling a fireship to enter and wreak havoc. Seven Algerine warships and three prizes were destroyed, and the battle prompted a coup in Algiers which led to the signing of a peace treaty. For his success, Spragge was rewarded with 3000 ounces of plate and a pension of &pound;1000 p.a.<br>
<br>Returning to England in the <i>Rupert</i>, Spragge met a squadron under Sir Robert Holmes in the English Channel on 10 March 1672. Holmes had secret orders to attack the Dutch Smyrna convoy, and it was assumed for many years that because he was determined to claim the victory for himself, he failed to pass these on to Spragge, despite allegedly obtaining intelligence of the Dutch fleet's movements from him, and therefore did not maximize his chances of success by uniting the two squadrons. In fact, the two squadrons never communicated with each other at all, as Spragge's journal proves. Nevertheless the relationship between Holmes and Spragge was a bitter one. Holmes by then was Prince Rupert's chief naval client, but Spragge had turned against the prince and thrown in his lot with the duke of York. Spragge was reported to have said that it was for &#145;the king which he would choose, Holmes or him, and that it would spoil his whole service to make use of them both&#146;  (Pepys, <span class="italic">Tangier Papers</span>, 245). Spragge commanded the <i>London</i> during the 1672 campaign against the Dutch, serving successively as vice-admiral of the blue, vice-admiral of the red, and finally admiral of the blue following the battle of Sole Bay on 28 May 1672, in which he again distinguished himself. In February 1673 Spragge undertook a diplomatic mission to France to adjust the terms of the Anglo-French alliance, attending <i>en route</i> a by-election at Dover at which he was elected an MP; although the result was initially declared void, he won a second ballot, but never took his seat due to his departure for sea as admiral of the blue, flying his flag in the <i>Royal Prince</i>. He fought in the battles of Schooneveld (28 May and 4 June 1673), and was fiercely critical of the tactics of his admiral, Rupert, throughout the campaign. At the battle of the Texel (11 August 1673) Spragge ordered his Blue squadron, in the rear, to back its sails in order to resume a private battle with Tromp, apparently dating from the 1666 campaign. Indeed, among the last words in Spragge's journal, written the night before, were &#145;Tromp is now in the rear &hellip; he will, I hope, fall to my share in the Blue squadron tomorrow&#146;  (Anderson, <span class="italic">Journals and Narratives</span>, 330). The <i>Prince</i> was badly damaged in a three-hour battering from Tromp's flagship and shortly after midday Spragge shifted his flag to the <i>Saint George</i>. When she lost her main topmast shortly afterwards he attempted another transfer, this time to the <i>Royal Charles</i>, but his boat was sunk <i>en route</i> and Spragge was drowned.<br>
<br>Spragge was buried at Westminster Abbey on 23 September 1673. By his will dated 22 May 1673 he made bequests totalling &pound;4800, chiefly to his two sons with Dorothy Dennis, William and Edward Spragge, and his daughter Dorothy. Payment of the bequests had to await a grant by the crown in January 1675 of arrears of pay and pensions totalling over &pound;3000.<br>
