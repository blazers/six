<span class="headword">Harrison,  Kathleen</span>  (1892&#150;1995), <span class="occ">actress</span>, was born on 23 February 1892 at 500 Whalley New Road, Little Harwood, Blackburn, Lancashire, the daughter of Arthur Harrison, assistant engineer to Blackburn corporation, and his wife, Alice Maud, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Parker. From the age of five, when her father became borough engineer for Southwark, she was brought up in London. She was educated at Clapham high school before training at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (1914&#150;15), where she won the Du Maurier bronze medal. While rehearsing her role as Eliza Doolittle for a production of <span class="italic">Pygmalion</span> there the play's writer, George Bernard Shaw, visited and gave her advice that would help her in her subsequent career: &#145;Go out into the Old Kent Road and just listen to the women talking&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Independent</span>).<br>
<br>Although she appeared in the film <span class="italic">Our Boys</span> (1915) on leaving drama school, Harrison married John Henry Back (<i>d</i>. 1960), of the Western Telegraph Company, in the following year, and lived with him in Argentina and Madeira for eight years. When he became unemployed they returned to Britain, and Harrison made her stage d&eacute;but as Mrs Judd in <span class="italic">The Constant Flirt</span>, at the Pier Theatre, Eastbourne, in 1926. The next year she appeared in the West End as Winnie in <span class="italic">The Cage</span>, at the Savoy Theatre. This was the start of a fifty-year stage career in which she became notable for playing cockney mothers, maids, and charwomen. Her subsequent West End plays included <span class="italic">A Damsel in Distress</span> (1929), <span class="italic">The Merchant and Venus</span> (1930), <span class="italic">Lovers' Meeting</span> (1931), <span class="italic">Line Engaged</span> (1934), <span class="italic">The Corn is Green</span> (1938), and <span class="italic">Flare Path</span> (1942&#150;4), but it was her role as the comic cook, Mrs Terence, in Emlyn Williams's chiller <span class="italic">Night must Fall</span>, at the Duchess Theatre in 1935, that established her as a star, and she reprised it in the 1937 film version. She toured north Africa and Italy with Emlyn Williams's Entertainments National Service Association company in 1944. After the war she played, to great acclaim, on stage and screen, the role of Violet, the excitable maid, in Terence Rattigan's <span class="italic">The Winslow Boy</span> (Lyric Theatre, 1946, adapted two years later for the cinema) and took over from Peggy Mount the lead part of fearsome mother Emma Hornett in <span class="italic">Watch it Sailor!</span> (1960). On stage she also played a blunt former chorus girl in No&euml;l Coward's <span class="italic">Nude with Violin</span> (Globe Theatre, 1956) and Mrs Hardcastle in <span class="italic">She Stoops to Conquer</span> (Young Vic Theatre, 1972), one of her rare classical roles.<br>
<br>In the cinema Harrison was usually seen in the same types of role, playing cockney domestics. Her early films included <span class="italic">The Man from Toronto</span> (1932, as Jessie Matthews's maid), <span class="italic">The Ghoul</span> (1933, alongside Boris Karloff), <span class="italic">Home from Home</span> (1939, as comedian Sandy Powell's wife), and No&euml;l Coward's wartime masterpiece <span class="italic">In which we Serve</span> (1942). Screen fame came to her in middle age, when she starred as London East End cleaner Ma Huggett in <span class="italic">Holiday Camp</span> (1947), featuring the fictional Huggett family enjoying a post-war leisure innovation. With Jack Warner as her screen husband, the film was so popular that Rank capitalized on its success by making the sequels <span class="italic">Here Come the Huggetts</span> (1948), <span class="italic">Vote for Huggett</span> (1949), and <span class="italic">The Huggetts Abroad</span> (1949). These portrayals of the &#145;common man&#146;&#151;and woman&#151;were panned by the critics but such was the public's love for the family that their adventures continued on BBC radio in the serial <span class="italic">Meet the Huggetts</span> (1953&#150;62).<br>
<br>Harrison was recognized as one of the greatest British film character actresses of the 1940s and 1950s, and made notable appearances in <span class="italic">Oliver Twist</span> (1948, as Mrs Sowerby), <span class="italic">Scrooge</span> (1951, with Alastair Sim), <span class="italic">The Pickwick Papers</span> (1952, as Miss Wardle), <span class="italic">Lilacs in the Spring</span> (1954, as Anna Neagle's dresser), <span class="italic">The Big Money</span> (1956, as Ian Carmichael's mother), and <span class="italic">Alive and Kicking</span> (1958, appearing with Sybil Thorndike and Estelle Winwood as three lively old ladies escaping from a home).<br>
<br>After acting in the films <span class="italic">On the Fiddle</span> (1961, as Stanley Holloway's wife) and <span class="italic">West 11</span> (1963, as Alfred Lynch's mother), Harrison found new fame on television, as the star of <span class="italic">Mrs Thursday</span> (1966&#150;7), a comedy-drama written specially for her by Ted Willis and running to two long series. She played a warm-hearted cockney charwoman, Alice Thursday, who inherits from her late employer &pound;10 million, a mansion, the controlling interest in a property empire, and a Rolls-Royce, while his four wives are left nothing. The programme was the most popular series of 1966 and toppled <span class="italic">Coronation Street</span> from the top of the television ratings week after week. Her other small-screen appearances included parts in BBC serializations of <span class="italic">Our Mutual Friend</span> and <span class="italic">Martin Chuzzlewit</span> (Charles Dickens was her favourite novelist). Her final screen appearance was in the Disney comedy <span class="italic">The London Connection</span> (1979).<br>
<br>Throughout her career Harrison knocked six years off her age, revealing her true age only with the approach of her hundredth birthday, in 1992. She died at her home, 30 Cottenham Park Road, Merton, London, on 7 December 1995. She was survived by a son and daughter, her husband and a son having predeceased her.<br>
