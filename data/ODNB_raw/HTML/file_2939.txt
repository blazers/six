<span class="headword">Boste,  John</span> <span class="st"> [St John Boste]</span>  (1544&#150;1594), <span class="occ">Roman Catholic priest and martyr</span>, was born at Wellyng Manor, Dufton, Westmorland, the younger of two sons of Nicholas Boste, of Wellyng Manor, and his wife, Janet Hutton, of Hutton Hall in Penrith. Boste went to Queen's College, Oxford, where he graduated BA on 9 July 1568, was appointed a taberdar on 29 January 1568, and proceeded MA on 18 June 1572. He was elected to a fellowship the same year (31 October 1572). In the winter of 1573&#150;4 he taught at Appleby grammar school, Westmorland. Boste received Church of England orders and subscribed to the royal supremacy. After becoming a Roman Catholic in 1576, presumably at Browne Hall, Suffolk, the house of Sir Thomas Cornwallis, he was expelled from his fellowship for &#145;ministerium abnegando&#146; (&#145;forsaking his ministry&#146;) and contradicting &#145;sanae et Christianae religioni&#146; (&#145;sound Christian doctrine&#146;; Pollen, 222; Queen's College, register G, fol. 35).<br>
<br>In 1580 Boste left England for the Low Countries. He was a tutor to Gerard Clibborn, with whom he arrived at the English College, then at Rheims, on 4 August 1580. Boste received minor orders in the winter of 1580, and was deaconed (21 February 1581) and priested (4 March 1581) at Ch&acirc;lons-sur-Marne. He was sent back to England soon after (11 April 1581) &#145;for avoidinge of daunger&#146;  (Pollen, 65) associated with the revocation of Englishmen studying abroad. He landed at Hartlepool and commenced his mission to the northern counties and Scotland. He was among the most sought-after priests in the north. Various failed attempts to capture him caused the earl of Huntingdon (lord president of the north) to search Kingston upon Hull for &#145;John Bost, alias Harckley&#146;  (Stanewell, 158).<br>
<br>Boste was eventually betrayed by Francis Ecclesfield, a renegade Catholic, in the house of William Claxton, at Waterhouses near Brancepeth, co. Durham, on 10 September 1593. Sent to Windsor on 2 October 1593, he was examined by Richard Topcliffe on behalf of the privy council a week later. In order to reveal his associates Boste was &#145;often most cruelly rack'd, insomuch so that he was afterward forced to go crooked upon a staff&#146;  (Challoner, 202). His torturer reported that &#145;since ther Honors knew the world, they never hearde a more resoluyt Traitor&#146;  (Pollen, 217). Boste was kept in prison until the summer of 1594 when he was sent back to Durham and tried together with another priest, John Ingram, and a Catholic layman, George Swallowfield. On 24 July 1594 he was accused of leaving and re-entering the country without permission. Later that day he was condemned and hanged, drawn, and quartered in Durham, the others two days later at Gateshead and Darlington.<br>
<br>An incident at Boste's trial speaks of his conviction and courage: Swallowfield, also a former Church of England clergyman, was about to recant his Catholic beliefs, when Boste urged him to stand firm. When Swallowfield asked for forgiveness for his wavering faith Boste gave absolution in open court. Boste was canonized by Pope Paul VI in 1970, and his two companions were beatified by Pope Pius XI in 1929.<br>
