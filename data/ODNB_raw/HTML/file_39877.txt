<span class="headword">Winner, Dame  Albertine Louisa</span>  (1907&#150;1988), <span class="occ">physician and medical administrator</span>, was born on 4 March 1907 in Coulsdon, Surrey, the only child of Isidore Winner (who had changed his name from Isidor Wiener on leaving the Netherlands some years previously), hide merchant, and his wife, Annie Stonex. She was brought up in London, which she always thought of as essentially composed of villages, and lived there all her life. She was educated at the Francis Holland School, Clarence Gate, and from there she went to University College, London, where she took a BSc with honours in physiology. She went on to study medicine at University College medical school, qualifying MB BS in 1933 and winning the gold medal. An outstanding physician, she also became MD (1934), MRCP (1935), and FRCP (1959).<br>
<br>In Winner's early career she worked with, and was much influenced by, Sir Thomas Lewis and Francis Walshe. From the latter she gained her interest and skill in neurology, which she maintained throughout her life, culminating in the work of St Christopher's Hospice with patients in the terminal stages of motor neurone disease. She was appointed physician to the Elizabeth Garrett Anderson Hospital and the Mothers' Hospital (1937) but in 1940 she joined the Royal Army Medical Corps, becoming a lieutenant-colonel and later consultant to the women's services (1946&#150;70).<br>
<br>Having acquired a taste for administration Winner decided to become a medical administrator and joined the Ministry of Health, where she worked from 1947 to 1967. She saw the introduction of the National Health Service in 1948 and, with her intense interest in each individual patient, was especially concerned with the development of services for the long-term sick and disabled. She was the first woman to become deputy chief medical officer of health (1962). She brought a very human touch to the detailed implementation of administrative developments. At this time she was also a visiting lecturer at the London School of Economics (1951&#150;63). Her interest was aroused both by the aims for the disabled of Group Captain Leonard Cheshire and Cicely Saunders's plans for a research and teaching hospice for the terminally ill. Her background support and her encouragement to potential supporters of the projected plans for St Christopher's Hospice in south-east London, the first in the modern movement, was invaluable. When she retired in 1967 she went on a clinical refresher course and became the first deputy medical director at St Christopher's. She was later chairman (1973) and finally president (1985). Her clinical and administrative skills did much to establish the ensuing hospice movement on a sound footing.<br>
<br>Winner became Linacre fellow at the Royal College of Physicians from 1967 to 1978, being responsible for postgraduate education in medicine. Her experience of administration was greatly valued as a vice-president of the Medical Defence Union and within the Disabled Living Foundation. She was president of the Medical Women's Federation in 1971&#150;2 and editor of its newsletter from 1973 to 1981. She was appointed OBE in 1945 and DBE in 1967.<br>
<br>Dame Albertine reckoned that she had enjoyed at least five careers, to all of which she brought her vital interest and concern for people, whether they were patients or fellow workers. She never married but had time for many friends, to whom she gave unstinting support in any need. In her early years she was a keen sportswoman and she drove a Jaguar. She had a knowledgeable love of opera and a capacity for adventurous travelling holidays. Among her varied acquisitions was a valuable collection of Japanese prints. With all this she had her lonely and vulnerable side, although she could appear formidable. Of average height and robust figure, she gave the impression of being larger than she really was but this was offset by her warm smile. From her integrity stemmed her capacity for the attentive and skilful kindness that constitutes the very best moral support, which she gave so generously. For many years she affirmed her agnosticism while holding a great regard for the faith of others, but in her later years she became committed to Judaism, the faith of her father. After a long illness she died on 13 May 1988 at Lancaster Lodge, a Wimbledon nursing home, where she was kindly and skilfully cared for, and where she was given a grand party for her eightieth birthday.<br>
