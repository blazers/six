<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Weldon,  George Anthony Thomas</span>  (1908&#150;1963), <span class="occ">conductor</span>, was born on 5 June 1908 at Herondean, Newfishbourne, Sussex, the second of the two children of Francis Harry Weldon (1869&#150;1920), army officer, and his wife, Eveleen (<i>d</i>. 1955), amateur artist and daughter of Thomas Fielden Campbell of Devonshire Place, London. Weldon entered Sherborne School in 1921. Exclusion from physical activities through a lower leg withered from birth allowed him to concentrate on his established instrument, the piano. He won the school's Halliday music prize in 1925 and, the following year, left for the Royal College of Music to study piano under Arthur Benjamin. Conducting, an extra with Billy Reed and Aylmer Buesst, became Weldon's main subject under Malcolm Sargent.<br>
<br>From 1930 until 1943 Weldon conducted the Tunbridge Wells Symphony Orchestra. The Choral Society elected to join the orchestra under his leadership in 1942, and under his baton the orchestra grew in numbers and reputation. Between 1931 and 1943 Weldon also conducted the Newbury Amateur Orchestral Union. In 1937 he was appointed deputy conductor of Hastings Municipal Orchestra. Rejected for military service after the outbreak of war, he subsequently worked for ENSA, the Entertainments National Service Association. From 1942 Weldon conducted the London Symphony Orchestra on tour and in London theatres and, after the war, abroad and in the Albert Hall. He was one of the five fiftieth jubilee concert conductors (1954) and made at least twenty-eight recordings with the orchestra.<br>
<br>One of eight selected candidates for the conductorship of the City of Birmingham Orchestra, Weldon gave his trial concert in 1943. In spite of appreciation from audiences and also from music critics, he was not offered a full contract until the following year. By then he had formed the city's first salaried orchestra, which gave its initial concert in September. Through ENSA contacts he obtained recording work for it and introduced a wide range of concerts. In addition, the orchestra undertook educational work and toured extensively, using Weldon's wartime venues. In 1947, following his conductorship of the BBC Symphony Orchestra, the City of Birmingham Orchestra gave at least twenty-one BBC broadcasts. In 1948, prior to the orchestra's Albert Hall d&eacute;but, he initiated its name change to the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra. However, its financial problems were aggravated when its committee responded to critics' demand for more modern and unfamiliar music. Weldon, believing programmes should be balanced, did not renew his contract after 1951, although he returned to conduct Birmingham's 1951 music festival and, as guest conductor, fill the town hall.<br>
<br>His busy schedule encouraged Weldon to freelance, but classical music was a shrinking market. In 1952, therefore, he accepted an invitation from his friend Sir John Barbirolli to become associate conductor of the Hall&eacute;, which was still expanding its audiences with Promenade and industrial concerts. During Barbirolli's illness in 1955 Weldon successfully conducted performances, including the Hall&eacute;'s first television appearance, at short notice. According to Barbirolli, Weldon had two great loves, music and very fast cars. The latter included two revolutionary Atalantas (in one of which, as &#145;Gat&#146; Weldon, he had won the 1937 Lewes speed trials).<br>
<br>A financially conscious music director, Weldon was an ingenious improviser, producing remarkable music under difficult conditions. He promoted the work of English musicians, including Elgar, Bliss, Bax, Vaughan Williams, Walton, and Sullivan (whose music he introduced to the concert platform). His recordings were mainly of popular classics, which offered an outlet for his flair and professionalism but failed to reveal his full potential. However, his arrangement of &#145;Suo gan&#146;, for a long time concluded every Hall&eacute; promenade season. Another work, &#145;Mice&#146;, composed for performance at Newbury (1937), also played in Birmingham, Manchester, and broadcast, now is lost. A popular figure abroad, Weldon notably conducted in Turkey, Yugoslavia, Germany, and Africa.<br>
<br>In 1963, suffering from asthma, and against medical advice, Weldon toured through Athens, Istanbul, Ankara, and on to Cape Town, for his third winter concert series there. He died of heart failure in the West County Hotel, Cape Town, during the night of 16/17 August. Following private Cape Town and London church ceremonies, his body was cremated and his ashes were scattered in his garden at 37 St John's Wood Road, London. Unmarried, he was survived by his sister, Sybil.<br>
