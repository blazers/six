<span class="headword">Knipe,  Thomas</span>  (1638/9&#150;1711), <span class="occ">headmaster</span>, was born in Middlesex, probably in Westminster, the son of Thomas Knipe, a clergyman, whose wife may have been called Anne. He was educated at Westminster School, admitted a scholar on Archbishop John Williams's foundation in 1652 and captain of the king's scholars in 1656. In 1657 he was elected to a scholarship at Christ Church, Oxford, but did not matriculate until 31 July 1658. He graduated BA on 22 February 1661 and proceeded MA on 1 December 1663. From 1661 Knipe was employed as usher at his old school. In 1663 he became second master there under Richard Busby, who is said to have appreciated Knipe's merits. Knipe married twice. His first wife was Anne, daughter of Devereux Wolseley, of Ravenstone, Staffordshire, and sister or sister-in-law of Thomas Sprat, dean of Westminster from 1683 and bishop of Rochester from 1684; she died on 24 August 1685. His second wife, whom he married in 1694 when she was aged thirty-five, was Alice Talbot (<i>d</i>. 1723), a widow, of St Margaret's parish. Knipe's son Richard, Busby's godson, became high bailiff of Westminster in 1692, and Knipe himself became head master by patent dated 6 April 1695, the day of Busby's death. He proceeded BD and DD the following 3 July. Although scarcely so formidable as his predecessor, he was respected by his pupils, who included two future prime ministers (Henry Pelham and his brother Thomas Pelham-Holles, duke of Newcastle) and two who almost held that office (William Pulteney and John Carteret, Lord Granville). A letter from Knipe to Lord Herbert of Cherbury, whose son Henry was at Westminster, and &#145;stood in the yard, crying, and blubbering, and roaring&#146;  (Warner, 1.164), shows that he was a strict disciplinarian, but he lacked the dynamism for the major building work then necessary.<br>
<br>Knipe's head mastership saw the revival of the Latin play after a lapse of some years. He also published Greek and Hebrew grammars for the use of Westminsters&#151;an edition of the Greek grammar of Apollodorus Atheniensis (1686) and <span class="italic">Hebraicae grammatiic&aelig; rudimenta</span> (1708). He had some part in, and is indeed said to have been the author of, <span class="italic">Grammatica Busbeiana auctior et emendatior</span> (1702). The <span class="italic">Graecae linguae dialecti in usum scholae Westmonasteriensis</span> (1706) of Michel Maittaire had a commendatory preface by Knipe and he was himself the dedicatee of <span class="italic">An Historical Account of the Heathen Gods and Heroes</span> (1710) by William King, an Old Westminster.<br>
<br>On 13 October 1707 Knipe was presented to a canonry of Westminster, and installed on 17 October. He died at Hampstead on 5 or 6 August 1711, in his seventy-third year. He was buried beside his first wife and several of his children on 9 August in the north cloister of Westminster Abbey; a monument was put up to him in the south aisle by his widow, Alice, who received by his will a &pound;100 annuity. This and other bequests&#151;&pound;50 annuities to his grandsons Richard and Thomas Knipe and &pound;1500 to his granddaughter Anne Knipe (for which his nephew Thomas Sprat was a trustee)&#151;reveal that he had accumulated a comfortable wealth.<br>
