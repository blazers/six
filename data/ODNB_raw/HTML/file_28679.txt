<span class="headword">Warburton,  Bartholomew Elliott George</span> <span class="st"> [<em>pseud. </em>Eliot Warburton]</span>  (1810&#150;1852), <span class="occ">writer</span>, eldest son of George Warburton of Aughrim, co. Galway, formerly inspector-general of constabulary in Ireland, who married, on 6 July 1806, Anna, daughter of Thomas Acton of Westaston, co. Wicklow, was born near Tullamore, King's county. After being educated by a private tutor at Wakefield, Yorkshire, he was admitted pensioner at Queens' College, Cambridge, on 8 December 1828, but migrated to Trinity College on 23 February 1830. He graduated BA on 22 May 1834 and proceeded MA in 1837. He was admitted to the Inner Temple in 1832 and to the King's Inn, Dublin, in 1833, and was called to the Irish bar in 1837, but abandoned the law to superintend his Irish estates, travel, and write, always under the name Eliot Warburton.<br>
<br>In 1843 Warburton made an extended tour through Syria, Palestine, and Egypt, describing his travels in the <span class="italic">Dublin University Magazine</span> (1843 and 1844) and in <span class="italic">The Crescent and the Cross, or, Romance and Realities of Eastern Travel</span> (2 vols., 1845), which reached seventeen editions. He married at St James's, Piccadilly, London, on 11 January 1848, Matilda Jane (1819/20&#150;1861), second daughter of the late Edward Grove of Shenstone Park, Staffordshire. The Warburtons led a roving life. Their eldest son was born on 20 October 1848, when they were at Lynmouth, Devon. In January 1849 Warburton was dwelling at a ch&acirc;teau in Switzerland. The summer of 1851 was passed on the Tweed and Yarrow. He was popular and enjoyed adventure.<br>
<br>After publishing <span class="italic">Zoe: an Episode in the Greek War</span> (1847), Warburton produced the <span class="italic">Memoirs of Prince Rupert and the Cavaliers</span> (3 vols., 1849; French trans., 1851), which was sympathetically treated, and a lifeless novel, <span class="italic">Reginald Hastings</span> (1850). In 1851 he edited the <span class="italic">Memoirs of Horace Walpole and his Contemporaries</span>, a compilation by Robert Folkestone Williams, and in 1852 published <span class="italic">Darien, or, The Merchant Prince</span> (3 vols.). Warburton could find no publisher and so abandoned a projected &#145;impartial&#146; history of Ireland. He collected the materials for a &#145;History of the poor&#146;, and his last visit to Ireland was to examine poverty in Dublin.<br>
<br>At the close of 1851 Warburton was deputed by the Atlantic and Pacific Junction Company to negotiate with the Indian peoples on the Isthmus of Darien on the northern coast of South America, and he embarked from Southampton on 2 January 1852, on board the West India mail steamer <i>Amazon</i>, with that object, and with the intention of exploring the district. The ship caught fire and Warburton was among those that perished off Land's End on 4 January. A window was erected to his memory in Iffley church, near Oxford. His widow in 1855 chiefly lived with her two little boys at Oxford or at Iffley. She married, on 6 August 1857, Henry Salusbury Milman, fellow of All Souls College, Oxford, and barrister, and died at Bevere Firs, near Worcester, on 23 October 1861, aged forty-one, having had three daughters with her second husband. Warburton's eldest sister, Sidney, was author of <span class="italic">Letters to my Unknown Friends</span> (1846). She died at Clifton, Bristol, on 18 June 1858.<br>
<br>One brother was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28671/', "George Drought Warburton")</script>. Another brother, <a name="cosubject_28679"></a><span class="headword">Thomas Acton Warburton</span>  (<em>c.</em>1813&#150;1894), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and writer</span>, was educated at Trinity College, Dublin (BA 1835, LLB and LLD 1852), and was called to the bar in 1840. He was ordained deacon in 1851 and priest in 1852. He was curate of Horspath, Oxford (1851&#150;3), and vicar of Iffley (1853&#150;76) and of St John the Evangelist, East Dulwich (1876&#150;88). His chief works were the poorly reviewed <span class="italic">Rollo and his Race, or, Footsteps of the Normans</span> (2 vols., 1848) and <span class="italic">The Equity Pleader's Manual</span> (1850). He died at Hastings Lodge, Dulwich Wood Park, Dulwich, London, on 22 August 1894, and was buried in Iffley churchyard. He left a widow, Emily Alicia.<br>
