<span class="headword">Mathew,  Mary</span>  (1724&#150;1777), <span class="occ">diarist</span>, was the eldest daughter of the six children of Theobald Mathew (<i>d</i>. 1745) and his wife, Catherine Shelley. The family were wealthy landowners with estates in co. Galway, co. Limerick, and co. Tipperary. Nothing is known of the early life of Mary Mathew. In adult life she lived in co. Dublin, and began to keep a diary from August 1772. It is for this diary, written during 1772 and 1773 and providing glimpses of her day-to-day life, that she is known.<br>
<br>Mary Mathew was wealthy in her own right, inheriting money from relatives and the rental of some property from her father. Her finances appear, however, to have been controlled by her brother Thomas, who succeeded to the family property on the death of his father in 1745. Mary refers to the difficulty of getting the money owed to her from Thomas, and her frustration at his delay in forwarding her moneys is evident from her diary.<br>
<br>Mary Mathew also kept a record of her expenditure between 1747 and 1777. There are references to payments made to servants, and her expenditure on clothing and household goods is also noted. The accounts, which appear in the back of the same manuscript as the diary, are most detailed after 1760. Mathew was on friendly terms with many of the titled families of the time who were regular visitors to her home in Portmarnock, co. Dublin. Her diary provides an insight into the work and wages of servants of the period, as well as an account of the life of a lady of leisure. She enjoyed an active social life, visiting the theatre and attending balls and assemblies. Like many diarists of the period she hoped that the discipline of keeping the diary would allow her to lead a more useful life or at least be conducive in making her use her time and energy in a more worthwhile manner. However, her diary shows her to have been unreflective, and she felt she gained little from the diary, concluding in August 1773: &#145;This day ends the year of this journal. I think my time past in so trifling a manner tis not worth recording so here I end&#146;  (<span class="italic">Diary</span>, 46). She died, unmarried, in Dublin in 1777.<br>
