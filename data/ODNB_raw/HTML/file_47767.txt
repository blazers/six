<span class="headword">Jellicoe <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Mullin]</span>,  Anne William</span>  (1823&#150;1880), <span class="occ">educationist</span>, born in Mountmellick, Queen's county, was the daughter of William Mullin (1796&#150;1826), a Quaker schoolmaster, and his wife, Margaret Thompson (1801&#150;1840). Little is known about her early life. Orphaned by the time she was seventeen years of age, she married John Jellicoe (<i>d</i>. 1862), a flour miller, in 1846 and they moved to Clara, King's county, in 1848. It was here, in the aftermath of the famine, that she began her first attempt to provide some kind of paid work for women. She set up an embroidery school for sewed muslin in 1850 and for lace crochet work in 1853, arranging for the export of the work to Glasgow. Both were gone by 1856, but the experience convinced her that women's work would remain limited and poorly paid until women were better educated. This conviction was reinforced when she moved to Dublin with her husband in 1858. Once again she came up against great poverty, this time in the Liberties area of the city. She helped revive Cole Alley infant school, run by the Quakers for poor children of all creeds, by going into homes and persuading mothers to send their children to this school.<br>
<br>When the Social Science Association met in Dublin for the first time in 1861, Anne Jellicoe was asked to prepare a paper on the working conditions of women factory workers in Dublin. Out of this came the first society in Ireland for the employment of women, which she founded with the help of Ada Barbara Corlett. Called the Irish Society for Promoting the Employment of Educated Women, after the London society of the same name, it soon became known as the Queen's Institute. Its committee of twenty-eight men from the professional and business life of the city and thirty-eight women, mostly titled ladies of the highest social standing, restricted the institute to working only with middle-class women. The assumption that these &#145;distressed gentlewomen&#146; were educated and therefore easily trained proved to be a major stumbling-block to the institute's progress. Its first phase, 1861&#150;6, was one of only limited success in the employment of women&#151;the most successful classes being those directly linked to jobs, such as the sewing-machine class, law writing, and the work of telegraph clerks. It was only during the institute's second stage, 1866&#150;80, when it became involved in girls' secondary and higher education, that it became much more successful. Ironically this occurred only after Anne Jellicoe had left the Queen's Institute in 1864 because of its refusal to start a training course for governesses.<br>
<br>Widowed in 1862, Anne Jellicoe continued her educational work. She decided to set up a training college for teachers, but was persuaded by Archbishop Chenevix Trench, the newly appointed archbishop of Dublin, to base her new college on the model of Queen's College, London. Alexandra College, Dublin, founded in 1866, became the first institution in Ireland to aspire to a university-type education for women over fifteen years of age. It had close links with the University of Dublin from the beginning, as the fellows and professors of Trinity College both taught and set the written examinations in Alexandra College. The range of subjects covered (theology, history, English language and literature, French, German, Italian, Latin, geography, arithmetic, algebra, geometry, natural science, mental and moral philosophy, music, and drawing) also raised it above the ordinary level of girls' second level schools in Ireland. In the period 1880&#150;1904 it prepared girls for the degrees of the Royal University of Ireland, and was also in the vanguard of the movement to persuade Trinity College, Dublin, to open its degrees to women, which finally occurred in 1904. Anne Jellicoe was lady superintendent of the college, remaining at its head until her death, judiciously guiding it through the early years, when acceptance of the need for women's higher education was by no means universal.<br>
<br>In April 1869 Anne Jellicoe founded the Governess Association of Ireland, to help &#145;promote the higher education of ladies as teachers&#146; by founding studentships and exhibitions in schools and colleges. While the association never reached its full potential due to lack of funds, it did further the higher education of women by persuading Trinity College, Dublin, to establish examinations for women, first held in 1870. It also brought Anne Jellicoe into contact with Maria Grey, who came to both Belfast and Dublin in January 1872 to spread her ideas about the high school movement for girls. Both women shared a passionate conviction in the right of women to higher education, but feared that their efforts to gain public sympathy and funds for this cause might be endangered by the emerging women's suffrage movement. As a result Anne Jellicoe remained outside any of the political delegations of the 1870s which lobbied for reform of girls' secondary and higher education, and did not take any active part in the campaign to win the suffrage for women.<br>
<br>The founding of Alexandra School in 1873 to act as a feeder to the college was another testimony to Anne Jellicoe's vision. She believed that the college could not survive financially without a school, and this was proved true in the 1880s, during a general depression, when the school's profits allowed the college to continue despite heavy losses. Although the Queen's Institute had both a school and college it did not survive beyond 1880, and this seems to have been due to its attempts to cater for every conceivable examination, while striving to retain its technical origins.<br>
<br>A very shy woman with a keen sense of humour, Anne Jellicoe once remarked that &#145;action is more my forte than speech-making&#146;  (A. Jellicoe, <span class="italic">A Few Words Addressed to the Students Representative Body, Alexandra College, 5 March 1878</span>, 1878). She ceased to be a member of the Society of Friends at about the time of her husband's death, becoming a member of the Church of Ireland. She loved music and art and was wont, as a friend remarked, on gala days, &#145;to go about, not in garb of drabs or greys, but with a brilliant red shawl which mostly trailed on the ground after her&#146;  (<span class="italic">Alexandra College Jubilee Record, 1866&#150;1916</span>, 1916, 11&#150;12). Anne Jellicoe died at her brother's house, 13 South Road, Birmingham, on 18 October 1880, and was buried on 21 October at the Friends' burial-ground, Rosenallis, Mountmellick.<br>
