<span class="headword">Barrington, Sir  Vincent Hunter Barrington  Kennett-</span>  (1844&#150;1903), <span class="occ">humanitarian worker and businessman</span>, was born on 3 September 1844 at Bagna di Lucca, Italy, the eldest son of Vincent Frederick Kennett (<i>b</i>. 1799), a retired captain of the East India Company army, and his wife, Arabella Henrietta Barrington 
    (formerly Hughes-Lee; <i>d</i>. 1884)
  , daughter and coheir of Sir Jonah Barrington. Kennett added his mother's surname to his own on her death in 1884. Kennett was educated at Eton College and won a scholarship to Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1863 to read mathematics. He graduated in 1867, took a law degree in 1868, moved to the inns of court, and was called to the bar in 1872.<br>
<br>In 1867 Kennett became associated with the British league of the order of the hospital of St John of Jerusalem. This in turn led to his involvement with the Society for Aiding and Ameliorating the Condition of the Sick and Wounded in Time of War (known as the National Aid Society and, later, as the Red Cross). The British National Aid Society, which was established in 1868, offered humanitarian assistance to both sides during the Franco-Prussian War of 1870&#150;71. Kennett became one of the convoy agents in charge of the distribution of funds and supplies and worked with the French republican armies in the Loire and later with the Prussians in Meaux. Following the armistice he became involved in further humanitarian work in eastern France. Kennett returned to England in April 1871, but went on to provide help during the Carlist War in Spain (1873&#150;5), the Serbo-Turkish War (1876&#150;7), and the Turko-Russian War (1877&#150;8). On 12 January 1878 he made a financially advantageous marriage to Alicia Georgette Sandeman, daughter of George Glas Sandeman, and a member of the Sandeman family of wine growers. Alicia Barrington was the author of <span class="italic">Bible History for Children</span> (1889). Kennett returned to Constantinople within a month of his wedding; the organizational role which he assumed during the conflict probably makes him one of the earliest instances of a &#145;professional&#146;, albeit unpaid, humanitarian administrator. After 1878 Kennett became involved in the St John Ambulance movement and served as an instructor.<br>
<br>Kennett was also a freelance business agent, serving on the commissions of universal exhibitions in Brussels, Melbourne, and Paris between 1876 and 1898. In 1883 he was elected to the London chamber of commerce, becoming its deputy chairman in 1889, and travelled to India on behalf of Edison Electrical Company. From 1883 he served on the Metropolitan Asylums Board. He worked with the Aid Society once again during the Sudan expedition and the Serbo-Bulgarian War in 1885. In the latter conflict he held a semi-official role, combining his humanitarian role with a diplomatic one. Kennett-Barrington was knighted in May 1886. He was an alderman of London county council in 1890&#150;91. Despite his work with the chamber of commerce and at the Metropolitan Asylums Board becoming more demanding over the years, Kennett-Barrington nevertheless helped while on business trips to establish Red Cross branches in Buenos Aires in 1892 and in Venezuela in 1895.<br>
<br>Kennett-Barrington was an active man who participated in many sports, including fishing, shooting, and ballooning. He died at his home, 57 Albert Hall Mansions, Knightsbridge, on 13 July 1903 as the result of injuries received in a ballooning accident. He was survived by his wife. Kennett-Barrington is an example of the first generation of humanitarian administrators who undertook vital field work for the Red Cross. His letters provide an important record of an often poorly documented area of history. He won the silver and bronze medals of the Royal Humane Society (1873, 1885) and published <span class="italic">River Pollution</span> (1883), <span class="italic">Hospital and Ambulance Organisation of the Metropolitan Asylums Board</span> (1893), <span class="italic">Floating Hospitals for Infectious Cases</span> (1883), and <span class="italic">Ambulance Organisation of the Metropolis during Epidemics</span> (1884).<br>
