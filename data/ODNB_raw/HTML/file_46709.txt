<span class="headword">William FitzEmpress</span>  (1136&#150;1164), <span class="occ">magnate</span>, was born at Argentan on 22 July 1136, the youngest of the three sons (his eldest brother became <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/12949/', "Henry II")</script>) of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18338/', "Matilda (1102&#150;1167), empress of Germany, countess of Anjou")</script>, and daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/12948/', "Henry I")</script>, and Geoffrey Plantagenet (1114&#150;1151), count of Anjou. Little is known of his youth, but he was mentioned in the <i>acta</i> of his parents from infancy onward, and he was frequently at the side of his eldest brother after the latter became king in 1154; one such occasion was the siege of Chinon in 1156. William was greatly enriched when Henry came to the throne. In the second year of the reign he received geld exemptions on more than 300 hides of land in nine counties, and by 1162 his lands exempted from geld had increased to more than 500 hides in fifteen counties. His English holdings, which made him one of the wealthiest men in the kingdom, were concentrated in eastern England, a region of royal strength under both Henry II and his predecessor Stephen, and included the manors of Maldon in Essex; Dartford, Hoo, and Shorne in Kent; Aylsham and Cawston in Norfolk; and Hintlesham in Suffolk. He was also vicomte of Dieppe in Normandy and held lands in that area.<br>
<br>In 1155 Henry II consulted his court about the possibility of conquering Ireland as an appanage for William. The plan was opposed by their mother, the empress, and Henry laid it aside. A later plan to provide for William was through a proposed marriage to Isabella, the widowed heir of William (III) de Warenne, earl of Surrey (<i>d</i>. 1148); she had previously been married to King Stephen's younger son, William, who died in 1159. Her marriage to William FitzEmpress would have brought him not only further lands but also a title to match his already considerable wealth. Archbishop Thomas Becket, however, objected to the match on the grounds of consanguinity, and the matter was not pressed. In 1164 Isabella married instead Hamelin of Anjou, an illegitimate brother of the king. William was said to be despondent at the loss of the earldom, seeking solace at Bec-Hellouin (a house much patronized by his mother) in 1163. He died shortly afterwards, on 30 January 1164, at Rouen, where he was buried in the cathedral. The thwarted marriage evidently rankled with at least one of his followers, Richard Brito (le Bret), who took part in the archbishop's murder in 1170; as he delivered the final blow, Richard cried, &#145;Take that, for the love of my lord William, the king's brother!&#146;  (<span class="italic">Materials</span>, 3.142).<br>
