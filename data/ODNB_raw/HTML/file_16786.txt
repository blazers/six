<span class="headword">Littleton,  James</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1668, <em>d.</em> 1723), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, was baptized on 29 October 1668, the fourth son of James Littleton of Lingfield, Surrey, and Susanna White (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Medlicot). He was the grandnephew of Sir Thomas Littleton, speaker of the House of Commons and treasurer of the navy, whom he succeeded to the estate of North Ockenden, Essex, in 1714. He became first lieutenant of the <i>Dreadnought</i> in the battle of La Hogue in May 1692. On 27 February 1693 he was promoted captain of the <i>Swift Prize</i> (24 guns); subsequently he commanded the <i>Dover</i> and the <i>Winchelsea</i>. In 1696 he commanded the <i>Portland</i> (48 guns) in the channel, and also escorted the annual convoy from Newfoundland to Cadiz and the Mediterranean; he returned to England in May 1697. For the rest of 1697 and throughout 1698 the <i>Portland</i> was employed on the home station.<br>
<br>In 1699 Littleton went out to the East Indies in the <i>Anglesea</i>, one of a small squadron under Commodore George Warren, which had been ordered to act against the pirates of Madagascar. Warren died in November, and the command passed to Littleton. Several of the pirate ships were destroyed and, after proclamations of pardon had broken up the other crews, Littleton returned to England. From 1702 to 1705 he commanded the <i>Medway</i> in the channel, and in January 1705 he was commodore of a small squadron which captured the <i>Auguste</i>, a large French privateer, when her consort, the <i>Jason</i>, commanded by the celebrated Ren&eacute; Duguay-Trouin, escaped with difficulty. In 1706 he commanded the <i>Cambridge</i> under Sir John Leake at the relief of Barcelona and the capture of Alicante, where he is said to have been landed in command of a battalion of seamen.<br>
<br>In 1709 Littleton was captain of the <i>Somerset</i> in the West Indies; and in July 1710 he was appointed commodore and commander-in-chief of the squadron going to Jamaica, with his broad pennant in the <i>Defence</i>. He arrived there in November, and in the following July put to sea on intelligence of a Spanish fleet of twelve large ships being assembled at Cartagena. He arrived on the coast of New Spain with five two-decked ships on 26 July, and drove five large vessels in under the guns of the castle of Boca-Chica, the entrance to the harbour of Cartagena. The next day, 27 July, four others were sighted and chased. At about 6 p.m. the headmost ships, <i>Salisbury</i> and <i>Salisbury Prize</i>, came up with the rearmost, which, after a sharp combat, struck flag on the approach of the <i>Defence</i>. The <i>Jersey</i> captured another; the other two escaped. Afterwards Littleton, with his squadron, cruised off Havana, in order to intercept Admiral Jean-Baptiste Du Casse, who was expected there. He then drew back to cover Jamaica on receiving intelligence that a fleet of eighteen French warships was gathering at Martinique, presumably for an attack on that island. The information proved to be false; but Du Casse, taking advantage of Littleton's absence, got into Havana.<br>
<br>In July 1712 Littleton was relieved by Sir Hovenden Walker and returned to England. In November 1714 he was appointed resident commissioner and commander-in-chief at Chatham, a post he held until 1722. On 1 February 1716 he was promoted rear-admiral of the red, and on 15 March 1717 vice-admiral of the blue, after which he served as second-in-command to Sir George Byng in the Baltic before returning home in June. In the spring of 1719 he was for a few weeks first captain to the earl of Berkeley, first lord of the Admiralty, specially authorized to fly the flag of lord high admiral.<br>
<br>Littleton married Jane, daughter of Richard Bunch MD; they had one son and two daughters. Elected MP for Weymouth in 1710, despite being in the Caribbean, he was unseated on petition both then and after the subsequent by-election in 1711. He was returned successfully at Weymouth in 1713, and served as a whig until 1715; after a break from parliament he had a brief term as MP for Queenborough, serving from 24 March 1722 until his death on 3 February 1723.<br>
