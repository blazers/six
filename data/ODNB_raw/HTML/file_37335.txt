<span class="headword">Curzon,  Nathaniel</span>, first Baron Scarsdale  (1726&#150;1804), <span class="occ">art collector</span>, was born on 23 December 1726 at Queen Square, Bloomsbury, London, the elder of the two surviving sons of Sir Nathaniel Curzon, fourth baronet (1675&#150;1758), MP and barrister of the Inner Temple, and his wife, Mary (<i>d</i>. 1776), the daughter of Sir Ralph Assheton, second baronet. He was educated at Westminster School, and while there, in 1742, led three other friends into carving their names on the back of the coronation chair. In 1745 he went up to Christ Church, Oxford, and in 1749 he was made DCL. He served as MP for Clitheroe from 1748 to 1754, when he replaced his father as MP for Derbyshire, a seat he retained until 1761. Following Oxford he made a brief tour through northern France and the Low Countries, but he does not seem to have visited Italy. In 1750 he married Lady Caroline (<i>d</i>. 1812), the eldest daughter of Charles Colyear, second earl of Portmore. They had five sons, three of whom predeceased their father, and two daughters. At Newmarket in 1751 Curzon and Lord March (William Douglas, later the notorious fourth duke of Queensberry) rode their horses, Silver Leg and Chance, against wagers of &pound;50 and &pound;100, of which Curzon won the second encounter.<br>
<br>It is for the splendid house and the surrounding park at Kedleston in Derbyshire, where there had been Curzons since the reign of Henry I, that Curzon will be especially remembered. When he succeeded as fifth baronet in 1758 he was already planning to demolish the existing Queen Anne house and build a great Palladian mansion, in which he brought together important features of a number of great buildings he had seen and admired. He wanted to follow the basic plan of Holkham Hall in Norfolk, which was based on Palladio's unbuilt Villa Mocenigo, illustrated in <span class="italic">Quattro libri</span>, and in December 1758 he invited Matthew Brettingham, the builder of Holkham, to make drawings. Work began in 1759, but in 1761 Robert Adam was appointed surveyor of the building, and it was he who designed the south front in 1765. The magnificent hall, lined with Corinthian columns, and the saloon, with a dome and central skylight imitating the Pantheon in Rome, which housed his sculpture collection, were the inspiration of Curzon himself. Adam did much of the interior decoration, including the mosaic ceiling in the library. Curzon built up a large art collection: some paintings he inherited, others he acquired&#151;among them twenty-nine pictures bought for him in Italy&#151;and he also commissioned new works from artists such as Nathaniel Hone. In the park he removed the formal rides, canals, and ponds of the 1720s and created a natural landscape. For the pleasure grounds Adam designed a magnificent bridge and several buildings, notably a gothic temple.<br>
<br>Curzon was elevated to the peerage as first Baron Scarsdale on 9 April 1761. Through John Leveson-Gower, first Earl Gower, he was appointed chairman of committees in the House of Lords, which took up much time between 1775 and 1789 but provided a regular income to help in completing the house.<br>
<br>Curzon died at Kedleston on 6 December 1804 and was succeeded in the barony by his eldest son, Nathaniel.<br>
