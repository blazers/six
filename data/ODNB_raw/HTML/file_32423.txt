<span class="headword">Clarke, Sir  Andrew</span>  (1824&#150;1902), <span class="occ">military engineer and colonial official</span>, was born on 27 July 1824 at Southsea, Hampshire, the eldest son of Lieutenant-Colonel Andrew Clarke KH (1793&#150;1847), governor of Western Australia (1846&#150;7), the descendant of a Scottish family who had settled in Ireland in the seventeenth century, and his wife, Frances, the daughter of Philip Lardner of Devonshire and the widow of the Revd Edward Jackson, a former chaplain with the East India Company. While his father was away on military duty abroad, Clarke was brought up by his grandfather and uncles at Belmont, near Lifford, co. Donegal, Ireland, but he later attended the King's School at Canterbury and Portora School, Enniskillen, before entering the Royal Military Academy at Woolwich in 1840. After graduating in 1844 he was commissioned second lieutenant on 18 June, and following a year of professional instruction at Chatham he was sent to Fermoy, co. Cork, to assist in the public works programme for famine relief. In 1846 he was nominated to serve on the Oregon boundary commission, but his father, then governor of Western Australia, persuaded him to go to Australia instead. He was promoted lieutenant on 1 April 1846, and sailed for Van Diemen's Land on 13 October that year in command of a detachment of sappers and miners with the new governor and a fellow engineer, Sir William Thomas Denison. They reached Hobart Town on 26 January 1847.<br>
<br>Clarke was employed superintending convict labour on public works and planning wharves for the capital, but in September, when Governor Sir George Grey of New Zealand asked for engineer officers for road building, Clarke was transferred there, where, in addition to his engineering work, he successfully conducted a peace mission to the Maori at the Bay of Islands. In 1849 he returned to Hobart as private secretary to Denison, and in 1851 was appointed a member of the legislative council and head of the mounted police. During the struggle over transportation between 1849 and 1852 he was helpful to the governor, with whom he occasionally went hunting and shooting, but in March 1853 he was glad to accept an invitation to the more responsible position of surveyor-general in Victoria with a seat in the legislative council and a salary of &pound;1200 a year. After arriving in Melbourne in May, he proceeded to reorganize his department and managed to persuade his reluctant colleagues to authorize the first electric telegraph line in the colony&#151;to the port at Williamstown. He travelled widely throughout the colony, planning routes for roads and possible railways; he extended the surveys and organized the sale of more than half a million acres, especially near the goldfields, so that the cultivated area doubled in twelve months. He encouraged the formation of rural roads boards after the central roads board was established in 1853, but more important for local government was the <span class="roman">Municipal Corporations Act</span>, which he drafted and which was passed in December 1854. This set up municipal districts in which all householders had a vote&#151;thus providing, as he said, &#145;the first instalment of self-government in the colony&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Argus</span>, 3 Nov 1854), though legislative council amendments confined them to the suburbs and small townships. The same year Clarke again displayed his liberalism when he drafted the bill for the colony's new democratic constitution, which came into force in 1856 after passing the imperial parliament.<br>
<br>This ended Clarke's existing appointment, but the provision of a civil pension of &pound;800 was a valuable addition to his army pay and allowed him to spend freely in winning the seat of South Melbourne as a Liberal at the 1856 elections. He joined the first cabinet as surveyor-general, and while in office he won assent to proposals for the government-controlled (though privately contracted) construction of a railway line to the Murray River. In March 1857 the ministry was defeated, but as a private member Clarke was able to support the enactment of full manhood suffrage for elections to the legislative assembly.<br>
<br>In March of the following year, after he had failed to form another ministry himself, Clarke was appointed permanent head of the lands and survey department, but by this time he was increasingly anxious to return to England. He had wanted to rejoin his regiment when the Crimean War broke out in 1854, he had been promoted first captain on 19 March 1857, and he hoped he might be appointed the first governor of Queensland when it became a separate colony. So in 1858 he planned to leave Victoria&#151;where he had become known as &#145;Spicy Andrew&#146;&#151;and after a farewell visit to Denison in Sydney and a banquet given by the freemasons, of which he was grand master, he sailed in August of that year.<br>
<br>Although <span class="italic">The Argus</span> acidly remarked that it was &#145;not apprehended that the colony will suffer any material loss or inconvenience&#146;  (11 Aug 1858), Clarke's career had not been without distinction. In Melbourne in 1853 he had initiated the Museum of Natural History, and for two years had controlled its expenditure on exhibits. In 1854 he had designed the building for Melbourne's first industrial exhibition. He held office in both the Philosophical Society of Victoria and the Victorian Institute for the Advancement of Science, and when they amalgamated to form the Philosophical Institute (later the Royal Society) of Victoria he was elected its first president, in July 1855.<br>
<br>In England in January 1859 Clarke was appointed to command the Royal Engineers at Colchester. While there he was commissioned to buy arms for Victoria and was able to prevent the British government fobbing off obsolete weapons on the colony. In 1862 he was transferred to Birmingham, where he helped to form a Colonial Emigration Society. Having been promoted major, in 1863 he was sent to the Gold Coast, where war had broken out. While there, despite suffering from fever himself, he filled various offices made vacant by sickness or death and even acted temporarily as chief justice; more importantly, he wrote a report which proved useful to Sir Garnet Wolseley's expedition in 1873. Back in London in 1864, he served temporarily as agent-general for Victoria before being appointed director of engineering works at the Admiralty. This appointment was renewed in 1869, by which time he had married, at St George's, Hanover Square, on 17 September 1867, Mary Margaret, the daughter of Charles William MacKillop of the Indian Civil Service. In his Admiralty post, to meet the needs of the new ironclads and much larger ships, he planned a floating dock for Bermuda, which was launched at Woolwich in September 1868, new docks at Cork and Malta, which were completed in February 1871, and large extensions to the docks at Chatham and Portsmouth, completed that August. In 1870, with the naval hydrographer, he reported on the improvements necessary to allow the larger ironclads to pass through the Suez Canal; he also recommended the purchase of the canal by an English company, but the government rejected this. Meanwhile he had been promoted lieutenant-colonel on 6 July 1867. He was made full colonel on 6 July 1872, and created a CB in 1869 and KCMG in April 1873.<br>
<br>Later in 1873 Clarke left the Admiralty to become governor of the Straits Settlements, which had been made a separate colony in 1867. He arrived at Singapore on 4 November 1873, and soon he succeeded in reducing the rampant piracy and imposing some control over the local Chinese secret societies. He was also successful in ensuring that the native sultans of Perak and Selangor were persuaded to accept British &#145;advisers&#146;, as was the practice in India, while at the same time cultivating the friendship of the neighbouring maharaja of Johore. He hoped to increase British influence in Siam and made two visits to the king, but apathy in London allowed the French to strengthen their position there. However, overall Clarke helped to maintain the peace and stability of the peninsula and pave the way for its future prosperity.<br>
<br>In 1875 Clarke moved again, to the council of the viceroy of India (Lord Northbrook), as head of the public works department. He reached Calcutta on 4 June, and was soon hoping to promote railway building and irrigation works. Unfortunately he was able to do little in that direction owing to the financial stringency caused by the famine of 1876&#150;8 and by the Anglo-Afghan wars conducted by Lord Lytton, the new viceroy. He failed to persuade the latter even of the need to build new frontier railways. He was appointed CIE in January 1877 and in February 1880 went home on leave, but his ship was wrecked off Otranto. Although Clarke returned to India with the new Liberal viceroy (Lord Ripon), his term of office expired almost immediately, and he reached England on his retirement on 23 July 1880.<br>
<br>Clarke then served as commandant of the School of Military Engineering at Chatham, but in June 1882 was appointed inspector-general of fortifications, with the temporary rank of major-general. In this post he strengthened the defences of Colombo and Singapore and successfully promoted a new type of torpedo used for coastal defence invented in Melbourne in 1874 by Louis Brennan. He also interested himself in dirigible balloons and submarines, though without success. In 1883 he organized a railway corps for the pending campaign in Egypt and in 1884 he served as a British representative on the international committee on the Suez Canal. The same year he urged the building of a railway from Suakin to Berber in the eastern Sudan, and pressed in vain for the use of this route for the relief of General Gordon in Khartoum. On 8 June 1885 Clarke was made a GCMG; the following year he retired, in accordance with army regulations on age, and was given the honorary rank of lieutenant-general.<br>
<br>At the 1886 election following the defeat of Gladstone's proposals for Irish home rule, Clarke stood, without success, as a Liberal candidate for Chatham, a defeat repeated in 1892. But he continued a busy man. In 1886 he again acted temporarily as agent-general of Victoria at the time of the dispute with France over her wish to annex the New Hebrides. He acted without pay in connection with the stability of the dam of the Vyrnwy waterworks, for which he received the freedom of the city of Liverpool. He became a director of Palmers shipbuilding company at Jarrow, of the Colonial Mutual Life Assurance Society, of the Maxim Nondenfelt Gun Company, and of the British North Borneo Company&#151;which named the Clarke province after him. He was chairman of the Delhi&#150;Umballa Railway Company. He was agent-general of Victoria again from 1891 to 1894 and from 1897 until his death, and was of great service to the colony in London during the banking and financial crisis which climaxed in 1893. In 1899 he was one of the Australian representatives at the International Commercial Congress in Philadelphia and on the Pacific Telegraph Cable Company board, and was interested in an &#145;all-red&#146; line of telegraph to connect scattered parts of the British empire without entering foreign territory. On 8 January 1902 he was appointed colonel commandant of the corps of Royal Engineers, but he died eleven weeks later, at his home, 31 Portland Place, London, on 29 March. He was buried on 3 April in the Locksbrook cemetery at Bath, alongside his wife, who had predeceased him on 8 November 1895; he was survived by their only child, Elinor Mary de Winton, who had married the naval officer Murray Frazer Sueter.<br>
<br>Bulky and ruggedly handsome, Clarke was tactful, genial, energetic, hasty but kind, and universally popular. Not deeply religious, he was a humanitarian scientist who gave distinguished service in all his varied appointments. He was one of the empire's most deserving public servants, and his work at Singapore placed him in the front rank of its colonial governors.<br>
