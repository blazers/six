<span class="headword">Warner,  Thomas</span> <span class="st"> [<em>called </em>Indian Warner]</span>  (<em>c.</em>1630&#150;1674), <span class="occ">colonial governor</span>, was the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28768/', "Sir Thomas Warner (c.1580&#150;1649)")</script>, colonial governor, and a Carib woman whose name is unknown but who lived from about 1600 to 1700. Warner was raised in his father's household until Sir Thomas's death in 1649, when his stepmother began treating him as a slave. Warner fled St Christopher for Dominica and soon assumed a leading role among that island's Carib settlements. Warner's ability to act as a mediator made him an important figure in England's Caribbean policy. In 1664 he was made governor of Dominica by Francis, Lord Willoughby of Parham. In this position Warner was able to soothe French fears of an English settlement on the island even as he held the title of British governor. During the Second Anglo-Dutch War, however, Warner was imprisoned by the French for two years and freed only after the personal intervention of William, Lord Willoughby, in 1668. Soon after gaining his freedom, Warner negotiated a peace between the English and the Caribs of Dominica, St Vincent, and St Lucia, and was reappointed governor of Dominica by Willoughby.<br>
<br>In retrospect it is impossible to say whether Warner's primary loyalty lay with the English or the Caribs, but English colonists on Antigua were certain that Warner was behind repeated Carib attacks. In December 1674 Antigua's governor, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28764/', "Colonel Philip Warner")</script> (another son of Sir Thomas and therefore Thomas Warner's half-brother), led a controversial expedition against the Indians in Dominica, in the course of which Thomas Warner was killed under mysterious circumstances. An eyewitness accused Philip of luring his brother and many of his Indian allies on board his sloop and massacring them. Other contemporaries defended Philip by claiming that Thomas died in combat, but the circumstances of this battle are itself unclear. Philip's case was a <i>cause c&eacute;l&egrave;bre</i>: he was accused of murder, taken to England and imprisoned in the Tower, then sent to Barbados, where he was tried and finally cleared of all charges.<br>
