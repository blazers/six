</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Badel,  Alan Fernand</span>  (1923&#150;1982), <span class="occ">actor and theatre producer</span>, was born in Rusholme, Manchester, on 11 September 1923, the son of Auguste Firman Joseph Badel (1891&#150;1962), a shipping clerk and office manager of French birth, and his wife of Huguenot descent, Elizabeth Olive Till (<i>d</i>. 1973). He had two brothers and a sister, as well as numerous cousins in Languedoc, where he spent holidays in his youth. Educated at Burnage high school, he gave his first public performance in a school production of James Bridie's <span class="italic">The Anatomist</span> in 1938, and in the following year, when barely sixteen, he entered the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA). There he soon distinguished himself, making his professional d&eacute;but in 1940, while still a student, as George in Bridie's &#145;moral play&#146; <span class="italic">The Black Eye</span> at the Oxford Repertory Theatre, and winning the coveted Bancroft gold medal in 1941. On leaving RADA he had time for two engagements before his call-up for military service, as Pierrot in a revival at the Mercury Theatre in August 1941 of the mime-play <span class="italic">L'enfant prodigue</span> and as Lennox and First Murderer in <span class="italic">Macbeth</span> at the Piccadilly in July 1942. In the same year he married the actress (Marie) Yvonne Owen (1923&#150;1990), who had been a contemporary at RADA and Pierrette to his Pierrot: their daughter Sarah (<i>b</i>. 1943) also became a successful actress.<br>
<br>Enlisted in the 6th airborne division, Badel served as a paratrooper until the Second World War's end, rising to the rank of sergeant and being wounded in action following the Normandy landings. Later he was attached to the army play unit, for which he played Othello to military audiences in Egypt and the Middle East. Before returning to the West End he was at the Farnham Repertory Theatre, where he took the lead in Emlyn Williams's <span class="italic">The Corn is Green</span> (April 1947), and was then cast as Stevie, the young resistance worker in No&euml;l Coward's <span class="italic">Peace in our Time</span> (Lyric, Hammersmith, July 1947) and as Sandman in Peter Ustinov's <span class="italic">Frenzy</span> (St Martin's, March 1948). From February to July 1949 he was a member of the Birmingham Repertory company, playing the title role in Michael Brown's <span class="italic">The Modern Everyman</span>, the Fool in Henri Gh&eacute;on's <span class="italic">The Marvellous History of St Bernard</span>, the Scoundrel in Rodney Ackland's version of Aleksandr Nikolaevich Ostrovsky's <span class="italic">The Diary of a Scoundrel</span>, and a demonically driven Richard III, a performance which established his credentials as a Shakespearian actor.<br>
<br>Moving to the Stratford Memorial Theatre to play Ratty in a Christmas production of A. A. Milne's <span class="italic">Toad of Toad Hall</span>, Badel remained there for the 1950 festival season, appearing as Claudio in <span class="italic">Measure for Measure</span>, the Lord Chamberlain in <span class="italic">Henry VIII</span>, and Octavius in <span class="italic">Julius Caesar</span>; in <span class="italic">King Lear</span> he was much admired as a whey-faced, bird-like Fool, fearfully clutching a child's broken toy for a bauble. After playing the Prince in Nicholas Gray's <span class="italic">Beauty and the Beast</span> at the Westminster in December, he returned to Stratford in 1951 as Poins and Justice Shallow in <span class="italic">Henry IV, Parts 1 and 2</span>, the Dauphin in <span class="italic">Henry V</span>, and in <span class="italic">The Tempest</span> an Ariel at once lithe and statuesque, accounted by <span class="italic">The Times</span> &#145;a performance of flawless beauty&#146;  (27 June 1951). Engagements at the Old Vic in successive seasons broadened his Shakespearian range to include a fusspot Peter Quince in 1951&#150;2 and in 1952&#150;3 a lovesick Romeo, an unashamedly adolescent interpretation which, opposite Claire Bloom's touchingly childlike Juliet, thrilled its audiences, if not many critics, and served twice to prolong the play's run. After a brief appearance as Eilert Lovborg in Ibsen's <span class="italic">Hedda Gabler</span> at the Lyric, Hammersmith, in September 1954, he rejoined Anthony Quayle's Stratford company and opened the 1956 season with Hamlet, followed by Berowne in <span class="italic">Love's Labour's Lost</span> and, most tellingly, an affectedly Italianate Lucio in <span class="italic">Measure for Measure</span>.<br>
<br>The year 1957 witnessed a tentative reorientation of Badel's career. Having already directed the British premi&egrave;re of Fritz Hochw&auml;lder's <span class="italic">The Public Prosecutor</span> (in which he also played the eponymous revolutionary magistrate) at the Arts Theatre in October, he formed a partnership with Viscount Furness, Furndel Productions Ltd, dedicated to presenting adventurous work unlikely to attract commercial managements. They gave the first British performance of an adaptation from James Joyce entitled <span class="italic">Ulysses in Nighttown</span> (Arts Theatre, May 1959), in which Badel was a haunting Stephen Dedalus, and mounted three further new plays at the Westminster: James Saunders's <span class="italic">The Ark</span> (September 1959), Gore Vidal's <span class="italic">Visit to a Small Planet</span> (February 1960), and Joseph Carole's <span class="italic">Roger the Sixth</span> (May 1960). Following the demise of Furndel, a progressive deafness, the legacy of wartime combat, exacerbated the strain of stage performance and impelled Badel increasingly towards cinema, television, and radio, though his intermittent theatrical appearances were no less accomplished: as Hero, the dissolute, self-loathing seducer of Jean Anouilh's <span class="italic">The Rehearsal</span> (Globe, April 1961), as a wittily polished John Tanner in George Bernard Shaw's <span class="italic">Man and Superman</span> (New Arts, November 1965), and as a perfectly cast, exhilaratingly romantic Edmund Kean in Jean-Paul Sartre's <span class="italic">Kean</span>; the latter he enterprisingly played in repertory with one of the great tragedian's most famous roles, Othello, though, unlike Kean, without &#145;blacking up&#146; (Oxford Playhouse, September&#150;October 1970). His last performance was a reprise of a favourite role, Richard III, at St George's Theatre, Islington, in summer 1976. Offstage, unlike many actors, he remained happily married, and was an enthusiastic gardener and handyman, having mastered such unactorly skills as carpentry and bricklaying.<br>
<br>Despite making his screen d&eacute;but in <span class="italic">The Young Mr Pitt</span> as early as 1942, Badel was rarely well served by his subsequent films. The two starring roles which his theatrical reputation earned him in Hollywood, as John the Baptist in <span class="italic">Salome</span> (1953) and Richard Wagner in <span class="italic">Magic Fire</span> (1954), suffered from indifferent accompaniment, and thereafter he was restricted to prominent, but largely two-dimensional character parts, the most interesting of which were the rugby-promoting north-country industrialist in <span class="italic">This Sporting Life</span> (1963), the megalomaniac oil magnate in <span class="italic">Arabesque</span> (1966), the minister in <span class="italic">The Day of the Jackal</span> (1973), the sinister Dominican cardinal in <span class="italic">Luther</span> (1976), the KGB colonel in <span class="italic">Telefon</span> (1977), and the traitorous British naval officer in <span class="italic">The Riddle of the Sands</span> (1979). Television provided more rewarding opportunities, notably as Rawdon Crawley in <span class="italic">Vanity Fair</span> (1956), Mr Darcy in <span class="italic">Pride and Prejudice</span> (1957), Don Juan in Shaw's <span class="italic">Don Juan in Hell</span> (1962), the Cardinal in Bridget Boland's <span class="italic">The Prisoner</span> (1963), the Husband in Harold Pinter's <span class="italic">The Lover</span> (1963), Edmond Dant&egrave;s in <span class="italic">The Count of Monte Cristo</span> (1964), Tom Simkins in Stan Barstow's <span class="italic">A Raging Calm</span> (1974), Edmund Gosse in Dennis Potter's <span class="italic">Where Adam Stood</span> (1976), Svengali in <span class="italic">Trilby</span> (1976), and Count Fosco in <span class="italic">The Woman in White</span> (1982), made in the last months of his life and screened posthumously. He died suddenly of a heart attack at his home, 1A St Martin's Square, Chichester, Sussex, on 19 March 1982.<br>
<br>Although the dazzling youthful promise, which had captivated no less a critic than Harold Hobson, was never entirely fulfilled, Badel remained an actor of magnetic stage presence and mesmerizing vocal command, from the suave to the spitfire, the elegiac to the barnstormingly heroic. Perceived as redolent of an outmoded romantic tradition, and thereby limiting the parts offered to him, his style of performance was none the less informed by an acute intelligence and an ironic view of character and situation, effectively undercutting all inflated emotion with a modern sensibility. Deplorably few openings came his way in work by post-war British playwrights, but arguably more regrettable still is that he never became a member of either the Royal Shakespeare Company or the National Theatre, where his distinctive gifts would have had greater scope to confront the classic roles of an international repertory.<br>
