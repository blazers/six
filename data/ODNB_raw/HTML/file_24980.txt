<span class="headword">Seagar,  John</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1656), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, was a member of the family of Seagar or Segar of Broadclyst, Devon. He attended Wadham College, Oxford, and was listed on 10 July 1613 as a pupil of a Devon fellow, Matthew Osborne (<i>d</i>. 1661). He matriculated on 3 June 1614 and graduated BA as of Wadham on 23 May 1617, proceeding MA from St Mary Hall on 28 June 1620. By 1628 Seagar had returned to Devon, acquiring the vicarage of Lamerton in that year; on 16 July 1631, following the death of Robert Stennings, he was instituted to the rectory of Broadclyst on the presentation of a kinsman, William Seagar.<br>
<br>During the civil wars, as Seagar reminded his parishioners, there were &#145;three years of which time I was forced by the violence of soldiers to absent my self from you&#146;  (Seagar, preface). But it was as minister of Broadclyst that in June 1648 he signed <span class="italic">The Joint-Testimonie of the Ministers of Devon</span>, one of a series of tracts issued about that time in which the authors urged the imposition of a presbyterian system and protested that &#145;a toleration of all blasphemous heresies by a law, is diametrically opposed to the grace and duty of zeal&#146;  (<span class="italic">Joint-Testimonie</span>, 32). A few months later, on 19 January 1650, <span class="italic">A Discoverie of the World to Come According to the Scriptures</span> (1650) was licensed by Joseph Caryl and signed by Seagar, again as minister of Broadclyst, recalling in the preface the eighteen years of his service in that cure. He published this work &#145;being desirous before my death to leave among you some token and testimonie of my love towards you&#146; and he expected that the second coming of Christ in the flesh was also imminent. Seagar was not quite right in either prediction. He survived until 13 April 1656 and was buried at Pitminster, Somerset. His will, which left 719 acres of land in co. Tipperary to his nephews William and George Seagar, significant sums to other kin, and &pound;5 to the poor of Broadclyst, was proved by his widow, Dorothie, on 14 May.<br>
