<span class="headword">Hill, Sir  (George) Rowland</span>  (1855&#150;1928), <span class="occ">rugby administrator</span>, was born on 21 January 1855 at Queen's House, Greenwich, London, one of three children of Irish protestant parents. His father, the Revd James Hill, was headmaster of the upper school of the Royal Hospital school, Greenwich.<br>
<br>Hill attended Christ's Hospital school, Newgate Street, but left at the age of fifteen to take up employment with the Telegraph Construction and Maintenance Company. He worked aboard the famous <i>Great Eastern</i> steamship, helping to lay one of the Atlantic cables. He joined the civil service and became record keeper in the principal probate registry, Somerset House. He was a member of the London county council, as was his unmarried sister, and he was also a JP; for over thirty years from 1887, he was chairman of Greenwich Conservative Association and at one stage he was also the association's president. He resisted, however, the blandishments of friends who wanted him to stand for parliament.<br>
<br>Hill is best-known for his services to rugby football. He was involved in running the Queen's House club, founded by his brother Colonel E. Cleary Hill, which was one of the founder members, in 1871, of the Rugby Football Union (RFU). He gave up playing after the Queen's House club disbanded, but took a leading role in obtaining the Rectory Field for the Blackheath club, of which he was one of the original directors. He was elected honorary secretary of the RFU in 1881. He was the last holder of this particular office, being succeeded in 1904, after twenty-three years' service, by a paid secretary. He was elected the eighteenth president in 1904&#150;5 without an intervening period as vice-president, was re-elected in 1905&#150;6, and then elected for a further year in 1906&#150;7. He was the first person to be knighted&#151;in 1926&#151;for his services to the game, which covered a period of over thirty-five years. In demand as a referee, he was a member of the international rugby football board for twenty-eight years from 1890 to 1928.<br>
<br>Hill is remembered above all for his defence of amateurism, for he believed incipient professionalism in rugby union football to be an evil likely to lead to violent and dangerous play. His obituary in <span class="italic">The Times</span> described him as &#145;an amateur of amateurs and a Tory of Tories&#146;: when he resigned from the RFU secretaryship in 1904 he would accept &#145;neither bounty nor reward&#146;. He opposed the Yorkshire clubs' attempts to legalize &#145;broken time&#146; payments in 1893, an action which led to the breakaway in 1895 of the Northern Union, later to become the Rugby League. Hill was active in steering through changes in the RFU constitution to enshrine the amateur principle and to frame rules designed to expunge from the game all forms of monetary consideration beyond the reimbursement of travelling expenses. The years following the breakaway of the Northern Union were some of the most difficult in the history of the union game and Hill, among others, is credited with guiding the game during that period towards renewed success. In 1893, 481 clubs were affiliated to the RFU; ten years later that number had dropped to 244, but by 1911&#150;12 membership had recovered to 319.<br>
<br>Hill, who never married, died at the Seamen's Hospital, Greenwich, on 25 April 1928 and was buried five days later in the Royal Hospital cemetery, Woolwich Road. On 5 October 1929, at Twickenham, the headquarters of the English game, the president of the RFU unveiled in his honour the Rowland Hill memorial gate and bronze plaque. The special commemorative game, played at Twickenham between the combined sides of England&#150;Wales and Scotland&#150;Ireland, and refereed by a Frenchman, attracted 25,000 spectators: the large crowds were considered the best epitaph to Hill and the other stalwarts who had fought to save the game from professionalism.<br>
