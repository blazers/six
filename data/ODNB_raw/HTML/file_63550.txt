<span class="headword">Radhakanta Sarman</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1803), <span class="occ">pandit</span>, was born in the early eighteenth century in a Bengali Brahman family of modest means. His father died at the age of 100, his mother at eighty on the funeral pyre of her husband. Radhakanta received a traditional Sanskrit education as a student of the famed Jagannatha Tarkapancanana, who conferred upon him the title Tarkavagisa (&#145;master of dialectics&#146;). His first apparent work was an undated <span class="italic">Vastutattva</span>, a Vaisnava text part of which was already lost by 1805. Although he may have been first patronized by traditional rulers such as the raja of Krishnagar, as his teacher and his father were, his career flourished under new forms of patronage in the new town of Calcutta. Along with Jagannatha and others, he was patronized by, and helped legitimize, the <i>nouveau riche</i> friend of the British, Maharaja Nabakrishna (Nobkissen) of Sobha Bazar, Calcutta, who gave him a grant of land and had the Mughal emperor confer upon him the title panditapradhana (&#145;foremost among pandits&#146;).<br>
<br>Radhakanta became involved with the British in 1783 when, at the request of Governor-General Warren Hastings, he composed and supervised a Persian translation of the <span class="italic">Puranarthaprakasa</span>, a digest of Indian antiquities  (BL, Or. MS 1124; Add. MS 5655) which was Sir William Jones's primary source on ancient Indian chronology. An English translation by N. B. Halhed was published in 1809  (Hindley, 109&#150;17). Although he accepted a traditional reward of land, Radhakanta declined an offer to join the civil service as a pandit assistant to the supreme court in 1785. He personally guided John Shore in collecting Persian translations of Sanskrit texts in 1783&#150;5, and again after Shore's return to India in 1787, and, in financial straits, became Jones's primary mentor in Sanskrit literature and antiquities. He first made Jones aware of Sanskrit theatre and pointed to <span class="italic">Sakuntala</span>, which Jones translated in 1789, as the best play. Among other contributions to Jones's enquiries, he interpreted the inscriptions on the Delhi-Topra pillar which Jones presented to the Asiatic Society, and was his primary source of information on Indian chess. In 1788 he accepted becoming a household pandit to Krishna Kanta Nandy (Cantoo Babu), Hastings's erstwhile banian, and formal employment with the British regime when Jones chose him as &#145;a Brahmen of distinguished abilities, and, highly revered by the Hindus in Bengal for his erudition and virtue&#146; to direct the project which he viewed as his foremost legacy, a digest of Hindu law on the model of Justinian's pandects  (<span class="italic">Letters of Sir William Jones</span>, 802). Although his teacher, the venerable Jagannatha, was also recruited and made the eponymous author of the <span class="italic">Vivadabhangarnava</span>, Radhakanta effectively headed the group of pandits who worked on the project for the law of Bengal, which was still incomplete at Jones's death in March 1794, while Sarvoru Tiwari, as the lone pandit for Bihar, produced the <span class="italic">Vivadasararnava</span> (1789). All the while, Radhakanta and Sarvoru were recurrently called upon to give opinions on Hindu law for the superior court, the <i>sadr diwani adalat</i>, when the pandit assistants to the court rendered contradictory opinions or were distrusted, which was increasingly the case. This culminated in their formal appointment in 1794 when Governor-General Sir John Shore and the council wished &#145;to render the digest the book of authority for determining legal questions and consequently to attain the desirable object of introducing uniformity in the Decisions of the Court&#146;  (BL OIOC, P/28/15, 10 Oct 1794, civil nos. 15&#150;16). Although &#145;old and infirm&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters of Sir William Jones</span>, 928), Radhakanta was concurrently retained to supervise the preparation, for the use of the court, of a copy of the digest which, in Henry Thomas Colebrooke's translation (1797&#150;8), became the standard source for administering law to Hindus in Bengal. Radhakanta died, still in British employ, on 8 March 1803. Pursuing what had become a family tradition of British employment, his son Srikanta sought in vain to succeed him in his position with the <i>sadr</i> court; Ghanasyama, another pandit who had worked on the law digest and a grandson of Radhakanta's teacher Jagannatha, was appointed his successor.<br>
