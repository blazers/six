<span class="headword">Phillips,  Charles William</span>  (1901&#150;1985), <span class="occ">archaeologist and topographer</span>, was born at 114 Alexandra Road, Wimbledon, Surrey, on 24 April 1901, the son of Harold William Phillips, a corn merchant, and his wife, Mary Elizabeth, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Williams. After the suicide of his father in 1907, following business problems, his mother supported Charles and his younger brother and sister by managing a dairy. His father had been a freemason and, after spending brief periods at Henley grammar school and Littlehampton commercial school, help from the masons enabled him to attend the Royal Masonic School at Bushey, Hertfordshire, and then Selwyn College, Cambridge, which he entered with an exhibition in history in 1919. He was awarded the Searle prize and a history prize by the college and took a first in history in part one of the tripos (1921) and a second class (division one) in part two (1922). Also in 1922 he was awarded a third class in law. After graduating he continued to reside in Cambridge as a private coach and college supervisor in history.<br>
<br>In 1929 Phillips was appointed librarian of Selwyn College and was elected to a research fellowship in 1933. He remained librarian until 1945 and a fellow until 1947. Although he taught undergraduates reading history, his main contribution to the college was rehousing, reordering, and cataloguing the library after its move in 1929 from temporary quarters to the War Memorial Building. The work also involved restoring many of the older volumes. In a small community of only eleven fellows Phillips stood out as a large and imposing man whose trenchant views on many subjects were always expressed with confidence. He had a remarkable gift of illuminating an account of mundane incidents by the use of an unexpected but entirely apposite word. He was a raconteur of an unusual kind. On Saturday evenings in term he presented monologues about events and trends in the world and in Cambridge. These pieces, which became known as his &#145;Phillipics&#146;, were clad in the most sombre shades, not least as war approached.<br>
<br>From his Cambridge base Phillips made major contributions to the archaeology of Lincolnshire and East Anglia. His work in Lincolnshire between 1932 and 1936 was particularly formative and has retained its significance to the present day. Two summative papers entitled &#145;The present state of archaeology in Lincolnshire&#146; (1933, 1934) anticipated the record-gathering of the 1970s and 1980s, and provided useful training for Phillips's later career at the Ordnance Survey. His activity also included original fieldwork and excavation, notably on neolithic burial monuments. He surveyed a number of long barrows for the first time and excavated one of these, at Giant's Hills, Skendlebury (Lincolnshire). He also began his long interest in the fenland of East Anglia and was an original member of the Fenland Research Committee, founded in 1935. This organization was not able to make much impact before the outbreak of war in 1939, but an important foundation was laid for future work.<br>
<br>Phillips's flair for administration also emerged before the Second World War. Up to the 1930s prehistoric archaeology was not specifically represented by any national body. In collaboration with J. G. D. Clark, Phillips greatly expanded the East Anglian Prehistoric Society, an organization which still occupies the premier position in its field.<br>
<br>One single enterprise in Phillips's long career turned out to be of signal importance in British archaeology. The owner of a group of barrow mounds at Sutton Hoo, near Woodbridge, Suffolk, Edith May Pretty, began to investigate some of the monuments in summer 1938, assisted by Guy Maynard and Basil Brown. In May 1939 excavation began on the largest and most elongated barrow in the group. It quickly became clear that the mound had been erected over a wooden ship, within which had been placed one of the most magnificently furnished funerary deposits of early medieval Europe. Professional support was obviously called for, and Phillips was called in to supervise and co-ordinate the work of recovery on 10 July 1939, after discussions between the British Museum and the office of works. A team of experienced excavators was assembled under Phillips's direction, among them O. G. S. Crawford, Stuart Piggott, and W. F. Grimes. Excavation continued until late August against a background of gathering war and ended only nine days before its declaration on 3 September.<br>
<br>The increasing haste with which the investigation had to be conducted was far from ideal, but it is a measure of the expertise and organization of Phillips's team that the great bulk of the contents of the ship burial was recovered and the context of the monument firmly established. For the first time the burial place of an Anglo-Saxon king had been identified and his grave-goods made available for study. The outbreak of war, however, meant that the Sutton Hoo treasure was packed away and consigned to a disused section of the London Underground. After 1945 the treasure was deposited in the collections of the British Museum and was fully published between 1975 and 1983. The success of this very taxing excavation owed a great deal to Phillips's organizational skills. He was himself a careful but not massively experienced excavator. His great achievement was to keep together an effective team in trying circumstances. Although he played no further part in the study of the site and the treasure, his records of the work in 1939 were of immense value to later investigators.<br>
<br>In 1940 Phillips joined the RAF volunteer reserve as a flight lieutenant conducting duties in the photographic interpretation centre, mainly in producing gazetteers of maps of Europe. He married on 3 July 1940 <a href="#cosubject_65765">Margaret Mann [<i>see below</i>]</a> of Newnham College, Cambridge, with whom he had a son and a daughter. In 1945 he returned to Cambridge but in 1946 he was appointed archaeology officer at the Ordnance Survey in succession to O. G. S. Crawford, a post for which he was superbly qualified.<br>
<br>Crawford had firmly established archaeology as a central concern of the Ordnance Survey after the First World War, and from taking up the position at the beginning of 1947 until his retirement in 1965 Phillips greatly developed the division, issuing professional papers which provided a solid basis for the development of regional strategies for studying the past. He continued and expanded the policy of producing period maps which recorded and illustrated major phases of British prehistory and early history. The best of these were the maps relating to the southern Iron Age, Roman Britain, the dark ages, and Britain before the Norman conquest. These were works of high scholarship and excellent cartography, matched in no other country at the time. In 1967 Phillips was awarded the Victoria gold medal of the Royal Geographical Society for services to archaeological and historical topography.<br>
<br>Phillips continued to work after retirement, not least in supporting research in the East Anglian fenland. He died at the West Middlesex Hospital, Isleworth, on 23 September 1985. His memoirs of his archaeological career were published posthumously. Phillips's wife, <a name="cosubject_65765"></a><span class="headword">Margaret  Mann Phillips</span>  (1906&#150;1987), <span class="occ">Renaissance scholar and translator</span>, was born at Kimberworth, Yorkshire, on 23 January 1906, the daughter of the Revd Francis Arthur Mann, who was then curate of Kimberworth, and his wife, Martha Hannah, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Haigh. She was educated at York College for Girls, an autobiographical account of her schooldays (1919&#150;1924) being published posthumously, and Somerville College, Oxford, taking a first in modern languages (specializing in French) in 1927, followed by a diploma in education in 1928. After undertaking postgraduate research at the Sorbonne, Manchester University, and Westfield College, London, she took a doctorate at the University of Paris (1934) and was appointed an assistant lecturer at Manchester University (1934&#150;6). In 1936 she became lecturer in French and director of studies in modern languages at Newnham College, Cambridge, resigning in 1945 to devote more time to her family.<br>
<br>In 1956 Margaret Mann Phillips returned to teaching as assistant lecturer at King's College, London, and was reader in French from 1964 until her retirement in 1968. She was active in the British Federation of University Women, a fellow of the Royal Society of Literature, and a member of the Society for Renaissance Studies. Her principal work was on Erasmus. Her <span class="italic">Erasmus and the Northern Renaissance</span> (1949; revised edn, 1981) was an essential introduction to Erasmus for English-speaking readers. She published <span class="italic">The Adages of Erasmus: a Study with Translations</span> (1964) and contributed a study and translation of <span class="italic">Anti-barbari</span> (1968) to the Toronto collected works of Erasmus. She also wrote on Thomas More, Marguerite de Navarre, and Montaigne. In 1979 Oxford University awarded her an honorary degree of DLitt. Described as &#145;a teacher of great warmth and modesty&#146;  (<span class="italic">Newnham College Roll Letter</span>, 79), she died on 18 September 1987.<br>
