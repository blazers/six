<span class="headword">Besant, Sir  Walter</span>  (1836&#150;1901), <span class="occ">writer and campaigner for authors' rights</span>, was born on 14 August 1836 at 3 St George's Square, Portsea, the fifth child and third son in a family of six sons and four daughters of William Besant (1800&#150;1879), a wine merchant of Portsmouth, and his wife, Sarah Ediss (1807&#150;1890), daughter of a builder and architect, of Dibden near Hythe, who married in 1825. <br>
<br>Walter Besant's introduction to literature was through his father's books, which included plays, eighteenth-century novels, Scott, and the works of Dickens then available. Besant's early education was varied. At nine he was taught the classics by a perpetual curate who had had the distinction of being mentioned in the <span class="italic">Memoirs of Harriette Wilson</span>. In 1851 he was sent as a boarder to Stockwell grammar school, then affiliated to King's College, London&#151;a suitable choice for someone expected to become an Anglican clergyman. He enjoyed Stockwell and left in the summer of 1854 as school captain laden with academic prizes. <br>
<br>Besant entered King's College, London, in October 1854; though he distinguished himself in classics, mathematics, and divinity, it proved a miserable but formative year. His naturally liberal temperament was alienated by the college's thoughtless orthodoxy and poor teaching. He spent much of his free time wandering around the City, an experience that laid the foundation for his lifelong interest in London's history. The year also proved disturbing: he was tempted by the raucous night life of the casinos, the Coal Hole, and the Cider Cellars. He was tempted but did not fall, explaining his preservation as being due to his na&iuml;vety, his appearance (he was only 5 feet 6 inches tall and suffered from asthma and eczema), and his myopia. In 1855 he moved to Christ's College, Cambridge, which was then being transformed by reforming fellows such as Gunson and Wolstenholme. Here he found broader views and a greater sense of community. His near-contemporaries included Seeley, Skeat, and Calverley. Seeley introduced him to the writings of Coleridge, Carlyle, and Maurice, and these almost certainly confirmed Besant's doubts about Anglican orthodoxy. <br>
<br>Some of Besant's contemporaries regarded his graduation in the mathematical tripos as eighteenth wrangler in 1859 as a poor reflection of his abilities, but Besant always argued with typical modesty that being bracketed with Calverley for his college's English essay prize was the distinction he really treasured. After a few months trying to make a living from journalism, Besant accepted a post as mathematics master at Leamington College; he was expected to be ordained and become chaplain to the college. An alternative offer of the job of senior professor at the Royal College, Mauritius, provided an escape from both England and its church. Besant spent the next six and half years socializing, climbing, and writing. College life was made difficult by frequent conflicts between its rector and the professors; in time the rector was removed and Besant invited to take over. By then, however, he was on leave in England and disinclined to return. <br>
<br>Besant had spent much of his free time in Mauritius studying French literature and, in addition to writing his first (rejected) novel, he produced a series of essays which he published under the title <span class="italic">Early French Poetry</span> (1868), the first of his many books and articles on French culture and history. In June 1868 Besant was appointed secretary to the Palestine Exploration Fund (PEF), a paid post which he held for eighteen years. The PEF brought him into contact with scholars, publishers, and military men&#151;including Edward Palmer, professor of Arabic at Cambridge, with whom he wrote <span class="italic">Jerusalem: the City of Herod and Saladin</span> (1871). Besant was also involved in 1877 in the investigation of the Shapira forgery. In order to provide the PEF with a steady income Besant organized a system of local societies spread throughout the country; he also set up a small society for the translation and publication of ancient accounts of pilgrimages to the Holy Land. The PEF gave Besant a financial security from which he could launch a career in authorship without, in his own words, &#145;dependence on the pen, and the pen alone&#146;  (W. Besant). <br>
<br>In 1874 Besant married Mary Garrat Foster Barham (<i>b</i>. 1849/50), with whom he had four children. His family life was happy and he extended this to include care for his nephew, Digby, the son of his younger brother the Revd Frank Besant and his estranged wife, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30735/', "Annie Besant")</script>. <br>
<br>In October 1869 James Rice, unsuccessful barrister, historian of the turf, and editor of <span class="italic">Once a Week</span>, published an unacknowledged, uncorrected article by Besant. Besant protested; Rice made a fulsome apology and asked for more contributions. Rice had devised the plot of a novel on which he invited Besant to collaborate. The result, <span class="italic">Ready Money Mortiboy</span>, was initially serialized in <span class="italic">Once a Week</span> and was published as a three-volume novel in July 1872; it proved a steady seller (140,000 copies by 1902). Between 1872 and 1882 the partnership, as well as numerous short stories, produced nine novels that appeared first in serial form, then in three volumes, and then in series of progressively cheaper one-volume editions. Most successful of all was <span class="italic">The Golden Butterfly</span> (1876), which had sold some 300,000 copies by 1912. Rice provided more than plots: he also acted as Besant's unpaid literary agent. On Rice's death in 1882 Besant became, to use his own words, &#145;a novelist with a free hand&#146;  (W. Besant); he also found himself needing an agent. In appointing A. P. Watt to that job in 1883, Besant became one of the earliest major writers to employ a professional literary agent. The majority of his solo fictions were either concerned with current social conditions or were historical novels set in the seventeenth or eighteenth centuries. The latter benefited from his precise sense of period and place. Besant's most famous novel was his first: <span class="italic">All Sorts and Conditions of Men</span>, serialized in <span class="italic">Belgravia</span> from January to December 1882 and published in three volumes in October 1882. The story of two lovers bent on social reform in the East End of London caught the public imagination and the novel continued to sell for decades (250,000 copies by 1905). Besant managed to produce on average a three-decker novel per year until his death; in addition he wrote essays, Christmas books, collections of short stories, and plays (many in collaboration with Walter Herries Pollock). <br>
<br>Later in his writing career Besant developed a new line in the popular history of London. He published <span class="italic">London</span> in 1892, and followed this with other studies (<span class="italic">Westminster</span>, 1895; <span class="italic">South London</span>, 1898; <span class="italic">East London</span>, 1901). This interest culminated in 1894 when he was invited by A. and C. Black to undertake a multi-volume, modern version of Stow: <span class="italic">The Survey of London</span>. The project was significantly under-funded by the publisher, relied too much on Besant's talents and money&#151;both already hopelessly over-stretched&#151;and was later seriously compromised by London county council's even more ambitious project. Ten volumes were finally issued, all posthumously, between 1902 and 1912. <br>
<br>Besant was a highly clubbable man, an energetic organizer, and an instinctive reformer. He became a freemason in 1862 as a member of the Quatuor Coronati lodge; freemasonry appealed to Besant as &#145;a religion which requires no priest&#146;. He joined the Savile Club in 1873; he became a member of the Athenaeum in 1887. He helped organize the Rabelais Club (1880&#150;89). In 1884, taking up an idea Charles Leland (Hans Breitmann) had tried in Philadelphia, Besant initiated the Home Arts Association, which established evening schools through the country to promote handicrafts. In 1897 Besant helped to found the Women's Central Bureau of Work which, despite his dislike of the &#145;new woman&#146;, was devised to help middle-class women into employment. In his writings and public speaking Besant campaigned for sweatshop workers in the East End, for the poor in the parish of St James's Ratcliffe, the Ragged School Union, the London Hospital, free public libraries, and the work of the Salvation Army. Besant must be one of the few social critics who witnessed one of his ideas taking literally concrete form. In <span class="italic">All Sorts and Conditions of Men</span> he had envisaged a Palace of Delight in the East End devoted to working-class recreation. Using <span class="italic">All Sorts</span> as, Besant claimed, a textbook, Sir Edmund Hay Currie combined the Beaumont bequest and &pound;20,000 from the Drapers' Company with money raised from the public to fund the building of the People's Palace on the Mile End Road, opened by Queen Victoria on 14 May 1887. The palace had a 4000-seat concert hall/ballroom, a library, a gymnasium, a swimming-bath, a winter garden, an art school&#151;and a technical school supported by the Drapers. Besant chaired the library committee, ran the literary club, and edited the <span class="italic">Palace Journal</span>. Despite great achievements, all did not go well. Finally the Drapers took over, and later the palace became the East London Technical College and then a college of London University. Concerned to cultivate better understanding with North America, Besant worked in the last two years of his life for the Atlantic Union. In 1895 he was knighted for his charitable work. <br>
<br>Besant was the prime mover in establishing the first successful collective organization for authors in Britain: the Society of Authors. He chaired the initial meeting on 28 September 1883 and it was he who drew up the plans. By 18 February 1884 a general meeting had been called, a prospectus issued, and fourteen vice-presidents and sixty-eight ordinary members had been enrolled. Perhaps Besant's greatest contribution in this formative period was to get Tennyson to become the society's first president, a morale-boosting coup which helped put the society on the map. Despite this, its growth was slow and Besant had to work tirelessly to encourage collective action in support of copyright law reform, the protection of literary property, and the promotion of the writing profession. For the last Besant had characteristically utopian hopes: he saw the society as a cross between the Acad&eacute;mie Fran&ccedil;aise and a self-regulating professional body. But he could not limit membership nor stop hopeful but hopeless writers paying for vanity publication. Although later Besant relinquished leadership of the society, his commitment to it increased. In 1890 he established the society's journal, <span class="italic">The Author</span>, and &#145;conducted&#146; it (the Dickensian verb is significant) until his death. In 1892 he helped found the Authors Club and he was always to be found in the press promoting with vigorous hyperbole the rights and dignity of authorship. He summarized his views on authorship in <span class="italic">The Pen and the Book</span> (1899). <br>
<br>Amid rampant authorial egos, Besant was a touchingly self-denying figure: more than once he dipped into his own pocket to finance the Society of Authors; at society dinners he would often be found sitting near the bottom of the table. This modesty he also applied to his own writings which, one suspects, he did not believe would last. Despite advocating the retention of copyright, Besant tended to sell his own as soon as he could. Besant died of Bright's disease at his house, Frognal End, Hampstead, London, on 9 June 1901 and was buried in the burial-ground off Church Row in Hampstead.<br>
