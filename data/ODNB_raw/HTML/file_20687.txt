<span class="headword">Oldham,  John</span>  (1653&#150;1683), <span class="occ">poet</span>, was born on 9 August 1653 at Shipton Moyne, Gloucestershire, where his grandfather, also John (1594&#150;1657), was rector. The poet's father, another John (1629&#150;1716), was rector of the adjoining parish of Long Newnton, Wiltshire, from which he was ejected in 1662, but he survived on the proceeds of a small estate and a school. He took charge of his son's early education before sending him to Tetbury grammar school for two years, and thence to Oxford, where Oldham matriculated at St Edmund Hall on 17 June 1670. In 1674 his BA was granted subject to the performance of certain public exercises, but Oldham did not complete these, and returned home without a degree, probably to teach in his father's school for a year or two.<br>
<br>Thereafter, while Oldham developed his poetic skills, he earned his living as a schoolmaster and private tutor, first as usher at Whitgift School, Croydon (1676&#150;9), then in the household of Sir Edward Thurland at Reigate. At one or more points in his life he seems to have made a bid for independence, and &#145;An allusion to Martial&#146; (<i>c</i>.1681) recounts that the author is living in a garret at the far end of Clerkenwell&#151;though this need not be autobiographical. But (as several of his poems make clear) poetry did not pay, and he soon took another tutorship, this time in the family of Sir William Hickes, of Low Leyton, Essex. Here he studied medicine with the distinguished physician Dr Robert Lower. In June 1682 William Pierrepont, fourth earl of Kingston, became his patron.<br>
<br>Oldham's early poems were addressed to friends and neighbours, with some love poems and Pindaric imitations of Cowley, notably a long ode in memory of his close friend Charles Morwent (1675), and another on the death of the Croydon worthy Harman Atwood (1677). In 1677 he published a Pindaric poem on the marriage of Prince William of Orange and Princess Mary, which was his first work to appear in print. Cowley would remain a principal influence, and the Pindaric ode a favourite form. But at some point Oldham grew acquainted with the poetry and reputation of the earl of Rochester, and then with the earl himself. His first poem to achieve renown was &#145;Aude aliquid. Ode&#146; (written in 1676 at Croydon), which circulated in manuscript and appeared in a pirated printed edition in 1679 under the misleading title <span class="italic">A Satyr Against Vertue</span>. This was imagined to be Rochester's speech on smashing the phallic glass sundials in the king's privy garden in 1675, and its satirical impersonation of Rochester's libertine stance drew an appreciative visit from the earl and his entourage. The &#145;Dithyrambique on Drinking: Suppos'd to be Spoken by Rochester at the Guinny-Club&#146; and &#145;Sardanapalus&#146;, an erotic heroic extravaganza too obscene for publication, completed a trio of poems satirically mimicking libertine attitudes with such bravura that some readers failed to see their ironic purpose. &#145;Upon the Author of the Play call'd <i>Sodom</i>&#146; (the pornographic drama often attributed to Rochester, and certainly from his circle) is itself characterized by obscenity, and it too remained in manuscript until it was printed in the unauthorized <span class="italic">Poems on Several Occasions by the Right Honourable the E. of R&#151;</span> (1680). Sir William Soame criticized Oldham's penchant for obscenity in manuscript verses addressed &#145;To the author of <i>Sardanapalus</i>, upon that and his other writings&#146;, urging him to refine his verse through the study of Horace and Boileau&#151;which in due course Oldham did.<br>
<br>Oldham's first substantial volume was <span class="italic">Satyrs upon the Jesuits</span> (written in 1679, published anonymously in 1680, dated 1681). Prompted by the Popish Plot, and informed by extensive reading, these anti-Catholic satires attacked the Jesuits' equivocation, murderous plotting, and gulling of the populace. The first of them, <span class="italic">Garnet's Ghost</span>, appeared as a pirated publication in 1679, and its evident popularity may have prompted Oldham to complete the set of four satires and to add a prologue. They are robust, vigorous work, rough in versification, coarse in vocabulary, and unsparing in their vilification of Catholic beliefs. They demonstrate Oldham's mastery of the couplet form, and his continuing interest in heroic satirical modes. To many readers these have been the poems by which Oldham has been known, but they are unedifying, and better work would follow. The volume was rounded out by &#145;Aude aliquid. Ode&#146;, &#145;A Satyr upon a Woman, who by her Falshood and Scorn was the Death of my Friend&#146;, and a translation of &#145;The Passion of Byblis&#146; from Ovid's <span class="italic">Metamorphoses</span>, the latter prompted by the appearance in 1680 of John Dryden's <span class="italic">Ovid's Epistles</span>. Of these, &#145;Byblis&#146; still deserves attention (and was admired at the time) for its portrayal of the psychology of sexual desire, and shows more variety of tone and a subtler handling of verse than the rest of the collection.<br>
<br>As if to demonstrate that he was more than a purveyor of rough satire and near pornography, Oldham's next volume, <span class="italic">Some New Pieces</span> (1681), also anonymous, featured a range of translations from the classics. Here Oldham found his true m&eacute;tier, developing the art of &#145;imitation&#146; or the free transposition of Latin originals into contemporary English dress. The collection starts with a version of Horace's <span class="italic">Ars poetica</span> which breathes Oldham's characteristic devotion to poetry as a vocation, followed by his <span class="italic">Serm.</span>, i.9 (&#145;the bore&#146;), in which the scene is transferred to London and Oldham shows his genius for catching conversational idiom in verse. Imitations of Horace's <span class="italic">Odes</span>, i.31 and ii.14, have a more meditative tone. Among the finest of Oldham's poems is &#145;A letter from the country to a friend in town, giving an account of the author's inclinations to poetry&#146; (written in 1678), which expresses his passionate commitment to the life of a poet despite its lack of financial rewards, and includes a remarkable passage imagining the emergence of poetry from the author's unconscious into his conscious mind:<blockquote>
<div>When at first search I traverse o're my mind,<br>
</div>
<div>Nought but a dark and empty Void I find:<br>
</div>
<div>Some little hints at length, like sparks, break thence,<br>
</div>
<div>And glimm'ring Thoughts just dawning into sence:<br>
</div>
<div>Confus'd a while the mixt Idea's lie,<br>
</div>
<div>With nought of mark to be discover'd by,<br>
</div>
<div>Like colours undistinguisht in the night,<br>
</div>
<div>Till the dusk images, mov'd to the light,<br>
</div>
<div>Teach the discerning Faculty to chuse,<br>
</div>
<div>Which it had best adopt, and which refuse.<br>
</div> (ll. 168&#150;77)</blockquote>Besides a Pindaric &#145;Praise of Homer&#146;, and a pair of religious poems, the volume also includes a beautiful, mellifluous elegy for Rochester (praised by Ezra Pound in his <span class="italic">ABC of Reading</span>, 1934, for its cantabile qualities) in the form of a translation of Moschus's pastoral lament for Bion. This fine collection demonstrated Oldham's range of voices, and staked a claim for him as a leading figure among those poets such as Dryden and Roscommon who were fashioning a distinctively English form of classicism.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">Poems and Translations</span> (1683) continued the trend established by <span class="italic">Some New Pieces</span>, and indicated that Oldham had been studying the recent satires of Nicolas Boileau-Despr&eacute;aux. An unfinished manuscript translation of <span class="italic">Le lutrin</span> written in 1678 shows that he had been experimenting with Boileau in his attempts to catch the right tone for heroic or mock heroic satire, and this new volume included versions of Boileau's <span class="italic">Satires</span> 5 and 8. It was Boileau's transposition of Juvenal's <span class="italic">Satire 3</span> from Rome to Paris that inspired Oldham to his own vigorous imitation of the same original, a vivid evocation of the hazards of life in Restoration London, rendered with a fair imitation of Juvenal's overheated indignation. Other classical translations broaden the collection in style and subject: verses from Anacreon, Catullus, Horace, Martial, Petronius. Two other satires attest to Oldham's fiercely proud independence. &#145;A Satyr: the Person of Spenser is Brought in, Dissuading the Author from the Study of Poetry&#146; denounces the contemporary neglect of poets and poetry. &#145;A Satyr addressed to a friend that is about to leave the university and come abroad in the world&#146; includes sharp passages on the humiliations of life as a chaplain or tutor in great houses, and concludes with an eloquent version of the fable of the wolf and the dog. The wolf envies the dog's comfortable condition, until he notices the scar of the collar round his neck, and proudly embraces freedom with poverty rather than luxury with servitude.<br>
<br>Oldham died of smallpox in the earl of Kingston's house at Holme Pierrepont, Nottinghamshire, where he was buried in the local church on 7 December 1683, aged only thirty. A fine memorial was erected over his grave in the style of Grinling Gibbons. After his death, a volume of <span class="italic">Remains</span> (1684, 2nd edn 1687) collected up some minor pieces, but is chiefly remarkable for the commemorative poems with which it begins, headed by Dryden's &#145;To the Memory of Mr Oldham&#146;, and continuing with tributes by Thomas D'Urfey, Thomas Flatman, and Nahum Tate among others. Dryden sees him as a kindred spirit:<blockquote>
<div>Farewell, too little and too lately known,<br>
</div>
<div>Whom I began to think and call my own:<br>
</div>
<div>For sure our Souls were near ally'd; and thine<br>
</div>
<div>Cast in the same poetic mould with mine.<br>
</div> (ll. 1&#150;4)</blockquote>It is possible that the <span class="italic">Satyrs upon the Jesuits</span> helped stimulate Dryden to write <span class="italic">Absalom and Achitophel</span>, and that Oldham's classical imitations of the early 1680s encouraged Dryden to embark on the succession of magnificent translations which appeared from 1685 onwards. To Dryden, Oldham's verse was rough, but that was appropriate for satire, for<blockquote>
<div class="indent">Wit will shine<br>
</div>
<div>Through the harsh cadence of a rugged line.<br>
</div>
<div>A noble Error, and but seldom made,<br>
</div>
<div>When Poets are by too much force betray'd.<br>
</div> (ll. 15&#150;18)</blockquote>Oldham's four volumes were gathered together with a new title-page to constitute his <span class="italic">Works</span> (1684) and frequently reprinted into the early eighteenth century. Pope read him carefully, but thought him &#145;too much like Billingsgate&#146;  (Spence, 1.202), and he was not included among Johnson's poets. A corrupt and bowdlerized selection appeared in 1854. With renewed interest in Restoration satire and in the history of the classical imitation, his reputation grew somewhat in the twentieth century, thanks largely to the scholarly and critical labours of Harold F. Brooks, which culminated in his edition of 1987. This adds a number of poems printed from manuscript, including material from Oldham's rough drafts and fair copies which are preserved in the Bodleian Library (MS Rawlinson poet. 123).<br>
<br>Though uneven, and in places scatological and obscene, Oldham's work has passion and power; his range is wider than is commonly supposed, he shows great versatility in his handling of the couplet, and adopts an attractive variety of conversational voices. Liberty and poetry are his most cherished themes. Dryden thought of him as the great classical poet whom England never had&#151;the heir who died before his time, the lost hero of Augustan England. It is in these terms that Dryden takes leave of Oldham, in moving lines which conclude what is perhaps the finest elegy in the language:<blockquote>
<div>Once more, hail and farewel; farewel thou young,<br>
</div>
<div>But ah too short, <i>Marcellus</i> of our Tongue;<br>
</div>
<div>Thy Brows with Ivy, and with Laurels bound;<br>
</div>
<div>But Fate and gloomy Night encompass thee around.<br>
</div> (ll. 22&#150;25)</blockquote>
