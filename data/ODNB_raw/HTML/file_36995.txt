</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Wolseley,  Garnet Joseph</span>, first Viscount Wolseley  (1833&#150;1913), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was born at Golden Bridge House, co. Dublin, on 4 June 1833, the eldest of seven children of Major Garnet Wolseley, 25th foot, and Frances Anne Smith.<h2>
<a name="Animpecuniousfamily"></a>An impecunious family</h2>Wolseley's father, who had sold his commission shortly after marriage, died when Wolseley was only seven years old, leaving the family in somewhat straitened circumstances. This was to become one key to Wolseley's later career, for he assumed the role of head of and principal provider for the family, supporting his mother and two of his three brothers, George and Fred. Eventually George rose to high military rank himself, but earlier in his career he frequently incurred debts which Wolseley covered. Fred pursued various unsuccessful business ventures in Australia, which were a drain on Wolseley's own finances, particularly in 1878 and 1893. Thus Wolseley's pursuit of financial reward from his services, such as the grants he received after the Asante and Egyptian expeditions, and his determination to ensure that his daughter would succeed to his peerage after his death, were connected with assumed family responsibilities and an intimate comprehension of the disadvantages of being impecunious. His mother could manage only a day school education for him in Dublin, and, eager to improve his opportunities of obtaining a commission, Wolseley worked in a surveyor's office, thus acquiring a knowledge of draughtsmanship and surveying.<h2>
<a name="Earlymilitarycareer"></a>Early military career</h2>Unable to afford a commission, Wolseley and his mother sought nomination from the commander-in-chief, Wellington, on the strength of his father's service. His mother's direct appeal was successful, and he was nominated to an ensigncy in the 12th foot on 12 March 1852. Wolseley later wrote that the first business of the young officer who wished to distinguish himself in his profession was to seek to get killed, and, in effect, this was the only means by which he could hope to advance while the system of purchase prevailed. In this sense, as Redvers Buller later noted, Wolseley was very much a self-made man. Wolseley inherited from his mother, a deeply religious Irish protestant, a profound belief in a destiny willed by God, which was to comfort him even in the darkest days of his failure to save Charles Gordon at Khartoum in 1885. Implicit fatalism allied to great courage was to bring Wolseley grievous wounds in his early career, but also that recognition he sought in his chosen profession. Ambition was to be another key to his future.<h2>
<a name="Patrioticassumptionsandapproachtopubliclife"></a>&#145;Patriotic&#146; assumptions and approach to public life</h2>Yet Wolseley also had immense pride in his country, which, like many other Anglo-Irish, he expressed solely in terms of love of England. He wrote in September 1882, &#145;To see England great is my highest aspiration, &amp; that I might have a leading part in contributing to the attainment of that greatness, is my only real ambition&#146;  (Wolseley to his wife, 28 Sept 1882, Wolseley Collections, W/P 11/23). He despised foreigners and especially Irish nationalists, frequently alluding to the desirability of his filling some proconsular role in Ireland and, on at least one occasion, of putting himself at the head of the loyalists to resist the raising of a &#145;filthy green rag&#146;  (Maurice MSS, 2/2/18). The extremity of his patriotism was also apparent in his utter contempt for most party politicians. Wolseley despised the &#145;dirty dunghill sort of democratic wave &hellip; now passing over the world&#146;  (Wolseley to his wife, 24&#150;7 Nov 1884, Wolseley Collections, W/P 13/31) and made little secret of his belief that party politics was the &#145;curse of modern England&#146;, as he expressed it in one public speech in April 1888. For Wolseley, the &#145;arch-traitor&#146; Gladstone was to personify all that was wrong with the system, and his deep hatred for the &#145;canting old sinner&#146; was only intensified by his attributing to Gladstone the blame for the peace concluded with the Boers after the death of his favourite, George Colley, at Majuba in 1881 and for the deaths of both Herbert Stewart, who had replaced Colley as his most favoured subordinate, and Gordon in the Sudan. Ironically, despite his Conservatism, he was regarded by his opponents within the army as a dangerous radical and by the Liberal leadership almost as a colleague.<br>
<br>However, Wolseley's tendency towards allegedly &#145;sinister caesarism&#146;  (Preston, &#145;Khartoum relief expedition&#146;, 97) has been exaggerated, for he always understood the restricted constitutional parameters within which the army existed and the requirements of his political masters; he wrote, for example, in August 1879 that the whole truth should not be told in dispatches for &#145;unpleasant truths that can be made use of by the opponents of the Government you are serving should be reserved for one's private correspondence with ministers&#146;  (Wolseley to his wife, 8&#150;13 Aug 1879, Wolseley Collections, W/P 8/19). There was a cynicism in this. Moreover, while despising the press and war correspondents, he consciously used his public utterances and writing, as he put it in February 1878, &#145;to keep my name before the public&#146;  (Wolseley to his brother, 18 Feb 1878, Wolseley Collections, 163/iv). He always denied that he wrote for newspapers as opposed to periodicals, but much the same effect was achieved through the employment of many of his staff by the press on campaign and his promotion of official and semi-official campaign histories. On a personal level Wolseley could be charming, but this was not always the image conveyed, and Disraeli was to write to the queen on one occasion: &#145;It is quite true that Wolseley is an egotist and a braggart. So was Nelson &hellip; Men of action when eminently successful in early life are generally boastful and full of themselves&#146;  (Beaconsfield to Victoria, 24 Aug 1879, Royal Archives, B61/34).<h2>
<a name="Soldiering18521861"></a>Soldiering, 1852&#150;1861</h2>Having secured his commission, Wolseley at once transferred to the 80th foot on 13 April 1852 in order to see active service in the Second Anglo-Burmese War. Within a few months of his arrival he distinguished himself in an assault on Myat Toon's stockade at Kyault Azein in March 1853, being so badly wounded in the left thigh that he would be troubled by the leg for the remainder of his life. Promoted to lieutenant in the 84th foot on 16 May 1853, he was invalided home and transferred to the 90th foot in Dublin on 24 February 1854. Promotion to captain followed on 26 January 1855 as a result of Wolseley's services in the Crimean War, and through his knowledge of surveying Wolseley was seconded to the engineers in the trenches before Sevastopol. There he met Charles George Gordon, who was to become one of his heroes; in turn, Wolseley would become one of only two men for whom Gordon prayed nightly. Wolseley was slightly wounded in the right thigh during one attack on the Quarries in June 1855, but on 30 August he was severely wounded by shellfire, suffering another wound to the right leg and losing the sight of his left eye.<br>
<br>On recovering Wolseley was appointed deputy assistant quartermaster-general in the Crimea on 8 November 1855 and served on as such until the end of hostilities in June 1856. He was recommended for a brevet majority but could not receive it until he had served for six years. Regimental service was resumed at Aldershot, and the 90th embarked for China in early 1857, only to be diverted to India through the outbreak of the mutiny. Wolseley participated in the advance for the first relief of Lucknow via Cawnpore. The 90th then remained at Lucknow until the second and final relief in February 1858. Wolseley was appointed deputy assistant quartermaster-general on Sir Hope Grant's staff on 1 April 1858, succeeding his future rival, Frederick Roberts, and campaigning with Hope Grant in Oudh. The brevet majority having been secured finally on 24 March 1858, Wolseley was rewarded for his further services with a brevet lieutenant-colonelcy on 26 April 1859. Hope Grant became Wolseley's first military patron and Wolseley remained on Grant's staff in the same capacity for the Second Opium War between March 1860 and March 1861, the campaign becoming the subject of his first book, the generally unremarkable <span class="italic">Narrative of the War with China in 1860</span> (1862). Promotion to an unattached majority had been received on 15 February 1861 and Wolseley received a majority in his regiment on 6 August 1861. In less than eight years Wolseley had risen, without purchase of his commissions, from ensign to brevet lieutenant-colonel at the age of only twenty-five, and had established a reputation for courage and judgement in action and as an able staff officer.<h2>
<a name="InCanadaandmarriage"></a>In Canada and marriage</h2>Granted a period of long leave on his return from China, Wolseley was suddenly ordered to Canada as a result of the <i>Trent</i> affair of November 1861 (when American officials boarded a British mail packet), taking up the appointment of assistant quartermaster-general at Montreal on 11 January 1862, a post he held until 31 March 1867. Like many other British officers in Canada, he took the opportunity of seeing something of the American Civil War, reaching the Confederacy and meeting both Robert E. Lee and &#145;Stonewall&#146; Jackson in the aftermath of Lee's retreat from Maryland after Antietam. As indicated in &#145;A month's visit to the Confederate headquarters&#146;, an article largely reworked by his sister, Matilda, which Wolseley had published in <span class="italic">Blackwood's Magazine</span> in January 1863, he favoured British recognition of the South. In Lee, too, he found a heroic figure, rivalled only by Gordon. A later article, &#145;General Lee&#146;, published in <span class="italic">Macmillan's Magazine</span> in March 1887 has been described as a &#145;classic of Confederate literature&#146;  (Wolseley, <span class="italic">American Civil War</span>, 53). Wolseley also contributed a series of review articles on the war to the <span class="italic">North American Review</span> during 1889 and sketches of Nathan B. Forrest and William T. Sherman to the <span class="italic">United Service Magazine</span> in 1891&#150;2, as well as encouraging G. F. R. Henderson to undertake his celebrated study of Jackson. However, his pro-Southern sympathies and hero-worship of Lee tended to detract from the analytical value of his work, and he was not the intellectual equal in this respect of either the commander-in-chief in Canada, Sir John Michel, or the adjutant-general of the Canadian militia, Sir Patrick MacDougall, both of whom were to become patrons of Wolseley during his Canadian service. Wolseley secured a brevet colonelcy on 5 June 1865, becoming deputy quartermaster-general on 1 October 1867 on Michel's recommendation and commanding first a cadet training school and then a camp of observation during the Fenian incursions.<br>
<br>Although by then retired from the Canadian command, Michel was also to recommend Wolseley to lead the Red River expedition in 1870. In the meantime, however, two other aspects of Wolseley's Canadian service were significant. First, Wolseley married Louisa Erskine (1843&#150;1920) on his birthday, 4 June 1867, while on a short home leave. &#145;Loo&#146; became an important prop to Wolseley, promoting his interests while he was overseas and serving as the recipient of the letters and journals he wrote as a safety valve. A woman of keen wit and shrewd observation, she was apt to accuse Wolseley of composing his letters with an eye on posterity. In turn, Wolseley was to accuse her of declining to assist his social and political duties on Cyprus&#151;one of the few occasions when she accompanied him overseas&#151;and feigning a lack of interest in his military career. She was also somewhat jealous of other women, such as the duchess of Edinburgh, who were friendly with her husband. None the less, the affection between the two throughout their marriage was clear and Wolseley felt keenly the separations on campaigns, his letters frequently addressed to his little porpoise, ratcatcher, periwinkle, whippersnapper, or similar endearments. Their only child, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/49185/', "Frances Garnet Wolseley")</script>, was born on 15 September 1872 and was to become a noted horticulturist.<br>
<br>Secondly, in 1869, and at the suggestion of Sir Richard Airey, the army's quartermaster-general, Wolseley added to his military reputation through the publication of his <span class="italic">Soldier's Pocket Book</span>. A practical manual of soldiering, which was to go through five editions, it was the only guide of its kind to military organization and tactics in the kind of small wars in which the army was increasingly involved. It was also the nearest that Wolseley would come to producing any substantial work of theory other than the paper on field manoeuvres submitted for the Wellington prize essay in 1872, which was placed second, and occasional articles in periodicals such as <span class="italic">Blackwood's Magazine</span>, <span class="italic">Macmillan's Magazine</span>, and the <span class="italic">Nineteenth Century</span>, which were written as often as not principally for money. The <span class="italic">Soldier's Pocket Book</span> demonstrated Wolseley's understanding of logistics and advertised his commitment to military reform. The former was particularly apposite, for on 5 April 1870 he was chosen by the new commander-in-chief in Canada, the Hon. James Lindsay, to lead the Red River expedition to overthrow a provisional government established by rebellious <i>m&eacute;tis</i> at Fort Garry, 600 miles beyond Lake Superior.<br>
<br>Some 1200 men had to be transported across a series of unnavigable portages through the wilderness of the Canadian north-west, with an imperative to complete the mission and return before the lakes froze. Wolseley took a minute interest in the organization of his force, which he formally took over on 10 May 1870, and reached Fort Garry on 24 August, only to find that the <i>m&eacute;tis</i> had fled. For his services Wolseley was created KCMG and CB, and was both praised by Lindsay and eulogized by G. L. Huyshe's semi-official campaign history. Wolseley was then brought home to take up the appointment of assistant adjutant-general in the discipline branch of the War Office on 1 May 1871.<h2>
<a name="TheSecondAsanteWar18731874"></a>The Second Asante War, 1873&#150;1874</h2>Wolseley did not play a leading role in the Cardwell reforms, as these were substantially completed before he returned to England. But he fully agreed with their aims, and particularly with short service and linked battalions, and he was quickly identified with the cause of reform within the War Office. He was selected by Cardwell in August 1873 to lead an expedition to punish Asante incursions into the Gold Coast protectorate by seizing their capital of Kumasi. Wolseley had been pressing for the appointment within the War Office, but his organizational and logistic ability was testified by the <span class="italic">Soldier's Pocket Book</span>, his achievements on the Red River, and his participation in the planning of the autumn manoeuvres in 1872. Moreover, he supported reform and this would be the first major expedition to test the Cardwell changes, although the recent re-organization had no immediate relevance to the actual conduct of colonial campaigning. Despite his reforming reputation, Wolseley at this time enjoyed the support of the army's commander-in-chief, the duke of Cambridge, who had already suggested his appointment as adjutant-general in India, only for the proposal to fall on Wolseley's lack of the required native language qualification.<br>
<br>Accordingly, Wolseley took up the appointment of governor of the Gold Coast with the temporary rank of major-general on 2 October 1873. As was the case in the Red River campaign, the difficulties were primarily climate and terrain, and he had to plan on the basis of using British troops for the minimum possible time. Indeed, three British battalions did not arrive until January 1874, by which time Wolseley's locally raised forces had compelled the Asante to withdraw across the Pra. He then advanced on Kumasi, defeating the Asante at Amoaful on 27 January and occupying their capital on 4 February. Having burned Kumasi, Wolseley was back at the coast by 19 February and had re-embarked his army eight days later. It was a model campaign, extensively reported by the press, and it established Wolseley as the &#145;Modern Major-General&#146;, memorably portrayed by George Grossmith in Gilbert and Sullivan's <span class="italic">Pirates of Penzance</span>. In addition, &#145;All Sir Garnet&#146; became a cockney catchphrase. Wolseley was rewarded with the GCMG, KCB, a grant of &pound;25,000, and major-general's rank on 1 April 1874. The honours came from the Conservatives, who had come into office during the campaign. Wolseley, whom Disraeli described as &#145;a little man, but with a good presence, and a bright blue eye, holds his head well, and has a lithe figure&#146;  (Monypenny &amp; Buckle, 5.305), believed he would have been granted a peerage by the Liberals, and he turned down both the GCB and a baronetcy, believing the latter worthy only of &#145;common people&#146;.<h2>
<a name="TheWolseleyring"></a>The Wolseley &#145;ring&#146;</h2>The expedition also established the concept of the Asante or <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/69913/', "Wolseley ring")</script> or gang, which was to arouse strong opinions among rival groups such as the traditionalists, ranged around Cambridge, and the &#145;Indians&#146;, who came to be identified primarily with Roberts. The struggle with the former tended to encompass reform issues such as short service and the latter principally the empire's strategic orientation. However, neither particular issues nor the positions assumed by individuals on them were necessarily constant, although the context of rivalry was invariably centred upon manoeuvring adherents into particular commands. Wolseley claimed that he always made a practice of noting down the names of able soldiers wherever he met them and that merit was his only criterion, and it was widely recognized that he had the knack of picking able men.<br>
<br>The selection of staff for the Red River campaign was dictated by those available in Canada and was essentially unplanned. Therefore Asante marked the effective beginning of the ring, although Redvers Buller, Hugh McCalmont, John McNeill, William Butler, and Huyshe had also been on the Red River expedition. In addition, Asante saw the adherence to Wolseley, among others, of Evelyn Wood, Colley, Frederick Maurice, Baker Russell, Henry Brackenbury, and George Greaves. Some were chosen fortuitously, while others such as Colley, Brackenbury, and Maurice, who had won the Wellington essay competition, were selected on intellectual reputation: Wolseley consistently encouraged the employment of Staff College graduates. He did not always have a free choice of staff as, for example, in 1879 in South Africa, when he inherited many of Lord Chelmsford's staff, or in Egypt in 1882, when the principal field commands were taken by those already designated to act in the autumn manoeuvres. He also found it politic on occasions to accept nominations by others such as Cambridge or the prince of Wales. Moreover in his later War Office appointments as adjutant-general, and even as commander-in-chief, Wolseley did not have exclusive control of the promotion system. Nevertheless, he was somewhat disingenuous in claiming that he always dropped failures or continually introduced fresh blood, and appointments were often a case of reshuffling the same cards, since he argued that he could rely instinctively on those familiar with his working methods and in whom he had full confidence.<br>
<br>This was not how Wolseley's opponents saw the &#145;mutual admiration society&#146;, and there was resentment on the part of those excluded from his well-publicized campaigns. There were undoubtedly victims of the ring, such as Sir John Glover in Asante and Sir Charles Wilson in the Sudan, but it was not as exclusive as often claimed and no worse in its practices than those of Cambridge or Roberts, and similar networks occurred in other areas of Victorian life. A more significant charge was that constant employment of the same officers failed to develop others, although this was the claim of those, such as Cambridge, who were most irked by Wolseley ignoring the claims of seniority. Yet Wolseley did arguably become something of a prisoner of the initial success of the ring, feeling it necessary to employ the same men lest his rejection of them reflect adversely on his earlier choice. His criticism of many of his followers increased over the years, although this was also a result of prominent subordinates growing in stature and seniority themselves. &#145;The Chief&#146; was respected rather than liked, and he had associates rather than friends. Also, the deaths of the two men to whom he felt closest, Colley and Stewart, whom Wolseley had recruited to the ring in Zululand in 1879, affected him greatly. Wolseley never forgave Wood, for example, for obeying government instructions and making peace with the Boers after Colley's death, while Buller's apparent willingness to accept appointment as commander-in-chief ahead of Wolseley in 1895 was regarded as betrayal. What made increasing dissension and rivalry within the ring so destructive, notably during the Gordon relief expedition, was that Wolseley's command style was built upon individuals willingly fulfilling specific roles in a kind of orchestrated military collective. Moreover, Wolseley's capacity to manage affairs decreased in proportion to the growth in the scale of operations. Generally Wolseley was able to co-ordinate the diverse talents of his chosen subordinates in ways well suited to colonial campaigning, but in the last analysis improvisation was no substitute for a proper general staff.<h2>
<a name="Colonialsoldiering18751882"></a>Colonial soldiering, 1875&#150;1882</h2>Wolseley was a considerable political asset after Asante, and after a short spell back at the War Office as inspector-general of auxiliary forces from April 1874 to March 1875 he was sent out by the colonial secretary, Carnarvon, as high commissioner and general commanding to Natal, tasked with forwarding the cause of federation in southern Africa by pushing an amended constitution through the colonial assembly. Wolseley assumed his new position on 30 March, effecting the required administrative changes and returning to England in October to resume duty as inspector-general. He had grown sufficiently weary of the conservatism of the duke of Cambridge to contemplate retirement before his Natal appointment, while the duke himself was increasingly hostile to Wolseley's ambition to become commander-in-chief in India. Thus, while Wolseley regarded his next appointment on 25 November 1876, to membership of the Council of India at the India Office, as a possible stepping stone to the Indian command and found that his memoranda were taken far more seriously than at the War Office, Cambridge tended to welcome the opportunity to sideline him, and had earlier suggested Wolseley should be given the command in Canada.<br>
<br>Wolseley's claims for an active command could not be easily dismissed, however, and in February 1878 he was designated chief of staff to Lord Napier in the event of a British expeditionary force being sent to resist Russian control of the Dardanelles. He received promotion to lieutenant-general on 25 March 1878 and then on 22 July was appointed the first high commissioner and governor-general of Cyprus, intended as a <i>place d'armes</i> to counter Russian regional influence. Wolseley fretted that he thus missed the Second Anglo-Afghan War, where Colley, as the viceroy's private secretary, was pressing Wolseley's claims for field command. Similarly, it appeared that he would miss the Anglo-Zulu War, but after the disaster at Isandlwana and further mishaps suffered by Chelmsford, Wolseley was appointed governor and high commissioner in South Africa with the rank of local general on 23 June 1879. Before he could get to the front, however, Chelmsford secured victory over the Zulu at Ulundi and Wolseley's military role was confined to the pursuit and capture of the Zulu king, Cetshwayo, and the defeat of the Pedi chief, Sekukuni, in the Transvaal. Civil administration had few attractions for Wolseley, and in imposing the partition of Zululand and attempting to intimidate the Boers of the Transvaal into an acceptance of annexation he contributed to future difficulties in southern Africa. Once more expecting a peerage, which might further his claims to the Indian command, and once more returning to find a new government installed at home, Wolseley was offered only the GCB he had rejected six years previously. Wolseley also entertained some hopes of securing either the Bombay or Madras commands as a means of getting to India, where the commander-in-chief was due to retire in 1881. It was made clear, however, that he could not expect an Indian appointment, and on 1 July 1880 he became quartermaster-general at the War Office.<h2>
<a name="Reformingthearmy"></a>Reforming the army</h2>Wolseley was to continue as quartermaster-general until 31 March 1882 and then was adjutant-general at the War Office, albeit interrupted by the Egyptian and Sudan campaigns, until 30 September 1890. It was a period which was to throw him directly into opposition to Cambridge, who rightly sensed that it was he to whom Wolseley referred at a public dinner in June 1880 as one of &#145;those great boulders of prejudice and superstition who now impede the way&#146;  (Royal Archives, E25/96a). The duke feared that reform would undermine regimental tradition and the army's constitutional position, and held that long service was essential to discipline, and that drill and discipline was the primary route to military efficiency. Wolseley was hardly the dangerous radical portrayed by Cambridge and his cousin, the queen: he was to share Cambridge's opposition to the abolition of the post of commander-in-chief and its replacement with a continental-style chief of staff. Moreover, like Cambridge, he was to press for the expansion of the army, for a definitive statement of the army's priorities, and for politicians to accept their ultimate responsibility for national security policies determined on political and financial rather than military grounds.<br>
<br>However, Wolseley's reforming zeal and willingness to flout seniority in staff selection made him anathema to the duke and his circle. Particularly as adjutant-general, Wolseley oversaw modernization of the infantry drill book, the introduction of mounted infantry, improvement in campaign dress, greater tactical training, extension of the intelligence department, and the preparation of mobilization plans, the last two under the direction of Henry Brackenbury. Wolseley also championed what might be regarded as an &#145;imperial school&#146; as opposed to either a &#145;continental&#146; or an &#145;Indian&#146; school of strategic thought, placing the priority firmly on home defence and envisaging any likely war against Russia as being waged through amphibious operations at the peripheries such as the Baltic, Black Sea, or the Turkestan/Caspian area rather than across the north-west frontier. The &#145;Indian&#146; view that any threat to India must be regarded as the empire's first priority did not command the support often implied. While Brackenbury was converted to the &#145;Indian&#146; position after 1891, this did not challenge the prevailing orthodoxy within the War Office; the celebrated Stanhope memorandum of 1888, which virtually recapitulated Wolseley's strategic perceptions, held sway until Roberts became commander-in-chief. Even then, the triumph of the &#145;Indians&#146; proved short-lived, as attention moved towards a German rather than a Russian enemy.<br>
<br>The duke and the queen disliked not only Wolseley's iconoclasm but also his apparent inability to refrain from public comment adverse to the duke. They blocked the attempt by Gladstone and his secretary of state for war, Childers, to make Wolseley a peer in March 1881, an elevation intended both to give the government military support for reform in the Lords and also to mollify Wolseley for his disappointment at the selection of Roberts to command in South Africa after Colley's death. Gladstone initially threatened to resign on the peerage issue but did not persist in this. However, Wolseley was offered the post of adjutant-general in December 1881 provided he guaranteed discretion in his public statements.<h2>
<a name="EgyptandtheSudan"></a>Egypt and the Sudan</h2>Wolseley's tenure as adjutant-general was twice interrupted by campaigns. On 20 July 1882 the cabinet decided to appoint him commander, with the temporary rank of general, of the expedition to suppress Arabi Pasha's nationalist revolt in Egypt: the cabinet minute read: &#145;Instructions to Wolseley: Put down Arabi and establish Khedive's power&#146;  (Gladstone, <span class="italic">Diaries</span>, 31 July 1882). He was formally appointed on 4 August, left England on 15 August, and after a feint at Alexandria, swiftly and secretly transferred his troops down the Suez Canal to Isma&#145;iliyyah. A sharp action at Qassasin brought him up to Arabi's fortified lines at Tell al-Kebir and these were captured on 13 September. Arabi's army was routed and Cairo promptly occupied. Wolseley received promotion to full general on 18 November 1882, the thanks of parliament, and a grant of &pound;30,000, and was created Baron Wolseley of Cairo and Wolseley, though he wanted a viscountcy. Cambridge and the queen, who had been gratified by Wolseley's employment of the duke of Connaught during the campaign, fully acknowledged Wolseley's able victory, but the duke thought it made him too powerful and suggested either a colonial governorship or the lord lieutenancy of Ireland.<br>
<br>Eighteen months after his return from Egypt, Wolseley saw Charles Gordon off to Khartoum and, as soon as the extent of the Mahdist revolt became evident, urged the necessity of a relief expedition. He did not prevail, and his belated appointment to command such an expedition on 1 September 1884 was from the first a forlorn hope, irrespective of the controversy that surrounded Wolseley's choice of following the Nile to Khartoum rather than advancing across the desert from Suakin to Berber, as was counselled by most other advisers to the government. Clearly, Wolseley was heavily influenced by the Red River experience and, indeed, Canadian voyageurs were brought over to handle the 800 special boats used on the Nile. The fall of Berber to the Mahdists in May 1884 and the subsequent difficulties in trying to push a railway out from Suakin tend to suggest the Nile route might have been the better, although this can never now be determined. The expedition was dogged by logistic delays, and, for the first time in his career, Wolseley's conduct of a campaign was limited by the government, which refused to allow him go any further forward than Korti. In any case he could not be everywhere, and, arguably, by maintaining such close control for so long he had hardly encouraged the development of initiative in his subordinates, now riven by mutual animosities. Wolseley was always regarded as a &#145;lucky&#146; general and he himself was to remark that the &#145;sun of his luck&#146; set when Stewart was fatally wounded before Methemmeh. Command of the desert column fell to Wilson, who wasted precious days before embarking on steamers for Khartoum. Wilson reached Khartoum two days too late, on 28 January 1885, but an earlier arrival might merely have hastened the Mahdist assault. Initially Gladstone's government appeared ready to avenge Gordon, but in April it was announced that there would be no further operations in the Sudan. Having reported on the situation at Suakin in May 1885, Wolseley supervised the withdrawal of his own force to Egypt. He returned to England an embittered man in July. It was small consolation to be created a knight of St Patrick and to be elevated to viscount on 19 August 1885 with succession to his daughter.<h2>
<a name="Commanderinchief"></a>Commander-in-chief</h2>As the end of his term as adjutant-general approached there was talk of Wolseley finally going to India, but he firmly declined the possibility on the grounds not only that his daughter was coming out that season but also, and more significantly, because there no longer seemed any real possibility of war against Russia in central Asia. He now hoped for war against France and aimed to succeed Cambridge as commander-in-chief. Aldershot, Gibraltar, and even Australia had also been mentioned, but Wolseley took up the Irish command on 1 October 1890. With more leisure time than at the War Office he was able to indulge his tastes. He tended to dislike society functions yet enjoyed intelligent company, and he and Louisa always had a wide circle of literary and artistic acquaintances. He also contributed articles to periodicals, including a series on Napoleon for the <span class="italic">Pall Mall Magazine</span> in 1894, republished in book form as <span class="italic">The Decline and Fall of Napoleon</span> in the following year. He also began writing a much delayed long-term project, <span class="italic">The Life of John, First Duke of Marlborough</span>, of which two volumes were published in 1894. It remained uncompleted for, on 1 November 1895&#151;he had been created a field marshal on 26 May 1894&#151;Wolseley succeeded Cambridge as commander-in-chief.<br>
<br>His tenure was from the beginning overshadowed by the recommendations of the Hartington commission five years earlier that the post be abolished altogether and replaced by a continental-style chief of staff and a War Office council. Through the opposition of the queen, the duke, and leading Liberals, the proposal was buried, although an emasculated War Office council was established. Wolseley sometimes advocated a soldier as a continental-style minister of defence, but he did not wish his own perceived inheritance diminished. Indeed, he regarded a chief of staff as largely a device to create a role for Brackenbury, who had sat on the commission. As secretary of state after 1892, Campbell-Bannerman produced a modified version of the Hartington scheme, reducing the powers of the commander-in-chief, whose former departmental subordinates would now sit with him on an army board with direct and equal access to the secretary of state. Cambridge was finally eased out but it was Buller, who had succeeded Wolseley as adjutant-general, whom the Liberals intended to become commander-in-chief.<br>
<br>Buller, however, was not acceptable to the Salisbury administration, which suddenly came into office in June 1895, and Wolseley was offered the post. A complication was that the queen wanted her son, Connaught, to succeed her cousin, and at one stage during the incessant manoeuvring of that summer Wolseley had offered to waive his own claims in favour of Connaught and to go as ambassador to Berlin. When presented with a straight choice between Berlin and being commander-in-chief, however, he accepted the latter, with even further diminished powers as laid down in the order in council of 21 November 1895. Wolseley was to remark of his new position that he felt like the &#145;fifth wheel of a coach&#146;, and he strove unsuccessfully to restore what he regarded as the necessary authority of the commander-in-chief over the army's command and discipline. Wolseley's belief that Buller had betrayed him hardly helped the atmosphere within the War Office, and it was made more poisonous still by the new depths of mutual hostility between Wolseley and the politicians as represented by the new secretary of state, Lord Lansdowne, who had a firm preference for Roberts. Little was achieved beyond some increase in military establishments and the revival of the autumn manoeuvres in 1898, but by this time Wolseley's faculties were fading fast, for in 1897 he succumbed to an illness from which he never fully recovered and which badly impaired his memory.<h2>
<a name="Retirementanddeath"></a>Retirement and death</h2>Wolseley could certainly take pride in the efficiency and speed of the army's mobilization for the South African War in October 1899, and was equally justified in regarding the government as foolhardy in ignoring his advice to mobilize earlier. However, the deterioration in his relationship with Lansdowne had contributed to the lack of strategic direction at the beginning of the war, and the success of eventual mobilization paled beside the shock of the defeats of &#145;black week&#146; in December. As a result, Roberts was sent out to supersede Buller as commander-in-chief in South Africa without Wolseley being consulted. Wolseley was persuaded to remain at his post by the queen, finally retiring on 30 November 1900 to be succeeded&#151;to his bitter regret&#151;by Roberts. In many respects, therefore, his career ended unfulfilled, even if he had arguably laid the foundations for further professionalization of the army. Also, through no fault of his own, the Victorian army's &#145;only general&#146; had never endured the supreme test of command in the field against an equal adversary.<br>
<br>In retirement Wolseley published, in 1903, two disappointing volumes of autobiography, <span class="italic">The Story of a Soldier's Life</span>, which took his account only as far as Asante. He was regimental colonel of the Royal Horse Guards from 29 March 1895 to 15 November 1907 and of the Royal Irish from 20 July 1898. He died at the Villa La Tourette at Menton in France on 25 March 1913 and was buried in St Paul's Cathedral, London six days later. His widow died on 10 April 1920 at her grace-and-favour apartment in Hampton Court Palace (where in 1917 she had an oratory created in Wolseley's memory) and, after cremation at Golders Green, her ashes were placed in her husband's grave.<h2>
<a name="Assessment"></a>Assessment</h2>Wolseley's reputation was rapidly eclipsed not only through the greater prominence accorded Lord Roberts immediately prior to the First World War but also through the impact of that war itself on military and other historiography. Sir George Arthur produced in 1922 a bowdlerized and inaccurate edition of Wolseley's correspondence with Lady Wolseley, and two years later, co-operated with Maurice's son, also Frederick, in a biography. This attempted to portray Wolseley as the true architect of the army's ultimate victory in the &#145;great appeal to the arbitrament of the sword&#146;  (Maurice and Arthur, 342), which had eluded Wolseley in his own lifetime. The adulatory approach was largely repeated in the 1964 biography by Joseph Lehmann, <span class="italic">All Sir Garnet</span>, emanating from the 1960s revival of interest in the Victorian army. However, Wolseley was viewed with hostility by the Canadian historian Adrian Preston in editions of his campaign journals for South Africa (1971, 1973) and the Sudan (1967) and in articles over the next decade. Subsequently there has been another revival of interest in the period, and Wolseley has received a more scholarly appraisal which, while recognizing the complexities of his character, reasserted his reputation as the leading British soldier of his generation.<br>
