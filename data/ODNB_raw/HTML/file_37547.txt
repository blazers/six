<span class="headword">Hill,  William</span>  (1903&#150;1971), <span class="occ">bookmaker</span>, was born in Birmingham on 16 July 1903, the second son and fourth of the eleven children (there were also a twin son and daughter who died at birth) of William Hill, journeyman coach-painter, and his wife, Lavinia Knight, the daughter of a farmer who also kept an inn on the border of Warwickshire and Leicestershire.<br>
<br>Hill ran away from school at the age of twelve to work on an uncle's farm. After a short time working for his father he moved to a tool-making factory in Birmingham, where he took up bookmaking in a small way, by collecting bets on his motor bicycle. Shortly afterwards he became a more serious bookmaker, but plunged too heavily at first and lost all his capital. However, he started again in the cheaper rings, and after five years moved to London in 1929.<br>
<br>Hill started betting at greyhound stadiums, then extended to pony-racing at Northolt Park, and in 1934 opened a one-room office in Jermyn Street. He soon moved to much larger premises in Park Lane (and later to even larger offices at Piccadilly Circus in 1947). By 1939 he had given up the dogs and the main business was credit betting, though he was still operating at Northolt Park.<br>
<br>In 1944 Hill produced the first fixed-odds football coupon, and set up a separate football company in 1944. In 1955 he gave up on-course bookmaking. In 1960 his great rivals, Ladbrokes, went into the football business, and Hill sued them for infringement of the copyright in his coupon. The case went to the House of Lords, where Hill won the &pound;1 damages for which he had asked, with costs. In 1954 with Lionel Barber he bought 75 per cent of Holder's Investment Trust, to which he sold his interests between 1955 and 1961 for over &pound;5 million. So successful was the business that Holder's shares rose from 2<i>s</i>. 10<i>d</i>. in 1956 to &pound;18 10<i>s</i>. in 1960. This purchase of a &#145;shell&#146; company was the first time that the manoeuvre had been executed and the first time that a bookmaking company had been floated on the stock exchange.<br>
<br>Hill loathed the idea of betting shops, which were legalized in 1960, but rivals moved in and he followed in 1966. In the same year he reluctantly began to take bets on elections. He did not, as he said on 9 December 1958, when as owner of Be Careful he spoke at the Gimcrack dinner, object to bookmakers paying something towards the racing industry's expenses. However, as he wrote in the following May, it galled him to be expected to do so and still to be refused admission to the members' enclosures at smart meetings.<br>
<br>Hill's first stud was Whitsbury in Hampshire, which he bought in 1943. Nimbus was foaled there in 1946, and, having been sold for 5000 guineas at the yearling sales, won the 1949 Two Thousand Guineas and Derby. In 1945 Hill bought Sezincote stud in Gloucestershire, where he stood his stallion Chanteur II, sire of Pinza, winner of the 1953 Derby.<br>
<br>William Hill was a great bookmaker, who had the courage to take enormous bets. He was an ebullient, sometimes irascible, charming man. In his latter years he took little day-to-day interest in racing, but was seen as an elder statesman of the turf. He had become accustomed to great wealth, but he had a social conscience and may even have considered himself a socialist.<br>
<br>In 1923 Hill married Ivy Burley, a ladies' hairdresser of Smallheath, Birmingham, who survived him. They had one daughter. Hill died in Newmarket on 15 October 1971.<br>
