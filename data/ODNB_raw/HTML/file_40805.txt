<span class="headword">Whitley,  Roger</span>  (1618&#150;1697), <span class="occ">royalist army officer and politician</span>, was the son of Thomas Whitley (<i>d</i>. 1651) of Hawarden in Flintshire and his second wife, Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1668), the daughter of Roger Brereton of Haughton, Flintshire. He entered Christ Church, Oxford, on 29 November 1633 before going to Gray's Inn in 1637. In 1642 he joined the king's forces, serving under his brother-in-law Charles Gerard, later the earl of Macclesfield; by late 1644 he was a colonel and governor of Aberystwyth, which he was forced to surrender in April 1646.<br>
<br>Whitley's two brothers died in the king's cause, but he fought on, joining an abortive Welsh rising and other plots until he was imprisoned briefly in March 1650. He fought at Worcester in 1651 and then spent the 1650s as an enthusiastic royalist conspirator. He had married Charlotte Gerard by 1653 and he worked with his Gerard family connections outside the orbit of the Sealed Knot, the body created to oversee royalist plotting. He played a prominent part in the failed Ship tavern conspiracy, an effort to spark a general rising in early 1654. Within weeks he was plotting again, now leading an attempt to assassinate Cromwell. He continued such work throughout the 1650s&#151;moving constantly between England, Ireland, Wales, the Channel Islands, and the continent. Over time he entered more closely into royal counsels, and by 1657 was a gentleman of the privy chamber. His notebooks from this period reveal a keen interest in contemporary politics, military management, and the techniques of conspiracy, including how one may hide incriminating writings in the body without risking discovery. In 1658, now expert in plotting, he drew up a detailed if unrealistic scheme for organizing royalist forces in England. His chance for insurrection came in August 1659, when he garrisoned Hawarden Castle and led a troop of horse in Booth's rising. After the rising's collapse Whitley gathered more forces and maintained constant contact with the king's advisers, to whom he counselled another rising, until the Restoration in May 1660. He sat for the Flintshire boroughs in the Convention and in each parliament thereafter through 1679, after which he represented Chester.<br>
<br>Whitley now profited from his loyalty, receiving the mastership of a Chester hospital and becoming receiver of royal aids, receiver of the hearth tax, and excise farmer for north Wales; he was also made a gentleman usher of the privy chamber. He lived largely in London in this period. His wife, Charlotte Gerard, died there in 1662 and was buried in Westminster Abbey, before which time she had borne three sons and six daughters. In 1668 Whitley became knight harbinger, the person who managed the king's travels, and from 1672 to 1677 served as deputy postmaster, using his position to improve the post's efficiency. With the income from these offices he began purchasing East India stock in 1671, becoming a company freeman in 1674. But increasingly his cash went into land, especially from 1679 to 1682, when he acquired extensive properties in north Wales and Cheshire. He also bought Peele Hall, outside Chester, where he cultivated a regional political interest.<br>
<br>Whitley was now prominent among supporters of the duke of York's exclusion from the succession. In 1682 he was one of those Chester leaders who entertained the duke of Monmouth during his politically provocative visit there. Whitley's foes alleged that he flirted with sedition in Monmouth's interest; boisterous Chester crowds shouted Whitley's and Monmouth's names together. Whitley enjoyed great popularity, and that autumn was prevented from becoming Chester's mayor only by a voting process that gave final choice to the twenty-four aldermen. Once famously loyal, he was now suspect at court and had lost all preferment there. The final blow came late in 1684 when he was sued for &pound;30,000 that he had not forwarded to royal accounts while postmaster, of which he was later ordered to pay nearly &pound;20,000. Next came an attack on his political base, Chester, where he and his allies lost their offices when local tories, led by Sir Thomas Grosvenor, won a new charter in February 1685 that installed themselves in power in Chester.<br>
<br>When the duke of Monmouth launched his rebellion that summer Whitley dismissed it as &#145;foolish and mad&#146;  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Eng. hist. c. 711, Whitley diary, fol. 36<i>v</i>). A committed Anglican, he was ambivalent about King James's promotion of non-Anglicans to prominence. Along with others Whitley refused to serve when reappointed to Chester's corporation by another new charter in September 1688, though he resumed his alderman's place when the pre-1685 charter was restored the following month. Civil war memories made him doubt the wisdom of the prince of Orange's intended invasion. But he readily accepted the revolution once it occurred and sat in the convention of 1689, having easily beaten Grosvenor for one of Chester's seats. In 1690 Grosvenor defeated Whitley by a handful of votes, though only after Grosvenor's supporters allegedly employed illegal tactics. His petition against the election ended in the Commons deciding by a majority of one to seat Grosvenor instead.<br>
<br>Whitley now set about restoring his political foundations in Chester. At mayoral elections in 1690 and in 1691 he achieved a great majority among the freemen in the early rounds, but lost each time before the aldermen, whose votes concluded the process. In 1692 he at last prevailed. Thus began Whitley's extraordinary efforts to transform the city's constitution to maintain his authority by boosting the power of the freemen, changes he made with the advice of his ally, the city's recorder, Sir William Williams. By these means he held the mayor's chair for four successive years. In 1695, he regained his seat at Westminster by abandoning Williams on the hustings, and joining instead with his old foe, Grosvenor.<br>
<br>In 1696 Whitley gave up the mayoralty, perhaps because of increasing health problems; he attended no more corporation meetings thereafter, though he continued struggles to control the construction of a new city hall, a project begun during his mayoralty. He made the last entry in his diary on 15 July 1697, two days before he died at either Chester or Peele Hall. He was buried at Hawarden church. At the time of his death Whitley and his Chester allies had a petition before the privy council attacking the new mayor for reversing Whitley's popular constitutional changes. He left a large entailed estate principally to his daughter Lady Elizabeth Mainwaring, his son Roger, and their heirs.<br>
<br>Whitley's papers, largely in the Bodleian Library, include numerous notebooks and commonplace books revealing a meticulous and wide-ranging mind. His diary provides a fascinating account of a regional political network by one of its chief members, and suggests a sociable personality, even with those outside his partisan circle. Whitley rarely figured prominently in parliamentary debates and never achieved high office or a knighthood, despite his enormous energy in the royal cause before 1660. But his loyalty helped him obtain a number of lucrative posts, the income from which funded the regional political influence he developed so successfully in later decades.<br>
