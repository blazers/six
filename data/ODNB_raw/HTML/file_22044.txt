<span class="headword">Petowe,  Henry</span>  (1575/6&#150;1636?), <span class="occ">poet</span>, was made free of the Company of Clothworkers on 13 August 1600, so he would have passed a minimum age that was probably twenty-three. He did not inherit his freedom (despite the suggestion of Eccles, 105), for no earlier Petowe appears in the Clothworkers' freedoms' list, which begins in 1528. Neither was he elected to the livery of the Clothworkers' Company. Insights into the clothiers' trade in the 1603 pamphlet <span class="italic">Londoners, their Entertainment in the Countrie</span> indicate that the writer was once active in this trade.<br>
<br>A chancery record dated 1613 contains two autograph signatures of Henrie Petowe, identified as a scrivener thirty-seven years of age of the parish of St Michael, Wood Street  (TNA: PRO, C24/81/74). These match exactly the 1613 signature of a Henrie Petowe identified as a &#145;Clothworker&#146;, who witnessed an obligation  (Corporation of London RO, journal 29, fol. 65; Petowe is identified as clothworker also in the record of this obligation, Corporation of London RO, report 31, fol. 112<i>v</i>; Petowe's slightly different 1618 signature appears on a bond in TNA: PRO, REQ 2/243). Thus the poet, clothworker, and scrivener were one man. Petowe's name does not appear in surviving documents of the Scriveners' Company, but the company's records are not intact (Woudhuysen, 53&#150;4; Guildhall Library, MS 5370).<br>
<br>As a clothworker Petowe was free of the City, and so eligible for the London volunteer infantry company known as the artillery garden. He was admitted to the artillery garden between 15 August and October 1611 and later became marshal  (The vellum book). There is an unascribed note at the Honourable Artillery Company indicating that Petowe was &#145;Marshall T[rained] B[ands] 1622&#150;26&#146;. The writer's work after 1622 is often identified to be by Marshall Petowe.<br>
<br>The poet may have been same Henry Petowe who married Ann Burt on 16 April 1604 at St Bartholomew by the Exchange  (Eccles, 105). But similar names are also found: a different Henrie Petto married Alse Harison on 14 January 1604 at St Bride's, Fleet Street, and a Humphrei Petto married on 12 March 1604, also at St Bride's, Fleet Street.<br>
<br>The parish records of St Michael, Wood Street, show that Henry Petowe, scrivener, with a wife identified from 1616 onwards as Anne, fathered twelve children between 1605 and 1622. At least seven of these died by 1625. Petowe's children were baptized and (where recorded) buried at St Michael's: Richard (<i>bap</i>. 1605, <i>d</i>. 1611); Thomas (<i>bap</i>. 1607); Henry (<i>bap</i>. 1609, <i>d</i>. 1610); Henrye (<i>bap</i>. 1610, <i>d</i>. 1613); Marie (<i>bap</i>. 1612, <i>d</i>. 1625); Anne (<i>bap</i>. 1613, <i>d</i>. in or before 1619?); Benjamin (<i>bap</i>. 1615); Catherine (<i>bap</i>. 1616, <i>d</i>. 1625); Thomas (<i>bap</i>. 1617); Anne (<i>bap</i>. 1619); and Francisse (<i>bap</i>. 1622, <i>d</i>. 1624). In addition, William, son of Henrie Petowe, scrivener, was buried on 4 February 1618. Two daughters and their mother died on 15, 25, and 29 August 1625, probably owing to an outbreak of plague.<br>
<br>Petowe's first publication, <span class="italic">The Second Part of Hero and Leander, Conteyning their Further Fortunes</span> (1598), continued Marlowe's epyllion. An address &#145;To the quicke-sighted Reader&#146; excuses this as &#145;the first fruits of an unripe wit, done at certaine vacant howers&#146;. It begins with high praises of Marlowe, and then describes chivalric adventures leaving many corpses, but a happy ending for the hero and heroine. Leander is exiled on arbitrary charges of treason, a topic with a political edge. Hero's constancy withstands repeated assaults; one makes a villain &#145;hoarse&#146;, and he dies of heartbreak. Leander is not discredited when, in disguise, he tests Hero's chastity. A connection of the text with an image in <span class="italic">Hamlet</span> is proposed by B. L. Joseph. Taylor argues it takes its Ovidian allusions directly from Golding. The text is edited in N. Alexander, <span class="italic">Elizabethan Narrative Verse</span> (1967) and in Stephen Orgel's edition of Marlowe.<br>
<br>Petowe regrets his continuation of Marlowe in a not entirely conventional manner in the introductory matter to his next book, <span class="italic">Philochasander and Elanira</span> (1599). Introductory verses describe the earlier work using images of a &#145;snare&#146;, a &#145;gin&#146;, &#145;the pit&#146;, and &#145;The sinke of misconceite, and errors Cell&#146;. Admitting the late &#145;head-long&#146; fall of his &#145;wandering <i>Muse</i>&#146;, Petowe says his muse now &#145;hath prunde her wings&#146;, and hopes his new effort will &#145;live eternallie&#146;. <span class="italic">Philochasander</span> is dismissed by most nineteenth- and twentieth-century critics (see, for example, Shapiro, 25&#150;6; Zocca, 177, being a partial exception). Yet it is not &#145;prunde&#146;, but more daring. Following an introductory poem, it consists of forty-four poems of eighteen lines. Poem 2, &#145;From <i>Tuskane</i> came my ladies worthy race&#146;, deliberately echoes Surrey (as does most of poem 9), and poem 5 identifies the lady as &#145;<i>White</i> by name&#146;. The sequence becomes erotic from poem 8.<br>
<br>Petowe's next work, <span class="italic">Elizabetha quasi vivens: Eliza's Funerall</span> (1603), is composed of an &#145;Induction&#146;, then eight sonnets, six prose pages listing &#145;the order and formall proceeding at the Funerall&#146;, and a final verse. The fifth sonnet strikingly evokes massed black-clad mourners. The last sonnet names King James.<br>
<br>The queen is lamented also in Petowe's next book, of twenty-three sonnets, <span class="italic">Englands Caesar: his majesties most royall coronation &hellip; Eliza her coronation in heaven; and Londons sorrow for her visitation</span> (1603). The plague of 1603 is attributed to London's sins; the nineteenth sonnet rues James's by-passing of the expensive pageantry put on by the City to receive him, as the king had travelled by water purportedly to avoid infection.<br>
<br>Next appeared <span class="italic">Londoners, their Entertainment in the Countrie</span>, entered as by Henry Petoe on 26 December 1603 (Arber corrects 26 November). This argues that &#145;sin&#146; caused the 1603 plague equally in London, the suburbs, and the countryside. It describes escaping Londoners' poor reception in the country, and paints a lively picture of country towns during the visitation (claiming that, unlike London, the country does not bury its dead). The last section of the book contains two pastoral poems allegorizing the London plague, &#145;An Aelegie&#146;  (sig. C3<i>r</i>&#150;<i>v</i>) and &#145;The Aeglogue&#146;  (sig. C4<i>r</i>), then affectingly realistic reportage of the economic impact of London's disasters on the countryside  (sig. C4<i>r</i>&#150;D1<i>r</i>), and finally a summarizing poem  (sig. D2<i>r</i>&#150;D4<i>r</i>), the sixth stanza of which contains further economic reflections.<br>
<br>The only later longer work of Petowe preserved also concerns a plague year: <span class="italic">The Countrie Ague, or, London her Welcome Home to her Retired Children</span> (1626). Most of the pamphlet is spoken in sorrow by London personified, who enjoins mercy and charity, and sharply condemns Londoners in authority who remained away from their posts when &#145;my Poore cryed out for reliefe&#146;. A penultimate section, including an epitaph, describes the &#145;Funerall of Captaine Richard Robins&#146; to prove the diminished artillery garden company and city authorities were still functioning. The pamphlet followed multiple deaths in Petowe's family (especially closely if the overprinting &#145;1625&#146; in the unique BL copy is accurate), which may account for its softened tone as compared with Petowe's book on the 1603 plague.<br>
<br>In the dedicatory epistle of <span class="italic">The Countrie Ague</span>, Petowe identifies a work, now lost, of &#145;some ten Weekes since&#146; titled <span class="italic">London Sicke at Heart, or, A Caveat for Run-Awayes</span>. This would seem another plague pamphlet, yet Petowe writes that in comparison with it <span class="italic">The Countrie Ague</span> is &#145;in another kinde and Garbe of writing, yet to purpose and according as these dayes and times require &hellip; [for] I write no Fables, nor Imaginary Toyes, but lamentable Experience shall justifie my writ&#146;. This differentiation implies that <span class="italic">London Sicke at Heart</span> was not a work of reportage.<br>
<br>Corser (9.147) claims a bookseller advertised a manuscript: &#145;<span class="italic">A Description of the Countie of Surrey</span>, containing a geographicall account of the said countrey or shyre, with other things thereunto apertaining. Collected and written by Henry Pattowe, 1611.&#146; This is not likely to be by the London Henry Petowe; one or more contemporary Henry Petowes appear in the records of Farnham, Godalming, and Chiddingfold, Surrey.<br>
<br>&#145;Marescallus Petowe&#146; signed a poem in Anthony Munday's edition of Stowe, <span class="italic">The Survey of London</span> (1633, 754&#150;5), &#145;The foundation of the armory of that remarkable nursery of military discipline, called the Artillery Garden London&#146;. This commemorates improvements made between 1 May and 30 November 1622, and is not a separate broadside as sometimes thought. Petowe similarly signed a folio broadsheet preserved uniquely at the Society of Antiquaries entitled <span class="italic">An honourable president for great men by an elegiecall monument to the memory of that worthy gentleman Mr. John Bancks</span> (1630). Mr Banckes, a mercer, had given generously to the artillery garden. The Barber&#150;Surgeons' Company thereafter gave &#145;to Marshall Petoe for his elegies on Mr Banckes his funerall&#146; either 5<i>s</i>. or 10<i>s</i>.  (Young, 211, 398). The following July Petowe was paid 20<i>s</i>. by the Goldsmiths' Company for an elegy on one Mr Crownshawe (now lost).<br>
<br>A broadside signed &#145;Henricus Petowe area militaris Londinensis marciscallus composuit&#146; is headed <span class="italic">The Artillery Garden London, Magnificent and Tryumphant</span> (1635; Bodl. Oxf., Douce prints 6.12, fol. 83). It illustrates a coat of arms newly &#145;assigned to the Gentlemen of the same Societie&#146;. There follow seventy-six couplets. These include recollections of English civil wars that may seem ominous in a poem dedicated to Charles I by a London citizen given to outbreaks of imagination.<br>
<br>Eccles suggests that Petowe later remarried and relocated. One Henry Petowe of the parish of All Hallows, London Wall, and his wife, Mary, baptized Sara on 19 October 1632 and Nycholas on 21 August 1634. In the plague year of 1635&#150;6, first Mary, then Sara, and then Henry Petowe died, on 22 January, 27 September, and 10 October respectively. The administration of the estate of this Henry Petowe is noted in the act book of the archdeaconry court of London  (London, Guildhall Library, MS 9050/7, fol. 10<i>v</i>).<br>
