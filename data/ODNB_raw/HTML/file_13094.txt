<span class="headword">Herries,  John Charles</span>  (1778&#150;1855), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born in November 1778 in London, the eldest son of Charles Herries, merchant, and Mary Ann Johnson. His father was descended from a long line of Dumfriesshire lairds and in the course of his career in London had become colonel of the light horse volunteers, a select and prestigious London defence force that was to have an important bearing on his son's career.<h2>
<a name="Earlylifeagovernmentmanofbusiness"></a>Early life: a government &#145;man of business&#146;</h2>Herries was educated at Cheam and at Leipzig University, becoming proficient in French and German, and returned to London in the first half of 1798 to find that his father was bankrupt. On 5 July 1798 he was appointed a junior clerk in the Treasury at &pound;100 p.a., and in the unusually short space of six months was promoted to a post in the revenue department at three times that salary. How far this swift progress was due to his father's connections in the volunteers is unclear, but there was no doubt about Herries's talents for business and for economics. In 1801 he was employed to draw up for Pitt his counter-resolutions against Tierney's financial proposals, and in 1803 published a pamphlet, <span class="italic">A Reply to some Financial Mistatements in and out of Parliament</span>, which was a riposte to attacks on Addington's government by Lord Grenville and Cobbett. Earlier (in 1802) he had demonstrated other talents by publishing the first of six editions of his translation from Gentz's treatise, <span class="italic">On the state of Europe before and after the French Revolution, being an answer to &#145;L'&eacute;tat de la France &agrave; la fin de l'an VIII&#146;</span>.<br>
<br>By this time Herries had become, in February 1801, the private secretary of Nicholas Vansittart, who, besides being the secretary of the Treasury in Addington's government, was also associated with the volunteers. This was a position he held while Vansittart was in office until March 1807, and it might have led to a customs appointment in Buenos Aires, worth &pound;1000 p.a., had not Lord Grenville's government fallen before it could be implemented. When Vansittart declined to join Portland's government, Herries found himself unemployed. His father therefore wrote on his son's behalf to Perceval, the new chancellor of the exchequer and the honorable treasurer of the volunteers, with the result that Herries became his private secretary at &pound;300 p.a.<br>
<br>It was under Perceval's patronage that Herries began to attract wider notice for his administrative and financial skills. During 1807&#150;9 he produced two short-lived government newspapers with John Wilson Croker, and in October 1809 was entrusted with the unsuccessful negotiations with Vansittart for the latter's accession to the government. In 1810 he did the spadework for the budget presented by Spencer Perceval, who as prime minister appointed him secretary to the chancellor of the Irish exchequer, William Wellesley Pole, in June 1811. His time in Ireland, however, was brief: having refused Wellesley Pole's offer to become a lord of the Irish treasury, he returned to London to be appointed commissary-in-chief with a salary of &pound;2700 (1 October 1811). Perceval had earlier demonstrated his faith in Herries's services by having him appointed to the lucrative and influential sinecure of secretary and registrar to the Order of the Bath (January 1809), and in July 1811 recommended him to the regent for an appointment that he never took up&#151;the comptroller of army accounts&#151;on the grounds that he was &#145;one of the best men of business&#146; that he knew  (Perceval to the prince regent, 16 July 1811, <span class="italic">Correspondence of George, Prince of Wales</span>, 8.46&#150;7).<br>
<br>Herries's career in the high-profile role of commissary consolidated his reputation. The main problems he faced were the corruption and inefficiency attendant on supplying the troops in the Peninsula. Building on the work of his predecessor, Herries tackled them with enthusiasm and skill, referring on one occasion to his having found his &#145;natural place&#146;, which was &#145;in the working class of politicians&#146;  (Gray, 326). Tests in English and mathematics were established to select new clerks, and the staff at headquarters in Great George Street grew to 53, with 20 commissaries-general and 1000 clerks serving at home and abroad. How far he was successful in a post that he held until October 1816 has been a matter of debate. In the case of three aspects of his work&#151;the running of his department, the rooting out of corruption, and the settlement of subsidy payments to the allies&#151;there has been no dispute. Herries was exceptionally able in all three fields, particularly in the settlement of subsidies amounting to the enormous sum of &pound;42.5 million, half of which was handled by Nathan Meyer Rothschild and most of which was paid, for the first time, in advantageous foreign currencies. There has been some debate, however, about the supplies of cash to Wellington's armies. Napier, following Wellington himself, alleged that the armies' operations had been restricted by lack of specie, but more recent writers have judged that Wellington never appreciated Herries's difficulties in this department and that the latter's efforts did improve, most notably when he formed a plan with Rothschild at the end of 1813 to provide the army with French specie. Thus although the judgement that Herries was &#145;the unsung Carnot of Whitehall&#146;  (Gray, 330) may be an exaggeration, the sensible conclusion is that Herries's work was an important and largely neglected aspect of the war effort. It was certainly seen as such by the government when the office was abolished after the war (24 October 1816), Herries being complimented in word and deed, the latter taking the form of a pension of &pound;1350 and the new post of auditor of the civil list. In 1817 Vansittart, the chancellor of the exchequer, went so far as to claim in the Commons that the great allied push of 1812&#150;13 had depended on his friend's efforts.<br>
<br>Although his marriage on 8 February 1814 to Sarah, a daughter of John Dorington, clerk of the fees of the House of Commons, had been within his own social class, Herries was now moving in powerful circles and forging connections which caused some controversy. The friendship with Vansittart, and earlier Perceval, associated him with the evangelical and intemperate wing of the tory party and, more particularly, with Vansittart's economic thinking, which in its opposition to the resumption of cash payments and a bi-metallic currency was the reverse of Huskisson's, the most influential political economist of the post-war era. Moreover the collaboration with Rothschild and the fact that his brother owned a bank suggested that he had strong interests in the City, while being secretary to the Order of the Bath and auditor of the civil list meant that he was in frequent contact with the regent and his influential secretary, Sir William Knighton.<br>
<br>For the moment these associations did not interrupt his career as &#145;a man of business&#146;. On 27 February 1821 he suffered the personal tragedy of the death of his wife (who had borne three sons, including the financier <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13093/', "Sir Charles John Herries")</script>, and three daughters), but in July of that year he was appointed a member of the commission of inquiry into the Irish revenue and wrote the report (28 June 1822) which was the basis for the eventual amalgamation of the British and Irish revenue services. This provided the impetus for his elevation to high office. Thus, when the financial secretaryship of the Treasury became vacant in that year Charles Arbuthnot, the patronage secretary, having consulted Canning and checked with Huskisson, recommended Herries as the replacement, and Lord Liverpool agreed to the appointment in February 1823. In the same month he was returned as a colleague of Canning's for the Treasury borough of Harwich and some time that year took a lease on Montreal, Lord Amherst's seat near Sevenoaks, while the latter was in India (1823&#150;8). By that time he had resigned his secretaryship of the Order of the Bath.<h2>
<a name="IntoparliamentCanningsministryandthefallofGoderich18231828"></a>Into parliament: Canning's ministry and the fall of Goderich, 1823&#150;1828</h2>Although he made no mark as a speaker, Herries played an important background role in the development of free-trade policies in Liverpool's government. One of his achievements was the consolidation of the customs laws and another was an engineered revival in the Lancashire silk industry. In general, the leading authority on the subject argues that he did as much to advance free trade in these years as Robinson, the president of the Board of Trade, although always with pragmatic as opposed to ideological motives  (Hilton, 183&#150;4). On the other hand, he was unable to shake off the faint whiff of scandal generated by his friendship with Rothschild and Knighton. Suspicious minds therefore worked overtime when Herries proposed that the banking crisis of 1825&#150;6 was best dealt with by an inflationary policy that included the Bank of England and City financiers buying exchequer bills in the market place to keep them at a premium. The back-bench tory squires, who distrusted the City, were also alarmed, remembering, perhaps, that Herries had argued since 1819 for the re-establishment of a property tax.<br>
<br>In the first few months of 1827 Herries was beginning to feel the strain of what he called his &#145;laborious vocation&#146;  (Herries to Knighton, 27 Feb 1827, <span class="italic">Letters of George IV</span>, 3.200). He continued in the same office in the government that Canning formed in April, but in July asked to resign his post for one with fewer duties as a result of ill health. Canning agreed, asking him to delay until a successor could be found, but must have been disappointed, as Herries had earlier outlined an imaginative economic recovery plan which included revisions to the hallowed Sinking Fund, drastic reductions in expenditure, and the setting up of a Commons' finance committee to recommend such reductions. Indeed there are some grounds for thinking that Canning wanted to promote Herries to the chancellorship. He nevertheless had Herries appointed in the interim as one of the commissioners for supervising the restoration of Windsor Castle.<br>
<br>It was at this point that Canning died. By this time the king had become, of necessity, the guardian of the fragile coalition government that Canning had formed out of his own followers, the pro-Catholic tories and the Lansdowne whigs. He therefore asked Goderich to stay in office and become prime minister and, having failed to persuade Sturges Bourne to become chancellor of the exchequer, accepted Goderich's suggestion that Herries take the post, arguing later that he understood Canning to have regarded him as the best man to deal with the economic situation. The offer, which was accompanied by Herries's appointment to the privy council (17 August), created a storm of public controversy, the terms of which would have destroyed lesser men. No one questioned that Herries, to quote Lansdowne's acolyte, James Abercromby, was &#145;an excellent man of business&#146;  (Abercromby to Huskisson, 26 Aug 1827, BL, Add. MS 38750, fols. 95&#150;6), but there was a widespread feeling, especially among the coalition whigs, that his connections in the City and at Windsor would make him a Trojan horse for Rothschild and the king, and that this was sufficient to disqualify him. Tories also greeted the prospective appointment with alarm; Arbuthnot referred to the narrowness of his &#145;mind&#146;  (Arbuthnot to Peel, 15 Aug 1827, BL, Add. MS 40340, fol. 174), and others asked what would happen if Huskisson, the leader of the Commons, was unwell, and Herries, who was regarded as a poor speaker, had to fill his shoes.<br>
<br>Herries, for his part, initially pleaded ill health and noted that the chancellorship was &#145;far above my pretensions and so much beyond my wishes&#146;  (Herries, <span class="italic">Memoir</span>, 2.51). He therefore urged Goderich to appoint Huskisson to the post&#151;the man with whom he had been most at loggerheads over economic policy. This, together with the whigs' objections, led the prime minister to search for an alternative, but as his efforts became increasingly confused the king's determination in favour of Herries hardened, with the result that he was appointed on 3 September 1827. The controversy, however, did not end there. While Herries prepared his first budget, in which he apparently decided to include a property tax, a quarrel broke out over the appointment of a chairman of the projected finance committee. In November, without any prior consultation with Herries, and at Tierney's instigation, Goderich and Huskisson agreed to the nomination of Lord Althorp, one of the leading non-coalition whigs, as chairman. Herries resented this slight and insisted upon resigning if Althorp was placed in the chair, while Huskisson said he would do likewise if Althorp was not appointed. The real point of controversy was what happened next&#151;an issue complicated by Goderich's confused negotiations and by the prime minister's decision to provide a place in the cabinet for Lord Holland, a non-coalition whig detested by the king. On two points all sides are agreed: first, that Herries stated on 28 December that he would resign if the policy or the composition of the government abandoned or compromised the principles of Lord Liverpool's administration&#151;a statement that was taken to mean opposition to Althorp as finance committee chairman and to Holland as a cabinet member; and, second, that it was over this issue that Goderich resigned. Herries's view, which was articulated at length in the Commons the following year, was that the circumstances justified his action. Huskisson, however, detected a plot by the king to use &#145;his&#146; chancellor to bring the government down, and argued that Herries changed his mind on the Althorp affair, having agreed to his appointment prior to the overtures to Lord Holland. Moreover, a leading authority has recently alleged that Rothschild and other financiers were becoming nervous about what a finance committee might recommend, and in December put pressure on Herries to put his foot down over the chairmanship  (Hilton, 243&#150;5).<br>
<br>In the current state of the evidence, it is not possible to add to this account. Given Herries's modesty and his practical abilities as a man of business, it seems unlikely that he was ever party to a plot by either the king or Rothschild. On the other hand, it is quite conceivable that, being new to the feverish state of high politics, he allowed the king's views and the fears of Rothschild to play a part in his thinking without fully realizing the capital that could be made out of it. Goderich's ineptitude and Huskisson's paranoia could also not have helped matters.<h2>
<a name="Cabinetministerandoppositionfrontbencher18301853"></a>Cabinet minister and opposition front-bencher, 1830&#150;1853</h2>The immediate effect of Herries's action was the formation of Wellington's government and his own appointment to the cabinet as master of the Royal Mint, Huskisson insisting that the price of his own inclusion was that Herries should not be chancellor. From this undemanding position he advised the government generally on economic policy and supervised the proceedings of the finance committee on its behalf. Although there is no conclusive evidence, the likelihood is that his advice played a part in the government's decisions to cut military expenditure and to abandon the Sinking Fund; and he certainly wrote the financial statement which accompanied the committee's fourth report, on which Sir James Graham commented that it made the public accounts &#145;intelligible&#146; for the first time. In February 1830 he added the presidency of the Board of Trade to his portfolio and was disappointed when the cabinet decided not to introduce a property tax as part of its budget that year&#151;the third plank of the recovery programme that he had put to Canning. Moreover his stock fell as his weaknesses as a speaker became more apparent, with Arbuthnot remarking in July that he would be better employed below cabinet level.<br>
<br>Following the government's resignation in November 1830, Herries spent the next two years using his considerable managerial skills to re-establish the tories as an effective force. Initially he managed relations with the press and later established the party meeting-place in Charles Street, which was the precursor of the Carlton Club. In addition he was said to have taken the initiative in framing the motion on the timber duties in March 1831 that foreshadowed the defeat of Grey's government and the calling of the 1831 general election; and in January and July 1832 he moved a series of resolutions condemning the Russian-Dutch loan which, coming from such a knowledgeable source, inflicted considerable damage on the government.<br>
<br>The important role that Herries played in refashioning the tories as the Conservative Party was one of the reasons why Peel appointed him secretary at war in his short-lived 1834&#150;5 ministry, although the fact that the army estimates which he framed for 1835 were lower than any voted since 1793 was an indication of his fitness for the post from a political angle. Thereafter, he cut an increasingly influential figure in the Commons&#151;the theatre in which he had not previously shone. He was a prominent member of the select committee on metropolitan improvements and wrote the greater part of the second report for 1838. He also played an important part in debate during 1840&#150;41 as a trenchant critic of the whigs' financial and commercial policies. His efforts, however, were not rewarded. At the 1841 general election he was unable to continue as candidate for Harwich, as a result of the Treasury influence wielded by the whigs, and was defeated in his candidature for Ipswich. Moreover, although Peel would have put him in the cabinet at one point, Herries declined an opportunity to be returned for Ripon, preferring by that stage to be consulted unofficially, as he was over the introduction of the income tax.<br>
<br>Herries was returned for Stamford as a protectionist in the 1847 election and, although he was now nearly seventy, his reputation as an economist was such that he quickly became one of the troika that shared the leadership of the party in the Commons, the other two being Disraeli and Lord Granby. It was in that capacity that he made a major speech in 1849 against the repeal of the navigation laws, Lord Stanley reporting that he spoke &#145;very slowly, sometimes hesitating, his voice feeble, but he made every argument tell upon the House&#146;  (Vincent, 5). In February 1851 Derby offered him the chancellorship of the exchequer in a government he failed to construct, and twelve months later said that his presence in another cabinet he was attempting to form was &#145;indispensably necessary&#146;  (memorandum, 23 Feb 1852, appended to Herries's letter to Lord Derby of the same date, Herries MSS). On this occasion, however, Derby wanted Disraeli as chancellor, and offered Herries the Colonial Office or the Board of Trade. Herries responded by saying that if he could not have the office for which he and the public felt he was qualified&#151;the chancellorship&#151;he would prefer one &#145;with small labour and responsibility&#146;  (Herries to Derby, 23 Feb 1852, Herries MSS). He therefore agreed to be president of the Board of Control&#151;the position he held until the government fell in December 1852. He was returned again for Stamford at the general election of 1852 but retired from parliament at the end of the session the following year, his last speech (11 July 1853) being made on the <span class="roman">Government of India Bill</span>. He died suddenly at St Julians, near Sevenoaks, Kent, on 24 April 1855, and was buried in the family vault there.<h2>
<a name="Assessment"></a>Assessment</h2>Until comparatively recently assessments of Herries have focused on the controversy surrounding his holding of the chancellorship in Goderich's administration and, to a lesser extent, on the criticisms levelled by Wellington over supplying his Peninsular army with cash. A broader and more favourable view is taken now. It is therefore clear that he played a significant role in politics for more than fifty years, his most notable contributions being the reform of the commissariat in 1809&#150;12, the settlement on favourable terms of the huge subsidy payments to the allies in the fourth coalition, the advancing of free trade in the 1820s, the reorganization of toryism during the reform period, and almost continuously (and well into his seventies) the giving of expert and pragmatic advice on the economy. This was no mean achievement for someone born a member of the professional classes. The last words can be left to his political opponent, Lord Brougham, who on Herries's retirement from parliament wrote that Alexander Baring, Lord Ashburton (1774&#150;1848), the banker, had told him that &#145;you were, of all the men he had ever seen in the finance department, and I think he added, transacted business with, by far the most competent&#146;  (Herries, <span class="italic">Memoir</span>, 2.277).<br>
