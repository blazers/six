<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Smythe,  Patricia Rosemary <span class="st"> [Pat]</span></span>  (1928&#150;1996), <span class="occ">showjumper</span>, was born on 22 November 1928 at 24 Shotfield Avenue, East Sheen, London, the only daughter and youngest of three children of Captain Eric Hamilton Smythe (1886&#150;1945), civil engineer and businessman, and his wife, Frances Monica (1904&#150;1952), daughter of the Revd Frank Curtoys. Both parents were from families of well-established lineage, and Eric Smythe, an executive director of an electrical engineering firm, had been decorated in the First World War. The Smythes' first child, Dickie, had died in infancy, and Pat grew up with her parents and elder brother, Ronald. In the early 1930s the family moved a short distance to a larger house, Beaufort, on the edge of Barnes Common, where under her mother's tuition Pat learned riding skills on her pony Pixie. She attended several schools: Oakhill, Wimbledon; Downe House, Newbury; Ferne House, Dorset, and later Fonthill Abbey, Wiltshire; Pate's Grammar School, Cheltenham; St Michael's, Cirencester; and Talbot Heath, Bournemouth. Though she later claimed that the family was &#145;far from wealthy&#146;  (Smythe, <span class="italic">Jump for Joy</span>, 21), they enjoyed a comfortable middle-class life until her father's deteriorating health and eventual death early in 1945 brought on more straitened circumstances.<br>
<br>Through the enthusiasm and knowledge of her mother, a trainer of polo ponies, Pat Smythe developed the understanding and love of horses that determined her career. An outstanding junior showjumper, who tied for first place in her group at the Royal Richmond show of 1939, she became fully immersed in the world of horses and showjumping during the Second World War, when she moved to the west country to live with farming friends and relatives. Her parents subsequently settled at Crickley Lodge near Cheltenham, an area with which Pat maintained connections for the rest of her life. The war years were a formative period that served so to develop her riding skills at local horse shows and gymkhanas that by 1947 her performance at the first international horse show at the White City won her selection to the British team, a status she maintained throughout the remainder of a career that continued until 1963. Riding initially her own horses, Finality, Tosca, and Prince Hal, which she trained with her mother, and then other owners' horses&#151;Flanagan, Mr Pollard, and Scorchin' being the most celebrated&#151;Pat Smythe, assisted by her groom Pauline Sykes, won a succession of showjumping's prestige individual and team events throughout the world. Among her many honours were leading showjumper of the year (1949), the European championship on four occasions between 1957 and 1961, the celebrated gold button of Algiers (1955), and the British Jumping Derby championship at Hickstead (1962). She was the first woman showjumper to represent Great Britain at the Olympic games in 1956, the year in which she was appointed OBE, and was a member of the British team again at the Rome Olympics in 1960. This, together with her autobiography <span class="italic">Jump for Joy</span> (1954) and her writing for the <span class="italic">Daily Express</span>, ensured that she was a household name, both in Britain and in much of the rest of the world, during the 1950s.<br>
<br>The peak of Smythe's career coincided with the emergence of television. Her youth, charm, physical courage, and conventional good looks gave her an appeal that was decisive in transforming a previously &eacute;lite and largely male sport, with strong military associations, into a popular media spectacle. Her success made it possible for other women riders to progress in the sport, so that what had been an exception when she herself was first making her way was to become commonplace by the late 1960s. She possessed few material advantages or privileges. In spite of help from wealthy family and friends, after her father's death she and her mother earned their living by teaching riding and taking in guests at their home in Miserden, a house with stables on which her mother took a lease in 1949. The early death of her mother in a road accident in 1952 left Pat to manage and finance her showjumping career single-handedly. Her progress became an object lesson in surmounting obstacles through hard work, self-discipline, and determination, a central theme in her final autobiography, <span class="italic">Leaping Life's Fences</span> (1992). She thus became not only an icon of a more egalitarian Britain, but a precursor of the liberated female of the 1960s. Completely devoid of airs and graces&#151;&#145;she had absolutely no side&#146;, according to BBC executive Peter Dimmock  (<span class="italic">The Guardian</span>, 29 Feb 1996)&#151;she seemed to embody the triumph of the &#145;ordinary woman&#146;. Her popularity was especially marked among countless young girls, for whom she wrote popular adventure stories (the <span class="italic">Three Jays</span> series) about children and horses.<br>
<br>In 1963 Pat Smythe gave up her sport to marry, on 10 September, a friend she had known since her late 'teens, the divorced Swiss lawyer and businessman (Alphons) Samuel (Sam) Koechlin (1924/5&#150;1985), son of Hartmann Koechlin, chemist. They set up home in Switzerland and had two children, Monica and Lucy. For some twenty years Pat accompanied her husband, a representative of the chemical firm Ciba-Geigy, on business trips around the world, during which she promoted the causes of wildlife and environmental protection. Connections with showjumping were maintained. She served as <i>chef d'&eacute;quipe</i> of British teams, and from 1983 to 1986 as president of the British Showjumping Association. Before the age of forty, however, she had suffered severe hip problems, partly as a consequence of riding accidents; she developed the osteoarthritis that had afflicted her father and, subsequently, osteoporosis and heart problems. Following the death of her husband from cancer in 1985 she returned to live at her English home, Sudgrove House in the Cotswolds, maintaining her activities in the fields of conservation, travel, and the arts until her death at Standish Hospital, Standish, Gloucestershire, from heart failure on 27 February 1996.<br>
