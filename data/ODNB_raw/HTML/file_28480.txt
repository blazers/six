<span class="headword">Walker,  George</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1777), <span class="occ">privateer</span>, is of unknown origins. As a boy and a young man he served in the Dutch navy and was employed in the Levant, apparently for the protection of trade against Turkish or Greek pirates. Later he became the owner of a merchant ship and commanded her for some years. In 1739 he was principal owner and commander of the <i>William</i> (20 guns and only 32 men), trading from London to South Carolina. The Carolina coast was heavily populated by Spanish privateers, and in the absence of a British man-of-war Walker put the <i>William</i> at the service of the colonial government. His offer was accepted, whereupon he increased the crew to 130 and presently succeeded in driving the Spaniards off the coast. In late 1742 he sailed for England with three merchantmen in convoy, but his ship foundered in a December gale. On his eventual arrival in London he learned that his agents had allowed the insurance to lapse and that he was a ruined man.<br>
<br>The following year Walker was master of the <i>Russia Merchant</i>, trading to the Baltic. With the outbreak of war with France in 1744 he was offered the command of the <i>Mars</i>, a private ship of war of 26 guns, to cruise in company with another, the <i>Boscawen</i>, somewhat larger and belonging to the same owner. They sailed from Dartmouth in November, and in early January 1745 encountered two homeward-bound French ships of the line, which captured the <i>Mars</i> after the <i>Boscawen</i> had hurriedly deserted her. Walker was sent as prisoner in the <i>Fleuron</i>. On 6 January the two ships and their prize were sighted by a British squadron of four ships of the line, including the <i>Sunderland</i> (Captain John Brett), the <i>Captain</i> (Thomas Griffin), and the <i>Hampton Court</i> (Savage Mostyn). The four British ships now divided, with two giving chase but failing to engage the Frenchmen, who escaped to safety at Brest. The crews of the <i>Fleuron</i> and <i>Neptune</i>, though sickly and depleted, were jubilant and boastful at their escape from the controversial British action. At Brest, Walker was landed as a prisoner at large and was exchanged within a month. On his return to England he was put in command of the <i>Boscawen</i> and sent out in company with the <i>Mars</i>, which had been recaptured and bought by her former owners. In this cruise Walker met another privateer, the <i>Sheerness</i>, and agreed to sail in company. Next day, north-west of Cape Finisterre, they sighted eight homeward-bound West Indiamen under the French flag. Walker boldly attacked them, sank one, and with the aid of the <i>Sheerness</i> captured five, which were safely brought to Bristol. On a second cruise, coming into the channel in December the weakly built <i>Boscawen</i> almost fell to pieces, and was preserved to be run ashore near St Ives, on the Cornish coast, only through Walker's exertions. His conduct was widely reported in London, with the result that he was almost immediately offered a much more important command.<br>
<br>Walker now left the employ of his Dartmouth owners, following an offer from a London syndicate who had formed a squadron to attack the powerful ships increasingly employed by France and Spain to bring their cargoes across the Atlantic. This force, known collectively as the Royal Family, had already achieved one notable success; Walker was to have the command of what proved to be the culminating effort of British privateering. The squadron, comprising four ships&#151;the <i>King George</i>, <i>Prince Frederick</i>, <i>Duke</i>, and <i>Princess Amelia</i>&#151;carried an aggregate of 121 guns and 970 men. Its prestige was very high, for in the summer of 1745, off Louisbourg, it had made an enormously rich prize that, after the owners' share of &pound;700,000 had been deducted, yielded &pound;850 to each seaman, and to the officers in proportion. After cruising for nearly a year and having made prizes well in excess of &pound;200,000 the Royal Family put into Lisbon; they sailed again in July 1747, and had watered in Lagos Bay, when on 6 October the Spanish ship <i>Glorioso</i> (70 guns) was sighted standing in towards Cape St Vincent. Walker rightly assumed that she had treasure and boldly attacked her in the <i>King George</i>, a 32-gun frigate. In an action of several hours' duration, in smooth water and fine weather, the <i>King George</i> was nearly beaten; but on the <i>Prince Frederick</i>'s coming up, the <i>Glorioso</i> fled to the westward, where she was met and engaged by the <i>Dartmouth</i>, a king's ship of 50 guns that accidentally blew up, with the loss of all but one of her crew. Some hours later the 80-gun <i>Russell</i> brought the <i>Glorioso</i> to action and succeeded in taking her. Only half-manned, the <i>Russell</i> was largely dependent on the privateers to take the prize into the Tagus. The Royal Family then continued cruising, but with moderate success owing to the absence of enemy shipping, until the end of the war; none the less the total prizes taken by the four ships under Walker's command were valued at about &pound;400,000.<br>
<br>Walker is generally regarded as the most successful British privateer. He was evidently a good and resourceful seaman, who rose to the occasion and won his crews' regard by taking care of them, although he maintained strict discipline, and exercised his men both physically and in evolutions and in gunnery. Further, he always carried a number of musicians on board. It is unfortunate that so little is known of him. After the treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle he involved himself in the venture of the Society of the Free British Fishery and carried out surveys of the Orkneys and of the Hebrides in its interest. But the syndicate that owned the Royal Family proved none too scrupulous and refused to admit his expenses and delayed settling his claims, and indeed those of his crews. Eventually he was imprisoned for debt and then declared bankrupt, and was released only after four years. Little is known of his subsequent life; he died on 20 September 1777 at Seething Lane, in the City of London, and was buried at All Hallows Barking, Great Tower Street, London.<br>
