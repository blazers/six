<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Bourgeois, Sir  (Peter) Francis</span>  (1756&#150;1811), <span class="occ">landscape painter and founder of the Dulwich Picture Gallery</span>, was given to obfuscation and romance where his origins were concerned; but he was born in London, the son of Issac Bourgeois (<i>b</i>. 1707/8), who was of Swiss descent, and his wife, Elizabeth Gardin (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1766), an Englishwoman presumably of Huguenot stock. Issac was a watchmaker in St Martin's Lane, who, Benjamin West told Joseph Farington, left England on the death of his wife, abandoning both the young Francis and his sister. Bourgeois told Farington (who, like West, was a friend) that he was looked after by his future dealing partner Noel Desenfans from the age of ten, his sister being sent to Switzerland. However, Bourgeois's account may not be accurate, given Desenfans's circumstances about 1766, but it does seem certain that Bourgeois was under Desenfans's care from about 1776. He lived thereafter with Desenfans and his wife, Margaret Morris.<br>
<br>Desenfans arranged for Bourgeois to be taught by P. J. de Loutherbourg, whose style of painting he adopted, although hardly justifying his own aim &#145;to attain Mr. Loutherbourg in execution, Mr. Gainsborough in colour and Mr. [Richard] Wilson in forms and grandeur&#146;  (Whitley, 2.142). In 1776, as part of his training, Desenfans sent Bourgeois on a tour of France, the Netherlands, Italy, and Switzerland. The grand design, of forming an important artist out of a minimal talent, culminated in Bourgeois's election first as an associate of the Royal Academy (1787) and then as an academician (1793), following much &#145;puffing&#146; in the press orchestrated by Desenfans and the lavish entertainment of academicians. The campaign was lent weight by the award in 1791 of a knighthood (or its equivalent) to Bourgeois by Stanis&#322;aw August, king of Poland, who made him his official painter. The knighthood came about through a visit of Prince Michael Poniatowski, the king of Poland's brother, to London in 1790, when he asked Desenfans to devote himself to creating a major art collection for the king. The title was recognized in the same year by George III, who appointed Bourgeois his landscape painter in 1794. Between 1779 and 1810 Bourgeois exhibited 103 pictures at the Royal Academy (and five at the British Institution). Contemporaries were by no means always impressed with his work, but he was evidently charming in a dandiacal way: the poet and critic Leigh Hunt said of him: &#145;His oath and buckskin would never allow me to consider him a serious person&#146;  (Waterfield, 17).<br>
<br>Bourgeois and Desenfans were very much a dealing partnership, even though Bourgeois was &#145;officially&#146; a painter first and foremost, and Desenfans liked to pretend that his pictures were merely the collection of a gentleman. They were busy as dealers in the 1780s and, after 1786, when the household moved to 38 and 39 Charlotte Street, Portland Place (now Hallam Street), they might hang as many as 360 important pictures, with no fewer than fourteen Poussins in the dining-room. The Polish collection was the high point of their dealing activities but also very nearly their downfall. In 1795 Poland was partitioned, Stanis&#322;aw abdicated, and Desenfans and Bourgeois had 180 paintings suddenly &#145;in stock&#146;, after an outlay, so Desenfans claimed, of &pound;9000.<br>
<br>An auction of the Polish paintings held in 1802 was not a success. In any case, Bourgeois was intent upon keeping many of the Polish pictures, as well as others acquired from such sales as that held in 1795 (handled by Desenfans) of pictures from the important collection of Charles-Antoine de Calonne, including Poussin's <span class="italic">Triumph of David</span> and Rembrandt's <span class="italic">Portrait of a Young Man</span>. Bourgeois, Desenfans complained, continued to buy pictures &#145;like a child who wishes for everything in a toy shop&#146;  (Waterfield, 22). When, however, Desenfans died in 1807 he left all the pictures to Bourgeois, and the rest of his property to Bourgeois and his widow. It sheds credit on both that they seem to have worked harmoniously from then on to keep the collection intact, aiming to make it freely available to the public.<br>
<br>Although Bourgeois stated late in life that these were the wishes of Desenfans, they were more probably his own. In 1810 he unsuccessfully tried to buy the freehold of the house in Charlotte Street so that the house &#145;may be gratuitously open to artists as well as to the publick&#146;  (Waterfield, 22). By December that year, according to Farington, the British Museum's unpredictable &#145;aristocracy&#146; had turned him against that institution as a possible destination. In his will he therefore left over 350 pictures to Mrs Desenfans on condition that she left them in turn to Dulwich College. Bourgeois was prompted to make his will after suffering a fall from his horse on 20 December 1810; he died, unmarried, on 8 January 1811.<br>
<br>The Bourgeois bequest included, as something of a poisoned chalice, twenty-one of his own pictures, wildly disparate in subject matter and handling (from <span class="italic">William Tell</span> to <span class="italic">Tobias and the Angel</span>, <span class="italic">A Tiger Hunt</span>, portraits, and landscapes) but uniformly bad in quality. Bourgeois also left an endowment for the collection of &pound;10,000, and &pound;2000 to create a new gallery at Dulwich College after Mrs Desenfans's death. She, however, wanted work to start at once &#145;to see the wishes and intentions of her dear Friend Sir Francis Bourgeois carried into effect&#146;  (Waterfield, 27), and to give the pictures to the college as soon as a gallery was ready. With her additional financial help, a gallery designed by Sir John Soane (as Bourgeois had wished) was swiftly built, incorporating a mausoleum (as had initially been erected in 1807 by Soane for Desenfans's body at the back of the Charlotte Street house). In March 1815 Bourgeois was interred in the mausoleum within the Dulwich Picture Gallery, together with both the Desenfanses. And so in death, as in life, &#145;they were not divided&#146;.<br>
