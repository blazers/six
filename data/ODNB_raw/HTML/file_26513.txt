<span class="headword">Stewart,  Walter</span>, first Lord Blantyre  (<em>d.</em> 1617), <span class="occ">judge and administrator</span>, was the eldest son of Sir John Stewart of Minto, provost of Glasgow, and his second wife, Margaret, second daughter of James Stewart of Cardonald. The Minto lairds had a long history of service to the nation, including an ancestor who fell at Flodden in 1513. As a younger son of a protestant noble family who could claim kinship to the royal house, Walter was raised with James VI under the rigorous tutelage of George Buchanan during the 1570s. It was largely upon this set of circumstances that the career of Walter Stewart was founded.<br>
<br>By 1580 Stewart had become commendator of the priory of Blantyre by royal gift; the priory's lands were just outside Glasgow, where the Minto branch of the Stewart family exerted great influence. James VI further rewarded his schoolmate in 1580 by appointing him one of the gentlemen of the chamber. Calderwood records that Stewart signed the second confession of faith on 28 January 1581. He became a privy councillor on 14 November 1582 and was also made keeper of the privy seal following the death of George Buchanan on 28 September 1582. He became also an assessor to the treasurer on 26 April 1583 and tutor to the duke of Lennox. On 29 July 1583 he received a grant of the lands of Calderhall and on 3 November 1587 of the lands and barony of Glasgow. Although he attended at court during the 1580s and early 1590s, he spent much of his time administering his estates and attending to family matters. On 28 May 1593 he became a judge extraordinary of the court of session, the highest civil court in Scotland; extraordinary judgeships were not uncommonly held by noblemen not necessarily trained in law, and Stewart's holding of a recently defunct ecclesiastic office, and his kinship to the king, undoubtedly helped to justify his appointment.<br>
<br>In January 1596 Stewart was appointed one of the eight commissioners of the treasury, known as Octavians; Stewart acted as unofficial chancellor for this group until he was appointed royal treasurer on 6 March 1596, when he resigned the office of the privy seal. James VI ended his experiment of the Octavian administration in January 1597, but Stewart retained the office of treasurer. He was also comptroller between January and December 1597. In December 1597 he assigned the financial responsibilities of the treasurership to Thomas Foulis, goldsmith and financier, but the scheme collapsed in January 1598 when the king failed to meet his obligations to Foulis; Stewart then resumed office. On 18 January 1599 he received a charter of the barony of Blantyre, Wrightslands, and Cardonald.<br>
<br>In March 1599 Stewart was caught up in a dispute between James VI and the outspoken presbyterian minister Robert Bruce. A month earlier the king had revoked a pension held by Bruce, who sought redress before the court of session. Stewart was among the judges who decided the case in Bruce's favour, a triumph for judicial independence, despite the king's overt efforts to influence the proceedings. James VI's ire over the case fell disproportionately on Stewart, who was placed under ward in Edinburgh Castle and ordered to resign his offices; Stewart refused to resign as treasurer until all amounts owed to him by the king (in excess of &pound;18,000 Scots) were paid. Treasurers to the Stewart kings often undertook significant personal liabilities in connection with the execution of that office, frequently collecting these obligations over a period of years following their official service. By April 1599 the king ordered Stewart to be sent to Inverness as a prisoner, and he was finally compelled to resign as treasurer on 17 April, whereupon he was released and attended a meeting of the privy council on 17 May, during preparations for a convention of the estates. Alexander, master of Elphinstone, succeeded Stewart as both treasurer and as judge of the court of session. However, Stewart appears to have been quickly reconciled to the king and he remained a member of the privy council, with his absence expressly excused for the period from 24 May to 1 November 1599, although in fact he reappears in council records regularly from July. On 11 March 1600 an act was passed confirming the financial obligations (determined to be &pound;7000 Scots upon settlement of accounts) owed to Stewart and recognizing his long and faithful service.<br>
<br>In 1604 Stewart was appointed one of the commissioners for the proposed treaty of union between England and Scotland. Raised in the protestant discipline, but supportive of a church subservient to the polity of the state, Stewart was among the many councillors who met on 20 June 1605 to promulgate the king's order to abandon the general assembly scheduled to meet in Aberdeen on 2 July 1605. Nineteen ministers met in contravention of the order and were imprisoned and tried in a trial that signified the king's determination to curb the kirk's independence of action; Stewart was appointed one of four delegates to reason with the imprisoned ministers and bring them to submission. On 10 July 1606 he was created a peer by the title of Lord Blantyre. In March 1607 he was a commissioner to the synod of Lothian on the subject of constant moderatorships. He was an assessor at the trial on 12 August 1608 of George Sprott, for concealment of the Gowrie conspiracy, and also at that of Lord Balmerino on 4 March 1609. He was reconstituted a judge extraordinary of the court of session on 13 January 1610, and on 15 November following he was appointed an assessor of the treasury.<br>
<br>Stewart married Nichola, fourth daughter of Sir James Somerville of Cambusnethan, on 31 December 1582; she survived him and delivered his testament, in which she is described as his relict. They had six sons: Sir James, who fought a duel with Sir George Wharton at Islington on 8 November 1609, when both combatants were killed; William, who succeeded his father as second Lord Blantyre; Walter, a doctor of medicine and father of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26703/', "Frances Teresa Stuart")</script>, a famous beauty at Charles II's court who became duchess of Richmond, and of the Jacobite supporter Lady Sophia Bulkeley; Mr John; Alexander; and Ludovic; and a daughter Anne, who married John, eighth Lord Abernethy of Saltoun. According to the testament and inventory recorded on 12 June 1618, Lord Blantyre died in late February 1617, although most historians record his death on 8 March 1617. At his death his debts to creditors were &pound;1340 Scots and his residual goods and debts owed to him amounted to &pound;3770 Scots and &pound;6371 Scots, respectively, exclusive of the value of his lands.<br>
