<span class="headword">Cawthorne, Sir  Terence Edward</span>  (1902&#150;1970), <span class="occ">ear surgeon</span>, was born in Aberdeen on 29 September 1902, the only child of William Cawthorne, a customs official, and his wife, Annie England. Cawthorne was educated at Denstone College and at the medical school of King's College Hospital, London. He qualified MRCS, LRCP, in 1924, and became FRCS in 1930. In 1929 he met Lilian Eve Blanche (1907&#150;1975), daughter of William Southworth, musician, at the King's College Hospital annual ball, and they were married on 23 January 1930. They had one son and one daughter.<br>
<br>Cawthorne held a number of junior appointments at King's before becoming registrar to the ear and throat departments. He was appointed to the honorary consultant staff of the hospital as assistant surgeon to the now united ear, nose, and throat department in 1932, and became full surgeon in 1939. For a time he was also a consultant at the Metropolitan Hospital, the Royal Hospital, Richmond, and the East Surrey Hospital. In 1936 he became aural surgeon to the National Hospital for Nervous Diseases. In 1948 he was appointed consulting adviser in otolaryngology to the Ministry of Health, and he held this position until 1967.<br>
<br>At King's, Cawthorne began to concentrate on the problems of aural disease and the close relationship between some forms of deafness and vertigo with neurology, which made his appointment at the National Hospital peculiarly appropriate. Seeking to restore hearing by making a new fenestra for the entry of sound waves to the internal ear in certain types of deafness, he visited the pioneers in this field in various countries. He did much to introduce Lempert's fenestration operation to Europe, and was the first in this country to recognize the value of the operating microscope in ear surgery. It was a natural step for Cawthorne to become interested in the form of vertigo known as M&eacute;ni&egrave;re's disease, and with C. S. Hallpike he did much to further the understanding, diagnosis, and treatment of this condition. His third great neuro-otological interest was in the anatomically neighbouring facial nerve and in the various forms of paralysis of this. These matters, of which he made himself an authority, brought a constant stream of visitors, which must have been very wearing, but he received them all with characteristic patience and courtesy.<br>
<br>Although fully appreciative of the value of laboratory and clinical research and of the need to be closely associated with research workers, Cawthorne was essentially a clinical diagnostician and accurate technical surgeon. His influence attracted the Wernher research unit on deafness to King's and he was clinical director of this from 1958 to 1964. He was an excellent teacher of students and graduates, and was dean of the medical school at King's (1946&#150;8). He was president of the Royal Society of Medicine (1962&#150;4) and received its Dalby (1953) and W. J. Harrison (1961) prizes; and he was master of the second British Academic Conference in Otolaryngology in 1967.<br>
<br>A prolific contributor at gatherings and in learned journals, Cawthorne had numerous invitations to meetings all over the world. He delivered various endowed lectures and was awarded medals in the United Kingdom and other countries. He was particularly well known in the United States and Canada. He was created honorary MD of Uppsala in 1963, honorary LLD of Syracuse, New York, in 1964, and honorary FRCS, Ireland, in 1966. He was knighted in 1964.<br>
<br>Cawthorne was an imposing figure: he combined a calm, reassuring manner with being a good listener, traits which made easy his approaches to patients. The apparent solemnity of his later years covered an innate diffidence and schoolboyish sense of humour. As a graduate student he had worked for a time in an endowed dispensary in London's Drury Lane, meeting many of the odd characters connected with the stage and Covent Garden. No doubt these contacts stimulated his lifelong interest in the arts and led to his membership of the Garrick Club. Cawthorne also became interested in the history of his specialism and its relationship with famous figures. For instance, he wrote papers to show that Julius Caesar and Dean Swift suffered from M&eacute;ni&egrave;re's disease.<br>
<br>In 1964 Cawthorne had his first warning of the heart trouble of which ultimately he died. He was obliged to retire from King's, but he found it hard not to remain involved and he continued to travel. He died in Middlesex Hospital, St Marylebone, London, on 22 January 1970.<br>
