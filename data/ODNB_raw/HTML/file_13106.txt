<span class="headword">Hertslet,  Lewis</span>  (1787&#150;1870), <span class="occ">librarian and editor of state papers</span>, was born in November 1787, the eldest son of Jean Louis Pierre Hertslett (formerly Hiertzelet). His father was a Swiss settled in England, who became a king's messenger in May 1797. Lewis Hertslet was appointed sub-librarian in the Foreign Office on 8 February 1801; almost nine years later, on 6 January 1810, he succeeded Richard Ancell as librarian and keeper of the papers. He remained in this post until his retirement on 20 November 1857.<br>
<br>Hertslet was responsible for administering not only the Foreign Office's printed book collection, but also its records; in time he became a considerable authority on all matters of historical and geographical interest pertaining to British policy overseas. According to one foreign secretary, he was &#145;a Walking State Paper&#146;, while the historian Harold Temperley later observed that on occasion he exercised a powerful influence on policy. Research into records was facilitated by his introduction of a library system of registering and indexing manuscript correspondence, and his department provided secretaries of state with a steady stream of memoranda, offering guidance on precedents and information on international issues of the day. During the Crimean War these included papers on such topics as the status of the Aland Islands, the Russian occupation of Moldavia and Wallachia, and the Ottoman firman on the independence of Circassia.<br>
<br>In 1813 Hertslet began compiling a newspaper scrapbook, containing cuttings from reputable journals recording important political developments, which he called his &#145;Public documents book&#146;. But of more lasting significance was his work on diplomatic documents. In 1820 he published, as a private undertaking but with a guaranteed order from the Foreign Office, two volumes of <span class="italic">A Complete Collection of the Treaties and Conventions</span>, relating to commerce, navigation, and the slave trade. Six years later appeared his classic work of reference under the title <span class="italic">British and Foreign State Papers</span>. Originally intended only for distribution to members of the government and British missions abroad, this collection of treaties and other commercial and political documents went on general sale in 1831 and continued as a series until 1968.<br>
<br>Hertslet married Hannah Harriet, daughter of George Cooke of Westminster; their youngest son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/33840/', "Sir Edward Hertslet (1824&#150;1902)")</script>, later succeeded him as librarian at the Foreign Office. Hertslet died at his house, 16 Great College Street, Westminster, on 15 March 1870. A second wife, Mary Spencer Hertslet, survived him.<br>
