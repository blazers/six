<span class="headword">Thompson,  William</span> <span class="st"> [<em>known as </em>Bendigo]</span>  (1811&#150;1880), <span class="occ">pugilist</span>, was born at Nottingham on 11 October 1811, the youngest of the twenty-one children (according to some accounts) of Benjamin Thompson (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1826), a mechanic in the lace industry, and his wife, Mary (1769&#150;1851). He later said that he was born one of three sons at a birth and that these boys became popularly known as Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. The record of his baptism at St Mary's, Nottingham, on 16 October 1811, however, records him as the younger of twins. He learned the trade of iron turning from an elder brother, but as a youth became a formidable pugilist. In 1832 he beat Bill Faulker, a Nottingham notoriety, and in the following year defeated Charles Martin. In his first challenge reported in <span class="italic">Bell's Life in London</span> in 1835 he styled himself Abednego of Nottingham, and from that date he was spoken of in the sporting press as Bendigo. Rather improbably, Dowling ascribed the nickname instead to his evasive tactics in the ring  (Dowling, <span class="italic">Fights</span>, 140).<br>
<br>Bendigo's first important fight was on 21 July 1835, near Appleby House, about 30 miles from Nottingham, when he met Benjamin Caunt. In the twenty-third round Caunt, wearied with Bendigo's shifty conduct in continually hitting him and then dropping to render retaliation &#145;foul&#146;, struck him a blow while he was on his second's knee; by this foul blow he lost the fight. On 24 May 1836, 9 miles from Sheffield, he defeated John Leechman, known as Brassey, in fifty-two rounds after a severe contest.<br>
<br>Again facing Caunt on 3 April 1838, Bendigo was this time unsuccessful; his &#145;dropping without a blow&#146; was deemed foul. In the presence of 15,000 people, including many aristocratic spectators, he fought Deaf Burke at Heather, Leicestershire, on 12 February 1839 (the first fight under the new London rules), when in the tenth round Burke butted him twice, and the referee gave a decision that the blows were &#145;foul&#146;. During the same year James Ward presented &#145;a champion's belt&#146; to Bendigo at the Queen's Theatre, Liverpool.<br>
<br>On 23 March 1840, while throwing a somersault at Nottingham, Bendigo so hurt his kneecap that he was laid up for two years. He was taken into custody by the police on 28 June 1842 and bound over to keep the peace to prevent his fighting Hazard Parker. A fight for &pound;200 a side and the belt came off with his old opponent Caunt on 9 September 1845, when a decision was given in his favour&#151;rather an arbitrary one after a fight in which &#145;both men committed every known foul and invented a good deal more&#146;  (Johnson, 98). Bendigo's backing by the so-called &#145;Nottingham lambs&#146;, armed with bludgeons, may have influenced the referee. His last appearance in the ring took place on 15 June 1850 at Mildenhall, Suffolk, when, for &pound;200 a side, he fought Tom Paddock. His 82-year-old mother, who had always encouraged his pugnacity, is said to have threatened to fight Paddock herself if he did not answer the challenge. He would probably have been defeated, as his age told against him, had he not incited Paddock to a foul blow.<br>
<br>Bendigo was 5 feet 9&frac34; inches tall, and his fighting weight was 11 stone 12 lb. Fighting men such as Caunt, at least 3 stone heavier, encouraged him to &#145;shiftiness&#146;, but his unprecedented leading with the right was also a factor in his success. After his retirement from the ring, Bendigo took to drink, and was incarcerated in the Nottingham house of correction on twenty-eight occasions. But after attending a revivalist meeting in 1872, addressed by Richard Weaver (1827&#150;1892), the collier evangelist, he &#145;saw the light&#146;: &#145;Jesus came to me and had a bout with me, and I can tell you He licked me in the first round&#146;  (Cieszkowski, 29). He took the teetotal pledge, joined the Good Templars, and became an evangelist preacher in Nottingham and elsewhere. His new career still entailed some bouts with hecklers. When he told Lord Longford that now he fought Beelzebub, that gentleman is said to have replied, &#145;I hope you fight him more fairly than you did Ben Caunt, or my sympathies will be all with the devil&#146;  (Johnson, 98). While on a visit to London he was a preacher and a leader of revivalist services at the Cabmen's Mission Hall, King's Cross Circus, and also a preacher in the Holborn Circus. Bendigo died at Beeston, near Nottingham, on 23 August 1880, broken ribs having punctured a lung after a fall downstairs. He was buried in St Mary's cemetery, St Ann's Well Road, Nottingham. The goldfield and city in Australia took the name Bendigo from him, horse races were named after him, and he was the subject of numerous popular ballads.<br>
