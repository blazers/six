<span class="headword">Boase,  Thomas Sherrer Ross</span>  (1898&#150;1974), <span class="occ">art historian and university teacher</span>, was born in Dundee on 31 August 1898, the only son and elder child of Charles Millet Boase, the manager and part owner of a bleaching mill at Claverhouse outside Dundee, and his wife, Anne Malcolm, daughter of Thomas Sherrer Ross, a merchant of the same city. Books abounded in his home and he read widely from an early age. Moving from a local preparatory school to Rugby School in 1912, he long believed himself at a disadvantage because he was so bad at ball games. However, he became head of his house, and won a prize essay contest on the subject of Lorenzo de' Medici and then an exhibition to enter Magdalen College, Oxford. From 1917 to 1919 he was with the Oxford and Buckinghamshire light infantry and for the last year of the war fought on the front between St Quentin and Cambrai. He was awarded the MC. His Oxford education had already begun, the cadet battalion which he joined on leaving Rugby being housed in Wadham College. At this time he first met F. F. (Sligger) Urquhart of Balliol, whose style and standards were to influence him profoundly. He returned in 1919 to read modern history at Magdalen, took a second class degree in 1921, and was elected to a fellowship at Hertford College in 1922.<br>
<br>Boase rapidly became an effective teacher. He lectured on both medieval and modern themes, a breadth of view reflected thirty years later in his equal concern for medieval and Victorian art. An interest in Italy developed into his first book, <span class="italic">Boniface VIII</span> (1933), and his study <span class="italic">St. Francis of Assisi</span> (1936). He was at the same time immersed in Oxford activities academic and social. As treasurer of the Oxford University Dramatic Society he made the acquaintance of the finest theatrical talent of the day; for the rest of his life he delighted to take pupils to the theatre, and patronized drama. He also turned his attention to the visual arts. The 1930 exhibition of Italian art at the Royal Academy deeply impressed him, and he learnt much from his friendship with Kenneth Clark and Lord Balniel (later earl of Crawford and Balcarres), who helped to mount the exhibition. Beside his frequent visits to Urquhart's chalet in the French Alps, constant travel in western Europe and the Near East was meanwhile making him an experienced viewer of pictures, monuments, and buildings.<br>
<br>In 1936 these interests brought Boase to the attention of those who were involved with the problems of the Courtauld Institute, founded in 1932 for the study of art history. Following the resignation of W. G. Constable as director, the committee of management selected Boase for the post in 1937 (he also held the London University chair in the history of art from 1937 to 1947), although he seemed to some art historians, critics, and students an amateur not properly qualified to succeed Constable. In taking up this challenge Boase enjoyed one advantage. Maintaining old friendships in Berlin and Frankfurt, participating in the World Council of Churches with its concern for events in Germany under Hitler, he was the better prepared to collaborate with scholars who had moved with the Warburg Library and Institute to London, and to learn from them. The Courtauld discovered that, although he did not satisfy everybody, the new director was able to give it an improved syllabus and greater stability. The two foundations were brought closer together; the first of his own numerous contributions to the <span class="italic">Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes</span>, &#145;The arts in the Latin kingdom of Jerusalem&#146;, appeared in 1939. Later Boase contributed the notice of Samuel Courtauld to the <span class="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</span>.<br>
<br>Immediately on the outbreak of the Second World War, Boase went to the Government Code and Cypher School at Bletchley, and from there to Cairo, where he worked for the Royal Air Force for nearly two years. From the end of 1943 he was once again based in Cairo, in charge of British Council activities in the Middle East. He travelled widely, made many friends both Arab and Jewish, enriched his old passion for the history of the crusades, and in 1945 returned to the Courtauld &#145;with resilience a little dulled for the taking up of a former life&#146;  (Boase). Aided principally by Anthony Blunt, he contributed to the revival and expansion of art-historical studies in post-war London, but in 1947 accepted the presidency of his old college, Magdalen. It was quickly evident there that the new president's deft style of management, combined with a splendid talent for getting to know large numbers of undergraduates, would leave its mark. He remained vigorously in control for a dozen years, until tenure of the vice-chancellorship of the university (1958&#150;60) and less robust health led to a phase of diminished activity. He retired in 1968.<br>
<br>All this time Boase gave equal attention to his work for the arts. His main undertaking was the <span class="italic">Oxford History of English Art</span>, as general editor and author of two out of eleven volumes. <span class="italic">English Art, 1100&#150;1216</span> (1953) and <span class="italic">English Art, 1800&#150;1870</span> (1959) offer sturdy summaries of modern knowledge; in the first illuminated manuscripts, and in the second minor rather than major artists, were the topics on which he wrote most effectively. Meanwhile he contributed many articles to books of reference, and generous introductions to work by other scholars. He served as trustee or adviser for the National Gallery (1947&#150;53), the British Museum (1950&#150;69), the Victoria and Albert Museum (1947&#150;70), the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre, the Gulbenkian Foundation, and other institutions. He received several honorary degrees (including that of DCL of Oxford in 1960) and was a fellow of the British Academy (1961).<br>
<br>Boase died at his home at 6 Atherton Drive, Wimbledon, London, on 14 April 1974, having completed his contribution for a history of the Cilician kingdom of Armenia (published in 1978) and a study of Vasari (published in 1979). He was always energetic, a bachelor who organized his time with great precision and worked rapidly. He was an excellent speaker; collected good pictures; and disliked extravagance. Brought up in the Scottish Episcopal church, he remained a firm Christian, a great supporter of his college choir and chapel. His portrait by Anthony Devas, emphasizing a characteristic gesture of his hands, hangs in the hall of Magdalen.<br>
