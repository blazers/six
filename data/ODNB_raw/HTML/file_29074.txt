<span class="headword">Wessington,  John</span>  (<em>c.</em>1371&#150;1451), <span class="occ">prior of Durham Cathedral priory</span>, was a member of the community of St Cuthbert at Durham and held the office of prior there for almost thirty years, from his election on 5 November 1416 until his resignation in June 1446. Probably born in the village of Washington 10 miles north of his future cathedral city, he was related&#151;if somewhat distantly&#151;to the Durham county knightly family of Wessington that included some of the remote ancestors of the first president of the United States of America among its members. John Wessington entered the cathedral monastery at Durham in 1390; and shortly after receiving priest's orders he was sent to Durham College, Oxford. Although Wessington never acquired a university degree, he remained a fellow of his college for the next thirteen years, often serving as one of its two bursars. Apparently never celebrated for scholastic learning himself, Wessington was otherwise a highly regarded &#145;university monk&#146; of his period: in 1426 he was to serve as president of the provincial chapter of the English black monks at their assembly in Northampton. Soon after returning from Oxford to Durham in 1407 he became both sacrist and chancellor of his mother house. In the latter office he presided over the reorganization of his convent's archives. His fellow monks were probably even more impressed by the skill with which he exploited those muniments to defend the franchises of his community.<br>
<br>By 1416 Wessington's intense commitment to the preservation of his monastery's privileges against external aggression had already emerged as the most characteristic feature of his career. It was no doubt largely for this reason that in November of that year he was elected prior by the sixty-nine members of his community. Nor is it likely to be a coincidence that Wessington's term of office coincided with a period when the convent's registers, obedientiary account rolls, and other documents were particularly well compiled and conserved. Almost always resident within the county of Durham (he is only known to have visited London three times in thirty years), he made no attempt to perambulate his manors in the fashion of his predecessors. Although Wessington normally spent several weeks every year at his favourite country retreat of Beaurepaire (Bear Park), he was usually to be found in his prior's quarters at Durham itself. It was in this sumptuous set of chambers, largely reconstructed or refurnished by himself, that he spent much of his time entertaining visiting nobles, local clergy, and members of his own convent. Thus between May 1430 and May 1431 the prior invited to dinner at Durham not only Bishop Thomas Langley of Durham but also the bishop of Carlisle, the abbot of Whitby, the prior of Tynemouth, Sir Robert Umfraville, and a large number of local gentlemen and officials. Wessington's continuously cordial relations with Bishop Langley during the latter's long episcopate (1406&#150;37) was indeed crucial to the success of his rule as prior. In return for providing his bishop with valuable written evidence for the defence of his episcopal franchises, notably when the latter were challenged by a powerful group of Durham knights in 1433, Wessington could always rely upon Langley's advice and support on his own economic and political problems.<br>
<br>By contrast Wessington's relationship with Robert Neville (<i>d</i>. 1457), who succeeded Langley at Durham in 1438, began with a dispute about the date of the new bishop's enthronement and was never quite so harmonious. Nevertheless Wessington had been remarkably successful in securing the goodwill of the senior members of the Neville family in extremely difficult circumstances. After the death of Ralph Neville, first earl of Westmorland, in October 1425, the prior played an important and much appreciated role as an unofficial peacemaker during the violent conflict that then erupted between the two branches of the family. Of the two arch-rivals in the dispute, Ralph Neville, second earl of Westmorland (<i>d</i>. 1484), regularly chose Wessington as one of his arbiters, while Richard Neville, earl of Salisbury (<i>d</i>. 1460), invited him to attend the christening of his son George, the future archbishop of York (<i>d</i>. 1476), at Middleham in 1432.<br>
<br>Throughout his priorate John Wessington's authority was accordingly more usually put at risk by the turbulence of the local gentry than by the feuds of the higher aristocracy of northern England. In the delicate political art of cultivating the friendship of influential knights and esquires within the county of Durham, the prior's appointment of his chief lay steward provided him with his most valuable link with the non-religious world. Both of Wessington's chief stewards, Thomas Langton of Winyard (1416&#150;36) and William Hoton of Hardwick Hall (1437&#150;46), worked strenuously on the convent's behalf, as indeed did many of the other members of the county gentry retained by the convent for legal support in times of need. Such assistance was all the more necessary to the prior because lengthy and expensive litigation with local landlords over such issues as rights to common pasture and watermills was a perennial feature of his rule at Durham. Most of these disputes were eventually settled by arbitration out of court; but the possibility of armed attack on the monks of St Cuthbert was certainly always present. In 1419 Thomas Claxton and Thomas Billingham, two of Wessington's discontented tenants, not only ambushed one of the Durham monks on the highway but placed the convent itself in a state of unofficial siege. Despite the prestige of his position Wessington therefore found it difficult to impose his authority in the face of some of the dangerous pressures which inevitably confronted so large a monastery with so many (nine) daughter houses. During the early 1440s he was faced not only with an alarming new challenge to his monastery's control over its cell of Coldingham in Scotland, but also with the totally unexpected withdrawal of obedience by William Partrike, prior of Lytham, Lancashire. After the severe agrarian crisis of the late 1430s Wessington also had to defend his financial administration of the priory from a variety of serious criticisms, made before and after Bishop Robert Neville's visitation of the cathedral in 1442. But by that year Wessington was over seventy years old and increasingly &#145;wexit with greyt sekenesse&#146;  (Dobson, <span class="italic">Durham Priory</span>, 110&#150;111). He resigned the prior's office on 8 June 1446 and was assigned five attendants, an annual pension of &pound;40, and attractive living accommodation either at Finchale Priory or within his convent's own monastic infirmary. He died at Durham five years later, on 9 April 1451.<br>
<br>John Wessington's most distinctive achievements as prior of Durham undoubtedly lay in his personal contributions to learning within his cloister. If not himself a historian in any modern sense of the word, he was nevertheless one of the most historically minded of all late medieval English Benedictine monks. Besides devoting much time and care to the custody and cataloguing of the thousand or so manuscripts within his monastery's various book collections, Wessington was responsible for the building of an entirely new reference library (completed by 1418 at a total cost of over &pound;90) between the chapter house and the south transept of the cathedral church. The range and quality of his own written work, nearly always composed &#145;for the defence of the church of Durham&#146;, was famous in his own lifetime  (<span class="italic">Historiae Dunelmensis scriptores tres</span>, cclxviii&#150;cclxxi). As Wessington was never a writer concerned to publicize his personal authorship of the numerous compilations now ascribed to him, it can be difficult to distinguish between what he wrote himself and what he commissioned from other monks. However he was certainly directly responsible for an ambitious, if highly derivative, new history of the church of Durham from its origins at Lindisfarne to at least the year 1356. Among his other major and usually very well-informed enterprises were a series of treatises on the origins and ideals of the Benedictine order. More interesting and voluminous still are the highly miscellaneous smaller <i>compilationes</i> (of which between thirty and forty survive), which demonstrate the prior's remarkable ability to use historical sources within the convent's archives as evidence in defence of the church of Durham's rights, possessions, and incomparable legal status. To cite Wessington's own words to Bishop Robert Neville in 1440, &#145;I haff doon my diligence and shewid in yees maters such evidence and wrytyng as I haff&#146;  (registrum parvum, II, fol. 112).<br>
