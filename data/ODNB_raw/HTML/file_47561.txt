<span class="headword">Horne,  Benjamin Worthy</span>  (1804&#150;1870), <span class="occ">coach proprietor</span>, was the eldest son of William Horne, and his wife, Mary. William Horne (1783&#150;1828) was originally a painter, and entered the innkeeping and coaching trade following an advantageous marriage to Mary Worthy, daughter of a wealthy wheelwright. Subsequently, in 1812, he purchased the Golden Cross inn, Charing Cross. Other inn yards were later acquired too, as well as stables for 200 horses at Barnet. In 1819 he had about 400 horses at work, and in 1827 between 700 and 800 horses.<br>
<br>Benjamin Horne took over the business when his father died in 1828. In 1836 he was the second largest coach proprietor (after William Chaplin), and had ninety-five coaches, including five mail coaches, leaving London every day. Horne was an exceptionally aggressive competitor, and he generally had sufficient resources to win any contest. Harper described him as:<blockquote>a tall, lathy, irritable man, of eager face, quick, nervous speech, and rapid walk, with something of a military air in his alert, upright figure &hellip; Horne must always expend his energies on the minor details of his extensive business, and himself do work that would have been better delegated to subordinates. &hellip; Up early, no day was long enough for him, and he economised time by taking no regular meal until evening. He was generally to be seen eating his lunch out of a paper bag as he swung furiously along the streets. &hellip; Although there was no keener or more ruthless man of business &hellip; he was privately a considerate and kindly man, helpful and charitable to those less successful than himself. (Harper, 2.221&#150;2, 225)</blockquote>On 4 November 1830 he married Catherine Larkin at St Nicholas's Church, Rochester; they had at least nine children.<br>
<br>It was apparently his friend William Chaplin who persuaded him to adapt to the railways instead of opposing them. Certainly Horne was aware by 1835 of the probability of coach businesses being &#145;annihilated by steam some few years hence&#146;. He joined with his brother Henry and William Chaplin in the firm of Chaplin and Horne, which in 1840 became carrying agent to the Grand Junction Railway (later the London and North Western Railway or LNWR), and was also active on other railways. In 1858 he described himself as the managing partner, and was constantly in and out of the LNWR yards at Euston and Camden Town. When the railway took in hand the goods department at Camden, citing inefficiency, he challenged the railway at law and, although he lost, was regarded as having vindicated the firm. He also continued his coaches where they could still pay their way, and, in 1843, considered himself the largest coach proprietor. He had an estate at Highlands near Mereworth, Kent, and a London residence at 33 Russell Square, and he died at the latter on 14 April 1870, aged sixty-six. He was survived by his wife.<br>
