<span class="headword">Bond,  Nicholas</span>  (1540&#150;1608), <span class="occ">college head</span>, was from Lincolnshire. He matriculated as a pensioner at St John's College, Cambridge, on 27 May 1559 and was elected Lady Margaret scholar on 27 June, graduating BA in 1563/4. In 1565 he was admitted a fellow of Magdalen College, Oxford, taking his MA in that university on 17 October 1567. In 1574 he was admitted to the rectory of Bourton on the Water, Gloucestershire, on presentation of the crown, and resigned his fellowship of Magdalen College the following year. On 15 July 1580 he was awarded a doctorate of divinity for a thesis concerning the question &#145;Is God's will immutable?&#146;. On 1 March 1582 Bond was presented by Queen Elizabeth to the fifth prebendal stall of Westminster Abbey, and later in that year he was named as one of those qualified to confer with captured Jesuits. In or before 1584 he was appointed a chaplain-in-ordinary to the queen, and a chaplain of the Savoy. But his further progress was not smooth.<br>
<br>On the death of Richard Alvey, the master of the Temple, a protracted struggle developed over the succession to his post, not least because one of the candidates was the presbyterian Walter Travers. In August 1584 Whitgift, the new archbishop of Canterbury, wrote to the queen strongly opposing Travers and recommending instead &#145;Dr Bond&#146;, a man &#145;very fit for that office, and willing also to take pains therein&#146;. Nevertheless, Bond's candidature was rejected. Burghley, the lord treasurer, seems with many reservations to have favoured the other man for the mastership. The lawyers' preference may also have played a role in Bond's failure. Burghley considered Bond &#145;one well learned and honest&#146;, but believed that &#145;if he came not to the place with some applause of the company he should be weary thereof&#146;  (Strype, <span class="italic">Whitgift</span>, 1.343). Whitgift could not secure the victory of his prot&eacute;g&eacute;, but he was able to block Travers: in the end a compromise candidate, Richard Hooker, was installed.<br>
<br>Bond appears to have carried out his duties as a canon of Westminster more conscientiously than many, for as Dean Goodman reported in April 1586, he was one of those &#145;most commonly present&#146; in midsummer quarter and was ranked among &#145;such as preach and come to divine service in their habits being present&#146;  (Strype, <span class="italic">Annals</span>, 3, pt ii, 415&#150;16). Further preferments followed. On 3 May 1586 Bond acquired the rectory of Britwell, Oxfordshire, and in 1590 that of Alresford, Hampshire. In 1586 he was proposed by Whitgift for the deanery of Worcester, but was unsuccessful, despite the sympathy of Burghley.<br>
<br>In 1589 Bond's ambition, and the strength of his connections and influence, was subjected to a most exacting test. Lawrence Humphrey, the president of Magdalen College, was a Calvinist scholar whose alleged laxity in government and religion had nevertheless for some years aroused puritan disapproval. Humphrey's death on 1 February 1589 gave rise to a division as to the choice of his successor. The name of Ralph Smith was canvassed among the &#145;precise party&#146;, notably by the college vice-president, John Harding. Within days, however, the fellows received from the queen a letter which brooked no argument: &#145;we will and command you, and every one of you, immediately upon receipt hereof &hellip; to nominate and elect unto the place of your president the said Doctor Bond&#146;  (Harriss, 19). The privy council was also moved to write in Bond's favour. Such heavy pressure probably owed much to the continuing patronage of Archbishop Whitgift, determined as ever to resist puritan advances. In the college, however, the ranks of Bond's more precise opponents were swelled by those who resented royal and governmental interference. Others were unimpressed by his performance in the roles of dean of arts in 1570, bursar in 1571&#150;2, and vice-president in 1572, recalling his &#145;lightness in behaviour and small skill or care of matters in our House&#146;  (ibid.). On the day of the senior fellows' decision, Ralph Smith emerged with eight votes, but it seems that some of Bond's supporters, sensing defeat, had planned a means to evade it: &#145;before the scrutiny could be announced, Swithin Stroud, one of Bond's voters, snatched away the papers from the scrutator, and rushing out of the chapel with his friends, contrived to delay the election beyond the statutable time&#146;  (Cooper, <span class="italic">Ath. Cantab.</span>, 2.466). Feeling ran very high and the official candidate was dubbed the &#145;bond of iniquity&#146; by Smith's partisans. But their loud protests at the frustration of the majority will were to no avail: since the election had not been valid under the statutes, the right of presentation lapsed to the queen under the royal prerogative. On 4 April 1589 Elizabeth signed letters patent appointing Bond to the presidency.<br>
<br>Very soon after, on 16 July 1589, Bond was appointed vice-chancellor of Oxford University, probably on the urging of his old patron, Whitgift, and of Sir Christopher Hatton, the chancellor. Hatton seems to have expected rapid progress in enforcing regulations more rigorously and in imposing upon the advanced protestant party the oath of subscription to Whitgift's three articles. On 8 July 1590 he ordered the vice-chancellor to read out before congregation a catalogue of the university's supposed failings in such matters. Bond refused, protesting in a letter to Richard Bancroft that the charges were unjust and tended to his own disgrace. Regulations, he asserted, were taken seriously: at Magdalen, for example, the &#145;scholars dare not presume to speak any other language than Latin&#146;  (Wilson, 135&#150;6). A few days later, on 16 July 1590, Bond resigned the vice-chancellorship.<br>
<br>Bond served a second term for the year from 13 July 1592; in September, the queen visited Oxford and was feasted at Magdalen. Here, Bond's influence was considerable. Support for puritanism dwindled during his presidency, though it was to revive under his successor, John Harding. It is indeed ironic that as an executor of the will of the countess of Sussex, Bond played a role in the foundation in 1596 of the puritan stronghold of Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge. But at Magdalen his regime was not one of rooted traditionalism; purchase for the library of books by theologians of the reformed churches increased considerably during his presidency, and there were important reforms and improvements. In December 1591 Bond instructed that the &#145;poor scholars&#146; were to attend the grammar school. The students of logic and sophistry were divided into classes with lecturers appointed for each; efforts were made to require bachelors to make more determined efforts to improve themselves. Meanwhile, the college prospered. By the mid-1590s the accounts showed a growing surplus which was used for repairs and a new organ for the chapel.<br>
<br>For half a century after the Reformation in England, the independent spirit of Magdalen College had often inconvenienced governments. The election of Bond marked something of a watershed. When Hatton died on 20 November 1591, there was pressure from the advanced protestant party for the appointment of the earl of Essex to the university chancellorship, a proposal strenuously opposed by the court and by Whitgift. It was Bond, more than any other individual in the university, who worked for and secured the election of Thomas Sackville, Lord Buckhurst. Generally, &#145;Elizabeth had confidence in Bond, not least for his ability to keep the puritan element under control and he did much to strengthen ties with the court&#146;  (Harriss, 21). A tradition of independence survived, however, in the college. In 1602 Bond found it expedient to write to Burghley, explaining that his own strong recommendation for a fellowship for a court nominee, Edward Othen, had been insufficient to prevent the Magdalen fellows rejecting him in favour of John Burrows.<br>
<br>On the death of Queen Elizabeth, Bond published Latin verses in her honour. He continued in his position after the accession of the new king. It was during his presidency that on 28 August 1605 Prince Henry matriculated at Magdalen, and with King James was entertained at the college; extensive renovation was carried out in advance of the royal visit. Bond died on 8 February 1608. He was a benefactor of the college library and the Bodleian. His own collection must have been very extensive, since it was valued at &pound;290. Among the more unusual bequests were the two globes and mathematical instruments granted to his servant, George Neighbour, whom he had long permitted to use them. Bond was buried in the chapel of Magdalen College, Oxford, where there is an inscription in his memory.<br>
