<span class="headword">Skey,  Frederic Carpenter</span>  (1798&#150;1872), <span class="occ">surgeon</span>, second of six children of George Skey, a Russia merchant in London, and his wife, was born at Upton upon Severn, Worcestershire, on 1 December 1798. He was educated chiefly at the private school at Normanston in Suffolk of Michael Maurice, father of Frederick Denison Maurice, whose friendship he retained until his death. After a short stay at Plymouth with his cousin, Dr Joseph Skey, then inspector-general of army hospitals, Skey commenced his medical education at Edinburgh University, where he spent two years, followed by a few months in Paris. On 15 April 1816 he was apprenticed to John Abernethy, surgeon at St Bartholomew's Hospital in London, paying the usual premium of 500 guineas. After studying at the hospital he was admitted as a member of the Royal College of Surgeons, London, on 5 April 1822. Abernethy had so high an opinion of his pupil's capacities, that even while he was still an apprentice, Skey was entrusted with the care of some of his master's private patients.<br>
<br>Thanks to Abernethy's help Skey was appointed demonstrator of anatomy at St Bartholomew's about 1826. He resigned the office after Abernethy's death in 1831, following a dispute with William Lawrence, but retained the post of assistant surgeon, to which he was appointed on 29 August 1827, the same year that he became consulting surgeon at Charterhouse. The direct outcome of Skey's resignation of his teaching post was the revival of the Aldersgate Street school of medicine, which in the hands of James Hope, Robert Todd, Marshall Hall, Jonathan Pereira, and Francis(?) Kiernan, soon became famous as a private teaching establishment. For ten years Skey taught surgery at the Aldersgate Street school, which for some time competed with the neighbouring medical school of St Bartholomew's Hospital. Skey also maintained a growing private practice at 13 Grosvenor Street in central London, attracting an influential clientele.<br>
<br>Skey was elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1837, the same year in which the society published his paper on muscular fibre. He was appointed anatomy lecturer at St Bartholomew's Hospital medical school in 1843, and held this post until 1865. He became full surgeon at the hospital in May 1854 and relinquished the position on 18 January 1864 having reached the official retirement age of sixty-five. He was then elected consulting surgeon, and was presented with a handsome testimonial.<br>
<br>Skey filled many important positions at the Royal College of Surgeons. Elected an honorary fellow in 1843 and a member of the council in 1848, he was appointed Hunterian orator in 1850, and in 1852 was made professor of human anatomy and surgery. He was elected a member of the court of examiners in 1855, and in 1863 became president. In 1859 Skey served as president of the Royal Medical and Chirurgical Society, and in 1864, at the instigation of his friend and patient Benjamin Disraeli, was appointed chairman of the first parliamentary committee at the Admiralty to inquire into the best way of treating venereal disease in the army and navy. He was created CB in 1868 for his services in this capacity, and the direct outcome of the committee's report was the framing of the <span class="roman">Contagious Diseases Act</span> of 1866.<br>
<br>Skey was a man of genial disposition and great intelligence, and he was known to be fond of animals. He was a good writer, a clear lecturer, and an excellent teacher who concerned himself with the broad principles of his subject rather than with details. An able surgeon, especially when treating exceptional cases, he was extremely skilful in diagnosis and most resourceful when unusual difficulties arose.<br>
<br>Skey published a number of books, wrote several pamphlets, was a frequent contributor to the periodical press, and wrote letters to <span class="italic">The Times</span> on alcoholic diseases and on the harmful physical effects of rowing, especially those caused by the pace of the university boat race. His works include: <span class="italic">On a New Mode of Treatment in the Cure of Various Forms of Ulcer and Granulating Wounds</span> (1837), which was followed by <span class="italic">A Practical Treatise on the Venereal Disease</span> (1840), based on six lectures given at the Aldersgate Street school of medicine. Willing to use innovative methods in surgery, Skey wrote <span class="italic">On a New Operation for the Cure of Lateral Curvature of the Spine</span> (1841); and his <span class="italic">Operative Surgery</span> (1850), which was of considerable merit and became a standard student text, explained his opposition to the use of the knife except as a last resort. <span class="italic">Hysteria</span> (1867) consisted of a series of lectures in which the advantages of the &#145;tonic&#146; plan of treatment were extolled; it reached three editions.<br>
<br>Skey was married and had four sons and two daughters. His wife, Sarah Sophia (<i>b</i>. 1809/10), pre-deceased him, as did one son. Skey's own health failed during the last two or three years of his life, and after suffering great pain from intestinal ulceration he died at his home at 24 Mount Street, Grosvenor Square, London, on 15 August 1872. He was buried at Kensal Green cemetery on 19 August.<br>
