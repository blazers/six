<span class="headword">Perceval,  Robert</span>  (1756&#150;1839), <span class="occ">physician and chemist</span>, the youngest son of William Perceval, barrister, and his second wife, Elizabeth Ward of Lisbane, co. Down, was born in Dublin on 30 September 1756. He was descended from Sir Philip Perceval (1605&#150;1647), and hence related to the earls of Egmont. Perceval's early education was at Dr Darby's school in Ballygall in north co. Dublin. He entered Trinity College, Dublin, in April 1772, and graduated BA in 1777. He then went to Edinburgh, where he studied medicine, was taught chemistry by Joseph Black, and graduated MD on 24 June 1780, with a thesis on the physiology of the heart.<br>
<br>After studying for two years on the continent Perceval returned to Dublin via London in late 1782. In the following year he was appointed lecturer on chemistry in the university. On 24 November of the same year he was elected a licentiate of the King and Queen's College of Physicians; he subsequently became a fellow. In 1785 he was appointed first professor of chemistry in the University of Dublin, and remained in this post until 1805. Also in 1785 he took an active part in founding the Royal Irish Academy, his name appearing in the charter, and he served as secretary to the academy for a number of years. In the same year he helped to found the Dublin General Dispensary. His scientific papers all appear in the <span class="italic">Transactions of the Royal Irish Academy</span>.<br>
<br>In 1786 Perceval was appointed inspector of apothecaries, and while carrying out this work incurred some temporary unpopularity. He was one of the compilers of the Dublin <span class="italic">Pharmacopoeia</span> for the Irish college of physicians. He married, in 1786, Anne, daughter of W. Brereton of Rathgilbert. Perceval now began to devote much of his time and money to medical and other charities in Dublin. He was admitted MB and MD by Dublin University in 1793.<br>
<br>Largely because of pressure exerted by Perceval through the university, in April 1799 a committee of the Irish House of Lords was appointed to inquire into the application of the funds left by Sir Patrick Dun. Perceval was examined, and stated that he did not think the King and Queen's College of Physicians had properly fulfilled its obligations under Dun's will. Following the report of the Lords' committee, the <span class="roman">School of Physic Act</span> became law on 1 August 1800. In accordance with this act a hospital, called Sir Patrick Dun's Hospital, was built from the surplus funds of Dun's bequest, and was opened on 25 October 1808. Three professorships in medicine were also established. Although Perceval had been censured by the College of Physicians for his share in the promotion of the act, he was elected president of the college on 4 November 1799. However, at his own wish a special clause was inserted in the act, according to which no university or King's professor could remain a fellow of the college. Perceval therefore resigned his presidency and fellowship, but was elected honorary fellow on 18 October 1800. He subsequently became involved in a controversy with Dr E. Hill, who was obliged, under the provisions of the act, to resign the professorship of botany, which he had held simultaneously with the regius professorship of physic.<br>
<br>Perceval now became an active member of the Prison Discipline Society, which subsequently merged with the Howard Society, and he became known as &#145;the Irish Howard&#146; for his concern with the welfare of prisoners. On 18 March 1819 he was appointed physician-general to the forces in Ireland. In 1821 he published an essay in which he sought to show from the texts of the <span class="roman">New Testament</span> that Christ, although a divine person, was distinct from the deity, a doctrine similar to that of Adam Clarke (1762&#150;1832). After a lingering illness Perceval died in Dublin on 3 March 1839.<br>
<br>Perceval was a successful physician, but his claims to fame rest chiefly on his philanthropic efforts. His published contributions to chemistry were insubstantial; the notes for a medical treatise he intended to publish were handed to John Mason Good when Perceval heard that Good was contemplating a similar project.<br>
