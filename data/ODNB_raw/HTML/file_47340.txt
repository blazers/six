<span class="headword">Ridgley <span class="st"> [Rugeley]</span>,  Thomas</span>  (<em>c.</em>1576&#150;1656), <span class="occ">physician</span>, was the only son of Simon Rugeley, of Hawksyard, near Rugeley, Staffordshire, and his wife, Catherine, daughter of Augustine Babington, of Normanton, Derbyshire. He matriculated at St John's College, Cambridge, in 1594, taking his BA there in 1597 and MA in 1600. While an undergraduate he wrote verses to the memory of the master of St John's, William Whitaker, who died in 1595. Ridgley took his MD at the college in 1608. From 1608 to 1616 he was a country physician at Newark, Nottinghamshire. On 6 February 1608 he took out a Nottinghamshire licence to marry Anne Odingsells, daughter of Gabriel Odingsells of Epperstone and Bulcote, Nottinghamshire; they had four children, Thomas (<i>b</i>. 1613), Luke (<i>b</i>. 1615), George, and Mary.<br>
<br>In 1617 Ridgley moved to London. This would have enabled him to give greater attention to a lawsuit he was involved in and to increase his income. Intending to become a fellow of the College of Physicians, he made his first, unofficial appearance before the president and twelve fellows of the college, on 18 March 1617. His first formal appearance before the full <i>comitia</i> of the college occurred on 3 June 1617. A letter from the chief royal physician, Theodore Turquet de Mayerne, to the president of the college recommended Ridgley and the college elected him a candidate. Mayerne's interest in Ridgley may have been sparked by their common interest in chemical medicine. Ridgley's reputation prompted a letter from Sir Gervase Clifton, which may perhaps be dated to this period, and which dealt with the value to sexual potency of a mercury derivative. Ridgley ridiculed the idea:<blockquote>Those Puritane Alchymists that talke so muche of separating the impure part from the pure cannot with all their art separate or extract anie thing out of Mercury &hellip; it being a simple homogeneous body never to be resolved into diverse natures. (Lansdowne MS 238, fol. 149)</blockquote>In the same context, Ridgley also impugned the aphrodisiac benefits of the &#145;aurum potabile&#146; preparation of Francis Anthony.<br>
<br>On 14 January 1619 Ridgley and Thomas Winston testified in the college against the medical activities of William Eyre. Despite these prerogatives of place, Ridgley was left to languish as a candidate for a number of years, still waiting to be elevated to a vacant fellowship. Rumour that Ridgley was to be passed over again in favour of a younger candidate caused James I to write to the college on Ridgley's behalf. In the letter, dated 7 March 1621, James argued &#145;that a man of whose merite yourselves are satisfied and we have receaved your good testimonie, should not be discouraged or kept back from such orderly prefermentes&#146;  (annals, RCP Lond., 3.143). The fellows vowed to elect him to the next open place, which they did on 28 November 1622. But their failure to elect him immediately irritated Ridgley; on 9 November 1621 the ill feeling between the fellows and Ridgley finally erupted, as the college demanded Ridgley's dues as a candidate:<blockquote>Dr Ridgley in his turn stood much upon his gentrye and knew none of us better: that he to paye was forced fowly and injuriously: but bids us keep our othe. Now he wanted moneye, but they pay more than the privilege is worth: He desiers no favour: but had brought the Kings letters: and it is not agenist his othe to bring the Kings letters. (ibid., 3.149)</blockquote>The college censors were not impressed by Ridgley or Dr Diodati, who was also delinquent, and &#145;considered that an example ought to be made of them&#146;  (ibid.). Ridgley would not submit, and further letters of recommendation were sent by the earl of Rutland and Viscount Rocheford. Finally, on 28 November 1622, Ridgley &#145;humbled himself before the College&#146;, &#145;gave an ex tempore speech in good Latin and submissive in tone, following which he was more acceptable&#146;, and was elected a fellow by the votes of all present  (ibid., 3.159).<br>
<br>Despite his initial problems with the college, Ridgley's time as a fellow gained him the respect of his colleagues. He was chosen as a censor in 1628, 1633, and 1638; and, according to Baldwin Hamey, did all that was asked of him without complaint. He was the model of the grave, learned physician, although at least one fellow, Peter Bowne, thought him too serious. But generally, the college and the public admired his honesty, his directness, his skill as a doctor, and the strong principles from which he seldom wavered. He was chosen as an elect on 2 September 1641; a supporter of the royalist cause, he resigned from this position on 24 May 1642 and withdrew from the college just as it was about to commit itself fully to parliament. He returned to the college in 1649.<br>
<br>As he was a physician of excellent reputation, Ridgley's comfortable income might have been greater, had he not limited the number of his patients. In 1618 he was among eighteen householders in Bassishaw ward who had &#145;taken the River Water into their houses&#146;. In 1621 Ridgley made a voluntary contribution to aid the elector of the Palatinate at the beginning of the Thirty Years' War. When the common council of London assessed Bassishaw ward in 1624, of 108 persons so assessed, 23 were rated higher than Ridgley. In 1636 Ridgley was among forty residents of the ward contributing ship money; only eight others contributed more, this being perhaps an early indication of his loyalty to Charles I. In 1638 Ridgley's house in St Michael Bassishaw was valued at &pound;26, a figure which placed him in the top 10 per cent of a large parish with perhaps 240 other householders.<br>
<br>Ridgley is best known as an early Helmontian or chemical physician. Samuel Hartlib wrote of him in 1654: &#145;Dr Ridgely an auncient physitian of the colledg the chiefest chymical doctor and preparing many excellent medicines &hellip; He bought up all Glauberian furnaces especially the 2nd with a new head, which Mr Boyle also hath&#146;  (Webster, 34). A &#145;Dr Ridgely&#146; was also among the &#145;chemically given&#146; physicians, named by George Starkey in 1657, who had repudiated Galenic medicine, although this may refer to Ridgley's son Luke, who shared the same chemical outlook.<br>
<br>Thomas Ridgley died at his house in London, possibly in the parish of St Sepulchre, on 21 June 1656 and was conveyed in a procession of college fellows, by candlelight, to the church of St Botolph's, Aldersgate, where he was interred. It was an honour that not even Sir Theodore Turquet de Mayerne or Thomas Winston had enjoyed. Ridgley's will, like the man, was short and direct. His money was to be divided into five equal parts, three-fifths going to his eldest son, Thomas, and two-fifths to his second son, Luke, who was also to receive &#145;all my books&#146; and household goods, and the rest of the estate not otherwise bequeathed. Luke was made sole executor of the will, which he proved on 27 September 1656. Ridgley's other two children, George and Mary, alive in 1633, were not mentioned in the will.<br>
