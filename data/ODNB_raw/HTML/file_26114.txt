<span class="headword">Spencer,  Aubrey George</span>  (1795&#150;1872), <span class="occ">bishop of Newfoundland</span>, born on 8 February 1795, was the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26140/', "William Robert Spencer (1770&#150;1834)")</script> author, and his wife, Susan, the widow of Count Spreti and the daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/14717/', "Francis Jenison, Count Jenison Walworth")</script>. His brother was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26126/', "George Trevor Spencer")</script>, bishop of Madras. He was educated at St Albans Abbey School and in Greenwich, and matriculated from Magdalen Hall, Oxford, on 28 March 1817, but did not graduate. After being ordained in 1819 Spencer worked for the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Newfoundland and the Bermudas, of which in 1825 he was appointed archdeacon. At about that time he married Eliza Musson, daughter of a rich Bermuda merchant; they had one son and three daughters.<br>
<br>In 1829 Spencer's devotion to Bermudan welfare and education led him to reject the offer of the archdeaconry of Newfoundland. However, in 1839, when Newfoundland was constituted a separate diocese, with the Bermudas under its care, Spencer was appointed its bishop. He was consecrated in London at Lambeth Palace on 4 August 1839; during his visit to Britain he was created DD of Oxford University. Spencer undertook the organization of his diocese, founded the theological college, and laid the first stone of the cathedral of St John's, besides helping to found twenty other churches. But his health was affected by the severe winters of Newfoundland, and on 28 November 1843 he was relieved to be appointed bishop of Jamaica, which included British Honduras and the Bahamas. Here his health improved a little, though a good deal of travelling was necessary. In October 1848 he visited the Bahamas and some years later he went to Havana. But in 1855 further poor health required him to resign.<br>
<br>Spencer returned to Britain and retired to Torquay, where he published <span class="italic">A Brief Account of the Church of England</span> (1867). He died at Torquay on 24 February 1872, his wife surviving him.<br>
