<span class="headword">Naughton,  William John Francis</span>  (1910&#150;1992), <span class="occ">writer</span>, was born on 12 June 1910 in Devlis, Ballyhaunis, co. Mayo, Ireland, the fourth of six children of Thomas Naughton (1873&#150;1957), a shopkeeper and railway worker, and then coalminer in England, and his wife, Maria, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Fleming (1875&#150;1949). The family emigrated to Bolton, Lancashire, in 1914, when Bill was four years old. He was educated at St Peter and St Paul School in Bolton, which is vividly recreated in fictionalized form in his novel <span class="italic">One Small Boy</span> (1957).<br>
<br>Leaving school at fourteen, Naughton first worked in a weaving shed, then in various labouring jobs between periods of unemployment. In 1930 he married Anne Wilcock (1905&#150;1985), a cotton mill worker, with whom he had three children, Marie, Larry, and Sean (who died in infancy). At this time he was working as a coal-bagger and driver for the Co-operative Society in Bolton. In 1938 Naughton, who was always keen on recording events, had the chance to develop his literary skills with the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/92530', "Mass-Observation")</script> study of Bolton (Worktown, as it was called), under the poet and sociologist Charles Madge. However, when Naughton became a conscientious objector in the war, the Co-op felt compelled to lay him off, and his marriage broke up soon afterwards (though the couple were not divorced until 1950). After a brief spell in Manchester he finally settled in London in 1941, where he became a civil defence corps driver. He also took to writing, publishing his first stories in 1943, in the <span class="italic">London Evening News</span>. Subsequent stories were published in <span class="italic">Lilliput</span> and broadcast on BBC radio, leading Madge to commission a book from him, the result being the very successful <span class="italic">A Roof Over your Head</span> (1945), Naughton's first volume of autobiography. This led to other commissions, including an article called &#145;The spiv&#146;, which brought the then obscure word into popular usage.<br>
<br>Though he published two novels in the 1940s, <span class="italic">Pony Boy</span> (1946) and <span class="italic">Rafe Granite</span> (1947), it was in the 1950s, as a playwright, that Naughton became well known, on both radio and television. He always claimed that <span class="italic">Coronation Street</span> drew on his radio play about a Lancashire street, <span class="italic">June Evening</span> (1958), which had been adapted for television just nine months before the soap opera began (1960). Many of his most celebrated works began on radio, going through television and theatre adaptations (with Bernard Miles, at the Mermaid Theatre), thence to film. Thus the radio play <span class="italic">My Flesh, my Blood</span> (1957) subsequently became <span class="italic">Spring and Port Wine</span> (filmed in 1970); <span class="italic">All in Good Time</span> (1961) became the film <span class="italic">The Family Way</span> (1966); and, most famously, <span class="italic">Alfie Elkins and his Little Life</span> (1962) was to become the internationally successful film (and novel) <span class="italic">Alfie</span> (1966), making a star of Michael Caine in the process. This won a Screenwriters Guild award (as did <span class="italic">The Family Way</span>), and was nominated for an Academy award of merit. His more experimental radio play <span class="italic">The Mystery</span> won the Prix Italia in 1974.<br>
<br>Among Naughton's last works are three highly evocative volumes of autobiography, <span class="italic">On the Pig's Back</span> (1987), <span class="italic">Saintly Billy</span> (1988), and <span class="italic">Neither Use nor Ornament</span> (1995), taking us back to life in Bolton during and after the First World War. These episodic memoirs also reveal the origins of some of his short stories, of which he wrote more than 200. The best-known are collected in <span class="italic">Late Night on Watling Street</span> (1959), although arguably his best, the much anthologized &#145;Spit Nolan&#146;, is to be found in his collection for children, <span class="italic">The Goalkeeper's Revenge</span> (1961), which won the Other award in 1978.<br>
<br>Naughton, a man of medium build, described himself as having a &#145;big head, blue eyes, and a round face&#146;  (Naughton, <span class="italic">On the Pig's Back</span>, 69), and in later life he had a distinctive moustache. He was a private man, refusing an entry in <span class="italic">Who's Who</span>, and also something of an outsider: first as an Irish Catholic living in Bolton, then as a northerner living in London, and finally as a self-educated, working-class writer among the literati of the time. But in 1968, after living in London from the 1940s to the 1960s at 64 St George's Square, Pimlico, he moved to Ballasalla on the Isle of Man with his second wife, the Austrian Ernestine (Erna) Pirolt (<i>b</i>. 1929), a nurse, whom he had married on 9 September 1952. He was heavily influenced by mystical writers, especially Thomas &agrave; Kempis&#151;after whom he named his house in Ballasalla, Kempis. Naughton was certainly driven to be honest in his observations of life, dismissing his own &#145;hack&#146; work as &#145;a sin against the Holy Spirit&#151;from which source all literature springs&#146;  (ibid., 33). He strove to capture actual speech patterns and rhythms, giving his writing a vibrancy and poignancy that only occasionally falls into sentimentality. (Five trunkfuls of his diaries, stretching from the 1930s to the 1990s, and running to several million words, are deposited at Bolton Library but will have to wait until 2015 before being opened to the public.) His overall contribution to the cultural ferment of the 1950s and 1960s has still to be properly assessed. Undoubtedly he was one of the first post-war writers to recreate, for the world, the authenticity of working-class life in the north of England. But his range was wider, as his London work, his contributions to popular television series (such as <span class="italic">Nathaniel Titlark</span>, <span class="italic">Starr and Company</span>, <span class="italic">Yorky</span>), his children's stories, and his more experimental, Pinteresque drama <span class="italic">The Mystery</span> show.<br>
<br>Towards the end of his life Naughton was consolidating his long-term interest in dreams, in an as-yet-unpublished volume, &#145;The Dream Mind&#146;, which he considered one of his most important works. He died at his home on the Isle of Man on 9 January 1992, shortly after a stroke, and was cremated on 14 January, to be interred at Rushen cemetery on the Isle of Man. His wife survived him.<br>
