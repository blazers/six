<span class="headword">May,  William</span>  (<em>c.</em>1505&#150;1560), <span class="occ">college head and archbishop-elect of York</span>, is said to have been a native of Suffolk. Nothing is known of his parentage, and his date of birth is unrecorded, but the course of his early career suggests a date about 1505. The John May who was bishop of Carlisle between 1577 and 1598 is often stated to have been his younger brother, but seems more likely to have been the nephew of that name mentioned in his will. William May entered Trinity Hall, Cambridge, in the early 1520s, advancing to the degree of BCL in 1526. In 1531 he was awarded his DCL and elected a fellow of Trinity Hall. In the following year he began his career as an ecclesiastical lawyer, becoming chancellor to Bishop Nicholas West of Ely. Following West's death that year he served as Archbishop Cranmer's vicar-general during the vacancy of the see, though securing his position was not easy, since the privy council had to intervene to wrest the register from the hands of the previous chancellor. Following the election of Thomas Goodrich as bishop in the spring of 1534 May became chancellor once more, and entered upon a career as a professional ecclesiastical bureaucrat. In 1534 he was Cranmer's commissary for the visitation of the diocese of Norwich, and in 1536 he was one of the king's commissioners for the visitation of Ely.<br>
<br>In 1535 May began to reap the rewards of his services. On 27 March 1535 he was instituted rector of Bishop's Hatfield, Hertfordshire, on condition that he take holy orders within fifteen months of his institution. On 2 April he was dispensed to take two holy orders in one day, which he presumably did, and on 20 May 1538 was dispensed to hold a benefice with the rectory at Hatfield, or two without it, to the value of &pound;9, so that he could hold the sinecure rectory of Littlebury, near Saffron Walden, to which he had already been admitted. Meanwhile his skills as an administrator had not been lost on his Cambridge community, and in 1537 he was elected president of Queens' College, beginning a long career as an academic leader.<br>
<br>There is no information about May's early religious opinions, but it is clear that Cranmer and Thomas Cromwell found him useful for reforming purposes. In 1537 he was one of the twenty-five hand-picked men called to meet with the bishops of the realm to prepare the <span class="italic">Institution of a Christian Man</span>, or <span class="roman">Bishops' Book</span>. His own contribution to this corporate effort is unidentifiable, but his evangelical sympathies and his effectiveness on a committee continued to advance him. In 1539 he served in the lower house of convocation, where he voted for clerical marriage and for the repudiation of transubstantiation, auricular confession, private masses, and communion in only one kind.<br>
<br>Although there is no evidence that May served as a commissioner for the dissolution of the monasteries, he benefited from it. When the Benedictine priory of St Peter and St Etheldreda was reconstituted as the secular chapter of Ely Cathedral on 10 September 1541 May was appointed to the third prebendal stall, joining Richard Cox and Matthew Parker. He had become rector of Balsham, a few miles east of Cambridge, in the previous year.<br>
<br>The early 1540s was a quiet time for the president of Queens', but in 1545 May was nominated by Henry VIII to be dean of St Paul's, London. Although the cathedral chapter was sent the order for his election on 29 October 1545, he was not formally elected until 15 February following. There seems to have been some legal quibbling by the chapter about May's appointment, but an order from the privy council forced the election. Meanwhile May, who also held the prebend of Chamberlainwood in St Paul's from 1 November 1545, became very busy in government service.<br>
<br>On 16 January 1546, along with Matthew Parker and another head of a college, May was appointed to a commission to report on the possessions of the Cambridge colleges. A statute of 1544 had given Henry VIII the power to dissolve chantries attached to colleges. Not only was he contemplating doing so, but land-hungry courtiers were hoping that he would also dissolve the colleges themselves. Parker and May delivered the resulting survey to the king, having carefully crafted it so as to prove that every college was underfunded. It so impressed the king that he was persuaded to let the colleges keep their property.<br>
<br>In August 1546 May was sent on a diplomatic mission to France as the junior to Sir William Petre. They were to claim the arrears on 512,000 crowns in pensions owed by France to England under an agreement of 1529. The French arrived after the treaty had expired and the negotiations failed, but Petre's report includes a description of May: &#145;who &hellip; is of honest sort, wise, discreet, and well learned &hellip; Meet to serve his majesty in many ways&#146;  (<span class="italic">State Papers, Henry VIII</span>, 11.293, n. 1). The mission of 1546 did indeed begin a period of intense government service for May, in which his legal expertise was to the fore. In 1547 he served as a commissioner examining debtors imprisoned in Ludgate who wished to compound with their creditors, and he was appointed to two commissions to hear divorce appeals. In one, William Parr, first marquess of Northampton, wanted to remarry after his divorce, even though his former wife was still living. In the other Dr Robert Huick was appealing against a decision that held that he could not divorce his wife.<br>
<br>The accession of Edward VI brought May many new responsibilities. He was clearly thought trustworthy to carry out the protestant agenda of the new establishment, and by late 1547 he was heavily involved in reforming St Paul's, overseeing the destruction of the high altar and the abolition of obits and chantries. In November he was appointed a royal visitor to the dioceses of Salisbury, Exeter, Bristol, Bath and Wells, and Gloucester, where he and his fellow commissioners forbade the use of black copes and scapulars because they were monkish. They also tried to end ringing for the dead, and instructed that prime and the hours need not be said in Wells Cathedral in order to make time for a divinity lecture immediately after high mass. Present at the convocation at the end of 1547, May subscribed the ordinance for taking communion in both kinds and voted in favour of clerical marriage. Late in 1552 or 1553 he himself married Joan Heynes, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Walron, the widow of Dr Simon Heynes, the previous president of Queens' and also May's close colleague.<br>
<br>In November 1548, still president of Queens', May was placed on the commission to visit Cambridge University and Eton College, enforcing the dissolution of obits and chantries. As he went up to the university in March 1549 he assured Matthew Parker, now vice-chancellor, that the visitation would be orderly and moderate. It is not clear whether he favoured the proposed union of Trinity Hall and Clare College to create a college of civil law, but he was willing to vote for expelling the master and fellows of Clare for their resistance to the plan.<br>
<br>Over the next few years May was fully engaged in enforcing Edwardian reforms. A commissioner to search for heretics, Anabaptists, and libertines every year from 1549 to 1552, he sat on the panel that found the martyr Joan Bocher guilty of Arianism. When Bishop Bonner of London was accused of contempt of the king's order for reformation, May was appointed to the commission to try him. And after Bonner was deprived, May, as dean of St Paul's, officiated at the installation of Nicholas Ridley as the new bishop of London.<br>
<br>By the 1550s May had become a noted ecclesiastical lawyer, performing major tasks for the crown. Most notably he was named to the committee of thirty-two for drafting (abortively) a new canon law for the church in England. He was one of the subcommittee that drafted the <span class="italic">Reformatio legum ecclesiasticarum</span> in 1551 and 1552. He was also involved in creating the 1552 <span class="roman">Book of Common Prayer</span>, though in what capacity is not clear. He served on other government commissions, too, while being actively involved in St Paul's and Queens'.<br>
<br>All of this ended with the accession of Queen Mary in 1553. Deprived on the grounds of his marriage of the presidency of Queens', the deanship of St Paul's, and his prebend at Ely, May none the less conformed enough to keep his rooms at Queens' from 1554 until 1558. In 1557 moreover he became rector of Pulham Norfolk, and of Stanton St Michael, Cambridgeshire.<br>
<br>The accession of Elizabeth brought May back into the public arena. He was named in the &#145;Device for alteration of religion&#146;, prepared late in 1558, as one to be consulted about revising the <span class="roman">Book of Common Prayer</span> in preparation for the restoration of protestantism, though the committee probably never met, and in June 1559 he resumed the presidency of Queens' College, and was readmitted as dean of St Paul's, now with the prebend of Wenlocksbarn. Later that year he was appointed a commissioner to impose the Elizabethan settlement on Cambridge, and also proctor for archbishop-elect Matthew Parker.<br>
<br>On 25 July 1560 May was nominated to become archbishop of York, but on 7 August, feeble and sick, he made his will. He died in London on 8 August, the same day that he was elected archbishop. Buried in St Paul's on 12 August, May left a considerable estate to his wife, Joan, to his children, William and Elizabeth, and to his stepchildren. In his will he mentions lands and bequests worth more than &pound;732, as well as plate, horses, and uncollected debts of unspecified value. The executors of his estate were Richard Coxe, bishop of Ely, and Richard Goodrich. He named Edmund Grindal, bishop of London, John Mullens, archdeacon of London, and Thomas Yale, supervisors of his will.<br>
