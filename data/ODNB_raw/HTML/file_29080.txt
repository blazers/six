<span class="headword">West,  Francis</span>  (1586&#150;1633/4), <span class="occ">colonial governor</span>, was born on 28 October 1586, probably at the family seat of Wherwell Abbey, Hampshire, the fourth but second surviving son of Thomas West, second Baron De La Warr (1555/6&#150;1602), nobleman, and Anne, daughter of Sir Francis Knollys. West arrived in Virginia in 1608 with the second expedition under Captain Christopher Newport to provide the colony with supplies. That autumn he accompanied Newport in his fruitless exploration some 30 miles beyond the falls of the James River, and at the end of the year went with Captain John Smith, who had recently become the president of the colony's council, on his successful quest for food supplies from the Powhatans. With twenty men West then went back to the falls, seeking corn but finding only berries and acorns.<br>
<br>In May 1609 the Virginia Company secured a new royal charter which, <i>inter alia</i>, replaced the elected president of the council in the colony by a governor (and captain-general) appointed by the company in London. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29100/', "Thomas West, third Baron De La Warr")</script>, West's elder brother, was to be the first governor, and Sir Thomas Gates was sent immediately as his deputy with a fleet of nine ships. In late summer 1609 six of the vessels straggled into the Chesapeake, and almost at once there was trouble. Among those arriving was Gabriel Archer, an old opponent of Captain Smith. The latter gained the support of the mariners, but the gentlemen, egged on by Archer, wanted the young Francis West as Smith's successor and secured his appointment to the Jamestown council. Henceforth he was, if not a leader, at least a figurehead of the gentry who sought autonomy within the colony. Smith, however, was still president of the council, and to avoid the prospect of starvation in the coming winter, just before his departure from the colony that autumn he dispersed the colonists up and down the river, sending West to the falls with more than a hundred men, where West Fort was established. But West was not there long. During the &#145;starving time&#146; that winter he commanded one of the colony's three vessels and sought food for Jamestown. That done, deserting the colony, he sailed for England at the very time his brother Thomas was <i>en route</i> for Virginia.<br>
<br>West soon returned to the colony. In 1612 he succeeded George Percy as commander at Jamestown, and in 1617 was appointed master of the ordnance. By 1614 at the latest he and his younger brothers were in possession of 500 acres at Westover on the north bank of the James near the falls. The exact bounds of the estate were uncertain, and in 1619 there was a dispute with the new governor, Sir George Yeardley, when, according to the Wests, Yeardley assigned part of their holding to the associates of Berkeley hundred. Visiting England in 1620, West joined with other &#145;ancient planters&#146; who were also there seeking the appointment of a governor of &#145;Eminence, or Nobillytie&#146;  (Kingsbury, 3.231).<br>
<br>Yeardley's successor, Sir Francis Wyatt, was instructed in July 1621 to reappoint West to the Jamestown council despite his absence from the colony. Indeed West may at that time have considered abandoning it altogether, for in November 1622 Sir Ferdinando Gorges appointed him admiral of New England and a member of the council there advising the governor-general. Briefly in Virginia in March 1623, West then spent the summer in New England waters, but, finding &#145;the fisher men to be stuberne fellows&#146;  (<span class="italic">History of Plymouth Plantation</span>, 1.312), he was back in Virginia by the end of the year.<br>
<br>Participating thereafter in council activity, West married late in 1625 or in 1626 Margaret (<i>d</i>. 1627/8), the widow of Edward Blaney. They had a son, Francis, and a daughter, Elizabeth&#151;who was apparently dead by 1629. Margaret herself died in the winter of 1627&#150;8. In 1626 Wyatt had returned to England and Sir George Yeardley became interim governor, but Yeardley too died in little more than a year, whereupon West became governor and on 28 March 1628 married Yeardley's widow, Temperance (<i>d</i>. 1628), daughter of Anthony Flowerdew. She died at the year's end, and three months later, perhaps to settle her estate, West left for England, where before the end of the year he had married Jane, daughter of Sir Henry Davye, and had made his will. While there he opposed Lord Baltimore's plan for a colony within Virginia's boundaries. Back in Virginia by the end of 1631, he resumed his seat on the council, where he sat for the last time on 9 February 1633. His widow proved his will in England on 28 April 1634. A family tradition alleges that he had been drowned.<br>
<br>Politically West's career was of minor significance; but socially, following George Percy's departure, he and his brothers were indisputably the first family in Virginia. Perhaps his career is most noteworthy, however, as an example of the frequency with which early Virginians took to the water. In addition to cruising Chesapeake Bay in search of corn, West crossed the Atlantic seven times in twenty-four years, and made at least one round voyage to New England.<br>
