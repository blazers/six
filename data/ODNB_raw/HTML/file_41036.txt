<span class="headword">Plummer,  Alfred</span>  (1841&#150;1926), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and biblical scholar</span>, was born on 17 February 1841 at Heworth vicarage, co. Durham, third son of the Revd Matthew Plummer (1807/8&#150;1898), vicar of Heworth and his wife, Louisa, daughter of J. D. Powles. He was educated at Lancing College, Sussex, and at Exeter College, Oxford (Gifford exhibitioner; first class in moderations, 1861; second class in <i>literae humaniores</i>, 1863). He was fellow of Trinity College, Oxford (1865&#150;75; tutor and dean, 1867&#150;74), master of University College, Durham (1874&#150;1902; <i>ad eundem</i> MA 1874; honorary DD 1882; junior proctor 1875; senior proctor 1877&#150;94; sub-warden 1896). He was ordained deacon in 1866, but proceeded no further in orders. He married on 29 December 1874 Bertha Katharine (<i>b</i>. 1852/3), daughter of the Revd William Frederick Everest canon of Truro; they had one son and one daughter, and his wife survived him. He retired in 1902 and lived until his death in Bideford, Devon. He died suddenly (while playing the piano) on 17 April 1926, at his home, Dulany, Bideford.<br>
<br>Plummer's career at Oxford was good though hardly outstanding, but his election to a fellowship at Trinity suggests that he had made a good impression on his seniors. His subsequent achievements and writings reveal sound and careful scholarship but few sparks of brilliance and originality. There is probably some truth in the story that at Durham, where in addition to college administration he taught theology, he lectured through the gospel of <span class="roman">St Luke</span> at the rate of about two chapters a year. A more serious estimate was that his lectures, which explained the text of the Greek <span class="roman">New Testament</span> in great detail, were much appreciated by men who cared for scrupulous scholarship, but disliked by those wanting to pass examinations with minimum effort. He was a respected and well-liked head of house, who never sought or received the cheaper sort of popularity. He was widely known by his nickname, Polycarp.<br>
<br>The impression given by Plummer's career, and by anecdotes of his teaching, is confirmed by his numerous publications. That he enjoyed a reputation as a careful and accurate scholar of wide reading is attested by the fact that he was a founding and long-serving general editor of the <span class="roman">International Critical Commentary</span>, in which his colleagues were S. R. Driver and C. A. Briggs. Plummer was himself a notable contributor to the series. His commentary on <span class="roman">Luke</span> in 1896 was one of the first of the series to appear. The epistles to the <span class="roman">Corinthians</span> were originally assigned to A. Robertson, a friend of Plummer at Oxford and Durham, but Robertson's appointment as principal of King's College, London, and later as bishop of Exeter, made it necessary for Plummer to collaborate with him on <span class="roman">1 Corinthians</span> and to take over <span class="roman">2 Corinthians</span> completely. His expositions are solid rather than original, and based on detailed study of the Greek text. He kept his Greek scholarship up to date. In the index to <span class="roman">Luke</span> there are no references to papyri; in the index to <span class="roman">1 Corinthians</span> (1911) there are twenty-one (together with forty-six to A. Deissmann and eighteen to J. H. Moulton, the two earliest exponents of the newly discovered papyri).<br>
<br>Plummer also wrote commentaries, mostly on a smaller scale, on <span class="roman">Matthew</span>, <span class="roman">Mark</span>, <span class="roman">John</span>, <span class="roman">Philippians</span>, <span class="roman">1 and 2 Thessalonians</span>, the pastoral epistles, <span class="roman">James</span>, <span class="roman">2 Peter</span>, 1, 2, and 3 <span class="roman">John</span>, and <span class="roman">Jude</span>. Some of these were written in retirement, but at that time Plummer turned rather to church history, especially English church history. He evidently hoped to demonstrate and also to encourage the catholicity and holiness of the Church of England; Johann Joseph Ignaz D&ouml;llinger, the Bavarian priest and church historian, was an important influence. Plummer's most important books were <span class="italic">The Church of the Early Fathers</span> (1887); <span class="italic">Lectures on English Church History, 1575&#150;1649</span> (1904), <span class="italic">1509&#150;1575</span> (1905), <span class="italic">1649&#150;1702</span> (1906); <span class="italic">The Church of England in the Eighteenth Century</span> (1910); and <span class="italic">The Church in Britain before AD 1000</span> (1911). Plummer also published sermons and devotional works.<br>
<br>In addition to his own writing of church history Plummer translated some of the works of D&ouml;llinger (who dissented from the infallibility decree of the First Vatican Council). More important was his personal contact with D&ouml;llinger, whom he visited, in Munich and at Tegernsee, fifteen times between 1870 and 1889. It seems that he first sought acquaintance with D&ouml;llinger as an outstanding church historian, but a friendship developed which led to extensive conversations dealing with many topics&#151;in history, theology, and politics, both ecclesiastical and secular, especially in Germany and England but also elsewhere. These were recorded by Plummer in notebooks (later preserved at Pusey House, Oxford, and edited by R. Boudens, 1985). Plummer himself presented some of the material in <span class="italic">The Churchman</span> and <span class="italic">The Expositor</span>. Of special importance are his accounts of the two reunion conferences held at Bonn in 1874 and 1875 under D&ouml;llinger's presidency between representatives of the Old Catholics, the Church of England, and the Orthodox church, with some occasional and not very significant Lutheran participation. Important theological and ecclesiastical questions were discussed and a measure of agreement reached, but with little or no practical result.<br>
<br>Those who knew Plummer in Durham recalled &#145;the pale-faced, bearded figure, the deep voice, the usual address, &#147;My dear fellow&#148;&#146;  (<span class="italic">Durham University Journal</span>, 24, 1926, 439).<br>
