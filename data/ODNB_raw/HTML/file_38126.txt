<span class="headword">Wilde,  Henry</span>  (1833&#150;1919), <span class="occ">electrical engineer and inventor</span>, was born in Manchester. He may be the Henry Wilde who was the son of Horatio Wilde and his wife Hannah, and who was baptized on 17 February 1833. At the age of sixteen, he was left without parents in charge of a younger brother and sister. After being educated in private schools, he was apprenticed to a mechanical engineer, and before the age of twenty-one had attained a position of responsibility in the works. At this time he was already experimenting with voltaic cells, electrical machines and kites, and the electro-deposition of metals.<br>
<br>In 1856 Wilde established a business in Manchester as an electric-telegraph and lightning-conductor engineer, and spent some years on the development of a magneto-electric alphabetic telegraph, which was demonstrated at the international exhibition in London in 1862. In December 1863 he patented a twin-armature machine in which a magneto-electric generator provided excitation current for the field winding of another generator. These machines were made in quantity by Wilde &amp; Co., but in use they had the disadvantage of becoming very hot. In 1867 he patented an entirely different type of multipolar machine, which was used for electro-deposition and arc lighting. Among his other patents was one in 1875 for the making of copper rollers for calico printing.<br>
<br>Wilde nearly discovered the principle of self-excitation, but other inventors achieved it first, notably Charles Wheatstone and the Siemens brothers. In 1898, having since 1871 styled himself &#145;electrical engineer&#146;, he was elected an honorary member of the Institution of Electrical Engineers, and the following year contributed the sum of &pound;1500 to a benevolent fund for the benefit of their members. At the same time, he thought it desirable to submit to them an autobiographical statement, which was published in the <span class="italic">Journal of the Institution of Electrical Engineers</span>.<br>
<br>Wilde published many other papers in the <span class="italic">Proceedings of the Royal Society</span> and elsewhere, especially after his retirement in 1884, on a wide variety of subjects, including the magnetization of iron, atomic weights, the spectrum of thallium, the moving force of celestial bodies, aerial locomotion, and the velocity with which air rushes into a vacuum. He made arclights as searchlights for the Royal Navy (1874); after the <i>Titanic</i> disaster in 1912 he strongly urged that mercantile vessels should be fitted with searchlights. He invented the magnetarium for reproducing the phenomena of terrestrial magnetism and the secular variation of the mariner's compass (1890).<br>
<br>He was elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1866, and was awarded the Albert gold medal of the Royal Society of Arts in 1900. He had an honorary DSc from the Victoria University of Manchester (1900), and a DCL from Oxford University (1903). He was a liberal benefactor, during his lifetime and in his will, of the Manchester Literary and Philosophical Society, the University of Oxford, and the Acad&eacute;mie des Sciences, Paris. He died of heart failure &#145;accelerated by want of medical attention&#146; at his residence, The Hurst, Macclesfield Road, Alderley Edge, Cheshire, on 28 March 1919. He had been a widower for twenty-six years, and had no children.<br>
