<span class="headword">Hewson,  William</span>  (1806&#150;1870), <span class="occ">theological writer</span>, was born on 12 April 1806 and baptized at St Margaret's, Westminster, on 28 December in the same year, the son of William Hewson of 7 Tottenham Court New Road, London, clerk in a bank. He entered St Paul's School, London, on 9 October 1815. He won an exhibition and proceeded to St John's College, Cambridge, in 1826, where he was elected to a scholarship in 1826 and graduated BA in 1830 and MA in 1833. He was ordained deacon (London) on 6 June 1830 and priest (York) in 1831, holding the curacy of Bishop Burton in the East Riding of Yorkshire from June 1830 to 1833. He married on 2 November 1830 Mary Ann (<i>d</i>. 1861), only child of Samuel and Mary Reckster, and widow of Lieutenant Alfred A. Yeakell. They had two children, Frances Ann (<i>b</i>. 1833) and John Singleton (1835&#150;1850).<br>
<br>From January 1834 Hewson was curate of Spofforth, Yorkshire, for one year, and then became headmaster of Sherburn grammar school, Yorkshire, in 1835, with Sunday duty as a curate in Sherburn parish. From January 1838 until June 1844 he was headmaster of the cathedral school of St Peter's, York. He had little teaching ability and presided over a decline in pupil numbers, loss of discipline, and staff unrest. The dean and chapter set up a committee to inquire into the state of the school in 1842. After the dean withdrew his support for Hewson in 1844 he was dismissed, although he was later granted a pension.<br>
<br>In 1848 the archbishop of York presented Hewson to the perpetual curacy of Goathland, worth only &pound;53 a year, with permission to reside at Whitby, as there was no house for the incumbent in the parish. Hewson succeeded in obtaining an increased stipend of &pound;275 a year. He began to build a house, which was nearly completed at the time of his death.<br>
<br>Hewson was a laborious writer, and produced twenty-six publications, mainly on comparative religion and on prophecy and its fulfilment. His method of exposition was not lucid, and his works were little read. His favourite belief was that the book of <span class="roman">Revelation</span> was an inspired interpretation of the spirit of Jewish prophecy. He died from disease of the heart at 1 St Hilda Terrace, Whitby, on 23 April 1870, and was buried, as had been his wife and son, in York cemetery. His daughter completed the publication of her father's Hebrew and Greek scriptures in 1870.<br>
