<span class="headword">Bouverie, Sir  Henry Frederick</span>  (1783&#150;1852), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, third son of the Hon. Edward Bouverie (1738&#150;1810)&#151;son of Jacob Bouverie, first Viscount Folkestone (<i>c</i>.1694&#150;1761), MP for Salisbury (1761&#150;71) and Northampton (1790&#150;1810)&#151;and his wife, Harriet (<i>d</i>. 1831), only daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9228/', "Sir Everard Fawkener")</script>, sometime ambassador to the Porte, was born on 11 July 1783. In 1811 Bouverie's widowed mother married Lord Robert Spencer, son of the third duke of Marlborough, but had no further children. Edward (1767&#150;1858) and John (1779&#150;1855) were Bouverie's brothers; Henrietta (<i>d</i>. 1810), Frances, Mary (<i>d</i>. 1816), Jane (<i>d</i>. 1865), and Diana his sisters. Bouverie went to Eton College in May 1793, and on leaving about 1798 joined the 2nd dragoon guards at Hertford before moving to London as an ensign in the Coldstream Guards on 23 October 1799. He advanced to lieutenant and captain in the Coldstreams (19 November 1800) and served in Ireland, where he was adjutant to a detachment at Bandon. He went with his regiment on Lieutenant-General Sir Ralph Abercromby's expedition to Egypt, landing under heavy fire with its light company at Abu Qir Bay on 8 March 1801. He saw further action on 13 March, and commanded a company during the battle of Alexandria on 21 March. Homeward bound in May, his ship was captured and Bouverie taken prisoner. Swiftly exchanged, before the close of 1801 he was in Scotland as aide-de-camp to Major-General Lord Rosslyn, his sister Henrietta's husband. After the peace of Amiens (March 1802) he travelled to Russia on a military mission, but was recalled to Ireland, once more as aide-de-camp to Rosslyn, when hostilities were resumed (May 1803). In 1806 he accompanied Rosslyn (then lieutenant-general) on a mission to Portugal and was with him the next year during the bombardment of Copenhagen (September 1807).<br>
<br>On 31 December 1808 Bouverie embarked for Portugal with the Coldstreams' 1st battalion, on 27 April 1809 being appointed aide-de-camp and assistant military secretary to Lieutenant-General Sir Arthur Wellesley. He was with Wellesley at the crossing of the Douro (12 May) and battle of Talavera (27&#150;8 July), where he was wounded above the right knee and temporarily deafened after being knocked off his horse. To his mother Bouverie described Talavera as &#145;the most desperate battle that ever was fought&#146;  (Hammersley, 4). On advancing to captain and lieutenant-colonel (28 June 1810), Bouverie went back to the Coldstreams' depot in England, returning to Portugal with regimental reinforcements on 25 December 1811. Shortly after taking part in the successful siege of Badajoz (April&#150;May 1812), Bouverie became assistant adjutant-general to the 4th division, with which he was present at the battles of Salamanca (22 July 1812), Vitoria (21 June 1813), the Nive (10 December 1813, where he was mentioned in dispatches), and Orthez (27 February 1814), as well as the siege and storming of San Sebastian (July&#150;August 1813). After the fighting ended, he was named adjutant-general to a force for the war against the United States, but peace was signed (December 1814) before it sailed.<br>
<br>Bouverie became an extra aide-de-camp to the prince regent and brevet colonel on 4 June 1814. He briefly commanded a Coldstream battalion in Brussels before being superseded by a more senior officer and therefore missing the battle of Waterloo, &#145;owing to which I am in all probability writing this journal&#146;  (Hammersley, 5). Meanwhile, on 2 January 1815, he had been appointed KCB, and for his services in the Peninsula he received the army gold cross and one clasp for Salamanca, Vitoria, San Sebastian, the Nive, and Orthez. Remaining in England, Bouverie obtained a majority in the Coldstreams (18 January 1820), but left the regiment on promotion to major-general (27 May 1825). On 8 July 1826 he married Julia, daughter of Lewis Montolieu and widow of Captain William Wilbraham RN, and they had two children: Henry Montolieu (<i>b</i>. 1831?), killed at Inkerman in 1854, and Henrietta (<i>b</i>. 1830?). Shortly after his marriage Bouverie commanded the brigade of guards with Lieutenant-General Sir Henry Clinton's expedition to Portugal in support of the young queen being threatened by Spanish-backed opponents. On its arrival in December 1826 the brigade stayed at Cartaxo, then Santarem, before marching to suppress riots in Lisbon. Bouverie left Portugal in April 1828, when the constitutional dispute had been solved. Meanwhile, on 2 February 1827 he had written to congratulate Wellington on his appointment as colonel of the Grenadier Guards, assuring the duke &#145;that the high character of that distinguished regiment&#146; had been illustrated in the force under his command, however contriving also to inform the duke that his brigade &#145;is at present very much inconvenienced by the non-arrival of a paymaster&#146;  (Hamilton, 92). Three months later, on 8 May, Clinton expressed to Bouverie his &#145;real satisfaction &hellip; [at] the general good conduct and appearance&#146; of the troops which he led  (ibid., 93).<br>
<br>From the end of 1828, for almost eight years, Bouverie commanded the northern district in England. Then a widower accompanied by two small children, on 1 October 1836 he was appointed governor and commander-in-chief at Malta, where he was credited with building several new roads, vastly improving the island's water supply, and, less profoundly, personally giving up snuff. Following the death of William IV, Queen Adelaide spent the winter of 1837&#150;8 in Malta as Bouverie's guest and laid the foundation-stone of the first English church located outside the governor's palace. Bouverie received the GCMG on leaving Malta in June 1843. Promoted lieutenant-general (28 June 1838), he became colonel of the 1st West India regiment (13 May 1842), then of the 97th foot (21 November 1843), and was appointed GCB (18 June 1852). In 1846 he was approached to be commander-in-chief in Canada, &#145;but being grown old and puffy and blind, I wisely declined&#146;  (Hammersley, 5). The following year at Woolbeding, near Midhurst, in Sussex, where his clergyman brother John was rector, he declared himself &#145;blessed with children whom I dearly love &hellip; far happier than I deserve to be&#146;  (ibid., 5). As he was preparing to attend the duke of Wellington's funeral in London, Bouverie suddenly fell ill at Woolbeding House, bequeathed to his sister Diana (wife of the Hon. George Ponsonby) by their stepfather, and died there on 14 November 1852.<br>
