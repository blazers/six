<span class="headword">Bernard,  Thomas Dehany</span>  (1815&#150;1904), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, second son of Charles Bernard of Eden estate, Jamaica, the descendant of a Huguenot family, and his wife, Margaret, daughter of John Baker of Waresley House, Worcestershire, was born at Clifton on 11 November 1815. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2247/', "Mountague Bernard")</script> was his brother. After private education he matriculated on 2 December 1833 from Exeter College, Oxford, and in 1837 was placed in the second class of the final classical school. He graduated BA in 1838, when he won the Ellerton theological prize with the essay &#145;On the conduct and character of St Peter&#146;. In 1839 he was awarded the chancellor's prize for an English essay, &#145;The classical taste and character compared with the Romantic&#146;. He proceeded MA in 1840. In 1841 he married Caroline (<i>d</i>. 1881), daughter of Benjamin Linthorne of High Hall, Wimborne. They had two sons and seven daughters. In 1840 he was ordained deacon and licensed to the curacy of Great Baddow, Essex. Ordained priest in 1841, he succeeded to the vicarage of Great Baddow, where he remained until 1846. After working for a short time as curate of Harrow on the Hill, he became in 1848 vicar of Terling, Essex, showing a keen interest in the cause of foreign missions. He was select preacher at Oxford in 1858, 1862, and 1882. In 1864 he delivered the Bampton lectures, published as <span class="italic">The Progress of Doctrine in the New Testament</span> (5th edn 1900). In later life, Bernard published several other works; though his greatest talents undoubtedly lay in parish work and administration, contemporaries admired his <span class="italic">Before his Presence with a Song</span> (1885) and <span class="italic">The Central Teachings of Jesus Christ</span> (1892).<br>
<br>Of strong evangelical sympathies, Bernard was appointed by Charles Simeon's trustees to the rectory of Walcot, Bath, in 1864. There Bernard's gifts of organization were called into play. He increased the church accommodation and built St Andrew's Church and schools. In 1867 the bishop of Bath and Wells collated him to a prebendal stall in Wells Cathedral; and next year the dean and chapter elected him to a residentiary canonry. He succeeded to the chancellorship of the cathedral in 1879, and from 1880 to 1895 represented the chapter in convocation. Bernard was as zealous a cathedral dignitary as he was an energetic town rector. He revived the cathedral grammar school, at his own cost provided buildings for it, established a high school for girls, and interested himself in the general parochial life of Wells. An evangelical whom all trusted, though unfettered by party conventions, Bernard was a frequent speaker at the Islington clerical meeting, the most important annual gathering of Anglican evangelicals in his day. He resigned Walcot in 1886, and went to live at Wimborne, Dorset. In 1901 he retired from his canonry, retaining only the unpaid office of chancellor. He died at his home, High Hall, Wimborne, on 7 December 1904. Bernard had gained a reputation as a scholar and a man of affairs, and as a wise counsellor in private and a clear, cogent teacher in public.<br>
