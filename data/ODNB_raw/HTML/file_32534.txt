<span class="headword">Constant,  Hayne</span>  (1904&#150;1968), <span class="occ">mechanical and aeronautical engineer</span>, was born at Gravesend, Kent, on 26 September 1904, the second son of the family of six children of Frederick Charles Constant, dental surgeon, of Gravesend and later Folkestone, and his wife, (Mary) Theresa Hayne, of Northfleet, Kent. Educated at King's College choir school, Cambridge, King's School, Canterbury, the Technical Institute in Folkestone, and Sir Roger Manwood's School in Sandwich, he entered Queens' College, Cambridge, in 1924 as an open exhibitioner where he took a second class in part one of the mathematical tripos (1925) followed by a first class in the mechanical sciences tripos (1927). He was awarded a college scholarship. After taking his degree in 1927 Constant stayed in Cambridge for a postgraduate year to work on the torsional vibration of crankshafts which he reported in his first publication. For the next six years he was a member of the engine department of the Royal Aircraft Establishment (RAE), Farnborough, working on carburettors, dynamometers, and the effects of vibration on aircraft. A paper to the Royal Aeronautical Society describing and analysing tests on a biplane suspended upside down and vibrated by rotating masses mounted on the aircraft won him the Busk memorial prize in 1932.<br>
<br>From 1934 to 1936 Constant held the post of lecturer at Imperial College, but found it not to his liking and returned to RAE where, in July 1936, he was put in charge of the supercharger section under Dr A. A. Griffith, head of the engine department. After a few months, in March 1937, Constant presented a case to the Aeronautical Research Council for the development of the aircraft gas turbine engine. Working almost alone he had designed a small axial flow compressor and various gas turbine engine schemes which were described in his report. The report was well received and authority was given to start a programme, mainly in collaboration with Metropolitan-Vickers, for the development of gas turbine engines, involving the design, building, and testing of some six axial flow compressors and several parts of gas turbine engines.<br>
<br>Meanwhile a prototype of Frank Whittle's turbojet engine, made by Power Jets Ltd, was tested in 1937 and from then on its further development was supported by the Air Ministry. Constant saw the Whittle scheme as applicable only to short-range high altitude fighter aircraft, but with the outbreak of war in 1939 he suggested to Power Jets that a jet engine with the flow passing straight through an axial compressor, an annular combustion chamber, and axial flow turbine should be jointly developed. In the event Constant's scheme was developed and built by Metropolitan-Vickers. It was flight-tested in 1943 and became the prototype of the modern jet engine. It was Constant's most important individual contribution to aircraft propulsion. His other contributions ranged from his rule for determining the flow angle leaving a cascade of compressor blades, the specification and layout of other axial flow jet engines, and his leadership of the research and development programme which continued at RAE after he became head of the engine department in 1941, and then later at Pyestock near Farnborough after the end of the war.<br>
<br>From 1941 the team in the turbine division of the RAE engine department grew in numbers and facilities, but in 1944, much to Constant's dismay, the division was transferred from RAE to merge with Power Jets Ltd as a nationalized company: Power Jets (Research and Development) Ltd. Two years later this became the National Gas Turbine Establishment based at Pyestock with Constant as deputy, then director. In 1948 Constant was elected fellow of the Royal Society and won the James Clayton prize of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers. In 1951 he was appointed CBE and in 1958 CB. In 1963 he was awarded the gold medal of the Royal Aeronautical Society. He published twenty-three papers, ten patent specifications, and an unpretentious book, <span class="italic">Gas Turbines and their Problems</span> (1948), revised and enlarged in 1953.<br>
<br>In 1960 Constant reluctantly left Pyestock to become scientific adviser to the Air Ministry and then chief scientist (RAF), Ministry of Defence (1964). His friends thought he was not very happy in Whitehall and that he obviously would have preferred to remain in research and inventive activities.<br>
<br>Constant was a man of austere habit and thought with a self-contained reserve, but with a keen mind delighting in logical argument about technical matters. He would question the facts and objectives, almost arrogantly, behind any proposed design or development, sharpening each point of decision by arguments based on facts and fundamental physical principles, an approach which did not always endear him to his superiors, but greatly encouraged the younger engineers on his staff. In committee his speech was precise and economical. He was not only concerned about the professional development and rewards of his staff, but also their housing and sports. He was unmarried and his relaxations included tennis, skiing, amateur dramatics, motorcycles, sailing and boat building, and light music. It was typical of him to tackle each of them with zest and enjoy them with others and then to proceed to the next interest. He retired in 1962 to live in the bungalow of his own design, Ripelhyrst, Kiln Way, Grayshott, Hindhead, Surrey, where he died on 12 January 1968.<br>
