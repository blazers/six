<span class="headword">Oglethorpe, Sir  Theophilus</span>  (1650&#150;1702), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was born at Oglethorpe Hall, Bramham, Yorkshire, and baptized on 14 September 1650 at Bramham, the son of Sutton Oglethorpe (<i>b</i>. 1612) and Frances, widow of Mark Pickering, daughter of John Matthew, and granddaughter of Tobie Matthew, archbishop of York. He came from an ancient Yorkshire family which had occupied the estate of Oglethorpe in the parish of Bramham since before the Norman conquest. His father was a royalist colonel during the first civil war, and governor of Beverston Castle, near Bristol, in 1644. For participation in the second civil war he was arrested in 1651 and fined &pound;20,000, obliging the sale in 1653 of the heavily mortgaged Oglethorpe estate to Henry Fairfax of Bolton Priory. Sutton Oglethorpe married in 1635. He and his wife had two sons; the elder, Sutton (1637&#150;1727), a student at Gray's Inn in 1657 and MA (Oxon), 28 September 1663, became a page to Charles II, master of the royal stud, and in 1684 collector of the customs at Carlisle.<br>
<br>Theophilus Oglethorpe entered the military profession and trained in the French army from 1668, probably in Sir George Hamilton's English <i>gens d'armes</i>. He was a captain in Sir Henry Jones's regiment of light horse in the French army from 1672 until 1 February 1675, when he transferred into the duke of Monmouth's Royal English regiment, likewise in the service of Louis XIV. He returned to England in 1678 and was commissioned major of the Royal Dragoons on 19 February. On 10 July 1678 he was additionally appointed brigadier and lieutenant of the duke of York's troop of the life guard. Major Oglethorpe, at the head of his troop of the Royal Dragoons, led the van of Monmouth's small army against the Scottish covenanters at Crookham (14 September 1678) and Bothwell Bridge (22 June 1679). His modest exploits were rewarded by elevation, on 31 August, to guidon and major of the duke of York's troop of the life guard; and then to lieutenant and lieutenant-colonel on 1 November 1680, by which time he had relinquished his commission in the Royal Dragoons. In 1680 he married Eleanor Wall (1662&#150;1732), daughter of Richard Wall of Rathkennan, co. Tipperary, a Roman Catholic and head laundress to Charles II, earning &pound;2000 p.a. Eleanor, or Ellen, was a forceful, determined woman who had considerable political acumen, which she was to employ on behalf of the Jacobites.<br>
<br>Oglethorpe was a rake and a thug. He killed John Richardson in a duel in 1681 (he is known to have accepted at least two other challenges), was involved in the murder of Thomas Thynne by Count K&ouml;nigsmarck in 1681, and was possibly involved with the Rye House plotters (1683). The best that can be said of his behaviour during the exclusion crisis was that he emerged finally on the winning side. Oglethorpe was returned as MP for Morpeth in 1685, probably on the interest of his friend Edward Howard, second earl of Carlisle, who had served as the cornet in Hamilton's <i>gens d'armes</i>. During Monmouth's rebellion in 1685 Oglethorpe commanded fifty troopers from the Life Guards to scout ahead of the earl of Feversham's royal army. Oglethorpe's men successfully charged the rebels at Keynsham, near Bristol, on 25 June 1685 and forced them to retire towards Phillips-Norton. However, during his night march to attack Feversham on Sedgemoor (4&#150;5 July 1685) Monmouth slipped past Oglethorpe's carelessly positioned patrols. Nevertheless, Oglethorpe's men arrived on the battlefield in time to harass Monmouth's defeated army. Two days later he was promoted to full colonel and knighted for bringing news of the victory to James II. Further advancement, to colonel of the Holland regiment of foot (3rd foot, the Buffs), followed on 23 October. He also became a royal equerry, and in 1688 purchased the estate of Westbroke, near Godalming, Surrey. Promoted to brigadier-general on 11 November 1688, he brought news to James II in Salisbury of the military desertions to William of Orange at Warminster. Resisting blandishments to remain in the army, Oglethorpe was deprived of his commissions on 31 December 1688 and retired to Westbroke to dabble in Jacobite intrigue. First arrested and temporarily detained in 1689, a repetition in 1692 caused him to withdraw to France, where he remained until James II was prevailed upon to dismiss all protestants from St Germain-en-Laye. Disillusioned, he sailed to England and took the oaths to William III in 1698. Politically rehabilitated, he was returned as MP for Haslemere at the general elections in 1698 and February 1701. He died on 10 April 1702 and was buried at St James's, Piccadilly.<br>
<br>Oglethorpe and Eleanor had five sons and three daughters. Their eldest son, Lewis (1681&#150;1704), succeeded his father as MP for Haslemere and also became a professional soldier. An equerry to Queen Anne, he was appointed aide-de-camp to Marlborough in April 1704 but was shot in the leg during the assault on the Schellenberg and died shortly afterwards. The second son, Theophilus (<i>bap</i>. 1684, <i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1737), succeeded his brother as MP for Haslemere and became aide-de-camp to the duke of Ormond before retiring to the Jacobite court at St Germain-en-Laye. James, the third son, was born in 1689, while the fourth, Sutton, died aged seven weeks in 1693. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20616/', "General James Edward Oglethorpe (1696&#150;1785)")</script>, founder of the colony of Georgia, was the fifth son. The eldest daughter, Anne (1683&#150;1756), lived at St Germain-en-Laye and, allegedly, was the mistress of James III (James Francis Edward Stuart), the Pretender. Eleanor (1684&#150;1775), the second daughter, was an active Jacobite. The third daughter, Louisa Mary, usually Molly (<i>b</i>. 1693), married the marquis de Bersompierre in 1733 before moving to the court of Spain.<br>
