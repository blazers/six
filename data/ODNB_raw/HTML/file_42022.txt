<span class="headword">Karim,  Abdul</span>  (1862/3&#150;1909), <span class="occ">Queen Victoria's Indian secretary</span>, was the son of an Indian Muslim, Sheikh Mohammed Waziruddin of Agra, India, a hospital assistant at Rs60 a month. Records suggest he had an older brother and four sisters, a wife and one child. Having been employed as a vernacular clerk in Agra gaol (salary Rs10 monthly), in 1887, aged twenty-four, he came as a servant to Queen Victoria's household.<br>
<br>Slim and strikingly good-looking, Abdul Karim, promoted the queen's munshi in 1889, gave Victoria lessons in Hindustani, with &#145;instructive&#146; discussions in Indian religion and culture. Graduating to the position of the queen's Indian secretary, with the title hafiz, in 1894, he assisted with her &#145;boxes&#146;, handling Indian petitions which required &#145;merely a civil refusal&#146;  (Longford, 638). His official residences were at Frogmore Cottage, Windsor, and Arthur Cottage, at Osborne. At the latter, he gave a party every Christmas for the children of the estate. Rewards followed: a grant of land in the suburbs of Agra and permission to attend the durbar. He was painted twice by Rudolf Swoboda (1888 and 1889) and by von Angeli in 1890. Accorded high social position at court, he was made a companion in the Order of the Indian Empire.<br>
<br>Such social elevation caused much controversy and resentment in the royal household, especially among the private secretaries. Abdul Karim was snubbed socially, while the queen was shown an Indian report depicting his low origins. A sensitive man, the munshi was deeply hurt. According to a biographer of Queen Victoria there was a &#145;running battle&#146; between the queen and her advisers  (Longford, 674), with the queen determined to promote &#145;her excellent and much esteemed Munshi and Indian Clerk&#146;, and the court putting him down  (Victoria to Lansdowne, 29 Oct 1890, MS Eur. D/558/1). The court alleged that giving the munshi access to state papers was dangerous, leading to his movements being watched and reports being compiled on him in India. The climax came in 1897: the viceroy was wired for details of his family status and Henry Frederick Ponsonby, the queen's private secretary, requested gossip from &#145;native&#146; and European papers. Finally, the government called a halt. Instead the queen was &#145;plainly&#146; spoken to by some trusted Indian officers in her court, and the munshi put into his &#145;proper place&#146;  (George Hamilton to Lord Elgin, 7 May 1897, Longford, 678).<br>
<br>Like the court at the time, some historians have suggested that Abdul Karim saw &#145;more confidential papers than he should have&#146; and &#145;probably influenced&#146; the queen on Indian &#145;problems&#146;  (Plumb, 281). But, given the fact that, according to the queen, he saw &#145;<i>no</i> political papers&#146; and did not &#145;read English fluently enough to be able to read anything of importance&#146;, it is unlikely he could have influenced policy or posed any danger to the state  (Victoria to Salisbury, 17 July 1897, Longford, 678). The row over the munshi (similar in ways to the earlier rows about the role of John Brown) is more an illustration of race and class prejudice in Victorian England: of the munshi not being kept in what was perceived as his proper place. More significantly, however, his presence may have made Queen Victoria &#145;more sensitive&#146; to race prejudice, as seen from a long letter urging the future viceroy to be &#145;more free&#146; of the &#145;red-tapist narrow-minded Council&#146;  (Plumb, 282).<br>
<br>Following Queen Victoria's death, a bonfire of the munshi's papers was ordered by King Edward at Frogmore. Abdul Karim retired to Agra, where he died in 1909. All his papers were burnt, except for a few letters allowed to his widow as a memento of the queen.<br>
