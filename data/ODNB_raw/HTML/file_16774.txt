<span class="headword">Lithgow,  William</span>  (<em>b. </em>1582, <em>d.</em> in or after 1645), <span class="occ">traveller</span>, was born at Lanark, the eldest of three known children of James Lithgow (<i>d</i>. 1623), a wealthy burgess, and Alison Graham (<i>d</i>. 1603), possibly a relation of the earls of Montrose who were later Lithgow's patrons. He was educated at Lanark grammar school. An unlikely tradition that he was intended to become a tailor seems to derive from the appointment of a tailor, James Lithgow (relationship unknown), as an overseer of his mother's will. The provisions of the will included a bequest of 200 marks to William Lithgow.<h2>
<a name="TheearlytravelsofLuglessWill"></a>The early travels of Lugless Will</h2>Some time before he was twenty-one Lithgow was savagely maltreated by the brothers of a woman with whom he was involved&#151;he described the incident thirty years later as &#145;foure blood-shedding wolves&#146; devouring &#145;one silly stragling lambe&#146;  (Lithgow, <span class="italic">Totall Discourse</span>, 6). Tradition affirms (there is no contemporary evidence) that the family's name was Lockhart and that the brothers cut off or mutilated Lithgow's ears so that he became known as Cutlugged Willie or Lugless Will. He says that the authorities made him submit at the time to &#145;arbitrement, satisfaction and reconciliation&#146;, but that as he grew in years and understood &#145;the unallowable redresses, and the hainousnesse of the offence; I choosed rather &hellip; to seclude my selfe from my soyle &hellip; then to have a quotidian occular inspection&#146;  (ibid., 7). Among the other reasons he gave for embracing a life of difficult travel is that &#145;the science of the world&#146;, which is superior to other branches of knowledge, is &#145;acquisted &hellip; above all, and principally by Travellers, and Voyagers in divers Regions, and remote places, whose experience confirmeth the true Science therof&#146;  (ibid., 301).<br>
<br>While still in &#145;the stripling age of my adolescency&#146;  (Lithgow, <span class="italic">Totall Discourse</span>, 9) Lithgow twice visited Orkney and Shetland, the abundance of which he was later to contrast with the relative barrenness of the Aegean Islands. By the early summer of 1609 he had also toured extensively, doubtless, as later, on foot, in Germany, Bohemia, Switzerland, and the Low Countries. He spent ten months in Paris before setting off, in March 1610, on a forty-day walk to Rome. There he inspected the antiquities, violently disapproved of Roman Catholic rites, and was, he claims, harried by the Inquisition. After encountering the &#145;ignorant devotion&#146; of pilgrims to Loreto  (ibid., 25) he sailed from Ancona to Venice. His companion until Venice was James Arthur, a Scottish gentleman who long remained his friend. Lithgow continued, via Zara and Ragusa, to Corfu and the Greek mainland. &#145;In all this countrey of Greece&#146; he observes:<blockquote>I could find nothing, to answer the famous relations, given by Auncient Authors, of the excellency of that land, but the name onely; the barbarousnesse of Turkes and Time, having defeated all the Monuments of Antiquity: No shew of honour, no habitat of men in an honest fashion &hellip; But rather prisoners shut up in prisons, or addicted slaves to cruell and tyrrannicall Maisters. (ibid., 65)</blockquote>At Khania in Crete, Lithgow says, he rescued a French protestant condemned to the Venetian galleys by getting his keeper drunk and smuggling him away disguised as a woman. After other adventures, including shipwreck on Chios, he saw what was then believed to be the remains of Troy and, surviving a beating by four French &#145;runnagates&#146; on the quayside, landed in Constantinople, where he remained until the early summer of 1611. He stayed for three months with the ambassador, Sir Thomas Glover, and studied Turkish customs, religion, and society.<br>
<br>Among the many other places Lithgow now visited were Smyrna, Rhodes, Cyprus, and Aleppo. In the spring of 1612 he left Aleppo with a caravan of Armenians and Turks, travelling via Damascus to Galilee and eventually, on Palm Sunday, Jerusalem. During the journey marauding Arabs had to be fought off or paid off, an ambush was narrowly avoided, and Lithgow's Turkish conductor had to be palliated continually with money and tobacco. Once in the city Lithgow looked askance at the rites and observances of his Franciscan hosts but was prepared on the whole to take more seriously the sights at the holy sepulchre, where he spent Easter. With a caravan including six German protestants he made the hard desert journey to Cairo in May 1612. Three of the Germans died on the journey and the other three soon after their arrival. Lithgow claims that he inherited from the Germans some 942 sequins (about &pound;400). From Cairo, &#145;Microcosmus of the greater World&#146;  (Lithgow, <span class="italic">Totall Discourse</span>, 274), he saw the pyramids and sphinx before sailing, by way of Malta, to Sicily. There, he claims, he narrowly escaped capture by Moorish slavers, raised the alarm, and, on the slavers' arrest, was feasted and richly rewarded by local people. He accompanied the earl of Bothwell and Captain George Hepburn to Rome, travelled fairly rapidly to the Alps, was saved from murder near Fr&eacute;jus partly by his pilgrim's patent, and went to Montpellier, Barcelona, Pau, Bordeaux, and Paris, where ended &#145;my first, my painefull, and Pedestriall Pilgrimage&#146;  (ibid., 298).<h2>
<a name="Thedelectableandtotalldiscourses"></a>The delectable and totall discourses</h2>Soon afterwards Lithgow returned to Britain. In London he presented to King James a hunting rod which he had cut from a turpentine tree by the River Jordan and to Queen Anne some medicinal white earth from the cave in Bethlehem and a girdle and garters &#145;all richly wrought in silke and gold&#146; and inscribed &#145;Sancto Sepulchro, and the word Jerusalem, &amp;c.&#146;  (Lithgow, <span class="italic">Totall Discourse</span>, 247). He also sought the favour of the earl and countess of Somerset, initially dedicating to him, with verses to her, <span class="italic">A Most Delectable and True Discourse, of an Admired and Painefull Peregrination</span> (1614, reissued 1616). At the Somersets' fall a dedication to &#145;all Noble-minded Gentlemen, and Heroicke Spirits&#146; was substituted.<br>
<br>The 1614 account was much expanded, and supplemented by accounts of the two later &#145;peregrinations&#146;, in the new edition of 1623 (also extensively selected for <span class="italic">Purchas his Pilgrimes &hellip; the Second Part</span>, 1625) and <span class="italic">The totall discourse of the rare adventures and painefull peregrinations of long nineteene yeares travayles</span> (1632). Already in 1614, however, many of the distinctive features of Lithgow's writing were in place: the anti-Catholicism (varied by and on occasion linked to anti-Muslim sentiments); the action-filled narrative (doubtless exaggerated at times; usually there is no way of telling which incidents, if any, are actually invented); the accounts of charges, expenses, thefts, and counter-balancing gifts and rewards; the often colourful &#145;aureate&#146; style and vocabulary.<br>
<br>Lithgow departed for his second round of peregrinations in September 1614 &#145;upon some distaste&#146;  (Lithgow, <span class="italic">Totall Discourse</span>, 298). In the Netherlands he was received equally by the opposing generals Spinola and Prince Maurice. He sailed up the Rhine to Heidelberg and &#145;saluted the Princesse Palatine [Elizabeth of Bohemia] with certayne rare Relickes of the Holy land&#146;  (ibid., 305). At Pistoia he was (allegedly) unjustly arrested and condemned to the galleys by the corrupt Bargello but freed by the governor and given 50 Florentine gold crowns in compensation. But the most famous or infamous (conceivably untrue) incident of the second journey took place in Sicily, where, coming upon the bodies of two noblemen who had killed each other, he stole and concealed their rings and money, alerted the townspeople to the deaths, retrieved the booty, left Sicily for Malta as soon as possible, and later vaunted the deed in print&#151;&#145;there is aye some fortune falleth by accident, whether lawfull or not, I will not question&#146;. From Malta he sailed to Tunis, visiting the Christian renegade John Ward in his magnificent palace. He went with Ward's safe conduct to &#145;the theevish Towne of Algier&#146;  (ibid., 317) and on to Fez, whose free sexual practices he abhorred but whose palaces, mosques, colleges, hospitals, and palatial taverns he admired. After an unsuccessful attempt to strike south through the desert he returned to Sicily. In September 1615, at Syracuse, he arranged the burial of the renegade Sir Francis Verney, whom he had met six weeks earlier in Palermo. The rest of the second journey continued, amid the usual vicissitudes, through Italy to Vienna, Hungary, Moldavia, Cracow, Danzig (where he was for a time seriously ill), Elsinore, Stockholm (where the illness seemed to be returning), and, from Elsinore again, to England.<br>
<br>Before beginning his third expedition Lithgow published his poem &#145;The Pilgrimes Farewell, to his Native Country of Scotland&#146; (1618). This was printed at the author's own expense, but one of its aims was clearly to attract finance for the journey. Among the many dignitaries saluted is John Graham, fourth earl of Montrose, probably already a patron, as apparently was his father, John, third earl (<i>d</i>. 1606). (The epistle dedicatory of Lithgow's religious poem &#145;The Gushing Teares of Godly Sorrow&#146;, 1640, asks the fifth earl to continue the favour extended to him by his father and grandfather.) The motivation of the journey was to see the remaining parts of Europe, including Ireland and much of Spain, and to press further into Africa to the realm of Prester John. Lithgow was in Ireland between August 1619 and February 1620 and reported much ignorance, misery, irreligion, and water. From Youghal he sailed to St Malo and proceeded to Portugal and Spain through France (where the traveller is advised to avoid lodging near &#145;palludiat Ditches, least the vehemency of chirking frogs, vexe the wish'd for Repose of his fatigated body, and cast him in a vigilant perplexity&#146;; Lithgow, <span class="italic">Totall Discourse</span>, 382).<h2>
<a name="TheattackatMalaga"></a>The attack at Malaga</h2>Lithgow's account of what happened to him in Malaga in the autumn of 1620 needs to be treated&#151;like his other encounters with Roman Catholics&#151;with a degree of caution, especially since it was first published in the virulently anti-Spanish context of 1623. He was waiting for a boat bound for Alexandria, he says, when he was seized and secretly imprisoned in the governor's palace. He was suspected of spying for the English ships which had come against the pirates of Algiers and with the crews of which he had been happily fraternizing. Kept in irons, he was taken in late December to be tortured at a vine-pressing house a league from the town. His terrible sufferings included six hours on the rack. When he failed to confess to spying&#151;this is where the details become arguably less convincing&#151;he was charged instead with heresy, tortured again, and told that he would be burnt at the stake unless he recanted within eight days. But at this point a Flemish servant told the English consul about Lithgow's plight. The consul alerted the ambassador in Madrid, who was able to arrange Lithgow's release on Easter Sunday 1621.<br>
<br>When Lithgow landed in England he was taken on a feather bed to Theobalds to show his &#145;martyrd anatomy&#146; to the king and court. Clearly his injuries were severe, whether or not they were inflicted in exactly the way he claims. At James's expense he twice took the cure at Bath and largely recovered his health and strength, although his left arm remained badly damaged, but he found it more difficult to achieve redress from the Spaniards. The ambassador in London, Gondomar, promised compensation in June 1621, but it was not forthcoming. In April 1622 he confronted Gondomar and as a result was committed to the Marshalsea prison for nine weeks. In September the council asked for him to be admitted to the Charterhouse Hospital at the first vacancy, but in February 1623 he was committed again, for unknown reasons, this time to the Gatehouse. In January 1624 his bond in &pound;200 for good behaviour was required. Nevertheless, he continued to pursue his case. He preferred a bill of grievance to the House of Lords in 1626, returning to Scotland only after the dissolution of parliament in 1627.<br>
<br>In 1628 Lithgow visited the marquess of Hamilton on Arran. He spent the winter of 1628&#150;9 in northern Scotland before crossing to Orkney, which he found well governed and notable for &#145;the stately and magnifick Church of St. Magnus built by the Danes&#146; in Kirkwall  (Lithgow, <span class="italic">Totall Discourse</span>, 437), and Shetland, contrastingly badly administered, a victim of recent &#145;deoccular&#146;  (ibid., 438)&#151;absentee&#151;government. (By now, he claims at the end of the <span class="italic">Totall Discourse</span>, he had travelled 36,000 miles.) He says that he &#145;perfected&#146; but had not yet published &#145;Lithgowes Surveigh of Scotland&#146;. It has not survived, but something of its tenor, and perhaps the difficulty in publishing, are indicated in his long poem &#145;Scotland's Welcome to her Native Sonne, and Soveraigne Lord, King Charles&#146; (1633). The king is asked to redress the many ills of Scotland, where trade, agriculture, seaports and defences, learning, law and order, and morality suffer while the nobility and gentry are at court trying out strange fashions and wasting money. They should &#145;spend their rents, where growes their graine&#146;  (<span class="italic">Poetical Remains</span>, B4). Lithgow's anger was perhaps fuelled not only by Scotland's wrongs but by a further spell in the Gatehouse apparently resulting from the outspoken anti-Spanish material in the comprehensive 1632 version of his travels.<h2>
<a name="Lithgowslastjourneys"></a>Lithgow's last journeys</h2>Lithgow's last known foreign journey was to witness the siege of Breda in the summer of 1637. (He had intended originally to sail to Russia.) <span class="italic">A True and Experimentall Discourse &hellip; of the Siege of Breda</span> (1637), pithier than his other writings, was composed as he lay on cold straw amid the clangour of military preparations and draws on personal observation and conversations with officers and men. His remaining works are more polemical in intention but share this &#145;experimentall&#146;&#151;experientially grounded&#151;emphasis. For example, in &#145;A briefe and summarie discourse upon that lamentable and dreadfull disaster at Dunglasse&#146; (1641), Lithgow, investigating the explosion which killed sixty people in August 1640, has:<blockquote>
<div>search'd, and tryde, and seen the place,<br>
</div>
<div>And spoke with some alive.<br>
</div> (<span class="italic">Poetical Remains</span>, A4<i>v</i>)</blockquote>He was in London in 1643, walking &#145;eighteen Kentish miles&#146; around the perimeter of the city to inspect its impressive fortifications and telling anyone who would listen that the Scots will come to their aid now if the citizens will completely give up their &#145;popish observances&#146;  (Lithgow, <span class="italic">Present Surveigh</span>, B4<i>v</i>, C2<i>v</i>). He was at the siege of Newcastle and wrote about it in <span class="italic">An Experimentall Relation upon that Famous Siege of Newcastle</span> (1645).<br>
<br>Nothing more is heard of Lithgow after 1645. According to tradition he died at Lanark and was buried in the churchyard of St Kentigern's. His late works chronicle the rapidly changing political and military situation while retaining something of the exotic style of the <span class="italic">Rare Adventures</span> and much of their anti-Catholicism. He is convinced that in England there is no real dispute between king and parliament&#151;rather &#145;the quarrell dependeth only and absolutely betweene the Papists and Protestants&#146;  (Lithgow, <span class="italic">Present Surveigh</span>, C2<i>v</i>); still at Marston Moor the enemy are &#145;Romish Butchers&#146;  (Lithgow, <span class="italic">Experimentall Relation</span>, 6). It was mostly, however, as the hero of his own travels (prominent in various guises and plights in the accompanying woodcuts) that he continued to appeal to readers. There were editions of his travels in 1640, 1682, 1692, 1770, 1814, and 1906, and a chapbook version published in Glasgow (1816?). Some nineteenth-century readers found his style &#145;inflated and obscure&#146;  (<span class="italic">Poetical Remains</span>, vii), but many later readers have relished its baroque richness and exaggeration.<br>
