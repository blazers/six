<span class="headword">Low,  George Carmichael</span>  (1872&#150;1952), <span class="occ">physician and specialist in tropical diseases</span>, was born on 14 October 1872, the third son of Samuel Millar Low, an engineer, at Monifieth in Forfarshire. He was educated at Madras College, St Andrews, St Andrews University, and Edinburgh University, where he graduated with a first-class MB degree in 1897. His first post was at Edinburgh Royal Infirmary, though he was soon lured by the exciting opportunities opening up in tropical medicine to work with Patrick Manson in London. After fieldwork in the early 1900s Low demonstrated that it was possible to have a successful and prosperous career in tropical medicine in the metropolis, based on teaching, research, consultancy, and a clinical practice serving travellers and returning colonial personnel. However, like most of his contemporaries he spent the early part of his career overseas on a variety of short-term contracts and projects.<br>
<br>Low's first overseas venture at Manson's prompting was to visit Heidelberg and Vienna, where he learned new methods of taking cross-sections of insects for microscopical observation. With this technique Low disproved Manson's notion that filarial parasites were carried in the water supply, finding instead that they were transmitted in mosquito saliva during biting. In 1900 he achieved some public fame when, again at Manson's behest, he was a human guinea-pig, with Louis Sambon and Signor Terzi, in an experiment in the marshes around Rome to show the effectiveness of anti-mosquito measures in preventing malaria. The three men spent the daylight hours in ordinary work, but at nightfall, when the mosquitoes emerged, they retired to huts that were screened with mosquito-proof netting. They maintained their strict regimen throughout the late summer and none caught the disease. This not only confirmed the malaria-mosquito theory but also showed the effectiveness of individual precautions. Low was next sent to the West Indies, as a Cragg's scholar, to investigate filarial parasites. In 1903 he was appointed to the Royal Society's commission sent to Uganda to investigate the epidemic of sleeping sickness. Manson wanted his colleague in the team as he suspected a filarial worm was the cause. The commission was dogged with problems and it was left to a second commission, led by David Bruce, to show that the specific cause was a trypanosome parasite borne by the tsetse fly.<br>
<br>On his return from Uganda, Low accepted the position of superintendent of the London School of Tropical Medicine; he continued to serve there until 1937, apart from a period of four years as pathologist to the West London Hospital. Having begun as pathologist and lecturer he eventually concentrated on clinical work, becoming director of the department of clinical tropical medicine. He also served as physician to the Albert Dock Hospital and as senior physician at the new Hospital for Tropical Diseases that opened after the First World War. During the war Low was an officer in the Indian Medical Service (IMS), treating troops returning home from tropical theatres. He was a founding member of the Royal Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene in 1907 and played a leading role in its affairs throughout his life, especially in securing its long-term solvency. On Manson's death Low assumed a leading role in tropical medicine in London. His main contributions to the literature were in textbooks, most notably his collaboration with Sir Neil Hamilton Fairley on the tropical section of F. W. Price's <span class="italic">Textbook of the Practice of Medicine</span> (1941). Low was awarded the Straits Settlements gold medal by the University of Edinburgh in 1912 and the Mary Kingsley medal in 1929. He was renowned as a methodical observer and recorder, with an encyclopaedic knowledge of tropical diseases.<br>
<br>Low was admired by his colleagues, being noted for his kindliness, dry Scottish humour, and clear teaching style. He was prone to use Spooneresque aphorisms and always greeted people with a friendly &#145;How's yoursel?&#146;. However, he often presented a gruff exterior, being known as a disciplinarian, and was circumspect about taking up new ideas. On 1 December 1906 in Bexhill, Sussex, he married Edith, daughter of Joseph Nash; there were no children. When not at work Low was an enthusiastic ornithologist and showed his organizational skills as secretary and treasurer of the British Ornithological Club. He pioneered bird-watching at the new reservoirs in Staines, Middlesex, and in London became official bird-watcher in Kensington Gardens and published on birds with the Zoological Society. He died at his home at 7 Kent House, Kensington Court, London, on 31 July 1952, and was survived by his wife.<br>
