<span class="headword">Oliver,  Samuel Pasfield</span>  (1838&#150;1907), <span class="occ">geographer and antiquary</span>, born at the rectory, Bovinger, Ongar, on 30 October 1838, was the eldest and only surviving son of William Macjanley Oliver, rector of Bovinger, and his wife, Jane Weldon. He entered Eton College in 1853, and after passing through the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, he received a commission in the Royal Artillery on 1 April 1859. In 1860 he went out to China, where he served at Canton (Guangzhou) before visiting Peking (Beijing) and touring Japan. In the following year he was transferred to Mauritius, and went thence to Madagascar, where he spent some months exploring. The history and ethnology of the island interested him, and he made a close study of them. On his return to Mauritius he studied the flora and fauna of the Mascarene Islands. Oliver married on 10 September 1863 at Port Louis, Mauritius, Clara Georgina Dick (1842&#150;1899), second daughter of the Hon. Frederic Mylius Dick, councillor of Mauritius, with whom he had five sons and four daughters, including the purity activist and Southcottian, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/104881/', "Ellen Frederica Oliver")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/93402/', "Barltrop, Mabel")</script>]. In 1864 the volcanic eruption on the island of R&eacute;union gave him the opportunity of recording some interesting geological phenomena.<br>
<br>Oliver returned to England with his battery in 1865; but his love of adventure led him in 1867 to join Captain Pym's expedition to Central America. A route was cut and levelled across Nicaragua from Monkey Point to Port Realejo; and at a meeting of the British Association at Dundee on 5 September 1867 Oliver argued that this route might be more practicable than the one projected by M. Ferdinand de Lesseps for the Panama Canal. His adventures in Nicaragua were included in his reminiscences, entitled <span class="italic">On and Off Duty</span> (1881).<br>
<br>Oliver now turned to archaeology. From Guernsey, where he was appointed adjutant in 1868, he visited Brittany, and drew up a valuable report on the prehistoric remains at Carnac and other sites (<span class="italic">Proceedings of the Ethnological Society</span>, 1871). His visits in 1872 to archaeological sites in Asia Minor, Greece, and Sardinia were recorded in <span class="italic">Nuragghi Sardi, and other Non-Historic Stone Structures of the Mediterranean</span> (1875). Meanwhile Oliver, who had been promoted captain in 1871, was appointed superintendent of fortifications on the Cornish coast in 1873, and there he wrote the history of two castles, <span class="italic">Pendennis and St Mawes</span> (1875).<br>
<br>After serving on the staff of the intelligence branch of the quartermaster-general's department Oliver was sent to St Helena on garrison duty. There he made a valuable collection of ferns, which he presented to the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew. Impatience of professional routine induced him to resign his commission in 1878. For a time he acted as special artist and correspondent of the <span class="italic">Illustrated London News</span> in Cyprus and Syria, but his health had been seriously affected by his travels in malarial countries, and he soon settled down to write, first at Gosport and later at Worthing. He was elected FRGS in 1866, became fellow of the Ethnological Society in 1869, and FSA in 1874. He died at his home, Bovinger, Byron Road, Worthing, on 31 July 1907, and was buried at Findon.<br>
<br>Oliver's sympathetic volumes about Madagascar long remained important English sources on the subject. His works included <span class="italic">Madagascar and the Malagasy</span> (1866); an ethnological study in French, <span class="italic">Les Hovas et les autres tribus caract&eacute;ristiques de Madagascar</span> (1869); <span class="italic">The True Story of the French Dispute in Madagascar</span> (1885), in which he criticized the treatment of the Malagasy by French colonial officials; and <span class="italic">Madagascar</span> (2 vols., 1886).<br>
<br>Oliver also edited accounts of the travels of Robert Drury (1890), Fran&ccedil;ois Leguat (1891), the Count de Benyowsky (1893), and the Sieur Dubois (1897). In addition he helped to prepare <span class="italic">The Life of Sir Charles MacGregor</span>, published by MacGregor's widow in 1888, and from notes and documents collected by MacGregor he compiled the abridged official account of <span class="italic">The Second Afghan War, 1878&#150;80</span> (1908). His <span class="italic">Life of Philibert Commerson</span>, published posthumously (1909), was edited by G. F. Scott Elliot and prefaced with a memoir of Oliver. To the <span class="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</span> Oliver contributed articles on Fran&ccedil;ois Leguat and Sir Charles MacGregor. Oliver's interests were too varied for him to achieve eminence in any one, but his many works were carefully compiled, often from personal experience, and were valued in his lifetime and beyond.<br>
