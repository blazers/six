<span class="headword">Connor, Sir  William Neil</span>  (1909&#150;1967), <span class="occ">journalist</span>, was born in London on 26 April 1909, a twin son of William Henry Connor, a protestant Ulsterman and Admiralty clerk, and his wife, Isobella Littlejohn, a telegraphist, from Aberdeenshire. Connor went to a primary board school, then to a local private school, and finally to Glendale grammar school in Wood Green. He left at sixteen and attended a crammer in the hope of getting into the navy, only to be rejected because his eyesight was not good enough. He then did one or two clerical jobs which did not appear to be leading him anywhere until he became bookkeeper at Arks Publicity, a small firm which helped to nourish the talent of the actor Alec Guinness and the cartoonist <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/31867/', "Philip Zec")</script>. There Connor found himself writing odd bits of advertising copy and discovered that he had some gift for the pen.<br>
<br>At the age of twenty-three Connor got a job as a copywriter with a leading advertising agency, J. Walter Thompson, where he met Basil Nicholson, inventor of the remarkable concept of &#145;night starvation&#146; and the strip cartoon used to advertise Horlicks, the particular milky beverage which would relieve it. Connor and Zec then collaborated with Nicholson on a general-knowledge strip plagiarizing Ripley's eternal &#145;Believe it or not?&#146; series. All three eventually found their way to employment on the <span class="italic">Daily Mirror</span>.<br>
<br>At that time H. G. Bartholomew had begun to convert the <span class="italic">Mirror</span> from a respectful servants'-hall picture paper to a brash, demagogic tabloid. Hugh Cudlipp, who was also to play a leading part in the revolution, joined the paper on the same day as Connor in August 1935. In 1936 Connor married Gwynfil Mair Morgan; they had two sons and one daughter.<br>
<br>Bartholomew asked Connor to try his hand at a column. When the pen-name Cassandra was suggested, Connor looked it up, and he later wrote:<blockquote>I was a bit surprised to discover that I had changed my sex; was the daughter of the King of Troy; that I could foretell in the stars when the news was going to be bad; &hellip; and that I was going to come to a sticky end by being efficiently murdered by Clytaemnestra. (Connor, 35)</blockquote>The column appeared two or three times a week as and when there was room. Connor soon showed a talent for robust invective and his column became what has been called &#145;the whipping post, stocks and ducking stool for jacks-in-office, muddling magistrates, indiscreet politicians and erring judges&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 7 April 1967). The column varied. It could contain hard-hitting political comment, attacks on government departments and individuals, lavish praise of individuals, and dithyrambic essays on cats or on homely dishes such as cabbage and herring cooked in a particular way. Whatever it was, it was always Connor and it had a tremendous audience.<br>
<br>In Connor's denunciation of the wicked and praise of the virtuous, it was often possible to catch echoes of the Presbyterian pulpit beneath which Connor had regularly sat throughout his youth. About his religion he was publicly ambiguous although he was a deeply spiritual man and regularly read his <span class="roman">Bible</span> and prayer book. Matthew Arnold's &#145;Dover Beach&#146; was never far from his thoughts.<br>
<br>The youthful Connor, a tall, slender young man, was effaced by the later man, who was plump and red-faced, with thinning hair. It was remarked that he belonged to a bohemian race of journalists which had almost disappeared, a generation which read prodigiously, drank heartily, and argued endless hours away at the bar counter. Connor at this period did not suffer fools gladly either in his column or in his personal encounters. He participated in a brief revival in London of a fashion for contrived rudeness as an antidote to the smoothness and alleged effeteness of the establishment. It was all pose. Connor was basically a kindly man, as his colleagues with troubles found out.<br>
<br>Cassandra was an early critic of Nazism and was convinced that Hitler meant war. But when war came he and the <span class="italic">Mirror</span> aroused Churchill's anger. In a letter to Cecil King, already a director of the <span class="italic">Mirror</span>, the prime minister complained of the work of a writer &#145;dominated by malevolence&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 7 April 1967). Cassandra had in fact described a government reshuffle as a game of musical chairs &#145;being played to a funeral march &hellip; Ours&#146;  (ibid.). King replied that Cassandra was not malevolent but was known as &#145;a hard hitting journalist with a vitriolic style&#146;  (ibid.). Throwing vitriol, Churchill observed, was one of the worst of crimes.<br>
<br>Churchill expressed an opinion that the <span class="italic">Mirror</span> papers generally were written in a spirit of hatred and malice against the national government. Then Zec did a cartoon showing a torpedoed sailor, his face blackened with oil, lying on a raft in an empty ocean. The draft caption had been &#145;Petrol is dearer now&#146;. Connor said it could be better dramatized by bringing in the penny rise. The caption as printed on 6 March 1942 was: &#145;&#147;The price of petrol has been increased by one penny&#148;&#151;Official&#146;  (Connor, 61).<br>
<br>This aroused more wrath. The <span class="italic">Mirror</span> argued that the object of the cartoon was to show that petrol cost lives as well as money and should not be wasted. The government's interpretation was that it suggested the sailor's life had been put at risk to raise the profits of the oil companies. There was a serious threat from Herbert Morrison to close the <span class="italic">Mirror</span> down, even an investigation of its ownership. The paper weathered the storm but tempered its criticism.<br>
<br>On 27 March 1942 Connor wrote:<blockquote>This is the last wartime column you will read by Cassandra &hellip; I campaigned for Churchill and my support was early and violent. But since he came to power I have distrusted many of his lieutenants&#151;and I have said so with scant respect for either their position or their feelings &hellip; [The government] are far too glib with the shameful rejoinder that those who do not agree with them are subversive&#151;and even traitors. &hellip; I cannot and will not change my policy.</blockquote>Connor concluded grandiloquently: &#145;I propose to see whether the rifle is a better weapon than the printed word. Mr. Morrison can have my pen&#151;but not my conscience. Mr. Morrison can have my silence&#151;but not my self-respect&#146;  (Connor, 63&#150;5). Connor then joined the army. He spent a good deal of the war with Cudlipp in Italy producing the forces paper <span class="italic">Union Jack</span>, in spirit not unlike a miniature <span class="italic">Daily Mirror</span>.<br>
<br>On his return to the <span class="italic">Mirror</span> in September 1946 Connor's journalism became deeper and more mature. He drove himself hard, travelled widely, went regularly to the United States, and covered in his highly personal style some historic events: the trials of Eichmann, General Salan, and Jack Ruby, who shot J. F. Kennedy's assassin; the enthronement of Pope John; Churchill's funeral; the Korean War. He interviewed, among many others, President Kennedy, Senator McCarthy, Billy Graham, Charlie Chaplin, Adlai Stevenson, Ben-Gurion, Archbishop Makarios, and Marilyn Monroe. Of course the writing had to have more splashes of melodrama and sentiment than the fastidious writer of later years would have wished. But that was the limitation of popular journalism. He only once ran into serious trouble, when he was successfully sued for libel by Liberace in 1959.<br>
<br>In his last years Connor, who had developed diabetes, suffered much ill health. His knighthood in 1966, an inspiration of Harold Wilson, gave him and all his friends great delight; and he enjoyed the irony of its bestowal on a lifelong professional critic of the establishment. He died in London on 6 April 1967, at St Bartholomew's Hospital.<br>
