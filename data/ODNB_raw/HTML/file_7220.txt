<span class="headword">Davidson,  Samuel</span>  (1806?&#150;1898), <span class="occ">biblical scholar</span>, was the son of Abraham Davidson and his wife, Margaret-Measha. He was born at Kellswater, near Ballymena, co. Antrim, Ireland, probably in September 1806, but possibly in the following year. His parents were of Scottish descent and Presbyterians by religion. He attended first the village school and then a school at Ballymena until 1824, when he became a student of the Belfast Academical Institution, with a view to becoming a Presbyterian minister. His college course was distinguished with first prizes in Hebrew and theology, but interrupted by teaching at Londonderry and Liverpool and was therefore not completed until 1832. In November 1833 he was licensed to preach by the Ballymena presbytery, then in 1835 the General Synod of Ulster offered Davidson the newly created chair of biblical criticism at the Belfast Academical Institution.<br>
<br>On 21 September 1836 Davidson married Anne Jane Kirkpatrick of Belfast. They had a daughter and four sons. In 1838 Davidson received from Marischal College, Aberdeen, the degree of LLD. His first book, <span class="italic">Lectures on Biblical Criticism</span> appeared in 1839. He resigned from his professorship in 1841, having moved from the Presbyterian to the Congregationalist viewpoint. He accepted in 1842 the chair of biblical literature, oriental languages, and church history at the newly founded Lancashire Independent college in Manchester.<br>
<br>Before he left Ireland Davidson finished his monumental work <span class="italic">Sacred Hermeneutics Developed and Applied</span> (1843), in which an extensive knowledge of German systems of thought was revealed. In the summer of 1844 he made the first of a series of visits to Germany, beginning many friendships that lasted all his life. His knowledge of German biblical scholarship was unrivalled during this period. Through the recommendation of F. A. G. Tholuck and H. Hupfield he received an honorary DTheol from the University of Halle in 1848.<br>
<br>In 1848 Davidson published the first volume of his <span class="italic">Introduction to the New Testament</span> (the second volume appeared in 1849 and the third in 1851). He also rewrote his first work and republished it in two volumes in 1852 as <span class="italic">A Treatise on Biblical Criticism, Exhibiting a Systematic View of that Subject</span>. In 1855 he published <span class="italic">The Hebrew Text of the Old Testament, Revised from Critical Sources</span>. In 1854 Davidson had agreed to rewrite the volume on the <span class="roman">Old Testament</span> for the tenth edition of T. H. Horne's <span class="italic">An Introduction to the Critical Study and Knowledge of the Holy Scriptures</span> (1856), but only on condition that he could cover &#145;new ground&#146;; that is, &#145;such ground as the subject has been brought to &hellip; especially in other countries&#146;  (<span class="italic">Autobiography</span>, 37). His contribution appeared in October 1856 as part of the second volume of the tenth edition of Horne's <span class="italic">Introduction</span>. It was entitled <span class="italic">The text of the Old Testament considered; with a treatise on sacred interpretation, and a brief introduction to the Old Testament books and the Apocrypha</span>. In the November after its publication, the Lancashire College committee were made aware of dissatisfaction felt in orthodox circles with the religious views expressed in the volume, one letter having been sent to the <span class="italic">Record</span> by Dr S. P. Tregelles, whom Davidson had originally recommended to rewrite the volume on the <span class="roman">New Testament</span>. A committee appointed to examine whether certain views in Davidson's volume were &#145;unsound&#146; reported in February 1857. He was then called upon to justify areas of his work which might have caused offence. Thus Davidson produced in May 1857 his pamphlet <span class="italic">Facts, Statements and Explanations</span>. The committee did not find his explanations satisfactory, and after some correspondence Davidson resigned from his post.<br>
<br>Davidson's request to the committee for specific charges against his orthodoxy was not met, but criticisms tended to focus around his attitude towards the Mosaic authorship of the <span class="roman">Pentateuch</span>, prophetic authorship and inspiration, and his doctrinal views. There was also a charge, to some extent justified, of plagiarism from German authors. These charges were summed up in a pamphlet written by E. Mellor and J. G. Rogers and published in October 1857 as <span class="italic">Dr Davidson: his Heresies, Contradictions, and Plagiarisms. By Two Graduates</span>. In his support appeared <span class="italic">Dr Davidson's removal from the professorship of biblical literature in the Lancashire Independent college, Manchester, on account of alleged error in doctrine</span> (1860) by Thomas Nicholas, which cited Bishop Thirlwall, Dean Alford, and Canon Cureton in Davidson's favour. J. A. Picton's account of the proceedings seemed to Davidson to be the most fair, and he included it in his own <span class="italic">Autobiography</span> of 1899. But he did not offer an account of the story himself, perhaps because he never lost the feeling that he had been treated unjustly. In his later years, from about 1870, he attended services of the Unitarian church, and sometimes the Church of England.<br>
<br>After his resignation many friends gathered round Davidson, and a large testimonial, which finally reached &pound;3000, was presented to him. He retired to Hatherlow, in Cheshire, where he worked as a private tutor. He moved to London in 1862, having been elected scripture examiner in the University of London. His life then was taken up with writing, and visits to the continent; it was also punctuated by domestic bereavements. He and Anne lost three sons before Anne's own death in 1872. After his retirement from Manchester, further publications included <span class="italic">An Introduction to the Old Testament, Critical, Historical, and Theological</span> (3 vols., 1862&#150;3), a work more radical in tone than similar projects published before the controversy, and <span class="italic">An Introduction to the New Testament</span> (2 vols., 1868). His essay <span class="italic">On a Fresh Revision of the English Old Testament</span> (1873) was written for a projected second volume of <span class="italic">Essays and Reviews</span> which never saw the light. Other work included contributions to Kitto's <span class="italic">Cyclopaedia</span> and to the ninth edition of the <span class="italic">Encyclopaedia Britannica</span>. In 1862 he became an occasional contributor to <span class="italic">The Athenaeum</span>, and for three years from 1871 he reviewed philosophical and theological books in the <span class="italic">Westminster Review</span>. He died at his home, 14 Belsize Crescent, Hampstead, on 1 April 1898, and was buried in Hampstead cemetery on 5 April. For his courage in presenting biblical-critical ideas Davidson paid a heavy price in his dismissal. Following a benefaction by his daughter in 1925 he was commemorated by the foundation of the chair of <span class="roman">Old Testament</span> studies at the University of London, which was named after him.<br>
