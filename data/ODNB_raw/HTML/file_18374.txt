<span class="headword">Mauleverer, Sir  Thomas</span>, third baronet  (<em>c.</em>1643&#150;1687), <span class="occ">politician and army officer</span>, was the eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18372/', "Sir Richard Mauleverer (bap. 1623, d. 1675)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18373/', "Mauleverer, Sir Thomas (bap. 1599, d. 1655)")</script>], the second baronet, and his wife, Anne (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1622), daughter of Sir Robert Clarke of Pleshey, Essex. He succeeded his father to the title on the latter's death in July 1675. He first attempted to enter parliament for the seat of Aldborough at a by-election in July 1678, in the court interest, but was unsuccessful. He then represented Boroughbridge, Yorkshire, near his family seat at Allerton, in the parliaments of March and October 1678, 1681, and 1685. He remained in the court interest throughout the exclusion crisis: Shaftesbury marked him as &#145;base&#146; in 1679, and he was listed as one who &#145;abhorred&#146; the campaign of petitioning the king to meet his prorogued parliament in 1680. His support was not particularly active, however, since he may not even have attended the second Exclusion Parliament or the third Exclusion Parliament of 1681.<br>
<br>Mauleverer held a commission as major in a regiment of foot from 1678, probably until his death. As the second to the colonel of his regiment, he ran his opponent through in a duel in November 1678, and three years later he received a cut to the face when he tried to separate two fellow officers in a quarrel. He was a commissioner for the (taxation) assessment for the West Riding from 1673 to 1680, and in the latter year was appointed deputy lieutenant and JP for Yorkshire, positions he held until his death.<br>
<br>In January 1684 Mauleverer and some other Yorkshire gentry tried to show their diligence for the king's service, and at the same time discredit the local potentate Sir John Reresby, by claiming that the latter was protecting the town of York from <i>quo warranto</i> proceedings which would have led to the forfeiture of the town's charter, but the more politically adept Reresby frustrated them by showing that the town was being run very much in the court's interest. On news of the death of Charles II in February 1685 Mauleverer took action to stifle rumours that the king had been poisoned, and during the duke of Monmouth's rebellion four months later he raised an independent troop of horse to help secure the north. James II's Catholicizing policy, however, strained his loyalty. Danby marked him among the parliamentary opposition in 1685, and he resolutely resisted inducements by the king during the latter's &#145;closeting&#146; campaign in 1687; but he died suddenly in that year before the king could punish him by removing him from his offices.<br>
<br>Mauleverer had married Katherine, the daughter and heir of Sir Miles Stapleton of Wighill, Yorkshire, but the marriage was not a success and they had no children, though Mauleverer fathered at least one illegitimate child. He was buried in Westminster Abbey on 13 August 1687, and the baronetcy passed to his younger brother Richard. His widow then married her cousin John Hopton of Ingerskill, Yorkshire, and died, still without children, in 1704.<br>
