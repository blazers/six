<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Pine,  John</span>  (1690&#150;1756), <span class="occ">engraver</span>, who may be the son of Henry and Frances Pine baptized at St Edmund, the King and Martyr, Lombard Street, London, on 29 March 1691, spent the whole of his working life from 1719 in London. Before 1719 he may have studied under, or been apprenticed to, the engraver&#150;printseller Bernard Picart in Amsterdam. As well as engraving book illustrations, plans, and maps, he was a publisher and print- and mapseller, as well as Bluemantle pursuivant at the College of Arms and engraver to the king's signet and stamp office. He was one of the group of independent-minded artists who congregated at Old Slaughter's Coffee House in St Martin's Lane in the 1730s. With Hogarth, George Lambert, and other members of this same social set, he was a petitioner for the <span class="roman">Engraving Copyright Act</span> of 1735, an important piece of legislation which gave the designers and engravers of prints protection of their work for a period of fourteen years from the date of publication. Pine, with Hogarth, became a governor of the Foundling Hospital in 1746 and at the end of his life was involved in the discussions that eventually led to the foundation of a royal academy of art.<br>
<br>One of Pine's earliest known works is a set of engravings after designs by the French engraver and printseller Bernard Picart (1673&#150;1733) illustrating <span class="italic">Jonah: a Poem</span>, published in London in 1720. It is thought Pine learned his trade with Picart, who practised in Amsterdam and was an important supplier of prints to the English market. Pine's enthusiasm for the work of Rembrandt might have derived from Picart, who included copies of Rembrandt prints in his volume <span class="italic">Impostures Innocents</span> (1734). Hogarth's oil portrait of Pine (Beaverbrook Art Gallery, Fredericton, Canada) imitates the style of the self-portraits of Rembrandt, to whom Pine seems to have borne a passing physical resemblance. Hogarth also depicted him as the fat friar in his engraving <span class="italic">The Gate of Calais</span> (1749), which earned him the nickname Friar Pine.<br>
<br>Pine remained closely connected with several French artists throughout his life. In 1739 he published a series of prints of <span class="italic">The Tapestry Hangings of the House of Lords</span>, perhaps inspired by the success of Picart's publication in 1714 of Charles Le Brun's Meleager tapestries. The Lords set of ten huge hangings, designed by Hendrick Vroom (1563&#150;1640) and depicting the defeat of the Spanish armada, hung in the house from 1650 until 1834, when they were destroyed by fire. Pine's prints were engraved after drawings by C. Lempriere and embellished with elegant borders incorporating emblematic figures by Hubert Gravelot, the French artist who had travelled to England in 1732 to assist on an English edition of Picart's <span class="italic">C&eacute;r&eacute;monies et coutumes religieuses de tous les peuples du monde</span> (1733&#150;7). Pine evidently regarded the armada prints as one of the major projects of his career, since he used his influence to ensure that the <span class="roman">Copyright Act</span> of 1735 gave him the exclusive right to copy the tapestries, the insertion of a clause to this effect at the third reading of the bill in April 1735 indicating that the scheme took at least four years from inception to publication.<br>
<br>One of Pine's earlier projects, a series of engravings of the ceremonies marking the installation of the knights of the Order of the Bath in 1725, was printed by Samuel Palmer and John Huggonson in 1730. Using drawings of the participants by Joseph Highmore, Pine included every knight and attendant, each identified by an engraving of his arms, this meticulous record no doubt commending him to the College of Arms and influencing his appointment as Bluemantle pursuivant in 1743. Pine's close attention to detail also enriches his 1733 octavo edition of Horace's <span class="italic">Opera</span>, the imagery being taken from classical seals, paintings, and sculpture. The subscription list printed at the beginning of the book must be one of the most illustrious of its kind, naming the great and the good from every corner of Europe, including the kings of England, Spain, and Portugal. The first volume of a follow-up publication of Virgil's <span class="italic">Bucolica et Georgica</span> appeared in 1753, but the second was published only in 1774, after Pine's death, by his son Robert Edge Pine.<br>
<br>In 1746 Pine collaborated with John Tinney to produce a plan of London on 24 imperial sheets, based on a survey of the capital by John Rocque; he also engraved plans of Bristol (1743) and Nottingham (1751). He appears to have had some link with the city of Bath, and two of his children, the miniaturist Simon Pine (<i>d</i>. 1772) and the portrait painter <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22294/', "Robert Edge Pine")</script>, lived in Bath for parts of their lives; a third son, Horace (1731&#150;1770), was resident in Nacton, Suffolk. Pine also had two daughters, one of whom married the artist Alexander Cozens. His wife, Jane, who was his sole heir and executrix, was probably the sister of the printer Samuel Palmer. Pine died on 4 May 1756 in London.<br>
