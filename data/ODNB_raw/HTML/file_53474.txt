<span class="headword">Ackland,  Rodney</span>  (1908&#150;1991), <span class="occ">playwright</span>, was born Norman Ackland Bernstein on 18 May 1908, at 5 Palmeira Gardens, Southend, Essex, the only son of Nathan Bernstein, a Jewish mantle manufacturer originally from Warsaw, and his wife, Emily Diana Lock (<i>c</i>.1874&#150;1959), a former musical comedy artiste specializing in pantomime boys under the stage name Ada Rodney. Nathan Bernstein made a fortune out of jewellery in the East End of London, and lost it again when his business went bankrupt in 1914. Young Norman and his two sisters grew up under the spell of their mother, who sold stockings from door to door to support the household while attempting to revive her stage career, with enthusiastic support from her small son.<br>
<br>Ackland was, by his own account, educated at the cinema, putting in time at Balham grammar school until he was old enough, at fourteen, to leave and set about becoming an actor himself. He took a day job as a shop boy at Swan and Edgar, and almost immediately embarked on a lifelong affair with the Russian theatre by landing the part of Medvediev in Maksim Gorky's <span class="italic">The Lower Depths</span> at London's tiny, experimental Gate Theatre. In 1926 he saw the first English production of Anton Chekhov's <span class="italic">Three Sisters</span> (with the young John Gielgud as Tusenbach) in Theodore Komisarjevsky's seminal season at Barnes. Ackland always said it turned him into a playwright.<br>
<br>He was nineteen when he wrote his first play, <span class="italic">Improper People</span>, performed at the Arts Theatre in 1929. His acting career (which included stints with J. B. Fagan's Oxford Players and the Masque Theatre in Edinburgh) reached its peak the same year when he starred in a touring production of John van Druten's <span class="italic">Young Woodley</span>. He had his first success as a playwright with <span class="italic">Strange Orchestra</span>, directed in 1931 by Gielgud in the West End. Mrs Patrick Campbell emerged from retirement only to retreat into it again when she realized that the star part was a cheerful, disorderly single mother (Laura Cowie took over the role, with Jean Forbes Robertson and Hugh Williams).<br>
<br>Ackland's raffish early plays had a gaiety and exuberance that distracted attention from their subversive content. But, as his imagination deepened and his technical reach grew bolder, his work increasingly dismayed audiences accustomed to the artificially restricted emotional, social, and intellectual range of drawing-room comedy. Ackland produced his own characteristic variation on the form in <span class="italic">Birthday</span> (1934), which dissects standard middle-class assumptions and behaviour with a sombre ferocity and wit that come closer to John Vanbrugh or William Wycherley than to Ackland's more popular contemporaries, such as Dodie Smith, Terence Rattigan, and No&euml;l Coward.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">After October</span> in 1936 was the nearest Ackland came to a West End hit (&#145;Mr Ackland's theme is gloom,&#146; wrote James Agate, &#145;but I came out dog tired from laughing&#146;  (<span class="italic">Sunday Times</span>, 1936)). It was followed by <span class="italic">The Dark River</span>, a strange, musical, unsettling play, by turns painful and wildly funny, that remains one of the most powerful evocations in any medium of England on the brink of the Second World War. Peggy Ashcroft shone as the heroine but, by the time the play reached the West End in 1941 with air-raid sirens interrupting the first night, the last thing London audiences wanted was a serious attempt to come to grips on stage with a frightening present and a still more uncertain future.<br>
<br>Ackland's professional career spanned the 1930s, 1940s, and early 1950s when, in Kenneth Tynan's memorable phrase, straight plays in the West End seldom strayed far outside &#145;a country house in what used to be called Loamshire but is now, as a heroic tribute to realism, sometimes called Berkshire&#146;  (K. Tynan, <span class="italic">Curtains: a Critic's View of Plays, Players and Theatrical Events, 1950&#150;1960</span>, 1961, 86). Ackland's world is harsher, seedier, invincibly urban, sexually louche, emotionally unstable, and morally far from reassuring. He dealt with precisely the kind of realities the Loamshire play was designed to exclude. After the war, in an age of austerity when audiences craved glamour, frivolity, and escape, Ackland's unheroic view of the period in <span class="italic">The Pink Room</span> (1952), set in a drinking club on the eve of the 1945 general election, was rejected as morally degenerate by reviewers. Their onslaught effectively put a stop to his career as a playwright.<br>
<br>Ackland was the forerunner and should have been the natural ally of the theatrical generation that came to power with the upheavals sparked off by John Osborne's <span class="italic">Look Back in Anger</span> in 1956. But, by a characteristically Acklandesque irony, the new wave of angry young iconoclasts made no distinction between Ackland's work and the stylized sentimentality of the well-made West End play which he had himself long and stubbornly resisted. For most of the second half of his life, his plays remained unperformed and out of print.<br>
<br>Ackland found consolation, to the astonishment of friends who had always known him as frankly and flamboyantly homosexual, in a serenely happy marriage to Mab Lonsdale, herself an accomplished writer, wit, and daughter of the playwright <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/34595/', "Frederick (Freddy) Lonsdale")</script>. Married in 1952, the two were inseparable until her death in 1972. Ackland's life reflected to a startling degree the inconsistencies, reversals, and ambiguities of an imaginative world so powerful that people he met frequently started behaving as shambolically as characters in an Ackland play.<br>
<br>Ackland was championed by independent directors such as Frith Banbury and Tyrone Guthrie. Actors&#151;from Edith Evans, Flora Robson, Peter Ustinov, and Paul Scofield to Judi Dench and Alex Jennings&#151;responded to his work with unfailing relish. His memoirs remained unfinished except for <span class="italic">The Celluloid Mistress</span> (1954), devoted to his largely unrequited passion for the cinema. He left a string of brilliantly theatrical adaptations of other people's work, ranging from Hugh Walpole's <span class="italic">The Old Ladies</span> (1935) to Bulgakov's <span class="italic">The White Guard</span> (1934), Ostrovsky's <span class="italic">Diary of a Scoundrel</span> (1942), and Dostoyevsky's <span class="italic">Crime and Punishment</span> (1946). He came to see himself with a certain gloomy relish as the British theatre's invisible man. &#145;I can't keep from my mind the bitter reflection that, when I was 15, my career started in <span class="italic">The Lower Depths</span>,&#146; he wrote in 1986, &#145;and now, when I'm 78, it's in the lower depths that I'm finishing.&#146; He lived just long enough to see the start of a widespread revival of his reputation, helped in part by his award-winning adaptation of Ostrovsky's <span class="italic">Diary of a Scoundrel</span> as <span class="italic">Too Clever by Half</span> in 1988.<br>
<br>Ackland died of leukaemia at home in Richmond on 6 December 1991, and was cremated at Mortlake later that month. <span class="italic">The Pink Room</span>, revised and retitled <span class="italic">Absolute Hell</span>, made a triumphant return to the National Theatre in 1995. Ackland was Chekhovian in his structural command of rhythm and pattern, in his ability to write orchestrally for a large cast, and in his effect on audiences who saw themselves and their world reflected too clearly for comfort in the mirror of his work. More than any other playwright of his generation, he operated alongside poets such as Auden and MacNeice, and novelists such as Powell, Greene, and Waugh, at the cutting edge of contemporary writing between and just after the two world wars.<br>
