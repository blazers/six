<span class="headword">Baillie,  Charles William</span>  (1844&#150;1899), <span class="occ">inventor of the Baillie sounder and marine meteorologist</span>, was born in Greenwich, Kent, the eldest son of Henry Robert Baillie (1808/9&#150;1882), a master of the nautical school in Greenwich, and his wife, Isabella, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Haselar. He entered the Royal Navy in 1859, being promoted in 1870 to navigating lieutenant and first-class surveyor. He was serving on HMS <i>Sylvia</i> in the China seas when he devised the deep-sea sounder that was to bear his name. There were several types of such sounders employed for hydrography; in ideal conditions a weighted tube was sent down, the weight caused the tube to detach when the device reached the bottom, and the tube, containing a sample of the sea bed, was hauled in, but in practice the operation was often a failure. Baillie sent a model and drawings to the hydrographer of the navy; in June 1873 the first example was made at Chatham Dockyard, and others were then sent out to HMS <i>Challenger</i>, then on her circumnavigation. The Baillie sounder was far sturdier and heavier than its predecessors; it was able to function correctly in the deepest waters encountered by <i>Challenger</i>, and penetrated into soft sediments to capture a long core before slipping the iron weights and being hauled in.<br>
<br>In 1870 plans had been laid to establish a Japanese navy modelled on that of Britain. The following year a number of young Japanese officers went aboard <i>Sylvia</i> to learn about surveying, and in 1873 Baillie took employment at the Imperial Naval College, Hokei, being appointed naval director in 1877. Before leaving Britain he had married Helen Mary Sargent (<i>b</i>. 1848/9), born in Bermuda. Their eldest daughter was born in Brixham, their next three children were born in Japan, and a son was born in Greenwich after their return. Baillie retired from the Royal Navy in 1878 and resigned his college directorship in 1879.<br>
<br>During these years Baillie did not lose sight of his sounder, and in July 1874 he wrote to the hydrographer to ask about its performance. The department responded in August in its usual verbose style, &#145;The sounding machine known by Mr Baillie's name &hellip; has been very successfully used in the &#147;Challenger&#148; and therefore if their Lordships so approve, Mr Baillie's question might be answered in the affirmative&#146;  (TNA: PRO, HO, MB19, p. 72). Thus encouraged, Baillie wrote in October asking for a reward for his invention, which had not been patented. He was awarded 30 guineas, the hydrographer adding,<blockquote>Navigating Lt Baillie's invention is one of the most simple and efficient that has yet been made in connection with disengaging the sinker in deep sea sounding. It is the machine now used in all our surveying ships and throughout a three years' trial in the &#145;Challenger&#146; it has not once been found wanting, and it has been selected by the German and Norwegian governments for deep sea exploration. (ibid., p. 521)</blockquote>Baillie was back in England by July 1879 and was recruited as an assistant in the marine department of the meteorological council, at an annual salary of &pound;200. His first task was to continue and complete the study of sea temperatures and currents of the Pacific Ocean, as reported by ships' captains. In March 1888 he succeeded Henry Toynbee as marine superintendent, with a salary of &pound;350. In February 1892 he was working on charts of the Red Sea and proposing a new method of depicting wind frequency, speed, and direction. He then dealt with similar charts of the Indian Ocean, and by June 1899 was submitting specimen charts of the south Atlantic.<br>
<br>In July 1899 Baillie's son Conyers Baillie wrote to the council to announce his father's sudden death at Albion Street, Broadstairs, on 24 June 1899. He was buried in the Royal Naval cemetery at Greenwich.<br>
