<span class="headword">Iddison,  Roger</span>  (1834&#150;1890), <span class="occ">cricketer</span>, was born at Bedale, in the North Riding of Yorkshire, on 15 September 1834, the eldest of the four children of Roger Iddison (<i>b</i>. 1809) and his wife, Jane, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Jefferson; his father was a ropemaker. Having begun life as a butcher Iddison played cricket for Bedale as early as 1849. He made his first professional appearance for The 14 of Yorkshire against the United All England eleven in 1853. Iddison was an all-rounder; he fielded at point and was originally regarded as a round-arm fast bowler, but later changed his technique to deliver &#145;insidious&#146; lobs. As a batsman he favoured the off drive, and in both 1867 and 1869 he was third in the national batting averages. At the Oval in 1870 he won a silver cup given by a Yorkshire gentleman for the best all-round performance by one of the Yorkshire eleven.<br>
<br>From 1853 until 1876 Iddison played for Yorkshire in seventy-four matches and, from 1863 to 1872, was the county's first captain. Throughout the 1860s he was among the leading batsmen in England and in October 1861, one of only two northerners, he joined the first team to tour Australia, led by H. H. Stephenson. The All England eleven sailed on the <i>SS Great Britain</i> and won six out of their twelve matches, in all of which Iddison played. He took the most wickets in Australia, had the fourth highest batting average, and made twenty-seven catches; in Melbourne he was presented with two commemorative bats. By 1864 he had moved to Manchester, where with his younger brother, William Holdsworth Iddison (1840&#150;1898), a professional cricketer for Lancashire, he set up a sports equipment business in Corporation Street. In the years 1865&#150;70 Roger Iddison also played for Lancashire, in sixteen matches; against Surrey at the Oval in 1866 he became the first batsman to score a century for the county. He featured in the north versus south division in cricket and, with four others of the Yorkshire team, refused to play against Surrey in 1865.<br>
<br>In 1869 Iddison moved to York, where he worked as a commission agent and cattle auctioneer and set up a sports goods shop at 20 Blake Street. In the same year he founded the United North of England eleven and was its first secretary; he was also joint secretary of the short-lived Yorkshire United eleven, founded in 1874 under the patronage of Lord Londesborough, president of the MCC in 1876. In 1872, when the MCC played Yorkshire, Iddison took the wicket of W. G. Grace. Iddison was given a benefit match (29&#150;31 July 1872) at Bramall Lane, Sheffield, against Gloucestershire; this was the first time that Grace played at Sheffield, and he scored 150 not out. The legendary bowler George Freeman came out of retirement for the match, which was watched by some 17,000 spectators, who saw Iddison caught and bowled by Grace for 4 runs. Iddison was cricket coach at various public schools, including Uppingham (1866&#150;72). He made his last professional appearance in 1876, for Yorkshire against Middlesex, but continued to play in local games, such as that at Malton in 1885.<br>
<br>Relatively under-appreciated as a cricketer, Iddison clearly had organizational qualities and was known to be &#145;effusive in his vernacular&#146; style of speech on the field  (West, 44). Like Grace, Iddison had become increasingly portly by the end of his cricket career, allegedly weighing some 17 stone. He died at his family home, 8 Portland Street, York, on 19 March 1890 and was buried three days later in the city cemetery, where his grave still can be found. Large crowds attended his funeral, to which the city butchers sent &#145;a handsome wreath &hellip; in a glass case&#146;  (<span class="italic">Evening Press</span>, 21 March 1890). He was survived by his wife, Elizabeth Webster (<i>b</i>. 1834) of Halifax, whom he had married on 19 January 1857, and by their only child, Elizabeth Jane (1858&#150;1938); his widow later married again.<br>
