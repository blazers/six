<span class="headword">Clyffe,  William</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1558), <span class="occ">civil lawyer</span>, is of unknown parentage. He was educated at Cambridge, where he graduated LLB in 1514 and LLD in 1523. Clyffe had an active legal career. He was admitted as an advocate of Doctors' Commons on 15 December 1522, and was commissary of the diocese of London between 1522 and 1529. He built a reputation as an expert on the law of marriage and divorce, and convocation sought his advice regarding Henry VIII's divorce from Katherine of Aragon in 1533. He continued to take similar cases throughout his career, and was named in several royal commissions and grants to hear and determine divorce cases, such as that between John and Elizabeth Atherton, alongside other notable civil lawyers, such as Henry Harvey, master of Trinity Hall, Cambridge, and Richard Cox.<br>
<br>Clyffe also became the subject of some controversy as well, however. Thomas Cranmer, archbishop of Canterbury, wrote to Sir Thomas Cromwell, principal secretary and vicegerent in spirituals, in October 1533 asking him to summon Clyffe for retaining the registers of the late Nicholas West, bishop of Ely. According to the complaint of Dr William May, Cranmer's vicar-general in the diocese of Ely, Clyffe hindered him from administering justice. In 1533 he was involved in litigation with Thomas Stanceby and Elizabeth Lutton, who claimed that Clyffe had wrongfully interfered with their case before the court of chancery. Clyffe was granted a preferment to the deanery of Chester and was immediately thrown into the Fleet prison at the instance of Sir Richard Cotton, comptroller of the king's household, because he refused to lease chapter lands to him at a rate far below their worth. He was released only after he changed his mind.<br>
<br>Clyffe held several ecclesiastical posts and, in addition, was among the authors of the celebrated treatise on <span class="italic">The Godly and Pious Institution of a Christian Man</span>, commonly known as the <span class="roman">Bishops' Book</span>, and published by the authority of the king in 1537. He was instituted as prebend of Twyford in the diocese of St Paul, London, in 1526; was appointed archdeacon of London three years later; and held the prebend of Fenton in the archdiocese of York in 1532. In 1533 he resigned the archdeaconry of London to take up the post of archdeacon of Cleveland, Yorkshire. He became precentor of York in 1534, treasurer of York in 1538, and in 1547, when that office was suppressed, he was made dean of Chester. He was prebend of Noxton, Middlesex, from 1548. Clyffe died on 13 December 1558.<br>
