<span class="headword">Langley,  Thomas</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1581), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and translator</span>, may have been the son of Thomas Langley, an Augustinian canon of Leeds, Kent, who died before 11 August 1534, in which case the younger Thomas was illegitimate. A student of Jesus College, Cambridge, in 1536/7, Langley graduated BA in 1538. In April 1546 he published an English abridgement of the eight books of Polydore Vergil's encyclopaedic reference book <span class="italic">De inventoribus rerum</span>. Dedicated to Sir Anthony Denny, a courtier sympathetic to the cause of religious reform, the abridgement is no masterpiece, not least because it is some 90 per cent shorter than its original. Langley added a number of comments of his own, which are principally of interest in showing his antipathy towards both Catholics and Anabaptists. In spite of its shortcomings the work proved popular and was reprinted several times in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, the last edition appearing in 1686.<br>
<br>No later than 1548 Langley was a chaplain to Archbishop Thomas Cranmer, in that year instituting articles of heresy against John Assheton, parson of Shiltelington. In 1552 he issued a translation, entitled <span class="italic">Of the Christian Sabboth</span>, of a work by Julius of Milayne (the Italian protestant Giulio da Milano). That year, too, he was instituted to the vicarage of Headcorn, Kent. He had resigned the living before 27 November 1554, having on 28 September been presented to the rectory of Boughton Malherbe, also in Kent, by Thomas Wotton. He held this living until 1564. Wotton, a protestant supporter of Lady Jane Grey who later corresponded with Thomas Cartwright, was imprisoned at the start of Mary's reign, and it is possible that Langley fled abroad&#151;the Thomas Langley admitted to residence at Geneva on 14 October 1557 may have been the translator, though he is registered as &#145;laboureur&#146;. In 1561 it was claimed that he was married to &#145;a woman who was with child in Queen Mary's days and whose husband is thought to be alive&#146;, and that no banns had been called before their marriage  (Willis, 13). All this may well have had to do with the oscillations of religious policy. Langley and his wife, Anne, had at least two sons and two daughters living at the time of their father's death.<br>
<br>If there was uncertainty about the status of Langley's marriage it did not prevent his gaining further preferment. He was presented by Queen Elizabeth to the canonry of the ninth prebend at Winchester on 6 October 1559 and installed nine days later; in that year, too, on presentment of the crown, he was instituted to the rectory of Welford, Berkshire. He took his BTh at Oxford on 15 July 1560. In 1563 he was presented by the dean and chapter of Winchester to the vicarage of Wanborough, Wiltshire, and seems to have acquired fairly extensive properties both in that county and in Kent. By the time he made his will, on 21 December 1581, Langley could only put his seal to the document &#145;becawse I am blynde and cannott subscribe my name&#146;  (TNA: PRO, PROB 11/64, fol. 3<i>v</i>). Naming his old patron Thomas Wotton among the overseers, Langley asked to be buried in the chancel of Wanborough church. A successor was collated to his canonry on the last day of 1581.<br>
