<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Reynolds,  Stephen Sydney</span>  (1881&#150;1919), <span class="occ">writer</span>, was born on 16 May 1881 at 63 New Park Street, Devizes, Wiltshire, the first of the two children of Frank Reynolds (1855&#150;1927), a businessman and farmer, and his first wife, Clara (1858&#150;1891), daughter of George Cox, a butcher, and his wife, Ann. His childhood was troubled: his mother died when he was ten and he was constantly at war with his father. He was educated at Devizes College and All Saints' School, Bloxham, where he became a devout Christian, a promising pianist, and, in his final year, head boy. From 1899 to 1902 he read chemistry at Owens College, Manchester, where incipient tuberculosis hampered his studies and he emerged with a third-class degree.<br>
<br>At Owens he came under the influence of the writer and critic Thomas Seccombe and determined to become a writer himself. In the winter of 1902&#150;3 he went to Paris to study at the &Eacute;cole des Mines and write for the <span class="italic">Weekly Critical Review</span>. But poverty and illness drove him back to England where at Sidmouth in the autumn of 1903 he suffered a major breakdown which nearly killed him. He was nursed back to health by his old schoolmistress, Ada Bennett, at Devizes College. He abandoned Christianity for a mystical pantheism.<br>
<br>In Devizes from 1904 to 1906 he wrote his only novel, <span class="italic">The Holy Mountain</span> (1909), a satirical attack upon the Northcliffe press, revivalism, and the petty politicking of his home town. Edward Garnett thought it &#145;the strongest and most pungent satire&#146; for many years  (Scoble, 177), but as a novel it is marred by the weakness of its characterization. Through Garnett and the Tuesday lunches at the Mont Blanc restaurant in Soho, Reynolds became close friends with Edward Thomas and Joseph Conrad.<br>
<br>In August 1906, on a walking holiday with his Great Dane, Margot, he stopped off for a few days in Sidmouth to stay with Bob Woolley, a fisherman friend he had met there in 1903. Robert William Woolley (1865&#150;1947) had lived since 1900 in the tall brick cottage in Bedford Square where he brought up the eight survivors of his fourteen children. Through Reynolds, his catchphrases, like &#145;you works an' slaves an' worries, an' never gets no for'arder&#146;  (<span class="italic">Seems So!</span>, 186) came to symbolize the frustrations of the Edwardian working class. Reynolds was overwhelmed by the spontaneity and resilience of this large working family as it faced the privations of poverty&#151;what he later called his Sidmouth revelation&#151;and decided to share their lot as both writer and fisherman himself. He lived with them from 1907 until just before his death.<br>
<br>Reynolds wrote a book about this new experience. <span class="italic">A Poor Man's House</span> (1908) is an Orwellian picture of working-class life from the inside, and its almost anthropological detail provides a mine for sociologists and historians. In it Reynolds first outlined his virulent opposition to Fabian social reform, which destroyed the resilience of working people by forcing middle-class values upon them. But it is the acute observation and living portrayals of the Woolleys, interspersed with the narrator's confessional asides, that turned the book into a minor classic. Joseph Conrad called it &#145;a book for which one seems to have waited all the time&#146;  (<span class="italic">Collected Letters</span>, 4.134).<br>
<br>Its publication in October 1908 made Reynolds a national figure overnight. He was to be seen regularly in London, a short, sturdy man, with neatly parted hair and small round glasses, dressed in fisherman's jersey, blue serge trousers, and sea boots. Deeply neurotic, he got on well with those who showed sympathy and understanding, most often outsiders like himself, but attacked injustice and self-importance with a fierce temper, inherited from his father. He was homosexual and never married. In 1915 he met Harry Paynter (1894&#150;1958), a young St Ives fisherman, who remained his partner until his death.<br>
<br>Reynolds's second most successful book, <span class="italic">Seems So!</span> (1911), a collaboration with Bob and Tom Woolley, sought to give a genuine working man's view of the social and political questions of the day. In it he developed in popular form the political themes of <span class="italic">A Poor Man's House</span>: the superiority of working-class culture, its necessary conservatism, the need to protect it from the depredations of social reformers. He celebrated the instinctive libertarianism of working people, and exposed the hurt of bourgeois class prejudice. His attack upon elementary education caused a political uproar. The book built him a reputation as the voice of working-class opinion and in the pre-1914 industrial unrest he interpreted the strikers to the nation. Much influenced by Henri Bergson and the philosophy of intuition, he saw working-class dissatisfaction as a matter of feeling rather than economics.<br>
<br>His literary success was critical, not financial, and his later books had to be written first as newspaper articles. <span class="italic">Alongshore</span> (1910) is a lyrical evocation of life where sea and land meet, and <span class="italic">How 'Twas</span> (1912), a collection of short stories and sketches, though variable in quality, provides a synoptical overview of his writing life. His last work, articles for the <span class="italic">Nation</span> entitled <span class="italic">Wealth and Life</span> (1913&#150;14), developed an intriguing new theory of the philosophy of work which he labelled &#145;psycho-economics&#146;.<br>
<br>The pressures of writing for little financial reward played havoc with Reynolds's nerves, and a further breakdown constantly threatened. Gradually, writing took second place to political support of his fishermen friends. Through his membership of the Harmsworth committee of 1913 and the inshore fisheries committee of 1914 he secured almost single-handed a revolution in longshore fisheries policy: co-operation in marketing, harnessing of motor power, new insurance systems. All of this he personally implemented in the south-west, first as fisheries adviser to the Development Commission and subsequently, after the outbreak of war, as resident fisheries inspector (the idea for which he had developed himself) for the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries.<br>
<br>Worn out by war work and his own relentless drive, he succumbed to the third wave of the influenza pandemic of 1918&#150;19 and, after a six-day illness, died in a nursing home in Seafield Road, Sidmouth, on 14 February 1919. He was buried the following day in Landpart cemetery.<br>
<br>A post-war generation was startled by his <span class="italic">Letters</span> (1923), edited by Harold Wright, which resurrected his unique voice; and the republication by Edward Garnett in 1928 of <span class="italic">A Poor Man's House</span> in the popular <span class="roman">Travellers' Library</span> ensured its survival through the twentieth century. The emotional power of its narrative, together with the stylistic brilliance of <span class="italic">Alongshore</span> and many of his short stories, has secured Reynolds's place in literature.<br>
<br>The growth of social history in the 1960s revived Reynolds's reputation as a social observer. For with <span class="italic">A Poor Man's House</span> and <span class="italic">Seems So!</span> he also takes his place in the English tradition of middle-class observation of working-class life, stretching from Henry Mayhew in the 1850s to George Orwell and Mass-Observation in the 1930s and 1940s. Like Martha Loane and Lady Bell, whose work he admired, he was a cultural investigator rather than a quantifier, though he rejected their emphasis on cultural &#145;improvement&#146; as the solution to working-class problems.<br>
<br>As a social explorer Reynolds is unique. He was not driven by motives of class guilt or the desire for quick journalistic copy, academic reputation, or political solutions. He went to live with the poor because he disliked the cold sterility of middle-class culture, and welcomed the honest warmth of the family that was to give him his first real home. For Reynolds it is not working-class, but middle-class, life that is the problem. Unlike other writers in the tradition, he made his whole life with the poor and wrote from the inside looking out.<br>
<br>Reynolds's fishery reforms were overtaken by the industrialization of fishing and have become a part of history, though such a champion would be welcome to fishermen in any age. His sharp journalistic eye and crystalline prose survive in all his works, but it is his human sympathy, in writing and in life, which is arguably his greatest legacy. As Hilaire Belloc wrote, &#145;He loved the poor: he understood the sea. He was a brother and a support to sailing-men, and he had charity, humility, and justice in equal poise&#146;  (Belloc, 130).<br>
