<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Fairbairn,  Patrick</span>  (1805&#150;1874), <span class="occ">theologian</span>, was born at Hallyburton in the parish of Greenlaw, Berwickshire, on 28 January 1805, the second of five children of John Fairbairn, farmer, and his wife, Jessie Johnston (<i>d</i>. 1861). He was educated locally before entering Edinburgh University in November 1818, although this proved rather too early and Fairbairn did not reveal the extent of his mental powers at this stage. He proceeded to the study of divinity and was licensed by the presbytery of Duns on 3 October 1826. During his time in Edinburgh Fairbairn was greatly influenced by the preaching of Dr Robert Gordon. In 1827 he became tutor in the family of Captain Balfour of Balfour, a large Orkney proprietor. Balfour's influence was no doubt instrumental in Fairbairn's presentation to the parliamentary chapel on North Ronaldsay, the most northerly of the Orkney Islands, where he was ordained on 28 July 1830. Fairbairn was credited with the spiritual transformation of his congregation, whose bad habits were said to include shipwrecking. However, the tiny and remote island also provided a perfect setting for a programme of study in German and Hebrew, which Fairbairn laid down for himself. It was during this period that he translated the first of many works from German.<br>
<br>On 27 March 1833 Fairbairn married Margaret Pitcairn (<i>d</i>. 1837), with whom he had three children. Her death following childbirth was soon followed by that of their infant daughter and one of their sons. By this time Fairbairn had moved to the church extension charge of Bridgeton, in the east end of Glasgow, to which he was translated on 16 March 1837. On 23 July 1839 he married, second, Mary Playfair (<i>d</i>. 1852), with whom he had four children. From Bridgeton Fairbairn was translated and admitted to the pleasant East Lothian parish of Saltoun, whose attractions included a ministerial library endowed by Gilbert Burnet, on 25 June 1840. While he had not taken a prominent role in events leading up to the Disruption in the Church of Scotland, Fairbairn was a staunch supporter of the Free Church of Scotland and took most of his congregation with him into the new denomination.<br>
<br>The appearance of his <span class="italic">Typology of Scripture</span> (1845&#150;7) established Fairbairn's credentials as a scholar. His translation of E. W. Hengstenberg's <span class="italic">Commentary on the Psalms</span> appeared, in three volumes, between 1844 and 1848, and was followed by <span class="italic">Jonah</span> (1849) and <span class="italic">Ezekiel, and the Book of his Prophecy</span> (1851). As the Free Church considered the expansion of its theological training, it became clear that Fairbairn would be at the centre of those plans. In 1852 he was appointed to assist Dr Maclagan at Aberdeen and Fairbairn succeeded to the professorship on Maclagan's death in 1853. In 1854 Glasgow University honoured him with the degree of DD. When the Glasgow theological hall was established in 1856 Fairbairn transferred there as its first professor and, the following year, its first principal. The wisdom of the choice was underlined by the fact that Fairbairn not only had the intellectual weight commensurate with his position, but he was also a very capable administrator.<br>
<br>Following the death of his second wife Fairbairn travelled extensively in the company of John Elliot Wilson. Wilson was with Fairbairn on several continental trips and was in Germany when they had a meeting with Hengstenberg which Fairbairn found rather disappointing. On 21 September 1861 Fairbairn married again; his third wife was Frances (Fanny) Eliza Turnbull (1817/18&#150;1903). They had no children. Fairbairn maintained his published output with <span class="italic">Prophecy</span> (1856) and his <span class="italic">Hermeneutical Manual</span> (1858). A project long in preparation came to fruition under his editorship as the <span class="italic">Imperial Bible Dictionary</span>, to which he contributed many of the articles himself. In 1864 he was made moderator of the general assembly of the Free Church of Scotland and in 1868 he was Cunningham lecturer, his lectures being published as <span class="italic">The Revelation of Law in Scripture</span>. In 1867 he was one of a deputation sent to the United States by the Free Church of Scotland. Fairbairn supported the movement towards union with the United Presbyterian church, and he was a natural choice to serve on the committee to revise the <span class="roman">Old Testament</span>. His last enthusiasm was for the revivalism of Moody and Sankey and it was at an evangelistic convention in Glasgow in April 1874 that he became unwell. A heart condition was diagnosed and while he appeared to make some recovery, he died shortly after retiring to bed on 6 August 1874 at his home, 13 Elmbank Crescent, Glasgow. He was buried in the Grange cemetery, Edinburgh, on 13 August. His third wife survived him.<br>
<br>Fairbairn was a tall man of good humour, majestic presence, and robust constitution who managed to avoid the controversy and personal animosities that often went with the status of Free Church leader. His knowledge of German scholarship might easily have brought him under the suspicion of colleagues, but while his sympathies were liberal, his orthodoxy was never impugned.<br>
