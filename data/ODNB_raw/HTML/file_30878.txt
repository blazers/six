<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Burra,  Edward John</span>  (1905&#150;1976), <span class="occ">painter</span>, was born at 31 Elvaston Place, South Kensington, London, on 29 March 1905 (he had two younger sisters, one of whom died young, in 1929), the son of Henry Curteis Burra of Rye, Sussex, a barrister who also sat as a JP and was at one time chairman of East Sussex county council, and his wife, Ermentrude Ann, daughter of J. S. O. Robertson-Luxford of Salehurst, Sussex.<br>
<br>Burra went to Northaw Place preparatory school, Potters Bar, but had to be withdrawn on account of ill health. He suffered all his life from anaemia. He was at Chelsea Polytechnic school of art 1921&#150;3 and the Royal College of Art 1923&#150;5. In his early paintings of figures in landscapes he used bright colours decoratively in a manner recalling the designs of Leon Bakst and others for the Russian Ballet and also contemporary book illustration.<br>
<br>Burra's sardonic commentaries on the inhabitants of Mediterranean resorts and port cities started in 1925, when he accompanied his mother on a visit to Bordighera on the Italian riviera. He wrote to his friend the dancer <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/54803/', "William Evelyn Chappell (Billy)")</script> in what was to become his typical manner of communicating with his friends in letters that were unpunctuated and often illustrated with sharp observations on styles and manners:<blockquote>we came back from Bawdi in the Blue train which is <i>sposed</i> to be ever so mondaine but all I saw was ancient invalids and a couple with a baby that looked as if it came off Margate Sands there were a few mondaines tho to lighten the gloom &hellip; the native population are too beautiful and wear such exotic garments speshly the men I saw some exotic shirts with Kubismus decorations all over them &hellip; its just like an enormous Berwick St only more so&hellip; (Chappell, <span class="italic">Well Dearie!</span>, 16)</blockquote>From 1926 Burra made regular trips to Paris, visiting nightclubs and music halls as well as the art galleries. As an artist he was occupied in the next few years with the seamier side of life in the sailors' bars and clubs of Marseille and Toulon and the crowded dance floors of Paris clubs. Sitting quietly at the edge of the action, Burra would absorb the goings-on around him. His sharp eye for human eccentricities and an excellent visual memory enabled him to capture, without elaborate sketching, scenes, poses, and styles of dress which he would recreate, subtly satirized, in the studio. Though he was aware of the tradition of French urban realism from Toulouse-Lautrec to Fernand L&eacute;ger, Burra's linearity and obsessive detail mark his Englishness.<br>
<br>In 1931 he met in Rye the American poet Conrad Aiken, who shared Burra's attraction to low-life subjects. Burra's watercolour <span class="italic">John Deth</span> (1931; Whitworth Art Gallery, Manchester University) is based on Aiken's poem of the same title and is a tongue-in-cheek satire, somewhat in the style of the German George Grosz, on gluttony, base sexuality, and corruption. <span class="italic">John Deth</span> typifies Burra's dislike of moral (or any kind of) earnestness and his apparently easy-going acceptance of human weakness. In 1933&#150;4 Burra made the first of at least four visits to America (others were in 1937, 1948, and 1955), spending part of his time in Harlem where he observed African-American life with a mixture of amused curiosity and detachment. Settling at once in Harlem, he described the scene to his photographer friend Barbara-Ker Seymer in October 1933:<blockquote>New York would drive you into a fit. Harlem is like Walham Green gone crazy we do a little shopping on 116th St every morning and there are about 10 Woolworths of all sorts also 40 cinemas &amp; Apollo burlesk featuring Paris in Harlem which I am plotting to go to It must be seen to be believed. Sophie [Fedorovich, dancer and painter, with whom he was travelling] and I go out and have breakfast at different quick lunches we hope to try the Arabian nights luncheonette tomorrow the food is delish 40000000 tons of hot dogs and hamburgers must be consumed in N. Y. daily &hellip; (Chappell, <span class="italic">Well Dearie!</span>, 83)</blockquote>From the beginning Burra worked chiefly in watercolour, but made a number of small oil paintings between 1927 and 1931, and a few collages, reminiscent of the work of the Berlin Dadaists, in 1929&#150;30. Also in the early years he made numerous ink drawings, on large sheets of paper and unrelated to paintings, of people dancing and partying, a practice he later discontinued. His paintings, especially from the mid-thirties, were often unusually large for the watercolour medium, and frequently consist of more than one sheet of paper joined together. Burra liked to work on a flat table-top, drawing the design in lightly in pencil and completing the picture section by section in a manner that recalls the Pre-Raphaelites.<br>
<br>Burra had his first one-man shows at the Leicester Galleries, London, in 1929 and 1932. Encouraged by Paul Nash, a friend and neighbour at Rye, he joined in 1933 the avant-garde <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/96310', "Unit One")</script>, the only artists' group he was ever a member of. In 1936 he showed at the International Surrealist Exhibition in London, and in 1937 in &#145;Fantastic art, Dada, surrealism&#146; at the Museum of Modern Art, New York. Though influenced by a number of painters in the Surrealist circle&#151;Giorgio de Chirico, Max Ernst, and Salvador Dal&iacute;, in particular&#151;Burra was not in the truest sense a Surrealist. The more conservative side of his temperament shared with Percy Wyndham Lewis, whom he admired, a notion of realism founded on rigorous outline drawing which ran counter to the more anarchic aspects of Surrealism.<br>
<br>The Spanish Civil War and the Second World War stimulated important changes in Burra's art: while a strong fantasy element persisted, Burra became less the wry, uncommitted observer, his designs were strong and clear, and his imagination responded to the violence with images of brutish soldiers, weird, hooded skeletons, and predatory monsters in bird-like masks. Burra showed these pictures at the Redfern Gallery in 1942, his first exhibition for a decade. He was beginning to receive more recognition. Five of his paintings entered the Tate Gallery's collection between 1939 and 1942. These include his bizarre, underworld vision <span class="italic">Dancing Skeletons</span>, one of his best-known Harlem scenes (1934) with characteristic exaggerated figures lounging and gossiping on doorsteps, and the massive and baroque <span class="italic">Mexican Church</span> (<i>c</i>.1938), inspired by a visit to Mexico in 1937 with Aiken to see the novelist Malcolm Lowry at Cuernavaca. In 1945 Burra was the subject of a monograph in the <span class="roman">Penguin Modern Painters</span> series with an introduction by John Rothenstein. Later he was fortunate in developing a particularly happy relationship with the Lefevre Gallery where he showed more or less biennially from 1952. The public and critical response to the exhibitions, though generally favourable, was modest and it was not until the retrospective exhibition at the Tate in 1973 that his work began to be widely appreciated. He was made a CBE in 1971.<br>
<br>Latterly Burra turned increasingly to landscape for his subjects, liking especially lonely places such as the west of Ireland, the Yorkshire moors, north Wales, and parts of the Lake District. In immediate appearance his pictures were calmer than before, but he continued none the less to imbue his landscapes, and even arrangements of flowers and other still-life subjects, with a menacing aspect. Parallel with his other work Burra was involved in designing for the theatre. Starting with sets and costumes for Sir Frederick Ashton's production in 1931 of the ballet <span class="italic">Rio Grande</span>, Burra worked between then and the late 1950s on six ballets, an opera, and a musical play.<br>
<br>Except when he was at art school Burra lived in or near Rye all his life. He has been called a recluse, but this is not true. Though a private man and not one for casual acquaintances, he had long-standing and valued friendships, several of them dating from his art school days. The range of his activities was circumscribed by his poor health. He loved travelling and discovering new places, and he read widely, if not systematically, in French and Spanish as well as English literature, including poetry. All his life Burra made regular visits to London to stay with friends, visit the art exhibitions, and, above all, the cinema.<br>
<br>Burra was unmarried. He died in hospital at Hastings on 22 October 1976. There was a posthumous exhibition of his work at the Hayward Gallery in 1985.<br>
