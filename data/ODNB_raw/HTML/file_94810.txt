</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Bullock,  Alan Louis Charles</span>, Baron Bullock  (1914&#150;2004), <span class="occ">historian and college head</span>, was born at 14 Rock Road, Trowbridge, Wiltshire, on 13 December 1914, the only child of Frank Allen Bullock (1887&#150;1964) and his wife, Edith Annie, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Brand (<i>b</i>. 1888). Frank Bullock had left school at the age of thirteen having been schooled in the three Rs (reading, writing and arithmetic) but little else, and then trained as a gardener. He was an insatiable reader and his powerful intellect embraced a wide range of history, philosophy, and religion. The names Louis and Charles given to his son were testimony to his regard for Robert Louis Stevenson and Charles Dickens. He taught himself and, forsaking his family's Baptist allegiance, passed the necessary examinations to become a minister in the Unitarian church and was appointed to Leigh in Lancashire. From there he moved to Bradford, becoming minister at Chapel Lane in 1926, where he remained until his death. He immediately secured a place for his son at Bradford grammar school.<br>
<br>When he joined the school Alan Bullock quickly showed his inheritance of his father's intelligence. In 1933 he won a state scholarship and went to Wadham College, Oxford, to read <i>literae humaniores</i> (Greats). It is scarcely surprising that from this time he was thought to be a Yorkshireman and in appropriate company would lapse into a Yorkshire brogue. His initial reaction to Oxford was so negative that he did not think it was a place where he could stay and he never lost his sympathy with young men and women who, on first joining the university, had the same feeling of being uprooted. Maurice Bowra, as dean, was no help, although later they enjoyed a close and fruitful relationship. He was inspired neither by philosophy nor by his tutor, but the study of history was already in his blood as he worked with H. T. Wade-Gery and the economic historian Reginald Lennard. He took first-class honours in Greats in 1936 and another first, in modern history, in 1938 and was elected to a Bryce research studentship. The next year he won a Harmsworth scholarship at Merton College. However, the Second World War intervened and he abandoned work for a doctorate on sixteenth-century Anglo-French diplomatic relations.<h2>
<a name="WorldwarandcoldwarthemakingofHitler"></a>World war and cold war: the making of Hitler</h2>In 1939 Bullock was recruited by Winston Churchill to join F. W. (Bill) Deakin in undertaking research for the <span class="italic">History of the English Speaking Peoples</span>. Deakin had been elected to a history fellowship at Wadham in 1936 and this was the first of their collaborations. Off his usual track (for his interests were essentially European) Bullock prepared an outline for a 10,000-word study of the English in Australia and New Zealand. War intervened and the project was stillborn. But war was no deterrent in his personal life: on 1 June 1940, in the week of Dunkirk, he married Hilda Yates Handy (1915&#150;2009), a secondary school teacher, daughter of Edwin Handy, stuff merchant and manufacturer. She was always known as Nibby and it was a happy lifelong union, which produced three sons and two daughters.<br>
<br>Suffering from asthma, Bullock was declared unfit for military service and instead joined the European service of the BBC, as &#145;talks&#146; editor. The budding historian thus became a journalist, an experience that was of seminal importance. He contributed to the reputation of the BBC for honest, factually accurate, and reliable reporting. &Eacute;migr&eacute; statesmen from the countries occupied by Germany gravitated towards the BBC and became personal acquaintances. Broadcasting and journalism impose their own discipline which served well when he became a well-known and respected member of the Brains Trust team in the early post-war years. (Recognizing him, a lady on a bus expressed her pleasure: &#145;I like you so much better than all those clever people&#146;.)<br>
<br>In 1945 Bullock was elected to a tutorial fellowship in modern history at New College, Oxford. The static water tank was still in the front quad, food was still rationed, the harsh and long winter straitened the British economy, and Bullock conducted tutorials with snowflakes drifting through the leaded windows. Nevertheless these were halcyon days. Bullock's colleagues in the senior common room included Isaiah Berlin, Herbert Hart, E. H. Phelps Brown, and James Joll&#151;but only one science fellow, Kenneth Staveley, fellow in chemistry. There was an unprecedented (and unrepeatable) camaraderie among men, dons and students alike, who had returned from the war, which made possible a broad interpretation of the stern regulations, unchanged since pre-war days. In this environment Bullock, when appointed dean, discharged his office with unusual creativity.<br>
<br>The external environment was threatening as the cold war intensified. In June 1950 North Korea invaded South Korea, creating a crisis unsurpassed until the Cuban missile crisis of 1962. Believing that, however threatening the environment, it is better to understand than to hide from it, Bullock brought together a group of senior and junior members into an ephemeral Oxford Radical Association. Together they produced a pamphlet entitled <span class="italic">Britain and the Cold War</span> (1952). It described the United States as the best dominant power since Rome and counselled against the rearmament of Germany.<br>
<br>More important for his own future was that Odhams press invited Bullock to write a biography of Adolf Hitler. From this emerged the outstanding <span class="italic">Hitler: a Study in Tyranny</span> (1952). Written by a man who had spent the war broadcasting to Germany and the countries it occupied, and published seven years after that war ended, it was a masterpiece of detached scholarship. The thrust of his historical study was established. He later paid tribute to those who wrote economic and social history&#151;&#145;history from below&#146; that gave historical explanation in terms of impersonal factors such as demography, technology, or industrialization. But in war, revolution, and other violent upheavals it is possible for an individual to exert a powerful and even decisive influence on the way events develop; this was the subject of history as Bullock studied and interpreted it. His biography of Hitler provided the dominant interpretation of the Third Reich and its leader for a generation. Although subsequent historical research has altered the understanding of Hitler's &#145;tyranny&#146;, emphasizing the F&uuml;hrer's abstraction from day-to-day events, his dependence on propaganda rather than physical control of the German people, and the general weakness of the Nazi regime, the book nevertheless encapsulated and shaped the post-war understanding of recent German history and the course of the Second World War.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">Hitler</span> was also a milestone in Bullock's career. Because of the unique circumstance of the availability of documents from the Nuremberg trials it was a work of contemporary history based on primary sources. Bullock's credentials as a historian were thus firmly established&#151;a fact of great importance as he called on other historians to participate in major works of modern and contemporary history that his fertile mind conceived.<h2>
<a name="FoundingStCatherinesCollege"></a>Founding St Catherine's College</h2>As work on the book was finishing Bullock applied for a new post&#151;the headship of St Catherine's Society, Oxford, curiously named &#145;censor&#146;. The society, which had been constituted in 1931, had its origins in the establishment in 1868 of a non-collegiate and non-residential scheme to provide access to the university for poor young men who could not afford the costs of the established colleges. By the mid-twentieth century the society was responsible for as many students as a small college, but the university in 1951 rejected the alternatives of disbanding the society or changing it into a college, and decided to advertise for a successor to the retiring censor, V. J. K. (Victor) Brook. Bullock entered the competition. It was not an obvious career move. But he reasoned that, as a contemporary historian, he would not be appointed to a chair at Oxford. He was restless and perhaps looked for his own show as his father had his own chapel. He was elected on 16 February 1952 and received the news with some trepidation. His appointment dated from the following October. There was at this time no expectation (unless it was in the recesses of Bullock's mind) that the society would be transformed into a college.<br>
<br>The first steps forward were quickly taken. The governing body of St Catherine's Society appointed by the university&#151;the delegates for non-collegiate students&#151;approved an increase in the number of stipendiary tutors (of whom there were at that time only three). They were given office space in newly acquired accommodation; the high table was enhanced, and an entrance examination for undergraduate admission established. But within three years it became clear that the non-residential society would never provide its members with the &#145;parity of esteem&#146; (Bullock's phrase) nor the material and spiritual reassurance of a college. It would never therefore attract the most talented schoolboys, and in any case was an anachronism, given the financial support from government funds automatically available to students. With the encouragement of the vice-chancellor, Bullock therefore submitted proposals to the council of the university for the creation of a new undergraduate college.<br>
<br>The foundation of a new college in the University of Oxford required goodwill, land, buildings, money to build, and an endowment. The fundamentals were favourable. Both industry and the government saw the need to educate more scientists. None the less goodwill was crucial since the project was a university venture, governed by university committees and the university council. It was also indispensable if funds were to be raised. Bullock's personal qualities were therefore of prime importance. He was a skilled diplomatist whose integrity and academic excellence could not be challenged. (Never was there greater self-deprecation than in his phrase &#145;Bullock by name, Bullock by nature&#146;.) He readily presented different aspects of the new proposal to suit his audience, but the core was constant. This was especially true of the importance he attached to the sciences and his proposal to give them parity with the arts in the new college. The facts of the paucity of scientists at Oxford (as he had experienced at New College) were compelling. Bullock had inherited his father's wide-ranging intellectual curiosity, and he gave short shrift to those who thought that science dons would not make &#145;good college men&#146;. His pleasure in walking with his wife had enabled him to identify a possible site, which was purchased from Merton College. Skilled negotiation (and Merton's generosity) made it possible to meet the sale price with the money provided by the University Grants Committee.<br>
<br>The choice of architect was of central importance. It was made, necessarily, by the university, which appointed a committee of four, one of them Bullock. The appointment of Arne Jacobsen ultimately resulted in the construction of one of only four buildings built in the 1960s to be listed grade one by English Heritage. It was also of personal significance for Bullock. He and Jacobsen, of similar age, formed a close bond of friendship and mutual respect. Jacobsen had much experience in negotiating a path through government bodies in Denmark, and understood financial limitations; some ingenuity in his design made it possible to build within the maxima set by the University Grants Committee. But Jacobsen was no more ready to sacrifice architectural quality than Bullock was to lower academic standards. Jacobsen also played a large part in enhancing Bullock's appreciation of design and the visual arts, adding to his already deep sensitivity to music and opera (especially the works of Mozart and Wagner).<br>
<br>Meanwhile Bullock's energies were devoted to the systematic task of attracting funds to build and endow the new college. In this the support of eminent men in industry and banking was indispensable; their support would not have been forthcoming had they not recognized that Bullock's personal qualities justified it. Outstanding in this regard were Sir Alan Wilson and Sir Hugh Beaver. Both were able to urge leaders of industry to support Bullock's efforts and both provided detailed guidance as to who to approach, and how. Their advice was buttressed by that of Sir John Thomson, lord lieutenant of Oxfordshire and chairman of Barclays Bank. But the unremitting hard work, the application to detail, and what was later called &#145;the ask&#146; fell, properly, to the head of the college that was being created. St Catherine's College matriculated its first students in Michaelmas 1962, and all the students of the society became members of the college. The ethos and the identity of the college grew under Bullock's leadership.<br>
<br>Meanwhile Bullock was invited by Odhams to write a new biography&#151;that of Ernest Bevin. As a subject it was not an obvious successor to Hitler but it was one for which he had great sympathy, which only grew with the writing. The first volume, on Bevin as a trade-union leader, was published in 1960, and the second, covering the war years when Bevin was minister of labour, in 1967. The third, <span class="italic">Foreign Secretary, 1945&#150;1951</span>, waited for the opening of the British archives and appeared in 1983.<h2>
<a name="Publiclifecommitteesandpeerage"></a>Public life: committees and peerage</h2>With abundant energy Bullock combined college, university, and public life. In 1969 he became the first vice-chancellor of Oxford University to be elected to the office, full-time, for four years. It was a successful period of reform in university government, but Bullock's ambition to initiate university fund-raising was undermined by student disturbances that soured the political environment. He was chairman of the National Advisory Council on the Training and Supply of Teachers (1963&#150;5) and of the Schools Council (1966&#150;9). He received a knighthood in 1972 and was invited by Margaret Thatcher, the education secretary, to head a committee of inquiry into the teaching of English. The committee's report, <span class="italic">A Language for Life</span>, was published in 1975. It was not followed by legislation but remained a seminal document. In the same year Bullock was invited to head a committee of inquiry into industrial democracy. The differences between the employers and the trade-union members of the committee strained not only his skill as chairman but his robust health. The majority report (1977), which recommended worker (that is trade union) participation on company boards, was still-born and the trio of employers on the committee signed a minority report.<br>
<br>In December 1971 Bullock was elected a trustee of the Aspen Institute and then made a scholar in residence. It gave a new dimension to his life, providing (in the company of his wife) a wide scope for imagination and intellectual exploration. It was appropriate that, with Aspen's president Joe Slater, he should set up Aspen Berlin in 1974.<br>
<br>Bullock had clear, but not ideological, political opinions. He was recruited to <span class="italic">The Observer</span> in 1957, in agreement with its opposition to the Suez expedition. (He remained a member of the Observer Trust until 1969 and was a director from 1977 to 1981.) He was a member of the Labour Party until the party adopted a strong left-wing position, committed to withdrawal from the EEC and unilateral disarmament. He then encouraged the split in the party in 1981 that led to the creation of the Social Democratic Party, of which he was a founder member. He was awarded a life peerage in 1976, becoming Baron Bullock, of Leafield, but was never an active member of the House of Lords.<br>
<br>Much as Bullock enjoyed the exhilaration and the theatre of lecturing (as his father had enjoyed preaching) he was not attracted by political rhetoric. Democracy, he believed, worked in committees, and his consummate skill as a chairman was enhanced by his enjoyment of the task. He was a creative chairman, taking pleasure in drawing out a consensus among committee members and, with his own vision, in pointing a way forward. He was chairman of the research committee of the Royal Institute of International Affairs (1954&#150;78), chairman of the Friends of the Ashmolean Museum, and also of the trustees of the Tate Gallery (1973&#150;80). He was a member of the Arts Council of Great Britain (1961&#150;4), of the Advisory Council on Public Records (1965&#150;77), and the organizing committee of the British Library (1971&#150;2), and was a trustee of the Wolfson Foundation.<h2>
<a name="Laterwritings"></a>Later writings</h2>Bullock was creative, too, as an organizing editor, starting with a four-volume collection, <span class="italic">British Political Tradition</span>, and four slim volumes on English history, written for use in secondary modern schools. He persuaded the university that it should write its own history; the eight volumes of <span class="italic">The History of the University of Oxford</span> were published between 1984 and 2000. Working at first with F. W. Deakin he created the <span class="italic">Oxford History of Europe</span>, showing skill and discernment in the choice of authors. He conceived, and co-wrote, the <span class="italic">Fontana Dictionary of Modern Thought</span> (1977) and its sequel, the <span class="italic">Fontana Biographical Companion to Modern Thought</span> (1983). Whether as editor or author he continued to publish&#151;and he liked pictures. <span class="italic">Term in Oxford</span> with Cas Oorthuys appeared in 1963, <span class="italic">The Twentieth Century</span> was published in 1971, <span class="italic">The Faces of Europe</span> in 1980. He wrote (the idea had been conceived at Aspen) <span class="italic">The Humanist Tradition in the West</span>, published in 1985 with 148 illustrations.<br>
<br>Bullock retired from the mastership of St Catherine's in 1980. Two major works occupied the later part of his life. In 1991 he published <span class="italic">Hitler and Stalin, Parallel Lives</span>, a study of two leaders, each of whom, as Bullock showed, believed himself called on to play a great historic role, had the psychological drive to do so, and so shaped the twentieth century. The authoritative account of Stalin was (for Bullock) a new departure; the portrayal of Hitler gave an importance to ideology, and the holocaust as part of it, which had not been present in <span class="italic">Hitler</span>. In 2000 he published <span class="italic">Building Jerusalem: a Portrait of My Father</span>. It was more than a work of filial piety as he brought to life the mass of lectures and sermons that Frank Bullock had left. It was also a historian's account of a distinctive social environment in which men (and women) met and spontaneously engaged in intellectual discussion and enquiry, Frank Bullock taking the lead in always questioning orthodoxy.<br>
<br>Bullock was elected to a fellowship of the British Academy in 1967 and was made a chevalier of the L&eacute;gion d'honneur in 1970. An honorary fellow of seven Oxford colleges, he was awarded honorary degrees by ten universities. He died at the Guidepost Nursing Home, Roosevelt Drive, Oxford, on 2 February 2004. His funeral service was held at Harris Manchester College, Oxford, and his body was cremated on 11 February at Oxford crematorium. He was survived by his wife and three sons.<br>
