<span class="headword">Starr,  Richard Benjamin</span>  (1813&#150;1892), <span class="occ">building society promoter</span>, was born on 2 March 1813, probably in London, of unknown parents. His early life is also obscure, but he gained wide business experience (including bankruptcy in 1870) in a variety of trades: as hatter, bootmaker, auctioneer, coffee-house keeper, coal merchant, omnibus operator, and hotelier. He was married, and he and his wife, Caroline, had at least one son and a daughter.<br>
<br>Starr was to make his name as a promoter of Starr-Bowkett building societies. Dr T. E. Bowkett was a general practitioner in Poplar, east London, dedicated to improving the condition of the poor. In 1843 he devised a scheme to bring the benefits of owner-occupation to those of modest means. One hundred members subscribed 9&frac12; <i>d</i>. per week. After one year, &pound;200 was available for an interest-free loan, to be allocated by ballot. The loan was repaid at 8<i>s</i>. per week and this, with the continuing subscriptions, enabled a second ballot to be held after forty-six weeks. So the pace accelerated, and after thirty-one years everyone would have had an interest-free loan and subscriptions would cease. Ten years later, with the last loan repaid, subscriptions would be returned to members. Such an interest-free loan was a valuable asset which could be sold (for &pound;40 or more, depending on market conditions) and this attracted a gambling element to these societies, a source of instability. In 1853 Starr became acquainted with Bowkett when he joined the Second Clerkenwell Bowkett Society. By 1857 Starr was assisting Bowkett in forming new societies and two years later Starr was operating independently.<br>
<br>Starr made some changes in Bowkett's scheme, aimed at making the benefits of membership more equal, as between those successful in early ballots and those who waited many years. He copyrighted these new rules and subsequent amendments. For his services in starting new societies Starr charged 10 guineas, and he received a further 33 guineas from the solicitor, surveyor, and secretary when these were appointed. Starr-Bowkett Society no. 14 was formed in 1863, no. 130 in 1868, no. 300 in 1879, and no. 1000 in 1891. Not all societies allocated a number were successfully launched; 800 would be a realistic estimate of the successes. From the late 1870s a number of supporting enterprises were started: the London and Metropolitan Printing Company; the London Trading Bank; the Starr-Bowkett Insurance Company; and a monthly publication, the <span class="italic">Starr-Bowkett Journal and Building Society News</span>.<br>
<br>By 1886 Starr had fifteen paid agents assisting him, but success attracted imitators. Between 1883 and 1891 795 similar societies were formed, mostly by promoters who had been officers in Starr-Bowkett societies. Despite their long prospective life, the Starr-Bowkett societies survived the long depression of the 1880s at least as well as newly formed permanent societies or other sorts of terminating societies. Migrants took the Starr-Bowkett idea to Australia, where it flourished. In Britain the 1894 <span class="roman">Building Societies Act</span> put an end to these promotions, when it outlawed balloting for advances by newly formed societies.<br>
<br>Starr was a man of enormous energy. He estimated that in 1881, in his roles as promoter, adviser, and adjudicator of his rule book, he travelled 40,000 miles, wrote 5000 letters, and spent 121 nights away from his home. He was then sixty-eight years old and, even allowing a considerable margin for exaggeration, such a routine shows both energy and devotion to his work. This pattern continued through the 1880s, despite a serious accident in 1882 that left him lame. He was a total abstainer and non-smoker, habits which he commended to his audiences. He was a formidable public speaker, with a keen memory for dates and detail, as well as being sharp in handling figures. His first response to any criticism was to issue a challenge to a public debate.<br>
<br>In 1890 there was a proposal to float a company to take over Starr's promotional activities, paying him &pound;3000 plus a share in the company. The precise structure of the company is uncertain, but the select committee on building society bills was told in 1893 that it had a capital of &pound;8000. However, by that time Starr was already dead. He died on 22 January 1892 at his home, 17 Baalbeck Road, Highbury, London. He was survived by his wife, to whom he bequeathed an estate of &pound;168.<br>
