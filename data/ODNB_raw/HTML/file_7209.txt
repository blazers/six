<span class="headword">David fitz Gerald</span>  (<em>c.</em>1103<span class="mult">x</span>9&#150;1176), <span class="occ">bishop of St David's</span>, was the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/45551/', "Gerald of Windsor (d. 1116x36)")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/19905/', "Nest (b. before 1092, d. c.1130)")</script>, daughter of the Welsh prince, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/23463/', "Rhys ap Tewdwr (d. 1093)")</script>. His eldest brother, William, was lord of Carew; Maurice, a younger brother, had a small local endowment; his sister, Angharad, married William de Barry of Manorbier. He also had half-brothers who were established in south Wales and, after 1170, Ireland. The distinction of this ambitious group was greatly enhanced by Gerald of Wales (<i>d</i>. 1220&times;23), David's nephew, whose works promoted both the most successful members of his family and himself.<br>
<br>By 1148, David was a canon of St David's and archdeacon of Cardigan. In that year, the canons of St David's were divided over his election as bishop, and two different motives were suggested. One, recorded by Gerald of Wales, was that some wanted a Welshman as bishop, while others opposed such an appointment. The other was that some wished to defend the metropolitan claims of St David's and others accepted Canterbury's primatial authority. Summoned to Lambeth for the election, a group of canons was persuaded by Theobald, archbishop of Canterbury, to elect David as a bishop who would not oppose the archbishop's claims to primacy in Wales. The unusually detailed promise of obedience which he gave Theobald lends credence to this view. The election has been seen as a valuable tactical victory for the archbishop.<br>
<br>Although his connections with the Welsh dynasty and Anglo-Norman settlers made him potentially an important political figure, David rarely exercised political influence. He intervened with Rhys ap Gruffudd in 1167 to secure the release from prison of his half-brother, Robert fitz Stephen. This family matter had wider significance because Robert, at liberty, was obliged to join the Anglo-Norman forces preparing to invade Ireland.<br>
<br>David was essentially a local bishop, appearing rarely on major ecclesiastical occasions affecting the church in Britain. In twenty-six years he assisted at the consecration of a fellow bishop only once, that of Archbishop Thomas Becket. He attended the Council of Tours summoned by Alexander III in 1163. Late in life, prompted by personal interests, he attended the Council of Westminster convened by Richard of Dover, archbishop of Canterbury, in 1175. The council enacted legislation for the Welsh dioceses; the status of St David's was again being discussed by some of his canons; and his chapter had prepared an indictment of his conduct to present to the archbishop. His links with the royal court were likewise minimal. He was at Clarendon early in 1164 to give assent to Henry II's constitutions for the church. When, in September 1171, Henry was preparing to embark for Ireland, he made a brief formal visit to the shrine of St David. To spare the bishop expense, he accepted an invitation to dinner but refused to stay with his retinue at St David's.<br>
<br>David seems to have discharged his episcopal functions, though not with any great distinction. He was greatly hampered by the poverty of his diocese, compounded in turn by the spoliation of the episcopal estates by barons such as Mahel of Hereford. The problem was further exacerbated by the demands of his own family. His brother, Maurice, was promoted to be steward of the diocese and given episcopal estates. Bishop David himself, in flagrant contravention of the church's teaching for the higher clergy, had a family. He used the episcopal lands to endow his daughters, and his son (formally acknowledged as such), Miles, took part in the invasion of Ireland. David died on 8 May 1176, and was buried at St David's.<br>
<br>Gerald of Wales admired David and wrote about him in a number of his works, but was nevertheless commissioned by the archbishop of Canterbury to deal with moral laxity among the diocesan clergy. An account of David's episcopate by an anonymous author, which has in the past been attributed to a canon of St David's and sometimes to Gerald himself, is much sharper in its criticism.<br>
