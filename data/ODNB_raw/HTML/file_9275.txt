<span class="headword">Felton, Sir  Thomas</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1381), <span class="occ">soldier and administrator</span>, was a younger son of Sir John Felton of Litcham, Norfolk, and his wife, Sibyl. His family may have originated in Northumberland, but had been settled in north-west Norfolk since the thirteenth century. Much of Felton's wealth and advancement were secured by lengthy service in south-west France during the 1360s and 1370s, but he retained close links by marriage and connection with men in the household of Edward, the Black Prince, who shared a common background on estates close to the royal lordship of Castle Rising. From his own marriage, before 1356, to Joan, daughter of Sir Richard Walkfare, and those of his daughters, Mary to the elderly Sir Edmund Hemgrave and Sibyl to a son of William, Lord Morley, he acquired additional lands in Ingoldisthorpe, Dersingham, and Great Ryburgh, Norfolk, in Fordham, Cambridgeshire, and in Aslackby, Lincolnshire. Through the patronage of the Black Prince he also received Kirton in Lindsey, Lincolnshire, Haverfordwest in south Wales, and in 1370 the justiciarship of Chester for life. In 1379 he succeeded to the estate of his elder brother, Sir Hamo Felton, who had been a Norfolk member of parliament. Yet the establishment of his own lineage eluded him; a son, Thomas, and his sons-in-law predeceased him, and his widowed daughters became nuns. The demise of his name was among those recorded in the lost east window of the Augustinian friary at Norwich erected by Sir Thomas Erpingham in 1419 to commemorate families in East Anglia that had died out in the male line.<br>
<br>Felton's military and diplomatic career followed a similar curve. He was in the prince's service from at least 1353, by when he had been knighted, was with Audley and Chandos outside Lombez during the prince's first <i>chevauch&eacute;e</i> in 1355, and was a leading knight on the second, which culminated at the battle of Poitiers in 1356. On the army's return to England he was among those few who received annuities of 40 marks. At the creation of the principality of Aquitaine in 1363 he became a prominent member of the prince's administration, acting first as steward of the household, and then as seneschal of Aquitaine at &pound;500 a year, a post which he held, virtually without interruption, until 1377. The Chandos herald calls him one of the prince's companions and closest councillors. In this role he advised on the military intervention in Spain in 1367, and on 3 April fought in the battle of N&aacute;jera, his encouragement of the vanguard noted in the Chandos herald's poem. Froissart, however, places him differently, at the preliminary skirmish at Ari&ntilde;ez during which the Northumberland knight, Sir William Felton, whom the chronicler calls his brother, was killed, and Sir Thomas himself captured, and notes his exchange some time after midsummer at Valladolid for Arnoud d'Audrehem, the marshal of France, who had himself been captured at N&aacute;jera. If Felton had indeed been captured at N&aacute;jera, he was certainly free by mid-July, when he was sent on a diplomatic mission to Pere III, king of Aragon. He was to go back to Aragon in 1371 and 1373, on each occasion in an attempt to negotiate an Anglo-Aragonese alliance against Castile.<br>
<br>But it was after the collapse of the prince's lordship in Aquitaine in 1369, and his later return to England in 1371, that Felton achieved his widest authority, as effective head of the English administration, along with a reputation in English and Gascon chronicles, including the life of Bertrand du Guesclin. From about 1371 one of the select group of military bannerets which had included both Knolles and Calveley, Felton's military and administrative role in France was now confirmed. In 1373 he received envoys from Pope Gregory XI, having captured a number of the latter's kinsmen in the P&eacute;rigord. The defence of Aquitaine was, however, conducted on a minimal budget, and, while Felton now acted in the prince's name to retain more widely among the military community than he had ever done in his own right, he was rarely able to command a force greater than 350 men. The crisis came in 1377. Felton sought to stiffen the wavering loyalties of Gascon lords by securing the trial and execution of Guillaume Sanche de Pommiers, who had been negotiating the delivery of Fronsac to Charles V; on 1 September, while attempting to relieve the siege of Bergerac, he was himself captured at Eymet and his ransom set at 30,000 livres. Although finance was partly arranged by Gaston de Foix (Ph&eacute;bus), count of B&eacute;arn, Felton was still owed money for his service in Gascony, and his wife was forced to enter a parliamentary petition for aid towards his release. He was initially granted money from the ransom of the count of St Pol, and in December 1380 received 20,000 livres tournois from that of Guillaume des Bordes, who had been captured in Cherbourg in 1379.<br>
<br>Having returned to England late in 1380, like other former members of the Black Prince's court Felton looked set to enjoy both favour and prominence, and was immediately contracted to lead the large army that was to relieve Thomas, earl of Buckingham, in Brittany, while in January 1381 he was elected to the Order of the Garter. But the expedition never materialized and Felton died on 26 April, while preparations were still in progress. The management of his memory and the disposal of his estates was taken in hand by his widow, Joan, who established a chantry for four chaplains in the newly built chapel of St Anne at Walsingham in 1385, and provided endowments to support his two surviving daughters, Mary and Sibyl, as nuns at the Minories in Aldgate, London, and at Barking Abbey. Mary, already the survivor of marriage to an older man, was posted as an apostate and vagabond sister in 1385, but Sibyl rose to be abbess at Barking, and in 1397 established a second chantry at the shrine of St &AElig;thelberga there, for the souls of her father and mother.<br>
