<span class="headword">Phillips,  John Arthur</span>  (1822&#150;1887), <span class="occ">mining engineer and metallurgist</span>, was born on 18 February 1822 at Polgooth, near St Austell, Cornwall, the son of John Phillips (1793&#150;1851), mineral agent, and his wife, Prudence Gavid (<i>b</i>. 1795). He was educated at a private school at St Blazey. In the early 1840s he became involved with the Royal Cornwall Polytechnic Society at Falmouth, and in collaboration with Robert Were Fox and Robert Hunt carried out experiments connected with electricity and the deposition of metallic copper.<br>
<br>It may have been through the influence of Fox that, in December 1844, Phillips entered the &Eacute;cole des Mines, Paris, from where he graduated in 1846. He was then employed for about two years at a French colliery, and returned to England in 1848. After serving as chemist to a government commission on the question of coal for the navy, and as manager to some chemical works, he started on his own account as a mining engineer and consulting metallurgist in London. From 1848 to 1850 he was also professor of metallurgy at the College for Civil Engineers, Putney; later in life he lectured at the Royal Naval College, Greenwich, in 1875 and 1877. On 1 January 1850 he married Mary Anne Andrew, daughter of George Andrew, yeoman; she predeceased him.<br>
<br>In 1853 Phillips went to California, where he remained for twelve months. (He subsequently visited California twice more, in 1865 and 1866.) Following his return he again lived in London, but made frequent professional journeys to various parts of Europe and to north Africa. In 1868 Phillips went to Liverpool to build and manage the works of the Widnes Metal Company, which extracted copper, silver, and gold from &#145;burnt&#146; Spanish pyrites. The undertaking proved to be so prosperous that he was able to return to London in 1877, and afterwards to retire from business.<br>
<br>Phillips was elected a fellow of the Geological Society in 1872, serving on its council from 1878 to 1882, and was a vice-president at his death. He was elected FRS in 1881 and was also a fellow of the Chemical Society and a member of the Institution of Civil Engineers. His extensive knowledge was always at the service of his friends, and his judgement and integrity made him a valued member of the learned societies. His scientific papers were numerous, and widely esteemed for their scrupulous accuracy.<br>
<br>Phillips published a number of books on metallurgy and mining, especially on gold mining, including <span class="italic">A Manual of Metallurgy, or, Practical Treatise on the Chemistry of Metals</span> (1852), <span class="italic">The Mining and Metallurgy of Gold and Silver</span> (1867), <span class="italic">Elements of Metallurgy</span> (1874), and <span class="italic">A Treatise on Ore Deposits</span> (1884). He also took out several patents, for improvements in the production and refining of metals. During his visits to California he made a number of observations on the connection between hot springs and mineral vein deposits, which were embodied in an important paper, published by the Geological Society of London. He was one of the first to make use of the new polarizing microscope in the study of the structure of minerals and rocks, preparing thin sections by himself with remarkable skill. Among his more important papers were two on the greenstones of Cornwall and the rocks of the Cornish mining districts, with others on the chemical and mineralogical changes in certain eruptive rocks of north Wales, on the constitution and history of grits and sandstones, and on concretionary patches and fragments of other rocks contained in granite, all published in the <span class="italic">Quarterly Journal of the Geological Society</span>. He also contributed to the <span class="italic">Proceedings of the Royal Society</span>, the <span class="italic">Philosophical Magazine</span>, the <span class="italic">Chemical News</span>, and other scientific journals. He died suddenly on 5 January 1887, at his home, 18 Fopstone Road, Kensington, London, leaving a son and a daughter.<br>
