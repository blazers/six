<span class="headword">Bowie,  James Alexander</span>  (1888&#150;1949), <span class="occ">economist and educationist</span>, was born at 42 Holburn Road, Aberdeen, on 30 November 1888, the fourth son of William Bowie, a foreman mason, and his wife, Jane Lumsden, who also had four daughters. He attended Central School, Aberdeen, as a pupil teacher and passed first in the king's scholarship for teachers in 1908. He subsequently read philosophy and economic science at Aberdeen University, where he won the Hutton prize for the best student in philosophy, and graduated MA in 1914 with double honours and later DLitt. During the war he rose from gunner to the rank of lieutenant in the Royal Artillery, and saw service in Egypt, Palestine, Greece, and Bulgaria. Two of his elder brothers, Albert Campbell and John Lumsden Bowie, were killed in France.<br>
<br>In 1919 Bowie joined the staff of the department of industrial administration, Manchester College of Technology, and became its director in 1926. On 26 July 1922 he married Rosa (<i>b</i>. 1900/01), daughter of William Henry Tatham of Manchester. In 1931 he was invited by the University of Pennsylvania to deliver a series of lectures there, and later that same year was appointed director of the newly created Dundee School of Economics and Commerce. The school owed its origin to the generous donation of George Bonar, a prominent Dundee industrialist, for the purpose of setting up a school of commerce in Dundee either independent of, or as a faculty of, the University of St Andrews. Bowie was director of the school (apart from when it was closed during the Second World War) until his death.<br>
<br>Bowie was well respected, and was appointed director on the recommendation of Josiah Stamp, who delivered the school's inaugural address, which was also attended by William Beveridge. Three works in particular had established Bowie's reputation prior to his appointment. These were <span class="italic">Sharing Profits with Employees</span> (1922), <span class="italic">Education for Business Management</span> (1930), and <span class="italic">Rationalisation</span> (1930). These works addressed the severe economic problems faced by Britain after the First World War, with respect to both labour relations and the industrial structure. Bowie was much concerned with the antagonism between capital and labour, and called for schemes that would result in co-partnership in industry, where labour had equity stake and shared organizational responsibility. His views were radical and progressive, but he was against violent change, much as he recognized the rights of labour for a greater degree of control&#151;there can be little doubt that the experience of the war and its aftermath played a large part in his attitudes. Additional factors that influenced him were the increasing scale of firms and conglomerates, and the divorce of ownership from control, which implied that the traditional <i>laissez-faire</i> doctrine was no longer appropriate as an unquestioned policy guide. Rather, &#145;rationalization&#146; and &#145;planning&#146; were advocated, both in production and marketing, and involvement by the state was desirable to encourage change and to protect the community against exploitation.<br>
<br>The new industrial structure that Bowie envisaged would require a well-trained management profession, and it was hoped that the Dundee school would play its part in such professionalization. This goal was clearly enunciated in Stamp's inaugural lecture, and reflected a not uncommon aspiration of the time. Bowie seemed well suited to the task, but the requirement for university status (as expressed by George Bonar and also in broad accordance with Bowie's own views), together with the insurmountable difficulties of incorporation with St Andrews, rapidly led to the school's offering external London University degrees. The connections with the London School of Economics caused recruitment of lecturers to be much influenced by that institution, and the nature of the London syllabus was such that any distinctive course structure was rapidly subordinated. The school became regarded as a mini London School of Economics in Dundee. As a result, Bowie's involvement with the actual teaching in the school became minimal, and instead he threw himself into public relations on behalf of the school and promulgated his views, via newspaper articles, speeches, and the like, on the need for the encouragement of business education and progressive change in industrial organization and labour relations.<br>
<br>Bowie's belief in the importance of economic planning is emphasized in his last major work, <span class="italic">The Future of Scotland</span> (1939), which specifically addressed problems in regional economics. A Scottish development commission and related state-sponsored institutions, new towns, relocation of industry, rationalization of old industries, and encouragement of new are all trenchantly discussed. Bowie argued for greater Scottish autonomy, but fell short of recommending a separate Scottish parliament in the &#145;near future&#146; though he did not rule it out for the longer term. These policy goals were reiterated after the war in more popular venues.<br>
<br>Bowie died on 1 September 1949 in Dundee, and was cremated in the city; he was survived by his widow and their daughter and son. With his death support for the school dwindled, and in 1955 it was finally absorbed by Queen's College of St Andrews in Dundee. Though his educational goals did not flourish in Dundee's unfavourable environment, many of them came to fruition in the late twentieth century. On a general level business management courses are now commonplace and the regions are obtaining greater power, and at a specific level road bridges have been built across the Forth and Tay estuaries, as Bowie recommended.<br>
