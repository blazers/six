<span class="headword">Fergusson, Sir  William</span>, first baronet  (1808&#150;1877), <span class="occ">surgeon</span>, was born at Prestonpans on 20 March 1808, one of the five children of James Fergusson (1766&#150;1834) and his wife, Elizabeth (1766/7&#150;1818), daughter of Andrew Hodge, of Anstruther, Fife. He was educated first at Prestonpans School and afterwards at Edinburgh, at the high school and then at the medical school. At the age of fifteen and against his father's wishes he took a position in a lawyer's office, but at seventeen he exchanged law for medicine. He became a pupil of Robert Knox, the anatomist, who appointed Fergusson at the age of twenty as demonstrator to his class of four hundred pupils. In 1828 Fergusson became a licentiate, and in 1829 a fellow, of the Edinburgh College of Surgeons. He continued to study anatomy, often spending from twelve to sixteen hours a day in the dissecting room. Two of his preparations were for many years preserved in the museum of the Edinburgh College of Surgeons. Soon after qualifying Fergusson began to deliver lectures on general anatomy with Knox, and to demonstrate surgical anatomy. In 1831 he was elected surgeon to the Edinburgh Royal Dispensary. In the same year he tied the subclavian artery for an aneurysm, which had then been done in Scotland only twice. On 10 October 1833 he married Helen Hamilton (<i>d</i>. 1861), daughter and heir of William Ranken of Spittlehaugh, Peeblesshire; they had two sons and three daughters. This marriage made him financially comfortable, but he did not relinquish operative surgery, and by 1836, when he was elected surgeon to the Royal Infirmary and fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, he shared with James Syme the best surgical practice in Scotland.<br>
<br>In 1840 Fergusson accepted the professorship of surgery at King's College, London, with the surgeoncy to King's College Hospital, and he established himself at Dover Street, Piccadilly; he moved to George Street, Hanover Square, in 1847. He became MRCS in 1840 and FRCS in 1844. Fergusson's <span class="italic">System of Practical Surgery</span> was published in 1842 and reached a fifth edition in 1870. He continued to publish papers on surgical operations and cases throughout his career. Fergusson's practice grew rapidly, and the fame of his operative skill brought many students and visitors to King's College Hospital. In 1849 he was appointed surgeon-in-ordinary to the prince consort, and in 1855 surgeon-extraordinary, as well as in 1867 sergeant-surgeon, to the queen.<br>
<br>For many years Fergusson was the leading operator in London. He was elected to the council of the Royal College of Surgeons in 1861, became examiner in 1867, and was president of the college in 1870. As professor of human anatomy and surgery he delivered two courses of lectures before the Royal College of Surgeons in 1864 and 1865 which were later published. He was president of the Pathological Society in 1859&#150;60, and of the British Medical Association in 1873. In 1875 he received the honorary degree of LLD from Edinburgh University. He resigned the professorship of surgery at King's College in 1870, but until his death he was clinical professor of surgery and senior surgeon to King's College Hospital. He became a fellow of the Royal Society in 1848. He was created a baronet on 23 January 1866, an honour which led to his receiving a presentation from three hundred old pupils of a silver dessert service worth &pound;400. Fergusson died at his home, 16 George Street, Hanover Square, London, from Bright's disease, on 10 February 1877, and was buried with his wife at West Linton, Peeblesshire. He was succeeded by his son, Sir James Ranken Fergusson.<br>
<br>Fergusson's reputation was that of a brilliant operator and a great &#145;conservative&#146; surgeon, a term first applied by Fergusson in 1852 to operations for the preservation of parts of the body which would otherwise have been sacrificed. Other operators, for example James Syme, had already been very successful in this line of procedure. But Fergusson extended the principle from the operation of excision of the elbow joint&#151;no portion of the body which could be usefully preserved was too small for him to make efforts to save. His name is especially identified with operations for harelip and cleft palate, operations on the jaws, the excision of joints&#151;notably the hip, knee, and elbow&#151;lithotomy and lithotrity, and amputations of limbs. In his lectures at the Royal College of Surgeons he was able to speak of having performed 300 successful operations of his own for harelip. He revived the neglected operation for cleft palate. His manipulative and mechanical skill was evidenced by the new instruments he devised: the bulldog forceps, the mouth gag for cleft palate, and various bent knives. Fergusson planned every detail of an operation beforehand; no emergency was unprovided for. He operated at remarkable speed and in silence, himself applying every bandage and plaster, and leaving, as far as possible, no traces of his operation. So silently were most of his operations conducted that he was often imagined to be on bad terms with his assistants. His punctuality and his hatred of unnecessary waste of time were very marked.<br>
<br>Although Fergusson was not esteemed as a lecturer, his remarks on cases in the operating theatre were regarded as valuable and instructive. He was said to be kind and generous to his students. Fergusson met much opposition, especially from Syme, but apparently he did not imitate his opponent's pugnacious manner. Fergusson also did not endear himself to some other sections of the profession. His presidential address to the BMA in 1873 upset sanitary reformers. His evidence at a trial in Norwich in 1874, and before the royal commission on animal experimentation which reported in 1876, was sympathetic to the anti-vivisectionist movement. He also showed sympathy for homoeopathy.<br>
<br>Fergusson was an excellent carpenter, a good violinist, and an expert fly-fisher. He was also very fond of drama. He was renowned for his endurance and scarcely had a day's illness until attacked by Bright's disease. Tall, dignified, and with a genial expression, fond of a joke, and very hospitable, Fergusson financially assisted large numbers of clergymen, actors, authors, and governesses. He helped many of his pupils in starting their careers and a large number of them later attained eminence as surgeons. It was said he never forgot the face of a pupil.<br>
