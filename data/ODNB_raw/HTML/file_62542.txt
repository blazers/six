<span class="headword">Taylor,  David</span>  (1715&#150;1783), <span class="occ">evangelist and preacher</span>, was born on 28 April 1715 in Wymeswold, near Loughborough, the son of Joseph Taylor and his wife, Dorothy. He is said to have had a &#145;tolerable education&#146;  (Seymour, 1.43) and was employed in domestic service with Lady Huntingdon's family, though in the 1750s he was described as a husbandman. It is often stated that he was converted by Benjamin Ingham or the Moravians in 1741 and that in the same year Lady Huntingdon encouraged him to preach in Leicestershire. There is, however, some evidence that he was at least &#145;awakened&#146; as early as 1735, and was preaching and founding societies in the Sheffield area before 1740. Here he probably encountered Ingham and the Moravians, and certainly John Bennet and John Nelson, who later became Methodist preachers.<br>
<br>Taylor's preaching in Leicestershire for Lady Huntingdon from early 1741 led to the development of religious societies which, however, developed Baptist principles. In 1770 they joined with Dan Taylor's societies to form the General Baptists of the New Connexion. In October 1741 David Taylor was invited by John Bennet to visit Derbyshire, where he influenced some members of the Chinley Presbyterian Chapel and precipitated Bennet's evangelical conversion in January 1742. In 1743 Taylor settled in Mobberley, Cheshire, and preached chiefly in that county, Derbyshire, and Lancashire. Some of his religious societies in these areas were later taken over by the Moravians, others by John Bennet, and through Bennet became part of John Wesley's Methodist Connexion.<br>
<br>In 1742 Wesley and Lady Huntingdon were already alarmed at Taylor's apparent intention to create an independent organization. His reputation was also damaged by contracting an irregular marriage. He apparently disapproved of the Anglican clergy and Anglican marriage and instead made vows with his partner, Mary (1717&#150;1770), before witnesses after the Quaker manner. He also offended some by his alleged antinomianism. The exact status of his marriage remains unclear. Moravian sources record that he was married in Wrexham in 1745, but also that his first son, David, was born on 13 January 1744, though his baptism is recorded in the Mobberley parish register on 2 January 1743 (<span class="smallcap">NS</span>?). The couple had nine other children (five sons and four daughters), two dying in infancy. Those born before 1751 were baptized as Anglicans, the rest as Moravians. The eldest son, David, later became a Moravian worker in Jamaica.<br>
<br>Continuing an irregular preacher, Taylor had contacts with the Moravians and Methodists during the rest of the 1740s. In 1747 Bennet said he had left off preaching, but in 1749 he supported Bennet and John Wesley against the mob in Bolton, Lancashire. The parish register of Mobberley in 1749&#150;50 described Taylor as a Methodist &#145;teacher&#146; (that is, a preacher). However, on 11 January 1751 he was received as a member of the Moravian church, though recorded as a &#145;backsliding member&#146; by 1755. His letters between 1750 and 1760 suggest that he was in a state of spiritual confusion, with his temporal affairs often in disorder, though he still wanted to preach and perhaps become a Moravian minister. He and his wife were finally expelled by the Moravians on 15 April 1765 for assisting a clandestine marriage. His wife died in 1770 and in 1772 in Manchester, Taylor attempted to convince a Moravian woman that he was guided by God to marry her. In his last years he seems to have vacillated in allegiance between the Moravians, Methodists, and Quakers, and to have lost his preaching gift.<br>
<br>In appearance Taylor is described as of moderate height, rather stoutly made, grey-headed in later life, and in one place called &#145;the little beauty&#146;  (Tyerman MSS, 3, fol. 500). His career illustrates certain features of the early years of the evangelical revival. Like other local and regional evangelists he pioneered work later taken over by more systematic organizers. His irregularities and changeable allegiances were not due simply to personal weaknesses, but were characteristic of the doctrinal and moral uncertainties created by the experience of revival. Taylor died in Jackson's Row, Manchester, on 8 July 1783 and was buried in the town's Quaker burial-ground.<br>
