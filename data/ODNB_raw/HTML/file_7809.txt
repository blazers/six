<span class="headword">Donellan <span class="st"> [Daniel]</span>,  Nehemiah</span>  (<em>b. </em><em>c.</em>1565, <em>d.</em> in or after 1609), <span class="occ">Church of Ireland archbishop of Tuam</span>, was born in co. Galway and is said to have been the son of Melaghlin Donellan and his wife, Cecily, daughter of William Kelly of Calla, co. Mayo. The O'Donellans were a bardic family who originated in the south-eastern part of co. Galway. The Irish version of his name was Fearganainm &Oacute; Domhnall&aacute;in, where Fearganainm literally means &#145;man without a name&#146;.<br>
<br>Nehemiah was sent to Cambridge and became a sizar of King's College in January 1580. He transferred to St Catharine's College and graduated BA in 1581&#150;2. He returned to Ireland and spent some time in Kilkenny in the diocese of Ossory. He was still in Kilkenny in 1591. In that year an observer, probably Sir Turlough O'Brien, wrote that there were only three protestant clerics in the province capable of preaching in Irish apart from &#145;Nehemias o Donnellane a man of Connaught now resident in the diocese of Kilcaney&#146;.<br>
<br>Thereafter Donellan became coadjutor to William Laly (Uilliam &Oacute; Maolala), Church of Ireland archbishop of Tuam. When Laly died in 1595 Thomas Butler, earl of Ormond, recommended Donellan to the see and he was appointed in August of that year. Donellan was described at the time as &#145;a very honest man and recommended by many&#146;. As was customary Donellan held other benefices along with his see, namely the rectory of Kilmore and the vicarage of Castledoagh, both in Ossory, and the vicarage of Donard in the diocese of Dublin.<br>
<br>In the writ of privy seal directing his appointment Donellan is praised as being &#145;very fit to communicate with the people in their mother tongue, and a very meet instrument to retain and instruct them in duty and religion&#146;. It was also said that he had &#145;taken great pains in translating and putting to the press the Communion-Book and <span class="roman">New Testament</span> in the Irish language, which her Majesty greatly approved of&#146;. There is no evidence that any part of the Church of Ireland liturgy had been translated by Donellan, but <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7121/', "William Daniel")</script> mentions Donellan as one of those who assisted in the translation into Irish of the <span class="roman">New Testament</span>. Indeed, when Donellan was elevated to the see of Tuam, part of the <span class="roman">New Testament</span> was actually being typeset. The whole book was published in the years 1602&#150;3 and the dedication and preface are said to have been the work of Donellan.<br>
<br>Donellan married Elizabeth, daughter of Nicolas Daniel and sister of William, whom he met in all probability when he was resident in Kilkenny. They had five sons: John, James, Edmund of Killucan in Westmeath, Murtagh, and Teigue of Ballyheague in co. Kildare. James was subsequently knighted and became lord chief justice of the common pleas. Murtagh was ordained priest in the Roman Catholic church.<br>
<br>Nehemiah Donellan voluntarily resigned his see in 1609 and died shortly afterwards in Tuam. He was buried in the cathedral. He was succeeded as archbishop by his brother-in-law William Daniel.<br>
