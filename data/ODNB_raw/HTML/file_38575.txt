<span class="headword">Hall,  Marie Pauline</span>  (1884&#150;1956), <span class="occ">violinist</span>, was born on 8 April 1884 at 15 Victoria Street, Newcastle upon Tyne, the daughter of Edward Felix Handley Hall and his wife, Helen Parsons. She was born into a musical family. Her father was a harpist in the Carl Rosa Opera Orchestra and hoped that she would learn that instrument. He first taught her but she wanted to learn the violin, so from an early age had lessons from a local teacher, Hildegarde Werner, and soon became a very good player. Together with her father, her uncle and brother (violins), and sister (harp) she played in the homes of music lovers in her home town, Malvern, and also in Bristol. &Eacute;mile Sauret heard her play when she was aged nine, but her parents did not follow up his advice to send her to the Royal Academy of Music in London. She continued her studies locally, and over the next few years was under various well-known teachers.<br>
<br>Elgar had heard her and gave her some lessons at Malvern in the summer of 1894, and he sent her to A. E. D. F. Wilhelmj in London where she studied under him for three months in 1896, and in 1898 she studied under Max Mossel at the Midland Institute in Birmingham. In 1899 she won a scholarship to the Royal Academy of Music against forty competitors but the poor financial state of her family prevented her from taking it up. However, the music scholar Edmund Fellowes was a great help to her: he took some friends to hear her play at a concert which had been arranged at All Saints Hall and they were so impressed that they began a campaign to raise funds to enable her to receive a good training. In 1900 Johann Kruse gave her free lessons in London. Also she was helped by the wealthy English music patron and amateur composer P. Napier Miles. Then in 1901 she played for Jan Kubel&iacute;k and he advised her to study under his old teacher Otakar &#352;ev&#269;&iacute;k at the Prague Conservatory. She went there in September. &#352;ev&#269;&iacute;k thought her very talented and she made excellent progress. Her professional d&eacute;but was made at a concert in Prague in 1902 and was an immediate success, as was her performance in Vienna in January 1903. Her studies under &#352;ev&#269;&iacute;k ended in 1903 and she began touring with great success.<br>
<br>Edmund Fellowes, when comparing Hall with other violinists in his memoirs, cited tributes from <span class="italic">The Times</span> and other papers. One reviewer commented that<blockquote>Miss Hall is the only female violinist who has essayed the Paganini Concerto in D in public. This she played with a technical skill so consummate that it seemed as if it were just as easy to play octaves on the violin as on the piano. (Fellowes, 80)</blockquote>According to another, &#145;If Kubel&iacute;k has not been actually out-Kubel&iacute;ked, he must look to it on pain of being outshone by Miss Marie Hall as a virtuoso, while her musical temperament and equipment are far more sympathetic and responsive than his&#146;  (ibid.). It was observed that &#145;Her technique is flawless, but besides this she has at her command a fund of real musical feeling which she exhibited in Beethoven's <span class="roman">Kreutzer</span> Sonata and especially in Bach's Chaconne&#146;  (ibid.). In 1903 she played the Tchaikovsky violin concerto and Wieniawski's &#145;Faust&#146; fantasia under Henry Wood with the Queen's Hall Orchestra: a critic observed that &#145;This wonderful girl gave a performance of Wieniawski's &#145;Faust&#146; Fantasia that was notable for brilliant execution, fire, and decision. She was recalled nine times after this exploit amid a scene of enthusiasm rarely witnessed in a concert-room&#146;  (ibid.). There was a remarkable occasion on 22 January 1904 at St James's Hall when she performed the Mendelssohn, Beethoven, and Tchaikovsky violin concertos in succession with the Queen's Hall Orchestra under Henry Wood. Marie Hall toured all over the world with enormous success, and made her d&eacute;but in America on 8 November 1905 with the New York Symphony Orchestra under Walter Damrosch. She was in Australia in 1907 and India in 1913. She appeared with the Queen's Hall Orchestra again on 1 January 1909, when she performed the Tchaikovsky concerto.<br>
<br>On 27 January 1911 Marie Hall married her manager, Edward Baring. They settled in Cheltenham and had a daughter. After her marriage, although she cut down on her appearances, she also introduced new violin works, including <span class="italic">The Lark Ascending</span> by Vaughan Williams (composed for and dedicated to her in 1914), which she premi&egrave;red in London on 14 June 1921 with the British Symphony Orchestra under Adrian Boult. Other new music she performed was by Rutland Boughton, Gordon Bryan, and Percy Sherwood. Her appearances continued until 1955 with her daughter, Pauline, as accompanist. She played on a 1709 Stradivarius which was named after her.<br>
<br>Regarded as one of the finest violinists of her time, Marie Hall had a beautiful tone and fine musicianship. Sir Henry Wood wrote that &#145;In my mind's eye I can still see that frail, delicate girl coming on to the platform and can hear her faultless intonation and pure technique&#146;  (Wood, 204). She made many recordings on the HMV and Gramophone and Typewriter labels. These included a shortened version of the Elgar violin concerto in 1916, N. Paganini's <span class="italic">Moto perpetuo</span>, J. J. Raff's <span class="italic">Cavatina</span>, Sarasate's <span class="italic">Jota aragonesa</span>, op. 27, and C. Sinding's romance no. 1, op. 79. She died on 11 November 1956 at the General Hospital, Cheltenham.<br>
