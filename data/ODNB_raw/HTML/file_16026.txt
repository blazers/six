<span class="headword">Langley,  Thomas</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1430), <span class="occ">Benedictine monk and prosodist</span>, was probably born in the last years of the fourteenth century. Nothing is known of his education or career, and even his association with the abbey of St Benet of Hulme, Norfolk, is uncertain. According to John Bale and later bibliographers Langley was a poet and metrist, the author of a series of epigrams and a treatise <span class="italic">De varietate carminum</span>, which survives anonymously in a single early fifteenth-century manuscript  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Digby 100, fols. 178<i>r</i>&#150;189<i>v</i>). A note added in a later hand indicates that the text was dedicated to a bishop of Norwich, which would seem to support the attribution. Tanner added that the bishop's name was John, although his evidence for this is obscure. Given the date of the manuscript, a likely dedicatee in this case would have been John Wakering, bishop of Norwich from 1415 to 1425.<br>
<br>Langley's treatise considers the whole nature of poetry. He examines scansion, rhythm, and metrical forms, and he defends his study of what was considered a pagan practice by demonstrating that it could also be found in the work of many Christian writers. His text is very similar in form and content to another fifteenth-century treatise on metre, the <span class="italic">Metristencheridion</span>, written by John Seward, a London grammar-master. Like Langley, Seward discusses variations in metrical form using examples from Horace, and in particular Boethius's <span class="italic">De consolatione philosophiae</span>. Seward wrote a generation earlier than Langley&#151;the earliest version of the <span class="italic">Metristencheridion</span> was completed in 1415; it is very likely that Langley acquired a copy and used it as the basis for his own work.<br>
<br>The Seward connection may explain the putative dedication of the <span class="italic">De varietate</span> to a bishop of Norwich. The <span class="italic">Metristencheridion</span> in its earliest form was itself dedicated to Richard Courtenay, bishop of Norwich, who died in 1415; it is possible the annotator of the Digby manuscript confused the two texts when adding his note, especially given their obvious similarity. In the same way the bibliographers may also have confused Langley with Seward when they suggested that he was the author of epigrams. Seward was the author of several sets of epigrams, including one sequence dedicated to JW, who may be identified with John Wakering. This in turn perhaps explains Tanner's suggestion that Langley's patron had been a Bishop John. Alternatively the alleged epigrams may be traced to a misreading of the opening lines of Langley's prologue to the <span class="italic">De varietate</span>, or of the later rubric which identifies the prologue as &#145;Epigramma in primum librum de varietate carminum&#146;.<br>
