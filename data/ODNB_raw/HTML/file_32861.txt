<span class="headword">Donnelly, Sir  John Fretcheville Dykes</span>  (1834&#150;1902), <span class="occ">army officer and promoter of scientific education</span>, born in the Bay of Bombay on 2 July 1834, was the only child of Lieutenant-Colonel Thomas Donnelly (1802&#150;1881), deputy adjutant-general of the Bombay army, and from 1851 staff captain and afterwards staff officer at the East India Company's military college at Addiscombe until it closed in 1861. His mother was Jane Christiana, second daughter of Joseph Ballantine Dykes of Dovenby Hall, Cumberland. Educated at Highgate School (1843&#150;8), he had a year's private tuition before entering the Royal Military Academy at Woolwich at the head of the list in August 1849. He passed out first, and was commissioned second lieutenant in the Royal Engineers on 23 June 1853, and promoted first lieutenant on 17 February 1854.<br>
<br>Donnelly went out to the Crimea in June, joining his corps on its march to Balaklava on 23 September, and the next month was detailed for duty with the left attack on Sevastopol. He was present at the battle of Inkerman on 5 November, and subsequently worked energetically in the trenches before Sevastopol. Through the severe winter of 1854&#150;5 he was much in the trenches. On the day after the abortive assault on the Redan (18 June), when he was with the second column, he obtained a substantial lodgement in the Russian rifle pits at the Little Mamelon. He was mentioned in dispatches soon after the fall of Sevastopol in September 1855. In November 1855 he was appointed aide-de-camp to Colonel E. T. Lloyd, the commanding royal engineer in the Crimea, and returned home in June 1856. He received the L&eacute;gion d'honneur (fifth class); he had been recommended for the Victoria Cross, but without result.<br>
<br>Donnelly joined the London military district in 1856, and commanded a detachment preparing for building purposes the ground purchased at South Kensington out of the surplus funds of the Great Exhibition of 1851. It was intended to erect there a permanent museum and centre of science and art. Sir Henry Cole, the director of the scheme, secured on 1 April 1858 Donnelly's services in reorganizing at South Kensington the Department of Science and Art, which was controlled by the privy council's committee of education. On 1 October 1859 he was appointed inspector for science under the department. He had been promoted second captain on 1 April 1859, but did not return to regimental duty; the rest of his career was identified with South Kensington, and in 1872 he was placed on the reserve list. His promotion continued, as he was still liable for emergency service, and he became lieutenant-colonel on 1 October 1877 and brevet colonel on 1 October 1881, retiring with the honorary rank of major-general on 31 December 1887.<br>
<br>The success of the scheme for national instruction in science and art was largely due to Donnelly, although some of his methods were controversial. He arranged (by minute of 1859) that grants should be made to certificated teachers on the results of the examinations of their pupils. He obtained recognition for drawing and manual training as class subjects, and having induced the Society of Arts, which he joined in 1860, to form a class in wood-carving, he procured from City companies and other sources funds to carry it on as the School of Art Wood-Carving.<br>
<br>In 1874 Donnelly's title at South Kensington became director of science, and his duties included the supervision not only of the science schools and classes throughout the country but of such scientific institutions as the Government School of Mines, the Museum of Practical Geology, the Royal College of Chemistry, the Edinburgh Museum of Science and Art, and the Museum of Irish Industry, which developed into the Royal College of Science for Ireland. In 1868, as a member of a commission appointed to consider the question, he had drafted a report adverse to the establishment of a separate Department of Science and Art for Ireland. In 1881 he was appointed in addition assistant secretary of the Department of Science and Art, and in 1884 secretary and permanent head of the department.<br>
<br>Joining the council of the Society of Arts in 1870, Donnelly was mainly responsible in 1871 for the society's scheme of technical examinations, out of which by his advice the City Guilds Institute for technical education was developed. As chairman of the council of the Society of Arts in 1894 and 1895, he led the society to organize the International Congress on Technical Education in 1897.<br>
<br>For many years the museums of science and art at Kensington had been in unsatisfactory temporary accommodation, and Donnelly was untiring in his efforts to secure parliamentary grants for permanent buildings. In 1896 the House of Commons appointed a select committee, on whose report in 1899 a sum of &pound;800,000 was voted to complete the museums. Donnelly's administration was criticized by the committee in its <span class="italic">Report and Evidence &hellip; on the Museums of the Science and Art Department</span> (1899). Whatever the quality of the educational policy, the number of science students had grown immensely under Donnelly's direction. Responding to the committee's report, he retired on 2 July 1899. A minute of the privy council dated the following day stated its full confidence in Colonel Donnelly and his staff, and Sir John Gorst, vice-president of the committee of council on education, publicly defended Donnelly.<br>
<br>Donnelly was made CB in 1886 and KCB (civil) in 1893. A competent artist, from 1888 to 1901 he exhibited at the Royal Academy and the New Gallery.<br>
<br>Donnelly was twice married. His first marriage, at Bridekirk, Cumberland, on 5 January 1871, was to his first cousin Adeliza (<i>d</i>. 1873), second daughter of Fretcheville Lawson Ballantine Dykes of Dovenby Hall, Cumberland; they had two daughters. On 17 December 1881 he married at Neuch&acirc;tel, Switzerland (the marriage would have been illegal in England), his deceased wife's elder sister, Mary Frances Dykes. They had two sons, Thomas and Gordon Harvey (both became Royal Garrison Artillery officers), and a daughter. Donnelly died on 5 April 1902 at his residence, 59 Onslow Gardens, London, survived by his wife. He was buried at Brompton cemetery.<br>
