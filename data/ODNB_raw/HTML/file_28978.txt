<span class="headword">Welby,  Henry</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1636), <span class="occ">recluse</span>, was the eldest son of Adlard Welby (<i>c</i>.1506&#150;1570), gentleman, of Gedney, Lincolnshire, and his first wife, Ellen Hall of Hull. Henry's age at death was given on his monument and in a memorial biography as eighty-four. This is inconsistent with the information that he matriculated as a pensioner of St John's College, Cambridge, on 24 May 1558, and was a student of the Inner Temple in November 1562. He was probably born in the 1540s.<br>
<br>Welby bought the country estate of Goxhill in Lincolnshire from Lord Wentworth and, wishing to enlarge his mind, spent some years travelling in the Low Countries, Germany, France, and Italy. He was married to Alice White, daughter of Thomas White of Yorkshire and Nottinghamshire and his wife, Anne <i>n&eacute;e</i> Cecil, sister of William Cecil, Lord Burghley. They had one daughter, Elizabeth, who was to be his sole heir.<br>
<br>Welby continued his life of gentlemanly ease until 1592, when his younger half-brother John, angered by Henry's efforts to reform his dissolute habits, attempted to shoot him with a pistol. Profoundly shocked, Henry went into total seclusion for the rest of his life. He took a house on Grub Street, near Cripplegate in London. He lived abstemiously there for forty-four years, reading and praying, eating gruel porridge or salad, and drinking only small beer.<br>
<br>Welby was generous to his neighbours, especially at Christmas, and to any pauper he noticed passing below. The parish of St Giles Cripplegate in which he lived was experiencing rapid growth in population, in economic activity, especially in the tailoring and carrying trades, and in poverty. Welby had cousins and other family members in London. His daughter married Sir Christopher Hildyard of Winestead, Yorkshire, in the church of St Giles Cripplegate on 13 July 1598. She was buried at Routh, East Riding of Yorkshire, on 28 November 1638; the Hildyard family of Flintham Hall, Newark, Nottinghamshire, descended from her.<br>
<br>Henry Welby was buried in St Giles Cripplegate on 20 October 1636, only nine days after his long-faithful servant, Elizabeth Villier. Welby's life was eccentric and he achieved some notoriety in his lifetime, and lasting attention from the biography of 1637, <span class="italic">The Phoenix of these Late Times, or, The Life of Mr Henry Welby Esq.</span>&#151;&#145;He died living that he might live dying&#146;. Some details are incorrect (including his exact date of death), but the quarto volume rehearsed the main features of its subject's life and contained a sequence of commemorative verses by, among others, Shackerley Marmion, John Taylor the Water Poet, Thomas Nabbes, and Thomas Heywood, who gave the funeral elegy. The frontispiece portrait shows Welby in old age, when he was described as being like a wild hermit, his hair being so overgrown. Two further editions appeared the same year, and a century later in 1741 a new edition was published under the title <span class="italic">The City-Hermit</span>.<br>
