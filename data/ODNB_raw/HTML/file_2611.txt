<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Bland <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Romanzini]</span>,  Maria Theresa</span>  (1769&#150;1838), <span class="occ">singer</span>, was born of Italian-Jewish parents named Romanzini, who settled in London soon after her birth. In the spring of 1773 she was engaged at Hughes's Riding School, performing as Romanzini. She sang in the children's company at the opening of the Royal Circus on 7 November 1782, where she was also taught by the director, Charles Dibdin; she was then engaged by Richard Daly for the Theatre Royal, Dublin, where she sang with great success. In 1782 she went to Drury Lane to take the small parts known as &#145;singing chambermaids&#146;. She performed at Sadler's Wells in 1786, and her first operatic appearance at Drury Lane was on 24 October that year, when she played the boy Antonio in an English version of Gr&eacute;try's <span class="italic">Richard Coeur-de-Lion</span> adapted by Thomas Linley. In 1789 she sang in Liverpool with such success, both on the stage and in concerts, that she refused to return to Drury Lane unless her salary was raised. The management rejected her request, but she returned after a few weeks.<br>
<br>On 21 October 1790 Romanzini married George Bland, brother of Dorothea Jordan of Drury Lane and a minor actor. The marriage did not last, and Bland left her to go to America; she later had several illegitimate children. Although she also sang at the Haymarket from 1791 and at Vauxhall Gardens, she remained with the Drury Lane company for nearly forty years. Here she sang secondary roles in nearly all Storace's operas: Michael Kelly took Haydn and Pleyel to <span class="italic">The Cherokee</span> in 1794 and wrote of &#145;the great simplicity and truth&#146; of her singing of &#145;A little bird sat on a spray&#146;. Its success led to the belief that it was a genuine Welsh folk-song, and a setting for George Thomson's collection by Beethoven.<br>
<br>Mrs Bland's voice was a mezzo-soprano of very sweet quality, and, though her powers were limited, as a singer of English ballads she was free from any blemish of style or taste. In person she was short and dark, but her acting was very bright and vivacious. A deteriorating mental condition aggravated by the death of a child led to a breakdown after her last stage appearance in June 1822. A benefit at Drury Lane and a public subscription raised about &pound;800; the money was passed to Lord Egremont, who allowed her an annuity of &pound;80. She lived for the rest of her life with a family named Western, and died from apoplexy at their house, 11 Broadway, Westminster, on 15 January 1838. She was buried at St Margaret's, Westminster, on 25 January.<br>
<br>Her son <a name="cosubject_52373"></a><span class="headword">James Bland</span>  (1798&#150;1861)<span class="occ"></span> sang as a bass from 1826 at the Lyceum (English Opera House) and then at Drury Lane, and from 1831 at the Olympic Theatre in burlesque and extravaganzas. His success in these led to his performing kings and fathers in pantomimes by Planch&eacute; and others. He died at the Strand Theatre on 17 July 1861. Another son, <a name="cosubject_52374"></a><span class="headword">Charles Bland</span>  (<em>b. </em>1802, <em>d.</em> in or after 1834)<span class="occ"></span>, was a tenor who first appeared in 1824 as Don Carlos in Thomas Linley's <span class="italic">The Duenna</span>. He created the title role in Weber's <span class="italic">Oberon</span> under the composer at Covent Garden on 12 April 1826. Planch&eacute;, the opera's librettist, thought him &#145;happily gifted with a voice which enabled him to execute at least respectably the airs assigned to the King of the Fairies&#146;, but Sir Julius Benedict wrote that he was &#145;a bad actor with an offensive voice&#146;, and he was not well received. His appearances outside London included Manchester in 1831; he then sang in London at the Olympic Theatre in 1831&#150;2 and Astley's in 1833&#150;4.<br>
