<span class="headword">Speght,  Thomas</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1621), <span class="occ">literary editor</span>, was probably of a Yorkshire family and may himself have been born in Yorkshire. He matriculated sizar at Peterhouse, Cambridge, at Easter in 1566 and received a scholarship from Lady Mildred Cecil, to whose son, Elizabeth I's secretary of state Robert Cecil, he dedicated his two Chaucer editions. Speght graduated with his BA in 1569&#150;70 and took his MA in 1573.<br>
<br>After Cambridge, Speght moved to London at an unknown date, where he was involved in the literary world, and at some point became a schoolmaster. He contributed commendatory verses in Latin to two books of instruction, Abraham Fleming's <span class="italic">A Panoplie of Epistles, or, a Looking Glasse for the Unlearned</span> (1576), and John Baret's <span class="italic">An Alvearie, or, Quadruple Dictionarie</span> (1580). A survey of London made about 1612 shows the house and chapel of St James in the Wall, near Cripplegate, and records Thomas Speght as renting much of the house and using the highest part of the building as a schoolhouse. He was still living there when he drew up his will, on 27 February 1621, requesting burial in the chapel, or, failing that, in St Olave's Church, Silver Street. Probate was granted on 5 June of that year.<br>
<br>His will shows that Speght had married a woman named Anne (her surname was probably Hill), and had at least three sons and eight daughters. All the former and two of the latter were still unmarried, and their father instructed that they be provided for out of the substantial debt (&pound;1200 in all) owed to him by Sir Henry Beaumont, older brother of his friend Francis Beaumont (not the dramatist but the future master of Charterhouse). His sons-in-law included the book collector <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/37380/', "Humfrey Dyson")</script>. Bequests to friends included a ring to Alexander Gil, the headmaster of St Paul's School, who is referred to as &#145;my cosen&#146;. The will names a sister and a brother. The latter, James Speght, may have been the rector of St Mary Magdalen, Milk Street, who was father of the writer Rachel Speght, once mistakenly thought to be Thomas's daughter. Among Thomas's sons, James became a freeman of the Clothworkers' Company and the ground landlord of St James in the Wall, while Laurence was employed in the surveyor-general's office in the time of Charles I. Laurence's epitaph, in the church of St Peter at Clopton, Northamptonshire, refers to his father as &#145;Thomas Speght Schoole-master Paragon&#146;  (P. Whalley, ed., <span class="italic">History and Antiquities of Northamptonshire</span>, 1791, 2.372).<br>
<br>Speght became interested in Chaucer at Cambridge, an enthusiasm he shared with Francis Beaumont, who later contributed a prefatory letter to Speght's Chaucer edition. It is possible that they formed part of a circle of Chaucerians at Peterhouse and it is perhaps significant that they overlapped with the Cambridge years of another noted Chaucerian, Edmund Spenser (1569&#150;76). After Cambridge, Speght appears to have maintained a private interest in Chaucer. In October 1592 a reprint of Chaucer's works was entered in the Stationers' register and by the time this work appeared under the title <span class="italic">The Workes of our Antient and Lerned English Poet, Geffrey Chaucer, Newly Printed</span> early in 1598, Speght was the editor.<br>
<br>In preparing the edition Speght certainly had the help of the antiquary John Stow and the 1598 edition of Chaucer is in some ways not much more than a revision of Stow's own edition of 1561. Although Speght lists works of Chaucer's which he claims were &#145;never before imprinted&#146;  (Speght, <span class="italic">Workes</span>, sig. Aiii<i>v</i>) most of them in fact appeared in Stow's edition, suggesting the extent to which he saw his task as simply presenting anew what Stow had done. Nevertheless, Speght's notes and introductory material are far more elaborate than in any previous edition and he was the first to provide a substantial glossary. While this suggests that Chaucer's language was becoming difficult to read, it is also part of the process whereby the Chaucerian text was dignified by the kind of extensive apparatus a classical author might receive.<br>
<br>Speght also contributed new annotations to the text of Chaucer, of which the most famous is his comment on a reference to the legendary hero Wade. Speght wrote, &#145;because the matter is long and fabulous, I passe it over&#146;  (Speght, <span class="italic">Workes</span>, sig. Bbbb.iiii<i>v</i>), an unfortunate omission as all knowledge of stories of Wade has subsequently been lost.<br>
<br>Also among the introductory material was an extensive biography, which informed all subsequent accounts of the poet's life until the 1840s. Several common beliefs about Chaucer were established here, some of them on the basis of texts attributed to the poet, but spurious. Hence, Chaucer was thought (as supposed author of Thomas Usk's <span class="italic">The Testament of Love</span>) to have spent time in exile in the 1380s and was claimed as a fellow Cantabrian on the basis of <span class="italic">The Court of Love</span>. Speght played up Chaucer's links with John of Gaunt and enhanced the image of the poet as a man who &#145;alwaies held in with the Princes, in whose daies he lived&#146;  (Speght, <span class="italic">Workes</span>, sig. Bvi<i>v</i>). He was also the source of the biographical detail that Chaucer was once fined 2<i>s</i>. for beating a Franciscan friar in Fleet Street. The document supposedly recording this was found in the Inner Temple, leading Speght to suggest that the poet studied law there.<br>
<br>While the beating of the friar has never been disproved, it is suspiciously convenient evidence of an early and vigorous tendency to anti-clericalism on the poet's part, which, making him appear at odds with the Church of Rome, helped to refashion a Chaucer acceptable to Reformation England.<br>
<br>Criticisms of the 1598 edition were forthcoming from Francis Thynne, son of the earlier Chaucer editor William Thynne, in his <span class="italic">Animadversions uppon the Annotacions and Corrections &hellip; of Chaucers Workes</span>. Speght took heed of the criticisms, though they were not always accurate, and in a new edition of Chaucer appearing in 1602 he departed more decisively from Stow. In this work the Chaucerian <i>&#339;uvre</i> was augmented by the <span class="italic">ABC</span>, in print for the first time, and the anti-clerical (but non-Chaucerian) <span class="italic">Jack Upland</span>, which further bolstered the poet's reputation as a Wycliffite.<br>
<br>In 1687 a reprint of this work with a few alterations appeared, and remained in use even after the publication of John Urry's much reviled Chaucer edition of 1721. Thomas Tyrwhitt, editing the <span class="italic">Canterbury Tales</span> in the 1770s, used the 1602 and 1687 editions of Speght, taking the latter as his base text. With a period of influence stretching from the late sixteenth century to the late eighteenth, then, Speght's Chaucer has been the most durable of any Chaucer edition.<br>
