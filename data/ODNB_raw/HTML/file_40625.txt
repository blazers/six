<span class="headword">Chandler,  (Arthur) Bertram</span> <span class="st"> [<em>pseud. </em>George Whitely]</span>  (1912&#150;1984), <span class="occ">writer</span>, was born in the Louisa Margaret Hospital, Aldershot, Hampshire, on 28 March 1912, the son of Arthur Robert Chandler, a private in the 1st Bedford regiment, and his wife, Ida Florence Calver. He grew up in the small town of Beccles, Suffolk, and was educated at the Peddar's Lane council school and the Sir John Leman secondary school, Beccles. He also attended various nautical schools, and at the age of sixteen went to sea as an apprentice with the Sun Shipping Company of London, where he rose to third officer (1928&#150;35). He served with other small shipping companies, and was in the merchant navy during the Second World War. After that he worked for the Shaw Savill Line, London, rising from fourth officer to chief officer (1936&#150;55), and took up residence in Sydney, Australia. He then joined the Union Steamship Company of New Zealand, Wellington, where he started as a third officer and became shipmaster (1956&#150;75). After his retirement, he was often called on by this company to &#145;babysit&#146; ships that were forced to stay in port, because regulations required that there be an officer kept on board. This gave him the opportunity to write more fiction.<br>
<br>Chandler used his own naval experience to prompt his writing of science fiction. His main protagonist was John Grimes, who worked in space ships, usually among what he called the &#145;Rim Worlds&#146;. Faster-than-light travel was essential in Chandler's fiction and he coined the &#145;Mannschenn drive&#146; to provide it. This writing began when in the 1940s he visited John W. Campbell, the editor of his favourite magazine, <span class="italic">Astounding</span>. Campbell printed &#145;This Means War&#146; and most of Chandler's early stories in <span class="italic">Astounding</span>. Chandler published under his own name and under several pseudonyms, including George Whitely. In the United States, Ace publishers produced his books in the 1960s and then DAW in the 1970s; these were paperbacks, and some were reprinted in Britain by Herbert Jenkins and Robert Hale in limited hardback editions, before Sphere Books began publishing paperbacks in the 1980s. Chandler also published some work in Australia, including <span class="italic">The Bitter Pill</span>, <span class="italic">The Wild Ones</span>, and <span class="italic">Kelly Country</span>. The last of these novels features Ned Kelly, the Australian bushranger, and Chandler's research on this work included a visit to the USA to the Library of Congress in Washington, as well as a railway journey from Melbourne to Sydney, taken in order to retrace Kelly's journeying.<br>
<br>Widely travelled as he was, Chandler became very popular in Japan, where he had fan clubs devoted to his writing, and where he was awarded the Seiun Sho award in 1975. His work was published in translation in several languages, including Japanese, German, French, Italian, Spanish, Swedish, and Hebrew. He was given numerous science-fiction awards, including four Ditmars from Australia (1969, 1971, 1974, 1976) and the Invisible Little Man award (1975), and he was guest of honour at the 1982 World Science Fiction Convention in Chicago. He was twice married. He and his first wife, Joan, had a son and two daughters. One of these daughters, Jenny, married the horror-fiction writer Ramsey Campbell. His second wife, Susan Schlenker, survived him. She found him in their flat in a coma on 6 June 1984, but he died the same day in a Sydney hospital and was cremated at Sydney in a small private ceremony on 8 June.<br>
<br>Chandler was known as a great conversationalist, although he had a slight speech impediment, and he enjoyed navigation, ship handling, and cookery as well as writing. He produced forty novels, six collections, and about 200 short stories; the exact number is hard to determine because of cuts and expansions of some shorter works. He joined with his wife Susan in producing two short stories, &#145;The Long Way&#146;  (<span class="italic">Worlds of Tomorrow</span>, Nov 1964) and &#145;The Proper Gander&#146;  (<span class="italic">Analog</span>, Jan 1970). Almost all of his writing was science fiction.<br>
