<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Oliver,  William</span>  (1695&#150;1764), <span class="occ">physician and philanthropist</span>, born at Ludgvan, Cornwall, on 4 August 1695, was baptized on 27 August 1695, and described as the son of John Oliver. The suggestion that he was the illegitimate child of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20735/', "William Oliver (bap. 1658, d. 1716)")</script> may be discounted. Oliver's family originally lived at Trevarnoe in Sithney, and later in Ludgvan; the estate of Treneere in Madron, which belonged to him, was sold after his death in 1768. When he decided to erect a monument in Sithney churchyard to the memory of his parents, Alexander Pope wrote the epitaph and drew the design of the pillar  (<span class="italic">Quarterly Review</span>, 139, 1875, 367&#150;95). Oliver was admitted a pensioner of Pembroke College, Cambridge, on 17 September 1714, graduated MB in 1720 and MD in 1725, and, to complete his medical training, entered Leiden University on 15 November 1720. On 8 July 1756 Oliver was incorporated at Oxford, and was elected FRS on 22 January 1730. He is, however, most renowned as the inventor of the Bath Oliver biscuit.<br>
<br>On returning from Leiden, Oliver practised for a time at Plymouth, where he introduced smallpox inoculation. About 1725 he settled in Bath and remained there for the rest of his life, obtaining in a very short time the leading practice of the city. His medical skill is mentioned by Mrs Anne Pitt  (<span class="italic">Suffolk Letters</span>, 1824, 2.246&#150;50) and by Mrs Delany  (<span class="italic">Autobiography</span>, 2.17; 3.625); and he also attended Ralph Allen in his last illness, receiving a complimentary legacy of &pound;100. However, his popularity was mainly due to his friendship with Ralph Allen, a fellow Cornishman, who introduced him to Pope, William Warburton, and the rest of the guests at his house, Prior Park; and with William Borlase, his &#145;friend and relation&#146;, who, after being his patient in 1730, recommended him to the gentry of the west country. Oliver took great pains to obtain subscriptions for the building of the Water or General Hospital, later the Royal Mineral Water Hospital, at Bath, and in 1737 made an offer of some land for its site, which was at first accepted, but afterwards declined. The following year he was appointed one of the treasurers to the hospital fund, and in July 1739 he became a deputy president. On 1 May 1740 he was appointed physician to the hospital, the same day that Jeremiah Peirce became the surgeon. The regulations for the admission and discharge of English patients were drawn up by Oliver; and in 1756 he compiled a comparable set of rules for patients from Scotland and Ireland. A dominant and even domineering man, Oliver played a major role in the government of the institution until both he and Peirce resigned in 1761; he attended over 600 (more than half) of the meetings of the weekly management committee between 1739 and his death  (minute books, Bath General Hospital).<br>
<br>It has been suggested that Oliver's whig politics made him vulnerable to tory attacks, but the medical conflicts in which he became embroiled were rather a product of professional conservatism and commercial self-interest. In 1743 Oliver was actively involved in the prosecution of Archibald Cleland, one of the surgeons of the hospital, who was dismissed following a charge that he had sexually assaulted female patients. An outsider, Cleland had been engaged in a long and threatening campaign to improve the spa facilities; therefore the allegations offered an excellent pretext for discrediting a competitor. The hospital governors commended Oliver's conduct in the affair. Cleland, on the other hand, was scathing of his anatomical competence (and that of a fellow physician, Alexander Rayner): &#145;I could not have believed that these two learned doctors &hellip; could have been so little versed in these matters, if they had not in their <i>Vindication</i> thus publicly exposed themselves to the censure of every judicious reader&#146;  (A. Cleland, <span class="italic">A Full Vindication of Mr Cleland's Appeal to the Public</span>, 1744, 42). Oliver was at the centre of controversy again in 1757, when he and some other physicians in the city declined to attend any consultations with William Baylies and Charles Lucas, because they had disputed the sulphur content of the waters to which clinical efficacy was traditionally attributed, and criticized the behaviour of the physicians at the hospital. The voluminous correspondence which ensued was published by Lucas in a bid to demonstrate the existence of a physical confederacy in Bath  (<span class="italic">Letters of Doctor Lucas and Doctor Oliver Occasioned by a Physical Confederacy Discovered in Bath</span>, 1757).<br>
<br>Oliver was not a prolific medical writer. In 1723 and 1755 he contributed brief papers to the <span class="italic">Philosophical Transactions</span>; in 1751 his <span class="italic">Practical Essay on the Use and Abuse of Warm Water Bathing in Gouty Cases</span> appeared; and in 1760 he put together a collection of <span class="italic">Cases of the Persons Admitted into the Infirmary at Bath under the Care of Doctor Oliver</span>. Stimulated by the goading of Lucas and Baylies, this last text was republished in 1774 as one of Rice Charleton's <span class="italic">Three Tracts on Bath Water</span>. But Oliver had interests besides medicine. Contemporaries recognized him as a &#145;civilized personality&#146;  (Boyce, 87, 243), well connected with the leading figures who frequented Bath, and fascinated by books, painting, and architecture.<br>
<br>Oliver applied to Dr Borlase for minerals for Pope's grotto, and his name frequently occurs in the letters of Pope and Borlase at Castle Horneck, near Penzance. In the summer of 1743 he wrote to Pope to free himself from all knowledge of John Tillard's attack on Bishop William Warburton, which was dedicated to him without his knowledge  (<span class="italic">Works of Alexander Pope</span>, 9.233). Oliver was also a correspondent of Warburton himself, Philip Doddridge, and Stephen Duck; and he wrote to Dr Wood on the subject of two Roman altars discovered at Bath. Oliver's literary works included several poems, but most famous was the anonymously published <span class="italic">A Faint Sketch of the Life, Character, and Manners of the Late Mr Nash</span>. It was praised by Oliver Goldsmith as &#145;written with much good sense and still more good nature&#146;, and he embodied it within his <span class="italic">Life of Richard Nash</span> (1762). It also appeared in the <span class="italic">Public Ledger</span> of 12 March 1761, and in the Revd Richard Warner's <span class="italic">History of Bath</span> (1801).<br>
<br>Legend has it that towards the end of his life Oliver confided the recipe for the Bath Oliver, a savoury biscuit invented for patients, to his coachman Atkins, giving him at the same time &pound;100 in money and ten sacks of the finest wheat flour. The fortunate recipient is said to have opened a shop in Green Street and acquired a large fortune. Although Atkins did not feature in Oliver's will, the story was told to successive generations of the Oliver family. Fortt &amp; Son of Bath, who were manufacturing the biscuit in the 1960s, lost any documents relating to the origins of the recipe when their premises were bombed in 1941. The Bath Oliver is still well known today. Its creator was commemorated in other ways. A plate in the <span class="italic">Antiquities of Cornwall</span> (1769), engraved at his expense, was inscribed to him by Borlase; and the later impressions of Mary Chandler's <span class="italic">Description of Bath</span> (1736) contained some verses to him (pages 21&#150;3), acknowledging that he had corrected her poem, and that &#145;ev'n Pope approv'd when you had tun'd my Lyre&#146;.<br>
<br>However, it is the hospital which stands as the greatest memorial to Oliver's philanthropy. About 1761 he and Peirce were painted together by William Hoare, in the act of examining three candidates for admission: a splendid picture, which still hangs in the hospital. In 1935, moreover, a plaque was unveiled at Oliver's former town house in Queen Square, Bath, marking his association with the institution.<br>
<br>Oliver purchased in 1746, as a vacation residence, a small farmhouse 2 miles from Box, near Bath, and called it Trevarnoe, after the scene of his childhood and the abode of his fathers. His own son, the third William Oliver, matriculated from Christ Church, Oxford, on 20 January 1749, aged eighteen, and his name appears on the books at Leiden on 21 September 1753. Oliver's eldest daughter married a son of the Revd John Acland, rector of Broadclyst, Devon; his second daughter, Charlotte, married Sir John Pringle on 14 April 1752.<br>
<br>For many years before his death Oliver was subject to the gout. He died at Bath on 17 March 1764, and was buried in the church of Weston, near that city, where an inscription &#145;on a white tablet, supported by palm-branches&#146; was erected to his memory. There is also a plain mural tablet to his memory in the abbey church. The statement in <span class="italic">The Life and Times of Selina, Countess of Huntingdon</span> (ed. A. C. H. Seymour, 1, 1839, 450&#150;51), that he remained &#145;a most inveterate infidel till a short time before his death&#146;, is probably an exaggeration. He was generally admitted to have been an eminently sensible man, with a compassionate and benevolent nature.<br>
