<span class="headword">Wade,  Thomas</span>  (1805&#150;1875), <span class="occ">poet and playwright</span>, was born in Woodbridge, Suffolk, the son of Searles Wade of Woodbridge. Nothing is known of Wade's education or childhood&#151;indeed, biographical evidence on Wade is peculiarly sparse&#151;but he emerged on the literary scene in 1825 with a volume of poems entitled <span class="italic">Tasso and the Sisters &hellip; Poems</span>, which included a preface dated December 1824. Dialogues of blank verse characterize the volume, which tends toward the dramatic, but the centrepiece of the work, &#145;The Nuptials of Juno&#146;, owes a lyric debt to Shelley, a debt which was to pervade Wade's writing. At this early phase of his career Wade turned from poetry to drama, and in this both luck and charisma were with him. Moving now in London's dramatic circles, Wade found a useful patron in Charles Kemble, of the eminent early nineteenth-century acting family and at that time manager of the Theatre Royal, Covent Garden. Kemble's theatre was in dire financial straits&#151;it was in the possession of bailiffs during the 1829&#150;30 season&#151;and, in this desperate situation, the timing was right for an untried dramatic talent such as Wade's. Wade's first effort, <span class="italic">Woman's Love, or, The Triumph of Patience</span>, later to be known as <span class="italic">Duke Andrea</span>, was mounted in December 1829, with Kemble acting the lead role; a fairly simple melodrama based on the Griselda story, the play was a minor success, and was published under its original title in 1829. Wade's next effort, <span class="italic">The Phrenologists</span>, a farce based on the then popular pseudo-science, was performed at Covent Garden in January of 1830 and published that same year.<br>
<br>Wade's next foray into drama was a defining moment in his career, and put to the test the Shelleyan liberalism that seems to have energized him. Called <span class="italic">The Jew of Arragon, or, The Hebrew Queen</span>, Wade's play told the story of a thirteenth-century Spanish king whose love for a Jewish noblewoman leads to a popular insurrection against the Jewish population of Aragon. A thinly veiled political parable, it is an impassioned plea for civil liberties for British Jews. The play was powerfully backed&#151;Charles Kemble again took the lead role, with his equally renowned daughter Fanny playing the Hebrew queen, Rachel&#151;but its d&eacute;but, on 20 October 1830 at Covent Garden, was a disaster. <span class="italic">The Times</span> reported (21 October 1830) the &#145;very loud disapprobation&#146; and hisses of the audience, and Fanny Kemble, years later, was to recall the evening as her one professional failure. Wade, however, seems not to have been daunted by the play's reception; Fanny Kemble, in her <span class="italic">Record of a Girlhood</span>, remembers his composure, and quotes his remark to her father: &#145;Never mind for me, Mr. Kemble; I'll do better another time&#146;  (Kemble, 306). Indeed, Wade published the play in 1830, with a defiant dedication entitled &#145;To the Jews of England&#146; and with the passages censored by the deputy play licenser restored and in capitals.<br>
<br>Despite his courage, however, Wade seems not to have enjoyed &#145;another time&#146; in the drama. He left behind two unacted plays: <span class="italic">Elfrida</span>, of which no copy exists, and <span class="italic">King Henry II</span>, which remains only in manuscript form. At this point Wade seems to have returned to verse, his Shelleyan politics converted into Shelleyan poetics. His most important collection of poetry, entitled <span class="italic">Mundi et cordis, de rebus sempiternis et temporalis: carmina</span> (1835), is an uneven mixture of political verse, including stanzas on the <span class="roman">Reform Bill</span> and on Shelley's death, and finely wrought nature lyrics such as &#145;The Coming of Night&#146; and &#145;The Winter Shore&#146;. Lacking Shelley's gift for formal experimentation, Wade found the confines of the sonnet congenial, and much of his later work is in that form. His subsequent works include <span class="italic">The Contention of Death and Love</span>, <span class="italic">Helena</span>, and <span class="italic">The Shadow Seeker</span>, all published in 1837.<br>
<br>In this period Wade married the pianist and widow Lucy Bridgman, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Eager (<i>d</i>. 1882), and shortly afterward left poetry for journalism, briefly editing <span class="italic">Bell's Weekly Messenger</span>. When this financial venture failed, Wade retired to Jersey, where he edited the <span class="italic">British Press</span> and continued to produce verse, including a number of sonnets and an unpublished translation of Dante's <span class="italic">Inferno</span>, until 1871. Throughout his career, whether in his poetry, his dramatic productions, or his journalistic work, Wade's writing is fired by a reformist zeal and progressive temper, an energy which was inspired by Shelley, who to the last remained Wade's ideal. Wade died in Jersey on 19 September 1875.<br>
