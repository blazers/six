<span class="headword">Lobb,  Stephen</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1699), <span class="occ">nonconformist minister</span>, was the son of Richard Lobb (<i>fl</i>. 1652&#150;1672) of Liskeard, Mill Park, Warleggan, and St Neots, Cornwall, high sheriff of the county in 1652 and MP for St Michael in 1659. His early years are obscure but on 16 April 1672 Lobb received a licence as a presbyterian under the declaration of indulgence to preach in his father's houses at Kenwyn, near Truro, and Mylor, near Falmouth. He married Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1691), daughter of the Independent minister <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22484/', "Theophilus Polwhele")</script> of Tiverton, Devon, and his wife, the daughter of the Independent pastor William Benn. (It is possible that Elizabeth was the playwright <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/45820/', "E. Polewheele")</script>.) Their children included Stephen (<i>d</i>. 1720), who conformed and became chaplain of Penzance Castle; <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/16879/', "Theophilus Lobb (1678&#150;1763)")</script>, who began his ministerial career at Guildford, Surrey, and later became a physician and fellow of the Royal Society; Samuel (<i>d</i>. 1760), rector of Farleigh Hungerford, Somerset; and a daughter who married John Greene, Independent pastor at Great Baddow, Essex. Lobb's brother Peter (<i>d</i>. 1718) was also an Independent minister.<br>
<br>About late 1678 Lobb wrote a lengthy letter to Richard Baxter concerning justification by Christ's imputed righteousness, a position Baxter generally found agreeable, but on 13 January 1679 he defended himself against Lobb's charge that he was insensitive to the &#145;tolerable weaknesses&#146; of others  (Keeble and Nuttall, 2.202). Although Baxter responded favourably to the suggestion of Samuel Annesley and Thomas Vincent that he accept Lobb as his assistant, this proved unworkable when the latter omitted the creed, the Lord's prayer, and the decalogue in the service.<br>
<br>In the early 1680s Lobb published his first works, including a refutation of antinomians, <span class="italic">The Glory of Free-Grace Display'd</span> (1680), to which John Owen contributed a preface. Responding to Edward Stillingfleet's <span class="italic">The Mischief of Separation</span> (1680), Lobb and the presbyterian John Humfrey wrote <span class="italic">An Answer to Dr. Stillingfleet's Sermon</span> (1680), insisting that dissenters were not schismatics and proposing that gathered congregations be comprehended in the Church of England. Samuel Thomas came to Stillingfleet's defence in <span class="italic">The Charge of Schism Renewed</span> (1680), but Lobb and Humfrey held their ground in <span class="italic">A Reply to the Defence of Dr. Stillingfleet</span> (1681), averring that differences among protestants were minor. When Stillingfleet insisted in <span class="italic">The Unreasonableness of Separation</span> (1681) that dissenters conform, Humfrey and Lobb replied in <span class="italic">A Modest and Peaceable Inquiry</span> (1682), arguing that it was &#145;unreasonable to beat the Drum, or sound the Trumpet for a Protestant Civil-wordy-War&#146;  (p. 1). Appealing to the sanctity of conscience, Lobb called for comprehension or indulgence in <span class="italic">The Harmony between the Old and Present Non-Conformists</span> (1682).<br>
<br>After being ordained by Independents and presbyterians in the spring of 1681, Lobb was elected pastor of the Independent church to which Thomas Goodwin and Thankful Owen had ministered. He was convicted of preaching at conventicles in the summer of 1682, yet in October he participated in meetings in London to resolve cases of conscience. JPs and constables raided his meeting-house near Swallow Street, Piccadilly, in December 1682, destroying its furnishings, and again in January 1683, when they arrested two fellow ministers, William Pearse and Marmaduke Roberts.<br>
<br>As the government investigated the Rye House plot in the summer of 1683 the conspirator Zachary Bourne confessed that he had approached Lobb to help recruit men in the London area, but that the latter was concerned that too many were cowardly and would not rebel. Nevertheless, he allegedly promised to seek the release of two members of his congregation who would be helpful in recruiting. On 6 July the privy council ordered his arrest, but he was not captured until early August. Two others with ties to the conspirators, Edward Massey and Norwich Salisbury, implicated Lobb in the scheme to enthrone Monmouth, and the duke himself confessed that &#145;all the considerable Nonconformist Ministers knew of the Conspiracy&#146;, including John Owen  (TNA: PRO, SP 29/434/98). Lobb also knew William Carstares, one of the Scots discussing a co-ordinated insurrection in Scotland on Argyll's behalf. Although Lobb probably knew consideration was being given to an uprising on Monmouth's behalf, the government opted not to prosecute, presumably because it doubted the credibility of Massey and Salisbury. Lobb was released, but the government ordered his rearrest as a dangerous person in October 1683, on suspicion of treason in April and May 1684, and again as a dangerous person in October 1684. His troubles inspired the anonymous satire, <span class="italic">A Dreadful Oration Deliver'd by &hellip; Stephen Lobb</span>.<br>
<br>Lobb was probably the person who corresponded with Baxter between March and June 1684 about occasional conformity and ecclesiastical polity, and he may have written <span class="italic">Bellarminus junior enervatus</span> (1684), defending Owen from Baxter's attack. In <span class="italic">The True Dissenter</span> (1685) he offered a plan for protestant union based on a national church, with oaths of supremacy (excluding liturgy and polity) and allegiance; liberty of conscience; a role for bishops as officers of the crown; and a provision allowing people opposed to oaths to post bonds. After Charles Morton emigrated to New England in 1685, Lobb, Francis Glascock, and William Wickins taught the students in his nonconformist academy. Following Lobb's pardon for treasonable offences in December 1686 he became so close to James II that he was called &#145;the Jacobite Independent&#146;. On 30 April 1687 he and other Independents gave the king a statement of thanks for the declaration of indulgence, and the following January James, seeking nonconformist support, had him circulate a report that Anglicans had offered to suspend the penal laws and the test for Catholics as long as they remained in force for protestant dissenters. In May Lobb and William Penn unsuccessfully attempted to persuade nonconformists to submit another declaration of thanks for the indulgence's renewal. Lobb preached before the lord mayor at Grocers' Hall in September.<br>
<br>In 1690 Lobb helped found the Common Fund to assist needy ministers and train new ones, and in March 1691 he helped establish the Happy Union of Presbyterians and Independents in the London area, hoping to end &#145;our Pernitious, shamefull strifes&#146;  (Keeble and Nuttall, 2.326). From the outset, the union experienced internal strife, partly because of the controversy triggered by republication of Tobias Crisp's antinomian sermons in 1690. Daniel Williams issued a critique in <span class="italic">Gospel-Truth Stated</span> (1692), and the following year Lobb published <span class="italic">A Peaceable Enquiry</span>, profusely citing church historians, Reformation authors (especially Luther), and John Owen to repudiate antinomianism and Socinianism. When Williams was removed from the Pinners' Hall lectures and other Presbyterians resigned in protest, Lobb was appointed to one of the vacancies in February 1695. Williams blamed him for the rupture, especially for misrepresenting his views in a critique commissioned by London Independents. When John Humfrey commented on Lobb's manuscript, Williams retorted in <span class="italic">An Answer to Mr. J. Humphrey's Second Printed Letter</span> (1695). The crux of the debate was whether Christ became sinful for the sins of others, as Lobb asserted. He replied to Williams in <span class="italic">A Letter to Doctor Bates</span> (1695) and more generally in <span class="italic">A Report of the Present State of the Differences</span>, accusing his opponents of Socinianism. This elicited refutations from Vincent Alsop, <span class="italic">A Faithful Rebuke</span> (1697), and Williams, <span class="italic">An Answer to the Report</span> (1698); the latter castigated Lobb's <span class="italic">Report</span> as a &#145;<i>grand peice of Art and Misrepresentation</i>&#146;  (sig. A3<i>v</i>). Lobb responded to Alsop in <span class="italic">A Defence of the Report</span> (1698) and <span class="italic">A Further Defence of the Report</span> (1698). Both sides appealed to Stillingfleet and Jonathan Edwards, both of whom responded by defending Williams. Accused of antinomianism, Lobb and his colleagues asserted their orthodoxy in <span class="italic">A Declaration of the Congregational Ministers</span> (1699). Responding to Lobb's plea to view the <span class="italic">Declaration</span> favourably, Williams wrote <span class="italic">An End to Discord</span> (1699), finding further debate inexcusable. However, the Independent Isaac Chauncy came to the defence of Lobb in <span class="italic">Alexipharmacon</span> (1700), which castigated Stillingfleet's criticism of him.<br>
<br>Lobb, who was living in Middlesex prior to his death, died of a seizure at the London house of the Independent George Griffith on 3 June 1699. In his funeral sermon Thomas Goodwin of Pinner praised him as &#145;a Man of a discerning, penetrating Spirit, of great strength of mind&#146;  (Goodwin, 28).<br>
