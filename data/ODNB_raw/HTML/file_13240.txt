<span class="headword">Higgons,  Bevil</span>  (1670&#150;1736), <span class="occ">historian and poet</span>, was, according to Venn, born at a place called Kezo, the third son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13242/', "Sir Thomas Higgons (1623/4&#150;1691)")</script>, a politician, of Greywell, Hampshire, and his second wife, Bridget Leach, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Granville (<i>d</i>. 1692), daughter of Sir Bevil Granville and widow of Sir Simon Leach, of Cadleigh, Devon. On 5 March 1686, at the age of sixteen, he matriculated as a commoner from St John's College, Oxford, but in Michaelmas he migrated to Trinity Hall, Cambridge, where he was admitted as a fellow commoner. His first production in print was a set of English verses addressed to the queen on the birth of the prince, James Francis Edward Stuart, which he wrote for inclusion in the university collection of congratulatory poems entitled <span class="italic">Illustrissimi principis ducis Cornubiae &hellip; Genethliacon</span> (1688). He was admitted as a student of the Middle Temple on 12 November 1687, but was not called to the bar.<br>
<br>Higgons and his two brothers, George and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/65474/', "Thomas Higgons (1668/9&#150;1733)")</script>, were Jacobites and in 1689 they joined their uncle, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/11488/', "Denis Granville")</script>, dean of Durham, who had become Anglican chaplain to James II in exile at St Germain-en-Laye, France. Bevil kept his wit and good humour unimpaired in exile. In 1692 he and his brothers travelled in secret to England to help raise Jacobite regiments to support the abortive rising planned to coincide with a landing of James II's army in France. They were heavily involved in the Fenwick plot in 1696, another failed attempt to engineer a Jacobite rising and a French-backed Jacobite restoration. The affair was complicated by an unplanned attempt to assassinate William III and warrants were issued for the arrest of Higgons and his brothers in February 1696, but they were later released. Little is known of Bevil's movements until 1704 when he and Thomas, by then gentleman usher to James III, accompanied Mary of Modena at Dean Granville's funeral in Paris. From 1715 onwards he lived off a share of the pension that his brother Thomas had obtained from James III after he had been replaced as James's secretary of state by Lord Bolingbroke. In July of that year Bevil was ordered by James II's illegitimate son, the duke of Berwick, to go to England to find out the plans for a Jacobite rising and to consider whether James should land in England or Scotland. He never left France as the situation became too dangerous in Britain.<br>
<br>Higgons returned to England in 1718 and spent the rest of his life there writing in defence of the Stuarts and their cause. Of his historical works the most important was <span class="italic">A short view of the English history; with reflections on the reigns of the kings, their characters and manners, their succession to the throne; and all other remarkable incidents, to the Revolution, 1688</span>. After letting his manuscripts for this work &#145;lie cover'd with dust these twenty-six years&#146;, Higgons published it in London in 1723; subsequent editions were published at The Hague in 1727, and at London in 1734 and 1748. A French translation was also published at The Hague in 1729. In 1725 he published <span class="italic">Historical and Critical Remarks on Bishop Burnet's History of his Own Time</span> (2nd edn 1727). Both of these works were reissued in 1736 under the title <span class="italic">The Historical Works of Bevill Higgons</span>. A work purporting to be by Higgons, <span class="italic">A History of the Life and Reign of Mary, Queen of Scots and Dowager of France</span>, was printed in Dublin in 1753.<br>
<br>As a poet Higgons published several poems in Dryden's <span class="italic">Examen poeticum</span> (1693), in the first of which he applauded Dryden on his translation of Persius. He is believed to have contributed to Elijah Fenton's <span class="italic">Poems on Several Occasions</span> (1717) and published under his own name in 1713 his panegyric &#145;A Poem on the Peace&#146;, which was reprinted in 1731 as &#145;A Poem on the Glorious Peace&#146;. He also wrote for the stage: in addition to a prologue and an epilogue for plays by his kinsman George Granville, Baron Lansdowne, his own play <span class="italic">The Generous Conqueror, or, The Timely Discovery</span> was performed at the Theatre Royal in 1702. This was said to have &#145;illustrated the right divine and impeccability&#146; of James II and though it met with a neutral reaction on its first night, the audience stayed away subsequently. One critic, possibly Charles Gildon, attributed the failure to the fact that the play &#145;was writ after an untoward manner, and above half the Town condemn'd it as Turbulent and Factious&#146;  (<span class="italic">A Comparison between the Two Stages, with an Examen of the Generous Conqueror</span>, 1702, 79&#150;139).<br>
<br>Higgons died unmarried in Chiswick on 1 March 1736 and was buried in St Pancras churchyard on 6 March.<br>
