<span class="headword">Oswald,  Richard</span>  (1705?&#150;1784), <span class="occ">merchant and diplomat</span>, was born, probably in 1705, in Dunnet, Caithness, Scotland, the second of the four children of George Oswald (1664&#150;1726), the Presbyterian minister of Dunnet, and his wife, Margaret (<i>d</i>. 1747), of Pennyland, Caithness, the daughter of Richard Murray of Scotscalder, Caithness, and his wife, Jean Smythe. The suggestion in the <span class="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</span> that Richard Oswald was the unsuccessful candidate for the Thurso schoolmastership can be discarded on the grounds that, since the search took place in 1711, he would have been at most eleven years old when applying for the position. He left Caithness at the age of twenty after his father's death and apprenticed himself to his older cousins Richard (1687&#150;1763) and Alexander Oswald (1694&#150;1766), who had built a successful trade in Glasgow in tobacco, sugar, and wine. During the 1730s he travelled through southern North America and the Caribbean as their factor, distributing supplies to planters, collecting crops in payment, and dunning tardy debtors. He returned to Glasgow in 1741 and became a junior partner in his cousins' firm.<br>
<br>Assisted by several thousand pounds of prize profits reaped during the War of the Austrian Succession, Oswald moved to London in early 1746 and, from a counting-house at 17 Philpot Lane, commenced an ambitious shipping and merchandising operation. At first tobacco played an important role in his business, but he soon branched out into horses, slaves, and sugar. He undergirded his capital-intensive tobacco and slave adventures with a marriage on 12 November 1750, at St Martin-in-the-Fields to Mary Ramsay (1719&#150;1788), the daughter of a wealthy Jamaica merchant, Alexander Ramsay (<i>d</i>. 1738), and his wife, Jean Ferguson, and a partnership with two fellow Scots who had moved to London in the 1740s, John Mill (1710&#150;1771) and Robert Scott (<i>d</i>. 1771). With the support this cohort provided, Oswald began to exploit opportunities in two additional areas&#151;government contracting and land speculation. Contracting came first, helped by the support of a cousin, James Oswald of Dunnikier, who sat on the Treasury board. Richard Oswald supplied summer encampments in southern England with bread, forage, straw, wood, and wagons in 1756, 1757, and 1758. In 1758 he agreed to supply the troops in Germany with bread. Over the course of the Seven Years' War he executed three separate contracts and held two separate commissions with the commissariat; in all, he cleared over &pound;125,000. The end of the war in 1763 ushered in a new era of enterprise for Oswald, a period of large-scale land acquisition and development&#151;activities which meshed neatly with ongoing slaving and shipping businesses. In the Caribbean he acquired title to four plantations, totalling 1566 acres. In North America, after false starts in Nova Scotia and South Carolina, he obtained 30,000 acres in East Florida near the confluence of the Halifax and Timoka rivers. His greatest investment occurred closer to home, however: between 1764 and 1784 he acquired and &#145;improved&#146; roughly 7000 acres on the banks of the River Ayr in Ayrshire (the Auchincruive estate) and about the same amount in Kirkcudbrightshire and Dumfriesshire (the Cavens estate).<br>
<br>Oswald's global interests were sorely tested by the American War of Independence. During these years he curtailed his operations overseas. In 1780 he sold land he owned in Virginia, and the following year he began to withdraw from Florida. At the same time he stepped up his involvement in politics, which until then had been largely advisory. He wrote memoranda on military strategy, drawing on years of experience in and with the colonies, and submitted them to friends in Whitehall. In December 1781 he provided bail to release his old correspondent and friend Henry Laurens, who had previously used Oswald's counting-house as his own office whenever he was in London and who had been imprisoned in the Tower since September 1780. In March 1782 the marquess of Rockingham, on the advice of the earl of Shelburne, made Oswald his emissary in Paris to ascertain the American position on peace. There is no evidence to support the <span class="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</span>'s claim that Adam Smith had introduced Shelburne to Oswald, or that Smith's ideas became Oswald's own; the Oswald and Shelburne circles had overlapped for decades, and Oswald's thoughts on protected and free trade were more nuanced and self-serving than Smith's. Between April and June Oswald shuttled between London and Paris. His work was frustrated by the presence and conflicting claims of competing representatives appointed by Shelburne's rivals in the ministry. When Rockingham died in early July, Shelburne, who succeeded Rockingham as chief minister, removed the others and, in a commission dated 25 July 1782, appointed Oswald sole British representative charged with crafting an American peace. From the beginning to the end of the negotiations Oswald adhered to the belief that America's commercial dependence on Britain was the critical issue, and that political dependence meant comparatively little. These beliefs withstood the assistance provided by Henry Strachey and Alleyne Fitzherbert, who had been sent by Shelburne in the autumn to make sure Oswald did not give away too much. Oswald was too highly regarded by the Americans to consider his replacement. Five months after his appointment Oswald gave Shelburne a testament of these beliefs in the form of the preliminary articles of peace. This agreement, the first of the settlements to come out of Paris, raised a storm of protest at home and eventually brought down the Shelburne administration and, with it, the peacemaker. The preliminary articles proved more lasting than did the objections to it, however, and Oswald's terms were accepted without revision as the final treaty of Paris in September 1783.<br>
<br>After returning to London Oswald retreated to the comfort of his family and friends, dividing his days between his new town house, 9 Great George Street, and his mansion on the banks of the River Ayr designed and decorated by James Adam. When in London he entertained the American negotiators on their return to the United States. He occasionally dabbled in trade, although he passed the management of the firm on to his nephews John (1747&#150;1808) and Alexander Anderson (1756&#150;1832). He died in his bedroom at Auchincruive at 6 a.m. on 6 November 1784, and was buried in the High Church, Glasgow. With no legitimate children (he had fathered two illegitimate sons in the 1740s, but they had predeceased him), his substantial estate passed to his nephew <a name="cosubject_20920"></a><span class="headword">George Oswald</span>  (1735&#150;1819)<span class="occ"></span>. His wife, Mary, died on 6 December 1788 and was buried alongside the peacemaker in the Oswald vault at St Quivox parish church.<br>
<br>Oswald's nephew George Oswald of Scotstoun, near Glasgow, was born on 30 July 1735 in Dunnet, Caithness, one of the eight children of his elder brother, the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/65580/', "Revd James Oswald (1703&#150;1793)")</script>, Presbyterian minister of Dunnet and (after 1750) Methven, Perthshire, and in 1765 moderator of the general assembly of the Church of Scotland, and his first wife, Elizabeth, the daughter of James Murray and his wife, Margaret Sinclair. George Oswald first worked for his father's cousins, Richard and Alexander Oswald, and in the late 1760s he established his own tobacco-trading firm on Virginia Street under the name of Oswald, Dennistoun &amp; Co. He also served as a partner in Glasgow's Ship Bank. In January 1764 he married Margaret (1747&#150;1791), the daughter of David Smythe of Methven; they had four sons and five or six daughters. He acquired the small estates of Scotstoun and Balshagray, near Glasgow, in 1766, after the deaths of Richard and Alexander Oswald, and in 1784 he inherited the estate of Auchincruive on the death of his uncle Richard. In 1797 he was elected the rector of Glasgow University. He died on 6 October 1819, and was succeeded by his son Richard Alexander Oswald (1771&#150;1841).<br>
