<span class="headword">Amos <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Bunting]</span>,  Sarah Maclardie</span>  (1840/41&#150;1908), <span class="occ">political activist</span>, was born in Manchester, the youngest daughter of Thomas Percival Bunting, a Manchester solicitor and third son of prominent Wesleyan Methodist Jabez Bunting (1779&#150;1858), and of Eliza Bealey of Ratcliffe, near Manchester. Sarah had two sisters, Mary, later Belsher, and Eliza, later Chubb. Her brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32171/', "Percy William Bunting (1836&#150;1911)")</script>, editor of the <span class="italic">Contemporary Review</span> from 1882 until his death, shared many of his sister's more ardent political commitments.<br>
<br>Sarah Bunting moved to London in 1865 and took up the post of lady superintendent at the Working Women's College in Queen Square. It was through her work there that she met her future husband, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/454/', "Sheldon Amos (1835&#150;1886)")</script>, an old friend of her brother. He was the fourth son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/453/', "Andrew Amos")</script> and his wife, Margaret Lax. Amos was a volunteer lecturer in law at the Working Men's College in Camden Town, professor of jurisprudence at University College, London, and reader in jurisprudence and Roman law at the Temple. They married on 24 December 1870 and lived at first in a poor central London neighbourhood, near Theobald's Row, in order not to segregate themselves from the poor. After the birth of their son, they moved to a house in New Barnet. The couple had two children, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30403/', "(Percy) Maurice Maclardie Amos (1872&#150;1940)")</script>, a lawyer, and Bont&eacute;, later Elgood (1874&#150;<i>c</i>.1961), an early woman doctor. Both children were educated at home.<br>
<br>Sarah and Sheldon Amos were greatly involved in the campaign for the repeal of the <span class="roman">Contagious Diseases Acts</span>, and Sarah was a member of the Ladies' National Association for the Repeal of the Contagious Diseases Acts. Her interest in the meeting point between morals and politics was to be long-standing. Later in life she was active in the National Vigilance Association, as well as the Social Purity Association, the British Women's Temperance Association, the London Morality Council, and the British committee of the Abolitionist Federation, pledged to fight the regulation of prostitution wherever it appeared. She spoke at the first White Slave Traffic Congress, held in London in 1899, and her article in support of women's suffrage appeared in the <span class="italic">Contemporary Review</span> in June 1892.<br>
<br>Sheldon Amos's health was much compromised by severe asthma, and in 1879, on the advice of his doctors, the family left Britain for warmer climes. They settled first in Australia, at Manly Beach, Sydney. In 1880, finding Australia uncongenial, they set sail once again for Britain, but both Sarah and Sheldon caught dengue fever and stopped to recuperate in Cairo. They liked Egypt so much that the family settled there in 1880, remaining until Sheldon's death. Sarah Amos founded and managed a home for emancipated women slaves in Cairo, while her husband set about revitalizing his legal career, in which pursuit he was aided by the imposition of British rule in 1882.<br>
<br>Widowed in January 1886, Sarah Amos and her children embarked on a lengthy European tour and in late 1887 arrived back in London, taking a house in Upper Woburn Place, Bloomsbury. She resumed those political activities in which she had earlier been involved, though she now also travelled widely, visiting India, Japan, and China before her death. She sat on the executive committee of the Women's Liberal Federation, was active in music-hall reform, the National Union of Women Workers, and the Salvation Army, took up the cause of the Boers, and served briefly on the Marylebone vestry before the reorganization of local government in the 1890s. At the time of the Armenian massacres she spent some months (probably in 1896) in Cyprus organizing a refuge for Armenian women and children.<br>
<br>Among her friends Sarah Amos numbered the journalist and social reformer William Stead, Cardinal Manning, George Bernard Shaw, Mandell and Louise Creighton, and the archaeologist Flinders Petrie. She met, though never became friends with, the Indian activist Cornelia Sorabji, during the latter's years in London in the early 1890s.<br>
<br>A lifelong supporter of women's suffrage, Sarah Amos was deeply influenced by the work of John Stuart Mill and Frederick Denison Maurice. The political activities in which she partook were concerned largely, though not exclusively, with improvements in the material and political conditions of women. She never wavered from a devout low-church Christianity nor from a radical Liberalism. She died at her son's house in Cairo on 21 January 1908.<br>
