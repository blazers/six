<span class="headword">Echlin <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Bellingham]</span>,  Elizabeth</span>, Lady Echlin  (<em>bap. </em>1704, <em>d.</em> 1782), <span class="occ">author</span>, was baptized on 6 March 1704 at Rufford, Lancashire, the elder of the two daughters of William Bellingham (<i>c</i>.1660&#150;1718), son of James and Elizabeth Bellingham of Levens, Westmorland, and his wife, Elizabeth, daughter of William Spencer of Ashton, Lancashire, and widow of Robert Hesketh (<i>d</i>. 1697), of Rufford. The Bellinghams were a prominent landed family, but the estate inherited by Elizabeth's father in 1693 had been squandered by his elder brother Alan (1656&#150;1693), and Levens Hall, the Bellingham home for over a century, had been sold. Called to the bar in 1686, William Bellingham seems to have practised law for a while, but his marriage of 1703 restored his fortunes and provided the Rufford home in which his two daughters and coheirs were raised with their half-sister, Elizabeth Hesketh (1694&#150;1776), the future countess of Derby. Decades later the younger daughter, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/39721/', "Dorothy Bradshaigh")</script>, had Elizabeth in mind when describing &#145;a sister, that, before [the age of twenty], read divinity &hellip; lectured me for saying short prayers, and talked like a sage old woman&#146;  (Barbauld, 6.112).<br>
<br>The air of religiosity did not impede Elizabeth's marriage in 1727 to Sir Robert Echlin, second baronet (1699&#150;1757), an Irishman of Scots descent, and for the next thirty years Lady Echlin lived at Rush House, the family estate (previously owned by the dukes of Ormond) in north-east co. Dublin. She also resided for periods in Dublin itself, but at some distance from a fashionable society in which, by her own account, she was thought uncouth, methodistical, and &#145;a strange, old-fashioned, humdrum creature&#146;  (Barbauld, 5.40). Her two sons, Henry and Robert, died young, but her daughter Elizabeth survived to marry, in 1747, Francis Palmer of Palmerston, co. Mayo, into whose family the Rush estate eventually passed. Little trace of the scenes described in her letters now survives: the house was devastated by fire in the following century, and its grandiose Victorian successor, Kenure House, was demolished in 1973. A coastal grotto or &#145;shell house&#146; built by Lady Echlin in 1755&#150;6, and engraved with verses composed for the occasion by the novelist Samuel Richardson, is marked on Rocque's 1759 map of co. Dublin, and has recently been discovered in use as a cattle pen.<br>
<br>It is from her association with Richardson, begun in 1753 through the grudging offices of Lady Bradshaigh, that Lady Echlin's reputation now derives. Until Richardson's death in 1761 the two corresponded regularly on subjects including the alternative ending to <span class="italic">Clarissa</span> which Lady Echlin seems to have written at her sister's Lancashire house in the winter of 1748&#150;9 (when the novel's final instalment was published), and which she at last sent to Richardson six years later. Several of her letters, including picturesque accounts of Villa Russa (Rush House) and Rock-savage (the grotto), appeared in Barbauld's <span class="italic">Correspondence of Samuel Richardson</span> (1804), but the alternative ending remained unpublished until 1982. Presented with an odd mixture of self-deprecation and assertiveness&#151;the ending is &#145;a jumble of ill-connected thoughts &hellip; badly told&#146;, but sets right the original &#145;in several material points, which I presume to think faulty&#146;  (E. Echlin, 174, 172)&#151;it is a providentialist attempt to evade the tragic logic of <span class="italic">Clarissa</span>, written in the sentimental mode of the early Sarah Fielding, but lightened by comic touches. The novel's two protagonists still die, but Clarissa's rape is averted and Lovelace turns penitent; Bella marries &#145;a dirty, stinking, cross-leg'd prick-louse&#146; named Mr Cabbage  (ibid., 162&#150;3).<br>
<br>Sir Robert Echlin died on 13 May 1757 and was buried at nearby Lusk, where his tomb bears a memorial inscription adapted by Lady Echlin from Pope's epitaphs on Mrs Corbett and Elijah Fenton. From 1759 Lady Echlin lived mainly in England. A year later she was still describing herself to Richardson (whom she had yet to meet) as &#145;the most unfashionable plain country body you can imagine&#146;  (Barbauld, 5.100), but the unflattering picture presented by Barbauld's selections and character sketch of 1804 was contested in the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> by Lady Echlin's granddaughter Elizabeth Budworth (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Palmer), who stressed her polite accomplishments, charitable works, and religious orthodoxy. At the time of her death she was living at Bellingham Lodge, on the edge of Lady Bradshaigh's Lancashire estate, Haigh Hall. She was interred in the Bradshaigh family vault at All Saints, Wigan, on 9 July 1782.<br>
