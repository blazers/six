<span class="headword">Pakenham, Sir  Thomas</span>  (1757&#150;1836), <span class="occ">naval officer and politician</span>, fourth son of Thomas Pakenham, first Baron Longford (1713&#150;1766), and Elizabeth Cuffe (1719&#150;1794), was born on 29 September 1757, possibly at Pakenham Hall, co. Westmeath. Owing to the modest circumstances of his father, Pakenham was destined early on for a military career. Following the example of his eldest brother, Edward Michael Pakenham (later second Baron Longford), he entered the Royal Navy. In 1771 he joined the <i>Southampton</i>, under the command of a fellow Irishman, Captain John Macbride, with whom he moved to the <i>Orpheus</i> in 1773. In the following year he was on the coast of Guinea with Captain William Cornwallis in the <i>Pallas</i>, and in 1775 he was appointed acting lieutenant of the <i>Sphinx</i> on the coast of North America. Following the arrival of reinforcements under Lord Charles Cornwallis off the American coast in May 1776 he was sent to deliver urgent dispatches to General Sir William Howe in Halifax. After successfully evading pursuit by an American squadron he completed his mission, and was consequently promoted by Vice-Admiral Molyneux Shuldham, commander-in-chief of the North American station, to the rank of lieutenant in the frigate <i>Greyhound</i>.<br>
<br>While assigned to this ship Pakenham was engaged in several actions both ashore and afloat, in the course of which he was severely wounded. On the return of the <i>Greyhound</i> to England in 1778 he transferred to the <i>Courageux</i> (74 guns), commanded by Lord Mulgrave, as second lieutenant. In the following spring he was moved into the <i>Europe</i> (64 guns) as first lieutenant, going to North America with the flag of Rear-Admiral Marriot Arbuthnot, and on 21 September 1779 he was promoted to the command of the sloop <i>Victor</i>, newly captured from the enemy. He was then sent to the Jamaica station where, on 2 March 1780, he was appointed by Sir Peter Parker the elder to command the <i>San Carlos</i> (32 guns), a ship captured from the Spanish. However, Pakenham's poor health compelled him to return to England in the autumn. In December 1780 he was appointed to command the <i>Crescent</i> (28 guns), attached to the fleet under Vice-Admiral George Darby, which relieved Gibraltar in April 1781, and was sent to Minorca in company with the <i>Flora</i>.<br>
<br>On their way back, in passing through the strait of Gibraltar on 30 May, the British ships encountered two Dutch frigates, one of which, the <i>Castor</i>, eventually surrendered to the <i>Flora</i>, while the other, the <i>Brill</i>, overpowered and captured the <i>Crescent</i>. However, the <i>Crescent</i> was immediately recaptured by the <i>Flora</i>, the <i>Brill</i> making her escape; but both <i>Crescent</i> and <i>Castor</i> had received so much damage in the action that they fell into the hands of two French frigates on the way home, only the <i>Flora</i>, with Pakenham aboard, escaping. He had refused to resume the command of the <i>Crescent</i>, maintaining that by his surrender to the <i>Brill</i> his commission was cancelled, and that when recaptured by the <i>Flora</i>, the <i>Crescent</i> was on the same footing as any other prize. For the loss of his ship he was tried by court martial and honourably acquitted, it being proved that he did not strike the flag until through heavy casualties, the fall of her masts, and the disabling of her guns further resistance was impossible. In recognition of his exemplary conduct he was at once appointed to the new frigate <i>Minerva</i> (38 guns), which he commanded in 1782 at the relief of Gibraltar by Admiral Lord Howe.<br>
<br>In 1785 Pakenham married Louisa (<i>c</i>.1765&#150;1833), daughter of the Rt Hon John Staples of co. Tyrone, and niece of the prominent Irish politician and landowner Thomas Conolly. As a consequence of this marriage he came into wealth and property, and assumed a prominent place in Irish polite society. His eldest son, Edward Michael, born in 1786, later inherited the major part of the estates belonging to Conolly, and took this surname in lieu of Pakenham. In 1793 Pakenham commissioned the <i>Invincible</i> (74 guns), and in her took part in the battle of 1 June 1794, when his conduct was described as particularly brilliant. Afterwards he was recommended by Lord Howe for the gold medal. Late in 1794 he seems to have been involved in negotiations at Spithead with striking Irish sailors and marines aboard the <i>Culloden</i>, then commanded by Captain Thomas Troubridge. In the following year he was made colonel of marines, and assumed command of the <i>Juste</i> (84 guns), in the capture of which, on 1 June 1794, he had played a crucial role. In December 1796 he may have sensed the mood of dissatisfaction in the fleet that eventually led to the Nore and Spithead mutinies, warning the first lord of the Admiralty that seamen were &#145;increasingly discontented&#146; at the substantial arrears in the payment of their wages  (Dugan, 33).<br>
<br>A flamboyant and popular officer, Pakenham was described by one contemporary as a &#145;regular character&#146;, who maintained a large following of Irishmen under his command at sea  (Dillon, 1.137). He was promoted rear-admiral on 14 February 1799, became vice-admiral on 23 April 1804, and admiral on 31 July 1810, but despite his proven merit he never hoisted his flag on active service. He was for some time master-general of the ordnance in Ireland, and was active in this capacity during the uprising of 1798, serving under Lord Cornwallis and General Lake. He was an MP in the Irish House of Commons from 1783 to 1800, was knighted on 16 May 1820, and died in Dublin on 2 February 1836. His fifth son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21140/', "Sir Richard Pakenham")</script>, achieved prominence in the diplomatic service.<br>
