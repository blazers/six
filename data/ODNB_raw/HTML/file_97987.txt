<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Cherrill,  Frederick Rupert</span>  (1892&#150;1964), <span class="occ">police officer and fingerprint expert</span>, was born in a cottage in Malt House Row, Dorchester-on-Thames, Berkshire, on 18 September 1892, the sixth of the nine children of George Edward Cherrill (1855&#150;1923), carpenter, and his wife, Emma Ann, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Crook (1858&#150;1923), who had been in domestic service. He was educated at the village school in Dorchester and at an art college in Oxford. His mother wanted him to train as a woodcarver and for a time he worked as a carpenter but from childhood, inspired by the fictional detective Sexton Blake, Cherrill wished to become a detective policeman. His fascination with fingerprints also began as a child, when he noticed the marks he imprinted in flour dust while assisting at the local watermill. His decision to apply to the police force was cemented by a chance meeting with a former policeman who occupied an adjoining hospital bed when Cherrill was recovering from an operation to remove a cervical rib. His new acquaintance mentioned Sir Edward Henry's <span class="italic">The Classification and Uses of Finger Prints</span> (1900). Cherrill obtained a library copy and learned it &#145;pretty well off by heart&#146; with the result that he was &#145;well versed in the history and theory of fingerprints&#146; long before he joined the police  (<span class="italic">Cherrill of the Yard</span>, 10).<br>
<br>Cherrill entered the Metropolitan Police in November 1914 as a constable attached to Wandsworth Common station. On 28 January 1915 he married Mabel Kate (1894&#150;1973), daughter of Henry Room, tailor, of Cowley St John, Oxford; Joan, their only child, was born in 1916 (in 1938 she married John Godsell, later chief superintendent of New Scotland Yard's fingerprint bureau). In November 1915 Cherrill rescued a woman from a house fire, for which act of bravery he received a medal and the sum of 2 guineas from the Society for the Protection of Life from Fire.<br>
<br>From the start of his police career Cherrill aspired to join the fingerprint bureau, which had been established in 1901. He realized his ambition by way of competitive entry in July 1920 and was trained by the bureau's second head, Superintendent Charles Stockley Collins (1866&#150;1932). Cherrill gained successive promotions and attained the rank of chief superintendent in July 1949. In May 1938 he succeeded Harry Battley (1883&#150;1960) as chief of the fingerprint bureau. He held the position until his retirement in January 1953.<br>
<br>During his years as a detective Cherrill may &#145;have solved more murder cases than any other detective at the Yard&#146;  (<span class="italic">New York Times</span>, 24 Dec 1964). Among his most renowned investigations were the Blackout Ripper murders, in which a Royal Air Force cadet, Gordon Frederick Cummins, killed and mutilated four women in London in the space of a few days in February 1942; the theft of the duchess of Windsor's jewels from Ednam Lodge, Surrey, in October 1946; and the Maidenhead &#145;trunk murder&#146; of June 1948 in which a fragment of a fingerprint led to a conviction.<br>
<br>Cherrill, who was also a handwriting expert, testified frequently for the prosecution. Many murderers were convicted and hanged after his calm and authoritative court testimony. He considered the most dramatic trial in which he was involved to be that of the career criminal Harold Dorian Trevor, who was convicted of the murder in October 1941 of an elderly widow and executed in March 1942. In retirement Cherrill claimed that he knew no instance of an innocent person being executed but in December 1949 he played a minor role in investigating the notorious murders at 10 Rillington Place, Notting Hill, for which Timothy Evans was wrongfully hanged before the guilt of John Christie was established. A month before Evans's trial Cherrill shared a convivial cup of tea with Mr and Mrs Christie in their flat  (<span class="italic">Cherrill of the Yard</span>, 168, 232).<br>
<br>Cherrill gained the coronation medal, police long service medal, MBE (1943), king's police medal (1953), and many commendations. In the course of his police service he is known to have lived in Upper Tooting and Mitcham, Surrey. His autobiography, <span class="italic">Cherrill of the Yard</span> (1954), is mainly an account of some of his most famous cases. It was a popular success in Britain and the USA, where it was issued under the title <span class="italic">Fingerprints Never Lie</span>; the <span class="italic">New York Times</span> reviewed it enthusiastically. Within a year the British edition was reprinted for a second time. The book, also published in paperback and book club formats, provided the basis for television programmes. Although Cherrill hinted at a further volume of memoirs, no such book ever appeared. In the course of his career and in early retirement, however, he published several works on his area of expertise. These included <span class="italic">Notes on Fingerprints and Palmprints</span> (1940), &#145;Fingerprints&#146; in the <span class="italic">Journal of Criminal Science</span> (1950); &#145;Fingerprints and Disease&#146; in <span class="italic">Nature</span> (7 October 1950); and <span class="italic">The Fingerprint System at Scotland Yard: a Practical Treatise on Fingerprint Identification</span> (1954), which updated books by Henry and Battley. Cherrill had a minor speaking role, as a fingerprint officer, in the classic Ealing Studios film <span class="italic">The Blue Lamp</span> (1950).<br>
<br>Cherrill's importance in the history of fingerprint science derives partly from his length of service, throughout the whole of which he remained active at the scenes of crimes, and the cases he investigated. He was a &#145;supreme clinical&#146; analyst of fingerprints  (<span class="italic">The Guardian</span>, 24 Dec 1964) and &#145;an unusually able professional police technician&#146;  (<span class="italic">New York Times</span>, 28 Nov 1954). His knowledge of his subject was &#145;encyclopaedic&#146; and his experience &#145;immense&#146;  (Nott-Bower). Such was his fame that he became widely known as the Fingerprint Man. Cherrill contributed much to the technical advance of fingerprint science, technology, and classification. He collaborated with Battley in developing the single fingerprint system of identification, pioneered the use of palm prints as evidence, and oversaw the introduction of fingerprint data transmission by radio. Under his leadership the scope, scale, and efficiency of the Fingerprint Bureau were improved.<br>
<br>Though widely acknowledged as &#145;the greatest fingerprint expert in the country&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 9 Oct 1935), Cherrill was repeatedly attacked in print, sometimes ferociously, by George Wilton Wilton (1862&#150;1964). Wilton, who championed Henry Faulds as a fingerprint pioneer, accused Cherrill of variously ignoring, understating, or denying Faulds's historical significance and, in doing so, undermining efforts to secure civil list pensions for Faulds's daughters. Cherrill thought Wilton &#145;not a reasonable person&#146;  (Cherrill to G. Carmichael, secretary, New Scotland Yard, 29 Dec 1954, TNA: PRO, MEPO 3/2546).<br>
<br>Cherrill was portly, pink-faced, and jowly. When conducting his police duties outdoors he was seldom without a bowler hat. Though his demeanour could seem forbidding, he possessed benevolence, a sharp sense of humour, and a fund of anecdotes. His hobbies were fishing, for which he had a passion from boyhood, shooting, gardening, reading, woodworking, painting, and drawing. He was a skilled caricaturist of his police colleagues, lawyers, and others. He loved nature and routinely carried a magnifying glass to enable him to inspect flowers. In 1959 he returned to Dorchester, and lived with his wife in a bungalow on Abingdon Road. In retirement he continued to be consulted by barristers in need of his expert help. He died of congestive heart failure at the Radcliffe Infirmary, Oxford, on 23 December 1964 and was buried in Dorchester cemetery on 31 December.<br>
