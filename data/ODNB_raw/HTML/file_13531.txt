<span class="headword">Holland <span class="st"> [Holand]</span>,  John</span>  (1658&#150;1721), <span class="occ">merchant and banker</span>, was born in the Bridewell precinct of the City of London, the elder son of Captain Philip Holland, a professional sailor whose family originated from Colchester, Essex, and who was captain, in the Cromwellian navy, of the <i>Assurance</i>, flagship of the earl of Sandwich's Baltic fleet in 1659. Philip Holland obtained a pardon under the terms of the declaration of Breda and initially retained his command. He remained a nonconformist and although appointed to the fireship <i>Loyal Merchant</i> in 1665, he deserted and joined the Dutch during the Medway raid in 1667. The family remained in England, and Philip Holland was arrested but pardoned in 1672 in return for information about Dutch intentions during the Third Anglo-Dutch War.<br>
<br>John Holland was apprenticed to a London mercer in 1673, and there is evidence that in the mid-1670s he spent time in the Netherlands learning Dutch bookkeeping and accounting methods. In 1676 he was appointed clerk assistant to Francis Beyer, appointed auditor-general of the East India Company in 1675. The next twelve years were spent as a successful merchant, which cannot be explained by his salary of &pound;40 a year as accountant for cotton imports in the company. A best guess is that he took shares in major voyages. In 1687 he married Jane Fowke (<i>c</i>.1669&#150;1740), the only daughter of the second marriage of Walter Fowke MD, of Brewood Hall and Little Wyrley, Staffordshire. Brewood Hall became their principal home, and this was where their three surviving children, <a href="#cosubject_13539">Richard Holland [<i>see below</i>]</a>, Jane (<i>b</i>. 1690), and Fowke (<i>b</i>. 1700), were brought up. After 1688 he became the friend and associate of a group of London-based Scottish merchants led by David Nairn, James Campbell, and Thomas Coutts, whose prime business was the supply of clothing and victuals for the newly raised Scottish regiments. After Francis Beyer's dismissal from the East India Company in 1692, he seems to have gone into semi-retirement, but in 1693 he was involved in a venture with the same group of Scots to introduce baize cloth into Scotland, a joint-stock project approved by the Scottish parliament.<br>
<br>Together with other London Scots John Holland secured the necessary political backing in Scotland in 1695 to obtain an act of parliament setting up a bank in Scotland under the name of the Governor and Company of the Bank of Scotland. It was founded on joint-stock principles, with limited liability for shareholders and a nominal capital of &pound;100,000 sterling of which the initial trading capital was &pound;10,000. It was also given a monopoly over banking in Scotland for a period of twenty-one years. Holland was appointed first governor, and it opened for business in February 1696. From the beginning there were problems. A few months earlier the Scottish Company had been set up in direct opposition to the East India Company as a general trading and banking company with a paid-up capital of &pound;400,000 sterling. It moved into banking operations in Edinburgh and during the summer of 1696 nearly caused the collapse of the fledgeling bank. Holland's guidance, sagacity, and experience were vital ingredients in survival. It was in this context that he wrote and published the pamphlet <span class="italic">A short discourse on the present temper of the nation with respect to the India and Africa Company, and of the Bank of Scotland; also of Mr. Patterson's pretented fund of credit</span> (1696). At the general meeting in 1697 he stood down for two reasons: first, he was too closely associated with the East India Company; and second, the bank needed overt political protection in Scotland. This it found in the third earl of Leven, a professional soldier and governor of Edinburgh Castle. Thereafter Holland retired to Staffordshire, but in his writings and background advice helped to steer the bank through the difficulties of the next twenty years. In recognition of his many services the bank directors presented him with a silver cistern, which is mentioned in his will as a family heirloom  (<span class="roman">will</span>, TNA: PRO, PROB 11/585/96).<br>
<br>Holland died at Brewood Hall, Brewood, Staffordshire, on 30 November 1721 and was interred in the Fowke family vault in the parish church at Brewood. His will was proved on 4 May 1722. Jane, his wife, died on 24 December 1740, having been predeceased by all her children.<br>
<br>His son <a name="cosubject_13539"></a><span class="headword">Richard Holland</span>  (1688&#150;1730), <span class="occ">medical writer</span>, was born in London and educated at St Catharine's College, Cambridge, where he graduated BA in 1709, MA in 1712, and MD in 1723. He and his father drew up a scheme for the establishment of a bank in Ireland similar to that in Scotland, but the scheme was not taken up. Holland inherited an estate in Ashdown Forest, Sussex. He was admitted as a candidate of the College of Physicians on 25 June 1724, a fellow on 25 June 1725, and was censor in 1728. He was elected a fellow of the Royal Society on 30 November 1726. He wrote <span class="italic">Observations on the Small Pox, or, An Essay to Discover a More Effectual Method of Cure</span> (1728), to which John Chandler wrote an anonymous reply in 1729. Holland died, unmarried, at Shrewsbury, Shropshire, on 29 October 1730.<br>
