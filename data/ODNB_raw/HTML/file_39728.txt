<span class="headword">Costa,  Anthony Moses  da</span>  (1667<span class="mult">x</span>9&#150;1747), <span class="occ">merchant</span>, the eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/39727/', "Alvaro Jacob da Costa (1646&#150;1716)")</script>, also a merchant, and Leonor Mendes Guti&eacute;rres (1651&#150;1727), was born in Budge Row, in the City of London. He was baptized on 12 January 1679 at St Antholin, Budge Row, presumably because his father wished him to have the advantages of being a member of the established church. But he became a professing Jew. He was a member of the <i>mahamad</i> (governing body) of the Sephardi synagogue in Bevis Marks, 1720&#150;21. He had been its <i>gabay</i> (treasurer) in 1710, and was a <i>parnas</i> (warden) in 1716, 1720, and 1730. He was presiding warden in 1735 and was on the board of deputies in 1739. On 13 August 1698 he married his second cousin Catherine Mendes (1679&#150;1756) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/72024/', "Costa, Catherine da")</script>], the daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18553/', "Dr Fernando Moses Mendes (1647&#150;1724)")</script>, and they had six children. Catherine is reputed to have been born and baptized in Somerset House, where her father was body physician to Queen Catherine; although there is no documentary evidence that, as is asserted, the queen was her godmother, the infant is at the least likely to have been named after her, as this is the first time that anyone in the family was called Catherine.<br>
<br>Like his father, da Costa was in his day prominent in the East India trade and was also a leading figure in banking and commerce. He owned Bank of England stock, but was never, as used to be said, a director. He aligned himself firmly with Jewish interests on occasion. From 1713 to 1717 he was involved in gradually persuading the East India Company to relax its attitude to non-company diamond merchants (many of whom were Jews), and in 1735 he successfully protested, with five other firms (four of them Jewish), against the reimposition of higher import duties on coral going into Madras. In 1739 he was one of the <i>deputados</i> of the Spanish and Portuguese Jewish congregation who, albeit fruitlessly, prepared and presented a petition to the lord mayor and aldermen of the City asking for an increase in the number of sworn Sephardi brokers.<br>
<br>Besides engaging in the India trade, da Costa dealt in East India Company stock and was well known in the exchange and discount business. To his considerable cost he invested heavily in the South Sea Company. He could be litigious. In 1727 he applied for admission to the Russia Company (either because he was diversifying or because he wanted to bring a test case). Although there was no legal impediment to admitting a Jew, the company refused him entry&#151;as a Jew. Justifiably indignant, he published a brief account of the affair. The following year he took legal steps to force the company to admit him but was defeated, as the company successfully petitioned parliament to emend its charter to provide for exclusion on the grounds of religion. In 1736, when he, again probably with justice, considered himself unfairly treated in a financial matter, he again resorted to print to publicize the injustice. About 1730 he was, together with two other noted Jewish merchants, appointed commissioner for the new colony of Georgia; the three raised a fair sum of money, but instead of handing the money over to Lord Egmont and the other trustees, they spent it on sending out in 1733 forty emigrants, including two poor Ashkenazi families, of their own choice. By the time, a year later, that the trustees procured the surrender of their commissions, their prot&eacute;g&eacute;s had already landed in Savannah.<br>
<br>Da Costa lived in style in his house in Winchester Street, off London Wall, and in the house on Highgate Hill that he had inherited from his father in 1716. He died on 3 March 1747, his fortune much diminished, probably as a result of his speculations in the South Sea Company. He was buried the following day, in the Jewish burial-ground at Mile End, as his will requested.<br>
<br>Catherine da Costa is notable as the first Anglo-Jewish miniaturist. From 1712 to 1730 she was a pupil of Bernard Lens, royal miniaturist and drawing master to the royal children. There is a signed miniature by her of Mary Stuart (probably copied from one by Bernard Lens) in Ham House, Surrey. Miniatures by her on ivory of her little son Abraham and of a cousin are in the Jewish Museum, Albert Street, London, and a full-length portrait of her father in his doctoral robes is now in the synagogue of the Spanish and Portuguese Jewish congregation in Ashworth Road, London. While Voltaire was in London (1726&#150;8) to publish the <span class="italic">Henriade</span>, he became acquainted with Anthony and Catherine da Costa, and they both, together with six other members of the family, subscribed to the publication.<br>
