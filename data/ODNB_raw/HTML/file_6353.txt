<span class="headword">Corrigan, Sir  Dominic John</span>, first baronet  (1802&#150;1880), <span class="occ">physician</span>, was born in Thomas Street, Dublin, on 1 December 1802, the second son of John Corrigan, a well-known dealer in agricultural tools, and Celia O'Connor. At the age of ten Corrigan entered the lay college of St Patrick, Maynooth, where a local doctor, Talbot O'Kelly, kindled in the boy a passion for medicine. In 1820 he enrolled briefly in the school of physic in the University of Dublin (Trinity College), where he studied under professors Arthur Jacob, James Macartney, and John Crampton. During his time at Kirby's anatomy school in Peter Street (<i>c</i>.1820&#150;<i>c</i>.1821) he became an amateur grave robber whenever fresh cadavers were in short supply. In old age he recalled the excitement of nocturnal forays into the paupers' cemetery next to the Royal Hospital, Kilmainham, where he and a few fellow students would dig up the coffins of the recently interred, extract the bodies, remove the shroud, wrap the bodies in sheets, and haul them back to the school for dissection. (This preceded the <span class="roman">Anatomy Act</span> of 1832, which regulated the supply of bodies to dissecting academies.)<br>
<br>One of Corrigan's ablest contemporaries, William Stokes, encouraged him to pursue his medical studies at Edinburgh University, from which he took his medical degree along with Stokes in 1825, after writing a thesis on scrofula or tuberculosis. Once back in Dublin he began to climb the tall ladder of medical and social success. Keen to excel in a profession dominated by members of the protestant ascendancy, who guarded the higher rungs with sectarian zeal, Corrigan faced formidable obstacles. His humble social origins and Roman Catholic faith stamped him firmly as an outsider with neither money nor connection. Promotion, in other words, would depend entirely on hard work and marked ability. He opened a modest practice at 11 Upper Ormond Quay, where most of his patients were indigents or paupers who could not afford to pay his fees. Appointed physician to the Sick-Poor Institute of Meath Street in the Liberties, one of Dublin's worst slum areas, he decided to specialize in diseases of the heart and lungs. Among the more important papers he published in the 1830s, &#145;On permanent patency of the mouth of the aorta&#146;  (<span class="italic">Edinburgh Medical and Surgical Journal</span>, 37, April 1832, 225&#150;45) impressed doctors in London and on the continent. His work on heart murmurs, known then as <i>bruit de soufflet</i> and <i>fr&eacute;missement cataire</i>, palpitations, aneurysms, and aortic valvular impairment did not prevent him from studying the epidemic diseases arising out of severe malnutrition.<br>
<br>Slowly but surely Corrigan's career prospered. He accepted posts at the Meath Dispensary, the Cork Street Fever Hospital, and the Charitable Infirmary in Jervis Street. He also became a lecturer at the Peter Street medical school as well as the Dublin school of anatomy, surgery, and medicine in Digges Street, and Apothecaries' Hall. As his income and patient list grew he moved his consulting rooms from Ormond Quay to 13 Bachelor's Walk, and then in 1834 to elegant quarters at 4 Merrion Square West, where his neighbours included some of Dublin's leading families. On 2 June 1829 he married Joanna Woodlock, the daughter of a wealthy Dublin merchant. They had three sons and three daughters, only one of whom survived beyond 1882.<br>
<br>In 1839 Corrigan was appointed physician-in-ordinary to the lord lieutenant of Ireland and a year later physician to the House of Industry Hospital, a post he held until 1866. But he failed in 1841 to secure the coveted regius professorship of physic at Trinity College. Corrigan's combination of medical expertise, drive, and personal charm soon attracted patients from the top tiers of landed and professional society. Among the &eacute;lite who competed for his services were Lady Castlerosse, Lady Granard, and the marquess of Headfort. By the late 1850s he was earning well over &pound;4000 a year and this wealth enabled him to treat the poor and carry out research on heart and lung diseases as well as cholera.<br>
<br>If Corrigan's researches led to no major medical breakthroughs, his eagle eye and practical turn of mind, combined with years of treating patients of all kinds and conditions, enabled him to explain with unusual clarity such diseases as pulmonary fibrosis, cirrhosis of the lung, aortitis, and heart murmurs. At a time when anaesthesia and antiseptic procedures were unknown in Dublin's hospitals he explored the symptoms and causes of aortic valvular insufficiency or impairment, which came to be called Corrigan's pulse. This water-hammer pulsation of the brachial and radial arteries was described by a later authority as &#145;a jerky pulse with a full expansion, followed by a sudden collapse, occurring in aortic regurgitation&#146;  (<span class="italic">Dorland's Dictionary</span>, 1387). Following in the footsteps of Stokes, Corrigan promoted the use of the stethoscope. However, like other physicians of his day, he prescribed opium to relieve inflamed joints and leeches for victims of fever.<br>
<br>In the early 1840s Corrigan lectured and published papers on the close connection between famine and fever. As he observed in an 1846 pamphlet, &#145;if there be no famine, there will be no fever&#146;  (O'Brien, <span class="italic">Conscience</span>, 188). This argument proved more than prescient in view of the devastating effects of the blight or fungus that struck the Irish potato crop between 1845 and 1849. In 1846 he joined the newly created central board of health, which was trying to cope with the huge public health crisis that overwhelmed Ireland's medical as well as economic resources. His aversion to financial waste moved him to recommend that dispensary doctors hired to treat fever victims be paid only 5<i>s</i>. a day. But because these men risked serious illness or even death from contagion this board-approved fee struck both the medical establishment and the public as stingy. Corrigan soon became the object of much abuse from the public for this paltry pay and a senior colleague, Robert James Graves of the Meath Hospital, not only accused him of parsimony but also blocked his bid to become an honorary fellow of the King and Queen's College of Physicians in Ireland in 1847, despite his admission to the Royal College of Surgeons of England in 1843. It took Corrigan years to recover from this blow. Not until 1855 did he become a licentiate of the college; a year later he was elected a fellow.<br>
<br>In 1847 the whig government officially recognized Corrigan's services to public health by making him physician-in-ordinary to Queen Victoria in Ireland&#151;the first Catholic to be so honoured. Two years later Trinity College awarded him an honorary doctorate of medicine. He also served as a commissioner of lunatic asylums in Ireland from 1856 to 1868. In 1859, he reached the pinnacle of his career by becoming president of the College of Physicians&#151;a position to which he was re-elected for an unprecedented five years. Once again he was the first Catholic to hold this office. To his lasting credit Corrigan negotiated the purchase from the Kildare Street Club of the site on which the college built its imposing headquarters. The first official meeting of the college in its new premises was held on 5 July 1864. During his presidency it awarded fellowships to graduates of any medical school in the British Isles or Europe.<br>
<br>Corrigan's colleagues honoured him with a portrait by Catterson Smith and an imposing statue by the sculptor John Henry Foley. The latter was installed in the entrance hall of the college on 3 June 1869 before a crowd of devoted medical colleagues and friends that included William Stokes. Appointed a commissioner of national education in 1859, Corrigan served as president of the Royal Zoological Gardens and the Irish Pharmaceutical Society. In January 1866 the government conferred on him a baronetcy of the United Kingdom and in the same year he became consulting physician and joined the board of the House of Industry (Richmond Surgical) Hospital. For more than twenty years he served with distinction on the General Medical Council in London. In 1871 he accepted the vice-chancellorship of the Queen's University of Ireland, having served as a senator since the 1840s.<br>
<br>Elected to parliament in 1870 as member for Dublin City, Corrigan spent more time in London, espousing traditional Liberal ideas and devouring sumptuous dinners at the Reform Club. His advocacy of the early release of Fenian prisoners and promotion of secular education in universities alienated the Catholic hierarchy&#151;especially Cardinal Cullen. A true Christian, he attacked every form of sectarianism and dreamed of a national University of Ireland free from religious dogma and prejudice. But his ecumenical idealism had scant appeal, and once Gladstone's ambitious <span class="roman">Irish University Bill</span> of 1873 ran foul of religious zealots Corrigan decided to retire from parliament.<br>
<br>On the issue of female doctors Corrigan displayed some distinctly patriarchal prejudices. While he defended their right to attend medical school, he did not want women to practise medicine because he was convinced that such work would defeminize or &#145;unsex&#146; them. This outlook did not, however, prevent the College of Physicians from registering five women as licentiates in 1877. A champion of stricter regulation of both the medical and pharmaceutical professions, he also worked hard to purify Dublin's water supply, being fully cognizant of the link between dirty water and sickness.<br>
<br>As he grew older and gout made travel painful, Corrigan spent more time in his suburban house, Inniscorrig, Dalkey, south of Dublin. Despite a mild stroke in 1878 that left him partially paralysed, he continued to see patients. But a second stroke at the end of December 1879 left him permanently disabled. Nursed by his wife and children during his final illness he died in his Merrion Square house on 1 February 1880. His funeral proved one of the biggest seen hitherto in the city. Following a service attended by hundreds of admiring patients, friends, and colleagues, he was buried in the family vault in St Andrew's Church, Westland Row, Dublin, on 5 February.<br>
<br>Noted for his ambition, compassion, and cheerful bedside manner, Corrigan also earned professional respect for his work on aortic inadequacy, heart murmurs, pulmonary fibrosis, and bronchial dilatation. A liberal in church&#150;state relations and education, he opened wider the doors of his profession to fellow Catholics who were born without the privileges of the Colles, Cramptons, Graves, Smylys, Stokes, and other members of the Dublin medical establishment. With the death of his eldest grandson, John Joseph Corrigan (1859&#150;1883), the baronetcy became extinct, but his name survives, emblazoned on the Beaumont Hospital in north Dublin; while visitors to the Royal College of Physicians on Kildare Street can still see his handsome features carved in marble and painted in oil in the elegant rooms that arose under his presidency.<br>
