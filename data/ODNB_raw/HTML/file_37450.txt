<div class="para">
<span class="headword">George,  Walter Goodall</span>  (1858&#150;1943), <span class="occ">athlete</span>, was born on 9 September 1858 at the Market Place, Calne, Wiltshire, the second of the seven children of Frederick Benjamin George, chemist and druggist, of Calne, Wiltshire, and his wife, Elizabeth Smith. In 1874, aged fifteen, George became &#145;apprenticed to chemistry&#146; at the Worcestershire sauce firm of Lea and Perrins, where he was often obliged to work a fourteen-hour day. He grew up to a lithe 5 feet 11&frac14; inches and 10&frac12; stone. His earliest sporting interests were as a co-founder of the Worcester Rugby Football Club and as a penny-farthing cyclist in 1876. In 1878 he became the joint winner in Birmingham of a handicap walking race over 1 mile with a 45 yard handicap.<br>
<br>At this time the fastest anyone had yet covered the English mile distance had been set by the Welsh professional runner William Richards, at 4 min. 17&frac14; sec. in Manchester on 19 August 1865. On 1 June 1878 the nineteen-year-old George wrote down his thoughts on how some 10 yards a lap (5.7 seconds of the total time) could be knocked off the then world standard. He proclaimed his plan to much mirth. The deed, he said, could be done with laps of 59, 63, 66, and 64 seconds. Remarkably, more than seven years later he ran laps of 58&frac12;, 63&frac12;, 65&frac34;, and 66 seconds at Lillie Bridge, London, on 23 August 1886 to establish a world's best time of 4 min. 12&frac34; sec., which was unbeaten anywhere for the next twenty-eight seasons and was unbeaten by a Briton for forty-nine years, until Sydney Wooderson returned 4 min. 12.7 seconds, running in Glasgow on 3 August 1935.<br>
<br>George won the English championship for the mile and the 4 miles in 1879 and the same distances at the inaugural <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/92495', "Amateur Athletic Association (AAA)")</script> championships at the Lillie Bridge grounds, West Brompton, London, which were open to the world in the following year. In 1882 at Stoke-on-Trent and in 1884 at Aston, Birmingham, he performed the feat of taking the &frac12; mile, 1 mile, 4 mile, and 10 mile championships. His dominance was such that few dared challenge him. In 1882 his 4 mile title was a walkover, and in both his &frac12; mile and 10 mile triumphs in 1884 there was only one other finisher.<br>
<br>George was a moderate smoker and his favourite meal before a race was a glass of beer and a hunk of bread and cheese. He was, however, often racked by asthma and suffered much from hay fever. He became unbeatable over the middle distances in an era before training became scientific. One of his training runs over a mile was timed at 4 min. 9.8 sec. but the absence of opposition and official timekeepers rendered the mark unofficial. He won more than 1000 cups and prizes as an amateur, setting records ranging from 1000 yards (in 2 min. 18 sec.) to 12 miles. Additionally he won the English national cross-country title in 1882, 1883, and 1884 in the colours of Moreley Harriers.<br>
<br>George resigned from the harriers and turned professional in 1886. He was thus able to confront over a mile the leading pedestrian of the Victorian age&#151;William Jeffrey Cummings (1858&#150;1919) of Paisley, Renfrewshire. The police, who were overwhelmed, estimated that 30,000 people converged on the red-brick dust track at Lillie Bridge, West Brompton, London, to bet on the outcome of the gladiatorial duel between George and Cummings. Only after he finished in his world's best time of 4 min. 12&frac34; sec. did George learn that the tenacious Scot had collapsed 60 yards from the tape and had fallen on the grass infield. Because he recorded this time as a professional, it was not recognized by the governing bodies of the sport. George made five journeys to the United States, both as an amateur and as a professional, and proved himself to be the world's greatest middle-distance runner, so starting a British tradition which was continued by Wooderson, Roger Bannister, Derek Ibbotson, Steve Ovett, Sebastian Coe, and Steve Cram. George also pioneered the &#145;100-up&#146; athletic training exercise, on which he published a short book in 1913.<br>
<br>At St Nicholas's Church, Worcester, on 11 October 1887, George married Ada Annie, younger daughter of George Grainger, the proprietor of the Royal Worcester porcelain works. In the early inter-war years he worked as a park-keeper and groundsman in south London. He received some financial support during hard times from sports journalists. The senior officials of the AAA revered his achievements, but felt inhibited by the strict amateur code of the day from offering more formal and practical recognition to one who had joined the ranks of the professionals. Only his local club, Mitcham athletics club, afforded him true celebrity status. George died at the age of eighty-four, at his home, 21 Frimley Gardens, Mitcham, Surrey, on 4 June 1943, with Ada George, his wife of fifty-five years, by his side. They had one daughter and a son, Walter Gordon, who was shot dead in an industrial fracas in San Francisco in March 1932.<br>
