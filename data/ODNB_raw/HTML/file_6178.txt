<span class="headword">Cooke,  Roger</span>  (<em>b. </em>1552, <em>d.</em> after 1612?), <span class="occ">alchemist</span>, was born on 1 February 1552. In 1567, at the age of fourteen, he became an assistant to John Dee, with whom he lived for the next fourteen years. Most of the little that is known about Cooke is derived from the diary of John Dee. Cooke seems to have assisted Dee in his alchemical experiments, and may have scryed (crystal gazed) for him. On 28 December 1579 Dee revealed an alchemical secret to Cooke, but on 12 July 1581, when Cooke was not invited to witness an alchemical experiment, they argued. On 5 September Cooke asked Dee's permission to leave him; he departed two days later. Dee describes Cooke as of a melancholy nature, and sought to rectify the ill sentiment between them by promising Cooke &pound;100 as soon as he could afford it, as well as &#145;some pretty alchemical experiments, wheruppon he might honestly live&#146;  (<span class="italic">Private Diary</span>, 13).<br>
<br>No records of Cooke's life for the two decades after he left Dee have been located, though he seems to have had some association with Francis Anthony, the London medical practitioner and alchemist. On 30 September 1600 Cooke returned to Dee, &#145;offred and promised his faithfull and diligent care and help, to the best of his skill and powre, in the processes chymicall, and that he will rather do so then to be with any in England&#146;  (<span class="italic">Private Diary</span>, 63). Dee agreed, and on 1 November Cooke began his distillations. The reconciliation was short-lived, however, and on 2 February 1601 Dee's son, Arthur, discovered that Cooke was plotting against Dee; despite a series of further reconciliations, Cooke departed for London on 2 March of that year.<br>
<br>This is probably the same Roger Cooke who was employed by <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21939/', "Henry Percy")</script>, &#145;the Wizard Earl&#146;, in building and running a still house in the Tower between 1606 and at least 1609. He might also be the Roger Cooke who assisted the experiments of Cornelis Drebbel at the court of Rudolf II and returned to England late in 1612. He seems not to have written anything, and nothing is known about his death.<br>
