<span class="headword">Campbell,  Judy Mary</span>  (1916&#150;2004), <span class="occ">actress</span>, was born at 7 Welby Gardens, Grantham, Lincolnshire, on 31 May 1916. Originally named Mary Campbell, she was the daughter of John Arthur Campbell, formerly Gamble (1877&#150;1947), playwright and theatre owner, and his wife, Mary Alice, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Worger (1879&#150;1960), the actress Mary Fulton. After boarding-school education at St Michael's Convent, East Grinstead, Sussex, her first (albeit tiny) stage role was at the Theatre Royal, Grantham, in 1935, in <span class="italic">The Last of Mrs Cheyney</span>. Like many of her generation she went on to acquire considerable experience in provincial repertory theatre, notably in Coventry, Brighton, Cambridge (where she played in Shaw and Shakespeare), and Liverpool, where she joined the Playhouse Company as leading lady between 1939 and 1940. She also appeared in brief runs at the People's Palace, east London, and at the Savoy in 1937.<br>
<br>The turning point in the career of the tall, elegant, auburn-haired Campbell came in the revue <span class="italic">New Faces</span> (1940), in which she was to have performed a Dorothy Parker monologue, which failed to arrive in time. Instead, standing in a white ball gown and feather boa, in the moonlit-park setting of the Comedy Theatre's stage, she sang Eric Maschwitz's &#145;A Nightingale Sang in Berkeley Square&#146;. Apprehensive about singing in public, and having no formal training, she confided the song's romantic lyrics to the rapt audience in a husky half-whisper. The occasion passed into theatrical legend, abetted by No&euml;l Coward's ambiguous compliment, &#145;It takes talent to put over a song when you haven't got a voice&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 8 June 2004). Coward went on to reward her with starring roles in several of his plays. She was the stoically enduring Ethel Gibbons in the between-wars comedy&#150;drama <span class="italic">This Happy Breed</span>, a stylish Joanna in <span class="italic">Present Laughter</span> (&#145;effective vamping&#146;, said the <span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span>) and the mischievous ghost Elvira in <span class="italic">Blithe Spirit</span>. She toured in all three with Coward in 1942 before reprising them in London the next year. On 9 November 1943 she married David Leslie Birkin (1914&#150;1991), then a lieutenant and later a lieutenant-commander in the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve, and the son of Harry Lawrence Birkin, lace manufacturer. They had a son and two daughters.<br>
<br>Judy Campbell continued her association with Coward's plays after the war. In 1951 she played a glamorous film star who suppresses her humble origins in Coward's <span class="italic">Relative Values</span>, and a couple of decades later she played his greatest female character, the monstrous charmer Judith Bliss in <span class="italic">Hay Fever</span>, for the Cambridge Theatre Company. But her range went well beyond Coward. She was especially effective in Shaw, playing a memorable Hesione Hushabye in <span class="italic">Heartbreak House</span> (1961, at the Oxford Playhouse, then at Wyndham's, London) and Mrs Clandon in <span class="italic">You Never Can Tell</span> (1966), at the Haymarket. More surprisingly still, she played dangerous Christine Mannon in Eugene O'Neill's <span class="italic">Mourning Becomes Electra</span> in 1967 at the Arts, London (&#145;dispensing malice with an offhand flourish&#146;, as the <span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span> reviewer said), and Linda in <span class="italic">Death of a Salesman</span> (1983, Chichester). She was not averse to subduing her beauty for roles like those of the sorely tried, cardigan-wearing housewives Linda Loman and Ethel Gibbons (&#145;an extraordinarily honest piece of acting&#146;, wrote the <span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span> reviewer of the latter role).<br>
<br>Campbell played several <i>grandes dames</i> in later years, including in the Chichester revival of <span class="italic">The Sleeping Prince</span> (1983), in which her Grand Duchess was the highlight of a lacklustre production of a thin play. In 2001 she played Grand'm&egrave;re in Harold Pinter's adaptation of <span class="italic">Remembrance of Times Past</span> at the National Theatre, London, and in the year before she died she appeared at the Jermyn Street Theatre, accompanied by the pianist Stefan Bednarczyk, in a musical entertainment of her own devising, called <span class="italic">Where Are the Songs We Sang?</span> She also wrote two plays, <span class="italic">Sing Cuckoo</span> (1950) and <span class="italic">The Bright One</span> (1958). The latter not altogether happily mixed Greek mythology and romantic comedy, but, as directed by Rex Harrison, it showcased luminous performances from Kay Kendall, just before her death, and Gladys Cooper.<br>
<br>Films were undoubtedly secondary to Campbell's stage work but she appeared in nine features, including two for Ealing in 1940: an entertaining mystery, <span class="italic">Saloon Bar</span>, in which she played a tartly spoken barmaid, and a war film, <span class="italic">Convoy</span>, as the estranged wife of a naval commander (Clive Brook). She did not enjoy the latter, in which the director, Pen Tennyson, &#145;made her play her scenes in carpet slippers, in order to reduce her height relative to that of the male lead&#146;  (Sweet, 174). In the thriller <span class="italic">East of Piccadilly</span> (1941) she showed spirit and charm as a crime reporter who enjoys a wise-cracking rapport with Sebastian Shaw, and her comedy flair served her well in <span class="italic">Breach of Promise</span> (1941), again in a tricky relationship with Brook. David Farrar, her co-star in the amnesia drama <span class="italic">The World Owes Me a Living</span> (1944), decades later recalled her as &#145;a grand actress and a lovable person&#146;  (McFarlane, <span class="italic">British Cinema</span>, 184). Her best film was Sidney Gilliat's witty hospital-set thriller <span class="italic">Green for Danger</span> (1946), in which the murderer dispatches her too early, and her worst (through no fault of hers) was the lamentable mess <span class="italic">Bonnie Prince Charlie</span> (1948), after which she did not film for over twenty years. In its profligate way with strikingly beautiful women, British cinema never made the most of Campbell. There was plenty of television, however, including appearances in <span class="italic">Hadleigh</span> (1971), <span class="italic">Anna Karenina</span> (1985, as Vronsky's mother), <span class="italic">Inspector Morse</span> (1987), <span class="italic">Bergerac</span> (1991), and finally as Aunt Ann in <span class="italic">The Forsyte Saga</span> (2002). A true star, she made her presence intelligently felt even in small television roles.<br>
<br>Campbell famously took a hot-air balloon ride over Paris for her eighty-fifth birthday and was by all accounts a woman of great charm and good humour. Her family life was very important to her and she became a graceful showbusiness matriarch. Her son, Andrew Birkin, was a director and screenwriter who cast his mother as the star of his Saki-derived short film <span class="italic">Sredni Vashtar</span> (1981); her daughters were the singer and actress Jane Birkin and the artist Linda Jephson. Willowy and elegant to the end, Judy Campbell died at the Lister Hospital, Westminster, on 6 June 2004, of pneumonia, and was cremated on 18 June. She was survived by her three children.<br>
