<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Oglethorpe,  James Edward</span>  (1696&#150;1785), <span class="occ">army officer and founder of the colony of Georgia</span>, was born in London on 22 December 1696, the third and youngest surviving son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20618/', "Sir Theophilus Oglethorpe (1650&#150;1702)")</script>, politician and army officer, and his wife, Eleanor, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Wall (1662&#150;1732), and was baptized the following day at St Martin-in-the-Fields. The strong Jacobite sympathies of his parents, but especially of his mother, would cast a shadow over his career well into his middle age.<h2>
<a name="Earlycareer17071730"></a>Early career, 1707&#150;1730</h2>In 1707, following a long-established family tradition of military service, James Edward, or &#145;Jemmy&#146; as he was known at home, enlisted in Queen Anne's 1st regiment of foot guards and in 1713 was commissioned as a lieutenant. The following year he matriculated from Corpus Christi College, Oxford. In 1715, possibly on his own initiative or perhaps acting on the advice of his mother, who did not wish her son to be jeopardized by her overt support for the Pretender, Oglethorpe resigned his army commission and left England for France. Upon his arrival in Paris he enrolled as a student in the academy of Lompres. One of his fellow students, James Francis Edward Keith, like Oglethorpe from a family with staunch Jacobite connections, became a lifelong friend and ally. War between the Austrian empire and the Turks offered Oglethorpe and Keith an opportunity to experience active military service, and in 1716 they enlisted as volunteers in the imperial army commanded by Prince Eugene of Savoy. By the time Belgrade surrendered in 1717 Oglethorpe, who had distinguished himself at the battle of Petrovaradin (1716) and the siege of Timisora (1716), had been promoted by Prince Eugene to the rank of lieutenant-colonel. In 1718 he saw further action in Sicily. He could have remained in the imperial army but in 1719 chose instead to return to England.<br>
<br>Oglethorpe's hopes of a commission in the British army were quickly dashed. Neither Prince Eugene's strong recommendation nor Oglethorpe's distinguished military record could compensate for the taint of Jacobitism that attached to his family's name. In June 1719, with his military career seemingly at an end, he returned briefly to Corpus Christi College. Little is known about his time there, and he left without taking his degree.<br>
<br>In 1722 Oglethorpe's life took a new and unanticipated turn when he returned from Europe to manage the affairs of his expatriate brother Theophilus Oglethorpe (<i>bap</i>. 1684, <i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1737). Like his father and brother Lewis before him, Theophilus had sat as the MP for Haslemere in Surrey. The Oglethorpe family assumed that James, in his turn, would occupy the seat, and such was their influence in the constituency that he was returned with a minimum of opposition. He held the seat until 1754.<br>
<br>The first few years of Oglethorpe's parliamentary career were largely unexceptional, but in 1728 an event occurred which quickly catapulted him into a position of national prominence. Robert Castell, a good friend of Oglethorpe's, fell into debt and was incarcerated in the notorious Fleet prison. Because he was so penurious that he could not afford to bribe the guards into giving him better living conditions, he contracted smallpox and died. Castell's death, and the unmitigated squalor of the Fleet and the other gaols in which debtors were imprisoned, horrified Oglethorpe and spurred him to action. In 1729 he persuaded the House of Commons to appoint a committee, to be chaired by him, which would prepare a detailed report on the conditions in English prisons.<h2>
<a name="TheGeorgiaproject17301742"></a>The Georgia project, 1730&#150;1742</h2>Oglethorpe quickly developed a close understanding, and an excellent working relationship, with one of his colleagues on the gaols committee, Sir John Perceval, later first earl of Egmont. By 1730 Oglethorpe had formulated a far more ambitious scheme than that of prison reform. Perceval, who proved to be most receptive to his plan, was one of the first people to whom Oglethorpe revealed his proposal to establish a new American colony.<br>
<br>In some ways Oglethorpe's proposal was very traditional. Ever since the sixteenth century, a central strand in &eacute;lite English thinking about colonization had been that colonies offered England the opportunity to rid itself of the unemployed and the unemployable&#151;those who were both a drain on, and a potential social and moral threat to, society as a whole. The abundant resources of the New World would provide such people with every opportunity to improve themselves materially and, through their work, with the prospect of moral and social redemption. This was the essence of the plan Oglethorpe mooted to Perceval in 1730, a plan he believed would receive the enthusiastic backing of politicians and churchmen, as well as those merchants and manufacturers who stood to benefit from the commercial opportunities presented by a new colony.<br>
<br>In 1730 Oglethorpe had not finalized the exact location of his proposed colony, but, as his plan began to take shape, he realized the practical advantages of selecting a site in the region to the south of the Savannah River. Spain, with its heavily fortified presence in northern Florida, presented a serious threat to South Carolina's burgeoning rice economy. Oglethorpe reasoned that South Carolina's, and thereby England's, interests could be served by establishing a military buffer in these disputed borderlands. The House of Commons, he anticipated, would willingly support a colony which not only served this purpose but would also do so comparatively cheaply. The settlers of this new colony would function as soldier-farmers. They would be South Carolina's first line of defence. Between 1730 and 1732 Oglethorpe, ably assisted by Perceval, embarked on an ambitious campaign to promote his scheme. Oglethorpe was responsible for the earliest literary contribution to that campaign, an unpublished piece entitled &#145;Some accounts of the design of the trustees for establishing colonys in America&#146;. This detailed analysis of the rationale for the founding of a new colony, and the precise form it would take, seems to have been written between late 1730 and the spring of 1731. Benjamin Martyn, later appointed to serve as the Georgia trustees' secretary, drew heavily on Oglethorpe's work for his <span class="italic">Some Account of the Designs of the Trustees for Establishing the Colony of Georgia in America</span> (1732) and <span class="italic">Reasons for Establishing the Colony of Georgia in America</span> (1733). As part of the continuing effort to secure support for Georgia, Oglethorpe wrote <span class="italic">A New and Accurate Account of the Provinces of South-Carolina and Georgia</span>, which was published in London in 1733. By June 1732 Oglethorpe and Perceval were ready to implement their plan. They, together with some of the parliamentarians, churchmen, and merchants subsequently known as the trustees, who were actively prepared to support their scheme, successfully petitioned the crown for a charter which authorized them to found their colony in the region between the Savannah and Altamaha rivers [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/95206', "Trustees for establishing the colony of Georgia in America")</script>]. In October 1732 Oglethorpe accompanied the first embarkation of settlers to Georgia, and for the next decade he played a decisive and highly controversial role in virtually every aspect of life in the colony. The paternalistic, if not authoritarian, attitude he displayed towards the early settlers, and his refusal to brook any criticism, produced mixed results. On the one hand his firmness, combined with his seemingly unflagging energy, was instrumental in securing the colony's survival during the initial years of settlement. At the same time his often inappropriate choice of men to serve as local officials, and his uncritical loyalty to them, stirred up a great deal of discontent.<br>
<br>By the mid-1730s the trustees, and Oglethorpe in particular, were being blamed by a growing number of colonists, and their allies in South Carolina, for a policy which they believed was stunting Georgia's economic development and thereby thwarting their own economic aspirations: the prohibition of black slavery. Oglethorpe and his colleagues on the Georgia board had not begun their venture with a view to excluding slavery, but Oglethorpe soon became convinced that their intentions for the colony were incompatible with chattel slavery. His uncompromising opposition to slavery was based more on pragmatism than it was on ideological objections to that institution.<br>
<br>Having seen South Carolina's slave system at first hand Oglethorpe was quickly persuaded that slavery would jeopardize Georgia's role as a military buffer. Enslaved Africans, he surmised, would not hesitate to do all in their power to assist the Spaniards if by that means they could secure their own liberation. Georgia, moreover, had not been founded with a view to replicating, and thereby competing with, South Carolina's rice economy. The subtropical commodities, the silk and the wine, which the trustees insisted would form the backbone of Georgia's economy, were not seen as necessitating the employment of enslaved workers. Finally, Oglethorpe was utterly convinced that the use of slaves would have a highly detrimental effect on the manners and morality of Georgia's white inhabitants. For all of these reasons he urged the other trustees to press for parliamentary legislation outlawing slavery in Georgia. In 1735 the House of Commons enacted the law sought by the Georgia board.<br>
<br>During the late 1730s the prohibition of slavery generated an increasingly bitter debate. The pro-slavery group of Georgia settlers and their South Carolinian backers managed to secure potentially powerful support in the House of Commons. While Oglethorpe remained in Georgia, effectively ensuring the continuation of the ban, Perceval marshalled the trustees' defences in London. Oglethorpe's victory over the Spaniards at the battle of Bloody Marsh (1742), together with his return to England in the following year, marked the beginning of the end of the prohibition. By 1747 the trustees had all but conceded defeat in their campaign to exclude slavery from Georgia, and three years later they reluctantly agreed to ask parliament to repeal the legislation of 1735.<h2>
<a name="Militarylife17361758"></a>Military life, 1736&#150;1758</h2>Oglethorpe may have made errors in his political judgements and in his civil administration of Georgia, but his military contribution was of the very highest order and significance. It was he who was mainly responsible for ensuring that Georgia successfully filled its designated military function. The trustees had always known that Spain would not take kindly to this English intrusion into the southern borderlands, and in 1736 a Spanish invasion seemed imminent. Oglethorpe cleverly bluffed the Spaniards into overestimating his firepower and, for the time being, postponed an assault which might have dislodged the English. Oglethorpe had bought the time he needed to build up Georgia's defences, and he returned to England to try to impress upon the House of Commons the urgency of providing troops to serve under his command in America. Parliament proved unwilling to supply regular soldiers, but authorized Oglethorpe to raise a volunteer regiment. In September 1738 he and his force of 600 men landed in Georgia. The war that Oglethorpe anticipated did not come for another year.<br>
<br>In the autumn of 1739 Britain declared war on Spain, and Oglethorpe was ordered to do all he could to harry the Spanish forces based in the Florida port of St Augustine. In May 1740 he hatched what proved to be an overly ambitious plan to take St Augustine. Within a month he was forced to concede defeat. The lack of wholehearted support from South Carolina, sickness in his army, and desertions left him with no realistic alternative but to withdraw the remnants of his forces back to the comparative safety of Georgia.<br>
<br>Two years later Oglethorpe found himself on the defensive when the Spaniards launched an all-out attack on Georgia. In what was to be a defining point in Anglo-Spanish relations in the southern borderlands, he repelled the Spanish forces at the battle of Bloody Marsh. His stunning victory meant that for the foreseeable future Georgia, and thereby South Carolina, were secure against the possibility of Spanish invasion. In 1743, in acknowledgement of his military achievements in America, Oglethorpe was formally accorded the rank of brigadier-general. He returned to England in 1743 to try to persuade the Pelham ministry to continue funding Georgia. He had left the colony with every intention of returning, but events conspired to ensure that he would spend the rest of his life in Europe.<br>
<br>On 15 September 1745, at the age of nearly forty-nine, and after a comparatively short courtship, Oglethorpe married the 31-year-old Elizabeth Wright (<i>d</i>. 1787), the only surviving daughter and wealthy heiress of Sir Nathan Wright. Whatever her other attractions, Elizabeth's wealth replenished Oglethorpe's much depleted purse. The newly-weds settled at Elizabeth's family home, Cranham Hall in Essex, where they lived more than comfortably on the &pound;1500 per annum she brought to the marriage. The couple had no children. If marriage detained Oglethorpe in England, then so did the Jacobite rebellion of 1745, an event which once more raised questions about the political loyalties of the Oglethorpe family. Oglethorpe, at the head of the troops he had raised for the defence of Georgia, was ordered to join General Wade at Hull. He and his regiment were afterwards transferred to the command of the duke of Cumberland, then in hot pursuit of the retreating Jacobite forces.<br>
<br>In December 1745 the duke of Cumberland alleged that Oglethorpe had been tardy in his harassment of the rebels and, without any firm evidence to support his charges, implied that this was because of his sympathy for the Jacobite cause. Oglethorpe, who at no point in his life had expressed any overt support for the Stuarts, was court-martialled. Although he was acquitted, his military career in both England and America had been effectively ended. After 1745 he ceased to play an active role in Georgia affairs. For the next nine years he remained MP for Haslemere, but lost his seat in 1754. In 1755 he sought to reactivate his Georgia regiment for service in America, but his application to the ministry was turned down.<br>
<br>Oglethorpe's keen desire to resume his military career, which may have reflected the boredom of his life as a country gentleman and the loss of his parliamentary seat, was satisfied, but in continental Europe rather than in America. He ended his military career as he had begun it: serving alongside his friend James Keith. By 1755 Keith had attained the rank of field marshal in Frederick the Great's army. Oglethorpe was with Keith when he died at the battle of Hochkirk (1758).<h2>
<a name="Retirement17581785"></a>Retirement, 1758&#150;1785</h2>By now in his mid-sixties, Oglethorpe returned to England in 1760 and lived there for the remainder of his long life. He seems to have divided his time between Cranham and London. While he no longer took any active role in public life, he did become something of a celebrity in London society. His long and varied career, and his apparently jaunty personality, secured for him a wide circle of friends and associates, including Samuel Johnson, James Boswell, and Hannah More. Oglethorpe had been one of the &#145;warmest patrons&#146; of Johnson's <span class="italic">London</span> (1738), and at one point Johnson intimated that he wished to write a biography of Oglethorpe, but the volume never materialized. Both Boswell and Johnson appear to have thought highly of a man who was said to have an &#145;uncommon vivacity&#146; and &#145;variety of knowledge&#146; which made his conversation both stimulating and sometimes &#145;desultory&#146;  (Boswell, 92, 756). Oglethorpe, who had enjoyed excellent health throughout his life, died of natural causes at Cranham on 1 July 1785, and was buried in the parish church there.<br>
