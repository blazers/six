<span class="headword">Nicholson, Sir  Charles</span>, first baronet  (1808&#150;1903), <span class="occ">educationist and politician</span>, was born in Cockermouth, Cumberland, on 23 November 1808. He was the only surviving child of Charles Nicholson of London, merchant and agent to Lord Egremont, and Barbara, youngest daughter of John Ascough of Bedale.<br>
<br>After graduating MD at Edinburgh University in 1833, Nicholson emigrated to Australia, and settled on some property belonging to his uncle near Sydney in May 1834. Here for some time he practised as a physician. He was also a successful businessman, buying land and stock and forming sheep stations. A good classical scholar, well read in history and science, an able writer, and a lucid speaker, he soon became prominently identified with the social and political interests of the colony. In June 1843 he was returned to the first legislative council of New South Wales as one of the five members for the Port Phillip district (later the state of Victoria). In July 1848, and again in September 1851, he was elected member for the county of Argyle. From 2 May 1844 to 19 May 1846 he was chairman of committees of the legislative council. In 1846 he was chosen speaker. He was twice re-elected and retained the office until the grant to the colony of responsible government in 1855&#150;6, when he became for a short time a member of the executive council. When in 1859 the district of Moreton Bay was separated from New South Wales and formed into the colony of Queensland, Nicholson was nominated on 1 May 1860 a member of the legislative council of the new colony, and was president during the first session, resigning the office on 28 August 1860.<br>
<br>Nicholson was from the first a powerful advocate of popular education in New South Wales. He was a member of the select committee to inquire into the state of education in the colony moved for by Robert Lowe and appointed in June 1844. His name, however, is more closely associated with the foundation of the University of Sydney. In December 1850 he was nominated to the original senate of the university. He was a generous donor to its funds, and endowed it with many valuable gifts, including the museum of Egyptian, Etruscan, Greek, and Roman antiquities, which he collected with much personal exertion and at considerable cost. Between 1856 and 1859 he visited England to raise funds for the university. He was instrumental in obtaining a grant of arms from the Heralds' College in 1857, and the royal charter from Queen Victoria in 1858. On 3 March 1851 he was unanimously elected vice-provost, and delivered an inaugural address at the opening of the university on 11 October 1852. He was chancellor from 13 March 1854 until 1862, when he left Australia permanently for England.<br>
<br>Nicholson was knighted by patent on 1 March 1852, and was the first Australian to be created a baronet (of Luddenham, NSW, on 8 April 1859). He was made honorary DCL of Oxford in 1857, honorary LLD of Cambridge in 1868, and honorary LLD of Edinburgh in 1886. He married, on 8 August 1865, Sarah Elizabeth, eldest daughter of Archibald Keightley, registrar of the Charterhouse, London. They had three sons of whom the eldest, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35225/', "Charles Archibald Nicholson")</script>, succeeded to the baronetcy and the youngest, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35231/', "Sir Sydney Hugo Nicholson")</script>, founded the Royal School of Church Music. After his return to England, Nicholson chiefly resided in Hadleigh, Essex, actively occupied as a magistrate, as chairman of the Liverpool, London, and Globe Insurance Company, and as director of other undertakings. He was a leading member of the Royal Colonial Institute, the Royal Society of Arts, and the British Association. He continued to pursue Egyptian, classical, and Hebrew scholarship. Preserving his vigour until the end, he died on 8 November 1903 at his residence, The Grange, Totteridge, near Barnet, Hertfordshire, and was buried in Totteridge churchyard.<br>
