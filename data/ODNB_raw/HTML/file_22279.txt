<span class="headword">Pilkington,  Robert</span>  (1765&#150;1834), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, the son of Robert Pilkington and his wife, Grace, was born at Chelsfield, Kent, on 7 November 1765. After attending the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, he was commissioned second lieutenant, Royal Artillery, on 27 August 1787. He was transferred to the Royal Engineers on 5 June 1789, embarked for Canada in July 1790, and was stationed at Quebec. He was promoted first lieutenant on 16 January 1793, captain-lieutenant on 3 June 1797, and captain on 18 April 1801. He was active at Newark (Niagara on the Lake) and York (Toronto), and in 1794 he established a fortified post on the River Miamis. His engineering expertise was much in demand, and in addition to his military work, he became involved in various civil projects, and made maps.<br>
<br>Pilkington acquired a large landholding in Upper Canada, so though he left in autumn 1802 and never returned, he maintained an interest in the county. As an absentee landlord he enticed gullible emigrants from Northamptonshire and Warwickshire to his Pilkington township, then undeveloped: &#145;most died cursing Pilkington for the impossible position in which he had placed them&#146;  (<span class="italic">DCB</span>).<br>
<br>Back in England in 1803 Pilkington was again stationed in the southern district; and in May he was transferred for special service to the government gunpowder factory at Waltham Abbey, Essex. Pilkington was promoted regimental lieutenant-colonel on 24 June 1809. Two months later he accompanied the disastrous Walcheren expedition as commanding engineer in one of the divisions under the earl of Chatham. He participated in the siege and capture of Flushing, where he was wounded, and in the operations under lieutenant-generals Sir Eyre Coote and Sir George Don. Before the evacuation of the army in November and December 1809 he was entrusted with the destruction of the basin, arsenal, and sea defences of Flushing; Captain Moore and 600 men of the Royal Navy were employed under his orders. In his dispatch Sir George Don gave great credit to Pilkington for the skill with which the operations were carried out.<br>
<br>Pilkington returned to England in January 1810, and was stationed first at Woolwich and later at Weedon, where he superintended the erection of the large ordnance stores, gunpowder magazines, and barracks. On 15 October, at Devizes, Wiltshire, he married Hannah, daughter of John Tylie; they had four daughters and one surviving son. In May 1815 Pilkington was appointed commanding royal engineer (CRE) of the north-western district; and on 1 December 1815 he was promoted regimental colonel.<br>
<br>In October 1818 Pilkington was appointed CRE at Gibraltar, where he remained for twelve years, and where he was promoted major-general on 27 May 1825. He was appointed a colonel commandant of the Royal Engineers on 28 March 1830, after his return to England; and he succeeded General Sir A. Bryce as inspector-general of fortifications on 24 October 1832. Pilkington died at Craven Hill, Bayswater, London, on 6 July 1834.<br>
