<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Bing, Sir  Rudolf Franz Joseph</span>  (1902&#150;1997), <span class="occ">opera manager</span>, was born in Vienna on 9 January 1902, the son of Ernst Hoenigsvald Bing, head of the Austro-Hungarian Steel and Iron Trust, and his wife, Stefanie. The youngest of four children, he left school at the age of sixteen. He trained his attractive light baritone voice, but did not consider becoming a professional. In 1919 he obtained a job with the Viennese booksellers Gilhofer and Ranschburg. A year later he moved to Hugo Heller's bookshop, which also ran a concert agency, and Bing was soon working on that side of the business. In 1923 the Heller agency moved to larger premises and began dealing with operatic as well as concert artists. Bing managed two concerts given by the British tenor Alfred Piccaver at the Albert Hall, London. He left Vienna in 1927 for Berlin, where he married the Russian dancer Nina Schelemskaya-Schelesnaya in the same year and met the great German actor Carl Ebert, who was retiring from the stage to take up direction.<br>
<br>In 1928 Ebert became general manager of the Hessisches Staatstheater, Darmstadt, and Bing was appointed his assistant. &#145;The techniques of organising I acquired in Darmstadt stood me in good stead all my life&#146;, he wrote later  (Bing, 23). Bing spent two fruitful years in Darmstadt, where Karl B&ouml;hm was musical director and Max Rudolf the second conductor, but he found the small town frustrating, so in 1930 he moved back to Berlin, where he worked for six months for a film company. Then in 1931 he became assistant administrator of the Charlottenburg opera (St&auml;dtische Oper), with Ebert as general manager. To open his first season, Ebert directed Verdi's <span class="italic">Macbeth</span>, scoring a huge success; the following season Fritz Busch conducted Verdi's <span class="italic">Un ballo in maschera</span>.<br>
<br>In 1933 both Ebert and Bing (who, though a Roman Catholic, was of Jewish descent) were dismissed by order of the Nazi party, which had gained power in Berlin. Bing was unemployed in Vienna when he heard from Busch in England: he and Ebert were working at Glyndebourne in Sussex, where a bold Englishman, John Christie, had built an opera house for his singer wife. The first season took place in the summer of 1934, presenting two operas by Mozart. Bing was engaged as talent scout and general dogsbody; in 1935 he became general manager of the Glyndebourne festival, with year-round employment and a London office.<br>
<br>Bing's skills as an organizer were extremely useful to Glyndebourne in its early years, and the festival grew from the original twelve performances of two operas to thirty-eight performances of five operas in 1939. With the outbreak of the Second World War, future plans were shelved. Evacuees descended on Glyndebourne, but the company ran a tour of John Gay's <span class="italic">The Beggar's Opera</span> in the spring of 1940, which ended at the Theatre Royal, Haymarket. Though Bing and his wife were technically enemy aliens&#151;their British citizenship came through in 1946&#151;they were not interned. Bing worked as divisional manager at the department store Peter Jones.<br>
<br>Bing conceived the idea of an Edinburgh international festival in 1945. He realized that Glyndebourne was not sustainable in its pre-war format, but that as part of a larger festival devoted to opera, concerts, ballet, and theatre it would be viable. After two years' hard work, Bing presented the first Edinburgh festival in August 1947. Glyndebourne offered <span class="italic">Le nozze di Figaro</span> and <span class="italic">Macbeth</span> while there were concerts by the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra conducted by Bruno Walter, in one of which Kathleen Ferrier sang in <span class="italic">Das Lied von der Erde</span> by Gustav Mahler. The Glyndebourne company continued to appear at Edinburgh in 1948 and 1949.<br>
<br>In March 1949 Bing, visiting New York to raise funds for Glyndebourne, met Edward Johnson, the Canadian tenor who had been general manager of the Metropolitan Opera since 1935 and now wished to retire. With the Edinburgh festival successfully launched, Bing could not resist the challenge, and Johnson promised to support him as his successor. The Metropolitan secured Bing's release from his Edinburgh contract, and in November 1949 he and his wife arrived in New York for an &#145;observation year&#146;.<br>
<br>The Metropolitan Opera at that time was on the verge of collapse. There were many good singers, mostly American, on the roster, but a serious shortage of good conductors, while production values were non-existent; operas were thrown on stage with little or no rehearsal. The board, which held the purse strings, considered money spent on designers and new scenery a complete waste. Some of the ancient sets were extremely shaky. According to Bing, &#145;when the soprano took a deep breath on the Met stage [in <span class="italic">Il trovatore</span>] the whole castle behind her would be seen to tremble&#146;  (Bing, 106).<br>
<br>Bing appointed Max Rudolf, an excellent administrator and conductor, as his assistant, and started planning his first season immediately. He intended to open with Verdi's <span class="italic">Don Carlos</span>, directed by Margaret Webster and designed by Rolf G&eacute;rard. The board jibbed at the cost of the production and of a three-week rehearsal period, but one of the sponsors, a supporter of Bing, sold a Rembrandt to cover the cost. This <span class="italic">Don Carlos</span> was still in good shape eighty performances and twenty-two years later when Bing retired.<br>
<br>Among Bing's most consequential innovations at the Metropolitan was to introduce black singers. Marian Anderson, the great contralto, sang Ulrica in <span class="italic">Un ballo in maschera</span> in 1955. She was no longer in her prime vocally, but her symbolic appearance paved the way for many fine American artists to sing there. The Italian soprano Renata Tebaldi, who sang with the company for twenty years, also made her d&eacute;but that year, and in the following season Bing engaged Maria Callas.<br>
<br>Perhaps the most important event during Bing's years at the Metropolitan was the move to the Lincoln Center, New York. The old house closed on 16 April 1966, and the new &#145;Met&#146; opened on 16 September 1966 with the premi&egrave;re of <span class="italic">Antony and Cleopatra</span> by Samuel Barber. In 1958 Barber's <span class="italic">Vanessa</span> had been successful, but the new opera was a disaster, despite Leontyne Price's fine Cleopatra. Bing had planned nine new productions for the opening season&#151;several too many, as he later admitted. The New York premi&egrave;re of Richard Strauss's <span class="italic">Die Frau ohne Schatten</span>, conducted by Karl B&ouml;hm, was a triumph, but another new opera, <span class="italic">Mourning Becomes Electra</span> by Marvin Davy Levy, was less popular. In 1968 Bing inaugurated a cycle of Wagner's <span class="italic">Ring</span>, conducted and directed by Herbert von Karajan, but only the first two operas were given, and the cycle was not completed until after Bing had left the Metropolitan in 1972. He had achieved most of his aims, dragging the company into the twentieth century; in his book <span class="italic">5000 Nights at the Opera</span> (1972), Bing graphically describes the many battles he fought and the difficulties he overcame.<br>
<br>Bing was appointed CBE in 1956 and promoted KBE in 1971. After his retirement he remained in New York, teaching and lecturing at Brooklyn College, the City University of New York, and elsewhere. His wife, Nina, died in 1983, and soon afterwards he became ill with Alzheimer's disease. In January 1987 he married Carroll Lee Douglas (<i>b</i>. 1939/40), who had nursed him in hospital. She spent nearly all his money before he was declared incompetent by the court; the marriage was annulled in 1989. He died on 2 September 1997 at the Hebrew Home for the Aged in the Bronx, New York. He had no children.<br>
