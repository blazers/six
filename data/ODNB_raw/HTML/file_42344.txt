<span class="headword">Conway,  Francis  Ingram-Seymour-</span>, second marquess of Hertford  (1743&#150;1822), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born Francis Seymour-Conway on 12 February 1743 in London, the eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6121/', "Francis Seymour-Conway, first marquess of Hertford (1718&#150;1794)")</script>, courtier, and Lady Isabella Fitzroy (1726&#150;1782), youngest daughter of Charles Fitzroy, second duke of Grafton. Known by the courtesy title of Viscount Beauchamp, he was educated at Eton College (1754&#150;9), before he matriculated at Christ Church, Oxford, on 2 February 1760; he took his MA on 15 June 1762. Beauchamp then travelled on the grand tour with his tutor, the antiquary Walter Bowman, during 1764 and 1765. The early stages of his political career were determined by his father's ability to obtain preferments through government service which were then passed on to his children. While his father was lord lieutenant of Ireland Beauchamp was made a privy councillor for Ireland (1765) and he acted as chief secretary to his father (1765&#150;6) before his appointment as constable of Dublin Castle (1766&#150;1822). He also represented Lisburn in the Irish House of Commons from 1761 to 1768.<br>
<br>Beauchamp entered the British House of Commons in 1766 as member for Lostwithiel and during the Chatham government he followed the political line set by his uncle <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6122/', "General Henry Seymour Conway")</script>. He was considered to be primarily interested in politics as a means of augmenting his family's parliamentary power base and income, and his success in taking over the borough of Orford, which he represented from 1768 until his inheritance of his father's title in 1794, was a move towards the achievement of these aims; for Orford, despite its proximity to the family's estate at Sudbourne, had previously been a Treasury borough. Beauchamp spoke regularly in the House of Commons between 1774 and 1788 and he was credited &#145;if not with eloquence, at least with knowledge of the subject&#146;  (<span class="italic">Memoirs of &hellip; Wraxall</span>, 4.137). During the American War of Independence he was a reliable supporter of Lord North's administration and he held minor ministerial office as a lord of the Treasury (1774&#150;80), a cofferer of the household (1780&#150;82), and a privy councillor for Great Britain from 1780. However he never attained the post of secretary at war to which he aspired. His chief parliamentary enthusiasms and causes were focused on Ireland, where he expressed consistent and strong support for the repeal of the penal laws against Roman Catholics, and upheld religious toleration. While a strong supporter of the political links between Britain and Ireland, he argued against the formal political and commercial union of the two countries and any act of compulsion directed against the Irish parliament. His views are best summarized in a pamphlet, <span class="italic">A Letter to the First Company of Belfast Volunteers</span>, published in 1782. In the later part of his career in the Commons he was generally associated with the Foxite opposition against Pitt, but in 1793 he spoke in favour of the <span class="roman">Aliens Bill</span> and seconded Pitt's address to the king, which paved the way for the abandonment of neutrality in favour of war with revolutionary France. Later in the same year he was employed as an informal roving ambassador to the king of Prussia and to other German courts, and he was given a minor military mission in the same area of Europe in the following year. In the course of these missions he clashed with Lord Malmesbury, the official emissary to Prussia, and no permanent position was forthcoming; but in 1794 he in any case succeeded to the marquessate and an income of over &pound;70,000 per annum, drawn largely from his Irish estates. He subsequently acquired the lease of Manchester (later Hertford) House in 1797, which became his principal London residence, and it remained within the Hertford family until the establishment of the Wallace Collection. On taking his seat in the House of Lords he took no part in debates on political subjects.<br>
<br>On 4 February 1768 Hertford had married Alicia Elizabeth Windsor (1749&#150;1772), second daughter and coheir of Herbert Windsor, first Viscount Windsor, and Alice Clavering. His second wife, whom he married on 20 May 1776, was Isabella Anne Ingram Shepheard (1760&#150;1834), eldest daughter and coheir of Charles Ingram, ninth and last Viscount Irwin or Irvine (<i>d</i>. 1778), and his wife, Frances [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/68378/', "Ingram, Frances, Viscountess Irwin (1734?&#150;1807)")</script>]. On the death of his mother-in-law on 20 November 1807, Hertford and his wife inserted the name Ingram before Seymour in recognition of the large fortune that they had simultaneously inherited. At about the same time the marchioness became an intimate friend (but not mistress) of the prince of Wales, the future prince regent and George IV, a role she continued to play until 1820, and in which she exercised some influence, not merely in securing patronage for her husband and son, but also in promoting tory and anti-Catholic measures.<br>
<br>On Pitt's return to government in 1804 Hertford was appointed master of the horse (1804&#150;6) and he was compensated with the Order of the Garter when he was displaced in the Grenville administration. His wife's influence at court helped to secure him the position of lord chamberlain of the household (1812&#150;21), but his career did not culminate in elevation to the much coveted dukedom, which was refused by Lord Liverpool in 1822, just before Hertford's death. Hertford's aspirations for the advancement of himself and his family followed closely the pattern set by his father, but although he was well informed on most political subjects, he displayed no pronounced political talents and relied on his wealth, connections, and parliamentary influence to gain access to the corridors of power. His taste in English portraitists is still visible in some items by Downman, Romney, and Reynolds, now in the Wallace Collection. He died on 17 June 1822 at Hertford House, Manchester Square, London, and was buried in the family vault in Ragley, Warwickshire, on 28 June.<br>
<br>Hertford's only surviving son from his second marriage was <a name="cosubject_25184"></a><span class="headword">Francis Charles  Seymour-Conway</span>, third marquess of Hertford  (1777&#150;1842), <span class="occ">courtier</span>, who was born on 11 March 1777, and was educated at Christ Church, Oxford, and also at St Mary Hall there, from which he graduated in 1796. Between 1797 and his accession to the title&#151;until when he was known as Lord Yarmouth&#151;he represented Orford, Lisburn, co. Antrim, and Camelford, all seats controlled by the Hertford interest. On 18 May 1798 he married, in defiance of his parents, Maria Emily Fagnani [<a name="cosubject_42344"></a><span class="headword">Maria Emily  Seymour-Conway</span>, marchioness of Hertford  (1770/71&#150;1856), <span class="occ">society hostess</span>]. She was the daughter of the Marchesa Fagnani (<i>d</i>. 1804), and a great heiress on account of the rival claims to her paternity by <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25065/', "George Selwyn (1719&#150;1791)")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7937/', "William Douglas, fourth duke of Queensberry (1725&#150;1810)")</script>, who both left their fortunes to her. Their first two children were a daughter, Frances Maria, later marquise de Ch&eacute;vign&eacute; (1799&#150;1822), and a son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/94237/', "Richard Seymour-Conway (1800&#150;1870)")</script>, who succeeded as fourth marquess of Hertford. The couple were detainees of Napoleon in France (1802&#150;5), and during that period a third child, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25174/', "Lord Henry Seymour (1805&#150;1859)")</script>, was born to Maria; his father was probably Count Casimir de Montrond (1768&#150;1843). After this period the marriage had effectively ended and the future third marchioness never returned to England, dividing her time between Paris and Boulogne. She played an important part in the upbringing of her elder son's illegitimate son, the future collector and benefactor Sir Richard Wallace. Lord Yarmouth was involved in a series of minor diplomatic missions after his return from France and he became an intimate of the prince of Wales who appointed him vice-chamberlain in 1812. He was appointed knight of the Garter on his accession to the marquessate in 1822 so as to secure to the government interest the eight pocket boroughs that he controlled. However, despite charm and obvious intellectual ability, his interests in politics were diverted substantially in later years by the gambling and debauchery that earned him sufficient notoriety to be satirized by Disraeli as Lord Monmouth in <span class="italic">Coningsby</span> (1844) and by Thackeray as the marquess of Steyne in <span class="italic">Vanity Fair</span> (1847&#150;8). He was the first major art collector in his family and also commissioned Decimus Burton to build St Dunstan's Villa in Regent's Park. His taste was similar to that of his friend the future George IV, and some of the miniatures, paintings, and French furniture and sculpture held today in the Wallace Collection derive from his acquisitions. Hertford died at Dorchester House, Park Lane, London, on 1 March 1842 and was buried at Arrow on 19 March. His wife died in rue Taitebout, Paris, on 2 March 1856, where she was buried in what became a family vault in the cemetery at P&egrave;re Lachaise.<br>
