<span class="headword">Luttrell,  James</span>  (<em>c.</em>1751&#150;1788), <span class="occ">naval officer and politician</span>, was born at Four Oaks, Warwickshire, the fourth and youngest son of Simon Luttrell, first earl of Carhampton (1713&#150;1787), of Castlehaven, co. Cork, and his wife, Judith Maria, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Lawes (<i>d</i>. 1798). His elder brothers were <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17223/', "Henry Lawes Luttrell, later second earl of Carhampton")</script>, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17228/', "Temple Simon Luttrell")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17223/', "Luttrell, Henry Lawes")</script>], and <a href="#cosubject_17225">John, later third earl [<i>see below</i>]</a>. James entered the Royal Navy in the mid-1760s and was promoted lieutenant on 2 February 1770.<br>
<br>In December 1775 Luttrell was elected MP for Stockbridge in Hampshire. Prior to this he had spent time in America. In parliament he attacked the North administration's policy towards the War of Independence, describing the British campaign as &#145;unjust, rash and savage&#146;  (Brooke, HoP, <span class="italic">Commons, 1754&#150;90</span>, 3.66). With his brothers John and Temple Simon, he also spoke out against the naval policy of the earl of Sandwich. Luttrell remained an active critic of the North government until 1780 when he was encouraged to modify his views with the offer of a command at sea as part of negotiations between Luttrell and the court's spokesman, Lord Irnham. In late July 1780 he was promoted first lieutenant of the <i>Belliqueux</i> and became captain on 23 February 1781. In the following year he took command of the <i>Mediator</i> in which, in December, he achieved some celebrity for his actions against the French navy. On 12 December the <i>Mediator</i> was patrolling off Ferrol when an American ship and four French vessels attempted to break out. Luttrell was able to break through the allied line and one French ship, the <i>Alexandre</i>, surrendered. Luttrell chased and captured another, the <i>Menagerie</i>, later that day. Next morning, the <i>Mediator</i> spotted two more of the vessels. However, in view of the fact that Luttrell's ship already carried 300 prisoners and a crew of only 190 he decided not to pursue them. This may have been as well, since during the night the French officers attempted to seize the British ship. Luttrell brought his prizes back to Britain: the action was commemorated by several paintings and led the king to write that Luttrell's &#145;skill as well as bravery &hellip; deserve much approbation&#146;  (ibid.).<br>
<br>In 1783 Luttrell was appointed to command the ship of the line <i>Ganges</i> but his naval career was nearing its end. He stayed with this ship for only six months before resigning, probably on the grounds of ill health, to become surveyor-general of the ordnance in March 1784. In April he was elected MP for Dover. He remained at the ordnance until his death, unmarried, from tuberculosis on 23 December 1788.<br>
<br>Luttrell's brother, <a name="cosubject_17225"></a><span class="headword">John  Luttrell-Olmius <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em>Luttrell]</span></span>, third earl of Carhampton  (<em>c.</em>1740&#150;1829), <span class="occ">naval officer and politician</span>, was the first earl's third son. He entered the navy in the mid-1750s, being promoted lieutenant in October 1758. In 1762 he became captain of the <i>Mars</i> and of the <i>Achilles</i>, the Portsmouth guardship, three years later. On 13 June 1765 he married Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1797), daughter of John Olmius, first Baron Waltham; they had three children, two of whom died in infancy. In 1774 he was elected MP for Stockbridge but vacated the seat in the following December for his brother James. With James and Temple Simon, John attacked the policies of Lord Sandwich whom he accused of selling naval offices, a charge refuted during a celebrated trial in 1773.<br>
<br>John Luttrell's next naval appointment was as captain of the <i>Charon</i> in which he sailed for the West Indies in March 1779. In October he led a squadron and captured the Spanish stronghold of St Fernando del Omoa, and seized bullion worth some $3 million. In 1780 he was returned as MP for Stockbridge after which, in line with his brother, he shifted his position in favour of the court and against the American War of Independence. He was disqualified from holding the seat when, in 1784, he became a commissioner for managing excise. Luttrell took the additional name of Olmius after his wife became heir to Lord Waltham's estate in April 1787. Following her death he married (on 16 July 1798) Maria Anne (1776/7&#150;1857), daughter of John Morgan; the couple had one daughter. Luttrell-Olmius became third earl of Carhampton on the death of his brother Henry in 1821. He himself died on 17 March 1829 at Devonshire Place, Middlesex, whereupon the title became extinct.<br>
