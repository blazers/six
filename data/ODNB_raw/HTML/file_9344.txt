<span class="headword">Fermor,  Richard</span>  (1480<span class="mult">x</span>84&#150;1551), <span class="occ">merchant</span>, was born between 1480 and 1484, the younger son of Thomas Fermor (<i>d</i>. 1485), alias Richardes, of Witney, Oxfordshire, a wool merchant, and his second wife, Emma, the daughter of Simkins Harvey of Hertfordshire. He inherited property in Oxfordshire from both his parents. Having followed his father and grandfather into the wool trade, by 1505 he was a merchant of the staple at Calais. He married (by 1515) Anne, the daughter of Sir William Browne, lord mayor of London, and had five sons (two died in infancy) and five daughters. In 1518 he was admitted to the Inner Temple. Generally described as a grocer, he was warden of the Grocers' Company from 1520 to 1523.<br>
<br>Fermor was given a share in the contract for victualling the royal army during the Tournai campaign of 1513, and he exported large quantities of wheat, flour, beer barrels, cannonballs, harness, and saltpetre. As a reward he was given licences to export wool direct to Italy. In 1515 the <i>Crist</i>, a ship of which Fermor was the chief owner, was captured by the Moors after being shipwrecked on the coast of Zeeland. He suffered further losses in 1538 through depredations by the emperor's subjects. On both occasions the king ordered his envoys to ask for compensation. In 1524 Fermor was in Florence and gave financial assistance there to John Clerk, Wolsey's agent, who was negotiating for the cardinal's election to the papacy. At the time of his fall (1529), Wolsey owed Fermor &pound;125 for various silks.<br>
<br>By 1509, when he was named one of the jurors for the trial of Sir Richard Empson, Fermor was living at Isham, Northamptonshire. He purchased considerable property in the southern part of the county, in particular the manor of Easton Neston from Empson's descendants. He also acquired manors in Bedfordshire (including Luton Hoo) and was nominated as sheriff (1532&#150;4)&#151;twice for Bedfordshire and Buckinghamshire and once for Northamptonshire&#151;but not selected. In the early 1530s he was the earl of Derby's chief steward for Northamptonshire, and his subsidy assessment of &pound;1000 in 1536 attests to his wealth. Having helped to victual the royal troops raised to put down the northern rising, he was appointed a juror to try the rebels in 1537.<br>
<br>In 1540 Fermor's world fell apart. He was attainted for defying the act that ended papal authority in England. Ostensibly he had supported Nicholas Thayne, his Catholic chaplain, who had publicly maintained the pope's headship of the English church, shouted down a neighbouring reformist vicar, and merely waxed over the pope's name in service books instead of erasing it completely. Fermor had visited him in prison and given him two shirts and 8<i>d</i>. But Marillac, the French ambassador, in a letter to Montmorency, suggested that Fermor was rather being punished for boldly attacking royal rights and prerogatives in parliament. There is no mention elsewhere of Fermor's role as an MP, so his return for London in 1539 can only be inferred. He was convicted of misprision of treason and sentenced on 9 May 1540 to life imprisonment and forfeiture. He was committed to the Marshalsea prison, but in August 1540 he was allowed to retire to Wappenham, Northamptonshire. Although excluded from the general pardon of 1540, he was pardoned the following year, and grants of land in Warwickshire, Essex, and Somerset helped relieve his penury. It is said that Will Somers, the king's jester, was instrumental in securing the rehabilitation of Fermor, who was his former master. Certainly in 1547 Fermor recovered some of his goods, and in 1550 he acquired eleven manors with an annual value of &pound;386. He died a wealthy man at Easton Neston on 17 November 1551. His tomb of Purbeck marble in Easton Neston church has palimpsest brasses of Fermor and his wife.<br>
<br>Fermor's eldest son, <a name="cosubject_9344"></a><span class="headword">Sir John Fermor</span>  (<em>b. </em>in or before 1516, <em>d.</em> 1571)<span class="occ"></span>, who studied at the Inner Temple, was knighted in October 1553, elected MP for Northamptonshire in October 1553 and in 1555, became sheriff in 1557, served as JP, and died at Easton Neston on 20 December 1571. He remained a Catholic, and only under Mary was he important in public life. He occupied himself with his estates, purchased the manor of Towcester, and was unscrupulous in his attempted eviction of unwanted tenants. He married by 1544 Maud, the daughter of the first Lord Vaux of Harrowden.<br>
<br>Richard Fermor's fourth son, Thomas (<i>b</i>. in or before 1523, <i>d</i>. 1580) was a merchant of the staple and of the Grocers' Company and, by his first marriage, to the heiress Frances Horde, of Horde Park, Shropshire, became an important figure in that county, of which he was a knight in the 1558 parliament and where he favoured a restoration of Roman Catholicism. He was removed from the commission of the peace after Bishop Scory of Hereford reported him as unfavourable to the established church. He sheltered the Marian priest John Felton and, in 1580, had a Catholic chaplain at Somerton, Oxfordshire, as well as retaining a rector instituted before the Elizabethan settlement. Yet his will and inventory both suggest loyalty to the crown. Thomas Fermor had extensive estates in Oxfordshire and several other counties; after the death of his first wife he married Bridget, daughter of Henry Bradshaw of Halton, Buckinghamshire.<br>
