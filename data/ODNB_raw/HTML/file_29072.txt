<span class="headword">Wesley,  Samuel</span>  (1766&#150;1837), <span class="occ">composer and organist</span>, was born on 24 February 1766 at Charles Street, Bristol, the youngest of the three children to survive infancy of the Methodist hymn writer <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29067/', "Charles Wesley (1707&#150;1788)")</script> and his wife, Sarah, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Gwynne (1726&#150;1822). He was the grandson of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29070/', "Samuel Wesley (bap. 1662, d. 1735)")</script>, the younger brother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29068/', "Charles Wesley (1757&#150;1834)")</script>, the nephew of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29069/', "John Wesley")</script>, and the father of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29073/', "Samuel Sebastian Wesley")</script>.<h2>
<a name="Childhoodandadolescence"></a>Childhood and adolescence</h2>Like his brother Charles, Samuel Wesley was a musical child prodigy. Charles's musical talents attracted the attention of many of the leading musicians of the day, including Samuel Arnold, William Boyce, John Worgan, Thomas Augustine Arne, and Joseph Kelway, many of whom visited the family home, and it was here, by the side of his brother, that Samuel received his first musical experiences. According to his father's account, at just under three he was able to play his first tune, at four had taught himself to read from a copy of Handel's oratorio <span class="italic">Samson</span>, and at five &#145;had all the recitatives, and choruses of <span class="italic">Samson</span> and the <span class="italic">Messiah</span>: both words and notes by heart&#146;  (Winters, 32). When he was six he had some keyboard lessons from David Williams, a Bristol organist, though his father remarked that &#145;it was hard to say which was the master and which the scholar&#146;  (Lightwood, 20). He also had violin and organ lessons, and at the age of seven played a psalm at a service at St James's Church. His first attempts at composition were also from this time. According to his father he had composed the airs for his oratorio <span class="italic">Ruth</span> before he was six, but was not able to write them down until he was eight. Shortly afterwards, the Wesleys were visited by Boyce, anxious to hear the &#145;English Mozart&#146;. He looked over the score of <span class="italic">Ruth</span> and afterwards commented: &#145;these airs are some of the prettiest I have seen; this boy writes by nature as true a bass as I can by rule and study&#146;  (Winters, 35). Wesley's general education was from his father, from whom he gained a good grounding in Latin, Greek, and Hebrew, and a wide knowledge of English literature.<br>
<br>Unlike William Crotch, who spent much of his early childhood on a succession of damaging and demeaning concert tours, Wesley was never commercially exploited as a child prodigy. None the less, his talents made him the object of a good deal of attention and he spent much of his childhood in the company of adults. A major influence at this time was his godfather Martin Madan, chaplain of the Lock Hospital and himself an amateur musician, who took him on many extended visits to family friends, including the painter John Russell (1745&#150;1806), who painted his portrait in 1776, and the scientist James Price, who later left him a house at Epsom and &pound;1000 in his will.<br>
<br>In 1771 Wesley's father accepted the gift of the lease of a house at Chesterfield Street, Marylebone, then a village on the outskirts of London. For a while, the family lived in both Bristol and Marylebone, but in 1776 they moved permanently to Marylebone. There, Charles and Samuel were able to widen their musical experiences and learn with the best teachers. But their father was initially reluctant for them to perform in public, and their appearance at a concert at Hickford's Rooms on 20 May 1777 under the direction of J. C. Bach appears to have been an isolated occurrence. Between 1779 and 1787 they organized a series of private subscription concerts at Chesterfield Street, in which both performed and for which both composed music. The concerts, intended by Charles Wesley to provide opportunities for his sons to develop their musical skills without the risk of being corrupted by worldly influences, involved a small professional instrumental ensemble and attracted fashionable audiences of sometimes more than fifty.<br>
<br>Around 1778 Wesley started to attend Roman Catholic services at one or more of the London embassy chapels. As he was later to admit in his <span class="italic">Reminiscences</span>, his initial involvement with Roman Catholicism was for musical rather than religious reasons, for it was in the embassy chapels that the most elaborate and sumptuous church music in London was to be heard. He would have been made welcome by Samuel Webbe I, the organist of the Sardinian and Portuguese embassy chapels and the central figure in London Roman Catholic church music at the time, and he would also have met Webbe's son Samuel II, less than two years his junior. By November 1780, doubtless encouraged by Webbe and other Catholic musicians, Wesley was composing Latin church music for use in the embassy chapels.<br>
<br>The attitude of his father to Wesley's involvement with the embassy chapels is not recorded, but it can hardly have been one of equanimity, and it is perhaps an indication of his tolerance that he permitted it to continue at all. By late 1783 Wesley's interest in Roman Catholicism had gone beyond the purely musical, and in May 1784 he converted, marking the event by composing an elaborate setting of the mass which he dedicated to and dispatched to Pope Pius VI. Wesley's conversion caused his father and other members of his family considerable hurt and sorrow, and in the wider Methodist community it was a major scandal which was discussed and agonized over for many years afterwards.<br>
<br>Wesley's whole-hearted commitment to Roman Catholicism appears to have been brief, and it is possible that adolescent rebelliousness may have been involved to a large extent in his conversion. In later life his attitude to Roman Catholicism was deeply ambivalent: he retained his fascination with its music and liturgy while rejecting its doctrines, remarking in a letter of 1809 that &#145;if the Roman Doctrines were like the Roman <i>Music</i> we should have Heaven upon Earth&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters</span>, ed. Wesley, 36). According to his obituary in <span class="italic">The Times</span> he later denied ever having been a convert, saying that &#145;although the Gregorian music had seduced him to their chapels, the tenets of the Romanists never obtained any influence over his mind&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 12 Oct 1837).<br>
<br>If Wesley's conversion to Catholicism was the major cause of concern to his family, other aspects of his behaviour were scarcely less worrying. Family letters of the period contain references to wild behaviour which seems to have gone far beyond normal adolescent rebelliousness and may indicate the onset of the bipolar or manic-depressive illness which affected him for the rest of his life. A particular cause of concern was his relationship with Charlotte Louisa Martin (1761&#150;1845), whom he met in October 1782 and was eventually to marry in 1793. Little is known of her: at the time of their initial meeting she was twenty-one to his sixteen, possibly a schoolteacher, and certainly on the evidence of her few surviving letters a well-educated woman. Their relationship was violently opposed by Wesley's family on the grounds of Martin's supposed unsuitability of character and family background. In one revealing letter of November 1792 to his mother, Wesley sought to correct the prevalent view of Martin as being &#145;of a careless, prodigal Disposition, and as closely resembling an extravagant Father and a vain Mother&#146;, pointing out that for several years she had lived &#145;decently and out of debt&#146;, on an allowance of &pound;30 per year  (Wesley, to his mother, 7 Nov 1792, John Rylands University Library of Manchester, DDWF/15/5). Wesley's father demanded that he should break off the liaison, and Wesley's refusal to do so exacerbated already existing family tensions.<h2>
<a name="Earlyadulthood"></a>Early adulthood</h2>Problems arising from Wesley's relationship with Martin continued after the death of his father in 1788. By now the main family preoccupation had moved from attempting to persuade Wesley to break off his relationship with her&#151;for this was clearly impossible&#151;to persuading him to regularize it by marrying her. Under different circumstances this might have been a reasonable request, for Wesley and Martin were passionately committed to each other and at this stage fully intended to spend the remainder of their lives together. But Wesley was implacably opposed to marriage: not to the institution, but to any form of marriage ceremony, whether conducted by the church or by the state. His objections derived from arguments put forward by Madan in his notorious <span class="italic">Thelyphthora</span> (1780), according to which marriage was established not by any civil or religious ceremony, but by sexual intercourse. On this basis, as Wesley explained to his mother in November 1792 in a letter of perhaps unnecessary frankness, he and Martin were married already and had no need of any official ceremonies to legitimize their union.<br>
<br>During the later 1780s and early 1790s Wesley's public career as a composer and performer was largely in abeyance. He made a living by giving music lessons at one or more girls' schools in London, but he hated teaching and regarded it as &#145;A B C drudgery&#146;. His disillusionment with the music profession and with life in London at this time appears to have been total, and he seriously considered the advantages for his health of a permanent move to the country. In 1787 Wesley is said to have suffered a serious head injury as a result of falling into a building site when returning home late one night from a visit to a friend. According to his obituary:<blockquote>the medical attendants wished to perform the operation of trepanning; but Wesley obstinately refused his consent, and the wound was permitted to heal. This he ever after regretted; for it is supposed that in consequence of some portion of the skull adhering to, or pressing upon, the brain, those periodical states of high nervous irritability originated, which subsequently checked and darkened the splendour of his career.</blockquote>Although this anecdote seems to have come from Wesley himself, it is uncorroborated by information from any other source. Its appearance for the first time in an obituary notice fifty years later gives grounds for scepticism about the accuracy of all its details, and in particular its explanation of Wesley's mental health problems.<br>
<br>On 17 December 1788 Wesley became a freemason and was admitted to the Lodge of Antiquity. On 13 May 1812 he was created grand organist by the duke of Sussex, but resigned this position in 1818 to Sir George Smart.<br>
<br>In the autumn of 1792 Wesley set up house with Martin in the small village of Ridge, Hertfordshire, some 13 miles from London. At this stage they were still determinedly unmarried, but the discovery of Martin's pregnancy early in 1793 prompted a capitulation to more conventional mores, and they eventually married at Hammersmith parish church on 5 April of that year. Their first child, Charles, was born on 25 September. He was educated at St Paul's School and Christ's College, Cambridge, was ordained in 1821, and later became subdean to the Chapel Royal and chaplain to the royal household at St James's Palace. He died in 1859. A daughter was born in late 1794 and died in December 1797. Meanwhile, Wesley's prophecy to his sister, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/63664/', "Sarah Wesley (1759&#150;1828)")</script>, in a letter that if forced into marriage with Martin he would &#145;marry her and hate her tomorrow&#146;  (Wesley to Sarah Wesley, 5 June 1791, Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge) was proving all too accurate. As early as October 1794, while waiting for his wife's confinement with their second child, he was ruefully confessing to his sister Sarah that she was &#145;never designed for [his] second self&#146;  (Wesley to his sister, 26 Oct 1794, Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia), and family letters of the period show that the marriage was already unhappy.<h2>
<a name="Musicalcareer17931816"></a>Musical career, 1793&#150;1816</h2>During his time at Ridge, Wesley continued to teach and carry out other professional engagements in London, staying overnight as necessary at the family home in Chesterfield Street. His one major composition from this period was the <span class="italic">Ode to St Cecilia</span> for soloists, chorus, and orchestra, on a text by his grandfather Samuel Wesley, which he completed in October 1794. It was first performed on 22 February 1799.<br>
<br>In the summer of 1797 Wesley and Charlotte left Ridge and moved to Finchley, probably as a result of their dissatisfaction with the isolation of country life and Wesley's decision to resume his professional career in London. In the summer of 1799 they moved again, to Highgate; their son John William was born around this time. Wesley's relationship with Charlotte continued to be stormy, with frequent quarrels, incidents of domestic violence, extra-marital affairs, temporary separations, and alternating periods of estrangement and reconciliation. A further daughter, Emma Frances, was born in early 1806.<br>
<br>There is little direct information about Wesley's musical activities in the years around the turn of the century, but his numerous compositions from the period indicate that it was a fruitful time. His Latin church music compositions show that he had renewed his involvement with the world of the Roman Catholic embassy chapels, probably with the chapel of the Portuguese embassy in South Street, South Audley Street, where Vincent Novello had recently become organist. A large number of glees, songs, and duets, mostly unpublished, show Wesley's involvement with the glee club and with other forms of informal and convivial music-making. His major work of the period was his large-scale setting for soloists, chorus, and orchestra of <span class="roman">Psalm 116</span>, <span class="italic">Confitebor tibi, domine</span>, which he completed in 1799. As with the <span class="italic">Ode to St Cecilia</span>, nothing is known about the circumstances of its composition. Its only performance in Wesley's lifetime was on 4 May 1826.<br>
<br>Wesley was also beginning to establish his reputation as the foremost organist of his day, and on 21 April 1800 he appeared as the soloist in one of his own concertos at one of the first London performances of Haydn's <span class="italic">The Creation</span>. In 1802 he organized a series of subscription concerts at the Tottenham Street Rooms of the Concert of Ancient Music with his brother Charles, and it may have been for this series that he wrote his symphony in B[flat]. A turning point was reached in Wesley's life and career with his discovery of the music of J. S. Bach and his subsequent involvement in the English Bach movement. Although he had known some examples of Bach's music earlier, and had made a manuscript copy of the forty-eight preludes and fugues in early 1806, the explosive awakening of his interest seems to have occurred early in 1808. By April of that year he was consulting Charles Burney about the best way to promote Bach's music and was planning a programme of activities which included concerts, lectures, and publications. Wesley's role in the English Bach movement is reflected in his well-known letters to Benjamin Jacob, first published in an edition by his daughter Eliza in 1875. His activities in promoting Bach's music also included his collaboration with C. F. Horn in the publication of the first English editions of the organ trio sonatas and the <span class="italic">Forty-Eight Preludes and Fugues</span> and his participation in a series of celebrated recitals of Bach's music at the Surrey Chapel with Crotch, Jacob, Novello, and the violinist Johann Peter Salomon.<br>
<br>The period inaugurated by the discovery of the music of Bach was the most active, fruitful, and financially profitable of Wesley's career. From 1808 to 1816 he was involved in almost every activity open to a professional musician at the time. He was much in demand as an organist, both as a recitalist and at choral and orchestral concerts. From 1813 he was the regular organist at the Covent Garden oratorio concerts, for which he later remembered that he was paid 6 guineas per concert, or 10 guineas if he played a concerto. He was active in the provinces, directing performances from the organ at a music festival at Tamworth, Staffordshire, in September 1809 and at the Birmingham festival in October 1811; he also gave recitals and played at festivals at Norwich, Great Yarmouth, Ramsgate, Margate, Ipswich, and elsewhere. In 1809, following Crotch and John Wall Callcott, he lectured on music at the Royal Institution. He gave two similar courses at the Surrey Institution in 1809 and 1811. From March 1814 to December 1816 he was the author of the unsigned column of reviews of new musical publications in the <span class="italic">European Magazine</span>. He also continued to be involved with Novello in the music of the Portuguese embassy chapel. He became a full member of the Philharmonic Society on 1 June 1815 and a director on 22 November of the same year, and was actively involved with the society's affairs in 1815 and 1816. His motet &#145;Father of light&#146; was performed at the society's concert of 29 April 1816, but this was the only work by him to be performed by the society, and he never himself appeared in or directed a concert.<br>
<br>Meanwhile, Wesley's marriage to Charlotte had irrevocably broken down. The final break appears to have been precipitated by Wesley's affair with the fifteen- or sixteen-year-old Sarah Suter, who was living at the time with the family as a servant or housekeeper. Wesley and Charlotte separated in 1810, no doubt following the discovery of the affair and of Sarah's pregnancy. Wesley and Sarah subsequently set up house together, and their first child, Samuel Sebastian, named after Johann Sebastian Bach, was born on 14 August. They continued to live together unmarried until Wesley's death in what appears to have been a loving and mutually supportive relationship. A large collection of Wesley's letters to Sarah and their children is now in the British Library. Seven of their children survived to adulthood: Samuel Sebastian, Rosalind, Eliza, Matthias Erasmus, John, Thomasine, and Robert Glenn, named after the husband of Rosalind. Two further children died in infancy or early childhood, in 1813 and 1816. Wesley's maintenance commitments to Charlotte, initially set at &pound;130 per annum by a deed of separation of 1812, continued to be a heavy drain on his finances, and non-payment resulted in his being briefly imprisoned for debt on at least one occasion, in May 1825.<h2>
<a name="Breakdownandrecovery18161830"></a>Breakdown and recovery, 1816&#150;1830</h2>Wesley's long run of success came to an end with a series of events triggered by his child's death in August 1816. He collapsed later that month while on a journey to Norwich to fulfil a professional engagement, but was able to make a partial recovery and to continue with his professional commitments until late March of the following year. In early May he threw himself out of a window in what appears to have been delirium, and narrowly escaped permanent injury. He was subsequently confined for a time in a private lunatic asylum. Financial and practical help for Wesley and his family at this difficult time appears to have come principally from his masonic friends, including William Linley.<br>
<br>Wesley made a slow and gradual recovery. By early 1819 he was picking up some of his former professional activities and had returned to his position as organist of the Covent Garden oratorios. But he was still in low spirits, unable to compose, and financially hard pressed. His breakdown was a watershed in his career. His enforced absence from musical life for almost two years caused him to lose contacts and opportunities, and as a result he was never able to regain the ground he had lost. None the less, he continued to be in demand as an organist and a lecturer on music through much of the 1820s and he was also able to develop his career in new directions. In 1824 he was appointed organist to the recently built Camden Chapel (All Saints, Camden Street); this appears to have been his first paid church appointment, and followed many unsuccessful earlier applications elsewhere. At the same time he had recovered his self-confidence sufficiently to complete and publish by subscription his Anglican service in F, parts of which he had written as long ago as 1808. Wesley had long been a leading practitioner and a respected authority in church music, and the publication of his service inevitably attracted a good deal of critical attention, including reviews couched in respectful but not entirely favourable terms in the <span class="italic">Harmonicon</span> and the <span class="italic">Quarterly Musical Review and Register</span>, the two principal musical periodicals of the time.<br>
<br>In 1826 Wesley obtained permission from the University of Cambridge to transcribe and publish music from the collection of the Fitzwilliam Museum; a similar permission had earlier been granted to Novello. While on a visit to Cambridge later that year he discovered the autograph manuscript of three hymns by Handel, written in the 1740s to words by Wesley's father, which he immediately edited and published. Encouraged by the success of this venture, he later compiled and published in 1828 a volume of tunes to the hymns by his father in current use by Methodist congregations.<br>
<br>Wesley's negotiations with the Methodist connexional editor Thomas Jackson over the publication of the Handel hymns may have been the cause of his partial reconciliation with the Methodist community. In May 1827 he was a warmly received guest at the annual breakfast of the Children of the Methodist Preachers, and he was invited to give the opening recital on the organ of the Brunswick Chapel, Leeds, on 12 September 1828.<br>
<br>Wesley's organ playing and lecturing activities also took him back to Bristol, which he had not visited since 1809. In September and October 1829 he gave a number of organ recitals there, including three at St Mary Redcliffe, when he was joined by his son Samuel Sebastian. The following January he returned and gave a course of lectures at the Bristol Institution. Both of these visits were probably arranged through his friend D. G. Wait, rector of Blagdon, who had also been involved in his activities at the Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge.<h2>
<a name="Finalyears"></a>Final years</h2>Following a further attack of depression in 1830 which effectively brought his career to a close, Wesley's last years were spent in retirement and in conditions of financial hardship. A subscription was arranged in 1830 by a group of his musical and masonic friends, led by John Capel, William Linley, and Vincent Novello. On the death of his brother Charles in 1834 the annuity which had been granted to the Wesley family by the Methodist Book Room in respect of the copyright of Charles Wesley senior's hymns descended to him, and these payments helped to alleviate his financial problems in his final years.<br>
<br>Wesley made few public appearances in the 1830s. In August 1834, at a Sacred Harmonic Society concert, he accompanied a performance of his anthem &#145;All go unto one place&#146;, written for the memorial service for his brother Charles.<br>
<br>By 1836, perhaps at the suggestion or with the encouragement of Sarah and his children, Wesley wrote his manuscript <span class="italic">Reminiscences</span>, in which he recorded all he could remember of his life in music. Although containing much of interest, the <span class="italic">Reminiscences</span> lack the sardonic humour and outspoken views of Wesley's letters. It is in no sense a finished document, and its laborious handwriting and repetitiousness show that Wesley's physical and mental powers were by this time failing. Also contained in the same manuscript are passages of historical writing, clearly written with publication in mind, and relating to Wesley's last piece of published work, an article entitled &#145;A sketch of the state of music in England, from the year 1778 up to the present time&#146;, which appeared in the first number of the <span class="italic">Musical World</span> on 18 March 1836.<br>
<br>Wesley's spirits revived shortly before his death. In July 1837 he wrote out from memory the full score of his <span class="italic">Ode to St Cecilia</span> of 1794, which he believed to have been lost. On 12 September 1837, less than a month before his death, he attended a recital by Mendelssohn at Christ Church Greyfriars and was afterwards persuaded to play. Mendelssohn was generous with his praise, but Wesley could only say, &#145;Sir, you have not heard me play. You should have heard me 40 years ago&#146;  (quoted in Lightwood, 227).<h2>
<a name="Personalityreputationandhistoricalsignificance"></a>Personality, reputation, and historical significance</h2>Wesley was the most original British composer of his time. His compositions, in almost every genre except opera, reflect and are enriched by his deep knowledge of a wide range of music from the sixteenth century to his own time. Much of his most ambitious and characteristic music, lacking the potential for large sales, remained unpublished in his lifetime, and many of the works that were published were unashamed potboilers, written for the amateur market. But his music had wide exposure through repeated performances at his own concerts, and his obituary notices attest to the high regard in which he was held.<br>
<br>Wesley was best known as an organist and was particularly famed for his extempore playing. According to <span class="italic">The Times</span>, &#145;his resources were boundless, and if called upon to extemporize for half-a-dozen times during the evening, each fantasia was new, fresh, and perfectly unlike the others&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 12 Oct 1837). There are many contemporary accounts of his playing; Edward Hodges, who heard him play in Bristol in October 1829, described his performance as &#145;truly astounding &hellip; it was the most wonderful I ever heard, more even than I had before been capable of conceiving; the flow of melody, the stream of harmony, was so complete, so unbroken, so easy, and yet so highly wrought that I was altogether knocked off my stilts&#146;  (quoted in Lightwood, 215).<br>
<br>Despite his brilliance as a composer and organist, Wesley held no official or church appointments of any importance, and was never quite in the innermost circles of London musical life. His lack of advancement is largely explained by his rebellious character, his famous outspokenness, the scandal of his personal life, and the violent mood swings to which he was subject. According to his obituary:<blockquote>His passions were exceedingly strong, and from a habit of always speaking his mind, and his having no idea of management or the <i>finesse</i> of human life, he too often by the brilliancy of his wit, or the bitterness of his sarcasm, unthinkingly caused estrangements, if not raised up an enemy. (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 12 Oct 1837)</blockquote>With less need of restraint, Mary Sabilla Novello, the wife of Vincent Novello, commented in a letter of around 1842 to the singer Henry Phillips on the &#145;opposite extremes of mad fun and excessive depression, to which alternations Wesley always was subject&#146;, adding:<blockquote>I knew him unfortunately, too well; pious Catholic, raving atheist, mad, reasonable, drunk and sober&#151;the dread of all wives and regular families, a warm friend, a bitter foe, a satirical talker, a flatterer at times of those he cynically traduced at others&#151;a blasphemer at times, a puleing Methodist at others. (Mary Sabilla Novello, fragment of a letter to Henry Phillips, <i>c</i>.1842, Lbl Add. 31764, fol. 34)</blockquote>Wesley died at his home at 8 King's Row, Pentonville, on 11 October 1837 after a short illness. His funeral service on 17 October was at old St Marylebone parish church. He was buried in an adjoining burial-ground, in the family plot alongside his father, his mother, and his brother Charles.<br>
