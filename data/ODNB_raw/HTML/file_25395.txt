<span class="headword">Sherwin,  William</span>  (1607&#150;1690), <span class="occ">clergyman and ejected minister</span>, was born in Nottinghamshire. He entered St John's College, Cambridge, in 1624, but in 1625 migrated to Queens' College, Cambridge, where his tutor, Herbert Palmer, later a member of the Westminster assembly of divines, encouraged him to read the millenarian writings of Joseph Mede. Sherwin graduated BA in 1628, was ordained in May 1630, and proceeded MA in 1631. He was married to Dorothea Swan at Ashwell in Hertfordshire on 11 September 1637; there were at least two children from this marriage, a daughter and a son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25396/', "William Sherwin (b. c.1645, d. in or after 1709)")</script> the engraver.<br>
<br>In 1645 Sherwin was assigned to the lectureship at Baldock, Hertfordshire, and appointed to the sequestered living of Wallington, in the same county, although in October John Bowles, former incumbent of the latter, was called before the committee for plundered ministers for disturbing him. Describing Sherwin's service in Wallington and Baldock, Edmund Calamy remarked that Sherwin cast &#145;his Net where there was Plenty of Fish. And he did it to good Purpose: For God blessed his Ministry to that great Congregation very much&#146;  (Calamy, 361). In 1660, however, Sherwin was ejected from his living when it was restored to Bowles. He then went to live in Fowlmere in Cambridgeshire with his daughter and son-in-law, John Crakinthorpe, who was rector there.<br>
<br>After his ejection, freed, as he explained, from &#145;Preaching, Expounding, Catechising, public fasts, &amp;c&#146;  (Sherwin, <span class="italic">Times of Restitution</span>, 3&#150;4), Sherwin resumed his study of apocalyptic prophecy, writing a number of works expounding millenarian doctrines. In 1665 he published <span class="italic"><i>Eir&#275;nikon</i>, or, A peaceable Consideration of Christ's Peaceful Kingdom on Earth to Come</span>, and <span class="italic"><i>Prodromos</i>: the Fore-Runner of Christ's Peaceable Kingdom upon Earth</span>. These works set out, albeit moderately and undogmatically, Sherwin's belief that there would be a personal manifestation of Christ in the world to inaugurate the thousand-year millennial kingdom. Sherwin's eschatological thought was influenced by his reading of John Archer's <span class="italic">The Personall Raigne of Christ upon Earth</span> (1642), and especially by Mede's writings. In the 1670s Sherwin published more millenarian tracts, presenting his conviction that the advent of Christ's kingdom on earth was imminent, and that the conversion of the Jews to Christianity would occur with Christ's appearance in the world; in the meantime he encouraged his readers to seek unity and peace  (<span class="italic">The Doctrine of Christ's Glorious Kingdom</span>, 1672, 1). Having published more than ten new works in the previous seven years, Sherwin's writings ceased abruptly in 1676. His only other extant work is a short tract from 1682 entitled <span class="italic">Of the Two Last Things</span>, in which he criticized prelacy and the human imposition of laws on worship. Sherwin remained at Fowlmere until his death, and was buried there on 12 June 1690.<br>
