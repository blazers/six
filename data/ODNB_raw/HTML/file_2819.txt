<span class="headword">Percyvale <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Bonaventure]</span>,  Thomasine</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1512), <span class="occ">trader and school founder</span>, was born in Week St Mary, near Bude in Cornwall, daughter of John and Joan Bonaventure. She became the subject of a legend, recounted by Richard Carew in his <span class="italic">Survey of Cornwall</span> (1602), which described the visit of a London merchant to Week St Mary, where Thomasine, the daughter of a poor family, kept sheep on the moor. The merchant, admiring her beauty and virtues, rescued her from poverty and took her to London where she married three times, her last husband becoming mayor of the city, and founded a school in the parish of her birth. Far from being poor, however, Thomasine's parents were in fact of gentry rank and were related by marriage to the Dinhams of Lifton. She may have gone to London about 1460, possibly as a servant to Richard Nordon, a wealthy London tailor with business links in Cornwall. He was an associate of one of her brothers, Richard, who from 1463 was rector of Chelsfield in Kent where their parents were eventually buried. Her first husband, whom she married before 1466, was Henry Galle, a London tailor who supplied clothes to Sir John Howard, later duke of Norfolk (<i>d</i>. 1485). Galle died probably in April 1466, leaving her his business, which she ran for a short while, before marrying Thomas Barnaby, another tailor and a fellow parishioner of St Dunstan-in-the-West. This marriage was even more short-lived, and Barnaby died in March 1467, leaving her a young but wealthy widow, capable of running a business and training apprentices.<br>
<br>Thomasine's third husband, whom she married <i>c</i>.1469, was <a name="cosubject_52314"></a><span class="headword">Sir John Percyvale</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1503), <span class="occ">merchant and mayor of London</span>. Born probably <i>c</i>.1430 in Macclesfield, Cheshire, Percyvale began his career in London as a servant in the mayor's household, becoming serjeant-at-mace in 1457. By the late 1460s, perhaps because of his marriage to Thomasine, he was active as a tailor and cloth merchant, becoming a liveryman of the Tailors' Company in 1468/9. He was elected master of the craft in 1485, and became an alderman, first for Vintry ward (1485&#150;96) and then for Langbourn (1496&#150;1503), serving as sheriff in 1486&#150;7. He acquired property in both wards as he expanded his business interests as a general merchant. Percyvale was knighted by Henry VII when the king arrived in London in 1485. His election to the mayoralty in 1498 was controversial: he had been an unsuccessful candidate on three previous occasions, primarily because of the rivalry which existed between the tailors and other companies, particularly the drapers. A chronicler also blamed the &#145;hote apetyte&#146; which Percyvale himself was rumoured to have for the post. He died in May 1503, shortly after founding a free grammar school in Macclesfield with the assistance of two Cheshire men, Thomas Savage, archbishop of York (<i>d</i>. 1507), and Sir Richard Sutton. In his will, dated 4 March 1502, he made substantial bequests of goods and clothing to parish churches in London and Cheshire and left lands in London and Kent to his widow. In the absence of any children from his marriage to Thomasine, other lands in London were to revert to his nephew and heir, Richard Percyvale of Ipswich, after her death.<br>
<br>Thomasine continued to run the business and train apprentices, and she maintained a large household at their mansion in Lombard Street, London. In November 1508 her prominence and wealth made her a target for a &#145;forced loan&#146; of &pound;1000 levied by the crown. She shared her late husband's interest in education and after his death brought up and instructed several poor children. In 1506 she began to make arrangements for her own grammar school, in Week St Mary, and the foundation deed of 10 July mirrored that of her late husband's school in Macclesfield, in providing for board and education to be given free of charge by a graduate of Oxford or Cambridge. The endowment, comprising lands in Devon purchased by Thomasine from Sir John Lisle, was to be placed in the hands of nineteen feoffees on her death. These arrangements were largely complete by February 1508 when Thomasine made the first of her two wills, in which she gave property to the Merchant Taylors' Company to augment the chantry, founded by her late husband in St Mary Woolnoth, which was administered by the company. Later that year she acquired a royal licence enabling her to found a chantry in the church at Week St Mary, and soon afterwards the first master of the school was appointed. She died before October 1512 and left the final arrangements for the school in the hands of her cousin, John Dinham. Her will, dated 26 March 1512, included a large number of cash bequests to servants, friends, and her remaining family in Cornwall, as well as money for charitable works. She also established numerous post-obit arrangements in London and Cornwall through her bequests to churches and religious houses. In a codicil dated 10 April she made over more lands in Devon to the trustees of her school. She was buried alongside her third husband in the church of St Mary Woolnoth in London.<br>
