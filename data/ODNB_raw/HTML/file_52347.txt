<span class="headword">Beorhtric <span class="st"> [Brihtric]</span></span>  (<em>d.</em> in or before 1066?), <span class="occ">magnate</span>, was the son of &AElig;lfgar M&aelig;w, who was prominent in the reigns of both &AElig;thelred II (<i>d</i>. 1016) and Cnut (<i>d</i>. 1035). Beorhtric was among the richest magnates in the time of Edward the Confessor (<i>d</i>. 1066), with over 350 hides of land in Cornwall, Devon, Dorset, Gloucestershire, Wiltshire, and Worcestershire. He acquired Bushley, Worcestershire, from Lyfing, bishop of Worcester, and attested charters of Bishop Ealdred in the 1050s  (<span class="italic">AS chart.</span>, S 1406, 1409). <span class="roman">Domesday Book</span> mentions some of the men commended to Beorhtric, among them Dunning, a minor thegn with land in Devon, Gloucestershire, and Worcestershire, who was a benefactor of Winchcombe Abbey.<br>
<br>Beorhtric was patron both of the minster at Tewkesbury, Gloucestershire, and of the abbey at Cranborne, Dorset, founded by his grandparents, &AElig;thelweard M&aelig;w (&#145;seagull&#146;) and &AElig;lfgifu. &AElig;thelweard, who was dead by <i>c</i>.1000, was allegedly related to the royal house. He may be identical with &AElig;thelweard the Chronicler, ealdorman of the western shires (<i>d</i>. 998); or, given the large estate held by his grandson in Devon, a descendant of &AElig;lfgar &#145;the king's kinsman in Devon&#146;  (<span class="italic">AS chart.</span>, S 962 [text A]), who died in 962 and was buried at Wilton. &AElig;thelweard's son, &AElig;lfgar M&aelig;w, who also gave land to Cranborne, attested charters of &AElig;thelred II between 999 and 1009, and probably to 1014. In 1016 he fought on the Danish side at the battle of Sherston. &AElig;lfgar's support for Cnut perhaps enabled him to preserve his lands through the upheaval of the Danish conquest and he may be the <i>minister</i> who attests charters of Cnut in 1019 and 1023  (<span class="italic">AS chart.</span>, S 956, 960).<br>
<br>The name Beorhtric appears on charters of 1019 and 1026  (<span class="italic">AS chart.</span>, S 953, 962) but the first attestations which may be those of Beorhtric son of &AElig;lfgar appear in charters of Harthacnut in 1042  (<span class="italic">AS chart.</span>, S 993&#150;4). One of these is also attested by Ordgar, kinsman of &AElig;thelred II, and Odda of Deerhurst, another possible descendant of &AElig;thelweard the Chronicler and thus of the West Saxon kings. Thereafter Beorhtric (presumably the son of &AElig;lfgar, though there are other possibilities) attests the Confessor's charters fairly regularly between 1043 and 1065. He usually signs as <i>minister</i> or <i>nobilis</i>, but in 1061  (<span class="italic">AS chart.</span>, S 1034) he and Ordgar's brother &AElig;lfgar are described as <i>consiliarii</i>. Although the implications of this designation are unclear, it seems that they should be numbered among King Edward's councillors.<br>
<br>Most of Beorhtric's land passed after 1066 to Queen Matilda, which may account for Wace's romantic tale of how, as a young girl in Flanders, she fell in love with the handsome Englishman who had come on an embassy to her father and, because he spurned her, took revenge by persuading her royal husband to arrest him and confiscate his land. Beorhtric's actual fate is unknown. He may have died without heirs before 1066, leaving his land to be appropriated first by King Edward and then by the Conqueror, for Tewkesbury itself was originally given, perhaps as early as 1067, to William fitz Osbern, earl of Hereford, who died in February 1071. After Matilda's death in 1083, Beorhtric's lands reverted to the king and later became the core of the honour of Gloucester. In 1102 the community of Cranborne moved to Tewkesbury, which then became a Benedictine house; its twelfth-century <span class="italic">Chronica</span> provides the clues to Beorhtric's ancestry.<br>
