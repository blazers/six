<span class="headword">Hewitt,  John Harold</span>  (1907&#150;1987), <span class="occ">poet</span>, was born in Belfast on 28 October 1907, the younger child and only son of Robert Telford Hewitt, principal of Agnes Street national school, and his wife, Elinor Robinson. He was educated at his father's school (<i>c</i>.1912&#150;1919), the Royal Belfast Academical Institution (1919&#150;20), and the Methodist college, Belfast (1920&#150;24). In 1924 he entered the Queen's University, Belfast, to read English and graduated in 1930 with a BA degree, having also (in 1927&#150;9) taken a teacher training course at Stranmillis College, Belfast. Hewitt's lifelong engagement with literature, art, and politics was fostered from the start by his parents, particularly by his father, a dedicated socialist. It was on his father's bookshelves that he discovered the English dissenting tradition which decisively influenced his political and literary development, as well as the magazines which stimulated his love of art. He wrote his first poems in 1924 and his earliest to appear in print were contributed (in 1928&#150;9) to a wide variety of left-wing newspapers.<br>
<br>In November 1930 Hewitt was appointed art assistant at the Belfast Museum and Art Gallery. During an exhibition there (probably in the autumn of 1932) he met Roberta Black (born in Larne, co. Antrim, on 30 October 1904, the daughter of Robert Black, watchmaker); they were married in Belfast on 7 May 1934. Hewitt's energies found expression throughout the 1930s in a range of cultural activities. In 1934, for example, he helped to form the Ulster Unit, a progressive art group, and in 1937 he was involved in the founding of the <span class="italic">Irish Democrat</span> newspaper, acting as literary editor and occasional contributor. In 1936 he finished &#145;The Bloody brae: a Dramatic Poem&#146;, his first extended treatment of the troubled relationship between English and Scottish planters and native Irish in the north of Ireland, thereafter a major theme in his writings.<br>
<br>During the Second World War, Hewitt's work in the Belfast Museum and Art Gallery significantly broadened what he later described as his &#145;local imaginative mythology&#146;, in particular inspiring a lasting enthusiasm for the radical strain in Ulster Presbyterianism of the later eighteenth century. Hewitt's discovery of his own region, especially the Glens of co. Antrim, made him acutely receptive to the &#145;regionalist&#146; idea he encountered at this time in the works of Lewis Mumford and others. Throughout the 1930s and 1940s Hewitt wrote numerous poems, publishing many in periodicals, and transcribing many more in his notebooks. He issued his first pamphlet of poems, <span class="italic">Conacre</span>, in 1943 and his second, <span class="italic">Compass: Two Poems</span>, in 1944, both privately published; and his first book-length collection, <span class="italic">No Rebel Word</span>, was published in 1948. Another key work of the period was the long autobiographical, &#145;regionalist&#146; poem &#145;Freehold&#146;, which appeared in the literary magazine <span class="italic">Lagan</span> in 1946. In this and other poems he emerges as the liberal Ulsterman of planter stock searching for equilibrium and an abiding place in a province where his forebears were originally interlopers, and as the city-dweller whose spiritual home is the country, however marginalized he may sometimes feel there.<br>
<br>Having been promoted, in 1950, to deputy director and keeper of art at the Belfast Museum and Art Gallery, Hewitt had high hopes of being appointed director when the incumbent retired, but in 1953 he failed to gain this appointment, almost certainly because his radical and socialist ideals were unacceptable to the Belfast Unionist establishment. He remained as deputy director for four more years, then applied successfully for the directorship of the Herbert Art Gallery and Museum in Coventry, a post he held from 1957 to 1972. Coventry, recovering from the devastating air raids of 1940 and 1941, offered an exciting challenge to a man of his energies and ideals, though he maintained close contact with the north of Ireland. He travelled extensively during this period, and shortly before his retirement his <span class="italic">Collected Poems, 1932&#150;1967</span> (1968) and <span class="italic">The Day of the Corncrake: Poems of the Nine Glens</span> (1969) were published.<br>
<br>Hewitt and his wife returned to Belfast in 1972 at a time of violent unrest but also unprecedented creativity in Ulster, especially in the field of poetry. He produced new work as poet and art historian, salvaged and revised several decades of verse from his notebooks, published books more frequently than at any other time in his life, and enjoyed a degree of recognition and homage previously denied him. The bearded, silver-haired poet, who wore glasses, smoked a pipe, and carried a walking-stick, became a familiar figure at cultural gatherings in Belfast. Roberta Hewitt died on 19 October 1975. In the following year Hewitt became the first writer-in-residence at the Queen's University, Belfast, serving until 1979, and in 1983 he was made a freeman of Belfast. He died on 27 June 1987 in the Royal Victoria Hospital, Belfast, and in 1988 the John Hewitt international summer school was established in his memory.<br>
