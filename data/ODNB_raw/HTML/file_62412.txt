<span class="headword">Ormsby <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em> Rodwell Jones]</span>,  Hilda</span>  (1877&#150;1973), <span class="occ">geographer</span>, was born on 1 November 1877 at 44 Charles Street, Hanley, Staffordshire, one of the large family of the Revd W. Rodwell Jones (1834&#150;1914), a Welsh Wesleyan Methodist minister, and Sarah Ann Cuthbertson. There is no known record of her early life, but the family is known to have moved seven times by the time Hilda was twenty-one, owing to the peripatetic nature of the Methodist ministry. She took the certificate in geography at the London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE) in 1908&#150;9 and was a teacher in England and France, studying at the &Eacute;cole Normale de Melun in France (probably 1909&#150;11). There she studied mostly French and German languages, fitting a three-year course into two. She graduated BSc (Econ) in 1918 while assistant lecturer at the LSE and was one of the few geographers to proceed to the degree of DSc (Econ) (1931).<br>
<br>Hilda Rodwell Jones initially came into contact with Halford Mackinder's work through his Saturday lectures for schoolteachers at the LSE, which she attended with her brother Llewellyn in 1911. She was appointed as demonstrator in geography at the LSE in 1912 and having been the mainstay of the geography department during the First World War was promoted lecturer in geography at the LSE in 1918, taking on responsibility for organizing the diploma and honours BSc (Econ) under Professor A. J. Sargent. In 1919 Llewellyn Rodwell Jones joined his sister in the LSE department, having previously been lecturer in geography at the University of Leeds and having completed distinguished war service. Theirs was a sister&#150;brother partnership unique in United Kingdom geography departments, and included shared responsibility for some courses. In 1920 she became a recognized teacher in the University of London at the London School of Economics. In the same period (&#145;five glorious weeks&#146;, according to Harrison Church; <span class="italic">Geography</span>, 423) she was promoted to lecturer in commerce with special reference to commercial geography, appointed assistant to Mackinder (replacing her brother), and on 26 June 1920 married George V. Ormsby (1885&#150;1950), a fellow LSE student and Reuters journalist who went on to become chief of the London bureau of the <span class="italic">Wall Street Journal</span>. Her key period of research and lecturing followed and she was subsequently promoted to reader in 1932. Her brother Llewellyn succeeded Mackinder as professor in 1925.<br>
<br>Intellectually, Hilda was much influenced by Mackinder, and recounted how she had sat on the unfinished foundations of an LSE building while Mackinder read to her the manuscript of his <span class="italic">Democratic Ideals and Reality</span> (1919). Mackinder's influence was explicitly acknowledged in her introduction to <span class="italic">France</span> (1931) but his influence pervades her texts, with their great emphasis on the physical patterns and processes underlying patterns of human activity, the historical development of those patterns, and the need to use maps to understand the region being studied. Ormsby invariably worked as a regional geographer, producing <span class="italic">London on the Thames</span> (1924) and <span class="italic">France</span> (1931), drawing as much as possible on field observation (conducted independently or with the Le Play Society). However, although profound, Mackinder's influence was not undiluted. Hers was an approach to the region that bore the mark of her tutor Professor A. J. Sargent and the French geographer Vidal de la Blache as much as Mackinder. Vidal believed that the physical environment did not determine the character of a particular region but rather presented opportunities for the inhabitants and this approach characterized Ormsby's work as seen clearly in her opening sentences to <span class="italic">France</span> (p. 3).<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">London on the Thames</span> is thought to be the first geographical text on London and one which was used as a basis for class and field study and was acclaimed for its original contour map of London. Both books were rich in maps and other illustration and were well received. <span class="italic">France</span>, organized around the geographical regions defined by drainage basins, was not always accessible to the general reader, but despite this, it remained Ormsby's abiding contribution which, although she described it as a stop gap at the time of publication, continued to be a standard undergraduate text into the 1960s and was still in print at the time of her death. Other European regional studies focused on issues of contemporary topical interest, notably her <span class="italic">Mitteleuropa</span> (1935) which examined the concepts of central Europe, Deutschland, and Germany. Sadly the manuscript for a long-researched book on Germany was destroyed in an air raid during the Second World War.<br>
<br>While remembered more for her tutorials and map classes than for clarity in lecturing style, Ormsby was a successful teacher and extremely competent departmental organizer. She gave memorable courses on Europe, inspired students to study France, and ran a celebrated seminar on London given in the late 1920s and early 1930s, enlivening lectures with her zest and sense of fun. Known as Dr O. or simply Hilda to staff and students alike, Ormsby earned &#145;high praise from those under whom she worked&#146;  (<span class="italic">Geography</span>, 423) and was a lively conversationalist and hostess. She was an attractive woman, remembered for her generosity, vivacity, candour, and sometimes unconventional behaviour.<br>
<br>Ormsby, along with her brother, was one of the thirteen founder members of the Institute of British Geographers formed in 1933 to meet the needs of the emerging community of academic geographers of Britain, at a time when the Royal Geographical Society was considered to be concerned primarily with exploration. Ormsby was the only woman in the founding group (although joined by eleven others within the year) and the first woman to serve on the council of the institute, as an ordinary member in 1936&#150;8. In 1962, at the age of eighty-five, Ormsby was created an honorary fellow of both the London School of Economics and the Royal Geographical Society.<br>
<br>Ormsby worked on maps for the naval intelligence division of the Admiralty during the First and Second World Wars and was deeply concerned that British soldiers in the First World War suffered at the hands of cartographers more concerned with aesthetics than accuracy. She and her husband also served as wardens in the air raid precaution service from the beginning of the battle of Britain onwards.<br>
<br>After retiring, Ormsby lived at Water End, an Elizabethan cottage in Hertfordshire, which (like her London homes at Fetter Lane and Clifford's Inn before) became a meeting place for students. Her husband died in March 1950 and she outlived him by twenty-three years, dying on 23 October 1973 within a few days of her ninety-sixth birthday at a nursing home in Althorne, Essex. Her body was cremated on 30 October at Chelmsford. A student bursary at the LSE was endowed by Hilda and George Ormsby.<br>
