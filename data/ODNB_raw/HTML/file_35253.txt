<span class="headword">Normand,  Wilfrid Guild</span>, Baron Normand  (1884&#150;1962), <span class="occ">judge</span>, was born at Aberdour, Fife, on 16 May 1884, the youngest son of Patrick Hill Normand (1843&#150;1910), linen merchant and manufacturer, and his wife, Ellen Prentice (<i>d</i>. 1900). He followed four brothers to Fettes College, and in 1902 went on to Oriel College, Oxford, where he obtained a first in <i>literae humaniores</i> in 1906; he then went to Paris University and, finally, to Edinburgh University, where he graduated LLB in 1910. So reserved and scholarly was Normand at this stage that few would have predicted for him exceptional success in high office. In 1910 he was admitted to the Faculty of Advocates, and quickly established a busy junior practice. On 22 July 1913 Normand married Gertrude, daughter of William Lawson, banker, of New York, they had a son and a daughter.<br>
<br>Normand's legal career was interrupted by service as an officer in the Royal Engineers from 1915 to 1918. On his return to the Scottish bar after the war he developed a substantial practice, particularly in the shipping and commercial field, and took silk in 1925. As editor of the <span class="italic">Juridical Review</span> in the early 1920s he contributed also to legal scholarship. His wife having died in 1923 he married, on 27 April 1927, Marion Bell Gilchrist (<i>d</i>. 1972), daughter of David Cunningham, farmer, of Aberdour.<br>
<br>In 1929 Normand was solicitor-general for Scotland for a few weeks, and he resumed that office after the general election of 1931, when he was elected Unionist member of parliament for West Edinburgh. His was the responsibility as solicitor-general to pilot through parliament the important <span class="roman">Administration of Justice (Scotland) Act</span> of 1933, which still basically regulates procedure in the Court of Session. He was appointed lord advocate and sworn of the privy council in 1933, and in 1934 was elected an honorary bencher of the Middle Temple. He vacated his parliamentary seat in 1935, when he succeeded Lord Clyde as lord justice-general and lord president of the Court of Session. He presided in the highest courts in Scotland until 1947, when he was appointed a lord of appeal-in-ordinary, an office from which he retired in 1953&#151;although he continued to sit from time to time thereafter both in House of Lords appeals and in the judicial committee of the privy council. In January 1947 he was created a life peer.<br>
<br>Normand's high reputation as an appellate judge in London and Edinburgh is assured, and it was as such that he was happiest in his professional career. The administrative duties of lord president he did not find very congenial. Moreover he preferred dealing with legal principles rather than with the weaknesses and shortcomings of men and women. Thus as lord advocate he did not relish his responsibilities for criminal prosecutions, nor did he enjoy the earthier aspect of practice at the bar; his was a specialist rather than a general purposes practice. On the other hand he was keenly interested in the art of pleading, himself favouring clear, unemotional, and concise exposition. He often quoted the advice of a well-known dean of the Faculty of Advocates, Condie Sandeman: &#145;If you have thought of anything good to say the night before your speech, don't say it.&#146; A typical example of Normand's style was <i>Cantiere San Rocco, S.A. v. Clyde Shipbuilding and Engineering Co. Ltd.</i> (1923), a case of unjustified enrichment, where Normand was led by Sandeman. English authorities might have been fatal to this case and Normand therefore argued the appeal in the House of Lords on Scottish and Roman law authorities, translating the <span class="italic">Digest</span> with successful effect. It was painful to Normand, but characteristic, that as lord advocate he refused to recommend his friend Sandeman for elevation to the bench after the latter had allowed his name to be used by a company, the administration of which had been criticized judicially in England.<br>
<br>As a judge in the House of Lords, Normand employed his grasp of principles and his powers of reasoning to expound Scots law and English law with authority so as to influence substantially the course of foreseeable legal development. The House of Lords having since 1966 reclaimed its earlier freedom to depart from its own precedents, the quality of individual decisions rather than the fact that the House of Lords has spoken has greater importance. Normand fulfilled admirably the special responsibility of a Scottish lord of appeal in recognizing the areas in which Scottish and English solutions may or must be harmonized and areas in which divergences must be stressed. No legal nationalist, he was vigilant for the best interests of Scots law in a United Kingdom setting. Thus he accepted reluctantly (and with sympathy for the Court of Session, whom he overruled) the statutory anomaly that for fiscal purposes Scottish charities must conform to the requirements of a statute of the Tudor Elizabeth. On the other hand, in <i>A.G. v. Prince Ernest Augustus of Hanover</i> (1957) judicially (but more vehemently extra-judicially) he deplored the attitude of the attorney-general, who was apparently prepared to accept that pre-union English statutes could confer British nationality while pre-union Scottish acts could not; the anomalous outcome was apparently that the prince became British in England only.<br>
<br>Normand was distinguished in appearance and bearing, and had a fine head of white hair to the end. Throughout his life he was recognizably a Scot in speech and outlook. Although he might on first impression seem reserved and austere he could be most courteous and charming in public and in private, and warmed in scholarly circles. During his six years' sojourn in London he was always happy to return home to Scotland, and it was there that he spent nearly a decade in retirement. These years enabled him to pursue those many scholarly interests that he had always maintained. He was an active trustee of the National Library of Scotland from its foundation in 1925 until his death, and in 1950&#150;53 was a trustee of the British Museum. He was active as chairman of the trustees of the Scottish Museum of Antiquities and of the Carnegie Trust for the Scottish Universities. He served in the capacity of president of the Classical Association of Scotland, of the International Law Association, of the Stair Society, and of the Scottish Universities Law Institute&#151;which he conceived to revive contemporary Scottish legal literature. His scholarship did not lack official recognition: he was an honorary LLD of Edinburgh, and an honorary fellow of Oriel College, Oxford, and of University College, London, which he served as chairman of its college committee during the era of post-war reconstruction. Somewhat fastidious in extrovert society, he enjoyed the company of scholars old and young. At his death he was working with Dr J. C. Corson, of Edinburgh University, on notes to the legal references in the works of Sir Walter Scott; these are deposited in the National Library of Scotland. He died in Edinburgh on 5 October 1962.<br>
