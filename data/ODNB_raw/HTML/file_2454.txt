<span class="headword">Birkbeck,  George</span>  (1776&#150;1841), <span class="occ">physician and educationist</span>, was born in Settle, Yorkshire, on 10 January 1776, the second son in the family of four sons and one daughter of William Birkbeck (1745&#150;1805), a Quaker merchant, manufacturer, and banker, and his wife, Sarah (1750&#150;1790), daughter of George Braithwaite of Kendal. He briefly attended Giggleswick School; then, aged eight, he went to board for six years at a Quaker school in Newton in Slaidburn, Lancashire. Following his mother's death in 1790 he lived at Hebblethwaite Hall, near Sedbergh, with a relative, Robert Foster. There he learned mathematics under John Dawson and developed a desire to study medicine.<br>
<br>Birkbeck became a pupil of Dr Garnett of Knaresborough in 1792&#150;3, from where he moved to Leeds to study pharmacy, medicine, and surgery. With this grounding he enrolled as a medical student at Edinburgh University in 1794 and joined the Royal Medical Society. He left his course in 1795&#150;6 to study at several private medical schools in London, but returned to Edinburgh in 1796 and took his MD in 1799. With the support of Dugald Stewart, Birkbeck was appointed professor of natural philosophy at the Anderson's Institution, Glasgow, in December 1799 and began his long and distinguished career in medicine and popular education.<br>
<br>A desire to provide education for the working classes led to Birkbeck offering free extra-curricular lectures on popular science, and this &#145;mechanics' class&#146; became very popular. Manoeuvred into introducing a fee, Birkbeck resigned his chair in August 1804, though he revived the class in Birmingham in 1805&#150;6, and delivered courses in Liverpool and Hull. Birkbeck had moved to Birmingham infatuated with Catherine, daughter of Sampson Lloyd of the city's Quaker banking family. They married on 15 May 1806 at Berkswell, Warwickshire, and moved to Finsbury Square, London, where Birkbeck set up a medical practice. A son, William Lloyd, was born on 3 March 1807; nine days later Catherine died. Devastated, Birkbeck immersed himself in his work. He became physician to the General Dispensary, Aldersgate Street (a novel body which treated out-patients and undertook home visits); he was admitted as licentiate of the Royal College of Physicians in 1808; and he wrote for the <span class="italic">London Medical Review</span> between 1808 and 1812. He also moved to 25 Cateaton Street, to be closer to the dispensary.<br>
<br>As befitted a busy and successful medical professional, Birkbeck received many honours and appointments. He became fellow of the Medical Society of London in 1807, and delivered its anniversary oration in 1810. He was admitted as a member of the Medical and Chirurgical Society in 1807 and elected an honorary member of Guy's Hospital Physical Society. He joined the Edinburgh Club and the Geological Society, was elected fellow of the Astronomical Society in 1820 and, in 1823, the first president of the Meteorological Society of London. He also became closely involved with the London Institution, a body established in 1805 to diffuse science and the arts through lectures and public demonstrations of experiments. From 1820 he offered free lectures to all comers, as he had done earlier in Glasgow; and from 1822 to his death he served as manager.<br>
<br>On 9 July 1817 Birkbeck married Anna Margaret Gardner (1793&#150;1875), youngest daughter of Henry Gardner, Liverpool merchant. They had five children: Anna Margaret (1818&#150;1863), George Henry (1820&#150;1909), Charles (1822&#150;4), Frances Georgina (1824&#150;1858), and Thomas Brougham (1826&#150;1859). The expanding family caused the Birkbecks to move to 50 Broad Street in 1822&#150;3.<br>
<br>In December 1823 Birkbeck, supported by Lord Brougham, inaugurated the London Mechanics' Institution, a metropolitan imitator of the recently formed Glasgow Mechanics' Institute, which in turn had grown out of Birkbeck's early mechanics' class. Birkbeck was invited to become the first president and in 1824&#150;5 lent &pound;3700 towards the cost of constructing a lecture theatre. Such middle-class patronage, encouraged by Francis Place, angered the institution's founders, the working-class radicals J. C. Robertson and Thomas Hodgskin, who wanted the institution to be an organization entirely independent of the middle class. Despite the subsequent withdrawal of Hodgskin and Robertson, the institution flourished during Birkbeck's life and, though suffering a decline in its fortunes after his death, it enjoyed a revival after 1867 as the Birkbeck Literary and Scientific Institution, and was renamed Birkbeck College in 1907, becoming a constituent school of London University in 1920.<br>
<br>Birkbeck was one of the original promoters of the foundation of London University in the 1820s and worked for the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge. He opposed the libel laws, campaigned against the newspaper taxes in the 1830s (joining &#145;the friends of liberty&#146;), and promoted a reform of the patent laws (1827). His only party political act was to second George Grote as MP for the City of London in 1832, but he was a lifelong friend and supporter of Lord Brougham, expressing a whig-radicalism that emphasized the need for free institutions, enterprise, and expression of opinion, and delighting in particular in the introduction of the penny post. He supported moves to end colonial apprenticeship; he was a supporter of Polish independence in 1832, joining the Literary Association of the Friends of Poland; and in 1840 he helped with William Linton's petition to save the Chartists Frost, Williams, and Jones from execution.<br>
<br>Birkbeck's health had been deteriorating for three years before the attack of prostatitis from which he died at his London house, 38 Finsbury Square, on 1 December 1841. His funeral took place in Kensal Green cemetery on 13 December after a thousand-strong procession from his home, headed by members of the Mechanics' Institution. He was a man of intense energy and religious conviction, given to personal abstemiousness but public generosity. A teacher rather than an originator, he was a gifted public speaker and chairman. In 1866 a family mausoleum was built at Kensal Green cemetery, into which his widow, by her will, directed that the letters of her deceased daughters, her deceased son Thomas Brougham Birkbeck, and George Birkbeck, both before and after their marriage, were to be buried with her  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 19 Nov 1875). Their eldest son, William Lloyd Birkbeck (1807&#150;1888), became Downing professor of the laws of England at Cambridge.<br>
