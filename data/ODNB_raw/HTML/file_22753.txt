<span class="headword">Price,  John</span>  (1602?&#150;1676), <span class="occ">classical scholar</span>, was born in London, according to the information transmitted to Anthony Wood by Thomas Lockey, canon of Christ Church, Oxford; he describes himself in his earliest published work as &#145;Anglo-Britannus&#146;. He was a scholar of Westminster School and went up in 1617 to Christ Church, where he neither matriculated nor graduated, presumably because of his Roman Catholic faith. In this period he apparently composed verses in memory of Queen Anne, who died in 1619. Given the commonness of the names, it is uncertain whether he is the John Price, &#145;son and heir of John Price of London, Esq., deceased&#146;, admitted at Gray's Inn in 1619  (Foster, <span class="italic">Register</span>, 156). He had apparently acquired a doctorate of law, presumably abroad, some time before 1640, but nothing in his career suggests an interest in legal practice. His references to his ownership and acquisition of books show that he was a man of some means.<br>
<br>In 1629 Price was in Venice; by 1635 he was in Paris, working on the <span class="italic">Apologia</span> of Apuleius, his edition of which he published there in that year. It is dedicated to Henry Howard, eldest surviving son of Thomas Howard, earl of Arundel; Price describes himself as having been for three years Arundel's prot&eacute;g&eacute; (<i>cliens</i>), as a result of the intervention of William Petty. Price had done a great deal of work for this edition before leaving England; while in Paris without his books, he was helped by Jean Bourdelot. His letters to Bourdelot from London in 1635 and 1636 reveal that, before Paris, Price had visited Padua and met Lorenzo Pignoria, perhaps on the same journey as his visit to Venice in 1629; it was presumably in Italy that he had discovered the edition of the <span class="italic">Apologia</span> by Scipione Gentili (1607), and modified his own plans accordingly. The final outcome is remarkable for the range of classical and medieval texts and earlier scholars cited, and for the use of visual and inscriptional evidence, drawing partly on the Arundel collections and partly on material recorded by Bourdelot. (The Arundel marbles had been collected in Asia Minor by an agent of Nicolas Claude Fabri de Peiresc, diverted by Petty; the inscriptions were published by John Selden in 1628 with the help of Patrick Young and Richard James.) Price describes himself as &#145;foreign and unknown&#146; to Bourdelot, but his letters show that he was already in touch not only with Pignoria, but also with Cardinal Francesco Barberini, Peiresc, and Selden  (Larroque).<br>
<br>It may be that confidence should be placed in the belief that Price went to Ireland during the rule of Thomas Wentworth, earl of Strafford, and met Archbishop Ussher, and even that he served Strafford, but it can only have been for a brief period in 1636, since by February 1637 Price was in Vienna, attracted by the manuscripts brought back from Constantinople by Augerius Busbequius. Price copied manuscripts not only in the Imperial Library, but also in the Tengnagel collection. It was at this stage also that he compiled the index of authors used by Hesychius, printed in his edition of the <span class="italic">Metamorphoses</span> of Apuleius of 1650. Before the end of the year Price was in Venice copying inscriptions, texts of which passed via Selden and George Harbin to Edmund Chishull. It was presumably from Venice that Price visited Piacenza (a visit to which he refers in a letter of 1658) and that he left for Rome in May 1640.<br>
<br>By late 1640 Price was back in England, writing to Archbishop Ussher from the country house of George Radcliffe, the friend of the earl of Strafford, on 29 August 1640; earlier that month, the dean and chapter of Christ Church had recommended Price to Archbishop Laud for a prebend. The traditions that Price published royalist pamphlets, supported the royalist cause, and was imprisoned by parliament are poorly grounded. By 1644 Price was in Antwerp having his portrait done by Wenceslaus Hollar, a portrait engraved by R. A. Persyn for Price's edition of the <span class="italic">Metamorphoses</span>. In 1645&#150;6 he was in Paris, where he associated with Claude de Sarrau, leaving with him on 10 February 1646 copies of his notes on the <span class="roman">New Testament</span> for G. J. Vossius and Claude de Saumaise. De Sarrau admired Price's learning and fortitude in adversity. An anonymous letter to Ussher from Rouen of 18 May 1647 is probably from Radcliffe, who was at Caen in April 1647; the letter records Price's intention of going to London and recommends him to Ussher. (If the letter is indeed from Radcliffe, he would undoubtedly have known of any earlier visit to Ussher.) Meanwhile, it was in Paris that Price's work on <span class="roman">Matthew</span> (1646), <span class="roman">Acts</span> (1647), the epistle of <span class="roman">James</span> (1646), and <span class="roman">Psalms</span> (1647) was published, probably also on five chapters of the gospels and the letter to <span class="roman">Philemon</span> (1646). Price's work in this field was in part republished with other <span class="roman">New Testament</span> material in London in 1660 as <span class="italic">Joannis Pricaei commentarii in varios novi testamenti librae</span>, a book to which Price refers in his later correspondence with the Medici. Price's <span class="italic">Apuleii Metamorphoseos libri XI</span> was published in Gouda in 1650. He had worked on it in England in 1640, using a manuscript he had originally owned, which he had given to Laud, and which Laud had given to Oxford, which Price had borrowed through the good offices of Patrick Young, librarian to James I and Charles I. He had recorded a certain amount of autobiographical data in it, and had also used the notes of Casaubon in his copy of the Leiden edition of 1588 by P. Colvius.<br>
<br>Price had written to Archbishop Ussher from London on 19 August probably of 1649, undertaking to transmit a book of Ussher's to Pierre and Jacques Dupuy. By 1653, when he wrote again to Ussher (also sending greetings to Selden), Price had been for a year in the employ of the Medici as their keeper of coins; he told Ussher that he was working on the epistles of Paul and Aulus Gellius. He was also appointed professor of Greek at Pisa. Tradition has it that he also intended to work on Avienus and further on Hesychius, having resigned his chair in Pisa and gone to Venice for the purpose, only to abandon the project with the publication of the Leiden edition of 1668. This edition, however, includes Price's index, originally published in 1650, and substantial contributions to the commentary. It is in any case certain that Price went to Venice in 1658. In 1661 he moved to Rome and into the patronage of Cardinal Francesco Barberini, and remained there until his death in 1676. He was buried in the Augustinian monastery there. Notes on some of the younger Pliny's <span class="italic">Letters</span> had by his death perhaps reached proof without being published.<br>
<br>Price was in touch with many of the major European classical scholars of his time, and Colomi&egrave;s lists many of those who cited him with esteem in their work. Price's scholarship had something of the magpie quality that Peiresc's had, but he did not have Peiresc's birth and wealth that enabled the latter to act as the centre of a European network of scholars. Price's work on classical authors shows judgement and learning, but when he turned to the <span class="roman">New Testament</span> he was insufficiently aware of the different nature of its textual tradition and excessively adventurous in emendation.<br>
