<span class="headword">Strahan,  Alexander Stuart</span>  (1833&#150;1918), <span class="occ">publisher</span>, was born in St Quivox, Ayrshire. He was the sixth of nine children of John Strachan (<i>d</i>. 1853), a messenger-at-arms and sheriff's officer in the highland town of Tain, Ross-shire, and his wife, Jane. Alexander attended the Tain Academy. In 1843, during the Disruption of the Church of Scotland, the Strachans became members of the new Free Church. In 1853, the Free Church editor, Hugh Miller (1802&#150;1856), who was a family friend, arranged for Alexander to be apprenticed to his publisher, the Edinburgh firm of Johnstone and Hunter. Within a few years Alexander changed the spelling of his surname. He also returned to the Church of Scotland, becoming a congregant of the Revd Norman Macleod the younger (1812&#150;1872). Many years later Strahan, who had a lifelong interest in theology, explained that the Free Church had never seemed to him to be an institution in which an open and enquiring mind could find satisfaction.<br>
<br>In 1858, in partnership with William Isbister, Strahan founded the publishing firm of Strahan &amp; Co., which moved from Edinburgh to London in 1862. In its early years the company specialized in devotional works, illustrated literature for children, and inexpensive reprints of American titles. After moving to London, the firm also published fiction, poetry, and essays by such popular authors of the day as A. K. H. Boyd, Robert Buchanan, Dora Greenwell, Jean Ingelow, Edward Jenkins, Henrietta Keddie (&#145;Sara Tytler&#146;), Charles Kingsley, Eliza Lynn Linton, Frederick Locker-Lampson, George MacDonald, Dinah Mulock, W. B. Rands, and Alexander Smith. Strahan established several important periodicals, including <span class="italic">Good Words</span> (founded in 1859 under the editorship of Norman Macleod), the <span class="italic">Sunday Magazine</span> (1864), and the <span class="italic">Argosy</span> (1865), which were notable for the high quality of the woodcuts contributed by such artists as W. Holman Hunt, Arthur Boyd Houghton, and J. E. Millais. The <span class="italic">Contemporary Review</span>, which Strahan regarded as his most important literary enterprise, began publication in 1866; one of the contributors was W. E. Gladstone, whose Liberal politics Strahan endorsed. In 1869 Strahan founded <span class="italic">Good Words for the Young</span>, edited by George MacDonald, and acquired the <span class="italic">Saint Paul's Magazine</span>, which had been launched in 1867 with Anthony Trollope as editor. Although Strahan made extensive use, in advertisements, of the names of his editors, in fact he was primarily responsible for conducting the periodicals.<br>
<br>Contemporary accounts emphasize Strahan's frenetic energy, extreme generosity, haphazard business practices, and unbounded egotism. Friends were impressed by his zeal to provide good but inexpensive literature &#145;for the people&#146;, and by his commitment to Christian social reform. But as a moderately evangelical Presbyterian, Strahan was distrusted by secularists, by Anglicans, and by doctrinaire Calvinists. As for his business associates, they complained that all too often he financed his enthusiasms at their expense. Strahan was already deeply in debt to his printers and stationers when, in 1868, he persuaded Alfred Tennyson to sign a five-year contract with Strahan &amp; Co. His creditors charged that he was far too lavish in his payments to Tennyson and other authors, and, in 1872, Strahan was forced to resign from the company. He retained the copyrights to several publications, including the <span class="italic">Contemporary Review</span>. In 1874 the name of the original firm was changed to Isbister &amp; Co.<br>
<br>For several years Strahan struggled unsuccessfully to regain his position as a major publisher. In 1876 a group of evangelicals formed Strahan &amp; Co. Ltd to acquire Strahan's various copyrights; Strahan was hired to be the company's &#145;editorial director&#146;, but he was dismissed from this position in 1881. In 1882 Strahan &amp; Co. Ltd was declared bankrupt, and the <span class="italic">Contemporary Review</span> was repurchased by Isbister &amp; Co. Although in the 1880s Strahan published a few books under the imprint &#145;Alexander Strahan&#146;, his career was effectively at an end.<br>
<br>In 1878 Strahan married Lisbeth Gooch S&eacute;guin (<i>d</i>. 1890), a writer of children's stories and travel books. They had two sons, Stuart S&eacute;guin Strahan and Geoffrey Bennoch Strahan, born in 1880 and 1882, and a daughter, Mary, born in 1884, who married Dr Ralph Martin Soames. Strahan died on 24 May 1918, at his daughter's home in Reigate, Surrey. In <span class="italic">The Times</span> obituary, he was recalled as one who had been &#145;a power to be reckoned with in the publishing world of the 'sixties and 'seventies&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 29 May 1918). He was buried in Brompton cemetery, London.<br>
