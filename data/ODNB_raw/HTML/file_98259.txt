<span class="headword">Lucena,  Lorenzo</span>  (1807&#150;1881), <span class="occ">Roman Catholic and Church of England priest, translator, and Hispanic scholar</span>, was born Lorenzo de Santa Mar&iacute;a Lucena y Pedrosa on 25 March 1807, at Aguilar de la Frontera, C&oacute;rdoba, Spain, the sixth and youngest child of Jos&eacute; Lucena Raya, a minor royal official and notary public, and his wife, Teresa Francisca, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Pedrosa. He was educated locally until November 1821, when he became a pupil at the Seminary of St Pelagius the Martyr, C&oacute;rdoba. It is not clear when his master's degree was awarded by the University of Seville, but he was evidently an able student, with a particular aptitude for teaching, who promised to rise to high office in the Catholic church in Spain. Between 1828 and 1835 he held the terce chair of theology at St Pelagius, before being promoted to the vespers chair in the same subject. He was ordained deacon in 1830 and priest in 1831.<br>
<br>On 8 January 1836 Lucena left St Pelagius, for reasons that were never clarified, but appear to have consisted of a mixture of career disappointment, in the form of the refusal of the duke of Medinaceli, in the summer of 1835, to appoint him to a chaplaincy in C&oacute;rdoba, love for his third cousin, Micaela Castilla y Aguilar, and discontent with the state of the Spanish church in a turbulent period. The chaplaincy would, of course, have kept him in the Catholic church, and there is no sign of any personal or theological conflict between him and his colleagues at St Pelagius. In any case, on 19 January 1836, after a journey amid winter storms, he and Micaela presented themselves in the British consulate in Gibraltar. They had travelled there on false passports, issued by the mayor of Benamej&iacute; in M&aacute;laga province, as a merchant and his wife. They were married at Holy Trinity Church, Gibraltar, on 24 January. The following month they travelled to London, remaining there for about a year, during which Lucena's diaconal and priestly orders were transferred to the Church of England, and he was licensed by Charles Blomfield, bishop of London. Once back in Gibraltar, he ministered to the Spanish congregation attached to Holy Trinity, being instructed by the governor of the colony to avoid religious controversy. In 1839 he was sponsored by the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge as headmaster of a school for Spanish children, and in 1842 became an honorary canon in the newly established cathedral chapter of Holy Trinity, a dignity he held until 1858. During his time in Gibraltar he revised, for the SPCK, the Spanish translation of the <span class="roman">New Testament</span> by Bishop F&eacute;lix Torres Amat, and his work was widely distributed in Spain and Latin America. Two daughters were born in Gibraltar, Luisa Amelia in 1845 and Julia in 1848. In October 1849 the family sailed to Liverpool, where Lucena became a chaplain in the Foreigners' Mission, an Anglican charity for seamen. During this time he also taught Spanish at the Liverpool Mechanics' School of Arts, part of the Royal Liverpool Institute.<br>
<br>In 1858 Lucena was elected to the new post of teacher of Spanish at the Taylor Institution in Oxford. His initial appointment was for five years, renewed until his death in 1881. The university conferred on him in 1877 the degree of MA by decree. He was required to lecture in the Taylor building on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday afternoons, and, in addition to his official pupils, who were few in number but included senior members of the university, from 1863 he was allowed to teach Spanish privately at home. Although modern languages was not a degree subject in Oxford until 1905, from 1865 Spanish was included among the languages offered for Taylor scholarships. Taylor teachers were not members of the university, but Lucena equipped the Taylorian Library with books that formed a comprehensive basis for Hispanic studies, including works on literature, history, archaeology, philology, and bibliography, as well as current political writing and newspapers.<br>
<br>While in Oxford Lucena seems not to have exercised a public priestly ministry, but he became connected with St Aldate's Church, and his daughter Julia married Henry, elder son of its rector, Alfred Christopher. At the request of the SPCK Lucena revised the complete translation of the <span class="roman">Bible</span> made by the sixteenth-century Spanish reformer Casiodoro de Reina and revised by Cipriano de Valera. The result was published in Oxford in 1862, and in subsequent editions, in whole or in part. Although this was his largest-scale work, influential in Spanish-speaking protestant circles, Lucena also published, between 1837 and 1856, translations of various Anglican writings, by Joseph Hall, John Jewell, John Cosin, Lancelot Andrewes, William Beveridge, George Bull, and Richard Crakenthorpe, as well as James I of England. His 1856 set of translations has a preface containing the only known expression of Lucena's own theological views, which appear to have been those of the liberal part of the Spanish Catholic church in which he had been brought up and ordained. On this evidence he hoped for a general reform of the Roman Catholic church, by means of a true general ecumenical council, which might incorporate a Church of England that was both catholic and reformed.<br>
<br>Lucena brought to Oxford not only his teaching skills but a depth of biblical scholarship, evidently involving knowledge of Hebrew and Greek, and familiarity with the theology of St Thomas Aquinas, which had formed him at St Pelagius. Although he only taught Spanish publicly, he may well have contributed his distinctive theological understanding on a less formal basis, and his work at the Taylorian laid valuable foundations for Spanish studies in the university. He died at his home, 27 Walton Street, Oxford, of cirrhosis, on 24 August 1881, and was buried in St Sepulchre cemetery, Jericho. A sign of the esteem in which he and his family were held was the raising, by colleagues and pupils, of a fund totalling &pound;1048 6<i>s</i>. 0<i>d</i>., with which a trust was set up to support his widow, their daughter Luisa, and Luisa's son, James Lucena Mackenzie Wilson. Subscribers included most of the heads of the Oxford colleges, many professors and current college fellows, the Oxford MP, the earl of Aberdeen, and the curators of the Taylor Institution and the British and Foreign Bible Society.<br>
