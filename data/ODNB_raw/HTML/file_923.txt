<span class="headword">Avery,  Benjamin</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1684?, <em>d.</em> 1764), <span class="occ">Presbyterian minister and physician</span>, was probably the son of Timothy Avery (<i>d</i>. 1721) and Elizabeth Avery baptized at Newbury, Berkshire, on 1 December 1684. Little is known of his early life or education. James Odgers conjectures that Avery was a pupil of James Peirce (1674&#150;1726), who was the minister at Newbury from 1700 to 1713; this seems very likely as Avery was Peirce's literary executor. In April 1711 Avery was made a doctor of civil laws by Edinburgh University. A week earlier he had been admitted MA in a private ceremony without having previously matriculated, perhaps as part of Principal William Carstares's scheme for attracting English nonconformists to Edinburgh. Avery was an assistant first to Thomas Freke (<i>d</i>. 1716) and then to Freke's successor, John Munkley, both ministers of the Presbyterian congregation at Bartholomew Close, London, until he quitted the ministry in 1720 as a consequence of the 1719 Salters' Hall controversy over religious subscription. Avery was against subscription. He briefly served as a clerical manager of the Presbyterian Fund, from 1718 until leaving the ministry. He then practised as a physician and in 1729 was elected a governor of Guy's Hospital, serving as treasurer from 23 December 1742 until his death. He was also a trustee of Dr Williams's Trust (1728&#150;64). He married twice, first, Mary Hodges at St Katharine by the Tower, London, on 3 May 1716, with whom he acquired &pound;600 a year, and second, Mary Kingland at St George's, Hanover Square, on 2 December 1750.<br>
<br>Avery became the leading manager of the dissenting interest: &#145;In all public concerns&#146; that affected dissenters &#145;he for many years took the lead&#146;  (Wilson, 3.381). His major contribution was as chairman (1735&#150;64) of the protestant dissenting deputies, of whom he was a founding member. He succeeded Samuel Holden, the first chairman, whose failure to press for the repeal of the <span class="roman">Test and Corporation Acts</span> led to his removal. Avery also undertook the office of treasurer (1738&#150;48). He proved an active and effective chairman assisting dissenters in Ireland and America as well as England. He used his contacts with government ministers not only on behalf of the dissenting interest, but to obtain more general favours. In 1761 he informed the duke of Newcastle that a Mr Sewell &#145;would be extremely acceptable to the Body of Protestant Dissenters&#146; to fill the vacancy in the solicitor-general's office  (BL, Add. MS 32932, fol. 310<i>r</i>). He also recommended the rector of Belbroughton for a vacant living at Worcester and sought a landwaterman's place in the port of London.<br>
<br>Avery made an important contribution to the theological development of English Presbyterianism as one of the anonymous authors of the <span class="italic">Occasional Papers</span>, also known as the <span class="roman">Bagweell Papers</span> from the initials of the authors (namely Simon Browne, Avery, Benjamin Grosvenor, Samuel Wright, John Evans, Jabez Earle, Nathaniel Lardner, and Moses Lowman), which were issued monthly between 1716 and 1718, and later published in three volumes. These essays stressed the importance of personal judgement in matters of doctrine. All the contributors were non-subscribers at the Salters' Hall debate. Avery was the leading promoter of the <span class="italic">Old Whig, or, The Consistent Protestant</span>, which was issued weekly between March 1735 and March 1738 to maintain what were seen as the political and religious principles of the seventeenth-century whigs. He was assisted in the project by several London ministers, including Benjamin Grosvenor, Samuel Chandler, George Benson, and James Foster, all non-subscribers at Salters' Hall. He also published in 1714 a sermon on <span class="roman">Micah</span>, preached on 4 November 1713, William III's birthday. Avery's sympathies are evident from his friendship with James Peirce, who was dismissed from Exeter for heterodoxy. He wrote the original Latin inscription for Peirce's gravestone (which the rector refused to allow), and edited a posthumous collection of Peirce's sermons (1728).<br>
<br>Avery died on 24 July 1764 and left a substantial estate, including farms at Combe in the parish of Bright Walton, Berkshire, and at Winagrove and Rowsham in Buckinghamshire, to his nephew, Thomas Warner, with numerous legacies to friends, including some of the leading London ministers. He was buried in the vault of St Thomas's, Southwark, but in his will asked to be re-buried as near as possible to Thomas Guy, the founder of the hospital, whenever the latter was reinterred in a new chapel at Guy's Hospital.<br>
