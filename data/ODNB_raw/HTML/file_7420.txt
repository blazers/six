<span class="headword">Deering <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em>Gandy]</span>,  John Peter</span>  (1787&#150;1850), <span class="occ">architect</span>, was the youngest child in the family of six sons and four daughters of Thomas Gandy (<i>d</i>. 1814), who worked at White's Club, St James's, London, and his wife, Sophia, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Adams. His older brothers included the painter <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/10335/', "Joseph Michael Gandy ARA (1771&#150;1843)")</script> and the architect <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/10336/', "Michael Gandy (bap. 1773, d. 1862)")</script>. John Peter Gandy was a pupil of James Wyatt from 1805 to 1808. In 1805 he was admitted to the Royal Academy Schools. He exhibited at the Royal Academy between 1805 and 1833, and was awarded the silver medal in 1806. His early exhibits included <span class="italic">A Design for the Royal Academy</span> (1807) and two drawings, <span class="italic">An Ancient City</span> and <span class="italic">The Environs of an Ancient City</span> (1810). In 1810 he won first prize in a competition for a design for the new Bethlem Hospital, but it was never carried out.<br>
<br>When he left James Wyatt's office, Gandy took a job at the barrack office, from which he was granted leave from 1811 to 1813, when he accompanied Sir William Gell on an expedition to Greece on behalf of the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/92790', "Society of Dilettanti")</script>, acting as architectural draughtsman. This trip was written up in 1817 as <span class="italic">The Unedited Antiquities of Attica</span>, and in 1840 as the third volume of <span class="italic">Antiquities of Ionia</span>, edited by William Wilkins. With Sir William Gell, Gandy also published <span class="italic">Pompeiana</span> (1817&#150;19), which became the standard work on the excavations at Pompeii. He was elected a member of the Society of Dilettanti in 1830. He then began to establish himself as an architect. To begin with he collaborated with William Wilkins, and together in 1817 they designed a 280 foot tower to commemorate the battle of Waterloo, to be erected in Portland Place, but the project fell through because of the economic recession. He worked with Wilkins on the University Club, Pall Mall (1822&#150;6), and was runner-up to Wilkins in the competition for a design for University College, London, and then acted as Wilkins's assistant in its construction. Other buildings in London included St Mark's Church, North Audley Street (1825&#150;8), a Greek revival church, and Exeter Hall, in the Strand (1830&#150;31). He also remodelled the courtyard of Burghley House, Northamptonshire (1828), and made alterations at Shrubland Park, Suffolk (1831&#150;3). Most of his designs were neo-classical in style, and he was regarded as an authority on Greek architecture, although there were exceptions, such as the hospital at Stamford, in Tudor Gothic style.<br>
<br>In 1828 Gandy inherited the Lee estate, near Great Missenden, Buckinghamshire, from his friend Henry Deering, and took the name of Deering. With the support of Wilkins, he had been elected ARA in 1826 and RA in 1838, an honour scarcely justified by his subsequent professional inactivity. Deering gradually gave up his profession as an architect, and spent the rest of his life as a country gentleman. He was elected MP for Aylesbury in 1847, and high sheriff of Buckinghamshire in 1840. He died in Hanover Square, London, on 2 March 1850.<br>
