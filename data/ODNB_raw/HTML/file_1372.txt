<span class="headword">Barham,  Charles Foster</span>  (1804&#150;1884), <span class="occ">physician</span>, was born at Truro Vean, Cornwall, on 9 March 1804, the fourth son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1377/', "Thomas Foster Barham (1766&#150;1844)")</script>, a musician and writer of independent means, and his wife, Mary Ann, eldest daughter of the Revd Joshua Morton, of Blackheath, Kent. He was the brother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1373/', "Francis Foster Barham (1808&#150;1871)")</script>, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1378/', "Thomas Foster Barham (1794&#150;1869)")</script>, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1379/', "William Foster Barham (1802&#150;1845)")</script>. He was educated privately at Penzance, at St Keverne, and at Bodmin, in Cornwall, between 1811 and 1819, and at Saffron Walden in 1819&#150;20. He then went to Downing College, Cambridge, where he matriculated in October 1821. The following January he migrated to Queens' College, where he became a foundation scholar in May 1823. After studying medicine in Edinburgh, Paris, and Bologna, he took his MB degree at Cambridge in 1827, though he did not become MD until 1860. For four years he practised at Plymouth and at Tavistock Dispensary, and in 1832 he moved to Truro and joined the staff of the Royal Cornwall Infirmary; he was appointed senior physician in 1838, and after resigning that post in 1873 he was elected consulting physician. On 28 September 1839 he married Caroline (<i>b</i>. 1811), second daughter of Clement Carlyon MD of Truro, Barham's superior at the infirmary.<br>
<br>After settling in Truro Barham joined the Royal Institution of Cornwall. He became its joint secretary in 1837, a post he held until he became its president in 1859, and over the years he contributed many articles to its report and journal. In 1856 he was sworn in as a magistrate for Truro and in 1858 he was appointed mayor. He was also consultant physician to the Truro Friendly Society, and he was president of the south-western branch of the British Medical Association for a number of years.<br>
<br>Barham was interested in antiquarian and scientific researches generally. The two subjects which had especial interest for him were the health of the miners who contributed to Cornwall's wealth, and the county's climate. Many of the papers written by him on these topics are listed in the first and third volumes of <span class="italic">Bibliotheca Cornubiensis</span> (1874, 1882). His <span class="italic">Report on the Sanitary State of the Labouring Classes in the Town of Truro</span> appeared in 1840. In 1842 he was a sub-commissioner on the children's employment commission, and he drew up reports on juvenile employment in mines and iron foundries in Cornwall. These were printed in the reports of the commission along with the evidence he had collected.<br>
<br>Barham died at his home, 11 Strangways Terrace, Truro, on 20 October 1884, survived by his wife, three sons, and four daughters. He was buried nearby, at Kenwyn, three days later.<br>
