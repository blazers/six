<span class="headword">Fergusson, Sir  James</span>, eighth baronet  (1904&#150;1973), <span class="occ">archivist and scholar</span>, was born on 18 September 1904, the eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/33111/', "Sir Charles Fergusson, seventh baronet (1865&#150;1951)")</script>, of Kilkerran, Ayrshire, and his wife, Lady Alice Mary Boyle (1877&#150;1958), second daughter of the seventh earl of Glasgow. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/31102/', "Bernard Fergusson")</script> was a younger brother. He was educated at Eton College and Balliol College, Oxford (1922&#150;5), where he took a fourth-class degree in history in 1925. After working as a bookselling assistant in London and with Blackwood's publishing firm in Edinburgh, he joined the BBC, first in Edinburgh and then in the overseas service. He broadcast on Nazi propaganda and lectured to forces in the Middle East. From 1945 to 1949 he was a leader writer on the <span class="italic">Glasgow Herald</span>.<br>
<br>The war had depleted the staff of Register House, Edinburgh, and when the post of keeper of the records became vacant in 1949 a selection board under the chairmanship of Sir Alexander Gray was initially unable to recommend an appointment. When he learned of Fergusson's candidature at the instigation of Dr Henry Meikle of the National Library, Gray noted, &#145;This looks quite promising: whatever else he is J. F. is something of a personality&#146;. Fergusson was interviewed at a second sitting of the board and his appointment was confirmed. His twenty years as keeper were a time of considerable expansion for the Scottish Record Office. Fergusson was generous in his assistance to researchers, whose numbers increased dramatically. He played an important part in the deposit of many collections of private papers and built up a qualified staff. Above all he persistently pressed the office's accommodation requirements in the face of increasing accessions of records. Although he would have preferred expansion at Register House itself, the outcome was the conversion of St George's Church, Charlotte Square, into West Register House, opened in 1971. Before his retirement he had already become ill and he received much help from his deputy and successor, John Imrie.<br>
<br>As keeper, Fergusson was also chairman of the Scottish Records Advisory Council, which gave its support on accommodation, the transfer of Scottish records from the Public Record Office, and the development of local archives. Another duty which he undertook with relish was the supervision of the elections of Scottish representative peers to serve in the House of Lords, held normally in the picture gallery, Holyroodhouse, but held in 1955 in Parliament House. When he wrote <span class="italic">The Sixteen Peers of Scotland</span> (1960) he did not know that the procedure would be brought to an end by the 1963 <span class="roman">Peerage Act</span>. He was also an active chairman of the editorial committee of the <span class="roman">History of Parliament</span> project.<br>
<br>During the week Fergusson stayed at the New Club, Edinburgh, and wrote in the evening. He continued to contribute to the <span class="italic">Glasgow Herald</span> on historical subjects. His family background provided material ranging from the eighteenth century to his father's role in <span class="italic">The Curragh Incident</span> (1964). Thus his first book was <span class="italic">Letters of George Dempster to Sir Adam Fergusson</span> (1934), and chapters entitled &#145;The Kilkerran improvers&#146; and &#145;The farmer judge: Lord Hermand&#146; were included in <span class="italic">Lowland Lairds</span> (1949). <span class="italic">The Man behind Macbeth</span> (1969) included a piece on Thomas Thomson, the son of Dailly manse who became deputy clerk register from 1806 to 1841 and who was commemorated by a new Scottish Record Office building opened in 1995. His knowledge of Argyll was put to use in <span class="italic">Argyll in the Forty-Five</span> (1951) and in his study of the Appin murder case, the background to R. L. Stevenson's <span class="italic">Kidnapped</span>, printed in <span class="italic">The White Hind</span> (1963). In retirement he produced a study of <span class="italic">The Declaration of Arbroath</span> (1971).<br>
<br>Fergusson also took part in the radio programme <span class="italic">Round Britain Quiz</span> with Jack House, who explained their success by saying &#145;James is public school and I am public house&#146;. Before 1949 he was a trustee of the National Galleries of Scotland and later he became a member of the Royal Commission on Historical Manuscripts and a trustee of the National Library of Scotland. A member of the Royal Company of Archers (the queen's bodyguard in Scotland), he became lord lieutenant of Ayrshire on his retirement as keeper. He was loyal to the Church of Scotland both in his parish of Dailly and as a commissioner to the general assembly. Glasgow University awarded him an honorary LLD in 1960 and he was elected FRSE in 1968.<br>
<br>Fergusson married on 17 July 1930 Louise Frances Balfour Stratford Dugdale (<i>d</i>. 1988), daughter of Edgar Trevelyan Stratford Dugdale and related to the Balfours of Whittingehame and the dukes of Argyll. They had two sons and two daughters: Charles, who succeeded to the estate; Adam, MEP for West Strathclyde (1979&#150;84); Alice, who married the Rt Hon. Timothy Renton MP; and Christian, who died in a car accident at the age of fourteen in 1954.<br>
<br>Sir James Fergusson died on 25 October 1973. A memorial service was held in November at Greyfriars Kirk, whose minister, Dr Stuart Louden, was a friend with affectionate memories from his earlier ministry at Dailly. Sir James was tall and of distinguished appearance with a small moustache. Photographs convey something of his characteristics of tenacity of purpose and directness combined with personal courtesy, composure, and a sense of duty and service.<br>
