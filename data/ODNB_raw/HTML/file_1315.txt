<span class="headword">Bannister,  Charles</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1741, <em>d.</em> 1804), <span class="occ">actor and singer</span>, was baptized at some time between May and October 1741 in Newland, Gloucestershire, the son of John Bannister and his wife, Rebecca Powell. He was brought up in Deptford, where his father worked in the victualling office for the navy. He was fascinated by theatre from childhood, and played such roles as Romeo and Richard III in amateur productions. After being rejected by David Garrick, whose company he had applied to join, he acted on the Norwich&#150;Ipswich circuit until Samuel Foote engaged him in April 1762 to join his company at the Haymarket Theatre in Foote's <span class="italic">Oratorial Lectures</span>, one of the latter's attempts to present drama but evade the constrictions of the <span class="roman">Licensing Act</span>. But Bannister was not a success and returned to the provinces, acting at Dublin in 1764, at Richmond, Surrey, in 1766, and at Norwich in 1766&#150;7.<br>
<br>Bannister was finally invited to join Garrick at Drury Lane, and made his first appearance there as Merlin in Garrick's <span class="italic">Cymon</span> on 22 September 1767. William Hopkins, the prompter, noted that he &#145;was received with Applause,&#151;is a tall Figure,&#151;good Voice and sings well&#146;  (<span class="italic">BDA</span>). In October Bannister played Hopkins in Garrick's backstage farce <span class="italic">A Peep behind the Curtain</span>. From that season until 1783 he acted at Drury Lane in a wide range of roles, though he specialized in eccentric old men. He often played for Foote's Haymarket Theatre in the summers and sang at performances at Marylebone Gardens and Ranelagh as well. In 1783&#150;4 he was at Covent Garden, where he doubled his salary to &pound;12; he kept the rise when he returned to Drury Lane. For the next few years he oscillated between the two major companies, but his career was declining. He finally retired at the end of the season in 1799 while a member of Colman's company at the Haymarket.<br>
<br>Bannister's considerable reputation as a singer was built not only on his striking physique and his superb bass voice and accomplished falsetto range but also on his talents as a mimic. As an anonymous attack on him noted in <span class="italic">Momus</span> (1767):<blockquote>
<div>See B[annister] assume (unaw'd by shame)<br>
</div>
<div>A mimic's vile and despicable name [&hellip;]<br>
</div>
<div>A very monkey with a human name.<br>
</div>
</blockquote>His imitations of other, better-known, singers were clearly extremely funny, but he was also known as a moving singer of sentimental songs. As a versatile actor he was most successful in dozens of dialect roles and playing caricatures of Italian singers. By the 1780s he was famous enough to be imitated himself by provincial comics. It was claimed that he could not read music and had to be taught songs by the pianist at Covent Garden. In 1782 he played Polly Peachum in a cross-dressed production of Gay's <span class="italic">The Beggar's Opera</span> so successfully that, it was said, a Mrs Fitzherbert laughed so much that she died from the after-effects three days later.<br>
<br>A clubbable man and at times a heavy drinker, well known for his practical jokes and careless with money, Bannister was much in demand at private gatherings and was a member of such groups as the Glee Club, the Anacreontic Society (a club for noblemen and professional singers), and the School of Garrick, a club he led for those who had acted with Garrick. He was painted by Zoffany and by others in a variety of his best-known roles, including as Polly Peachum.<br>
<br>It is not known when Bannister married his wife, Sarah, but they had three children: Charles (<i>d</i>. 1762), <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1316/', "John Bannister (1760&#150;1836)")</script>, even more successful as an actor than his father, and Jane (<i>fl</i>. 1783&#150;1829). He died at the house in Suffolk Street, Charing Cross, London, where he had lived most of his life, on 19 October 1804, three days after a full house at Drury Lane for his benefit night. He was buried at St Martin-in-the-Fields, London, on 25 October. In 1808 his estate, worth a mere &pound;200, was passed on to his son John, Sarah having died at some date in the interim.<br>
