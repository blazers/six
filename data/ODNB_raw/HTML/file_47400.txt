<span class="headword">Gonson,  William</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1544), <span class="occ">naval administrator</span>, was a son of Christopher Gonson (<i>d</i>. 1498?) of Melton Mowbray, Leicestershire, and his wife, Elizabeth. Another son, Bartholomew, became vicar there. Nothing is known of William's early life: he was possibly the Captain William Gonson who sailed in government service and later directed shipping movements. He was certainly a clerk in the navy storehouse at Deptford, Kent, receiving ropes and artillery pieces (1513) and armorial banners (1514) for ships. Thereafter his diverse duties and responsibilities are attested in official records: indeed, he was chief executive <i>de facto</i> of the navy for almost twenty years, and after his death was&#151;in effect&#151;replaced by a &#145;navy board&#146;.<br>
<br>Gonson married Benet Waters (<i>d</i>. 1545/6). They had six sons (David, Richard, Christopher, Arthur, <a href="#cosubject_47401">Benjamin [<i>see below</i>]</a>, and Anthony) and four daughters (Margaret, Elizabeth, Avis, and Thomasine), and they resided in Thames Street, London, in the parish of St Dunstan-in-the-East. Gonson was well paid, both from his naval appointments and as one of Henry VIII's squires of the body, though his great wealth probably came through his commercial activities. In 1525 he was a warden of the Grocers' Company, and he may by then have owned the &#145;great <i>Mary Grace</i>&#146;, which traded to the Greek islands. Thus, in 1530, he was one of twenty-two merchants trading with Candia (Crete); and about 1534 his ship <i>Matthew Gonson</i> (300 tons), with his son Richard as captain, sailed with a consort to Chios (where Richard died) and Candia (Crete). In March 1539 foreign merchants' goods in an unidentified ship of Gonson's were valued at 50,000 marks sterling (over &pound;33,000), and in 1541 he was assessed for subsidy on &pound;1000. In 1524 he became keeper of the storehouses at Deptford and Erith, Kent, and an usher of the king's chamber, and for part of the period 1532&#150;7 he handled sums of money totalling more than &pound;15,589. Hence he was concerned with rigging warships, paying money for wages and victualling, purchasing masts, repairing Thames forts, building ships (for example, the <i>Galley Subtile</i>), and (in 1539) sending a fleet to bring Anne of Cleves from Calais to Dover for her marriage to Henry VIII. He was vice-admiral&#151;the first in England&#151;of Norfolk and Suffolk from 1536 until 1543, and held courts at Kings Lynn and elsewhere.<br>
<br>In 1540 Gonson made arrangements with his parish for his funeral. He was to have a memorial brass made and let into another man's gravestone, and, following interment in St Dunstan's, to have requiem masses performed annually for twenty years. In July 1541 his son Sir David, a knight of St John of Jerusalem, was executed as a traitor. Plainly, William Gonson's responsibilities imposed great strain, particularly with the Anglo-French war (1543&#150;6), and in 1544 (before 5 August, when Benjamin was accounting) he &#145;feloniously killed himself&#146;  (<span class="italic">LP Henry VIII</span> 20/1, no. 125/7). A suicide's body had, by law, to be buried, with a stake through the heart, near local crossroads: Gonson was interred in his parish church, which suggests that matters were hushed up. No will or administration has been found. Gonson's value to his country was recognized, after his death, by the creation of a &#145;navy board&#146; to replace him. The will of his widow, Benet, was made on 18 August 1545, the executors being her son Benjamin, to whom she left a few items of plate, and Thomasine's husband, Henry Tyrrell; probate was granted on 23 February 1546. <a name="cosubject_47401"></a><span class="headword">Benjamin Gonson</span>  (<em>c.</em>1525&#150;1577), <span class="occ">naval administrator</span>, followed his father into government service. His brother Christopher was the heir of their father (in 1545) and their brother Arthur of their mother (1546), so Benjamin was probably the fifth son. As he was of age to marry by 8 June 1546, he was born perhaps about 1525; he commenced his government work during 1540&#150;41, doubtless as his father's assistant, so succeeded him, as from 5 August 1544. However, William's death underlined the chaotic situation, and in 1546 a &#145;council of marine&#146; was established, Gonson being appointed surveyor of ships, from 24 April 1546, with a salary of &pound;40 per annum. From 30 September 1548 he served as treasurer of the navy (though his patent is dated 8 July 1549), with a salary of &pound;66 13<i>s</i>. 4<i>d</i>. These officers of marine causes (Gonson himself, William Holstock, Sir William Winter, Sir Edward Baeshe)&#151;able beneficiaries of William Gonson's reforms&#151;now met within the city of London, in a house on Tower Hill. In fact it was convenient for the nearby naval storehouses, the Tower's ordnance depot, and the shipyards downstream.<br>
<br>Gonson lived in Tower Street, in the parish of St Dunstan-in-the-East, where he was assessed for subsidy in 1559 (on &pound;180) and 1576 (&pound;200), but he also owned property in Great Baddow, Essex. He married Ursula Hussey (<i>d</i>. 1586), and his list of their fourteen children, born within the years 1547&#150;67, supplies unusual detail. All were born and baptized in his parish except for Thomasine, who &#145;was born in the Queen[']s house at Deptford (wherein I dwelled)&#146; in 1564, and was baptized in the local church  (BL, Add. MS 15857, fol. 153<i>v</i>); their father's social standing is clear from the eminence of the godparents, who included Sir Thomas Lodge and the current mayoress of London. Gonson had been a promoter of the voyages of John Hawkins to Guinea for black slaves in 1562 and 1564, and his daughter Katherine (<i>b</i>. 1549) married Hawkins on 20 January 1567 at St Dunstan-in-the-East. The first husband of Thomasine was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9293/', "Edward Fenton")</script>.<br>
<br>As treasurer, Gonson handled large sums of money (&pound;28,285 for the year from Christmas 1555), and from January 1557 he was given an annual appropriation, initially of &pound;14,000, instead. For example, during 1569 payments were made for wages, board, and lodging for men repairing major warships, and for sending 880 men to four ships; providing timber from Sussex; bringing a warship from Liverpool to Deptford, Kent; and for purchasing land in Kent, needed for Upnor Castle.<br>
<br>In 1577 Gonson was taken ill: knowing that John Hawkins would obtain the treasurership, he told him, &#145;I shall pluck a thorn out of my foot and put it into yours&#146;  (Oppenheim, 145). Gonson died later that year (his accounts for 1576 and 1577 were rendered by his daughter Ursula and her husband), and was buried on 11 December at St Dunstan's. On 18 March 1578 administration was granted to his widow Ursula. Their son Benjamin (<i>b</i>. 1551) was clerk of the ships from 1588 to 1600.<br>
