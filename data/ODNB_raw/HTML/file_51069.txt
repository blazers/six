<span class="headword">Glover,  Edward George</span>  (1888&#150;1972), <span class="occ">psychoanalyst</span>, was born on 13 January 1888 at Lesmahagow, Lanarkshire, the third son of Matthew Glover, a country schoolmaster, and Elizabeth Smith Shanks, who was of a farming family. His eldest brother, James, who died early, in 1927, was regarded as the genius of the family, taking after his father, whereas Edward was regarded as being more pedestrian. The middle brother died when Edward was four. Edward's intellectual capacities only appeared at fourteen when his father became his teacher. Before that he was &#145;a reluctant, rebellious, contumacious and obstinate schoolboy&#146;  (Kubie, 86). He followed James into medicine and qualified MB ChB Glasgow, aged twenty-one. Four years of good academic medicine (under a cardiologist, Professor John Cowan) honed his scientific bent, though his awareness of psychological forces when treating children brought to his attention the clash between the strictly organic approach to medicine and the scope of actual clinical experience.<br>
<br>Glover spent some years in tuberculosis medicine, publishing some papers, until his elder brother James introduced him to psychoanalysis. Glover recognized both his identification with James and also the need of the young brother to copy and surpass his older sibling rival. Later, when they were both psychoanalysts they worked together without incapacitating rivalry, each acting as foil for the mind of the other. The brothers both went to Germany at the end of the First World War to study with Karl Abraham, the outstanding figure of the new Berlin Psychoanalytic Institute. Edward, then thirty-two, was honorary medical officer to an English Quaker relief commission. Both James and Edward were luminaries in early British psychoanalysis but James's life came to a sudden end from diabetes.<br>
<br>Glover spent many years as the collaborator of Ernest Jones, the dominating life president of the British Psycho-Analytical Society, which he had formed in 1919. Successively he was director of research, later director, and chairman of the training committee of the Institute of Psychoanalysis. Glover was regarded as Jones's crown prince and successor but finally broke with him over his political manipulations within the Psycho-Analytical Society.<br>
<br>Between 1926 and 1929 Jones and Glover represented the Psycho-Analytical Society on the British Medical Association's committee investigating the status of psychoanalysis, which was formed following public disquiet at its possible harmful effects. Together, against strong opposition, they received the association's recognition of psychoanalysis as a technique requiring professional training. During these years Glover took over Jones's functions in the society as Jones was grief stricken following the death of his daughter Gwenith.<br>
<br>Glover described himself in adolescence as &#145;a little prig and have remained so&#146;  (Kubie, 86). He was very critical of his own writings and those of others as he had learned from his father how to aim for high academic standards and insisted on the importance of distinguishing metapsychology from metaphysics. His writing style was clear and fluent and he held no respect for persons in authority. He insisted that basic Freudian principles should be respected and tested before developing new ideas. Thus, though he had been a supporter of Melanie Klein's speculations on the early development of mind, he later launched trenchant criticisms on her work. In this he was joined by Melanie Klein's daughter, Melita Schmideberg, who had entered analysis with him; their alliance raised considerable hostility. He considered that Klein's speculations about the infant's early mental development were unscientific and incompatible with Freud's theories and that, therefore, the society, which he alleged was being taken over by Mrs Klein's followers, was no longer a Freudian society. His many contributions to the controversial discussions of the British Psycho-Analytical Society show his considerable polemical skills which he did not hesitate to use when challenged. Schmideberg was so exaggerated and hostile in her attacks that it was not possible to differentiate real causes for concern from mischief making. Glover himself, according to the psychoanalytic historian R. Steiner, became out of touch with historical reality, his forecasts being apocalyptic and ferociously one-sided.<br>
<br>Glover resigned from the British Psycho-Analytic Society in 1944, no longer able to accept what he considered major deviations of Freudian psychoanalysis, particularly from the Klein school. Playing second-in-command to Jones for decades, his ambition to succeed Jones as president of the society was doomed by his polemics against those who did not agree with his views on what constituted Freudian psychoanalysis. He became a member of the Swiss Psychoanalytic Society and an honorary member of the American Psychoanalytic Association.<br>
<br>Glover's achievements lay in four areas. First he pioneered psychoanalytic research on delinquency and criminology and was a founder of the Institute for Scientific Treatment of Delinquency, later the Portman Clinic. His <span class="italic">Diagnosis of Delinquency</span> appeared in 1944. He was also the founder and editor of the <span class="italic">British Journal of Criminology</span>. Second, he insisted on psychoanalysis taking a serious attitude to research, both theoretical and technical. His 1932 enquiry into the practice of the British Psycho-Analytical Society, not published until 1940, revealed a great variability of theory and technique within the society. His important text, <span class="italic">The Technique of Psycho-Analysis</span>, was published in 1928. Third, he argued for high standards in psychoanalytic training and was active nationally and internationally, being vice-president and honorary secretary of the International Psycho-Analytical Association. He was chairman of the training committee of the British Psycho-Analytical Society and acting chairman during the Second World War. Fourth, he attempted prematurely to develop a psychoanalytic diagnostic schema for mental disorders. His most original contribution was his theory of the early development of mind in which he postulated ego nuclei of experience gradually coalescing and integrating into a unitary ego. This work predated many later ideas in this area. His writings also included <span class="italic">War, Sadism and Pacifism</span> (1933), <span class="italic">Psychoanalysis: a Handbook for Medical Practitioners and Students of Comparative Psychology</span> (1939), and <span class="italic">Exceptional Children</span> (1960).<br>
<br>Glover's first marriage was in 1918 to Christine Margaret Speir, who died in childbirth the same year with a stillborn son; his second marriage, on 15 July 1924, was to Gladys (1887/8&#150;1966), daughter of Robert Blair; their one daughter was born mentally handicapped. Her parents gave her great devotion, which, however, led them into a considerable degree of social isolation. Gladys Glover died in 1966 after three years of painful illness from a brain tumour.<br>
<br>Glover and Ernest Jones fought for the acceptance of psychoanalysis within the scientific community of Great Britain; the British Medical Association report of 1929 achieved partial recognition. Glover's most permanent achievement, outlasting his polemics against Jung and Klein, was the establishment of psychoanalytic investigation and treatment of delinquency which was the origin of forensic psychotherapy. A formidable figure to those who knew him only in public, in private Glover was known for his kindness, cordiality, and Scottish humour. He died in London on 16 August 1972.<br>
