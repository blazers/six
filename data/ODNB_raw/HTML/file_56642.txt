<span class="headword">Scholefield,  James</span>  (1790&#150;1855), <span class="occ">political reformer</span>, was born at Colne Bridge, in the parish of Kirkheaton, near Huddersfield, Yorkshire, on 6 April 1790, the son of Daniel Scholefield and his wife, Rebecca. He attended the Salford Academy of Sciences in Manchester, established by William Cowherd, founder of a schismatic Swedenborgian sect known as the Bible Christians (Cowherdites). In 1813 Scholefield was ordained as a minister in the sect and served at Christ Church, Hulme, until 1823.<br>
<br>Scholefield's radicalism developed in the aftermath of the French wars. He was reported to the Home Office as an &#145;ultra-radical&#146; early in 1817 and he was present at the Peterloo massacre in 1819. He condemned the yeomanry cavalry and was appalled by the clergymen who supported them. When a Wesleyan minister published a &#145;patriotic sermon&#146; in defence of the authority, Scholefield responded with a tract <span class="italic">Remarks on the Sermon Preached by the Rev. John Stephens</span> (1819) in which he identified the <span class="roman">Bible</span> as the pre-eminent source of the &#145;rights of man&#146;. In March 1820 he gave evidence on behalf of Henry Hunt at his state trial and later in 1820 he was prominent among the local &#145;friends of Queen Caroline&#146;, touring Lancashire preaching sermons for her deliverance. In 1821 he married Charlotte Armstrong Walker (1805&#150;1835), with whom he had eight children.<br>
<br>In 1823 Scholefield founded the Round Chapel in Ancoats, remaining there until his death. He lived next to the chapel. Like Cowherd he gained a reputation as an apothecary with a special gift for healing, running a popular surgery dispensing medicines. He also shared with his mentor a deep commitment to education and operated a school at his chapel for many years, his son and daughter also taking part in the teaching. During a four-month period in 1835 he suffered the deaths of his wife and their three youngest children.<br>
<br>In 1833 Scholefield was involved in the radical agitation which successfully denied the Anglican church in Manchester the power to levy a church rate. He represented Ancoats on the Manchester police commission between 1833 and 1836 and again between 1839 and 1842. He was known for his philanthropy, distributing poor relief and campaigning against the introduction of the new poor law, continuing to oppose it long after others had given up the fight. As an opponent of the corn laws, he attended the Anti-Corn Law League's national conference of ministers in 1841.<br>
<br>In March 1835 Scholefield hosted a meeting of radicals who determined to erect a monument to commemorate Henry Hunt, which was subsequently erected in the burial ground of the Round Chapel. Feargus O'Connor's visit to Manchester in 1835, at the inaugural meeting of the Manchester Radical Association, marked the beginning of a friendship between the two men. Scholefield welcomed him, and was in turn labelled by O'Connor the &#145;chaplain of the Manchester Chartists&#146;. He became most prominent as a leading figure in the Chartist movement in Lancashire. His chapel was the venue for a national Chartist conference during the &#145;plug&#146; riots in August 1842. Although he was not an official delegate, he was tried for sedition and conspiracy along with O'Connor and others, but was acquitted in the trial held at Lancaster in March 1843. He remained an active Chartist, becoming a shareholder in the People's Hall in Ancoats and a promoter of the Chartist Land Company.<br>
<br>Scholefield's rationalist heterodox theology and belief in public duty continued to draw him into reform causes. He promoted teetotalism and vegetarianism&#151;both of which were advocated by the Bible Christians&#151;becoming in 1847 a founder member of the Manchester Vegetarian Society. He was also a leader of the movement for reducing workers' hours. He remained active in local government: although he had criticized the inadequacy of Manchester's charter of incorporation in the late 1830s, he served two terms as an elected town councillor (1847&#150;1853), concentrating on piecemeal objectives such as sewerage and street paving.<br>
<br>In 1851 Scholefield was a founding member of the Manchester branch of the Parliamentary and Financial Reform Association, which sought an extension of the franchise and reduction in government expenditure and taxation. The association brought together middle- and working-class radicals, and led to a split in the ranks of Chartism. His involvement signalled a transition to the ranks of nineteenth-century liberalism, which caused him to quarrel with some of his former colleagues, but this did little to dent his popularity in the community that he served with distinction. He died in Manchester on 24 April 1855, and was buried in Every Street churchyard, Ancoats.<br>
