<span class="headword">Savage,  Thomas</span>  (1651/2&#150;1668), <span class="occ">apprentice and murderer</span>, was said to have been born in the parish of St Giles-in-the-Fields, London. All that is known about his early life is that his father, John, a brewer or alehouse keeper, died when he was young, his mother remarried, and his parents &#145;endeavoured to have their son well-educated&#146;  (<span class="italic">God's Justice</span>, 2). In December 1666 he was apprenticed to Francis Collins, a vintner who lived at the Ship tavern at Ratcliff Cross in Stepney. He apparently led a dissolute life, and frequented a nearby brothel, where he consorted with Hannah Blay. When he ran out of money on Sunday 28 June 1668, Blay is reported to have encouraged him to steal from his master. When he said this was not possible because a maidservant was always present in the house Blay told him to &#145;knock her on the head&#146;  (<span class="italic">God's Justice</span>, 3&#150;4). That afternoon Savage found himself alone with the servant, Judith Jones, alias Benson, and attacked her repeatedly with a hammer. She died from the wounds three days later. He broke open his master's cupboard, stole &pound;62, and fled, but was apprehended on 29 June and was committed to Newgate prison. He then implicated Blay, who was committed that same day. He was tried at the Old Bailey on 24 October and was sentenced to death. On 28 October, aged sixteen, he was hanged outside the scene of the crime in Ratcliff. The body was taken down and carried to a tavern, where signs of life were detected. He recovered, but was hanged a second time four hours later. He is said to have been buried in Islington, where his mother then lived, but perhaps because he was an executed felon the burial did not take place in the church grounds. Blay, who was sentenced to death at the same sessions, pleaded pregnancy and was reprieved. She was hanged in the same place on 26 February 1669.<br>
<br>This was an atypical murder for the time in that the offenders were so young, it took place in a private house, and the assault was unprovoked (most murders occurred in taverns or outdoors, in the context of arguments and fights). It must have shocked contemporaries; it attracted the attention of five nonconformist clergymen (Hugh Baker, Thomas Doolittle, Robert Franklin, James Janeway, and Thomas Vincent) as well as one other contemporary and several subsequent publishers of criminal biographies, who saw in this case a morality tale indicating the causes of sin and the possibilities of repentance. All accounts ascribe Savage's downfall to his initial sins of sabbath breaking and frequenting alehouses, and document his redemption through spiritual conversion while awaiting trial. This was the typical narrative of murderers' lives found in criminal biographies of the time; the clergymen's pamphlet, <span class="italic">A Murderer Punished, and Pardoned</span>, which forms the basis of all subsequent published accounts, appropriated this genre to demonstrate the power of puritan godliness. These pamphlets, which are the primary source of information concerning Savage's life, are thus of limited reliability for that purpose. Although the basic facts of the case are confirmed in the judicial records, there is at least one significant difference: while the published accounts indicate that he confessed the crime when he appeared at the Old Bailey (a sign he acknowledged his sins), his indictment indicates that he pleaded innocent. There are other hints that his conversion was incomplete: he was said to be drunk at his trial, and to have struggled with the executioner when he was hanged the second time.<br>
<br>Accounts of the Savage case were frequently reprinted. <span class="italic">A Murderer Punished, and Pardoned</span> went through thirteen editions to 1708. In 1710, at a time when the societies for the reformation of manners were engaged in a vigorous campaign against profanation of the sabbath, another account of the case was published which went through twenty-two editions in twenty-five years. In 1734 the story was guaranteed lasting fame when it was included in Charles Johnson's <span class="italic">A general history of the lives and adventures of the most famous highwaymen, murderers, street-robbers, etc</span>.<br>
