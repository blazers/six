<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Home,  Henry</span>, Lord Kames  (1696&#150;1782), <span class="occ">judge and writer</span>, was born at Kames, near Duns, Berwickshire, the first son of George Home of Kames (<i>d</i>. 1741) and his wife, Agnes (<i>b</i>. 1675), daughter of John Walkinshaw of Barrowfield, near Glasgow. His father was an impecunious border laird, much burdened by debt and a large family (by 1715 he had nine children). Home was educated at home by private tutors, first John Wingate and then a Mr Anderson, who taught him Greek, Latin, mathematics, and natural philosophy. Both tutors were nonjuring clergymen. Aged sixteen Home was apprenticed to John Dickson, a Berwickshire neighbour, who was a writer to the signet in Edinburgh. He also enrolled at the private civil law college of James Craig. Two years of learning law by rote followed, but then came an important switch in direction into advocacy. It was prompted, or so Home said, by a chance visit to the home of Sir Hew Dalrymple, lord president of the court of session, whose affluent lifestyle whetted Home's appetite for a branch of the legal profession in which the returns to the successful were so very much more obvious. He continued to study with Craig for a further year, but having resolved on the change to advocacy, he had to make up the deficiencies in his education, notably in the classics, although he also took up French and Italian. Home was a prodigiously hard worker, a man of energy and drive to complement his native intelligence, and after a public examination on 19 January 1723, he was duly admitted to the Faculty of Advocates three days later.<h2>
<a name="Earlycareer"></a>Early career</h2>Home lacked a powerful patron so the early years of his practice as an advocate proved difficult. At first he seems to have led a carefree existence, but he soon found himself in debt and had to concentrate on establishing a career. He gained little employment, but was able in his free time to continue his education, and he also began to play a role in the Faculty of Advocates. In January 1725 his name appears on the faculty's list of public examinators for the first time. He also began to write on legal topics. His <span class="italic">Remarkable Decisions of the Court of Session from 1716 to 1728</span> (1728) was followed by a stream of further writings, which helped both to chart the development of the Scottish legal system in this period and to shape it. He was first taken notice of at the bar in the bankruptcy case of Charles Belches in 1730, owing to the efficient job he made of scheduling the debts on the estate which earned the congratulation of the presiding judge, Sir Gilbert Elliot, second baronet, Lord Minto. No doubt in order to supplement his income, in August 1732 he applied unsuccessfully for the chair in Roman law at the University of Edinburgh, vacant by the death of his old teacher, James Craig. His application was coterminous with the publication of <span class="italic">Essays upon Several Subjects in Law</span> (1732), which demonstrated the philosophical cast of his approach to the law.<br>
<br>By 1736 Home had acquired a reasonable legal practice. In July 1736 he was defence counsel in the high profile trial of Captain John Porteous. Following the lynching of Porteous by the Edinburgh mob, the subsequent inquiry at Westminster sent for Home, who spent April and May 1737 in London although he was not called upon to give evidence. He took the opportunity to call upon Dr Joseph Butler, author of <span class="italic">Analogy of Religion</span>, for conversation on deism and Christianity. The appointment in 1737 of his friend Charles Erskine as lord advocate led to his own appointment as advocate-depute. He continued to write, and in 1741 published <span class="italic">Decisions of the court of session, from its first institution to the present time. Abridged and digested under heads in the form of a dictionary</span>, in two volumes. This had originated as an idea of an Edinburgh bookseller, who had approached Home on the recommendation of the Faculty of Advocates when his first author withdrew. The combination of abridgements of reports and accounts of issues of law in one dictionary had proved popular in England, but Home used the dictionary to emphasize his belief that the reasons upon which judges made their decisions must be examined, and that precedent was worthless if the decision was founded upon wrong principles. Two further volumes were published in 1778 and 1797, edited by Alexander Fraser Tytler.<h2>
<a name="Marriageandthebench"></a>Marriage and the bench</h2>In April 1741 Home's father died. This was followed by Home's marriage on 24 August 1741, &#145;at the prudent age of forty-seven&#146;  (Chambers, Scots., 275), to Agatha (1711&#150;1795), daughter of James Drummond of Blair Drummond, Perthshire, with a portion of &pound;1000. They had one son, George, born in November 1743, and one daughter, Jean, born in 1744. During the Jacobite rising of 1745 Home stayed at Kames, surely the action of a prudent man, given that he had been accused of Jacobite sympathies in the past. Enforced absence from Edinburgh, where the courts were not sitting, led Home to write another book, published in 1747 as <span class="italic">Essays upon Several Subjects Concerning British Antiquities</span>, which eventually went through four editions. It contained several pieces critical of Jacobite political thought. In August 1746 he subscribed &pound;300 to the British Linen Company, a key project of Archibald Campbell, third duke of Argyll, and Andrew Fletcher, Lord Milton, important members of the Scottish whig establishment.<br>
<br>Home was now a candidate for the Scottish bench. Upon the death of James Graham, Lord Easdale, in August 1750, the duke of Argyll recommended Home for the vacant seat on the Scottish bench, but to no avail. The next vacancy occurred in August 1751, but Home's promotion was delayed by a political smear that his father had been a Jacobite&#151;in fact George Home had been in arms for the Hanoverians in 1715. Although his maternal uncle John Walkinshaw had been an active Jacobite (Clementine Walkinshaw, mistress of Prince Charles Edward Stuart, was Home's first cousin), this smear was easily refuted, and Home was appointed an ordinary lord of session on 6 February 1752, taking the title Lord Kames. In consequence of his appointment, he resigned as a public examinator and as a member of the council of the dean of the Faculty of Advocates.<br>
<br>Kames's next published work, <span class="italic">Essays on the Principles of Morality and Natural Religion</span> (1751), produced a furore among the more high-flying members of the Scottish church, and there were some who wished to see the author excommunicated. Kames's friendship with, and support for, David Hume made him a target, although the <span class="italic">Essays</span> were not an uncritical endorsement of Hume's views. Kames's fault was to suggest that man had a &#145;deceitful &hellip; feeling of liberty&#146;  (Ross, 103)&#151;that all was determined, but that this was not evident to men who made choices as if they were free. At the general assembly of the Church of Scotland in May 1755 Kames escaped censure by name as that body contented itself with generalities. However, the controversy did cause Kames to rethink some of his more controversial opinions, which appeared in December 1756 as <span class="italic">Objections Against the &#145;Essays on Morality and Religion&#146; Examined</span>. However, he retained a dislike of the &#145;popular Scottish clergy&#146;  (Ross, 165) and what he perceived as their bigotry and intolerance.<br>
<br>After Kames's promotion to the bench, other appointments followed: to the commission for forfeited estates (1752), to the board of trustees for fisheries and manufactures (1754), and as a director of the British Linen Company (1754&#150;6). In May 1754 Kames became a founder member of the Select Society and its offshoot, the Edinburgh Society for Encouraging Arts, Sciences, Manufactures, and Agriculture in Scotland, which were part of the flourishing intellectual life of Edinburgh. In 1755 he served as vice-president of the Philosophical Society, having been involved with that body and its forerunners since the 1730s.<br>
<br>Kames was still ambitious for advancement in the legal profession. In 1759 he was disappointed not to be chosen to succeed Sir James Fergusson, second baronet, Lord Kilkerran, on the justiciary court. This prompted him to return to his literary efforts and in 1760 he published <span class="italic">Principles of Equity</span>, his principal work in the eyes of Scottish legal historians. It drew on an extensive body of historical and philosophical material, and made comparisons with theory and practice in England: he considered that each legal system could learn with advantage from the other. Although it was a theoretical work, Kames also dealt with practical issues, including the rules relating to bankruptcy. The work was well received, not least by William Murray, Baron Mansfield, lord chief justice of the king's bench in England, who in a letter to Kames in February 1762 regretted the lack of any equivalent English writer: &#145;I wish we had a pen and genius and diligence like your lordship's to do it&#146;  (Ross, 238). A second edition appeared in 1767, and a third in 1778, with a section on workers' combinations, then an issue very much under discussion.<br>
<br>In 1761 Kames befriended the young James Boswell, then in Edinburgh studying to be an advocate, in what can be seen as the latest of a long line of friendships with able younger men which began in the 1730s and included David Hume, Adam Smith, and the poet William Hamilton as well as foreign dignitaries such as Benjamin Franklin who visited Kames in 1759. It is Boswell who provided much intimate and colourful detail on Kames. He recognized the formidable powers of concentration deployed by the judge to secure his professional advancement: &#145;women and wine are only your amusements and mislead you no more from your main aims than an evening walk or a game at whist&#146;  (Ross, 90).<br>
<br>In <span class="italic">Elements of Criticism</span> (1762) Kames sought to propound the fundamental principles of criticism drawn from human nature. That year saw Kames's involvement in one legal case and the beginning of another with which his name would be associated. In January 1762 Kames found in favour of Peter Williamson, who had been kidnapped as a boy some twenty years earlier by local merchants in Aberdeen and sent to North America. On his return to Scotland, Williamson had told the story of the trade in boys, which brought down on him the wrath of the Aberdeen mercantile community, outraged by the slur on them. Williamson was forced by the magistrates of Aberdeen to disown his account and was temporarily gaoled. However, on being reunited with his relatives he took the magistrates before the court of session and won damages. December 1762 saw the beginning of the &#145;Douglas cause&#146; before the court of session, between rival claimants to the vast Douglas inheritance. It continued before the court in July 1767 when Kames supported the claim of Archibald Douglas against that of James George Hamilton, seventh duke of Hamilton, before being settled on appeal to the House of Lords in February 1769.<br>
<br>Kames finally reached the criminal court following his appointment on 15 April 1763 as a commissioner of justiciary, taking his seat on 3 May. This also meant going on circuit. His favourite circuit was the northern, including sittings at Perth, Inverness, and Aberdeen, but he also took his turn on the two other circuits, the western and the southern. Kames had the reputation as a judge keen to secure convictions, with a somewhat cruel wit: according to George Fergusson, later Lord Hermand, defence counsel in the case, in 1780 he greeted a verdict against Matthew Hay, an old chess partner found guilty of murder, with the quip, &#145;that's checkmate to you, Matthew!&#146;  (Ross, 311).<h2>
<a name="Industrialandagriculturalimprovement"></a>Industrial and agricultural improvement</h2>In 1764 and 1765 Kames was the central figure in the committee of proprietors appointed by the British Linen Company to review its affairs and which produced a report which saved the company from financial disaster. The encouragement of linen was the central element of the government's strategy for the economic development and political passivity of Scotland, particularly the highlands. Kames was to become an expert in the possibilities and problems of this industry, publishing an anonymous pamphlet, <span class="italic">Progress of Flax-Husbandry in Scotland</span> (1766). He explained that he regarded linen as Scotland's principal manufacture stimulating the circulation of currency, and providing work for otherwise idle hands. Kames was most involved through his membership of the board of trustees for fisheries, manufactures, and improvements in Scotland, although the commission for forfeited estates also took an interest. He used a network of correspondents to get first-hand expert advice for the board, corresponding with William Cullen about the chemistry of linen bleaching, with William Tod over the quality of Scottish linen on sale at London, and with George Young of Coupar Angus on the role of small merchants and hawkers. Not all of his suggestions and proposals turned out well. The Linen Hall established at Edinburgh in 1766, which was a scheme that Kames persuaded the board of trustees to support with the intention of assisting individual linen dealers against large wholesalers, proved an expensive failure, but it was widely approved by experienced merchants in the trade whom Kames had consulted.<br>
<br>Kames continued his legal writing during this period. In 1766 he published a further volume of <span class="italic">Remarkable Decisions of the Court of Session</span>, covering the period 1730 to 1752; his work in collecting decisions of the court was ongoing, and <span class="italic">Select Decisions of the Court of Session</span>, covering the period from 1752 to 1768, appeared in 1780. After 1768 the court of session appointed a clerk to take over Kames's work.<br>
<br>In 1766 the death of her brother and his infant son saw Kames's wife inherit Blair Drummond, in Perthshire but near Stirling, an estate worth nearly &pound;2000 per annum. Henceforth his wife was known as Mrs Home Drummond, and the double surname was adopted by their descendants in the male line. This estate was to provide a focus of Kames's quest for agricultural improvement, setting in train a scheme to clear moss land of its unproductive top layers of moss and peat. His enthusiasm for improvement bore fruit with the publication of a 400-page tome, <span class="italic">The Gentleman Farmer</span>, in 1776. This book offered both an attempt to bring together agricultural change and technique into a coherent theoretical system and some very practical observations based on experience about crops, rotations, buildings, and stock. He observed how much progress there had been, and how very different the condition of agriculture in Scotland was from forty years previously, but called for the creation of a board for improving agriculture: centralized direction had benefited the linen industry, and would, in his view, do the same for agriculture. In 1778 the <span class="italic">Present State of Husbandry in Scotland</span> was published. This was the result of an initiative from Kames in the commission for forfeited estates to authorize a series of surveys in the highlands to investigate what agricultural practice was in the north and how it might be improved. Kames wrote the preface in which he welcomed turnpike roads, bridge construction, and canal projects as measures to promote development. In 1777 Kames published his last legal book in what had become a prolific and significant career as a writer on Scots law, <span class="italic">Elucidations Respecting the Common and Statute Law of Scotland</span>. This was a detailed and systematic analysis, with a strong autobiographical flavour, of areas which had long exercised his mind such as how to rank creditors on a bankrupt estate. His last major work was <span class="italic">Loose Hints on Education, Chiefly Concerning the Culture of Children</span> (1781), which with its emphasis on training to develop sensibility unsurprisingly drew the criticism that it showed a lack of respect to Christianity.<h2>
<a name="Deathandfamily"></a>Death and family</h2>In October 1782 Kames's son, George, married Janet Jardine at Blair Drummond. By December Kames was visibly ailing. On 21 December Boswell recorded his last appearance in the court of session: &#145;like a ghost, shaking hands with Lord Kennet in the chair, and lords Alva and Eskgrove patting him kindly on the back as if for the last time&#146;  (Ross, 370). Traditionally, Kames's parting from his fellow judges was recorded with his characteristic earthiness as &#145;fare ye a' weel, ye bitches&#146;  (Ross, 370). Kames died on 27 December 1782 at his house in New Street, Canongate, Edinburgh. He was buried at Blair Drummond, probably on 30 December 1782. His wife died on 18 June 1795.<br>
<br>Kames was succeeded in his estate by his son, George, who had been educated away from his father's eye at St Andrews University, followed by the grand tour and a period in business in London. He had then taken over as laird of Blair Drummond, where he completed the work of his father in draining the moss land by utilizing Meikle's great wheel which he had installed in 1787. Kames's daughter, Jean, married in 1761, and within a month she had embarked on an affair with James Boswell. After that ended, other affairs followed, and in January 1772 her husband obtained a divorce on the grounds of adultery. Kames found the court proceedings wounding with her own servants giving evidence against her, and he could not forgive Jean, whom he sent away to France. Father and daughter were never reconciled, and Jean receives no recognition on the family memorial in the churchyard of Kincardine in Menteith.<br>
<br>Kames was a striking figure physically&#151;it was said that he was tall enough to have made a Prussian guard&#151;and robust featured. He was bitingly sharp tongued and on occasion showed the warmth of temper to which the epitaph raised by his son refers. He could and did blow hot and cold, and could be by turns convivial and studious, sentimental and clear eyed, coarse and refined, vain and quirky. As a writer on Scots law his output of eight books plus essays and collections was prolific and significant, even if his style of writing lacked fluency. In John Ramsay of Ouchertyre's judgement had Kames devoted himself fully to the law, he would have been one of the greatest and most enlightened judges of his time. As it was, he made important contributions to many other areas of Scottish life.<br>
