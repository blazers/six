<span class="headword">Howard <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Carey]</span>,  Katherine</span>, countess of Nottingham  (1545<span class="mult">x</span>50&#150;1603), <span class="occ">courtier</span>, was the eldest daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/4649/', "Henry Carey, later first Baron Hunsdon (1526&#150;1596)")</script>, and his wife, Anne (<i>d</i>. 1607), daughter of Sir Thomas Morgan of Arkstone, Herefordshire. Since she is not included in the list of nativities of their children that starts in 1551, Katherine was presumably born between 1545, when they married, and 1550. Her parents' marriage was a consequence of their connection to Princess Elizabeth: as well as being Elizabeth's first cousin, Carey was a gentleman of her household by 1551, while Anne Morgan was the granddaughter of Blanche, Lady Herbert of Troy, the princess's lady mistress from 1537 to 1546. After 1559 the Careys were treated as members of the extended royal family. It is possible that Katherine joined Elizabeth's household at Hatfield in 1556&#150;8, for although no older than fifteen, she was appointed a gentlewoman of the privy chamber on 30 January 1560. A chance reference to Elizabeth's disguising herself as Kate Carey's maid to watch Lord Robert Dudley shoot at Windsor in November 1561 reveals her as one of Elizabeth's early intimates. In July 1563 Katherine married the lord chamberlain's son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13885/', "Charles Howard, later second Baron Howard of Effingham and first earl of Nottingham (1536&#150;1624)")</script>, one of the defining alliances of the Elizabethan court. The disappearance of the Howard of Effingham papers makes their married life impossible to reconstruct, but she and Howard had at least two sons, William, third Baron Howard of Effingham (<i>b</i>. 1577), and Charles (<i>b</i>. 1579), and three daughters, including the queen's goddaughter, Elizabeth, who was a maid of honour by 1579 and married Sir Robert Southwell on 17 April 1583. Howard made her executor of the will he drafted on going to sea in 1588 and left her a life interest in the lordship of Esher. Like other gentlewomen of the privy chamber Katherine was given custody of some of the queen's jewels and the book of them, mainly new year's gifts received between 1572 and 1587, survives (BL, Sloane MS 814). In March 1579 the Spanish ambassador reported her as presiding over the table of the ladies of the privy chamber and by 1589 she was the senior gentlewoman, yet she does not appear to have been as active a patronage broker as some of her colleagues. In 1591 Elizabeth gave her the manor of Chelsea, which she and her husband had leased earlier.<br>
<br>As Elizabeth's other intimates died off, Katherine and her family became steadily more entrenched at the centre of the court. Her husband (briefly) and then her father and brother all served as lord chamberlain, her younger sister Philadelphia, Lady Scrope, and her daughter Frances, countess of Kildare, joined her in the privy chamber (though without wages) and her granddaughter Elizabeth, &#145;fair young Mrs Southwell&#146; (who later eloped with Sir Robert Dudley), became a maid of honour in 1599  (<span class="italic">Letters</span>, ed. Collins, 2.141). However, Katherine's health deteriorated sharply in late 1601 and she went into a steady decline, dying at Arundel House on 24 February 1603 after suffering numerous &#145;fits&#146;. Immediately afterwards gossip circulated that she had left secret riches, but the story that on her deathbed she revealed to Elizabeth that in 1601 she and her husband had deliberately destroyed the earl of Essex, by secreting a ring he had sent the queen to save his life, is apocryphal, as Lytton Strachey proved. More significantly, Elizabeth was said to have been more distressed by Katherine's death than her husband was, and her melancholy led to her own demise a month later. Katherine was buried at All Saints, Chelsea (Chelsea Old Church), on 25th April, three days before Elizabeth's funeral, but no monument appears to have been erected.<br>
