<span class="headword">Ross,  Walter</span>  (1738&#150;1789), <span class="occ">lawyer</span>, was born on 28 September 1738 in Edinburgh, the son of Charles Ross, merchant, and his wife, Mary Law. Little is known of Ross's early years or schooling. In early manhood he was apprenticed to John Russell of Roseburne, writer to the signet, and was admitted a member of the Society of Writers to the Signet on 25 June 1764. In the course of his apprenticeship, Ross would have attended classes in Scots and Roman law in the University of Edinburgh. Perhaps through the connection of his apprentice master, who was secretary to the Royal Bank of Scotland, as well as his own talent, Ross established a successful practice. At some point after his prosperity was assured, Ross acquired St Bernard's House, a large home in an irregular architectural style in what was then open country near the Water of Leith at Stockbridge, about 2 miles from the centre of Edinburgh. There he lived with his wife, Margaret Moubray.<br>
<br>With the leisure of wealth, Ross devoted time to writing about the law. In 1783 and 1784 he gave a series of private lectures on the law of conveyancing in Scotland to apprentices of the Society of Writers to the Signet. These were well received but not repeated, perhaps because of the onset of the ill health which dogged Ross's later years. They were published posthumously in 1792 as <span class="italic">Lectures on the history and practice of the law of Scotland relative to conveyancing and legal diligence</span>. These lectures were the first attempt to state this branch of the law of Scotland in a coherent and comprehensible way, for Ross believed that &#145;styles and forms could not be understood without some acquaintance with the ancient customs manners and history both civil and ecclesiastical&#146;  (Walker, 273). In this, he paved the way for the work of Robert Bell. Later commentators have referred to Ross's <span class="italic">Lectures</span> as being of high authority and entitled to respect&#151;not least because of the regular references to it in the court of session during the great property litigations of the nineteenth century.<br>
<br>Ross was also an antiquarian and a patron of the arts, assembling a collection of paintings and antiquities of some note. In the grounds of his home he erected a replica of a Scottish fortified tower (now demolished) which was known to locals as &#145;Ross's folly&#146;. He died suddenly at his home on 11 March 1789, local lore having it that he did so in a fit of laughter. He was buried on 19 March 1789, in his own grounds next to his folly, to be reinterred in St Cuthbert's churchyard, Edinburgh, in 1818.<br>
