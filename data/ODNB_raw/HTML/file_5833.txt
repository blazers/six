<span class="headword">Colbatch, Sir  John</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1666?, <em>d.</em> 1729), <span class="occ">physician</span>, was probably the son of William Colbatch baptized at St Swithin's, Worcester, on 1 August 1666. John Colbatch began as an apothecary's apprentice in Worcester, gradually rising to the rank of master in the Mercers' Company (to which the apothecaries belonged); he moved from Worcester to London some time in the early 1690s. By the autumn of 1693 Colbatch was beginning to be known for his proprietary Vulnerary Powder and Tincture of the Sulphur of Venus, which he claimed to have found empirically through his own studies, chemical experiments, and other experiments on dogs and other animals. The first remedy he promoted as being able to stop bleeding quickly even in very bad wounds, the second as restoring wounded flesh. The London surgical establishment evinced sceptical interest, and a public trial of his medicines was carried out on a dog; as reported by William Cowper  (<span class="italic">PTRS</span>, 18, 1694, 42&#150;4), the experiment performed on the dog was successful, but the subsequent trial on two patients of St Bartholomew's Hospital failed. In response to Colbatch's counter-claim that his envious rivals were lying about the results on the humans, Charles Bernard arranged for yet another experiment on patients at St Bartholomew's, but again it failed: Colbatch explained that the associate of his who had been present had not been allowed to use his remedy properly. Early in 1694, with the help of a patron among the army officers, Colbatch was allowed to try his wound remedies on soldiers, claiming to have performed a hundred experiments with only five miscarrying, for which failures he blamed his opponents. He obtained a pass from the government in May 1694 to go to the summer campaign in Flanders. There Major-General Sir Henry Bellasis arranged for wounded men to be treated by Colbatch; despite continued harassment from the surgeons, only one of them died. Colbatch published <span class="italic">Novum lumen chirurgicum, or, A New Light of Chirurgery</span> (1695), a book about his successes, shortly after his return from campaign, and claimed to have survived a surgeon's attempt to poison him. The surgeons replied with a pamphlet of their own  (W. W., <span class="italic">Novum lumen chirurgicum extinctum</span>, 1695), lambasting Colbatch and claiming his powder to be nothing more than dried &#145;Vitriol of Copper &hellip; which hath a small Mixture of Iron&#146;, and his tincture to be &#145;a Mixture of Oil of Vitriol, and Spirit of Wine&#146;. Colbatch defended himself with yet another pamphlet (<span class="italic">Novum lumen chirurgicum vindicatum</span>, 1695), and by returning to Flanders in the summer of 1695, where he may even have gained the position of local surgeon-general during the siege of Namur.<br>
<br>Colbatch moved to gain further legitimacy in 1696 by selling off his secrets to his publisher, Daniel Brown, who made and marketed the medicines. During the summer he began the process of gaining the licence of the Royal College of Physicians, and on 14 and 23 August, and 11 September 1696, he underwent the formal examinations in physiology, pathology, and therapeutics. He was admitted as a licentiate on 22 December 1696. Colbatch now sought to publish books setting out a rationale for why his medicines worked. His <span class="italic">Physico-Medical Essay Concerning Alkaly and Acid</span> (1696), and <span class="italic">Some Farther Considerations Concerning Alkaly and Acid</span> (1696), explained physiology and therapeutics in the light of the doctrine of acids and alkalis, which was more widely accepted on the continent than in England. But Colbatch's views, in arguing that acids rather than alkalis cured disease, were even more unorthodox, placing him among the few other advocates of acids, such as Edward Baynard and William Cole. He presented his claims in the language of the new and experimental philosophy, praising Robert Boyle especially, and argued for the usefulness of &#145;ocular demonstrations&#146; over university learning. In elaborating this doctrine in a book on gout, and in writing of the blindness of orthodox medical opinion, he came under censure from the physicians. Samuel Garth's mock-epic poem, the <span class="italic">Dispensary</span> (May 1699), mentioned Colbatch as a target of abuse. But Colbatch, who apparently enjoyed the patronage of at least one person of influence, brushed aside these assaults and continued to produce more books. Colbatch's publisher, Brown, brought out collections and editions of Colbatch's works in response to the publicity.<br>
<br>In the end Colbatch gained a social reputation as a good physician, and published only a few books more. In his <span class="italic">Dissertation Concerning Misletoe</span> (1719) he not only mentions the continued friendship of Dr Cole, and his own continued preference for the theory of acids, but describes himself as driving through the countryside in a carriage, thereby letting it be known that he had become well-to-do. Colbatch received a knighthood from George I on 26 June 1716. During the threatened plague epidemic of 1720&#150;21, Colbatch submitted an unexceptionable scheme for its prevention to the king and parliament. In 1723 he could afford to give &pound;50 to his manservant to set him up in business. Colbatch died on 15 January 1729. His will, witnessed by Sir Philip Boteler and Elizabeth Boteler of Teston, Kent, was probated in mid-March; he left all his estate to his wife, Elizabeth. After his death a manual of family medicine was published under his name.<br>
