<span class="headword">Walker,  Alexander Alfred</span>  (1930&#150;2003), <span class="occ">film critic and biographer</span>, was born on 22 March 1930 at Carleton Home, Portadown, co. Armagh, Northern Ireland, the son of Alfred Walker, commercial traveller, and his wife, Ethel Linda Harris, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Andrews. At the time of his birth his parents were living at 2 Erin Crescent, Portadown. He was educated at Portadown grammar school, the Queen's University, Belfast, where he took a degree in political philosophy, the Coll&egrave;ge d'Europe, Bruges, and the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. It had been his intention to become a diplomat, but his experience of the burgeoning international civil service at Bruges proved disillusioning. While teaching in America (he was a lecturer in political philosophy and comparative government at the University of Michigan from 1952 to 1954), and partly through a meeting in New York with the newspaper tycoon Lord Beaverbrook, he began to consider a career in journalism and the possibility of turning a long-standing passion for the cinema into a vocation. Returning to Britain he joined the <span class="italic">Birmingham Gazette</span> in 1954, and on its absorption by the <span class="italic">Birmingham Post</span> two years later he became a leader writer for that paper and its film critic. In 1960 he joined Beaverbrook's <span class="italic">Evening Standard</span> as film critic and remained in this position until his death. Over these years Walker became a pre-eminent figure in his profession despite writing for a newspaper that circulated only in the home counties. He was thrice named critic of the year in the British press awards, and was one of only three British film critics to have served on the jury at the Cannes film festival.<br>
<br>An only child of a middle-class protestant family, Walker grew up in a small Ulster town with three cinemas, and this background shaped his view of the world and his approach to the movies. The &#145;fillums&#146;, as he continued to call them with the slight Irish accent that never left him, were &#145;consolation entertainment&#146; for the strait-laced protestant majority that lacked the fortifying &#145;performance culture&#146; of the Roman Catholics in their midst  (Walker, 4). In his schooldays the young Walker appeared in Northern Ireland contributions to the BBC's <span class="italic">Children's Hour</span>, which prepared the way for him to become a fluent and confident broadcaster as an adult. From the age of four he was a voracious cinema-goer, initially accompanied by a doting mother and a compliant &#145;maidservant-cum-nanny&#146;  (ibid.). In his early teens he developed a discriminating perception of film through reading C. A. Lejeune in <span class="italic">The Observer</span>, Dilys Powell in the <span class="italic">Sunday Times</span>, and the few serious books on the cinema available in his local library. His time in the United States and a spell of psychoanalysis helped him understand the connection between Hollywood cinema, politics, and the aspirations and anxieties of the cinema-going public. The association with Beaverbrook, with whom he established an amusing, dangerously poised relationship, made him understand the need to entertain a popular readership; the protestant work ethic in which he was reared compelled him to approach his job with dedication and treat the film industry with appropriate seriousness.<br>
<br>Walker was the youngest film critic of a major newspaper when he first took his seat at London press shows. When he died he was the oldest and longest-serving member of a critical fraternity that had become larger (through the addition of reviewers from radio, TV, listings magazines, websites, and free sheets), and increasingly raffish and indiscriminate. With his grey, neatly coiffed hairdo (bouffant to add to his slightly less than average height), he came to cut a self-consciously anachronistic figure in his white collars, silk ties, bespoke suits, and well-polished shoes. He never wore a hat, never carried anything other than a newspaper or a bag from Fortnum and Mason's or Hatchard's, and his umbrellas were models of miniaturization. His legendary anti-smoking campaign (which occasionally led to fracas in the foyer and once came near the courtroom) had its slogan on his telephone answering machine: &#145;And remember, smoking is the slow way to suicide.&#146;<br>
<br>From his earliest days in London, Walker stood apart from the throng. He became friends with film-makers, his particular acquaintances in the industry being Stanley Kubrick and Peter Sellers, and he wrote books about both. He was a genial presence among his colleagues, although he eschewed membership of the Critics' Circle, but this very private person played an active role in film culture. He was an elected governor of the British Film Institute (1989&#150;95) and a member of numerous advisory bodies on the film industry, the arcane financing of which he understood better than any other critic. His private life, however, was as much a puzzle to those who thought they knew him well as it was a matter of speculation for the numerous people he estranged through his right-wing politics (he was deeply involved for a while with the Philippine dictator Ferdinand Marcos and his acquisitive wife Imelda), his often abrasive manner, his outspoken contributions to public forums, and his robust letters to the press. His mind instantly leapt from indignation to protest or litigation. He vigorously pursued numerous causes, his targets including film-makers who misrepresented events in Ulster, fellow travellers apologizing for left-wing totalitarian regimes, and public censors, whom he first excoriated for their severity before making a U-turn and attacking them for their leniency, especially towards screen violence.<br>
<br>Soon after arriving in London, Walker began writing books, all well researched, some scholarly (<span class="italic">The Shattered Silents</span>, 1978, his monograph on the arrival of sound film, for instance), none of them potboilers. His first book, <span class="italic">The Celluloid Sacrifice</span> (1965), published in paperback with the blunter title <span class="italic">Sex in the Movies</span>, concerned the difference between the real identity of stars and their screen personas, a subject close to his own life. He wrote a number of best-selling, widely translated biographies of such figures as Rudolph Valentino, Marlene Dietrich, Greta Garbo, Joan Crawford, Vivien Leigh, Rex Harrison, and Audrey Hepburn. These books provided the wherewithal to pursue the third of his major non-cinematic preoccupations. After serious wining-and-dining and skiing, this third obsession&#151;with the visual arts&#151;led to the accumulation of a magnificent collection of over 200 prints and drawings ranging from Matisse to Lucian Freud. For years these pictures covered every available wall space in his small, elegant flat, as well as being stacked in the bath and hallway. Their posthumous disposition became a matter of some discussion. Eventually they were left in his will to the British Museum. He died suddenly of a brain haemorrhage on 15 July 2003, while undergoing tests at the London Clinic, 20 Devonshire Place, Westminster. The funeral took place at Golders Green crematorium on 22 July 2003. He was unmarried. The exhibition of &#145;The Alexander Walker Bequest&#146; at the British Museum in 2004 attracted 180,000 visitors.<br>
