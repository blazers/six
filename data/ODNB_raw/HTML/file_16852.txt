<span class="headword">Lloyd, Sir  Richard</span>  (1606&#150;1676), <span class="occ">lawyer and politician</span>, was born on 23 February 1606, the first son of Evan Lloyd (<i>d</i>. 1626) of Dulasau, Penmachno, Caernarvonshire, and Janet (<i>fl</i>. 1585&#150;1630), daughter of Roderick ab Ieuan of Pennarth, Llanystumdwy, in the same county. He is probably the man of that name who entered Gray's Inn in 1618, matriculated from Wadham College, Oxford, in 1624, was called to the bar in 1635, and was made reader of Barnard's Inn in 1639. Having married Margaret (<i>d</i>. in or after 1650), daughter of Ralph Sneyd of Keele, Staffordshire, on 4 September 1632, he was employed on missions abroad in 1635&#150;6, after which the young lawyer seated himself at Esclusham near Wrexham in Denbighshire.<br>
<br>In the late 1630s Lloyd was granted the reversion to the office of prothonotary and clerk to the crown in Denbighshire and Montgomeryshire. After attending Charles I during the first bishops' war he was appointed attorney-general for north Wales and sat for Newcastle under Lyme in the short parliament. It was in this capacity that he was called on by the earl of Bridgewater, lord president of Wales, for assistance in defending the council in the marches of Wales from the attacks of the House of Commons. Lloyd duly wrote treatises defending the council, including one against its proposed abolition.<br>
<br>In 1642 Lloyd was forward in organizing support for Charles I in north Wales, assuring the king of the &#145;loyal professions&#146; of the principality  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1641&#150;3</i>, 336). He was appointed a commissioner of array for Denbighshire and Radnorshire, and entertained the king at his house in Wrexham on 27 September and 7 October, receiving a knighthood on the latter occasion. An active commissioner of array in north Wales, he wrote in early 1643 of his desire to assist the royalists of Chester against those &#145;poisoned by the industry of the factious and seditious preachers&#146;  (Tucker, 56&#150;7). About this time he was also raising a regiment for the king, probably of dragoons.<br>
<br>For a time after 1643 Lloyd is inconspicuous in records, but regains prominence after his appointment as governor of Holt Castle in Denbighshire by April 1645. He and his garrison were obdurate in their resistance to parliament's advances, but were eventually forced to capitulate, surrendering the castle on 13 January 1647. Under the articles of agreement he received very favourable terms, being allowed to go into exile and having his estate of &pound;300 per annum granted to his wife and children, though he was excluded from the pardon. Lloyd apparently settled in Calais, and does not appear to have troubled the interregnum governments.<br>
<br>At the Restoration Lloyd became chief justice of the Brecon circuit, which helps account for his election as member for Radnorshire in 1661. Although not a prominent member, he continued to advocate the cause of the council in the marches, presenting a memorandum in 1661 calling for its re-establishment. He died on 5 May 1676 and was buried in Wrexham parish church, where a memorial was erected in his memory. As he died intestate his estate was subject to litigation between his daughters and his grandson, Richard, Esclus Hall eventually falling to the heirs of his son-in-law Sir Henry Conway.<br>
