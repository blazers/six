<span class="headword">Greenup <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Ballard; <em>other married name </em>English]</span>,  Mary Courthope</span>  (1789&#150;1846), <span class="occ">adventurer and businesswoman in Colombia</span>, was born in Faversham, Kent, on 22 March 1789, the second daughter in the family of three daughters and three sons of Joseph Ballard, a dock worker who later died a pauper in an asylum, and his wife, Ann. Little is known of her early life, or of how she acquired her significant literary skills. Contemporaries regarded her as charismatic and beautiful, and there are suggestions that she may have had important social connections. On 11 September 1809 she married James Delancy (or Delaney) at St George's Church, Hanover Square, London. He may have been a soldier. Their daughter Eliza was born in 1810. Mary visited Waterloo in the days after the battle in 1815, where she later claimed to have &#145;tried on Napoleon's dressing gown, moralised on the mutability of human greatness [and] reflected upon the scene of havoc we had just witnessed&#146;  (Scott, <span class="italic">Mary English</span>, 12). She and her husband separated.<br>
<br>On 28 January 1819 in St Clement Danes Church in London, she married James Towers English (1782&#150;1819), the newly appointed general in charge of raising a British legion of mercenaries to fight under Sim&oacute;n Bol&iacute;var. English had no significant military experience himself; he was an Anglo-Irish horse-dealer and many officers were surprised to find him in command. Ten days after exchanging vows the newly-weds embarked for Venezuela. Mary English's nine-year-old daughter Eliza was left in the care of John Tylden, who remained a close friend throughout her life; Tylden was associated with the City of London financiers of the expedition, and was a nephew of Samuel Auchmuty, the general in charge of Britain's invasion of Montevideo in 1807. One of the reasons for James Towers English being given the command was obviously his close links to the financiers; Mary English's friendships with John Tylden and Richard Jaffray buttressed her husband's position.<br>
<br>During her brief career as the general's wife in Venezuela Mary English performed ceremonial and practical tasks; she reviewed the troops when they arrived and tended to their sickness when the expedition was devastated by yellow fever. Her letters home, especially to Richard Jaffray, provided much of the Colombian news reported in the <span class="italic">London Weekly Dispatch</span> and the <span class="italic">Morning Chronicle</span> in this period. On 26 September 1819 General English died in Margarita, Venezuela; Mary English went to live in the house of Admiral Louis Brion, who commanded the rebel navy. In early June 1820 she gave birth to a stillborn son in Brion's house.<br>
<br>On 17 March 1822 Mary English married Colonel John Low in the Venezuelan port of Maracaibo, where the remaining British contingent was now based. The nature of her premarital relations with Low triggered a political scandal in nearby C&uacute;cuta, where the Colombian government was temporarily located. This saw both the vice-president, General Antonio Nari&ntilde;o, and the commander of the Irish legion, General John Devereux, hauled before congress to explain their actions. Low and English separated within days for reasons that remain unclear; rumours of her continuing marriage to Delancy may have played a part.<br>
<br>Later in 1822 Mary English returned to London, where she received &pound;2000 in recompense for her services from Herring and Richardson, who had been paid &pound;12,000 by Bol&iacute;var. She saw her daughter for some six months before returning to Colombia as commercial representative of Herring and Richardson. Upon arrival in Bogot&aacute; in 1824, she found the Colombian capital to be flush with the recent successes against the Spanish army, with a flourishing social scene financed by an upsurge of British investment, into which she entered as a devoted adherent to the nascent cult of Bol&iacute;var, &#145;el Libertador&#146;. She situated herself at the centre of this scene. Gossips speculated that all single &eacute;lite men, including Bol&iacute;var, aspired to her hand in marriage. The British commissioner to Colombia, Patrick Campbell, courted her; in December 1826 their wedding was abruptly cancelled. On 1 January 1827 in Bogot&aacute;, as &#145;Mrs English&#146;, she married the British merchant William Marsh Greenup. The Greenups left Bogot&aacute; for the northern town of San Jos&eacute; de C&uacute;cuta, where they bought an estate and dedicated themselves to establishing a cacao plantation for export to Europe. William returned to England in 1828 (where he cared for Eliza, now a teenager), leaving Mary Greenup to run the business herself for eight years, until he returned in 1838. He died in 1842, after which she declined into ill health and poverty. She died on the plantation at El Pescadero outside C&uacute;cuta, on 30 September 1846.<br>
<br>Until her marriage to Greenup, rumours had continually questioned Mary English's honour by suggesting that she was still married to her first husband, and hence a bigamist. Her biographer (and great-granddaughter) Drusilla Scott suggests this was because Delancy himself pursued her, fanning scandal, throughout the 1820s. Her weak command of Spanish probably did not help. The Colombian (and later, New Granadan) Republic did not grant her citizenship, because of her gender and her failure to meet a property qualification. Through Eliza she had nine grandchildren, none of whom she ever met. As a non-Catholic she could not be buried in the C&uacute;cuta cemetery, so she was interred (alongside William Greenup) in the grounds of her neighbour's hacienda, La Victoria, which now forms part of the suburbs of C&uacute;cuta, the capital of the Colombian department of Norte de Santander.<br>
<br>The independence and public activity that characterized Mary Greenup's time in Colombia made her unique among foreign residents. She was at the centre of British relations with Colombia during its first decade of independence from Spanish colonial rule and was for a while a leading figure in the social life of Bogot&aacute;. As a businesswoman and farmer she acted as the representative of the bankers Herring and Richardson in Colombia at a time of great British investment in the country, and ran a cacao plantation until her death. Her letters from Colombia provide a valuable insight into social and economic relations in the newly independent republic.<br>
