<span class="headword">Skinner,  John</span>  (1772&#150;1839), <span class="occ">diarist and antiquary</span>, was born at the Old Hall, Claverton, near Bath, the son of Russell Skinner of Newtown House, Lymington, and Claverton House, near Bath, and his wife, Mary Page. He was educated at Cheam School and at Trinity College, Oxford, which he entered on 16 November 1790, by which time he was already keeping journals of his travels. Skinner graduated BA in 1794 and proceeded MA in 1797; in 1794 he entered Lincoln's Inn, but soon decided to take holy orders. He was ordained deacon in 1797 and served as curate to Richard Graves, rector of Claverton, who interested him in the study of antiquities. In the same year, he made one of his many tours of southern England, exploring Somerset, Devon, and Cornwall; extracts from his journal were published in 1985. In 1799 Skinner was ordained priest, and took up a new curacy at Brent Knoll, Somerset, but in 1800 his uncle purchased for him the living of Camerton, also in Somerset, which he held until his death. On 17 June 1805 he married Anna (<i>d</i>. 1812), eldest daughter of Joseph Holmes of Edmonton. They had three daughters and two sons between 1806 and 1811.<br>
<br>Skinner's life at Camerton was soon blighted by a succession of deaths in his family. His eldest brother died in 1810 and his two sisters soon after, followed by his youngest daughter in 1811. In 1812 his beloved wife, Anna, died, the greatest blow of all, and Skinner's anguish was renewed in 1820 by the death of Laura, his eldest daughter.<br>
<br>Skinner found himself increasingly isolated in the midst of his thankless clerical labours. Camerton, a rural parish augmented by a mining community, did not conform to the ideal of an English village, and it provided no intellectual companionship for a man of his scholarly tastes. With the local lady of the manor Skinner was on terms of guarded hostility: he regarded her activities in the parish as meddlesome and was sensitive about her desire to secure the succession of his living for her son-in-law. With local farmers he had periodic feuds over the payment of tithes, one of which culminated in an action for assault being brought against him. Skinner was driven alternately to rage or despair by the church choir, the overseers of the workhouse, teachers at the village school, his own servants, and local miners and publicans. Intolerant of Catholics (except when they were peers), he regarded the local Methodists as canting, illiterate, and hypocritical and was furious when they snatched dying parishioners from the jaws of Anglicanism. As he remarked in July 1821, &#145;Truly may it be said that Society is out of joint; what with Methodists, Catholics, Colliers, Servants and Attornies, all domestic comfort is estranged&#146;  (Skinner, 167).<br>
<br>Nevertheless, Skinner struggled to perform his duties, showing genuine concern for the spiritual condition of his flock. A conventional clergyman of his day, he was overtly paternalistic and often insensitive to his social inferiors. But he was conscientious in his pastoral duties: he visited the sick and dying regularly, organized a village school, and urged his parishioners to attend communion and to bring their children for baptism. Hard-working but humourless, he was, however, as generous with sententious advice as with port wine and money: it is easy to understand why he found many of his humbler parishioners hardened or insolent.<br>
<br>Increasingly, Skinner took refuge in his diaries and his antiquarian researches: &#145;to me indeed study has been a shield and safeguard against the evils of life&#146;  (Skinner, 271). Some of his happiest days were spent in the company of fellow antiquaries such as Sir Richard Colt Hoare of Stourhead and William Lisle Bowles. Although Skinner's archaeological explorations of the Camerton area were significant for later local historians, his deductions were highly speculative. He argued stubbornly that Camerton was the Camulodunum of Tacitus, investing the ugly realities of Camerton life with a touch of historical romance. His obituary in the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> described his etymological work on Celtic names as &#145;very wild&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 662). Skinner's publications amounted to no more than a few articles on antiquarian subjects, which appeared in <span class="italic">Archaeologia</span> and the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span>.<br>
<br>Skinner's surviving children afforded him little satisfaction: he frequently quarrelled with his sons, Joseph and Fitz-Owen, who were slow to find themselves careers, and his daughter Anna. After one argument, during which Fitz-Owen resorted to breaking the parlour furniture, Skinner recounted the scene in his journal with &#145;feelings wounded almost to a pitch of madness&#146;  (Skinner, 417). The death of Joseph in 1833 was a further blow to the anxious, affectionate, but demanding father. A decline in Skinner's mental health became increasingly apparent (in 1839 his diary recorded with restrained malice the providential bad ends of his Camerton enemies), and on 12 October 1839 he committed suicide, shooting himself through the head in a wood behind his rectory.<br>
<br>Skinner's will left some 146 volumes of manuscripts, comprising his diaries, tours, and antiquarian notes and essays, to the British Library, with &pound;1000 to fund the publication of his manuscript (never published) &#145;An analysis of language and symbols of the worship of the sun&#146;. Although his <span class="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</span> entry presented him solely as an antiquary, Skinner has proved more significant as diarist than as scholar. In 1930 part of his diary dealing with the years 1822&#150;32 was published, and an evocative and sympathetic essay by Virginia Woolf, comparing Skinner and James Woodforde, appeared in <span class="italic">The Common Reader</span> (1932). A further twenty-five volumes of Skinner's papers were discovered in a London bookseller's in 1933, and in 1971 <span class="italic">The Journal of a Somerset Rector</span> was republished in an enlarged edition covering the years 1803 to 1834.<br>
<br>Skinner's diaries present a bleak picture of the early nineteenth-century rural English parish, plagued by apathy, immorality, poverty, alcoholism, and dissent. But it is a portrait exaggerated by his own pessimism and inability to empathize with his parishioners, which render his reflections both unintentionally amusing and profoundly moving. Despite his own prickly and suspicious temperament, Skinner emerges as an oddly heroic figure.<br>
