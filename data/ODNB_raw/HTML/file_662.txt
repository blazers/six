<span class="headword">Armstrong,  John</span>  (1784&#150;1829), <span class="occ">physician</span>, was born on 8 May 1784 near Bishopwearmouth, co. Durham, the only surviving child of seven born to George Armstrong (<i>d</i>. 1815), superintendent of a glassworks at Ayres Quay, and his wife, Ann, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Robson (<i>d</i>. 1812). Armstrong was educated at a small private school in Queen Street kept by the Revd Mason, and at sixteen was apprenticed briefly to one Watson, apothecary and surgeon at Monkwearmouth, a situation which he found uncongenial. For two or three years he remained at home until he went to study medicine at the University of Edinburgh where he graduated MD in 1807 with a dissertation on dropsy, &#145;De causis morborum hydropicorum&#146;. Armstrong practised at Bishopwearmouth and in the adjoining town of Sunderland where he was physician to Sunderland Infirmary.<br>
<br>In 1811 Armstrong married Sarah (<i>d</i>. 1837), daughter of Charles Spearman. Among the six sons and three daughters who survived him was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/663/', "John Armstrong (1813&#150;1856)")</script>, later bishop of Grahamstown, Cape Colony. Armstrong's various small medical publications helped to build his reputation, and in 1818 he left his wife and family at Durham and set off for London, where he hoped to establish himself. He was at first rejected by the Royal College of Physicians, who accepted him as a licentiate only in 1820, but in 1819 he was elected physician to the St Pancras Fever Hospital (which post he resigned in 1824), and this employment enabled his family to rejoin him.<br>
<br>Armstrong built up a large practice and became a popular teacher of medicine. In 1821 he joined Edward Grainger, founder of an anatomy school at Webb Street, Southwark, as lecturer on medicine. In 1826 Armstrong, James Risdon Bennett, and the American Francis Boott founded another school in Little Dean Street, Soho, and for some time Armstrong lectured in both institutions. Armstrong was never connected with any of the greater medical schools and this, according to Boott, caused his career to be watched with surprise and some jealousy. His works on fevers, founded on his own observations, were popular in Britain and America, but were overtaken by later discoveries; indeed Armstrong himself changed his opinion of typhus, which he at first considered to be contagious but later attributed to a malarial origin. In treatment he was an ardent advocate of the antiphlogistic system and favoured the use of bleeding.<br>
<br>A controversy with the Royal College of Surgeons, published by Armstrong as <span class="italic">An address to the members of the Royal College of Surgeons on the injurious conduct and defective state of that corporation with reference to professional rights, medical science, and the public health</span> (1825) arose from that body's attempt to discourage private medical teaching by refusing to accept certificates from other than medical schools of the recognized hospitals.<br>
<br>In 1828 failing health compelled Armstrong to give up teaching. A book, <span class="italic">On the Morbid Anatomy of the Stomach, Bowels and Liver</span> was left unfinished; this, and his <span class="italic">Lectures on the Morbid Anatomy, Nature and Treatment of Acute and Chronic Diseases</span>, were published after his death, of consumption on 12 December 1829 at Russell Square, Bloomsbury, London. He was buried on 19 December at St George's, Bloomsbury.<br>
