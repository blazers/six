<span class="headword">Coates,  Eric</span> <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em>Frank Harrison Coates]</span>  (1886&#150;1957), <span class="occ">composer</span>, was born on 27 August 1886 at Watnall Road, Hucknall, Nottinghamshire, the youngest of the three daughters and two sons of William Harrison Coates (<i>d</i>. 1935), a surgeon, and his wife, Mary Jane Gwynne, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Blower, of Usk, Monmouthshire. There was music in the family, for Mary Jane (known as Mi-Jane) was a fine pianist and Dr Coates a flautist and an admired amateur singer. Eric Coates (as he seems always to have been called) never went to school, but in his earliest years shared a governess with his siblings. His innate musicality was awakened on hearing a visiting friend of the family play the violin. He was then six years old, and promptly demanded an instrument for himself. His first lessons came from a local violin teacher, but at the age of thirteen he was sent to the respected Nottingham musician George Ellenberger. Violists were in short supply, so he changed instruments, and soon found himself in demand for chamber music. At the age of eighteen, in 1904, he heard his own <span class="italic">Ballad for Strings</span> performed at the Royal Albert Hall, Nottingham.<br>
<br>Coates's father proposed a banking career for him, but was persuaded to let him attend the Royal Academy of Music, where he studied composition with Frederick Corder and viola with Lionel Tertis. From the start, Coates insisted that he wished only to write light music. Corder's rigorous training laid the foundations for what was to be the most thorough of light music techniques. As a violist, Coates was soon to be in demand in the theatre orchestras, and he became a virtuoso second only to his teacher. In 1908 he toured South Africa as a member of the Hambourg String Quartet. Yet his prospects seemed insecure, which was why he encountered parental opposition when he wished to marry a sixteen-year-old fellow student. Phyllis Marguerite Black (<i>b</i>. 1895?) was an actress and the daughter of a former Corder student, Annie Black, and her husband, Francis, principal of the Camden School of Art. To earn a living, Coates concentrated on playing, first for Thomas Beecham and then, from 1911, for Sir Henry Wood's Queen's Hall Orchestra. This security enabled him to marry Phyllis, on 2 February 1913.<br>
<br>Despite the demands of orchestral playing, Coates had his successes as a composer. Wood's first wife, Olga, sang his <span class="italic">Four Old English Songs</span> at the Promenade Concerts in 1909, and Coates's association with the lawyer and poet Fred Weatherly produced in <span class="italic">Stonecracke John</span> (1909) the first of a number of huge ballad successes. Wood himself was the dedicatee of the <span class="italic">Miniature Suite</span>, the last movement of which was encored when he conducted its first performance, at the Proms, on 17 October 1911.<br>
<br>Coates never enjoyed robust health and suffered from neuritis in his left arm. Since sight-reading came effortlessly to him, he found it difficult to share Wood's dedication to relentless rehearsing. In 1919, after nine years as principal viola, his contract was not renewed. It was an affront but it was also a relief. He never played the instrument again, and thereafter earned his living entirely by composition. A not-too-onerous contract with his publisher required from him annually one orchestral piece of fifteen minutes' duration, one of five minutes, and three ballads. A founder member of the Performing Right Society, he was one of the first composers to derive the bulk of his income from radio and recording. To an extent, the playing time of a 78 r.p.m. record dictated the format of his work, which favoured the suite, the fantasy, the march, the valse, and the ballad. While he was at first influenced by Sullivan and German, Coates had an enviable ability to absorb new trends. Thus such works as <span class="italic">The Selfish Giant</span> (1925) and <span class="italic">The Three Bears</span> (1926, written to amuse his four-year-old son, Austin) made use of the syncopated and jazz styles of the period. His march <span class="italic">Knightsbridge</span> (1932, from the <span class="italic">London Suite</span>) was used as introductory music for the long-running radio programme <span class="italic">In Town Tonight</span> (from 1933), and from 1940 the march <span class="italic">Calling All Workers</span> set the pace for the <span class="italic">Music while you Work</span> broadcasts. In 1930 he had written a valse serenade, <span class="italic">By the Sleepy Lagoon</span>; after the Second World War it found its place as the theme tune for the radio programme <span class="italic">Desert Island Discs</span>, and it continued to be heard in that context at the end of the century.<br>
<br>Between the wars Coates's work dominated the repertory of the seaside and spa orchestras. He achieved a final triumph when the film <span class="italic">The Dambusters</span> (1954) employed a recently written march to which he gave the same name. It illustrated all the characteristics of his music: strong melody, foot-tapping rhythm, brilliant counterpoints, and colourful orchestration. Coates was an effective conductor of his own work, which he tended to take at a brisk tempo. In 1936 he conducted his work in Scandinavia, making further visits abroad as a representative of the Performing Right Society to the USA (1946) and to South America (1948). He and his wife were enthusiastic dancers, and his rhythmic sense reflected this. Although his music sometimes described rural scenes, he was essentially a city man, happiest in London. Unassuming and quiet, he had a whimsical sense of humour. Modest to a fault, he showed no resentment that he never received the public honours that were surely his due. He died on 21 December 1957 in the Royal West Sussex Hospital, Chichester, having suffered a massive stroke a few days before. His wife survived him.<br>
