<span class="headword">Faithorne,  William</span> <span class="st"> [<em>known as </em>William Faithorne the elder]</span>  (<em>c.</em>1620&#150;1691), <span class="occ">engraver</span>, was apprenticed in the Goldsmiths' Company to the printseller William Peake for ten years from 9 October 1635, and the date of birth given here is deduced from this; the traditional date of about 1616 is derived from Buckeridge's assertion in &#145;An essay towards the English school&#146; that he died aged near seventy-five. The entry records that his father was Daniel Faithorne of London, a lorimer (bridle maker for horses). Peake was the eldest son of Robert Peake, serjeant-painter to James I, and inherited his printselling and stationery business. He was not himself an engraver, and the statement of Faithorne's early biographer John Bagford that he was trained by John Payne is therefore entirely believable. On William Peake's early death in 1639, Faithorne was turned over to complete his apprenticeship with William's son Robert, who had taken over the business and was not an engraver either. The situation was hardly conventional, because in the early 1640s, while Faithorne was still notionally an apprentice, Peake published no fewer than sixteen portrait engravings signed with Faithorne's name. None gives the name of a designer, and they were evidently drawn by Faithorne himself from life or another picture.<br>
<br>The ancestral connection of the Peake family with the royal court ensured that, when Charles I raised his standard at Nottingham in August 1642, Peake enrolled in the royalist army, and Faithorne went with him as an ensign. The two men served in the garrison of Basing House during its long siege and were both captured when it fell in October 1645. Faithorne was then imprisoned in Petre House in Aldersgate Street, but was evidently allowed to take up engraving again, for four plates were published by Peake's associate Thomas Rowlett. Three were of such arch-royalist subjects as the prince of Wales, Prince Rupert of the Rhine, and Endymion Porter, and were after paintings by William Dobson, who had also been apprenticed to William Peake. In style they imitate the manner of the then fashionable Claude Mellan, using parallel lines rather than cross-hatching to create tone. The fourth plate was of the parliamentary general Thomas Fairfax, a print collector himself, and it may have been through his intercession that Faithorne's imprisonment was commuted to banishment. The date of this is not certain, but was probably in 1647 or 1648.<br>
<br>Faithorne went to France, where Bagford records that he was much helped by another great print collector, the Abb&eacute; Marolles, whose first collection was purchased by Louis XIV in 1667 and now serves as the foundation of the <i>cabinet des estampes</i> in the Biblioth&egrave;que Nationale. During these years Faithorne earned a living by making plates for Parisian publishers, especially Herman Weyen. Under the influence of Robert Nanteuil he began to make his own finished portrait drawings in black chalk, both as objects in their own right and as the basis for engravings. He also altered his manner of engraving, which, as George Vertue noted, now reflected that of Antoine Masson.<br>
<br>Faithorne was still in Paris in February 1651, when he signed a petition with twenty-seven of the leading figures of the French print world against a proposed tax on print production, but was back in London by November 1652, when he was made free of the Goldsmiths' Company, having completed his term of service &#145;long since&#146;. His close links with the international print trade enabled him to establish his own print shop, first &#145;at the Sign of the Ship within Temple Bar&#146; (by 1654) and then &#145;next to the Sign of the Drake without Temple Bar&#146; (by 1662). There he took on the role of the old Peake shop as the main importer of foreign prints. He also dealt in artists' materials, and published in 1662 his own translation, <span class="italic">The Art of Graveing and Etching</span>, of the <span class="italic">Trait&eacute; des mani&egrave;res de graver en taille douce</span> which had been written by Abraham Bosse in 1645; he dedicated it to his old master, Robert Peake. Its publication was linked with the appearance of John Evelyn's <span class="italic">Sculptura</span> in the same year, and Evelyn abandoned his own translation of Bosse so as not to compete with Faithorne's work.<br>
<br>Faithorne continued to engrave himself, and during the 1650s and 1660s made his finest plates, which are of high quality by any standards. His supremacy in London was challenged only by Pierre Lombard and later by David Loggan. These single-sheet portraits he published himself, but his output of this type was small. Most of his plates were made as frontispieces for booksellers, and their quality was much more ordinary. As a publisher, he expanded his range beyond an exclusive concentration on portraiture. A major undertaking was a twelve-sheet map of London published in 1658, which is now extremely rare. He also published many anonymous plates, often copied from continental originals, which he must have had made by apprentices in his shop.<br>
<br>At the Restoration Faithorne was appointed (on 12 October 1660) engraver in copper to the king, doubtless in reward for his devotion to the Stuart cause. Curiously he made no mention of this on his plates, and the appointment remained unknown to his early biographers. He was elected to the livery of the Goldsmiths' Company in May 1660, and served as second warden in 1683 and 1684. In 1679 he declined the position of touchwarden and, in place of paying a fine, presented the company with a painting of Sir Martin Bowes that still hangs in the court room. A marked decline in his output and quality may be seen in the 1670s, and he must have been severely put out by the arrival of Abraham Blooteling and Gerard Valck in 1673 and of Peter Vandrebanc in 1674. At some point in the 1680s he left his shop and retired to a house in Printing House Yard, Blackfriars. Bagford says that he continued engraving there, but the surviving works from his last years are mostly portrait drawings, usually made in the fashionable medium of coloured crayons.<br>
<br>Samuel Pepys and Robert Hooke record many visits to Faithorne's shop in their diaries. On 7 November 1666, for instance, Pepys went to buy some prints for his wife to copy, and saw there Faithorne's copy in coloured chalks from Peter Lely's painting of a countess, which he was using as the basis for his engraving. Pepys thought it the finest thing he had ever seen in his life and tried to purchase it, but Faithorne would not sell it until he had finished correcting his plate from it.<br>
<br>Soon after his return from Paris, Faithorne married Judith, who was, according to Bagford, the sister of &#145;the famous Captain Grand&#146; (despite his fame, his identity remains uncertain). She was buried in St Ann Blackfriars on 26 December 1690, and a few months later, on 13 May 1691, Faithorne too was buried there. He made bequests in his will to his two sons, William and Henry, and to a married daughter, Judith Thorpe. The elder son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9103/', "William Faithorne (c.1670&#150;1703)")</script>, entered his father's trade.<br>
<br>Faithorne was the finest native-born engraver working before the eighteenth century, and when the art of line engraving reached its apogee of critical esteem at the end of the eighteenth century this became of great importance. Horace Walpole elevated Faithorne into the English equivalent of Robert Nanteuil and the other great seventeenth-century French engravers, and this fed a collectors' frenzy that ensured that fine proofs of Faithorne's prints fetched extraordinary prices. In the sale of Sir Mark Masterman Sykes's collection in 1824, his Faithorne engravings fetched a total of &pound;1271. These prices proved unsustainable, and in the inevitable reaction Faithorne and his work fell into an equally indefensible critical oblivion.<br>
