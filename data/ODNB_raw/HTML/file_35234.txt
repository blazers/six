<span class="headword">Nickalls,  Guy</span>  (1866&#150;1935), <span class="occ">oarsman</span>, was born at Horton Kirby, Kent, on 12 November 1866, the third son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/48085/', "Tom Nickalls (1828&#150;1899)")</script> of Horton Kirby and afterwards of Patteson Court, Nutfield, Surrey, and his wife, Emily Quihampton. His father, a stockbroker, was an original member of the London Rowing Club. Like his younger brother Vivian, also a prominent oarsman, he was educated at Eton College (1877&#150;87) and Magdalen College, Oxford (1887&#150;90), where he took a pass degree in 1890. In early youth he was considered to be of delicate constitution, but after he had been at Eton a short time he began to develop the physique and stamina that eventually made him an outstanding oarsman. He took the advice he later gave both his sons, which was &#145;not to sit back on the side-lines&#146;  (G. O. Nickalls, <span class="italic">Rainbow in the Sky</span>, 40), and had many other interests in life, especially in connection with sport.<br>
<br>It was on account of his remarkable successes in boat-racing that Nickalls was best known. He rowed for Eton two years, winning the ladies' plate in 1885, and five years for Oxford (1887&#150;91), being a member of the winning crew the last two years. Over the Henley course he rowed in all 81 races, of which he won 67 and lost 13, one being a dead heat. This extraordinary achievement included the following victories: five diamond sculls, six goblets or pair-oared races, seven stewards' or four-oared races, four grand challenge cups, one Olympic eights, and one ladies' plate. Probably the most notable of all these achievements was his rowing, at the age of forty-one years and eight months, at number 4 in the Leander eight which won a gold medal at the 1908 Olympic games. In writing of them in his autobiography he commented:<blockquote>I do not wish for a moment to take any credit to myself. &hellip; Nature has endowed me with a fairly strong body, a constitution of iron, and a will power or stubbornness above the average. These I have tried my best not to abuse, and any man so built and constituted, given my opportunities, could no doubt have done the same. (G. Nickalls, <span class="italic">Life's a Pudding</span>, 205)</blockquote>From 1891 to 1922 Nickalls was a member of the stock exchange. He married in 1898 Ellen Gilbey (<i>d</i>. 1935), daughter of Henry Gold JP of Hedsor, Buckinghamshire, and sister of Sir Harcourt Gilbey Gold, also a notable oarsman. An enthusiast in all things, Nickalls forced his way into the army at the age of forty-seven without previous military experience. He went to France in 1917 as superintendent of the physical and bayonet training of a division (afterwards increased to three divisions), and remained abroad until the end of hostilities. Later in life he devoted a considerable amount of his time to work on behalf of the Worcester College for the Blind, and was successful in collecting a considerable sum as the foundation of a permanent endowment fund.<br>
<br>On 7 July 1935, while travelling north for his annual fishing holiday in Scotland, Nickalls was involved in a car accident, and died from his injuries, on 8 July 1935, at Leeds General Infirmary. His widow died in the following month. Of their two sons, the elder, Guy Oliver Nickalls (1899&#150;1974), was chairman of the Amateur Rowing Association and senior steward of Henley royal regatta.<br>
