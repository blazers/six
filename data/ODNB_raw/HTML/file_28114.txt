<span class="headword">Varley,  Cromwell Fleetwood</span>  (1828&#150;1883), <span class="occ">telegraph engineer</span>, was born at Kentish Town, London, on 6 April 1828, the second of the ten children of the artist and inventor <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28113/', "Cornelius Varley (1781&#150;1873)")</script> and his wife, Elizabeth Livermore Straker. He claimed descent from Oliver Cromwell and General Charles Fleetwood, for whom he was named. His family was associated with the London Sandemanian congregation, as was the experimental philosopher Michael Faraday (1791&#150;1867). In later years, however, Varley came to regard the Sandemanians as a &#145;very narrow-minded sect&#146;.<br>
<br>After completing his schooling at St Saviour's Grammar School, Southwark, Varley joined the newly formed Electric Telegraph Company in 1846; he rose to become chief engineer for the London area by 1852 and for the entire company by 1861. Soon after joining the company he devised an electrical method for locating faults in the insulation of underground lines, thus facilitating their repair. This method, known as the &#145;Varley loop test&#146;, was in use for many years. Similar techniques later proved of great value on submarine cables, aided by the employment of standardized resistance coils, which Varley helped introduce into telegraphic practice. He was among the first to trace the retardation and distortion of signals on underground lines to the effects of electrostatic induction, and in 1854 patented a double-current key that lessened the problem by using pulses of alternating polarity to discharge the line. Varley developed a variety of improved testing instruments and relays, and in 1870 patented the &#145;cymaphen&#146;, a type of harmonic telegraph that could transmit musical tones and, in a later variant, articulate speech. He also devised a simple way to use small electrical charges to generate much larger ones, and &#145;Varley's multiplier&#146; became the basis of widely used electrostatic machines.<br>
<br>Varley's most important work came in submarine telegraphy. After the failure of the short-lived first Atlantic cable in 1858, he was appointed to a joint investigative committee established by the British government and the Atlantic Telegraph Company. Its 1861 report helped restore enough confidence in the technology for a second attempt to span the Atlantic to be launched in 1865, with Varley now serving as chief electrician. Although the 1865 cable snapped during laying, a renewed attempt the following year succeeded; moreover, the broken cable was then grappled and brought to the surface, spliced, and also completed from Ireland to Newfoundland. Varley devised many improvements in cable testing and signalling techniques in the 1860s, including the use of condensers and &#145;curbed&#146; transmission to sharpen signals, and artificial cables to mimic the effects of distributed resistance and capacitance. A strong-jawed man with mutton-chop whiskers and a receding hairline, Varley soon became a leading figure among telegraph engineers. He had a shrewd business sense, and the patent partnership he formed in 1865 with the physicist William Thomson 
    (later Lord Kelvin; 1824&#150;1907)
   and the electrical engineer Fleeming Jenkin (1833&#150;1885) eventually brought all three men large royalties from cable companies.<br>
<br>Varley was elected a member of the Institution of Civil Engineers in 1865 and a fellow of the Royal Society in 1871. In the latter year he was also a founder member of the Society of Telegraph Engineers (later the Institution of Electrical Engineers). He wrote widely on telegraphic and electrical subjects, and in 1871 published a paper in the <span class="italic">Proceedings of the Royal Society</span> on electrical discharges in rarefied gases, in which he suggested that cathode rays were streams of tiny electrified particles, later identified as electrons. A convinced spiritualist, he helped introduce the physicist William Crookes (1832&#150;1919) to the subject in 1867, and in 1874 used a cable galvanometer to investigate the &#145;materializations&#146; of the medium Florence Cook (1856&#150;1904).<br>
<br>Varley had two sons and two daughters with his first wife, Ellen Rouse, whom he married on 4 October 1855. On returning from a trip abroad on cable business, Varley found that she had gone off to live with Ion Perdicaris, a wealthy Greek-American, whom she had met at Malvern in 1871. After the divorce was granted in 1873, she and the children settled with Perdicaris at Tangier. In 1904 Varley's elder son, also named Cromwell, was kidnapped along with Perdicaris by Moroccan bandits, precipitating an international incident before both men were released unharmed. On 11 January 1877 Varley married Heleanor Jessie Smith of Forres, Scotland. After several years of failing health, he died at Cromwell House, Bexleyheath, Kent, on 2 September 1883, and was buried on 6 September at Christ Church, Bexley.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_50393"></a><span class="headword">(Samuel) Alfred Varley</span>  (1832&#150;1921)<span class="occ"></span> followed his brother Cromwell into the Electric Telegraph Company, entering its Manchester workshops in 1852. He supervised the first field telegraphs used in the Crimean War and published influential papers on cable signalling in 1858&#150;9. In 1861 he took over running a London telegraph factory owned by his father. He and Cromwell had a bitter falling out, and in later years the two brothers denounced each other for a variety of real and imagined slights and betrayals. His marriage in 1860 to Emily Andrews brought them seven children, of whom at least three survived him, although it seems that Emily left him after the children were grown.<br>
<br>Alfred Varley's lack of business acumen kept him from reaping the full rewards of his work. In 1866 he was one of several nearly simultaneous inventors of the self-exciting dynamo, which freed the generation of electric currents from reliance on permanent magnets. This was eventually recognized as a fundamental advance, as was Varley's later invention of compound winding, but his patents on both lapsed before they became commercially valuable. Soured by business failures and the lack of recognition given to his pioneering contributions, he became known in the late 1880s as a vocal critic of electrical engineers' increasing reliance on mathematical theory. He was awarded a civil-list pension in 1894, and later retired to Winchester, where he died at his house, Abbottsacre Lodge, Abbott's Road, on 4 August 1921. He was buried in the city's new cemetery on 9 August.<br>
