<span class="headword">Hugeburc <span class="st"> [Huneburc]</span></span>  (<em>fl. </em>760&#150;780), <span class="occ">Benedictine nun and hagiographer</span>, spent many years at the double monastery of Heidenheim in Germany; she was also known as Huneburc. She was the author of the lives of Willibald and of his brother Winnebald, composed between 778 and 780, and is the first known Englishwoman to have written a full-length literary work. Her identity as the author of the lives was discovered only in 1931 by Bernhard Bischoff; her name was concealed in cipher between the two lives in their oldest manuscript  (Munich, Bayerische Staatsbibliothek, MS Clm 1086), written about 800. Hugeburc was related in some degree to the two brothers, &#145;a humble relative&#146; she writes, and to their sister Walburg, but nothing else is known of her except the sketchy information given in her writings.<br>
<br>Walburg became abbess of Heidenheim in succession to her brother Winnebald, who had founded it as a monastery in 752. When Walburg inherited Heidenheim, it had to become a double monastery and she brought a group of nuns with her to form the only such institution on the continent founded by the Anglo-Saxon mission. Hugeburc may already have been in Germany with Walburg; it seems likely that both women had been summoned to Germany by Boniface at an earlier date. Hugeburc remarks that she came to Heidenheim immediately after Winnebald's death in 761; she witnessed some of the post-mortem miracles which she records in his life.<br>
<br>Willibald, visiting his sister's monastery, dictated parts of his so-called <span class="italic">Hodoeporicon</span> (an account of his life and, most notably, his travels in the Holy Land in the 730s) to Hugeburc on Tuesday 23 June 778. Despite opposition within the monastery, but with the encouragement of Walburg, Hugeburc determined to record the known facts of Willibald's life, fearing lest the verbatim account she had recorded should be lost. Although professing herself inhibited by her sex from writing the lives of the venerable bishop and his brother, she was fired by the importance of the task she set herself. The <span class="italic">Hodoeporicon</span>'s English translator remarks that &#145;one can sense her intense curiosity to discover all about the places Willibald had visited&#146;  (Talbot, 152). Hugeburc's style is ambitious, with &#145;exuberantly crammed, complex periods, enhanced by rare words and phrases &hellip; bizarre cases and case-endings, tenses and verb-forms&#146;  (Dronke, 33), using Sedulius's prelude to his <span class="italic">Carmen paschale</span> as a source for certain phrases, borrowing motifs from the life of St Boniface, and adapting a riddle of Aldhelm's. The report that Willibald gave of his travels and the accounts of the miracles of Winnebald are textually distinct, indicating that here Hugeburc was drawing on oral reports and eyewitness accounts. Her style has been compared to that of Hrotsvitha, the later German monastic writer.<br>
