<span class="headword">Booth,  James Charles</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1703, <em>d.</em> 1778), <span class="occ">lawyer</span>, was baptized on 6 November 1703 at the church of St Germain-en-Laye, the eldest son of Charles Booth (1666/7&#150;1740), army officer and Jacobite courtier, and Barbara Symes. His godfather was James Stuart (James III), Jacobite claimant to the throne, whom Charles Booth served as groom of the bedchamber having followed James II into exile. Three of James Booth's brothers became Jesuit priests, but James was sent to Magdalen College, Oxford, where he matriculated on 14 July 1722 before enrolling at the Middle Temple, London, on 28 November 1722. In order to obtain this education Booth identified himself as the son of James Booth of Theobalds, Hertfordshire, an act that has subsequently misled historians concerning his true family and background. Booth later took chambers in Lincoln's Inn and acquired a licence to practise as a conveyancer, and soon gained a considerable amount of business.<br>
<br>On the death of Nathaniel Pigott, the most eminent conveyancer of his day, and also a Roman Catholic, Booth succeeded to this position. His conveyances enjoyed the highest possible repute in the profession, and being often copied and used as precedents by lesser practitioners, they set the fashion in conveyancing for a great part of the eighteenth century. In one respect, however, they contrasted very unfavourably with those of his predecessor Pigott. Whereas Pigott's deeds had been models of conciseness, Booth's were remarkably prolix. This, while merely inconvenient to his wealthy clients, occasioned unnecessary expense to those whose advisers needlessly followed his example. He wrote no treatise on the subject, nor did he publish a collection of precedents, but his written opinions circulated within the profession, and several were printed. His knowledge of the 1536 Statute of Uses, a fundamental plank of his professional skill, was profound. He was said to have been consulted by the duke of Cumberland as to whether he could recover a legacy left to him by his father, George II, the new king having torn up the will, and to have advised that &#145;a king of England has by the common law no power of bequeathing personal property&#146;  (Polson, 2.84). He is also said to have drafted George III's will. He was for some years a friend of Lord Mansfield.<br>
<br>On 2 July 1748 at St Anne and St Agnes, Aldersgate, London, he married Mary, daughter of the politician <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/47277/', "John Sharp")</script> and Anna Maria Hosier, and granddaughter of Archbishop John Sharp. The marriage was not a success and the couple separated, though both are named in property deeds in Herefordshire in 1777  (Herefordshire RO, BB2/63/284&#150;5). A descendant of a Herefordshire Catholic family, and related to Charles Booth (<i>d</i>. 1535), bishop of Hereford  (Cooke, 3.11&#150;12), Booth purchased an estate in the county at Whitfield, Kingstone, where he built a house. In later years Booth suffered considerably from cataracts. He died at Old Boswell's Court, Strand, London, on 15 January 1778 and was buried in East Barnet, Hertfordshire, on 21 January. He was survived by his wife.<br>
