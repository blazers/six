<span class="headword">Blake, Sir  Francis</span>, first baronet  (1707/8&#150;1780), <span class="occ">experimental philosopher</span>, was the son of Robert Blake (<i>d</i>. 1734), landowner, of Twisell, co. Durham, and his wife, Sarah, daughter of Sir Francis Blake MP (1638&#150;1718), of Ford Castle, Northumberland. His father was of Irish origin and belonged to the Blakes of Menlo Castle, co. Galway, who claimed descent from Richard Caddle, a fourteenth-century sheriff of Connaught. His mother's family, though bearing the same name, was descended from minor Hampshire gentry. His maternal grandfather was a substantial and rising landowner who had made good during the Commonwealth and Restoration, and had given the small estate of Twisell to Robert Blake as a marriage settlement.<br>
<br>Blake was educated at Lincoln College, Oxford, where he matriculated in 1725. On 9 November 1732 he married Isabel (<i>c</i>.1710&#150;1741), daughter of Samuel Ayton of West Herrington; they had two sons and two daughters. He inherited the estate of Twisell on his father's death and held on to it, though his title was challenged by descendants of the Selby family who had owned it until the late seventeenth century. When in London, he appears to have resided at Queen Square, Westminster. He rendered active support to the government during the Jacobite rising of 1745, and was created a baronet on 3 May 1774.<br>
<br>In 1741 Blake published <span class="italic">An Explanation of Fluxions, in a Short Essay on the Theory</span>. He devoted much of his time to mechanics and experimental philosophy, and was elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1746. He was an active member of the society during the 1750s and 1760s, serving on a committee set up to examine John Canton's experiments on the compressibility of water, and publishing papers in <span class="italic">Philosophical Transactions</span> on the design of steam engines. He was related to the Delaval family, which included a number of early scientists and industrialists. He died at Tilmouth, Northumberland, on 29 March 1780, and was buried at Houghton-le-Spring, co. Durham. His elder son, Robert, who had been a student at Westminster School, died in 1754 at the age of twenty-one, and was buried in Westminster Abbey, and Blake was succeeded in the baronetcy by his second son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2578/', "Francis Blake (1736/7&#150;1818)")</script>.<br>
