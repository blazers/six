<span class="headword">Warner,  Joseph</span>  (1717&#150;1801), <span class="occ">surgeon</span>, was the eldest son of Ashton Warner (1691&#150;1752), politician, of Antigua in the West Indies. Joseph Warner later inherited the estate in Antigua, together with a ring, said to be the one given by Elizabeth I to the earl of Essex. Warner was sent to England when young and was educated for six or seven years at Westminster School. He was apprenticed for seven years to Samuel Sharp, surgeon to Guy's Hospital, on 3 December 1734. Warner passed his examination for the great diploma of the Company of Barber&#150;Surgeons on 1 December 1741, and on 2 March following he paid the usual fee of &pound;10 and took the livery of the company. At this time he was acting with his master, Sharp, as joint lecturer on anatomy at Guy's.<br>
<br>Warner volunteered to accompany the expedition in 1745, under the duke of Cumberland, to suppress the rebellion in Scotland, and he was elected surgeon to Guy's Hospital, in succession to James Pierce, on 22 February 1746, an office he resigned on 30 June 1780. He was elected a fellow of the Royal Society on 6 December 1750, and on 5 April 1764 he was chosen as a member of the court of assistants of the Company of Surgeons. He became a member of its court of examiners on 6 August 1771, and he served as its master in 1780 and in 1784. When the Royal College of Surgeons was created in 1800 Warner became its first member, so that he was one of the very few surgeons who belonged to the three corporate bodies of surgeons which have existed in England. He was a member of the college's court of assistants from 1800&#150;01. Warner shared with William Bromfield, Sir Caesar Hawkins, and Sharp the civil surgical practice of London. He was one of those surgeons who &#145;from midcentury on &hellip; began to insist ever more vehemently that a good surgeon avoided operating if possible, and cured, instead, by regimen and medicines&#146;  (Lawrence, 305).<br>
<br>Warner contributed little to the literature of surgery, but what he wrote provides an insight into the opinions of contemporary surgeons. He was the first surgeon to tie the common carotid artery, an operation he performed in 1775. Warner's reputation rests on his <span class="italic">Cases on surgery &hellip; to which is added an account of the preparation and effects of the agaric of the oak in stopping of bleedings after some of the most capital operations</span> (1754), translated into French (Paris, 1757). The cases extend over the whole domain of surgery and are related with brevity, skill, and judgement. A dispute with John Hunter over surgical teaching at Guy's led Warner to write a memorandum in which he describes the nature of surgical training at the hospital. It is printed in Wilks and Bettany's <span class="italic">A Biographical History of Guy's Hospital</span> (1892). Warner died at his house in Hatton Street, London, on 24 July 1801.<br>
