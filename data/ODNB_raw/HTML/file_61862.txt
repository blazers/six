<span class="headword">Dring <span class="st"> [<em>married name </em>Lord]</span>,  Madeleine Winefride Isabelle</span>  (1923&#150;1977), <span class="occ">composer</span>, was born on 7 September 1923 at 66 Raleigh Road, Hornsey, London, the younger child of Cecil John Dring (1883&#150;1949), an architect and surveyor, and his wife, Winefride Isabel (1891&#150;1968), the daughter of John Austin Smith of Fochabers, Moray. A Roman Catholic, she was initially educated at La Retraite Convent, Clapham Park. Since she showed precocious musical talent, in 1934 she was awarded an exhibition to the junior department of the Royal College of Music to study the violin. Her youthful diaries (1935&#150;43), written in school exercise books and full of amusing drawings, give a witty commentary on her life, from national events to holidays at the seaside, ghastly visits to the dentist, troubles at school in the form of a jealous music teacher, the joys of the Royal College of Music, her early compositions, and, in 1940, the news that her brother Cecil (<i>b</i>. 1918) was reported missing in action in France. She won a further scholarship to the college as a senior student, where she studied composition with Herbert Howells, Ralph Vaughan Williams, and Gordon Jacob, as well as furthering her studies of the violin, piano, singing, drama, and mime; she left in 1944.<br>
<br>During the 1950s Madeleine Dring was involved in various musical radio programmes in collaboration with D. F. Aitken and others. She wrote items of a gently satirical nature for Laurie Lister's &#145;intimate revues&#146;, sometimes providing words as well as music, notably for <span class="italic">Airs on a Shoe String</span> (1953) and <span class="italic">Fresh Airs</span> (1955), at the Royal Court Theatre, where she made many friends, including Michael Flanders and Donald Swann. She also had a happy association with the Players' Theatre, where she had the opportunity to sing and act as well as compose.<br>
<br>Of striking appearance, very pale, with long blond hair, Madeleine Dring was highly intelligent and prepared to work intensively at the things which interested her&#151;mainly music and theatre. She had perfect pitch, and also synaesthesia, in which musical sounds and keys had individual colours. Some of her compositions were influenced by George Gershwin and Cole Porter, and she used a syncopated or blues style in the <span class="italic">Colour Suite</span> (1963) for piano, for example, and in her setting of John Betjeman's &#145;Song of a Nightclub Proprietress&#146; (1976). She also admired Poulenc, whose influence may be traced in her chamber and instrumental pieces and in her many songs. On 12 August 1947 she married Roger Frewen Lord (<i>b</i>. 1924), an oboist, with whom she had a son, Jeremy, born in 1950. She wrote several pieces for the oboe, of which two trios, one for flute, oboe, and piano (1968), the other for oboe, bassoon, and harpsichord (published 1986), are the most important. Two pianos and four hands appealed to her, and she wrote various dance movements for this combination. Not sympathetic to the fashionable idioms of the atonal and the serial, she continued in the mainstream tradition of English songwriting, using mainly classical texts in a lyrical way. Her use of subtle and sophisticated harmonies to grace a melody gives her songs an individual voice.<br>
<br>In later life Madeleine Dring became interested in parapsychology; she attended lectures and conferences of the Centre for Spiritual and Psychological Studies, and occasionally gave talks there on music. She died unexpectedly from a brain haemorrhage on 26 March 1977 at her home, 52 Becmead Avenue, Streatham, London, and was buried in Lambeth cemetery. Her wind music seems to have a secure place in the chamber repertory, and her settings of five poems by Betjeman, which were published in 1980, continue to be performed.<br>
