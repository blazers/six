<span class="headword">Bagrit, Sir  Leon</span>  (1902&#150;1979), <span class="occ">industrialist</span>, was born on 13 March 1902 in Kiev, Ukraine, the younger son and second of three children of Manuel Bagrit, jewellery designer and jeweller, and his wife, Rachel Yousopovich. The family left Russia when he was a small child and arrived in London from Belgium in 1914. Bagrit knew no English then, but mastered it quickly, and soon gained a school prize for English literature at St Olave's School in Southwark, whose headmaster, W. G. Rushbrooke, took a close personal interest in the development of his many-sided gifts. These included music, and playing the violin in an orchestra helped him through the precarious early adult years.<br>
<br>After reading law at Birkbeck College, London University, Bagrit joined Messrs W. &amp; T. Avery, manufacturers of weighing machines. He had no formal training in engineering but possessed an exceptional understanding of engineering and related matters which was vitally important to his subsequent career.<br>
<br>In 1926 he married Stella, daughter of Simon Feldman, businessman, and his wife, Rebecca. The couple had two daughters and seven grandchildren, to whom Bagrit was closely attached.<br>
<br>In 1927 Bagrit became general manager of a competitor, Herbert &amp; Sons, leaving in 1935 to set up his own firm, B. &amp; P. Swift, again in the weighing machine business, in order to exploit his own technical innovations. Its abilities were soon harnessed to the war effort, in aviation and other fields. In 1947 B. &amp; P. Swift was acquired by Elliott Brothers (London) Ltd, of Lewisham, an old-established and substantially larger company, which had emerged from the war without a clear view of its future. Bagrit first became joint managing director, and not long afterwards sole managing director. At this point his undoubted flair for engineering was put to its greatest test, as he resolved to base the company's future on the introduction of automatic control as extensively as possible. He paid many visits to the United States, where important wartime developments had taken place and many of the basic ingredients of what subsequently became known as automation systems were already available.<br>
<br>If automation were to be introduced successfully over the widest possible field, a number of decisions of principle were vital in order to make the best use of financial and human resources. Particularly in the United States, licences were available to enable the firm's own large development effort to be concentrated elsewhere. Financial and organizational control over the multitude of facets involved in the business could be assured only by the creation of a large number of divisions or subsidiary companies under separate managements responsible for their success and controlled by a rigid system of budgets and monthly accounts&#151;an approach which is commonplace today, but which Bagrit pioneered in Britain.<br>
<br>The company rapidly became successful, and in 1957 a merger with other, smaller, companies led to the establishment of Elliott-Automation Ltd, of which Bagrit was first deputy chairman and managing director, and from 1963 onwards chairman and managing director. He expanded the group's activities into Europe and other overseas territories. The company attracted investors in the United States and was one of the early UK stocks to be traded there in the ADR (American Depository Receipt) market. Bagrit's recognition in the City brought him part-time directorships, notably (in 1963) of the early technology-oriented investment trusts, Electronic Trust and Technology Investment Trust, which were later merged.<br>
<br>In 1967 Elliott-Automation, which by then employed about 24,000 people, was acquired by the English Electric Company, of which Bagrit became a deputy chairman. About a year later the English Electric Company was in turn acquired by the General Electric Company, and while Bagrit remained chairman of the company (later known as GEC&#150;Elliott Automation Ltd) until 1973, he soon retired from an active role.<br>
<br>What distinguished Bagrit from other successful industrialists was his early recognition of the far-reaching problems in social and other fields which automation would bring about. He was confident that they could be solved, but not without active and detailed preparation. His thoughts were made public in 1964 through his Reith lectures entitled &#145;The age of automation&#146;, which were subsequently published as a book (1966). He had great breadth of vision and in business was more concerned with the broad sweep than with the detail, much of which he was happy to delegate to colleagues; however, there is no doubt of his ability to master detail when he considered it important. This approach left him time to pursue his many other interests. He was a director of the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, from 1962 to 1970, and the founder of the Friends of Covent Garden, of which body he was chairman from 1962 to 1969. After his death Lady Bagrit created the Markova&#150;Bagrit scholarship at the Royal Ballet School in London.<br>
<br>Bagrit was a notable collector in the field of visual arts. His close interest in the development of Israel centred particularly on the Haifa Technion (of whose British Friends he was president from 1962 to 1975), and on the Israel Museum. Lady Bagrit established a chair in his name for computer-aided design and scientific research development at Ben Gurion University.<br>
<br>Bagrit was knighted in 1962. He was a member of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research from 1963 to 1965, and a member of the Advisory Council on Technology from 1964 to 1969. In 1965 the Royal Society of Arts awarded him the Albert medal for his work in the application of automation to industry. He received honorary doctorates from the universities of Surrey (1966) and Reading (1968). Bagrit died in London on 22 April 1979.<br>
