<span class="headword">Burns,  (James) Dawson</span>  (1828&#150;1909), <span class="occ">temperance reformer</span>, born at Southwark in London, on 22 January 1828, was the younger son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/4088/', "Jabez Burns, DD (1805&#150;1876)")</script>, Baptist minister of New Church Street Chapel, Marylebone, for forty-one years, and a popular religious writer and temperance advocate. His mother was Jane, the daughter of George and Ann Dawson of Keighley.<br>
<br>In 1839 Burns took the pledge and addressed the young members of his father's congregation in New Church Street. During his teenage years he wrote <span class="italic">A Plea for Youths' Temperance Societies</span>, held a public discussion, and contributed articles to the <span class="italic">Weekly Temperance Journal</span> and the <span class="italic">National Temperance Advocate</span>. In February 1845 he became assistant secretary to the National Temperance Society, and a year later joint secretary, besides managing its monthly organ, the <span class="italic">Temperance Chronicle</span>. He was official reporter of the world's convention held in August 1846, in which his father took a prominent part.<br>
<br>From September 1847 to 1850 Burns studied at the General Baptist College, which was then at Leicester, and in September 1851 became pastor of the Baptist chapel at Salford. In 1853 he helped Nathaniel Card, a Quaker, to found in Manchester the United Kingdom Alliance with a view to influencing the licensing laws. He was in London in March 1853 as metropolitan superintendent, and was enrolled the sixth member on 1 June 1853.<br>
<br>Burns lived in north London, where he worked energetically for the cause and exercised considerable influence on policy. From March 1856 he wrote a &#145;London Letter&#146; for the weekly <span class="italic">Alliance News</span> and published numerous books and pamphlets. He was made an honorary MA of Bates College, Maine, in 1869 and afterwards DD. He edited <span class="italic">Graham's Annual Temperance Guide</span> from 1867 to 1876. At his father's death in 1876 he took over the pastorate of New Church Street Chapel, where he had lately assisted, but resigned it in 1881 to devote himself entirely to temperance work.<br>
<br>Burns represented the Baptist New Connexion at the centennial conference in America in 1880, acted as secretary to the Temperance Hospital opened in 1881, and was president of the Association of General Baptists held at Norwich in the same year. He was active in promoting temperance legislation, holding that the law should protect the public and not the liquor trade. In a series of annual letters to <span class="italic">The Times</span> (1886&#150;1909), on the national drink bill, he showed a notable grasp of facts and statistics.<br>
<br>Burns was also a director of the Liberator Building Society, which his brother-in-law, Jabez Balfour, founded in 1868 and of which Balfour was chairman. Owing to disapproval of the increase of directors' fees, Burns resigned before the society's failure in October 1892. Subsequently Balfour and other directors were convicted of fraud and sentenced to long terms of imprisonment. Because of this embarrassment the United Kingdom Alliance asked Burns to resign as metropolitan superintendent. When he refused, the post was discontinued.<br>
<br>On 22 December 1853 Burns married Cecile, the only daughter of James and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1183/', "Clara Lucas Balfour")</script>. His wife died at Battersea on 27 March 1897; of his five sons and a daughter, only two sons survived him. He wrote memoirs of his wife (1878) and of his third son (1886), <a name="cosubject_45552"></a><span class="headword">Edward Spenser Burns</span>  (1861&#150;1885)<span class="occ"></span>, who died on 1 March 1885 at Leopoldville, Stanley Pool, on the Lower Congo, after opening up a new route towards the Niadi River, and constructing charts. Burns himself died at his home in Foxmore Street, Battersea Park, on 22 August 1909, and was buried at Paddington on 26 August. Two of his many temperance publications deserve special mention: <span class="italic">The Temperance Bible Commentary</span> (1868), which he wrote with F. R. Lees, went through six English editions, and his two-volume <span class="italic">Temperance History</span> (1889&#150;91) established his reputation as the movement's best historian.<br>
