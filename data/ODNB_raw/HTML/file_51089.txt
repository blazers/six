</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Hart,  Herbert Lionel Adolphus</span>  (1907&#150;1992), <span class="occ">legal philosopher</span>, was born at Harrogate, Yorkshire, on 18 July 1907, the third of four children of Simeon Hart (1871&#150;1953), master tailor and furrier, and his wife, Rose (1874&#150;1953), who helped him in the business. She was the daughter of Samuel Samson and his wife, Fanny (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Rosenthal). His father came of a Jewish family descended from Polish and German immigrants of the nineteenth century named Zadek, who were in the clothing trade in the East End of London. In 1900 the family moved to Harrogate. They had three sons and a daughter. Herbert, as he was known to his friends, always published as H. L. A. Hart.<h2>
<a name="Earlyyearsandeducation19071929"></a>Early years and education, 1907&#150;1929</h2>Hart's family wished their son to have an education suited to orthodox Jews. He was therefore sent to Cheltenham College, a boarding-school with a separate house for Jewish boys, from 1918 to 1921. He looked back on these years as the only unhappy period of his life. The school seemed dull, class-ridden, and obsessed by athletics. He disliked being labelled a Jew, though in later life he came to value his part in the Jewish heritage. Religion did not attract him. Despite a gift for languages he found Hebrew unpalatable. <br>
<br>In 1921 a family set-back came to the rescue. Hart's father, whose business had gone downhill, could no longer afford to keep his son at Cheltenham. Herbert was sent instead to Bradford grammar school. In contrast with Cheltenham he found the school exciting. Good teaching and friendly companionship stimulated an expansion of thought and feeling, with freedom to explore the town and walk in the beautiful countryside on its borders. From E. H. Goddard, the classics master, an admirer of Spengler, he absorbed, along with an interest in the minutiae of language, a taste for large generalizations. In retrospect this period at Bradford (1921&#150;6), where he became head boy, seemed a very happy one. Hart's passionate but opposite reactions to life at the two schools was in character, for he responded strongly to people, ideas, and places. <br>
<br>At Gilbert Murray's suggestion Hart tried successfully in 1926 for a classical scholarship at New College, Oxford. He found the college a place of ravishing beauty, a joy in which to study and, later, teach. He was fairly well off, since his father's fortunes had revived. A tall, lean youth, with fine, intellectual features, rumpled clothes, and awkward gait, his appearance and way of life changed little over the years. Easy in conversation, with never a trace of vanity, his vitality and humour would light up almost any topic. Douglas Jay, a contemporary, noted his strong Yorkshire accent, later lost, and formed a friendship that lasted for more than sixty years. Hart found in H. W. B. Joseph a stimulating tutor, who steered his mind towards Plato and realism. H. A. L. Fisher, the warden of New College, invited him for walks and introduced him to such figures as Lloyd George, Virginia Woolf, and Dean Inge. With Jay and other friends he talked about history and philosophy; at times his friends got more from him than from their tutors. But with an eye to the examinations, in which he needed to prove his worth, he kept a notebook with secret nuggets of information. He had his reward, for in 1929 Hart obtained the best first class of the year in classical Greats. At the Jowett Society, of which he became president, he met in Isaiah Berlin another able young man who was to be a lifelong friend. Berlin was quick to appreciate what was rare in someone of his gifts: complete honesty; for Hart was always ready to modify his assertions, and later, to disavow his writings, in the face of what seemed valid objections.<h2>
<a name="Lawandphilosophywarandmarriage19301952"></a>Law and philosophy, war and marriage, 1930&#150;1952</h2>Hart made up his mind to become a barrister. He joined the Middle Temple and from 1932 until 1940 practised at the Chancery bar along with Richard Wilberforce, John Sparrow, and Duff Dunbar. Of this brilliant quartet Hart emerged as the front runner. The growth of his practice was continuous and increasing, and he much enjoyed the opera, hunting, and travel abroad that his earnings at the bar made possible. But war clouds were gathering and he did not share the prevailing illusions. As Wilberforce records  (private memoir):<blockquote>In 1938 we were together when the news came that Mr Chamberlain was returning with &#145;Peace for our time&#146;. There was applause; there was talk of going to the airport to cheer him home. We just looked at each other with tears in our eyes&#151;it was unnecessary to speak.</blockquote> When war broke out Hart was turned down for military service owing to a mitral murmur, which turned out not to be serious. By then he had fallen in love with <a href="#cosubject_96583">Jenifer Williams [<i>see below</i>]</a>, a civil servant in the Home Office. In May 1940 Hart was recommended at Williams's instance to MI5, in which he served throughout the war. He worked on the Ultra material and made an important contribution to the D-day disinformation plan in 1944. During lulls, when there was nothing to decipher, he made buttons in a factory. His devotion to the work of MI5 was absolute. No whisper of what he was doing escaped him. <br>
<br>Hart, who had to overcome a feeling that he was not really heterosexual, became committed to Jenifer Williams from 1937 onwards and married her on 16 October 1941. They had a daughter and three sons. During the war Hart and Jay were for a time living in the same house, and he also saw something of the philosophers Gilbert Ryle and Stuart Hampshire. His interest in philosophy was rekindled. At the same time his political views moved closer to those of his wife, which were left-wing. He came to feel that his life should not be spent at the bar, minimizing the tax liability of the rich. He became a Labour Party supporter&#151;a democratic socialist with liberal leanings&#151;and remained one for the rest of his life. <br>
<br>These developments led Hart in 1945 to accept what he had rejected before the war, the offer of a philosophy fellowship at New College. The warden of the college, A. H. Smith, engineered Hart's fellowship without advertisement because he saw in him a bulwark against the radical empiricism that was then fashionable. But he was mistaken, for Hart had, under the influence of J. L. Austin, come to abandon Joseph's views and to believe that linguistic analysis was of central importance in philosophy. He was a founder member of the discussion group led by Austin that, from 1947, met on Saturday mornings to discuss such topics as rules. For the first eighteen months at New College he agonized over his capacity to teach philosophy but by 1947, when his wife settled in Oxford, he was committed to academic life. They lived first in New College Lane, then from 1952 at 11 Manor Place, Oxford. Hart was an excellent tutor, who believed that his special gift was for smoothing the path of weaker students. The truth behind this modest self-assessment was that he esteemed clarity the chief intellectual virtue and was notably patient with pupils, whatever their ability. His method was to rub their noses in the two questions &#145;How do you know?&#146; and &#145;What do you mean?&#146;. But he was reluctant to commit himself to print until quite certain that what he had to say was correct. In these seven years he published only three papers and two book reviews. <br>
<br>Hart's first paper (1948&#150;9), &#145;The ascription of responsibility and rights&#146;, foreshadowed his later concern with legal philosophy. Its novel ideas, though he later rejected them, struck a chord both in Britain and the United States. In 1952, at the urging of J. L. Austin, he was persuaded to think of himself as a possible successor to Arthur Goodhart as Oxford professor of jurisprudence. He was not sure that he was good enough as a pure philosopher. Nor did the admiration that came to him later dissipate his doubts about the correctness of his views. His self-critical spirit accounted for the corrections and recorrections, scrawled-over notes, and bundles of paper held together by clips that cluttered his rooms. But he had come to see that many philosophical distinctions could be applied to law and that, given his practice at the bar, he was the person to apply them. Conversely, examples drawn from the law suggested new paths for philosophy to explore.<h2>
<a name="Professorofjurisprudence"></a>Professor of jurisprudence</h2>Hart was elected to the chair of jurisprudence at Oxford in 1952 by a slender majority, on what was by any standards a thin contribution to the subject: three articles and two reviews, one of each being about law. But the choice was inspired. During his tenure of the chair (1952&#150;68) Hart rescued English jurisprudence from its century-long decline and restored it to a central position in moral and political philosophy. He revitalized the positivist tradition stemming from Hume, John Austin, and Bentham. His writings in turn provoked restatements of other currents of opinion. R. M. Dworkin revived the eighteenth-century philosophy of rights that underlay the United States constitution, J. Finnis the still older natural law tradition. Along with positivism went a measured liberalism in political philosophy. Echoing J. S. Mill, Hart called in question the right of the state to force the individual to conform to even the most strongly held moral views of the majority. <br>
<br>As a professor Hart had to overcome his natural diffidence and to lecture and publish more freely. In his mature years the intellectual vigour of his talks could electrify an audience. It did not matter that his notes might be jottings on the back of a chequebook. In the long vacation of 1952, staying at his wife's family property in Cornwall, the new professor scribbled the first draft of the lectures that came out nine years later as <span class="italic">The Concept of Law</span>. Reflection on John Austin's view that a law was the command of a sovereign habitually obeyed led Hart to question the value of definition in law. It prompted his inaugural lecture in 1953, &#145;Definition and theory in jurisprudence&#146;. Instead of trying to define terms such as &#145;law&#146;, &#145;right&#146;, and &#145;corporation&#146; one did better to explain the conditions under which sentences in which they occur are true. He came later to think that this lecture was flawed, but it swept away much futile debate. <br>
<br>In 1952&#150;3 Hart laid the foundations for nearly all his later work. He lectured on rights and duties. The lectures were crowded and were heard with rapt attention, though with some apprehension, as the audience saw the lecturer shuffle from distance to reading glasses, wipe them, mislay them and rediscover their whereabouts, all the while expounding a complex argument. But he was never willing to publish his lectures on rights since, while rejecting the view of Austin and Bentham that only law could create rights, he could not see his way through to a satisfactory alternative. <br>
<br>Another project begun in this year was the study of causation. To take this concept, so central in philosophy, and see how it looked within the law, was the sort of enterprise that had attracted Hart to the chair of jurisprudence. He and A. M. Honor&eacute; gave seminars on causation in this year and the next, and together wrote a book that came out in 1959 as <span class="italic">Causation in the Law</span>. They wrote separate chapters, but mulled over each other's drafts until they agreed on every detail. The work defends common-sense causal distinctions inside and outside the law against the philosophical reproach of being unscientific and the scepticism of some lawyers. <span class="italic">Causation</span>, though a joint enterprise, was Hart's first and largest book and, in retrospect, one of the most substantial volumes to emerge from linguistic philosophy. A second edition, which has been translated into Japanese, was published in 1985. The themes it incorporates have since been taken further by Honor&eacute;. In the same year Hart began a discussion group in A. R. N. (Rupert) Cross's rooms in Magdalen College, which alerted many members of the law faculty to their stultifying neglect of theory. In 1954 he published an edition of John Austin's 1832 classic, <span class="italic">The Province of Jurisprudence Determined</span>, in the introduction to which he insisted on the central place of rules, and the acceptance of rules, in the law. <br>
<br>Hart's visit to the United States in 1956&#150;7 at the invitation of Harvard was a landmark in his career. He was welcomed equally by lawyers and philosophers, who in the past had had little contact. America stimulated him&#151;the noisy, unregulated life of cities; the students, unblas&eacute;, with a vast desire for knowledge; the disdain of Americans for privacy and precision of language; their passion for taking part in decision making. These and other aspects of life in the New World relaxed his neuroses. Five papers stemmed from his US visit. The most important was the Oliver Wendell Holmes lecture at Harvard in April 1957, &#145;Positivism and the separation of law and morals&#146;. A <i>succ&egrave;s de scandale</i>, recognized at once as an enduring contribution to legal philosophy, it drew from Lon Fuller an eloquent critical response. The two were published together in the <span class="italic">Harvard Law Review</span> in 1958. Hart was a positivist only in the limited sense which insists that laws need not reproduce the demands of morality. He thought it essential, in the interests of clarity, to distinguish between law as it is and as it ought to be. Demonstrably iniquitous laws are still laws. But Fuller pointed in reply to an internal morality of law, to which it typically conforms, so that laws that violate this morality are not fully law.<h2>
<a name="Lawandmorality"></a>Law and morality</h2>In 1959&#150;60 Hart was president of the Aristotelian Society, a signal honour for a law professor. In the same year two other debates were launched, both concerned with the functions of criminal law. In September 1957 the Wolfenden committee had recommended that homosexual practices between consenting adults should cease to be criminal. Sir Patrick Devlin, giving the Maccabaean lecture in jurisprudence in 1958, widened the debate by attacking the committee's view that there was a realm of private conduct that was not the law's business. A community had the right to defend the morality which bound it together against attempts to undermine it. Hart counter-attacked with a talk on the BBC, published in <span class="italic">The Listener</span> for 30 July 1959. He reformulated J. S. Mill's argument that the only purpose for which power could rightfully be exercised over a member of a civilized community was to prevent harm to others. Thus began a wide-ranging debate about the proper limits of both criminal and civil law. Hart's views, effectively confined to the criminal law, were developed in two short books, <span class="italic">Law, Liberty and Morality</span> (1963), delivered at Stanford in 1962, and <span class="italic">The Morality of the Criminal Law</span> (1965), given in Jerusalem in 1964. He was moved by a dislike of cruelty masquerading as moral rectitude, which led him to be specially severe on attempts to enforce sexual morality&#151;a view that struck a chord with the young. <br>
<br>The controversy with Devlin made Hart a public figure in Britain. Each was well equipped to fight his corner and their contest has become a classic. But Hart never sought publicity and he eschewed public honours apart from those honorary degrees traditionally conferred on scholars. In 1966 he declined a knighthood. In private debate he was tenacious, but his manner was courteous and impersonal. He excelled in the demanding skill of presenting an opponent's argument cogently. The same quality made him an excellent research supervisor. He read and reread his pupils' drafts with close attention and made dozens of critical comments, but at the same time knew how to foster the promise inherent in their line of thought. A consequence of his intellectual detachment was that Hart's pupils, though deeply influenced by him, never formed a school. Instead they displayed an engaging spectrum of views, ranging from J. M. Finnis's <span class="italic">Natural Law and Natural Rights</span> (1980) to W. J. Waluchow's <span class="italic">Inclusive Legal Positivism</span> (1993). <br>
<br>Hart's &#145;Prolegomenon to the principles of punishment&#146; was also published in 1959. The paper argued that the general aim that justified punishment, that of keeping deviance within bounds, should be distinguished from the conditions in which it was proper to punish a given individual, which should include the fact that the offender had knowingly chosen to break the law. In 1968 eight of his papers on criminal responsibility were collected and published in a volume entitled <span class="italic">Punishment and Responsibility: Essays in the Philosophy of Law</span>. These masterly essays owed a good deal to his friend Rupert Cross, Vinerian professor of English law at Oxford (1964&#150;79). Cross, with his energetic mind and buoyant character, was his closest colleague among lawyers. Hart wrote a memoir of his friend for the <span class="italic">Proceedings of the British Academy</span> (70.405&#150;37).<h2>
<a name="Theconceptoflaw"></a>The concept of law</h2>From 1960 to 1974 Hart was a delegate of the Oxford University Press. Here his most important initiative was to set up a new series of law books, the <span class="roman">Clarendon Law Series</span>. He was struck by the lack of works that introduced students in untechnical language to the problems of the subjects they were to study. The series did much to fill this gap. Hart took great trouble with the manuscripts submitted, and would suggest dozens or hundreds of additions and corrections. <br>
<br>The impulse that led Hart to found the <span class="roman">Clarendon Law Series</span> induced him to publish in 1961, under the title <span class="italic">The Concept of Law</span>, the general course of lectures he had been giving for the last eight years. His aim was to give beginners in jurisprudence a book that was more than a catalogue of great names spiced with superficial comments on their theories. Instead they would be introduced to the main issues in the subject, of which two stood out: the relation of law to brute force on the one hand and to morality on the other. Judged by the pragmatic test of sales <span class="italic">The Concept of Law</span> was a brilliant success. Some 150,000 copies were bought over the next thirty years. The work aroused interest in many countries and has been or is being translated into more than a dozen languages. Its influence extended to people who were not specially interested in law. For Anglo-Saxon writers on jurisprudence criticism of Hart at once replaced criticism of John Austin as the starting point of their thinking. <br>
<br>
<span class="italic">The Concept of Law</span> belongs to the genre &#145;general jurisprudence&#146;. It seeks to lay bare the structure of modern legal systems and to show what it is that separates them from other forms of social control such as morality or brute coercion. The central concept is that of a rule. Rules have internal and external aspects, and every legal system needs a rule by which other legal rules can be recognized. <span class="italic">The Concept of Law</span> is in no sense a work of linguistic philosophy. It concentrates instead on behaviour, on people's attitudes towards rules and their violation. Critics argue that an account of a legal system in terms of behaviour cannot be adequate, for laws at least <i>purport</i> to be morally binding. Hart disagreed. To him legal duties and obligations need be duties and obligations only from the legal point of view. <br>
<br>In 1961&#150;2 Hart spent a year at the University of California at Los Angeles and gave the Harry Camp lectures at Stanford. In November 1961 he met and debated with the octogenarian legal philosopher Hans Kelsen (1881&#150;1973) at Berkeley. They tackled three topics, including the question whether legal and moral norms can conflict. Kelsen was thought to have had the better of the debate, but Hart made some telling points. At one stage he was so startled by Kelsen's insistence, in stentorian tones, that norms were norms and nothing else that he fell over backwards. <br>
<br>In 1964 Hart delivered the Lionel Cohen lectures in Jerusalem. For this, his first visit to Israel, he was at the height of his powers, a dominant figure in legal and political philosophy and the standard-bearer of moral liberalism. He now came to appreciate the richness of Jewish culture. He was captivated by Jerusalem, one of the four cities, he thought, which had made modern culture what it was, the others being Constantinople, Athens, and Rome. Without them &#145;life for me at any rate would be a howling wilderness&#146;  (Wilberforce). Hart was intellectually anchored to the British empirical tradition and, though he loved Greece and Italy for their luminous, southern qualities, he was passionately attached to the English countryside. But his Jewishness shone through in his personal warmth, his sense of humour, and a rich, earthy, unsnobbish view of the world. On this visit he met Joseph Raz, later his doctoral student and the legal philosopher who has succeeded him as the standard-bearer of legal positivism.<h2>
<a name="AdministrationandBentham19671978"></a>Administration and Bentham, 1967&#150;1978</h2>Not a natural administrator or committee man, Hart threw himself with zest into those offices that presented an intellectual challenge. From 1967 to 1973 he was a member of the Monopolies Commission. On it his intelligence and legal acumen were much appreciated. He regretted his lack of training in economics, but filled the gap as best he could by reading. He put searching questions to those who appeared before the commission. These could be disconcerting both for their complexity and from Hart's habit of lowering his head as the question unfolded. <br>
<br>In 1968 Hart was asked by Oxford University to chair a commission on relations with junior members. Lord Franks's commission on the university, reporting in 1966, had dismissed student affairs in three lines. Two years later students were in uproar throughout the Western world. Even in Oxford there were sit-ins, though the <i>enrag&eacute;s</i> were neither particularly numerous nor able. Hart's left-wing views commended him to the student body, his intellectual rigour to the university authorities. He turned the inquiry into a miniature royal commission, to which some 30 dons and 200 students gave evidence. The report suggested reforms of the disciplinary system and the creation of standing joint committees of students and dons, the students to have access to but not membership of the decision-making bodies. Hart wrote a penetrating appendix on student revolt, in itself a significant contribution to political theory. The report was implemented and helped to bring students peacefully into the governance of Oxford, though the unrest would largely have died down in any case, as it did elsewhere. <br>
<br>By the time the commission reported in 1969 Hart had resigned from the chair he had held for sixteen years in order to devote more time to editing the <span class="italic">Collected Works</span> of Jeremy Bentham. He had already begun work on the text of Bentham, poring over his predecessor's scrawl with an enormous magnifying glass. He and J. H. Burns published in 1970 new editions of Bentham's <span class="italic">An Introduction to the Principles of Morals and Legislation</span> and <span class="italic">Of Laws in General</span>. He wanted to make available to a wider public the work of his great predecessor. For the next twelve years he concentrated on Bentham, on whom he planned a big book. This did not come about, but in 1982 he published <span class="italic">Essays on Bentham</span>, containing ten essays. It seemed odd that Hart should be devoted to the man whom Marx pilloried as the pedantic, leather-tongued oracle of bourgeois intelligence. But he was fascinated by Bentham's willingness to plunge into enormous detail to promote a proper understanding of the greatest happiness principle. While Hart turned his attention to Bentham, his successor as professor of jurisprudence in Oxford, R. M. Dworkin, proved a formidable critic of his legal philosophy, though in an epilogue to the second edition of <span class="italic">The Concept of Law</span> published posthumously (1994) Hart contends that Dworkin misrepresents his views. <br>
<br>A number of Oxford colleges made approaches to find out whether Hart would consider presiding over their affairs. In 1973 he accepted an offer from Brasenose College, of which he was principal for the next five years. He enjoyed the new role, and threw himself with energy into the wide range of activities it called for. His brief reign made a mark on the college, whose fellows were at the time rather demoralized. Hart labelled them &#145;Old Turks and Young Fogeys&#146;. He was made uneasy by what, with his austere temperament, he saw as the &#145;Lucullan feasts&#146; enjoyed by the fellows. But he liked talking to the students and was quick both to see their point of view and to take steps to widen their intellectual horizons. Supervising research by a relative of the Tanner family he won the admiration of Obert C. Tanner of Salt Lake City, founder of the Tanner Trust for Human Values. Tanner consequently established an annual lectureship at Oxford to be attached to Brasenose College. The series continues and has been a success.<h2>
<a name="Thelastyears19781992"></a>The last years, 1978&#150;1992</h2>After he retired from Brasenose in 1978 Hart resumed his association with University College, of which he was an honorary fellow, and where he had a room until his death. The 1980s were for him a period of honour interspersed with distress. As early as 1960 Hart had received his first honorary degree in Stockholm. It was followed by twelve other such honours, including two in Israel, three in the United States, and one in Mexico. The Tanner trustees established at University College an annual lecture on jurisprudence and moral philosophy in his honour, the first being given in 1985. A series of essays in his honour, entitled <span class="italic">Law, Morality and Society</span>, edited by P. M. S. Hacker and J. Raz, had been published in 1977. A volume edited by Ruth Gavison, <span class="italic">Issues in Contemporary Legal Philosophy: the Influence of H. L. A. Hart</span>, containing papers for a conference given in his honour in Jerusalem in March 1984, was published in 1987. In 1983 seventeen of his essays were collected and published under the title <span class="italic">Essays in Jurisprudence and Philosophy</span>. <br>
<br>But Hart was not to enjoy an untroubled old age. His wife, more radical than he, a member of the Communist Party from 1935, had by the outbreak of war become disillusioned with communism, to which Hart was strongly opposed. In the early 1980s the press and the BBC, matching her pre-war communism to his wartime work for MI5, wounded them both by imputations of disloyalty. The distress this caused Hart, together with groundless worries about the provision he had made for his youngest son, who was brain damaged at birth, led to a nervous breakdown in 1983. He recovered, but it was a sad ordeal for a loyal citizen who had done sterling work during the war, had always been opposed to communist totalitarianism, and held in contempt the activities of Philby and Blunt when it emerged what they had done. Moreover by the late eighties arthritis and injuries suffered in cycling and motor accidents made him less mobile, and brought to an end the long country walks that had meant so much since his schooldays. He died peacefully at Oxford on 19 December 1992, at the age of eighty-five, and was buried in Wolvercote cemetery, Oxford.<h2>
<a name="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2>Hart doubted the value of his contributions to legal and political philosophy. Introduced at a gathering in the United States as an &#145;intellectual giant&#146; he told his audience that he did not feel like an intellectual giant. By the highest standards the doubts were justified. His achievement was to develop the ideas of Hume, Bentham, John Austin, and J. S. Mill in original and ingenious ways. If his work was less profound than that of Bentham or Kelsen, the two legal philosophers whom he thought most worth studying, in clarity he surpassed them. Critical studies of his work have been or are being published in America, Scotland, Ireland, Germany, Japan, Argentina, Italy, and Poland. Those who came across him as pupils, friends, or colleagues, at lectures, in seminars, or reading what he wrote might suddenly find their view of the world transformed. Almost to the end he retained a boyish enthusiasm for new experiences. He liked people and their foibles, appreciated natural beauty, was widely read in fiction and poetry, and enjoyed classical music. A man of the Enlightenment, his mind was firm and clear, unshakeably hostile to intellectual muddle and the political oppression it fosters. With this uncompromising rigour went the gift of pure human goodness. The intellectual and moral qualities were inseparable. There were of course weaknesses. Hart was naturally inaccurate; at times his enthusiasm for a person or idea led him astray. He was untidy and absent-minded beyond the professional norm. But these were the faults of a man of generous mind, impatient with trivia, who was by common consent the outstanding British legal philosopher of the twentieth century.<br>
<br>Hart's wife, <a name="cosubject_96583"></a><span class="headword">Jenifer Margaret Hart <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Williams]</span></span>  (1914&#150;2005), <span class="occ">civil servant and historian</span>, was born on 29 January 1914 in Chelsea, London, the third of five daughters of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36926/', "Sir John Fischer Williams (1870&#150;1947)")</script>, barrister, and later a member of the British panel on the permanent court of arbitration at The Hague, and his wife, (Eleanor) Marjorie Hay, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Murray (1880&#150;1961), a descendant of John Murray, third duke of Atholl. She was educated at the Lyc&eacute;e Moli&egrave;re and then the Cours F&eacute;nelon in Paris, at Downe House, Newbury, and at Somerville College, Oxford, where she graduated with a first-class degree in 1935. She joined the Communist Party later that year. In 1936 she entered the civil service, having been placed third out of 493 candidates. She chose to work in the Home Office, initially in the children's division, before becoming private secretary to Sir Alexander Maxwell in 1939. She subsequently worked as secretary to the committee hearing appeals against detention orders. She was given special dispensation to remain in the civil service after her marriage. <br>
<br>Two years after the return of peace Jenifer Hart resigned from the civil service, despite her promising career, to join her husband in Oxford. She initially took charge of the programme of university extension lectures in adult education organized by Oxford's extramural department. The department was then a noted centre of socialist intellectuals and teachers opposed to British policy in the early stages of the cold war, and during the two years Hart was there it was the subject of a controversial university investigation into the conduct of certain tutors. A Gwilym Gibbon fellowship at Nuffield College, Oxford, in 1950 enabled her to publish <span class="italic">The British Police</span> (1951), on the strength of which, in 1952, she was elected to a fellowship in modern history at St Anne's College, Oxford. She published little while at St Anne's, but her article &#145;Nineteenth-century social reform: a tory interpretation of history&#146; in <span class="italic">Past and Present</span> (1965) was an important contribution to the academic debate on the development of the British state. Her demonstration of the intellectual and ideological factors influencing the growth of government in the nineteenth century&#151;as opposed to the so-called tory interpretation, which emphasized the role played by well-meaning bureaucrats guided by their experience&#151;was widely accepted by historians. She was a college tutor until her retirement in 1981. In 1992 she published her second book, <span class="italic">Proportional Representation: Critics of the British Electoral System, 1820&#150;1945</span>, an important scholarly study of the development of ideas of electoral reform.<br>
<br>In 1983 Jenifer Hart's unguarded remarks to a <span class="italic">Sunday Times</span> journalist led to an article alleging that she had been a spy, and suggesting that her husband might have passed her information during his wartime work with MI5. Following legal proceedings the <span class="italic">Sunday Times</span> issued a half-hearted apology, but the episode contributed to Herbert Hart's nervous breakdown. In <span class="italic">Spycatcher</span> (1987) Peter Wright alleged that Phoebe Pool (a Soviet spy who committed suicide in 1971) had named Jenifer Hart as a member of an &#145;Oxford ring&#146;, a supposed covert communist cell. In 1998 Hart published her autobiography, <span class="italic">Ask Me No More</span>, in which she revealed that friends in the Communist Party had urged her to join the civil service as a &#145;mole&#146;  (p. 70), though she claimed that she had not been &#145;involved in any deception&#146;  (ibid.), that she had never been asked to pass on any secrets, and that she had left the Communist Party by 1939. She died on 19 March 2005 at the Radcliffe Infirmary, Oxford, of heart failure, and was survived by her four children.<br>
