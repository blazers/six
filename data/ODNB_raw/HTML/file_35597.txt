<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Pownall, Sir  Henry Royds</span>  (1887&#150;1961), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was born in London on 19 November 1887, the second son of Charles Assheton Whately Pownall of St John's Park, Blackheath, London, and his wife, Dora Bourne Royds. C. A. W. Pownall was consulting engineer to the railway bureau of Japan, and between the ages of three and eight Henry lived in Japan. He was educated at Rugby School, entered the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, in 1904, and was commissioned into the Royal Field Artillery in 1906. From 1914 to 1919 he served continuously in France and Belgium, acting as brigade major, Royal Artillery, 17th division, in 1917&#150;18. He was mentioned in dispatches, and was awarded the MC and DSO (1918). On 10 December 1918 Pownall married Lucy Louttit (<i>d</i>. 1950), daughter of William Henderson of Aberdeen and the widow of Captain John Gray, 36th Sikhs, Indian army, killed at Kut al-Amara in 1916; they had one son.<br>
<br>Pownall was brigade major, school of artillery (1924&#150;5) and on the directing staff (general staff officer, grade 2) of the Staff College, Camberley (1926&#150;9): an excellent horseman, he gained the prestigious appointment of whip to the Staff College drag. In 1931 he won a bar to his DSO in action on the north-west frontier of India. From 1933 to 1936 he served on the secretariat of the committee of imperial defence (CID) under Sir Maurice Hankey, who would have been prepared to recommend Pownall as his successor had he not preferred to return to service with troops. From mid-1936 he was commandant of the school of artillery, Larkhill, Salisbury Plain, with the rank of brigadier.<br>
<br>In the 1930s Pownall consistently argued&#151;against the policy of &#145;limited liability&#146; advocated by Captain Basil Liddell Hart and others and favoured by Chamberlain, most other politicians, and many officers&#151;that a continental commitment of the army was probably unavoidable; and he played an important part in eventually getting it accepted as government policy. He wrote in his diary in May 1934 on Chamberlain, &#145;his ideas on strategy would disgrace a board school&#146;  (Bond, <span class="italic">British Military Policy</span>, 200). In January 1938 he wrote of the &#145;most dangerous heresy &hellip; of &#147;limited liability&#148; in a war &hellip; It will be 100%&#151;and even then we may well lose it&#146;  (ibid., 218). He also bitterly criticized Liddell Hart, and impugned his motives. He disliked his criticism of orthodox officers, and believed that his proposed strategy was wrong and that his role of <i>&eacute;minence grise</i>, outside adviser to Leslie Hore Belisha (secretary of state for war, 1937&#150;40), was improper and irresponsible, and that his influence increased the general staff's difficulties in preparing for a continental commitment. Pownall also disliked Liddell Hart's &#145;confused writing and his usual false deductions from History&#146;  (<span class="italic">Chief of Staff</span>, 151). Later, during the war, Pownall and other senior officers opposed his proposed appointment as adviser to David Margesson when secretary of state for war (1940&#150;42).<br>
<br>Pownall's three years at the CID had established his reputation as an exceptionally able staff officer. In the five years before the war he was promoted five times, and his appointment as director of military operations and intelligence at the War Office in January 1938 was a jump of over a hundred places in seniority. Long convinced that war with Germany was inevitable&#151;in 1933 he had guessed that war might come in 1940&#151;he strove first to secure a definite continental commitment for the army. In January 1938 he wrote in his diary, &#145;<i>My</i> view is that support of France is home defence&#151;if France crumbles we fall&#146;  (Bond, <span class="italic">British Military Policy</span>, 286). Nevertheless he distrusted French politicians and the French army. In the few months remaining (April&#150;August 1939), he worked all-out to prepare the British expeditionary force (BEF) to go to France.<br>
<br>At the War Office Pownall enjoyed excellent relations with Lord Gort VC (chief of the Imperial General Staff, 1937&#150;9) whom he much admired, and Gort selected him as his chief of staff (CGS) when appointed to command the BEF on the outbreak of war; although this entailed&#151;as in 1914&#151;that the two men who knew most about military organization and planning were suddenly removed from the War Office. Pownall, Gort, and other officers detested Hore-Belisha, believing him conceited, ignorant, self-seeking, and untrustworthy. Pownall in May 1939 in his diary contrasted Gort and Hore-Belisha: &#145;a great gentleman and an obscure, shallow-brained, charlatan, political Jewboy&#146;  (<span class="italic">Chief of Staff</span>, 203). He wrote that Hore-Belisha intended &#145;to bitch up the higher organization of the Army in order to make the position of CIGS impossible&#146;  (ibid., 206).<br>
<br>After the 1939 &#145;pill box affair&#146;&#151;during which Gort and other senior officers expressed resentment at what they considered unjustified criticism and interference by Hore-Belisha on the BEF's construction of concrete &#145;pill box&#146; defences in France&#151;Pownall played a considerable part behind the scenes in securing Chamberlain's dismissal of Hore-Belisha (4 January 1940). He wrote in his diary, &#145;it's no good being Old School Tie with H-B, you have to fight him with his own weapons&#146;  (<span class="italic">Chief of Staff</span>, 264). During the 1940 retreat to Dunkirk, Pownall set an admirable example of calmness and foresight, working closely with Gort in the final phase to extricate the BEF from encirclement. He was mentioned in dispatches and appointed KBE (1940).<br>
<br>Unlike Gort, Pownall retained Churchill's confidence, and he was given a succession of important commands in potential trouble-spots. After a few months as the first inspector-general of the Local Defence Volunteers (later the Home Guard) he was commander-in-chief of British forces in Northern Ireland (1940&#150;41) when German invasion was still a real possibility. When the threat had waned he returned to the War Office in May 1941 as vice-chief of the Imperial General Staff. In November 1941 the replacement of Sir John Dill by Sir Alan Brooke as chief of the Imperial General Staff led to a reshuffle of senior officers at the War Office and Pownall was appointed commander-in-chief, Far East. However, Japan entered the war against Britain and the United States before he could effectively take up his command, and in January 1942 he became chief of staff to Wavell in the short-lived south-west Pacific command. He was promoted lieutenant-general in 1942 and in April took over the Ceylon command, a post he held for exactly a year. Once again the enemy robbed him of the opportunity to demonstrate his capacity as a commander, and when the Japanese advance had clearly been arrested he was appointed commander-in-chief, Persia&#150;Iraq, succeeding Sir Henry Maitland Wilson, but he wanted to escape from what he regarded as a backwater into the Mediterranean theatre.<br>
<br>In the summer of 1943 Mountbatten had been appointed to the new south-east Asia command, and Brooke&#151;with Churchill's approval&#151;selected Pownall as a highly experienced staff officer, &#145;a wise old head&#146;, to supply a steadying influence as chief of staff: Pownall saw his role as, in his favourite phrase, &#145;to keep, Mountbatten on the rails&#146;  (<span class="italic">Chief of Staff</span>, xiv). This proved an excellent choice so far as personal relations with Mountbatten and the creation of the large and complex SEAC inter-allied staff headquarters were concerned; but in strategic terms Pownall's term of office was largely characterized by frustrating changes of plan due to the theatre's low priority in the allies' grand strategy. In November 1944 Pownall's health broke down, and he retired from the army early in 1945, receiving a KCB (1945). From 1942 to 1952 he was colonel commandant, Royal Artillery.<br>
<br>Pownall was a first-class staff officer, orthodox, not an original thinker, and between the wars lukewarm on mechanization. He was aptly described by his friend and successor as deputy secretary to the CID, Lord Ismay, as &#145;one of the best brains of my vintage in the Army, courageous, competent and cool as cucumber&#146;  (Ismay, 124). Lieutenant-General Sir Wilfrid Lindsell, who served with &#145;Henry&#146;, as he was universally known, as quartermaster-general of the BEF in 1939&#150;40, wrote of him:<blockquote>He certainly possessed all the qualities for success in any branch of Staff work or in Command. He had the essential basis of sturdy commonsense, a well-balanced knowledge of his profession, no fear of taking responsibility and plenty of initiative and energy &hellip; of a serious turn of mind and always imperturbable in a crisis &hellip; Quick and precise in manner, he was an energetic worker, bringing to the solution of all his problems a clear well-ordered mind. To all who served under him he was a quiet, courteous and sympathetic chief. He had a remarkable memory and was a masterly writer of minutes and reports. (<span class="italic">Royal Artillery Regimental News</span>, Aug 1961, 297&#150;8)</blockquote>Wavell also found him an ideal senior staff officer.<br>
<br>Pownall was appointed chief commissioner of the St John Ambulance Brigade in 1947, and became vice-chancellor of the order of St John in 1950 and chancellor in 1951. He was chairman of Friary Meux Ltd and a member of the committee of Lloyds Bank. For six years he assisted Churchill as military consultant on the <span class="italic">History of the Second World War</span>. His chief relaxations were skiing, fly-fishing, and golf. He was an accomplished linguist and a delightful conversationalist with a dry sense of humour. Pownall died in London on 9 June 1961.<br>
