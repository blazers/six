</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Collins,  John Churton</span>  (1848&#150;1908), <span class="occ">university extension teacher and advocate of the academic study of English literature</span>, was born on 26 March 1848 at Bourton on the Water, Gloucestershire, the eldest of the three sons of Henry Ramsay Collins, physician, and his wife, Maria, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Churton (<i>d</i>. 1898), of Chester. His father died of consumption on 6 June 1858 at Melbourne, on a visit to Australia as a ship's doctor, and from this time John Churton (<i>d</i>. 1884), his mother's brother, paid for his education. He attended Ellesmere School, from which the headmaster, J. D. Day, wrote to his mother in 1862, suggesting that Collins was &#145;unfitted for the duties of a clerk in an office. &hellip; His mind is, as you say, quite set on literary pursuits&#146;  (Collins, 11). He went on to recommend that she send him to a school where more classics were taught, and so Collins entered King Edward's School, Birmingham, in 1863, under the headmaster Charles Evans and, as a potential university candidate, was placed in the classics department. He was entirely self-taught in English literature, through wide and voracious independent reading, in the course of which he committed whole texts to memory.<br>
<br>Financed by his uncle, allegedly to become a clergyman, Collins entered Balliol College, Oxford, on 20 April 1868, where his fellow students included Andrew Lang, Herbert Asquith, and Alfred Milner. Perhaps Collins felt the need to impress in such company, and so affected the jaunty mannerisms of a promising literary man, flaunting a velvet coat and being accompanied by a deerhound called Prince: an ironic pose for someone later renowned for his antipathy to the aesthetic movement. Collins had no great admiration for the then master of Balliol, Benjamin Jowett, and on Jowett's death in 1893, Collins wrote that although he was &#145;kind and good &hellip; to others &hellip; my experience [was] much otherwise&#146;  (Collins, 131). It was his tutor T. H. Green who had the major impact on his development. As Collins later put it: &#145;For two or three terms he was my College Tutor. No man had greater influence or was so deeply respected by the best men of my time&#146;  (ibid., 53).<br>
<br>Collins's notebooks from his Oxford years indicate that he emulated other self-respecting undergraduates of his day, and simply absorbed English literature as he went along. Thus he read histories of English and European literature, especially the volumes of Thomas Warton's <span class="italic">History of English Poetry</span> (1774&#150;8) and Henry Hallam's <span class="italic">Introduction to the Literature of Europe</span> (1837&#150;9). It was Collins's overriding interest in literature as a reflection of life that made him the knowledgeable critic and biographer he eventually became. By reading English literature side by side with the classics, he developed an &#145;obsessive concern with questions of literary influence &hellip; [that] led him to insist that, wherever possible, ancient and modern literature must be studied together&#146;  (Kearney, 5). Andrew Lang recalled that Collins &#145;always reminded me outwardly of Will Ladislas [<i>sic</i>] in the then new novel <span class="roman">&#147;Middlemarch&#148;</span>. He was slimly built and very active&#146;  (Collins, 17). However, in 1872, Collins was awarded only a second-class honours degree, with no chance of pursuing an academic career. Since he no longer wished to enter the church, his uncle withdrew financial support and they never met again.<br>
<br>Like many before, and since, Collins found himself, in 1872, with an Oxford degree, expensive tastes, empty pockets, and no prospects. Yet he never really left Oxford, returning during most vacations to stay in lodgings. Lacking helpful friends to provide letters of introduction to prominent editors, Collins wrote his first &#145;turn-over&#146; article, published in <span class="italic">The Globe</span> newspaper during December 1878. However, the income from his contributions to the daily press was hardly enough to live on and, at times, Collins was wholly dependent on non-literary pursuits, and chiefly the speed with which he could address envelopes (he received 2<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>. per thousand).<br>
<br>By 1873 Collins was employed by William Baptiste Scoones at his coaching school in Garrick Street as tutor in English literature and classics, preparing students for the civil service. Many of them were Oxford and Cambridge graduates who had never studied English literature formally, but needed it none the less for the Indian Civil Service examinations, originally set in 1855 by a committee which had included both Jowett and T. B. Macaulay. In later life Collins often referred to this when berating universities for neglecting the teaching of English literature. His fourteen years of tutoring for Scoones developed his great talent for teaching, and gave him time and opportunity to ponder educational issues in depth.<br>
<br>Following Trollope's advice, in <span class="italic">The Duke's Children</span>, that &#145;no young man should dare to neglect literature&#146;, Collins carried it further than most by his mania for facts and details about famous men, either where they lived or were buried. His curiosity and writing also extended to the criminal element, and led him to interview the claimant in the Tichborne case, and he also became a frequent visitor to police stations and mortuaries  (Kearney, 18&#150;19). He also sent flattering letters to literary men and, in this way, he met Thomas Carlyle after writing to him for advice and guidance in 1874. In later life, he followed Carlyle's recommendation to add a knowledge of German to his repertoire of French, Greek, Latin, and Italian. In 1874 Macmillan's commissioned and published Collins's first book, <span class="italic">Sir Joshua Reynolds as a Portrait Painter</span>, for which he wrote brief commentaries on twenty portraits.<br>
<br>Another well-known figure to whom Collins wrote was Algernon Swinburne, himself a Balliol man, who was impressed by Collins's plan to edit <span class="italic">The Plays and Poems of Cyril Tourneur</span>, the Jacobean dramatist, and on the book's publication in 1878 Collins dedicated it to Swinburne. Unfortunately, later editors found it a careless and inadequate edition, although T. S. Eliot was convinced that &#145;Collins' introduction is by far the most penetrating interpretation of Tourneur that has been written&#146;  (Eliot, <span class="italic">Selected Essays</span>, 1951, 189).<br>
<br>It was in 1878, however, that Collins truly arrived on the London literary scene. His first periodical article appeared in the March 1878 issue of the <span class="italic">Cornhill Magazine</span>, and it was followed by pieces in <span class="italic">Temple Bar</span> and the <span class="italic">Quarterly Review</span>. He also became better acquainted with literary figures, associating with men such as William Rossetti and Mark Pattison, and establishing an extensive social circle that was later to include Arthur Conan Doyle, with whom he was to establish a dining club known as the Murder Club. His improving prospects enabled Collins to marry, on 11 April 1878, Pauline Mary Strangways, the only daughter of the solicitor Thomas Henry Strangways. They had been involved for some time; in the previous January she had given birth to the first of their seven children, Laurence Churton Collins, who was to become his father's first biographer.<br>
<br>From 1880 onwards Collins found a new outlet for his great energy, lecturing for the London Society for the Extension of University Teaching, one of the most influential creative educational forces in the last quarter of the nineteenth century. Collins and such friends as Henry Morley used their teaching as a power base for securing the admission of English literature as a subject for study in the curricula of British universities. Collins also lectured for the Oxford Extension Society and delivered more than 10,000 lectures  (Collins, 231) throughout the midlands and southern England, until his last presentation in Kingston, in 1907. This lecturing and teaching (which also included a great deal of marking) provided Collins with his first regular income of &pound;30 per course. In total, he taught at seventy different centres, delivering fifteen weekly lectures, six days a week, in places as far apart as Birmingham and Brighton. A train enthusiast, who often rode on the footplate, he used the railways extensively in the pursuit of this work. On top of all of this, Collins often worked until the early hours of the morning, writing articles for the literary journals&#151;in total he produced more than fifty substantial articles, often more than fifty printed pages long. These often took him months of concentrated work, and he regularly collected and republished them in book form.<br>
<br>Between January 1880 and July 1881 Collins published three articles on Tennyson's poetry in the <span class="italic">Cornhill Magazine</span>, where he continued exploring his theme of the relationship between classical and modern literature and how the study of one must be allied with that of the other. So Collins illustrated &#145;how [Tennyson's] <span class="italic">In Memoriam</span> was suggested by Petrarch; his <span class="italic">Dream of Fair Women</span> by Chaucer; his <span class="italic">Dora</span> is the versification of a story by Miss Mitford&#146;  (J. C. Collins, <span class="italic">The Study of English Literature: a Plea for its Recognition and Organization at the Universities</span>, 1891, 7&#150;8). Collins went on to state that &#145;as is usual with him in all cases where he borrows, the details of the work are his own; he has added grace, elaboration, and symmetry. A rough crayon draught has been metamorphosed into a perfect picture&#146;  (ibid., 58). Even so, by maintaining that Tennyson's poetry was so directly indebted to the work of earlier authors, Collins opened up the possibility of accusations of plagiarism, or at least of a distinct lack of originality. Tennyson, naturally, was less than pleased, and exercised his anger by referring to Collins as &#145;the louse on the locks of literature&#146;  (Charteris, 197), perhaps echoing Robert Burns's poem &#145;Ode to a Louse&#146;. Yet, in later editions of his poetry, Tennyson quietly slipped in some of Collins's references  (Pattison, 7) and Collins himself later edited selections of Tennyson's poetry, publishing his essays in expanded book form as <span class="italic">Illustrations of Tennyson</span> in 1891.<br>
<br>Collins's notoriety among the British literati increased with the publication of his review of John Addington Symonds's <span class="italic">Shakespere's Predecessors in English Drama</span> (1884). Collins began his review in April of that year, but took such care over it that it was not until October 1885 that his fifty-one pages appeared in the <span class="italic">Quarterly Review</span>. Collins wrote that:<blockquote>what we found was, we regret to say, every indication of precipitous haste, a style which where it differs from the style of extemporary journalism differs for the worse&#151;florid, yet commonplace; full of impurities; a narrative clogged with endless repetitions, without symmetry, without proportion. (<span class="italic">Quarterly Review</span>, 161, October 1885, 330&#150;31)</blockquote>This was Collins's way of arguing the case for critical discipline and scholarly rigour in advocating that English literature be made a subject of serious critical study. It was also his way of distancing himself from those, like Swinburne and the aesthetic movement, whom he felt would reduce &#145;criticism to mere impression and personal caprice&#146;  (Kearney, 56). Collins's review helped to establish his credentials as the follower of Thomas Carlyle and Matthew Arnold.<br>
<br>After the failure of his candidature for the newly established Merton professorship of English literature at Oxford in 1885, Collins wrote an article in the <span class="italic">Quarterly Review</span> for October 1886 entitled &#145;English literature at the universities&#146;. In it he denounced the first Clark lecturer appointed at Cambridge University, Edmund Gosse, whose book <span class="italic">From Shakespeare to Pope: an inquiry into the causes and phenomena of the rise of classical poetry in England</span> was based on his lecture series. The historian Joseph Baylen comments how Collins was &#145;motivated by a blend of envy and contempt for Gosse's pretentious and careless scholarship, [and] was quite right in his criticism of the book as &#147;a mass of error and inaccuracy&#148;&#146; in which centuries and even poetry and prose were confused and garbled. Gosse, charged Collins, was guilty of &#145;ephemeral literal journalism&#146; and &#145;an offence to sound scholarship&#146;  (Baylen, 127). As another modern scholar more succinctly observed: &#145;If Collins was a louse on the locks of literature, Gosse was something of a flea on the skirts of scholarship&#146;  (Sutherland, <span class="italic">Times Literary Supplement</span>, 26 Jan 1973, 75).<br>
<br>Collins collected the views of leading men on the proposal to include English literature in university curricula, and published them in the <span class="italic">Pall Mall Gazette</span> (December 1886). Several other articles followed, incorporated into <span class="italic">The Study of English Literature</span> (1891), and Collins's modern biographer comments on the volume's significance when he states that: &#145;when the English tripos was being set up at Cambridge [in 1919], Collins's book was still being used by the English propagandists&#146;  (Kearney, 154). Oxford University eventually established a final honours school in English in 1894 and in 1903 set up a chair in English literature. Whatever the squabbles in the London literary world, Collins was viewed as an ideal spokesman for literary education, as well as a powerful propagandist for the extension movement. His audiences in Richmond had included members of the royal family, and, in London, Margot Tennant had attended his classes before marrying his old college friend H. H. Asquith. His reputation spread to the United States and, in 1894, he lectured for the American University Extension Society in New York and Philadelphia, as well as at Harvard and Yale universities. Also in 1894, Collins was appointed to the staff of the <span class="italic">Saturday Review</span>, alongside H. G. Wells and George Bernard Shaw, under Frank Harris's editorship, and Collins spent most of his &#145;free&#146; Sundays writing his contributions for the following Saturday's issue of the <span class="italic">Review</span>.<br>
<br>Collins published more than twenty books, edited another twenty textbooks, and served as general editor for the publisher Edward Arnold's <span class="italic">Shakespeare and British Classics for Schools</span>. In 1904, after several attempts elsewhere, Collins was finally rewarded with a chair of English literature at the new University of Birmingham, and was awarded an honorary doctorate by Durham University in 1905. Never one to rest on his laurels, nor jealously to guard the provenance of English literature's place, once gained, within the curriculum, from June 1907 he was involved in negotiations with Birmingham journalists on the establishment of a school of journalism in the university, and wrote on the topic in the <span class="italic">Nineteenth Century</span> for February 1908. The debate inaugurated by these articles contributed to the decision, in 1910, between London University and the Institute of Journalists, to set up a university course for journalists, which started in 1919  (Hunter, 1982).<br>
<br>In July 1908 Collins made his usual vacation visit to Oxford and, on a visit to Lowestoft, Suffolk, died in mysterious circumstances on 12 September. His body was found in a shallow dyke at Carlton Colville, Oulton Broad, with a bottle of sedatives lying nearby. An inquest on 18 September 1908 returned a verdict of accidental death and he was buried in Oulton churchyard; his widow was subsequently awarded a civil-list pension of &pound;100 in 1909.<br>
