<span class="headword">Torre,  James</span>  (1649&#150;1699), <span class="occ">antiquary</span>, was the son of Gregory Torre of Bourne, Lincolnshire, and Anne, the daughter of John Farr of Epworth, Lincolnshire. He was born in April 1649 and baptized at Haxey, Lincolnshire, on 30 April 1649. He was educated at Belton School and entered Magdalene College, Cambridge, in June 1666. He matriculated in 1667 and was admitted to the Inner Temple the following year. Among his contemporaries at the Inner Temple was the London antiquary Henry Keepe, who shared Torre's interest in ecclesiastical antiquities and genealogy and whose works include a manuscript account of the city of York compiled in the 1680s. It is uncertain when or why Torre settled at York, but the reason may be linked to his marriage to Elizabeth, daughter of William Lincoln DD of Bottesford, Lincolnshire.<br>
<br>In York, Torre devoted himself to research on the ecclesiastical antiquities of Yorkshire. The first of the resulting five folio volumes of his collections is entitled &#145;Antiquities ecclesiastical of the city of York concerning churches, parochial conventual chapels, hospitals, and gilds, and in them chantries and interments, also churches parochial and conventual within the archdeaconry of the West Riding, collected out of publick records and registers, <span class="smallcap">AD</span> 1691&#146;. The subsequent volumes cover the other archdeaconries in the county and the peculiar jurisdictions. All the volumes are indexed and provide indexes for the ecclesiastical records he used as well as preserving material that would otherwise have been lost. He compiled lists of parochial incumbents from the records of institutions in the registers of the archbishops of York and supplemented this material from the registers of the dean and chapter. He also searched the wills proved at York, extracting from them all clauses relating to the interments of testators and appending these to the accounts of the relevant churches. He omitted little and his errors in relation to dates are rare, although he is less reliable on names. The date given in the first volume corresponds with the appointment of John Sharp as archbishop of York; this consolidation of Torre's researches was presumably instigated by the archbishop, who shared his antiquarian interests and subsequently acquired the volumes. Sharp used Torre's collections in the production of his own account of the rights and revenues of his office, and after the archbishop's death they were presented to the chapter library by his executors. Torre was never a purely ecclesiastical antiquary, as is suggested by his interest in the location of interments, and his interest in genealogy led him to compile five folio volumes entitled &#145;English nobility and gentry, or, Supplemental collections to Sir William Dugdale's <i>Baronage</i>&#146;. These represented amended transcriptions of Dugdale's work with the addition of the genealogies of less socially elevated families. Torre was a friend of Ralph Thoresby, who used his manuscripts in the compilation of <span class="italic">Ducatus Leodiensis</span> (1715), and they have been widely used by subsequent topographers of Yorkshire and those working in neighbouring counties. Francis Drake, who was particularly beholden to his predecessor's work, described his own history of York as &#145;but a key to some part of Torre's collections&#146;  (<span class="italic">Eboracum</span>, 1736, preface).<br>
<br>Torre's first marriage was childless. On 24 April 1694 he married Anna, the daughter of Nicholas Lister of Leeds, and a son, Nicholas, was born the following year. In 1699 he purchased the manor of Syndale, near Wakefield, but died on 31 July 1699 of a contagion then prevalent in the area. He was buried at Normanton, Yorkshire. His continuing status as a local antiquary is attested by the association of his name with a slim volume entitled <span class="italic">The Antiquities of York</span> (1719), presumably to give the work spurious authority twenty years after his death.<br>
