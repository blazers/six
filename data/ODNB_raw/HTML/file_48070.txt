<span class="headword">Morris,  John</span>  (1823&#150;1905), <span class="occ">lawyer and businessman</span>, was born on 12 December 1823 at South Molton, Devon, the third of four children of George Morris, a wool-stapler, and his wife, Elizabeth Hutchings. He had one brother, William Morris, later a promoter of tramways, and two sisters. Educated privately, he then served for three years (1838&#150;41) as a clerk in the offices of Gilberd Pearse, a local solicitor, before moving to the London office of William Ashurst. After completing his articles, Morris joined Ashurst as a partner in 1854. In the same year Morris married Sarah Taylor; they had six children.<br>
<br>In 1862, following the appointment of William Ashurst to the post of solicitor to the General Post Office, Morris became senior partner. By this time the most important clients of Ashurst and Morris were the merchant bankers James Morrison and his son Charles Morrison, and it was this connection that was to lead to the transformation of the firm John Morris now managed. Soon to be styled Ashurst, Morris, Crisp, the business became one of the first British law firms to specialize in corporate business.<br>
<br>As a solicitor, Morris played a part in numerous company liquidations, rescues, and reconstructions, especially of railway and urban utility companies. The Grand Trunk Railway Company of Canada retained him to work, along with Sir Edward Watkin, on the measures that led to the <span class="roman">Grand Trunk Arrangement Act</span> of 1863. Morris was also involved in the affairs of a number of other ailing North American railways, including the Great Eastern Railway in Canada and, in the United States, the Erie, the Wabash, and the Baltimore and Ohio. But it was as a company director, an organizer of long-term investment syndicates, and a provider of management services that Morris was to be best-known during the later years of his career.<br>
<br>Following his clients the Morrisons into Latin America, Morris became solicitor in 1881 to the River Plate Trust Loan and Agency Company Ltd, a company founded to salvage the failed Mercantile Bank of the River Plate, in which Charles Morrison had invested heavily. Morris became a director of the River Plate Trust in 1883 and chairman the following year, a position he was to occupy for more than twenty years. The Trust company was to be one of the most profitable of British investments in Argentina, yielding an annual average return of 16.5 per cent to its ordinary shareholders between 1881 and 1905. Moreover, it provided the managerial and financial core of a group of more than a dozen London-registered Anglo-South American railway, utility, land, and financial companies with a combined capital of about &pound;7 million, most of whom were also clients of Ashurst, Morris, Crisp.<br>
<br>Notoriously shy, and well known as someone who conducted business through lieutenants, Morrison appears to have withdrawn from daily engagement with these Latin American businesses by the 1880s, preferring the roles of rentier and collector. He continued to hold about &pound;0.5 million in shares of Anglo-South American companies in the 1890s, but it was Morris, whose own River Plate investments amounted to &pound;100,000, who maintained meticulously detailed correspondence with local managers of the half-dozen companies with which he was closely associated. Morris also constructed, sometimes with, and sometimes independently of, Morrison, but almost always working closely with the stockbroker Sir William Cuthbert Quilter, numerous investment syndicates including those responsible for the famous railway bridge over the Firth of Forth, Scotland, the introduction of telephones to London, the construction of the first underground railway in the City (the District line), and the waterworks of Saratov and Beirut. By 1895, the corporate clients of Ashurst, Morris, Crisp numbered close to 150, divided more or less equally between Britain, the Americas, and the rest of the world. The legal business arising from these multifarious connections yielded profits of &pound;117,851 to Ashurst, Morris, Crisp in 1891 on a fee income of over &pound;600,000.<br>
<br>Morris had a long and wide-ranging business career. Heavily involved in railways and public utilities, he also organized a syndicate to buy the Liberal newspaper the <span class="italic">Daily News</span> in 1868. However, he seldom went to the City of London after 1898, preferring to spend his summers in the south of France and the remainder of the year at Abbot's Cliff House, near Folkestone. He died at his London town house, 34 Hyde Park Square, on 22 March 1905. He fainted while in his bath, and his death was due to asphyxia from drowning. He was buried at Highgate cemetery.<br>
