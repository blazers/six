<span class="headword">Smith,  Edwin William</span>  (1876&#150;1957), <span class="occ">missionary and anthropologist</span>, was born on 7 September 1876 in Aliwal North, Cape Colony, where his father, the Revd John Smith (later president of the Primitive Methodist church), was serving as a missionary. He was one of five brothers and two sisters. He completed his education at Elmfield College, York, and returned to southern Africa in 1898 as a mission teacher of the Primitive Methodist church, in Basutoland. In 1899 he married Julia, daughter of James Fitch of Peasenhall, Suffolk; they had one daughter. In 1902 Smith moved to Northern Rhodesia, where he established Kasenga mission. Apart from his evangelistic work Smith made significant linguistic studies and in 1920 published (with Captain A. M. Dale) a classic ethnography, <span class="italic">The Ila-Speaking Peoples of Northern Rhodesia</span>.<br>
<br>After returning to Europe in 1915 Smith served for a year as a military chaplain in France before joining the British and Foreign Bible Society, first as its secretary in Rome and then in other capacities, rising to be its editorial superintendent (1933&#150;9). During these years, when social and educational policy became important concerns of colonial administration in Africa, he emerged as an articulate spokesman of what might be called &#145;the progressive missionary outlook&#146;. Smith strongly supported the work of the Phelps&#150;Stokes commissions on African education in 1920&#150;24, and the foundation of the International African Institute in 1926. He took a leading part in the epochal missionary conference at Le Zoute, Belgium, on which he based his study, <span class="italic">The Christian Mission in Africa</span> (1926).<br>
<br>Smith's most influential book, <span class="italic">The Golden Stool</span> (1926), which went through five impressions in its first year, addressed the issue of &#145;culture contact&#146; in Africa. Its theme of &#145;the disintegration of African social life&#146; pointed to a concept of applied anthropology&#151;&#145;a dynamic science of man in the service of Africa&#146;&#151;which Smith was to advocate over the next two decades. Other writings of his later years spoke more of the missionary in him: the influential symposium he edited, <span class="italic">African Ideas of God</span> (1950), and a series of missionary biographies, of Robert Moffat (1925), the Mabilles of Basutoland (1939), Lindley of Natal (1949), and Price of Bechuanaland (1957). His <span class="italic">Aggrey of Africa</span> (1929), a study of a leading African educator in the Gold Coast, is perhaps the best expression of his Christian, liberal, and multiracial ideals.<br>
<br>Smith was elected president of the Royal Anthropological Institute for 1933&#150;5. He was awarded the Rivers memorial medal in 1931 and the silver medal of the Royal African Society in 1939; he gave the Frazer lecture in 1946 and the Henry Myers lecture in 1952. Between 1939 and 1944 he spent several years teaching in North America, at Hartford Seminary and at Fisk University, and he received an honorary DD from Wesley College, Winnipeg.<br>
<br>The variety of Smith's endeavours was informed by a vision of great coherence and simplicity. Tolerance and generosity were the keynotes of his relations with his colleagues and younger associates. He lived in retirement in Deal, Kent. He died in Victoria Hospital, Deal, on 23 December 1957.<br>
