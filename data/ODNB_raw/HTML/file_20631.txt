<span class="headword">O'Hanlon,  Redmond</span>  (<em>c.</em>1640&#150;1681), <span class="occ">outlaw</span>, was born near Poyntzpass, co. Armagh, the son of Laughlin O'Hanlon. This is the account given in a contemporary pamphlet <span class="italic">The Life and Death of &hellip; Redmon O'Hanlon</span>. Claims that O'Hanlon served in the armies of the confederate Catholics, fled to France in 1653, and there served with distinction in the army of Louis XIV, would make him much older; however these appear only in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries and are not supported by any contemporary record. The same, contemporary, pamphlet's report that O'Hanlon attended an English school, along with Sir Francis Brewster's description of him after his death as &#145;a scholar and a man of parts&#146;  (Carte, 4.617), suggest that his family had some social standing, but no further details are available.<br>
<br>O'Hanlon, once again according to the account in <span class="italic">The Life and Death</span>, began his career as a servant of Sir George Acheson of Markethill, co. Armagh. Having been caught trying to sell a stolen horse he fled the area, finding employment as servant to a &#145;fanatic teacher&#146;, who subsequently made him clerk of his congregation. About 1660 O'Hanlon returned to Armagh where he was first a poll tax collector, then a farmer of the hearth tax. Unable to meet his liabilities in the latter position, and having run through the marriage portion brought him by his first wife, who died young, he turned to crime, in alliance with a kinsman, Laughlin O'Hanlon, whose sister he took as his second wife. On 14 December 1674 both men were proclaimed as outlaws, the first reference to O'Hanlon's activities in official records.<br>
<br>Contemporary and later accounts suggest that O'Hanlon commanded a band of outlaws based in the area of Slieve Gullion, from where they raided the counties of Armagh, Monaghan, and Down, and collected tribute in exchange for their protection. A second proclamation, in 1676, offering a reward for his capture, confirms his continued career as an outlaw. But it is only in 1678&#150;9 that his name begins to appear in official correspondence as a major threat. In October 1678 he was singled out, under the nickname Count O'Hanlon, as the leading tory (bandit) in Ulster  (<span class="italic">Ormonde MSS</span>, new ser., 4.213). Sir George Rawdon, on 31 May 1679, reported that he was still alive but &#145;has had many scapes lately very narrowly and was wounded&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1679&#150;80</i>, 161). His notoriety further increased when, on 9 September 1679, men identified as his followers killed Henry St John, owner of an estate near Tandragee and great-nephew of Sir Oliver St John, lord deputy of Ireland, 1616&#150;22.<br>
<br>London newsheets in the first three months of 1680 report intensive searches for O'Hanlon. Intelligence passed to the government in October of that year alleged that he planned to join sixteen outlaws from Londonderry and co. Tyrone on a raid into co. Longford, wearing grey coats lined with red which they could reverse in order to pass for soldiers. The following month O'Hanlon, through the Annesley family of Castlewellan, made overtures for a surrender on terms. However, these were rejected by the Irish privy council, apparently overruling the lord lieutenant, Ormond. Meanwhile O'Hanlon had come to the notice of proponents of the Popish Plot. Henry Jones, bishop of Meath, Mrs Annesley's father, suggested that he might give evidence regarding plans for a French invasion. Sworn informations from two Irish witnesses later alleged that Shaftesbury and his accomplice William Hetherington had tried to have O'Hanlon and others brought to England to incriminate Ormond and members of the Irish council. Earlier, in 1678&#150;9, there had been obscure intrigues involving another figure in the plot, Edmund Murphy, parish priest of Killevey, co. Armagh, who presented himself in a pamphlet as having opposed O'Hanlon's depredations, although other evidence suggests that he himself had links with local tories.<br>
<br>On 4 March 1681 Ormond gave William Lucas of Down a commission granting full power to act against O'Hanlon. Lucas made contact with O'Hanlon's foster brother, Art O'Hanlon, who on the afternoon of 25 April shot Redmond O'Hanlon as he slept in a cabin near Eight Mile Bridge, co. Down. An account of the killing published soon after reported that a companion, acting on the dying man's instructions, removed his head to prevent it being captured and exhibited. However, it was subsequently found and placed on a spike over the entrance to Downpatrick gaol. His body was displayed at Newry, co. Down.<br>
<br>Memories of O'Hanlon's career were preserved in John Cosgrave's <span class="italic">A Genuine History of the Lives and Actions of the Most Notorious Irish Highwaymen, Tories and Rapparees</span>, first published some time before 1747 and many times reprinted. He was later the subject of a novel by William Carleton (1862), as well as of other works of fiction and popular history. Modern historians remain divided on how far his career, like that of other &#145;tories&#146; of the Restoration era, should be seen as a rearguard action by the dispossessed Catholic &eacute;lite against the new order created by the Cromwellian confiscations, or as an example of the banditry endemic on the periphery of early modern states. The O'Hanlons had at one time been an important Gaelic lineage in south Armagh, and the nickname Count O'Hanlon, used in contemporary as well as later references, may indicate that in this case O'Hanlon did in fact assume the persona of a dispossessed aristocrat.<br>
