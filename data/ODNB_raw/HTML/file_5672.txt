<span class="headword">Clifton,  Robert Cox</span>  (1810&#150;1861), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, the son of Robert Cox Clifton, a clergyman who was many years British chaplain at Bruges, was born at Gloucester on 4 January 1810. The earlier part of his education was received under his father's care at Worcester, and in 1827 he went to Oxford, where he matriculated at Worcester College. He proceeded BA in 1831 and MA in 1834, and was ordained in 1833 by the bishop of Oxford. In 1833 he was elected fellow of his college. Before taking his first curacy, which was in Berkshire, he spent some time in Oxford as a tutor.<br>
<br>In 1837 Clifton was appointed to the office of clerk in orders at the Manchester collegiate church, and on 6 December 1843 was elected to a fellowship by the collegiate chapter. When the church was made a cathedral, he became a canon there. In 1843 he became rural dean and rector of Somerton in Oxfordshire, which benefice he held, with his Manchester preferment, until his death.<br>
<br>Clifton took a very active part in the administration of public charities and religious societies in Manchester, and was a trustee of Owens College. Clifton was an admirable man of business and an influential and useful member of the cathedral chapter. He was active in the division of the parish of Manchester in 1850 and published a pamphlet on it. He also published several occasional sermons and other pamphlets, including <span class="italic">A Letter to the Rev. Dr Hook on the Subject of National Education</span> (1846). He died at his rectory at Somerton on 30 July 1861, his wife, Charlotte Hornsby Clifton, surviving him.<br>
