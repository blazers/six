<span class="headword">Lushington,  Thomas</span>  (1590&#150;1661), <span class="occ">author and theologian</span>, was born at Sandwich, Kent, and baptized at Hawkinge, near Folkestone, on 2 September 1590, one of four children of Ingram Lushington (Lussyngtoun) and his wife, Agnes. He matriculated at Broadgates Hall, Oxford, on 15 March 1607, and graduated BA in 1616 from Lincoln College. In the interval he held some public employment. He proceeded MA at Lincoln College in May 1618, and afterwards returned to Broadgates Hall to study theology. Sir Thomas Browne, author of <span class="italic">Religio medici</span>, was his pupil there.<br>
<br>Audacious in the pulpit and unconventional out of it Lushington made his mark preaching at St Mary's, Oxford, on Easter Monday 1624, when he denounced the popular desire for war with Spain, and spoke contemptuously of the House of Commons&#151;&#145;the peasant&#146; who &#145;under pretence of his privilege in parliament &hellip; would dispose of kings and commonwealths&#146;  (<span class="italic">Hist. U. Oxf.</span> 4: <span class="italic">17th-cent. Oxf.</span>, 583). His sermon, delivered with wit and gusto, gratified some of his hearers, who interrupted with cheers, but not the authorities. The vice-chancellor reprimanded him and insisted on a recantation of his views the following Sunday. The edition of the two sermons by Edward Hyde, earl of Clarendon, <span class="italic">The Resurrection of our Saviour Vindicated</span> (1741), claimed that they had been &#145;formerly published under the feign'd name of Robert Jones D.D.&#146;, but no firm evidence of seventeenth-century English editions has come to light.<br>
<br>In the altered circumstances of the later 1620s Lushington's views were no bar to preferment. He proceeded BD in July 1627 and DD in June 1632, and became the friend and chaplain of Richard Corbet, dean of Christ Church and then from 1628 bishop of Oxford. On 10 June 1631 he was presented by Bishop William Laud to the prebend of Beminster Secunda in Salisbury, in succession to Corbet, and in 1632 he accompanied Corbet on his translation to Norwich. In 1633 he became vicar of Barton Turf and of Neateshead, Norfolk, and in 1636 of Felixstowe and Walton, Suffolk. In 1639 he was presented by the king to the rectory of Burnham Westgate, Norfolk, and in 1640 he became rector of Burnham St Mary, Burnham St Margaret, and Burnham All Saints.<br>
<br>During the civil war Lushington lost all these livings and turned to writing. At some time he had begun to study Socinian works, which had been circulating in England for the first time from about the 1620s. In 1646 he published, as G. M., <span class="italic">Expiation of a Sinner</span>, a translation of a commentary on the epistle to the <span class="roman">Hebrews</span> by Johannes Crellius and Jonas Schlictingius, the Socinian exegetes, and a notable innovation in English divinity. <span class="italic">The Justification of a Sinner</span> (1650) was a similar translation, this time of the epistle to the <span class="roman">Galatians</span>, like its predecessor not verbatim, but rather a free paraphrase with considerable additions by the author. At every point Lushington followed his Socinian authorities. Christ is subordinate to God the Father, and far from being a substitute for the sins of humanity, Jesus is the bringer in of good news and forgiveness, the exemplar of God's love for mankind. This moral doctrine of the atonement appealed to Lushington and marked him out as an exceptional theologian. His writings were vigorously attacked by Edmund Porter in <span class="italic">God Incarnate</span> (1665), and Lushington's refusal to acknowledge the Pauline authorship of <span class="roman">Hebrews</span> greatly annoyed his critic, but <span class="roman">New Testament</span> scholarship has since vindicated the conclusion that the epistle is non-Pauline.<br>
<br>Two more of Lushington's works appeared in 1650. A treatise on the theology of Proclus survives in manuscript and his <span class="italic">Logica analytica</span>, edited by Nicholas Bacon, the first of what was intended to be a two-part work, was published. Noteworthy is the author's use of the phrase &#145;Right Reason&#146;, which was to be characteristic of both Oxford and Cambridge latitudinarians.<br>
<br>In 1660 the surviving bishops sought to warn the returning Charles II against accepting Lushington's services as a chaplain until his suspect opinions could be investigated. While he apparently regained his livings he declined further preferment. He died at Sittingbourne, Kent, on 22 December 1661, and was buried four days later in the south chancel of the church. No trace remains of the monument erected in his memory by his kinsman and heir, Thomas Lushington of Sittingbourne, with its eulogy of the character and learning of this high-church &#145;heretic&#146;.<br>
