<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Lowe,  Arthur</span>  (1915&#150;1982), <span class="occ">actor</span>, was born on 22 September 1915 at Hayfield, Derbyshire, the only child of Arthur Lowe (<i>fl</i>. 1900&#150;1950), railwayman, and his wife, Mary Ford (<i>fl</i>. 1900&#150;1960). Between the wars the family lived in Manchester, where Mr Lowe worked as a bookings manager for excursion trains. After grammar school, where he was a promising boxer, young Arthur started work at sixteen pushing a barrow for a cotton mill. He had a spell with Fairey Aviation, then joined another local firm, Brown Brothers, selling motor parts. His skill at mimicking the foremen showed where his real talent lay, and the Second World War gave him the chance to exploit it. Fellow recruits had been amused at his characterization of a Nazi officer with the catchphrase &#145;Velcome to my vahr&#146; and when Lowe was posted to a REME (Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers) depot in Egypt he formed a theatre group. After producing <span class="italic">The Monkey's Paw</span> he joined a field entertainment unit and helped to run fortnightly repertory in Alexandria.<br>
<br>Home again in 1945, Lowe decided on a stage career. His father, whose customers included touring theatre companies, persuaded the impresario Frank H. Fortescue to give him an audition, and he was soon in demand for character parts at the Hulme Hippodrome, Manchester. There he met a married actress, Joan Cooper (1923&#150;1987?), later to be his wife and stage partner. She was instantly struck by his ability to claim an audience's attention in the most minor role. They spent 1947 with a company in Hereford, where Lowe appeared in forty-two plays; a lasting tendency not to know his lines properly was already evident. Joan Cooper divorced and on 10 January 1948, while playing in repertory around London's southern fringe, they married. A year later Lowe made the most of the part of a reporter in the film <span class="italic">Kind Hearts and Coronets</span>. The notebook in which he recorded a lifetime's work lists nearly fifty plays in Bromley during 1950 and 1951. He escaped briefly for a first West End appearance in the Guy Bolton comedy <span class="italic">Larger than Life</span>, but in 1952 began an eighteen-month run as Senator Brockbank in the musical <span class="italic">Call me Madam</span>. His talent for singing and dancing brought him parts in <span class="italic">Pal Joey</span> and <span class="italic">The Pajama Game</span> (1954 and 1955), but in a later career r&eacute;sum&eacute; he maintained he first &#145;really came to notice&#146; in <span class="italic">A Dead Secret</span> by Rodney Ackland at the Piccadilly Theatre in 1957. Philip Hope-Wallace in the <span class="italic">Manchester Guardian</span> noted &#145;the mean, respectable cousin (beautifully played by Arthur Lowe)&#146;  (Lowe, 58). By this time a son, Stephen, had been born, and, together with Joan's son David, the family lived in a succession of Knightsbridge flats. Acting then as his own agent, Lowe was never slow to remind producers of his availability, and worked regularly in films, broadcasting, and commercials. &#145;I took everything that was going,&#146; he said. &#145;How can you say you're an actor if you're not acting?&#146;  (Morley).<br>
<br>During the early 1960s Lowe reached a wider audience as the self-important Leonard Swindley in the television series <span class="italic">Coronation Street</span>, but was contracted for only half the year and made notable appearances in Lindsay Anderson's film <span class="italic">This Sporting Life</span> (1963) and in the John Osborne play <span class="italic">Inadmissible Evidence</span> at the Royal Court. Reviewing Henry Livings's play <span class="italic">Stop it Whoever You Are</span>, one critic wrote that Arthur Lowe seemed less like an actor than a Manchester alderman who had strayed by accident onto the stage of the Arts Theatre  (Lowe, 64). It was one of many tributes to the naturalness of his performances. His portrayal of Mr Swindley, the draper fussily upholding the standards of forty years before, became so popular that in 1965 he left <span class="italic">Coronation Street</span> to play the same part in a new series, <span class="italic">Pardon the Expression</span>. The following year he earned high praise as the cuckold Sir Davy Dunce in <span class="italic">The Soldier's Fortune</span> by Thomas Otway at the Royal Court. &#145;Mr Lowe can speak the most insignificant line with such a point that it gets a laugh &hellip; His pathos is all the deeper for being expressed in comic terms&#146;, said the <span class="italic">Financial Times</span>  (ibid., 91). In 1968 he played an ineffectual housemaster in Lindsay Anderson's film <span class="italic">If &hellip;</span> but it was another part during the same year which transformed him from a well-regarded actor into an enduring national favourite.<br>
<br>When Jimmy Perry suggested Arthur Lowe for the role of Captain Mainwaring in a television comedy series he had devised about the Home Guard, the BBC were doubtful. The response&#151;&#145;We don't know him, do we?&#146;&#151;indicated a sniffy view of Lowe's starring roles for ITV  (Lowe, 102). Perry persisted and he and his co-writer and producer David Croft invited Lowe to lunch. The meeting got off to a bad start, with Lowe expressing reservations about the sitcom genre, and unguardedly citing <span class="italic">Hugh and I</span>, which Croft had produced, as particularly dreadful. Croft let it pass and the three went on to establish a classic of British sitcom. There were eighty-three episodes of <span class="italic">Dad's Army</span> between 1968 and 1977, and the repeats later became part of the staple of television, attracting large audiences long after most of the participants were dead. As Mainwaring, the bank manager-cum-Home Guard officer, Lowe defended his dignity against a world unwilling to acknowledge it, and led a memorable supporting cast through action and cross-talk of high inventiveness. His genius was to put his physical limitations&#151;short sight and stature, baldness, and <i>embonpoint</i>&#151;at the service of his art&#151;timing and mastery of vocal and facial expression. The alchemy turned standard scriptwriter's fare into gold, so that when he declared (of a Lewis gun position), &#145;This'll cover the High Street from Timothy Whites to the Novelty Rock Emporium&#146;, he made millions laugh at the incongruity. Mainwaring's determination to excel was doomed to failure&#151;fate and the rest of the platoon saw to that. He was guaranteed to come off worse in his exchanges with the effortlessly superior Wilson (<script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/31350/', "John Le Mesurier")</script>)&#151;his junior in the bank <i>and</i> the Home Guard, but several rungs higher on the social ladder.<br>
<br>Lowe's triumph was to make Mainwaring likeable despite the testiness and vainglory. That he was able to do so without always being confident of his lines only adds to the achievement. Many stories were told of his delaying tactics as he put off the moment for proper study of the script. Once when David Croft suggested he take a copy home he replied: &#145;I don't want a thing like that in my house&#146;  (Lowe, 106). Colleagues suspected the hesitations that became Mainwaring's stock-in-trade (&#145;I say, Jo &hellip; Jo &hellip; Jo &hellip; Jones &hellip;&#146;) gave Lowe the chance to think of the next line. In one episode Mainwaring's social pretensions were threatened by a visit from his brother, a bibulous traveller in novelties. The two characters were poles apart, but Lowe played both with a virtuosity which made Perry rate him among the best comic actors of the century. Away from work he was a private man who shrank from the demands of celebrity, yet everything he did had the air of a performance. Choosing from a menu took on the solemnity of a board meeting, with earnest enquiries into whether the ham was off the bone, or the kippers still had their heads. There was something of Mainwaring in him, which he played up for effect, muttering &#145;That'll have to change&#146; to one of the production staff when a junior member of the cast hailed him as &#145;Arthur&#146; on the location bus. It was very much in the mould of his withering &#145;Stupid boy!&#146;, directed at Private Pike, which soon went into the language.<br>
<br>In latter years the Lowes moved to Little Venice in London, and bought a boat, <i>Amazon</i>, which they moored at Teddington and occasionally took to France or the Isle of Wight. He remained hectically busy, with much-praised performances in films&#151;playing a boozy and rebellious butler in <span class="italic">The Ruling Class</span> (1972), and three different parts in <span class="italic">O Lucky Man!</span> (1973), which won him a British Film Academy award for best supporting actor. On stage he appeared as Ben Jonson in <span class="italic">Bingo</span> with Sir John Gielgud, and took the <span class="italic">Dad's Army Stage Show</span> into the West End and on tour. There were further television series, radio adaptations of <span class="italic">Dad's Army</span>, and many voice-overs for commercials. But behind the success, Lowe's last years were difficult. He began to suffer from narcolepsy and would fall asleep without warning, even on stage. Life was further complicated by his wife's alcoholism. Only the discipline of the theatre kept her sober, and when offered a play he would stipulate that she must appear with him. The scheme worked on tour, but West End managements doubted her competence and Lowe turned down a number of opportunities because there was no part for her. He found solace in entertaining old friends on the boat, and in food, of which he consumed large quantities. He was touring in R. C. Sheriff's play <span class="italic">Home at Seven</span> when he died on 15 April 1982 in the General Hospital, Birmingham, having had a stroke in his dressing-room at the Alexandra Theatre, Birmingham. He was sixty-six, and was survived by his wife.<br>
