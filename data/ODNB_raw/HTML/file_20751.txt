<div class="para">
<span class="headword">O'Mahony,  John</span>  (1815&#150;1877), <span class="occ">Irish nationalist</span>, born at Clonkilla, co. Cork, on 12 January 1815, was the son of Daniel O'Mahony and his wife. The family was one of minor Roman Catholic gentry, reputedly in long-standing conflict with the neighbouring magnates of Mitchelstown Castle, the earls of Kingston.<br>
<br>O'Mahony was sent early in life to Dr Hamblin's school in Midleton, co. Cork, and entered Trinity College, Dublin, in 1833, but never took a degree. He was a good Greek and Latin scholar, and always more or less devoted to linguistic and philological pursuits, especially in connection with the Irish language. In 1857 he published <span class="italic">The history of Ireland from the earliest times to the English invasion, by Geoffrey Keating, D.D., translated from the original Gaelic, and copiously annotated</span>. It was at that time the best translation to have been published but was taken from a very imperfect text, and had evidently been executed (as O'Mahony himself confessed) in great haste. O'Mahony contributed to various Irish-American newspapers. His articles were mostly political, and generally somewhat ponderous in style.<br>
<br>In the 1840s O'Mahony took up residence on a substantial family holding near Carrick-on-Suir, co. Tipperary. This was in the region where William Smith O'Brien and his associates attempted to start an insurrection in July 1848, and O'Mahony was one of the few local men of substance who rallied to them. For several weeks after the d&eacute;b&acirc;cle at Ballingarry ended Smith O'Brien's venture, O'Mahony and some scores of followers remained under arms on the Tipperary&#150;Kilkenny border near Ahenny. With the authorities offering a reward for his capture, O'Mahony eventually escaped on a schooner from Dungarvan to Newport in Wales and from there to France. For five years from late 1848 he lived in Paris, sharing impoverished lodgings with James Stephens. O'Mahony arrived in New York in January 1854 and quickly became involved in Irish-American revolutionary endeavours.<br>
<br>The Emmet Monument Association was founded in 1855 by Michael Doheny, O'Mahony, and others, but it failed to effect anything. In late 1857, however, an envoy was sent, from a committee in New York composed of O'Mahony and his friends, to James Stephens in Dublin, with proposals for the foundation of a new secret organization in Ireland, with the object of overthrowing English rule and establishing an Irish republic. Stephens consented, under certain conditions, notably the sending over of definite sums of money at stated times. He founded the Irish Republican Brotherhood in Dublin in March 1858, and early in 1859 on a visit to New York he saw to the formation by his American allies of the Fenian Brotherhood. &#145;Fenian&#146; is derived from the <i>fianna</i>, a legendary band of ancient Irish warriors, and the derivation was O'Mahony's. He is thus the author of the term which came in time to designate revolutionary Irish nationalism on both sides of the Atlantic. From the beginning O'Mahony was &#145;head centre&#146; of the Fenian Brotherhood. In late 1860 he travelled to Ireland and, after visiting his relations, proceeded to Dublin, where in early 1861 he and Stephens met to review their plans.<br>
<br>The American Civil War boosted the movement on both sides of the Atlantic, but expansion rendered the Fenian Brotherhood less amenable to O'Mahony's control. He could not resist the momentum that led to the summoning of a congress of the brotherhood at Chicago in November 1863. Here a representative form of government was adopted and, although O'Mahony was elected head centre, his authority was circumscribed. It was further diminished by the intrigues of James Stephens, who made a fund-raising visit in 1864. O'Mahony survived a second congress, at Cincinnati in January 1865, but a third, at Philadelphia in October 1865, saw him overthrown by a majority which put all power in the hands of a &#145;senate&#146;, from which he was excluded.<br>
<br>In January 1866 O'Mahony was once again head centre but now of a splinter group. The senate wing called for an attack on British power in Canada, a policy denounced by the O'Mahony wing as a diversion. But in April 1866, in an attempt to upstage their opponents, O'Mahony's supporters set out to occupy the small island of Campobello, belonging to New Brunswick but situated close to the coast of Maine. The attempt was prevented by the American navy, and it cost those involved dearly in terms of resources, morale, and prestige. After arriving in America in May 1866, James Stephens took control of the O'Mahony wing, promising an invasion of Ireland by the year's end. When this failed to materialize, morale and prestige were further undermined. The Fenian Brotherhood dragged on in a precarious existence. For several years O'Mahony remained head centre, but neither he nor it thenceforward had any appreciable influence on Irish or Irish-American politics.<br>
<br>O'Mahony was physically a very powerful and handsome man. Although he took part in no action, O'Mahony was briefly in charge of the 99th regiment of the New York national guard during the civil war and so acquired the title of colonel. Before leaving Ireland in 1848, O'Mahony had made over his property to his sister Mrs Jane Mandeville. For most of his subsequent career he depended precariously on politics and journalism for a living. He never married. A friend found him sick and in great poverty a few days before he died in New York on 7 February 1877. His remains, which were brought back to Ireland, were followed to Glasnevin cemetery on 4 March 1877 by a great concourse of people.<br>
