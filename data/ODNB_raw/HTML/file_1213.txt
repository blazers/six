<span class="headword">Ball,  Hannah</span>  (1734&#150;1792), <span class="occ">follower of Wesleyan Methodism and diarist</span>, was born on 13 March 1734, probably in Buckinghamshire. Nothing is known of her family other than that she was one of a family of twelve children and that her mother died in 1779, aged seventy-nine. At the age of nine she went to live with an uncle in High Wycombe, before spending five years in Hertfordshire. In 1750 she resided with her brother, a widower, looking after his four children. Initially against the Methodists, she was influenced by reading the sermons of Thomas Walsh (<i>c</i>.1730&#150;1759), a Wesleyan Methodist itinerant, and became attracted to their teaching. Over the years John Wesley and other Methodist preachers had visited High Wycombe, but it was probably on his visit in January 1765 that Hannah Ball first met him and was converted. She began to keep a diary in 1766, later published, along with some of her letters, as her memoirs in 1796. She was a regular correspondent of John Wesley, who on several occasions entrusted her with the delicate task of ensuring that some of his preachers were spiritually and pastorally adequate. In 1779 he seems to have encouraged and advised her about the building programme for a chapel at High Wycombe, which he opened on 11 November 1779. However, these letters and her diary contain little personal information, being chiefly concerned with her spiritual development. Her letter-book of 19 May to 6 December 1776, comprising about thirty letters, three written to John Wesley and the rest to women friends, concentrates on giving advice on spiritual growth and recounting her own religious experiences.<br>
<br>Hannah Ball was an assiduous visitor of the sick, both women and men, catering in particular for their spiritual, rather than physical, welfare. Her ministrations also extended to family and friends. John Wesley encouraged her to visit and counsel &#145;back-sliders&#146; in the hope of bringing them back to faith. She also continued the Methodist tradition of prison visiting.<br>
<br>In August 1776 Hannah Ball travelled to London, spending nine days there during the Methodist conference. Here she attended fourteen preaching services, at six of which Wesley preached, and also holy communion services. She herself was involved in fourteen meetings, testifying and counselling. Some were band meetings, some class meetings, and others personal interviews. Hannah Ball was not preaching or exhorting in the formal sense, which was officially forbidden to women in Wesleyan Methodism, but nevertheless she was exercising a considerable and effective ministry and John Wesley encouraged her in her travels.<br>
<br>Hannah Ball is chiefly remembered as a precursor of the Sunday school movement. Robert Raikes (1725&#150;1811) of Gloucester is credited with founding the first Sunday school in 1780; however, Hannah Ball had started a school in High Wycombe in 1769, meeting the children regularly each Sunday and Monday. She reported in a letter, dated 16 December 1770, to John Wesley that they were &#145;a wild little company, but seem willing to be instructed&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters of the Rev. John Wesley</span>, 5.218). Samuel Wells, a Wesleyan Methodist preacher, supported her work. Her sister Ann continued the school after Hannah died, unmarried, at High Wycombe on 16 August 1792.<br>
