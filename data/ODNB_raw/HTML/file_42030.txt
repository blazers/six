<span class="headword">Power,  Edward Joseph <span class="st"> [Ted]</span></span>  (1899&#150;1993), <span class="occ">radio engineer and art collector</span>, was born on 11 September 1899 at Maryborough, Queen's county, Ireland, one of the four children of Patrick Power, an army sergeant in the Leinster regiment, and his wife, Jane, formerly Heart. The family moved to England in 1907, when the regiment was transferred, but his parents later separated, and in 1910 his mother took the children to Manchester. Power was educated probably at Xaverian College, Manchester, leaving in 1916 to take a short course at Wilmslow Radio School before joining the navy as a wireless operator. After the war he joined the merchant navy, leaving in 1922 to set himself up as a manufacturer of crystal sets and transformers. On 22 November 1924 he married Irene (Rene) Cordelia Bevan (1899/1900&#150;1978), wig maker and hairdresser. They had four children. He worked as chief engineer for McMichael Radio from 1926, before setting up a business in Slough repairing wirelesses and making radio receivers.<br>
<br>In 1928 Power joined his friend Frank Murphy, a former Post Office engineer, in setting up Murphy Radio Ltd in Welwyn Garden City, as partner and chief engineer. The first Murphy sets were produced in 1930, and Murphy and Power then approached the furniture maker Gordon Russell in their search for a good modern designer for their radio cabinets. The cabinets designed by R. D. Russell, Gordon Russell's brother, for Murphy radios, became classics of industrial design. When Frank Murphy resigned in 1937 Power became chairman.<br>
<br>During the Second World War Murphy Radio played an important part in the development of radar, manufacturing high-power valves and experimenting with valve technology. After the war the company resumed its expansion into television production, which had begun in 1937; in 1949, when it was floated on the stock market, Power became a wealthy man. He remained chairman until 1962, when he allowed the Rank Organization to buy control of the company.<br>
<br>Power began to collect modern art in 1951, and by the mid-1950s had acquired a large collection of paintings, mainly by as yet unknown contemporary French artists. He particularly admired Jean Dubuffet, eighty of whose works he bought between 1956 and 1960. He sought out the newest art he could find on frequent trips to Paris, mainly in the company of Peter Cochrane, a director of Tooth's Gallery. He amassed large collections of works by individual artists in order to try to understand their ideas, and he bought experimentally to see whether he liked a work, and if he did not he sold it. As Lawrence Alloway, deputy director of the Institute of Contemporary Arts, wrote in 1956: &#145;this collector works &hellip; in the spirit in which his artists paint&#151;impulsively, experimentally, to see what will happen&#146;  (Arts Council exhibition catalogue, <span class="italic">New Trends in Painting: some Pictures from a Private Collection</span>, 1956, 5).<br>
<br>In the late 1950s Power turned his attention to American art, buying works by de Kooning and Rothko, and he was one of the first British collectors to buy paintings by Jackson Pollock, Ellsworth Kelly, and Barnett Newman. He also became a close friend of the Danish artist Asger Jorn, twenty-nine of whose paintings he bought between 1956 and 1960. In the 1960s he bought works by R. B. Kitaj, Howard Hodgkin, Claes Oldenburg, and Roy Lichtenstein, and he owned a number of early paintings by Andy Warhol, including <span class="italic">Soup Can</span>, which he bought in 1964. Although he continued to buy&#151;and sell&#151;until the end of his life, after 1968 he no longer tried to collect the best of contemporary work, but he kept in touch with the latest trends. Power believed in the vital importance of contemporary art and donated many paintings to the Tate Gallery, where he was a trustee from 1968 to 1975. Although he was one of the most important British collectors of modern art in the 1950s and 1960s he shunned publicity and few knew the scale of his collection.<br>
<br>Power died on 16 September 1993 at Oakwood House Hospital, Old Watton Road, Colney, Norfolk. Two sons and a married daughter survived him. His estate was valued at over &pound;26 million.<br>
