<span class="headword">Hobday,  William Armfield</span>  (1771&#150;1831), <span class="occ">portrait and miniature painter</span>, was born in St Mary's Square, Birmingham, and baptized there in St Martin's Church, the second son of Samuel Hobday (1745/6&#150;1816), a wealthy manufacturer of spoons, and Elisabeth Armfield. A talented draughtsman, Hobday was sent to London in 1786, and was apprenticed for six years to the engraver W. J. Barney. In 1790 he was admitted to the Royal Academy Schools, where he studied alongside Martin Archer Shee, and made rapid progress. Without completing his academic studies, however, he established himself at 9 Charles Street, London, as a painter of portraits in miniature and watercolour. From 1794 he became a regular exhibitor at the Royal Academy, and soon secured a fashionable clientele including Lord Howard de Walden and Lady Wilson of Charlton. His friends included the painters George Morland, Charles Landseer, James Northcote, and George Chinnery. About 1800 Hobday married Elizabeth Dorothy Ivory and moved to 9 Holles Street, where, supported mainly by his father, he lived extravagantly.<br>
<br>In 1804 Hobday moved to Bristol, where he painted chiefly portraits, including miniatures, of officers embarking for the theatre of war in the Peninsula. His work, in the manner of Sir Joshua Reynolds, included large oil portraits and subject pictures. However, he never achieved Reynolds's skill as a draughtsman, or his eye for colour. Despite the good income he generated by his work, Hobday's lavish lifestyle created increasing financial difficulties. In 1817 he returned to London, where he took Winchester House, Old Broad Street, hoping (but failing) to renew former artistic and social connections, although he painted a small family group portrait, <span class="italic">The family of W. N. Rothschild, esq., consul general of his Austrian majesty at the British court</span> (exh. RA, 1821; priv. coll.) for 1000 guineas. His work became increasingly mannered, his oils lacking the delicacy and compositional grace he attained in his small watercolours. In 1821 or 1822 Hobday moved to 54 Pall Mall, to which large galleries were attached. After a disastrous speculation in a panoramic exhibition &#145;Poecilorama&#146; at the Egyptian Hall, he opened these galleries, which he called Hobday's Gallery of Modern Art, in order to sell pictures on commission. The venture failed, although supported by leading English and French artists including Delacroix and Horace Vernet, and in 1829 Hobday went bankrupt. Following his wife's death that year, on 31 October 1830 he married Maria Ustonson (<i>d</i>. 1859), a fishing tackle maker, of 205 Fleet Street. Hobday died of inflammation of the lungs on 17 February 1831 and was buried on 23 February at St Bride's, Fleet Street, London. He was survived by his sons Alfred Hobday (1824&#150;1884), lithographer, and George Smith Armfield Hobday (1811&#150;1893), animal painter, and a daughter, Harriet Eliza.<br>
<br>At the height of his career Hobday was generally well patronized: at one time he averaged six sitters per day, charging 10 guineas per miniature and 20 guineas for a three-quarter length portrait. From 1794 to 1830 he exhibited seventy works at the Royal Academy; the most acclaimed was his portrait of Charles Evans entitled <span class="italic">Portrait of Carolus (lately Deceased, Distinguished as the Hermit of Tong Castle, Shropshire)</span> (1823; exh. RA, 1823, British Institution, 1824, Hobday's Gallery of Modern Art, London, 1829). His full-length portrait <span class="italic">Miss Biggs in the Character of Cora (a Print, from the Tragedy, &#145;Pizarro&#146;)</span> (exh. RA, 1801; V&amp;A) was engraved by W. Bond in 1804, and <span class="italic">The Late R[ichard] Reynolds, Esq., the Bristol Philanthropist</span> (exh. RA, 1817; Bristol Art Gallery and Museum) was engraved by William Sharp. Hobday died virtually unknown and has since remained in obscurity, although his <span class="italic">Lady in a White Dress with a White Sash, Pink Cloak Lined with Fur</span> (sold at Christies in 1911 for 1350 guineas) briefly raised his profile.<br>
