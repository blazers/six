<span class="headword">Phillips,  Mary Elizabeth</span>  (1880&#150;1969), <span class="occ">suffragette and feminist</span>, was born on 15 July 1880 in St Mary Bourne, Hampshire, the daughter of William Fleming Phillips, a doctor who worked in Glasgow and encouraged her to join the suffrage campaign, and his wife, Louisa Elizabeth, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Sims (<i>d</i>. 1912). In 1904 she was engaged as a paid organizer for the Glasgow and West of Scotland Association for Women's Suffrage, founded in 1902. When the Pankhurst-led Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU) burst on the scene she was rapidly converted to &#145;militancy&#146; and resigned her position as organizing secretary of the Glasgow Association in March 1907. Later she said that her period of work for a non-militant society made her aware of the futility of such methods.<br>
<br>Mary Phillips was one of the first suffragettes from Scotland to be imprisoned in Holloway after a demonstration in the precincts of the House of Commons in February 1908. In April of that year she wrote to Annot Robinson, who had also been in Holloway, that she had found imprisonment a &#145;peaceful time, with no worry &hellip; One had nothing but affectionate farewells to remember of the friends outside, &amp; nothing but love to cheer one from one's fellow-prisoners&#146;  (Phillips to Robinson, 9 April 1908, Annot Robinson MSS). Mary took part in another London demonstration in July 1908 and was sentenced to three months in Holloway, making her the longest-serving suffragette prisoner. On her release the WSPU organized a &#145;fine Scottish welcome&#146; for her, with tartan and bagpipes. She was very moved and, when they sang &#145;Scots wha hae wi' Wallace bled&#146;, she thought of her national hero's defiance and asked, &#145;Shall not we, as Scottish women, make this an occasion for strengthening tenfold our determination to defy the Government?&#146;  (Leneman, 67). In June 1908 she became a paid organizer for the WSPU.<br>
<br>Between 1907 and 1909 Mary Phillips wrote the women's column for <span class="italic">Forward</span>, the lively socialist newspaper founded by Tom Johnston in 1906. But she found the pace of events too slow in Scotland, and was thoroughly disillusioned when Winston Churchill (against whom the suffragettes had vigorously campaigned) won the safe seat of Dundee in 1908. In any case, as a paid WSPU organizer, she had to go where she was sent, and she was based at various times in Plymouth, Newcastle, Reading, and Liverpool. Naturally she took part in the great processions organized by the WSPU, and she was a speaker in the massive Hyde Park demonstrations in 1908 and 1910.<br>
<br>In July 1909 Mary Phillips was arrested for interrupting a meeting in Exeter, was sentenced to seven days' imprisonment, went on hunger strike, and was released after three days. In November of that year she wrote to Christabel Pankhurst that she would like to take part in further militant activity and court prison for the cause, but Christabel Pankhurst forbade this, writing that it was up to her to organize the voluntary workers for such protests.<br>
<br>Between 1910 and 1912 Mary Phillips organized campaigns throughout the north of England. In July 1912 she was arrested in Chester, but her fine was paid without her consent. Her parents had moved to Cornwall, and after her mother's death in December 1912 she returned to her father in Falmouth. Although over the years she had received many letters of praise and affection from Christabel Pankhurst (and a salary rise in April 1912), in July 1913 she was abruptly dismissed from her position as organizer in Plymouth with four weeks' salary in lieu of notice. A letter from Christabel Pankhurst advised her that headquarters had always felt &#145;that you are not effective as a district organiser&#146;. Her papers do not reveal any reason for this <i>volte face</i>.<br>
<br>Mary Phillips immediately went to work (as Mary Paterson) for Sylvia Pankhurst's East London Federation of Suffragettes. From 1915 until February 1916 she worked as an organizer in south London for the United Suffragists. Subsequently she worked in succession for the New Constitutional Society for Women's Suffrage, the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom, and the Save the Children Fund. From 1928 until 1955 she was editor of a daily news service for the brewing trade and after she retired she worked with the publications department of the National Council of Social Service.<br>
<br>Mary Phillips was a lifelong member of the Six Point Group. Her politics remained very left-wing. She was involved with the Suffragette Fellowship and for a period of time about 1934 was the fellowship's custodian. About 1956, fearing that memories of the struggle for the vote were fading, Mary Phillips wrote a pamphlet entitled <span class="italic">The Militant Suffrage Campaign in Perspective</span>, in which she asked:<blockquote>can it really be true that, in a civilised country with a democratic form of government, so much time had to be wasted, such stupendous efforts made, so much suffering endured, to correct such an obvious anomaly as the exclusion from full citizenship of more than half the adult population? (Phillips, 15)</blockquote>She died at the Hovedene Hotel, 15/17 The Drive, Hove, Sussex, on 21 June 1969, and was cremated.<br>
