<span class="headword">Coote,  Eyre</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1759, <em>d.</em> 1823), <span class="occ">army officer and colonial administrator</span>, was baptized on 20 May 1759, the second son of Dr Charles Coote (<i>d</i>. 1796), of Shaen Castle, Queen's county, dean of Kilfenora, and his first wife, Grace (<i>d</i>. 1767), the daughter of Thomas Tilson and the widow of Thomas Cuffe. His elder brother, Charles Henry Coote (1754&#150;1823), was MP in the Irish parliament for Queen's county from 1776 to 1783 and from 1797 to 1801, and for Maryborough from 1783 to 1797, and sat for Queen's county at Westminster from 1801 to 1802, when he succeeded a distant cousin as second Baron Castle Coote; he was an ardent campaigner for the union of Great Britain and Ireland and a supporter of administration. His uncle was the army officer <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6243/', "Sir Eyre Coote (1726&#150;1783)")</script>. The family had substantial property in Queen's county.<br>
<br>Educated at Eton College between 1767 and 1771, Coote matriculated at Trinity College, Dublin, on 1 November 1774, but did not take a degree. He was commissioned ensign and lieutenant in the 37th regiment of foot in 1776, and immediately embarked for service in the American War of Independence, first participating in the battle of Brooklyn, in August 1776. He served through the subsequent middle colonies campaigns, and saw action at the battles of Brandywine (11 September 1777), Germantown (4 October 1777), and Monmouth Court House (28 June 1778) and expeditions to the Chesapeake and Rhode Island. He was promoted captain on 10 August 1778. Commanding a company of the 37th, he participated in the southern campaign (1780&#150;81) under Charles Cornwallis, second Earl Cornwallis. Having been captured at Yorktown, Virginia (October 1781), he returned to Britain and advanced rapidly, becoming major of the 47th foot (1783) and lieutenant-colonel of the 70th (1788). On 9 November 1786, at St Marylebone, Coote married Sarah (<i>d</i>. 1795), the daughter of John Rodbard; they had three daughters, all of whom died before their father. In 1790 he became MP for Ballinakill and in 1797 he moved to Maryborough, but his military career was always his priority.<br>
<br>Coote's advance through the army was helped by his family's wealth, including the fortune amassed by his uncle Sir Eyre Coote, of whom he was the eventual heir, but it was his natural leadership ability, professional military skill, and tactical acumen that resulted in commands of increasing responsibility and complexity. As war with revolutionary France unfolded, Britain took advantage of French inability to defend her West Indian sugar islands. Under General Sir Charles Grey, Coote, promoted colonel on 24 January 1794, commanded the light infantry battalion. After arriving off Barbados on 6 January 1794, Grey commenced operations against French islands, among them Barbados and Martinique. Coote particularly distinguished himself in the assault on St Lucia on 2 April 1794. Assigned to storm a redoubt and two artillery batteries adjacent to the island's main fortification, Morne Fortun&eacute;, Coote's battalion took the French garrison by surprise using only bayonets, killing thirty enemy defenders with no British losses.<br>
<br>As a consequence of his service in the West Indies, Coote advanced rapidly. While participating in the disastrous allied Netherlands campaign of 1794&#150;5, his brigade effectively covered the retreat from the Waal River, thus reducing potential allied losses in the face of a vigorous French counter-attack (10 January 1795). Coote was appointed aide-de-camp to King George III following a second West Indies expedition under Sir Ralph Abercromby in 1795; the following year he was promoted brigadier-general and took command of the camp at Bandon, Ireland. On 1 January 1798 he was raised to major-general, and soon afterwards he was given command of Dover camp, the primary staging point for the British army's continental operations.<br>
<br>In 1798 Coote was placed in command of a 1400 man operational force with the task of destroying the locks at Saas in the Netherlands, thereby closing a new canal between Bruges and Ostend, through which troops and supplies intended for an invasion of Britain could easily move. Despite Admiralty concerns that led to minimal co-operation from the navy, the expedition accomplished the mission, but bad weather delayed re-embarkation as the troops gathered on the beach. Overwhelming French forces assaulted their defensive position. With Coote severely wounded, the second in command surrendered.<br>
<br>Following his exchange, Coote returned to Dover, but soon he commanded a brigade in the Helder expedition (August 1799). Despite his brigade's excellent performance at the battle of Bergen (19 September 1799), the enterprise ultimately failed. Commanding a brigade in Sir Ralph Abercromby's Egyptian expedition, Coote took part in the successful landing at Abu Qir (8 March 1801). Between April and August he besieged Alexandria with 6000 troops while the bulk of the army marched on Cairo. Though severely depleted by disease, Coote's force captured Fort Marabout (21 August), which led to the city's eventual capitulation.<br>
<br>Coote appears to have been a popular commander and highly successful in a subordinate role; however, Abercromby regarded him as ill-suited for overall field command. None the less, Coote received a knighthood of the Bath for his Egyptian service (19 May 1802) as well as the newly created order of the Crescent from the Turkish sultan, Selim III. The peace of Amiens in 1802 halted his plans for a military expedition to South America. The same year he succeeded his brother as MP for Queen's county in the Westminster parliament. In the Commons he supported Henry Addington's administration, but advocated preparations for renewed conflict with France. He continued to support the ministry following Pitt the younger's return to power in 1804, but voted for the censure of Henry Dundas, Viscount Melville, in April 1805. On 25 October 1805 he married Katherine (<i>d</i>. 1821?), the daughter of John Bagwell, MP for co. Tipperary. They had one son.<br>
<br>That same year, promoted lieutenant-general, Coote commanded 7000 troops staged at Cork to reinforce either the West Indies or England, depending on French operations. Once the invasion threat subsided, in 1806 he was appointed lieutenant-governor and commander-in-chief in Jamaica, but he resigned in April 1808 because of deteriorating health. During this period he is said to have had a child with one of his slaves, Sally. The relationship was publicized in 1995 and again in 2001 when a descendant, United States army officer Colin Powell, became secretary of state. Assigned as second in command to John Pitt, second earl of Chatham, for the Walcheren Island campaign commencing in July 1809, with tactical command of the army's left wing, Coote commanded the siege of Flushing while Chatham advanced on Antwerp. He was relieved in October, his troubling erratic, eccentric behaviour (credited to a tropical malady from his West Indian service) prevented any further military command, even though he was promoted general in 1814. That year he applied for a peerage in recognition of his and his uncle's military services, but he received only a GCB, on 2 January 1815.<br>
<br>Coote served as MP for Barnstaple from 1812&#151;an opponent accused him of &#145;the most open bribery&#146;  (Fisher)&#151;until the 1818 parliamentary dissolution. He spoke where he could apply his military experience, praising the contribution of Irish Catholic soldiers to Grey's expedition to the West Indies during the debates on Catholic relief in 1813, and opposing any attempt to reduce the authority of the East India Company in India. His political career was ended by controversy. On 25 November 1815 he was charged with indecent conduct before the lord mayor of London, having allegedly paid boys from Christ's Hospital to be flogged. The lord mayor dismissed the case, but the army commander-in-chief, Frederick, duke of York, convened a military inquiry on 18 April 1816. His friends argued that Coote was suffering from mental illness, the consequence of the Jamaican sun, the premature deaths of his daughters, and heredity, but the inquiry concluded that his eccentric behaviour had been unworthy of an officer and a gentleman, and not caused by mental illness. Coote was dismissed from the army despite the protestations of many prominent officers and degraded from the Order of the Bath in spite of his previous excellent service. No longer a knight or an officer, Coote continued to decline physically and mentally. He did not stand for parliament again, and lived abroad and at West Park, Hampshire, which he inherited in 1812, until his death, on 10 December 1823. Despite the sad disgrace of the general, the Coote family continued the tradition of parliamentary service; his only son, also Sir Eyre Coote (1806&#150;1834), eventually served as MP for Clonmel. Coote's estate, according to the codicil to his will dated 17 September 1817, stood at more than &pound;16,000, the bulk of which went to his son and heir.<br>
