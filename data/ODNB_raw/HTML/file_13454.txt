<span class="headword">Hody,  Humphrey</span>  (1659&#150;1707), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and classical scholar</span>, was born on 1 January 1659 at Odcombe, Somerset, the son of Richard Hody (<i>b</i>. 1621/2), rector of Odcombe, and his wife, Jane. He matriculated at Wadham College, Oxford, on 10 March 1676, at the same time as two elder brothers, and was admitted scholar on 28 September 1677. He graduated BA in 1679, proceeded MA in 1682, BD in 1689, and DD in 1693. He was admitted fellow of Wadham College in July 1685, and was elected subdean of Wadham in 1682, humanity lecturer in 1685, catechist in 1686, dean in 1688, sub-warden in 1689, and bursar in 1691 and 1692. In 1690 Edward Stillingfleet, bishop of Worcester, made him his chaplain. John Tillotson, archbishop of Canterbury, appointed him his chaplain in May 1694, and he continued in this office under Tillotson's successor, Thomas Tenison. Tenison presented Hody to the living of Chartham, Kent, in 1695, which he quickly exchanged for the united parishes of St Michael Royal and St Martin Vintry, London (from which he resigned in 1702). On 15 March 1698 Hody was appointed regius professor of Greek at the University of Oxford. In November 1701 he became rector of Monks Risborough, Buckinghamshire, and on 1 August 1704 was made archdeacon of Oxford. He married Edith Daniel (<i>d</i>. 1736), but they had no children.<br>
<br>Hody was praised, even by critics such as Thomas Hearne, for his industry, memory, and zeal for learning. These characteristics are apparent in his writings. In his earliest publication, <span class="italic">Contra historiam Aristeae de LXX interpretibus dissertatio</span> (Oxford, 1684), Hody demonstrates that the letter of Aristeas containing an account of the production of the <span class="roman">Septuagint</span> was a late forgery. Subsequently, along with Henry Aldrich and Edward Bernard, he issued an edition of Aristeas's <span class="italic">History</span> (Oxford, 1692). He also wrote the &#145;Prolegomena&#146; to the Greek chronicle of John Malada (Oxford, 1691).<br>
<br>Following the revolution of 1688 Hody became engaged in the controversy surrounding the oath of allegiance to William and Mary imposed by parliament in 1689 upon all beneficed clergy. Six bishops and about 400 lower clergy refused to swear the oaths and were deprived of their livings in early 1690. These nonjurors refused to accept the validity of the new bishops. About April 1691, the time that the first appointments to the vacant sees were made by King William, Hody and Richard Bentley found in the Bodleian Library at Oxford a Greek manuscript of the late thirteenth century which could be used to bolster the case of the new bishops. Ascribed to the Constantinopolitan historian Nicepherus Callistus, this treatise contained a list of patriarchs of Constantinople who had been unjustly deposed and replaced by uncanonical appointees, and yet neither the people nor the ejected patriarchs refused communion with them unless they were heretics. To Hody the parallel seemed obvious, and he and Bentley proceeded to translate the treatise into English and publish it, with a dedication to Tillotson, under the title <span class="italic">The Unreasonableness of a Separation from the New Bishops</span> (London, 1691). Hody also published a Latin version at Oxford in 1691.<br>
<br>Hody's friend, the nonjuror Henry Dodwell, replied with <span class="italic">A Vindication of the Deprived Bishops</span> (London, 1692), in which he demonstrates that the manuscript was not by Nicepherus and had been inaccurately translated. Furthermore, he argues that the treatise was written to explain a special case, and that in nearly all the instances in the manuscript the deprived bishops had either been pressured to resign or some synodical proceedings had been taken against them. Attached to the <span class="italic">Vindication</span> is a page entitled &#145;The canons in the Baroccian manuscript, omitted by Mr. Hody&#146;. These canons, clearly belonging to the manuscript, show that only synodical deprivations are valid.<br>
<br>Hody answered with two works. In <span class="italic">A Letter &hellip; to a Friend Concerning a Collection of Canons Said to be Deceitfully Omitted</span> (Oxford, 1692) he lamely argues from circumstantial and textual evidence that the canons are unconnected with the treatise. In <span class="italic">The Case of Sees Vacant by an Unjust or Uncanonical Deprivation Stated</span> (London, 1693), he concedes in the preface that &#145;all Lay Deprivations are invalid&#146;, but insists that the civil power is irresistible, and challenges his opponents to produce historical examples to the contrary. Dodwell retorted with <span class="italic">A Defence of the Vindication</span> (London, 1697) in which he sets forth an argument for the complete independence of the church from the state. This remained unanswered until 1699.<br>
<br>In the meantime Hody published two more works. The first was <span class="italic">The Resurrection of the (same) Body Asserted</span> (London, 1694) in which he sets out to prove that the resurrection of the corporeal body is the doctrine of the gospel. In addition, &#145;and designed only for the more Curious&#146;, he attempts to demonstrate that this was also the belief of &#145;the heathens and the Jews&#146;  (H. Hody, <span class="italic">Resurrection Asserted</span>, 1694, preface). The second was <span class="italic">Animadversions on Two Pamphlets Lately Published by Mr. Collier</span> (London, 1696). Tenison had asked Hody to respond to Jeremy Collier, who had written two pamphlets in defence of himself and two other nonjuring ministers who had pronounced absolution on the Jacobite conspirator Sir William Parkyns on the scaffold prior to his execution for treason for his part in the assassination plot. Such an act, says Hody, was an offence to both the church and the state.<br>
<br>In 1699 Hody returned to his feud with Dodwell over authority in the church. This time the issue was the rights of the convocation of Canterbury. In his <span class="italic">Some Thoughts on a Convocation, and the Notion of its Divine Right</span> (London, 1699) Hody produces his answer both to Dodwell's <span class="italic">Defence</span> and Samuel Hill's <span class="italic">Municipium Ecclesiasticum</span> (London, 1697). Quoting copiously from &#145;that Great Man&#146;  (H. Hody, <span class="italic">Some Thoughts</span>, 1699, 30) Richard Hooker and &#145;the great [Hugo] Grotius&#146;  (ibid., 19) Hody argues that, according to the English constitution, English kings have the power to summon convocations and that such convocations cannot make any canon or constitution without the king's approval. Furthermore, there is nothing in scripture, natural law, or early church history, after the emperor was Christian, which suggests that the clergy have a divine right to independence that would override the constitution. Hody followed this up two years later with a more substantial study of the English constitution entitled <span class="italic">A History of English Councils and Convocations</span> (London, 1701).<br>
<br>In 1705 Hody published his last work, <span class="italic">De bibliorum textibus originalibus</span> (Oxford, 1705), in which he revisits his earlier studies on the <span class="roman">Septuagint</span>.<br>
<br>Hody died on 20 January 1707 while travelling to Bath, and was buried in Wadham College chapel. In his will, made in November 1706, he wished that all copies of his last book unsold at the time of his death should be &#145;disposed of beyond Sea and let none be sold in England besides those perhaps of the larger paper&#146;  (TNA: PRO, PROB 11/493, sig. 85). He gave first choice of his library to the university, and what it did not want was to go to the fellows' library at Wadham (under conditions for their security which suggest that Hody did not entirely trust the fellows). He left &pound;100 each to his parish of birth and to his old London and present Buckinghamshire livings for binding out poor children as apprentices on condition that they had attended catechism. But the bulk of his property&#151;in Somerset and Oxford&#151;was to go to the maintenance of his wife during her life (unless she remarried), and then to pass to Wadham College for the establishment of six exhibitions in Greek and four in Hebrew. Edith Hody died on 28 November 1736 and the first Hody exhibitioners were elected in June 1738. Among the papers Hody left behind at his death was a manuscript entitled &#145;An account of those learned Grecians, who retired into Italy&#146;, which was published posthumously by Samuel Jebb as <span class="italic">De Graecis illustribus</span> (London, 1742). Prefixed to this is a short biography of Hody in Latin. His portrait by Thomas Forster was presented to Wadham College by his widow.<br>
