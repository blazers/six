<span class="headword">Davies,  Charles Maurice</span>  (1828&#150;1910), <span class="occ">author</span>, was born in Wells, Somerset, of Welsh origin. In 1845 he entered Durham University as a scholar of University College and graduated BA in 1848 with a second class in classical and general literature, MA in 1852, and DD in 1864. He was elected a fellow of the university on 1 November 1849 and was ordained deacon in 1851 and priest in 1852. After serving various curacies he settled down to educational work in London. In 1856 he married Jane Anne Greenaway. Meanwhile, his religious views underwent a change. Once an active supporter of the Tractarian movement, he soon adopted broad church principles and published anonymously a series of sensational novels attacking high-church practices, among them <span class="italic">Philip Paternoster</span> (1858), <span class="italic">Shadow Land</span> (1860), and <span class="italic">Verts, or, The Three Creeds</span> (1876). He also published translations of Sophocles' <span class="italic">Antigone</span> and <span class="italic">Oedipus tyrannus</span>, and Plautus's <span class="italic">Captivi</span>.<br>
<br>After holding the headmastership of the West London collegiate school (1861&#150;8) Davies devoted himself mainly to journalism. In 1870 he represented the <span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span> in France on the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War and was arrested as a suspected spy while searching Metz for his colleague, George Augustus Sala. Among his other contributions to the <span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span> was a series of independent studies of religious parties in London, which attracted attention. His articles were collected into a volume entitled <span class="italic">Unorthodox London</span> (1873; 2nd edn, 1875). This was followed by <span class="italic">Heterodox London, or, Phases of Free Thought in the Metropolis</span> (1874), <span class="italic">Orthodox London, or, Phases of Religious Life in the Church of England</span> (1874&#150;5), and <span class="italic">Mystic London, or, Phases of Occult Life in the Metropolis</span> (1875), all of which were on the same lines. On leaving the service of the <span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span> he went to Natal in South Africa to work under Bishop J. W. Colenso. After 1882, however, he abandoned holy orders. On his resettling in London, he was employed after 1893 in superintending a series of translations, undertaken at the instance of Cecil Rhodes, of the original authorities used by Edward Gibbon in his <span class="italic">Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire</span>. Nearly thirty scholars worked under his supervision and over a hundred volumes were completed. Davies retired from active work in 1901, and died at his home, 50 Connaught Road, Harlesden, London, on 6 September 1910. His funeral service was held at All Souls Church, Harlesden, on 10 September.<br>
