<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Vansittart,  Nicholas</span>, first Baron Bexley  (1766&#150;1851), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born on 29 April 1766 in Old Burlington Street, London, the fifth and youngest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28103/', "Henry Vansittart (1732&#150;1770?)")</script>, governor of Bengal, and his wife, Emilia (<i>d</i>. 1819), daughter of Nicholas Morse, governor of Madras. In 1770, after the loss of his father at sea, Nicholas was placed under the guardianship of his uncles Sir Robert Palk and Colonel Arthur Vansittart of Shottesbrooke. He was educated at Mr Gilpin's school at Cheam in Surrey, and at Christ Church, Oxford, where he matriculated on 29 March 1784 and graduated BA in 1787 and MA in 1791. He received the honorary degree of DCL on 16 June 1814. He became a student of Lincoln's Inn on 21 April 1788, was called to the bar on 26 May 1791, and became a bencher of Lincoln's Inn on 12 November 1812.<h2>
<a name="Conservativepolitician"></a>Conservative politician</h2>In the 1790s Vansittart took three steps which were greatly to help him in his pursuit of a political career. First, as a newly qualified barrister he attended the Crown and Rolls debating society in Chancery Lane, although throughout his life his voice remained feeble and indistinct. Second, between 1793 and 1796 he wrote four pamphlets supportive of the younger Pitt's fiscal and foreign policies, which gave him something of a financial reputation. Third, he made a number of useful political contacts by serving, from 1797, in the fashionable City of London and Westminster light horse volunteers &#145;which positively bristled with MPs and future ministers of the Crown&#146;  (Gash, 26). He was returned as MP for Hastings on 25 May 1796, and subsequently represented Old Sarum (1808&#150;12), East Grinstead (1812), and the Treasury borough of Harwich from 1812 until his elevation to the peerage in 1823. Such closed boroughs in the unreformed parliament suited Vansittart as he did not have to rely upon his mediocre skills as a public speaker to get himself elected and once elected he did not need to pay much, if any, attention to constituency affairs.<br>
<br>Politically Vansittart attached himself to Henry Addington, his cousin and another of Mr Gilpin's alumni. He was rewarded in February 1801 with the task of leading a mission on behalf of the Addington administration to Copenhagen to persuade the Danes to leave Tsar Paul's Northern League and abandon the policy of armed neutrality. When it became clear that the Danes were not amenable to persuasion, however, Vansittart reported to Addington that nothing remained but to strike a speedy and severe blow, and this was duly administered by Nelson at the battle of Copenhagen on 2 April 1801.<br>
<br>In March Vansittart had been appointed joint secretary of the Treasury by Addington and he held this office until the ministry's resignation on 26 April 1804. He returned to office in January 1805 as secretary for Ireland and a privy councillor, despite Pitt's reservations regarding Catholic reaction to the appointment and doubts regarding Vansittart's debating ability. These obstacles were overcome thanks to the good offices of the duke of Cumberland, Addington's insistence that office be found for his closest supporters as a condition of his entering the ministry (as Lord Sidmouth and lord president of the council), and Bragge-Bathurst's declining the post. Sidmouth left the administration in July but Vansittart did not follow his patron's example until September. His undistinguished tenure of office had, however, been marred by his finding himself at odds with his lord lieutenant, Lord Hardwicke.<br>
<br>Vansittart returned to the secretaryship to the Treasury when the Sidmouth connection entered Grenville's &#145;ministry of all the talents&#146; in January 1806, only to resign with Sidmouth in March 1807 shortly before the administration was turned out. He played no part in Portland's ministry although his growing reputation as a financier and parliamentarian was confirmed by his carrying unopposed thirty-eight resolutions during debate on the resumption of cash payments (20 June 1809).<br>
<br>Vansittart married the Hon. Catherine Isabella (1778&#150;1810), second daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8459/', "William Eden, first Baron Auckland")</script>, on 22 July 1806. Such was his wife's ill health, however, that he temporarily withdrew from public life in the spring of 1809 in order to accompany her on rest cures at Malvern and Torquay. The deterioration in his wife's health explains his declining Perceval's offer of the exchequer on 13 October, though he may well also have been influenced in his decision by the fact that Sidmouth was offered no place and he did not wish to desert his friend, or did not feel that it was politic to be seen to be deserting his patron. He was at least able to be at his wife's side when she died at Torquay on 10 August 1810 aged only thirty-two.<br>
<br>On 24 April 1811, in response to the report of the bullion committee and Francis Horner's call for the resumption of cash payments within two years, Vansittart resumed his active political career by tabling his own anti-bullionist resolutions. He played a leading role in the debates which culminated in defeat of Horner's proposal on 9 May and thus allowed the Perceval administration to pursue its vigorous prosecution of the war effort.<h2>
<a name="Chancelloroftheexchequer"></a>Chancellor of the exchequer</h2>Sidmouth entered Perceval's government as lord president of council in April 1812 but failed to secure the exchequer for Vansittart who, on reflection, preferred to stay out of office rather than take the proffered post of a junior lordship of the Treasury. In the event, however, Vansittart returned to office on 20 May as the replacement of the assassinated prime minister in his role as chancellor of the exchequer.<br>
<br>Few chancellors can have been faced with a more daunting set of circumstances on entering office. Massive population growth (up from 10.5 million in 1801 to 12 million in 1811) both fuelled Malthusian fears of famine and helped account for the quadrupling of poor rates between 1775 and 1817. Moreover, the war waged with France since 1793 (with only the fourteen-month respite brought about by the peace of Amiens in 1802) was equally unprecedented and deleterious in its impact, with the national debt increasing from &pound;238 million in 1793 to &pound;902 million in 1816. As if war with France was not bad enough, the attempt to break the continental system by restricting the scope for neutrals to trade with Napoleonic Europe not only induced recession at home but pushed the United States into declaring war on Great Britain in the very month of Vansittart's first budget. Last but not least, the new chancellor was aware that even if these wars could be brought to a victorious conclusion their close would pose questions of comparable magnitude and complexity in the shape of managing the transition from a wartime to a peacetime economy and accommodating the demand for the immediate relief of wartime taxation. Such a political and economic context would have tested the most adroit chancellor and certainly proved more than a match for Vansittart, notwithstanding his links with Rothschilds and Barings, and the financial advice he received from the Revd Henry Beeke.<br>
<br>Vansittart's first budget, of June 1812, was in reality Perceval's last (with the qualification that Vansittart preferred to add to existing taxes on male servants, carriages, horses, and dogs, than tax private brewing establishments) and he only set his own mark on the national finances with his &#145;new plan of finance&#146; of March 1813, which in practice involved raising loans for the sinking fund and increasing the customs by 25 per cent.<br>
<br>Vansittart acted as Castlereagh's deputy in the Commons while the foreign secretary and leader of the house attended the negotiations for the first treaty of Paris from April to May 1814. He was, however, both politically and financially ill-equipped to appease the clamour both inside and outside parliament for immediate peacetime economy and relief from taxation. Napoleon's escape from Elba obliged him to defer premature speculation regarding alternatives to the income tax and impose unprecedentedly high taxation in his budget of 14 June 1815.<br>
<br>The victory at Waterloo (four days later) increased the pressures on the exchequer to relax its demands on the public but Vansittart's room for manoeuvre was severely constrained by the size of the national debt (the interest payments on which amounted to roughly 80 per cent of government expenditure) while the transition to peacetime accentuated, where it did not create, economic difficulties which included recession, rising unemployment, and increasing local taxation.<br>
<br>Matters were made worse by the government's loss of about a quarter of its revenue in 1816, following its failure to retain the income tax and decision not to renew the malt tax, as this delayed both the resumption of cash payments and pursuit of the policy of freeing trade. Indeed, it was not until 1819 that a phased return to the gold standard was approved, and in the meantime Vansittart had been forced to have recourse to both the money market and increased indirect taxation.<br>
<br>If Vansittart was not the author of the government's financial difficulties he can certainly be accused of playing its hand badly in attempting to retain the income tax in 1816. First, by announcing on 9 February that discontinuation of the tax was dependent on ratification of the treaty of Ghent by the American senate (thereby formally ending the Anglo-American War of 1812&#150;14), the government appeared to vindicate the popular view that it was only a wartime levy. Second, the substantial concessions proposed by the exchequer, which included lowering the standard rate from 2<i>s</i>. to 1<i>s</i>. in the pound so as to relinquish &pound;7,500,000 of revenue per annum, were announced too late to have any chance of countering the arguments of those favouring repeal. Third, the government failed to make the most of those arguments in favour of the tax which MPs might have found most persuasive, such as the claim that it offered the prospect of deriving a steady and growing revenue from trade at a time when it appeared to be better able to make a contribution to the national coffers than the landed interest. The net result was that the income tax was lost by thirty-seven votes and the restoration of sound national finances was delayed by at least three years.<br>
<br>1819 was marked not only by the reimposition of the malt tax but also by the first of a series of raids on the sinking fund which hastened the depreciation in Vansittart's own stock and which led to Lady Bathurst describing him as &#145;a millstone about their necks&#146; who was not got rid of by his colleagues because &#145;they had scruples about telling him he was inefficient&#146;  (<span class="italic">Greville Memoirs</span>, 72). Arbuthnot wrote to Castlereagh that Vansittart was &#145;abused, ridiculed &amp; deserted by everybody&#146;, it being<blockquote>declared of him by all parties &amp; all description of men, that altho' in private life a good man, there is no belief to be attached to a word he says, as he one day declares in the House that no funding will be required, &amp; the next day it is generally known that there must be a great funding.</blockquote>In the City &#145;he has fallen lower than could be imagined&#146; with the &#145;Bank most loud against him&#146;  (<span class="italic">Correspondence of Charles Arbuthnot</span>, 16&#150;17). The low esteem in which Vansittart was generally now held in the house was demonstrated on 14 June 1821 when a motion for the repeal of the tax on horses employed in agriculture was carried against him. Confidence in his abilities slumped still further when his 1822 scheme to relieve some of the immediate burden of service pensions fell foul of the market place.<br>
<br>However, it would be misleading to attribute Vansittart's retention of office so long purely to the wish of his cabinet colleagues not to hurt his feelings. Other, less altruistic, calculations were involved. Thus when it was suggested in March 1821 that the ministry should be strengthened in the Commons (among other changes) by Peel taking the exchequer and Vansittart moving to the Board of Control, Castlereagh effectively scotched the idea by objecting that such a change might undermine his own position as leader of the House of Commons. His argument that &#145;Mr. Peel had never done any thing to entitle him to so high a place as the one proposed&#146;  (<span class="italic">Journal of Mrs Arbuthnot</span>, 1.82) ironically echoed George Rose's 1809 comment on the suggestion that Vansittart should receive the exchequer, that it was &#145;much more than he is worth, either from talents or experience&#146;  (Gray, 361).<br>
<br>The latter judgement seemed to be borne out by events as Vansittart appeared incapable of imposing his will as chancellor. He argued in vain for the retention of the income tax in 1816 and his stewardship was marked by no innovations of note: the 1819 decision to embark on a phased return to the gold standard, for example, being due to the deliberations of the select committee on the currency chaired by Peel rather than to the chancellor himself.<br>
<br>Certainly Vansittart's chancellorship was insufficiently distinguished to ensure his continued retention of that office when the question of strengthening the administration by readmitting Canning was resumed following Londonderry's suicide in 1822. George Canning had entertained a low opinion of Vansittart from the very outset of Liverpool's premiership, writing to Arbuthnot on 18 July 1812 that the disputed lead in the Commons between Castlereagh and himself might be put &#145;in abeyance &hellip; if continuing nominally with the Chancp. of the Ex. in a third hand&#151;even in Van's&#146;  (<span class="italic">Correspondence of Charles Arbuthnot</span>, 8). By 1822 Canning's lieutenant, Huskisson (who had always hated Vansittart's lack of &#145;system&#146; and hand-to-mouth financial expedients), was referring privately to the chancellor as &#145;the real <b>blot</b> and <b>sin</b> of the Government&#146; and his confidant, Croker, could only pay the backhanded compliment of asserting that Vansittart &#145;though not a very creditable Chancellor of the Exchequer, was a very useful one&#146; given his facility, over the previous year, of giving up his principles and eating his words  (<span class="italic">Croker Papers</span>, 1.229). However, an apparently inexhaustible capacity to consume humble pie, albeit with seemingly genuine humility, is no qualification for high office and Vansittart was persuaded in December 1822 to make way at the exchequer for Robinson in return for a peerage, a pension of &pound;3000 per annum, and Bragge-Bathurst's place in the cabinet as chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster.<h2>
<a name="Evangelicalpeer"></a>Evangelical peer</h2>George IV was prepared to confer the peerage on Vansittart not only out of a sense of the value of his past services but also out of the high estimation in which he held his private character. Vansittart was not only a lifelong engager in evangelical good works but exuded &#145;perpetual good nature&#146;, and by this stage his &#145;white hairs and unworldly gentleness&#146; and the &#145;primitive simplicity of his manner&#146; had resulted in his acquiring &#145;the sort of veneration with which men are accustomed to regard a saintly priest&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 12 Feb 1851, 5). He was created Baron Bexley of Bexley in Kent on 1 March 1823 and proceeded to play a mostly ornamental role in the Lords. Canning was engaged in an unsuccessful intrigue to exclude him from office shortly before the close of Liverpool's premiership but found it convenient to court him when he succeeded Liverpool as premier in 1827  (Aspinall, 198).<br>
<br>Although having initially indicated a willingness to continue in office, Bexley was among the &#145;protestant&#146; tories led by the duke of Wellington who resigned when the king invited Canning to succeed Lord Liverpool as prime minister. However, he was ultimately persuaded to withdraw his resignation and retain his position thanks to the king's personal entreaty, the example of the duke of Clarence in taking office (as lord high admiral), and Canning's reassurances that he would balance &#145;protestants&#146; and &#145;Catholics&#146; in his administration, although at the time Bexley represented the sole survivor of the &#145;protestant&#146; party from Liverpool's cabinet. These political somersaults were thus bound to give the impression in ultra circles that Bexley was more concerned to cling to office than to cleave to principle. Thus Lord Howard de Walden characterized him as &#145;a little hypocritical evangelical sneaking fox&#146;  (Aspinall, 129): an impression which was no doubt strengthened by the king's outburst that he would make Bexley his prime minister when Goderich presented him with difficulties in forming an administration in September 1827  (<span class="italic">Journal of Mrs Arbuthnot</span>, 2.141).<br>
<br>Not surprisingly Bexley lost office when the king turned to Wellington to form an administration in January 1828 and he thereafter devoted himself primarily to charitable and religious works including support for King's College, London, the Greenwich Hospital (of which he was a director), the port of Harwich (of which he was a high steward), the British and Foreign Bible Mission (of which he was the sometime president), and the Church Missionary and Prayer Book and Homily societies.<br>
<br>Bexley died on 8 February 1851 at his country residence, Foot's Cray, Kent. His peerage became extinct. His political career was long and distinguished in terms of his tenure of office. It would, however, be difficult to deny that he was promoted above his abilities and that more than most chancellors he was buffeted by the economy he sought to control, and deserves as little credit for the favourable legacy he bestowed on his successor (a surplus revenue of &pound;7,000,000 per annum) as he deserves blame for the unfavourable legacy which he himself inherited. He owed his initial success in politics largely to his Sidmouthite connections. His chancellorship proved him to be no better at arithmetic than he was at rhetoric. He lasted as long as he did as chancellor because Liverpool's affection for him outlived his confidence in his abilities and because Castlereagh regarded him, unlike Canning, as no threat to his leadership of the Commons. Ironically, Vansittart, as Bexley, enjoyed an extended lease of his post-exchequer political life at the hands of his long-standing critic Canning, precisely because he had by this time achieved iconic status as a tame &#145;protestant&#146; veteran of Liverpool's administration.<br>
<br>Historians generally take the view of most of Vansittart's contemporaries in seeing him as a man of unexceptional abilities who unsurprisingly experienced considerable difficulties in holding an office of first-rate importance in a period of national crisis. Such a view reinforces the indisputable fact that Vansittart's greatest political talent, and one not to be sneered at, was that for survival.<br>
