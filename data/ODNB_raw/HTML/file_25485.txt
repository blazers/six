<span class="headword">Shute,  Josias</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1588, <em>d.</em> 1643), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, was baptized on 11 August 1588 in Giggleswick, Yorkshire, the fifth of the nine children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25482/', "Christopher Shute (d. 1626)")</script>, vicar of Giggleswick, and his wife, Katherine Newhouse. He was educated at the free school in Giggleswick, and in 1602 matriculated from Trinity College, Cambridge, where he graduated BA in 1605 and proceeded MA in 1609. He was ordained priest on 3 June 1610, and on 30 November the next year was instituted to the rectory of St Mary Woolnoth, London, where he remained until his death. On 25 April 1614 he married Elizabeth Glanvild, one of his parishioners, whom he later described in his will as &#145;my truly loving and dear wife&#146;; they had no children.<br>
<br>Shute was one of the most widely respected preachers of his day: John Hacket styled him &#145;Generalis Praedicatorum&#146;, the preacher-general of the City of London. According to Ephraim Udall, in the 1645 edition of Shute's <span class="italic">Judgement and Mercy</span>, he preached &#145;thrice a weeke ordinarily, and often upon other occasions&#146;, and habitually rose from bed at 4 a.m., spending the day &#145;pinned in his chair to his study and to his bookes, being not willing to be troubled&#146;. None of his sermons was printed during his lifetime, although he bequeathed &#145;all my paper books and writings&#146; to his brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/74240/', "Timothy Shute")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25482/', "Shute, Christopher")</script>], perhaps with a view to posthumous publication. Such was his popularity, however, that notes from his sermons were frequently taken down by members of the audience, and some of these later found their way into print. Notes from his sermons on <span class="roman">Exodus</span> 4: 21&#150;7, probably preached about 1628&#150;9, are preserved in the British Library (Add. MS 14900), and nine sermons on <span class="roman">Exodus</span> 8: 1&#150;10, evidently part of the same series, were published under the title <span class="italic">Judgement and Mercy</span> (1645). Excerpts from another course of sermons on the book of <span class="roman">Ezra</span> were published as <span class="italic">Divine Cordials Delivered in Ten Sermons</span> (1644) from the shorthand notes of one William Reynolds, but the sole authorized edition of any of Shute's sermons was <span class="italic">Sarah and Hagar</span> (1649), a series of nineteen sermons on <span class="roman">Genesis</span> chapter 16, &#145;published according to his own original manuscripts, circumspectly examined and faithfully transcribed&#146; by Edward Sparke, rector of St Martin Pomeroy, Ironmonger Lane, London. Shute was also much in demand as a preacher to the East India Company: in September 1633 he preached &#145;a sermon of thanksgiving to Almighty God for returning their ships and estates in safety&#146; in which he protested against the recent reduction in mariners' wages  (<span class="italic">CSP col.</span>, 8.457, 468).<br>
<br>Shute was later described as one of those divines &#145;whose standing in the gap, when superstition was rushing in, drew upon them that venerable nickname of Puritans&#146;, and this was said to be the reason why he received no preferment until April 1642, not long before his death, when he was appointed archdeacon of Colchester. However, he was equally firm in his opposition to religious radicalism, and the same account describes him as &#145;so earnest a lover of union and right devotion that the dividing Separatist and superstitious Papist received a wound from him at every Lecture&#146;  (<span class="italic">An elegiacall Commemoration</span>). In November 1642 he was ordered to be imprisoned for refusing to contribute to the support of parliament, but it is not clear whether he was actually sent to prison: according to Robert Chestlin, he was merely &#145;molested, and vext to death, and denyed a Funerall Sermon to be preached by Dr Holdsworth as he desired&#146;, while another account states that he continued preaching until three months before his death, and then retired to the country house of one of his parishioners, a few miles out of London. His last recorded sermon, probably preached in 1642 or 1643, warns that &#145;Reformation must not bee by Faction and Tumult&#146;, and complains: &#145;The Impudency of some new preachers now, and the Ignorance of others, will foole us out of our Religion&#146;  (CUL, MS Dd.5.31, fol. 136). In 1643 he was appointed a member of the Westminster assembly, but did not live to attend it. He died on 13 June 1643, and was buried in the chancel of St Mary Woolnoth on 14 June, when several thousand people attended his funeral. His will bequeathed the sum of &pound;5 per annum to the governors of Giggleswick School to establish a university exhibition there. His wife outlived him by nearly thirty years, dying on 11 June 1670 at the age of over a hundred.<br>
