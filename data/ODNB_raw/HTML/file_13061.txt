<span class="headword">Herbert,  William</span>, second marquess of Powis and Jacobite second duke of Powis  (1657<span class="mult">x</span>61&#150;1745), <span class="occ">Jacobite sympathizer</span>, was the only son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13060/', "William Herbert, styled first marquess of Powis and Jacobite first duke of Powis (c.1626&#150;1696)")</script>, and Lady Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1691), younger daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26006/', "Edward Somerset, second marquess of Worcester")</script>. He was known as Lord Herbert from 1674 to 1687, and as Viscount Montgomery from 1687 to 1690, and afterwards, informally. He was a trainbearer to James II at his coronation. In May 1685 he married Mary (<i>d</i>. 1724), elder daughter and coheir of Sir Thomas Preston, bt, of Furness, Lancashire; six of the couple's children, two sons and four daughters, reached adulthood. Having gained experience at the siege of Buda, Montgomery was appointed on 8 May 1687 colonel of an infantry regiment taken from his protestant cousin Charles, marquess of Worcester. He was a deputy lieutenant of the twelve Welsh counties and Monmouthshire from 26 February until December 1688. At the revolution of 1688 his regiment garrisoned Hull; but on the night of 3 December the protestant officers seized the fortress and him. Soon released, Montgomery crossed with William's pass of 25 December to France, but returned before war was declared, largely to defend the family estates at law against government confiscation&#151;unsuccessfully.<br>
<br>Montgomery's Jacobite activity was concentrated in London rather than Wales. He was imprisoned in the Tower from 6 May to 7 November 1689. Named in a proclamation of 14 July 1690, he escaped capture. That autumn James appointed a committee to manage his affairs, the Select Number  (BL, Add. MS 47608, fols. 120, 165<i>v</i>), comprising four Anglican tories and two moderate Catholic peers' sons, Montgomery and Lord Brudenell. Montgomery's main correspondent was Mary of Modena; his codenames included Mr Thompson, Mr Mun, and William Sibson. In March 1692 James appointed him colonel of a cavalry regiment for the rising to accompany the invasion from La Hogue, which he secretly recruited. From 1693, in Jacobite disputes over policy, the Select Number were the leaders of the &#145;non-compounders&#146;, who opposed major constitutional concessions by James and called for a French invasion. Montgomery's draft survives for their memorial of 21 February 1694 declaring that 20,000 troops would suffice, and he lukewarmly supported Robert Charnock's 1695 mission to France. For the latter treason, a proclamation of 23 March 1696 offered &pound;500 rewards for him and Sir John Fenwick, both then in hiding, and on 27 May he was indicted. Succeeding his attainted father in July, he remained legally a commoner until 1722. He ignored advice to escape overseas, conscious that if he were outlawed the 1695 grant of the family estates to the earl of Rochford would become virtually irreversible. On 15 December 1696 Montgomery surrendered and was committed to Newgate. Some Williamites, who claimed that he already was outlawed, found that the sheriffs of London had omitted necessary formalities. According to Thomas, earl of Ailesbury, William pressed the sheriffs to falsify the record. Montgomery was bailed on 17 June 1697, only because gaol fever made Newgate unsafe.<br>
<br>Refused a licence to remain in England under the act 9 Wm III c. 1, Montgomery crossed in February 1698 to Flanders. The Holy Roman emperor interceded for him as head of the English lay Catholics, but Rochford's influence prevailed. He settled at Ghent and avoided visiting France (except Paris in 1701, while the Jacobite court was at Bourbon), though educating his sons there under aliases. Rochford, still unable to obtain full possession, finally sold back the estates. Powis (as he was generally known) returned to England in May 1703. He immediately resumed his father's alterations at Powis Castle and constructed its terrace gardens. Having sold old Powis House to the duke of Newcastle in 1705 for &pound;7000, he built a new Powis House in Great Ormond Street, London. Leased in 1712 to the French ambassador, the duc d'Aumont, it mysteriously burned down on 26 January 1713, but Louis XIV paid for an even more palatial rebuilding. From 1705 onwards Powis petitioned the government to reverse his father's outlawry. He therefore avoided Jacobite activity, though his female relatives later became slightly involved. Nevertheless, during the rising of 1715 he was imprisoned in the Tower from September 1715 to May 1716. A Francophile, he spent the next decade largely in France.<br>
<br>Powis's eldest child, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/38608/', "Lady Mary Herbert (1686&#150;1775)")</script>, a pioneer female international speculator and entrepreneur, dominated him, and brought their semi-princely family to ruin in Europe's uncharted new financial markets. In 1718 Lord Panmure (and, obliquely, she herself) suggested her as a possible bride for the Pretender. During 1719 her speculations in French Mississippi Company shares made her a <i>millionaire</i> on paper. She rejected the future duc de Bouillon's proposal, though the regent and, it seems, Powis supported it&#151;apparently determined to wed either a reigning prince, as Pope's &#145;Epistle to Bathurst&#146; implies, or her fellow <i>millionaire</i> Joseph Gage. In 1720 she undertook, and drew her father and brothers into, even vaster speculations on borrowed money. The collapse of John Law's system left them liable for most of her French and English debts of over &pound;170,000. Powis was briefly imprisoned for debt in Paris, and his elder son, William, then Lord Montgomery (1688&#150;1748), in London. They were never again free, despite a 1726 estates settlement, from bailiffs, lawsuits, and the need for financial trickery. Only the rich lead mines which Powis had since 1705 developed at Llangynog, Montgomeryshire, and now exploited oppressively to exhaustion, averted total ruin. The family split apart: his sons denounced Powis's continuing trust in Lady Mary's incorrigible overoptimism. He largely financed her and Gage in their unscrupulous and varied counter-suits against their main creditor, Richard Cantillon, and in their mining operations in Spain.<br>
<br>In 1722 Powis finally had his father's outlawry reversed, recovering the marquessate and, formally, his estates. Jacobites styled him duke of Powis, and he prepared but did not press a legal statement claiming that title. He was summoned to parliament on 8 October 1722 but, as a Catholic, never sat. Although he briefly considered a protestant match for Lord Montgomery he did not convert to Anglicanism, as several Catholic general histories assumed. Yet he took little part in Catholic national affairs or Welsh tory politics. He died between 20 and 22 October 1745 at his house in Frith Street, Soho, and was buried on 28 October at Hendon, the family's Middlesex estate. His will and trusts bequeathed &pound;4000 to Catholic charities and missions, partly to honour belatedly his father's will.<br>
<br>Powis's estranged elder son, William, third marquess, died unmarried. He unexpectedly left his estates to his cousin Henry Arthur, Lord Herbert of Cherbury, a protestant and aggressive whig, immediately created earl of Powis: one motive was to preserve Powis Castle. The bequest greatly damaged Montgomeryshire Catholicism. The younger son, Lord Edward Herbert (<i>d</i>. 1734), had married Henrietta, daughter of his formerly Catholic schoolfellow James, first Earl Waldegrave, and left a posthumous daughter, Barbara. To forestall her possible rival claim, the earl of Powis gained custody with Lady Mary's bribed assistance, and married her in 1751.<br>
