<span class="headword">Collins,  John Ulric</span>  (<em>c.</em>1750&#150;1807), <span class="occ">army officer in the East India Company and diplomatist</span>, is of unknown parentage; although his name suggests Irish ancestry, there is evidence for an early connection with Devon. An East India Company cadet, Collins sailed for Asia on 2 December 1769 on board the <i>Vansittart</i> and arrived at Madras on 26 July 1770. As there were then limited vacancies in the commissioned ranks of the Bengal army, he joined the select picket of gentleman cadets, a separate company of young men waiting to be commissioned into a regiment which, in the field, formed part of the advance guard. With the select pickets he likely saw action in 1774 during the Rohilla War. Three years later the 19th native infantry regiment was created, and Collins obtained his commission. Initially known as Jack by his fellow officers, he was anyway regarded as vain. Later, as his style became increasingly pompous, he was called King Collins, or Little King Collins. In November 1780 Collins was made a captain, and in 1785 was appointed military storekeeper at Fort William, Calcutta. On 24 November 1790, in Calcutta, he married Charlotte (1772&#150;1857), daughter of William and Elizabeth Wrangham of St Helena. The couple had two sons, George Theophilus (1792&#150;1833) and Henry John (<i>b</i>. 1793).<br>
<br>By the early 1790s Collins was Calcutta's town major. From 1793 he was the private secretary to Governor-General Sir John Shore. Made a lieutenant-colonel on 27 July 1796, early in the next year he travelled with Shore to Lucknow to meet Asaf ud-Daula, nawab-vizier of Oudh. In January 1798, after Asaf ud-Daula's death, he was again in Lucknow, when Shore secured the succession of the late ruler's brother Saadat Ali against the claims of Wazir Ali, the late ruler's son. Days before relinquishing office in March 1798 Shore appointed Collins resident to the court of Sindhia, the Maratha leader based at Gwalior who, possessing a powerful army, dominated the Delhi&#150;Agra tract. Taking charge of the residency in September 1799 while Sindhia was at Poona, Collins resided at Fatehgarh. In October 1799, while leading his lavishly clothed personal escort to Jaipur and carrying Rs 10,000 from Governor-General Mornington for the raja, he secured the surrender of Wazir Ali, who was accused of murdering the Benares resident George Cherry. On 29 May 1800 Collins became a colonel. He attended Sindhia's court on two occasions, between February and May 1802 and February and August 1803, and twice failed to negotiate Sindhia's peaceful accession to the governor-general's system of subsidiary alliances. The second mission's failure and his frustrated departure from Sindhia's camp on 3 August 1803 was the immediate cause of the Second Anglo-Maratha War.<br>
<br>In September 1803 Collins, <i>en route</i> to Hyderabad and suffering from gout, met General Arthur Wellesley and members of his staff. Captain John Blakiston later described the occasion:<blockquote>In front of a noble suite of tents, which might have served the great Mogul, we were received by an insignificant, little old-looking man, dressed in an old fashioned military coat, white breeches, sky-blue silk-stockings, and large glaring buckles on his shoes, having his highly powdered wig, from which depended a pig-tail of no ordinary dimensions, surmounted by a small, round black silk hat, ornamented with a single black ostrich feather, looking altogether not unlike a monkey dressed up for Bartholomew fair. There was, however, a fire in his small black eye, shooting out from beneath a large, shaggy, pent-house brow, which more than counter-balanced the ridicule that his first appearance naturally excited.</blockquote>Blakiston notes how they laughed at &#145;the little man&#146; and his warnings about Sindhia's deadly efficient artillery  (Blakiston, 1.144&#150;5). At this time Collins may also have kept a zenana.<br>
<br>In recognition of his efforts as resident with Sindhia, Wellesley made Collins his honorary aide-de-camp and in early 1804 appointed him resident to the nawab-vizier of Oudh. In 1805, a still gouty Collins described himself as infirm. He died at Lucknow on 11 June 1807 and, with sons of the nawab-vizier attending, was buried that day near the Aminabad bazaar with full civil and military honours. A Christian cemetery, the Kallan-ka-Lat, or Collins's monument, grew around his imposing tomb.<br>
