<span class="headword">Barham,  Henry</span>  (1670?&#150;1726), <span class="occ">botanist</span>, was descended from the Barhams of Barham Court in Kent. Little is known of his life beyond that conveyed in his letters to Sir Hans Sloane, which reveal that Barham's father, a physician, intended to give him a university education but died while his son was still young. His mother remarried soon afterwards, and the boy was apprenticed when he was about fourteen to a surgeon. He left this situation to become surgeon's mate in HMS <i>Vanguard</i>, from which he was promoted to be surgeon to another warship. Tiring of the monotony of his life, he went to Spain, then to Madras, arriving in Jamaica probably before the end of the century. According to his own account, he obtained a lucrative practice and was appointed surgeon-major over all regiments of horse in the island.<br>
<br>Barham stated that after he came to Jamaica he read widely, especially books on physical matters. Despite his irregular education, and his tendency to be led astray by fantastic and utopian ideas, he undoubtedly acquired a detailed knowledge of the flora and fauna of Jamaica. In 1715 he introduced the cultivation of logwood, later a common product. Barham was a prolific correspondent of Sir Hans Sloane, who transcribed many extracts from Barham's letters relating to the medicinal properties of plants into his own copy of his <span class="italic">Natural History of Jamaica</span>. Several specimens of Jamaican plant material went into Sloane's herbarium.<br>
<br>Sloane received in 1711 a treatise, &#145;Hortus Americanus&#146;, written by Barham; this was later published, in 1794, with a preface attributing it to Henry Barham MD (<i>d</i>. 1746), Barham's son. Nothing is known of Barham's wife who, according to a letter to Sloane, was still alive in 1725. Their son apparently practised as a physician in Jamaica from the beginning of the century, acquired much property on marriage, and returned to England in 1740 to settle at Staines, Middlesex.<br>
<br>About 1716 Barham returned to England and settled at Great Carter Lane in the City of London. He gave some eighty American plants to the Physic Garden at Chelsea, noting with regret that fewer than half were to be seen when he visited in 1718. He also devoted himself to the rearing of silkworms and the manufacture of silk, his treatise on this subject being read to the Royal Society and published in the <span class="italic">Philosophical Transactions</span> in 1719. He was elected fellow of the Royal Society in November 1717, and shortly after his arrival in England was made free of the Company of Surgeons, although his hopes of obtaining the diploma of MD were not fulfilled.<br>
<br>Barham promoted a scheme to mine silver in Jamaica, and applied in 1720 for the position of superintendent to a mining company formed to implement his proposals. He received the appointment on his own terms, having stated that his own business prospects were so good that he would not sacrifice them for less than &pound;500 a year, but the enterprise was a complete failure and the one year's salary owed to him was never paid. He continued to reside in Jamaica until his death at Spanish Town in May 1726. Barham's &#145;History of Jamaica&#146;, which his son sent to Sloane in the hope that it might be published, remained in manuscript among Sloane's papers.<br>
