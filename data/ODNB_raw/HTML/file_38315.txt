<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Jones,  Daniel</span>  (1881&#150;1967), <span class="occ">phonetician</span>, was born on 12 September 1881 at 12 Norfolk Crescent, near Marble Arch in central London, the son of a leading London barrister, also named Daniel Jones (1834&#150;1915), and his second wife, Viola Carte (1848&#150;1925). Jones was the third of four sons (his two elder brothers being from his father's previous marriage). His mother came from a notable musical family and was the sister of Richard D'Oyly Carte, the theatre impresario who sponsored Sir W. S. Gilbert and Sir Arthur Sullivan. Apart from his legal talents, Daniel Jones senior is also known as one of the enthusiasts who helped develop the modern game of tennis. In 1890 the Jones family moved to Wimbledon, where the Lawn Tennis Association had its headquarters, and it was there that young Daniel spent his formative years.<h2>
<a name="Educationandearlycareer"></a>Education and early career</h2>Jones began his education at Ludgrove preparatory school and spent two years at Radley College; he left in 1897 to complete his schooling as a day boy at University College School, London. He went on to read mathematics at King's College, Cambridge; he obtained his BA degree in 1903 and proceeded MA in 1907. While still an undergraduate he became fascinated with language and developed his practical talents in this area by attending short language courses, first in England and later in Germany. There he spent a month at Marburg, where he was introduced to phonetics by a man whom Jones held ever afterwards in the highest respect&#151;William Tilly, an Australian-born pioneer of what would later be known as immersion language-teaching techniques.<br>
<br>Intending to follow in his father's profession, on leaving university Jones began to read for the bar. But ill health forced him to interrupt his studies and he took the chance to spend a year (1905&#150;6) in France, promising his father to continue his legal training on his return. He attended classes in phonetics and linguistics at the University of Paris, coming under the influence of Paul Passy, the leading French phonetician of his time. Passy, who remained the most significant influence on Jones's linguistic ideas throughout his life, encouraged him to join the International Phonetic Association (IPA), and to sit the IPA examination in the phonetics of French. Jones passed with outstanding marks and was persuaded by Passy to consider making phonetics his career. It is notable that he obtained no further linguistic qualifications of any sort, even though he was later awarded honorary doctorates from Z&uuml;rich (1936) and Edinburgh (1958).<br>
<br>Jones returned to London and fulfilled his filial duty by completing his legal studies, being called to the bar in 1907; but, realizing that he had no interest whatsoever in the law, he had meanwhile obtained a part-time appointment as a temporary lecturer in phonetics at University College, London. It was at this point that he also took private tuition from the Oxford phonetician and linguist Henry Sweet, already a legendary figure in his own lifetime. Sweet was to prove the third formative influence on Jones's linguistic outlook.<br>
<br>On 29 August 1911 Jones married Cyrille Motte (1890&#150;1969), Paul Passy's niece; they had a son and daughter. Until 1934 Jones and his family lived in London, but he then bought a house at 3 Marsham Way, Gerrards Cross, Buckinghamshire, where he remained until his death.<br>
<br>For several years Jones, teaching single-handed, not only drew increasing numbers of students to his classes but also undertook research in many areas of articulatory phonetics. This included work on what were, to the Western world at that time, virtually unknown non-European languages. He was eventually allowed to take on some part-time staff at University College, and later (in 1913) set up a laboratory for experimental phonetic research.<h2>
<a name="Recognitionandpublications"></a>Recognition and publications</h2>In 1912 University College recognized the significance of the work of Jones and his colleagues when a university department (the first such in Britain) was set up with Jones at its head. This also happened to be the year in which Bernard Shaw wrote <span class="italic">Pygmalion</span>, and it is known that Jones helped Shaw by advising him on technical matters. Despite what would appear to be deliberately misleading remarks in Shaw's preface, attempting to link the play to the recently deceased Henry Sweet, it is now thought likely that it was Daniel Jones who largely inspired Shaw's fictional phonetician Henry Higgins.<br>
<br>In 1913&#150;14 Jones taught one day a week at Oxford University for two terms, acting effectively as Sweet's replacement, but refused the offer of a full-time post. Instead, in 1915, he accepted a readership from London. Despite the war his department was growing in size and significance, and it continued to expand after the war. Several more staff, including full-timers, were now recruited to cope with increasing student numbers, and many distinguished linguists began their careers under Jones's aegis, including Lilias Armstrong, Arthur Lloyd James, Harold Palmer, Ida Ward, and, later, J. R. Firth. In 1921 Jones was appointed to a chair in phonetics, the first in a modern linguistic discipline ever to be set up in a British university; he held this post until his retirement in 1949, when he was granted the title of professor emeritus.<br>
<br>Jones&#151;like his mentors Tilly, Passy, and Sweet&#151;was renowned for remarkable powers of auditory discrimination and imitation, and for insisting on the primacy of such practical aspects in phonetic teaching and research. This is reflected in the excellent standards of observation of phonetic phenomena to be found both in his own publications and in those of his followers. Jones's outstanding early works include <span class="italic">Intonation Curves</span>, an early quasi-instrumental study of pitch that appeared in 1909, and in the same year he published the elementary, but highly successful, <span class="italic">Pronunciation of English</span>. The first editions of the latter were characterized by a largely prescriptive elocutionary approach, together with occasional proscription of non-standard pronunciations. Despite its commercial success, Jones soon became positively ashamed of the book. He thoroughly revised the material in 1950, replacing the prescriptivism by his later liberal views on accent variation, and in this improved form it remains in print to the present day.<br>
<br>In 1913 Jones co-edited (with Hermann Michaelis) the <span class="italic">Phonetic Dictionary of the English Language</span>. Surprisingly, no serious attempt at a dedicated English pronunciation dictionary had been produced in Britain since the eighteenth century. But, though worthy of recognition as a pioneering effort, it was completely overshadowed in 1917 by the success of Jones's own masterly and comprehensive <span class="italic">English Pronouncing Dictionary</span>&#151;or <span class="italic">EPD</span>, as it is often known. From his original prescriptive position, in which he advocated elocutionary training for dialect speakers in order for them to acquire standard pronunciation, Jones had quite rapidly moved to the view that all had the right to use whatever type of pronunciation they themselves preferred. He considered that it was no part of the phonetician's task to decide on speech standards, but rather to be totally objective in describing current usage, declaring pithily that a phonetician should ideally be &#145;a living phonograph&#146;. Such an open-minded standpoint was decades ahead of its time, and Jones encountered much opposition to his liberal attitudes. None the less, the <span class="italic">EPD</span> set the global standard for all subsequent pronunciation dictionaries, rapidly becoming the recognized authority on British usages&#151;a position it held unchallenged until the 1990s. In revised form, it still has large sales in many countries.<br>
<br>Together with the <span class="italic">EPD</span>, Jones's other most influential work proved to be the <span class="italic">Outline of English Pronunciation</span> (1918). Aimed originally at the foreign learner, this was the first reliable comprehensive description of the pronunciation of English, or indeed of any language. The non-regional variety of educated British English used as a descriptive model was later (in 1926, in the third edition of the <span class="italic">EPD</span>) designated &#145;Received Pronunciation&#146;; Jones by reviving a little-used Victorian expression was the innovator, in a modern context, both of the technical term and its more common abbreviation, RP. The general phonetic descriptive framework of the <span class="italic">Outline</span> penetrated linguistics worldwide, having a profound influence on Leonard Bloomfield and the whole American structuralist school. Jones's <span class="italic">Outline</span>, completely revised and rewritten in 1932, reigned for more than forty years as the unique authority on British English pronunciation; it is still in print today.<br>
<br>Jones also produced seminal research on African and Asian languages&#151;notably the <span class="italic">Cantonese Phonetic Reader</span> (1912), the <span class="italic">Sechuana Reader</span> (1916), and the <span class="italic">Colloquial Sinhalese Reader</span> (1919)&#151;invariably written in co-operation with reliable native-speaker informants, who were given full credit as co-authors. The results were classic works that are milestones in the history of the phonetic descriptions of the languages concerned. In particular, Jones produced ground-breaking work on the analysis of tone languages for which he has yet to receive adequate recognition. His <span class="italic">Cantonese Phonetic Reader</span> was one of the earliest studies in the field. This was followed by the innovative <span class="italic">Sechuana Reader</span>, which contained a perceptive analysis of register tone in the southern African language Tswana, including the feature eventually to become known as &#145;downstep&#146;. Jones's research on African languages was subsequently continued, not only at University College but also by several of his former students at the School of Oriental and African Studies.<br>
<br>Jones was the first writer in English to use the word &#145;phoneme&#146; in its current sense of a minimal unit of sound capable of distinguishing meaning, borrowing the concept from the Polish linguist Jan Baudouin de Courtenay. It was in a lecture given to the London Philological Society in 1917 that Jones appears to have used the term publicly for the first time, though he later claimed that the theory had occupied a &#145;regular place in the teaching&#146; of his department from 1915 onwards. Jones was ultimately responsible for the promulgation of the phoneme principle in the pre-1920 Western world. It was certainly owing to him and his London colleagues that phonemic concepts became firmly established in British linguistics by the early 1920s&#151;well before the advent of either the European Prague school or the American linguistic structuralists.<br>
<br>The <span class="italic">Pronunciation of Russian</span>, which for long was the only reliable phonetic description of the language, appeared in 1923. In 1927 Jones was a co-author of <span class="italic">Colloquial French</span>, issued with accompanying disc recordings&#151;a now largely forgotten <i>tour de force</i> which was a watershed in applied linguistics, being the most successful early example of the audio-lingual method in language teaching. He then turned from writing books to concentrate on producing numerous influential articles, including several on the phoneme concept. These can now be seen as leading up to <span class="italic">The Phoneme: its Nature and Use</span>, the book Jones regarded as his life's work. When the book eventually came out in 1950, many linguists considered it outdated; he was bitterly disappointed with the critical reception it received. In the immediately following years, after his official retirement, Jones produced important revisions of several of his major books and, in 1957, the historiographical <span class="italic">History and Meaning of the Term &#145;Phoneme&#146;</span>.<br>
<br>Another significant aspect of Jones's work is his system of cardinal vowels, the underlying research for which was first made known in 1917 through an article in <span class="italic">Nature</span>. It provided an elegantly simple dual-parameter model of vowel description based on tongue-arch height and lip shape. Jones subsequently elaborated on the theory, and arrived eventually at a system of eight rounded and eight unrounded front and back vowels at articulatorily equidistant intervals, plus two close central vowels. Jones produced three recorded versions of the vowels, of which the last (1956) is the best known. Although its theoretical basis is now largely rejected, the cardinal vowel system has nevertheless been widely adopted ever since its inception; most non-instrumental methods of vowel description derive ultimately from Jones's model.<h2>
<a name="Otheractivities"></a>Other activities</h2>From 1906 on, Jones was, together with Paul Passy, the main force behind the IPA, and editor of its influential organ, <span class="italic">Le Ma&icirc;tre Phon&eacute;tique</span>, thus playing a leading role in spreading the International Phonetic Alphabet, and laying the foundation for the universal recognition it enjoys today. He was elected assistant secretary of the IPA in 1909 and made secretary in 1928; from 1950 onwards he was the association's president.<br>
<br>Jones was also a supporter of spelling reform: in 1911 he joined the committee of the British Simplified Spelling Society and in 1946 was appointed president, a position he retained until he died. He also co-operated enthusiastically on schemes for alphabets later adopted for various African languages, and subsequently devised romanized alphabets for Indian languages and Japanese.<br>
<br>In 1926 Jones became a founder member of the BBC advisory committee on spoken English. Perhaps because of his disagreement with the eccentrically prescriptive views of certain members of the committee&#151;which included such eminent figures as Bernard Shaw and the poet laureate Robert Bridges&#151;he left dealings with it largely to his former pupil and colleague Arthur Lloyd James. When, on the outbreak of war, the committee ceased to function, and later, as the result of tragic personal circumstances, Lloyd James's contacts with the BBC ceased, Jones took over. From 1942 to 1967 Daniel Jones was chief pronunciation adviser to the BBC, and in that role, paradoxically considering his libertarian linguistic views, was to a degree responsible for reinforcing the notion of &#145;BBC English&#146; as a pronunciation standard. The early editions of his books now provide us with interesting information on the state of English pronunciation at the time. The first mentions of the spread of the glottal stop in English are to be found in Jones's works, as are predictions of future language change, including hints of the increasing influence of vernacular London speech on RP, thus presaging what is nowadays termed &#145;estuary English&#146;.<br>
<br>Apart from linguistic matters, Jones's only other major preoccupation was the study of oriental religion and philosophy, in particular as interpreted by theosophists and similar groups. In his youth, religion of any kind had concerned him little, but by the time he reached middle age, theosophical ideas began to play an increasingly important part in his daily thought. Such concepts even infiltrate into his linguistic writings, and it is difficult to interpret some of his later statements on the phoneme without taking due account of them. Theosophical influences also seem to be why Jones from the 1930s onwards emphasized the benefits of applied practical phonetics, and increasingly regarded scientific approaches with suspicion.<h2>
<a name="Finalyears"></a>Final years</h2>Jones continued working&#151;writing and revising his academic publications, playing a full part in the IPA and the Simplified Spelling Society, and advising on pronunciation for the BBC&#151;long after his official retirement, in fact well into his eighties. His very last jointly written book, the <span class="italic">Phonetics of Russian</span> (1969), did not in fact appear until after his death. In old age he came to be considered almost as a kind of elder statesman of phonetics, and scholars from all over the world came to consult him on linguistic matters. After a long period of illness, exacerbated by painful arthritis, he died on 4 December 1967 at his home in Gerrards Cross.<br>
<br>It is indicative that so many of Jones's books remained in print into the twenty-first century, and that he is still so frequently cited as a phonetic authority. His writings, now regarded as classic works, have proved outstanding, not only for reliability but also for lucid explication. They established him as by far the best-known phonetician of his generation. His ideas and methods, later to be propagated by his colleagues and former pupils, even now continue to influence most areas of phonetics and pronunciation teaching. Jones takes his place among the world's leading figures in twentieth-century linguistics; his claim to be the greatest of all British phoneticians is challenged only by Sweet.<br>
