<span class="headword">Weedall,  Henry</span>  (1788&#150;1859), <span class="occ">Roman Catholic priest and college head</span>, was born in London on 6 September 1788, the son of a doctor. He was educated at Sedgley Park School in Staffordshire (1794&#150;1804) and chosen by Bishop John Milner, vicar apostolic of the midland district, to transfer to Oscott College in 1804. He was one of only six students for the priesthood in residence when Milner took direct control in 1808. Ordained on 6 April 1814 he became the first Oscott student to join the staff of the college, where he taught classics and theology; he was made vice-president and succeeded Thomas Walsh as president in 1826. Diminutive in stature, he was never robust in health and suffered from poor eyesight and severe headaches (possibly migraine). Even in his portrait as college president he is shown wearing spectacles. Despite his physical weakness he worked closely with Bishop Walsh to enhance the intellectual and spiritual stature of Oscott. Two years abroad renewed his strength and he returned in 1832 full of plans to rebuild the college. He bought a new site in 1833 and masterminded an ambitious project modelled on an Oxford college; it was finally completed by A. W. Pugin. The buildings were finished in 1838, and in 1839 Weedall achieved affiliation for the college to London University. Oscott was one of the first Catholic colleges to be affiliated, and Weedall regarded this as the climax of his work of consolidation and expansion.<br>
<br>By 1840 Nicholas Wiseman was the rising star in English Catholicism and Walsh wanted him as coadjutor in the midland district, using Oscott as a platform. In a curiously callous move, Weedall was removed from Oscott after thirty-six years as student, professor, and president to make room for Wiseman. Weedall was nominated as vicar apostolic of the northern district, despite being weak in health and, as Walsh wrote, of &#145;so anxious a mind&#146; that he was most unsuitable for the episcopal role. Weedall was desperate to escape the appointment and vocal opposition from a section of the northern clergy gave him the opportunity. He actually encouraged them to make clear their dislike of his nomination, and they gladly helped him to renounce it. The pope's direct intervention freed Weedall, and he returned triumphantly from Rome only to find Wiseman safely installed in Oscott. For a time Weedall was head of the preparatory school at Old Oscott but in 1843 left for the mission at Leamington Spa.<br>
<br>At the restoration of the hierarchy in 1850 Weedall was appointed provost of the chapter of the new diocese of Birmingham. William Ullathorne, Walsh's successor, had turned to Weedall in frustration at the poor government of Oscott in the late 1840s. As early as 1848 Ullathorne was convinced that Weedall's influence would restore the confidence of the midland clergy in Oscott. In Weedall's own view, there had been &#145;too much of splash and dash&#146;, to the detriment of the college's reputation. Ullathorne pressed Weedall to return in the role of general overseer, to which finally he agreed in 1853, the year in which he also hosted the first Westminster synod. The last six years of his life were spent as president of Oscott; under Ullathorne's influence he gradually steered the college in the direction of a Tridentine seminary, separating lay and clerical education, and restoring its &#145;sober ecclesiastical character&#146;. Weedall died at Oscott on 7 November 1859 and was buried in the chantry. He had been the admired orator on many similar occasions, including the funerals of Bishop Walsh and the earl of Shrewsbury; his own eulogy was preached by John Henry Newman.<br>
