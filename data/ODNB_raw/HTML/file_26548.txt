<span class="headword">Stockwood,  John</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1610), <span class="occ">schoolmaster and writer</span>, whose early years remain obscure, was receiving a pension from St John's College, Cambridge, at the time of Queen Elizabeth's visitation in 1564. He received his BA from the University of Heidelberg (1567) and MA from Oxford (1575) and was incorporated in each degree respectively at Oxford (1575) and Cambridge (1579), intending at the latter university to establish a <i>ludus literarius</i> (primary or elementary school). Stockwood may have been a minister in Battle in 1571. On 23 April the same year he married Christiana Hopkins, in Tonbridge, Kent.<br>
<br>The Skinners' Company of London, founders of Tonbridge Free School, appointed Stockwood to be the school's third headmaster in 1574. In 1587 he was appointed vicar of Tonbridge and that same year the school's governors &#145;warned him to resign&#146;, either because he was now a pluralist or they were dissatisfied with his administration of the school, or perhaps a bit of both. Stockwood was famous for his fiery, uncompromising style of preaching, and gave two sermons on topical issues at the famed Paul's Cross (the outdoor pulpit of St Paul's Cathedral) on 24 August 1578 and 10 May 1579. In both he attacked vigorously the acting profession and theatre culture, as part of a larger public debate that had been taking place on this issue since 1575. In addition, he spoke out against other pastimes and entertainments that he believed diverted people away from studying the <span class="roman">Bible</span>. His sermons also reflected his ideas on educational reform. Stockwood railed against &#145;popish schoolteachers&#146; and opposed the inclusion of certain, unedifying classical authors, such as Terence, in the curricula of young pupils. He possessed a strong distaste for ignorant clergy and &#145;profane&#146; books.<br>
<br>Stockwood published three religious-pedagogical and three grammatical treatises, in both English and Latin, and four sermons. His grammar primer, <span class="italic">Disputatiuncularum grammaticalium libellus</span>, was first published in 1598 and was reissued every few years well into the eighteenth century. Stockwood also translated into English from Latin at least nine works (some written by Heinrich Bullinger and Theodore Beza) including a catechism for householders, commentaries on <span class="roman">Ecclesiastes</span>, <span class="roman">Esther</span>, and <span class="roman">Psalm 51</span>, and treatises on surviving plague and keeping the sabbath. He dedicated his writings to such contemporary luminaries as the earl and countess of Huntingdon, Sir Francis Walsingham, Sir Henry Sidney, and the earl of Essex, all known for having puritan sympathies, and some for having assisted Stockwood financially. The stern but kindly and humorous tone of his works suggests a committed interest in the moral development of children. He spoke out against corrupt executors who exploited orphaned children, and believed that improper education was responsible for the young's growing up to lead lives of crime, a problem which seemed particularly acute in his day.<br>
<br>Stockwood had at least two children, both born in Tonbridge: Jonathan (<i>b</i>. 1586), who attended St John's College, Cambridge (1605&#150;9), and a daughter, Persis, who married William Dale on 12 July 1593. Stockwood seems to have spent many of his later years in great poverty. The town of Gravesend paid him 40<i>s</i>. in 1594 at the request of Sir Robert Sidney, and in 1597 Stockwood dedicated his <span class="italic">Progymnasma scholasticum</span> to the earl of Essex, whom he thanked for protecting him against detractors and for providing monetary assistance. Stockwood probably remained vicar of Tonbridge until his death in July 1610. He was buried there on 27 July.<br>
