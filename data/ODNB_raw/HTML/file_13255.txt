<span class="headword">Hild</span> <span class="st"> [St Hild, Hilda]</span>  (614&#150;680), <span class="occ">abbess of Strensall&#150;Whitby</span>, was the daughter of Hereric, a Deiran prince, and his wife, Breguswith. Hereric was a nephew of Eadwine of Northumbria and the family fortunes seem to have been determined by that relationship. Hereric's exile and murder were probably a consequence of the fall of Eadwine, while the marriage of his daughter, Hild's sister Hereswith, with the East Anglian prince (later king) &AElig;thelhere, built upon links first established by her great-uncle.<br>
<br>Hild was baptized with Eadwine on Easter day (12 April) 627. According to Bede, she decided to enter the religious life while staying in East Anglia, influenced by the example of Hereswith, who had already withdrawn to the Frankish monastery of Chelles. Initially Hild herself also intended to enter Chelles, but was persuaded by Bishop &Aacute;ed&aacute;n to return to Northumbria, where she established herself in the monastery of Hartlepool, whose founder, Heiu, another disciple of &Aacute;ed&aacute;n, was apparently displaced to make way for her. Bede says, with somewhat suspicious and perhaps christologically determined symmetry, that Hild was thirty-three when she became a nun, and that she lived a further thirty-three years. Presumably, therefore, her entry into religion, perhaps as a widow, is to be dated to 647 and in any case it must have been before 651, when &Aacute;ed&aacute;n died.<br>
<br>The difficulty with this narrative is that Chelles can scarcely have been founded before 648, the earliest possible date of the marriage of its founder, the Anglo-Saxon Balthild, to the Merovingian king, Clovis II; indeed it is more likely to have been established <i>c</i>.660. Probably, then, Bede's informants at Whitby had made a mistake, confounding Chelles with its mother house of Jouarre (founded at some time between about 620 and 630) or with Faremoutiers (founded between about 615 and 620), the earliest double monastery in the Seine basin and also home to English princesses in the mid-seventh century. At all events, the story is evidence of Hild's early contacts with the Frankish kingdom of Neustria, contacts she almost certainly maintained.<br>
<br>Once established in the first royal nunnery in Northumbria, Hild remained in close touch with the Northumbrian religious &eacute;lite and was visited &#145;assiduously&#146; by &Aacute;ed&aacute;n and others. In 655, in accordance with a vow made by King Oswiu before his victory over the Mercians at the battle of the Winw&aelig;d, she received custody of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8622/', "&#198;lffl&#230;d")</script>, his daughter and her kinswoman, whom she placed in the monastery at Hartlepool. Two years later she founded &#145;Strean&aelig;shalch&#146;, on one of twelve estates of ten hides given by Oswiu to the church in further fulfilment of vows made before the Winw&aelig;d. The location of this monastery is problematic. There are good reasons to link it with both Strensall, near York, and Whitby, and it has been argued that it comprised communities in both places.<br>
<br>Oswiu and his queen, Hild's relative Eanfl&aelig;d, probably intended <i>ab initio</i> to establish Strensall&#150;Whitby as their family monastery and mausoleum, sending their daughter &AElig;lffl&aelig;d thither with Hild. In 664 the monastery was the scene of the famous synod, which determined that the Northumbrian church should henceforth follow the Roman Easter. Curiously, despite her links with the Roman mission, Hild appears to have taken the part of Bishop &Aacute;ed&aacute;n and the Lindisfarne community. Her attitude was perhaps determined not so much by the issues as by personal considerations, in particular her friendship with &Aacute;ed&aacute;n and a burgeoning hostility to the young Wilfrid, in 664 the spokesman for the supporters of the Roman observance.<br>
<br>Strensall&#150;Whitby's growing importance was buttressed by the school which Hild established there, five of whose pupils became bishops: Bosa (York), &AElig;tla (Dorchester), Oftfor (Worcester), John of Beverley (Hexham and York), and Wilfrid (York). After 669 the monastery developed close links with the school established by Archbishop Theodore at Canterbury; both Oftfor and John of Beverley went on to study there. Hild's alliance with Theodore was probably strengthened by a common hostility to Wilfrid, by then bishop of York. Certainly, it was a pupil of Hild's who was intruded into York when Wilfrid was expelled from that see in 678, and she joined Theodore in sending envoys to Rome to oppose the despoiled bishop in his ensuing appeal to the Holy See. Most probably, too, hers were the English messengers responsible for inciting Ebroin, the Neustrian mayor of the palace, to such hostility towards Wilfrid that he was forced to take an indirect route to Rome through Frisia and Austrasia.<br>
<br>Hild was praised by Bede for her skill as a counsellor of kings, princes, and the common people; for the rule which she established at Strensall&#150;Whitby; and for her exemplary life. Although he stresses her qualities as a spiritual mother and as a servant of the Lord, he never describes her as a virgin, and it may be that she had been married before she entered religion.<br>
<br>In 674 Hild was afflicted with the disease which was eventually to kill her. According to Bede, her death in 680 was accompanied by wonders, including visions (seen by nuns at Whitby itself and at the dependent community at Hackness) of her soul being taken to heaven by angels. Such visions, which also characterized the deaths of holy women at the Frankish monastery of Faremoutiers, are an indication that Hild's cult began early. Her feast day, 17 November, was observed by the early eighth century, when it was added to the calendar of St Willibrord, the Northumbrian bishop of Utrecht. She appears in the <span class="italic">Old English Martyrology</span>, and it has been suggested that the entry in this ninth-century compilation bears traces of a lost early life. She scarcely features, however, in pre-conquest liturgical material, and her cult was probably very local.<br>
<br>Hild's relics were later translated from Whitby to Glastonbury, perhaps as early as the eighth century but more probably in the reign of Edmund I (<i>r</i>. 939&#150;46). By the twelfth century they had been placed in a monument (&#145;pyramid&#146;) to the left of the high altar at Glastonbury. There is some evidence, however, that Whitby, which continued to commemorate both deposition and translation (25 August), never relinquished its claim to her bones. Hild became patron saint of some fourteen medieval churches, eight of them in the North Riding of Yorkshire. St Hilda's College, Oxford, founded as St Hilda's Hall in 1893, is named after her.<br>
