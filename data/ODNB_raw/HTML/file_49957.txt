</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Salmon,  Cyril Barnet</span>, Baron Salmon  (1903&#150;1991), <span class="occ">judge</span>, was born Barnett Cyril Salmon on 28 December 1903 at 232 Finchley Road, Hampstead, London, the son of Montagu Salmon, tobacco merchant, and his wife, Marian Nina Trevor, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Abrahams. His father's family co-owned J. Lyons &amp; Co. Ltd, famous for its corner houses and tea shops until well after the Second World War. He was educated at Mill Hill School and Pembroke College, Cambridge, where he read law. Called to the bar by the Middle Temple in 1925, he was a pupil of Walter Monckton, who was already a prominent junior in distinguished chambers and &#145;a busy and prosperous man&#146;  (Lord Birkenhead, <span class="italic">Walter Monckton: the Life of Viscount Monckton of Brenchley</span>, 1969, 61). He then became a member of chambers at 5 Crown Office Row where the titular head was Robert Alderson Wright, Baron Wright, former master of the rolls and a legendary exponent of commercial law both as barrister and judge. He proceeded to build up his own practice covering a wide variety of (mostly civil) work, and by 1939 he was established as one of three leading common-law juniors in London, the others being Valentine Holmes, junior counsel to the treasury (the &#145;treasury devil&#146;), and Gilbert Paul. Colin Sleeman, who was Salmon's pupil and became a member of his chambers in July 1939, later said: &#145;Cyril was a wonderful pupil master who really took trouble to instruct his pupils&#146;  (private information).<br>
<br>The outbreak of the Second World War in 1939 had immediate consequences, for Salmon and his chambers, which were even more catastrophic than for most others in London. He enrolled in the army and was commissioned in the Royal Artillery in 1940. Other members of the chambers were likewise dispersed on military and RAF service, and soon afterwards the chambers building itself was bombed to the ground. In the later part of his military service, from 1943, Salmon was on the headquarters staff of the Eighth Army as a judge advocate. He ended the war with the rank of major. When he returned to practice in 1945 the chambers were housed at 3 Paper Buildings, the senior clerk had retired, and nothing of his pre-war junior practice remained. In these circumstances, he took the courageous decision to apply for silk, and was appointed KC in April 1945.<br>
<br>Salmon had married, on 25 July 1929, Rencie Vanderfelt (<i>d</i>. 1942), daughter of Sidney Gorton Vanderfelt; they had two children, Gai Rencie (<i>b</i>. 1933) and David Neville Cyril (<i>b</i>. 1935). Rencie Salmon was remembered as &#145;a very attractive and charming young woman and a very kind and generous hostess&#146;  (private information). The loss Salmon suffered from her untimely death was matched by the happiness brought to him by his second marriage, to Jean Beatrice (Jeannie) Morris, Lady Morris (1912&#150;1989), on 6 April 1946. She was the elder daughter of Lieutenant-Colonel David Edward Maitland-Makgill-Crichton, and the divorced wife of Michael William Morris, second Baron Morris, with whom she had had two daughters and twin sons. She was lively, intelligent, and attractive, and they were devoted to each other. They lived at 12 Wilton Street, London, a house which Salmon bought during the war years, and subsequently at 1 Melina Place, St John's Wood, London, and at the Old Drum, Sandwich, Kent. No reference to their home life during the 1950s and 1960s would be complete without a mention of Salmon's two long-haired dachshunds, Rudi and Mimi, who were his constant companions, on circuit as in London, and on some official as well as private occasions.<br>
<br>In the years after 1945 in the Temple, work was far from plentiful and the competition was intense. After a slow start, which perhaps was inevitable, Salmon acquired &#145;a large and varied practice&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Independent</span>, 14 Nov 1991), and during the 1950s became one of the acknowledged leaders of the bar. His practice included commercial cases, but he was too good a general advocate, and too much in demand, to become a specialist in that or any other field. His appointment as a judge of the High Court in 1957, with the accompanying knighthood, was presaged by the lord chancellor's invitation to travel the Wales and Chester circuit as commissioner of assize in 1955, which he did with considerable success. As a judge he achieved an even higher reputation than he had earned at the bar, both in the Queen's Bench Division and, from 1964, when he was appointed a lord justice of appeal and a privy councillor, in the Court of Appeal. It was said of him that &#145;the higher he went, the better he got&#146;  (private information).<br>
<br>As a judge Salmon was conspicuous both for his intellectual integrity and for his sometimes outspoken and fearless defence of liberal values and of the rights of the individual against intrusion by the state or by fellow citizens who failed to respect what became known as his, or her, human rights. At the same time, he retained the respect of more traditional common lawyers by recognizing the force of binding authority, even when it compelled a decision which was not necessarily in line with his personal sympathies for one or other of the parties in a particular case. At this time Lord Denning presided in the Court of Appeal as master of the rolls, and it was sometimes said, even by him, that the rules of precedent should give way, when justice demanded it, to the merits of the individual case as seen by the trial judge or appellate court. It is a mark of Salmon's intellectual distinction that he acquired a reputation which rivalled Denning's own for reconciling the justice of the case with the intellectual demands of the law. He received much favourable publicity, soon after his appointment, by reason of the tough prison sentences he imposed at the central criminal court in 1958 on the members of a gang of white youths who were convicted of attacking black victims during disturbances in the Notting Hill area of London, and his sentencing remarks were widely reported. They were credited with achieving their object of checking an incipient spread of racism at that time: &#145;Everyone, irrespective of the colour of their skin, is entitled to walk through our streets in peace, with their heads erect and free from fear. That is a right which these courts will always unfailingly uphold&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 9 Nov 1991). In 1966 he criticized the &#145;trial by television&#146; of Emil Savundra, who was accused (and later charged and convicted) of insurance frauds and malpractice on a major scale: such a person was entitled to a fair trial and the protection of the law. Aptly, in the same year, Salmon was appointed chairman of the royal commission which inquired into the workings of the <span class="roman">Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Act</span>, of 1921. The commission's report included recommendations which were designed to provide safeguards for witnesses and advocates appearing before tribunals of that kind. He also chaired a royal commission on standards of conduct in public life in 1974&#150;6, following his appointment to the House of Lords. He set out his views on the subject of individual liberty in a lecture which he delivered at a public meeting of Justice in July 1967 and in his Haldane lecture at Birkbeck College, London, entitled &#145;The law and individual liberty&#146; in December 1970.<br>
<br>Salmon's elevation to the House of Lords as Baron Salmon of Sandwich in 1972 was widely welcomed, and he remained an active and respected member of the appellate committee and of the judicial committee of the privy council until he retired in 1980. He began to suffer early symptoms of the ill health which increasingly marred the last decade of his life. Even during these later years, however, he spoke out against features of what became the <span class="roman">Police and Criminal Evidence Act</span>, of 1984, which he considered were unnecessarily restrictive of the legal rights of a criminal suspect in police custody. Characteristically, he supported in the House of Lords an early, unsuccessful, attempt to enact the European convention on human rights as part of British law.<br>
<br>Salmon was a person of unique talents and charm, &#145;widely liked and admired for the breadth of his knowledge, his courtesy, humour and patience, and also for his strength of will&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 9 Nov 1991). He was of medium height and always immaculately dressed, with a demeanour which was modest and quiet, to the point where sometimes he might appear almost languid to a casual onlooker. But no one could doubt for long either his intellectual energy or his personal distinction, and the word &#145;elegant&#146; perhaps best describes both his outward appearance and his manner, whether in conversation or as a speaker&#151;or as an advocate. Indeed, it was because he was able to deploy these personal gifts in all aspects of his professional work that he not only achieved outstanding success but was held in high personal regard by all who came into contact with him. He was loyal to the Middle Temple, where he was elected a bencher in 1953 and treasurer in 1972; to Cambridge, where he became an honorary fellow of Pembroke College in 1965, an honorary doctor of laws (LLD) in 1982, and a commissary of the university in 1979; and to his adopted home county of Kent. He was recorder of Gravesend from 1947 until his appointment to the High Court bench ten years later, and in 1978 the University of Kent made him an honorary DCL. A keen and skilled golfer, he was captain of Royal St George's, Sandwich, in 1972&#150;3 and a regular supporter of the Bar Golfing Society. He died on 7 November 1991 at Kenfield Hall Nursing Home, Petham, Canterbury, and was survived by the daughter and son of his first marriage, his wife Jeannie having predeceased him in 1989. He was commemorated at a memorial service in the Temple Church on 29 January 1992.<br>
