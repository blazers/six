<span class="headword">Cole,  Robert Benjamin Ageh  Wellesley</span>  (1907&#150;1995), <span class="occ">medical practitioner and author</span>, was born in Pownall Street, Kossoh Town, Freetown, Sierra Leone, on 11 March 1907, the eldest child in the family of three sons and two daughters of Wilfred Sydney Wellesley Ageh Cole (1880&#150;1943), a civil engineer, and the first African to be superintendent of the Freetown waterworks, and his wife, Elizabeth Beatrice Okrafor, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Smart. He was proudly alert to his krio (freed slave) origins. In this he was encouraged by his parents' relatives and the foster children who shared the family's home. He was educated at the Government Model School, Freetown, and the Cambridge Senior School, Freetown (a grammar school run by the Church Missionary Society). Their British curricula provided him with Latin and Greek; he became a chorister, a boy scout, and head boy at the latter school. Studies at Fourah Bay College from 1923 (he took a general arts degree and a London external honours degree in philosophy) led to his departure to England in September 1928, financed by a maternal uncle, Dr Alfred Smart, and his father's millionaire friend Peter J. C. Thomas. He studied medicine at Armstrong College, Newcastle, and was awarded the Tulloch scholarship and other prizes, and graduated MB BS in 1934 with first-class honours. He was refused entry into the college's officer training corps as he was not of European descent.<br>
<br>Wellesley Cole married his uncle's friend (and his landlady in Newcastle) Anna Isabel Law Brodie (daughter of William Brodie, draper) on 17 April 1932, and after a spell as a house surgeon at the Royal Victoria Infirmary he established his medical practice in Newcastle, the first black doctor in the city. He prospered and in 1936 purchased and modified a house to become his eight-roomed home and surgery in West Road, Denton Burn, which was his base until 1946. He took the degree of MD in 1943 (his thesis was on asthma) and he became a fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh and the first black fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons of England in 1944. In 1945 he was a committee member touring British west Africa for six months for the Colonial Office; his sister Irene Ighodaro (1916&#150;1995), later president of the Medical Association of Nigerian Women, and the first Sierra Leonean woman to qualify as a doctor, managed the practice during his absence.<br>
<br>He divorced in 1950 (Anna died in the 1970s), relocated his practice to Nottingham in 1950, and on 1 May that year married a Sierra Leonean nurse, Amy Manto Bondfield Hotobah-During (1930&#150;1996), daughter of Claude Dionysius Hotobah-During, barrister. They had two children in England, Patrice (born in Nottingham in 1952), and Robert (born in Nottingham in 1956). In 1962 Wellesley Cole moved to Nigeria as a consultant surgeon, and in the same role to Sierra Leone in 1964. He had three further children, Olushola Beatrice (born in Nigeria in 1963), Richard Claudius (born in Nigeria in 1964), and Ralph Lloyd Moses. Wellesley Cole's British nationality was forfeited on Sierra Leone's independence in 1961, as he was now classified as a citizen of that country (it was renewed, after a bureaucratic struggle, in 1981), but he lived in London from 1974.<br>
<br>Wellesley Cole's concern for Africa and African students had led him to participate in Newcastle's East and West Friendship Society and to help found the West African Society, whose journal <span class="italic">Africana</span> he edited. He served on a committee of the Fabian Society's colonial bureau (1943&#150;50) and several Colonial Office advisory groups as well as supporting the West African Students' Union and being the final president of the League of Coloured Peoples after the death of its founder, Harold Moody, in 1947. The league had by then run its course, its championship of Britain's black communities having passed on to other organizations, including Africa-centred bodies that involved Wellesley Cole.<br>
<br>Wellesley Cole's <span class="italic">Kossoh Town Boy</span> (1960), dedicated to his mother, became a school textbook in west Africa. Unable to find a publisher for his memoirs of his later years, <span class="italic">An Innocent in Britain</span>, he paid for them to be printed in 1988. By this time he was living in Sydenham, south-east London, with his third wife, Ajuma Josephine Elizabeth Wyse (whom he had married on 5 August 1980). He wrote two unpublished novels. He retained his strong Christian faith and beliefs that owed a great deal to the Victorian ideals that had survived in Freetown and its education system well into the twentieth century. He was a dignified man with the air of a polymath; in a discussion with an African-American who used &#145;black <i>diaspora</i>&#146; to refer to the movement of Africans to the New World, Wellesley Cole said he looked on Freetown as a &#145;black <i>epispora</i>&#146; (a gathering together of Africans). Asked how that word was spelled, Cole wrote it in Greek: a testimony to his education under African teachers seventy years before. He died of bronchopneumonia at Hither Green Hospital, Lewisham, on 31 October 1995. He was survived by his wife, Ajuma, and by four children, his son Robert having died in 1972, while a student at Epsom College.<br>
