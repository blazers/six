<span class="headword">Haggart,  Alastair Iain Macdonald</span>  (1915&#150;1998), <span class="occ">Scottish Episcopal bishop of Edinburgh</span>, was born at 30 Nairn Street, Glasgow, on 10 October 1915, the son of Alexander Macdonald Haggart, a timekeeper, and Janet Mackay. The family had moved from Fort William to Glasgow, where the young Haggart was brought up and educated at Hyndland primary and secondary schools. On leaving school he worked for some years at Burroughs Accounting Machines. Although his Christian life had begun as a member of the Free Church of Scotland, he made a conscious decision as a young man to become an Episcopalian. At the age of twenty-three he began training for the ministry at Coates Hall, the Episcopal theological college in Edinburgh. From there he gained an open exhibition to Hatfield College, Durham, where he graduated BA in 1941 and proceeded MA four years later. The University of Dundee made him an honorary LLD in 1970.<br>
<br>Haggart's clerical ministry initially was very much along traditional lines. He was ordained deacon in 1941 and priest in the following year. A three-year curacy at St Mary's Cathedral in Glasgow was followed by a similar period at St Mary's, Hendon, in London. At St Mary's, Glasgow, he married Margaret Agnes (Peggy) Trundle (1911/12&#150;1979), a shorthand typist, on 14 May 1945. They had two daughters. In 1948 he returned to Scotland to become precentor of St Ninian's Cathedral in Perth, where he remained until he went to his first incumbency, King's Park, Glasgow, in 1951. Eight years later he was appointed provost of St Paul's Cathedral in Dundee, where he exercised an effective and efficient pastoral ministry. His wide gifts were recognized in 1970, when he received a unanimous call from the college of bishops to accept appointment as principal of Edinburgh Theological College. Although he laid no claim to scholarship, he was an avid reader and regarded theological reading as an essential part of the priestly life. He kept very much in touch with the latest developments in theology. Under his leadership, the whole pattern of teaching at the college was reshaped. Formal links were established with New College, the theological faculty in the University of Edinburgh, as a consequence of which Episcopal church ordinands trained alongside candidates for the ministry of the Church of Scotland. He went on to establish a concordat with the advisory council for ministry in the Church of England, under which courses were integrated and became acceptable to all three parties.<br>
<br>Haggart was elected bishop of Edinburgh in 1975 at the age of sixty, when he described himself as &#145;an old man in a hurry&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>). Two years later he became primus. In that capacity he clearly recognized and responded to the need for radical reform of many of the structures of the church. He presided over the creation of a general synod which amalgamated the two bodies previously responsible for the governance of the church. The representative church council had been concerned with finance, while a provincial synod had dealt with doctrine. His eight years as primus saw a number of other significant changes. Among these were new patterns of ministry, a fresh approach to pastoral discipline in the matter of the marriage of divorced persons, and the development and introduction of new liturgies.<br>
<br>A committed ecumenist, Haggart soon made his mark in the British Council of Churches. As chairman of the division of ecumenical affairs he was one of those responsible for the change to new ecumenical structures in Britain in which the Roman Catholic church could be full participants. He drafted the introduction to the Swanwick declaration when the churches agreed to ratify the &#145;Not Strangers but Pilgrims&#146; process. It was later a source of disappointment to him that church life in Britain had failed to sustain that early commitment. He made his presence and influence felt unmistakably in the Anglican consultative council, where he served for a time as vice-chairman. During the pope's visit to Canterbury in 1982 Haggart initiated a dialogue for the discussion of inter-faith marriages.<br>
<br>In 1983 Haggart travelled to Johannesburg as one of the Anglican observers at the trial of Archbishop Desmond Tutu and others. His first wife having died in 1979, on 3 April 1983 he married chief nursing officer Mary Elizabeth Scholes (<i>b</i>. 1924). He retired as primus in 1985, but returned to the Anglican stage to act as chaplain to the 1988 Lambeth conference. A lifelong pacifist, he was a member of the Peace Pledge Union and a conscientious objector during the Second World War. More controversially, perhaps, he became an office-bearer in the Voluntary Euthanasia Society of Scotland. Perhaps the most striking impressions made by Haggart on first acquaintance were the admonitory forefinger, which was frequently raised in conversation, and his very distinctive Scottish accent, neither highland nor Lallans. Both combined made for a memorable and effective means of communication. Haggart died on 11 January 1998 in Astley Ainslie Hospital, Edinburgh. His funeral was held on 17 January at St Mary's Cathedral, Edinburgh. His second wife survived him.<br>
