<span class="headword">Rathbone,  William</span>  (1757&#150;1809), <span class="occ">merchant and philanthropist</span>, the eldest son of William Rathbone (1726&#150;1789) and his first wife, Rachel Rutter, was born at Liverpool. The family, originally sawyers from Gawsworth, Cheshire, migrated to Liverpool before 1730 to become timber merchants and ultimately shipbuilders and shipowners. By 1868 four generations of the family had been engaged in trade, having fulfilled a critical role in the commercial expansion of Liverpool as a port city. The vehicle for their entrepreneurial activities was the firm of William Rathbone &amp; Sons, founded in Liverpool in 1746. During the succeeding fifty years the firm was to gain a notable place in the Liverpool merchant community as a result of its external trading connections with Europe, North America, and the West Indies. In 1784 it imported the first consignment (eight bales and three barrels) of raw cotton to be grown in the United States. Previously, virtually all cotton imports had come from the West Indies, and the new consignment was seized at the custom house as an evasion of the navigation laws on the grounds that cotton was not grown in North America. The importation of raw cotton proved to be a lucrative business both for the Rathbones and other Liverpool merchants in the heyday of expansion of the Lancashire cotton industry before 1850. Their links with North America remained dominant, although they maintained a diversity of trading interests. In addition to raw cotton, turpentine, tar, ashes, flour, and tobacco were imported from the USA, hides from South America, wool from Australia, mahogany and sugar from the West Indies, and oats, barley, and butter from Ireland.<br>
<br>Rathbone was a birthright member of the Society of Friends and received a Quaker education. Well read in the classics, eloquent and energetic, he complemented his business interests with strong adherence to public causes of a liberal nature, both local and national. On 17 August 1786 he married Hannah Mary (<i>d</i>. 1839), the only daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/23433/', "Richard Reynolds (1735&#150;1816)")</script>; they had four sons and one daughter.<br>
<br>In 1792 Rathbone was prominent in efforts to avert the war with France, and in that year, and again in 1809, led a campaign against the monopoly of the East India Company. He also advocated freedom of trade with the United States and gave evidence before parliament on that subject. Equally controversially, he participated in the early anti-slavery movement and lent powerful support to his fellow Liverpudlian William Roscoe in calling for the abolition of the slave trade. In view of Liverpool's leading role in the trade, it was to Rathbone's credit that he was prepared to endure the censure of his fellow merchants.<br>
<br>In religious terms Rathbone was an early critic of some fundamental aspects of Quaker discipline. He objected especially to the disownment of Friends for mixed marriages and to the voluntary payment of tithes. He also argued in favour of wider latitude of behaviour in relation to Quaker doctrinal principles. Thus in 1792 he became a subscriber to the Unitarian Book Society of London, an action which produced a remonstrance (31 August 1793) from an Irish Friend, Job Scott. In the later 1790s Rathbone became embroiled in a doctrinal dispute emanating from Irish Friends, focusing on the infallibility of scripture. Abraham Shackleton took the side of heterodoxy, and the emergent controversy was fomented by Hannah Barnard (<i>d</i>. 1828) from New York. The heterodox party was then labelled the &#145;Barnard schism&#146;. On 30 March 1804 Rathbone published a <span class="italic">Narrative</span> of the schism, &#145;correct in regard to documentary facts&#146;, for which action he was disowned by the Hardshaw (St Helens) monthly meeting at Manchester on 28 February 1805, on the grounds that he had expressed opinions contrary to Friends' doctrine on the immediate teaching of Christ and to the reverence due to the scriptures. Rathbone did not appeal against the decision, nor did he join any other religious body. He did, however, worship occasionally with the Unitarian congregation presided over by Robert Lewin at Benn's Garden, Liverpool. His close associate William Roscoe also attended the church.<br>
<br>Rathbone died at his residence, Greenbank, near Liverpool, on 11 February 1809 and was interred at the Quaker burial-ground in Liverpool. His commercial interests were inherited by his eldest son, also called <a name="cosubject_23161"></a><span class="headword">William Rathbone</span>  (1787&#150;1868)<span class="occ"></span>, who inherited his father's philanthropic spirit in full measure and became eminent in Liverpool for his beneficence and altruism. Born in Liverpool on 17 June 1787, he was educated at a school in Hackney, Middlesex, under Thomas Belsham until 1803, when he proceeded to Oxford for private tuition by Theophilus Houlbroke. A unitarian by religious conviction, he maintained his Quaker connections until his marriage in 1812 to Elizabeth, the eldest child of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/59911/', "Samuel Greg")</script> and the sister of Robert Hyde Greg, Samuel Greg, and William Rathbone Greg. For marrying out of the Society of Friends he was disowned, but was later reinstated. He withdrew finally from the society in 1829.<br>
<br>Rathbone achieved public recognition in the 1820s as an advocate of Roman Catholic emancipation. Coincidentally he developed an interest in parliamentary and municipal reform. On 13 January 1836 a public presentation was made to him in recognition of his services in these respects, an event which led to his appointment as mayor of Liverpool the following year. As a local politician he took a keen interest in educational provision and was instrumental in securing the advantages of the corporation schools on terms satisfactory to all denominations. In 1844 he presided at a meeting held in Liverpool to vindicate the actions of the Irish Roman Catholic lawyer Daniel O'Connell in favour of the abolition of the Anglo-Irish union inaugurated in 1801. Rathbone's interest in Irish affairs was further indicated in 1846&#150;7, when he was placed in sole charge of the fund (<i>c</i>.&pound;70,000 to &pound;80,000) contributed by the New England states for the relief of suffering consequent on the Irish famine. In Quaker terms he was &#145;worldly&#146; and, aside from his highly visible public career, possessed a taste for art.<br>
<br>Rathbone died at Greenbank on 1 February 1868 after an operation for calculus, and was buried in the borough cemetery. Joseph Blanco White had been his guest during his last days. A mural monument to his memory was placed in Renshaw Street Chapel, and a public statue was erected in Sefton Park, Liverpool. His wife, Elizabeth, died on 24 October 1882, aged ninety-two. Their eldest child, Elizabeth, married John Paget, a magistrate of London, in 1839, while their second daughter, Hannah Mary (1816&#150;1872), married John Hamilton Thom on 2 January 1838. Their eldest son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35679/', "William Rathbone (1819&#150;1902)")</script>, was at one time MP for North Caernarvonshire.<br>
