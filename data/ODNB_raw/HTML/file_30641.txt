</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Bateson,  William</span>  (1861&#150;1926), <span class="occ">biologist</span>, was born on 8 August 1861 in St Hilda's Terrace, Ruswarp, near Whitby, Yorkshire, the second of six children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1685/', "William Henry Bateson (1812&#150;1881)")</script>, master of St John's College, Cambridge, and his wife, Anna Aikin (1829&#150;1918), daughter of James Aikin (1792&#150;1878), Liverpool shipping merchant. As the reformist master of St John's College, William Henry Bateson had achieved a reputation both in national educational circles and more especially in the politics of Cambridge University. There, freed from the rule of celibacy by his promotion from fellow to master, he had married the beautiful and spirited Anna Aikin, fond of the arts and a strong advocate for the rights of women.<br>
<br>Both families owed their financial success to the previous generation of self-made vigorous men (Bateson's paternal grandfather, Richard Bateson (<i>b</i>. 1770), was a successful Liverpool cotton merchant). Their traditions were alike, Liberal, and the marriage of Bateson's parents in 1858 strengthened this political stance and perpetuated feminist aspirations. In the span of eight years William, his four sisters, and his brother Edward were born. Surrounded by these sisters William enjoyed much attention. Naturally he was affected by their feminist persuasion, and he was to take pride in the academic successes of his sisters Anna and Mary at Newnham College, Cambridge. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30640/', "Mary Bateson (1865&#150;1906)")</script>, went on to become a widely respected medievalist. Another sister, Margaret [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/56236/', "Heitland, Margaret")</script>] became a journalist and social activist.<h2>
<a name="Educationearlyresearchandmarriage"></a>Education, early research, and marriage</h2>William Bateson was a disappointment at school at Rugby (1875&#150;9), but he redeemed the family reputation by winning a first in the natural sciences tripos at Cambridge, part one in 1882 and part two in 1883. There, at his father's college and as a member of the circle of enthusiasts who gathered around the zoologists Francis Maitland Balfour and Adam Sedgwick, Bateson imbibed the heady wine of comparative embryology&#151;the window through which to glimpse the evolutionary ancestry of animal species. This study of the lines of descent known as phylogeny was founded on the assumption that the embryo recapitulates in its development the evolutionary history of the species. Bateson's first success in research was his study of the acorn worm, <i>Balanoglossus</i>, carried out in the recapitulationist tradition. The fruit of two summers spent in Hampton, Virginia, under the zoologist W. K. Brooks, supported by funds from the Royal Society, was the first accurate account of the worm's embryology and anatomy. Bateson claimed it as an example of a primitive chordate, and thus an indicator of the line of descent of the vertebrates from the invertebrates. The implications of this research and the influence of Brooks led Bateson to make a radical shift, turning from embryology to the study of variation, first in the wild and in museum collections and subsequently in the experimental tradition of hybridization. This took him in 1886 to the salt lakes of the Russian steppes and in 1887 to the brackish water of Egypt before he settled down in Cambridge to make a systematic collection of examples of variation in the animal kingdom. The resulting book, <span class="italic">Materials for the Study of Variation</span> (1894), attacked the recapitulationist research tradition of the British evolutionists but failed to impress them. Instead it increased its author's growing alienation from those who held power in Cambridge zoology. Consequently Bateson, who was especially attached to Cambridge, continued on college support&#151;he was elected a fellow of St John's College in 1885 on the strength of his <i>Balanoglossus</i> work. To the stipend of his college fellowship he was able to add (in 1892) that of college steward in charge of the wine cellar, kitchen garden, and kitchens. These two sources constituted his salary for the next fifteen years. Support for his research came from the Balfour studentship in 1887 and a succession of annual grants (from 1900 to 1906) from the Royal Society, to which he had been elected fellow in 1894.<br>
<br>In 1889 Bateson met (Caroline) Beatrice Durham (1870?&#150;1941), the daughter of a senior surgeon at Guy's Hospital, Arthur Edward Durham (1834&#150;1895). Their subsequent engagement was broken off and all correspondence intercepted due to disapproval of Bateson by Beatrice's mother. Seven years later, Beatrice's parents having died, they renewed their acquaintance and in 1896 they married. Of their three sons John was killed in the First World War in 1918, Martin committed suicide in 1922, but <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/39398/', "Gregory Bateson (1904&#150;1980)")</script> had a distinguished career in social anthropology and psychology. The marriage thus had its deep sadnesses&#151;like that of many others whose sons were lost in the war&#151;but it was a good partnership. Bateson was aggressive, demanding, and at times domineering, but enthusiastic and playful. He would mock, tease, and humiliate Beatrice. She was reserved and unlike her formidable sisters she tended to belittle herself; her strength was her devotion to Bateson. Until 1903 she performed most of the menial tasks associated with her husband's experiments. After his death she gathered together his correspondence and published extracts in her 160-page memoir alongside a collection of his public lectures in <span class="italic">William Bateson, F.R.S., Naturalist: his Essays and Addresses</span> (1928). The latter displays Bateson's oratorical powers and underlines his popularity as a lecturer. Published separately as <span class="italic">Problems of Genetics</span> (1913) were his Silliman lectures of 1907. The memoir concentrates on the Cambridge years and makes only brief references to her husband's later career at the John Innes Horticultural Institute of which he became the architect and first director in 1910. These were years of dedication, frustration, and a feeling of exile from Cambridge, added to which came the sad events of the First World War. Peace established, leadership in genetics passed from England to the United States of America where T. H. Morgan was building a reputation with the chromosome theory of heredity, a theory opposed by Bateson until 1921.<h2>
<a name="Discontinuityinevolution"></a>Discontinuity in evolution</h2>There were four concerns that prompted Bateson to question the Darwinian orthodoxy of continuity&#151;the view that evolution results from the cumulative action of natural selection upon slight variations in such fashion that over a long period of time progeny diverge significantly from their originating species. His first concern was his adherence to the belief that specific differences are real, not mere products of the taxonomist, in short that there are natural kinds among living organisms. Species were for Bateson more than mere populations with certain frequencies of characters. Second, the view of variation as continuous relied heavily on the principle of utility. Slight variations were preserved and accumulated only because each one which was preserved offered its possessor some advantage in the struggle for life. Despite his family background in liberal politics and trade, he was vehemently opposed to arguments from utility. Indeed, he seems to have turned against the commercial world to which both his and his wife's family owed the advantages they enjoyed. By a process of gentrification he came to identify with the aims and to admire the institutions of the academic &eacute;lite. Thus he tried to discourage his sister Anna from entering the trade of market gardening. At the same time he opposed positive eugenics because he rejected the simplistic utilitarian basis upon which decisions would be made regarding who should breed with whom. Third, he came increasingly to admire those sciences that had achieved reliable knowledge based on the experimental method, where predictions could be tested and causal chains established. Those most relevant to biology, he judged, were chemistry and physiology. Thus he emphasized the aim of his genetic research as the study of the physiology of heredity. This alignment suggested the need for experiment rather than the mere descriptions and phylogenetic speculations of the morphological tradition, and it invited the search for discontinuities in biology analogous to those in chemistry that mark the chemical elements.<br>
<br>The fourth source of Bateson's changed view was the influence of the Johns Hopkins professor, W. K. Brooks. When Bateson came to work with him in 1883 Brooks was just finishing his book <span class="italic">The Law of Heredity: a Study of the Cause of Variation, and the Origin of Living Organisms</span> (1883), in which he stressed the inadequacy of natural selection acting on purely fortuitous small variations, the suggestion to explore the nature of variation as a phenomenon of the whole organism, and the need for a large programme of experimental hybridization. Brooks's rhetorical, aphoristic style of speech and writing appealed to the 22-year-old Cambridge student, fresh from his graduation. Nearly forty years later Bateson recalled that the &#145;notion on which [Brooks] used to expiate, that there was a special physiology of heredity capable of independent study, came as a new idea&#146;  (cited in Bateson, <span class="italic">William Bateson</span>, 390).<br>
<br>Bateson's attention to variation was first aroused by his study of <i>Balanoglossus</i>. It concerned the origin of the vertebrates: had they derived from a worm-like creature with segmentation and bilateral symmetry, a flatworm lacking segmentation, or a jellyfish-like radially symmetrical progenitor? All three choices presented problems involving major organizational features. Bateson suggested that some of these&#151;such as the presence or extent of segmentation and the type of symmetry&#151;did occur spontaneously in evolution and thus could overcome these problems. Thus <i>Balanoglossus</i>, with scarcely any evidence of segmentation, could have derived from a radially symmetrical progenitor. This proposal had the advantage that it obviated the need for a radical reorganization of the major organs, such as would be needed for a worm-like progenitor. He found such variations in symmetry, and in the number of parts, from the study of the symmetry changes in plants and from data he collected on the multiplication of like parts in animals.<br>
<br>Bateson's first step had been to probe the relation between organisms and environment where environmental change was under way in the wild. Abandoning embryology he journeyed to the salt lakes of the steppes looking for changes in molluscs that showed adaptation to the increasing salt content of these waters. Both in Russia and in Egypt he did not find a continuity of variation in the molluscs paralleling the continuity of change in the environment. When he had returned to Cambridge he set about accumulating data on variation using as his model the approach Charles Darwin used in the material for his great work <span class="italic">The Variation of Animals and Plants under Domestication</span> (1868). Like Darwin, Bateson began accumulating a mountain of empirical evidence for variation, but unlike the former he concentrated on monstrosities, sports of nature, objects usually assigned to the subject of teratology. They spoke to him of a discontinuous form of variation which came from within the organism&#151;variations ready made which natural selection had either to reject or accept. Hence to answer the question &#145;What is the origin of species?&#146; Bateson turned to these sports of nature. They were of two kinds: those involving the reproduction of parts and changes of symmetry he termed meristic and those in which there was a qualitative change as in the presence or absence of a chemical substance (albino forms) which he called substantive.<h2>
<a name="Experimentalhybridization"></a>Experimental hybridization</h2>Bateson's hybridization experiments date from 1895. They were aimed at demonstrating that discontinuous variations are not swamped by breeding with the normal type. At the Royal Horticultural Society's first international conference on plant hybridization held in London in 1899 both he and the Dutch botanist Huge De Vries described their experiments without drawing any Mendelian-like conclusions. The following spring Bateson read a paper by De Vries (the first paper in the series marking the rediscovery of Mendel's law) as he travelled to London to address the society. This paper contained no reference to the Moravian monk Gregor Mendel, whose account of what became known as the Mendelian theory had been published in 1866. Subsequent rediscovery papers gave credit to Mendel, and Bateson promptly turned to Mendel's text &#145;Versuche &uuml;ber Pflanzenhybriden&#146; and recognized its significance. It was the key he needed. It gave a causal explanation for the production of variation which was independent of the environment; it showed how hereditary differences were separated from hybrid mixture because of the purity of the germ cells. The theory offered an algorithm with which to predict the outcome of experiments in crossing. Eagerly he persuaded the society to have the paper translated into English and published in its <span class="italic">Journal</span>. Aided by his contacts in the Royal Horticultural Society and his friends in the Royal Society, Bateson gained support for the programme of Mendelian experiments upon which he now embarked.<br>
<br>In Cambridge University he continued the outsider to the biological community. Apart from serving as deputy to the ageing zoology professor and expert ornithologist, Alfred Newton, he received no university teaching appointment until the readership of zoology in the winter of 1907&#150;8. Shortly thereafter he was offered the directorship of the new John Innes Horticultural Institute at Merton, close to London. The institution of the first chair of genetics in Britain at Cambridge University in 1912 came too late for him. By that time he had become deeply involved in the establishment of what was to become and has remained a research centre for genetics, the John Innes.<br>
<br>Public opposition to the new experimental tradition came not from Cambridge but from the school of biometricians led by the statistician Karl Pearson and Bateson's former close friend at Cambridge W. F. R. Weldon. Weldon had begun to fall out with Bateson in 1890 following the latter's attacks on orthodox Darwinism. Then, too, they were rivals for academic appointments, and when Bateson joined the Royal Society's evolution committee he proceeded to take it over and soon after to appropriate its funds, which hitherto had supported Weldon's biometric research. The ensuing controversy between biometricians and Mendelians is notorious. Bateson heaped all the scorn and sarcasm he could muster on his opponents, who continued to support the ancestral theory of inheritance proposed by Francis Galton. At first Bateson allowed that heredity might be of two kinds&#151;ancestral for continuously varying characters but Mendelian for discontinuously varying ones. Later he inferred that the ancestral theory was just a special case of the fundamental theory, which was Mendelian. Weldon, on the other hand, attacked the Mendelian theory, but when he became convinced that it should have a place he modified it in order to accommodate it within the ancestral theory which he considered fundamental.<h2>
<a name="Genetics"></a>Genetics</h2>Bateson was not just Mendel's apostle to the English speaking world. Nor was he merely &#145;defender of the faith&#146;. His research with the devoted circle of supporters around him in Cambridge led to the discovery of what he called partial gametic coupling (since renamed linkage), of the interactions known as epistasis and hypostasis between hereditary determinants, of the Mendelian character of sex limited inheritance differences, and of Mendelian heredity in man. He also made a major contribution to the terminology of genetics&#151;allelomorph (now allele), homozygote, heterozygote, <i>F</i><sub>1</sub>, <i>F</i><sub>2</sub>, <i>F</i><sub>3</sub> generation&#151;and last but not least he coined the word genetics, defining it as<blockquote>the elucidation of the phenomena of heredity and variation: in other words, to the physiology of descent, with implied bearings on the theoretical problems of the evolutionist and systematist, and applications to the practical problems of breeders, whether of animals or plants. (W. Bateson, &#145;The progress of genetic research&#146;, <span class="italic">Report of the Third International Conference 1906 on Genetics</span>, 1907, 91)</blockquote>This passage occurs in his inaugural address to the third international conference on hybridization and plant breeding, which like the first of 1899 was held in London under the auspices of the Royal Horticultural Society.<br>
<br>Bateson's persistent efforts to attract funding for establishing genetic research on a long-term basis at Cambridge eventually led to the endowment of the first chair in the subject. Bateson's vitriolic attack on the critics of Mendelism in his <span class="italic">Mendel's Principles of Heredity: a Defence</span> (1902) was softened in the much expanded major text <span class="italic">Mendel's Principles of Heredity</span> (1909), a work which quickly became the classic of the first phase of genetics. His campaign for the subject also played a part in the decision of the Lloyd George administration to include plant and animal breeding among the collection of research institutes to be established under the <span class="roman">Development Act</span> of 1909. The John Innes Horticultural Institute was the result of a private benefaction which in Bateson's hands became the instrument for the continuation of most of his Cambridge research. Of the other lines of work which he instituted the most successful was the study of fruit. The resulting knowledge of the compatibility and incompatibility among varieties of apples, pears, cherries, and plums was perhaps the most valuable achievement of Bateson's years at the John Innes.<br>
<br>Bateson is a striking example of the trend from descriptive to experimental tradition in biology which took place about the beginning of the twentieth century. Embryology had already established an experimental tradition in Germany. But the study of heredity had been largely in terms of pedigrees. The growing band of cytologists had also begun to speculate about heredity, but they did not produce a successful theory, and Bateson was particularly scornful of the leading cytological theory&#151;that of August Weismann. Nor was he attracted to statistical theories like those of the biometricians. They were actuarial: giving statements of probability. Was it not better, opined Bateson, to determine by experiment the hereditary constitution of organisms? The historiography of the controversy between Mendelians and biometricians which used to portray the former as right and the latter as wrong has been superseded by a more even-handed treatment. The use of this episode as a case history for the sociology of knowledge approach has led to a fruitful debate from which it is clear that there were deep-seated differences between the two sides not of a kind easily settled by experimental investigation. Inevitably the resolution of the controversy was the work not of the leaders but of their successors. Meanwhile Bateson had risen to a position of world fame despite his sceptical attitude to Darwinian evolution. In 1922 he accepted the request to become a trustee of the British Museum, but he declined the offer of a knighthood. The Royal Society had honoured him twice, with the Darwinian medal in 1904 and the Royal medal in 1920. In 1910 he received an honorary DSc from Sheffield University, and St John's College made him an honorary fellow.<br>
<br>Bateson remained director of the John Innes Horticultural Institute until his death from heart failure at his home, Manor House, Watery Lane, Merton, Surrey, on 8 February 1926. He was cremated at Golders Green four days later. He was survived by his wife.<br>
