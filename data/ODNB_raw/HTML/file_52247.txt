<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Tanner, Dame  Emmeline Mary</span>  (1876&#150;1955), <span class="occ">headmistress and educational reformer</span>, was born on 28 December 1876 at 1 Locksbrook Place, Weston, Bath, the eldest of the seven children of Samuel Thomas Tanner JP (1849&#150;1929), coal merchant, and his wife, Jeanetta Jane, daughter of George Fry of Lynton and his second wife. She was born into a lower-middle-class family, and her parents valued education as a necessary means to the employment of their children. Financial pressures, however, meant that Emmeline's schooling was very limited: from a small private establishment she went on, at the age of thirteen, to become a student teacher, then taught in private schools in Birmingham and Southampton before taking up an appointment in 1897 at the Ladies' College, Halifax, where she gained a valuable social education and training. From an early age she had had an ambition to succeed, and she continued her studies while working, taking the examinations of the College of Preceptors when thirteen and the Cambridge senior locals at fifteen. Unable to attend university as an internal student, she studied for an external degree of the University of London, graduating with first-class honours in history in 1904. Despite these inauspicious beginnings, she was appointed as history mistress to Sherborne School for Girls from the beginning of 1905. While there she wrote her only book (1908), a widely used text on the Renaissance and the Reformation.<br>
<br>Emmeline Tanner's five years at Sherborne formed the introduction to what was to become a remarkable career. In 1910 she became the first headmistress of the new Nuneaton high school. There she was fortunate to have the encouragement and practical assistance of the county director of education, Bolton King, whose advice she valued throughout her life. She stayed there for ten years before moving to Bedford high school, a school desperately needing the change and reform that she was able to bring. In 1924 she reluctantly moved to Roedean, having been determinedly headhunted by Penelope Lawrence. She proved an able successor to the Lawrence sisters, and remained at Roedean for the rest of her teaching career.<br>
<br>Tall, erect, dignified, neatly and simply dressed, with blue eyes behind pince-nez, Emmeline Tanner had a compelling physical presence. Magnanimous and caring, with a sense of humour and fun, she was said to be always smiling. She had a lasting memory for names, and a phenomenal grasp of detail, which was the root of her outstanding administrative ability. She put her stamp on all her schools, and earned a lifelong love and respect from both pupils and staff. By the 1920s her many gifts increasingly meant that she was holding office in regional and national organizations. She served on the education committees at Nuneaton, Bedford, and Brighton. A member for nearly thirty years of the executive committee of the Association of Headmistresses, she became first chair of committee (1923&#150;5) and later president (1937&#150;9), proving herself an able negotiator and policymaker; she then became chair of the Joint Committee of Four Secondary Associations (1940&#150;42). In 1920 she was invited to become one of four women members of the consultative committee of the Board of Education, and in 1924 was reappointed for another six years. She was a signatory to several reports, notably the Hadow report of 1926. By the 1930s she was recognized as the leading representative and spokeswoman for girls' education, and was regularly called upon regarding educational matters. A member of the Board of Education (Fleming) committee on public schools from 1942 to 1944, she helped draft new educational policy and played an important role in the discussions leading up to the 1944 <span class="roman">Education Act</span>. Unlike many of her fellow headmistresses in this period, Emmeline had not only national interests but was actively involved in international causes. A dedicated supporter of the League of Nations, she served on many committees with international purposes, and listed travel as her sole recreation in <span class="italic">Who's Who</span>. She was not afraid to become involved in politics&#151;as an independent Liberal&#151;nor to speak on political platforms. Though brought up as a member of the Swedenborgians, she became a member of the Church of England in 1913.<br>
<br>One major plank of Emmeline Tanner's educational philosophy, mirroring her own experience, was that no one should be held back from education for want of money, and she strove to make this part of her practice and policy making. Her hope was to enable girls to develop their differing gifts through a varied curriculum which allowed for flexibility. Her philosophy, however, extended beyond classroom and curriculum to the individual child's relationship with the whole world outside: girls should learn to be members of a community and gain a sense of the corporate life, enabling them better to play their part in the world outside school. She believed in training her girls for useful work in the world, in the professions and other careers, including motherhood, and she encouraged them to become responsible citizens, using their votes in both local and national elections.<br>
<br>Emmeline Tanner was a woman of courage, wisdom, and integrity, a great headmistress, an outstanding teacher and administrator, and an influential committee member. At a normal retirement age she was demonstrating her planning genius in the move of Roedean to Keswick at the beginning of the Second World War. She was not allowed to retire until 1947, when she was seventy-two. In that year she was created DBE for services to education and given an honorary MA from the University of London. Unwilling to face settling down, she set off for South Africa and India; on her return, in 1950 and 1952, she took on acting headships at Southwold and Harrogate respectively. After a long journey to southern Africa she moved at last into her retirement home in December 1954. Three weeks later she had a fall, which led to her death. She died on 7 January 1955 in Savernake Hospital, Marlborough, and was cremated at Oxford on 13 January. A memorial service at St Martin-in-the-Fields, London, on 24 January was attended by a large congregation.<br>
