<span class="headword">Jeffreys,  John</span>  (<em>c.</em>1614&#150;1688), <span class="occ">merchant</span>, was the third of six sons of Edward Jeffreys (<i>d</i>. 1642) of Llywel, Brecknockshire, a minor country gentleman of an ancient if decayed family. (The merchant is often confused with the unrelated Colonel John Jeffreys (1623&#150;1689), of The Priory, Brecon, MP, brother of Herbert Jeffreys, lieutenant-governor of Virginia.) As a younger son in a family of limited resources, he was in 1632 placed apprentice with a merchant member of the London Grocers' Company. From the beginning of his independent activity, he devoted his attention primarily to the Virginia tobacco trade, then just beginning to be of commercial importance. In the 1630s and 1640s the London customs records show him importing modest amounts of tobacco from Virginia. His emergence as a leader in the trade came in the dynamic 1650s following the adoption of the <span class="roman">Navigation Act</span> and the reconquest of royalist Virginia by a parliamentary fleet. (Though a royalist by sentiment, he was not above contracting to carry Cromwell's Irish prisoners to Virginia.) From at least the 1650s, he conducted his business in partnership with Thomas Colclough (1619&#150;1680) from a Staffordshire gentry family. By 1660&#150;61 Jeffreys was sufficiently prominent to be named (as a representative of the Chesapeake trade) a member of a panel of merchants advising the lords of a committee of council on foreign trade. His tobacco-import business was great enough for him to lose a reported &pound;20,000 in leaf in the great fire of 1666. Thereafter, until his death in 1688, his firm was indisputably the leading importer of tobacco in London and in the country. As tobacco was the major commodity returned from North America, this made it the leading English merchant house trading to the continental colonies.<br>
<br>Jeffreys also developed other trades of significant volume, if less important to him than tobacco. The London port book for 1686 shows him importing wine and raisins from Spain and Madeira, as well as iron and hemp from the Baltic (probably in return for tobacco) and linen from Hamburg. The last was probably intended for re-export to North America or the West Indies, whence he had also developed a significant import trade in sugar and logwood.<br>
<br>As early as the 1650s, Jeffreys and Colclough maintained a &#145;principal factor&#146; in Virginia, who supervised the selling and buying of lesser factors acting on commission. This basic trade was supplemented by a commission (or consignment) trade with local merchants, merchant planters, and a few greater planters in the tobacco colonies. The company was the London correspondent of governor Lord Howard of Effingham and of leading planter or merchant planter families such as the Chicheleys, Lees, Ludwells, and Wormeleys. Jeffreys was also active in the tobacco re-export trades. In the 1670s and 1680s, he and Alderman Jacob Lucie of London, an Eastland merchant, had contracts to supply tobacco to the monopolist Royal Tobacco Company of Sweden. These contracts involved them in frequent recourse to English ministers for help in obtaining payment from the monopoly company and from Andre Onkell, their factor in Stockholm. They were helped in getting such assistance not only by the fact that both were good tories, but also in part because Jeffreys was very close to his fellow Welshman, the secretary of state, Sir Leoline Jenkins, who admitted, &#145;I have subsisted 4 or 5 years in my Employment abroad by the Credit he [Jeffreys] gave me.&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1680&#150;81</i>, 52). Also relevant for Jeffreys's American trades was his election in the 1670s as &#145;assistant&#146; (director) of the slave-trading Royal African Company. In the 1680s his collaborator Lucie was both an assistant and deputy governor of this company, while Jeffreys's nephews were to continue this participation in the 1690s. Since the Royal African Company was reluctant to ship slaves to Virginia on its own account, the Jeffreys and their associates contracted in the 1670s and 1680s to buy from the company whole shiploads of slaves delivered by it in Virginia.<br>
<br>Jeffreys's status in the London trading world was acknowledged by his election as master of the Grocers' Company in 1661. The year before, he had been elected alderman for Bread Street ward but paid &pound;820 to be permitted to resign immediately. His family associations were all ultra-royalist and later tory but he may have judged a non-political stance commercially necessary. Tobacco was a highly taxed commodity and all who dealt in it had to be on civil terms with those in authority. Jeffreys on occasion spoke for the whole trade as well as for his private concerns. In 1685, for example, he led a delegation of the London Chesapeake trade testifying before the House of Commons (in committee of the whole) against the proposed new tobacco impost. Even so, in his old age Jeffreys accepted inclusion in the London lieutenancy commission of 1685. His closest competitor in his last years, Micaiah Perry, also avoided public office except for the lieutenancy.<br>
<br>When Thomas Colclough died in 1680, Jeffreys replaced him as partner with his own nephew <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/49858/', "Jeffrey Jeffreys")</script>, son of his brother Walter (or Watkin) of Llywel. Like most successful merchants of his day, Alderman John Jeffreys accumulated considerable real estate both in his native county and in England, particularly in Gloucestershire and in and around London&#151;including the manor of Kentish Town. He was unmarried and following his death at Llywel on 5 November 1688 (the day William III landed in England), his will transferred most of his real estate in Brecknockshire to Lewis, son of his brother Thomas, and to Edward and Evan, the elder two sons of his brother Walter. The other half of his London firm was left to John, Walter's youngest son. His real estate in England went to his nephews Jeffrey and John, who were continuing his London business. A sister and other relatives were also remembered but the most interesting bequests were &pound;2000 to Lord Chancellor Jeffreys (who was no relation), and another &pound;2000 to his lordship's eldest son, John, the alderman's godson. Thus John Jeffreys's will suggests much about both his wealth and his adherence to his family's tory loyalties.<br>
