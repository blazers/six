<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Craigie <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Richards]</span>,  Pearl</span> <span class="st"> [<em>pseud. </em>John Oliver Hobbes]</span>  (1867&#150;1906), <span class="occ">novelist and playwright</span>, was born on 3 November 1867 at Chelsea, Massachusetts, the first of the five children of John Morgan Richards, merchant (1840/41&#150;1918), and Laura Hortense, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Arnold (1846&#150;1914). Both parents were from a long line of upper middle-class protestant Americans. Immediately after Pearl's birth her father settled in London in the patent medicine business, and from then on, her family resided there, spending summers in the Isle of Wight and frequently visiting the United States and travelling in Britain and Europe. Richards's business, which soon included American cigarettes, made him a millionaire. Pearl's parents were lively, hospitable, and close to their children&#151;Laura religious, artistic, socially ambitious, and eccentric, John almost as passionately devoted to the theatre and journalism as to business. (He purchased <span class="italic">The Academy</span> in 1896 and in 1902 the London <span class="italic">Times</span> literature section, which he incorporated into <span class="italic">The Academy</span>.) Pearl and her siblings were always included in the Richardses' varied and interesting social circle.<br>
<br>A pretty, dark-haired, brown-eyed child, vivacious and precocious, Pearl was educated intermittently in a few day and boarding-schools, and at home with governesses and tutors, but mostly through voracious independent reading. From early childhood she scribbled letters, stories, and plays, which she &#145;produced&#146; at home; she was a gifted, mischievous mimic. When she was nine years old, Dr Parker, family friend and preacher at the City Temple, published two of her stories in his newspaper, <span class="italic">The Fountain</span>. From her toddling days she was her father's constant companion.<br>
<br>In her teens, in England and Europe, Pearl continued to devour books, attend the theatre, write stories, and study music, becoming an accomplished pianist. She also frequented art museums, galleries, and concerts, and occasionally performed in amateur theatricals. In Paris from 1885 to 1886 she studied the French language, literature, and drama, and became quite Gallic in tastes and manners. She dressed fashionably and expensively, and in May 1886 she was presented at court. In some areas of her life, however, young Pearl was torn and unhappy. As the child of an American nonconformist who had made his money in trade, she was hurt by fashionable society's snobbishness; she came to loathe the nonconformist spirit and recoiled from her mother's idiosyncrasies.<br>
<br>At the age of nineteen, on 16 February 1887, at Christ Church, Lancaster Gate, London, Pearl married Reginald Walpole Craigie (1860&#150;1930), who was a handsome, popular man about town seven years her senior. He was a cashier at the Bank of England and a photographer, and his forebears included the duke of Marlborough and the earls of Orford and Cadogan. The marriage soon proved disastrous, &#145;a psychic earthquake whose repercussions would affect Pearl's whole life&#146;  (Harding, 53), as she found herself repelled by the fast society that Reginald enjoyed. She consequently immersed herself in University College classes in Greek and Latin language and literature, and at home closeted herself for hours, studying and writing. (In 1888 and 1889 she published a few journalistic pieces.) Reginald resented her literary pursuits and was madly jealous of her classics teacher. He also had at least one adulterous relationship, and drank excessively, becoming violent when drunk. Finding herself pregnant, an increasingly desperate Pearl rode her horse wildly in an attempt to abort the child, but on 15 August 1890 she gave birth to a son, John Churchill Craigie. After this she spent more and more time in her parents' home, and in May 1891, determined to prevent Craigie from having any access to the child, she went to live with her parents permanently. On 5 July 1892 she entered the Roman Catholic church, adopting the name Mary-Teresa; it was probably at this time that she took a vow of celibacy. On 4 July 1895, after a humiliating two-day hearing, she was granted a divorce on the grounds of Craigie's adultery and cruelty, and she was granted complete custody of her son.<br>
<br>The chief cause of the collapse of that marriage has only recently become known: not only did Reginald have syphilis; he gave at least a mild case of it to Pearl. That fact throws new light on many aspects of Pearl's life: the young couple's early return from their honeymoon in Cannes; Pearl's illness for the next six months and her temporary lameness; her attempt to abort her child; her subsequent erratic health, dependence on medical drugs, and early death; her vow of celibacy and strict keeping of it; and her frequent melancholy.<br>
<br>Re-established in her parents' luxurious homes in London and the Isle of Wight and from 1891 not only the &#145;brilliant Mrs Craigie&#146; but the increasingly famous author John Oliver Hobbes, Pearl soon became one of society's most popular hostesses and guests. A fascinating conversationalist, she was also very attractive, petite, and elegant, with &#145;dark, brilliant eyes, restlessly intelligent and remotely tragic&#146;  (Harding, 97). For a brief term she was president of the Society of Women Journalists (1895&#150;6) and the Ruskin Society (1903&#150;4), and she supported many charitable causes, particularly for children. She travelled extensively in England, Scotland, and elsewhere in Europe and was royally entertained in the United States, once by President and Mrs Cleveland in the White House (1895). Early in 1903, as guest of the viceroy and vicereine, Lord and Lady Curzon, she attended Curzon's durbar in India. In the early 1900s she lectured widely in England and Scotland; on a hectic Lyceum tour in the winter of 1905&#150;6 she was lionized in many cities in the United States.<br>
<br>In her character and personality, Pearl was a mass of contradictions. Indisputably brilliant, learned, witty, ambitious, self-dramatizing, moody, and extremely attractive to men, she seemed to some cold and self-aggrandizing, but to many more, warm, generous, and deeply religious, an ideal friend. Among the men with whom she had close platonic relationships were Walter Spindler, Alfred Goodwin (her classics teacher), George Moore, Owen Seaman, and&#151;probably the most important romantic relationship in her life&#151;George Nathaniel Curzon, Marquess Curzon of Kedleston. George Meredith, Edmund Gosse, William Archer, Thomas Hardy, Henry James, and Henry Irving all admired her, and her many clerical friends included the protestant Dr John Parker, the modernist Roman Catholic theologian the Revd George Tyrrell, and the Revd Mgr William Brown. Among her closest women friends were Zo&euml; Procter (her secretary), Florence Henniker, Ellen Terry, Olga Nethersole, and, dearest of all, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/57521/', "Mary Victoria Curzon")</script> and Jennie Churchill, with whom Pearl helped to create the <span class="italic">Anglo-Saxon Review</span> (1899&#150;1901) and with whom she played the piano in public concerts.<br>
<br>With <span class="italic">Some Emotions and a Moral</span> (1891), an ironic little love story, Pearl burst upon the literary scene as John Oliver Hobbes&#151;John for her father and son, Oliver for Oliver Cromwell, Hobbes for Thomas Hobbes. (Pearl used a pseudonym mainly because her publisher, T. F. Unwin, wished to include the book in his new <span class="roman">Pseudonym Library</span> series.) That novella was immediately followed by three more (1892, 1893, 1894). Act <span class="smallcap">I</span> of a social comedy, &#145;The Fool's Hour&#146; (in collaboration with George Moore, never completed), appeared in the first issue of the <span class="italic">Yellow Book</span> (April 1894); a one-act &#145;proverb&#146;, <span class="italic">Journeys End in Lovers' Meeting</span> (also in collaboration with Moore), was successfully produced at the Lyceum Theatre in 1895 with Ellen Terry in the lead.<br>
<br>From 1895 to 1906, in addition to short works, Pearl wrote nine full-length novels and several full-length plays, gaining a large following on both sides of the Atlantic. The most notable novels were: <span class="italic">The Gods, some Mortals, and Lord Wickenham</span> (1895), <span class="italic">The School for Saints</span> (1897), <span class="italic">Robert Orange</span> (1900), <span class="italic">Love and the Soul Hunters</span> (1902), <span class="italic">The Vineyard</span> (1904), and <span class="italic">The Dream and the Business</span> (1906). Her most successful play, a four-act comedy, <span class="italic">The Ambassadors</span>, was produced in 1898 at the Lyceum with George Alexander in the lead and enjoyed a long West End run. Her numerous essays are also noteworthy, especially &#145;George Eliot&#146;, &#145;George Sand&#146;, her many articles on the contemporary theatre, and <span class="italic">Dowries</span> (1904), a feminist pamphlet.<br>
<br>Those diverse works are linked by a strong family resemblance. Pearl's immediate <i>fin de si&egrave;cle</i> world and her complex inner life are reflected throughout, but there are also consistent literary influences discernible throughout, spanning the classics of Western literature from the <span class="roman">Bible</span> and Homer to her own century and, in that century, particularly Thackeray, Ruskin, Newman, George Eliot, Meredith, Browning, Balzac, George Sand, and the contemporary French theatre. Certain themes resonated more and more firmly as their author matured: individual responsibility for one's fate; love as the primal force and the great educator; the importance of rational, unselfish love and the dangers of sentimentality, hypocrisy, and egotism; the inevitability of suffering; mankind's grounding in &#145;original ignorance&#146; rather than &#145;original sin&#146;; the necessity of renunciation, courage, and compassion; the strong vocational attractions of art and religion; and an unmilitant, apolitical feminism&#151;a feminism based on a belief in women's worth, intelligence, and right to a good education and financial independence, but also on a conviction of women's essential psychological difference from men.<br>
<br>Opinions about Pearl Craigie's works have differed widely. While most readers would consider her novels &#145;good reads&#146;, her detractors have complained that her plots are often contrived, her wit and gem-like style chilling, and her characters unrealistic. Their appeal for others, however, lies in their lucid and graceful style, their fast-moving stories abounding in dramatic talk-filled scenes, their interesting characters, and their constant expression of their author's humour, rare psychological insight, and fine intelligence. Though the early novellas are probably the most charming, the mellow novels <span class="italic">Love and the Soul Hunters</span>, <span class="italic">The Vineyard</span>, and <span class="italic">The Dream and the Business</span> would probably appeal most to the modern reader. Her most impressive work, however, is the monumental two-volume novel comprising <span class="italic">The School for Saints</span> and its sequel <span class="italic">Robert Orange</span>. Set in Britain and Europe in the 1860s, the first volume is epic: a wide-ranging, political-religious-historical novel packed with adventure and intrigue, and also a romantic-psychological novel of Robert Orange's apprenticeship to life. The second volume is dramatic: more concentrated and more reliant upon theatrical episodes. The vast web of personal relationships in <span class="italic">The School</span> is complicated in <span class="italic">Robert Orange</span> by the addition of a third heroine. Throughout, politics, love, and religion vie for importance in Robert's life.<br>
<br>Pearl's life ended suddenly. Although she had remained active, her health had deteriorated under strains in her personal life&#151;debts, her mother's idiosyncrasies, distress about Mary Curzon's long illness and death (18 July 1906), and the consequent revival of the old question as to whether Pearl and Curzon would marry. On 13 August 1906, she was found dead of heart failure in her bed at her London home, 56 Lancaster Gate. The literary world was stunned; more than 150 notices of her death appeared in the British press. Among the messages of condolence to her family were notes from the queen and the princess of Wales, and one from Reginald Craigie to his sixteen-year-old son. After a requiem mass at the Jesuit church in Farm Street, London, Pearl's body was buried on 17 August 1906 in Kensal Green Roman Catholic cemetery.<br>
<br>On 2 July 1908, thanks to the efforts of Jennie Churchill (Mrs George Cornwallis-West), Blanche Eliot, Zo&euml; Procter, and many others, a memorial ceremony was held at University College, London, with Lord Curzon presiding. A plaque bearing a bronze portrait of Pearl Craigie, and &pound;500 for a John Oliver Hobbes scholarship in English literature, were donated to University College. Simultaneously an identical plaque was donated to Barnard College, Columbia University, where Pearl had lectured.<br>
