<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Corbet <span class="st"> [<em>other married name </em>Campbell]</span>,  Freda K&uuml;nzlen</span>  (1900&#150;1993), <span class="occ">teacher and politician</span>, was born at 67 Trinity Road, Tooting, London, on 15 November 1900, the eldest of the three children of Adolf Frederic Hermann K&uuml;nzlen, a commercial clerk and later an insurance agent, and his wife, Nellie, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Hubbard. She was educated at various schools in south London before winning a scholarship to Wimbledon county technical school in 1911. Her mother fostered her political radicalism, and while at University College, London, where she held a scholarship, Freda Mansell (the surname which her family had adopted during the war) joined the Independent Labour Party (ILP) in 1919.<br>
<br>After gaining a first-class degree in history, Freda Mansell taught in Wales and Cornwall (becoming mistress of Penzance Church High School for Girls). On 5 August 1925 she married a fellow ILP member, William Corbet (1887&#150;1957), the son of William Corbet, shopkeeper, at the Friends' meeting-house, Streatham. Her husband ran a confectioner's and newsagent's shop in Tooting, and this became their joint occupation during most of their married life. She also resumed her studies and was called to the bar at the Inner Temple in 1932 but, despite first-class exam results, she found it difficult to obtain legal work on account of her gender.<br>
<br>After a failed attempt at acting, Corbet became a popular speaker at open-air meetings. At the urging of her friend Herbert Morrison, the London Labour Party leader, who was keen to recruit women candidates, she contested her first local council election in 1927. After three campaigns in North Islington she was finally elected to the London county council (LCC) for Camberwell North-West in 1934, when Labour began its twenty-five year dominance of the LCC. Her husband was also elected to Wandsworth council.<br>
<br>As a former teacher, Corbet served on the LCC's education committee for sixteen years and supported comprehensive schools, co-writing a party report in 1934 which paved the way for their later introduction by the LCC. She also took an interest in housing and fought for lifts in council tower blocks. At the general election of 1935 she unsuccessfully contested the parliamentary seat of Lewisham East as Labour candidate. In 1940 she became a London magistrate and took a liberal approach towards juveniles who came before her; she later convinced the LCC to make a submission to the Ingleby committee on the treatment and punishment of young offenders. She also helped to persuade the TUC to support family allowances for women in the early 1940s, a measure which many male workers feared would undermine their traditional claims to receive a family wage. The Corbets themselves had been unable to raise children on account of the cost of domestic help.<br>
<br>During the Second World War Corbet tirelessly assisted blitz victims in Camberwell, and in 1945 she was elected MP for Camberwell North-West (Peckham from 1950). She regarded the House of Commons as secondary to her municipal work: it was said that she rarely ventured north of the Thames, and she contributed to debates infrequently. Yet she could influence ministers on certain issues, represented Britain at the United Nations conference of 1948 which produced the <span class="roman">Declaration of Human Rights</span>, and took the unusual step of holding fortnightly surgeries for her constituents, which answered some local criticism of her record as an MP.<br>
<br>In 1947 Corbet became Labour's chief whip on the LCC and, in conjunction with the new council leader, Isaac Hayward, exercised formidable authority. Despite her slight appearance (she was only 4 foot 11 inches in height), she was known as the &#145;tiny tyrant&#146; for her tough enforcement of the party line. Councillors were forbidden from publicly dissenting or even asking questions at public meetings without Corbet's consent; Clement Attlee reportedly described the LCC in this period as &#145;the nearest approach to a totalitarian state in Western Europe&#146;  (Saint, 261). This system, coupled with her visceral dislike of Labour's Bevanite left, did not make her universally popular, and councillors strove for a more open council. After years of dissatisfaction, Labour councillors voted in March 1960 to replace her as chief whip&#151;a move which, despite previous challenges, took her by surprise.<br>
<br>Corbet was soon appointed chairman of the LCC's general services committee. In this capacity she did some of her most important work, overseeing the expansion and transformation of the South Bank through the establishment of the Queen Elizabeth Hall and Purcell Room, the Hayward Gallery, and the National Theatre. The latter project had been delayed for over a decade until the LCC provided land and funding, and consequently the council had a seat on the theatre's board, held by Corbet from 1962 until 1965. During the Commons debates on local government reform, she strongly opposed the government's &#145;mischievous&#146; plan to replace her beloved LCC with the Greater London council; she left local government when the LCC came to an end in 1965.<br>
<br>After the death of her first husband, Corbet married, on 8 August 1962, Ian McIvor Campbell (1898/9&#150;1976), a company director, who had also lost his first spouse; he was the son of Donald Frederick Campbell, publicity specialist. Wishing to spend more time with her invalid husband, she announced in February 1972 her intention not to seek re-election to the House of Commons in 1974, amid doubt whether she could have won Labour's nomination for the newly redistributed seat of Southwark Peckham. Her announcement followed her abstention, along with four other pro-European Labour MPs, in defiance of their party's three-line whip, on the second reading of the <span class="roman">European Communities Bill</span>, which narrowly passed, sanctioning Britain's accession to the European Common Market. This act of rebellion practically ended her political career in the Labour Party. None the less, her years of work were recognized on her seventy-fourth birthday, a few months after she left the Commons, with the freedom of the borough of Southwark. Her later years were marred by schizophrenia. She died of bronchopneumonia and heart failure at her home, 39 Gravel Road, Bromley, Kent, on 1 November 1993.<br>
