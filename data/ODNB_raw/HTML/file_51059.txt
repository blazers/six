<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Isaacs <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Fairhurst]</span>,  Susan Sutherland</span>  (1885&#150;1948), <span class="occ">educational psychologist and psychoanalyst</span>, was born on 24 May 1885, at 32 Bradshaw Brow, Turton, Bolton, Lancashire, the seventh of eight children of William Fairhurst, journalist and Methodist lay preacher, and his wife, Miriam Sutherland. Fairhurst's personality was significantly influenced by crucial events in her early childhood: her sudden weaning from the breast when her infant brother caught pneumonia and the loss of her mother's devotion, regained only through the death of that brother when Susan was eight months old. Her mother died when Susan was six and her father soon married the nurse who had attended her mother during her fatal illness; this led to an unforgiving alienation from her father who died when Susan was twenty-four. Through her Kleinian analysis she later recognized guilt at the death that had secured her mother's attention and further guilt occasioned by her mother's death. She became further alienated from her father through conversion to atheistic socialism.<br>
<br>An intelligent, strong-minded child, eager to learn, frustrated at primary school, rebellious at Bolton secondary school, which she left after three years in 1900, Fairhurst resumed her education when she began training as an infant school teacher at Manchester University. Encouraged to enter graduate school she learned sufficient Greek and German in three months to meet the requirements. She obtained a first-class honours degree in philosophy under Professor S. Alexander followed by a year's scholarship to Newnham College, Cambridge (1910&#150;11), which led to her life's interest in psychology. She taught infant school teachers for one year at Darlington Training College (1913&#150;14), then logic for one year at Manchester University (1914&#150;15).<br>
<br>Fairhurst was a robust, rather short Lancashire girl of pale complexion, with a mass of fair hair and bright hazel eyes. She was challenging, tilting her head as she spoke, a little mischievous in her manner, but visibly friendly. She possessed a tautness of mind characterizing an able intellect which delighted in dialectic action. Trained in psychology, logic, philosophy, and psychoanalysis, her knowledge, which she used to the full, was tempered by humour.<br>
<br>On 11 July 1914 Fairhurst married botany lecturer William Broadhurst Brierley (<i>b</i>. 1888/9), son of Charles Henry Brierley, a brass moulder. Moving to London with her husband she became tutor to the Workers' Educational Association and from 1916 tutor in psychology to the University of London.<br>
<br>In 1922 the couple divorced and on 17 November that year she married Nathan Isaacs (<i>b</i>. 1894/5), the son of Isaac Isaacs, a retired general merchant. A manager of a metal merchant's, Nathan Isaacs became a brilliant collaborator in his wife's subsequent writings. Susan Isaacs's outstanding work on the intellectual and social development of young children was done at Malting House School, Cambridge, founded by Geoffrey Pyke, an eccentric genius who had made a fortune speculating on metal exchanges. He wanted to found a school as different as possible from Wellington, the public school where as a Jew he had suffered persecution and a rigid education. His ideal school would enable children to encounter the ideas of discovery through play. Isaacs's association with the school lasted from 1924 to 1927, during which time thirty-one pupils with a mean IQ of 131 were closely studied for both their intellectual and their social development. The school collapsed as Pyke's grandiosity increasingly interfered with Isaacs's running of the school. (Subsequently Pyke lost his fortune, had a severe nervous breakdown, and committed suicide in 1948.) At Malting House School children were given great freedom for their intellectual and emotional development, supported by loving firmness rather than given punishment. The child was seen as a research worker; the teacher was an observer and provider of material and equipment required. Her work there had great influence on the education of children under seven in state schools, establishing play as central for the child's means of living and of understanding life.<br>
<br>Analysed by J. C. Flugel, Isaacs became an associate member of the newly formed British Psycho-Analytic Society in 1921, becoming a full member in 1923. Though already a full member of the society before her Malting House School days, she submitted herself to further analysis with Joan Riviere and to supervision to get personal experience and understanding of Melanie Klein's new ideas on infancy.<br>
<br>Susan Isaacs was an enthusiastic and early expositor of Jean Piaget's theories on the intellectual development of young children, though she combined her enthusiasm with criticism of his schemas for stages of cognitive development, which to her were over-schematic, not based on observation of the child in his natural environment, unlike her own, which came from the close observation of children at Malting House School. She published <span class="italic">The Intellectual Growth of Young Children</span> in 1930 and <span class="italic">The Social Development of Young Children</span> in 1933. In 1933 Susan Isaacs was appointed head of the newly formed department of child development of the University of London under Sir Percy Nunn. Despite under-funding she built a department of great influence in the teaching profession, overcoming the profession's reluctance to consider psychodynamic theory which she could bring together with developmental psychology.<br>
<br>Isaacs's influence as an educator extended widely. As Ursula Wise she answered parents' questions in the journals <span class="italic">The Nursery World</span> and <span class="italic">Home and School</span>. Her <span class="italic">Nursery Years</span> (1929) was a widely read and influential book in which understanding of the child's mind replaced punitive discipline. Isaacs developed cancer in 1935 and struggled with ill health for the next thirteen years, but nevertheless in 1937 she made an influential tour of Australia and New Zealand. Moving to Cambridge in 1939 she conducted the Cambridge Evacuation Survey on the effects of evacuation on children.<br>
<br>Isaacs was appointed CBE in 1948 for services to education; she had brought teaching and psychoanalysis into dialogue. Through her teaching she probably influenced the theory and practice of education in Britain more than any other person in the twentieth century. A pioneer, always a little ahead of her time, she introduced progressive educationist ideas to teachers and parents, wrote influential books on the intellectual and social development of young children, and responded generously to the needs of parents through journalism. A trained psychoanalyst, she supported and conceptualized the views of Melanie Klein on the fantasy life of children and introduced psychoanalytic ideas into general developmental psychology. Isaacs's great influence sprang from a combination of deep knowledge, sensitive observation and insight, robust common sense, and a sympathy which was extended not only to children but to those who care for them and bring them up. She died from cancer at her home, 30A Primrose Hill Road, London, on 12 October 1948. She was survived by her husband.<br>
