<span class="headword">Wenman <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Fermor]</span>,  Agnes</span>, Lady Wenman  (<em>d.</em> 1617), <span class="occ">translator</span>, was one of the two eldest of the sixteen children of Sir George Fermor (1550&#150;1612), of Easton Neston, Northamptonshire, and his wife, Mary Curzon (<i>d</i>. 1628), daughter of Thomas Curzon, of Addington, Buckinghamshire. In 1595 she married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29045/', "Richard Wenman (1572/3&#150;1640)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29046/', "Wenman, Thomas, second Viscount Wenman")</script>], eldest son of Sir Thomas Wenman (<i>d</i>. 1577) of Thame Park, Oxfordshire, and his wife, Jane (<i>fl</i>. 1572&#150;1613), daughter of William West, first Baron De La Warr. He was knighted the following year. They had eight children.<br>
<br>Wenman was suspected of involvement in the Gunpowder Plot of 1605. She came from a Catholic family, and was related to the known recusant Elizabeth Vaux, and, as the result of a misunderstanding over a letter of Vaux's, Wenman was examined twice. Although the charges against her were dropped, it is clear that Wenman had some knowledge of illegal Catholic activities, even if not of the Gunpowder Plot itself. John Morris identifies her as the lady with whom the Jesuit missionary Father John Gerard (1564&#150;1637) was playing cards, disguised as a layman, when they were visited by George Abbot (1562&#150;1633), future archbishop of Canterbury, who had recently published an attack on Gerard; as Gerard reports, Wenman &#145;could scarce keep her countenance, thinking within herself what he would have said if he had known whom he was answering&#146;  (Morris, 347).<br>
<br>Wenman's &#145;The historyes and chronicles of the world by John Zonaras&#146; (an English rendering of Jean de Maumont's French version of a thirteenth-century Greek text) makes her one of the many early modern women whose writing began to attract attention only towards the end of the twentieth century. It is arguable that evidence of Wenman's choice of text provides additional evidence of her Catholicism. Although De Maumont's preface stresses that the work is one of &#145;secular and humane learning&#146;  (CUL, MS Dd.i.18, fol. 2<i>v</i>), it describes rulers who &#145;seperated themselves&#146; from &#145;the sincere and true doctrine of God&#146;  (ibid., fol. 9<i>v</i>), and its translation in the late sixteenth or early seventeenth century might well have been regarded as a political act.<br>
<br>The work survives in only two manuscripts, neither of which preserves the full text. The first of these is one of Wenman's own notebooks; the second, a scribal publication in two large folio volumes, whose page layout and title-page imitate those of a printed text. The &#145;published&#146; version of the &#145;Historyes&#146; was evidently copied from Wenman's holograph; the scribe's annotations appear in the surviving notebook, and the majority of his more idiomatic renderings of Wenman's engaging but often extremely literal translation are incorporated in the later manuscript. It seems likely, therefore, that this manuscript was produced by a friend or relative, and that the work did not achieve a wide circulation; since the title-page records her as &#145;deceased&#146;, it is possible that the folios were intended as a private memorial. However, both translation and copying would have demanded considerable time and effort, and, in view of the religious climate, should be read as a form of self-identification or an affirmation of faith, even if a private one.<br>
<br>Wenman was buried near other members of her husband's family at Twyford church in Buckinghamshire on 4 July 1617.<br>
