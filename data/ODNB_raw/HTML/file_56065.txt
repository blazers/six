<span class="headword">Tollemache,  Lionel Arthur</span>  (1838&#150;1919), <span class="occ">writer and man of leisure</span>, was born in Belgravia, London, on 28 May 1838, the second son of John Tollemache (1805&#150;1890), benevolent landlord and affable tory politician, and Georgina Louisa, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Best, first wife and first cousin, who died on 18 July 1846. The other surviving son of this first marriage, Wilbraham, inherited the title of Baron Tollemache of Helmingham, which had been conferred upon John in 1876.<br>
<br>As a younger son Lionel played no part in the management of the extensive Tollemache estates. Nor did he share his father's politics: he always described himself as a &#145;staunch Whig&#146;. Yet he was proud of his family and sufficiently close to his father to be called upon to accompany him and his second bride, Minnie Duff, on their honeymoon. There were no fewer than twenty-four sons of this second marriage, of whom only twelve survived, along with one daughter. Tollemache considered his father to be &#145;the grandest specimen of a country gentleman that our generation has seen or is likely to see&#146;.<br>
<br>The pattern of Tollemache's life was shaped as much by physical misfortune as by family inheritance. Handicapped by a stammer, he suffered an accident in childhood which left him slightly lame. His eyesight was weak, and for many years before his death he was completely blind. There was something extraordinary, therefore, about his vast knowledge of books, including novels. He had a prodigious memory. He also came to rely on conversation.<br>
<br>There was nothing unusual, however, about Tollemache's education, given his family background. He was sent to Harrow School in 1850, and from there was awarded one of two scholarships to Balliol. In 1860, after being granted permission to dictate his answers to an amanuensis, he was placed in the first class in <i>literae humaniores</i>. He subsequently quoted frequently from the classics, using them as reference points in his depiction and analysis of the culture of his own time. His bent was speculative&#151;he was interested in science and, above all, in the possible shapes of the future, as well as in history&#151;but he savoured anecdotes about his contemporaries, and set out to be a Boswell for a selected few of them.<br>
<br>After reading inconclusively for the bar Tollemache turned in 1868 to writing for London periodicals, including the <span class="italic">Fortnightly Review</span>, going on to collect and add to them in two privately printed volumes which he offered to a number of open libraries. <span class="italic">Stones of Stumbling</span> (1884) dealt with philosophical and theological issues: its title was chosen to avoid offence to his evangelical father. <span class="italic">Safe Studies</span> (1883) dealt with people and less controversial ideas. Both volumes were published and advertised at cost price in 1891. They included Boswellian dialogues in the vein of Abraham Hayward and character sketches which pointed to, rather than avoided, contradictions. Two of the Oxford characters, Mark Pattison and Benjamin Jowett, were the subject of whole volumes in 1885 and 1895. Later in life Tollemache published two volumes of personal recollections, <span class="italic">Old and Odd Memories</span> (1908) and <span class="italic">Nuts and Chestnuts</span> (1911).<br>
<br>On 25 January 1870 Tollemache married Beatrix Lucia Catherine (1840&#150;1926), the youngest daughter of William Tatton Egerton, Baron Egerton of Tatton, a Cheshire neighbour and neighbour of the Gladstones. A writer herself, she was in sympathy with his literary aspirations. The most remarkable of his books was his <span class="italic">Talks with Mr. Gladstone</span>, which appeared in June 1898, one month after Gladstone's death. Tollemache first met Gladstone in Oxford on 28 January 1857, but thereafter they met infrequently until more regular talks began at Biarritz in 1891. Gladstone, though cautious on some topics, unburdened himself a good deal to Tollemache, noting: &#145;he in particular is a very interesting person&#146;. For health reasons Tollemache spent much of his life across the channel, and Biarritz, where he first met Pattison, was one of the aged Gladstone's frequent retreats. Tollemache was fascinated by longevity, and the talks were broad enough to encompass most topics, including religion. Immediate politics were avoided. The <span class="italic">St James's Gazette</span> called the volume &#145;the most interesting book of the year. It is of lasting value to historians&#146;  (Briggs, ix).<br>
<br>Tollemache's life was shorter than Gladstone's, but he reached the age of eighty and died at his home, Dunrozel, Haslemere, Surrey, on 29 January 1919. The couple was childless; his widow died on 24 December 1926.<br>
