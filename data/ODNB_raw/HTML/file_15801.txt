<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Knyvett,  Charles</span>  (1752&#150;1822), <span class="occ">musician and singer</span>, was born on 11 February 1752 in the parish of St Margaret's, Westminster, the son of Charles Knyvett (1710&#150;1782) and his wife, Jane, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Jordan (1714&#150;1785). Educated at Westminster School from 1762, he was a boy chorister at Westminster Abbey under Benjamin Cooke and was appointed joint organist (with William Smethergell) of All Hallows Barking in November 1770. On 16 June 1772, at St Marylebone, he married Rose Alleway (<i>c</i>.1752&#150;1807). Her family came from Sonning in Berkshire and Knyvett later acquired property there.<br>
<br>Knyvett performed occasionally at the theatre: among his engagements, in May 1775 he was paid for fourteen nights' harpsichord playing at Drury Lane, and in June 1790 he accompanied Mrs Billington when she sang Purcell's &#145;Mad Bess&#146; in character as Ophelia in <span class="italic">Hamlet</span>. When he joined the Royal Society of Musicians in 1778 he was described as &#145;a Sober Industrious Man&#146;  (Matthews, 87). He was an organist in the oratorios at Covent Garden from 1789 to 1792, sang in the Chapel Royal choir from 1786, and was appointed organist there in 1796.<br>
<br>Knyvett was a principal alto at the Handel commemoration concerts from 1784. The &#145;Two Master Knyvetts&#146; in the 1784 choir were his sons <a href="#cosubject_15802">Charles [<i>see below</i>]</a> and Henry (1774&#150;1843), who became an army officer; a third son, the singer and composer <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15803/', "William Knyvett")</script>, was born in 1779. Between 1785 and 1799 the elder Charles sang every year at the Concerts of Ancient Music. He played the organ at the Three Choirs meeting in 1780 and sang at the Cambridge festival during the 1780s. With the tenor Samuel Harrison he founded the Vocal Concerts, a fashionable subscription series which ran each spring from 1792 to 1795. Knyvett appeared as singer and piano accompanist in these concerts, which featured English songs and glees. He sang for the Noblemen's and Gentlemen's Catch Club, the Je ne sais quoi Club, and the Anacreontic Society. Parke described him as &#145;perhaps the best catch singer in England&#146;  (Parke, 2.236), while Stevens remembered his &#145;rich strain of humour&#146;  (<span class="italic">Recollections of R. J. S. Stevens</span>, 76) at these convivial meetings. Knyvett moved on terms of friendship with aristocratic patrons of the catch clubs and Concerts of Ancient Music. In 1800 he edited <span class="italic">A Collection of Favorite Glees</span> submitted by candidates for two prizes given by the prince of Wales (afterwards George IV), one of which was won by his son William. The younger Charles and William performed with their father, and a number of three-part glees were published as sung by the Messrs Knyvett. Charles senior died at his house in Blandford Place, Pall Mall, on 19 January 1822 after a lingering illness.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_15802"></a><span class="headword">Charles Knyvett</span>  (1773&#150;1852), <span class="occ">musician and singer</span>, was born on 23 March 1773 in the parish of St George's, Hanover Square, London. The <span class="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</span> says that he was a chorister of Westminster Abbey under Sir William Parsons, but this statement is not supported by the records. Apprenticed to his father for five years, by the age of twenty-one he was a professional pianist, singer, and music teacher. He married Jane Laney (<i>d</i>. in or after 1807) on 1 September 1795; they had seven children. In 1802 he was appointed organist of St George's, Hanover Square, and his <span class="italic">Selection of Psalm Tunes</span> as sung at that church appeared in four editions between 1823 and 1850. He also published some keyboard works and glees and became an eminent teacher of thoroughbass and piano. Knyvett died on 2 November 1852, having retired to the estate he inherited at Sonning, Berkshire, after his father's death.<br>
