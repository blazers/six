<span class="headword">Marshman,  Joshua</span>  (1768&#150;1837), <span class="occ">orientalist and missionary</span>, son of John Marshman, weaver, who was said to be descended from an officer in the parliamentary army, and Mary Couzener, of Huguenot ancestry, was born at Westbury Leigh, Wiltshire, on 20 April 1768. After some scanty education at the village school, he was apprenticed at fifteen to a London bookseller named Cater, a native of Westbury Leigh, but after five months Joshua returned to assist his father at weaving. Both in London and at home he read omnivorously, mastering, it is said, more than five hundred volumes before he was eighteen. He usually had a book before him on the loom. On 8 August 1791 he married <a href="#cosubject_48964">Hannah Shepherd [<i>see below</i>]</a>.<br>
<br>Weary of weaving, Joshua Marshman became in 1794 master of the Baptist school at Broadmead, Bristol, and studied classics, Hebrew, and Syriac at the Bristol Baptist college. The accounts which he read of the labours of William Carey (1761&#150;1834) in India led him to offer himself to the Baptist Missionary Society, and in company with William Ward and two others he sailed from Portsmouth for India on 29 May 1799. He arrived at the Danish colony of Serampore, near Calcutta, where Carey soon joined them, on 13 October. At that time the East India Company did not allow missionaries into their territory, so Marshman and Carey lived there under Danish protection, translating the <span class="roman">Bible</span> into various languages. They preached and taught in Serampore and travelled throughout the surrounding country; in a few years they established several stations, and rendered the scriptures, in whole or in part, into Bengali, Oriya, Sanskrit, Telugu, Punjabi, Hindustani, Marathi, Hindi, Sikh, and other languages including Chinese. Marshman took the foremost part in this work, and he also handled many of the often difficult negotiations with the British authorities, notably in obtaining their acquiescence for new recruits to mission work in India. In 1811 he received the degree of DD from Brown University in the USA.<br>
<br>Marshman took the main responsibility for the educational work of the Serampore mission, pioneering an important development in Indian elementary education in the vernacular. In 1816 he published <span class="italic">Hints Relative to Native Schools</span>; within a year funds had been raised for the establishment of 100 schools conducted according to the then fashionable monitorial system, with a relatively broad curriculum. Textbooks compiled by the missionaries, which included elements of Western learning, were accepted also in pre-existing indigenous elementary schools. To crown this work for education, in 1818 Marshman drew up the prospectus of a missionary college &#145;for the instruction of Asiatic Christian and other youth in Eastern literature and European science&#146;, which was built at Serampore on the banks of the Hooghly, and which, as Serampore College, continues to exist. In 1827 he received a charter for the college from King Frederik VI of Denmark.<br>
<br>In 1818, in conjunction with his son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18162/', "John Clark Marshman")</script>, and other missionaries, Marshman established the first newspaper ever printed in any Eastern language, the <span class="italic">Sumachar Durpun, or, Mirror of News</span>, and in the same year he commenced the publication of the <span class="italic">Friend of India</span>, a monthly magazine. In 1820 Marshman vigorously asserted the divinity and atonement of Christ in a controversy with the Hindu reformer Ram Mohan Roy. In 1827 the connection between the Baptist Missionary Society and the Serampore missionaries was severed, owing to differences about administration, and a painful and protracted controversy took place, Marshman acting as the representative of the missionaries. Like Carey he suffered at times from melancholia. He died at Serampore on 5 December 1837 and was buried in the mission cemetery on the following day.<br>
<br>Marshman was undoubtedly one of the ablest orientalists and most earnest missionaries that worked in India. He published several works on the Chinese language and a Chinese version of the <span class="roman">Bible</span>, the first complete edition printed in that language and the first Chinese book printed from moveable metal type, which took him fourteen years. He also assisted Carey in the preparation of his Sanskrit grammar.<br>
<br>His wife <a name="cosubject_48964"></a><span class="headword">Hannah Marshman <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Shepherd]</span></span>  (1767&#150;1847)<span class="occ"></span>, born on 13 May 1767 at Bristol, was the granddaughter of John Clark, pastor of the Baptist church at Crockerton, Wiltshire, and the only daughter of John Shepherd, a farmer, and his wife, Rachel. She was outstanding among the missionaries' wives in India at the time in playing an active part in the work of the mission, particularly in the field of education. In 1800 she opened a fee-paying boarding-school for girls, which flourished and soon became a vital source of funds for the mission; and from 1822 she was one of the pioneers of elementary schools for Bengali girls, in which teaching was in the vernacular. She became a matriarchal figure in the domestic life and organization of the Serampore community, and died there on 5 March 1847, a few weeks before her eightieth birthday. The Marshmans had twelve children, six of whom died in infancy.<br>
