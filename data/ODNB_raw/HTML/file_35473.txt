<span class="headword">Percy,  Eustace Sutherland Campbell</span>, Baron Percy of Newcastle  (1887&#150;1958), <span class="occ">politician and educationist</span>, was born in London on 21 March 1887, the twelfth of the thirteen children and youngest of the seven sons of Henry George Percy, Earl Percy (1846&#150;1918), from 1899 seventh duke of Northumberland, and his wife, Lady Edith Campbell (<i>d</i>. 1913), eldest daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/4500/', "George Campbell, eighth duke of Argyll")</script>. From his family he derived a commitment to public service and an attachment to the evangelical Catholic Apostolic sect within the Church of England, which gave him an ascetic, even pious (some thought prim) temperament. He also retained his family's allegiance to the Conservative Party, although his education, early career, and foreign experience removed him from the diehard and chauvinist instincts of both his father and his elder brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35472/', "Alan Percy, eighth duke of Northumberland")</script>. Lord Eustace Percy, as he was styled from 1899, was educated at Eton College and at Christ Church, Oxford (1904&#150;7), where he took a fashionable interest in social reform issues, obtained a first class in modern history, and acquired an academic cast of mind.<br>
<br>After several months in Paris learning French, and brilliant success in the entrance examination, Percy joined the diplomatic service in 1909. From May 1910 to June 1914 he was a secretary at the British embassy in Washington, where the ambassador, James Bryce, became an intellectual mentor. He studied American institutions, travelled widely, and made influential friends, establishing an enduring reputation as an American expert. After the outbreak of the First World War he served successively in the Foreign Office's western, war, and contraband departments. He returned twice to Washington on official business, the second time in April 1917 as a member of the Balfour mission, prolonged to twelve months as representative of the ministry of blockade. Then, as an assistant to Lord Robert Cecil and from January to March 1919 a Foreign Office representative at the Versailles peace conference, he helped draft the League of Nations covenant and was a joint secretary of the inter-allied commission on the league.<br>
<br>On 4 December 1918 Percy married Stella Katherine (1895&#150;1982), eldest daughter of Major-General Laurence Drummond; they had two daughters. A settled family life contributed to Percy's decision to leave the diplomatic service and enter domestic politics. He stood as Conservative candidate at the Kingston upon Hull by-election in March 1919, but was defeated by the Labour candidate. Subsequently elected to the London county council, he became vice-chairman of its housing committee and during 1920 supervised a novel housing bond campaign, an only partially successful scheme to raise funds by popular subscription for relieving the city's housing problems. Meanwhile he earned his living by part-time work for the Shell&#150;Royal Dutch oil group, responsible for its Anglo-Egyptian oilfields and visiting Egypt, Sudan, and Palestine.<br>
<br>In May 1921 Percy won the parliamentary by-election at Hastings, a seat he held until 1937. He became an able critic of the coalition government, but from a quite different direction to that of his elder brother&#151;as a sympathizer with Cecil's brand of Conservative social idealism and support for the League of Nations, having published <span class="italic">The Responsibilities of the League</span> (1920) and serving on the League of Nations union executive into the 1930s. After the coalition's collapse he received rapid political advancement. He was appointed parliamentary secretary at the Board of Education from March to May 1923 and the Board of Health from May 1923 to January 1924, then as a prot&eacute;g&eacute; of Baldwin became, in November 1924, an unusually young cabinet minister as president of the Board of Education. Yet, although he made important contributions to educational policy, this early political promise was largely dissipated. He retained the first Labour government's commitment to renovating elementary schools, reducing class sizes, and expanding secondary education. He presided over the separation of elementary schools into junior and secondary branches at age eleven, and the reorganization of secondary schools as recommended in the 1926 Hadow report. He was especially concerned to promote technical education, for this purpose abolishing the restrictive compulsory state curriculum. But he resisted the more radical reformers' desire to raise the school-leaving age, also recommended in the Hadow report, and became a target for Conservatives who disliked his progressive views and wanted financial retrenchment. Under Treasury pressure in November 1925 he issued board circular 1371, which threatened to cut expenditure on schools and incurred the enduring wrath of teachers, educational administrators, and Labour politicians, even after its withdrawal in March 1926. Moreover, in the House of Commons and cabinet he seemed aloof, superior, portentous, and pedantic, always ready to magnify small differences. By 1928 Baldwin thought of removing him to the ambassadorship in Washington, a post Percy himself coveted but which the Conservative government's defeat at the 1929 election denied him. Nor did Baldwin recommend him for ministerial office in the 1931 National Government.<br>
<br>Out of office Percy continued to contribute to educational debates, publishing <span class="italic">Education and the Crossroads</span> (1930) and editing <span class="italic">The Yearbook of Education</span> from 1932 to 1935. He organized the formation of the Conservative Party's research department during the winter of 1929&#150;30, and created a reputation as a progressive Conservative intellectual with a series of writings&#151;most notably <span class="italic">Democracy on Trial</span> (1931) and <span class="italic">Government in Transition</span> (1934)&#151;arguing for national modernization not just of policies but also of institutions, including a reorganization of government and parliament along corporatist lines. As a senior ex-minister he was appointed chairman of the Indian federal finance committee (involving investigations in India itself) from December 1931 to March 1932, and a member of the parliamentary joint select committee on Indian constitutional reform in 1933 and 1934, drafting the introduction to its report&#151;an important restatement of the principles of imperial rule. Percy's prominent part in defending the National Government's Indian policy in the House of Commons against Churchill and other Conservative critics restored his claim to ministerial office, but not Baldwin's confidence in his capacity to head a department. Percy later considered his period as minister without portfolio from June 1935 to March 1936 as a &#145;suicidal ten months&#146;  (Percy, 152) because with a cabinet seat yet no staff and no clear responsibilities he could do little, and was widely criticized for doing nothing.<br>
<br>Disillusioned with political life, Percy spent a few months in 1936&#150;7 as chairman of the British Council, negotiating its grant from the Treasury in October 1937. After fulfilling a religious interest by publishing <span class="italic">John Knox</span> (1937), he resigned his parliamentary seat in order to become the first rector of King's College, Newcastle. Here he thought he did his best, as well as personally most congenial, work. He turned a newly created amalgamation of colleges, formed as a division of the University of Durham, into an effective institution and planned a successful post-war expansion in scientific and technical departments; this gave it the impetus to become, after his death, the independent University of Newcastle. In 1944 he chaired the Ministry of Education's committee on higher technological education, recommending closer ties with industry. After retiring as rector in October 1952, he was created Baron Percy of Newcastle (on 12 February 1953). He chaired the Burnham committee on teachers' salaries from 1953 to 1956 and the royal commission on the law relating to mental illness and mental deficiency from 1954 to 1957, the basis for the 1959 <span class="roman">Mental Health Act</span>. He also resumed his reflections on government in <span class="italic">The Heresy of Democracy</span> (1954), and published one of the most intelligent, interesting, and self-critical political autobiographies, <span class="italic">Some Memories</span> (1958). He died at his home, the Old Rectory, Etchingham, Sussex, on 3 April 1958, when his title became extinct.<br>
