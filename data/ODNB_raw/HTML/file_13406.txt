<span class="headword">Hoblyn,  Robert</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1710, <em>d.</em> 1756), <span class="occ">politician and book collector</span>, was born at Nanswhyden House, St Columb Major, and baptized at St Columb Major in Cornwall on 5 May 1710. He was the only son of Francis Hoblyn (1687&#150;1711), a justice of the peace for Cornwall and a member of the stannary parliament, and Penelope, daughter of Colonel Sidney Godolphin of Shropshire. Following his father's death, his mother married secondly, on 5 September 1714, Sir William Pendarves of Pendarves.<br>
<br>Robert Hoblyn attended Eton College. He matriculated from Corpus Christi College, Oxford, on 18 December 1727, took a BCL degree in 1734, and in the same year contributed verses to the <span class="italic">Epithalamia Oxoniensia</span>. His translation of the first book of <span class="italic">The Georgics</span> of Virgil was published, posthumously, in 1825. He sat as one of the members of parliament for the city of Bristol from 24 November 1742 to 8 April 1754, voting generally with the opposition, and was appointed speaker of two convocations of the stannary parliament in Cornwall. He was elected a fellow of the Royal Society on 13 June 1745, and admitted on 24 October. He married Jane Coster, the only daughter of Thomas Coster, a Bristol merchant.<br>
<br>Early in life Hoblyn had travelled in Italy, where he collected many scarce books. He inherited an ample fortune, which was greatly increased by the profits from his successful investment in the Cornish tin mining industry. With his wealth he restored his ancestral home, Nanswhyden House, about 1740, employing Thomas Edwards and John Potter as his architects. This building is described in William Borlase's <span class="italic">Natural History of Cornwall</span> (1758), with a plate engraved at the expense of Jane Hoblyn. Hoblyn also delighted in collecting books, and he destroyed all the documents relating to their cost. His library was divided into the classes of natural and moral philosophy, and he made a manuscript catalogue in which he marked with an asterisk those works which were not in the Bodleian Library. All clergymen and persons of literary tastes had free access to the library.<br>
<br>Hoblyn died at Nanswhyden House on 17 November 1756. His monument in St Columb church, where he was buried on 29 November, bears a very long inscription which is printed by Polwhele. His widow married John Quicke of Exeter in 1759. Hoblyn's estates went to the male descendants of Thomas Hoblyn of Tresaddern, while his library remained with his widow.<br>
<br>In 1768 John Quicke printed Hoblyn's catalogue in two volumes, entitled <span class="italic">Bibliotheca Hobliniana, sive, Catalogus librorum juxta exemplar quod manu sua maxima ex parte descriptum reliquit Robertus Hoblyn, armiger de Nanswhyden in comitatu Cornubiae</span>. An edition in one volume was published by J. Murray in 1769. Dibdin says in referring to it: &#145;I know not who was the author of the arrangement of this collection, but the judicious observer will find it greatly superior to everything of its kind, with hardly even the exception of the &#147;Bibliotheca Croftsiana&#148;&#146;  (Dibdin, 374). Hoblyn's books were sold in London in 1778, and produced about &pound;2500. Nanswhyden House was destroyed by fire on 30 November 1803, with its collections of ancient documents, the records relating to the stannary parliament, and a valuable cabinet of minerals.<br>
