<span class="headword">Peada</span>  (<em>d.</em> 656), <span class="occ">king of the Middle Angles</span>, was the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21829/', "Penda, king of the Mercians")</script>, and perhaps of Penda's queen, Cynewise. At some point, probably in the early 650s, his father created him <i>princeps</i> (&#145;ruler&#146;) of the Middle Angles, who would seem to have been a collection of minor tribes living in the area of the east midlands which lay between the two powerful kingdoms of East Anglia and Mercia. Penda had been battling for control over this region for much of his reign, and the establishment of his son as ruler over the Middle Anglian peoples may mark a final triumph. It seems probable that Peada ruled as a sub-king under his father's authority. He applied to <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20930/', "Oswiu, king of the Northumbrians")</script>, for the hand of his daughter, Alhfl&aelig;d, which was granted on condition that he and his people accepted Christianity. Partly swayed by the advice of his close friend and brother-in-law, Oswiu's son <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/286/', "Alchfrith")</script> (married to Peada's sister Cyneburh), and partly by the preaching which he heard at Oswiu's court, Peada agreed to convert. In 653 he and the nobles accompanying him were baptized by Finan, bishop of Lindisfarne, on a Northumbrian royal estate named Ad Murum (&#145;by the wall&#146;), so called from its proximity to Hadrian's Wall and usually identified as Wallbottle in Northumberland. Returning to his kingdom, Peada brought with him four priests, Cedd, Adda, Betti, and Diuma, who began the conversion of the Middle Angles. At the battle of the River &#145;Winw&aelig;d&#146; in 655 Oswiu routed the Mercian forces, killed Penda, and temporarily took control of his kingdom. As Oswiu's son-in-law, Peada was treated leniently and was established as king of the Mercians living south of the Trent, perhaps in an attempt to foster Mercian support for the new regime. But at Eastertide in the following year he was murdered, allegedly through the treachery of his wife.<br>
