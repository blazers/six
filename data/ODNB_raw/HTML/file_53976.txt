<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Jacques,  Josephine Edwina <span class="st"> [Hattie]</span></span>  (1922&#150;1980), <span class="occ">actress</span>, was born on 7 February 1922 at 125 High Street, Sandgate, Kent, the daughter of Robin Jacques (<i>d</i>. 1922), a lieutenant in the army education corps and a former test pilot in the Royal Flying Corps, and his wife, Mary Adelaide Thorn. Her father was killed in a flying accident the year she was born and Jacques and her brother, the book illustrator Robin Jacques (1920&#150;1995), were largely brought up by their grandparents. She attended Godolphin and Latymer Upper School in London, and trained briefly as a hairdresser. She spent two years during the Second World War as a Red Cross nurse, and then as a welder, before making her stage d&eacute;but in 1944 at the Players Theatre in London, singing Victorian songs. The Players was to be her drama school: she acted in plays and revues there, she directed, wrote song lyrics, and developed the persona she was to use in pantomime for years, the large, bossy, but vulnerable fairy queen, which she later said was her favourite part. She toured with the Young Vic company in <span class="italic">The King Stag</span> as Smeraldina (1947&#150;8), and by 1947 was working regularly in radio. She gained a national audience as the greedy child Sophie Tuckshop, who would regale listeners with terrifying accounts of epic binges, in Tommy Handley's popular series <span class="italic">ITMA</span> (1948&#150;9). From 1950 to 1954 she appeared with Tony Hancock in Eric Sykes's <span class="italic">Educating Archie</span>, and subsequently worked on the innovative <span class="italic">Hancock's Half Hour</span>. Her film career was launched with a series of minor roles in Dickens adaptations&#151;<span class="italic">Nicholas Nickleby</span> (1948), <span class="italic">Oliver Twist</span> (1948), <span class="italic">Scrooge</span> (1951), and <span class="italic">Pickwick Papers</span> (1953). They reflected her talent for larger-than-life comedy which never lost its grip on humanity, while <span class="italic">Old Mother Riley Meets the Vampire</span> (1952) showed her in a broader comic mode. On 10 November 1949 she married the actor <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/31350/', "John Le Mesurier (1912&#150;1983)")</script>; they had two children, and were divorced in 1965.<br>
<br>Jacques excelled as a member of a comic team, generous in giving opportunities to fellow actors. Her skills were most evident in two areas. First, there was the BBC television series <span class="italic">Sykes</span>, which began in 1960 and has a claim to be the first native British sitcom. It starred <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/105345/', "Eric Sykes")</script> as a suburban shopowner living with his sister Hattie, and featured Richard Wattis as their superior neighbour and Deryck Guyler as Corky, the local policeman. Jacques provided a counterpoint to the childlike anarchy of Sykes with her study of a middle-class, slightly pretentious lady struggling to keep her dignity as the men made fools of themselves. Although the plots were undistinguished the visible teamwork within the quartet ensured a long life for the series, which ended with Jacques's death.<br>
<br>Then there were the <span class="italic">Carry on</span> films. Made by Peter Rogers and Gerald Thomas between 1958 and 1979, they never pretended to be more than low-budget family entertainment with an edge of vulgarity; they had little plot, relying on slapstick parodies of British institutions such as the National Health Service and the army. Yet they attracted some of the best comic actors of their generation, drawn by the prospect of regular pay for a limited commitment (typically, they were made in about six weeks). Jacques appeared in fourteen of the twenty-eight, and they show a comic talent of extraordinary versatility. In <span class="italic">Sykes</span> her performance had to be a foil for the main character; in the <span class="italic">Carry Ons</span> she blossomed. The comedy was superficially grounded in physical types like those on the seaside postcards they sought to emulate&#151;skinny henpecked men, busty blondes, enormous mothers-in-law. Jacques, a large woman, might have found her range limited, but discovered so many variations and shades in her roles that one is hardly aware of a typology at work. In <span class="italic">Sergeant</span> (1958) she was a no-nonsense army doctor. In <span class="italic">Cabby</span> (1963) she was the neglected wife of a taxi driver who sets up her own all-woman firm&#151;a truly original piece of comedy exploiting several facets of her comic style. There is her highly individual sexual attractiveness, in a bubblebath sequence where she preens before the mirror in a parody of the cheesecake shots of the day: the humour lies in her highly recognizable awareness of the gap between magazine glamour and reality; however hard she works to become a sensual beauty, her workaholic husband (Sid James) will never notice. There is a comedy of transformation as Jacques masterminds a battle of wits between rival cab firms, sending men off on false errands in a series of assumed voices.<br>
<br>Jacques is enduringly associated with the role of hospital matron, which she played in five <span class="italic">Carry Ons</span>, often with Kenneth Williams as chief consultant. The comic duel between them was for many the high spot of these films. Both were well aware that they had been cast for seaside-postcard contrast: both ignored this and stressed what they shared&#151;authority, embodied in Jacques's size and bell-like voice and Williams's aristocratic face&#151;an authority always undercut by the indignity of bodily desire. In <span class="italic">Carry on Matron</span> (1972) Williams pursued Jacques, to be brushed aside like a mosquito. In <span class="italic">Carry on Doctor</span> (1968) Jacques was the pursuer, vamping a helpless Williams in a black neglig&eacute;e and a voice which purred like Eartha Kitt but, at a hint of resistance, took on the steeliness of Margaret Thatcher. The role embodied her particular talent: although often cast in broad comedy, she never played it broadly, but with an elegance of voice and body that belied all the clich&eacute;s about women and weight.<br>
<br>Jacques died suddenly from heart failure on 6 October 1980 at home at 67 Eardley Crescent, Kensington, aged fifty-eight. At her memorial service at St Paul's, Covent Garden, Kenneth Williams quoted the Victorian novelist Mrs Craik on &#145;the comfort of feeling safe with a person&#146;  (<span class="italic">Kenneth Williams Diaries</span>, 621) which for him and many others summed up her qualities as both friend and ensemble actress.<br>
