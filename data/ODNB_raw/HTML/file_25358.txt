<span class="headword">Sherbrooke, Sir  John Coape</span>  (1764&#150;1830), <span class="occ">army officer and governor-in-chief of British North America</span>, was baptized on 29 April 1764 at Arnold, Nottinghamshire, the third son of William Sherbrooke JP, born Coape, of Farnah in Duffield, Derbyshire, and Arnold, Nottinghamshire, who had taken the name of Sherbrooke on his marriage in 1756 to Sarah, one of the three coheirs of Henry Sherbrooke of Oxton, Nottinghamshire. John was commissioned as ensign in the 4th foot in December 1780 and promoted lieutenant in December 1781. He was given a company in the 85th foot in March 1783, and in June 1784 became captain in the 33rd foot, then stationed in Nova Scotia; he returned to Britain in 1786. Having advanced to major in September 1793 and lieutenant-colonel in May 1794, Sherbrooke served with his regiment successively in the Netherlands, the Cape, and finally India. He was promoted colonel in January 1798, and fought in the Anglo-Mysore War of 1799. His health suffered so severely that in January 1800 he had to return to England, where he was placed on half pay in 1802. The following year he took command of the 4th reserve battalion in the eastern counties.<br>
<br>In January 1805 Sherbrooke advanced to major-general and in June was sent to Sicily, where he became commander of the troops at Messina. He went to Egypt in May 1807 on a diplomatic mission. During the first half of 1808 he took temporary command of all British forces in Sicily. Although French activities in southern Italy made his duties arduous, he resolutely confounded the intrigues of the court at Palermo. Henry Edward Bunbury, a fellow officer, described Sherbrooke as<blockquote>a short, square, hardy little man, with a countenance that told at once the determined fortitude of his nature. Without genius, without education, hot as pepper, and rough in his language, but with a warm heart and generous feelings; true, strait forward, scorning finesse and craft and meanness. (Bunbury, 329)</blockquote>Having been relieved by Sir John Stuart, Sherbrooke went home in June 1808. He transferred to the 68th foot in May 1809, and served in the Peninsular campaign, with the local rank of lieutenant-general, as second in command to Arthur Wellesley. In recognition of his exploits in the battles of Porto and Talavera, Sherbrooke was made KCB in September 1809. Ill health again forced him to return to England the following May. In June 1811 he became lieutenant-general and on 19 August was appointed lieutenant-governor of Nova Scotia. Five days later he married Katherine (Katherina), the daughter of the Revd Reginald Pyndar, rector of Madresfield, at Areley Kings, Worcestershire.<br>
<br>From his arrival in Halifax on 16 October, Sherbrooke's governorship was dominated by war with the United States, which broke out in June 1812, and measures for the colony's defence. At first the dictates of security and commerce encouraged him to adopt a friendly stance towards the New England states where there existed hostility to the war and a willingness to continue trading with the maritime provinces of Canada by licences as well as clandestinely. This uneasy but highly profitable relationship ended in 1814 when the defeat of Napoleon in Europe induced the British authorities to act more aggressively towards the United States government by occupying part of what was to become Maine. In August Sherbrooke commanded an expeditionary force which landed at Castine and successfully subdued the region between the Penobscot and the Sainte Croix rivers. This remained a British enclave for eight months, though Sherbrooke himself returned to Halifax within four weeks. A grateful house of assembly later voted him &pound;1000 for the purchase of plate, and in January 1815 he received the GCB.<br>
<br>On 10 April 1816 Sherbrooke was commissioned governor-in-chief of British North America, and arrived at Quebec on 12 July. Confronted by bitter strife between English and French parties, which had been aggravated by the conduct of Governor Sir George Prevost during the American war, he resolved to avoid becoming drawn into partisan politics and to pursue instead a neutral, conciliatory course. His broad-church Anglicanism posed no obstacle to cultivating a cordial rapport with the influential leader of the Roman Catholic clergy, Bishop Joseph-Octave Plessis, who was given a seat on the legislative council in 1818. Another valuable political ally was Louis-Joseph Papineau, the youthful, ambitious speaker of the assembly, later the scourge of less accommodating governors. This good understanding facilitated a temporary settlement of the province's chaotic and contentious financial affairs. In 1818 detailed consideration by the lower house of the annual estimates led to the voting of supplies to cover the ordinary expenditures of government, without recognition of the assembly's disputed right to control all forms of local revenue. Unfortunately, resort to the procedure of an address, rather than a regular appropriation bill, meant that no legislative precedent was established which might have moderated future wrangling over this crucial issue. Nevertheless, despite a fierce temper and an instinctive conservatism, Sherbrooke achieved singular success in operating the constitution of Lower Canada harmoniously and gaining the confidence of all parties, to the enhancement of his own reputation.<br>
<br>Still dogged by ill health, and having been afflicted by a paralytic stroke in February 1818, Sherbrooke resigned his commission and returned that August to Britain. He was promoted general in May 1825 and lived quietly at Calverton in Nottinghamshire. He died there on 14 February 1830 and was buried at nearby Oxton, survived by his wife, who died childless on 15 May 1856.<br>
