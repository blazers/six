<span class="headword">Calandrini,  Cesar</span>  (1595&#150;1665), <span class="occ">Reformed minister</span>, was born in Stade, in Germany, on 6 February 1595, the son of Giovanni Calandrini (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1542, <i>d</i>. after 1607) and his first wife, Marie, daughter of Jean de Maistres, a wealthy Antwerp merchant. His father, who belonged to an influential Calvinist family of Italian origin, had fled Lucca in 1567 because of his Reformed faith, and lived subsequently in France, Antwerp, Germany, and then London. There, during the first years of James I's reign, Calandrini senior founded an influential merchant banking house with his son-in-law, Philip Burlamachi. Cesar appears to have been destined for a clerical career from the start. In May 1612 he matriculated at the Academy of Geneva and later attended the Calvinist Academy of Saumur. In April 1616 he was admitted as a reader to the Bodleian Library in Oxford, and he matriculated in theology at the University of Leiden on 7 November 1616. In Leiden he met his lifelong friend and correspondent, the Dutch poet and diplomat, Constantijn Huygens.<br>
<br>In late 1617 Calandrini became a trainee minister in the French church in London and in March 1618 he was ordained by the joint body of ministers from the Dutch and French churches. Their support and the backing of the apostate archbishop of Spalato, Marco Antonio de Dominis, secured Calandrini the appointment of minister to the Italian Reformed church in London. Initially, Calandrini was on excellent terms with his mentor, de Dominis, lodging with him at the Savoy Hospital. Later, after Calandrini had attended the Synod of Dort and finished his studies in theology under John Prideaux at Exeter College, Oxford, from where he graduated BD on 18 July 1620, he found it increasingly difficult to reconcile his Calvinism with de Dominis's Catholic syncretism. Before the archbishop left England for Rome he apparently denounced Calandrini to James I as a dangerous puritan. That he was a hardline Calvinist is corroborated by Anthony Wood, who described him as &#145;a puritanical theologist&#146;  (Wood, 1.393).<br>
<br>Shortly before he received his BD, Calandrini was instituted on 20 June 1620 at the rectory of Stapleford Abbots in Essex. In August 1621 he married Elizabeth Harderet, a granddaughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/40600/', "Robert Le Macon (d. 1611)")</script>, who had been minister of the London French church. It was probably through the patronage of John Prideaux that he came into contact with James Ussher, later archbishop of Armagh, whom he assisted in his scholarly activities during the latter's three-year stay in London. He became closely involved in Ussher's great protestant scheme, the <span class="italic">Bibliotheca theologica</span>, accompanying him to Ireland. Not until the collapse of Ussher's project in 1626 did Calandrini live in Stapleford Abbots.<br>
<br>Calandrini corresponded with an impressive number of leading European Calvinists, and among his English correspondents were such leading puritan divines as Herbert Palmer, John Davenport, Stephen Marshall, Thomas Gataker, Hugh Peters, and Cornelius Burgess. In 1639 he was appointed minister to the Dutch church in London, thus becoming a colleague of his stepbrother, Ambrosius Regemorter. Calandrini's excellent contacts with leading puritans such as William Kiffin and Sidrach Simpson helped to ease many of the difficulties the Dutch community in London faced during the turbulent 1640s. As the son of a protestant immigrant, and a pivotal figure in the international Calvinist republic of letters, Calandrini remained actively involved in relief work for European co-religionists until his death from the plague in London on 26 September 1665; he was buried a day later. He left at least one son, Lewis Calandrine, who had been ejected from the rectory of Stapleford Abbots in 1662.<br>
