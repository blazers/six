<span class="headword">Stone, Sir  (John) Benjamin</span>  (1838&#150;1914), <span class="occ">photographer and politician</span>, was born on 9 February 1838 at Birmingham, the son of Benjamin Stone, a glass manufacturer, and his wife, Rebecca, the daughter of Richard Matthews of Cookley, Worcestershire. Little is known about his parents, although his father's company was in Aston Manor&#151;a district that did not become part of Birmingham until 1911. After being educated at King Edward's School, New Street, Birmingham, Benjamin Stone (as he was invariably known) moved into his father's business, to which he later succeeded, the firm then being known as Stone, Fawdry, and Stone. He was well respected in his trade and was a juror at a number of important exhibitions in London, Edinburgh, and Paris. On 5 June 1867 he married Jane (<i>d</i>. 1914), the daughter of Peter Parker of Lethersdale, Yorkshire. They had four sons and two daughters. Stone was made master of the court of the Glass Sellers' Company in 1882, and he also became a partner in the paper firm of Smith, Stone, and Knight, which had large paper mills in Birmingham.<br>
<br>Stone's success in business ventures at a comparatively early age allowed him to become active in political and municipal affairs and to follow his deep interests in history, literary study, and, particularly, photography. An ardent Conservative at a time when Birmingham was a Liberal stronghold, he was elected to the town council for the working-class ward of Duddeston in 1869. For a time he was one of only two Conservative councillors in Birmingham. An assiduous member of various committees, he left the council in 1878, but returned to public life four years later, when he was elected to the Aston board of guardians. He also served on Sutton Coldfield council, and in 1886 he was chosen unanimously as the first mayor of the borough. Stone held this office for five years and was then presented with the freedom of the town. In addition he was a justice of the peace for Sutton Coldfield, Warwickshire, and Birmingham. For ten years from 1874 he was president of the Birmingham Conservative Association, and it was thanks largely to him that the party's local organization was kept up. Indeed, he remodelled it on the lines of the successful Liberal Party organization, with a system of ward committees overseen by a central executive. When Lord Randolph Churchill stood for election in Birmingham in 1884, Stone presided at the Conservative meeting which led to a notorious riot in Aston Park, following clashes between the supporters of rival candidates. Along with Lord Randolph, Sir Drummond Wolff, and Colonel Burnaby, Stone was prominent in founding the Primrose League. He was an active philanthropist in Birmingham and was a member of the Bean Club, reputedly the oldest political society in England.<br>
<br>Following Joseph Chamberlain's acrimonious split with the Liberal Party over home rule the Chamberlainites allied themselves with the Conservatives. In Birmingham this alliance came to dominate municipal and parliamentary elections, and in 1895 Stone (who had been knighted in 1892 on the recommendation of the marquess of Salisbury) was returned unopposed as MP for East Birmingham. He retired on account of ill health in 1910. While in the House of Commons, Sir Benjamin played little part in debate, but he was prominent in the social side of parliament. His camera came to be an introduction to men of all parties, and it was as a photographer that he was best known to the public. Dubbed the Knight of the Camera by <span class="italic">The Spectator</span>, he had begun collecting photographs in a systematic way from the late 1860s. In the early 1880s he found he could no longer buy the photographs he wanted, and after making a study of the medium he started to take his own. In an interview he later explained:<blockquote>my photographic work has been done with the intention of securing records for my scientific investigation, and not merely for the pleasure of a photograph in itself. I look upon photography as being a most valuable aid to education because pictorial illustration is by far the easiest mode and pleasant manner of obtaining instruction. (<span class="italic">Tit-Bits</span>, 16 April 1898)</blockquote>In 1897 Stone's plan for a national photographic record association, occasioned by Queen Victoria's jubilee, was taken up; between then and 1910, 4478 prints were deposited in the British Museum. The founder of the Photographic Record Association, an organization of photographers, Stone was also the first president of the Birmingham Photographic Society. He had a deep concern for British heritage, and among his photographs were recorded many British customs and festivals, parliament and parliamentarians, Westminster Abbey, and royal palaces. His photographs of the coronations of Edward VII and George V caused him to become known as the royal photographer. Seven years after his death the trustees of his estate presented to Birmingham Reference Library his collection of 22,000 photographs, 600 stereographs, 2500 lantern slides, 17,000 glass negatives, 50 albums of collected prints, and 50 volumes of press cuttings relating to his work. These remain in the care of the city's library and archive departments. This massive collection includes topographical and other photographs relating to Europe, North and South America, India, and Australasia. Stone was widely travelled; a fellow of both the Royal Geographical Society and the Royal Historical Society and a member of the Geological Society, the Linnean Society, and the Society of Arts, he was never without his camera and notebook on his journeys. His notes led him to write a number of books, such as <span class="italic">A Summer Holiday in Spain</span> (1873) and <span class="italic">Children in Norway</span> (1882). Among other works were a description of his tour of Japan, a fairy tale for children, and a history of Lichfield Cathedral. In 1890 he went as photographer with the Royal Astronomical Society to Brazil; while on this trip he persuaded rebels to postpone their shelling of government positions so that he could photograph them. Sir Benjamin also visited the West Indies, South Africa, Syria, Egypt, and Palestine.<br>
<br>Stone died at his home, The Grange, in Erdington, Birmingham, on 2 July 1914. His wife was seriously ill and did not know of his death; she died four days later and was buried with him in Sutton Coldfield graveyard on 7 July 1914.<br>
