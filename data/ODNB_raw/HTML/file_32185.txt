<span class="headword">Burnell,  Charles Desborough</span>  (1876&#150;1969), <span class="occ">oarsman</span>, was born at Notting Hill, London, on 13 January 1876, the only child of George Edward Burnell, stockbroker, of Notting Hill, and his wife, Harriet Desborough. He was educated at Eton College and Magdalen College, Oxford, before becoming senior partner in the stockbroking firm of Wise and Burnell. A giant of a man, he showed exceptional promise as a schoolboy oarsman and won the ladies' plate at Henley royal regatta in 1894; at Oxford he was a member of four consecutive winning crews in the Oxford&#150;Cambridge boat race from 1895 to 1898. In 1896 conditions for the race were appalling and Oxford, having lost the toss, chose to tuck in behind Cambridge rather than attempt to race alongside them on the outside of the Hammersmith bend. Though they were at one time a length and a half behind, they overlapped at Barnes Bridge and then, forcing Cambridge out into the rougher water, won by two-fifths of a length, at that time the closest finish in the history of the race except for the 1877 dead heat.<br>
<br>Burnell won the Grand Challenge Cup each year from 1898 to 1901, rowing for his college in 1899 and for Leander on the other occasions. In all but the last of those four years he also won the stewards' challenge cup, the premier prize for coxless fours. Still in Leander colours, he won the Cork international eights in 1902 and 1903. He was persuaded to come out of retirement to join the Leander eight which represented Great Britain in the 1908 Olympic regatta at Henley-on-Thames; the eight beat Belgium in the final to win the gold medal&#151;a feat equalled by Burnell's son <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/106201/', "Richard Desborough [Dickie] Burnell (1917&#150;1995)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/102570/', "Bushnell, Bertram Harold Thomas (1921&#150;2010)")</script>], also at Henley, in the 1948 Olympics. Don (as Burnell was called by rowing men) used to say that in the fully forward position he rubbed the outside of his shoulders against the inside of his knees, an extraordinary illustration of how widely styles differ. Steve Fairbairn, the ultimate advocate of the unorthodox, once described Burnell as the best oarsman he had ever seen.<br>
<br>After the First World War, in 1919 Burnell was elected a steward of the royal regatta; he joined the committee of management the following year and umpired at the regatta for over forty years. He umpired the university boat race from 1927 to 1930 and was president of Leander and of the Henley Rowing Club: he held the latter office until his death.<br>
<br>Burnell joined the London rifle brigade as a territorial in 1894 and retired with the rank of major in 1913. After rejoining the army on the outbreak of war, as a captain, he commanded a company in France and was wounded at the second battle of Ypres and on other occasions. He commanded the 1st battalion of the regiment between 1917 and 1919, was twice mentioned in dispatches, and appointed DSO (1919) for services in France and Flanders. During the Second World War he served as a major in the upper Thames patrol of the Home Guard. He played a major part in local government, initially as vice-chairman of Walton and Weybridge urban district council and for over thirty years as chairman of the Wokingham rural district council. He became a JP in 1934 and was deputy lieutenant of the county of Berkshire in 1936. He was appointed OBE in 1954 for services in Berkshire.<br>
<br>Burnell married in 1903 Jessie Backhouse (1877&#150;1966), daughter of Dr Frederick Thomas Hulke. They had two sons and two daughters. One daughter, Mary Balding, was appointed MBE in 1978. One of Burnell's grandsons (Peter, the son of Richard) gained an Oxford blue in 1962. The family was only the fourth to have had a father, son, and grandson row in the university boat race, all for Oxford. A special parade was held in the Guildhall, London, in 1964 &#145;to mark the seventieth anniversary of his entry into the London rifle brigade and as a token of the universal esteem in which he is held&#146;. Burnell died at Blewbury, Berkshire, on 3 October 1969.<br>
