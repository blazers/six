<span class="headword">Villiers,  Christopher</span>, first earl of Anglesey  (<em>d.</em> 1630), <span class="occ">courtier</span>, was the third son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28292/', "Sir George Villiers (c.1544&#150;1606)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28288/', "Villiers, Sir Edward")</script>] of Brooksby, Leicestershire, and his second wife, Mary Beaumont (<i>c</i>.1570&#150;1632), later countess of Buckingham in her own right. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28299/', "John Villiers, Viscount Purbeck")</script>, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28293/', "George Villiers, first duke of Buckingham")</script>, were his brothers and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28288/', "Sir Edward Villiers")</script> was his half-brother. Christopher, though &#145;an unattractive and unintelligent&#146; youth  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>), shared the good fortune of the family consequent upon the rise of his brother George. In February 1617 he was appointed gentleman of the bedchamber to James I (though not sworn until January 1618), and on 7 March following he was granted an annuity of &pound;200 a year. In December 1617 Sir Robert Naunton, who had no sons, was appointed secretary of state on condition that he made Villiers his heir; the latter consequently received lands worth &pound;500 a year. He was also promised &pound;800 a year out of the monopoly for gold and silver thread, but actually received only &pound;150 during the whole of its existence. In addition to these sources he received considerable sums from the patent for ale houses, and his malpractices in this connection formed the subject of charges against him in parliament, which were, however, abandoned. In 1620 it was said that Villiers was in line for the office of master of the robes, which would have secured his place at court, and his access to its bounty. <br>
<br>Villiers's next step was to secure a suitable heiress as a wife; ineffectual suit was made first for the only daughter of Sir Sebastian Harvey, lord mayor of London, and then for Elizabeth Norris, daughter of the earl of Berkshire. He eventually married Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1662), daughter of Thomas Sheldon of Howley, Leicestershire. On 23 March 1623 he was created Baron Villiers of Daventry and earl of Anglesey, the patent passing on 18 April. His mediocre abilities prevented his employment in any important position, and he himself acknowledged to his brother the duke that &#145;his want of preferment proceeded from his own unworthiness rather than from the duke's unwillingness&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1627&#150;8</i>, 327). His weakness appears to have been alcohol, and in 1625 it was rumoured that he had been &#145;banished the court &hellip; the king saying he would have no drunkards of his chamber&#146;  (GEC, <span class="italic">Peerage</span>, 1.132n). On 6 December 1628 he was appointed keeper of Hampton Court, and on 4 March 1629 of Bushey Park. About the same time he was said to have purchased the reversion of the office of chancellor of the exchequer from Edward Barrett, Lord Newburgh. He died on 3 April 1630 at Windsor, and was buried on 12 April in St George's Chapel. His widow married Benjamin Weston in 1641. Villiers's only son, Charles (<i>d</i>. 1661), succeeded as second earl of Anglesey. On 25 April 1648 he married Mary, widow of his cousin William Villiers, Viscount Grandison, and mother of Barbara Villiers. He died childless and was buried at St Martin-in-the-Fields, London, on 4 February 1661. His honours became extinct, and the estates passed to his sister Anne, widow of Thomas Savile, earl of Sussex.<br>
