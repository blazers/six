<span class="headword">Phillips <span class="st"> [Phillip]</span>,  John</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1594<span class="mult">x</span>1617), <span class="occ">author</span>, was the son of Robart Phillip, a clothworker and member of the London livery company associated with that trade who appears to have had patronage connections with Katherine, Lady Bertie, duchess of Suffolk. He was educated at Queens' College, Cambridge,  (J. Phillips, <span class="italic">Commemoration of the Right Noble and Vertuous ladye, Margrit Duglasis</span>, title-page), but took no degree. In a tract dated 1578 he is described as a &#145;student in divinitie&#146;  (Arber, <span class="italic">Regs. Stationers</span>, 2.327); some of his writings also suggest formal training in the classics. Phillips's career as a writer of prose and verse began in the mid-1560s at a time when commercial forces and developments in the printing industry were significantly transforming the nature and status of the literary profession. Although he evidently enjoyed the patronage of Lord Lumley, to whom he presented two works in manuscript (&#145;Christian and comfortable counsails&#146; and &#145;A closet of counsell&#146;, BL, Royal MS 7.A. xii, fols. 168<i>r</i>&#150;198<i>v</i>, and 18A. xlii), he also seems to have written on commission for various publishers in the capital. His &#339;uvre, which includes ballads, broadside epitaphs, religious admonitions, miniature books of prayers, and short patriotic and moralistic tracts, as well as a metrical romance and a play, is typical of the output of an emerging class of semi-professional pamphleteers, dramatists, and rhymesters. His first published work appears to have been <span class="italic">The Commodye of Pacient and Meeke Grissill</span>, a dramatization of the last novel of Boccaccio's <span class="italic">Decameron</span>, entered in the Stationers' register in 1565&#150;6. The same year he also contributed exhortatory verses to a series of reports about the trial of several witches at the Chelmsford assizes. In the nineteenth century these were mistakenly attributed to a John Philip, who was thereby given an illusory identity separate from that of John Phillips.<br>
<br>During the 1570s, 1580s, and 1590s Phillips produced a number of single-sheet epitaphs mourning the deaths of several civic dignitaries and members of the aristocracy: the wife of Alexander Avenon, lord mayor of London; Alderman Sir William Garrat; Margaret Douglas, countess of Lennox; and Henry Wriothesley, second earl of Southampton. In addition he composed four more extended commemorative elegies modelled on the poems in the <span class="italic">Mirrour for Magistrates</span>, in which the ghosts of deceased worthies (Dame Helen Branch, wife of Sir John Branch, lord mayor of London, the countess of Lennox, Sir Philip Sidney, and Sir Christopher Hatton) recount their own achievements. These decades also saw the publication of <span class="italic">A friendly larum, or faythfull warnynge &hellip; discoveryng the acte and malicious myndes of those obstinate and rebellious papists</span> ([1570]), an equally chauvinistic ballad entitled <span class="italic">A Cold Pye for the Papists</span> ([1570?]), an effusive exhortation to loyalty to Elizabeth I (<span class="italic">The Tryumph of True Subjectes</span>, 1588), and a pious, journalistic account of an eleven-year-old schoolboy from Walsham-le-Willows in Suffolk who fell into a trance for ten days and awoke to deliver a series of dire prophetic predictions about the fate of iniquitous England (<span class="italic">The Wonderfull Worke of God Shewed upon a Chylde, William Withers</span>, 1581). A &#145;historycall novel&#146; about Cleomines and Juliet appeared from his pen in 1577. He may also be responsible for producing a broadside ballad, dated about 1570, <span class="italic">A Mervaylous Straunge Deformed Swyne</span>, about a beast farrowed in Denmark, and verses answering the slanders of the papists &#145;against Christs syllie flock&#146; appended to a 1581 translation of a sermon by Calvin.<br>
<br>Several of Phillips's works are no longer extant: these include a set of Latin verses on the &#145;great earthquake&#146; of 6 April 1580 (<span class="italic">Quaedam de terrae motu</span>), <span class="italic">Rudimentes of reason gathered out of the preceptes of the worthie and learned philosopher Periander</span> (1578), <span class="italic">A Lantern to Light Ladies &hellip; by Example of the Empress Florence</span> (n.d.), and <span class="italic">Precious Perles of Perfecte Godlines</span>, a tract begun by Lady Frances Abergavenny and completed by Phillips in 1577. The latter work was no doubt similar in character to his <span class="italic">The Coat Armour of a Christian</span> ([1584]) and his <span class="italic">Perfect Path to Paradice</span>, a duodecimo collection of supplications and meditations set forth as &#145;a spirituall weapon to beate down sinne, sathan, and all the power of hell&#146;  (title-page) four years later. This tract, to which an abridged version of his <span class="italic">Sommon to repentance</span> ([1584]) was appended in later impressions, was to be his most successful work. It was reprinted in 1590 and then again posthumously in 1617 and 1626. The publishers of the seventeenth-century editions were responsible for fostering the mistaken belief by subsequent bibliographers that Phillips was an ordained minister. The label &#145;late preacher of the word of God&#146; was probably a piece of spurious title-page publicity designed to increase sales of this quasi-clerical work. The date of his death, which preceded 1617, is unknown but may be supposed to have followed the cessation of his publishing activity in 1594.<br>
<br>Another <a name="cosubject_22160"></a><span class="headword">John Phillips</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1640)<span class="occ"></span> was educated at several colleges in Cambridge, being admitted a pensioner at Emmanuel College on 15 June 1594. He received the degrees BA, MA, and BD in 1596/7, 1600, and 1606 respectively and in the last year was instituted vicar of Faversham, Kent, a living he served diligently until his death in 1640. From 1615 he also delivered a weekly lecture on market day, a labour for which he received little financial reward until a small legacy supporting it was augmented by the mayor and jurats of the town to &#145;a convenient stipend&#146; in or about 1625  (<span class="italic">Way to Heaven</span>, sig. B2<i>v</i>). That year he reluctantly published <span class="italic">The Way to Heaven</span>, an expansion of a funeral sermon preached at the burial of Edward Lapworth, a Cambridge-educated physician practising in the parish who conformed to the Church of England but had well known Catholic sympathies (and who should not be confused with Edward Lapworth MD Oxon., 1574&#150;1636). In 1629 a catechism entitled <span class="italic">The Christians ABC</span> appeared, a work provoked by consideration of &#145;the advantage the Common Adversarie hath gotten by their pettie Pamphlets&#146;  (sig. A4<i>r</i>) and intended for the edification of his flock. In his will, dated 16 April and proved on 13 July 1640, Phillips left legacies to three daughters and made provision for a short address to be delivered by his curate at his burial.<br>
