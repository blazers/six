<span class="headword">Greswold,  Edward</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1594?, <em>d.</em> 1633), <span class="occ">religious recluse</span>, was probably baptized on 5 August 1594 at Tanworth, Warwickshire. He was the son of Thomas Greswold (<i>d</i>. 1598/9), landowner, and his wife, Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1645), daughter and heir of Benedict Shuckburgh of Cubbington, Warwickshire. His father, who owned significant property in and around Solihull, died when Greswold was a child and in July 1602 his mother married William Lisle of Evenley, Northamptonshire. Although a younger son, Greswold was apparently well provided for and lived at Cubbington, a manor owned by his mother's family, with his wife, Margaret. They had at least eight children.<br>
<br>Greswold's career provides an intriguing insight into the puritan community in early Stuart England, and the relationship between godly protestants within the established church and those who rejected this church entirely. It also offers a bizarre illustration of religious extremism before the civil war. His story was recorded by two contemporaries, the puritan minister Samuel Clarke, who found Greswold's actions repugnant, and the royalist gentleman Sir William Dugdale, who related Greswold's story as a curiosity and seemed more concerned with the rightful descent of the Greswold property. Clarke recalled that Greswold was a respected member of the godly community in Warwickshire during the 1620s. About 1629, however, he came into contact with the separatist preacher John Canne, who &#145;began to seduce him from his former opinions&#146;  (Clarke, 112). In later writings Canne published his arguments that Christians should be &#145;separated from the world, and the false worship and the ways thereof&#146;  (Canne). The majority of English puritans rejected this radical view, but it did appeal to a desire among godly protestants to create a church of true Christians untouched by the &#145;superstitious&#146; habits of the wider world. It appears that Greswold took Canne's ideas about separation from the Church of England to their most extreme conclusion. He decided first that he could not attend the local church, second that he could not listen to any &#145;conformable minister&#146; and from there &#145;fell to separation&#146;  (Clarke, 112). He eventually came to believe &#145;that all civil society with others, defiled him&#146;  (ibid.), locked himself and his family in his house, and instructed his servants to bring them food through the windows. Local ministers, including Clarke, came to remonstrate with him but were ignored. When one of his children died he placed the body in the next room and later ordered a servant to bring moss which he placed in the cracks between the rooms to stop the smell. This was only discovered when a justice of the peace &#145;sent some with command to break open his chamber door&#146;  (ibid., 113), and Greswold and his family were found &#145;with their haire, and nailes growne very long, [and] their clothes almost rotten on their backes&#146;  (ibid.).<br>
<br>When released neither Greswold nor his children, &#145;being so tutored by him&#146;  (Clarke, 113), would speak to anyone. His children were sent to friends and eventually recovered but Greswold never wavered from his beliefs. He took to his bed, ignoring all those who came to him and &#145;intreated, counselled, threatn'd, and prayed&#146;  (ibid., 114). He turned his face to the wall and spoke not a word until his death &#145;which was not long after&#146;  (ibid.), in 1633. He was succeeded by his son John, who died in 1640.<br>
