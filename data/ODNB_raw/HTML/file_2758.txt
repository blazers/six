<span class="headword">Bodley,  Laurence</span>  (1547/8&#150;1615), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, was the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/53707/', "John Bodley (c.1520&#150;1591)")</script>, an Exeter merchant, and his wife, Joan, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Hone (<i>d</i>. 1586). Laurence was the brother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2759/', "Sir Thomas Bodley")</script>, founder of the Bodleian Library, and of the soldier <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2757/', "Sir Josias Bodley")</script>. Their father, a man of strongly protestant convictions, helped finance the government's suppression of the western rebellion of 1549, and during the reign of Mary took his family to Frankfurt, and then to Geneva, where he opened a printing office and late in 1557 became an elder of the exiles' church. The records of those taking refuge in the city mention the young Laurence.<br>
<br>The Bodley family returned to England in 1559, settling in London, though Laurence soon left for Oxford. He became a student at Christ Church in 1561, graduating BA in 1566 and MA in 1568. By 1575 he was back in the Swiss confederation as a student of the University of Basel. His talent and his commitment to Calvinistic church discipline were already well developed, for on 13 March 1576, William Barlow (probably the future archdeacon of Salisbury who had been at Oxford with Bodley) wrote to Z&uuml;rich a letter of introduction on his behalf, trusting that the pastor, Joseph Simler, would treat him kindly: &#145;He is a man of small stature, but of distinguished erudition and probity, and exceedingly partial to your church&#146;  (Robinson, 270). It seems, however, that Bodley did not stay long; before 24 August he had returned to England with a letter from Rodolph Gualter which he delivered to Archbishop Parker.<br>
<br>Bodley's religious sympathies did not prevent his becoming a notable pluralist. On 27 October 1579 he was instituted to the rectory of Hinton St George, Somerset, on the presentation of Amias Paulet. On 21 March 1580 he compounded for the first fruits of the rectory of Sampford Peverill, Devon, and on 10 August 1580 for those of the canonry of Worminster (not to be confused with Warminster) in the diocese of Bath and Wells. He also held Seavington St Michael, resigning in 1580, and on 17 April 1581 he compounded for the first fruits of the rectory of Seavenhampton, Gloucestershire. The yearly value of these livings in 1581 was more than &pound;50. But Bodley continued to accrue ecclesiastical preferments. He was admitted to the crown living of Shobrook, Devon, on 25 September 1582, and is thought to have built the rectory there. In 1585 he was occupying a house in the cathedral close at Exeter, having been instituted to a canonry. In 1602 the dean and chapter gave eighty-one early manuscripts which were then in the keeping of Exeter Cathedral Library to the library newly founded at Oxford by Thomas Bodley. Outstanding among them was the Leofric missal (now MS Bodley 579), a composite volume of materials from the ninth to the eleventh centuries notable for containing what are probably the earliest English examples of drawings in coloured line. The gift may very well have been inspired by Laurence Bodley, who himself in 1610 gave the large sum of &pound;20 to his brother's library.<br>
<br>On 30 May 1613 Bodley was admitted DD at Christ Church, Oxford, to which college he donated books. Perhaps it was for the pursuit of his studies that he bought &#145;my best cristall spectacles which alone cost mee fifteene shillings&#146;  (TNA: PRO, PROB 11/125, fol. 465<i>v</i>). In his later years Bodley and a fellow canon named Leach were rewarded by Exeter city chamber with sugar loaves, &#145;in approbation of their pains in the morning lecture at St Peters&#146;  (Rose-Troup, 724). He also inherited both money and property from his brother Sir Thomas in 1613. Unmarried, he was able to bequeath substantial sums to brothers, sisters, and other members of his family. Bodley left books on divinity to Exeter Cathedral Library and provided &pound;400 for the purchase of land to fund a third lectureship for the city. The lecturer was to be chosen by the mayor and corporation, but should be &#145;allowed for his sufficiencie and conformitie accordinge to the lawes of the Realme either by the Lord Bishop of the diocesse or by the Lord Archbishop of Canterburie&#146;  (TNA: PRO, PROB 11/125, fol. 466). The subsequent choice of John Hazard to be the first lecturer led to much contention between the bishop and the town. Bodley died on 19 April 1615, aged sixty-seven, and was buried in Exeter Cathedral close on 9 May.<br>
