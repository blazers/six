<span class="headword">Thorburn,  Robert Forrester</span>  (1821&#150;1898), <span class="occ">merchant</span>, the only son of George Thorburn (<i>c</i>.1795&#150;1871), a tea merchant, and Anne, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Forrester, was born at 5 Fyfe Place, Leith, on 13 April 1821. Nothing is known of his education but in February 1847 he was listed as a clerk in Canton (Guangzhou), employed by Maclean, Dearie &amp; Co., and he spent the best part of the next fifty years on the China coast. From 1850 he worked in Shanghai for Turner &amp; Co., but left them at the end of December 1860. On 11 April 1861, probably on his return from a trip to Britain, he began, with the Revd W. R. Beach, the Revd Samuel W. Bonney, and Dr W. Dickson, what was then a singular and possibly dangerous overland trip from Canton to Hankou. The travellers intended to take advantage of the new treaty, which afforded the right to travel in the Chinese interior, and were keen to explore the possibilities of the route as a possible conduit for the tea trade. Canton itself was still under British occupation, and more than once the travellers were met by crowds shouting <i>Sha</i> (&#145;kill&#146;), but on the whole the 41-day journey was smooth and the crowds just intensely curious. Bonney rhapsodized about the potential for railway development along the route, but Thorburn left no record of his impressions, and instead of going on with the missionaries to Nanking (Nanjing), then controlled by the Taiping insurgents, he stayed briefly in the newly opened treaty port of Hankou.<br>
<br>In 1878, after several years as an independent merchant in Shanghai, Thorburn was appointed secretary of the Shanghai municipal council (SMC). The climax of his quiet but firm custodianship of the council was the jubilee celebration in November 1893, which marked the fiftieth anniversary of the settlement. From its shaky start in 1843 the British-dominated settlement had grown to encompass the heart of the growing metropolis of Shanghai. &#145;In what region of the earth is not Shanghai known?&#146; asked the banners strung across the settlement's streets during the celebration and, more menacingly, &#145;Shanghai guards its own&#146;  (<span class="italic">Jubilee of Shanghai</span>, 44). The secretary headed the administration that did this guarding for the smug settler oligarchy, which in turn provided the elected councillors and which made immense fortunes from land speculation in and around the international settlement. Thorburn was unusual among long-term residents in not profiting so well out of land, and the secretaryship might well have been an act of charity for the owner of an ailing merchant house.<br>
<br>In 1897 Thorburn resigned owing to ill health, on a generous pension of &pound;500 per annum. He returned to his native Leith, where he died of chronic diarrhoea at his home, 12 Hermitage Place, on 17 September 1898, leaving his estate to his four unmarried sisters. He was buried in South Leith parish churchyard on 22 September. A memorial stained-glass window was ordered from Britain by the SMC and placed in the south aisle of Holy Trinity Cathedral, Shanghai.<br>
<br>Thorburn's successor, J. O. P. Bland, was a more bellicose and self-conscious agent of British imperialism in China, but such forward policies were either unsuccessful&#151;China coast lobbyists (the &#145;China hands&#146;) failed to secure a Yangtze (Yangzi) protectorate&#151;or else they provoked violent responses from the Chinese population of Shanghai, such as the 1905 &#145;Mixed Court riot&#146;. Shanghai's rise to international prominence was rooted in the previous decades of basic stability after the turmoil of the Taiping uprising (1850&#150;65). Under the quiet handling of Alex Thorburn, as he was familiarly known, the SMC, the principal agency of British settler power in China, had grown greatly year by year in strength, capability, and ambition.<br>
