<span class="headword">Probyn, Sir  Dighton Macnaghten</span>  (1833&#150;1924), <span class="occ">army officer and courtier</span>, was born in London on 21 January 1833, the third of six sons of George Probyn, captain in the East India naval service, and his wife, Alicia (<i>d</i>. 1864), the daughter of Sir Francis Workman-Macnaghten. Her brother was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17705/', "Sir William Macnaghten (1793&#150;1841)")</script>, and this family connection enabled Probyn, following schooling at the Revd C. Worsley's at Finchley, to obtain a cornet's commission in the 6th Bengal light cavalry in 1849, when only sixteen. In 1852 he transferred to the 2nd Punjab cavalry in the Punjab frontier force, then commanded by Samuel James Browne, inventor of the sword belt.<br>
<br>Probyn served with his regiment during the siege of Delhi in 1857, repeatedly distinguishing himself. He later accompanied his regiment in the force dispatched for the relief of Agra, where he captured an enemy standard and was recommended for the VC, awarded to him in 1857. The citation by General Hope Grant, commanding the force, described Probyn as: &#145;skilful in the use of his sword and spear and an excellent horseman, his active courage and coolness in conflict have borne him safely through many combats&#146;  (dispatch, 10 Jan 1858). He transferred to the 1st Sikh irregular cavalry, with which he served throughout the operations to relieve Cawnpore and Lucknow and to drive the rebels out of Oudh, first as second in command, and then as commanding officer in 1858. The regiment soon became known as Probyn's Horse. Probyn was made CB in 1858.<br>
<br>In 1860 a joint Anglo-French expedition was mounted in response to the Chinese refusal to abide by the treaty of Tientsin (Tianjin) (June 1858), whereby China had agreed to accept a resident minister from each of the two countries at Peking (Beijing). However, when the two ministers designate arrived at the mouth of the Peiho (Beihe) River in the Gulf of Pecheli (Beizhili), escorted by a fleet commanded by Admiral Hope, their way upriver was barred by the Taku (Dagu) forts on 17 June 1859. Permission to proceed further was refused, and eventually it was decided by the French and British governments to enforce the terms of the treaty.<br>
<br>Lieutenant-General Hope Grant was made the overall commander. The British contingent, of both British and Indian troops, included only three cavalry regiments, two of them Indian and irregular&#151;Probyn's and Fane's Horse. All were required to volunteer, which Probyn's, mostly Sikhs, did to a man. They then marched to Calcutta from Lucknow to embark, covering 600 miles in eighteen days. They sailed for China in May 1860. Reporting back to the duke of Cambridge, Hope Grant praised the two irregular cavalry regiments and their commanders, &#145;two excellent officers, Major Fane and Major Probyn&#146;  (H. Knollys, <span class="italic">Incidents in the China War of 1860</span>, 1875).<br>
<br>Probyn and his regiment added to their laurels in China. The cavalry showed to advantage during the advance to Peking, both in reconnaissance and in shock action, which the Chinese Tartar cavalry tried to avoid. Probyn's regiment returned to India in November 1860, after what had been a very well-conducted campaign, Probyn receiving the brevet of lieutenant-colonel and being mentioned in dispatches.<br>
<br>Probyn's reputation, already high in the Indian army, was enhanced by his conduct in China. He had led several charges on his horse Clear-the-Line. In 1861 he was rewarded by his regiment's being taken onto the regular establishment as the 11th Bengal cavalry, remaining known unofficially as Probyn's Horse. Shortly after its return from China the regiment was informed that it had been paid twice. This was disputed, but until the matter was settled the duplicate pay was lodged in the regimental treasure chest. Nothing more was heard from the army pay department, and after two years the money was used to establish a regimental stud farm in the Punjab, which came to be known as Probynabad. The first Arab stallion at the stud was Probyn's Clear-the-Line.<br>
<br>Probyn commanded his regiment in the Ambela campaign in 1863, his last active service. In 1870, as a colonel, he was chosen as equerry to Prince Alfred, duke of Edinburgh, Queen Victoria's second son, during the prince's tour of India, and in 1872 he was appointed equerry to the prince of Wales, whom he accompanied on his tour of India in 1875. Probyn had been promoted major-general (15 July 1870), but his career as a soldier had ended, and that of courtier had begun. In 1901, on Edward VII's accession, he was made privy councillor and keeper of the privy purse. After the king's death in 1910 Probyn became comptroller of Queen Alexandra's household. In his biography of Edward VII, Sir Sidney Lee comments on Probyn's competence, fidelity, and faculty for rigorous finance. He took a prominent part in advising the king over the development of the Sandringham estate. On 25 April 1872 he married his first cousin, Letitia Maria, daughter of Thomas Robarts Thellusson. They had no children and she died on 17 January 1900. After his wife's death it was believed that he was on the verge of marrying Charlotte Knollys (Queen Alexandra's principal lady in waiting), who was deeply attached to him, but he did not marry again.<br>
<br>Probyn was promoted full general on the half-pay list on 1 December 1888. He was made KCSI in 1876, KCB in 1887, GCVO in 1896, GCB (civil) in 1902, GCB (military) in 1910 and GCSI in 1911. He was made a companion of the Imperial Service Order in 1903, and in 1904 was appointed honorary colonel of Probyn's Horse, an appointment he held until his death aged ninety-one. He died on 20 June 1924, at Sandringham, Norfolk, and was buried at Kensal Green cemetery. He left no memoirs or papers, but his extensive correspondence with Field Marshal Lord Birdwood, who served many years in Probyn's Horse, survived in the British Library oriental and India Office collections.<br>
