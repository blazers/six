<div class="para">
<span class="headword">O'Beirne,  Thomas Lewis</span>  (1749&#150;1823), <span class="occ">Church of Ireland bishop of Meath</span>, was born a Roman Catholic in Farnagh, co. Longford, the son of Lewis O'Beirne, farmer, of Longford, and Margaret O'Meagher of Cloona, co. Tipperary. As several generations of his family had been educated abroad, and his grand-uncle, Thomas O'Beirne, was bishop of the Catholic diocese of Ardagh (1739&#150;47), it can be assumed that the O'Beirnes were reasonably circumstanced. Following his early education at Ardagh diocesan school, in 1763 Thomas was sent to the Coll&egrave;ge des Lombards in Paris, where he performed well academically. Many Irish students at the college, his brother Denis included, became Catholic priests; O'Beirne had two other brothers, one of whom joined the East India Company, and at least two sisters. It is not clear if it was Thomas's intention to become a priest, but, after his return home to recuperate from illness in 1768, a chance meeting with John Hinchcliffe, the Church of England bishop of Peterborough, set O'Beirne on the journey that was to result in his making his recantation, taking orders, and entering Trinity College, Cambridge, as a ten-year man in 1773. He received a BD degree in 1783.<br>
<br>O'Beirne's first benefice was the college living of Grendon, Northamptonshire, which he held for two years until he was appointed chaplain in the fleet under Lord Howe in 1776. This brought him to America, where he preached a striking discourse at St Paul's, New York, the only church which was preserved from the flames during the calamitous fire of September 1776. On his return to England, O'Beirne vindicated the brothers Howe against criticism of their conduct in the tract <span class="italic">A Candid and Impartial Narrative of the Transactions of the Fleet under Lord Howe</span> (1779) by impugning the accuracy of the information they were given. Lord Howe was instrumental in securing him the crown living of West Deeping in Lincolnshire in 1779, but his introduction to Lord Fitzwilliam and other Rockingham whigs led him to write in 1780 for the periodical <span class="italic">The Englishman</span>, and to contribute to a daily newspaper a series of articles critical of Lord North, the first six of which were reprinted as a pamphlet. Having proved himself as a controversialist, O'Beirne produced three further pamphlets anonymously in quick succession&#151;<span class="italic">A Short History of the Last Session of Parliament</span> (1780), <span class="italic">Considerations on the Late Disturbances, by a Consistent Whig</span> (1780), and <span class="italic">Considerations on the Principles of Naval Discipline and Courts-Martial, in which the Doctrines of the House of Commons and the Conduct of the Courts-Martial on Admiral Keppel and Sir Hugh Palliser are Compared</span> (1781). For the theatre he adapted from the French play <span class="italic">Le dissipateur</span>, by Destouches, a comedy entitled <span class="italic">The Generous Impostor</span>, which ran for seven nights at Drury Lane in November 1780. O'Beirne assisted the duchess of Devonshire in translating and adapting for the English stage two dramas from the French, but they met with no success. He was also the author of an ode to Lord Northampton, and of some minor contributions to the <span class="italic">Rolliad</span>, most of which, he reflected later, were &#145;deservedly consigned to oblivion&#146;  (<span class="italic">Public Characters</span>, 159).<br>
<br>Having proved his value to the whigs, in 1782 O'Beirne attended the duke of Portland, the viceroy of Ireland, as chaplain and private secretary. While in Ireland he secured a promise of &#145;the living of Longford&#146;  (<span class="italic">Correspondence of Edmund Burke</span>, 5.29) on the demise of its incumbent. He had to wait nine years; in the meantime Edmund Burke's intercession ensured the restoration of the stipend he had received from Earl Fitzwilliam prior to his Irish appointment. This guaranteed that O'Beirne remained active in whig circles, and he became Portland's private secretary once again in 1783 when that statesman became the first lord of the Treasury. This time Portland ensured that O'Beirne was looked after: on his last day in office the duke gave him the valuable livings of Whittingham and Stanfordham. These enabled O'Beirne to provide for himself and for his wife, Jane, the only surviving child of Francis Stuart, brother of the eighth earl of Moray. They married on 17 November 1783, and had one son and two daughters.<br>
<br>Out of power, O'Beirne played an important part in the whigs' efforts to force William Pitt from office by galvanizing opposition to the prime minister's scheme for a commercial union with Ireland in 1785. He wrote <span class="italic">A Reply to the Late Treasury Pamphlet Entitled &#145;The Proposed System of Trade with Ireland Explained&#146;</span> (1785), and was responsible for liaising with and supplying the Irish opposition with ideas and materials. Health problems during the winter of 1785 obliged him to spend some time on the continent, but this did not prove efficacious and he returned to Longford, resigned his English livings, and, on their becoming vacant in 1791, took up the rich benefices of Templemichael, which he had been promised in 1782, and Mohill. He spent the next three years ministering in the parish in which he was born and in which his brother Denis was the Catholic parish priest. His ambition was the episcopal bench, and the way was cleared when he became first chaplain and private secretary to Earl Fitzwilliam upon his appointment as viceroy in 1794. Shortly afterwards O'Beirne was rewarded by the bishopric of Ossory, to which he was consecrated at Christ Church, Dublin, on 1 February 1795.<br>
<br>O'Beirne's hope that &#145;a change of disposition towards them in the government&#146;  (O'Beirne to Portland, August 1794, Portland MSS) would induce propertied Catholics to align themselves with the crown was negated by the recall of Fitzwilliam. This so depressed him that he vowed &#145;to devote himself to the duties&#146;  (O'Beirne to Fitzwilliam, 30 March 1796, Fitzwilliam MSS) of his diocese, and to this end he convened meetings of his clergy to debate theological issues. There was no escaping politics, however, and as Ireland became more disorderly, O'Beirne's disenchantment with the Irish whigs grew. He felt at the time that Grattan had pressed the question of Catholic emancipation with too much vigour in 1794&#150;5; by the spring of 1797 he freely attributed Catholic disaffection to Grattan's advocacy of policies which O'Beirne deemed to be more appropriate to a United Irishman than to a whig, and he sundered his connections with the Irish whigs.<br>
<br>O'Beirne's growing conservatism, which facilitated his translation from Ossory to the more lucrative diocese of Meath in December 1798, was also manifest in his advocacy of the inclusion of protestants on the board of the Catholic seminary at Maynooth and, when an act of union was being agitated, in his proposal that the Church of Ireland and the Church of England should also be unified. His contention that this would render the Church of Ireland &#145;unassailable to our adversaries&#146; reflected his intensifying perception that his church was a &#145;persecuted church&#146;  (O'Beirne to D. Ryder, first earl of Harrowby, 12 Nov 1816, Harrowby MSS). He contrived to defend its position in a number of controversial tracts&#151;<span class="italic">A Letter to Dr Troy</span> (1805), <span class="italic">A Letter from an Irish Dignitary &hellip; on the Subject of Tithes</span> (1807), <span class="italic">A Letter to Canning on his Proposed Motion on Catholic Emancipation</span> (1812), and <span class="italic">A Letter to the Earl of Fingal</span> (1813)&#151;but he made a greater impact as a pastor. Between his appointment as bishop of Meath and his death in February 1823, fifty-seven churches and seventy-two glebe houses were built, and he produced three volumes of collected sermons (1799, 1813, and 1821). By appointing to vacant benefices on the ground of merit, enforcing personal residence, reviving the office of rural dean, and insisting upon the stricter examination of candidates for ordination, O'Beirne left the church in the diocese considerably stronger than he found it. He died at Lee House, Ardbraccan, Navan, on 17 February 1823, and was buried in the local churchyard, in the same vault as Bishop Pococke.<br>
