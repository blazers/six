<span class="headword">Loftus,  Dudley</span>  (1618&#150;1695), <span class="occ">orientalist and jurist</span>, was born at Rathfarnham Castle, co. Dublin, the third son of Sir Adam Loftus (<i>b</i>. 1590/91, <i>d</i>. in or after 1641), later lord justice and chancellor of Ireland, and his wife, Jane, daughter of Walter Vaughan of Golden Grove, King's county. He graduated BA from Trinity College, Dublin, in 1638 and then proceeded to Oxford, graduating MA from University College on 20 October 1640.<br>
<br>On his return to Ireland at the outbreak of the Irish rising of 1641 Loftus was entrusted with the defence of Rathfarnham Castle and ably protected both the castle and the city of Dublin. He then embarked on a political career and served in the Irish parliament as MP for Naas between 1642 and 1648, as MP for Kildare and Wicklow in the English parliament in 1659, and in the Irish parliament as MP for Bannow in 1661 and for Fethard, co. Wexford, from 1692 to 1695. Loftus prospered throughout the Cromwellian period, evidently presiding in Trinity College, Dublin, as professor of civil law, and no doubt through this position took part in a review of the University of Dublin in order to assess the need for a second college. He received a number of high-ranking legal appointments beginning in 1651 when he was made deputy judge advocate-general and commissioner of the revenue. Three years later he was appointed judge of the admiralty and in 1655 was made a master in chancery, ingrosser of the great roll of the clerk of the pipe, and chief ingrosser for life.<br>
<br>Edmund Borlase depicts Loftus as playing a key role in initiating the Convention of 1660 and although the issue remains in dispute, he certainly chaired a number of committees, among them the committee on religion. His innately conservative approach is evident in his support for &#145;ancients&#146; rather then &#145;moderns&#146;, apparent in both his decision to produce an edition of an Aristotelian text and his later conflict with the Dublin Philosophical Society. No doubt it was this conservatism which allowed him to easily fit into the new Restoration regime, which not only renewed his position as master in chancery but also gave him new legal honours; in 1660 he was appointed vicar-general of Ireland and judge of the chancery. However, Loftus's impetuous nature led to his imprisonment in 1673, following his vocal denunciation of new rules concerning governmental control of the corporation, which he, as judge of the prerogative court, considered to be illegal. Yet by the time of the war of 1689&#150;91 he was content to remain in his Exchange Street house in Dublin &#145;quietly at work upon his Syriac studies&#146;  (Stokes, 45).<br>
<br>Loftus's legal career is well reflected in both his manuscript collections and printed works (written not only under his own name but also that of Philo-Britannicus), such as <span class="italic">The Case of Ware and Shirley</span> (1669) and <span class="italic"><i>Digamias adikia</i>, or, The First Marriage of Katherine Fitzgerald</span> (1677). However, his fame is chiefly due to his linguistic ability and oriental studies, said to have been encouraged by James Ussher, archbishop of Armagh, who proved extremely influential in his intellectual development. By the age of twenty Loftus reputedly knew as many languages. A catalogue of 1697 which lists 128 manuscript works written by him demonstrates his interests in Arabic, Persian, Hebrew, Armenian, Syriac, and Ethiopian (several works were destroyed but the remainder are now scattered between the British Library, Bodleian Library, and Trinity College Dublin Library, and Marsh's Library, Dublin). His printed works continued these trends, his oriental studies being most evident in works such as his translation of the life of Abul Faraj from Arabic into Latin, and his famous translation of the Ethiopian version of the <span class="roman">New Testament</span> (1657) for Walton's influential polyglot <span class="roman">Bible</span> of the same year. Other works include his contribution to Edmund Castell's combined <span class="italic">Dictionary of Eastern Languages</span> (1667); <span class="italic">Anaphora</span> (1693); <span class="italic">An History of the Twofold Invention of the Cross</span> (1686); <span class="italic">Logica seu introductio</span> (1657); <span class="italic">Oratio funebris &hellip; Johannis Archepiscopi Armachani, &hellip; XVI die Julii 1663</span> (1663); <span class="italic">L'oratione del' eccellentissimo Signore Giacobo duca d'Ormondia</span> (1664); and <span class="italic">The Proceedings Observed in Order to, and in the Consecration of the Twelve Bishops</span> (1661).<br>
<br>Loftus was married twice. His first wife was Frances (<i>d</i>. 1691), the daughter and heir of Patrick Nangle, son of Thomas, styled baron of Navan. They had two sons, Dudley and Adam, and five daughters, Mary, Jane, Letitia, Frances, and Catherine, all of whom either died young or unmarried with the sole exception of Letitia, who married a Mr Bladen. Loftus's second marriage, to Lady Catherine Mervyn on 16 April 1693, caused some comment given his advanced age and in his brother-in-law Ware's view exemplified his improvident and foolish nature. Loftus died in Dublin two years later in June 1695 and was buried in St Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin, in the same month.<br>
