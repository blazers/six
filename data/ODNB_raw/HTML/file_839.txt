<span class="headword">Atkins,  Henry</span>  (1554/5&#150;1635), <span class="occ">physician</span>, born in Hertfordshire, was the son of Richard Atkins of Great Berkhamsted. After matriculating aged nineteen at Trinity College, Oxford, in 1574, he graduated BA in 1575 and MA in 1578, and afterwards proceeded MD at Nantes. He was admitted a licentiate of the College of Physicians in 1586, in 1588 he became a fellow, and in 1606 president. He was re-elected in 1607, 1608, 1616, 1617, 1624, and 1625. In 1597 he sailed as physician to the earl of Essex in the Spanish expedition, but was so seasick that he had to be put on shore and was replaced by Thomas Moundeford.<br>
<br>Atkins served as physician-in-ordinary for thirty-two years to James I and later Charles I. In 1604 Atkins was sent by the king to Scotland to bring back his son Charles. Charles had been left behind when James went south to claim the English throne, and now Atkins found him to be &#145;far out of order&#146;, as he wrote to Sir Robert Cecil  (Carlton, 2). The young duke was soon well enough to be brought to his father. In 1612 Atkins was called into consultation during the last illness of Henry, prince of Wales, and his opinion was that the disease was a putrid fever &#145;without malignity, except that attending putridity&#146;  (<span class="italic">Theo. Turquet Mayernii</span>, 119). He suggested bleeding. His signature, as one of the king's physicians, stands next to that of Mayerne in the original report of the post-mortem examination. In 1611 the king is said to have offered Atkins the first baronet's patent.<br>
<br>Atkins was very active as president of the College of Physicians. He was closely involved with the apothecaries' separation from the Grocers' Company, winning them the support of the college for their charter in 1617. The same year he also planned the new charter of the college, which, although sealed, was never ratified by parliament. In 1618, under his presidency, the College of Physicians issued the first <span class="italic">London Pharmacopoeia</span>. Atkins married Mary Pigot of Dodershall, Buckinghamshire (<i>c</i>.1567&#150;1623). He lived in Warwick Court, London, enjoyed a large practice, and died rich on 21 September 1635. He left an only child, afterwards Sir Henry Atkins, and was buried in Cheshunt church, where a monument was erected to his memory. He was a benefactor of the College of Physicians.<br>
