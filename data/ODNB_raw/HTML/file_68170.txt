<span class="headword">Grubb <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Tuke]</span>,  Sarah</span>  (1756&#150;1790), <span class="occ">Quaker minister and author</span>, was born on 20 June 1756 in York, the second of the five children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27810/', "William Tuke (1732&#150;1822)")</script>, philanthropist and founder of the York Retreat, and his first wife, Elizabeth (1729&#150;1760), daughter of John Hoyland of Woodhouse, Yorkshire. One of her brothers, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27805/', "Henry Tuke (1755&#150;1814)")</script>, also became a prominent Quaker minister. Following her mother's death, her father married Esther Maud (1727&#150;1794). Sarah and her siblings were grateful to Esther for her tenderness and care for them and for the fact that they were treated no differently from their stepmother's own children. Aged sixteen, Sarah helped Esther care for the American Quaker John Woolman during his last illness. His example of resignation and faith made a great impression on her mind and she long remembered his words to her: &#145;My child, thou seems very kind to me, a poor creature. The Lord will reward you for it&#146;  (<span class="italic">Some Account</span>, 3). Sarah first appeared in the ministry, after much hesitation and agonizing, in 1779 at the age of twenty-three. As she describes it, &#145;I ventured on my knees, and in a manner I believe scarcely intelligible, poured out a few petitions&#146;  (ibid., 13). Sarah at once embarked on local journeys in the ministry with her stepmother and other relations. In time these travels became extensive and a dominant part of her religious life.<br>
<br>In 1782 Sarah married Robert Grubb (1743&#150;1797) of Clonmel, co. Tipperary, who had lived for some time in York, and they settled at the village of Foston, 10 miles away. However, almost at once Sarah left on a visit to Scotland with Mary Proud, which she found &#145;a painful exercising time&#146;. On her return she settled into a domestic life which involved frequent travel, sometimes with her husband, but also with female companions. In 1786 Sarah accompanied Rebecca Jones of Philadelphia on a visit to Wales, and in the following year went to Ireland, again with Rebecca Jones.<br>
<br>Grubb also found time to act as clerk of the women's yearly meeting in London in both 1786 and 1787. During this period Sarah felt called to leave the security of York and her family, and in 1787 she and Robert moved to Ireland and settled near Clonmel. A year later they went with other Friends, including George and Sarah Dillwyn of America, to the Netherlands, Germany, and France. Although she had no children of her own, Sarah had decided views on education. She believed that children needed both discipline and respect and should be taught useful skills. In York in 1784 she had helped her stepmother to establish a school for girls, and when they moved to Ireland she and Robert founded Suir Island Girls' School at their home on the same principles.<br>
<br>In 1790 Grubb, together with her husband and the Dillwyns, again travelled in the ministry on the continent. When Sarah returned she was physically exhausted and ill but, pausing only to visit her family in York for a few days, she went straight to Dublin for the Ireland half-yearly meeting to report on her travels to Friends. On returning home still weak and unwell she stayed only two weeks before travelling to Cork to attend the quarterly meeting. Here she collapsed and, after ten days' illness, died on 8 December 1790 at the age of thirty-four. She was buried four days later. Her journal, <span class="italic">Some Account of the Life and Religious Labours of Sarah Grubb</span>, was published in 1792 along with writings on religion and education, including <span class="italic">Some Remarks on Christian Discipline</span> (1795) and <span class="italic">A Serious Meditation</span> (n.d.). A collection of her correspondence appeared in 1848. Although she experienced spiritual struggles in her youth, once she had dedicated her life to the service of God, Sarah Grubb never spared herself, while remaining modest about her efforts. &#145;We have done little,&#146; she told Irish friends at the end of her life, &#145;but the Lord is doing much&#146;  (Bevan, 58).<br>
