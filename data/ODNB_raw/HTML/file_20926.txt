<span class="headword">Oswen,  John</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1548&#150;1553), <span class="occ">printer</span>, was active first at Ipswich, and afterwards at Worcester. He was one of only two printers known to have worked at Ipswich in the sixteenth century; the earlier, Anthony Scoloker, probably began work in 1547 and had moved his press to London by June 1548. Nine works printed at Ipswich by John Oswen survive, five of them dated 1548 and the others undated. A further two books, also from 1548, were listed as Oswen's by Andrew Maunsell in his 1595 <span class="italic">Catalogue of English Printed Books</span>, but no copies of either these or of a third, seen by William Herbert and described in his revision of Joseph Ames's <span class="italic">Typographical Antiquities</span> (1785&#150;90, 3.1458), appear to survive. All twelve books were works by protestant reformers, including English translations of tracts by John Calvin, Christopher Hegendorff, Antoine Marcort, Philip Melanchthon, and Joannes Oecolampadius. Two Ipswich &#145;gospellers&#146;, Peter Moone and John Ramsey, provided the texts for two books of crude anti-papist verse, and the Henry Reiginalde named as translator of one Latin work was very likely Henry Reynolds of nearby Belstead.<br>
<br>Oswen's final Ipswich book may well have been Reiginalde's translation of Hegendorff's <span class="italic">Domestical Sermons</span> (1548), which ends with the promise that &#145;The rest of the sermons shalbe printed shortlye&#146;. The continuation, dated &#145;the last daye of February 1549&#146;, in fact appeared at Worcester, where the printer had relocated by the turn of the year. Oswen is specifically named as &#145;of Worcester&#146; in a patent of 6 January 1549 (2 Edward VI), the text of which he prefixed to his first Worcester book, Henry Hart's <span class="italic">Consultory for All Christians</span>, dated 30 January 1549. Oswen's privilege authorized him to print and sell, within the principality of Wales and the marches, both service and prayer books and &#145;al maner of bokes conteinyng any storye or exposition of Gods holy scripture&#146;. He consequently issued at Worcester two editions of the <span class="roman">Book of Common Prayer</span>, dated 24 May 1549 (quarto) and 30 July 1549 (folio); these were followed on 1 September by a psalter, on 8 October by an edition of the homilies, and on 12 January 1550 by a <span class="roman">New Testament</span>, all in quarto. At the same time he continued with his programme of publishing English versions of tracts by such continental reformers as Heinrich Bullinger, Matteo Gribaldi, Jean Veron, and Ulrich Zwingli, alongside similar native works by Thomas Lever and Bishop John Hooper. In addition to the nineteen books surviving from Oswen's Worcester years a further three works of 1549&#150;50, now lost, were assigned to his press by Maunsell or Herbert.<br>
<br>While at Worcester, Oswen apparently had an agent at Shrewsbury, for the colophons of several books indicate that they were &#145;also to sell&#146; there. Both at Ipswich and at Worcester his printing was distinguished by the use of lively woodcut border pieces and initials; a number of these, as well as some of his types, were later used by the London printer John Tisdale. Oswen was made a freeman of the city of Worcester in 1553, but only two of his books with that year date survive, an edition of the statutes and Hooper's homily &#145;to be read in the tyme of pestylence&#146;, dated 18 May at the end of the text. This was probably Oswen's last book: no further record of him is known, and it is very likely that he left England following the accession of Mary in July 1553. With the closure of his press Worcester was without a printer until 1709; printing did not recommence at Ipswich until 1720.<br>
