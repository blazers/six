<span class="headword">Jones,  Llewellyn  Rodwell</span>  (1881&#150;1947), <span class="occ">geographer</span>, was born on 28 August 1881 at 131 Ashley Road, Bristol, into the large family of William Rodwell Jones (1834&#150;1914), a Wesleyan Methodist minister of Welsh origin, and his wife, Sarah Ann, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Cuthbertson. An older sister, Hilda (1877&#150;1973) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/62412/', "Ormsby, Hilda")</script>], was later to become a close colleague. He attended Kingswood School, Bath, and studied mathematics and chemistry at the Royal College of Science, London, graduating BSc in 1904, before becoming a schoolteacher. He studied from 1908 to 1910 at the London School of Economics (LSE), where Halford Mackinder was reader in geography, for the certificate in geography, which Hilda had gained in 1909. At the LSE Rodwell Jones came under the influence of A. J. Sargent, later professor of commerce, who assisted Mackinder by teaching economic geography. In 1911 he and his sister attended the inspiring Saturday morning lectures that Mackinder was then giving to crowded audiences of schoolteachers from all over the London region on his &#145;new&#146; geography. Rodwell Jones was regarded as a geographer of promise. Sargent and P. F. Kendall of the University of Leeds invited him to collaborate with them on a book on commercial geography, and in 1913 he was appointed to a lectureship in the University of Leeds teaching commercial geography, especially railway geography. On the outbreak of the First World War in 1914 he enlisted and was commissioned into the West Yorkshire regiment. He saw active service in the 62nd (West Riding) division in France, was awarded the Military Cross, and received a mention in dispatches. As a major he commanded his battalion.<br>
<br>On demobilization in 1919 Rodwell Jones joined the staff of the LSE as an assistant to Mackinder at a salary of &pound;450 (partly met from the Cassel Trust), becoming lecturer in commercial geography in 1920. He became a fellow of the Royal Geographical Society. <span class="italic">North England</span> (1921), a concisely effective study in regional economic geography, showed how technical changes in industry and transport had helped to transform geographical values, producing the industrial regions of the time. S. W. Wooldridge, later professor at King's College, London, referred frequently to the quality of Rodwell Jones's knowledge of northern England and led his students in the field on routes chosen by him.<br>
<br>On Mackinder's retirement from the chair of geography in 1925, the director, William Beveridge, having failed to bring in H. J. Fleure, agreed to appoint Rodwell Jones as Mackinder's successor. In the same year Rodwell Jones received the degree of PhD. He quickly established himself as a successful head of department. Teaching for the BSc (Econ) degree prospered, with a smaller number of students reading for the BA honours degree. He was chiefly responsible for the formation of the joint school of geography with King's College, London. His inaugural lecture set out a broad view of a developing subject. He became recognized as a highly effective teacher and administrator.<br>
<br>The first of ten editions of Rodwell Jones's book <span class="italic">North America</span> (written with P. W. Bryan, who had been one of his students and contributed four chapters based on his PhD thesis) appeared in 1924, to the interested surprise of its American reviewer. It was the first serious regional geography of the continent. Rodwell Jones travelled widely in North America. He was a visiting professor at the University of Chicago in 1925 and 1927. He also visited Kenya in 1931 and wrote on its economic geography. He became interested, as was his sister Hilda, in the geography of London, and published <span class="italic">The Geography of London River</span> (1931), again opening a new field of enquiry. He was indefatigable in organizing the work of the joint school and maintaining intellectual standards. He was a member of the court of governors of the LSE from 1929 to 1934 and took an active part in the organizing arrangements for the founding of the Institute of British Geographers in 1933. The Second World War brought special problems. The LSE was evacuated to Cambridge while King's College went to Bristol: Rodwell Jones spent many long hours on wartime trains keeping the joint school active.<br>
<br>Rodwell Jones's personality was described as &#145;strong and distinctive, but not overbearing&#146;  (Stamp and Wooldridge, xii). He had a dry sense of humour and &#145;a most kindly and generous nature&#146;  (ibid.). His leadership was outstanding. Beveridge wrote (in December 1944) that &#145;in your hands, the department of Geography has been one of the most successful in the School, has caused no problems and given no anxiety&#146;  (Beveridge to Rodwell Jones, 7 Dec 1944, Rodwell Jones papers). His colleague Dudley Stamp acknowledged Rodwell Jones's help in promoting research, in his case for the land-utilization survey of Britain. But his energy began to fade and he retired in 1945. Unusually, the professorial council of the LSE passed a resolution of appreciation noting the combination of &#145;modesty with firmness&#146; and his &#145;untiring energy on behalf of his department and students to whom he was a valued friend and counsellor&#146;  (professorial council resolution, 22 Oct 1947, Rodwell Jones papers). He lived latterly at 2 Elm Crescent, Ealing, cared for by his sister Mabel, and died there of cancer on 15 August 1947. Colleagues and former students joined together to express their appreciation in <span class="italic">London Essays in Geography: the Rodwell Jones Memorial Volume</span> (1951), and a room was named for him at the LSE.<br>
