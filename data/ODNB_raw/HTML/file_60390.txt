<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Gellner,  Ernest Andr&eacute;</span>  (1925&#150;1995), <span class="occ">social philosopher and anthropologist</span>, was born on 9 December 1925 in Paris, the elder of two children of Jewish parents, Rudolf Gellner (1897&#150;1987), a lawyer, and his wife, Anna, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Fantl (1894&#150;1954), both from Czechoslovakia. The family returned to Prague, where he attended the English grammar school, but in 1939 they fled the German occupation to England, where Gellner attended St Albans county grammar school, winning a scholarship at seventeen to Balliol College, Oxford. After a year at Balliol he served with the Czech armoured brigade in northern France. He returned to Prague in 1945 and spent half a term at Prague University, but, foreseeing the communists' takeover, he returned to England and Oxford as an undergraduate. He read philosophy, politics, and economics, and obtained a first in 1949. After two years lecturing in philosophy at Edinburgh University, he moved to the London School of Economics (LSE) to teach philosophy in the sociology department, but was attracted to the ideas, though not to the cult, of Karl Popper and to anthropology, in the Malinowskian tradition, in which he wrote a doctoral thesis, doing fieldwork among the Berbers in Morocco. In 1954 he married Susan Ryan (<i>b</i>. 1926), with whom he had two sons and two daughters. He stayed at the LSE for thirty-three years, becoming professor of philosophy in 1962, moving in 1979 to the philosophy department. In 1984 he became professor of social anthropology at Cambridge but returned to Prague in 1991 as director and resident professor of the Centre for the Study of Nationalism at the Central European University.<br>
<br>Gellner was brilliant, forceful, irreverent, mischievous, sometimes perverse, with a biting wit and love of irony, while abundantly generous with his time, support, and energy, all the more impressively given a chronic bone disease from which he suffered. He was an intellectual whose impact extended across the world and beyond the various academic disciplines on whose frontiers he flourished. He engaged in vivid academic polemics, in an aphoristic and knockabout satirical style, but always in defence of bold philosophical and substantive positions. These cohered within an overall vision: an anti-relativist defence of Enlightenment ideals and insistence upon the difference between the agrarian religious world and the industrial scientific one, the need to explain the transition from the one to the other, and the cognitive and technological superiority of the second. That vision was most fully set out in his reflections on &#145;the structure of human history&#146; in his <span class="italic">Plough, Sword and Book</span> (1988).<br>
<br>The first such polemic was <span class="italic">Words and Things</span> (1959), Gellner's notorious onslaught on contemporary Oxford linguistic philosophers, much influenced by the later Wittgenstein, forever his particular <i>b&ecirc;te noire</i>. He attacked them for idealism and relativism, for assuming that philosophy must &#145;dissolve&#146; philosophical problems by endorsing the ordinary language conventions of existing communities. Bertrand Russell wrote the preface, but Gilbert Ryle, the editor of <span class="italic">Mind</span>, refused to have it reviewed. Subsequent polemical targets included the &#145;churches&#146; of French structuralism, &#145;Frankfurter&#146; neo-Marxism and the psychoanalytic movement, the &#145;anti-Orientalist&#146; analyses of Edward Said, the &#145;meta-twaddle&#146; of postmodernism, and, within anthropology, the highly influential writings of Clifford Geertz for denying that knowledge beyond culture is possible and thereby influencing his fellow anthropologists towards the very idealism and relativism to escape which he had originally turned to anthropology.<br>
<br>Gellner's major positive contributions within anthropology began with important contributions to debates about kinship and rationality. Then in <span class="italic">Saints of the Atlas</span> (1969) he applied &#145;segmentary lineage theory&#146; to analyse the role played by charismatic religious specialists in maintaining political order in the absence of state power; he also incorporated a cyclical model of tribal&#150;urban interaction derived from Ibn Khaldun. He developed this analysis into a general model for Islamic polities, in <span class="italic">Muslim Society</span> (1981), which, though criticized, was an important stimulus to scholars of Islam. But his best-known and most influential contribution was his theory of nationalism, expounded in <span class="italic">Thought and Change</span> (1965) and <span class="italic">Nations and Nationalism</span> (1983). This theory focused on the &#145;requirements&#146; of industrialism which, with its need for labour mobility, entailed a measure of egalitarianism and institutions to promote a homogeneous culture to enable communication. Industrialism's uneven spread meant that the &eacute;lites of backward areas had an incentive to foster nationalism and separate off to become bigger fish in a smaller pond. This model was also criticized, especially in relation to nationalism outside Europe, yet it remains the best general theory of nationalism yet proposed.<br>
<br>Gellner also turned his attention to Soviet-style socialism in eastern Europe and the Soviet Union. He had a keen eye for its corrupting mechanisms and inability to fulfil its promises, combining native understanding and linguistic facility with anthropological expertise, spending a year in Moscow in 1989&#150;90. He interpreted Soviet ethnographers' use of Marxist theories for the light they shed on Soviet realities, in <span class="italic">State and Society in Soviet Thought</span> (1988). In his last years he put to work the concept of &#145;civil society&#146; in <span class="italic">Conditions of Liberty: Civil Society and its Rivals</span> (1994), contrasting it with traditional segmentary and totalitarian societies, while arguing for guarantees that would protect citizens from the tyranny of the market. A striking study of Wittgenstein and Malinowski, <span class="italic">Language and Solitude</span> (1998), appeared posthumously, relating their contrasting viewpoints to conditions of life and thought under the Habsburg empire.<br>
<br>Gellner was a provocative and exciting but schematic thinker who liked, as he once admitted, &#145;neat, crisp models&#146;. These should be seen as &#145;ideal types&#146; for generating theories that have the Popperian virtue of being falsifiable. He offered sketches of the big picture of large-scale social processes, while admiring and encouraging those committed to the detailed understanding of local concepts and ideas but fiercely opposing those who fashionably argued that local knowledge is all the knowledge there is. He was a passionate universalist in both his thought and his life. He built up an extraordinary range of international contacts, but his incessant travels finally caught up with him. On 5 November 1995 he died of a heart attack in Prague after flying back from a meeting in Budapest. He was cremated in Chichester, Sussex. Gellner was survived by his wife and four children.<br>
