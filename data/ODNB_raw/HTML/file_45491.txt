<span class="headword">Morgan,  (Mary) Evelyn  De</span> <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Mary Evelyn Pickering]</span>  (1855&#150;1919), <span class="occ">painter</span>, was born on 30 August 1855 at 6 Grosvenor Street, London, the first of the four children of Percival Andre Pickering (1811&#150;1877), QC, and his wife, Anna Maria Wilhelmina (1824&#150;1901), daughter of John Spencer-Stanhope and his wife, Elizabeth. Evelyn displayed a talent for drawing at an early age and, despite a certain amount of disapproval from her parents, declared a serious intent to become a professional artist. Her maternal uncle, the painter John Roddam Spencer-Stanhope, encouraged her to develop her artistic skills and introduced her to Italian Renaissance painting which was to be a significant influence on her work. In 1873 she enrolled at the Slade School of Fine Art in London, where she was among the first generation of women artists to attend. She soon became a distinguished scholar, winning several prizes for drawing and painting, and was later awarded the prestigious Slade scholarship. However, Pickering was keen to learn more and between 1875 and 1877 she made several trips to Italy to study Renaissance painting at first hand. As a young woman, she showed remarkable ambition and independence, as well as an extraordinary commitment to her art. On her return to London she was invited to exhibit at the Grosvenor Gallery, where she chose to show her first major painting, <span class="italic">Ariadne in Naxos</span> (1877; De Morgan Foundation, London), a simple yet powerful composition depicting a distraught Ariadne abandoned on the beach. On 5 March 1887 she married the potter <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32779/', "William Frend De Morgan (1839&#150;1917)")</script>, who, along with his friend and business associate William Morris, became a prominent figure in the decorative arts movement. The De Morgans settled at The Vale in Chelsea, where they lived until 1910, although they often spent the winter in Florence due to William's bad health.<br>
<br>While financial gain was considered less important to the De Morgans than artistic pursuits, any income that was generated from the sale of Evelyn's paintings was used to help finance her husband's pottery business. Her exhibitions attracted a great deal of critical appraisal, so much so that the late Victorian painter G. F. Watts reportedly proclaimed her to be &#145;the first woman artist of the day&#151;if not of all time&#146;  (Stirling, 193). The subjects of her oil paintings draw on a rich variety of sources including mythology, literature, the <span class="roman">Bible</span>, and war, and represent an attempt by the artist to &#145;explore both cosmic mysteries and contemporary issues through myth and symbol by developing an aesthetic that was personally authentic&#146;  (Gordon, 34). During the 1890s De Morgan painted several canvases featuring solitary full-length female figures in the landscape. The influence of her travels in Italy and her interest in Botticelli is particularly striking in the painting <span class="italic">Flora</span> (1894; De Morgan Foundation, London), generally considered to be her masterpiece. Her attention to detail, in particular her observation of nature, creates an exquisite and delicate background to the serene goddess of fruitfulness. Her acquaintance with the later generation of Pre-Raphaelite artists, and the symbolist painter Edward Burne-Jones whose work she admired, helped to raise her profile in the Victorian art world. Indeed, such was Burne-Jones's stylistic influence that De Morgan's <span class="italic">Aurora triumphans</span> (1886; Russell-Cotes Art Gallery and Museum, Bournemouth) was for a time wrongly attributed to Burne-Jones due to the forged inscription &#145;EBJ&#146;. The influence of the Pre-Raphaelites can be seen in later works such as <span class="italic">Queen Eleanor and Fair Rosamund</span> (De Morgan Foundation, London) with its vivid colours and medieval theme. The use of narrative details, for example, literary references, emblems, and symbols, which are typical of the Pre-Raphaelite style, creates an image of intense drama. The preparatory drawings for this painting, like so many of her figurative studies, highlight De Morgan's meticulous and highly accomplished technical skills.<br>
<br>In 1906 De Morgan held a solo exhibition at the Bruton Gallery in London, and a year later showed twenty-five works at Wolverhampton Art Gallery. The horrors of the South African War and the First World War had a profound effect on De Morgan who was a staunch pacifist. She painted over fifteen war paintings including <span class="italic">The Red Cross</span> (exh. 1916; De Morgan Foundation, London) which shows the figure of Christ surrounded by angels, floating above a field of white memorial crosses. She died of nephritis at her home, 127 Old Church Street, London, on 2 May 1919 and was buried in Brookwood cemetery on 8 May.<br>
<br>After her death, De Morgan's sister, Anna Maria Wilhelmina Pickering (1865&#150;1965), later Mrs Stirling, published <span class="italic">William De Morgan and his Wife</span> (1922), a lively, if somewhat unreliable, account. The De Morgan Foundation at Old Battersea House, London, was formally established in 1968 and houses Mrs Stirling's extensive collection of De Morgan's painting and drawings, although many works were destroyed in a fire in 1991. In the 1990s several exhibitions of De Morgan's paintings, drawings, and sculpture helped to bring her work to a wider audience. In addition, feminist art historians have reappraised De Morgan's work in the context of her female contemporaries and not simply in relation to the male artists associated with the Pre-Raphaelite movement. Her enduring reputation as an artist of extraordinary imagination and ambition was anticipated in an obituary written in 1920: &#145;it is safe to prophesy that Evelyn De Morgan's works will be eagerly sought after as some of the Old Masters are today&#146;  (McAllister, 29).<br>
