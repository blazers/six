<span class="headword">Cocker,  Edward</span>  (1631/2&#150;1676), <span class="occ">calligrapher and arithmetician</span>, is sometimes said to have come from Northamptonshire but this is unsubstantiated. Nothing is known of his parentage and early life. He published five copybooks in 1657; one, <span class="italic">The Pen's Triumph</span>, mentions an earlier <span class="italic">Pen's Experience</span>, now untraced, as his first work. By 1657 he was married, and teaching writing and arithmetic in St Paul's Churchyard, London. He and his wife, Joanna (or Joane), had two sons&#151;Edward (1658&#150;1723), also a penman, and Charles (1661&#150;1674).<br>
<br>Further books followed thick and fast, much to the consternation of rivals; in all, Cocker engraved more than two dozen. This proliferation was the output of a virtuoso performer with pen and burin. He &#145;delighted to embroider his copy-books with fantastic creatures, exotic birds &hellip; his knots and flourishes are wonderful pieces of exuberant penmanship&#146;  (Heal, 36). His originality extended to interspersing his instruction with rhyming couplets. Samuel Pepys, describing him as &#145;the famous writing-master&#146;  (10 Aug 1664), employed him to engrave his slide-rule, and admired his skill in executing such fine work.<br>
<br>Cocker engraved plates for other authors&#151;about 1660 for his friend, James Hodder, and in 1664 at least sixty-seven plates for Richard Daniel, and four plates in <span class="italic">The Young Clerk's Tutor</span> by J. H. of Staple-Inne. His own <span class="italic">Tutor to Writing and Arithmetic</span> (1664) was part letterpress, part engraved, with arithmetic outlined as far as the rule of three.<br>
<br>In the autumn of 1664 Cocker removed about 100 yards from St Paul's Churchyard to start a school in Gutter Lane; in 1667 he was teaching in Northampton, perhaps as a consequence of the great fire of 1666. By 1674 he was back in the City, and shortly set up school again by the church of St George the Martyr, Southwark, a move probably forced on him by committal for debt to the king's bench prison; he could have purchased the privilege of living outside but near the prison. He died in the poverty which seems to have dogged him all his life, due to the turbulent times, and possible losses in the fire. It may be assumed that he died at his schoolhouse, as he was buried at the church on 26 August 1676. The verse broadside of 1675, <span class="italic">Cocker's Farewel to Brandy</span>, ending in the death of a drunkard, must have been written by him, not about him, as sometimes suggested.<br>
<br>Although famous as writing-master and engraver during his lifetime, Cocker became more so in death. In 1678 his friend and successor in the Southwark school, John Hawkins (<i>fl</i>. 1676&#150;1692), published <span class="italic">Cockers Arithmetick, being a Plain and Familiar Method</span>, which he claimed to have taken from Cocker's manuscripts. This textbook, originally of 334 pages, had reached its twentieth edition by 1700 and its fifty-fifth by 1758; there were others with repeat numbering or none, besides at least eight Dublin editions and some at Edinburgh and Glasgow up to 1787. Its popularity might have derived from its being adapted to the requirements of trade rather than those of the gentry and their tutors. In a popular play of 1756 Cocker's <span class="italic">Arithmetick</span> was dubbed &#145;best Book that ever was wrote&#146;  (Murphy, 10), with four more mentions, spawning the phrase (not Murphy's) &#145;according to Cocker&#146;; both book and man became bywords for authority. It is for his arithmetic rather than his calligraphy that Cocker is remembered.<br>
<br>In 1685 Hawkins published <span class="italic">Cocker's Decimal Arithmetick</span>, including logarithms and algebra, with a sixth and final edition in 1729. Then J. Back, a bookseller involved with the <span class="italic">Arithmetick</span>, issued in 1696 <span class="italic">Cockers Accomplish'd School-Master</span>, &#145;The like never published&#146;, without explaining its origin, and A. Back in 1704 produced <span class="italic">Cocker's English Dictionary</span> &#145;from the Authors Correct copy, by John Hawkins&#146;. Strange to say, Hawkins had died in 1692; the Backs were probably fraudulently capitalizing on Cocker's name.<br>
<br>In the nineteenth century Augustus De Morgan, who considered Hodder's <span class="italic">Arithmetick</span> superior to Cocker's, also cast doubt on the authenticity of the latter, claiming that it was largely, if not wholly, a forgery by Hawkins. His &#145;proofs&#146; are, however, extremely weak. The style of the preface and typical concluding couplet appear to proclaim it as genuine Cocker. De Morgan himself rather undermined his own thesis in a textual analysis intended to ridicule the writer's verbosity, by not recognizing that this completely accorded with Cocker's character.<br>
<br>Equally, there is no doubt that Cocker in his lifetime intended to publish on arithmetic. Two publishers' advertisements, in 1661 and 1669, attest to this. The presumption therefore remains that <span class="italic">Cockers Arithmetick</span> and <span class="italic">Cocker's Decimal Arithmetick</span>, both undoubtedly edited by Hawkins, are the <span class="italic">Compleat Arithmetician</span> described in the advertisements, and are indeed &#145;according to Cocker&#146;.<br>
