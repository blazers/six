<span class="headword">Marshall <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Paley]</span>,  Mary</span>  (1850&#150;1944), <span class="occ">economist</span>, was born on 24 October 1850 in the village of Ufford, near Stamford, the second daughter of the Revd Thomas Paley and his wife, Judith Wormald. She was the great-granddaughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21155/', "Archdeacon William Paley")</script>. Her sister and a younger brother also survived into adulthood.<br>
<br>Although the subject of a lengthy obituary and autobiographical memoirs published after her death, Mary Paley Marshall remains a shadowy figure, a devoted assistant and appendage to her famous husband, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/34893/', "Alfred Marshall (1842&#150;1924)")</script>. Shortly before his death, she claimed that &#145;to have helped, however little, in a life such as his is an enviable and delightful lot&#146;  (M. P. Marshall to J. M. Keynes, 27 July 1922, King's Cam., Keynes Collection). Yet this picture of her as a typical Victorian wife overlooks her importance as a pioneer woman student and university teacher, her unusual role as a middle-class working woman, her considerable talents as a painter, and, more controversially, the evidence of her rejection of the second-class status that her husband increasingly held to be the place of women in society.<br>
<br>Educated mainly at home, both by her father and by a German governess, Mary Paley's father encouraged her to enter in 1870 for the Cambridge higher local examinations for women over eighteen. She continued her studies in Cambridge, where she lived with Anne Jemima Clough and was one of the first five students at Newnham Hall (the famous Newnham Five), attending lectures given by progressive Cambridge dons who supported the cause of women's higher education. She passed the moral sciences papers of the higher locals with distinctions in political economy and logic, and Alfred Marshall persuaded her to enter informally for the moral sciences tripos, although women at that time had no right to use Cambridge degree examination papers. In December 1874 she was unofficially classed between a first- and second-class degree.<br>
<br>From October 1875 until her marriage to Alfred Marshall in August 1877, Mary Paley was resident lecturer in economics at Newnham College. After their marriage, which was childless, the Marshalls settled in Bristol, where Alfred became principal and professor of political economy of the new University College. The couple had already begun co-operation on a short text book of elementary economics, <span class="italic">The Economics of Industry</span> (1879). While he stood for the book's analytical content, she ensured its freshness and simplicity of style. The book proved a success, being reprinted nine times.<br>
<br>Bristol was the first university college to experiment in co-education, and, as &#145;both Alfred and I were anxious that I should help in the work of the College&#146;  (Tullberg, &#145;Mary Paley Marshall&#146;, 157), Mary gave her husband's morning lectures. When he fell ill a year later, she took over more of his work, including advanced classes. Her dedication to students was long remembered and, in 1926, she was awarded the degree of DLitt by Bristol University for her lifelong work as a teacher of economics. After an interlude of four terms in Oxford, 1883&#150;4, during which Mary was a popular lecturer in political economy to women students, the couple returned to Cambridge in 1884 on Alfred's appointment to the Cambridge chair of political economy.<br>
<br>Alfred Marshall's views on the position of women in society and on their academic potential had meanwhile grown conservative, even reactionary. Mary Marshall returned to Newnham as economics lecturer but maintained a low profile. However, her review of Clara Collet's <span class="italic">Educated Working Women</span> reveals her clear understanding of the need for women to gain economic independence through education and not face the &#145;destructive humiliation&#146; of being obliged to marry for a living  (<span class="italic">Economic Journal</span>, 12, 1902, 252&#150;7). She retired from teaching in 1916 and devoted the following eight years to the care of her husband, who was becoming increasingly infirm, physically and mentally. She assisted him closely in the production of <span class="italic">Industry and Trade</span> (1919) and especially his final work, <span class="italic">Money, Credit and Commerce</span> (1923). After his death in 1924, she became honorary librarian of the Marshall Library, and catalogued the many books donated by her husband.<br>
<br>Any assessment of Mary Marshall's own work as an economist is difficult because she published so little. As a teacher, it may be said that while in her early years she inspired many other women to enter and succeed in &#145;men's examinations&#146;, she later failed to respond to developments in the educational standards of women students and to attitudes to research in late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century Cambridge. In an unpublished obituary Claude Guillebaud summarized his aunt's life in Cambridge from 1884: &#145;Until [Alfred Marshall's] death &hellip; she lived only for him, collaborating with him in his writing and tending him with a self-sacrificing devotion that could hardly be exceeded.&#146; After his death &#145;her individuality blossomed forth in what became for her a real St. Martin's summer. &hellip; Age never warped the kindly, tolerant and humorous attitude towards life which made her such a delightful companion&#146;  (Tullberg, &#145;Mary Paley Marshall&#146;, 184).<br>
<br>Mary Marshall died in Cambridge at her home, Balliol Croft, 6 Madingley Road, Cambridge, on 19 March 1944, and her ashes were scattered in the grounds of Balliol Croft, where she and her husband had lived since their return to Cambridge.<br>
