<span class="headword">Page, Sir  Gregory</span>, second baronet  (1689&#150;1775), <span class="occ">art collector</span>, was born in Greenwich, the elder son of Sir Gregory Page, first baronet (1668&#150;1720), and his wife, Mary, daughter of Thomas Trotman, citizen of London. Both his father and his grandfather had been directors of the East India Company. The first baronet was MP for New Shoreham in 1708&#150;13 and 1715&#150;20: on his death in 1720 his executors sold his large shareholding in the South Sea Company, and his son was left about &pound;600,000. Page himself was also a director of the East India Company (1719&#150;20), and a large stockholder. In 1717 he began buying land in Kent and the City of London, which eventually placed the family among the largest landowners in the county; it was said to be possible to walk for a day in north-west Kent without leaving Page property.<br>
<br>In 1721 Page married Martha, third daughter of Robert Kenward of Yalding, Kent; they had no children. In 1723 he bought the freehold of Wricklemarsh on Blackheath from the executors of the widow of Sir John Morden, the founder of Morden College, Blackheath. Almost at once the construction of a new house was begun, Page's ample fortune ensuring an astonishing rate of progress. He chose as his architect John James of Greenwich, who had succeeded Nicholas Hawksmoor as clerk of the works at Greenwich, and who designed a restrained Palladian house: a ground plan and cross-section through the rooms were included in the fourth volume of <span class="italic">Vitruvius Britannicus</span>, (1739). According to a contemporary description, Wricklemarsh was one of the finest mansions in England, resembling &#145;a royal palace rather than a residence of a gentleman&#146;  (Sutton, 364). The viewer goes on to describe elegantly laid out gardens, rooms hung with green or crimson silk damask, cornices, doorcases and chair frames carved in gilt, and chimney-pieces of polished marble.<br>
<br>A complete list of Page's collection of pictures was printed in the first volume of <span class="italic">London and its Environs Described</span>, published in 1761 by R. and J. D. Dodsley. It comprised 118 pictures, with paintings by Claude, Poussin, Veronese, Van Dyck, Rubens, Salvator Rosa, Nicolaes Berchem, and a group of ten pictures by Adriaen van der Werff, a contemporary Dutch classicist painter much admired in the eighteenth century. Page presumably had links with the Dutch East India Company: six Dutch East India wood chairs inlaid with the Page/Kenward arms in mother-of-pearl are now in Sir John Soane's Museum. Page was the founder and patron of the dining club the Free and Easy Society, for which a number of Qianlong Chinese armorial punchbowls were made about 1755.<br>
<br>Page died at Wricklemarsh on 4 August 1775 and was buried alongside his wife in the family vault at St Alfege, Greenwich. He left Wricklemarsh and its collections to his great-nephew Sir Gregory Turner, baronet, of Ambrosden in Oxfordshire, who took the name and arms of Page in compliance with his great-uncle's request. Turner did not live at Wricklemarsh, but let it to a succession of tenants. Horace Walpole (later fourth earl of Orford), wrote in 1779 that &#145;half the van der Werffs, which cost an immense sum &hellip; are spoiled since Sir Gregory Page's death by servants neglecting to shut out the sun&#146;  (<span class="italic">Horace Walpole's Correspondence</span>, ed. W. S. Lewis, 33, 1965, p. 137). The picture collection was sold in parts in 1775, 1783, and 1787. Wricklemarsh was sold in 1784 to John Cator, who instructed Christies to auction the materials of the house in 1787; its shell was finally demolished in 1800.<br>
