<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Young, Sir  Peter</span>  (1544&#150;1628), <span class="occ">royal tutor and diplomat</span>, was born on 15 August 1544 at Dundee, the second son of John Young (<i>b</i>. 1497), burgess of Edinburgh and Dundee, and Margaret, daughter of Walter Scrymgeour of Glasswell. John Young's third son, Alexander, was usher of the king's privy chamber to James VI, and died on 29 December 1603. Peter was educated at Dundee grammar school, and possibly matriculated at St Andrews University since he was designated <i>magister</i> when admitted a burgess of Dundee. From 1562 until 1568 he studied at Geneva under the care of his uncle <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/24968/', "Henry Scrimgeour")</script>, who held the chair of civil law there. Young became acquainted with the theologian Theodore Beza and corresponded with him after returning to Scotland. Other correspondents included the reformer Andrew Melville and the astronomer Tycho Brahe.<br>
<br>In 1569 the regent of Scotland, James, earl of Moray, appointed Young co-tutor to the infant James VI along with George Buchanan. Young appears to have taken the lead in teaching the king&#151;who lived at Stirling Castle&#151;since Buchanan was by now elderly. The teaching day consisted of Isocrates, Plutarch, and the <span class="roman">New Testament</span> before breakfast; Livy, Cicero, and a modern historian after breakfast; and, in the afternoon, logic and rhetoric. Young made it his concern to build up the royal library which had been dispersed during the deposition of Queen Mary; he collected or recovered some 600 books consisting of theology, classical authors, modern history, and political theory. He himself donated a <span class="roman">Bible</span> and several works by Greek and Latin writers. Young carried himself as a courtier, and according to Sir James Melville of Halhill &#145;was laith till offend the kyng at any tym, and used him self wairly, as a man that had mynd of his awen weill be keping of his Majestie's favour&#146;  (<span class="italic">Memoirs of His Own Life</span>, 262).<br>
<br>In August 1570 Young was presented to a subchantory of Glasgow and the parsonage of Durisdeer in Nithsdale as &#145;pedagog to oure soverane lord&#146; but was forced to demit since he was not qualified to serve as its minister  (Donaldson, 6.164, 505; 7.3). However, he was compensated with revenues from the archbishopric of Glasgow, and in 1579 with the rights to rents from the king's lordship of Torphichen for his service &#145;in educatioun and instructioun of his hienes &hellip; and contenuall attendance and awayting on his majestie almaist ever sen his nativitie&#146;  (ibid., 7.341). On 25 October 1577 Young had been appointed maister elemosinare (master almoner) to the king with a yearly pension of &pound;200. He was involved in several scholarly enterprises; in 1574 he served on kirk committees and in 1575 he acted as deputy for Buchanan on the committee for standardizing the teaching of Latin in schools. On 3 January 1577 he and others were granted licence to print works by classical writers and &#145;ane onomastik, certane select sentences, the catechisme for the young bairns&#146; for fifteen years  (ibid., 7.121). During the 1590s Tycho Brahe asked him several times to write a life of Buchanan, but Young excused himself due to a lack of source materials. In 1598 he was appointed to the commission reporting on the state of Scottish universities.<br>
<br>When Danish ambassadors asked for the redemption of Orkney, Young was sent to Denmark in July 1586. On this occasion he satisfied Frederick II on certain points and began negotiations for a royal marriage. On his return he was admitted to the privy council (7 November 1586); he remained a frequent attender until 1622. In May 1587 he and Sir Patrick Vans of Barnbarroch embarked on a second embassy to Denmark, and avoided the question of Orkney and Shetland by claiming they had no commission from the king to discuss the matter; they then proposed a marriage with the Princess Elizabeth. In 1588 Young returned to Denmark only to discover she had been promised to another, and so Princess Anne was offered instead. The death of Frederick in 1588 delayed negotiations but the queen regent sent Young back to Scotland with a portrait of the princess and he spoke favourably of her to King James. Early in 1589 Young went to Denmark to complete the negotiations, and he was present at the marriage of James VI in Oslo, Norway, in October.<br>
<br>Throughout the 1590s Young continued to serve James as an ambassador. In 1590 he was sent to the Danish court and presented a portrait of Buchanan to Tycho Brahe. In April 1594 he was ambassador to Denmark and the empire when he gave assurances regarding the quarrel between Queen Anne and Chancellor Thirlstane over her marriage-portion lands. On his return Young brought back Duke Ulric of Mecklenburg, grandfather to Anne, and the duke of Brunswick, her brother-in-law, to attend the baptism of Prince Henry; both were offended because James had not sent a special envoy to each of them, so neither would accompany Young from Leith. In 1595 he was appointed one of the eight octavians charged with managing the king's financial affairs. The following year Young and Lord Ogilvy were sent to Denmark to ask for ships and soldiers for an expedition against the Isles, and the question of support for James's claim to the English throne was discussed. In 1598 James VI sent the bishop of Aberdeen and Young on an embassy to Denmark and the empire with secret instructions to negotiate a league of princes to persuade Elizabeth of England publicly to acknowledge James as her heir. Young and Cunningham were instructed to secure a loan from Christian IV and the German princes for hiring soldiers to press the Scottish claim to England. During this same embassy Young met David Chytraeus, who had published an attack on Queen Mary based on Buchanan's <span class="italic">Detectio</span>, but persuaded Chytraeus to retract it at the prompting of King James. Young accompanied James to England in 1603; he remained master almoner and in November 1604 was made tutor and &#145;chief overseer&#146; in the household of Prince Charles. He was knighted on 19 February 1605.<br>
<br>Young married three times. He and his first wife, Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1593), daughter of John Gibb, a gentleman of the king's bedchamber, had eight sons and four daughters. The fifth son was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30276/', "Patrick Young (d. 1652)")</script>, royal librarian and editor of some of the writings of King James VI, while the sixth, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/38164/', "John Young (1585&#150;1654)")</script>, was for nearly thirty years dean of Winchester. Young's second wife, Joanna Murray, survived her marriage for only six months, dying in November 1596. In 1600 he married Marjory Nairne of Sandfurd; they had four daughters, and she was still living in 1642. In 1616 Young was appointed titular master of St Cross Hospital, Winchester. He had purchased the estate of Easter Seaton, near Arbroath, Angus (Forfarshire), in 1580, and died there on 7 January 1628 in his eighty-fourth year. He was buried in the vault of St Vigean's Church near Arbroath.<br>
