<span class="headword">Sherley,  Thomas</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1638, <em>d.</em> 1678), <span class="occ">physician and natural philosopher</span>, the son of Sir Thomas Shirley (<i>bap</i>. 1597, <i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1656), of Wiston, Sussex, and his wife, Anne, daughter of Sir George Blundell, of Cardington, Bedfordshire, and grandson of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25436/', "Sir Thomas Sherley (1564&#150;1633/4)")</script>, was born in the parish of St Margaret, Westminster, London, and baptized on 15 October 1638. He lived with his father in Magdalen College while the king's troops were in Oxford, and was educated at Magdalen School. It is likely that for a time between 1653 and 1656 Sherley was a pupil of Henry Oldenburg, with whom he formed a lasting friendship. While living in Wigan in 1659 he developed an interest in natural philosophy, as attested by his observations of sulphurous exhalations in Lancashire, which he subsequently published in the <span class="italic">Philosophical Transactions</span> of the Royal Society (3 June 1667). The report was criticized by Adam Martindale (1623&#150;1686), a preacher at Manchester, who in a letter to Oldenburg dated 4 November 1670 maintained that Sherley's paper was of little or no interest for natural history. Sherley studied medicine in France, where he took the degree of MD. He was twice married: first to Hannah, daughter of John Harfleet, of Fleet, Kent, with whom he had two daughters, Anne and Margaret. On 5 June 1667 he married Elizabeth, daughter of Captain Richard Baskett, of Apps, Isle of Wight, with whom he had two sons, Thomas and Richard, and a daughter, Elizabeth.<br>
<br>Sherley appears to have had a military career which ended in 1667, when he began to practise medicine in London. By 1672 he was claiming to be physician-in-ordinary to Charles II; in the same year he published his <span class="italic">Philosophicall essay declaring the probable causes whence stones are produced in the greater world</span>, dedicated to George Villiers, second duke of Buckingham. Sherley's <span class="italic">Essay</span> was not confined to the study of the generation of stones, but dealt also with the principles of natural philosophy. Sherley stated that the reading of Robert Boyle's works had encouraged him to undertake the writing of his <span class="italic">Essay</span>. Through Oldenburg, Sherley was acquainted with Boyle, whom he referred to as &#145;my excellent friend&#146;  (<span class="italic">Philosophicall Essay</span>, 84). Sherley's views, as contained in the <span class="italic">Essay</span>, were a combination of Jean-Baptiste van Helmont's iatrochemistry with Boyle's corpuscular philosophy. Like Helmont and Boyle, Sherley denied that fire analysis could reduce mixed bodies to the first principles, and, like other Helmontians, he searched for the alkahest&#151;that is, the universal solvent. Sherley, who fully embraced a teleological view of nature, reinterpreted the Helmontian seminal principles to claim that they were particles of matter endowed by God with the power of producing natural bodies.<br>
<br>In 1675 Sherley was involved in an unsuccessful dispute with Sir John Fagg over the Wiston estate in Sussex, then worth about &pound;3000 a year. Sherley had inherited the estate from his father, but it was granted to Sir Thomas Fagg during the civil war. When the case was decided against him in chancery, Sherley appealed to the House of Lords. As Sir John was a member of the House of Commons, Sherley was ordered into the custody of the serjeant-at-arms on 12 May 1675 for bringing an appeal in the House of Lords against a member of the lower house. The matter occasioned a dispute between the two houses.<br>
<br>Sherley published the following translations: <span class="italic">Cochlearia curiosa, or, The Curiosities of Scurvy Grass</span> (1676) from a work by V. A. Moellenbroek; <span class="italic">A Treatise of the Gout</span> (1676) and <span class="italic">Medicinal Councels</span> (1677), both after T. Turquet de Mayerne; and <span class="italic">The Curious Distillatory</span> (1677), after J. S. Elsholtz. Sherley said the work of translation diverted him from melancholy. He died on 5 August 1678 and was buried in the south-west vault of St Bride's Church, off Fleet Street, London.<br>
