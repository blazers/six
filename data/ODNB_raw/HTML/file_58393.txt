<span class="headword">Tajfel,  Henri <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em>Hersz Mordche]</span></span>  (1919&#150;1982), <span class="occ">social psychologist</span>, was born in W&#322;oc&#322;awek, Poland, on 22 June 1919, the elder son of Icek Henyne Tajfel, a Jewish businessman, and his wife, Ruchla. Since university education was almost inaccessible for Jews, Tajfel went to France after completing his secondary schooling at the Jewish <i>Gymnasium</i> in 1937. His studies of chemistry at the University of Toulouse were cut short by the outbreak of war in 1939. He joined the French army, was captured in 1940, and was incarcerated as a prisoner of war until 1945. On his release he found that his parents, brother, and other family members had been exterminated. He went to work with international relief agencies for war victims, first in France and Belgium, and later in the British zone of West Germany. These experiences led him to turn to psychology, which he began to study part time at the University of Paris during 1946&#150;7, continuing at the Universit&eacute; Libre de Bruxelles, where he qualified in 1949.<br>
<br>On 6 October 1948 Tajfel married Anna-Sophie Eber; they had two sons. He then moved to Britain, becoming a British citizen in 1957. On winning a state scholarship with an essay on prejudice, a topic that remained central to his work, Tajfel continued his studies and graduated in 1954 at Birkbeck College, London University. After two years as a research assistant at the University of Durham he completed a PhD at London and moved to Oxford to become lecturer in social psychology and fellow of Linacre College, Oxford, where he remained for ten years. Tajfel rejected the then prevailing mode of abstract psychologizing focused on the individual, stressing the importance of the social context. He demonstrated the key role of social categorization for the analysis of interactions between individuals and groups, initiating a new approach to the study of ethnocentrism, stereotyping, social influence, and inter-group relations that came to be adopted by the new generation of social psychologists. During the early 1960s Tajfel, with his enormous zest and cosmopolitanism, was prominent in helping to bring together a group of social psychologists from several European countries, which led to the foundation of the European Association of Experimental Social Psychology. He played a leading part in the creation of a distinctive European tradition in this sphere. During his period at Oxford Tajfel spent a year at the Center for Cognitive Studies at Harvard (1958&#150;9) and another at the Center for Advanced Studies in the Behavioral Sciences at Stanford (1966&#150;7). On his return to England from Stanford he was appointed to the first chair of social psychology at Bristol, where he stayed until 1982, retiring to Oxford shortly before his death.<br>
<br>At Bristol Tajfel assembled a talented group of researchers, many of whom became successful in their own right. His department became a place of pilgrimage for social scientists from all over the world. Not long after his arrival in Bristol Tajfel hit upon the minimal group paradigm, an idea that occurred to him as he walked in an Amsterdam street. It is a method for inducing an arbitrary differentiation between two groups, which, in spite of its artificiality (no actual contact), seems to affect the manner in which group members perceive &#145;the others&#146;. It formed the basis of Tajfel's social identity theory, which holds that a critical element of groups is the fact that they build a defining identity into their members, which inevitably entails evaluation and comparison with other groups. The theory was extremely influential and gave rise to much debate as well as to a large volume of research on inter-group attitudes and behaviour. Although Tajfel wrote and edited several books, his main contributions are in journal articles and book chapters. An exception is his <span class="italic">Human Groups and Social Categories</span> (1981), which provides a condensed overview of his life's work.<br>
<br>Tajfel was not a religious person, but he had a deep sense of Jewish identity&#151;so strong that even in a German prisoner-of-war camp he could not bring himself to conceal it, though he pretended to be a French Jew. Politically he was always a man of the left. As a student in France he belonged to a communist group until the Hitler&#150;Stalin pact; in Britain he supported the Labour Party until he considered Liberals more radical. His interests were wide and varied. Apart from architecture, his tastes in the arts were for the moderns. It was typical that he used pictures by Kandinsky and Klee in some of his experiments, and he was fascinated by the history of the cinema. As regards music, he was particularly fond of such composers as Bart&oacute;k and Schoenberg. Tajfel's character is admirably captured in a foreword to the above-mentioned book by the distinguished American psychologist Jerome Bruner:<blockquote>He is a man of huge hospitality in the broadest sense. He listens, reacts, brings you another drink, argues you down and sets you back up. He sets his guests at each other when he fears pseudo-agreement, thunders at them when he thinks their differences finical. Add one further element to that. Tajfel is the canonical European, not only linguistically equipped with several languages deployed with breathtaking speed and fluency, but with a deep sense of European culture. (Tajfel, xii/xiii)</blockquote>Tajfel died of cancer at his home at 7 Polstead Road, Oxford, on 3 May 1982 and was buried at the Jewish cemetery, Wolvercote, in Oxford three days later.<br>
