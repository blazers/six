<span class="headword">Williams,  Francis</span>  (<em>c.</em>1690&#150;1762), <span class="occ">writer in Jamaica</span>, was born in Jamaica, the son of John Williams (<i>d</i>. 1723), slave, and his wife, Dorothy (<i>d</i>. 1731). The earliest reference to him is what appears to be the record of his baptism and that of his elder brother Thomas in the parish of St Catherine's, Jamaica, on 26 December 1697. His father was freed by the will of his former master, Colonel John Bourden, a prominent local figure who died in 1697. Within about ten years John Williams had acquired significant property, and in February 1708 he was able to get the local legislature to pass a special act in his favour that prevented slaves giving evidence against him and gave him the right to a jury trial. This was an important and highly unusual (though not unique) privilege in a racially stratified society in which non-white people, even if free, had very little protection under the law. John and Dorothy Williams were perhaps not formally married until after this date; what may have been their marriage was recorded in St Catherine's, on 18 July 1708.<br>
<br>In October 1716 John Williams persuaded the Jamaican legislature to pass another act, extending the privileges granted to him in the former act to his wife, Dorothy, and to his sons, John, Thomas, and Francis. The act noted that the elder John Williams had &#145;Educated his said sons in the Protestant Religion according to the Doctrine of the Church of England as by Law Established and hath given them other suitable Education according to their Degree&#146;. John and Dorothy Williams also had a daughter, Lucretia (sometimes called Lucretia Greenwich), but she was not included in the act.<br>
<br>The details of Francis Williams's education are obscure. He himself later said &#145;Insula me genuit, celebres aluere <i>Britanni</i>&#146;, by which he appears to have meant that he was born in the island (Jamaica) but educated in Britain. The account of Williams given by Edward Long (published in his <span class="italic">History of Jamaica</span> in 1774, a dozen years after Williams's death) claimed that he was the subject of<blockquote>an experiment, which, it is said, the Duke of Montagu was curious to make, in order to discover, whether, by proper cultivation, and a regular course of tuition at school and the university, a Negroe might not be found as capable of literature as a white person. (Long, 2.476)</blockquote>Long added that Williams<blockquote>was sent to England, where he underwent a regular discipline of classic instruction at a grammar school, after which he was fixed at the university of Cambridge, where he studied under the ablest preceptors, and made some progress in the mathematics. (ibid.)</blockquote>However, Williams does not appear in the university's records, and the family's wealth was such as to make it seem unlikely that he would have needed noble patronage in order to secure an education. What can be said with certainty is that Williams was admitted as a member of Lincoln's Inn on 8 August 1721.<br>
<br>Williams was living in England at the time of his father's death, in July 1723. By that time the elder John Williams was described as a factor, or merchant, living in Spanish Town, St Catherine's. He had accumulated a substantial fortune; the inventory of his property made soon after his death lists &#145;Goods and Chattles Rights and Credits&#146; of various kinds (including slaves and a long list of moneys owed to him by some of the most prominent people in Jamaica) valued at a total of &pound;16,319 11<i>s</i>. Jamaica currency, or more than &pound;12,000 sterling. This did not include the house property and other real estate mentioned in his will. John Williams had exported sugar and other tropical produce (at least some of it raised on his own land) from Jamaica to England, and in exchange imported clothing for slaves, plantation supplies, and general goods, as well as lending money on an extensive scale. His will suggests that he may have owned his own shipping, and that while he remained in Jamaica, Francis managed the English end of the business.<br>
<br>Williams returned to Jamaica soon after his father's death, and appears to have spent the rest of his life in the island. Long claimed that the duke of Montagu tried to get him a seat on the governor's council, although this was prevented by the governor's objections, and that for several years Williams kept a school in Spanish Town, where apparently he taught reading, writing, Latin, and mathematics. This account is partly substantiated by the Revd John Lindsay (rector of St Catherine's, Jamaica, 1773&#150;8), who wrote of Williams, &#145;I knew him in his latter days, when reduced to keeping of a Negroe School&#146;  (Lindsay, fol. 196).<br>
<br>Williams had inherited a large share of his father's estate, and the deaths of his brother John in 1726 and of his mother in 1731 allowed him to consolidate much of the rest into his own hands (his brother Thomas appears to have died between 1726 and 1731). However, he seems to have lived off his inheritance rather than continuing to augment it; surviving records show him selling pieces of land and the occasional slave from time to time, but not making new purchases. Whatever his abilities as a businessman he appears to have been capable of making a vigorous defence of what he saw as his rights. In 1730, following the outbreak of the first maroon war (an armed conflict with escaped slaves and their descendants that lasted eight years before it was finally settled by a treaty with the maroons) the Jamaican legislature passed an act &#145;for the better regulating slaves&#146;, which also imposed a number of restrictions on free coloureds. Williams protested to the authorities in England that this was an infringement of the rights conferred on his family by previous acts. The council of trade and plantations agreed, and the act was eventually disallowed by the king in council.<br>
<br>However, it was as a writer that Williams &#145;made a conspicuous figure&#146; in Jamaica &#145;and even attracted the notice of many in England&#146;  (Long, 2.475). He appears to be the earliest black writer known in the British empire, his career predating that of figures such as Olaudah Equiano, Ignatius Sancho, or Phillis Wheatley. The only surviving literary work that can definitely be ascribed to him is a poem of forty-six lines addressed to George Haldane on his assuming the governorship of Jamaica in 1759, and preserved in Long's <span class="italic">History of Jamaica</span>. Long suggests that Williams may also have written the words of the song &#145;Welcome, welcome, brother debtor&#146;, which was popular in the eighteenth century, but there are other claimants. The poem to Haldane was in Latin; Long said that Williams &#145;was fond of this species of composition in Latin, and usually addressed one to every new governor&#146;  (ibid., 478).<br>
<br>The ability to write Latin verses was a gentlemanly accomplishment highly regarded at the time, and Williams's poem to Haldane is a specimen of conventional flattery of great personages of a type found in many Latin poems written in Britain during the eighteenth century (including some by authors from the Caribbean). However, it is good of its kind, and it is noteworthy for passages that can be interpreted as asserting both a specifically Jamaican identity and the poet's sense of his own worth as a black man and a black writer. In particular, says Williams:<blockquote>
<div>Ipsa coloris egens virtus, prudentia; honesto<br>
</div>
<div>Nullus inest animo, nullus in arte color.<br>
</div>
<div>(Worth itself and understanding have no colour;<br>
</div>
<div>there is no colour in an honest mind, or in art.)<br>
</div>
</blockquote>In other words, Williams claims, there is no distinction of race in artistic capacity.<br>
<br>Williams was living in a leased house in Spanish Town when he died in 1762, aged about seventy, according to Long. He was buried in St Catherine's on 13 July, probably in the churchyard of what is now Spanish Town Cathedral, though there is no surviving monument or tombstone. The inventory of his goods, which consisted mainly of sixteen slaves, totalled &pound;694 19<i>s</i>. Jamaica currency (about &pound;500 sterling) and suggests that his fortunes had declined. He does not appear to have married, and though Long stated that he had children none are mentioned in his will. Apart from a legacy of &pound;200 sterling to one of his executors, Williams left his property to Charles Bowles, an Englishman who owned several plantations in Jamaica.<br>
<br>Contemporaries as different as the Scottish-American writer Alexander Hamilton of Annapolis and the philosopher David Hume had heard of Williams, though Hume suggested his talents were &#145;like a parrot who speaks a few words plainly&#146;  (Long, 2.477). It was Long's history, however, that made Williams widely known. Long was a staunch defender of the Jamaican plantocracy; Williams was something of an embarrassment to Long's theories of white racial superiority, and he preserved Williams's poem only in order to ridicule it. Others found it easy to see the bias in Long's account. By 1789 the anti-slavery writer William Dickson could refer to &#145;the celebrated Francis Williams&#146; and the fact that Long had published the poem &#145;cum notis hypercriticis&#146;. Others, of whom Henri Gr&eacute;goire in his <span class="italic">De la litt&eacute;rature des n&egrave;gres</span> (1808) was perhaps the most influential, referred to Williams's literary abilities as demonstrating the humanity and equality of all black people, and thus as an argument against slavery. The most forceful expression of this view was given by Robert Boucher Nickolls, the Barbadian-born dean of Middleham in Yorkshire. In the 1788 edition of his <span class="italic">Letter to the treasurer of the society instituted for the purpose of effecting the abolition of the slave trade</span> (first published in the previous year) Nickolls, clearly alluding to Long, referred to &#145;the friends of slavery&#146; who &#145;represent the negroes as little removed above the monkey, or the oran-outang, with regard to intellects&#146;  (p. 46). Nickolls went on to mention Phillis Wheatley and Francis Williams by name, and commented: &#145;I never heard of poems by a monkey, or of Latin odes by an oran-outang&#146;  (ibid.).<br>
<br>While the modern reader may see some irony in the posthumous role thus given to Williams, who was himself a slave-owner, it is clear that in his own lifetime his very existence as a rich, free black man who wrote Latin verses was a challenge to the theories of white supremacy on which plantation societies in the Americas were based.<br>
