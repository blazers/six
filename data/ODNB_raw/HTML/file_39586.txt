<span class="headword">Hine,  Reginald Leslie</span>  (1883&#150;1949), <span class="occ">lawyer and author</span>, was born on 25 September 1883 at Newnham Hall, Newnham, near Baldock, Hertfordshire, the second son of Joseph Neville Hine (1849&#150;1931), a farmer, and his wife, Eliza (1843&#150;1892). He was educated at Grove House, Baldock, was tutored by the Revd George Todd of Baldock, and attended Kent College, Canterbury, and the Leys School, Cambridge. Slender of frame, he stood 6 feet 1 inch tall, and was a keen amateur in tennis and cricket. He enjoyed walking and cycling, but was an unwilling motorist. In 1901 he was articled pupil to W. O. Times, solicitor with Hawkins &amp; Co., of Portmill Lane, Hitchin, where he remained until 1936. The quaint old-worldliness of the venerable firm rubbed off onto its willing pupil.<br>
<br>Those who availed themselves of Hine's professional skills were startled by the visual richness of his office, with its roaring fire in winter, illuminating the spines of his substantial book collection, and the Bukhara prayer mat which adorned the floor. Those who corresponded with him were enraged by his execrable handwriting, which Hine valued for the ambiguities which might arise from its interpretation. The fruits of his study, his old-world courtesy, and his shrewd perception endeared him to Hitchin at large, where he gave many talks and lectures to local societies, on topics such as nonconformity in Hitchin, the highways and byways of Hitchin, and Celtic poetry, as well as on the history of Hitchin. Many of these lectures were expanded and subsequently published&#151;at his own expense and always at a loss, he wryly commented&#151;in bindings of more than average quality, including <span class="italic">The History of Hitchin</span> (1927, 1929), <span class="italic">Hitchin Worthies</span> (1932), and <span class="italic">The Natural History of the Hitchin Region</span> (1934). A further collection was published posthumously by his friend Richenda Scott as <span class="italic">Relics of an Un-common Attorney</span> (1951).<br>
<br>On 11 April 1912, at New College chapel, Hampstead, Hine married Florence Lee Pyman (<i>b</i>. 1888/9), the daughter of a shipowner, and their daughter, Felicity, the only offspring of the marriage, was born in 1915. Repeatedly deemed unfit for military service, Hine moved to Hitchin in 1917, and lived twelve years in 52 Wymondley Road, a house built by the local architect Geoffrey Lucas. In 1929 the family moved to Old Hall, Willian; that year Hine was elected FSA, and the following year a fellow of the Royal Historical Society. He was a vigorous proponent of the foundation of Hitchin's museum, which houses much historical material collected by him. In 1936 he entered into partnership with Reginald Hartley in Hitchin, from which he retired suddenly on 31 March 1949. On 14 April that year, after an unexceptional conversation with a fellow traveller at Hitchin Station, he threw himself before an arriving Cambridge train. His ashes were scattered at Minsden Chapel on 19 April. His wife survived him.<br>
<br>Widely read, Hine's aim was to elevate the writing of history from discussion of political minutiae (<i>de minimis non curat lex</i>) to the resurrection of past souls whose actions, opinions, and feelings were revealed by the documents which outlived them. Attempting to write local history as a <i>speculum mundi</i>, he succeeded best in his highly readable two-volume <span class="italic">History of Hitchin</span>, which was widely praised on publication, although it is now treated warily by some for a want of intellectual rigour and bibliographical accuracy. Blessed with a need for less sleep than most, his study of the documentary records of Hitchin took place from 5.30 a.m. until the beginning of the working day, and from its close until late at night. Much of his eccentric personality is revealed in the pages, and sometimes unwittingly between the lines, of <span class="italic">Dreams and the Way of Dreams</span> (1913), a curious compendium of his own recollected dreams and nightmares. <span class="italic">Confessions of an Un-common Attorney</span> (1945) reveals Hine's attitudes to clients and life in general: in retrospect it is probably too easy to overemphasize the importance there of the frequent references to suicide and disturbed mental conditions, but it is clear from the inquest that he was subject to periodic fits of depression.<br>
