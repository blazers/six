<span class="headword">Fairfax,  John</span>  (1623/4&#150;1700), <span class="occ">clergyman and ejected minister</span>, was born in Norfolk, the second son of four sons and six daughters of Benjamin Fairfax 
    (or Fayerfaxe; 1592&#150;1675/6)
   and his wife, Sarah Gallard (<i>d</i>. 1671). Benjamin was the son of John Fairfax, master of the Great Hospital in Norwich, and was from 1626 minister of Rumburgh, near Halesworth, Suffolk. Sarah was the daughter of Roger Gallard, rector of Ashwellthorpe, Norfolk, and his wife, Joane, whose sister Abigail married the sabbatarian writer Theophilus Brabourne. The East Anglian Fairfaxes sprang originally from Yorkshire: both John and the parliamentarian general Sir Thomas Fairfax were seventh-generation descendants of Sir Richard Fairfax, lord chief justice in the time of Henry VI, John in the senior branch.<br>
<br>John Fairfax claimed that his spiritual conversion followed from an incident when he was ten, the apparently sudden death of a baby sister in her cradle, which put him in a great fear and trembling about his own mortality and eternal welfare. At Easter 1640 he was admitted a sizar at Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, where, after graduating BA in January 1645, subscribing to the solemn league and covenant, and undergoing an examination by the Westminster assembly, he was admitted by the earl of Manchester to the fellowship vacated by the ejection of Thomas Briggs. Fairfax proceeded MA in 1647 but was ejected from his fellowship in 1650 for refusing to subscribe to the engagement of loyalty to the republican government. In 1649 he was vicar of Swaffham Bulbeck, Cambridgeshire. By the following year he was rector of Barking with Needham Market in Suffolk, a living worth &pound;140 per annum. He served as an assistant to the Suffolk commission of triers. Fairfax was ejected from Barking for his refusal to conform in 1662. His father, described by Edmund Calamy as &#145;a very lively preacher, [who] had great success in converting souls to the love of God and true goodness&#146;, was ejected from Rumburgh at the same time  (Calamy, <span class="italic">Abridgement</span>, 2.648).<br>
<br>About 1650 Fairfax had married Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1695), daughter of William Cowper of Mosborough, Derbyshire, and over a dozen years they had five sons and a short-lived daughter, Elizabeth. A second Elizabeth was born to complete their family in 1668. They continued to live in Barking, in their own house, Spalding Hall, where by mixed livestock and arable farming they helped to support themselves. In addition they had two generous friends. One was Dame Elizabeth, widow of Sir Robert Brooke of Yoxford; although &#145;separation was grievous to her, and she thought it unreasonable&#146;, she &#145;relieved many sober nonconformists with great bounty, and most earnestly desired to have seen them legally settled in a publick ministry&#146;  (Parkhurst, 71&#150;2). John and his father desired the same end quite as much as their benefactress. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18476/', "John Meadows")</script>, ejected from Ousden, near Newmarket, who later moved to Stowmarket and married Fairfax's niece, was the other friend. The Fairfaxes could afford to educate Benjamin (<i>b</i>. 1654) and Thomas (<i>b</i>. 1656) under Philip Candler at Woodbridge School, whence they entered their father's college at Cambridge, the former studying at Leiden after graduating. The more practical youngest son, Nathaniel, eventually ran the farm, which he inherited on his father's death.<br>
<br>Fairfax continued to take every opportunity to preach, which more than once led him into difficulties with the authorities. In April 1665 the archdeacon of Suffolk reported how he had been informed the previous year that Fairfax was preaching constantly in his old parish; despite being told to desist, Fairfax had repeated the offence. It is a measure both of his standing among nonconformists and of his skill as an orator that he was chosen to preach the memorial sermon at Dedham, Essex, on 16 September 1669 for Matthew Newcomen, the former lecturer there, who had recently died at Leiden. It was reported to Archbishop Sheldon how the large congregation, an &#145;outragious conventicle&#146;, heard Fairfax's &#145;dangerous words&#146;  (Gordon, 261). Two themes were contentious, to judge from the text as it was published ten years later by John Collinges as <span class="italic">The Dead Saint Speaking</span>, under Fairfax's initials but without his permission. Fairfax dwelt on Newcomen's rejection by the England which had nurtured him and which he had loved. Worse, and given more edge by the time it was published by protestant fears stirred by the Popish Plot, there is the providentialist ring to Fairfax's warning that &#145;some dreadful Judgement may hang over the head of England, and this righteous man may be taken away from the evil to come&#146;  (Fairfax, <span class="italic">Dead Saint Speaking</span>, 21).<br>
<br>Perhaps the stir created by the preaching of this sermon led to the severe consequences of another apparently harmless affair. On Tuesday 5 July 1670 Fairfax and other ministers attended service at Walsham-le-Willows church. After the liturgy was read by the incumbent, the sermon was delivered by the presbyterian Stephen Scandrett of Haverhill, who held no licence to preach. Six local magistrates arrived and, arresting Scandrett, Fairfax, and four other ministers, committed them to the county gaol at Bury St Edmunds. They were bailed at quarter sessions to appear at the next assizes before Sir Richard Rainsford, a judge noted for his severity to nonconformists. Fairfax was one of those who on &#145;a general suggestion&#146; of the JPs who had committed them that they were &#145;persons dangerous to the public peace&#146;, were sent to prison until &#145;they should find sureties for their good behaviour&#146;  (Taylor, 131). When Fairfax had spent five months in gaol, during which time he suffered fever and fainting fits, a writ of habeas corpus was applied for. This the judges felt unable to grant, advising instead a petition to the king. The following March, John's sister, Priscilla Fairfax, then in the service of Edward Reynolds, bishop of Norwich, wrote urging her brother, unavailingly, to conform. Fairfax was probably set free at the following assizes, and on the issue of the king's declaration of indulgence (15 Mar 1672) took out a licence as a presbyterian teacher ministering at the house of Margaret, widow of the clothier Simon Rozier, in Needham Market, thus resuming the pastoral care of the nonconformists of his own parish. Here he was assisted by Margaret Rozier's brother, Timothy Wright of Ipswich.<br>
<br>Throughout the 1680s and 1690s Fairfax continued his ministry, preaching &#145;seven times in a fortnight&#146;, besides frequent &#145;occasional sermons&#146;  (Bury, 36). When his energy waned or his health failed him he found preaching the ideal remedy. He prepared his sermons by meditation rather than in writing, but they were always pertinent and well structured. A sermon he delivered on 6 January 1688, in the shadow of James II's Catholicizing policies, had a similar warning tone to that he had preached at Newcomen's funeral. Much of the sermon contained warnings that were at most implicit, but he opened by reminding his hearers that <span class="roman">Jeremiah</span> had prophesied &#145;against the people in Generall as appears throughout all his Prophessys and he Prophesyed in perticuler in the 22d. chapter against the Royall family&#146;  (DWL, MS 24.13, fol. 35<i>r</i>). Fairfax actively encouraged younger ministers, who were needed to replace the ageing ejected men. When Owen Stockton died in 1680, he preached and published the funeral sermon (<span class="italic">The True Dignity of St Paul's Elder &hellip;</span>), and took on Stockton's congregation in Greyfriars House in Rose Lane, Ipswich, as well as his own at Needham. The family continued to live at Barking, where he buried his wife on 22 November 1695.<br>
<br>The Ipswich Independents formed a separate congregation in 1686, and with the coming of toleration Fairfax hired another building for public presbyterian worship in St Nicholas parish. Swelled by a number of Huguenots sent to Ipswich by Thomas Firmin to staff a linen manufactory, the congregation needed better provision. Timothy Wright joined Fairfax as his assistant in 1698 just as plans were made to build a new meeting-house in the same parish, at the opening of which on 26 April 1700 Fairfax preached <span class="italic">Primititiae synagogae</span>. Daniel Defoe described the meeting-house in 1724: &#145;as large and fine a building of that kind as most on this side of England, and the inside the best finished of any I have seen, London not excepted&#146;  (Defoe, 64). It is now Unitarian.<br>
<br>Fairfax's preface dedicating the printed <span class="italic">Primititiae synagogae</span> to his patron Sir Thomas Cuddon, chamberlain of the City of London, is valedictory:<blockquote>I have so much satisfaction in what my congregation hath done tho' at their great charge, in building such a convenient and decent Synagogue for the solemn worship of god, that I was willing to leave behind me, now that I am going out of the World being in my 77th year, something that might be a memorial of this building to posterity in the next generations.</blockquote>He wrote this on 3 June and died at Barking on 11 August 1700, aged seventy-six. Permission was given for his funeral sermon four days later to be preached in the parish church at his burial, by his fellow presbyterian Samuel Bury, who gave another funeral sermon to the Ipswich congregation on 23 August. Fairfax was succeeded at Needham by his great-nephew John Meadows, and at Ipswich by Timothy Wright, who died a year later aged only forty-two.<br>
