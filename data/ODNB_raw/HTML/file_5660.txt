<span class="headword">Clifford,  Roger</span>, fifth Baron Clifford  (1333&#150;1389), <span class="occ">magnate</span>, was born at Brougham Castle in Westmorland on 20 July 1333, the second son of Robert Clifford, third Lord Clifford of Westmorland (1305&#150;1344), and Isabel, daughter of Maurice, Lord Berkeley. His elder brother, Robert Clifford, died early in 1346, married but without an heir of his body, leaving the twelve-year-old Roger heir to the Clifford lands and title; on 17 March Roger's wardship was entrusted to Thomas Beauchamp, earl of Warwick, whose daughter Maud (<i>d</i>. 1403) he was subsequently to marry. It was doubtless under Warwick's guidance that Clifford, still in his teens, fought in the sea battle of 1350 known as &#145;les Espagnols sur Mer&#146;; in 1355 he accompanied Warwick to France in the first division of the army led by Edward, the Black Prince. By then he had attained his majority; he was granted livery of most of his lands on 14 May 1354, though not then quite of full age, and proved his age on 10 August following.<br>
<br>Clifford was to have trouble recovering his family's position in the north of England. To the normal difficulties resulting from an extended minority were added those arising from his mother's second marriage, to Sir Thomas Musgrave of Musgrave, who even after Isabel's death in 1362 tried to keep Clifford out of his mother's dower lands at Skipton, and was dislodged only by litigation in king's bench in 1366. His problems may have helped make Clifford a careful manager of his estates, which he augmented where possible&#151;he acquired lands at Lamonby, in south Cumberland, and in Appleby. In 1357 he settled Hart and Hartlepool in the bishopric of Durham on himself and his wife, and in 1373 did the same with Brougham, which would be his widow's dower house. In addition he conveyed estates to his eldest son and his brother, both named Thomas. Clifford also speculated in the wardship and marriage market. In 1371 he agreed to pay &pound;240 per annum for nearly three years for the wardship of Ralph, heir to the barony of Greystoke, while in 1388 he paid 500 marks (&pound;333 6<i>s</i>. 8<i>d</i>.) for the marriage of the son and heir of Lord Ferrers of Groby [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/54521/', "Ferrers family (per. c.1240&#150;1445)")</script>]. Moreover he strengthened his local position by retaining members of the Cumbrian gentry; in 1368, for instance, he retained Sir Robert Mowbray, lord of Bolton in Allerdale, for &pound;10 per annum in peacetime and &pound;33 6<i>s</i>. 8<i>d</i>. in time of war, but then replaced the peacetime fee with a lease of the manor of Skelton at a highly favourable rent.<br>
<br>Clifford needed retainers like Mowbray, for he was continually involved in national affairs. In 1359&#150;60 he served in Edward III's expedition to France, and went to France again in the king's retinue in 1369; as part of his preparations for the latter campaign he made an indenture at Brougham with Sir Richard Flemyng of Coningston on 10 July 1369, retaining Flemyng for war in the king's army. Clifford had considerable estates in Ireland, and was more than once ordered to go there to help uphold the English position against native attacks. Finally in September 1379 he was retained by Edmund Mortimer, earl of March, to serve in Ireland for a year with a force of five knights, thirty-four esquires, and forty mounted archers; whether he actually went is uncertain. Clifford was first summoned to parliament on 15 December 1357, and thereafter was regularly summoned to parliaments and councils. He was a trier of petitions in 1363, 1373, 1376, and in both the parliaments of 1377; in November 1381 he was among the lords who demanded the repeal of manumissions granted during the peasants' revolt.<br>
<br>But Clifford was above all, and to an increasing extent, involved in the defence of the north of England against the Scots. He was first ordered to be ready to defend the borders in November 1356, and received his first commission as a march warden in May 1366. Altogether he received twenty-four such commissions, usually for the west march alone, but on three occasions for the whole of the English border area, and also a number of other appointments relating to the security of the north. In August 1374, for instance, he was one of the commissioners appointed to try to settle the long-running dispute between the Percys and the Douglases over Jedworth Forest. In spite of the fourteen-year truce of 1369 (to which Clifford was one of the English signatories) the borders were never truly at peace. In the autumn of 1372 Clifford was licensed to send an attorney to parliament, so that he could take precautions against a threatened Scottish attack, while after 1377, when the Scots ceased to pay David II's ransom, he became ever more active on the marches. Sheriff of Cumberland in 1377&#150;8, in February 1379 he was made a commissioner of array to enable him to resist invasion. In March 1380 he was instructed to remain on the west march with forty men-at-arms and fifty mounted archers, and in November that year he was one of the deputies of John of Gaunt, duke of Lancaster, appointed to hold a march day with Sir Archibald Douglas. In 1382 he was one of the lords ordered to stay at home in the north for its defence, and on 29 May he was appointed to keep Carlisle Castle for a year.<br>
<br>Efforts to keep the peace continued; in April 1383 Clifford attended a march day with the earl of Douglas. But the imminence of open war led in December 1383 to an order for the sheriffs of Cumberland and Westmorland to supply masons to carry out repairs to Clifford's castles, and on 2 February 1384 the truce expired. Clifford was at Appleby in October that year, and acted as one of the commanders of the English army's rearguard when Richard II invaded Scotland the following summer. As part of his contribution to the defence of the north-west, he carried out substantial works on Brougham Castle, attested by a stone inscribed &#145;Thys Made Roger&#146; which was originally placed over the entrance to the great hall, but is now set above the gatehouse arch. But political dissension weakened the English defences, and in August 1388 a Scottish invasion penetrated into north Westmorland and devastated a number of Clifford's estates, including Brougham, Brough, and Appleby. Clifford may not have been there at the time; in May 1388 he had joined the earl of Arundel's expedition to Brittany, possibly as a gesture to take pressure off his eldest son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5662/', "Thomas Clifford")</script>, who was out of favour with the lords appellant, of whom Arundel was one.<br>
<br>In January 1389 Clifford was appointed a warden of the west march for the last time; he appears to have retreated to Skipton, where he is recorded on 8 May, and it was most likely there that he died of a stroke, on 13 July 1389, having restored his family to a place in the forefront of the northern baronage. He was justly remembered by his descendants as &#145;one of the wysest and gallantest men of all the Cliffords of his race&#146;  (books of record, 2.293). Recorded as a benefactor of the nuns of Arthington, Roger Clifford was probably buried at Bolton Priory, of which he was the patron. His wife, Maud, survived him, dying on 28 February 1403. They had two sons, Thomas, who succeeded as Baron Clifford, and William, who married Anne, daughter of Thomas, Lord Bardolf, and who contrived to flourish under both Richard II and Henry IV, in spite of his support for the Percys in all three of their rebellions against the latter king. They also had two daughters, Katherine, who married her father's ward, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/61296/', "Ralph Greystoke, third Baron Greystoke")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/54524/', "Greystoke family (per. 1321&#150;1487)")</script>], and Margaret, who married Sir John Melton. A son Roger, mentioned in a deed of 1365, may have been illegitimate, or may have predeceased his father.<br>
