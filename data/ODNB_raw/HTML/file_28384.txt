<span class="headword">Wadeson,  Anthony</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1573), <span class="occ">playwright</span>, was baptized on 1 March 1573 in the parish of St Peter-at-Arches, Lincoln, the son of James Wadeson (<i>d</i>. 1593), blacksmith. Contrary to the speculation of Eccles, Anthony's father was not the James Wadeson who was rector of Custlerworth, Lincolnshire, in 1576, nor the James Wadeson who was at Cambridge between 1578 and 1586. On 15 October 1590 Anthony Wadeson of Lincolnshire, &#145;pleb. fil.&#146;, matriculated at Magdalen College, Oxford. However, he never received a degree, possibly because his education was interrupted by the death of his father in early 1593. James Wadeson's nuncupative will, made on 20 January, left his entire modest estate to Anthony's elder brother Edward (<i>b</i>. 1568).<br>
<br>At some point during the 1590s Wadeson made his way to London and became involved in the theatre, writing plays for Philip Henslowe. In June and July 1601 Henslowe lent Wadeson a total of 30<i>s</i>. for a play in progress for the Lord Admiral's Men called &#145;The Honorable Lyfe of the Humorous Earle of Gloster, with his Conquest of Portugall&#146;  (Foakes and Rickert, 165). This play does not survive and may not have been completed, but it was probably a sequel to the anonymous play <span class="italic">Look About You</span>, also written for the Lord Admiral's Men and printed in 1600. This historical comedy is one of the half-dozen &#145;Robin Hood&#146; plays written for the Admiral's Men about this time, in which the folk hero Robert, earl of Huntington, is a central character. The witty earl of Gloucester also plays a prominent role, and promises at the end to go &#145;with an exceedinge zeale to Portingale&#146;  (L4<i>r</i>) and free it from the Moors, suggesting the title of Wadeson's play. If Wadeson wrote the sequel, he may have written the original, though Henry Chettle is perhaps a more likely candidate. In July and September 1602 Henslowe lent money to &#145;Antony the poet&#146; for a play called &#145;The Widow's Charm&#146;  (Foakes and Rickert, 205). This may be Wadeson, but a more likely candidate is Anthony Munday, also writing for Henslowe at the time. Wadeson may be the A. W. who contributed several poems to Francis Davison's <span class="italic">Poetical Rhapsody</span> (1602).<br>
<br>There is no evidence that Wadeson ever married, but he did have at least one illegitimate child. On 26 January 1600, &#145;Hellen, daughter of Anthony Wadson, base born of [blank] Slee&#146; was baptized at St Giles Cripplegate, and two days later, &#145;Ellen the daughter of Anthony Weadson&#146; was buried at St Mary Magdalen, Bermondsey  (Eccles, 123). Wadeson is not traceable after 1602; he may have died soon after, or he may have eventually returned to Lincolnshire.<br>
