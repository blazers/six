<span class="headword">Margaret</span>, duchess of Burgundy  (1446&#150;1503), <span class="occ">Yorkist matriarch and mediator</span>, was the third daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/23503/', "Richard, third duke of York (1411&#150;1460)")</script>, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/50231/', "Cecily (1415&#150;1495)")</script>, daughter of Ralph Neville, first earl of Westmorland. She was born on 3 May 1446, probably at Fotheringhay Castle, Northamptonshire. Little is known of her childhood. She is mentioned by name at Fastolf's house in Southwark with her mother and her brothers, George and Richard, when Richard of York returned from Ireland in September 1460. Following her father's death at Wakefield (30 December 1460) and Edward IV's successful seizure of the crown (March 1461), she usually resided at Baynard's Castle or Greenwich. After Edward married Elizabeth Woodville, whose coronation Margaret attended in May 1465, she frequently accompanied the queen and was well schooled in court etiquette. She practised many of the devotions of her extremely pious mother, and was intelligent and literate. As an unmarried sister of the king she was one of the new dynasty's most valuable diplomatic assets. In 1462 there were rumours of a match with James III of Scotland; a more serious proposal was marriage to Don Pedro of Portugal, claimant to the Aragonese throne, but he died unexpectedly in June 1466. By then a more inviting prospect had already opened up, to consolidate an Anglo-Burgundian alliance&#151;marriage to Charles, count of Charolais. Negotiations had begun almost immediately after the death of Charles's second wife in September 1465, but were delayed by Burgundian reluctance to break with the Lancastrians, and also by Richard Neville, earl of Warwick, who favoured a French match. In 1466&#150;7 Louis XI unavailingly proposed no fewer than four candidates for her hand, but the death of Philip the Good, duke of Burgundy, in June 1467 provided renewed impetus. On 1 October 1467 Margaret declared her willingness to wed Charles, who later that month commissioned his mother, Isabella of Portugal, to draw up terms.<br>
<br>Margaret's dowry of 200,000 &eacute;cus (&pound;41,666 13<i>s</i>. 4<i>d</i>.), due within three years, was agreed by February 1468, though only just over a half was ever paid, and arrears remained a bone of contention for the rest of Margaret's life. In May 1468 the necessary papal dispensation was granted and an alliance against France concluded. She ceremoniously left London on 18 June, a temporary reconciliation with Warwick being symbolized by her riding pillion on his horse. Margaret and a large entourage sailed from Margate on 24 June, and arrived at Sluys late on 25 June. Two days later she met Charles for the first time and they were married at Damme at 5 a.m. on 3 July, before making a grand entry into Bruges, where onlookers were impressed by the tall, elegant, fair-haired duchess. For the next ten days widely reported festivities of unsurpassed courtly magnificence were held. Similar events greeted them at Brussels on 23 July, though Margaret fell ill at Aire in September.<br>
<br>Margaret and Charles soon settled into a domestic routine which kept them largely apart; they were together for only 21 days in their first six months of marriage, for 96 days in 1469, and 145 days in 1470, and thereafter, while often residing close to one another, they spent little time in each other's company (a fortnight at most in 1473 and 1474), meeting for the last time in July 1475. Formal relations remained polite, however, and there were many distractions at the splendid Burgundian court, where women had an honoured position. Margaret was on friendly terms with Isabella of Portugal (<i>d</i>. 1471), and acted as an elder sister to Marie, the duke's only child and heir, who was only eleven years her junior. The two women often lived together and shared many interests; their portraits appear jointly in several contemporary illuminations and paintings. Margaret commissioned manuscripts, encouraged Caxton, and, especially in her widowhood, indulged a passion for building and charitable works, encouraging education and strict religious movements. Moreover, as Charles's political and military difficulties mounted from 1475, Margaret took a larger administrative role: she led resistance to the French in Artois and negotiated with the Flemish cities. Her skills as a conciliator, displayed in 1471 when Edward IV was an exile in Flanders, mediating between him and Clarence, and again when Edward landed at Calais with an army in 1475 to join Charles, were taxed by the duke's pressing demands for men and money which Margaret presented to the estates general in 1476, before military catastrophe overwhelmed Valois Burgundy.<br>
<br>In the aftermath of Charles's death at Nancy (5 January 1477) and Louis XI's invasion of Burgundian lands, Margaret, ably assisted by the lord of Humbercourt and Chancellor Hugonet, lent invaluable support to the new duchess, Marie, among whose first acts was confirmation of the extensive dower lands which Charles had conferred on Margaret, including Mechelen which became the dowager's principal place of residence. Margaret also vigorously promoted plans for Marie to marry Maximilian, king of the Romans, despite opposition from the estates, who in defiance executed Humbercourt and Hugonet on 3 April 1477. When Maximilian finally arrived to claim his bride (they were married at Ghent on 18 August), Margaret enthusiastically promised loyalty to him. They seldom disagreed thereafter over policy, with Maximilian solicitous for her personal welfare, while she worked tirelessly in the interests of Habsburg Burgundy. The chief diplomatic purpose of her only visit to England after her marriage (in 1480) was to win back the alliance of Edward IV, in receipt since 1475 of a pension from Louis XI; manuscript illuminations represent her negotiating between her brother and Maximilian.<br>
<br>The accidental death of Marie in March 1482, Maximilian's unpopular regency, which led to civil war in the Low Countries, and the deaths in quick succession between 1483 and 1485 of Edward IV, Louis XI, and Richard III tested Margaret's abilities to the full. Much responsibility devolved on her for the education of the young duke, Philip the Fair, and she refused to recognize Henry VII's accession; her court became a haven for Yorkist exiles and pretenders. Payments for a proposed expedition (<i>Reyse</i>) by Margaret to England in 1486&#150;7, and mention at Mechelen in July 1486 of a &#145;son of Clarence&#146; (her favourite brother), hint at involvement in the conspiracy of Lambert Simnel whose forces were recruited from Maximilian's mercenaries in the Netherlands and paid by Margaret. After their defeat at Stoke by Newark (16 June 1487) new domestic problems, including the capture of Maximilian by the Flemings in early 1488, required Margaret's urgent attention, but her diplomatic intrigues surface occasionally with mention of her envoys at foreign courts including Scotland.<br>
<br>By February 1492, if not before, Margaret was certainly involved with Perkin Warbeck, a tool of French policy, also subsequently backed by Maximilian, whose coronation as emperor in November 1493 Warbeck attended. In the previous July envoys of Henry VII, led by William Warham (<i>d</i>. 1532), future archbishop of Canterbury, had confronted her with knowledge of Warbeck's imposture. But in a letter to Isabella of Castile in August, Margaret maintained he was indeed Richard, duke of York, provided funds for him, and as late as May 1495 wrote to the pope on his behalf. Warbeck's landing in England in that summer was a failure; he eventually found refuge at the Scottish court but Margaret remained in contact. As a result of the Anglo-imperial Intercursus Magnus (27 February 1496) she was obliged to renounce her support for Henry VII's enemies, but it was not until almost a year after the capture and confession of Warbeck (October 1497) that she finally made peace with Henry VII (September 1498).<br>
<br>As a formidable matriarchal figure Margaret's last years were largely devoted to her proxy Habsburg grandchildren and great-grandchildren. In 1500 she stood godmother to the future Emperor Charles V, and in 1501 visited Halle with Margaret of Austria, the daughter of Marie, duchess of Burgundy, who inherited many of the duchess's personal possessions. Margaret died at Mechelen on 23 November 1503 and was buried there in the house of the Recollects (Observant Franciscans), where her tomb was destroyed in the late sixteenth century. Apart from the many portraits and miniatures of her, and nearly thirty extant manuscripts with which she can be connected, her most poignant surviving memorial is perhaps an exquisite coronet of English make that was part of her trousseau, which she donated during a visit in 1474 to the cathedral of Aachen.<br>
