</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Oudh,  nawab wazirs of</span>  (<em>act. </em>1754&#150;1814), <span class="occ"></span>were Nishapuri Saiyids who ruled the major political system of north India (Oudh, or more correctly Awadh) from 1754 to 1814, during the era of its most robust influence. They were the third to the sixth in a dynasty of eleven that lasted from 1720 to 1856.<br>
<br>A major historical region from classical times until Indian independence in 1947, Oudh occupied a riverine plain defined by the Jumna River to the south-west, the Himalayas on the north, the Gandak River to the east, and Benares to the south-east. By 1775 it had grown to 90,000 square miles, bigger than England, Scotland, and Wales combined, and almost as large as the modern Indian state of Uttar Pradesh; it contained a population of some 21 million. Named for the city of Ayudhya (&#145;Unconquerable&#146;) near modern Fyzabad, the land of Lord Rama and the setting for the Sanskrit epic <span class="italic">Ramayana</span>, this realm inherited much of the fading authority and prestige of Mughal Delhi after 1724. It was targeted by the English East India Company for greater control, until being annexed to the British empire in two stages, in 1801 and 1856, the latter being the immediate cause of the 1857 mutiny.<br>
<br>The nawabs of Oudh were Shi&#145;i Muslims whose ancestors came from Persia. In the process of consolidating and expanding their political presence in the north, they invited a steady stream of scholars, poets, jurists, architects, and painters from Persia and other Indian cities. Throughout the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries Oudh thus joined other regional political systems of India such as Hyderabad, Bengal, Bhopal, Bahawalpur, Arcot, Poona, Sind, and Mysore as fertile arenas for the development of a composite, pragmatic, and secular south Asian culture, the medium for which was increasingly Urdu, which gradually replaced Indo-Persian, the official language of the Mughals.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_63568"></a><span class="headword">Shuja ud-Daula</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1775), <span class="occ">nawab of Oudh</span>, was born Mirza Jalal ud-Din Haidar, the son of Mirza Muhammad Muqim 
    (known as Safdar Jang; <i>d</i>. 1754)
   and Sadr un-Nisa Begam (<i>d</i>. 1796). Because he was primarily a general&#151;enlarging his realm dramatically, and losing only narrowly to British-led forces at Buxar in 1764&#151;Shuja laid personal claim to neither poetry, philosophy, nor the fine arts, yet he and his courtiers supported a wide range of cultural and scholarly activity at his capital in Fyzabad. Realizing his value as an ally, the victorious East India Company reinstated him in 1765, and for the next half-century a process of mutual testing and political experimentation occurred. Through the subsidiary alliance system, under which he had to pay for the upkeep of British-officered Indian troops, the way was opened for increasing company intervention during subsequent reigns. Shuja none the less modernized his army during this period, closed Oudh to the disruptive and monopolistic effects of European trade, secured the treasury in the custody of his main consort, the Bahu Begam (<i>d</i>. 1816), realizing that only there would it be safe from British predation, and made large annexations in Etawah and Rampur, the latter with the hired use of company forces. Governor-General Warren Hastings treated him formally as an equal. He died in 1775 at Rohilkhand from blood poisoning.<br>
<br>Under <a name="cosubject_63569"></a><span class="headword">Asaf ud-Daula</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1797), <span class="occ">nawab of Oudh</span>, born Mirza Amani, the son of Shuja and Bahu Begam, the favourite of Shuja's 700 wives and concubines, Oudh changed from a military patronage state to a mostly demilitarized protectorate under the subsidiary alliance. In contrast to his father, Asaf was neither a soldier nor an administrator. Most British dismissed him as extravagant, ineffectual, and effete. To Warren Hastings he was a &#145;cheerful, good tempered and pliant creature&#146; with an &#145;excellent but unapplied understanding&#146;  (letter to John Macpherson, 6 Feb 1785, BL, Add. MS 29116, fol. 150). During Asaf's reign there was a marked erosion in the autonomy of the realm. By steadily coming to control Oudh's foreign relations, border security, army, and much of its revenues, the British profited immensely, while guaranteeing the survival of the regime against all external and internal enemies, in effect depriving it of all but cultural and internal administrative activity. Whereas this meant that Oudh's military-administrative aristocracy was now largely unemployed, Lucknow, Asaf's new capital, became the major patronage centre in all of north India, a haven for writers and artists fleeing unsettled conditions elsewhere. By 1800 it presented, via an admittedly eclectic set of architectural styles, an admirable array of mosques, palaces, gardens, inns, ceremonial buildings, and gateways. Shi&#145;i influence grew, the annual mourning of Muharram becoming a lavish sponsored festival for all communities, including non-Muslims, as well as a rite of cultural legitimization for the regime. Asaf died at Lucknow in 1797 from heart failure.<br>
<br>Asaf's proclaimed successor, <a name="cosubject_63570"></a><span class="headword">Vizir Ali</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1817)<span class="occ"></span>, was an adopted son of the former nawab. In 1780, at the height of pre-annexation British interference, Asaf had solved the problem of an heir (he was impotent, and never consummated his arranged marriage) by adopting Ali from a poor Muslim family and rearing him for the purpose. But he ruled for only four months during 1797 and 1798; his views, nurtured by the secluded but highly influential Begams (dowager widows, mainly of Shuja and his father, Safdar Jang) in Fyzabad, were overtly anti-British. His military preparations to oppose the company were met by Governor-General Sir John Shore, who personally led a military expedition into Oudh, deposed Vizir Ali, and installed Asaf's half-brother, Saadat Ali, in his place. A year later, still bristling at British interference in Oudh and other regional states, Vizir Ali organized a military coalition against them in and near Benares, which, although short-lived, gained the support of Indians from many classes in Benares, Nepal, and eastern Oudh, causing the alarmed British to accelerate the annexationist tendencies already present in their evolving system of indirect rule. Married to Hussaini Begam, Vizir Ali died at Calcutta in 1817 from unknown causes.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_63571"></a><span class="headword">Saadat Ali</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1814), <span class="occ">nawab of Oudh</span>, was born Mirza Sa'adat Ali Khan. As Asaf's half-brother, he had hoped to topple Asaf's clearly ineffective rule in 1776, and almost succeeded; but when his plot failed, the British kept him under house arrest in Benares throughout Asaf's entire reign, as a possible successor. Shortly after being installed as nawab, following the fall of Vizir Ali, he came under great pressure from the new governor-general, Lord Wellesley, who suspected the designs of not only the Afghans but also the French, and who, in &#145;schoolmaster's language&#146;, took Saadat's declaration of inability to pay the now vastly increased subsidy as proof of unfitness to rule. Under great coercion from Henry Wellesley, Saadat was forced in 1801 to cede half of his territory, the remaining portion becoming surrounded on three sides by company lands, and on the fourth by the Himalayas. In exchange, the subsidiary alliance system was eliminated; Saadat henceforth retained all revenues from his reduced territory and never again had to rent British-officered troops for protection. He impressed British visitors with his administrative capacity and application. One described him as a &#145;man of talent and acquirements&#146;, which included a fluent and idiomatic mastery of English  (R. Heber, <span class="italic">Narrative of a journey through the upper provinces of India</span>, 3 vols., 1828, 1.395&#150;6). After 1801 the ruler and court of north India's major successor state were exempted from the need for defensive readiness, a situation which prevailed until Saadat's death in Lucknow from poison in 1814. In the protected, isolated situation created under Saadat's reign, Oudh's educated and ruling &eacute;lites suffered increasing ennui and demoralization. Political and cultural forms arose which sterner British pro-consuls took as effeteness and decadence, justifying annexing the rest in 1856. Oudh's political and military importance had been eclipsed; its more lasting achievements lay in the realms of cultural patronage, social accommodation, literary conservation and renewal, and religious reform.<br>
