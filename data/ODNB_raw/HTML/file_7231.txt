<span class="headword">Davies,  David Christopher</span>  (1827&#150;1885), <span class="occ">geologist and mining engineer</span>, was born on 13 September 1827 at Oswestry, the son of Edward Thomas, labourer of Pentre Clawdd, and Elizabeth Davies, servant, of Leg Street, Oswestry. He was probably illegitimate and was orphaned at an early age; he had little or no formal education. When he was eleven he was apprenticed to Mr Minshall, a local ironmonger. However, an article on geology in Chambers's <span class="italic">Information for the People</span> stimulated a lifelong passion for the subject, and he gradually devoted most of his efforts to geology.<br>
<br>Davies was working as a tin-plate worker in Upper Brook Street, Oswestry, when he married Ellen Davies, daughter of a whitesmith of Ellesmere, on 5 July 1849. By 1855 he had set up in business as a brazier in Leg Street, and within a few years he was writing papers on geology. Thereafter his contributions appeared in the <span class="italic">British Architect</span>, <span class="italic">British Quarterly</span>, the <span class="italic">Colliery Guardian</span>, <span class="italic">Iron</span>, the <span class="italic">Geological Magazine</span>, and the journals of the Liverpool Geological Society, the Powysland Club, the Geologists' Association, and the Geological Society, to which he was admitted as fellow in 1872. Even such humble outlets as the <span class="italic">Youths' Play-Hour and Boys' Journal</span> attracted his notice, and he was for many years the north Wales correspondent to the <span class="italic">Mining Journal</span>.<br>
<br>All the while, Davies was preparing his major work, &#145;The geology of the north Wales border&#146;, but the manuscript was never quite finished, and its fate, like that of his extensive geological collection, is unknown. He gained several eisteddfod prizes including one of 30 guineas in 1880 for a paper entitled &#145;Metalliferous deposits of Flintshire and Denbighshire&#146;, and another in 1884 of 20 guineas for &#145;The fisheries of Wales&#146;.<br>
<br>Davies led the British Association for the Advancement of Science to the Llangollen area in 1870, and became associated with many prominent geologists including Robert Etheridge, Joseph Jukes, John Phillips, Joseph Prestwich, and Andrew Grantie Ramsay, whom he found overbearing. In 1872 he began to turn his knowledge to account and in the next few years opened up bedded phosphate deposits in the Berwyn Mountains for F. C. Hills of Deptford. This was followed by an important paper on the phosphorite deposits of north Wales.<br>
<br>Davies also promoted coal enterprises near home, and for a time managed the Ifton colliery near Chirk, but for much of his life he walked a financial tightrope, often borrowing from his bachelor friend William Whitwell FGS (1839&#150;1920). The failure of a new pit at Ifton Rhyn, with which he was also concerned, came as a sore disappointment although his judgement was vindicated by events: the mine eventually developed into the biggest in Shropshire, and lasted until 1968.<br>
<br>In 1874 growing consultancy work enabled the Davies shop to be disposed of, and a year later the family moved from Coneygreen House to Ebnal Lodge, a smallholding near Gobowen, which helped to supplement their income. Further commissions involved examining and opening many metal mines and quarries both at home and in France, Germany, and Norway. Between such activities Davies found time to write three textbooks on mining and quarrying which received widespread acclaim at the time and later proved valuable to industrial archaeologists and historians. Easy to read, clear, and inviting to the layman, they were published by Crosby Lockwood&#151;<span class="italic">Slate and Slate Quarrying</span> (first published 1878; it ran to five edns), <span class="italic">Metalliferous Minerals and Mining</span> (1880, six edns), and <span class="italic">Earthy and other Minerals and Mining</span> (1884, two edns).<br>
<br>Davies was also a compulsive and devoted Congregationalist lay preacher for forty years; much of his correspondence with Whitwell concerned religious matters. His volume of sermons, <span class="italic">The Christ for All Ages</span> (1871), has fallen into obscurity.<br>
<br>Davies and his wife, who was seven years his senior and who predeceased him, had five children. George Christopher (1849&#150;1922) became clerk to Norfolk county council and was author of many popular titles on adventure and natural history. Edward Henry (<i>b</i>. 1858) worked closely with his father and illustrated his books before setting up independently as a geologist and mining engineer. His book, <span class="italic">Machinery for Metalliferous Mines</span> (1894), formed a companion to his father's titles. It was a favourite of W. H. Auden, who as a boy had a passion for abandoned lead mines, and it was still in his library when he died.<br>
<br>From his earliest years Davies had driven himself unceasingly, but found time to serve on Oswestry town council and to take an active interest in its public library. He died suddenly of heart failure while on board the SS <i>Angelo</i> returning from a mining visit to Norway; he was found dead in his berth on 19 September 1885. He was buried at Oswestry cemetery. In an age when mining was rife with fraud and ignorance of even basic geology, Davies's experience, good judgement, and integrity stood out, and served as an example to others of how Christian principles might be applied to the world of business and commerce. To him, God, geology, and mining were all part of a great and indivisible unity. His books were sermons, and his readers, the congregation.<br>
