<span class="headword">Walker,  John</span>  (1731&#150;1803), <span class="occ">natural historian and Church of Scotland minister</span>, was born on 2 March 1731 in the Canongate, Edinburgh, son to John Walker, rector of Canongate School, and Euphame Morison, lady-in-waiting to Lady Dirleton. He was baptized at the Canongate on 9 March 1731. From his father's grammar school he went to the University of Edinburgh (1746&#150;9) in preparation for the ministry. He records that he was an avid collector of natural specimens from at least 1746, and from 1750 his interest in natural history was further heightened by the remains of the museum left by Sir Robert Sibbald and Sir Andrew Balfour. He was licensed to preach on 3 April 1754, and on 13 September 1758 was ordained minister of Glencorse, 7 miles south of Edinburgh, where in 1750 he had made the acquaintance of Henry Home, Lord Kames, a member of the board of annexed estates.<br>
<br>On 8 June 1762 Walker was transferred to Moffat, from which parish he undertook extensive fieldwork. In 1764 he was appointed, through Kames's patronage, to survey the Hebrides, and to make a report to the Society in Scotland for the Propagation of Christian Knowledge. Walker travelled 3000 miles in seven months. His report, together with his 1771 tour and four other trips between 1766 and 1786, formed the basis of his manuscripts on the natural history of the Hebrides, partly published posthumously as <span class="italic">An Economical History of the Hebrides</span> (2 vols., 1808; reissued in 1812), and printed by Charles Stewart, the university printer, Walker's friend, executor, and former student. His other main work was also published posthumously: <span class="italic">Essays on Natural History and Rural Economy</span> (1812).<br>
<br>Walker was appointed regius professor of natural history and keeper of the university's museum at Edinburgh on 3 November 1779, while retaining his clerical post at Moffat. His lectures were considered clear but dry and formal. His teaching emphasized a utilitarian natural history. His students came mainly from Scotland but some were from Europe and from North and South America. They included James Edward Smith, Tobias Smollett, and Robert Jameson, his successor as natural history professor. Many former students provided him with natural specimens for his museum. Works printed by Walker during his lifetime comprised mainly syllabuses for his students: <span class="italic">Schediasma fossilium</span> (1781); <span class="italic">Delineatio fossilium</span> (1782); <span class="italic">Classes fossilium</span> (1787); and <span class="italic">Institutes of Natural History</span> (1792). His guide to collecting, <span class="italic">Preservatio naturalium</span>, came out in 1796 followed in 1800 by a work on the discovery of coal for Colonel Dirom, quartermaster-general of Scotland. Walker produced a large body of important but unpublished work including geological observations, a flora of Edinburgh, anticipations of Linnaean classification within the genus <i>Alga</i>, and an account of species of the genus <i>Salix</i>. He corresponded with Linnaeus and Thomas Pennant among others, was a close friend to William Cullen and Joseph Black, and greatly developed the natural history museum at Edinburgh. His breadth of expertise was remarkable but his posthumous reputation suffered from his not having published much during his lifetime.<br>
<br>On 24 November 1789 Walker married Jane Wallace (Jean) Wauchope of Niddrie, who died on 4 May 1827. On 7 June 1764 he was elected a freeman and burgess of Campbeltown in Argyll. On 28 February 1765 he received the honorary degree of MD from Glasgow University, and on 22 March 1765 that of DD from Edinburgh University.<br>
<br>On 7 January 1783 Walker was transferred from his parish at Moffat to Colinton, near Edinburgh. On 2 March 1782, he was the leading figure in plans for &#145;a Society for the Advancement of Learning and Usefull Knowledge&#146;, a body established in 1783 as the Royal Society of Edinburgh. Walker was secretary to the physical class, 1784&#150;1803. He contributed seven papers to that society's <span class="italic">Transactions</span> on subjects ranging from the motion of sap in trees to whales, and five to the <span class="italic">Transactions</span> of the Highland Society of Scotland on peat and the salmon among other subjects. He was elected an honorary member of the Highland Society in 1789, and a member of the Edinburgh Natural History Society, founded by James Edward Smith, on 5 April 1782. Walker's lectures on agriculture prompted Sir William Pulteney to found the chair of agriculture in Edinburgh in 1790. On 20 May 1790 Walker was elected moderator of the general assembly of the Scottish church. He was made a fellow of the Royal Society in 1794. He wrote parochial accounts of Glencorse (1795) and Colinton (1797) for Sir John Sinclair's <span class="italic">Statistical Account of Scotland</span> (20 vols., 1791&#150;9). During his last years he was blind. He died at Somerville Wynd, Canongate, on 31 December 1803 and was buried in Canongate churchyard.<br>
