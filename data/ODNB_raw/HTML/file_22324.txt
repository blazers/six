<span class="headword">Pitts,  Arthur</span>  (1557&#150;<em>c.</em>1634), <span class="occ">Roman Catholic priest</span>, was a younger son of Arthur Pitts and Margaret Secoll. His father was a sometime fellow of All Souls College, Oxford, registrar of the diocese of Oxford, and receiver of the impropriated tithes of Iffley, who died a man of some wealth on 10 May 1578. The younger Arthur was born at Iffley, became a chorister of All Souls, and was afterwards for a time at Brasenose College, Oxford. He did not graduate, but left for Douai, arriving there on 26 December 1575. At Douai he apparently joined his four brothers; his elder brother, Robert, who was already in deacon's orders, returned to England as a priest from June 1576 until his death before 1592.<br>
<br>From Douai Arthur Pitts was sent to Rome in August 1577 as one of the founding students of the new English College. Back at Douai in 1579 and in minor orders, he took the mission oath to return to England for the help of souls; he was ordained to the priesthood in Rome some time before his departure for England. He set out for England from Douai on 22 March 1581 with one Standishe, the two forming part of a detachment of forty-seven priests sent from Douai during the year. On 6 February 1582 George Haydock and Pitts were seized in an inn while Pitts was eating dinner. After questioning by Sir John Popham, the attorney-general, he was imprisoned in the Tower. One of the priests named in the indictment with Pitts, James Fenn, was executed in 1584. While Arthur Pitts was in the Tower his brother George also came to the notice of the council. He seems to have been in Oxfordshire where he &#145;doth great harm for he is a wise, learned, and obstinate papist&#146;  (Anstruther, 227). In October, William Allen wrote that Pitts was expecting torture and death. However, he was banished on 21 January 1585.<br>
<br>Pitts resumed his studies at Rheims and came out a doctor of both faculties&#151;law and divinity. He served Cardinal de Vaudemont between 1585 and 1587 and then the cardinal of Lorraine, archbishop of Rheims, who made Pitts his chancellor. He was dean of Liverdun until June 1602, when he was imprisoned for alleged disaffection to the king of France. Anstruther and the <span class="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</span> both believed that the charge was brought against him by a Jesuit because Pitts believed in the desirability of converting England through the agency of martyrs rather than the army of a continental power. French sources indicate that Pitts and a French theologian named Saint-Germain were reported to the bishop of Toul for plotting to kill the king of France. The bishop ordered them arrested, but they were released because of a lack of evidence.<br>
<br>At an unknown date Pitts returned to England for his health and lived with the Stonors of Blount's Court, near Henley in Oxfordshire. In 1623 the pope nominated William Bishop bishop of Chalcedon and vicar apostolic of England. That appointment answered the continued request of the faction of secular priests which had opposed Jesuit influence in the English mission and Jesuit governance of English seminaries in Rome and Spain. Pitts was one of the first canons and an original member of the chapter founded on 10 September 1623. He also became titular archdeacon of London, Westminster, and the suburbs. He died at Blount's Court about 1634 and was buried in the church of Rotherfield Peppard, Oxfordshire. His <span class="italic">In quatuor Jesu Christi evangelia et acta apostolorum commentarius</span>, an exegesis of the gospels and the <span class="roman">Acts of the Apostles</span>, was published posthumously at Douai in 1636.<br>
