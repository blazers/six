<span class="headword">Maberly,  William Leader</span>  (1798&#150;1885), <span class="occ">army officer and civil servant</span>, was born on 7 May 1798, probably at Shirley House, Surrey, the son of John Maberly (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1832) and Mary Rose, daughter of William Leader, coachmaker to the prince of Wales. His father was a manufacturer and army contractor, and also MP for Rye in 1816&#150;18, and for Abingdon in 1818&#150;32. Educated at Eton College and at Brasenose College, Oxford, on 11 November 1830 Maberly married Catherine, who was the elder daughter of the Hon. Francis Prittie of Corville, co. Tipperary. <a name="cosubject_17321"></a><span class="headword">Catherine Charlotte Maberly</span>  (1805&#150;1875) was herself an <span class="occ">author</span>, who between 1840 and 1856 published nine novels and works of non-fiction, including <span class="italic">The Present State of Ireland and its Remedy</span>.<br>
<br>Like many men of his social background, Maberly found positions and advancement in government service. In the army he entered the 7th dragoons as a lieutenant in 1815, and subsequently served in the 9th dragoons in 1817&#150;18. He was a captain from 1818 to 1825 in the 100th foot and the 84th foot, a major in the 72nd highlanders in 1825&#150;6, a lieutenant-colonel in the 96th foot in 1826&#150;7, and in the 76th foot from 1827 to 1832, when he went on half-pay. He did not retire from the army until 1881. In the House of Commons, Maberly was MP for Westbury, 1819&#150;20, Northampton, 1820&#150;30, Shaftesbury, 1831&#150;2, and Chatham, 1832&#150;4. Maberly's parliamentary career was characterized by a tendency to follow his father's political outlook (the elder Maberly turned against the tories in 1819), and by an oratorical style which was said to be indefatigable but ineffective.<br>
<br>Yet it was as a senior civil servant that Maberly came to occupy a position of public prominence. After serving as surveyor-general of the ordnance in 1831&#150;2, clerk of the ordnance in 1833&#150;4, and commissioner of customs in 1834&#150;6, Maberly became secretary of the Post Office in 1836. There he quickly encountered challenges, and some difficulty because of three complicating situations. The first arose from the fact that he had succeeded an extremely able administrator, Sir Francis Freeling, who had led the Post Office with distinction for thirty-eight years. The second was the result of the changing economic environment in which the department was functioning in the mid-nineteenth century. Increasing demands for service from the business community, and complex questions involving the new contractual relationships with railways and steamships, increased the strain on the Post Office and Maberly. The third, and most vexing, entanglement grew out of the campaign of Rowland Hill (1795&#150;1879) for postal reform, launched in 1837. Hill criticized the Post Office on a number of levels, but his most important claim was that a simplified system of postage prepaid on the basis of weight would not only better serve the public, but would within five years regain the net revenue (profit) levels achieved earlier under a system which had put the taxing function of the Post Office before its social and economic functions. Hill's proposal bore fruit in 1840 with the implementation of the penny post.<br>
<br>For the rest of Maberly's career at the Post Office he contended with Hill and his reforms. Hill later claimed that any difficulties and shortcomings of penny post (it was not until 1873 that revenue recovered to maintain consistently pre-reform levels) were the responsibility of time-serving insiders such as Maberly. Such a judgement does not do justice to the complexity of the situation. Maberly did at times evidence a relaxed approach to administration, as his attention was often focused on the management of family land in Ireland. But he was not incompetent. He had a clearer understanding of the economics of the postal service, and a better grasp of the nuances of administering a large bureaucracy, than did Hill. Maberly also worked harder to implement penny post than Hill recognized.<br>
<br>It was to no avail. After Hill was installed in 1846 as secretary to the postmaster general to promote his ideas from within, friction between the two increased. Hill emerged the victor, when, in 1854, he replaced Maberly as the senior civil servant in the Post Office. Maberly was transferred to the board of audit, where he served until 1866. Catherine Maberly died on 7 February 1875. Enjoying a pension of over &pound;1700 per year, Maberly lived in retirement until 6 February 1885, when he died at his home, 23 Gloucester Place, London.<br>
