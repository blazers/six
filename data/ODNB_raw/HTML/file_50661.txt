<span class="headword">Ravenscroft,  George</span>  (1632/3&#150;1683), <span class="occ">merchant and glass manufacturer</span>, was baptized in April 1633 at Alconbury Weston, near Huntingdon, the fourth of the eleven children of James Ravenscroft (1595&#150;1680), lawyer and merchant, and his wife, Mary Peck of Spixworth, near Norwich. His parents were Roman Catholics, &#145;church papists&#146;, who practised their faith privately while outwardly conforming to the Anglican rite. In June 1643 they clandestinely sent George and his elder brother, Thomas, to the English College at Douai in the Spanish Netherlands. George left in May 1651, abandoning his training for the priesthood. Little is definitely known of his activities during the next fifteen years. In October 1656 a &#145;George Ravenscraft, Anglus&#146; matriculated at the University of Padua. Ravenscroft certainly lived for some years in Venice, trading with his brothers James and Francis on their father's behalf &#145;and brought home a considerable capital&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP Venice</span>, 38.265).<br>
<br>By 1666 Ravenscroft was resident in London, importing glass, lace, and currants from Venice, and re-exporting goods to northern Europe. In 1670 or 1671 he married Hellen Appleby (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1650), daughter of Thomas Appleby of Linton upon Ouse, near York, and his wife, Hellen; her maternal grandfather, the staunchly Catholic Sir Thomas Gascoigne, had become her guardian on her mother's early death and father's remarriage. With her Ravenscroft had three children.<br>
<br>Venice was the acknowledged centre of European glass making, but emigrant craftsmen had diffused its techniques across the continent. By the 1670s English glassware was of sufficiently good quality to reduce dramatically the demand for Venetian imports. To complement his increasingly vulnerable import business, in 1673 Ravenscroft established a glassworks at the Savoy, London, in conjunction with a Signor da Costa and other Italian glass makers. In March 1674, claiming to have &#145;attained to the art and manufacture of a particular sort of Cristaline Glasses resembling Rock Cristall&#146;, previously not made in England, Ravenscroft applied for a patent. Issued two months later, this gave him a seven-year monopoly over &#145;the said manufacture of cristaline glasse for drinking glasses&#146;. Simultaneously, he contracted to deliver his entire output to the London Glass Sellers' Company for three years. In October 1674 the company agreed to his establishing a second glasshouse for one year at Henley-on-Thames, possibly in connection with attempts to resolve early technical problems.<br>
<br>The reputation of Ravenscroft's new glassware was severely damaged by rapid &#145;crizzling&#146; (innumerable fine cracks which made it grey and opaque). In June 1676 he certified that the problem had been resolved; in October he advertised that his new glasses would bear a raven's head seal &#145;for distinguishing them from the former fabrick&#146;, and offered a money-back guarantee. Sealed glasses surviving from this period contain a small quantity of lead oxide. Ravenscroft is commonly thought to have added the lead in order to remedy the crizzling, which had resulted from over-purified ingredients containing an excess of alkaline salts, in an attempt to imitate Venetian soda glass  (Moody, 201&#150;3, 207&#150;8). Alternatively, he was possibly using lead oxide already in 1674, but insufficient to stabilize the glass: hence his claim to have produced a distinctively new type of glass, meriting a patent  (MacLeod, 791&#150;800; Watts, <span class="italic">Glass Circle</span>, 71&#150;8).<br>
<br>It seems unlikely that a wealthy merchant of Ravenscroft's standing would have involved himself closely in the technical aspects of the invention and manufacture; more probably, he contributed the financial support and marketing network for Costa or another professional glass maker. Lead crystal proved to be the ideal medium for the sturdier, plainer designs of drinking glasses then becoming fashionable in England, but it may not have been immediately popular. Ravenscroft's enterprise was probably not a commercial success. In August 1678 he gave the Glass Sellers' Company six months' notice to terminate their agreement, and there is no further reference to his manufacture of drinking glasses, although he continued to produce plate glass until at least 1680. A former employee, Hawley Bishopp, resumed production at the Savoy in 1682, and within a decade lead crystal was widely made in England.<br>
<br>Ravenscroft died on 7 June 1683, from &#145;a palsy which seized him and continued strong upon him till his death&#146;  (Moody, 204). He was buried in the family vault in the church of St John the Baptist, Chipping Barnet, Hertfordshire, and was commemorated by a tablet. There is no known likeness. His will, made in February 1682, refers to several estates in Huntingdonshire and Monmouthshire, some recently inherited from his father and paternal uncle. It confirms a contemporary description of Ravenscroft as &#145;a greate moneyed man&#146;  (TNA: PRO, C5/543/74), his assets spread across trade, land, and manufacturing. His father, &#145;the great benefactor&#146; of Barnet, commending in his will George's &#145;industry and good courses&#146;, recognized in him a responsible son and a shrewd businessman, the counsellor and mainstay of his family  (TNA: PRO, PROB 11/365, fol. 113).<br>
