<span class="headword">Stanhope,  John</span>, first Baron Stanhope  (<em>c.</em>1540&#150;1621), <span class="occ">courtier</span>, was the third son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26251/', "Sir Michael Stanhope (b. before 1508, d. 1552)")</script> of Shelford, Nottinghamshire, courtier, and Anne Rawson (<i>c</i>.1515&#150;1588) of Aveley-Belhouse, Essex. Sir Michael's half-sister Anne married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25159/', "Edward Seymour, duke of Somerset")</script>, who became lord protector under Edward VI. This connection prompted Sir Michael's advancement, as lieutenant (1542) and then governor (1544) of Hull. He made an agreement with Sir William Knolles, alderman of Hull, in 1548 for the marriage of his son John with the latter's daughter and heir, Mary (<i>c</i>.1540&#150;1567). The date of their marriage is unknown but it was before September 1557. Sir Michael fell from power with his brother-in-law, leading to his execution and attainder for supposed complicity. The attainder was quickly reversed in Mary I's reign and the family was restored in blood. In 1556 John attended Trinity College, Cambridge, and was admitted to Gray's Inn; he was an ancient of the inn in 1569. A younger son needed powerful relatives to forge a career, although real success long eluded him. Stanhope did use his connections to gain repeated election to parliament for different boroughs, including Totnes in 1571, Marlborough in 1572, Truro in 1586, and Preston in 1597.<br>
<br>Stanhope's marriage may initially have been of greater value to him. Following his father-in-law's death in 1557, he probably lived off the inheritance of his wife. This, however, was entailed on her male children and they had only a daughter, Catherine. If it reverted on Mary's death, at Beauchamp Court in Warwickshire in 1567, to her sister Anne Offord (<i>d</i>. 1571), as it should have done, he may have been in financial difficulties. He appears to have actually resided in the north and helped suppress the northern uprising in 1569, for which he was rewarded with leases of forfeited lands in Easby, Yorkshire, Darlington, co. Durham, and elsewhere. He had sufficient standing in 1578 for Lord Scrope of Bolton to agree a marriage between his son and Stanhope's daughter, Catherine, who, however, died in London in 1581. Having become bailiff of Beverley, Yorkshire, to Edwin Sandys, archbishop of York, Stanhope managed his own election to parliament there in 1584. He was appointed vice-admiral for Yorkshire in 1587, JP and of the quorum for the North Riding (<i>custos rotulorum</i> by 1593), and eventually to the council of the north. With the backing of Sandys and the council of the north he sought to be returned as knight of the shire for Yorkshire in 1587, but was defeated in a disorderly election. By then, however, he resided when not in London at Harrington, Northamptonshire, which he bought in 1590. He did not have a substantial estate in the county but held local offices. Stanhope became steward of the Northamptonshire estates of the duchy of Lancaster, high steward of Peterborough Cathedral in 1600, feodary for Northamptonshire in 1602, and was elected senior knight of the shire in 1601.<br>
<br>Precisely when Stanhope became a courtier is uncertain: he was mediating between William Cecil, Baron Burghley, and Sir Christopher Hatton in 1577, a year before he appears as normally resident at court and possibly a gentleman of the privy chamber (albeit perhaps supernumerary and unsalaried). On 6 May 1589 he married Margaret Mackwilliams (<i>c</i>.1565&#150;1640), the coheir of another courtier, Henry Mackwilliams. They had two daughters who survived Stanhope, and a son, Charles (1595&#150;1675). All three were born at Chelsea. Margaret was related to Burghley through her mother, Lady Mary Cheke. This explains Stanhope's rise to real prominence at court, commencing with the important office of master of the posts in 1590. He associated himself with Sir Robert Cecil and was increasingly favoured by the ageing Elizabeth I. Stanhope flattered her skilfully, as in 1597 when he praised her speech to the Polish ambassador, and became a worthwhile if not always decisive intermediary with her, employed among others by the Cecils themselves. His influence at court was perceived as a formidable problem by Gilbert Talbot, seventh earl of Shrewsbury, in his feud with the Nottinghamshire Stanhopes. Stanhope was first knighted and then appointed treasurer of the chamber in 1596. Court rumours repeatedly forecast his further advancement for several years before 1601, when he became vice-chamberlain of the household and privy councillor. This restriction of offices to Cecil supporters was caused by the factional behaviour of Robert Devereux, second earl of Essex.<br>
<br>Stanhope remained in all his posts on the accession of James I, who appointed him keeper of Eltham in Kent, where he maintained a residence at which he once entertained the king. In 1605 Stanhope was created Baron Stanhope of Harrington: a rank for which, by previous standards and despite his substantial salaries, he was surely inadequately endowed. He regularly interceded with the powerful and the king, conveying James's wishes, and controlling much of the expenditure of an increasingly costly court. Stanhope was a commissioner for the union of the crowns in 1604 and councillor of the colony of Virginia in 1609. He once rebuffed an attempt by the king's favourite Robert Carr, earl of Somerset, to buy him out. However, he was ageing and attended only half the sessions of the privy council in 1612&#150;13. He had been securing joint appointments to certain offices with his son ten years earlier: to the mastership of the posts in 1603 and keepership of Colchester, Essex, in 1607. He relinquished the vice-chamberlainship in 1616 and the treasurership of the chamber in 1618. He last served as a commissioner in 1620. He died on 9 March 1621, at Stanhope House, St Martin-in-the-Fields, Middlesex, and was buried in the chancel of St Martin-in-the-Fields, near his Mackwilliams parents-in-law, &#145;because I have lived there the space of thirty years and more&#146;  (PROB 11/137, sig. 31). His widow survived until 1640.<br>
