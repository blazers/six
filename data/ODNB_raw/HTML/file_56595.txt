<span class="headword">Giudice,  Filippo  del</span>  (1892&#150;1962), <span class="occ">film producer</span>, was born in Trani, Italy. He studied at Rome University and established a successful law practice. By 1932 his anti-Fascist views made his position untenable and he fled to England (ironically his one film appearance was as a boastful Fascist air marshal in Leslie Howard's <span class="italic">The First of the Few</span>, 1942). Living in a basement flat in South Kensington, London, del Giudice made a living giving Italian lessons and established contact with the large community of European exiles working within the British film industry. In 1937 he set up Two Cities Films with fellow Italian Mario Zampi. The company's first film, <span class="italic">French without Tears</span> (1939), typified del Giudice's approach, bringing together a promising young playwright, Terence Rattigan, with a promising young director, Anthony Asquith, and allowing them untrammelled creative freedom to make a film they were enthusiastically committed to.<br>
<br>Two Cities' progress was halted by the outbreak of the Second World War. Early in 1940 del Giudice and Zampi were interned on the Isle of Man as enemy aliens. Zampi was shipped out to Canada but del Giudice was released in September. He brought in Anthony Havelock-Alan, a successful producer of &#145;quota quickies&#146;, to help him revive the fortunes of Two Cities and approached No&euml;l Coward with the idea of making a film about the Royal Navy. Coward's experience with screen adaptations of his plays had been less than happy but del Giudice's willingness to allow him complete creative control tempted him to write a screenplay based on the naval experiences of his friend Lord Louis Mountbatten. Despite the opposition of the Ministry of Information to a film centring on a lost battle and a sunk ship, it was turned into a highly successful film&#151;<span class="italic">In Which We Serve</span> (1942)&#151;directed by Coward in collaboration with David Lean.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">In Which We Serve</span> was the top British box-office film of 1942 and was more successful in America than any other British film during the war. Del Giudice had had to struggle hard to raise the budget&#151;a much bigger one than that of any previous Two Cities film&#151;but he and his company were now firmly established. Critically and commercially successful films such as Leslie Howard's <span class="italic">The Gentle Sex</span> (1943), Carol Reed's <span class="italic">The Way Ahead</span> (1944), and David Lean's <span class="italic">This Happy Breed</span> (1944), triumphantly vindicated del Giudice's policy of choosing talented film-makers and allowing them the freedom to make the best films they were capable of with as little interference as possible. In this he was fortunate in receiving the financial support of J. Arthur Rank who was pursuing a similar policy with his Independent Producers' company. Rank initially offered a distribution guarantee for Two Cities' films, but as del Giudice became more ambitious, he came to rely increasingly on Rank's financial support, and when the budget for Olivier's <span class="italic">Henry V</span> (1944) soared towards &pound;500,000 he was forced to cede control of Two Cities to Rank.<br>
<br>Del Giudice remained at the helm of his company but the lavishness of his film budgets made him highly vulnerable to the criticisms of Rank's right-hand man, the accountant John Davis. In 1947, after protracted disputes over Olivier's second Shakespeare adaptation, <span class="italic">Hamlet</span> (1948), del Giudice resigned to set up his own independent company, Pilgrim Pictures. Two Cities continued as a Rank subsidiary but produced very little of interest before being merged into the Rank Organization at the end of 1949. Pilgrim also fared badly. After two interesting and modestly successful films&#151;the Boulting brothers' <span class="italic">The Guinea Pig</span> (1948) and Peter Ustinov's <span class="italic">Private Angelo</span> (1949)&#151;Pilgrim produced a film written and co-directed by Bernard Miles, <span class="italic">A Chance of a Lifetime</span> (1950). Its story, about a workers' co-operative, was hardly more radical than an Ealing comedy, but it fell foul of the cinema circuit bookers who decided it was too political and it was given a lukewarm and poorly publicized release. Pilgrim tilted into bankruptcy and del Giudice, disgusted with the way in which the British film industry operated, returned to Italy in 1950.<br>
<br>Though in the early 1950s del Giudice was full of plans to make films with his friends Roberto Rossellini, Ingrid Bergman, and Errol Flynn, he was never able to re-establish himself and he died in poverty in Fiesole, near Florence, on 31 December 1962. Del Giudice's generosity and flamboyance had their counterparts in indulgence and extravagance. Rank's biographer, Alan Wood, presents an unforgettable image of del Giudice boating down the river to his luxury mansion in Buckinghamshire, imperiously ordering other craft out of his way. But an extraordinary number of British wartime classics were Two Cities films. Del Giudice's arguments for quality cinema, and his rage against the rigid exhibition system which allowed films only three days or a week in a cinema, before being moved on, fundamentally challenged the idea of film as ephemeral entertainment. The increasing erosion of cinema's mass audience as television continued to take hold lent weight to del Giudice's case for films which would attract discerning audiences to art house cinemas, and the approach he advocated can be seen as a viable and attractive option which might well have proved more fruitful than the inflexible course that the production, distribution, and exhibition of film in Britain actually pursued.<br>
