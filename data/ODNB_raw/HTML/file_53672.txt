<span class="headword">Kirby,  Richard</span>  (1649&#150;1693?), <span class="occ">astrologer and medical practitioner</span>, was born on 13 July 1649 of unknown parentage. In an early work he apologized for his mean education. Henry Coley (1633&#150;1704), a close friend, was probably his astrological teacher. His early works, ephemerides for 1681 and 1682 and an almanac for 1684, were uncontroversial but Kirby became notorious in the mid-1680s when he responded to the threat from popery and absolutism at home and the French and Ottomans abroad by predicting sensational changes throughout Europe. His <span class="italic">Vates astrologicus</span> (1683) promised the death of Louis XIV, the devastation of France, Italy, and Spain and the overthrow of the papacy, before the rise of a great conqueror in 1699 who would bring peace to the whole world. Many of these prophecies were drawn from John Holwell's <span class="italic">Catastrophe mundi</span>, or from the astrological works of Richard Edlin and William Lilly. Kirby found it expedient to withdraw from London in 1687&#150;8, and was denounced by the tory astrologer John Gadbury in 1688. He was able to speak out freely once more after the revolution of 1688, and published <span class="italic">Catastrophe Galliae</span> in 1690, in which he promised the conquest of France and Ireland and a golden age of freedom for Britain, and mocked Gadbury for predicting that the year 1688 would pass uneventfully.<br>
<br>In 1681 Kirby was living in Fulham, but he worked from an address in London, advertising his services as teacher and consultant at the sign of the Iron-Jack, a smith's shop in Fetter Lane. Kirby attended from Monday to Wednesday, his partner Philip Mayle on the other days. Like several whig astrologers, Kirby wished to reform astrology by restoring its original purity, a cause championed by the Italian Ptolemaist, Placidus de Titis. In 1687 he and his friend John Bishop published <span class="italic">The Marrow of Astrology</span>, offering a Ptolemaic account of the zodiacal signs and the planets based on Placidus's work. Kirby's section was dedicated to Elias Ashmole, Bishop's to Robert Boyle. Their partnership foundered when Bishop tried to claim sole credit for the work. By this date Kirby had moved to King Street, Soho, at the sign of the Figura Mundi, complaining that the Fulham rabble had abused him as a witch or atheist. It is possible but unproven that he was the Mr Richard Kirby tried for murder at the Old Bailey in 1687 after a brawl at a gambling house in St Bride's, and acquitted on a plea of self-defence. He was still lodging in King Street when he published his last work in 1693, an account of a fourteen-year-old hysteric or epileptic, Sarah Bower of Wapping. She claimed to be possessed by the devil and the case attracted widespread interest. Kirby saw her on 19 November 1693 and used his account to advertise his success in curing bewitched patients in Norfolk and Suffolk (possibly during his retreat from London in 1687&#150;8). He promised further details in a book then almost complete; as no such work is known, he probably did not live to finish it. The exact date of his death is unknown, but nothing is heard of him after 1693.<br>
