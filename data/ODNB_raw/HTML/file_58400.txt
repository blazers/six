<span class="headword">Wilson,  Walter</span>  (1849&#150;1917), <span class="occ">milliner and department store owner</span>, was born at Main Street, Gorbals, Glasgow, on 21 August 1849, the son of Arthur Wilson, a grocer, and his wife, Jane. He was educated at Mrs Alexander's school, Margaret Street, Glasgow (1854&#150;9), and then at the Gorbals youth school (1859&#150;63). In 1863 he began working for a hosiery agent, and was subsequently employed by three wholesale provision merchants before entering into partnership with Hugh Kean in 1869 to trade as hat cleaners and blockers. Wilson and Kean moved to 68 Jamaica Street in 1874, where they continued as hat manufacturers until the partnership was dissolved in 1876 and Wilson carried on the business alone. On 27 July 1871 he married Jane Williams Binnie; they had a son and three daughters.<br>
<br>In 1878 Walter Wilson &amp; Co. opened The Colosseum, a millinery shop, at 68 Jamaica Street. Wilson subsequently stopped manufacturing hats, and instead purchased stock directly from other manufacturers to sell to the public at wholesale prices. With a ready-money policy, and a motto of small profits and quick returns, his business flourished. By 1879 Walter Wilson &amp; Co. employed 150 assistants and carried a stock of 25,000 hats. Ten years later, the firm employed close to 500, and the shop had been extended to carry a wide range of goods, from drapery and millinery to books and tea, in 23 departments.<br>
<br>As with John Anderson, the owner of Glasgow's first department store, Wilson's greatest talents lay in advertising, marketing, and staging attention-grabbing publicity stunts. He advertised heavily and brashly in local newspapers&#151;on the American scale, as he told the <span class="italic">Glasgow Herald</span> in 1887&#151;using coded texts and unusual lay-outs to attract the attention of readers. His publicity coups included employing up to 2000 of Glasgow's unemployed as sandwich-board men during a local recession in 1886, and celebrating Queen Victoria's jubilee by closing his store, chartering five steamers, and taking 16,000 poor children for an outing to the Clyde resort of Rothesay in June 1887. In September of that year he held a f&ecirc;te for nearly 40,000 children on Glasgow Green; and in 1889 he posted circulars for the winter season from the top of the recently completed Eiffel Tower in Paris. Another widely reported stunt was his offer to supply uniforms for the entire Glasgow police force, in return for being allowed to print, &#145;The Colosseum Tea&#146; on their helmets. The offer was not accepted. The Colosseum was the first department store in Scotland to introduce electric lighting (1882), motor-car deliveries (1896), and sky signs. In 1895 Wilson began publishing the <span class="italic">Colosseum Home Magazine</span> for his customers. Wilson's in-store attractions were legendary, ranging from fairy grottoes and &#145;world fairs&#146; to mirror mazes and novelty acts such as the amazing gravitating woman. Never a man to do things by halves (other than on occasions, such as that of the &#145;Great Procleusmatic Sale&#146; of 1883, when Wilson offered &#145;&pound;100,000 for &pound;50,000&#146;), he opened a book department in 1895, stocking more than a million volumes.<br>
<br>In 1887 Wilson took his brother-in-law Robert Binnie into partnership. Binnie took greater responsibility for the Grand Colosseum Warehouse in Glasgow (as it was named from 1894), as Wilson concentrated on plans to expand his commercial empire. During the 1870s, inspired by the example of his lifelong friend, the grocery chain magnate Sir Thomas Lipton, Wilson attempted unsuccessfully to start up a chain of independent retail stores in Glasgow. During the 1890s his energies were channelled again to expansion, when he opened branches of The Colosseum throughout Scotland, and in major cities in Ireland and in England. The venture failed, because his branch managers often built up customer loyalty and then left to open their own stores, in competition with the local Colosseum. The branches had all closed by the end of 1902.<br>
<br>During the 1890s Wilson opened branches of a new up-market millinery store in Glasgow, London, and Edinburgh, under the name of Tr&eacute;ron et Cie. In 1904 he decided to develop the business, closing the London and Edinburgh stores in order to concentrate on new premises in Glasgow, and opened Les Grands Magasins des Tuileries on the ground floor of the Maclellan Galleries in fashionable Sauchiehall Street. Les Grands Magasins des Tuileries catered primarily for affluent customers and Wilson abandoned his cash-only policy, providing credit to those who opened a deposit account with the store. Other innovations included the American practice of offering bargain prices on selected goods to forenoon shoppers. Tr&eacute;rons, as it became known after Wilson's death in 1917, became one of Glasgow's most popular department stores until it closed in 1986.<br>
<br>Wilson was a neat and dapper (and, latterly, a rather stout) figure, with a shy nature which belied his flamboyant business reputation. His favourite recreation was to take long bicycle rides, and he is believed to have been the first man in Scotland to own a motorcycle. He was also a keen swimmer and in 1868 was a founder member of Queen's Park, Scotland's first football club. Possessing a strong sense of civic duty, Wilson became a councillor for the Gorbals ward of the city from 1887 until he retired in 1896, serving on many committees. He was appointed a magistrate in 1893. He was a justice of the peace, a member of the city's Merchants' House and Grocers' Company, and served as the convener of the printing and advertising committees for the city's great international exhibitions in 1888 and 1901. He died on 17 October 1917 at the Majestic Hotel, Harrogate, and was survived by his wife. Wilson was buried in the Cathcart cemetery, Glasgow, on 20 October.<br>
<br>Wilson was one of the leading department store owners in Glasgow, a city noted for its great retail palaces. His innovative advertising and publicity stunts were widely imitated by other British store owners, and he introduced many of the fresh ideas and business methods he encountered on his frequent visits to American and French department stores. According to the American Gordon Selfridge, who opened his store in Oxford Street in 1909, London's department stores were staid and old-fashioned before his arrival in the capital, and their owners lacked drive and imagination in marketing and salesmanship. Wilson's career provides evidence that nineteenth-century provincial store owners were willing to adopt the most modern business and marketing techniques learned from foreign department stores, and he was one of several who possessed the showman's talents, marketing skills, and entrepreneurial spirit to rival those of his American contemporaries.<br>
