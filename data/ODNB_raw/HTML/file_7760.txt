<span class="headword">Dodsworth,  Roger</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1585, <em>d.</em> 1654), <span class="occ">antiquary</span>, was born at Newton Grange, Oswaldkirk, near Helmsley in Yorkshire, the son of Matthew Dodsworth, the registrar of York Minster, and Elizabeth Sandwith, daughter of Ralph Sandwith of Newton Grange, and baptized on 24 April 1585 according to Oswaldkirk parish register, although Dodsworth himself gave the date as 24 July in his memoir of his life. In 1599 he entered Archbishop Hutton's School at Warton in Lancashire, founded three years earlier, where his schoolmaster was Miles Dawson, who afterwards became the vicar of Bolton. There is no record of his attending university. Few details of his youth are known, but his memoir records that in 1605 he witnessed the execution at York of Walter Calverley, whose murders formed the subject matter of the anonymous play <span class="italic">The Yorkshire Tragedy</span>. In September 1611 he married Holcroft Rawsthorne (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1620), the widow of Lawrence Rawsthorne of Hutton Grange, near Preston, Lancashire, and daughter of Robert and Mary Hesketh of Rufford Old Hall. Mary Hesketh was the daughter of Sir George Stanley, and so by marriage Dodsworth acquired kinship with the Stanleys, earls of Derby. His wife's house at Hutton Grange became his home, which he left only on antiquarian expeditions.<br>
<br>Dodsworth began making antiquarian collections when he was about twenty years old. Initially he began extracting records from York Minster archives and making pedigrees of local families, these exercises being facilitated by his father's position at the minster. He soon enlarged the scope of his activities and began to travel around the churches of Yorkshire, making notes of monumental inscriptions and of coats of arms in stone and glass, and transcribing parish records. He made his first visit to the Tower of London, the principal repository of the exchequer and chancery records, in 1623. Quite early in his career he formed a friendship with Charles Fairfax of Menston, the seventh son of the first Lord Fairfax and uncle of Sir Thomas Fairfax the soldier. He transcribed many of the Fairfax family papers at Denton and Menston; by this means he came to the attention of Sir Thomas Fairfax, who eventually became the patron of his researches into monastic foundations, providing him with a pension of &pound;50 a year.<br>
<br>In the mid-1630s Dodsworth determined to make collections of material relating to the history of the monasteries in England, a subject that had been first opened by three recusant scholars, all monks of the revived English Benedictine congregation, Augustine Baker, Leander Jones, and Clement Reyner, who collected many of the records of their order which were published as <span class="italic">Apostolatus Benedictinorum in Anglia</span> at Douai in 1626. Dodsworth was particularly concerned to collect monastic charters, and by 1638 he had transcribed enough of these to fill a manuscript volume that he entitled &#145;Monasticon Anglicanum&#146;. In that same year William Dugdale made contact with Dodsworth through the good offices of Sir Henry Spelman (like John Selden, Augustine Vincent, and Simonds D'Ewes, a member of Dodsworth's circle of friends) and volunteered to help with the project. Dodsworth was willing to journey around England in search of monastic records, though in practice most of his research was done in London, at the Cotton Library and in the Tower, and in York. According to Francis Drake, the author of <span class="italic">Eboracum</span> (1736), St Mary's tower in York contained &#145;all the records taken out of the religious houses, at their dissolutions, on the north side Trent&#146;, and when the tower was blown up in the siege of the city in 1644, most of the manuscripts were destroyed, but &#145;our painful countryman Mr Dodsworth had but just finished his transcripts of these valuable remains&#146;  (Drake, 575).<br>
<br>By 1644 Dodsworth had come to believe that his undertaking was too ambitious and planned to concentrate on documenting the monasteries of the north of England, and accordingly began to assemble his collections into a &#145;Monasticon boreale&#146;, as he called it. Spelman, who was encouraging Dodsworth's scheme, seems to have persuaded him that a comprehensive account of English monasteries was possible. By 1650 Dodsworth believed he could proceed to publication, but needed Dugdale's help to put his papers into better order; Dugdale, however, was detained in Warwickshire, and when he did get to London found that a great deal of work had to be done to make the manuscript ready for the press. By July 1651 a hundred sheets had been printed, but then problems of finance arose, as the booksellers were not prepared to undertake the publication of a large work on a politically hazardous subject. The two men decided to borrow money to finance the publication themselves. Enough material had been gathered to produce two folio volumes, and Dugdale laboured long and hard to put Dodsworth's collections into presentable shape, for Dodsworth, though an accurate transcriber, had little ability to methodize his material, nor did he have any fluency in writing the narrative prose required for the introductory sections. Without Dugdale's help, Dodsworth's work would never have gone into print.<br>
<br>In the midst of the final preparations, Dodsworth died, in August 1654, at his home in Lancashire. He was buried in the church at Rufford. In his will, dated 30 June 1650, he had indicated that he wished the <span class="italic">Monasticon Anglicanum</span> to be dedicated to Thomas Fairfax and Dugdale to write the dedication; he hoped that John Rushworth, who had been Fairfax's secretary, would oversee the publication. At this stage, Dugdale could still refer in a letter to &#145;Mr Dodsworth's work of Monastery foundations&#146;  (Denholm-Young and Craster, 8). When the first volume finally appeared in 1655, it had the names of both Roger Dodsworth and William Dugdale on the title-page. There was no dedication, and it is possible that Fairfax did not want a book on monasteries dedicated to him at the height of Cromwell's republic. Dugdale claimed in a letter that it was Rushworth who suggested he add his name to the work. It is impossible at this stage to estimate how much of the material collected in the <span class="italic">Monasticon</span> was supplied by Dugdale, but most contemporaries regarded Dodsworth as the true compiler of the work, with Dugdale the assistant who did indeed contribute a certain amount of documentation but who was primarily the editorial figure who gave it shape and ensured its publication. Both names appeared on the second volume in 1661, but the third volume (1673), composed mainly of documents that had come to light after 1661, carried Dugdale's name alone. The English abridgement of the <span class="italic">Monasticon</span> by James Wright in 1693 attributed the work solely to Dugdale, as did the much lengthier English abridgement of 1718 by John Stephens. Roger Dodsworth had been forgotten.<br>
<br>The perception that Dodsworth was robbed of his rightful role as the principal author and mover of the <span class="italic">Monasticon</span> by an unscrupulous Dugdale is of long standing, going back at least to John Anstis, the herald and genealogist who described Dugdale as &#145;that Grand Plagiary&#146; in a letter to Arthur Charlett in 1713  (D. C. Douglas, <span class="italic">English Scholars, 1660&#150;1730</span>, 2nd edn, 1951, chap. 2). There is some truth in this charge. As is evident, the published <span class="italic">Monasticon</span> was essentially the result of a collaboration, but over the years Dugdale was willing to allow the monumental labours of his deceased colleague to be ignored. For many years Dodsworth had also collected material towards a history of the baronage, an immense project, which, like those of so many contemporary antiquaries, never came to fruition. It is significant, however, that Dugdale also developed a project along similar lines in the 1640s. In 1666 he borrowed sixteen volumes of Dodsworth's notes from Lord Fairfax (into whose possession they had come) to help him with his research, which eventually came into print in 1675 as <span class="italic">The Baronage of England</span>. This time he acknowledged his debt to &#145;the elaborate collections from the Pipe Rolls made by Mr Roger Dodsworth, my late deceased friend&#146;  (Preface). Fairfax in turn bequeathed Dodsworth's manuscripts to the Bodleian Library, and Anthony Wood described how in June 1673 eighty-five volumes of manuscripts arrived from York in a rain-soaked condition, and how he spent the best part of a month drying them out on the leads of the library roof.<br>
