<span class="headword">Si&ocirc;n Tudur</span> <span class="st"> [John Tydder]</span>  (<em>c.</em>1522&#150;1602), <span class="occ">courtier and Welsh-language poet</span>, was born at the family home, Wigfair, St Asaph, Denbighshire, the son of Tudur ap Dafydd Llwyd and his wife, Margaret, daughter of Ieuan ap Hywel of Mostyn, Flintshire; both parents came of local gentry families and he himself was termed <i>generosus</i>  (<span class="italic">Wigfair</span>, 497). As a young man he entered the royal household, served the young Prince Edward, and was retained as yeoman extraordinary when Edward became king in 1547  (BL, Royal MS 7 C XVI, fol. 193). He was probably at the court, at least periodically, during Mary's reign, 1553&#150;8, while references in his poems prove he was in London during the early years of Elizabeth's reign.<br>
<br>As yeoman of the guard, and later yeoman of the crown within the royal palace, Si&ocirc;n Tudur may have witnessed Elizabeth's coronation and accompanied her on some of her progresses. Yeomen of the crown were not obliged to remain at court; they were allowed to retire to their homes provided they were ready at their sovereign's command should their services be needed. They held the fee of the crown for life  (Hennell, 303). It is clear from Si&ocirc;n Tudur's own words and those of his contemporaries (Bodl. Oxf., MS Jesus College 15, fols. 273&#150;300; NL Wales, Llanstephan MS 36, fols. 127&#150;31) that in his prime, before he became old and lame, he was broad, tall, and handsome, as befitted a guardsman. He was obviously familiar with the cultural life of the court and the city, which may account for the high quality of his own writings.<br>
<br>From the mid-1560s Si&ocirc;n Tudur seems to have spent more time at home. He was a member of the official order of Welsh poets referred to as Beirdd yr Uchelwyr (&#145;poets of the gentry&#146;) so named from their custom of visiting the homes of the gentry, composing greetings, eulogies, and elegies for a fee. He was taught by the great master poet Gruffudd Hiraethog (<i>d</i>. 1564)  (Bowen, <span class="italic">Gruffudd Hiraethog</span>, xxxv&#150;xxxix), and at the Caerwys eisteddfod in 1567 graduated as <i>disgybl pencerddaidd</i> (&#145;apprentice of the master craft&#146;; Bowen, &#145;Graddedigion&#146;, 131). Contemporary poets in their elegies termed him <i>pencerdd</i> (&#145;master craftsman&#146;); if he did acquire this distinction it must have been at a marriage feast as no further eisteddfod was held. He was both poet and patron, visiting the homes of gentry families and welcoming other poets to his home at Wigfair.<br>
<br>A large corpus of Si&ocirc;n Tudur's poems, from before 1560 to 1601, has survived, scattered, mostly singly, over hundreds of manuscripts in various libraries, mainly the National Library of Wales at Aberystwyth, the British Library, Bangor, Cardiff, and the Bodleian Library, Oxford, with probably no more than three in his own handwriting. Most of his work, in the traditional strict metres, consists of eulogies, elegies, requests, and thanks to some sixty gentry families, together with several love poems. His metrical version of fifteen psalms, composed possibly at the request of Bishop Robinson of Bangor before 1580, was the first attempt in Welsh to versify the psalms. The rest, together with several long poems in free metre, deal with the evils of society, such as usury, avarice, and miserliness, and often bear similarity to the works of London writers such as Robert Greene, Thomas Nash, Thomas Lodge, and Thomas Deloney. However, the fact that some of his poems were written down at an earlier date than the extant published works of the above writers suggests either that all were relying on tracts now lost, or that Si&ocirc;n Tudur was dealing with topics he had heard discussed in London literary circles. His scathing comments on the contemporary Welsh poets, together with his lament over the death of so many poets, harpists, and crowthers, reveal his concern about the deterioration of the traditional poetic and musical arts. His early works give the impression that he adhered to the Roman faith; by the late 1580s he was a zealous protestant. The claim often made that he held an important clerical office at St Asaph Cathedral derived from a misreading of a manuscript by an eighteenth-century scribe.<br>
<br>Si&ocirc;n Tudur married Mallt (Matilda), daughter of Pyrs Gruffudd of Llwynyglyniau, Caerwys, Flintshire; they had three children: Thomas, Elizabeth, and Margaret. He died at Wigfair on 3 April 1602 and was buried on 5 April, in the south aisle of the parish church of St Asaph  (Thomas, 239). Letters of administration were granted to his widow and son on 20 April 1602  (&#145;St Asaph probate act book&#146;, 1593&#150;1602).<br>
