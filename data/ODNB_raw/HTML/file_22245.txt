<span class="headword">Pigot,  Hugh</span>  (1722&#150;1792), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, was born on 28 May 1722, the third son of Richard Pigot (<i>bap</i>. 1679, <i>d</i>. 1729) of Westminster, and Frances (1695&#150;1769), daughter of Peter Godde. He was the brother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22244/', "George Pigot, Baron Pigot")</script>, later governor of Madras, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22248/', "General Sir Robert Pigot")</script>, army officer. He entered the navy in 1735 and on 9 February 1742 was promoted lieutenant. On 2 November 1745 he was promoted commander of the <i>Vulcan</i>, and on 22 April 1746 he was posted captain in the <i>Centaur</i>; he went on to command the <i>Ludlow Castle</i> in the West Indies in 1747. In 1758 he commanded the <i>York</i> at the capture of Louisbourg and in 1759 the <i>Royal William</i> at the conquest of Quebec. During the Falkland Islands crisis of 1771 he commanded the <i>Triumph</i> for a short period. On 31 March 1775 he was promoted rear-admiral and on 5 February 1776 he became vice-admiral.<br>
<br>In 1768 Pigot was elected MP for Penryn, which he represented until 1774; between 1778 and 1784 he sat for Bridgnorth. He opposed Lord North's ministry&#151;especially after his brother Lord Pigot was illegally deprived of the governorship of Madras&#151;and was a supporter of Admiral Augustus Keppel. After North left office in March 1782 Keppel became first lord of the Admiralty in the new administration. In April Pigot was appointed a commissioner of the Admiralty, and on 24 April he was promoted admiral. Keppel then appointed him commander-in-chief on the Leeward Islands station, and on 18 May he sailed in the <i>Jupiter</i> to supersede Admiral George Rodney. News of Rodney's victory at the battle of the Saints (12 April) then arrived and the government tried to cancel Pigot's orders, but he had already sailed from Portsmouth.<br>
<br>Rodney and his fleet were at Jamaica, which Pigot reached on 10 July. Having last seen active service twenty years before as a captain, Pigot had no experience of commanding a fleet. The discipline imposed by Rodney was undermined by Pigot's laxness, much to the disgust of his second in command, Admiral Sir Samuel Hood. Deciding to take the fleet to North America to avoid the hurricane season, Pigot, in the <i>Formidable</i>, left Jamaica on 26 July 1782 with more than twenty-five ships of the line. On his way north he took the fleet off Havana and captured a number of enemy merchant ships. Determined to keep these prizes with him, Pigot slowed the progress of his fleet. He did not reach New York until early September, and news of his slow passage moved George III to write to Keppel questioning Pigot's competence.<br>
<br>Despite Rodney's victory at the Saints, the French and Spanish decided to make another attempt to capture Jamaica in 1783. To defeat this plan the British intended to withdraw troops from North America and send them to the Caribbean. Pigot was to be effectively commander of all British naval forces in the West Indies and was to make dispositions to meet the new Franco-Spanish threat. On 25 October 1782 Pigot left New York with thirteen ships of the line bound for Barbados, while Hood sailed with the rest of the fleet in November to cruise off Cap Fran&ccedil;ois. In January 1783 Pigot cruised off Martinique and then, early in February, took his fleet to St Lucia. The enemy fleet failed to appear, and by the end of March Pigot knew this was because the war was over.<br>
<br>Pigot left the Admiralty on the change of ministry in December 1783 and was not returned to the new parliament. He was twice married, his first wife being Elizabeth, daughter of Peter le Neve; the couple had more than one child, the eldest being <a name="cosubject_22245"></a><span class="headword">Sir Henry Pigot</span>  (1750&#150;1840), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, who entered the army as a cornet in 1769. He became lieutenant-colonel in 1783, major-general in 1795, lieutenant-general in 1802, and general in 1812. He served in the Netherlands in 1793&#150;4, was at Gibraltar (1796&#150;8), went to Minorca in 1800, and accepted the surrender of Valletta, Malta, in September 1800. In 1836 he transferred from the colonelcy of the 82nd to that of the 38th regiment, with which his uncle Sir Robert had been connected. He was made GCMG in 1837 and died in London on 7 June 1840. Hugh Pigot's second wife, Frances (<i>d</i>. 1811), was the daughter of Sir Richard Wrottesley; their children included <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22247/', "Hugh Pigot")</script>, naval officer. Hugh Pigot the elder died at Bristol on 15 December 1792.<br>
