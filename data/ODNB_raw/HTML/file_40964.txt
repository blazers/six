<span class="headword">Saunders,  George</span>  (1859&#150;1922), <span class="occ">journalist</span>, was born at Rattray, Perthshire, the elder son of <a name="cosubject_40967"></a><span class="headword">David Hogg Saunders</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1904), <span class="occ">writer, editor, and merchant</span>, of Dundee and Craigmill, Blairgowrie. David Saunders, a staunch believer in God and the Liberal Party, published poems and articles under the pseudonym &#145;The Christian Democrat&#146; in his paper, the Dundee <span class="italic">People's Journal</span>. His reputation as an insightful political moderate spread beyond his native Dundee, winning the grateful recognition of Gladstone.<br>
<br>George Saunders was marked by his father's values; a strict Presbyterian, he knew his <span class="roman">Bible</span> nearly by heart. He was educated at Rattray parish school and Dundee high school, then went to the University of Glasgow where he won prizes in moral philosophy, English literature, and foreign languages. He matriculated, a Snell exhibitioner, at Balliol in 1881. Drawn by his deep interest in German philosophy, Saunders studied textual criticism and did research on the <span class="roman">New Testament</span> at the universities of Bonn and G&ouml;ttingen. He spoke French and German fluently, but with a pronounced Scottish burr, and read Greek and Latin for pleasure throughout his life. Another literary passion was poetry; he knew his Burns as well as his <span class="roman">Bible</span>.<br>
<br>Saunders inherited his father's interest in politics, as well as his devout Presbyterianism. Although his political sentiments were modelled on his father's, he was not liberal in his moral judgements; if a person, or a nation, offended his sense of propriety or his self-conscious dignity, his strictures were harsh and unyielding. In 1884 Saunders was admitted to the Inner Temple. A chance introduction to the peripatetic editor of the <span class="italic">Pall Mall Gazette</span>, W. T. Stead, intervened and Saunders found himself in France interviewing General Boulanger. Pleased with Saunders's work, Stead hired him as his personal assistant for a trip to Russia to interview Tsar Alexander III. Being a foreign correspondent appealed to Saunders's love of facts and accuracy, his skill with foreign languages, and his political interests. He felt, as a journalist, &#145;like a trout lying with its nose upstream&#146;  (Wilson, 4). Travelling home from Russia, Saunders stopped in Berlin, where he accepted a job as a correspondent for the London <span class="italic">Morning Post</span>. It was a momentous year for Germany; two emperors were buried in quick succession and the young Wilhelm II came into his fateful inheritance. For the next twenty years Saunders, once described as &#145;Scottish to the bone&#146;  (&#145;Note on George Saunders&#146;, Saunders MSS), lived and worked in Berlin, first for the <span class="italic">Post</span> and from 1897 as &#145;Our Own Correspondent&#146; for <span class="italic">The Times</span>.<br>
<br>George Saunders was moderately tall and large-boned, with bright blue eyes and a luxuriant moustache. A vital man, he walked fast, loved to play golf, and astonished Berliners by playing at curling on their city's frozen rivers. His words, like his actions, were forceful and direct and he had the courage born of strong convictions. Shrewd and observant, Saunders's outward reserve masked&#151;but did not diminish&#151;his passionate patriotism and his moral fervour. Saunders was no stranger to Germany, although by the 1890s the country he had known as a student was vanishing. Along with the desires of a grandiose young emperor, burgeoning prosperity fostered demands for expansion and international prestige. Saunders was intensely aware of the effect these changes had on both people and politics, turning Germany, in his view, into a &#145;parvenu&#146; country with all of the attendant moral failings. His marriage in 1893 to Gertrude Hainauer, the daughter of Oscar Hainauer, a Berlin banker and art collector, was a personal and a professional asset. It was a happy marriage, producing three sons and two daughters; one son, Malcolm, rose to the rank of commander in the Royal Navy. Through his German relatives, Saunders had social contact with many prominent people in Berlin. This advantage, along with a thorough knowledge of the language, literature, and history of Germany, often provided Saunders with privileged information.<br>
<br>Diligent and productive during his years with the <span class="italic">Morning Post</span>, Saunders made his name writing for <span class="italic">The Times</span>. For Germans wielding political power&#151;thanks to his heated and repeated warnings as to the true aim of Germany's foreign policy and the unhealthy nature of her government&#151;that name became anathema; the Kaiser himself called him &#145;a first class swine&#146;  (<span class="italic">History of The Times</span>, 3.462). In England it was the reverse; to the editor of <span class="italic">The Times</span>, Saunders was &#145;a Prince of Correspondents&#146;  (ibid., 3.649). Sir Edward Grey, the foreign secretary, admitted later: &#145;We now know that the line [he] took sprang from knowledge, [and] a good many of his countrymen owe some apology to the memory of Mr George Saunders for having underrated his sincerity and knowledge&#146;  (ibid., 3.371, n. 3). <span class="italic">The Times</span> moved Saunders to Paris in 1908. Germany was not spared his deeply critical attention while he worked to solidify the occasionally shaky entente between Paris and London. When his dire warnings came true in 1914, Saunders wanted to &#145;do his bit&#146;; he joined the political intelligence department of the Foreign Office where his experience and expertise were welcomed, earning him an OBE at the war's end. Glasgow also honoured him with an LLD. Saunders lost one son in the war and survived it himself by only four years. His final crusade was against the imposition of an impossible peace on a Germany verging on economic, political, and moral collapse, but he was not heard. Saunders died of cancer at his home, Potswarn, Woking, on 10 September 1922.<br>
