<span class="headword">Ralph</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1174), <span class="occ">administrator and bishop of Bethlehem</span>, was described by the historian William of Tyre, who succeeded him as chancellor of the Latin kingdom of Jerusalem, as &#145;a good-looking Englishman, who was well-educated but very worldly&#146;  (<span class="italic">Willelmi Tyrensis archiepiscopi chronicon</span>, 2.738). H. E. Mayer has argued persuasively that he should be identified with Ralph who between 1137 and 1141 was the chancellor of Matilda, the wife of King Stephen of England, but nothing certain is known about him until he was invested as chancellor of the kingdom of Jerusalem. This took place after 24 September 1143 (when Elias held that office) and before 1 February 1146, and the appointment was almost certainly made by Queen Melisende, co-ruler since November 1143 with her son Baudouin III. In 1146 when Fulcher, archbishop of Tyre, became patriarch of Jerusalem, the crown nominated Ralph to the vacant see, the most prestigious archbishopric in the kingdom. His candidacy was opposed, for unknown reasons, by a group of clergy led by Fulcher, and it has been conjectured that this led Melisende to dismiss Ralph as chancellor because she was unwilling to antagonize the hierarchy: his last act in her reign is dated July 1147.<br>
<br>Until June 1150 Ralph continued to style himself archbishop-elect and to enjoy the temporalities of Tyre, but Pope Eugenius III subsequently refused to ratify his appointment. Throughout this time, as relations between Baudouin III and Melisende deteriorated, Ralph remained a firm supporter of the young king, and he received his reward when Melisende was driven from power at Eastertide 1152. By 20 April Baudouin had reinstated him as chancellor, an office he retained for the rest of his life. In 1153 he and Fr&eacute;d&eacute;ric, bishop of Acre, were sent by the king to Antioch to restore peace between Prince Reynaud de Ch&acirc;tillon and the patriarch, Aimery de Limoges, whom he had maltreated and imprisoned. Their mission was a success: Aimery was released and all confiscated church property was restored. Perhaps in recognition of his services, Baudouin nominated Ralph as bishop of Bethlehem when that see fell vacant, and Ralph's fellow countryman, Pope Adrian IV, ratified this appointment in the autumn of 1156. As suffragan of Jerusalem Ralph unsuccessfully opposed the election of Amaury de Nesle as patriarch in 1157&#150;8, perhaps because he was Queen Melisende's candidate.<br>
<br>In King Amaury's reign (1163&#150;74) the Byzantine emperor, Manuel I Komnenos, helped to fund an extensive programme of mosaic decoration in Ralph's cathedral, the church of the Holy Nativity: the nave mosaics depicting general and provincial councils of the church, with inscriptions in Latin and Greek, were designed to emphasize the unity of the Orthodox and Latin churches, and no doubt represented a view of the church that Ralph shared. Ralph took an active part in warfare against the Muslims. He was severely wounded in battle in 1167 in the course of King Amaury's Egyptian campaign; but he had recovered by the spring of 1170 when he carried the Holy Cross on a campaign in Transjordan, while in the following December he helped Amaury repel Saladin's attack on Darum. Although two western sources record the presence of a bishop of Bethlehem in northern France in the winter of 1169&#150;70, the writers may have confused him with the bishop of Banias (Belinas in Latin) who is known to have been there. Ralph is last recorded in a document of 18 April 1174: he died soon after and was buried in the chapter house of the Augustinian canons at Bethlehem.<br>
