<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Farren,  William</span>  (1786&#150;1861), <span class="occ">actor</span>, was born in London on 13 May 1786, the second son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/64336/', "William Farren (1754&#150;1795)")</script> and his common-law wife, Mary Orton, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Mansell (1748&#150;1820), both of whom were actors. A wealthy benefactor, Percival Pott, enabled the family to enjoy a luxurious style of living. Young William had a substantial inheritance, including a good provision from his father and &pound;6000 from Pott. He attended Dr Barrow's school in Soho Square, then possibly served an abortive apprenticeship with a Wolverhampton attorney. About 1806 he began acting under his brother Percy's management at Plymouth. Although he was only twenty, he chose the &#145;old man's&#146; line of business, playing roles such as Lovegold in <span class="italic">The Miser</span> and Sir Archy Macsarcasm in <span class="italic">Love &agrave; la Mode</span>. Later he acted at various theatres on the Worcester and Shrewsbury circuits, and appeared as all the principal &#145;old men and Irishmen&#146;. By 1812, if not earlier, he was at the Theatre Royal, Dublin, where, reportedly, he made a successful d&eacute;but as Lovegold, followed by Sir Adam Contest in <span class="italic">The Wedding Day</span>. Playbills list him in comic and character parts in every conceivable kind of production. Some time before 1816 he married a young Dublin woman, &#145;of good family&#146;, named Mary (surname unknown).<br>
<br>In 1818 Farren left Dublin for an engagement at Covent Garden. His d&eacute;but, on 10 September, as Sir Peter Teazle in <span class="italic">The School for Scandal</span>, was triumphant: the critic of <span class="italic">The Times</span> (11 September) had seldom witnessed a more &#145;completely successful&#146; first performance or one showing &#145;so valuable an acquisition&#146; to the London stage. His next portrayal was Lord Ogleby in <span class="italic">The Clandestine Marriage</span>, which was equally applauded. These two eighteenth-century roles remained lifetime favourites. Farren continued to draw enthusiastic audiences in other characters, and by the end of the season he had established himself as one of the most admired actors in London.<br>
<br>About 1821 Farren provided for his wife's separate maintenance and began living with the actress Mrs Faucit (legally <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/49704/', "Harriet Elizabeth Savill, n&#233;e Diddear) (1789&#150;1857)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/49703/', "Saville, John Faucit")</script>], also giving a home to her daughters Harriet and Helena [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9200/', "Faucit, Helen")</script>]. The couple had two sons of their own, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/33090/', "William Farren")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9192/', "Henry Farren")</script>, both of whom became actors. The couple were finally to marry, on 16 November 1853, after both had been widowed. Farren remained at Covent Garden through the 1827&#150;8 season, and from 1824 onwards acted during the summers at the Haymarket. He had numerous roles in favourite old comedies and in farces and <i>petites com&eacute;dies</i>, old and new. In October 1828 he began a connection with Drury Lane that lasted for nine seasons (though during the same period he made occasional appearances at Covent Garden). Here, in addition to his usual line, he took some character parts, such as Kent in <span class="italic">King Lear</span> and Polonius in <span class="italic">Hamlet</span>. As a Witch in <span class="italic">Macbeth</span> (1831) he gave not the usual ludicrous portrayal, but one filled with &#145;grotesque horror&#146;. Two comic roles in this period, both of French derivation&#151;Hugo Bambino, an eccentric pedant in <span class="italic">The Court Jester</span> (Haymarket, 1832) and Michael Perrin, a simple country cur&eacute; in <span class="italic">Secret Service</span> (Drury Lane, 1834)&#151;were a new, more pathetic type, in which he would excel: an unworldly person who tries, sometimes with ironic success, to do good without understanding the situation.<br>
<br>In October 1837 Farren joined Madame Vestris's Olympic, and stayed until 1839, when she gave up this theatre; he then moved with her to Covent Garden for the three seasons of her management, ending in 1841&#150;2. His most famous new role there was Sir Harcourt Courtly, a nineteenth-century Lord Ogleby in Boucicault's highly successful <span class="italic">London Assurance</span> (March 1841). In 1842 the Haymarket, by then almost a year-round theatre, became Farren's constant home. His most notable characters at this time were the title roles in <span class="italic">Grandfather Whitehead</span> and <span class="italic">Old Parr</span>, the former a benevolent old man almost in second childhood, the latter a miraculously hearty survivor at the age of 120 (act I) but little more than a vegetable at 148 (act II). Sentimental though these plays sound, Farren made the characters so convincingly lifelike that <span class="italic">The Times</span> (10 October 1843) hailed his performances as a turning point in English acting.<br>
<br>On 24 October 1843, when concluding a performance of Old Parr, Farren suffered a stroke, which partially paralysed him and left him temporarily speechless. By 22 April 1844, however, he had recovered sufficiently to return to the stage. His articulation was never so clear afterwards, but he continued to act for another decade. During the first four years he was mainly at the Haymarket, where he had another &#145;simple-hearted&#146; character, a trouble-making country clergyman named Jesse Rural, in Boucicault's <span class="italic">Old Heads and Young Hearts</span>; this comedy played for approximately eighty nights. By the autumn of 1848 Farren had left the Haymarket and was probably touring in the provinces, as he had often done in free periods. On 16 April 1849 he began acting at the New Strand Theatre, where his son Henry had become manager a week earlier; on 28 May he himself took over the management, which he retained until August 1850.<br>
<br>On 2 September 1850 Farren became manager of the Olympic, taking his company, a group known for their ensemble acting, with him. He occasionally engaged visiting stars, but, more importantly, he introduced Frederick Robson, whose astonishing performances revealed the serious possibilities in Shakespearian burlesques. Farren left the Olympic with a farewell benefit on 22 September 1853, which featured his Lord Ogleby and Robson's Shylock. This was evidently his last full performance in London, but he made some farewell appearances in the provinces during the next year or so. On 16 July 1855 he took his final farewell of the stage in a huge benefit at the Haymarket, in which numerous actors joined to honour him; his own contribution was Lord Ogleby's second act. On 24 September 1861 he died at his home, 23 Brompton Square.<br>
<br>Farren had a tall, elegant figure, grey eyes, and neat facial features except for rather full lips. Some personal traits, such as his occasional dogmatism and his relentless pursuit of money, interfered with his popularity among colleagues; least endearing was his extreme egotism, illustrated by his boast that he was &#145;the only cock-salmon in the market&#146;, and by his attempts to monopolize audience attention by appearing full face. More attractive were his good-natured response to practical jokes and his easy, courteous manner when not on his dogmatic high horse. Professionally he was highly respected. From his first London appearance to his last, when <span class="italic">The Times</span> (17 July 1855) called him &#145;one of the most finished artists that ever appeared on the English stage&#146;, critics repeatedly described his performances as &#145;chaste&#146;, &#145;subtle&#146;, &#145;polished&#146;, &#145;exquisite&#146;. Such terms, whatever their connotations for modern readers, were often paired with &#145;natural&#146;, implying avoidance of exaggeration. In acting old comedy Farren assumed the artificial urbanity of Georgian society but, by nuance and &#145;semitone&#146;, suggested suppressed or conflicting emotion. His dry, understated acting lacked Dowton's explosive power and Liston's &#145;rich, mellow&#146; humour, but it was more natural than Dowton's and more true to character than Liston's. Pathos, which often mingled with ridicule in his portrayals, became uppermost in parts such as Grandfather Whitehead and Old Parr; this emphasis, combined with the plays' domestic atmosphere, enhanced the effect of everyday realism. It has been acutely observed that Farren was a transitional actor, using at first the old, artificial style for traditional roles, then developing a more realistic style for some later characters, yet retaining the original one for his old parts. Without apparently changing his basic principles, he adapted his techniques to the kind of play in which he was acting. Farren was a theatrical sophisticate, equally at home in period comedy and modern plays; he was, besides, one of the finest actors of his century.<br>
