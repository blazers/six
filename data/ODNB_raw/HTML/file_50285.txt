<span class="headword">Henn,  Thomas Rice</span>  (1901&#150;1974), <span class="occ">literary scholar and writer</span>, was born on 10 November 1901 at the family home, Paradise, Ennis, co. Clare, Ireland, the fifth and youngest child of Francis Blackburne Henn (1845&#150;1915), barrister, and resident magistrate at Bellina and later at Sligo, and his wife, Helen (1857&#150;1936), daughter of Colonel Gore, master of foxhounds, of Woodlawn, co. Clare. He was named after his grandfather <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/12937/', "Thomas Rice Henn (1849&#150;1880)")</script>, a lieutenant of the Royal Engineers. Henn had an absorbing boyhood: a member of an old Anglo-Irish family, which had lived in the district since the seventeenth century, he was much occupied with field sports. Coached by his father, he was an excellent shot by the age of eight. None of this was done solely for sport, but also to provide food: everything he or his father brought down was either used by the household or given away. He enjoyed shooting throughout his life, but later became a noted angler. One of his lifelong interests, fly-tying, arose from this; he wrote a manual, <span class="italic">Practical Fly-Tying</span> (1950), which emphasised the aesthetic appeal of the craft. Among other sports, rowing and sailing especially claimed his interest.<br>
<br>Much of Henn's youth was overshadowed by the &#145;troubles&#146;, which originated long before the Easter rising of 1916. Yet he bore no enmity towards his republican neighbours, and recalled that as a boy he went snipe-shooting with one who was a known murderer. This did not exempt the Henn family from unwelcome attentions and death threats, and there were also rick- and stack-burnings, and the destruction of trees and plantations, and of Anglo-Irish buildings. Henn, aged fourteen at the time of the rising, remembered a potentially ugly incident from his boyhood. An execution squad arrived early one morning, having heard that he possessed a bomb. The &#145;bomb&#146; turned out to be the sound-box of a gramophone in a box. When he played part of a record with it, all ended happily, with the republicans entertained to breakfast, followed by a snapshot by Henn of the firing party with rifles at the ready. Indeed the Irish countryside was menacing. There were seventeen raids on Paradise, by republicans and the British, both of whom looted anything that took their fancy. To all of this, however, Henn endeavoured to maintain a tolerant attitude. Well-read in Irish history, he was fully aware of the deep divisions of Irish life.<br>
<br>Francis Henn died on 10 November 1915 (Henn's fourteenth birthday), leaving his wife and family almost penniless: none of his tenants had paid rent for years, and his pension terminated with his death. Consequently Helen Henn was unable to support her son in his ambition to follow the same career as his father at the Irish bar. He was, however, fortunate enough to win at his Fermoy preparatory school a mathematical scholarship for Aldenham School, Hertfordshire, where his sporting proficiency led him in time to the school captaincy. He worked well in class, and in due course obtained a scholarship to read modern languages at St Catharine's College, Cambridge. In itself this was insufficient to support him, so Aldenham added an exhibition for three years. There still remained a formidable shortfall, but the bishop of Burnley, Henn's uncle, made up most of this, and he was able to become an undergraduate in 1919.<br>
<br>Among Cambridge dons who strongly influenced Henn was Sir Arthur Quiller-Couch (&#145;Q&#146;). Even greater was the influence of E. M. W. Tillyard, lecturer in English from 1926 to 1950, and later master of Jesus College, who was Henn's supervisor and director of studies for his first two years, and eventually became a close friend. Cambridge had many first-class humanistic dons in the 1920s and 1930s, among whom were the medievalist G. G. Coulton, the literary historian Sir Herbert Grierson, the author and scholar F. L. Lucas, the eccentric Mansfield Forbes, creator of Finella, an art deco house in Queen's Road, and S. C. Roberts, Johnsonian, Shakespearian, and wit. It was a rich background, and Henn made the most of it, accumulating much scholarly benefit and friendship. He also made good use of the sport provided at Cambridge, above all becoming an enthusiastic oarsman during his undergraduate years. In rowing he enjoyed and appreciated above all the intermittently attainable perfection of rhythm.<br>
<br>Henn left Cambridge in 1923, after one extra term, having in 1922 obtained a first in modern languages, and various prizes. After some disappointments he accepted a job as an assistant in the Burmah Oil Company at Calcutta. Apart from some rowing and shooting, and despite becoming fluent in Urdu and learning much about big business, he was bored and unhappy, suffered intermittent attacks of dengue and malaria, and lost weight. Also the company rules forbade marriage until after three years of service. Thus, when he was given an opportunity to return home, he accepted immediately, not least because during his last months in Cambridge he had met his future wife, (Mary) Enid Roberts (<i>b</i>. 1900/01), daughter of Edward Augustus Roberts MD of London, who was at Newnham College, reading modern languages, literature, and history. They married on 25 September 1926, some seventeen months after his return.<br>
<br>Having come back to St Catharine's in April 1925, Henn at once began to teach and examine, and to coach oarsmen. He also became director of studies for several other colleges. On Monday evenings his attic rooms at St Catharine's became a centre where his pupils and others met for discussion, argument, coffee, and tobacco. These gatherings became so popular that it became necessary to restrict them to members of colleges where Henn had an official position. In 1926 he became a fellow of St Catharine's, was prelector in 1927&#150;35, tutor in 1934, and senior tutor in 1946&#150;56. Former undergraduates claimed that Henn never taught in a conventional manner, but used their enthusiasm to guide them along suitable academic paths, while quoting freely from his capacious memory line after line of pertinent poetry and prose. Above all he encouraged his pupils to think creatively, and not to allow mere facts to dominate their thought. At times brusque and formidable, he invariably returned quickly to half-shy calm.<br>
<br>In 1936 Henn visited the south of France to recuperate from surgery for the removal of a fibroma, caused by an earlier appendectomy. Here the sight of peasant children driving the herds and flocks to the hills to graze, and to rest later beside the waters, gave him the feeling that for the first time he was seeing the true background of pastoral poetry. Henn's output as a poet was never extensive, but from this time it began to mature.<br>
<br>During the 1930s Henn suffered from outbreaks of almost suicidal depression. He was helped through these by the noted psychiatrist Leonard Foster Browne. In one of his early consultations he broke down, weeping uncontrollably. He had never come to terms with his father's death, the ensuing poverty at Paradise, the rebellion, and his own unsuccessful attempts to do his duty to his mother and to the family estate. All this had preyed on his mind for nine years, finally reducing him to neurosis. With Browne's guidance, and by reading widely in the most important works in psychiatry and psychology, especially Jung's, he recovered. These experiences, disturbing though they were, enabled him to identify and help and advise undergraduates similarly afflicted.<br>
<br>In 1939, at the outbreak of war, Henn continued with his lectures, but felt dissatisfied with doing nothing (as he thought) towards the prosecution of the war, and tried, at first unsuccessfully, to join the armed forces. His call finally came at the time of Dunkirk, when the War Office commissioned him as a subaltern in the intelligence corps. After several short postings, he was sent to southern command, which provided him with a room (he was then its only intelligence officer who knew German) at Wilton House, near Salisbury. He was instructed to learn and note all he could about the German army. It was thought that a German invasion was imminent, probably not later than September or October 1940, and the Henns decided that they ought to take advantage of an offer made by Yale University to take in children of Oxford and Cambridge dons, and to assume responsibility for them for the duration of the war, and for their education if their fathers were killed. So Enid and their two children, Rosalind (<i>b</i>. 1927) and Desmond (1929&#150;1964) were shipped off to America, Henn remaining to perform his military duties. Enid later returned to join the WAAF; like her husband, she was fluent in German, and was sent to Bletchley Park, where she later took charge of intelligence concerning German night-fighters.<br>
<br>After various postings Henn was sent in August 1944 on a mission to Italy, where he was appointed deputy assistant chief of staff at allied forces headquarters. He was later promoted to brigadier, working under Lieutenant-General Sir Brian Robertson and General Sir John Harding: as such he had to deal with refugees and displaced persons, and to investigate Nazi atrocities. In some of his activities he found use for his classical knowledge, as when he sought to ease the way for a Yugoslav prelate to visit the pope, by writing a note in Latin to the Holy See. With the ending of hostilities things became more arduous: he had to supervise distribution of food and other supplies, to investigate partisans paying off old scores, and to deal with the lines of refugees, and with Nazi loot found in caves. Amid such mounting problems he was not sorry when in August 1945 he left Italy, and after demobilization was able to return to St Catharine's as senior tutor. He had been twice mentioned in dispatches, and was appointed CBE and the US Legion of Merit.<br>
<br>At St Catharine's, Henn worked with characteristic application, modernizing his section of the college administration and expanding the annual undergraduate intake. He was also appointed to the faculty board of English, later becoming its chairman. Soon after his return to Cambridge he began to study the life and work of W. B. Yeats, at that time neglected and even denigrated by Dublin society. Spurred by this, Henn decided to take action to reverse the trend. He was probably the only man in England who knew intimately the Yeats country in Sligo and Clare, and as a beginning made a point in 1948 of revisiting Sligo, which he had not seen since 1913. At the same time he visited Yeats's widow in Dublin. He found Sligo little changed, but was sad to find Paradise neglected, almost in ruins; even the soil was being ruined by the invasion of the sea through a breached sea wall, leaving everywhere dead trees and grey mud. Much encouraged by his former supervisor, Tillyard, Henn wrote his magisterial book on Yeats's work, <span class="italic">The Lonely Tower</span> (1950; rev. edn, 1965), which contributed more than any other single study to the revival of Yeats's reputation.<br>
<br>A Yeats Society had been founded in Sligo, out of which grew the Yeats International Summer School, which met for two weeks each August. Henn became its director until his retirement in 1969; even after that he occasionally lectured. Scholars from all over the world travelled there to lecture and take seminars, and there was large student attendance, indicating the growing international interest in Yeats, an interest largely attributable to Henn's indefatigable scholarship and enthusiasm.<br>
<br>On 29 December 1964 Henn's only son committed suicide. In many ways a brilliant young man, Desmond nevertheless found difficulty in having meaningful relationships with others. He was homosexual and Tom detested homosexuality. If he suspected it in any student he would pass him over without comment to an assistant supervisor. The discovery that his son was so inclined must have been traumatic. Soon another blow fell: the destruction by fire of Paradise on 6 October 1970. The official explanation of the cause of the fire was a fault in the central-heating system installed by its new German owner, but suspicions remain that it was the work of republicans. Whatever its cause, the fire marked the end of a family era as surely as had the death of Desmond.<br>
<br>Henn retired from his Cambridge appointments in 1969, when he became an emeritus fellow of St Catharine's. He had been president (deputy head of house) of St Catharine's in 1959&#150;62, and university reader in Anglo-Irish literature in 1968&#150;69, and had undertaken much work elsewhere, including a brief visiting professorship at Trinity College, Dublin. His wide-ranging scholarship is reflected in his books, especially, as author, <span class="italic">The Lonely Tower</span>, <span class="italic">The Harvest of Tragedy</span> (1956), <span class="italic">The Bible as Literature</span> (1970), <span class="italic">Last Essays</span> (1963), and, as editor, <span class="italic">The Plays and Poems of J. M. Synge</span> (1963). He had the gift of communicating enthusiasm to his readers, although his writing was not without imperfections: he sometimes quoted other writers inaccurately, and sometimes used tabulations and diagrams instead of relying on his excellent prose, which exemplified the best English usage. He tried especially to persuade scientific writers to express themselves in good, clear, jargon-free prose. For such writers he wrote <span class="italic">The Apple and the Spectroscope</span> (1951), and <span class="italic">Science in Writing</span> (1960).<br>
<br>Apart from quoting it here and there in his other writings, and despite its undoubted quality, Henn published little poetry. There are two small collections: <span class="italic">Shooting a Bat</span> (1962), and <span class="italic">Philoctetes and other Poems</span>, published posthumously as a section in his autobiography, <span class="italic">Five Arches</span> (1980). Despite its sometimes pessimistic note, Henn's poetry confirms his deep religious mysticism, which is present even in his threnody on the death of Desmond: &#145;29 December 1964&#146;.<br>
<br>Henn was a heavily built yet athletic man, but in his later years had poor health. An arthritic hip, legacy of a rough landing in an aircraft during the war, limited his mobility. Some time before he died he suffered a major stroke, during which his heart stopped. After regaining partial health, he expressed disappointment that in his experience there was only oblivion, nothing of what he called &#145;the grandeur of death&#146;. He died at 12 Barrow Road, Cambridge, from coronary thrombosis on 10 December 1974, and his funeral was held on the 16th at St Mark's Church, Barton Road, Cambridge.<br>
