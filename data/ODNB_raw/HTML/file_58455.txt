<span class="headword">Adams,  Henry</span>  (1713&#150;1805), <span class="occ">shipbuilder</span>, was born in Deptford, the son of Anthony Adams, a shipwright at the town's royal dockyard. In 1726 he began his apprenticeship to Benjamin Slade, the foreman of the yard. Adams moved to Hampshire in 1744 and was appointed naval overseer for the building of the <i>Surprise</i> (24 guns) in James Wyatt and Major's yard at Buckler's Hard, near Beaulieu, Hampshire. The yard was then in difficult times and, following the departure of three successive builders, Adams took it over in March 1748, with support from the duke of Montagu. In 1747 Adams had married Elizabeth Smith (<i>d</i>. 1759) of Beaulieu; they had two children, who died in childhood.<br>
<br>Adams's first ship, the <i>Mermaid</i> (24 guns), was launched in 1749, a year after the end of the War of the Austrian Succession. Naval work dried up, and Adams built some herring busses for the British Fisheries Society; however, in 1754, upon the threat of another war with France, he signed a contract for another 24-gun ship, and this soon led to further orders for small warships. His work on the <i>Coventry</i> (28 guns) was criticized in 1756 and it was recommended that the naval overseer, Mr Snooks, should not be employed again. Nevertheless, Adams was awarded the contract for a frigate, the <i>Thames</i> (32 guns), in 1757. In 1760, a year after his first wife's death, Adams married Anne Warner (<i>c</i>.1738&#150;1827), daughter of the steward of the manor of Beaulieu; they had seven children.<br>
<br>Early in 1762 Adams signed the contract to build the <i>Europe</i> (64 guns), his first ship of the line. Because of doubts about the site at Buckler's Hard, the Navy Board insisted that it be built at Lepe, near the mouth of the Beaulieu River. In 1763 he entered a partnership with William Dudman and William Barnard, who ran a private shipyard at Deptford. Naval work came to an end after the peace in 1763 and the Buckler's Hard site was for several years used mainly as a timber yard. In 1771 Adams was contracted to build a 74-gun ship at Deptford, followed by three smaller ships at Buckler's Hard. By the end of the year the Navy Board had accepted that the site was suitable for larger ships after some improvements and Adams was contracted for the <i>Vigilant</i> (64 guns). Following the outbreak of the American War of Independence in 1775 Adams flourished as a naval contractor. Many frigates and smaller ships were built, but the most famous product of the yard was the <i>Agamemnon</i> (64 guns), begun in 1779 and launched in April 1781. At the end of that year Adams was contracted to build an even larger ship, the <i>Illustrious</i> (74 guns), which was not completed until 1789.<br>
<br>In 1792 Adams lost a lawsuit against his former partners in Deptford and his family were forced to depend on Buckler's Hard as their sole source of income. In 1793, at the age of eighty, he retired and left the running of the business to his sons Balthazar and Edward. Adams died at Buckler's Hard in 1805, and was buried in Beaulieu church on 3 November. The yard went bankrupt in 1811.<br>
<br>Adams was typical of dozens of private shipbuilders who worked for the Royal Navy in the age of sail. His name is remembered partly because the rural site at Buckler's Hard survived intact and was opened as a museum in 1963. His reputation is perhaps exaggerated because he built the <i>Agamemnon</i>, which was highly praised by Nelson when he commanded her, after five years on half pay, from 1793 to 1796. Yet Adams did not design the <i>Agamemnon</i>, but merely constructed her to a plan originally drawn by Sir Thomas Slade.<br>
