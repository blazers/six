<span class="headword">Binyon,  Basil</span>  (1885&#150;1977), <span class="occ">electrical engineer</span>, was born on 23 April 1885, at 5 Henley Road, Ipswich, Suffolk, the third of four children of Brightwen Binyon (1852&#150;1905) and his wife, Rachel Mary (1853&#150;1949), daughter of William Cudworth and his wife, Mary. His father, an architect and an accomplished painter in watercolours, had a number of important commissions, including the design of Ipswich corn exchange, Aldermaston Manor, and Sunderland town hall. Basil's childhood was spent between Ipswich and Yorkshire where he had a number of relatives. After education at Leighton Park School, Reading, from <i>c</i>.1898 to 1903, he went up to Trinity College, Cambridge, where he read natural sciences and obtained a good degree.<br>
<br>For his practical training Binyon went to the Cambridge Scientific Instrument Company where he was introduced to commercial engineering manufacture. In 1909 he worked with Marconi on the first transatlantic Morse code radio transmissions from Poldhu, Cornwall, to Newfoundland. He continued to work with Marconi until the First World War, when he joined the Royal Naval Air Service, then in its infancy. Working with Royal Flying Corps personnel at Cranwell, in Lincolnshire, he produced some of the first airborne radio equipment for Morse telegraphy. Later the equipment was improved to make radio telephony possible between aircraft in flight and a ground station. Binyon's work was recognized with his appointment as OBE. He married, on 20 September 1913, Gladys Elise Rosa (1885&#150;1960), daughter of John Howard Keep. They had three children, Roger Basil, who was killed in the Arnhem landing in 1944, Margaret Howard, and Hugh Douglas, who both survived them.<br>
<br>Binyon used his wartime experience to set up the Radio Communication Co. Ltd which developed into a worldwide long wave communications network in the 1920s and early 1930s. The company produced equipment and operators for many merchant and naval ships of the period. He also founded a company to make domestic radio sets and components under the trade mark Polar and his interest in this field led to his appointment in 1922 as one of the directors of the original British Broadcasting Company, the remaining directors under Lord Gainforth's chairmanship being representatives of other firms manufacturing home radio receivers. Binyon played his part in establishing the technical standards which, developed over the years, established the BBC's high reputation.<br>
<br>Binyon's strong position in the radio field led to his being appointed chairman of the Institution of Electrical Engineers' wireless section for 1925&#150;6. His chairman's address, presented to the institution in November 1925, was a comprehensive review of marine wireless equipment at the time. Towards the end of the 1920s a rationalization took place in the commercial radio industry, one of the results of which was that Binyon's Radio Communication Company merged with Marconi to form a strong international marine radio communication organization which supplied equipment and personnel to the merchant navies of several countries. Initially Binyon thought that this merger would mark the end of his association with the company he had built up, but he was invited to join the Marconi board and until 1935 he contributed actively to its work. In 1936 he accepted an invitation to become a director of the Buenos Aires Water Company, which position he held until 1938. This involved regular trips to supervise the company's operations on site.<br>
<br>During the Second World War Binyon had a distinguished career with the Royal Observer Corps, for which he devised ingenious predictors based upon alarm clock mechanisms. These played an important part in the air defences of London in 1940&#150;41 before radar was widely available. The south-eastern sector of the Royal Observer Corps, of which Binyon was commandant, was in the front line of these defences.<br>
<br>Throughout his adult life Binyon had a great interest in making things, and had a well-equipped workshop with a lathe in the basement of his house. There he made a number of ingenious devices for time-lapse photography which he used to produce accelerated motion cine films of clouds and of flowers opening, which were a novelty at the time. After the war he built working model steam locomotives with which he entertained his grandchildren and many others. His first wife died in 1960, and on 28 April 1962 Binyon married Violet Mary (1900&#150;1989), daughter of John Walter Hibbert.<br>
<br>In retirement he divided his time between his large house, Hawthornedene in Hayes, Kent, and his seaside home at Thatchways, West Wittering, Sussex, where he regularly played host to large parties of family and friends who enjoyed sea bathing and sailing at the nearby Itchenor sailing club. After his second marriage he moved from Hayes to 14 The Glen, Farnborough Park, Kent. Throughout his life Binyon was keen on winter sports and served a term as president of the Ski Club of Great Britain. Binyon died on 4 April 1977 at Farnborough Hospital, Kent, of heart failure. He was buried at Hayes parish church.<br>
