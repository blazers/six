<span class="headword">Holborne,  Antony</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1602?), <span class="occ">lutenist and composer</span>, may have been the man admitted in May 1562, possibly after attendance at Merchant Taylors' School, &#145;pensioner&#146; of Christ's College, Cambridge, and in November 1565 to the Inner Temple. On 14 June 1584 at St Margaret's, Westminster, he married Elizabeth Marten; they had three daughters, Anne, Honor, and Dorothy, and an unnamed son known only from a letter of his mother, written in 1606. The family lived in that parish from 1584 to 1585 and from 1594 to 1596, but possibly elsewhere in between. Holborne styled himself gentleman and servant to the queen and was described by Robert Dowland in 1610 as gentleman usher to Queen Elizabeth, but no such appointment is recorded. He was probably a gentleman usher &#145;extraordinary&#146;, receiving no wages (and thus with no entry in the privy chamber accounts) and with no specific duties, but enjoying the status of gentleman and the protection conferred by nominal membership of the royal household. This honorary position would enable him to perform musical services to the queen under the guise of occasional attendance at court. A close parallel would be the place of gentleman-extraordinary of the Chapel Royal.<br>
<br>Holborne's earliest surviving compositions seem to be &#145;The Countess of Pembrokes Funeralls&#146;, probably commemorating the deaths in 1586 of Mary Herbert's father, mother, and brother, Sir Philip Sidney, and &#145;The Countess of Ormond's Galliard&#146;, given as the tune for a song in Anthony Munday's <span class="italic">Banquet of Daintie Conceits</span> (1588). A letter of 1594 requests some of his lessons for the bandora and there are two such by &#145;AH&#146; in William Barley's <span class="italic">New Booke of Tabliture</span> (1596). Holborne's own first publication was <span class="italic">The Cittharn Schoole</span> (1597), containing graded pieces, some with separate bass parts, but without instructions. His brother William contributed &#145;sixe short Aers Neapolitan like to three voices&#146;. Holborne himself was the most prolific composer for these wire-strung instruments; many pieces appear, besides his works for lute and for string ensembles, in English and foreign manuscripts. He provided commendatory verses in English to Thomas Morley's <span class="italic">A Plaine and Easie Introduction</span> (1597), and in Latin to Giles Farnaby's <span class="italic">Canzonets</span> (1598). Holborne's <span class="italic">Pavans, galliards, almains and other short aiers both grave and light, in five parts, for viols, violins, or other[wise] musicall winde instruments</span> (1599) was the first English publication comparable with the continental collections, in several of which his music appears. Only two of his songs survive: &#145;O Lord whose grace&#146; in the &#145;Swarland&#146; manuscript, and &#145;My Heavy Sprite&#146; in Robert Dowland's <span class="italic">A Musicall Banquet</span> (1610).<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">The Cittharn Schoole</span> was dedicated to Thomas, Lord Burgh, who died in the year of publication (1597). In <span class="italic">Pavans, Galliards, Almains</span> Holborne addresses Sir Richard Champernowne &#145;from the experience of many years&#146;, suggesting patronage over a period, perhaps in Champernowne's household at Modbury, Devon. There may have been a connection between Holborne and the countess of Pembroke's literary circle; their intense interest in emblematic literature could explain some of his esoteric titles, which have, for example, biblical and Ovidian links.<br>
<br>Holborne is the only Elizabethan composer from whom there are several different versions of the same music, all apparently from his own pen. Certain pieces exist for solo lute, bandora, and cittern, as well as for five-part instrumental ensemble and for mixed consort (though the last may have been arranged by others). This may be no more than an accident of survival, but is in marked contrast to the works of most of his contemporaries. The key of a piece is often adjusted to suit the particular instrumental medium, but the tune and bass usually remain the same. Holborne excels in melodic and rhythmic invention, and he was clearly an accomplished player of the lute and other plucked instruments. His five-part ensemble collection is conceived as functional dance-music, with correct if unimaginative inner parts. There is little of the wayward part-writing of a Dowland nor the sustained interest of individual lines demanded by amateur string players.<br>
<br>In January 1599 Holborne was sent by the queen with letters to the states of the United Provinces. On 29 November 1602 Elizabeth Holborne wrote to Cecil of her husband's taking cold on his business, fearing that it would cost him his life and that she would be unable to give him a suitable burial. The letter is endorsed &#145;primo December 1602 Widow Olborne&#146;  (Cecil MS 96, fol. 86), suggesting Holborne had probably died in London in the interim. The burial is unrecorded, but in 1606 Elizabeth described herself as a widow.<br>
