<span class="headword">Bentley,  Charlotte Eliza</span>  (1915&#150;1996), <span class="occ">nurse and nursing activist</span>, was born on 15 December 1915 at 63 Portland Court, Great Portland Street, London, the daughter of John Richard Bentley, hosier, and Charlotte Emma Redard. After education at a Swiss convent school and secretarial training Bentley trained as a nurse at the Royal Free Hospital, London, from 1943 to 1946, and there became a student political activist at a time when nursing was considered a vocation above politics. As national chairman of the Student Nurses' Association she campaigned for probationer nurses studying for the state registration examinations to be recognized as students rather than as hospital employees. This did not endear her to the hospital authorities, for whom probationers were a valuable supply of cheap labour on the wards. In 1948 she was appointed sister-in-charge of a new outpatients' department at Lambeth General Hospital, a former London county council hospital, to which she brought the different standards and practices of the teaching hospitals.<br>
<br>Bentley's attention soon turned to raising the status of state-enrolled nurses, a grade of assistant nurses created by the 1943 <span class="roman">Nurses' Act</span>, who were widely regarded as inferior to their state-registered colleagues. In 1955 she was elected general secretary of the National Association of State Enrolled Assistant Nurses, despite the concern of some members that a state-registered nurse should be appointed to the post rather than an enrolled nurse. An appeal to members for funds ensured that her first year's salary was paid, but she accepted the challenge of making the association financially viable, as well as ceaselessly campaigning on behalf of her members. While often finding it necessary to adopt a confrontational approach to those hospitals and matrons whom she considered unjust to enrolled nurses she also attempted to build bridges between senior figures in the nursing hierarchy, nurse educators, and state-registered and state-enrolled nurses at all levels. For many years she organized &#145;all-grade&#146; tours for nurses to the Netherlands, Spain, and Switzerland, during which social contact could help to break down professional barriers. On such social occasions she was considered an erudite companion whose learning was tempered by a keen sense of humour.<br>
<br>Bentley enlisted the support of Dame Irene Ward, MP for Tynemouth, to sponsor successfully a private member's bill in 1961 to remove from the title of state-enrolled nurses the word &#145;assistant&#146;, which she considered demeaning and derogatory. National conferences of enrolled nurses were organized to raise their professional profile. She also argued that enrolled nurses should be allowed to manage hospital wards. With sponsorship from the <span class="italic">Nursing Mirror</span> she established a scholarship for enrolled nurses to encourage practical nursing skills. She herself was appointed MBE for her services to nursing.<br>
<br>In 1970 the National Association of State Enrolled Nurses was absorbed by the Royal College of Nursing, despite the prejudice previously shown by the college towards enrolled nurses. Bentley became an official of the college, still dominated by an ethos that saw the nursing profession as a vocation and enrolled nurses as belonging to an inferior grade. Although herself a state-registered nurse Bentley continued to champion enrolled nurses in her new role as section secretary of the enrolled nurses' section of the Royal College of Nursing. Her outspoken, sceptical, strongly held views were not always popular with her colleagues at the college; an avowed agnostic, she alienated many by her principled refusal to attend college religious services, just as previously she had refused to attend church services held at the annual conferences of the National Association of State Enrolled Nurses. On retiring from the Royal College of Nursing in 1977 she became secretary of the nursing sub-committee of the Edwina Mountbatten Trust, charged with administering project grants to advance nursing, midwifery, and health-visiting in the United Kingdom and the Commonwealth.<br>
<br>Though a campaigner for the rights of enrolled nurses Bentley was keen to preserve the distinction between state-registered and state-enrolled nurses, as she believed that there was a place for the more practical, skills-oriented nurse alongside the more academically trained nurse. While welcoming the setting up in 1983 of one register for all nurses under the aegis of the United Kingdom Central Council for Nursing, Midwifery and Health Visiting she did not support the later cessation of enrolment of pupil nurses for the enrolled sections of the register, nor the encouragement given to enrolled nurses to convert to registered general nurses. Nevertheless she had done much toward breaking down the barriers within the nursing profession that ultimately tended towards the extinction of the enrolled nurse.<br>
<br>In retirement Bentley suffered from Parkinson's disease. She remained unmarried, and died of old age on 20 March 1996 at 37 Elsworthy Road, Camden, London. Her body was cremated.<br>
