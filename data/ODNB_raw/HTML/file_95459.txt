<span class="headword">Davies, Sir  (Robert) Rees</span>  (1938&#150;2005), <span class="occ">historian</span>, was born on 6 August 1938 at Glanddwynant, Llanfor, near Llandderfel, a village in the upper Dee valley, Merioneth, the youngest of four sons of (William) Edward Davies (1904&#150;1967), tenant farmer, and his wife, Sarah Margaret (Maggie), <i>n&eacute;e</i> Williams (1906&#150;1984). His parents shortly afterwards moved a few miles eastwards and upwards, to the hill farm of Blaengwnodl Uchaf, where Rees (as he always wished to be known) was brought up. The family home, with its superb vista of the Berwyn range on the opposite side of the valley, and its region, the historic commote of Edeyrnion, left a profound and lifelong impression on him. It was the country of Owain Glyn D&#373;r, still at that time almost wholly Welsh in speech, ever in creative tension with the English influences from just across the mountains or downstream. Questions of identity and borderlands became central to his interests as a historian.<br>
<br>Davies attended school at the village of Cynwyd, then as a weekly boarder at the boys' grammar school in Bala. There he proved a brilliant pupil, and also learned the English that he subsequently employed with such elegance and precision. In 1956 he went to University College, London, where he studied history with Geoffrey Barrow, Alfred Cobban, and May MacKisack. Anxious for a pupil described as &#145;the ablest undergraduate we've had in the department since the war&#146;, they were advised that it would be a &#145;great mistake for a medieval historian, even if Welsh, to <i>start</i> his postgraduate work by tackling Welsh history&#146;  (Morgan and Davidson, 6). Wisely Davies opted for a halfway house: study of the lords of the Anglo-Welsh marches. This would in many ways determine his life's work. For the present&#151;the year was 1959&#151;it took him to Merton College, Oxford, as a student of the redoubtable K. B. McFarlane at Magdalen.<br>
<br>After one or two monosyllabic initial encounters McFarlane clearly hit it off with Davies, who later recalled McFarlane's friendship as &#145;utterly direct and totally equal&#146;, his &#145;intellectual honesty and integrity&#146; as sometimes &#145;terrifying&#146;. McFarlane appreciated &#145;some Welsh sharpness&#146; in his pupil, &#145;not wholly blunted by good nature&#146;. The fruit of their collaboration was Davies's DPhil dissertation of 1965 on the Lancaster marcher lordships in the fourteenth century, carefully matured, for, as McFarlane observed, &#145;he can't bear a slovenly sentence, a misplaced comma, or a reckless generalisation&#146;  (McFarlane, 210&#150;13, 215&#150;17, 226&#150;7, 251&#150;2). Another reason for delay was Davies's burgeoning academic career in both his countries. Appointed as an assistant Welsh-medium lecturer at Swansea in 1961, he was then recalled to University College as a lecturer two years later.<br>
<br>In London Davies had joined Welsh circles, just as he later took an active role in the Cymdeithas Dafydd ap Gwilym at Oxford. Through the Welsh Presbyterian Church he met Carys Lloyd Wynne, and they married at Zion Chapel, Wrexham, on 29 July 1966. A schoolteacher, aged twenty-eight at the time of her marriage, Carys was the daughter of Ifor Lloyd Wynne, bank manager. They had one son and one daughter. Meanwhile the subject-matter of Davies's thesis broadened into a stream of highly suggestive articles over a further decade, before being reconfigured as his first book, <span class="italic">Lordship and Society in the March of Wales, 1278&#150;1400</span> (1978). Critical acclaim was immediate for this momentous <i>th&egrave;se</i>, which interwove political, administrative, legal, and social approaches. Opening up a vast, rich, and intricate world, the work nevertheless rested on a single basic juxtaposition, within and between the myriad petty jurisdictions it examines: that of native Welsh and immigrant English.<br>
<br>Two years before the book's publication Davies had taken a chair at the University College of Wales, Aberystwyth, partly from his and Carys's desire for their children to grow up in a Welsh-language environment. At Aberystwyth he was the prime mover in a complete redesigning of the history syllabus, and served between 1988 and 1991 as vice-principal. He assumed a far wider pedagogical brief too when in 1989&#150;91 he chaired the National Curriculum History Committee for Wales. This body achieved truly pioneering work, and laid out for the first time a vision (and a fully bilingual one) for the study of history in Wales. In the meantime Davies had delivered, for a new and authoritative <span class="roman">History of Wales</span> series published by Oxford University Press, one of the finest treatments of any period in the country's past. His <span class="italic">Conquest, Co-Existence and Change: Wales, 1063&#150;1415</span> (1987), brilliantly conceived and pellucidly executed, won him the Wolfson prize and constituted a high point in the renaissance of Welsh historiography that coincided so exactly with his career. Davies, however, having become a historian of his homeland largely in England, was now in the process of retooling himself as a British historian while in Wales. His Wiles lectures of 1988 at the Queen's University of Belfast, which were published as <span class="italic">Domination and Conquest: the Experience of Ireland, Scotland and Wales</span> (1990), disclosed a whole new research territory. It was a logical consequence of this trajectory for him to be appointed to the Chichele chair of medieval history at Oxford in 1995.<br>
<br>Davies's move back to Oxford followed a hard decision. He was always quizzical about Oxford, and felt something of an outsider. Yet he brought an immensely fertile blend of shrewdness, dedication, and imaginative creativity to his university duties. As a devoted supervisor or mentor to nearly a hundred graduate students at any one time he turned doctoral research on medieval topics into a more coherent academic enterprise, with an enhanced <i>esprit de corps</i>. At the same time, though setting no store by such things in themselves, he initiated major and overdue reforms in the structure and conduct of faculty business. Above all he supplied intellectual leadership, beginning with a memorable inaugural, which told a disturbingly Oxford-centred story of the replacement of the British heritage by the &#145;Matter of England&#146;, as the main strand in the grand historiographical narrative of the British Isles, first in the twelfth century, then confirmed with full professional gravitas in the later nineteenth, by the likes of Stubbs and Freeman. The theme was soon elaborated in his Ford lectures at Oxford, published as <span class="italic">The First English Empire</span> (2000). These analysed an Anglicization of the British Isles, from 1093 to 1343, and of course beyond, which confirmed the exclusion, and the passive or active resistance, of the &#145;Celtic&#146; lands. He described a deep divide within Britain, with &#145;two political culture zones&#146;, and a border between (as they came to be perceived from the centre) &#145;sweet civility&#146; and &#145;barbaric rudeness&#146;  (<span class="italic">First English Empire</span>, 110 ff).<br>
<br>The Anglo-Welsh border was the frontier that Davies had known since his youth in Edeyrnion, though he and Carys could also build on long-standing Welsh traditions at Oxford, within the university and beyond. The chronicler of the identity of others had by now constructed his own, which straddled that notional border he wrote of. This was reflected in the multiplying accolades and commitments of his latter years. He became a fellow of the British Academy in 1987&#151;and typically knuckled down to some very hard work for it. Alongside a CBE in 1995 and a fistful of honorary fellowships and degrees in both countries, he was awarded the Medlicott medal for his services to the Historical Association in 1994, even as he presided over its sister organization in London, the Royal Historical Society (1992&#150;6). On the Welsh side of the fence his longest involvement was with the Ancient Monuments Board for Wales, of which he had been the youngest member ever in 1977, and became chairman in 1995. In the Honourable Society of Cymmrodorion too, the oldest and broadest-based of Welsh learned societies, Davies played a leading role, being elected president in 2002.<br>
<br>During this time political debates about Welsh nationhood, within or beyond Britishness, were intensifying. Davies had long experienced a <i>crise de conscience</i> before he articulated it in historical terms through his most deeply felt and popular work, <span class="italic">The Revolt of Owain Glyn D&#373;r</span>, in 1995. This was, above all, a gripping and definitive narrative of the independence struggle of late medieval Wales. The phenomenon of Glyn D&#373;r helped inspire Davies to his maturest reflections on the identity of nations in general and of the Welsh in particular. In an eisteddfod talk in 1998 he spoke from the heart about the British dimension of his Welshness and vice versa: how England's unique achievement of a &#145;1000-year Reich&#146; had undermined the pristine equilibria of the &#145;Matter of Britain&#146;. Now in its decline there was a need to rebuild the crumbling edifice of Britishness, as the best carapace for the survival of Welsh culture too. For all his emphasis on identity, mythology, and other cultural markers Davies always saw material authority as very real, enduring, and irreducible. Thence his feeling for those looser-limbed traditions of marcher lordship, with which he began his career, and to which he returned, in the widest European context of <i>seigneurie</i> and <i>Herrschaft</i>, in some of his last, uncompleted work.<br>
<br>Rees Davies was a deeply unassuming man, dutiful, utterly professional, who bore huge burdens with never a complaint, and whose daunting organizational skills were always deployed to achieve results through a gentle, even diffident, but infinitely patient manner, through painstaking and selfless application, and through a radiant generosity of spirit. He was a brilliant teacher; a colleague whose sometimes slightly reserved exterior soon dissolved into quick wit and good humour; a correspondent whose letters and memoranda, in what has been called a &#145;hand as meticulous as that of a medieval Chancery scribe&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Independent</span>, 23 May 2005), apparently never needed correction; a walker and lover of the natural world, with the eye of a countryman (though more of an urban turn of speed) and a sharp sense of place and landscape; an active devotee of music and literature; above all a man of firm, humble, quiet spirituality, and of unswerving devotion to his family and friends. He was knighted in the new year's honours of 2005, by which time he was suffering from cancer. He died at his home, 9 Dale Close, Oxford, on 16 May 2005, and was survived by his wife, Carys, and their two children.<br>
