<span class="headword">Leyland,  Frederick Richards</span>  (1831&#150;1892), <span class="occ">shipowner and art patron</span>, was born on 30 September 1831 in Liverpool, the first of the three sons of John Leyland, a bookkeeper, and his wife, Ann Jane Leyland (<i>d</i>. 1877), both of Liverpool. Although Ann Leyland is reputed to have sold pies in the city streets after her husband died or deserted the family in the late 1830s, a contemporary records that she worked in a respectable eating-house near the offices of John Bibby &amp; Sons, Liverpool's oldest independent shipping line. In 1844 she persuaded Bibby to apprentice her eldest son, educated at the mechanics' institute. Frederick Leyland's intellectual gifts and managerial talent quickly became apparent, and he is said to have been instrumental in Bibby's introduction of steamships into the Mediterranean trade in 1850. As the Bibby Line prospered, Leyland rose through the ranks from bookkeeper to clerk to merchant by 1859, and in 1861 he settled a dispute between Bibby and the Birkenhead corporation with such success that he was made a partner in the firm. When at the end of 1872 the partnership dissolved, he bought out his employers and changed the company name to his own. Under his direction the Leyland Line expanded into transatlantic trade and by 1882 comprised some twenty-five steamships. He retired from active business in 1888, leaving his son Frederick Dawson Leyland in charge of the shipping line.<br>
<br>On 23 March 1855 Leyland had married Frances, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Dawson (1836&#150;1910), daughter of a master mariner, and by 1861 the Leylands were living with their four children in Falkner Square in Liverpool. His wealth and position were then on the rise, and in 1867 he leased a historic, half-timbered Tudor house, Speke Hall, 7 miles outside the city, where the family resided until 1877, when they moved to another mansion in the vicinity, Woolton Hall. With the advice of his closest friend, the artist Dante Gabriel Rossetti, whom he met through the Liverpool collector John Miller in 1866, Leyland restored much of Speke Hall and embellished it with the art which he had begun acquiring in the early 1860s. More of the paintings were installed at 23 Queen's Gate, Leyland's London home during his most active period of art collecting&#151;from 1868 to 1875&#151;and then, from 1876 until his death, at 49 Prince's Gate, a house remodelled to realize Leyland's &#145;dream of living the life of an old Venetian merchant in modern London&#146;  (Child, 82).<br>
<br>As a modern-day Medici, Leyland purchased Italian Renaissance paintings, including a Botticelli series illustrating Boccaccio's tale of Nastagio degli Onesti and mentioned in Vasari (now in the Camb&oacute; collection, Barcelona, and an Italian priv. coll.). He also became the leading patron of several living artists, primarily Rossetti, Edward Burne-Jones, and James McNeill Whistler. Whistler was commissioned to decorate the entrance hall at Prince's Gate, which featured a famous balustrade salvaged from Northumberland House. That project led to his redecoration of the adjacent dining room, which he gradually transformed into &#145;The Peacock Room&#146;, formally <span class="italic">Harmony in Blue and Gold</span> (1876&#150;7, now in the Freer Gallery of Art, Washington, DC). The artist and his patron quarrelled over the price of the project, and Whistler immortalized the altercation in a mural of two peacocks poised for battle. He subsequently declared that Leyland would be remembered only as the owner of the work whose price he had refused to pay, and outside the annals of British shipping the prophecy mostly held true. Recent scholarship, however, has recognized Leyland's importance as a patron and supporter of the Victorian avant-garde.<br>
<br>In portraits by Whistler (Freer Gallery of Art) and Rossetti (Delaware Art Museum), Leyland appears aristocratic in demeanour and dressed like a dandy in ruffled shirts, which gradually became his attribute; he figures in Theodore Watts-Dunton's 1898 novel <span class="italic">Aylwin</span> as Symonds, &#145;an elegant-looking man in a peculiar kind of evening dress&#146;  (p. 230). Brooding and aloof, Leyland took solace in music, faithfully practising on his piano but never mastering the instrument to his satisfaction. According to contemporaries he was &#145;hated thoroughly by a very large circle of acquaintance&#146;  (White, 152), and his &#145;immorality and doings with women&#146; are said to have been widely acknowledged  (Stripe, 82). He and his wife officially separated in 1879, possibly because of Leyland's liaison with Rosa Laura Caldecott, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Gately (<i>d</i>. 1890), whom he had established in 1875 at Denham Lodge, Hammersmith, and who bore a son named Frederick Richards Leyland Caldecott in 1883. At about that time Leyland acquired Villette, near Broadstairs, Kent, a house he shared with Annie Ellen Wooster and her children, Fred Richards and Francis George Leyland Wooster, born in 1884 and 1890; they are noted in Leyland's will as his &#145;reputed sons&#146;.<br>
<br>In his retirement Leyland was named president of the National Telephone Company (1889) and became deputy chairman of Edison &amp; Sons United Electric Light Company. He died suddenly, from a heart attack, on 4 January 1892, while on a London underground train between Mansion House and Blackfriars stations. Leyland's estate was assessed at &pound;732,770, from which his legitimate children each received substantial legacies. His will also made ample provision for Miss Wooster and her two children; to raise capital for these bequests, the art and furnishings of Prince's Gate were auctioned at Christie, Manson, and Woods on 26&#150;27 May 1892, realizing &pound;36,257; the house itself was sold in 1894. Leyland was buried on 8 January 1892 in Brompton cemetery, where his grave is marked by an impressive bronze monument designed by Edward Burne-Jones.<br>
