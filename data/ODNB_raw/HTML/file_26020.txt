<span class="headword">Somerville,  Hugh</span>, fourth Lord Somerville  (<em>c.</em>1484&#150;1549), <span class="occ">nobleman</span>, was the second son of William, master of Somerville, and his second wife, Janet Douglas of Drumlanrig. His father died in 1491, a few months before his grandfather John, second Lord Somerville, who died in November. His elder brother, also John, thus succeeded, but died childless in 1522, and so Hugh took his seat in parliament as the fourth lord on 16 November 1524. He married twice. His first wife, Anna, an illegitimate daughter of James Hamilton, first earl of Arran, whom he married on 20 December 1510, died of smallpox with their two young sons in 1516. In July 1517 he married Janet, daughter of William Maitland of Lethington, with whom he had six sons and three daughters. <br>
<br>A major landowner in Lanarkshire, Somerville was often entangled in territorial disputes. In August 1525 his cousin John Somerville of Cambusnethan sought to usurp the lands of Carnwath, at the centre of Hugh's inheritance. Cambusnethan had the support of the sixth earl of Angus, the effective head of the government, and eventually Lord Somerville had to give way. Instead he took up residence in Cowthally, an ancient family strength, which he largely rebuilt. On 4 September 1526 he was involved in the fight at Linlithgow in which the twelfth earl of Lennox was killed, following an unsuccessful attempt to remove the young James V from Augus's custody. That in 1531 Somerville was declared innocent of any complicity in Lennox's death, faring better than others who had to pay substantial fines, was probably owing to royal favour. In 1528 he had supported James V at Stirling when the king finally broke free of Angus's control, and he subsequently became something of an intimate with James, who in 1532 resolved his dispute with Cambusnethan. <br>
<br>Somerville frequently entertained James V at Cowthally, where in July 1532 the king attended the marriage of Hugh's daughter Agnes. Royal friendship brought few visible rewards, but some sort of warmth clearly existed: Somerville was on Leith docks when the king returned from France with his first wife, Madeleine, on 19 May 1537, having spent lavishly to bedeck himself and his retainers in new liveries for the occasion: according to family tradition it was to pay for this that he sold rents worth &pound;60 from Carnwath to St Mary Magdalene hospital, Edinburgh, and indeed two charters from 1540 record just such a sale. In 1540 he served the king by sitting on the assize which condemned Hamilton of Finnart for treason; he may also have served his own interests, since Finnart's accumulation of estates was making him a potential rival in Lanarkshire. On 30 December 1540 James granted Somerville the bailiary of the lands and barony of Carstairs, forfeited by Finnart. Somerville was not just a courtier, however, for he fought in James V's army at Solway Moss on 24 November 1542 and was among the many Scottish nobles captured by the English. Taken to London considerably more slowly than his fellows (he did not arrive until about 19 December), there he became one of the Assured Scots, pledged to press for the marriage of the infant Mary, queen of Scots, to Henry VIII's son, Prince Edward, and to promote the English cause in Scotland. His ransom, assessed on lands valued at &pound;800 and goods worth &pound;1000 Scots, was accordingly reduced and he was promised a pension. But like his fellows he had to hand over his eldest son as a hostage. <br>
<br>Back in Scotland early in 1543, Somerville participated in that year's confused manoeuvring, as an opponent of Cardinal David Beaton and his policy of alliance with France. Instead he collaborated with the earl of Angus, at this time pro-English, and even went to Douglas on 8 September to subscribe a band contracting to support the English marriage. Assigned with the fifth Lord Maxwell to represent the views of his associates to Henry VIII, he ill-advisedly went via Edinburgh, where he was arrested on 1 November, to be briefly imprisoned there before being taken to Blackness Castle on the 6th. Although his dispatches were used by Beaton as evidence for the treason of his enemies, the services implicit in Somerville's captivity secured the release from England of his eldest son. He was himself freed from Blackness by 2 April 1544. <br>
<br>Somerville's political position remained ambivalent for the rest of his life. He was present in the Scottish army at Coldingham in December 1544 and at Ancrum Moor on 27 February 1545, while on 10 June 1546 he attended the convention at Stirling which made provision for the government of Scotland after the murder of Beaton. But on 21 March 1549 he was once more presenting himself as a supporter of England and an enemy of the governor, the second earl of Arran. His stance at this point may have been influenced by his protestantism in religion, or may have resulted from one of his son's being an English prisoner. Somerville died later that year, sometime before 11 November, and was buried at Carnwath. His wife, who died sometime after 19 August 1559, was interred beside him. <br>
<br>The fourth lord's eldest son from his second marriage, <a name="cosubject_26020"></a><span class="headword">James Somerville</span>  (<em>c.</em>1519&#150;1569)<span class="occ"></span>, succeeded as fifth Lord Somerville, having sasine of Carnwath by 19 February 1550. Like his father he married twice. His first wife, Jean Hamilton, whom he had married by 26 March 1529, was another illegitimate daughter of the first earl of Arran. They had no children, and the marriage may have been ended by divorce. Then, some time after 8 April 1536, James married Agnes, daughter of Sir James Hamilton of Finnart, with whom he had two sons and two daughters; he probably also had an illegitimate son. In the late 1550s the fifth lord, like his father in the previous decade, seems to have favoured a Scottish alliance with England, but unlike his father he remained a Catholic. In 1560 he signed the treaty of Berwick of 22 February and the Leith bond of 27 April, and he supported proposals that Queen Elizabeth should marry the earl of Arran, but according to Knox he was one of three peers who voted against the reformed confession of faith in August, declaring &#145;We will believe as our fathers believed&#146;  (<span class="italic">History of the Reformation</span>, 1.339). Later he was a firm supporter of Mary, queen of Scots, whom he entertained at Cowthally from 24 to 26 August 1563. He took part in the suppression of the chaseabout raid in 1565, and fought for Mary at Langside on 13 May 1568, when he was wounded. He died at Cowthally in December 1569 and was buried at Carnwath, as was his wife, who was still alive in August 1597. His heir was his elder son, Hugh.<br>
