<span class="headword">West,  William</span>  (1770&#150;1854), <span class="occ">bookseller and antiquary</span>, was born on 23 October 1770 at Whaddon, Surrey, into a family of eleven children. While the identity of his parents remains unknown, it is understood that his father's side of the family had a long heritage of agricultural pursuits with West's great-grandfather owning an estate near Stonehenge before moving to a property in Surrey. To this rural background West, by his own admission, attributed his limited education and as a young boy was undecided in his pursuit of a trade.<br>
<br>According to West it was the death of Samuel Johnson in 1784 which inspired him to move to London and pursue a career in the world of literature and bookselling. In December that year he travelled to London on foot in the company of his elder brother, determined to be bound as an apprentice stationer. In the following January West repeated the journey and found employment with the bookseller Thomas Evans, to whom West's brother had been apprenticed since 1778. Within months he was apprenticed at Stationers' Hall to Robert Colley before being turned over to Evans.<br>
<br>As a young apprentice West was shy and timid but exhibited a thirst for literature and a passion for the bookselling trade, such that in 1788 he was appointed manager of Evans's business. By this time, before the end of his apprenticeship, and unknown to his master and parents, West had settled on marriage, which produced two daughters and one son named Samuel West. For three years following the completion of his apprenticeship West continued to work for Evans's son James, until the latter was declared bankrupt and fled to America in 1795. West then went into business for himself and in 1800 was joined as partner by Thomas Hughes. On 3 October 1801 both were declared bankrupt, but by 1808 West had re-established himself as a bookseller in Cork, where he published <span class="italic">A Picturesque Description of Cork and its Environs</span> (1808). Although the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> states that West spent some thirty years residing in Ireland, the dates of his sojourn remain unknown and, given the known chronology of his career, it seems unlikely that he spent so long out of England. It is known that West remained in Cork until 1830, during which time he wrote the anonymous <span class="italic">Tavern anecdotes and reminiscences of the origin of signs, clubs, coffee houses, streets, city companies, wards &hellip; by one of the old school</span> (1825) and the disjointed biographical miscellany <span class="italic">Fifty Years' Recollections of an Old Bookseller</span> (1830).<br>
<br>In 1830 West moved to Birmingham, there composing two topographical works including his significant <span class="italic">The History, Topography and Directory of Warwickshire</span> (1830). He wrote two further books, one published in Cork in 1835 and the other published in Leeds in 1839, before taking control as editor of the <span class="italic">Aldine Magazine of Biography, Bibliography, Criticism and the Arts</span>, which was published in London between December 1838 and June 1839. The <span class="italic">Aldine Magazine</span>'s &#145;great object&#146; was &#145;to be <i>useful</i> and <i>instructive</i> as well as <i>amusing</i>&#146;, and such was their belief in the superiority of their product, that the editors challenged &#145;comparison with the similar articles of any other Miscellany&#146;  (preface, <span class="italic">Aldine Magazine</span>, collected volume, 1839). The magazine contained not only poetry, reviews, and announcements of new books and upcoming events but, perhaps most importantly for book historians, the series &#145;Letters to my son at Rome&#146;. Written by West, these informal pieces recount &#145;the experiences and vicissitudes of the &#147;Old Bookseller's&#148; life and acquaintances&#146;  (<span class="italic">Aldine Magazine</span>, 1/1, 1 Dec 1838, 1). They cover such topics as &#145;Notice of the Rivington family&#146;, &#145;Liberality and illiberality of booksellers&#146;, &#145;Account of the firm of Messrs. Longman and Co.&#146;, and &#145;Pros and cons between authors and booksellers&#146;.<br>
<br>It is likely that West by this time was again living in London; although he did not return to bookselling, he appears to have secured a living as a bookseller's assistant or in a literary occupation. His last years were spent as a pensioner at the Charterhouse, where he died on 17 November 1854 from a condition that caused paralysis. It is not known where he was buried.<br>
