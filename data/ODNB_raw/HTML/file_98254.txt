<span class="headword">D'Ivernois, Sir  Francis</span>  (1757&#150;1842), <span class="occ">political exile and politician in Geneva</span>, was born Fran&ccedil;ois d'Ivernois at Geneva on 9 April 1757, the fifth of eight children of Fran&ccedil;ois-Henri d'Ivernois (1722&#150;1778), merchant, and his wife, Marianne Dehors (1727&#150;1796). During the 1760s his father became a leading figure in the <i>repr&eacute;sentant</i> movement which, fearing the political consequences of an increasingly dominant oligarchy, sought to reform the city-state's constitutional and penal laws. Fran&ccedil;ois studied law at the Coll&egrave;ge de Gen&egrave;ve until 1777 and became an advocate in 1781. On his father's death he established, with Pierre Boin and Jean-Fran&ccedil;ois Bassompierre, a publishing firm in Geneva to produce a complete edition of Rousseau's writings. This venture resulted in the &#145;Geneva&#146; edition, though the project was dogged by pirate editions and was liquidated in 1784. By the time the first books appeared in 1779 d'Ivernois's attention had turned to politics.<br>
<br>Despite his youth d'Ivernois became a prominent <i>repr&eacute;sentant</i> in a movement now led by his friends Jacques-Antoine Duroveray and &Eacute;tienne Clavi&egrave;re. The <i>repr&eacute;sentants</i> believed that France increasingly treated Geneva as a protectorate, and that the city's magistrates had become agents of French government policy. In 1779 d'Ivernois began writing on behalf of the <i>repr&eacute;sentants</i> and his <span class="italic">Tableau historique et politique des r&eacute;volutions de Gen&egrave;ve dans le dix-huiti&egrave;me si&egrave;cle</span> (1782) was dedicated to Louis XVI in the hope of altering French policy towards the <i>repr&eacute;sentant</i> cause. D'Ivernois also served as a leader of the successful armed rising against the magistrates in February 1782. However, when Bernese, Sardinian, and French troops put down the uprising in July, d'Ivernois fled the city with twenty-one others and was permanently exiled following the magistrates' return.<br>
<br>With his fellow exiles d'Ivernois went first to the Prussian protectorate of Neuch&acirc;tel. During missions to Turin in 1782 he established good relations with the British envoy to Sardinia, Lord Mountstuart. Though Britain had remained neutral during the uprising, d'Ivernois was persuaded to lead the exiles in establishing a manufacturing settlement&#151;to be known as New Geneva&#151;at Waterford in Ireland. While resident in Dublin d'Ivernois petitioned Lord Abingdon for assistance in June 1782 and in September drafted plans for a settlement at an estimated cost of &pound;50,000. The proposal was supported by the prime minister, Lord Shelburne, and prominent politicians including the new lord lieutenant, the third Earl Temple, who were both interested in the country's commercial development, especially by foreign protestants. D'Ivernois's proposal gained royal approval in April 1783 and was accepted by the Irish privy council, land being provided near Passage East by William Fitzgerald, second duke of Leinster, and Henry Loftus, first earl of Ely. Although the New Geneva project failed after two years, d'Ivernois became a British subject in 1783, taking the oath in Dublin before moving to London.<br>
<br>D'Ivernois now began an association with the French <i>parlementaire</i> the comte de Mirabeau, who came to London in 1784. He introduced Mirabeau to the politician and legal reformer Samuel Romilly who undertook the translation of Mirabeau's <span class="italic">Consid&eacute;rations sur l'ordre de Cincinnatus</span>. D'Ivernois also attempted, unsuccessfully, to establish a periodical critical of French foreign policy, and between 1784 and 1786 was tutor to the son of the politician Sir Sampson Gideon, baronet, with whom he undertook a grand tour. On his return to London in 1786 D'Ivernois frequented the house of David Chauvet, another Genevan exiled from the city in 1782. Chauvet's residence in Kensington Square was a centre for expatriate Genevans and there D'Ivernois became further involved with the Genevan political writer &Eacute;tienne Dumont, and through him re-encountered Lord Shelburne, to whose son Dumont was tutor. It was either through Shelburne or Charles Stanhope, Lord Mahon&#151;who had lived in Geneva during the 1760s and 1770&#151;that D'Ivernois was granted an annual pension of &pound;300 in August 1789.<br>
<br>During the late 1780s D'Ivernois continued his work as a tutor and, with Sir George Wombwell, baronet, undertook a second grand tour, from which he returned to London in February 1790. Twelve months earlier D'Ivernois's perpetual exile had been ended after a second rising in the city state and he returned to Geneva later in 1790. In September he was elected to the council of two hundred (<i>conseil des deux cents</i>) but, as demands for political equality grew, D'Ivernois and his anti-democratic stance fell out of favour and on 5 September 1794 he was condemned to death during Geneva's terror.<br>
<br>By this date D'Ivernois had returned to London. After the failure of his proposal to move the academy of Geneva to the United States&#151;to prevent its destruction during Europe's revolutionary wars&#151;he established himself as a writer and diplomatic agent for the British cause against revolutionary France, becoming directly involved with the prime minister, William Pitt, through his intermediary William Wickham. D'Ivernois was constant in supporting the British policy of war with France and was condemned in the French national convention as one of Pitt's leading agents. Like his fellow Genevans Duroveray and Dumont, D'Ivernois was in these years a member of the Bowood circle of English intellectuals and political reformers, who gathered around Lord Shelburne (now marquess of Lansdowne). Other members of the circle included Romilly, Joseph Priestley, Richard Price, and Jeremy Bentham, who encouraged the translation of D'Ivernois's <span class="italic">La r&eacute;volution fran&ccedil;oise &agrave; Gen&egrave;ve</span> (published in London in 1794) as a potentially instructive guide for British government ministers. In a letter to Lord St Helens, ambassador to The Hague, Bentham recommended D'Ivernois's study (which was translated into English in 1795) and spoke of its author as a &#145;man of good character&#146;  (5 Dec 1794, Bentham, <span class="italic">Correspondence</span>, 5.107&#150;8). Bentham's letters also reveal D'Ivernois's closeness to Viscount Sydney, Pitt's former secretary at the Home department, the pair being &#145;sometime for days together&#146;  (23 Sept 1795, ibid. 5.153). In such later works as his <span class="italic">Histoire de l'administration des finances de la r&eacute;publique fran&ccedil;aise pendant l'ann&eacute;e 1796</span> (1797) D'Ivernois sought to reveal the weakness of French finances and the comparative strength of the British fiscal system. He was knighted on 11 May 1796 for such services and on 7 October 1800 received an additional government pension of &pound;200 per annum&#151;backdated to July 1799&#151;in recognition of his defence of Pitt's policies and his promotion of anti-French propaganda. He also continued to condemn both the excess of liberty in Geneva and the conduct of France towards the republic, particularly after the annexation of 1798.<br>
<br>During the Napoleonic wars D'Ivernois continued his work on behalf of the British government, establishing himself as an indefatigable opponent of the imperial French economic, political, and civil systems. During this time he was resident at 11 Thayer Street, Manchester Square, London, from where he maintained a correspondence with Bentham. He served as an envoy in the British service to Sweden and to the Swiss and German states, and undertook a mission to Russia in 1813 to develop Anglo-Russian relations. D'Ivernois was heavily involved in maintaining the alliance between Britain, Russia, and Prussia in 1814. In December 1813 Austrian troops had liberated Geneva; with the republic's independence restored, D'Ivernois returned to his native city with Caroline Ren&eacute;e Fr&eacute;d&eacute;rique Louise (1780&#150;1841), the daughter of Major-General Pierre-Rodolphe Bontems. D'Ivernois and Caroline Bontems were married in Geneva on 24 September 1814.<br>
<br>D'Ivernois was one of two Genevan deputies at the Congress of Vienna. He was instrumental in establishing Geneva as a Swiss canton and in framing a new constitution to prevent the democratic upheavals that he considered had previously marred Genevan political life. In April 1814 he wrote to the foreign secretary, Viscount Castlereagh, to thank him for the actions of the British state in defeating French imperial designs over the previous twenty years. He also proposed the establishment of a chair of English literature at the University of Geneva, regarding the spread of the English language as vital for Europe's future stability. D'Ivernois served in the assembly until 1824 and clashed with his old friend &Eacute;tienne Dumont, who favoured greater popular representation. During his retirement he became fascinated by the views of Robert Malthus, and defended them in several publications against the Genevan political economist Jean Charles L&eacute;onard Simonde de Sismondi. D'Ivernois died at Geneva on 16 March 1842 and was buried there.<br>
