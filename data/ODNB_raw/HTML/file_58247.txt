<span class="headword">Holt,  Alfred</span>  (1829&#150;1911), <span class="occ">engineer and shipowner</span>, was born on 13 June 1829 at 2 Rake Lane, Liverpool, third of the six children of George Holt (1790&#150;1861), cotton broker, and Emma, daughter of William Durning, a prosperous Liverpool merchant, and his wife, Jane. George Holt was born in Rochdale and bred to the family mill and dye-works, but in 1807 he was apprenticed to Samuel Hope, a leading Liverpool cotton broker. His marriage into the Durning family drew him into the influential circle of Unitarian businessmen. Having set up his own broking business, he helped to found the Bank of Liverpool and the Liverpool and London Assurance Company and became fully involved in the public life of Liverpool, especially in the dock and water committees.<h2>
<a name="Educationandearlycareer"></a>Education and early career</h2>From childhood Alfred Holt showed an adventurous spirit (he once escaped from a dame-school). From 1838 to 1844 he attended a private boys' school kept by a Unitarian minister at Knutsford, Cheshire. One of the pupils was George Fairbairn, son of the engineer Sir William Fairbairn, who, by giving Alfred his own working model steam engine, generated his lifelong interest in steam. On 1 July 1846 Alfred began a five-year apprenticeship to Edward Woods, engineer to the Liverpool and Manchester Railway. During that time, in his own workshop, he made model steam engines and took lessons in mathematics, chemistry, and drawing, and also in literature, which may have accounted for the Homeric names of his ships. However, by the time his apprenticeship had ended the railway industry was in depression and job prospects bleak. Fortunately Holt was able to find clerical employment with the shipowners Lamport and Holt, in which his brother Philip Henry (1830&#150;1915) was a partner. Alfred Holt soon learned the basic principles of marine engineering and, by sailing to the Mediterranean in the steamship <i>Orontes</i> as supernumerary engineer, its practical aspects. In January 1852 Holt set up as a consulting engineer in an office in India Buildings (built by his father in 1834 and occupied by Holt until his retirement), finding work testing locomotives for his old master and supervising the construction of iron steamships.<h2>
<a name="TheOceanSteamShipCompany"></a>The Ocean Steam Ship Company</h2>Holt soon abandoned locomotive work to concentrate on the problems that beset iron steamships in the early days, mainly connected with the screw propeller, the iron construction, and the compound engine. His golden opportunity came when Thomas Ainsworth of Cleator, Cumberland, sought his advice on the defective engines of his steam-powered hybrid brig, <i>Alpha</i>, built for the iron-ore trade between Whitehaven and Cardiff. Holt became engineer and agent to Ainsworth and, most importantly, got to know Isaac Middleton (<i>d</i>. 1878), who became his pioneer captain in all his undertakings. Such mutual respect between managers and captains was to be a keystone in the Holt management style for a century. Holt's success with <i>Alpha</i> led his father to invest with Ainsworth in another steamer, the <i>Dumbarton Youth</i>, of which Holt was also engineer and agent; its blue funnel became the symbol of the line that carried Holt's name around the world. Holt also designed the <i>Cleator</i>, built in Liverpool.<br>
<br>In 1855 Alfred and Philip Holt invested in five larger vessels for the competitive and therefore risky West India trade. At one stage Alfred even considered giving up and going into the family cotton-broking business, but he held out until 1864 before selling out to a rival firm, keeping only the <i>Cleator</i>. In January 1864 Philip left his partnership in Lamport and Holt and joined Alfred permanently. Together they considered possible trade routes and decided on China. Because of the vast distance involved China was considered beyond the reach of steamships, which required frequent rebunkering, but the thrill of beating the clipper, the most prestigious sailing ship of its time, appealed to Alfred's adventurous spirit. With American vessels out of the running because of the civil war, freight rates for tea rose dramatically. Alfred fitted the <i>Cleator</i> with a new, compact, vertical compound tandem engine whose boiler could take a pressure of 60 lb p.s.i., a major breakthrough in that for the first time the Board of Trade accepted such high pressures at sea. The gains in practical and commercial efficiency were immense. After trials the first three steamers of the Ocean Steam Ship Company were ordered from Scotts of Greenock (at a total cost of &pound;156,000) bearing the majestic names of <i>Agamemnon</i>, <i>Ajax</i>, and <i>Achilles</i>, Homeric heroes all. The company was registered on 11 January 1865, with 51 per cent of the shares held by the two brothers and the rest by family, friends, and the three captains. Each vessel carried about 3000 tons of cargo and could sail non-stop from Liverpool to Mauritius in thirty-seven days, some 8500 miles, carrying sufficient coal for an average speed of 10 knots. On 16 January 1866 the first public circular was issued. The route was to be Mauritius, Penang, Singapore, Hong Kong, and Shanghai, taking seventy-six days and returning via Foochow (Fuzhou); it was to be the mainstay of the business for more than a century.<br>
<br>The opening of the Suez Canal brought the Mecca pilgrim traffic, but success bred rivalry and by 1876 competition was intense. Unlike their competitors, who acquired larger and faster vessels, Alfred and Philip kept to their original schedules as the China trade sank into depression. Although the Holts had been reared in the classic Liberal ethos of free trade, John Swire, Holts' Shanghai agent, was convinced that a conference system was desirable, so by 1879 an outward and homeward conference was formed, with Swire as chairman, to secure freight rates and a fair division of cargoes. The Holt brothers were slow to be convinced and, having joined, did not always play by the rules. In 1891 Alfred Holt met the competition by ordering faster and larger ships capable of carrying heavier and more varied freight, and twenty-two steamers were added to his fleet between 1894 and 1902. In 1895 direct trade with the Dutch colonies was secured by the formation of a subsidiary company registered in the Netherlands; paid managers were appointed, including Holt's nephew <a href="#cosubject_58247">Richard Durning Holt [<i>see below</i>]</a>. Philip, who was responsible for the commercial side, changed the accounting system so that each voyage carried its own overheads. He promoted profitable feeder services and invested in banks and various subsidiary ventures before retiring in 1897. In 1902 Holts became a limited liability company, a move initially resisted by both brothers. Alfred retired in 1904.<h2>
<a name="Otherinterests"></a>Other interests</h2>Outside work Holt's chief joy was sailing. His steam yacht, the <i>Argo</i>, built in 1875 and designed by himself, was originally intended to be a fast mail-carrier to the Far East in hope of getting the government contract. In 1876 it was used for a Liverpool Museum scientific expedition. The honour Holt most prized was his election as a member of the Institution of Civil Engineers in February 1875, earning him both a Watt medal and a Telford premium. He was also a member of the Institution of Naval Architects. Locally he was an active member of the Mersey Docks and Harbour Company, serving as its chairman in 1889&#150;90, chairman of the Liverpool Underwriters' Register of Iron Vessels, president of the Liverpool Engineering Society, and a director of the Liverpool Institute, an educational foundation. He loyally supported the Unitarian churches and their social outreach through the domestic mission. Although not politically active he was a committed Liberal and long-standing member of the Reform Club. He felt the greatest affinity with John Bright, as a fellow businessman strongly opposed to government interference in the form of factory legislation. On similar grounds Holt opposed Plimsoll's <span class="roman">Merchant Shipping Act</span> of 1875&#150;6. His ships were all built to a higher class than Lloyds A1; indeed, &#145;Holts class&#146; became an official designation, so he argued that attempts to enforce standards, even on humanitarian grounds, would result in standards generally slipping to the legal minimum.<br>
<br>Holt also enjoyed fell-walking, shooting, theatre, horse races, and Christmas parties. He wrote a pamphlet about the burial-place of his hero, Oliver Cromwell, which was published in 1899. He was married first to Catherine Long on 20 September 1865. They had a daughter, Jane, who married Professor Sir William Herdman, eminent marine biologist and benefactor of Liverpool University; a son, George, who became one of the firm's managers; and another son, who died in his teens. After Catherine's death in 1869 Alfred Holt married her cousin Frances Long, on 4 July 1871, and had two more sons. Active to the last, he died of a seizure at his home, Crofton, Sudley Road, Aigburth, Liverpool, on 28 November 1911. He was cremated as one might expect of a founder of the local crematorium; his ashes were interred at Brook Street Unitarian Chapel, Knutsford.<h2>
<a name="SirRichardHoltshippingcareer"></a>Sir Richard Holt: shipping career</h2>Philip Holt died in 1914, but ever since Alfred's retirement Richard Durning Holt had been senior partner and held the reins. <a name="cosubject_58247"></a><span class="headword">Sir Richard Durning Holt</span>, baronet  (1868&#150;1941)<span class="occ"></span>, was born at 29 Edge Lane, West Derby, Liverpool on 13 November 1868, one of the five sons of Robert Durning Holt (1832&#150;1908), Alfred's brother and a cotton broker in the family business as well as a leader of the Liberal Party on the Liverpool city council. His mother was Lawrencina (Lally), daughter of Richard Potter of Manchester and sister of the Fabian socialist Beatrice Webb [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36799/', "Webb, (Martha) Beatrice")</script>]. Richard attended Winchester College and New College, Oxford, and in 1889 entered his uncle's firm. He served in various departments to learn the business, and in 1892 undertook an extensive tour of the Far East, becoming familiar with the work done in Singapore, Hong Kong, and Shanghai. In 1895 he was promoted to manager. His career was regarded as a model. Described as &#145;a great financier&#146;  (<span class="italic">Journal of Commerce</span>), he showed almost instinctive commercial acumen, coupled with a strength of personality that enabled him to hold together &#145;a powerful management team of varied and often warring individuals who gave their complete loyalty to the company&#146;  (Falkus, 21).<br>
<br>Two years after being admitted to partnership Richard Durning Holt married Eliza Lawrence Wells, an American, and with their three daughters they shared an idyllic family life, though their hoped-for son was stillborn in 1904. Beatrice Webb noted that &#145;Dick &hellip; under the influence of a charming American wife [has] developed into a shrewd pleasant, public-spirited man&#146;. However, she added &#145;he retains his parrot-like prejudices against all new ideas; in political intelligence he is still a child&#146;  (Dutton, xiv). Holt nevertheless remained very much the archetypal shipowner and very much a Liverpool man. In April 1939 he reflected in a speech at Liverpool town hall:<blockquote>It has been work that has been a real true pleasure, and I have enjoyed living in Liverpool. I was brought up to the idea that we were Liverpool people and that was where I was expected to work &hellip; if I didn't like it I had got to make myself like it and do it properly. (Falkus, 14)</blockquote>
<h2>
<a name="Politicalcareer"></a>Political career</h2>In 1904 Holt debated whether he should seek a political career. In his political convictions he adhered to the creed of free trade Liberalism in which the family business had been nurtured. He was unsuccessful in Liverpool by-elections in 1903 and 1906, but in 1907 he won Hexham, Northumberland, joining a parliamentary party with a massive majority. In 1909 he recorded that &#145;Parliament is very attractive to me&#146;  (Dutton, 19). However, the Liberal Party was not wholly in agreement with his traditionalist views. Holt opposed Lloyd George's social policies, not because he lacked sympathy for the workers but because he disbelieved in government interference with business. None the less, he professed himself largely converted to the idea of a minimum wage in 1900. Likewise in 1929 he at first opposed the idea of public works to provide employment, contending that it would put up prices. Then, reflecting that it might result in the unemployed having to earn their keep, he changed his line.<br>
<br>Holt's principal pre-1914 activity was organizing the &#145;Holt cave&#146;, a group of like-minded businessmen still wedded to Liberal watchwords of peace, retrenchment, and reform. During the First World War Holt opposed conscription and the government's controls. He even took the head of the Ministry of Shipping to court over the legality of the government's claim to command the services of shipowners. From 1916 he favoured peace negotiations and advocated milder terms of surrender for Germany. He rejected the idea of the &#145;knock-out blow&#146;, as a result of which he was rejected by the Hexham Liberal Party for the 1918 election. He made other attempts to recover a parliamentary seat without success.<br>
<br>By now Holt thoroughly distrusted most of the leading Liberals, especially Lloyd George. He also saw that the Liberal Party was now the third runner politically and that without proportional representation, which he strongly advocated, it was doomed. He nevertheless had some sympathy for the grievances of workers and criticized the methods by which other shipowners repressed a strike in London in 1912. He advocated recognition of trade unions and, like his brother Lawrence, wished to end the degrading system of casual labour for dockers.<br>
<br>As his political star sank Holt found increased satisfaction in his shipping interests. The takeover of the China Mutual Steam Navigation Company in 1902, the development of his firm's Australian, Pacific, and American trades, and the expansion of property holdings in the Far East had already been largely his initiatives. Holt played a key role at the time of the Royal Mail Shipping Group crisis, so that Elder Dempster, the west Africa shipping company, as well as Glen Line, came under his chairmanship in 1932. In 1923 he became chairman of the Liverpool Steamship Owners' Association and chairman of Martins Bank, which incorporated the Bank of Liverpool, of which his grandfather had been a founder in 1831.<br>
<br>Holt was a JP for the county of Lancaster, made an honorary LLD of Liverpool University in 1933, and received a baronetcy in 1935 in recognition of his outstanding contribution to the shipping industry. Despite the strains of war and loss of profits in the subsequent depression, he brought his firm and with it, to some extent, Liverpool's shipping through both, largely on the basis of Victorian virtues rather than technical expertise. R. H. Thornton, a manager of Ocean until 1953, wrote of Holt as &#145;the dominating, outstanding personality of it all, shrewd, vigorous and witty, and a very warm heart &hellip; A man of extremely high commercial principles, dogmatic mind, ungracious in argument, invariably loyal in defeat&#146;  (Falkus, 22). Beatrice Webb's description of him as a conventional capitalist is unfair. His diary, which reveals both his strengths and his blind spots, shows how much he cherished principles as opposed to commercial expediency.<br>
<br>Holt's main relaxation was shooting and fishing at Abernethy in the Cairngorms. Traditional, even in domestic life, he always dressed for dinner, was shaved by his valet, and never learned to drive his Blue Funnel blue Daimler. He also furiously disapproved of smoking. He remained a staunch Unitarian all his life and in 1918 was elected president of the British and Foreign Unitarian Association. He died at his home, 54 Ullet Road, Liverpool, on 22 March 1941. His wife survived him.<br>
