<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Agate,  James Evershed</span>  (1877&#150;1947), <span class="occ">drama critic</span>, was born at Pendleton, Lancashire, on 9 September 1877, the eldest of the five sons and one daughter of Charles James Agate (1832&#150;1909), cotton manufacturer's agent, and his wife, Eulalie Julia Young, daughter of a widowed piano teacher. Although generally regarded during his lifetime as the writer from Manchester who had conquered London in the &#145;man from the provinces&#146; manner of Arnold Bennett and J. B. Priestley, Agate was not of Lancashire ancestry. His father came originally from Horsham, Sussex, and his mother was a Yorkshirewoman who had been educated in Paris and Heidelberg and studied the piano under a pupil of Chopin. The young Agates were taught to speak French fluently and to appreciate the fine points of music and the arts. Their father was chairman of the committee of the Unitarian chapel which the family attended; James in his teens was its secretary. Charles Agate was also a keen theatregoer who had once run away from home to see Macready. He encouraged his children to visit good plays and took James to see Sarah Bernhardt perform; she became for the child the model of theatrical performance ever after; &#145;Her acting on that evening&#146; he said later, &#145;unveiled for me the ecstasy of the body and the torture of the mind&#146;  (Harding, 19). His only sister, May, later studied under her in Paris.<br>
<br>Agate was educated at Giggleswick, where he topped his class in English, Latin, history, and French, and at Manchester grammar school. Oxford or Cambridge would have suited him perfectly but he left school in 1896 to enter into his father's business, learned to weave, and sold grey cloth for seventeen years. Although his mind was more concerned with the arts than with the cotton trade, he was described as &#145;a fascinating mixture of the intellectual and the philistine&#146;  (Hobson, Knightley, and Russell, 88). From boyhood Agate had been a &#145;cricket fanatic&#146;  (Harding, 7); he later liked to live in Derbyshire, to dress like a sporting farmer, and to own and to exhibit show hackneys, a pastime which he continued for much of his life.<br>
<br>A passionate theatregoer, Agate in January 1906 wrote a letter on the subject to the <span class="italic">Daily Dispatch</span> in Manchester. The editor printed it and asked for more, resulting in a weekly drama criticism column. After a year he joined the <span class="italic">Manchester Guardian</span> team of critics which included C. E. Montague and Allan Monkhouse, and under their guidance he &#145;quickly mastered the tricks of the trade&#146; of journalism  (Harding, 37).<br>
<br>During the First World War, with his experience of horses, Agate was sent as a captain in the Army Service Corps to buy hay in the south of France. This duty gave some leisure for writing. His first book, in the form of letters, <span class="italic">L. of C. (Lines of Communication)</span>, came out in 1917 and was followed by a book of essays on the theatre, <span class="italic">Buzz, Buzz!</span> (1918). In his early twenties he had written a play called <span class="italic">The After Years</span> which was less than successfully realized, as was his later fictional output of another play and three novels, which have been described as &#145;of small import&#146;  (Harding, 25).<br>
<br>Agate married in France in 1918 Sidonie Jos&eacute;phine Edm&eacute;e Mourret-Castillon, daughter of a rich landowner from Salon. The marriage lasted only a short time. From then Agate was openly homosexual in his relationships.<br>
<br>After his return to London, Agate bought, with characteristic caprice, a general store in South Lambeth Road, a business venture which rapidly failed. But he was finding success as a critic. In 1921 Filson Young appointed him to the chair of dramatic criticism on the <span class="italic">Saturday Review</span>, a covetable post once held by G. B. Shaw, whose contributions had first fired in Agate the ambition to become a drama critic. The talent that he displayed won him, in 1923, the theatre critic's post on the <span class="italic">Sunday Times</span>, which he held until his death. He was also drama critic for the British Broadcasting Corporation from 1925 to 1932.<br>
<br>Although his fiction was unsuccessful, Agate set his hand to writing about himself, and aspired to be the diarist of his epoch. In twelve years from 1935 he wrote nine volumes under the title <span class="italic">Ego</span>, the last appearing posthumously. They record chiefly the books, plays, personalities, club talk, and bohemian life of the time. But Agate had no interest in politics or social problems and this limited what might have been a wonderful landscape of London life.<br>
<br>Agate never lost his sense of himself as a character bestriding his own stage. Unashamedly the egoist, he played the part with a nice mixture of humour and panache. He had a &#145;feverish love of a daily crisis&#146;  (Hobson, Knightley, and Russell, 143). Editors generally were tolerant of his extravagance and exhibitionist nature, although doubts crept in as his reputation as &#145;another Oscar Wilde&#146; spread  (ibid., 150). In 1945 Lord Kemsley, proprietor of the <span class="italic">Sunday Times</span>, threatened to replace him with a &#145;married man&#146; when he learned, belatedly, of his homosexuality  (ibid., 276).<br>
<br>Agate was an &#145;immensely prolific&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 7 June 1947, 6) and at times inspired critic, writing with passion and scholarship. His <span class="italic">Sunday Times</span> articles were described as being in themselves &#145;wonderful performances&#146;  (Hobson, Knightley, and Russell, 146). He was a hedonist in the best sense, seeking pleasure of the senses to the end; but his hedonism was mitigated by discernment. He died at his home at Queen Alexandra Mansions, Grape Street, Holborn, London, on 6 June 1947 and was buried at Hendon Park cemetery, Mill Hill, on 11 June.<br>
