</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Vertue,  George</span>  (1684&#150;1756), <span class="occ">engraver and antiquary</span>, was born in the parish of St Martin-in-the-Fields, London, on 17 November 1684, the eldest child of Roman Catholic parents, James Vertue (<i>d</i>. 1711) and Mary Carter (<i>c</i>.1663&#150;1743). His mother had been a servant in the household of the duke of York (the future James II), and both parents were in service at the exiled court of James II. His father's later profession is unknown, though he is said to have been a tailor. Following what he described as &#145;proper schooling&#146;, Vertue was apprenticed on 25 March 1697 to a foreign-born silver engraver in London, probably the French silversmith Blaise Gentot. On Gentot's return to France around 1700, Vertue undertook private artistic study for two years before being apprenticed to the well-connected reproductive engraver Michael Vandergucht.<br>
<br>After seven years under Vandergucht, in 1709 Vertue set himself up as an independent engraver, producing a variety of work, notably reproductions of portraits by Sir Godfrey Kneller. From 1711 he continued his artistic education by attending the Great Queen Street Academy, run by Kneller. In 1715 he engraved that artist's portrait of the newly crowned George I on a large scale, and by Vertue's own account it was this work that established him. At this time Vertue was patronized by Heneage Finch, fifth earl of Winchilsea, and was receiving a number of individual prestigious commissions. In 1714 the lord mayor of London, Richard Hoare, engaged him to design and engrave a two-sheet print, <span class="italic">The View of the Charity Children in the Strand</span>, for a payment of &pound;100. Two further well-paid projects, for a map of the British empire for the diplomat Henry Ferne and a reproduction of Holbein's painting of the Barber&#150;Surgeons for that company, were aborted. But in 1717 Vertue was appointed the official engraver to the newly revived Society of Antiquaries. As engraver, a post he held until his death, he was responsible for engraving and printing all the images published under the society's auspices, collected as the <span class="italic">Vetusta monumenta</span>. This amounted to sixty-four projects, comprising some eighty-six separate plates. Although the plates remained the property of the society, this employment brought Vertue an average annual income of around &pound;20, providing an unusual source of security for a professional engraver. In addition to the engraving work, Vertue undertook occasional duties such as attending the sale of John Talman's collection as the society's agent in 1727 and supplying &#145;a press for holding prints&#146; in 1754. Uniquely, he was also a fellow of the society, a privilege denied to the antiquaries' subsequent engravers, and so took an active part in scholarly activities, presenting a paper on the tomb of Edward the Confessor in 1731 (published in the first volume of <span class="italic">Archaeologia</span>, 1770) and describing the method of taking prints off medals to the society in 1746. Additionally, he frequently undertook private antiquarian commissions from members of the society.<br>
<br>Vertue's researches into the history of art in Britain began late in 1712 and occupied him for the rest of his life. Drawing on published and manuscript sources, as well as on his extensive travels around Britain, it would have been by far the most comprehensive account of the visual arts produced to date. But during his lifetime the most substantial published manifestations of his labours were his accounts of the works of Wenceslaus Hollar (1745) and of the medallist Thomas Simon (1753).<br>
<br>On 17 February 1720 Vertue married Margaret Evans (<i>d</i>. 1776), an event recorded by the artist in an etching (now in the Victoria and Albert Museum) showing the couple &#145;in the very Habits they were Married&#146;, posed before a wall adorned with his engravings. During the 1720s Vertue established himself as a leading figure in London's art circles: in 1724 he was made secretary of the Rose and Crown Club, and in 1726 he was elected to the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/96316', "Society of the Virtuosi of St Luke")</script>, whose meetings he attended through to 1743. Probably through the influence of George Clarke of Christ Church, a keen patron of the artist, Vertue succeeded Michael Burghers in 1727 as Oxford University engraver, taking on the responsibility for the engraving of the almanacs. The books were published by Oxford University Press and generally designed by a Mr Green or Greene of Oxford, but this post brought Vertue a handsome &pound;50 a year through to 1751.<br>
<br>During the 1720s Vertue was very active as a book illustrator, notable projects being the illustrations for an edition of John Urry's <span class="italic">Works of Geoffrey Chaucer</span> (1721), Gerard Brandt's <span class="italic">History of the Reformation</span> (1720&#150;23), and Edmund Waller's <span class="italic">Works</span> (1729). By the 1730s he tended instead to produce only portrait frontispieces for books. Thomas Dodd was able to list more than 120 separate portraits of this type produced between 1709 and 1756, and even this is demonstrably incomplete. Almost all were reproductions, although a handful were original designs by the artist, including the portraits of Edward Calamy that appeared in his <span class="italic">Sermons</span> (1722) and of Samuel Dale for his <span class="italic">Pharmacologia</span> (1737). Vertue's reputation in this field was such that puffs for new publications would often cite the presence of an engraved portrait by him as a selling point.<br>
<br>Vertue also established himself as a successful independent publisher of prints. In March 1726 he issued a printed sheet announcing the publication by subscription of &#145;The Effigies of Twelve of the Most Celebrated English Poets&#146; (published 1726&#150;9), an early example of such a commercial scheme. The idea was developed on a grander scale by the Knapton brothers with their <span class="italic">Heads of the Kings of England</span> (1733&#150;6), for which Vertue was co-publisher and engraver. Vertue designed and engraved forty elaborate folio portrait reproductions and engraved twenty folio prints of royal monuments after designs by Gravelot. However, on the Knaptons' next project, the more extensive <span class="italic">Heads of Illustrious Persons</span> (1737&#150;42), Vertue was employed on only nine plates before being dismissed for slowness, being displaced by the Flemish engraver Jacobus Houbraken. He continued to publish independently; the last two pages of his published account of the works of the medallist Thomas Simon (1753) lists more than a hundred prints &#145;Engraved, already Printed and Published&#146; and available from him at his shop in Brownlow Street, Drury Lane. This includes groups of historical portraits, <span class="italic">Nine Historical Portraits</span> (1742&#150;51) and the accompanying pamphlet by the artist, the twelve heads of poets, and many single portrait plates, together with antiquarian views and plans, depictions of curiosities, and maps.<br>
<br>Besides regular work for the Society of Antiquaries and the University of Oxford, and for the booksellers, Vertue received occasional commissions of a highly various nature. He produced the original design for the massive silver wine cooler commissioned by the banker and goldsmith Henry Jerningham in 1730&#150;31 and executed by Charles Kandler and John Michael Rysbrack in 1731&#150;4; engraved James Gibbs's designs for the Radcliffe Camera for the trustees of the library in 1737; and in 1748 was appointed by the office of the ordinance (whose comptroller was Charles Frederick, formerly director of the Society of Antiquaries) to engrave the design of the royal fireworks that were to celebrate the treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle in Green Park. The last commission was recorded in great detail by the engraver in a diary, which documents his frustration as an ambitious project involving a whole volume of large prints and text worth &pound;500 to him was whittled down following delays to comprise only a single plate and the production of the tickets, at a charge of 20 guineas.<br>
<br>Vertue's autobiography, prepared as part of his history of British art, downplays the variety of his commercial printmaking activities in favour of his work as a draughtsman and antiquary in the employment of a series of prestigious patrons. During the 1720s and 1730s he enjoyed a sustained relationship with the earl of Oxford, for whom he drew and engraved and acted as an occasional art agent and touring companion. At the earl's death in 1741 Lady Oxford continued to patronize Vertue, engaging him to draw up an inventory of the Oxford collection and commissioning a number of prints. The earl's daughter, the duchess of Portland, employed him to engrave a series of plates of curiosities in her collection in the late 1740s. Frederick, prince of Wales, also employed Vertue extensively between 1749 and his death in 1751. For the prince, Vertue provided watercolours from stock, acted as an art adviser, and drew up manuscript catalogues of the royal collections. Most commonly, his work for &eacute;lite patrons involved the production of private plates reproducing family portraits or monuments, for which the artist quoted a charge of 6 to 10 guineas in 1737. A detailed bill to the duke of Norfolk dated 1745&#150;6 encapsulates the variety of his activities, among them charges for copying portraits of the duke's ancestors, drawing a &#145;lineal pedigree&#146;, and providing a volume of prints by Hollar. Only occasionally did he produce original portraits, such as the 1740 gilt watercolour of the third Baron Coleraine (British Museum) taken from life, which was created following a series of antiquarian tours with the baron during the 1730s.<br>
<br>Vertue's output as a printmaker was prodigious. His manuscript list of his own engravings (held in the Lewis Walpole Library) includes some 500 prints produced between 1708 and 1740 alone, and this is far from complete. He presumably employed assistants, although he mentions only one, Giles King. On several occasions he made up volumes of proofs of his own prints, created variously for James West in 1733, for the Bodleian Library in 1737, and for the earl of Oxford and for Thomas Frankland in 1740. By 1741 his history of British art was nearing a state of completion, and he even prepared a self-portrait to serve as a frontispiece, but the death of Oxford meant that the plan to publish was abandoned. Although suffering ill health, Vertue continued working into the 1750s, publishing his account of Thomas Simon (1753), producing frontispieces and plates, working on his notebooks, and preparing catalogues of the collections of Charles I, James II, and the duke of Buckingham (the first two were later published by Horace Walpole).<br>
<br>Vertue died on 24 July 1756 and was buried on 30 July in Westminster Abbey. His will specified some &pound;285 in cash payments to relatives and friends, in addition to the repayment of outstanding debts and mourning rings for nineteen individuals, among them the sculptor Rysbrack and the auctioneer Richard Ford. His remaining wealth was left to Margaret, which, according to Vertue's friend the antiquary William Cole, amounted to as much as &pound;1000. His extensive collections of books, drawings, and prints were auctioned by Ford (as stipulated in his will) in sales running between 16 and 22 March 1757. Vertue's independently published antiquarian plates were acquired from his widow by the Society of Antiquaries and subsequently republished for members, while the rest remained with his widow and were distributed after her death by a sale at Langford's on 24&#150;5 February 1777 (with John Boydell as the most extensive purchaser). The forty or more volumes of Vertue's notes on the history of art were purchased by Horace Walpole in 1758, who from September 1759 worked them up into what was published as his <span class="italic">Anecdotes of Painting in England</span> (1762&#150;71). As transmitted by Walpole, and published in their original form by the Walpole Society in six volumes (1930&#150;55), Vertue's <span class="italic">Note Books</span> have been a cornerstone of British art history, and have ensured that his memory survives. His reputation as an artist, however, went quickly into decline, suffering from a shift in taste that favoured the expressive potential of original printmaking over the assiduous and undeniably dry manner of his reproductions. Yet it was as both engraver and historian that he was celebrated by contemporaries, and it is the very variety of his professional activities and commercial enterprises that demonstrates most fully the vitality of the culture in which he operated.<br>
