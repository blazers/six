<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Dewar, Sir  James</span>  (1842&#150;1923), <span class="occ">chemist and physicist</span>, was born at Kincardine-on-Forth, Scotland, on 20 September 1842, the youngest son of Thomas Dewar, vintner, and his wife, Ann Eadie, daughter of a shipowner. At the age of ten his schooling was interrupted by an attack of rheumatic fever, and during the period of incapacity that followed he occupied himself in making fiddles&#151;an exercise to which he was wont to attribute his manipulative skill. On recovering he was sent to Dollar Academy, and thence, about 1858, to Edinburgh University. There he worked successively under James David Forbes, the professor of natural philosophy, Lyon Playfair, the professor of chemistry, whose demonstrator he was, and, on Playfair's resignation in 1869, under his successor Alexander Crum Brown. In 1869 he was appointed lecturer on chemistry in the Royal (Dick) Veterinary College, where he later became professor. From 1873 he was also assistant chemist to the Highland and Agricultural Society, with the duty of delivering what he called &#145;peripatetic lectures&#146;. In 1875 he left Edinburgh for Cambridge, having been elected to the Jacksonian chair of natural experimental philosophy. Two years later he was elected Fullerian professor of chemistry at the Royal Institution of Great Britain, London. Both these chairs he held until his death. While at Edinburgh he married in 1871 Helen Rose, daughter of William Banks, of that city. They had no children.<br>
<br>During his time at Edinburgh Dewar worked on both organic and inorganic chemistry. His first published paper, presented to the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1867, described a &#145;simple mechanical arrangement&#146; for illustrating the structure of the non-saturated hydrocarbons, and showed how it could be used to represent seven different formulae for benzene, including the well-known Dewar formula. The device was sent by Playfair to the German chemist F. A. Kekul&eacute;, who conceived the widely recognized ring formula for benzene. Kekul&eacute; then invited Dewar to spend the summer of 1867 in his laboratory at Ghent. Dewar went on to do work on chlorosulphuric acid, the oxidation products of picoline, the thermal equivalents of the oxides of chlorine, and the temperature of the sun and of the electric spark. Of some interest is his work on the specific heat of Graham's hydrogenium, thought of as a volatile metal associated with hydrogen. During this investigation, in order to prevent the influx of heat into his calorimeter, he employed, in 1872, the vacuum jacket which later proved indispensable for the liquefaction of gases, and became, though not in his hands, the silver coated &#145;Thermos&#146; flask. Similarly, the use of coconut charcoal for absorbing gases, which also played a most important part in his later work, was mentioned in a paper he published with P. G. Tait in 1874, entitled &#145;On a new method of obtaining very perfect vacua&#146;  (<span class="italic">Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh</span>, 8, 1875, 348&#150;9). During this period Dewar's complementary interest in biological subjects, which repeatedly appeared in his subsequent researches, was shown by his investigation with Dr Arthur Gamgee in 1871 of the constitution and physiological relations of cystine, and by elaborate studies conducted from 1873 onwards with John Gray M'Kendrick, professor of physiology in Glasgow University from 1876 to 1906, on the physiological action of light on the eye.<br>
<br>Soon after moving south, in 1875, Dewar joined George Downing Liveing, then the professor of chemistry at Cambridge, in a series of spectroscopic investigations the results of which were published at intervals over a quarter of a century. Much of this research was designed to controvert Norman Lockyer's speculations on the dissociation of elements at very high temperatures. Some of the work was done at Cambridge, but the Royal Institution, where he had better laboratory facilities, became the chief centre of Dewar's experimental activities, and, indeed, of his whole life.<br>
<br>At the Royal Institution, Dewar implemented the extensive research programme into cryogenics for which he is best known. In 1878, at a Friday evening lecture, he showed in operation the apparatus by which L. P. Cailletet had effected the partial liquefaction of oxygen; at another lecture, in 1884, he exhibited the gas in the form of a true liquid by the aid of a modification of the apparatus of Z. F. Wr&oacute;blewski and K. S. Olszewski. In 1891, using essentially improved methods, he discovered that both liquid oxygen and liquid ozone are attracted by the magnet. Hydrogen, the only one of Faraday's &#145;permanent&#146; gases which had not been liquefied, was for the first time collected by Dewar as a liquid in an open vessel in 1898, and in the following year he obtained it as a transparent ice. This brought him into a dispute over priority with William Hampson, consultant to Brin's Oxygen Company (later British Oxygen Company). For his work on hydrogen Dewar built a large machine, weighing a couple of tons, in which he made use of the Joule&#150;Thomson effect by continuously expanding the highly compressed gas through a fine orifice on a cascade principle. His success was largely due to the inclusion of two novel features&#151;the vacuum jacket as a means of heat insulation, and a device consisting of a coiled tube which gave sufficient elasticity to enable the liquid gas to be drawn off without fracture of the glass by the intense cold. He also attempted the liquefaction of helium, the only known gas not reduced to the liquid state, but had not succeeded when, in 1908, H. Kamerlingh Onnes, working in his cryogenic laboratory at Leiden, obtained the liquid.<br>
<br>Dewar's research facilities were greatly improved in 1896 when Ludwig Mond generously gave &pound;100,000 to found and equip the Davy&#150;Faraday Laboratory next door to the Royal Institution. He became its first director. In 1902, the year in which he was president at Belfast of the British Association, Dewar again turned his attention to charcoal, studying the conditions under which it must be prepared in order to develop the greatest activity, and finding that its power of absorbing gases is enormously increased by cold. He used it for the liquefaction of gases, the analysis of gaseous mixtures without liquefaction, and, above all, for the production of very high vacua; this last application probably contributed more than any other single agency to the advances made by atomic physics in immediately succeeding years. Charcoal also enabled him to make vacuum storage vessels of metal larger and stronger than was possible with glass, for he found that a portion of charcoal placed in the vacuous space absorbed occluded gas escaping from the metal and thus maintained the vacuum.<br>
<br>In producing liquid gases Dewar always had in view their utilization in opening up new fields to research. Thus as soon as he obtained them in sufficient quantity, as well as devising methods for their thermometry and making determinations of their physical constants, he applied them to a wide range of pioneer explorations of the properties of matter at very low temperatures&#151;chemical and photographic action, phosphorescence, the cohesion and strength of materials, and, with Professor John Ambrose Fleming, of University College, London, electric and magnetic effects such as conduction, thermoelectricity, dielectric constants, and magnetic permeability. With Henri Moissan, Dewar liquefied fluorine in 1897 and in 1903 solidified it. Between 1903 and 1908 he made several researches on radium, investigating with Sir William Crookes the effect of extreme cold on its emanations, examining with Pierre Curie the gases occluded or given off by it, and determining the rate at which it evolves helium. A notable piece of research, which he published in 1913, showed that the mean atomic specific heats of the elements between the boiling-points of liquid nitrogen and hydrogen, when plotted in terms of their atomic weights, exhibit a definite periodic variation instead of being approximately uniform as they are at ordinary temperatures. Similar observations, published posthumously, of the molecular specific heats of many series or homologous groups of inorganic and organic compounds revealed some striking relations.<br>
<br>During the First World War, in the restricted time left for research after meeting the demands of government departments, Dewar paid attention to the chemistry of the soap bubble, which in 1878&#150;9 had been the subject of the first of the nine courses of Christmas lectures for young people which he delivered at the Royal Institution. He elucidated the conditions necessary for the production of long-lived bubbles and flat films, and studied the interference colours displayed when a jet of air was made to play upon their surface. At this period also he made from the roof of the institution a series of observations of sky radiation with a delicate charcoal thermoscope.<br>
<br>The papers recording the spectroscopic researches which Dewar made with Liveing were published in collected form in 1915, and the rest of his papers in 1927. In addition to the research recorded in his journal papers, he also engaged in a number of other scientific projects. These included, for example, the experiments resulting in the invention of cordite which he and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30319/', "Sir Frederick Augustus Abel")</script> carried out as members of the government committee on explosives (1888&#150;91), one of the special chemical and other researches entailed by his large practice as an expert witness. The work on cordite involved him and Abel in prolonged litigation with Alfred Nobel, who believed that their patent for cordite infringed his own for ballistite. The case eventually went to the House of Lords, where Nobel finally lost. It cost him &pound;28,000 and left him permanently embittered. Dewar was also an authority on sewage disposal and water supply, and a member of the Balfour commission on London water supply (1893&#150;4); for many years he and Crookes made daily chemical and bacteriological analyses of the water distributed to the metropolis. He was elected FRS in 1877, knighted in 1904, and received many honours from scientific societies in Europe and America.<br>
<br>Well read in English literature, especially poetry, Dewar was devoted to music; a little violin playing, with his wife as accompanist, often ended the day's work in the small hours of the morning. His rooms at the Royal Institution and his house at Cambridge were filled with <i>objets d'art</i> of all kinds, and he was a fine judge of wine and tobacco. To many contemporaries, Dewar was seen as quarrelsome, litigious, and impatient, with few close friends in the scientific community. To others, while sometimes choleric and prone to vigour of expression, he was seen as a kindly and generous man. His contributions to science lay rather in the discovery of new facts than in the elaboration of theory; he published no theoretical papers. As an experimenter he was unsurpassed, as daring and imaginative in conception as he was brilliant and sure in execution. Dewar died at his home in the Royal Institution, 21 Albemarle Street, on 27 March 1923.<br>
