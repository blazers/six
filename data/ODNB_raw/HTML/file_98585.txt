<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Ghoussoub, Mai</span>  (1952&#150;2007), <span class="occ">writer, publisher, and artist</span>, was born in Beit Shabab, a town in the mountains above Beirut, Lebanon, on 2 November 1952, the second daughter of Raymond Ghoussoub, lawyer and amateur footballer, and his wife, Maggie Bridi, mathematics teacher. Her parents were Maronite Christian Arabs. She was educated at the Lyc&eacute;e Franco-Libanais, Beirut. As an eighteen-year-old she gave early evidence of intelligent determination when she wrote, and tried unsuccessfully to publish, an article defending a maid condemned by the Lebanese media for killing her newborn baby, born after rape by the girl's employer. Ghoussoub took a degree in French literature at the Lebanese University simultaneously with a degree in mathematics at the American University in Beirut.<br>
<br>When in 1975 the Lebanese civil war broke out, Mai Ghoussoub was a member of a Trotskyite splinter group who refused to join the fighting; she and her childhood friend Andr&eacute; Gaspard helped distribute medical supplies in a poor, mixed area of Beirut that the doctors had left. Her car was hit by a shell when she was driving a casualty to hospital, and aged twenty-three, she lost an eye and left Beirut for treatment in England. Despite her facial injuries she remained strikingly attractive, with a dancer's slender body, long dark hair, and a penchant for dramatic clothes and jewellery.<br>
<br>In 1976, while working as a journalist in Paris, she wrote, together with Andr&eacute; Gaspard, a book about the society they had both left, <span class="italic">Comprendre le Liban</span> (1977), under the pseudonyms Magida Salma and Selim Accaoui. Back in London in 1978 Ghoussoub realized that London had no Arabic bookshop, rang Gaspard, and suggested that they start one. Although they lacked funds, work permits, and premises, they founded the Al-Saqi Bookshop at 26 Westbourne Grove, near Paddington, London, in the same year. It became the centre of Middle Eastern cultural life in London, and survived her, as did the publishing house that sprang from it, Saqi Books. In 1990 Ghoussoub and Gaspard co-founded a sister publishing house in Beirut, Dar-al-Saqi. Meanwhile she married, in 1978 at Islington register office, Jonathan Isaiah Rothschild, a translator five years her senior, and son of Jack Rothschild, management consultant. The marriage ended in divorce, and on 4 February 1991 she married the Lebanese writer and journalist Hazim Saghie, otherwise Hazem Saghieh (<i>b</i>. 1951), son of Rashid Saghie, merchant. Theirs was a notably happy relationship full of laughter and argument.<br>
<br>In the 1980s Mai Ghoussoub (as she continued to be known) had begun a parallel career as a visual, literary, and performance artist, studying sculpture at the Henry Moore Sculpture Studio, Morley College, London, but always seeing her creative practice as a unity. The issues she explored as a publisher were equally central to her art: freedom and censorship; sexual, cultural, and gender stereotyping; the power of women. She also saw fun and beauty as ends in themselves, so her sculptures were often playful, with witty, cartoonish lines. <span class="italic">Divas</span>, her 2000 monologue with sculptures, featured vividly energetic caricatures of such female icons as Josephine Baker, the Egyptian singer Umm Kulthum, and Edith Piaf, and Ghoussoub attached scraps of cloth, wire wool, beads, earrings, and &#145;frivolous&#146; accoutrements like a little gold bag to the strong, dark single lines of metal that defined the women's bodies. She exhibited nationally and internationally, in Beirut, Berlin, Copenhagen, and Chicago. In 2004, sharing a show with the Israeli artist Anna Sherbany, she dressed up in a white <i>chador</i> and dark glasses and walked around Shoreditch with a tennis racquet: no one batted an eyelid, proving her point that London was basically tolerant.<br>
<br>During the 1990s Mai Ghoussoub was effectively creative director of the Saqi publishing house. She entertained visiting artists and intellectuals generously and was a source of inspiration on the alternative London arts scene. In 1998 she published her semi-autobiographical <span class="italic">Leaving Beirut</span>, a remarkable sequence of fluidly linked chapters that told the story of life during the civil war and in its bitter aftermath through a series of character studies; she managed to understand both the freedom fighter and the torturer. The book was framed by the lightly fictionalized story of an assignment Ghoussoub wrote as a girl at the French <i>lyc&eacute;e</i> that glorified revenge, incurring the displeasure of her revered Jewish teacher. This subtle, brilliant book explained the difficulty but absolute necessity of forgiveness.<br>
<br>Under Ghoussoub's and Gaspard's leadership Saqi Books published international literary fiction in English by writers including Ismail Kadare, first winner of the international Man Booker prize, brought key Western texts to the Arab world in translation, and published many books banned in Arab countries. In 2005 Ghoussoub spoke to the Freemuse Conference on Freedom of Expression and Music in Beirut, citing her central principle <i>mamnou&#146; al-mane</i> (&#145;it is banned to ban&#146;) and the Arabic saying <i>kul mamnou&#146; marghoub</i> (&#145;what is banned is desired&#146;). &#145;Words do not kill: people do&#146;, she said. Her art and journalism continued to challenge censorship, prejudice, and abuses of human rights.<br>
<br>In 2006 the Israeli invasion of the Lebanon sent Mai Ghoussoub into creative overdrive. She organized readings, co-curated an exhibition for the Liverpool Biennial, and published <span class="italic">Lebanon, Lebanon</span>, an elegiac anthology for the country she loved, in aid of child victims of the war. In 2007 she contracted severe gastroenteritis, was hospitalized (at St Mary's Hospital, Praed Street, Westminster) on 16 February, and died suddenly the following morning of heart failure. She was cremated at the west London crematorium, Kensal Green, and was survived by her husband, Hazim Saghie, her parents, and her sister Houda. Her obituary in the <span class="italic">Daily Star</span> of Lebanon praised her work but also evoked her restless cosmopolitan glamour: &#145;Ghoussoub was cool. Seeing her around Beirut or London &hellip; was like catching sight of Debbie Harry in New York &hellip; [She] made things happen&#146;  (<span class="italic">Daily Star</span>, 19 Feb 2007).<br>
