<span class="headword">Edwards,  Enoch</span>  (1852&#150;1912), <span class="occ">trade union leader and politician</span>, was born on 10 April 1852 in the north Staffordshire coal-mining village of Talk-o'-the-Hill, the eldest son of James Edwards, a coal-miner, and his wife, Eliza Boulton. Little is known about his private life except that he married Elizabeth Alice, daughter of Henry Rathbone, in 1875. He was educated briefly at a Primitive Methodist day school, was encouraged to read by some of the miners with whom he began to work from the age of nine, and taught at a Sunday school which had a small library attached to it.<br>
<br>Edwards worked at several collieries in north Staffordshire, and joined the local lodge of the North Staffordshire Miners' Association in 1870, becoming lodge treasurer within a few months, and checkweighman in 1875. Later in the same year he was made treasurer of the association, and two years later he was elected general secretary, a position that he held until his death thirty-five years later. He was the driving force behind the establishment in 1886 of the Midland Miners' Federation (which included unions in Shropshire, Staffordshire, and Warwickshire). As president of the federation from its foundation until 1912, Edwards helped to establish the Miners' Federation of Great Britain (MFGB) in 1889, and became a leading figure in the new organization. He was national treasurer from 1889 to 1904, and succeeded Ben Pickard as president from 1904 until his death in 1912. To Edwards, claimed Robert Smillie in 1912, &#145;more than anyone else living today, or anyone connected or who has been connected with the Federation, is due the fact that the miners have been for some time now, absolutely solidly organised together in one body&#146;  (Arnot, 121).<br>
<br>Edwards was active socially and politically at local, regional, and national levels. He was a Primitive Methodist preacher, a member of the Ancient Order of Foresters, and district secretary of the Ancient Order of Shepherds. He was a member of Burslem school board (1886&#150;95), a member, alderman, and mayor (1899&#150;1900) of Burslem town council, a member of Staffordshire county council, a JP for Burslem (and later Stoke-on-Trent), and a member of the royal commission on mines which reported in 1909.<br>
<br>He was the member of parliament for Hanley from 1906 to 1912. Although he stood first for the Liberal Party and then for the Labour Party, he remained a convinced free-trade Liberal even when the MFGB affiliated to the Labour Party in 1909. He stood as a Liberal candidate, unsuccessfully in 1900 and successfully in 1906; and then stood, successfully, as a Labour candidate in the two general elections of 1910. It is significant, however, that the local press continued to describe him as a &#145;Lib&#150;Lab&#146;, and that when he was adopted as Labour candidate in 1910 it was at a joint meeting of Hanley Trades Council and Hanley Liberal Association. His new Labour Party label, it has been claimed, &#145;made no difference at all&#146;  (Gregory, 169). Enoch Edwards died at 78 Lord Street, Southport, on 28 June 1912.<br>
