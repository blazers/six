<span class="headword">Fairfax,  Charles Brandon</span>  (1684&#150;1723), <span class="occ">dean of Down</span>, was baptized at St Martin-in-the-Fields, Westminster, on 18 September 1684, the third son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9075/', "Brian Fairfax (1633&#150;1711)")</script>, scholar and courtier, and Charlotte Cary (<i>d</i>. 1709). Educated at Westminster School, where he was a king's scholar in 1697, he entered Christ Church, Oxford, on 12 June 1702, at the age of seventeen. There he was exposed to the powerful influence of the dean, Henry Aldrich, who persuaded him to undertake a Latin translation of Palladio's <span class="italic">Antichit&agrave; di Roma</span>. This was published in Oxford in 1709 and marked out Fairfax as a member of the cultivated set which, under Aldrich's tutelage, interested itself in architecture as in the other arts. Fairfax's translation was evidence of the growing dissatisfaction with the baroque style of architecture associated with Wren, Vanbrugh, and Hawksmoor, and a harbinger of the neo-Palladian revival that would soon gather momentum.<br>
<br>Fairfax graduated BA in 1707 and proceeded MA in 1709. Thereafter, having been ordained, he secured preferments in Suffolk, first at Barnham and then, in 1718, at Euston. The latter incumbency suggested the patronage of the local grandee, the duke of Grafton. The duke's backing explained the unexpected removal of Fairfax to Ireland (of which Grafton was lord lieutenant), as dean of Down, in 1722. The emoluments of the deanery were estimated variously to be worth &pound;1000 to &pound;1300 annually&#151;more than many Irish bishoprics. This appointment may also have owed something to the intervention of Edward Southwell, the absentee owner of Downpatrick, the location of Fairfax's cathedral. Southwell, an Oxford graduate, retained strong connections with the university and also a lively interest in the arts, including architecture. Fairfax was rumoured still to sympathize with the Jacobites and was also suspected to be part of a clerical combination to embarrass the whig bishop of Down and Connor, Francis Hutchinson.<br>
<br>Although, as dean, Fairfax lacked any permanent residence in the town he attended assiduously to his duties, entertaining the young and poor of the district at Christmas 1722. He may already have been qualified in one regard for the post, being&#151;reputedly&#151;skilled in Old Irish. Less welcome was his treatment of the numerous Presbyterians in the area. He revived the controversy from the 1690s about the validity of marriages performed by Presbyterian ministers when he had some who had been married in this way presented in the ecclesiastical courts for fornication. However, the impact of Fairfax was limited by his premature death, in London, on 27 July 1723. He was unmarried. His short tenure of the deanery also prevented his introducing his architectural tastes into Downpatrick. The building there, shortly afterwards, of almshouses and a court house in a provincial classical style owed more to the Southwells than to the cultivated dean.<br>
