<span class="headword">Kinnersley,  David John</span>  (1926&#150;2004), <span class="occ">economist and public servant</span>, was born on 28 May 1926 at 83 Southbourne Grove, Westcliff-on-Sea, Essex, the elder child and only son of Arthur Ernest Kinnersley (1885&#150;1953), auctioneer and estate agent, and his second wife, Doris Muriel, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Angier (1902&#150;1982), hospital almoner. He had a younger sister, Gay, and an older half-brother from his father's first marriage. He was educated at Westcliff high school and the Herbert Strutt Grammar School in Belper, Derbyshire, where he was evacuated happily during the Second World War to two spinster sisters who encouraged his academic ambitions and with whom, typically, he kept in touch for the rest of their lives. Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, followed in 1944&#150;5. He read law for one year before his degree was interrupted by national service from 1945 until 1948. On returning to Cambridge he switched to economics, graduating with a double first in 1950. On 22 July 1950 he married, at Christ Church, Rossett, Denbighshire, Barbara Adele Fair (<i>b</i>. 1927), personnel manager, and later social worker, and daughter of William Fair, farmer. They had three children, Clare Victoria, Paul Richard, and Jane Fidelia, to whom, along with his granddaughter Anna, he dedicated his first book with the phrase &#145;May the rivers keep sparkling for them far into the future&#146;.<br>
<br>After graduating Kinnersley decided on a career in the public sector and joined the National Coal Board (NCB). The NCB's economic adviser, Fritz Schumacher, was an important influence, and was later to challenge orthodox economic thinking with his book <span class="italic">Small is Beautiful</span> (1973). In 1958 Kinnersley moved to the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority as administrative manager, Risley, Derbyshire, before joining the British Waterways Board in 1964 as deputy general manager, then general manager. He was director of the Association of River Authorities in 1970&#150;73, and following a major reorganization of the water industry of England and Wales into multifunctional regional water authorities based on river basins he became, in 1973, the first chief executive of the North West Water Authority. After a turbulent period at the helm he left to become senior economic adviser to the National Water Council (1976&#150;83), where he advocated the adoption of economic principles, especially &#145;polluter pays&#146; charging and metering of water supplies.<br>
<br>Kinnersley attended the preparatory meeting for the United Nations' &#145;world water decade&#146; (1981&#150;90) in New York, and subsequently organized a conference in Britain entitled &#145;Thirsty third world&#146; in 1980. This conference inspired Kinnersley's and others' commitment to contribute directly to solving the problem that 2 billion people in the world did not have access to clean water. He found a small group of six like minds who set up WaterAid by trust deed in July 1981, with himself as unpaid &#145;administrator for the time being&#146; until they appointed its highly respected first director, David Collett. The charity was conceived as having a unique focus on water and sanitation for the poor. Kinnersley was patient and skilful in working behind the scenes to influence key figures to support WaterAid, and the charity was gradually embraced by the whole water industry. This base of support expanded to engage the general public, which enabled WaterAid, working with local partners, to assist nearly 8 million people with the provision of water and sanitation by the time of Kinnersley's death. Kinnersley was active as a trustee until 1997 and, with others, emphasized the philosophy that community involvement and ultimate responsibility for the adoption of appropriate intermediate technologies (as advocated by Schumacher) were essential if projects were to be sustainable in the long term.<br>
<br>In 1983 Kinnersley returned to academic life as a research fellow at Nuffield College, Oxford, and then in 1985&#150;6 as fellow and bursar of Mansfield College, Oxford. He also acted as adviser to the World Bank and governments worldwide on water management. He was in the mid- to late 1980s influential in the conception and establishment of a National Rivers Authority as a precursor to the privatization of the water and sewerage companies, and became adviser to Nicholas Ridley, secretary of state for the environment, in fleshing out these proposals. His book <span class="italic">Troubled Water</span> (1988) explained his philosophy of the unique nature of water as a resource that cannot be owned but must be shared by communities with appropriate mechanisms to resolve conflicts of interest. <span class="italic">Coming Clean</span> (1994) was written after the privatization of the UK's water and sewerage companies in 1989, which had led to the reversal of the decline of capital expenditure on water and sewerage infrastructure, about which he had been so critical in his first book. But he saw that there were bigger environmental issues on the horizon, and in his final paragraph wrote that:<blockquote>For all the technological skills and capital wealth of our age, the sharing of good quality water can no longer depend on yet more or better technological fixes. We have to effect a transformation in our economic and social institutions&#151;one that reflects the dynamics of the natural environment&#151;however long this may take. (<span class="italic">Coming Clean</span>, 211)</blockquote>Intellectually formidable, Kinnersley was nevertheless known for his sociability, sense of humour, and frequent acts of kindness. He maintained an extensive correspondence throughout his life, and had a particular rapport with children, whom he entertained with stories, jokes, and games of his own devising. Despite a stroke in 1994 he continued to inspire and encourage his WaterAid colleagues, and to take a keen interest in literature and art. He died on 2 December 2004 at his home, 111 Church Street, Chesham, Buckinghamshire, of heart failure, and was cremated at Amersham crematorium before a service at St Mary's Church, Chesham, on 13 December. He was survived by his wife, Barbara, and their three children.<br>
