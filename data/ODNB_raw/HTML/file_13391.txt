<span class="headword">Hobart, Sir  Henry</span>, first baronet  (<em>c.</em>1554&#150;1625), <span class="occ">lawyer and judge</span>, was the second son of Thomas Hobart (1522/3&#150;1560) of Plumstead, Norfolk, and his wife, Audrey (<i>d</i>. 1580), daughter of William Hare of Beeston, Norfolk. He was the great-grandson of Sir James Hobart, attorney-general to Henry VII. Hobart was admitted to Peterhouse, Cambridge, in 1570, and after studying at Furnival's Inn he entered Lincoln's Inn on 30 July 1575, and was called to the bar on 24 June 1584. Hobart was appointed counsel for Great Yarmouth in October 1586, and by 1590 he was made under-steward to Lord Burghley. It was probably Burghley who secured his return to parliament in 1589 for the Cornish borough of St Ives.<br>
<br>On 20 April 1590 Hobart made a settlement on his marriage (the actual marriage was variously reported as on 21, 22, or 29 April) to Dorothy (<i>bap</i>. 1572, <i>d</i>. 1641), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2023/', "Robert Bell")</script> of Beaupr&eacute; Hall, Norfolk, the chief baron of the exchequer. They had twelve sons and four daughters, eight sons and two daughters surviving him. By the early 1590s, when he became a Norfolk JP, Hobart was becoming established in local county society. In 1592 he became a freeman of Norwich; he was appointed counsel for King's Lynn in 1594, and became steward of Norwich in 1595. He was made a bencher of Lincoln's Inn in 1596, the same year that he purchased Intwood in Norfolk. In 1597 he was returned to parliament for Great Yarmouth, sitting on the committee of privileges and returns, and successfully defending the port's interests against those of its rival, Lowestoft. He was again elected for Great Yarmouth in 1601, again sitting on the committee of privileges and returns and on the parliament's main business committee. He was made a serjeant-at-law in May 1603, his patrons being the earl of Kent and the judges Francis Gawdy and George Kingswell, and gave the reading at Lincoln's Inn on 27 Eliz. I c.4 (fraudulent conveyance). He was knighted on 23 July 1603. In 1604 he was returned to parliament for Norwich, being appointed to many committees and playing a role in the attack on Bishop Thornborough of Bristol for discussing in a book the debate of the House of Commons on union with Scotland. He was a union commissioner in 1604&#150;6.<br>
<br>On 2 November 1605 Hobart was discharged from the coif upon his appointment as attorney of the court of wards and liveries, an office he owed to Robert Cecil, earl of Salisbury. In 1606, as a government spokesman in the Commons, he responded to the Gunpowder Plot, supported the king's prerogative in the controversy over purveyance, and supported a grant of supply to pay Queen Elizabeth's debts and to improve the state of the coinage. On 4 July 1606 he was appointed attorney-general, much to the chagrin of Sir Francis Bacon. Controversy attended his continuance as an MP, as in his capacity as attorney-general he had been summoned as an assistant to the House of Lords, and there were no precedents for an attorney-general to continue to sit in the lower house. The matter was debated inconclusively on 22 November 1606, and eventually settled when Hobart accompanied the speaker into the chamber and took his seat on 24 November. He then became heavily involved in the legislative business of the Commons. In his capacity as attorney-general in 1608 he appeared for the plaintiff, Robert Calvin, in the case of the post-nati. He was named a commissioner of ecclesiastical causes in 1608, and appointed to the committee of the Virginia Company in 1609. In the 1610 session of parliament he was the principal government spokesman on the great contract and supply, supporting the king's right to impositions. He also led the attack on Dr Cowell's book <span class="italic">The Interpreter</span>, speaking at a conference with the Lords in May 1610. On 11 May 1611 Hobart was created a baronet, one of the first to receive that honour. In the summer of 1611 he was reported to be seriously ill, but subsequently recovered. In 1612 Hobart became chancellor to Henry, prince of Wales. Following the death of Salisbury in May 1612, he was one of the few mourners at the earl's funeral. Also in 1612 he became a commissioner on the enfranchisement of copyholders and a member of the North West Passage Company. On 26 November 1613 he was appointed chief justice of common pleas, but he was not always regarded as amenable to the court. In 1615, when James I wished to secure the conviction of Edmund Pearson on the western circuit, Hobart was dispatched on the home circuit instead. In November 1616 Hobart purchased the manor of Blickling, Norfolk. On 1 September 1617 he leased part of his house at Blickling, plus the outbuildings and 201 acres, for six years at &pound;110 p.a., presumably to provide some income from the estate while he embarked upon an extensive building programme. Between February 1618 and April 1622 Hobart spent over &pound;6500 on Blickling, and work still continued after his death. Another outlet for Hobart's surplus cash was the East India Company, of which he became a member in 1617.<br>
<br>Hobart's appointment as chief justice was revoked on 1 April 1617, with a fresh appointment dated 2 April to make allowance for the fact that he was now also chancellor to Charles, prince of Wales. On the bench Hobart opposed the draconian fine which Sir Edward Coke wished to impose on the earl of Suffolk in 1619, following his dismissal as lord treasurer. In 1619 he was named to a commission on the relief of the poor. In 1621 Hobart was one of the commissioners who found in favour of Archbishop Abbot following the accidental death of a gamekeeper who had been killed by a cross-bow shot from Abbot during a hunt. Hobart was reappointed a judge on 29 March 1625, following the accession of Charles I. Hobart's death was variously reported to have taken place on 26, 28, or 29 December 1625, the latter date appearing to be the most likely.<br>
<br>According to Judge Jenkins: &#145;in Hobart were many noble things, an excellent eloquence, the &eacute;clat of ancestry, the most engaging sweetness animated with a singular gravity&#146;  (<span class="italic">Lothian MSS</span>, viii). Hobart was buried on 4 January 1626 at Blickling. He left houses at Highgate and St Bartholomew's in London, and Chapel in the Fields, Norwich. He was succeeded by his son John, the second baronet. Hobart's widow was buried at Blickling on 30 April 1641. In 1641 a volume of his law reports was published, with subsequent editions in 1650, 1671, 1678, and 1724.<br>
