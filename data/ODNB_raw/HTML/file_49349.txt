<span class="headword">Ryland,  Arthur</span>  (1807&#150;1877), <span class="occ">lawyer and local politician</span>, was born on 23 August 1807 at Edgbaston, Birmingham, the fifth of six children of John Ryland, wire manufacturer. After attending the Revd D. N. Walton's School in Cherry Street, Birmingham, and a spell in his father's business, he was articled to William Palmer in 1823. On admission in 1828 he practised alone and with his elder brother Timothy, before entering into partnership with Thomas Martineau in 1851. He was married twice. His first wife, and mother of his daughter, Frances, was the daughter of Thomas Tyndall. After her death he married his cousin Anna Smith Phipson.<br>
<br>Ryland belonged to an old Unitarian Birmingham family which had long held a leading position in the town. He occupied a prominent place in the public life of Birmingham from the 1840s to the 1870s. His public role was shaped by his religious beliefs, family influence, occupation, and professional ideology. He quickly built up a successful practice, attracting work from private clients, companies, and public bodies. He held several important legal appointments, such as clerk to the justices and clerk to the guardians of the assay office. In 1852 he published a treatise on the law relating to the assay of precious metals. Questions of law reform also occupied his time. Ryland was active in local and national professional organizations and played an important part in their development. In 1831 he founded the Birmingham Law Library Society. He was president of the Birmingham Law Society in 1873 and again in 1876. He was influential in the creation of the Metropolitan and Provincial Law Association, and in 1863 was the first provincial solicitor elected to the council of the Incorporated Law Society, London.<br>
<br>Ryland's professional training and acumen, wide social circle, reforming zeal, and personal beliefs made him the ideal &#145;committee man&#146;. He had firm views on the duty owed by professionals, especially solicitors, to devote their skills and knowledge freely to the service of the community. These views found their most concrete expression in an address to the Birmingham Law Students' Society in 1861.<br>
<br>Ryland was a staunch Liberal, being connected with the Political Union, the incorporation movement in the 1830s, and the agitation that saw the town council replace the older, oligarchic municipal bodies in 1851. He first entered the council in 1854 at a time when it was dominated by the parsimonious &#145;economist&#146; party. Ryland orchestrated a campaign both within and outside the council to change the nature of municipal government. He remained on the council until 1874 (as mayor in 1860 and alderman from 1861) and made a large contribution to establishing the basis from which Joseph Chamberlain could build the &#145;civic gospel&#146;.<br>
<br>Ryland was instrumental in the foundation, administration, and support of numerous local charities and institutions. His major achievement was the establishment in 1853 of the Birmingham and Midland Institute to rectify the dearth of adult education facilities and literary culture in Birmingham. The plan drew widespread support, including that of Charles Dickens, who performed the first public readings of <span class="italic">A Christmas Carol</span> to raise funds.<br>
<br>Ryland began to retire from public life in 1874. He left Edgbaston and built a house near Bromsgrove, Worcestershire. Although in bad health he took a holiday at Cannes, France, where he died on 24 March 1877 as the result of inflammation of the lungs. He was buried at Cannes.<br>
