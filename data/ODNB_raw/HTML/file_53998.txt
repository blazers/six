<span class="headword">Gillies,  William</span>  (1884&#150;1958), <span class="occ">political organizer</span>, was born on 5 December 1884 at 79 Grove Street, Glasgow, the fourth of six children of James Gillies (<i>b</i>. 1839), journeyman marble cutter, and his wife, Agnes Wilson (1852&#150;1943). He received elementary education and started his political career with the Glasgow Fabians. He was briefly secretary to this group in 1910, organizing a meeting at which one of the speakers was the leading Fabian Sidney Webb.<br>
<br>Gillies joined the Labour Party research staff in 1912. His position gave him exemption from service in the First World War, and he rose to the secretaryship of the information bureau. On the creation of an international department in January 1922, he was appointed its head, at a salary of &pound;525 p.a., to serve both the Labour Party and, until 1925, the Trades Union Congress. He was also a member of the Labour Party international and imperial advisory committees, both of which reported to the international department. Collating information from these sources, and from the Labour and Socialist International, he reported directly to the national executive committee of the Labour Party. His expertise was reflected in his membership of the committee of the Royal Institute of International Affairs, Chatham House.<br>
<br>The successful re-formation of the Second International was the basis for Gillies's powerful position in the Labour Party. When in the research department, he helped with arrangements for convening the rump of the International, which had collapsed during the First World War. He was present with Arthur Henderson at the conference in Hamburg in May 1923, which was the occasion for the International's re-formation and its acquisition of the title Labour and Socialist International. The British Labour Party provided its secretariat and formed its administrative committee, to which Gillies was co-opted. When the Labour and Socialist International moved to Switzerland in 1925, he became the most regular British delegate, and was often the only one. He was appointed in 1929 to the International's executive committee and in 1930 to its bureau, the major decision-making forum. He consolidated his position at the International through alliance with its &#145;Scandinavian&#146;, anti-communist wing and became a leading opponent of collaboration with the Third, Communist, International, which was the policy of the &#145;Latin&#146; wing. Gillies was strongly in favour of armed resistance to fascism, while central European affiliates preferred neutrality. A member of the International Socialist Committee for Labour Palestine, he propounded the British Labour Party's pro-Zionist position in opposition to the secretary of the International, Friedrich Adler. Gillies's championship of these various causes meant that he was viewed as obstructive, but he never departed from British Labour Party policy.<br>
<br>Gillies had been a founder member of the 1917 Club formed to &#145;Hail the Russian Revolution&#146;, but his experience of Third International activities in Europe fostered a virulent anti-communism. He blamed German communists for weakening German social democracy and coined the term &#145;communazis&#146; to express their culpability. Communist international ancillary, or &#145;front&#146;, organizations, purporting to have political neutrality, were his especial <i>b&ecirc;tes noires</i>, and he built a huge collection of information on such bodies. This collection resulted in the publication in 1933 of <span class="italic">The Communist Solar System</span>; its authorship is open to doubt, but it may be judged a team effort to which Gillies substantially contributed. His work here led him to identify the organizations which he suggested, often successfully, for proscription by the Labour Party at its annual conference.<br>
<br>In the 1930s Gillies's work with refugees increased. He was helpful in making cases for immigration and in arranging payment for articles in labour movement periodicals. His single most dramatic act was to help with the evacuation of refugees from Prague in March 1939, when the German invasion was under way. As a member of the Workers' Travel Association, whose activities included running cruise ships, plus excursion trains in Czechoslovakia, he was in a position to make an ambitious programme of refugee evacuation.<br>
<br>As well as to <span class="italic">The Communist Solar System</span>, Gillies contributed to Labour Party publications on international affairs and produced <span class="italic">International Service</span>, a brief account of Labour and Socialist International activities, and <span class="roman">Aids for Study in International Relations</span>, a series of annotated bibliographies for local Labour parties.<br>
<br>The final stages of Gillies's career were unhappy. His memoranda about the future of Germany, expressing scepticism about the possibility of rebuilding social democracy there, offended German Social Democrats in exile and, with his judgement rendered suspect, he took early retirement in 1944. His ill temper was as legendary as his expertise. Denis Healey, who succeeded him as international secretary, remembered him as &#145;a cantankerous Scot who distrusted foreigners and hated all Germans&#146;  (D. Healey, <span class="italic">The Time of my Life</span>, 1990, 57). However, Gillies's assistant, Christine Howie, worked for him from 1922 until her retirement. Gillies joined the Transport House (Labour Party and Trades Union Congress headquarters) social club and was admired by the leader of the Transport and General Workers' Union (and later Foreign Secretary) Ernest Bevin.<br>
<br>Gillies remained unmarried; he was close to his younger sister Agnes, and lived with his mother. He enjoyed walking tours and claimed to drink the juice of three oranges daily. Photographs show him as a short man; in 1918 Beatrice Webb referred to him as &#145;that little dwarf Gillies&#146; and summarized his character as &#145;an honest, oversensitive and obstinate minded but well informed little Glaswegian Fabian&#146;  (N. Mackenzie and J. Mackenzie, eds., <span class="italic">The Diary of Beatrice Webb</span>, 1983, 326). Gillies died on 26 January 1958, from pneumonia, influenza, and generalized atheroma, at his home, 113 Bourne Way, Beckenham, Kent.<br>
