<span class="headword">Thomson,  James</span>  (1822&#150;1892), <span class="occ">mechanical engineer</span>, was born on 16 February 1822 in College Square, Belfast, the third among the seven children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27307/', "James Thomson (1786&#150;1849)")</script>, professor of mathematics, and his wife, Margaret (<i>d</i>. 1830), daughter of William Gardner, a merchant in Glasgow. His father was an Ulsterman and his mother a Scot. His younger brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36507/', "William Thomson (1824&#150;1907)")</script> later became Baron Kelvin of Largs. After his wife's death in 1830, James Thomson senior chose to educate his family largely at home even after being appointed to the mathematics chair at Glasgow College in 1832. Having informally attended the junior mathematical class for two years, James matriculated in 1834, took his BA in 1839, and at the close of the 1840 session graduated MA with honours in mathematics and natural philosophy.<br>
<br>From the age of fourteen James displayed a passionate interest in practical engineering. Even his earliest inventions shared a concern to minimize waste of useful work and to maximize economy of operation. Noting how the paddles of Clyde steamers &#145;wasted&#146; power in lifting water prompted him in 1836 to devise a self-adjusting paddle blade which would minimize such losses of useful work. The efficient production of motive power from fluid flow was a central theme of his engineering career.<br>
<br>Following an educational tour of Germany in 1840, Thomson entered the Dublin office of the engineer John MacNeill, but a knee injury sustained while walking in the Black Forest forced him home after only three weeks. During the early months of 1841 he spent some hours each day studying practical engineering at the Lancefield Spinning Mills in Glasgow, then acquired further practical experience before entering the Horsely Iron Works, Tipton, Staffordshire, early in 1843 as a pupil in the drawing office. By August he had become a premium apprentice (his father having paid &pound;100 as his fee) at the Millwall shipbuilding and marine engineering works of William Fairbairn, then in the forefront of the new ocean-going iron steamship technology.<br>
<br>At Millwall, Thomson studied the theoretical and practical problems of economy in relation to long-distance steam navigation. By August 1844 he had encountered the relatively unfamiliar theory of the motive power of heat (due to Sadi Carnot and &Eacute;mile Clapeyron) which set theoretical limits to the perfection of heat engines. Working closely with his brother William, he used Carnot's theory to predict the effect of pressure in lowering the freezing point of water, a prediction for which William soon claimed experimental confirmation. The results were presented to the Royal Society of Edinburgh in January 1849. Over the next few years Carnot's theory was transformed into the new sciences of thermodynamics and energy. In 1857 Thomson used the principle of liquefaction by pressure as the basis for an explanation of the &#145;plasticity of ice&#146;, observed by Professor J. D. Forbes during extensive investigations of glacier motion.<br>
<br>Upon his transfer to Fairbairn's Manchester works in October 1844, Thomson's health, never robust, broke down and he returned to Glasgow. For the next five years he based himself in the college, moving in Glasgow Philosophical Society circles and benefiting from the friendship of Lewis Gordon, first professor of engineering in the university. Gordon's familiarity with French horizontal water-wheels or water turbines encouraged Thomson to construct his own model, first tested in the spring of 1847 and finally patented on 3 July 1850 (no. 13156). Messrs Williamson Bros. of Kendal became the principal manufacturers. One such turbine, installed in a mill at Gayle in Upper Wensleydale about 1878, apparently ran for ninety-six years without requiring repair  (<span class="italic">The Independent</span>).<br>
<br>Thomson's patent involved the injection of high-pressure water at the same speed as, and in a spiral motion towards the outside of, the horizontal wheel. The water gradually transferred its energy to the wheel as it moved along vanes curving from radial to tangential and finally passed down a central drain. The guiding principle was to keep any given portion of the water as close as possible to a state of equilibrium while it moved from high to low pressure and so to minimize waste in the extraction of useful work. In contrast, French designs tended either (in the case of Fourneyron) to introduce water from the centre or (in the case of Poncelet) to transfer the kinetic energy of fast-flowing water to the wheel by redirecting it from tangential to radial along curved vanes. Thomson claimed efficiencies of 75 per cent, equal to the best conventional overshot water-wheels and superior to French water turbines.<br>
<br>After his father's death in 1849 Thomson worked with Gordon in London, then returned in 1851 to Belfast, where he opened an office for civil engineering practice. On 28 December 1853 he married Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1892), daughter of the Irish poor-law commissioner William John Hancock and sister of Neilson Hancock, professor of jurisprudence and political economy in Queen's College, Belfast. The Thomsons had two daughters and one son. By 1854 Thomson had become acting professor of engineering in Queen's. Three years later he was appointed to the chair that he retained until he succeeded Rankine as professor of engineering at Glasgow in 1873.<br>
<br>In Belfast, Thomson's new concern was with centrifugal pumps. Conventional designs lost as much as half of the driving power in expelling water from their circumference with a rotational velocity which was then wasted as friction in the discharge pipe. Thomson added a second &#145;whirlpool&#146; chamber which permitted conversion of the tangential velocity into increased water pressure capable of raising the water to a greater height at discharge. Efficiencies rose from below 50 per cent to about 70 per cent. As with his turbine, the guiding principle was to maintain approximate equilibrium between neighbouring portions of the vortex, which he subsequently named the &#145;whirlpool or vortex of equal energies&#146; or &#145;vortex of free mobility&#146;. In his own words,<blockquote>a duck could swim from place to place without expenditure of energy in like manner as in still water: Also that a fish in the interior of any whirlpool, except one of Free Mobility, would require a real finite quantity of energy in order to move from place to place. (Smith and Wise, 417)</blockquote>Thomson also devised a &#145;jet pump&#146; whereby a jet of water created a suction capable of raising water. A subsequent project, requiring a series of jet pumps, aimed to transform waste swamps into productive land. Related projects of public utility included service as engineer to the Belfast water commissioners (when pumping steam engines supplying water to the expanding town were erected under his charge), a scheme for the promotion of public parks in large towns, and superintending the construction of a flood sluice weir on the River Lagan navigation system between Belfast and Lough Neagh.<br>
<br>Departing from his family's liberal Presbyterianism, but consistent with his devotion to causes of &#145;practical improvement&#146; and &#145;rational reform&#146;, Thomson became a Unitarian. Professing belief in &#145;one God the Creator, the Preserver, and Governor of all other beings&#146;, he denied revelation other than through the works of nature and in the ideas implanted by God in the human mind. In politics James and William Thomson shared a powerful devotion to liberal causes but parted from the Liberals over Gladstone's espousal of Irish home rule. James's character, and his relationship with his more famous younger brother, was summed up by Hermann Helmholtz in 1863:<blockquote>[James] is a level-headed fellow, full of good ideas, but cares for nothing except engineering, and talks about it ceaselessly all day and all night, so that nothing else can be got in when he is present. It is really comic to see how the two brothers talk at one another, and neither listens, and each holds forth about quite different matters. But the engineer is the most stubborn, and generally gets through with his subject. (Smith and Wise, 283)</blockquote>Thomson received an honorary degree of DSc from Queen's University in 1875 and that of LLD from Glasgow University in 1870 and from Dublin in 1878. He was elected fellow of the Royal Society in 1877. He was president of the Belfast Literary Society in 1864&#150;5, president of the mechanical section of the British Association in 1874, and president of the Institution of Engineers and Shipbuilders in Scotland in 1884 and 1885. Serious eyesight problems led him to resign the Glasgow chair in 1889. He died at his home, 2 Florentine Gardens, Hillhead Street, Glasgow, on 8 May 1892, followed within a week by his wife and younger daughter.<br>
