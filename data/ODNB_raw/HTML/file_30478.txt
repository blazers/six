<span class="headword">Aslin,  Charles Herbert</span>  (1893&#150;1959), <span class="occ">architect</span>, was born at 34 Burnell Road, Owlerton, Ecclesfield, Yorkshire, on 15 December 1893, the younger of two sons of Arthur William Aslin and his wife, Louisa Annie Outram. His parents were originally from Lincolnshire and Derbyshire, but by the time of Aslin's birth his father was foreman in a Sheffield steelworks. After leaving Sheffield central school he was articled in 1910 to a local architect, and also studied part-time in the department of architecture at Sheffield University. At the outbreak of war in 1914, Aslin volunteered for the infantry but was rejected because of defective vision. Following a period in the Army Pay Corps and the Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire light infantry, he was commissioned in the Royal Artillery in 1916. He served as a captain with a field regiment on the western front until 1919.<br>
<br>On returning to Sheffield, Aslin worked on the staff of the city architect. In 1922 he was appointed architect to the borough engineer of Rotherham, where he designed new municipal offices. Architectural careers in local government were opening up at this time; moving up the ladder, Aslin became deputy county architect for Hampshire in 1926 and borough architect for Derby in 1929, where he demonstrated the drive that was to carry him to the top of his profession. His &#145;central improvement scheme&#146; for Derby, comprising council offices, police courts, bus station, open market, riverside gardens, and a bridge, provided for the replanning of a key area of the city along the Derwent. The stringencies of the 1930s prevented much of this from being carried through, nor was the style of Aslin's proposed and executed buildings noteworthy. But the authority and ambition of the scheme enhanced his reputation.<br>
<br>In 1945 Aslin was appointed as Hertfordshire's first county architect. His new department's chief responsibility was for school-building, following the <span class="roman">Education Act</span> of 1944. It was then becoming clear that the post-war demand for schools would be beyond the capacity of the building industry, which had been depleted by wartime labour shortages, was committed to essential tasks of repairing war damage, and needed to provide new housing to cater for the shift in population. In no part of the country were these problems more acute than Hertfordshire, which had grown fast between the wars and was now to be the location of fresh communities created under the <span class="roman">New Towns Act</span> of 1946 and the London county council's overspill policies. On the advice of the Ministry of Education and with a shrewdly appointed deputy, Stirrat Johnson-Marshall, Aslin encouraged his staff in promoting and developing an in-house system of construction for primary schools which would make full but flexible use of prefabricated components and so relieve the strain on traditional builders. His leadership and loyalty were crucial in securing the backing of the county council and fellow officials, notably the county education officer, John Newsom, for this bold innovation.<br>
<br>The system proved outstandingly successful and soon attracted notice. The Hertfordshire primary schools became places of pilgrimage for architects from all over the world. Existing educational values were challenged; new technical, costing, and administrative procedures were adopted; and a new aesthetic evolved using space, light, colour, and furniture to create a fresh kind of school environment. By 1955 Hertfordshire had built over a hundred schools and, following Johnson-Marshall's early promotion to the Ministry of Education, the county's methods had been adopted by leading authorities throughout the country. Aslin's role as team leader and &#145;umbrella man&#146; was to appoint and welcome some of the brightest young architects of the day on his staff, support them, and generously acknowledge their contribution. In 1951 he received the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA) bronze medal in recognition of the pioneering architecture of the Hertfordshire schools.<br>
<br>Aslin was also important in the counsels of the RIBA. He was elected associate in 1920 and fellow in 1932, first served on the council of the RIBA in 1941&#150;3, and was regularly a council member thereafter. As chairman of the official architects committee, he helped to heal a breach that had developed between architects in private practice and the growing number in salaried posts, notably in local government, who were dissatisfied with their conditions of service. In 1948&#150;50 and 1952&#150;4 he acted as a vice-president and in 1954&#150;6 as president of the RIBA. His presidency coincided with the end of building licensing and inaugurated a more confident and optimistic mood among architects, buoyed up by his personality. Appointed CBE in 1951, he was also an associate of the Institution of Structural Engineers, a member of the Royal Society of Arts, and an honorary fellow of the American Institute of Architects.<br>
<br>Respected for his kindness and wisdom, Aslin made friends easily and was at ease with people of differing age, background, race, and temperament. Coupled with his charm he retained a Yorkshire shrewdness and strength, enabling him to adopt a firm stand when he thought it necessary. At Hertfordshire he was committed to the collective vision and methodology of his department, but reacted sharply when left-wing architects sought equality of pay and abolition of hierarchies. He detested pomposity and pretension. Throughout his career he was encouraged and supported by his wife, Ethel Fawcett (<i>b</i>. 1895/6), a domestic science teacher, also from Sheffield, the daughter of Joseph Armitage, a butcher, whom he married on 30 October 1920; the Aslins were consistently helpful and hospitable to others. Outside architecture, Aslin played a good game of tennis, was interested in cricket, enjoyed the theatre, photographed well, read widely, and supported numerous societies. During the Second World War he did much to foster Anglo-Polish relations. Brought up as a strict nonconformist, he later embraced the Church of England.<br>
<br>Aslin had a narrow escape from death during a visit to Staffordshire in 1955 on RIBA business, when his bedroom filled with gas owing to a fractured main. He was seriously ill and it is doubtful whether he ever completely recovered his previous robust health. He retired from Hertfordshire in 1958, died at home at New Place, Queens Road, Hertford, on 18 April 1959, and was buried at St Mary's Church, North Mymms.<br>
<br>The Aslins' only child, <a name="cosubject_63945"></a><span class="headword">Elizabeth Mary Aslin</span>  (1923&#150;1989), <span class="occ">art historian and administrator</span>, was born on 23 March 1923 at 33 Collegiate Crescent, Broomhall, Sheffield. She attended the Slade School of Art, then the University of London, and became an authority on the Victorian decorative arts and furniture. A gregarious and forceful personality, she made her reputation in the circulation department of the Victoria and Albert Museum, which she joined in 1947. As assistant keeper at the Bethnal Green Museum (1964&#150;8), she transformed the display of dolls and toys and added a strong section on the Victorian decorative arts. She was assistant director at the Victoria and Albert from 1968 to 1974, and then again keeper at Bethnal Green between 1974 and 1981. Her books include <span class="italic">Nineteenth Century English Furniture</span> (1962) and <span class="italic">The Aesthetic Movement</span> (1969). She died, unmarried, on 14 April 1989 at 52 Dyke Road Avenue, Brighton.<br>
