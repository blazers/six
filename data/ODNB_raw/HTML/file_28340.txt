<span class="headword">Vivian,  Hussey Crespigny</span>, third Baron Vivian  (1834&#150;1893), <span class="occ">diplomatist</span>, born in Connaught Place, London, on 19 June 1834, was the eldest son of Charles Crespigny Vivian, second Baron Vivian, and his first wife, Arabella (<i>d</i>. 1837), daughter of John Middleton Scott of Ballygannon, co. Wicklow.<br>
<br>The father, <a name="cosubject_28338"></a><span class="headword">Charles Crespigny Vivian</span>, second Baron Vivian  (1808&#150;1886)<span class="occ"></span>, son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28341/', "Richard Hussey Vivian, first Baron Vivian (1775&#150;1842)")</script>, and his first wife, Eliza Champion de Crespigny (<i>d</i>. 1831), was born at Truro on 24 December 1808, and educated at Eton College. He became cornet in the 7th hussars in 1825, and was subsequently promoted lieutenant (1826), captain (1829), and major (12 August 1834), after which he retired. He represented Bodmin in parliament from 1835 to 1842, when he succeeded to the title. He was appointed special deputy warden of the stannaries in 1852 and lord lieutenant of Cornwall in 1856, resigning the latter office in 1877. He died at Ventnor on 24 April 1886 and was buried at Glynn, leaving six sons and three daughters by his two wives: Arabella, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Scott, whom he married on 2 July 1833 and who died on 26 January 1837, and Mary Elizabeth, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Panton, whom he married on 21 September 1841. Tall, with a large nose and a monocle, he was known as &#145;Hook and Eye&#146;. His widow died aged eighty-two on 23 January 1907.<br>
<br>Also educated at Eton College, the eldest son, Hussey Vivian, was appointed a clerk in the Foreign Office on 18 November 1851. He was attached to several important special missions, accompanying the earl of Clarendon to Paris in 1856 and the earl of Breadalbane to Berlin in 1861. In 1864 he was sent to Athens with the draft treaty for the annexation of the Ionian Islands to Greece. He became senior clerk in the Foreign Office on 3 July 1869. In 1873 he was appointed acting agent and consul-general at Alexandria, and the following year was transferred to Bucharest. He was again appointed to Egypt in 1876; while there he was made CB.<br>
<br>Vivian was appointed resident minister to the Swiss confederation in 1879, and two years afterwards was raised to the rank of envoy-extraordinary and minister-plenipotentiary to Denmark. He was sent to Brussels with the same rank in 1884, and during his time there was made KCMG. He succeeded to his father's title on 24 April 1886 and was politically a Liberal. He was appointed British plenipotentiary to the slave-trade conference held at Brussels in 1889, and for his services was made GCMG. On 1 January 1892 he was appointed ambassador in Rome, where he remained until his death, from pneumonia, at the British embassy on 21 October 1893. At his funeral in Rome on the 25th the prince of Naples followed on foot with Lord Vivian's son.<br>
<br>Vivian was a conscientious but not a brilliant diplomatist. &#145;He was certainly much fonder of horses than of chanceries &hellip; but he was a man who could always be relied on in an emergency&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 23 Oct 1893). He was elected a fellow of the Royal Geographical Society in 1872. He married, on 8 June 1876, Louisa Alice (<i>d</i>. 3 April 1926), daughter of Robert George Duff of Ryde; they had three daughters and one son, George, who succeeded to the title. Their daughter Dorothy Maud (<i>d</i>. 1939) was maid of honour to Queen Victoria and Queen Alexandra and in 1905 married Douglas Haig (1861&#150;1928), later first Earl Haig.<br>
