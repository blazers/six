<span class="headword">Markham,  John</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1409), <span class="occ">justice</span>, came of a family which traced its origins back to the twelfth century and was established at East Markham, near Retford, Nottinghamshire. His father was Robert Markham, who may have been a serjeant-at-law under Edward III, and his mother a daughter of Sir John Caunton. Markham became a king's serjeant in January 1383. He was made a justice of the common pleas on 7 July 1396, and sat on the bench until February 1408. He was chosen as one of the triers of petitions in the two parliaments of 1397, and in those of Henry IV, from 1401 to 1407. From the early 1380s he served as justice of assize and gaol delivery on the northern circuit and was a justice of the peace in Nottinghamshire and elsewhere. He was retained as counsel by Henry, earl of Derby, 1391&#150;5, and also by the dean and chapter of Lincoln between about 1389 and 1396. He received a pension from Durham Priory, 1395&#150;6. In 1395 he bought the manors of Bothamsall and Upton, both near East Markham.<br>
<br>Markham was a member of the commission whose advice Henry of Lancaster took, in September 1399, as to the manner in which the change of dynasty should be carried out, and who on 29 September received Richard's renunciation of the crown in the Tower of London. His name does not appear on the rolls of parliament among those of the seven commissioners who next day pronounced sentence upon Richard in the name of parliament, but Chief Justice Thirning, in announcing the sentence to Richard on behalf of his fellow commissioners on 10 October, enumerated Markham among them. In Henry IV's reign Markham served as a justice of the peace in the eastern counties, and he retired from the bench in Hilary term 1408.<br>
<br>With his first wife, Elizabeth, daughter of Sir John and sister and coheir of Sir Hugh Cressy (<i>d</i>. 1408), of Hodsock, Markham had a son Robert, ancestor of William Markham, archbishop of York (1777&#150;1807), and a second son <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18068/', "John Markham (d. 1479)")</script> who was chief justice of the king's bench, 1461&#150;9. By this marriage he acquired the manors of Risegate and Bratott in Lincolnshire and a moiety of the manor of Melton in Yorkshire. At some time after 1403 he married Millicent (<i>d</i>. 1419), widow of Sir Nicholas Burdon, and daughter and coheir of Sir Thomas Bekeringe. Markham died on 31 December 1409, and was buried in East Markham church, where his monument still remains with the inscription <i>Orate pro anima</i> <i>Johannis Markham</i> <i>justiciarii</i>. His widow later married Sir William Mering.<br>
