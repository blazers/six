<span class="headword">Cook,  Edward Dutton</span>  (1829&#150;1883), <span class="occ">theatre critic and author</span>, was born at 9 Grenville Street, Brunswick Square, London, on 30 January 1829, the second son among at least nine children of George Simon Cook (<i>d</i>. 1852) of Grantham, Lincolnshire, a solicitor of the firm of Le Blanc and Cook of Blackfriars, London, and his wife, Frances Sophia, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Smith. At the age of six he went to a school kept by a Miss Boswell at Haverstock Hill. He moved to another school at Bradmore House, Chiswick, and finally, about 1843, entered King's College School. Having completed his education he was articled to his father, and remained in his office for about four years, after which he found work in the Madras Railway Company's office in New Broad Street in the City. In his spare time he followed his artistic and literary tastes, and as soon as he was able he left the railway company and devoted himself entirely to literature as a profession. Having studied painting under Rolt, and learned engraving, he at one time sought employment on <span class="italic">Punch</span> as a draughtsman on wood. In 1859 he became a member of the Artists' rifle corps and of the Ramblers' Club, which met every night from November to May at Dick's Tavern, Fleet Street. About this period, in conjunction with Leopold Lewis, he wrote a melodrama entitled <span class="italic">The Dove and the Serpent</span>, which was produced with much success, under Nelson Lee's management, at the City of London Theatre.<br>
<br>From 1867 to October 1875 Cook was the theatre critic for the <span class="italic">Pall Mall Gazette</span>, while simultaneously acting as the assistant editor of the <span class="italic">Cornhill Magazine</span> (1868&#150;71). In 1875 he resigned from the <span class="italic">Pall Mall Gazette</span> when some of his articles were tampered with, and was asked by Edmund Yates to become theatre critic for <span class="italic">The World</span> newspaper, a post he held until his death. On 20 August 1874 he married Linda Scates (1854/5&#150;1915), the second daughter of Joseph Scates, a musician. They had met at Gad's Hill Place, at the house of Charles Dickens. She was a pupil of the Royal Academy of Music and a well-known pianist. Soon they had a daughter, whom they named Sylvia after the heroine of Cook's first novel.<br>
<br>Cook was a writer of numerous articles on art topics in various reviews, newspapers, and periodicals, and the author of many works of fiction. Of the latter, <span class="italic">Paul Foster's Daughter</span>, his first work, served to establish his reputation in 1861. Although he remained a prolific writer, with <span class="italic">Hobson's Choice</span>, <span class="italic">Young Mr Nightingale</span>, and many other novels being published regularly, his later novels did not maintain the popularity which his earlier works achieved: his style was not sufficiently sensational to suit the fashion of the period. He was one of the contributors to the <span class="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</span>, and furnished the dramatic and theatrical lives in letter A to the first and second volumes. Most successful were his writings on the theatre, which include <span class="italic">A Book of the Play</span> (1876), <span class="italic">Hours with the Players</span> (two vols., 1881), <span class="italic">Nights at the Play</span>, and <span class="italic">On the Stage</span> (both 1883, the former containing selected articles from his contributions to the <span class="italic">Pall Mall Gazette</span> and <span class="italic">The World</span>, including his notices of early London appearances of Henry Irving and Ellen Terry). Cook died suddenly of syncope, following heart disease, at his home, 69 Gloucester Crescent, on 11 September 1883, and was buried in Highgate cemetery on 15 September.<br>
