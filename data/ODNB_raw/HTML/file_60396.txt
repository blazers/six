<span class="headword">Allison,  John Drummond</span>  (1921&#150;1943), <span class="occ">poet</span>, was born in Caterham, Surrey, on 31 July 1921, the youngest of the four sons of Harry Ashby Allison (1870&#150;1946), a chartered accountant, and his wife, of Austrian descent, Gertrude Jane Mabel Wolfsberger (1877&#150;1961). Baptized Drummond because his mother noted that he had the pugnacious chin of Sapper's popular fictional hero Bulldog Drummond, his boyhood was a happy one. The family home was filled with books and visitors including the author T. H. White. One friend remembers the atmosphere as &#145;utterly Betjeman&#146;  (private information). After attending Downside preparatory school, Purley, he won a scholarship in 1934 to Bishop's Stortford College, a liberal, nonconformist public school, where he flourished: acting, debating, and subscribing to the Left Book Club.<br>
<br>In 1939 Allison won an open exhibition at Queen's College, Oxford, forming productive friendships with Sidney Keyes and John Heath-Stubbs, with whom he founded a salon where other aspiring poets were persuaded to read and discuss their works. Allison contributed to <span class="italic">Eight Oxford Poets</span>, edited by Keyes and Michael Meyer and published by Routledge in 1941, <span class="italic">Poetry from Oxford in Wartime, 1942&#150;3</span> (Basil Blackwell), and <span class="italic">Z: Oxford and Cambridge Writing</span> (John Lehmann, 1942). He gained a second class in the shortened honours school in modern history before moving on to Sandhurst and a commission in the East Surrey regiment. He trained in Plymouth and at the battle school in Northern Ireland, spending his leaves in Oxford and London, where he met Tambimuttu and Dylan Thomas in the Swiss Pub in Soho. He had time to correct the final proofs of his single volume of published poems, <span class="italic">The Yellow Night</span> (Fortune Press, 1944), before being seconded to the West Surreys and embarking for north Africa in October 1943. In November his regiment joined the Fifth Army in Italy and on the night of 2&#150;3 December he was mortally wounded leading a platoon attack against a German machine-gun post on a mountain ridge overlooking the Garigliano River. He was buried in Italy, first in the divisional cemetery at Roccamonfina then in the war cemetery at Minturno, north of Naples, Italy.<br>
<br>Compact of stature, determined, energetic, moving and speaking at high speed, Allison had the appearance of a young James Cagney. Impulsive, ebullient, uninhibited, generous, and ingenuous, he gained the affection of a wide circle of friends, male and female. His poetic themes concerned love and longing and the quest for identity, certainty, and purpose in a world of widespread social and political instability and disillusionment. He also wrote about cricket (the subject of two of his most powerful poems &#145;Verity&#146; and &#145;The Oval&#146;) and of his growing sense of foreboding as the war snatched him from unscathed and enchanted Oxford, forcing him to confront his own mortality. Though his is a raw talent and his poems are often uneven and wilfully obscure, his vocabulary is vibrant and illuminating. His tone is ironic and his language engagingly colloquial, steeped in Arthurian imagery, in political and historical reference, and in his own experience. His mature poems, among them &#145;Love's Milanese&#146;, &#145;The Brass Horse&#146;, &#145;O Sheriffs&#146;, &#145;A Funeral Oration&#146;, &#145;After Lyonesse&#146;, &#145;Yorktown Gate Guard&#146;, and &#145;The Yellow Night&#146;, have found favour in modern anthologies. Allison readily acknowledged his early debt to Swinburne and later to W. H. Auden yet he developed a highly individual and modern style. Echoes of Allison may be found in the early works of Thom Gunn. Though one should not claim too much, there are many who believe that Allison's poetry has stood the test of time better than that of more acclaimed contemporaries. He was, in the words of Ian Hamilton, &#145;perhaps the most absorbed and striking elegist of Auden's &#147;low, dishonest decade&#148;&#146;  (Hamilton, 74).<br>
