<span class="headword">Webb,  Benedict</span>  (<em>b. </em>1563, <em>d.</em> after 1626), <span class="occ">clothier</span>, was the third generation in the trade, following his grandfather, a small clothier (who died in Kingswood, Wiltshire, in 1558), and a father and uncles who were more substantial men, collecting aulnage in Gloucestershire, Wiltshire, and Bristol, exporting undressed cloth, and importing logwood. Benedict worked under his father until he was sixteen; he was then apprenticed to a London linen draper and merchant in the French trade, and went abroad. For four to five years he was in Paris and Rouen, with occasional visits to Italy. He admired the quality of foreign workmanship and noted all new techniques. He had two foreign looms copied, and returned to England, setting up business in Taunton, where in 1589 he experimented with a multicoloured Spanish cloth, called medley, or &#145;Webb's&#146; cloth. In or before 1595, following his father's death, Webb moved to Kingswood to take over the business, married Alice Trobridge, and had many daughters, and one son, Benedict. He traded with France in salt and cloth, and had landed and farming interests in the Vale of Berkeley and the Forest of Dean. His cloth trade encompassed a large annual contract with George Mynne, the London draper, for which he hired 500 additional workers. Webb expected in normal years a clear trading profit of &pound;400, though his contracts with Mynne were the subject of lengthy dispute and actions at law which cost him dearly. He successfully negotiated the repeal of a clause in the statute of 4 &amp; 5 Philip and Mary, c. 5, which seriously prejudiced west-country clothiers' interests  (43 Eliz., c. 10), and was one of three who visited France to persuade the French to repeal, in February 1606, a decree prohibiting the import of English tentered cloth.<br>
<br>This French visit gave Webb the idea of growing rapeseed for oil to dress cloth. He brought the model of a French oil mill to England, and set up a copy at Kingswood in 1605. In 1611 he was consulted by Londoners setting up the Londonderry plantation in Ireland, and showed positive interest in joining an oil-milling venture there. Milling at Kingswood expanded about 1618, and in December 1624 Webb received a fourteen-year patent of monopoly, claiming that he was the first inventor. His design of mill may have been original, but others had long been growing rapeseed in East Anglia and milling rapeseed around London. A lawsuit in 1625 disclosed that Richard Warner, a soap-boiler of Bristol, had a mill in Caerleon, Monmouthshire, and by offering double wages, had secured some of Webb's workers to build it. Webb was then growing at least 550 acres of rapeseed, and milling 20 gallons of oil a day. In 1626 senior west-country clothiers strongly commended Webb's oil, for cheapness, economy, and effectiveness, even on their best quality cloth. Webb, and others, stressed the amount of work he gave to the poor.<br>
<br>Webb was an immodest publicist of his achievements, and amassed wealth but also large debts. Local creditors included his nephew, John Smith or Smyth of Nibley, who preserved Webb's autobiography among his papers. He was still alive in 1626.<br>
