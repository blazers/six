<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Tadema, Sir  Lawrence  Alma-</span>  (1836&#150;1912), <span class="occ">painter</span>, was born Lorenz Alma Tadema on 8 January 1836 in the small village of Dronrijp, in Friesland, the sixth child of Pieter Jiltes Tadema (1797&#150;1840) and Hinke Dirks Brouwer (<i>c</i>.1800&#150;1863).<h2>
<a name="Educationandearlycareer"></a>Education and early career</h2>Although his family had intended the young Lorenz Tadema to pursue a legal career, at fifteen he was diagnosed as consumptive, given only a short time to live, and allowed to spend his remaining days drawing and painting. At sixteen he began a formal art training at the Academy of Art in Antwerp. In 1857 he entered the studio of Louis Jan de Taeye (professor of archaeology at the academy, whose classes in history and historical costume he had attended), where he remained until November 1858. Influenced by his friendships with de Taeye and the Egyptologist Georg Ebers, he first produced work of a historical character on Merovingian and Egyptian subjects. In 1859 he joined the Antwerp studio of Baron Henri Leys, where he completed his first major painting, a Merovingian subject, <span class="italic">The Education of the Children of Clovis</span> (1861; priv. coll.). Although it was criticized by Leys, who compared its depiction of marble to cheese  (Alma-Tadema, 204), it received excellent reviews and was acquired by King Leopold of the Belgians. The young artist soon established a reputation on the continent, and in 1864 <span class="italic">Pastimes in Ancient Egypt</span> (1863; Harris Museum and Art Gallery, Preston) was awarded a gold medal at the Paris Salon and a second-class medal in the Paris Universal Exhibition of 1867.<br>
<br>The years 1863 and 1864 marked a turning point in Alma-Tadema's life and career. On 24 September 1863 he married (Marie) Pauline (1837&#150;1869), the daughter of Eugene Gressin, a French journalist living in Brussels, and that same year made his first trip to Italy. The couple's honeymoon visit to Pompeii coincided with the first systematic excavations of the site and Alma-Tadema, inspired by what he had witnessed, embarked on his first paintings depicting the classical world. From 1865 the representation of Roman life dominated his oeuvre. Set in Pompeian-type interiors characterized by vibrant red walls, these Roman pictures appropriate ancient architecture, decoration, and accessories, as well as Latin literature. A striking example of this type of painting is <span class="italic">Catullus at Lesbia's</span> (1865); set in a richly decorated Pompeian interior, it evokes the famous poem (<span class="roman">Catullus 3</span>) in which the Roman poet Catullus laments the death of his mistress Lesbia's pet sparrow.<br>
<br>Influenced by French n&eacute;o-Grec painters such as Jean-L&eacute;on G&eacute;r&ocirc;me, who significantly altered the treatment of ancient subjects by eschewing the depiction of well-known heroes in favour of scenes of everyday life, Alma-Tadema concentrated on historical genre subjects showing anonymous Romans engaged in ordinary activities. Favoured subjects included courtship rituals (<span class="italic">A Silent Greeting</span>, 1889; Tate collection), bathing (<span class="italic">A Favourite Custom</span>, 1909; Tate collection), dining (<span class="italic">The Dinner</span>, 1873; William Morris Gallery, Walthamstow, London), and the performance of pagan rites (<span class="italic">A Dedication to Bacchus</span>, 1889; Hamburger Kunsthalle).<br>
<br>In 1864 Alma-Tadema secured a lucrative commission from the Belgian art dealer Ernest Gambart for twenty-four pictures; five years later he received a second contract for another forty-eight. Gambart exhibited Alma-Tadema's work at the French Gallery in London with the aim of enhancing the artist's reputation in Britain. By the time that Alma-Tadema exhibited his first works at the Royal Academy, in 1869&#151;<span class="italic">A Roman Art Lover</span> (1868; Glasgow Museums and Art Galleries) and <span class="italic">A Pyrrhic Dance</span> (1869; Guildhall Art Gallery, London)&#151;he was well known in European and British art circles.<br>
<br>Alma-Tadema and his wife, Pauline, had three children: two girls, Laurense and Anna, and a boy who died soon after his birth. In 1869 Pauline died, after years of ill heath. A year later, at the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War, the family moved to London, where Alma-Tadema Anglicized his forename to Lawrence and, in 1873, was granted letters of denization from Queen Victoria. Meanwhile on 29 July 1871 he married his pupil Laura Theresa Epps, youngest daughter of the homoeopathic physician <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8829/', "George Napoleon Epps (1815&#150;1874)")</script> and his wife, Anne Charlotte Bacon (1813&#150;1890). <a name="cosubject_48918"></a><span class="headword">Laura Theresa  Alma-Tadema</span>  (1852&#150;1909) who was born in London on 16 April 1852, became a <span class="occ">painter</span> in her own right. She concentrated on domestic and genre scenes, often in Dutch seventeenth-century settings. Following her death, at Hindhead, Surrey, on 15 August 1909, a memorial exhibition of her work was held at the Fine Art Society in 1910.<h2>
<a name="SuccessinLondon"></a>Success in London</h2>Shortly after moving to Britain Alma-Tadema established himself as a major figure in the Victorian art world, securing election as associate of the Royal Academy in 1876 and as academician only three years later. His first London residence&#151;Townshend House, near Regent's Park&#151;was decorated in an eclectic style incorporating Pompeian, Dutch, and Byzantine motifs. In 1886 he moved to a new house in Grove End Road, St John's Wood, an area fashionable among artists. Originally belonging to Jean-Jacques Tissot (also a former pupil of Baron Henri Leys) the house was extensively remodelled to Alma-Tadema's own design and once again incorporated eclectic motifs. A striking and original feature was the domed ceiling of the studio; covered with aluminium paint it cast a silvery light, allowing the artist to simulate a Mediterranean sunlight even in the winter months. Laura Alma-Tadema's studio, by contrast, was fitted with dark wood panelling in the image of a Dutch-style interior. The decoration of his studio had a profound effect on Alma-Tadema's work. The walls of his Antwerp studio were bright red, in Townshend House light green, and in Grove End Road silvery white. Accordingly by the 1880s the settings of his paintings had moved from Pompeian interiors of dark, rich tones to exteriors of glistening marble and bright Mediterranean sea and sky. For example the settings of <span class="italic">Coign of Vantage</span> (1895; priv. coll.) and <span class="italic">Silver Favourites</span> (1903; Manchester City Galleries), both completed in Grove End Road, with their marble terraces overlooking a clear blue sea, suggest the luxurious holiday villas built by wealthy Romans along the coastline of the Bay of Naples.<br>
<br>During the 1870s and 1880s Alma-Tadema turned to subjects illustrative of Roman history. However, rather than exemplifying high-minded ideals of moral courage and heroism these works depict inglorious moments in Roman history. <span class="italic">A Roman Emperor <span class="smallcap">AD</span> 41</span> (1871; Walters Art Gallery, Baltimore) shows the proclamation of Claudius as emperor after the murder of his infamous nephew Caligula; and <span class="italic">The Roses of Heliogabalus</span> (1888; priv. coll.), the artist's most glorious revel in Roman decadence, depicts a mad emperor in the act of suffocating his dinner guests under a deluge of rose petals.<br>
<br>Although mainly concerned with Roman subjects Alma-Tadema also turned briefly to Greece. Unlike Frederic Leighton, whose Greek paintings represented mythological or literary themes, or Albert Moore, who utilized Greek-type drapery styles and motifs essentially as embellishment of aesthetic paintings, Alma-Tadema's Greece is a historical world, as meticulously constructed as his Rome from ancient sources. Although depicting an imaginary event, <span class="italic">Phidias Showing the Frieze of the Parthenon to his Friends</span> (1868; Birmingham Art Gallery and Museum) shows the newly constructed Parthenon frieze and brings a tangibility to this most elevated symbol of Hellenism in the visual sphere. Alma-Tadema also painted a small number of portraits but avoided formal society commissions and concentrated on intimate depictions of family and friends. <span class="italic">94&deg; in the Shade</span> (1876; FM Cam.), a portrait of Herbert Thompson, the son of Alma-Tadema's friend and doctor Sir Henry Thompson, evokes the balmy heat of a summer afternoon as a boy reads in the shaded corner of a hayfield. Furthermore it is one of the few examples to reveal the artist's skill as a <i>plein-air</i> landscapist. During the 1890s Alma-Tadema also played an important role in the visualization of the ancient world on the Victorian stage. He designed stage sets and costumes for major Shakespearian and modern dramatic productions, including Herbert Beerbohm Tree's <span class="italic">Hypatia</span> (1893)&#151;based on Charles Kingsley's novel of the same name&#151;<span class="italic">Julius Caesar</span> (1898), and Henry Irving's <span class="italic">Coriolanus</span> (1901).<br>
<br>Alma-Tadema's paintings are characterized by soft colour-harmonies, gorgeous textures, and settings of marbled interiors or sunny Mediterranean seascapes. Yet his works also reveal a remarkable knowledge of classical archaeology; it is salutary to note that he was awarded the gold medal of the Royal Institute of British Architects in 1906 in acknowledgement of the archaeological and architectural distinction of his reconstructions. Testimony to his knowledge of current archaeological developments is the accumulation of a vast library of over 4000 volumes, many of which were publications on ancient art and architecture by contemporary scholars and archaeologists. He also made numerous visits to sites in Italy and Greece, where he was able to take his own measurements as well as make sketches. Many of his paintings present meticulous reconstructions of ancient buildings, including well-known Roman monuments, for example <span class="italic">The Coliseum</span> (1896; priv. coll.) and <span class="italic">Thermae Antoninianae</span> (<span class="italic">The Baths of Caracalla</span>) (1899; priv. coll.). He also depicted numerous sculptures, statuettes, and decorative objects based on Greek and Roman originals.<br>
<br>Photographs of ancient sculpture, architecture, and archaeological sites, along with a number of sketches by Alma-Tadema himself, formed part of an extensive reference collection (housed at the Heslop Library, University of Birmingham) of 167 portfolios. This collection assisted the artist in respect of both precision of archaeological detail and composition. Many of his works achieve an instantaneous impression, as found in photography, through the use of cut-off figures and buildings; a sense that the artist has caught a small part of a larger scene that continues beyond the confines of the canvas is conveyed. His method involved working directly on the canvas, from a quick initial sketch up to the final version. A perfectionist, he is known to have made alterations to paintings on the eve of exhibition and even after a work had already found a buyer.<br>
<br>Unlike other Victorian classical-subject painters, such as Frederic Leighton, Edward Poynter, and J. W. Waterhouse, whose repertoires included paintings of nudes and partially-clothed figures, Alma-Tadema produced few nudes. Those that he did paint are usually female figures set within the appropriate setting of the Roman bathhouse. The erotic potential of <span class="italic">Tepidarium</span> (1881; Lady Lever Art Gallery, Port Sunlight), depicting a flushed reclining nude, is diminished by its archaeologically-specific title and its tiny dimensions (24.2 cm &times; 33 cm). One of his few life-sized nudes, <span class="italic">A Sculptor's Model</span> (1877; priv. coll.), provoked the bishop of Carlisle to comment: &#145;for a living artist to exhibit a life-size, life-like, almost photographic representation of a beautiful naked woman strikes my inartistic mind as somewhat, if not very, mischievous&#146;  (A. M. W. Stirling, <span class="italic">The Richmond Papers</span>, 1926, 63). Alma-Tadema, however, was generally more interested in half-hidden suggestive allusions than in unashamed eroticism. For example <span class="italic">Spring</span> (1894; J. P. Getty Museum, Malibu) is a seemingly innocent and joyous scene showing a religious procession headed by a group of pretty flower girls. However, in the middle of the crowd a standard bears a Latin inscription, which can be recognized as a verse dedication (known as <span class="roman">Catullus 18</span>) to the fertility god, Priapus, while at the same time archaeological detail&#151;silver statuettes of satyrs and decorative paintings of semi-nude frolicking couples&#151;likewise points to another aspect of Roman religion; the initial, innocent reading of the painting is subverted.<h2>
<a name="Personalitydeathandreputation"></a>Personality, death, and reputation</h2>Reminiscences from Alma-Tadema's contemporaries during the period are peppered with anecdotes relating to his jocular personality and lively sense of humour, though given the strong Dutch accent that he retained throughout his life his own stories and jokes often left his audience baffled. He was a notable member of the high cultural and social milieu of his day. His circle included the prince of Wales (later Edward VII) and the young Winston Churchill, while such illustrious guests as Tchaikovsky and Caruso attended his musical soir&eacute;es. The painter Frederick Yeames and the critic F. G. Stephens described their meeting with him thus:<blockquote>A short sturdily built man with twinkling eyes, cheery smile, hair parted in the middle of a broad forehead and small tawny beard, would hurry forward with an hospitable handshake, and bustling into his studio to look at pictures of Greek and Roman ladies reclining on the most marvellously painted marble, would talk rapid unfluent English telling stories quite outside his art, and beaming when he brought a smile to the lips of his guests. (Swanson, <span class="italic">Biography and Catalogue Raisonn&eacute;</span>, 97)</blockquote>From his time as an art student Alma-Tadema allocated each painting in his large oeuvre an opus number: <span class="italic">Portrait of my Sister, Artje</span> (1850), painted at the age of fifteen, is numbered 1, while two months before his death he completed <span class="italic">Preparations in the Coliseum</span> (1912; priv. coll.), numbered 408. During his lifetime he enjoyed both commercial success and a respected position in the art world. His patrons were international financiers who included Sir John Aird, the marqu&eacute;s de Santurce, and William Walters, and his works are now located in museums founded by such collectors: the Lady Lever Art Gallery, Port Sunlight, Cheshire; and the Walters Art Gallery, Baltimore. His standing in the British art world was acknowledged with a knighthood in 1899 and the Order of Merit in 1905. He died on 25 June 1912 at Kaiserhof Spa, Wiesbaden, Germany, where he was undergoing treatment for ulceration of the stomach, and was buried with full ceremony in St Paul's Cathedral, London, on 5 July.<br>
<br>A memorial exhibition held that year at the Royal Academy provoked unfavourable critical responses. The most scathing attack was by Roger Fry, who likened Alma-Tadema's figures and objects to &#145;highly-scented soap&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Nation</span>, 18 Jan 1913, 666&#150;7). By the second decade of the twentieth century his brand of Victorian classicism was no longer fashionable. However, a renewed commercial and academic interest in Victorian painting during the late twentieth century revived his reputation, and his technical expertise, sensuous appeal, and subversive irony once again attracted a wide audience.<br>
