<span class="headword">Bobart <span class="st"> [Bobert]</span>,  Jacob, the elder</span>  (<em>c.</em>1599&#150;1680), <span class="occ">botanist and gardener</span>, was born at Brunswick. After a period as a soldier, during which he added a working knowledge of English and Latin to his native tongue, he settled in Oxford, possibly as an innkeeper, before being appointed superintendent of the university's new physic garden, apparently shortly before 1641, by its founder, the earl of Danby. Danby's estate was subsequently sequestrated and for at least seven years Bobart went unpaid, but he must have continued to work assiduously, for in 1648 the 64-page <span class="italic">Catalogus plantarum horti medici Oxoniensis</span>, which though anonymous is credited to him on the testimony of Dillenius, boasted an impressive 1600 &#145;<i>stirpes</i>&#146; (many of them now known to be mere horticultural varieties), among which Canadian plants feature prominently. An improved edition (1658) was issued in conjunction with his son and two others. By then admiring tributes to the beauty and richness in species he had effected in the garden had long been coming from its visitors, who included Evelyn, Ashmole, Pepys, the grand duke of Tuscany, and the prince of Orange (with whom he conversed in Dutch).<br>
<br>Thomas Baskerville knew Bobart as a stocky, square-set man, tall and strong, and recorded how one Whitsuntide he tagged his waist-length beard with silver and drew a crowd to the garden as a result. A later writer in the <span class="italic">Gardeners' Chronicle</span>  (1885, 208) was to remark on the patently strong character caught in a portrait of him, that of someone who &#145;could hold his own among the dons of the University&#146;.<br>
<br>Bobart's two sons, from his first marriage, to Mary (<i>d</i>. 1655), also became professional gardeners, the elder, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2742/', "Jacob Bobart the younger")</script>, succeeding to his physic garden post. His second wife, Ann, outlived him, and died in 1696. Bobart died in office on 4 February 1680 and was buried in the church of St Peter-in-the-East, Oxford, where a tablet to his memory describes him as &#145;a man of great integrity&#146;. His will, made three years earlier, reveals him as the owner of considerable local property: an inn was left to his elder surviving son, some houses to the younger one, and a further house to one of his six daughters. <i>Bobartia</i>, a genus of South African members of the iris family, was named by Linnaeus in honour of him and his elder son jointly; though he himself invariably spelt his name Bobert, his elder son changed this to Bobart, which has traditionally been used for both.<br>
