<span class="headword">Rivers,  Augustus Henry  Lane Fox Pitt-</span>  (1827&#150;1900), <span class="occ">anthropologist and archaeologist</span>, was born Augustus Henry Lane Fox on 14 April 1827 at Hope Hall, Bramham, Yorkshire, the second son of William Augustus Lane Fox (1795&#150;1832), army officer, and Lady Caroline (<i>d</i>. 1873), daughter of the Hon. John Douglas. He changed his name to Pitt-Rivers in 1880 on inheriting the estates of his cousin Horace Pitt, sixth Baron Rivers, which brought him considerate wealth. (Despite expenditure throughout his life on his collections and excavations, he died a very wealthy man.)<br>
<br>He was educated at the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, and commissioned into the Grenadier Guards in 1845. In 1851 he joined the committee on the adoption of the rifle into the British army and was subsequently first instructor at the Hythe School of Musketry. Taking considerable interest in this aspect of his professional duties, he amassed a collection of historic firearms. He married on 3 February 1853 Alice Margaret (<i>d</i>. 1910), eldest daughter of the second Baron Stanley of Alderley. They had six sons and three daughters, among them <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/55591/', "Lady (Agnes) Geraldine Grove")</script>.<br>
<br>The publication of Darwin's <span class="italic">On the Origin of Species</span> in 1859 marked a major turning point in Lane Fox's life. His collection of firearms had expanded to include other weapons, tools, and appliances. He used this ethnographic material to illustrate his theory of the evolution of culture, which he developed by analogy to Herbert Spencer's social Darwinism, and which he published in 1875. This theory embodied the idea of typology&#151;the realization that objects can be placed in chronological sequence on the basis of slight changes in design, a crucial concept for archaeology. His collections were later given to Oxford University where they form the core of the Pitt Rivers Museum, which opened in 1884. He was awarded a DCL degree in 1886.<br>
<br>Lane Fox's interest in field archaeology seems to have begun in the 1860s during his posting in southern Ireland, where he surveyed a number of prehistoric forts. In 1864 he was elected a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London and on his return to England in 1867 began his archaeological field work in earnest. He worked with the indefatigable barrow digger Canon William Greenwell in Yorkshire, surveyed and excavated hill forts and flint mines on the Sussex downs, and went flint hunting in preference to more conventional field sports. He also discovered palaeolithic implements and animal bones in the drift gravels of the Thames valley, a significant contribution to contemporary science. A notable feature of his archaeological work is the attention that he gave to settlements, rather than concentrating on the funerary sites which occupied the attention of most antiquarians. He became vice-president of the Society of Antiquaries in 1871 and was elected FRS in 1876.<br>
<br>Celebrating his inheritance in 1880 with a holiday in Egypt, Pitt-Rivers (as he now became) found palaeolithic remains in the drift gravels of the Valley of the Kings, another remarkable and, at the time, controversial discovery. For the remaining twenty years of his life his archaeological work was divided between a formidable series of excavations in Dorset and Wiltshire, mainly on his own property, and his official duties as inspector of ancient monuments under the <span class="roman">Ancient Monuments Act</span> of 1882. The excavations in Cranborne Chase, undertaken by Pitt-Rivers with a staff of assistant supervisors and draughtsmen, and labourers from the estate, included prehistoric, Romano-British, and medieval sites. The excavations were published lavishly and the finds displayed in a museum at Farnham, Dorset. The museum also contained models of the excavated sites and ethnographic objects. Pitt-Rivers laid out the Larmer Pleasure Grounds nearby with picnic bowers, an open-air theatre, and bandstand; there were dances, sporting contests, and other public events to make this remote, rural museum attractive. All this effort was directed to the end of teaching the evolution of culture theory. The teaching emphasized gradual change, and carried a strong political message: evolution, not revolution, was the road to progress. Pitt-Rivers had retired from the army in 1882 with the rank of lieutenant-general, having seen active service in the Crimea as a staff officer. He was on the active list until 1896 and was honorary colonel of the South Lancashire regiment for several years. He devoted the rest of his time to the duties of a country landowner&#151;road building, tree planting, and agricultural improvements. Pitt-Rivers died on 4 May 1900 at his country house, Rushmore, Tollard Royal, Cranborne Chase. He was cremated, and his ashes placed in Tollard Royal church, Wiltshire.<br>
<br>After his death Pitt-Rivers's precepts were largely forgotten by archaeologists. It was not until the mid-twentieth century that a new group of professional archaeologists rediscovered his work. His fame has rested at different times on his abilities as an excavator, a builder of typologies, and a theorist. He was also a bridge-builder between anthropology and archaeology, and an educator.<br>
<br>Pitt-Rivers's importance as an excavator rests on his insistence on contextual recording. He was among the first practitioners to turn antiquarianism into archaeology by recording in detail the precise position of his finds, thus rendering them useful as scientific evidence. He was one of the finest excavators of his generation; at his best, in the late 1880s and early 1890s, his care in recording information in plan and section drawings rivals modern practice. He was also in advance of his day in recording the mundane as well as the spectacular.<br>
<br>The theory of the evolution of culture has not found wide acceptance. Darwin himself rejected social Darwinism and particularly its political notion that evolution can be equated with progress. Huxley rejected the gradualism of Darwin's theory, which was also a central tenet of Pitt-Rivers's theory. The theory of the evolution of culture was deeply flawed; Darwinian evolution proceeds by the selection of random genetic adaptations, while cultural change proceeds by the direct transmission of learning which takes place within, as well as across, generations. Nevertheless, if Pitt-Rivers was wrong about the mechanism by which sequences are created he was right about the sequences themselves. Archaeology in the nineteenth century was a science desperately seeking a chronology, and Pitt-Rivers probably did more than anyone in his generation to promote the establishment of a sound chronology for British archaeology.<br>
<br>Archaeology and anthropology were seen largely as two aspects of the same science in the late nineteenth century. It was only later that the disciplines drifted apart. Pitt-Rivers was at the forefront of both disciplines, as a collector of ethnographic materials and an excavator of archaeological sites. The two interests are frequently linked in his published works, largely through his theoretical position; archaeology and anthropology were inseparable elements in the study of cultural evolution. Although, once again, his theory is wrong, the connection was of immense benefit to both disciplines, as has been recognized again since the 1960s.<br>
<br>Public education was Pitt-Rivers's ultimate goal. He believed that existing museums confused their roles in research and education, so that most museum displays were simply tedious. His own museum, with its illustrative models, was an attempt to break this mould. Both Farnham Museum and the Pitt Rivers Museum in Oxford have inspired and delighted a numerous and varied public.<br>
