<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Bowden,  (Bertram) Vivian</span>, Baron Bowden  (1910&#150;1989), <span class="occ">scientist and educationist</span>, was born on 18 January 1910 in Chesterfield, Derbyshire, the elder child and only son of Bertram Caleb Bowden, primary school headmaster in Chesterfield, and his wife, Sarah Elizabeth, daughter of John Thomas Moulton, of Throwley Hall, Staffordshire. He was educated at Chesterfield grammar school and became a scholar at Emmanuel College, Cambridge, where he was awarded first-class honours in both parts of the natural sciences tripos (1930 and 1931). He was awarded a PhD at Cambridge for a thesis on the structure of radioactive nuclei.<br>
<br>Bowden then became an Imperial Chemical Industries fellow at the University of Amsterdam (1934&#150;5), sixth-form master at Liverpool collegiate school (1935&#150;7), and chief physics master at Oundle School (1937&#150;40), before moving to the Ministry of Defence Telecommunications Research Establishment, initially at Swanage and then in Malvern (1940&#150;43). Here he investigated the use of radar to detect aircraft and precisely position them. This work began in Malvern, and in May 1943 moved to Washington, where Bowden led a British team working with the Americans at the naval research laboratories. He showed his capacity to earn the trust of people at all levels in an organization, and to cut through delaying bureaucracy to get things done. In 1973 he was given the Pioneer award by the American Institution of Electrical and Electronic Engineers. The citation, which recognized &#145;work done at least 20 years before but which remains important and in use&#146;, applauded Bowden's &#145;wartime radar identification system that has become an essential aid for modern air traffic control&#146;.<br>
<br>After the war Bowden had a brief period at the Atomic Energy Research Establishment at Harwell (July&#150;December 1946) before becoming a partner with Sir Robert Watson-Watt &amp; Partners (1947&#150;50). He left the partnership when Sir Robert Watson-Watt moved to Canada, and joined Ferranti (Digital Computers) Ltd to attempt to sell digital computers at a profit. He thought it a most peculiar job until he met a man on the <i>Queen Mary</i> who sold lighthouses on commission. In the brief period of this appointment (1950&#150;53) he successfully applied his great energy. He was particularly effective in explaining, with uncanny prescience, the dramatic effect that the digital computer was destined to have. Some of these thoughts he gathered together in his book <span class="italic">Faster than Thought</span> (1953).<br>
<br>In 1953 Bowden became principal of the Manchester College of Science and Technology. At that time it taught a modest number of students on degree courses of the University of Manchester and a large number of part-time students, who studied for the national certificate and other qualifications. Shortly after Bowden arrived, a period of rapid national expansion in higher education was launched, and he exploited this to the full. He attracted substantial resources, which transformed what he referred to as the surrounding dereliction and slums into an attractive campus with fine buildings. The university numbers expanded by a factor of about ten to the point where the city decided to transfer the non-university work to another college, much to Bowden's regret. The Manchester College then became an independent chartered body, the University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology (UMIST), and was put on the University Grants Committee's list.<br>
<br>The development of UMIST was Bowden's great achievement. He had drive and energy, and a clear vision of what he wished to achieve. He did things by impulse, offering chairs to outstanding candidates at chance meetings in airport lounges and leaving his efficient and supportive registrar, Joe Burgess, to tidy up the legal processes afterwards. He made UMIST visible to the media by his public statements, in which he generated quotable aphorisms. He employed striking statistics to back his arguments. In these he often used the truth with some economy, but his conclusions were powerful. His national visibility led Harold Wilson to make him a life peer as Baron Bowden of Chesterfield (1963) and to appoint him minister for education and science (1964). Wilson hoped that Bowden would assist the development of the white-hot technological revolution, but it was not to be. Bowden has been described, accurately, as a man possessing candour without guile. This is not a quality that promises success in dealing with permanent civil servants, his relationship with whom Bowden described as &#145;like fighting a feather bed; you meet no resistance but you cannot get through it&#146;. So he left the ministry in 1965, after having set up the industrial training boards, which was a brave attempt to persuade industry to contribute to the cost of training the skills it needed. He returned to UMIST. Here he continued to twinge consciences. He criticized the government for a fiscal policy that deterred industrial investment in new plant and processes. He counselled against the bifurcation of higher education. He despaired of the inadequate number of engineering and technology graduates entering British industry, and he was forever petitioning the city to act to reduce the &#145;decaying slums around the UMIST campus&#146;. He retired in 1976.<br>
<br>Bowden was a mixture of the ruthless and the humane. He had a portly figure, which could be recognized at some distance by its rolling gait. As he said, &#145;I walk as if one leg is always shorter than the next one.&#146; His door was always open. He was continually visible around the campus, and took a keen interest in the problems and successes of all his staff, from the humble to the great. His concern with staff morale led him to pioneer the involvement of students in the decision-making bodies of UMIST. For this he was roundly criticized by the traditionalists, but later UMIST was to avoid the excesses of the student unrest of the 1960s. He was honorary fellow of the Institution of Civil Engineers (FICE) (1975) and had honorary degrees from Rensellaer Polytechnic, USA (1974), Manchester (1976), and Kumasi, Ghana (1977).<br>
<br>Bowden married in 1939 Marjorie Mary (<i>d</i>. 1957), daughter of William G. H. Browne, chief government sanitary inspector in British Guiana. They had a son and two daughters. The marriage was dissolved in 1954. In 1955 he married Diana Stewart. They were divorced in 1961 and in 1967 he married Mary Maltby, who died in 1971. She was the daughter of Bernard W. Maltby, of Ilkeston, Derbyshire. In 1974 he married Phyllis, former wife of John Henry Lewis James, and daughter of Stanley Ernest Myson, postman. This marriage was dissolved in 1983. Bowden died on 28 July 1989 in a nursing home in Bowdon, Cheshire.<br>
