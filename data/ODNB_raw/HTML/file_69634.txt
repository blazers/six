<span class="headword">Kollmann,  Augustus Frederic Christopher</span>  (1756&#150;1829), <span class="occ">music theorist</span>, was born on 21 March 1756 in Engelbostel near Hanover, Germany, the elder son of Christoph Johann Heinrich Kollmann, the Engelbostel organist and schoolmaster, and his wife, Sophia Margaret Hachmeister. After studying in Engelbostel and at the Hanover Gymnasium, Kollmann became a pupil of and assistant to Johann Christoph B&ouml;ttner, organist of the Marktkirche, the principal church in Hanover. In his autobiographical account of about 1824 Kollmann described B&ouml;ttner as &#145;an able organist in J. S. Bach's style&#146;  (Sainsbury, 2.22). In 1779 Kollmann was admitted to the K&ouml;nigliches Schullehrer-Seminar, the academy in Hanover where schoolteachers were trained; his masters included B&ouml;ttner. Kollmann said in his autobiographical account that he learned there his &#145;methodical and systematical manner of teaching, which has been very advantageous to him, not only for school instruction, but also in teaching music, and particularly in writing his musical treatises&#146;  (ibid.).<br>
<br>On 10 December 1781 Kollmann was appointed organist and schoolmaster of Kloster L&uuml;ne, a former convent near L&uuml;neburg which had been converted to a protestant home for noble ladies. Although he remained there only until the following July, his loss was felt deeply, the superintendent recording that in Kollmann all didactic talents had been combined and were elevated by the best moral character.<br>
<br>Kollmann left because he had been selected by the Hanoverian government to fulfil George III's command that someone be found to serve as organist and schoolmaster of the Royal German Chapel in St James's Palace, London. According to the Chapel Royal cheque book Kollmann was sworn as porter of His Majesty's Lutheran Chapel on 17 September 1782. He remained at the chapel for the rest of his life, living in apartments in the friary court of the palace. Until Queen Charlotte's death in 1817, when the chapel school was closed, he spent part of four days every week teaching German and music to boys under the age of twelve. One of his scholars was the bookseller and publisher Henry George Bohn (1796&#150;1884).<br>
<br>Kollmann married Christina Catherina Ruel (1745&#150;1823) at St Luke's, Chelsea, on 26 October 1783. They had two children, <a name="cosubject_69635"></a><span class="headword">Johanna Sophia Kollmann</span>  (1786&#150;1849)<span class="occ"></span> and <a name="cosubject_69634"></a><span class="headword">George Augustus Kollmann</span>  (1789&#150;1845)<span class="occ"></span>, who succeeded his father as organist of the Royal German Chapel.<br>
<br>Kollmann endeavoured to develop a theory that would account for every note in a musical composition. His &#145;particular study&#146;, he explained in his <span class="italic">New Theory of Musical Harmony</span> (1806), was &#145;to find out a simple method, by which every note, that is useful in music, might obtain as positive a rule, as it denotes a positive sound&#146;  (2nd edn, 1823, 4). In this theory the &#145;regularity&#146; of a musical composition could be proved by showing how it could be derived from a simple musical entity by successive application of a small number of rules. Kollmann's theory was a pioneering attempt to provide what would now be called a generative theory of tonality, the &#145;musical language&#146; that has governed most European music composed from about 1600 to 1900 and much composed subsequently. Exploiting the ancient analogy between music and language, Kollmann divided his theory into grammatical and rhetorical parts. His most mature statement of these parts is in the 1823 edition of the <span class="italic">New Theory</span> and the 1812 edition of his <span class="italic">Essay on Practical Musical Composition</span> respectively.<br>
<br>Kollmann also exemplified aspects of his theory in musical compositions with &#145;theoretical explanations&#146;. Although some of these compositions curiously transcend the common practice of their time, Kollmann noted in his autobiographical account that he had applied himself principally to music's &#145;theoretical department&#146; and his achievements are most significant there.<br>
<br>Kollmann was one of the earliest advocates of the music of J. S. Bach in England. Besides printing several Bach compositions in his treatises and, in 1806, a separate edition of Bach's &#145;Chromatic&#146; fantasy, he proposed in 1799 an edition of Bach's forty-eight preludes and fugues, the <span class="italic">Well-Tempered Clavier</span>, which had not yet been published anywhere in its entirety. After Kollmann's proposal was noticed in a German music periodical by Professor Johann Nicholas Forkel of G&ouml;ttingen University, three European publishers produced editions of the &#145;48&#146; and Kollmann abandoned his plan. However, he assisted Samuel Wesley in 1808&#150;10 with information about Bach and lent a manuscript of the &#145;48&#146; to Wesley and Charles Frederick Horn when they were preparing their edition of this work. Kollmann translated excerpts from Forkel's biography of Bach in his 1812 magazine the <span class="italic">Quarterly Musical Register</span>.<br>
<br>Kollmann died, probably in his apartments at St James's Palace, on 19 April 1829. His funeral on 27 April proceeded to St Mary's German Lutheran Church at the Savoy, where he was buried in the same vault as his wife. The funeral service, which included one of Kollmann's own hymns, was read by Frederick William Blomberg, chaplain to the royal household.<br>
<br>George Kollmann was born in London on 30 January 1789, probably at St James's Palace. He made his d&eacute;but performing his father's piano concerto in London in 1804. He designed and manufactured a novel pianoforte featuring down-striking action, for which he received a patent in 1825. His keyboard skills, shown particularly in a series of &#145;grand concerts&#146; demonstrating this invention in 1838&#150;9, received critical acclaim, but he was declared bankrupt in 1840. He also received patents in 1836 and 1839 for improvements in railways and locomotive carriages. Despite various efforts these inventions were never adopted. He died on 19 March 1845 at St James's Palace, having been suffering from kidney disease following a spinal injury, and was buried at St Mary's German Lutheran Church at the Savoy.<br>
<br>Johanna Kollmann was born on 20 July 1786, probably at St James's Palace, and first appeared publicly as a singer in 1806. She assisted her brother in his pianoforte business and succeeded him as organist of the Royal German Chapel. She died at St James's Palace on 11 May 1849 and was buried at St Mary's German Lutheran Church at the Savoy on 21 May.<br>
