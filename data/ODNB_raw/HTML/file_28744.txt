<span class="headword">Waring,  Robert</span>  (1614?&#150;1658), <span class="occ">writer</span>, was born to a family long settled at the Ley, Staffordshire. His father was Edmund Waring; his mother was the daughter of Richard Broughton of Owlbury in the parish of Bishops Castle, Shropshire, and a niece of the rabbinical scholar Hugh Broughton. He had at least one older brother, Walter Waring, and at least one sister, Anne, later Staunton.<br>
<br>Waring attended Westminster School and entered Christ Church, Oxford, in 1630. He matriculated in 1632, graduated with a BA on 20 June 1634, and received his MA on 26 April 1637. During the civil war he bore arms for Charles I at Oxford but his loyalty cost him dearly: no sooner had he been elected senior proctor and Camden professor of ancient history (on 29 April and 2 August 1647 respectively) than he was ordered to give up both posts by the parliamentary visitors sent that year to purge the colleges of royalists. Waring's election had been contested by Charles Wheare, son of the previous professor, Degory Wheare, whom the parliamentary visitors favoured  (Burrows, 236). The prelude to the clash between the visitors and Christ Church is documented in <span class="italic">A Publike Conference Betwixt the Six Presbyterian Ministers, and Some Independent Commanders &hellip; a Satire</span> (1646), attributed to Waring, while an account of the heated dispute that ensued is given in <span class="italic">The University of Oxfords Plea Refuted</span> (1647). The latter was written jointly by several afflicted royalists, including Waring and John Fell, son of the dean of Christ Church, Samuel Fell; the latter had also been ousted by the visitors unceremoniously. Waring defended his position staunchly: he defied the visitors' order that he be removed from his posts and on 14 December 1647 was &#145;adjudged guilty of high contempt and denyall of authority of Parliament&#146;  (ibid., 185). Selden's intervention saved him from being entirely banished from the university, but on 7 April 1648 he was summoned to London and ordered into custody. Yet again Waring defied the order and escaped to Oxford; on 14 September 1648, however, he was among those ordered to leave the university within a fortnight  (ibid., 19, 185&#150;6).<br>
<br>In the end Waring was stripped of his proctorship, professorship, and student's place, and forced to hand in his books and other personal belongings to the visitors. Defeated, he retired to Apley, Shropshire, at the invitation of Sir William Whitmore, that &#145;great patron of distressed cavaliers&#146; with whom he later travelled to France.<br>
<br>As an author Waring is probably best known for his <span class="italic">Amoris effigies, sive, Quid sit amor?</span> [1657], written in Latin and translated into English by John Norris in 1682 as <span class="italic">Effigies amoris in English, or, The Picture of Love Unveil'd</span>. Norris was clearly enraptured by Waring's treatise on love: having mastered &#145;this novel&#146;, he writes in the preface  (Norris, <span class="italic">Effigies amoris in English</span>, 2nd edn, 1701, 5), &#145;the judicious reader &hellip; will discern new thoughts like little stars glimmering out of the rich Galaxy&#146;  (ibid., 8). Waring also published <span class="italic">A Sermon Preached at St. Margarets in Westminster, at the Funeral of Mrs Susanna Gray</span> (1657) and contributed to John Fell's <span class="italic">The Life of the most Learned, Reverend and Pious Dr H. Hammond</span> (1661). Some of his verse in Latin is included in various editions of <span class="italic">Amoris effigies</span>. In Wood he is described as a Latin and English poet &#145;but a better orator, &hellip; reckoned among the great wits of his time in the University&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 3rd edn, 3.453&#150;4).<br>
<br>Back in England, Waring fell gravely ill and died in Lincoln's Inn Fields on 9 May 1658. On 10 May he was buried at St Michael's Church, College Hill. His eldest brother, Walter, was buried in the same grave only ten days after Robert's funeral  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 3rd edn, 3.453&#150;4). Robert never married; his will was proved by his sister and sole executor, Anne Staunton.<br>
