<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Ward,  Edward <span class="st"> [Ned]</span></span>  (1667&#150;1731), <span class="occ">satirist</span>, was born of unknown parentage, probably in the English midlands. According to Shiels, he was &#145;of low extraction and irregular education&#146;  (Cibber, 4.293), but Ward himself spoke of his ancestors in Leicestershire as men of property  (dedicatory epistle, <span class="italic">Nuptial Dialogues and Debates</span>), and his writings display some knowledge of Latin and French. In 1706 he expressed his &#145;indissoluble Obligations&#146; to some unspecified noble family &#145;for the best and greatest share&#146; of his youthful education  (dedicatory epistle, <span class="italic">Writings</span>).<br>
<br>Ward was in London by 1691, the date of his first traced publication, <span class="italic">The Poet's Ramble after Riches</span>, in which he laments his poverty in Hudibrastic verse. It is likely that he wrote a good deal more in the next seven years, but the only identifiable works of his are the prose satires <span class="italic">Female Policy Detected, or, The Arts of a Designing Woman Laid Open</span> (1695) and <span class="italic">A Trip to Jamaica</span> (1698). The latter tells how Ward sailed for Jamaica in January 1697 to seek his fortune, but returned disappointed to London before the end of the year: it may well be based on first-hand experience, unlike its sequel, <span class="italic">A Trip to New-England</span> (1699). He now adapted the &#145;trip&#146; format to a satirical portrait of London. <span class="italic">The London Spy</span> (its title doubtless modelled on the French work translated as <span class="italic">The Turkish Spy</span>, 1687&#150;94) was published in eighteen monthly parts, beginning in November 1698. In lively prose, with occasional songs and verses, it graphically described the seamy side of London life, with racy anecdotes and character sketches, and established Ward's name and style. It was followed by over 100 identifiable satires in prose and verse, many of them reissued singly, sometimes in revised form, as well as appearing in at least a dozen partial collections of Ward's writings between 1700 and 1718. <span class="italic">The London Spy</span> itself was reprinted complete five times in Ward's lifetime.<br>
<br>Ward's typical targets included cheating vintners and ale house keepers in <span class="italic">Sot's Paradise</span> (1698), astrologers in <span class="italic">The World Bewitched</span> (1699), and dissenting ministers, apothecaries, physicians, lawyers, parish poor officers, pirate booksellers, and cheating vintners again in <span class="italic">A Journey to Hell</span> (3 parts, 1700&#150;05). In 1699 and 1700 he extended the &#145;trip&#146; formula to Islington, Sadler's Wells, Bath, and &#145;Stir-Bitch&#146; (Stourbridge) fair near Cambridge. He expanded some satires into periodicals, such as <span class="italic">The Weekly Comedy, as it is Dayly Acted at most Coffee-Houses in London</span> (10 numbers, May to July 1699), rehashed as <span class="italic">The Humours of a Coffee-House</span> (7 numbers, June to August 1707), after which Ward relinquished it to William Oldisworth, perhaps because, from July 1707, Ward was simultaneously producing two other short-lived satirical periodicals: <span class="italic">The Diverting Muse</span> (6 numbers) and <span class="italic">The London Terraefilius</span> (6 numbers). In <span class="italic">Honesty in Distress but Relieved by No Party</span> (1705) he tried his hand at a droll of the type presented at Bartholomew fair, but there is no record of its being performed. (All the other dramas attributed to Ward in <span class="italic">Biographia dramatica</span> are either not dramas or probably not by Ward.)<br>
<br>Ward developed seventeenth-century &#145;character writing&#146; in prose and verse by placing character in locale and bringing it to life through dialogue. Each of his fifty-four <span class="italic">Nuptial Dialogues and Debates</span> (1710), for instance, dramatizes a conflict between some prickly pair, such as &#145;a nice affected gentleman and his careless slatternly wife&#146;, and concludes with &#145;moral reflexions&#146; of a paternalist kind. Other characters are humorously displayed in their professional or social groupings: for instance the two armed services in <span class="italic">The Wooden World Dissected</span> (1706) and <span class="italic">Mars Stript of his Armour</span> (1708), or the thirty-two societies in <span class="italic">The Secret History of Clubs</span> (1709). Most clubs satirized in this collection were fictitious, but one exception was the Kit-Cat, the resort of whig statesmen and men of letters. Ward probably also had a hand in <span class="italic">The Secret History of the Calves-Head Club, or, The Republicans Unmask'd</span>, first issued in January 1703 and reissued, with revisions and additions, annually for ten years. The club, whether real or legendary, was alleged to be a profane whig society which met on 30 January to honour regicides and deride Charles I.<br>
<br>Ward was a high-church tory who involved himself in political controversy from at least as early as 1698 with <span class="italic">Ecclesia et factio</span>, the first of his several attacks on low-church moderation and occasional conformity. That attack was broadened in <span class="italic">The Dissenting Hypocrite</span> (1704) to include dissenters in general and the leading whig journalists Tutchin and Defoe. Both those works were in Hudibrastic verse, as was Ward's best-known political publication, <span class="italic">Hudibras Redivivus</span>, issued in twenty-four monthly parts between August 1705 and June 1707. This open-ended burlesque at first drew topical material, month by month, from the political struggle, but became less controversial after Ward was taken into custody in February and again in June 1706, charged with seditious libel. He had accused the queen of being faint-hearted in failing to support the tories in parliament  (<span class="italic">Hudibras Redivivus</span>, pt 5); he pleaded guilty, and on 14 November 1706, was fined 40 marks (&pound;26 13<i>s</i>. 4<i>d</i>.) and condemned to stand twice for one hour in the pillory. He was not silenced, for, in the closing numbers of <span class="italic">Hudibras Redivivus</span>, he hit on a safe, indirect vehicle of political satire by versifying passages from Clarendon's <span class="italic">History of the Grand Rebellion</span>. He returned to outspoken politics with <span class="italic">Vulgus Britannicus, or, The British Hudibras</span> (5 parts, 1710), which described in verse the riots accompanying the Sacheverell trial. Soon afterwards the newly triumphant tories passed their act to outlaw occasional conformity and Ward's outpouring of political satire slackened a little. He now completed versifications of <span class="italic">Don Quixote</span> (2 vols., 1711&#150;12) and Clarendon's <span class="italic">History</span> (3 vols., 1713&#150;15). Each work ran to 900 pages; the Clarendon also had eighty-five plates and cost &pound;500 to print: Ward lost money by it.<br>
<br>From 1702 or earlier Ward had lived in Gray's Inn, but in the autumn of 1712 he made a career move and opened an ale house near Clerkenwell Green. He had published over 100 separate works in fourteen years and achieved popular success but was perhaps aware that writing provided only precarious subsistence. In <span class="italic">The Hudibrastick Brewer</span> (1714), a mild satire against himself, he wrote that it is better &#145;To <i>live</i> by <i>Malt</i>, than <i>starve</i> by <i>Meter</i>&#146;. Between 1714 and 1717 he fired a few parting shots against the whigs in satires on Marlborough, Wharton, and bishops Burnet and Hoadly, but under George I his pen was far less active than under Anne. From about 1717 to about 1730 Ward kept the Bacchus tavern in Moorfields, where &#145;with his Wit, Humour, and good Liquor [he] has afforded his Guests a pleasurable Entertainment; especially the High-Church Party, which is compos'd of Men of his Principles, and to whom he is very much oblig'd for their constant Resort&#146;  (Jacob, 2.295). His scattering of new Hudibrastic poems in this period included <span class="italic">The Delights of the Bottle</span> (1720), describing the amenities and customers of his tavern, <span class="italic">The Merry Travellers</span> (1721), about a trip from Moorfields to Bromley, and <span class="italic">The Parish Guttlers</span> (1722), a biting satire on his local parish vestry. Reprints of his most popular earlier works sold well not only at home but in America: so much so that Cotton Mather in 1726 warned his readers against &#145;such Pestilences, and indeed all those worse than Egyptian Toads (the Spawns of a Butler, and a Brown, and a Ward &hellip;)&#146;  (Troyer, 227&#150;8).<br>
<br>Moorfields was geographically only a step away from Grub Street and Ward was a popular author whose subjects and readership were vulgar, so he was a natural target for Pope, though it seems that his only personal offence was to print Pope's epigram about the lady who pissed at a performance of Addison's <span class="italic">Cato</span> in his periodical the <span class="italic">Poetical Entertainer</span> in February 1714, when Pope was trying to interest Addison in his Homer translation. Whatever the cause, Pope attacked Ward twice in 1728. In <span class="italic">Peri Bathous</span> Ward is one of the frogs who &#145;live generally in the bottom of a ditch, and make a great noise whenever they thrust their heads above water&#146;  (Pope, <span class="italic">Prose Works</span>, 2.197), and there are two more contemptuous references to him in <span class="italic">The Dunciad</span>, one of which  (l. 200) is a sneer at Ward's popularity in America. In the following year Ward responded with a weak verse satire <span class="italic">Durgen</span> (that is, &#145;dwarf&#146;); Pope responded in the apparatus to <span class="italic">The Dunciad Variorum</span>, where, among other charges, he repeatedly called Ward an ale house keeper; and Ward replied in his scurrilous <span class="italic">Apollo's Maggot in his Cups</span>, in verse with a prose postscript refuting Pope's falsehoods. Stung by the ale house taunt, Ward insisted that he sold no malt liquor at the Bacchus, which was a tavern, not a public house, and that Pope himself had drunk wine there. Ward was evidently more sensitive about his social than his literary rank.<br>
<br>At some time between August 1729 and October 1730 Ward gave up the Bacchus tavern and established himself in the British Coffee House in Fullwood's Rents near Gray's Inn. He died there on 20 June 1731 and was buried on 27 June in St Pancras churchyard, Middlesex, with one mourning coach for his wife and daughter, as he had directed in his poetical will, dated 24 June 1725 and printed in <span class="italic">Appleby's Journal</span> on 28 September 1731. The names of his wife and children and the date of his marriage have not been traced. Ward's writings remained popular to the end of his life but sank without trace soon afterwards, except for <span class="italic">The London Spy</span>, which was serialized in several London and provincial newspapers in the 1730s. Later it was quarried by historians from Macaulay to the present day, even though Macaulay ungratefully called it &#145;nauseous balderdash&#146;  (Macaulay, 1.340n).<br>
