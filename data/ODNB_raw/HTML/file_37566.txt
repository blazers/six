<span class="headword">Hopp&eacute;,  Emil Otto</span>  (1878&#150;1972), <span class="occ">photographer</span>, was born on 14 April 1878 in Munich, Germany, the only son and elder child of Philip Hopp&eacute;, bank director, and his wife, Marie von der Porter, pianist. Soon after his birth the family moved to Vienna, where Hopp&eacute; began his formal education which he later completed in Paris and Munich. In 1900 he moved to London to work for the Deutsche Bank. In 1903, having received a camera as a birthday gift, he embarked on his career in photography. Hopp&eacute; became a member of the Royal Photographic Society in 1907, and later in that year won &pound;100 in a photographic competition. Encouraged, he resigned his post at the bank and, using the prize-money as capital, opened a portrait studio at 10 Margravine Gardens, Baron's Court. In 1905 Hopp&eacute; married Marion Bliersbach. They had a son, Frank (<i>b</i>. 1913), and a daughter, Marion (<i>b</i>. 1916).<br>
<br>Hopp&eacute; co-founded the London Salon of Photography in 1910; in the following year he held his first one-man show. Over the next fifteen years he became one of London's most celebrated portraitists while also establishing himself as a skilled theatre and fashion photographer. In 1913 he moved into 7 Cromwell Place, South Kensington, the former home of the painter Sir John Millais, and to make an impression on his wealthy clientele, had it lavishly redecorated. Conversely, the studio which he used for twenty years was simple and plain, matching a style of portrait photography in which, to use his own words, &#145;character rather than flattery [was] the dominant note&#146;  (Hopp&eacute;, 15). He was soon in great demand and the frequent republication of his work earned him much in reproduction fees. Among the publications to take his work were <span class="italic">Vogue</span>, <span class="italic">Vanity Fair</span>, the <span class="italic">Illustrated London News</span>, and the <span class="italic">Tatler</span>.<br>
<br>In 1921 Hopp&eacute; photographed George V and Queen Mary at Buckingham Palace, in a style that was informal by the standards of the time. In the following year his one-man exhibition of mainly portrait photographs at the Goupil Gallery won plaudits from the critics. John Galsworthy wrote the catalogue introduction, and record audiences viewed the touring exhibition. All 221 prints from the show were purchased by a consortium of collectors under the aegis of the <span class="italic">Asahi Shimbun</span>, one of Japan's leading newspapers, and were subsequently exhibited in Tokyo and Osaka in 1923.<br>
<br>Hopp&eacute; photographed numerous world leaders, including Benito Mussolini and American president Calvin Coolidge; assorted royalty, both European and Asian; and many of the century's leading artists and thinkers&#151;Vaslav Nijinsky, Albert Einstein, Ezra Pound, George Bernard Shaw, Rudyard Kipling, Somerset Maugham, and Thomas Hardy were among those who made up Hopp&eacute;'s vibrant social and intellectual milieu. Hopp&eacute; once said of his aesthetic mission: &#145;To confirm the spirit behind the eyes is the test&#146;  (Hopp&eacute;, 15).<br>
<br>Hopp&eacute; has been justly praised for his portraits, but his little-known topographic works by themselves would have qualified him as an innovative modernist before the term was even coined. Hopp&eacute;'s dynamic views of urban environments and industrial buildings link the late pictorialist experiments of his fellow member of the art photography group Linked Ring, Alvin Langdon Coburn, with the depression-era work of Walker Evans.<br>
<br>In his later years Hopp&eacute; turned his attention to landscape, travel, and news photography, capturing portraits and topographic views throughout Britain, Germany, Japan, the United States, South America, Australia, India, and Jamaica. Hopp&eacute; wrote and published extensively, producing some twenty-eight photographic books including two outstanding titles which exemplify his topographic work, <span class="italic">Romantic America: Picturesque United States</span> (1927) and <span class="italic">Deutsche Arbeit</span> (1930). He also ran a picture agency, which aided the dissemination of his work.<br>
<br>Hopp&eacute; died in Wildhern, Hampshire, on 9 December 1972. Cecil Beaton referred to him simply as &#145;the Master&#146;: elsewhere, he has been cited as the most important photographer in the world during the 1920s. He was certainly a photographer of daring vision and&#151;from his publications, and his role in the founding of the London Salon&#151;a significant figure in twentieth-century photography.<br>
