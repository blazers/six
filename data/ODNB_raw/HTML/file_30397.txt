<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Almond,  Hely Hutchinson</span>  (1832&#150;1903), <span class="occ">headmaster</span>, born in Glasgow on 12 August 1832, was the second son of George Almond, incumbent of St Mary's Episcopal Chapel, Glasgow, and his second wife, Christiana Georgina, eldest daughter of Thomas Smith, barrister, of London. His paternal great-grandfather was headmaster of Derby School, and his maternal great-grandfather was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/12882/', "John Hely-Hutchinson")</script>, provost of Trinity College, Dublin. Precociously clever, he began to learn his letters at sixteen months, and by the age of three was struggling with the multiplication table. After attending the collegiate school, Glasgow, in 1845 he entered the University of Glasgow. At the end of the session he gained the Cowan gold medal in the Blackstone Latin examination, and he also specially distinguished himself in the Greek, mathematics, and logic classes.<br>
<br>Having been elected in 1850 to a Snell exhibition, Almond proceeded to Balliol College, Oxford, where he obtained a first class in both classical and mathematical moderations, but, owing to ill health and other causes, gained only a second in the final examinations. He graduated BA in 1855 and MA in 1862. Almond's experience of Oxford was ambiguous; his impression of his tutors was not entirely favourable, and he underwent a period of religious apathy, which he later lamented. But his experience of college athletics (he rowed in the Balliol eight) made him an admirer of the English system of education for the upper classes with its emphasis on the training of character.<br>
<br>Almond had, however, no immediate vocation for teaching and became a schoolmaster rather by chance. In 1855 he left Oxford for Torquay, where his father was living in retirement; and it was only after failing to gain a position in the Indian Civil Service that he took his first teaching post. A friend who ran a private tutorial establishment sought Almond's help, and during this temporary appointment Almond acquired an enthusiasm for teaching. In 1857 he took up the offer of a tutorship at Loretto School at Musselburgh, near Edinburgh, made to him by Charles Langhorne, a Balliol contemporary, whose father founded the school. In 1858 he became second master at Merchiston Castle School, Edinburgh, where he took an active part in rugby football and introduced an English professional to instruct the boys in cricket.<br>
<br>In 1862, following the death of his father, Almond purchased Loretto School from the Langhorne family. It was then chiefly a preparatory school, and he began with only fourteen boys. In his early years there the financial prospects were bleak, but he gradually built up the school and by the end of the century Loretto had become recognized as a leading public school, catering for boys up to university entry. Almond's position as headmaster and proprietor gave him the opportunity to pursue his own distinctive educational aims. Pupil numbers never reached 150, which enabled him always to know every boy personally, and allowed him to evolve his guiding principle of rule by persuasion, not by force. &#145;Relations between master and boys were unusually sincere, and the place had rather the aspect of a family than a school&#146;  (Mackenzie, 160).<br>
<br>At Loretto, Almond pioneered the idea of systematic physical exercise and the cultivation of physical hardiness as essential to a healthy adolescence. He attached cardinal importance to fresh air, personal cleanliness, proper and regular diet, the regulation of the hours of sleep and study, and physical exercise in all weathers. Dormitory windows were left open at night, cold baths were the rule, and boys were forbidden to eat between meals. Participation in physical activity was compulsory. Almond also implemented his firm views on rational dress: instead of linen shirts and collars and close-fitting suits, boys wore loose-textured tweed knickerbocker suits and flannel shirts open at the neck, and changed into flannels for all forms of strenuous exercise. Almond's system fostered extraordinary stamina, as testified by the large proportion of Loretto boys who went on to gain athletic distinction at Oxford and Cambridge.<br>
<br>Almond publicized his views on physical nurture widely, acknowledging the influence at various times of Archibald Maclaren, Herbert Spencer, and John Ruskin. His biographer described his system as informed by a &#145;Sparto-Christian ideal&#146;  (Mackenzie, 247). A lay member of the Episcopalian church, having recovered his faith during his father's final illness, Almond published three volumes of school sermons. A chapel was erected at Loretto to mark his marriage in 1876 to Eleanora Frances, daughter of H. B. Tristram, canon of Durham. His views on the miraculous aspects of Christianity and the divinity of Christ were considerably altered under the influence of T. H. Huxley's writings, and he cannot be simply classified as a muscular Christian. Although, like other headmasters, he promoted team games because they encouraged unselfishness (see his article entitled &#145;Football as a moral agent&#146;, <span class="italic">Nineteenth Century</span>, 1893), he did not see games primarily as a means either of controlling boys or of moralizing them; rather, they were part of his &#145;gospel of good health&#146;  (Mangan, 54), which owed much to physiological Darwinism. Almond's ideas, which he described in his evidence to the royal commission on physical training (Scotland) (1903), became fashionable in the early twentieth century, in the context of contemporary anxieties about physical deterioration; in particular, his belief in the importance of fresh air anticipated the methods later used in the prevention and cure of consumption.<br>
<br>Almond's influence on the educational world was more limited, and the phenomenon of &#145;Lorettonianism&#146; with which Almond was associated found few imitators. A critic of examinations, he spoke of developing in boys an independent interest in study. But his hostility to &#145;cramming&#146; knowledge was not matched by much positive enthusiasm for alternative forms of intellectual activity&#151;indeed, Almond disliked bookishness&#151;and led in practice to low academic standards; and although an innovator in physical education, he was notably slow to develop science teaching. He spoke much of promoting individuality and of his aversion to uniformity, custom, and convention; yet there is little evidence that under his headmastership Loretto avoided the tendency to conformity which was characteristic of public schools of the period. It has been commented that Almond's &#145;crusade for independence of mind and rational living often appeared to be little more than a preference for open-necked flannel shirts and cold dormitories&#146;  (Roach, 189).<br>
<br>Almond was made an honorary LLD of Glasgow University in 1886. He died of a bronchial condition, after a few years of failing health, at his home, North Esk Lodge, Musselburgh, on 7 March 1903, and was buried in the churchyard at Inveresk. His wife survived him; they had three sons and three daughters.<br>
