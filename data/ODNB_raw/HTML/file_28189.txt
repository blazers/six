<span class="headword">Venn,  Richard</span>  (1691&#150;1739), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and religious controversialist</span>, the eldest and only surviving son of Dennis Venn (<i>d</i>. 1695), vicar of Holbeton, Devon, and his second wife, Patience Gay (<i>d</i>. 1712), was born at Holbeton on 7 January 1691. The family had a strong clerical tradition and his grandfather, the vicar of Otterton, had been one of the most prominent west country sufferers for his loyalty to the crown during the civil war. As a result of an injury suffered in childhood Venn could walk only with pain and difficulty, but his intrepid spirit and intellectual abilities remained unimpaired. After attending school at Modbury he went on to Blundell's in Tiverton&#151;a contemporary here was Bampfylde Moore Carew&#151;and thence, in 1709, to Cambridge, where he took up a closed scholarship at Sidney Sussex, graduating BA in 1713 and proceeding MA in 1716.<br>
<br>Venn moved to London and was ordained deacon in 1716 and priest in 1717; he became curate at St Giles Cripplegate, where the rector, Dr Thomas Bennet, was a noted high-churchman. In 1725 he became rector of St Antholin's, Watling Street, retaining a sinecure appointment worth &pound;130 p.a. at St Giles's. He was also a preacher at Paul's Cross. His attitude towards the Hanoverian succession was ambiguous. He was not a nonjuror, but his tract <span class="italic">King George's Title Asserted</span> (1715), written in an attempt to persuade Thomas Baker to take the oaths, was argued without conviction. In 1716 he married Maria Anna Isabella Margaretta Beatrix (<i>d</i>. 1762), a god-daughter of Queen Mary of Modena and daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/774/', "John Ashton (d. 1691)")</script>, the Jacobite executed for his part in the Preston plot in 1691. With her came several Stuart relics, which remained in the Venn family for generations, including a snuffbox made from a fragment of the Boscobel oak, a piece of the garter sash worn by King Charles I at his execution, and a picture of King James III. They had eight children, of whom four died in infancy or childhood. One son, Edward (1717&#150;80), attended St John's College, Cambridge, and practised medicine at Ipswich; another was the evangelical minister <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28184/', "Henry Venn (1725&#150;1797)")</script>. Venn was a stern father, of whom family tradition related that &#145;the system of Solomon he preferred to that of Rousseau&#146;  (J. Venn, 53), but he was also fair and affectionate, blessing his children at the end of every day.<br>
<br>Venn was an influential figure. He formed close friendships with Bishop Edmund Gibson and with the high tory MP John Barnard, lord mayor of London in 1737, and he was a prominent member of a metropolitan circle of high-church clergy that included William Berriman and Henry Stebbing. A consistent opponent of the dissenters, whom he equated with the rebellious sectarians of the 1640s, he resisted proposals to repeal the <span class="roman">Corporation and Test Acts</span> and wept when the <span class="roman">Mortmain Act</span> was passed in 1736. He attacked Daniel Neal's <span class="italic">History of the Puritans</span> (1732&#150;8); led the successful campaign to prevent the latitudinarian Thomas Rundle from becoming bishop of Gloucester in 1734; called Conyers Middleton an &#145;apostate priest&#146;; and was the first London clergyman to refuse his pulpit to George Whitefield, the Methodist, in 1737.<br>
<br>Venn died in London from smallpox on 16 February 1739, and was buried at St Antholin's. During his later years his views found frequent expression in the high-church <span class="italic">Weekly Miscellany</span>, edited by William Webster. His last published work, an anti-Methodist letter, appeared in that journal less than a week before his death. This and other letters, together with an extensive selection of his miscellaneous writings, was published by his widow under the title <span class="italic">Tracts and Sermons</span> (1740).<br>
