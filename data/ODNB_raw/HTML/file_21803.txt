<span class="headword">Pell, Sir  Watkin Owen</span>  (1788&#150;1869), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, was son of Samuel Pell of Sywell Hall, Wellingborough, Northamptonshire, and his wife, Mary, daughter of Owen Owen of Denbighshire. He entered the navy in April 1799 on board the <i>Loire</i>, and on 6 February 1800 lost his left leg in the capture of the French frigate <i>Pallas</i>, supported by a gun battery on one of the Seven Islands. He was consequently discharged, and remained on shore for the next two years, at the end of which time he rejoined the <i>Loire</i>. After serving in various ships on the home and West Indian stations, he was promoted, on 11 November 1806, lieutenant of the frigate <i>Mercury</i>, then on the Newfoundland station, and afterwards in the Mediterranean. Here, as first lieutenant in command of the <i>Mercury</i>'s boats, he repeatedly distinguished himself in capturing gunboats or small armed vessels on the coast of Spain or Italy, and on one occasion, on 1 April 1809, he was severely wounded in the right arm.<br>
<br>In August 1809 Pell was presented by the Patriotic Society with &pound;80 for the purchase of a sword, and on 29 March 1810 he was promoted commander. In the following October he was appointed to the bomb-vessel <i>Thunder</i>, and was, during the next two years, mainly employed in the defence of Cadiz. On 9 October 1813, as he was returning to England to be paid off, he fell in with and, after a sharp engagement, captured the privateer <i>Neptune</i>, of much superior force, for which, and other good service, he was advanced to post rank, on 1 November 1813. From 1814 to 1817 he commanded the frigate <i>Menai</i> on the coast of North America. In May 1833 he commissioned the <i>Forte</i>, and in her acted as senior officer on the Jamaica station until March 1837. On his return to England he was knighted by the queen, and, in accordance with the intention of William IV, was nominated a KCH by the king of Hanover. In 1839 he was offered a seat at the Board of Admiralty, if he was prepared to stand the cost of an election, &pound;100&#150;&pound;1500, by the political manager of the Admiralty, Admiral Sir J. W. D. Dundas. He declined. In 1840 he was appointed to the <i>Howe</i>, and in August 1841 to be superintendent of Deptford victualling yard, from which he was shortly afterwards moved to be superintendent of Sheerness Dockyard, and in December to be superintendent of Pembroke dockyard, where he remained until February 1845. In 1846 he was appointed a commissioner of the Royal Naval Hospital at Greenwich. In 1847 he married Sarah Dorothea, daughter of Edward Owen, of Maesmynan; she survived her husband.<br>
<br>Pell became a rear-admiral on 5 September 1848, and was offered, but did not accept, an active command in 1849 by Admiral Dundas. He became vice-admiral on 28 December 1855, and admiral on 11 February 1861. He died at his residence, the Queen's House, Greenwich, London, on 29 December 1869. A brave and resourceful junior officer who earned his promotions, and a favourite of William IV, Pell was independently wealthy and was patronized by his Northamptonshire neighbours, the Spencer family, to whom he was devoted. They secured his appointment to Deptford and Greenwich, the latter through Lord John Russell. He proved a competent administrator.<br>
