<span class="headword">Birnie,  William</span>  (1563&#150;1619), <span class="occ">Church of Scotland minister</span>, was the only son of William Birnie (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1565) of Birnie, probably a merchant, and his wife, Margaret Fraser of Philorth (later named Fraserburgh), mistress of the mint under Mary, queen of Scots. He was educated at the University of St Andrews from 1584, graduating MA in 1588, and was subsequently a student of divinity (<i>c</i>.1592&#150;5) at the University of Leiden.<br>
<br>Birnie had returned to Scotland by 25 January 1596, at which date he was an expectant minister of the presbytery of Edinburgh. It was probably during this period that he married Elizabeth, daughter of John Lindsay, minister of Carstairs, in the presbytery of Lanark. The couple had two daughters and three sons, the eldest of whom, John, was born in 1600. Elizabeth's uncle Robert Lindsay was minister of Lanark, and on his death in December 1597 Birnie succeeded to his benefice.<br>
<br>Birnie was a commissioner to the general assembly of 1602, and was appointed master and economus of the hospital and almshouse of St Leonard's, Lanark, the following year. In 1606 he accepted the office of constant moderator of the presbytery of Lanark, and as commissioner to the assemblies of 1608 and 1610 he supported the king's further plans to impose an episcopal polity on the kirk. Such support did not go unnoticed, and in 1609 Archbishop John Spottiswood of Glasgow recommended &#145;his Majesties favour &hellip; to Mr William Birnie &hellip; whose dispositioun your Lordship kens to his Majesties service&#146;  (Calderwood, 7.8). Birnie served on the court of high commission for the province of Glasgow from 1610, and was reappointed when the two courts were united in 1615. In 1612 his efforts were rewarded with an appointment to the benefice of Ayr, because the king had &#145;a mynd to prefer him also to be Deane of our Chapell Royall [at Stirling]&#146;, and &#145;Air is a church thereupon depending&#146;  (Botfield, 1.282). Within two years, however, James had resolved to unite the latter office with the bishopric of Galloway, and Birnie was required to surrender the deanery in return for the revenues of the vicarages of Ayr and Alloway.<br>
<br>A man of many parts Birnie was the author of <span class="italic">The Blame of Kirk-Buriall, Tending to Perswade Cemeteriall Civilitie</span> (1606), a work which deprecated interment within the kirk. He was also an athlete and swordsman of some renown, who&#151;besides &#145;being obliged many times&#146; to step between feuding parishioners&#151;&#145;was so agile that he could make the salmon's leap by stretching himself on the grass [and] leaping to his feet&#146;  (<span class="italic">Fasti Scot.</span>, 3.7).<br>
<br>Inevitably, Birnie's support for royal policy attracted the ire of the presbyterian party within the kirk, and accusations that he sought preferment and worldly comforts at the expense of others were not entirely unjustified. It was certainly true that his various pensions augmented his stipend by &pound;1000 Scots. Yet, as with the tiends of Alloway, little of the income reached his purse. Despite such criticisms Birnie was highly regarded by his congregation as a &#145;pleasant [and] pious&#146; minister, who was &#145;charitable, even above his estate&#146;. The elegiac notion that he &#145;waited on his charge with care and pains, At Air, on little hope and smaller gains&#146;  (<span class="italic">Fasti Scot.</span>, 3.7) was probably a more accurate reflection of his pastoral concern and personal wealth. He died at Ayr on 19 January 1619.<br>
