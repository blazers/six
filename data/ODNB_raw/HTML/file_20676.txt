<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Oldenburg,  Henry <span class="st"> [Heinrich]</span></span>  (<em>c.</em>1619&#150;1677), <span class="occ">scientific correspondent and secretary of the Royal Society</span>, was born in the free city of Bremen, Germany, one of two children of Heinrich Oldenburg (<i>d</i>. 1634), a teacher at the Bremen <i>Paedegogium</i> and later a professor at Dorpat University. His ancestors, originally from M&uuml;nster, had been Calvinist teachers since the mid-sixteenth century. Oldenburg's grandfather, also Heinrich, had repaired the buildings of the vicaria of St Liborius at the protestant cathedral, in return for which he, his son, and his grandson inherited an annual income of 100 reichsthaler, which was paid only fitfully and precariously.<h2>
<a name="Developingyears"></a>Developing years</h2>Oldenburg began his education at the <i>Paedegogium</i> where his father taught, and transferred in May 1633 to the <i>Gymnasium illustre</i> for a thorough grounding in religion, classical languages, the liberal arts, and theology; he received the degree of master of theology on 2 November 1639 for a thesis on relations between church and state. In May 1641 he left Bremen for the Netherlands with letters of introduction to various scholars. (He was perhaps influenced by the fact that his sister was about to marry Heinrich Koch, a relation of Johannes Koch, or Coccejus, professor of theology at Leiden.) Oldenburg settled briefly in Utrecht, which possessed a lively university where Cartesianism was taught. However, he found Utrecht expensive and began in August to look for employment &#145;instructing either the son of a nobleman or the son of some honest merchant&#146;  (<span class="italic">Correspondence</span>, 1.3&#150;6). For the next twelve years he travelled on the continent and in England as tutor to a succession of young men, mostly English, with both royalist and parliamentary connections, as indicated by surviving drafts of letters in his commonplace book. His aim was not only to earn his living but to learn about relations between church and state and to see the world. In all of this he was clearly very successful, becoming fluent in the languages of the countries he visited. He met many Englishmen living abroad, notably John Durie and John Pell, with both of whom he later had connections.<br>
<br>In the later spring of 1653 Oldenburg visited Bremen, probably to try to secure the title to his vicaria. The city was suffering from the effects of the First Anglo-Dutch War, which put at risk its all-important merchant fleet, and the senate was about to appoint an envoy to England to negotiate recognition of Bremen's neutrality. Oldenburg secured the post on 30 June 1653. He arrived in England in late July and began negotiations promptly, though inconclusively, as he told the Bremen senate; in any case the war ceased in the next spring. Soon afterwards the senate asked him to beg Cromwell to intercede between the Swedes and the city: Oldenburg found Cromwell favourably disposed and a strong letter was written to Sweden, but with little result. However, the mission proved very profitable to Oldenburg himself, not in money but in a growing acquaintance with English politicians and scholars, particularly with Milton, who admitted him into his personal circle, which included Lady Katherine Ranelagh and her young brother Robert Boyle. All seem to have found Oldenburg an attractive man, and Milton wrote approvingly that he had &#145;learnt to speak our language more accurately and fluently than any other foreigner I have ever known&#146;  (<span class="italic">Correspondence</span>, 1.34). During most of 1654 and 1655 Oldenburg lived in Kent with the Honywood family, to one of whom he had acted as tutor; he kept in touch with many former charges while looking for another post. This search ended with his appointment in 1656 to supervise Richard Jones (1641&#150;1712), son of Viscount and Lady Ranelagh, first at Oxford and then abroad.<h2>
<a name="Therisetoprominence"></a>The rise to prominence</h2>In resuming his career as tutor Oldenburg sacrificed his independence but cemented his relations with Robert Boyle, his lifelong patron; developed a keen interest in natural philosophy; and learned how to elicit information from new acquaintances and how to maintain a scientific correspondence. When he went to Oxford with Jones for some reason he &#145;entred [<i>sic</i>] as a Student&#146;, as Anthony Wood put it  (<span class="italic">Athenae Oxoniensis</span>, 1721, 2.114), under the designation of &#145;nobilis Saxo&#146;&#151;a curious act of self-aggrandizement, for though he could fairly call himself a Saxon he was never a noble. He supervised his pupil while at the same time educating himself in natural philosophy by frequenting on terms of equality the circle centred around John Wilkins, whom he had already met in London. This circle included Boyle, John Wallis, Seth Ward, Dr Jonathan Goddard, Thomas Willis, Christopher Wren, Richard Lower, and Robert Hooke, who was then assistant to, successively, Willis and Boyle&#151;all men who, as Oldenburg told a Dutch friend, &#145;are followers of nature itself and truth&#146;  (<span class="italic">Correspondence</span>, 1.89&#150;92). He quickly absorbed their spirit and appreciated their activities, and was able to understand their achievements. Boyle admitted Oldenburg to his confidence, allowing him to copy out some drafts of essays that were not to be published for some years.<br>
<br>In May 1657 Oldenburg and Jones left for what became a three-year sojourn on the continent. They settled in Saumur, which they chose for its protestantism and its educational establishments. Thence Oldenburg wrote to Milton about theological controversies, to Boyle about chemistry and the natural philosophers he met, and to Hartlib about practical matters. The next spring he and Jones undertook a five-month tour of Germany: they visited courts and universities, meeting physicians, alchemists, mechanicians, the nobility, and minor royalty with equal interest and aplomb, Oldenburg having obviously mastered the art of extracting information from all whom he met. They were welcomed everywhere and Oldenburg reported carefully to Boyle and Hartlib what they would wish to learn about natural philosophy and mechanics. They spent the winter in the south of France, again meeting natural philosophers in academies and universities and being welcomed warmly.<br>
<br>In 1659 Oldenburg and Jones travelled via La Rochelle to Paris; they arrived in March and stayed for over a year. Here life duplicated that of the previous winter. Oldenburg saw that his pupil received instruction in the polite arts and in varied intellectual activities. Academies had proliferated in Paris in the early seventeenth century and Oldenburg soon sought out those devoted to natural philosophy, especially the famous Montmor Academy, in whose animated discussions and scientific debates he participated fully. His descriptions sent to Boyle and his friends in the south of France are vivid accounts of the intellectual life of Paris at this time. During this period he matured as a virtuoso and mastered the art of scientific communication. He frequented libraries and reported on their contents, beginning the familiarity with publications that was later to enable him to act as a book agent.<br>
<br>In May 1660 Oldenburg and Jones were summoned home, and arrived in time for Charles II's triumphant entry into London. Although both religion and acquaintances had inclined Oldenburg to parliamentarian government, like most of his friends (except Milton) he fully accepted the Restoration government. But he now had no settled employment and it is not obvious how he lived. Presumably he worked for Boyle, who was always his patron and for whom he was soon acting as translator. On 28 November 1660 the organizational meeting of what was to become the Royal Society of London was held, and Oldenburg's name was on the list of potential members. He was soon formally elected, and he played an active role [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/59221', "Founder members of the Royal Society")</script>].<br>
<br>In the summer of 1661 Oldenburg took a month's continental trip. He went briefly to Bremen and then to Holland, where he visited friends in Amsterdam and Leiden; in the latter city he saw relatives and met and conversed with Spinoza, after which he went to The Hague to renew acquaintance with Christiaan Huygens, whom he had already met in London. An important result was a well-known correspondence with Spinoza, with whom Oldenburg discussed theology and natural philosophy, in the latter field with the assistance of Boyle whose approach to the subject he adopted and fully supported. (The correspondence was first published in Spinoza's <span class="italic">Opera posthuma</span>, 1677.) Oldenburg continued to act as purveyor of news to Boyle, as he was to do throughout his life. He became &#145;publisher&#146; (acting as intermediary between author and printer) of many of Boyle's books, as signed prefaces show, and translator of many into Latin for the continental market. Boyle paid him at agreed rates, which was a source of income for his lifetime.<br>
<br>In July 1662 the Royal Society came officially into existence and acquired a formal structure with the granting of a royal charter. Oldenburg was named as a member of council and one of the two secretaries, and the structure was reinforced the next spring with the grant of a second charter. The charters specifically gave permission for the society (through the secretaries) to correspond freely at home and abroad, while newly enacted statutes specified that a secretary must attend all meetings, take minutes, attend to correspondence, and maintain the society's &#145;books&#146; (its records). Oldenburg was to be the only active secretary: immensely hard-working and a brilliant correspondent, he was soon to symbolize the much admired Royal Society in the eyes of learned foreigners. Because he was so conscientious the bulk of his correspondence survives, showing its range and scope (both large) and revealing much about the state of natural philosophy of the time in England. Like Pepys, Oldenburg was a skilful administrator, holding the society together and helping to make it work: going to meetings whose content he helped to organize and supply; conferring regularly with his working colleagues, often in coffee houses, between meetings; proposing foreign fellows; and directing the amanuensis who acted as his copying clerk. All this was without pay, and he began to think of making money by purveying news, a plan that was brought into being a few years later.<br>
<br>On 22 October 1663 Oldenburg married Dorothy West (<i>c</i>.1623&#150;1665), &#145;aged about 40 and a mayden of her owne Disposing&#146; as the marriage licence states, declaring himself to be &#145;aged about 43 yeares&#146;. Nothing is known about the bride except that her trustees were two baronets and she possessed a dowry of &pound;400. The couple set up house in Pall Mall, very near Lady Ranelagh (but not in the lodgings that Oldenburg had used previously). They soon acquired a family in the shape of John Durie's daughter, Dora Katherina (1654&#150;1677), officially a ward of the London church of Austin Friars. As the child possessed property, presumably Oldenburg's income then increased. His wife died at the beginning of February 1665 and thereupon he very properly requested the elders of the church to make other arrangements for Dora Katherina Durie, and this seems to have been done. Although he then received the remainder of his wife's dowry it soon vanished in necessary expenses.<br>
<br>Oldenburg now decided to bring his plans for a news sheet to fruition. In the spring of 1665 he instituted his <span class="italic">Philosophical Transactions</span>, which was intended to incorporate news derived partly from his correspondence and partly from the activities of the Royal Society, with, soon, reviews of scientific books. It is the oldest continuous scientific journal: though the <span class="italic">Journal des S&ccedil;avans</span> preceded it by a few weeks, this was primarily a book-reviewing journal, and not predominantly devoted to natural philosophy. The <span class="italic">Philosophical Transactions</span>, as his private venture, brought Oldenburg fame but never much income (seldom as much as &pound;40 a year). So great was the demand abroad that four volumes by different translators appeared in Latin (1666&#150;9), a partial French edition was made for the use of the Acad&eacute;mie Royale des Sciences, and an Italian edition was published in 1729. Publication was disrupted by the outbreak of plague in London&#151;the court and much of the society dispersed, while Oldenburg stayed in the city, dealing with public and private business, his only precaution being to smoke a pipe of tobacco every evening.<br>
<br>In 1666, when life returned to normal in London as the plague diminished, the Royal Society's meetings resumed and Oldenburg's life also went on as before. He had now acquired financial support from Sir Joseph Williamson of the state paper office, who, with the outbreak of the Second Anglo-Dutch War (February 1665), was anxious to acquire knowledge of French and Dutch public opinion and, as a loyal fellow of the Royal Society, to assist its hard-working secretary. The arrangement was that Oldenburg should have a postal address, Mr or Monsr Grubendol, which ensured that all letters so addressed went direct to Williamson's office; Williamson then paid the postage and had the unopened letters delivered by hand to Oldenburg. The latter copied out any political or military news and gossip and sent this to Williamson.<br>
<br>Besides saving the cost of postage, this work, together with the translation of intercepted letters in Germanic languages, earned Oldenburg some unspecified but useful income. It was, however, the cause of personal misfortune: on 20 June 1667, a fortnight after the public disaster of a Dutch raid on the Medway and Chatham, Oldenburg was closely imprisoned in the Tower of London by order of Lord Arlington, secretary of state and thus Williamson's superior. He was accused of &#145;dangerous desseins and practices&#146;  (<span class="italic">Correspondence</span>, 3.448) or, as Pepys noted in his diary (24 June 1667), of &#145;writing news to a Virtuoso in France&#146;. He repeatedly expressed his innocence and insisted that it was patriotism alone that led him to regret that the war had gone so badly from &#145;oversights and omissions some where&#146;  (<span class="italic">Correspondence</span>, 3.448). Arlington was much blamed for the failure of his intelligence service to forewarn the English navy of Dutch plans, and, perhaps genuinely ignorant of the arrangements with Williamson, seems to have used Oldenburg as a scapegoat, not releasing him until 26 August 1667.<h2>
<a name="Theyearsofachievement"></a>The years of achievement</h2>Bravely Oldenburg returned to his usual duties, finding that almost all his acquaintances and correspondents responded as usual, the sole exception being his neighbour Dr Thomas Sydenham. His correspondence soon even increased in volume, diversity, and importance; he was described in 1668 by Glanvill as &#145;render[ing] himself a great Benefactor of Mankind by his affectionate care, and indefatigable diligence and endeavours in maintaining Philosophical Intelligence, and promoting Philosophy&#146;  (Glanvill, 103). For the last ten years of his life Oldenburg's unremitting correspondence kept him fully occupied, except for the need to earn a decent income. Unfortunately the <span class="italic">Philosophical Transactions</span> never sold as well as he had hoped; he had to give away many copies, and the printers were exigent. In 1668 he began a campaign to secure a salary from the Royal Society in view of his many duties, and appealed to Boyle and others. That year the society voted him a gift only of &pound;50, but the next year relented and voted an annual salary of &pound;40.<br>
<br>Oldenburg continued to supply news to Williamson and to publish and translate for Boyle, particularly in 1670 and 1671. He also began publishing for others, notably the Italian comparative anatomist and microscopist Malpighi, from whose letters he compiled books. He translated and published works by Fran&ccedil;ois Bernier and A. Piganius (1671), and attached Steno's <span class="italic">Prodromus</span> to Boyle's <span class="italic">Essays of Effluviums</span> (1673). He continued to hope for patronage and in 1676 Williamson secured him a place as licensor of books on history; sadly he proved too conscientious for the post and resigned it after three months, partly because of complaints against him, more because of the work involved.<br>
<br>The increased need for income arose from Oldenburg's second marriage, at the age of about fifty, to Dora Katherina Durie, in August 1668. According to the marriage licence she was aged sixteen, but her father's friend John Pell declared she was only fourteen years and three months. In any case, she married with her father's consent. By the marriage Oldenburg secured the income of his wife's property, two farms (Battens and Wansunt) near Dartford Heath, Bexley, Kent, said to bring in &pound;60 a year, where family holidays were to be spent regularly. Children followed&#151;Sophia (<i>b</i>. 1672) and Rupert (1675&#150;1724).<br>
<br>A portrait by Jan van Cleef in the Royal Society, dated 1668 and said since at least 1804 to be of Oldenburg, shows a vigorous man with dark and wavy hair to his shoulders and a small moustache, in dark clothes and bands (he must have been in minor orders), with the habitual frown of a conscientious and short-sighted man. Brought up in the Calvinist faith and deeply pious, with a devout personal religion and a keen interest in millenarianism, he was no bigot; he publicly conformed to the <span class="roman">Test Act</span> of 1673, which demanded a firm Anglicanism, as he did again in 1677 in order to apply for naturalization (which was granted on 6 April).<br>
<br>During all the upheavals of his private life, Oldenburg continued to work for the good of the Royal Society and of natural philosophy. By now he had perfected his techniques: he had learned how to encourage talent (as his support and promotion of such men as Malpighi, Flamsteed, Leeuwenhoek, Leibniz, De Graaf, Martin Lister, and others show). Equally significant was his ability to persuade men reluctant to publish to permit him to insert their papers in his <span class="italic">Philosophical Transactions</span> and to continue to do so even when this provoked controversy. The most important example is undoubtedly that of Newton. From 1671 to 1677 he painstakingly coaxed the at first little-known Lucasian professor to submit his papers on optics to the Royal Society, then to permit their publication in his journal, and finally to respond to criticisms by those who could not accept his conclusions or repeat his experiments. It was a triumph of diplomatic skill of the greatest benefit to the world of natural philosophy. Just as important was Oldenburg's treatment of those few examples of his mathematical skill that Newton reluctantly released to him, culminating in the energetic exchanges with Leibniz in 1676&#150;7. This involved Oldenburg in the tedious and difficult copying out of many pages of complex mathematical text, which indicates incidentally that he could follow advanced mathematics and perhaps even understand it.<br>
<br>From 1668 Oldenburg was Huygens's principal correspondent in England, giving him news of the Royal Society's affairs (Huygens had been a fellow since 1663), serving as an intermediary on mathematical subjects between him and Sluse of Li&egrave;ge, as on optical subjects between him and Newton. Oldenburg and Huygens had become good friends, so much so that in 1675 the latter offered any possible English patent for his newly invented spring-regulated watch either to the society or to Oldenburg. Brouncker, as president, resigned the potential advantages to Oldenburg, who promptly drafted a petition for a patent (which was never granted). Hooke, who claimed that he had long since invented the application of springs to regulate watches (but had never made one) was furious, and with his usual fertile ingenuity designed such a watch for which he now claimed a patent, insisting that Oldenburg had &#145;betrayed&#146; him by telling Huygens of it&#151;which was not the case (and Hooke's idea had appeared in print in any case). Twelve years of friendly association of two colleagues were forgotten and Hooke denounced Oldenburg bitterly, becoming more vindictive after the Royal Society's council supported his rival; he was to pursue his enmity even after Oldenburg's death. It was a bitter and troublesome episode. Historians have often accepted Hooke's view that Oldenburg was at fault, but it is difficult to see why&#151;most of his colleagues and correspondents found him open, friendly, accommodating, tactful, and fair.<br>
<br>Oldenburg seems to have been generally healthy, with no more episodes of illness than normal. According to Hooke's diary he was seriously ill on 3 September 1677 &#145;with ague&#146;; two days later he was dead, &#145;being striken speechless and senseless&#146;. His death probably occurred at home in Pall Mall, London, though he was buried at St Mary the Virgin, Bexley, on 7 September. His young widow died on 17 September and was buried the next day in London.<br>
