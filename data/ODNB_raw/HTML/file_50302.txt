<span class="headword">Rees,  Walter Enoch</span>  (1863&#150;1949), <span class="occ">rugby administrator</span>, was born at 6 East Side of London Road, Neath, Glamorgan, on 13 April 1863, the second of the six children of Joseph Cook Rees (1833&#150;1883), builder and contractor, and his wife, Margaret, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Howell (1837&#150;1930). After schooling in Neath and Barnstaple he entered the family business in Neath and on 18 September 1898 married Elizabeth Leith Peters (1872&#150;1944), the youngest daughter of George Peters of Aberdeen. Their only child, Walter Douglas Rees, was born on 28 June 1901.<br>
<br>Rees served on the Welsh Rugby Union (WRU) for fifty-nine years. A freemason, a Conservative, and an Anglican, he was hardly typical of most of the players who came under his jurisdiction. His career in rugby administration began in 1888, when he became secretary and treasurer of Neath rugby club and promptly improved both its fixture list and its finances. He served in this dual capacity for only two years, since in 1889 he was elected on the match (that is, general) committee of the WRU. Unlike most sports administrators of that era he was not a former player himself, but his astuteness and attention to detail caught the eye. He was first proposed for the secretaryship of the union in 1891 and secured it in 1896. He went on to become the longest-serving secretary of any of the rugby unions, holding his post almost until his death.<br>
<br>When Rees took office the WRU numbered thirty-seven member clubs and international match receipts totalled &pound;1000; by the time he resigned in 1948 the corresponding figures were 104 clubs and &pound;9000. The first salaried official of the WRU, he brought a new professionalism to the running of its affairs and turned its lack of any proper office accommodation (a defect rectified only in 1956) to his own advantage. He ran Welsh rugby virtually single-handedly from his house, Norwood, Victoria Gardens, Neath, and became a national figure through being associated with the golden era of Welsh rugby, between 1900 and 1911, when the Welsh fifteen won six triple crowns and achieved a historic victory (in 1905) over the otherwise undefeated New Zealand All Blacks. He represented Wales on the International Rugby Board from 1896 to 1900, and in 1910 accompanied the British Isles rugby touring team to South Africa as assistant manager. Widely regarded, in the inter-war period in particular, as high-handed and dictatorial, for instance in his strict insistence on the letter of the law in reimbursing the travel expenses of working-class players while allowing &#145;varsity&#146; men much greater latitude, his ritual pre-match perambulation of the touchline with the chief constable on international days was the occasion for much banter from the crowd, not all of it friendly. He acquired a reputation for being a law unto himself in the execution of WRU business, and the little black pocket-book in which he noted the names of those he privileged with international match tickets acquired wide notoriety.<br>
<br>Rees was elected to Neath town council in 1900, became the town's mayor in 1905, and a JP in 1918. He continued on the local authority until 1919, serving on all the major committees. He was never narrowly sectarian in his sporting interests: in September 1893 he chaired the founding meeting of Neath association football club. But it was his renown in rugby affairs, coupled with his experience of local government, that led to his appointment in 1916 as recruiting officer for Neath and district. In recognition of his services the War Office conferred on him the rank of captain, which further confirmed his autocratic tendencies.<br>
<br>Captain Rees, as he liked to be known, clung tenaciously to the secretaryship of the WRU into the post-1945 era, but in a new bureaucratic and democratic world the former doyen of rugby administrators increasingly appeared to be an outmoded survivor from a bygone era. On 19 March 1948 he at last tendered his resignation, with effect from 30 June. He died on 6 June 1949 in Bridgend and District Hospital and was interred three days later in Llantwit Major in the Vale of Glamorgan.<br>
