<span class="headword">Haigh,  Emily Alice</span> <span class="st"> [<em>pseud. </em>Beatrice Hastings]</span>  (1879&#150;1943), <span class="occ">writer and journal editor</span>, was born at 115 King Edward Road, South Hackney, London, on 26 January 1879, the daughter of John Walter Haigh, wool dealer, and his wife, Catherine Jane, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Doorly. She was brought up in Port Elizabeth, Cape Colony, but was sent to school in Pevensey, Sussex, near Hastings, from which town she took the name she later used. She spent some time in France before moving to London, where she began to publish poems, stories, and literary essays in periodicals. Interested in the modern movements of her time&#151;including feminism, women's suffrage, and socialism&#151;Hastings met the editor and social reformer <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35322/', "Alfred Richard Orage (1873&#150;1934)")</script> when she attended a lecture he gave on theosophy in 1906.<br>
<br>Hastings and Orage fell in love and began a rather fraught affair which continued until 1914. There was evidently no question of marriage: Orage was already married and, however estranged from his wife, may well have been aware from the start of Hastings's volatile personality. Reputed to be a beauty, Hastings was an independent woman, financially secure, and familiar with the city in ways Orage initially was not. They soon began to live together, not only in London but during the summers at seaside resorts and, as Orage prospered, in several suburban homes. In 1907, when Orage took over as editor of the <span class="italic">New Age</span>&#151;a periodical which soon championed established as well as new, experimental writers&#151;Hastings joined the editorial staff and became a regular contributor. She published under her own name as well as anonymously and under a variety of pseudonyms (including Beatrice Tina, Alice Morning, Robert &agrave; Field, T. K. L., D. Triformis, Edward Stafford, S. Robert West, V. M., G. Whiz, J. Wilson, T. W., A. M. A., and Cynicus). Her submissions were informed and spirited, and ranged from poems and stories to letters, literary articles (over 200), and essays on feminism and social reform. In her autobiography, <span class="italic">The Old &#145;New Age&#146;: Orage&#151;and Others</span>, published in 1936 as a 42-page pamphlet by a small press, she took credit for discovering or arguing with Orage for the inclusion of such promising young writers as F. S. Flint and Ezra Pound. She worked closely with other members of the staff, among them Huntly Carter, J. M. Kennedy, and A. E. Randall.<br>
<br>By early 1914 Hastings's relationship with Orage had become, according to her autobiography, &#145;intolerable&#146;  (Hastings, 8), and that spring she left London for Paris. She immediately joined the flamboyant circle of artists in Montparnasse that included the Italian modernist painter Amedeo Modigliani (1884&#150;1920), with whom she fell in love. They lived together, first at his flat at 53 rue Montparnasse, then at her cottage at 13 rue Norvins. Their frequently violent affair, fuelled by alcohol and hashish, soured late in 1915; after a brief affair with Jean Cocteau's lover Raymond Radiguet, Hastings left Paris for the south of France. According to June Rose, Hastings served as a &#145;stimulant, irritant and catalyst&#146;  (Rose, 109) for Modigliani's work during this important period in his development, and he depicted Hastings in at least fourteen contemporary paintings and numerous sketches, not only as herself and his lover, but as Sappho and Mme de Pompadour. These pictures reveal Hastings as a compelling and dramatic woman. Clothed, she appears poised, with a small, proud head and long neck, her black hair pinned back in a low bun; nude, she is sometimes dishevelled, her nakedness emphasized by drapery that fails to cover her body. She continued to write for the <span class="italic">New Age</span> until 1920, contributing essays on pacifism, a sequence of short stories, and &#145;Impressions of Paris&#146;, a series of weekly articles that appeared for eighteen months. After the war she lived in both Paris and the south of France as well as in Switzerland, not returning to London until the early 1930s.<br>
<br>Generally quarrelsome, often drunk and unwell, Hastings squandered a large inheritance and became increasingly difficult and unreliable. Her highly emotional autobiography, which she described at the start as &#145;Extracts from an Introduction to &#147;Incidents in the Life of the old <i>New Age</i>, 1907 to 1916&#148;&#146;, a volume &#145;in preparation&#146;  (p. 1), is the only book she published. It is a painful and generally vitriolic account of her betrayal by former literary friends, top among them Orage himself, whom she pillories as a fraud, a bad writer, an incompetent editor, a stupid and grossly ungrateful one-time lover, a &#145;consummate schemer&#146;  (p. 15), and a &#145;maniac&#146;  (p. 29)&#151;an estimate in sharp contrast to the man of grace, charm, generosity, and good sense admired by all of those who wrote about him after his death in 1934.<br>
<br>Orage was not the only figure to receive such harsh and unfair criticism: Hastings portrayed Katherine Mansfield, another contributor to the <span class="italic">New Age</span>, as a pretentious and twittering would-be &#145;saint&#146;, who &#145;fouled&#146; the world &#145;wherever she went&#146;, while her writing was &#145;incredibly vulgar stuff&#146;  (p. 28). Hastings similarly accused Richard Aldington, an author Orage encouraged and whose third novel, <span class="italic">All Men are Enemies</span>, appeared in 1933, of stealing his title from one of her articles, &#145;Women's worst enemy, woman&#146;; she went on to lambast him as a &#145;silk-fingered, scratch-nailed, sob-stuffing, eaten-brained curate of the feminine soul&#146;  (p. 9).<br>
<br>The effect of Hastings's bitter autobiography is not finally comic, but both deeply disquieting and pathetic. She clearly felt wronged by the world, particularly by the English literary establishment, and above all by Orage himself, yet while she struggled to elicit the reader's sympathy, she demonstrated her own emotional instability and lack of judgement. In his revised edition of <span class="italic">A. R. Orage: a Memoir</span>, Philip Mairet admits that Hastings's book was embarrassing and outrageous, but refrains through kindness from arguing with her, stressing instead her competence as an editor in the formative years of the <span class="italic">New Age</span>.<br>
<br>Clearly unhappy and financially pressed, Hastings could in 1936 nevertheless declare proudly in her autobiography, &#145;I still love the social rebel, and challenge mere man-made laws &hellip; I am still the same crusading, anti-philistine woman I ever was&#146;  (p. 9). By the early 1940s, however, Hastings had failed to complete the book-length study she had initially projected, and was living in Worthing as the widow of a pugilist, Lachie Thomson. She made a will in mid-October 1943, leaving &#145;the whole of my household furniture from beds to tin tacks&#146; to a &#145;devoted friend&#146;, Doris Lillian Green, and her &#145;Literary Estate&#146; to the British Museum or &#145;the first Public Library that puts in a claim&#146;. On 31 October 1943 her dead body was discovered in her flat, 4 Bedford Row, Worthing, Sussex. At the inquest the coroner stated that she died as a result of asphyxia from carbon monoxide poisoning due to inhaling coal gas, and her death was officially registered &#145;as a suicide while mentally unhinged&#146;  (d. cert.). It seems likely, as stipulated in her will, that &#145;no Service whatever&#146; was held and that Hastings was cremated; Green also probably followed Hastings's explicit instructions to throw her ashes &#145;down a hill, or in a field&#146;.<br>
