<span class="headword">Stradling, Sir  Edward</span>, second baronet  (<em>bap. </em>1600, <em>d.</em> 1644), <span class="occ">speculator and royalist army officer</span>, was baptized at St Donat's Church, St Donats, Glamorgan, on 9 November 1600, the eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26628/', "Sir John Stradling, first baronet (1563&#150;1637)")</script> of St Donats and his wife, Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1640), daughter and heir of Edward Gage of Firle, Sussex. His younger brothers included the Church of England clergyman <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26626/', "George Stradling")</script> and the royalist naval and army officer <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26627/', "Sir Henry Stradling")</script>.<br>
<br>Edward Stradling was born into one of the most powerful families in Glamorgan and followed his father into Brasenose College, Oxford, where he matriculated on 16 June 1615. About 1620 he married Mary (<i>d</i>. 1671), daughter of Sir Thomas Mansell of Margam, one of the leading squires in the county, and this alliance helped consolidate his local position. He assumed his place on the county bench in 1622 and was a deputy lieutenant by 1631. He also acted as a commissioner for both the forced loan and knighthood composition fines. Himself knighted by 1622, he inherited his father's baronetcy in 1637.<br>
<br>Stradling was involved in several business enterprises. He was one of those empowered by letters patent of February 1631 to bring water to London by an aqueduct from springs near Hoddesdon in Hertfordshire. Doubts were expressed on whether the project was feasible but Stradling and his associates defended it, and large sums of money raised by a lottery were directed towards the scheme. The aqueduct was not completed, however, and in May 1642 the House of Commons ordered that Stradling was to help repay the money given towards the project.<br>
<br>Stradling was a shareholder in the controversial monopoly for the manufacture of soap, granted under letters patent of 17 December 1631. The project received the consistent backing of the king and privy council throughout the 1630s; the Long Parliament, however, determined to redress such grievances, and Sir Edward was declared a delinquent on 17 August 1641 for his participation in the monopoly, and was summoned by the Commons on 30 October.<br>
<br>Stradling was also involved, along with the courtier Sir Lewis Dyve, in illegally exporting gold and silver. The men were called before the Star Chamber for this offence in June 1637 and must have been found guilty, given that Charles I subsequently issued a pardon for them.<br>
<br>Probably on account of his local military experience Stradling was made captain of a company of foot in the first bishops' war. He was subsequently elected to the Short Parliament as member for Glamorgan, and although appointed to the important committee of privileges, he made little impression in the house. He does not appear to have stood for election in November 1640, and there were reports of his being commanded out of the country &#145;on his Majesty's service&#146; in October 1640  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1640&#150;41</i>, 219). Stradling was experiencing considerable financial difficulties at this time, and in January 1641 his wife's relations were helping to cover debts amounting to nearly &pound;2000. His wife had to negotiate with one creditor in an effort to stop a petition being submitted to parliament to recover outstanding money. Stradling was also saved from arrest for debts to Captain John Roper through the intercession of William, Lord Paget and Sir Lewis Dyve, his associate in the affair of exporting gold and silver.<br>
<br>Parliament had done little to further Stradling's interests, and at the outbreak of civil war he was one of those most forward in supporting the king. Appointed a commissioner of array in Glamorgan, he quickly raised a regiment of foot numbering over 1000. In October 1642 Stradling instructed his wife to thank her relations at Margam for the donation of ten muskets, but even now discussion turned to how he hoped to discharge his debts &#145;as soon as these troublesome times are passed over&#146;  (Penrice and Margam MS L.68).<br>
<br>Appointed colonel, Stradling led his men into battle at Edgehill in October 1642. The Welsh recruits performed poorly, however, and Stradling was captured and imprisoned in Warwick Castle. He languished in confinement until May 1644, when Charles I secured his release through an exchange of prisoners. Stradling then made his way to Oxford, but fell ill there and died of fever on 20 June 1644. He was buried in the chapel of Jesus College the following day.<br>
