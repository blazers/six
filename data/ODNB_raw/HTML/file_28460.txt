<span class="headword">Waleys,  Henry  le</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1302), <span class="occ">merchant and mayor of London</span>, may have originated at Chepstow, Monmouthshire, but moved to London with other members of his family, including his brother Walter, who also became active in the city. Like many London merchants of his day Henry le Waleys dealt in a variety of goods, importing hides in 1267, and trading in cloth at St Ives fair in 1287. But he made his fortune as a vintner, dealing in exceptionally large quantities (300 tuns of St &Eacute;milion wine in 1284), and importing wine directly from Gascony. He came to be styled &#145;king's merchant&#146;, selling wine to the royal household from 1252 until the early 1280s, with sales whose yearly value averaged about &pound;100. This interest in the wine trade explains his involvement in an unsuccessful attempt to reduce brokers' charges on wine, and he was later accused by the men of other towns of having restricted to city freemen the right to sell wine in London during his mayoralty. Prosperity brought social advancement, which his marriage confirmed; his wife, Joan, daughter of William of Haddestock and Avice of Basing, and granddaughter of Adam of Basing (mayor of London 1251&#150;2), belonged to a family prominent in London since the early twelfth century. At his death he had property scattered all over London, including a house called Le Hales near London Bridge and a large mansion in Stepney, where a great council summoned by the king met in March 1299. He also owned property in Berwick and Boston, as well as the manor of Beckenham in Kent, and land in several other counties, including Somerset.<br>
<br>Waleys was one of the leading figures in the government of London in the late thirteenth century. After an unsuccessful attempt to become bailiff in 1265, he was alderman of Cordwainer ward from 1269 to 1294, sheriff in 1270&#150;71, and mayor in 1273&#150;4, 1281&#150;4, and 1298&#150;9. He represented London on several occasions, going to Paris in 1274 to consult with Edward I on his approaching coronation, and attending the Shrewsbury parliament of 1283. His first term as mayor was marked by action against former supporters of Simon de Montfort; in January 1274 he secured the annulment of the charters which Walter Hervey, who had dominated the city in the late 1260s, had granted to the craft guilds, and later engineered Hervey's final exclusion from public life. But his policy went far beyond the defence of traditional and vested interests. As mayor Waleys directed inquiries into and promulgated ordinances on various trades, including masons and carpenters, but above all those concerned with victualling&#151;he was clearly well aware of the connection between public order and the food supply. In his first mayoralty he had new vessels provided for the official and public measurement of corn, and in his second introduced the practice of dragging bakers convicted of fraud through the city streets on a hurdle. He was also responsible for ordinances creating a watch and keeping a check on strangers, while in 1283 he had a new prison, the Tun, built on Cornhill for curfew breakers and men caught in fornication. He expanded the paving of city streets in the direction of Westminster, and was instrumental in extending the wall of the city near Blackfriars. In 1282 he took decisive action towards the repair and maintenance of London Bridge by setting up a trust to finance it: the trust consisted of a new market for the victualling trades to the north of St Mary Woolchurch, known as The Stocks, and a housing development next to St Paul's Churchyard, on which Waleys later attempted to speculate for his own profit. He may also have had a role in the creation of the London Puy about 1300. His policies were backed by Edward I, but were unpopular with some Londoners, who considered that the city's franchise was being infringed, and in October 1284 Waleys lost the mayoralty. The government of the city was taken into the king's hand shortly afterwards, and the Londoners had to wait for a reversal of royal policy until 1297, when that year's political crisis led to the restoration of the city's liberties, along with the abolition of the Tun and of Waleys's edicts for the corn trade. In April 1298 the mayoralty was restored, and the Londoners elected Waleys, although he appears to have resigned his aldermanry four years earlier. The election was intended to placate the king, and Waleys was not re-elected the following year, but disappeared thereafter from the city's governing circle.<br>
<br>Waleys had already benefited from royal favour during the reign of Henry III, even though his record during the barons' wars was ambivalent. His connections with the court, and with Edmund, earl of Cornwall (<i>d</i>. 1300), in particular, enabled him to obtain exemption for life from all royal levies in 1266, and from being put on assizes and made sheriff against his will in 1267. He may have been knighted by the king in 1281; in 1283 he was given the wardship of John de Neville by the queen mother, Eleanor of Provence, and her cousin Amadeus, count of Savoy. He was also a friend of the chancellor, Robert Burnell (<i>d</i>. 1292). The inevitable corollary of royal favour was royal service. Waleys was nominated to a number of judicial commissions, and in the 1280s may have been involved in the works at Westminster. In 1284, along with Gregory of Ruxley (<i>d</i>. 1291) and Itier d'Angoul&ecirc;me, he was appointed to enforce edicts on the clipping and falsification of money. He was several times employed by Edward I on commissions for town planning, for instance at New Winchelsea in November 1281, while in January 1297 he was advising Edward on the rebuilding and development of Berwick. Waleys also frequently went abroad, on his own business or in the king's service. In 1275 he was appointed mayor of Bordeaux, but Waleys, unable to govern a city divided by internal strife, had to resign in the autumn of the same year. In July 1284 he was appointed farmer of the revenues of six Gascon bastides (planned new towns), while in February 1286 he represented the king's interests in court at Rouen. He also either had interests of his own in Ireland, or was active there in the king's service in 1294. Moreover, Edward employed him in his Scottish wars, in October 1297 commissioning him to levy 1000 men in Worcestershire.<br>
<br>Henry le Waleys died in London on 29 June 1302, and his will was proved in the court of husting on 16 July following. A patron of the mendicant orders, he was buried on 5 July in the church of the London Minoresses outside Aldgate, and was also a benefactor of the city's Franciscans, building the nave of their church, giving timber for its altars, and leaving them a large legacy. His son, Augustine Uxbridge, became keeper of the exchange under Edward II, and married Margaret, the sister of Richard Conduit. Waleys had another son, Henry, mentioned in 1276, who probably predeceased his father.<br>
