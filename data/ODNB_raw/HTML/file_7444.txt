<span class="headword">Delap,  John</span>  (1724/5&#150;1812), <span class="occ">poet and playwright</span>, was born at Spilsby, Lincolnshire, one of the four children (two sons and two daughters) of John Delap (<i>d</i>. 1756), gentleman, of Gainsborough, in the same county. After schooling at Beverley grammar school, Yorkshire, he was originally entered at Trinity College, Cambridge, in March 1743 but transferred to Magdalene College and was admitted pensioner on 15 March of the following year. He took the degrees of BA in 1747, MA in 1750, and DD in 1762. On 30 December 1748 Delap was elected to a fellowship at Magdalene, and on 4 March 1749 was admitted into its emoluments. He was ordained deacon on 22 May 1749 and appointed curate at Londonthorpe and Gunerby, near Grantham. He was ordained a priest in the Church of England on 23 December 1750 and, on the following day, was appointed rector at East Keal, Lincolnshire, where he remained probably until 1760. Between 1756 and 1758 he served as curate to the poet the Revd William Mason at All Saints Church, Aston, Yorkshire, and from 1759 to 1765 as curate at Ousby, Cumberland. His thesis for his divinity degree (12 April 1762), entitled &#145;Mundi perpetuus administrator Christus&#146;, was published in 1763. He was vicar of Iford and Kingston, near Lewes in Sussex, from 1765 to 1812, of Woolavington from 1774 to 1812, and sinecure rector from January 1779 at St Mary's, Cilcain, Flintshire.<br>
<br>Delap's first publication was <span class="italic">Marcellus: a Monody</span> (1751), which was inspired by the death of George II's eldest son, and was inscribed to his widow, the princess of Wales. This was followed by his <span class="italic">Elegies</span> (1760) in which the author who &#145;very feelingly lamented his want of health&#146;&#151;a recurrent theme&#151;is heavily influenced by Gray  (Nichols, 9.8). Later poems include <span class="italic">An Elegy on the Death of the Duke of Rutland</span> (1788), <span class="italic">Sedition, an Ode Occasioned by his Majesty's Late Proclamation</span> and <span class="italic">The Royal Pavilion, an Ode</span> (both 1792), and <span class="italic">The Lord of the Nile, an Elegy</span> (1799).<br>
<br>Delap's great love was writing tragedies and while he met with little dramatic success, he remained undaunted both in his attempts to promote his own efforts and to curry favour and fame. He also conferred and disputed endlessly with friends and colleagues over the merits of his own writings. David Garrick, Frances Burney, and Hester Thrale were recipients of Delap's almost obsessive preoccupation with his dramatic works. Burney described Delap's fondness for talking about his own work to the point of tedium and impoliteness: &#145;he returned to the same thing a million times, asked the same questions, enacted the same compliments, and worked at the same passages, till I almost fell asleep with the sound of the same words&#146; (29 May 1779). Burney also claims that Delap's thirst for reputation was such that he preferred to &#145;make a general rout and reform&#146; of his plays rather than miss the chance of production&#151;an intention which he communicated to Garrick &#145;at portentous length&#146;  (Parsons, 186). Burney summed up Delap as &#145;a man of deep learning, but totally ignorant of life and manners&#146;.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">Hecuba</span> (1761), a tragedy in three acts, was Delap's first dramatic success. The play was produced by Garrick at Drury Lane on 11 December 1761. In a letter to George Coleman, manager of Drury Lane, Garrick claims that: &#145;We might steal it on to Six Nights with much loss, but I hope, that the Author will be reasonable, &amp; satisfy'd with what We have already done, without insisting upon our losing more to <i>force</i> a Reputation&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters</span>, 1.348). While Garrick also alludes to the performance as resulting from a personal favour to the author it seems unlikely that he would have produced, spoken the prologue, and written the epilogue if he considered it to be totally without merit. Stone states that the play was produced four times between its first night and 8 January 1762 while Baker claims that &#145;it only ran for three nights&#146;. Genest asserts that the play is derivative from West's <span class="italic">Hecuba</span> but also describes it as &#145;not void of merit, but it cannot by any means be called a good play&#146;  (Genest, <span class="italic">Eng. stage</span>, 4.638). Baker confirms this assessment pointing to the play's lack of dramatic action, a tendency for too much declamatory statement, its &#145;indifferent success&#146;, but he does concede that it contains certain merits in its use of poetic language  (Baker, 2.287). As a tragedy <span class="italic">Hecuba</span> stays faithful to its classical model in its emphasis on representing Hecuba as the most unfortunate of mothers. While little action takes place on stage the text is of interest for its rendition of a model of feminine passivity (Hecuba's maternal suffering and Polyxena's sacrifice) and how this signifies definitions of male heroism (ghostly Achilles's decree, Ulysses's justification for the Greeks' actions and Polydore's suicide for honour's sake). The potential within the play to offer a reading of the codification of gender roles was not missed by Garrick whose epilogue (spoken by Miss Bride) draws a contemporary analogy:<blockquote>
<div>Do you not shudder parents, at this tale?<br>
</div>
<div>You sacrifice a daughter now and then,<br>
</div>
<div>To rich, old, wither'd half-departed men.<br>
</div>
</blockquote>The play was published in 1762 at a price of 11<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>. and dedicated to Thomas Barrett of Lee, near Canterbury, where it appears Delap was living. A number of Dublin editions followed.<br>
<br>Delap's next play, <span class="italic">Panthea</span>, was rejected by Garrick and never produced, though this fact did not deter the author, who stated his intention to rewrite the play  (<span class="italic">Letters</span>, 3.933). Delap was again in correspondence with Garrick concerning his attempt to have produced his next play, <span class="italic">The Royal Suppliants</span>, previously titled <span class="italic">The Royal Exiles</span>. Garrick advised Delap to make a number of changes to give the play dramatic interest and was most perturbed by the last act which he described as being the &#145;worst, &amp; ought to be the best&#146;  (ibid., 3.932). The subject of this neoclassical five-act tragedy is a dynastic power struggle. Baker praises the play for &#145;two very affecting scenes between the mother and daughter, which are genuine pictures from nature&#146;  (Baker, 3.231). The play, which is based on Euripides's <span class="italic">Heraclidae</span> and <span class="italic">The Suppliants</span> of Aeschylus, was finally produced at Drury Lane on 17 February 1781 and thereafter eight times. The performance announced in the playbill for 1 March 1781 did not occur owing to the illness of the actress Miss Crawford. The play was published in 1781 with two further editions in the same year.<br>
<br>Delap's next play, <span class="italic">The Captives</span>, was produced on 9 March 1786 at Drury Lane where it ran for three nights. It was published in the same year. The play was not a success: Baker refers to it as being withdrawn &#145;after dragging through three nights&#146;  (Baker, 2.82). Kemble in a letter to Malone offers a contemporary review, caustically describing the play as being &#145;set at liberty last night, amidst roars of laughter&#146;  (Hogan, 10.870). A further play, <span class="italic">Gunilda</span>, which was never acted, was published in 1786. This play, together with other unacted plays, was published in Delap's <span class="italic">Dramatic Poems: Gunilda, Usurper, Matilda, and Abdalla</span> (1803).<br>
<br>Delap appears to have lived for most of his literary life in South Street, Lewes, in Sussex. He was nevertheless acquainted with literary circles of the day, visiting the Thrales at Brighton, Tunbridge Wells, and Streatham. Through the Thrales he became acquainted with Samuel Johnson as well as David Garrick and Frances Burney. His acquaintance with important literary figures of the day does not seem greatly to have enhanced his own dramatic abilities. Delap died, unmarried, at Lewes in late 1812 aged eighty-seven, and was buried on 24 December 1812 at St Thomas &agrave; Becket, Cliffe, Lewes.<br>
