<span class="headword">O'Reilly,  Edmund</span>  (1598&#150;1669), <span class="occ">Roman Catholic archbishop of Armagh</span>, was born, according to his own account, on 2 or 3 January 1598, almost certainly in south co. Dublin. His father, perhaps Garret O'Reilly, seems to have belonged to a line not far removed from the main stem of what was the principal family of East Breifne (now co. Cavan), but no reliable personal detail concerning his parents has survived. He received his classical education in Dublin city, probably in one of the schools the Jesuits and Franciscans were able to maintain there at this time. About 1620 he went to the Irish seminary in Douai in the Spanish Netherlands, and may also have spent some time in the Irish College very recently opened in Antwerp. He was ordained priest by the exiled Archbishop Florence Conry of Tuam, though no official record of this has been located.<br>
<br>O'Reilly set out for Ireland in 1626, but on his way through England was arrested and imprisoned for almost two years. On his release in March 1628 he went to Ireland and took up duty in Dublin, where a pragmatic and political toleration succeeded a show of force by the government in 1629. He commended himself to the archbishop, Thomas Fleming, who decided to appoint him his vicar-general, though it is uncertain whether this appointment was made before O'Reilly went to the University of Louvain for further studies about 1637 or after his return in 1641. From 1641 onwards he was, in practice, in charge of ecclesiastical affairs in the diocese because the archbishop was in Kilkenny engaged in the political affairs of the confederate Catholics.<br>
<br>In 1648 the confederates were finally divided: on the one side the supporters of the papal nuncio Rinuccini, who demanded a complete repeal of the penal laws, and on the other side the party, largely Old English in composition, that was ready to accept from the lord lieutenant, the marquess of Ormond, the kind of practical toleration they had grown accustomed to. O'Reilly was a committed supporter of the nuncio's party, and was the chief intermediary in negotiations between the old Irish military leader, Owen Roe O'Neill, and Michael Jones, commander of the parliamentarian forces in Dublin. Rumour even attributed to him responsibility for Ormond's defeat by Jones at Rathmines (August 1649) through his betraying Ormond's position. The rift between the two confederate factions was patched up after the arrival of Oliver Cromwell, but over the course of a few years the country was conquered. O'Reilly had joined the resistance in the mountains of Wicklow, but when this collapsed in 1652 he was arrested. In September 1653 he was put on trial on the charge of having approved of murders at the capture of Wicklow Castle in December 1642. The military court found him guilty, but after more than two years in prison he was deported.<br>
<br>On 16 April 1657 O'Reilly was appointed archbishop of Armagh, principally, it would appear, on the recommendation of Dionisio Massari, who had been Rinuccini's chief assistant in Ireland, and had returned to become secretary of the Roman Congregatio de Propaganda Fide. His appointment was resisted by the English court in exile, but he was consecrated quietly in Brussels on 26 May 1658. He made his way to London, where in the political uncertainties of the Commonwealth he made hostile contact with his future opponent the Irish Franciscan Peter Walsh. He was expelled to France, but he now sailed directly to Ireland, where he arrived at the beginning of October 1658. He found a church that had barely survived the persecutions of the 1650s, but his own position worsened with the Restoration in May 1660. The Roman authorities ordered his recall and the government ordered his arrest, and he was deported in April 1661.<br>
<br>In Ireland the Restoration revived the bitter controversies of the 1640s. By 1663 there were reports that O'Reilly was acting to produce a conjunction between former supporters of the nuncio and exiled English republican opponents of the new regime. By contrast, in Ireland a party loyal to the monarchy and to Ormond felt it necessary to make a dramatic display of loyalty if they were to have any hope of dislodging those who had benefited from the confiscation of their landed property. Under the theological guidance of Peter Walsh, a declaration of loyalty emerged that drew heavily on the Gallican ideas now maturing in France, with the additional complication in Ireland that the monarch was protestant. Ormond, once again lord lieutenant, insisted that it be signed by the clergy, but when Walsh convened a meeting in Dublin he got little support.<br>
<br>Ormond kept up the pressure, however, and Walsh managed to convoke a national synod for Dublin for June 1666. O'Reilly was anxious to attend, and in seeking permission to return he was so obsequious to Ormond and Walsh that they assumed he would support them. The Roman authorities had been warning the Irish clergy, against a background of French developments that had already led to a serious clash, and the nuncio in Brussels personally advised him not to attend. But he arrived in Dublin on 12 June, and the next day made it clear to the synod that he could not accept the proposed formula.<br>
<br>It was decided that O'Reilly be again deported. He left Ireland late in the summer of 1666. He went first to the Netherlands, where he found the nuncio hostile. He then went to Paris, living in poverty there. Early in 1669 he set out for Nantes, apparently because he considered it would be cheaper to live there. He died on the journey, at Saumur, and was buried in the Oratorian church of Notre Dame. Lynch gives 8 March as the date of his death  (Lynch, 1.145), but this cannot be quite accurate, for a surviving parish register notes his burial on 17 March.<br>
