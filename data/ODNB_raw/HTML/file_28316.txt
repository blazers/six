</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Vincent,  William</span>  (1739&#150;1815), <span class="occ">dean of Westminster and classical scholar</span>, was born in the City of London on 2 November 1739, the fifth and youngest son of Giles Vincent of Lime Street ward and his wife, Sarah, daughter of Thomas Holloway of Newnham Murren, Oxfordshire. His father pursued the business of a packer and Portugal merchant, though the latter business was devastated by the Lisbon earthquake of 1755, which also killed William's eldest brother.<br>
<br>Vincent was admitted to Westminster School in September 1748 and became a king's scholar in 1753. He remained associated with Westminster until his death and was only absent from its precincts during his years at Cambridge, where he entered Trinity College in June 1757. He was elected to a scholarship in April 1758, matriculated the same year, and graduated BA in 1761, MA in 1764, and BD and DD in 1776. In 1762 he was elected to a fellowship but in the same year he returned to Westminster School as usher, or assistant master. He was ordained deacon on 19 December 1762 and priest on 22 September 1765.<br>
<br>In 1771 Vincent succeeded Pierson Lloyd as under-master at Westminster and was also appointed chaplain to the king. On 15 August at St Margaret's, Westminster, he married Hannah (<i>bap</i>. 1735, <i>d</i>. 1807), fourth daughter of George Wyatt, chief clerk of the vote office in the House of Commons, and his wife, Hannah. They had three children: William St Andrew (1772&#150;1849), who became a clergyman; George-Giles (1774&#150;1859), who was appointed chapter clerk and registrar of Westminster Abbey in 1803; and Hannah-Elizabeth (1776&#150;1777).<br>
<br>In 1788 Vincent succeeded Samuel Smith as headmaster of Westminster School. In the same year he was appointed vicar of Longdon, in Worcestershire, but soon resigned that living to become rector of All Hallows-the-Great, in the City of London. He was appointed sub-almoner to the king in 1784, was president of Sion College in 1798, and acted as prolocutor of the lower house of convocation in 1802, 1806, and 1807.<br>
<br>In 1792, when alarm at the potential consequences of the French Revolution was at its height, Vincent preached at St Margaret's, Westminster, for the benefit of the Grey Coat Hospital, a Westminster charity school. The sermon, in which he defended both the prevailing social order and the constitution, reflected his strongly held tory views, and the major part of it was published by the Patriotic Association in a print-run of 20,000 copies.<br>
<br>Vincent was installed as a prebendary of Westminster on 21 April 1801. He consequently retired from his teaching at Westminster School but not before responding vigorously to accusations by Thomas Rennell, master of the Temple, and Thomas Lewis O'Beirne, bishop of Meath, that religious education was being neglected in the public schools. A pamphlet entitled <span class="italic">A Defence of Public Education</span> (1801), in which Vincent refuted the allegations by drawing on his intimate knowledge of the curriculum at Westminster, occasioned some controversy and ran to three editions. It was the only one of his works from which he ever benefited financially (the profits were good-humouredly presented to his wife) and his subsequent installation as dean of Westminster on 7 August 1803 appears to have resulted from it.<br>
<br>In 1805 Vincent obtained the living of St John's, Westminster, in the gift of the dean and chapter, and resigned his incumbency at All Hallows-the-Great. After two years he exchanged St John's for another of the dean and chapter's livings, the rectory of Islip, in Oxfordshire, thereby obtaining a country residence which he much enjoyed and where he regularly stayed. He attended diligently to parochial business, enquired into the antiquities of the parish, and repaired and enlarged the dilapidated rectory. Islip also brought him into close proximity with Oxford University, where he preached the annual sermon for the benefit of the Radcliffe Infirmary in July 1808.<br>
<br>The first fruits of Vincent's classical scholarship was <span class="italic">De legione Manliana quaestio ex Livio desumta</span> (1793), in which by means of an ingenious emendation he reconciled the seemingly contradictory accounts of Polybius and Livy respecting the Roman legion. This solution to a problem that had long perplexed classical scholars was well received both at home and on the continent. Two further pamphlets quickly followed, <span class="italic">The Origination of the Greek Verb: an Hypothesis</span> (1794) and <span class="italic">The Greek Verb Analysed: an Hypothesis</span> (1795), both concerned with the development of the Greek language and the inflection of its verbs. These works Vincent was required to defend against charges of plagiarism, conclusions of a similar nature having appeared in the <span class="italic">Encyclopaedia Britannica</span> about the same time. His views did not succeed in holding their ground.<br>
<br>Vincent's chief study, however, was ancient geography and commerce, and his scholarly reputation rests on two major works. <span class="italic">The Voyage of Nearchus from the Indus to the Euphrates</span> (1797) is a commentary on an expedition recorded by Arrian of Nicomedia in his <span class="italic">Indica</span> that Vincent termed &#145;the first event of general importance to mankind in the history of navigation&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Voyage of Nearchus</span>, 1.1). The voyage was conceived by Alexander the Great, about whom Vincent wrote with an admiration unusual for the time. His commentary drew on a wide range of sources and he was assisted by Samuel Horsley, dean of Westminster, who loaned two astronomical treatises, and by Alexander Dalrymple, hydrographer to the Admiralty, who prepared charts for him. More unusually for the period he made use of oral evidence from those who had recently visited the regions concerned. The subject was pursued further in <span class="italic">The Periplus of the Erythraean Sea</span>, issued in two parts, in 1800 and 1805, respectively. He argued against the prevailing view that this too was the work of Arrian, attributing it instead to an unidentified Alexandrian merchant of the first or second century <span class="smallcap">BC</span>.<br>
<br>In 1807 these erudite commentaries were brought together as a second edition (in two volumes) under the title <span class="italic">The Commerce and Navigation of the Ancients in the Indian Ocean</span>. The whole work was dedicated to Lord Sidmouth (to whom Vincent owed his promotion to the Westminster deanery), though the original dedication of each individual part to George III was retained. Vincent's own copy, annotated with his manuscript notes, survives in the library at Westminster Abbey. English translations of the original Greek texts of the <span class="italic">Voyage of Nearchus</span> and <span class="italic">The Periplus</span> followed in 1809.<br>
<br>Vincent also published a number of other pamphlets and contributed articles on a range of geographical and classical subjects to the <span class="italic">Classical Journal</span>, the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span>, and the <span class="italic">British Critic</span>. Through the columns of the last of these he participated in the debates concerning the existence of Troy and the historical veracity of the Trojan War. A volume entitled <span class="italic">Sermons on Faith, Doctrines, and Public Duties</span> was published posthumously in 1817 by Vincent's eldest son and prefaced with a biographical account by his friend Robert Nares, archdeacon of Stafford. A second volume of sermons appeared in 1836.<br>
<br>At Westminster Abbey Vincent's most pressing task was the much needed restoration of Henry VII's lady chapel, but when a serious fire broke out in the roof of the lantern in July 1803 resources had to be directed instead to immediate and expensive repairs in the north transept. Under Vincent's leadership the dean and chapter successfully petitioned the House of Commons for public money to support the repair of the chapel, and between 1807 and 1822 a series of grants totalling more than &pound;42,000 was received. Work proceeded under the direction of Thomas Gayfere and Benjamin Wyatt, and though the supervising parliamentary committee tried hard to restrict repairs to those that were necessary for the security of the building Vincent resisted by simply ordering the work to continue.<br>
<br>Although as a master at Westminster School Vincent reputedly resembled Richard Busby in his love for the rod, in other respects he was warm-hearted by nature, wearing his erudition lightly and with modesty. With the learned he was &#145;ready to enquire and to communicate&#146; and with the ignorant &#145;so very indulgent, that they hardly suspected their infirmity&#146;  (Nares, xix). Generous in spirit, as exemplified when, on his advancement as dean, he quickly obtained a living for the curate who had been his assistant at All Hallows-the-Great for twenty-two years, he was a zealous patron of the Society of Schoolmasters, even though its formation postdated his own departure from that profession.<br>
<br>From an early age weakness of the eyes had prevented Vincent from reading or writing by artificial light but in other respects he had a robust constitution, in spite of taking very little exercise. He died, aged seventy-six, at the deanery, Westminster, on 21 December 1815, after a short illness of the stomach, and was buried in St Benedict's chapel in Westminster Abbey on 29 December. Mural monuments in the south transept (by unknown artists), with inscriptions composed by Vincent, commemorate both himself and his wife. His name is perpetuated by Vincent Square, which through his influence was preserved as a playing field for Westminster School.<br>
