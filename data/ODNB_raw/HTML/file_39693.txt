<span class="headword">Newman,  Henry</span>  (1670&#150;1743), <span class="occ">missionary society administrator</span>, was born on 10 November 1670 at Rehoboth, Massachusetts, the eldest of the three sons of Noah Newman (<i>c</i>.1646&#150;1678), a Congregational minister, and his wife, Joanna (<i>d</i>. 1679), the daughter of Henry Flint, a nonconformist minister of Roxbury, Massachusetts. His grandfather was a puritan divine who emigrated from England to Massachusetts about 1636. After attending free schools in Massachusetts, Newman went to Harvard College in 1683 to prepare for the Congregational ministry, but the college was becoming more liberal in outlook, and the influence of its tutors, who introduced their students to recent Anglican writings, eventually led him into the Church of England. He acquired there also an interest in mathematics and astronomy, which led him to produce two almanacs&#151;<span class="italic">Harvard's Ephemeris</span> (1690) and <span class="italic">News from the Stars</span> (1691).<br>
<br>Newman graduated BA in 1687 and MA in 1690, and remained at Harvard as librarian until 1693. He then had a commercial career, trading with Europe principally in Newfoundland fish until 1703, when he settled in England. He was employed by Charles Seymour, sixth duke of Somerset, until about 1708.<br>
<br>In 1703 Newman became a corresponding member for Newfoundland of the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge (SPCK), founded by Dr Thomas Bray, and in 1708 was appointed its secretary. He was suited for the post. He knew Latin and French, his American connection was valuable when the society was extending its work across the Atlantic, and his support of the house of Hanover strengthened the position of Bray and his friends, who did not want to see the society involved in the struggle for the succession to the throne in Queen Anne's reign.<br>
<br>Newman was a modest, retiring man and avoided prominence for himself. He was unmarried and content with his canaries and his cats. He clearly joined in the discussion at the society's meetings, but he never referred in the minutes to any view expressed by himself; and he did not leave London to visit any of the society's members in their homes. His main task was to engage in the correspondence concerned with the society's interests. In his first five years he wrote more than 6000 letters, besides making abstracts of all the letters the society had received. The drafts of his letters have been preserved in the SPCK's archives. They provide nearly all the information about him and a full account of the work of the society during those years.<br>
<br>Through his correspondence Newman succeeded in putting into effect the society's decisions. He dealt with many subjects as the society's activities steadily widened. While its original purpose, as he explained, was &#145;to encourage the erection of charity schools and to disperse good books&#146;  (Cowie, 22), it was led into other enterprises, which often caused Newman serious problems. Notable was his failure to induce Anglican missionaries to go to India, which caused the society to support German Lutherans there despite high-church criticism.<br>
<br>In addition, Newman's philanthropic concern led him to support such causes as Thomas Coram's Foundling Hospital and James Oglethorpe's settlement of Georgia. He served also as colonial agent for New Hampshire from 1709 to 1720, representing the colony's interests to the British government, especially in its lengthy boundary dispute with Massachusetts.<br>
<br>Newman worked for the SPCK until he died of asthma at his home in Bartlett's Buildings, Holborn, on 15 June 1743. He was buried in the churchyard of St Andrew's, Holborn, on 17 June. He was notable for his sincere but modest personal religion, which found expression in a broad-minded attitude towards others and a wish to devote himself to their welfare.<br>
