<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Powell,  Vavasor</span>  (1617&#150;1670), <span class="occ">Independent minister</span>, was born at Cnwclas (Knucklas) in the parish of Heyope, near Knighton in Radnorshire, the son of Richard Powell (<i>d</i>. before 1630?), a freeholder. Penelope Powell, Vavasor's mother, was the daughter of William Vavasor of Newtown, Montgomeryshire: her grandfather had been sheriff of the county in 1564, and was the first of his name to settle in Wales, having moved from Yorkshire. Others of Vavasor Powell's ancestral family had been sheriffs, stewards, and educated clergy, although his later detractors persisted in alleging he came from the common people. He was probably educated at Christ College, Brecon, and may possibly have attended Jesus College, Oxford, although there is no written record of his having done so. He was never ordained in any of the orders of the Church of England, but probably worked as a schoolmaster in Clun, no more than 10 miles from Cnwclas, under the auspices of his great-uncle, Erasmus Powell, puritan vicar of Clun until 1637. During his time in Clun he was converted, making a conscious acceptance of God's grace after an acute sense of his own sinfulness. He had been greatly influenced by the works of Richard Sibbes and by the preaching of Walter Cradock, who had established a congregation at nearby Llanfair Waterdine. Powell had begun preaching by 1640 and in that year was arrested with fifty or sixty hearers for causing a disturbance through preaching.<h2>
<a name="Thecivilwar"></a>The civil war</h2>On 2 February 1642 Powell married Joan Quarrell, widow of a Presteigne merchant and Hereford freeman, Paul Quarrell. In 1642 he appeared at Presteigne great sessions charged with nonconformity, but was found not guilty. He must have left shortly afterwards for London, and was there by August 1642, ahead of the refugees from the Llanfaches congregation of Monmouthshire, the first Independent church in Wales. Once there, he signed articles accusing his persecutors in Radnor of anti-parliamentarian activities. He preached in the parish of St Anne and St Agnes, Aldersgate, and in Crooked Lane, in the City, before moving to Dartford, in Kent, where he was vicar between mid-1643 and January 1646. As his sympathies were with Independent varieties of protestantism, this could only have been a temporary haven. If he had not already met Morgan Llwyd, the Welsh Independent minister and writer, he probably did so in 1644, as the latter sailed that year from Kent as part of the parliamentarian force relieving Pembrokeshire.<br>
<br>In 1646 Powell left Dartford to join the New Model Army forces besieging Oxford, having resigned from his living, but on 11 September he received a certificate of approval from the Westminster assembly as to his fitness for the ministry in Wales and his ability to preach in Welsh. Already, however, Thomas Edwards in <span class="italic">Gangraena</span> had noted &#145;many erroneous things&#146; in his theology and reported Powell's harsh way with his opponents  (Edwards, 3.97). That Powell could at this point accept presbyterian authority, and that the assembly felt able to endorse him despite the attacks on him in <span class="italic">Gangraena</span>, indicate that he was willing to present himself as orthodox. In June 1648 he, Ambrose Mostyn, and Llwyd were awarded maintenance from the tithes of six Montgomeryshire parishes to preach in the north Wales counties, shortly after he had signed a declaration by Montgomeryshire gentry, freeholders, and ministers to adhere to parliament and suppress the revolt which had broken out in May. He attached himself to the army of Thomas Mytton, and was injured at the siege of Beaumaris in October 1648. In the heat of the action he heard a voice telling him that he was chosen to preach the gospel; he later attributed his survival to divine intervention on account of his calling.<h2>
<a name="Thepropagationofthegospel"></a>The propagation of the gospel</h2>Powell was in London in the winter of 1649&#150;50 and preached before the lord mayor on 2 December 1649; his sermon called upon the city fathers to inaugurate the godly commonwealth. About this time he was invited by some parishioners to the living of Clyro, Radnor, but he declined it on learning that the incumbent had received his appointment from the committee for plundered ministers in London. On 22 February 1650 Powell was named twenty-third in the list of approvers under the <span class="roman">Act for the Propagation of the Gospel in Wales</span>, and six days later preached before the House of Commons. He remained a wholehearted enthusiast for the Commonwealth, and with Walter Cradock went to the north of England with a troop of horse to defend the new state against the forces of Charles Stuart. The Welsh propagation experiment allowed Powell's Independency to develop unchallenged, and like that of other leading figures in that dispensation, his outlook was deeply millenarian. In the petitioning against the propagators, which began as a complaint to parliament in 1652 and then fanned out to become a campaign in print against them, the name of Vavasor Powell was prominent. He was the target specifically of Alexander Griffith, a displaced Anglican clergyman, who alleged that Powell disregarded the common law, had made a huge fortune from trading in church lands and tithes, taught heresy, employed unseemly and obscene language in the pulpit, and (after December 1653) spoke disloyally of the protector. The last point in this litany of offences hit harder than most of the others, and was given force by Powell's undoubted and scarcely concealed distaste for the protectorate of Oliver Cromwell, which encouraged his enemies in mid-Wales to resort more frequently to the printing press.<br>
<br>The other charges levelled at Powell were informed by Griffith's bitter personal animosity. There was no question of Powell's immediacy as a preacher, at least part of which owed much to his capacity to employ to good effect the popular idiom, both in Welsh and English. Colonel John Jones, a commissioner of parliament in Dublin, hoped in vain that Powell would undertake a preaching mission to Ireland, and that he would grow weary of theological disputations. The title &#145;metropolitan of the itinerants&#146;  (<span class="italic">Strena Vavasoriensis</span>, 1654, title-page) bestowed upon him by his enemies, was not undeserved. He was said to preach often in two or three places a day in his counties of Brecon, Radnor, and Montgomery. As for his giving short shrift to the ways of the law, he was associated during this period with controversial figures such as Colonel Philip Jones, the dominant force in south Wales politics (although they had little in common in their religious outlook), and certainly had a regard for military-backed solutions to local difficulties of authority, even when the problem was to extract rent from his own tenant. After 1660 he admitted buying confiscated property, but his own gloss that his purchases were modest is borne out by evidence that they were confined to parcels of crown land in Old Radnor, which he bought in 1651 for &pound;252, and which yielded him &pound;70 a year. From a perspective of several centuries later, his attitude to tithes was ambivalent. He refused the living of Penstrowed, Montgomeryshire, in 1647 on the grounds that he was unable to accept a maintenance by tithes, but was an enthusiast for the propagation commission, which deployed confiscated tithes to fund an itinerant ministry. Powell never directly received tithes, nor a settled salary, but received an annually fluctuating award for his labours from a fund of pooled tithe income. The attitude of William Erbery, who, after accepting an award from the commissioners, in 1652 came to deplore the use of all tithes for religious purposes, seems more consistent.<h2>
<a name="Oppositiontotheprotectorate"></a>Opposition to the protectorate</h2>Powell looked forward with eager anticipation to what might be achieved by the nominated assembly of 1653, viewing it as a progressive development after the shortcomings of the Commonwealth government, and worked with Thomas Harrison and others to compile a slate of millenarian sympathizers to serve for Wales at Westminster. All Powell's choices were successful, and he was thus an important influence on the radical element in this parliament. His fury at the termination of the assembly by its moderate elements, and at the dawn of the protectorate of Oliver Cromwell, was immediate. Three days after Cromwell had been installed as lord protector Powell and other millenarian preachers, including Christopher Feake, met at Blackfriars in London to denounce the new regime. Powell deployed the book of <span class="roman">Daniel</span> to vilify Cromwell as the &#145;vile person&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1653&#150;4</i>, 305) mentioned in that portion of scripture and urged his hearers to ask God whether he would &#145;have Oliver Cromwell or Jesus Christ to reign over us?&#146;  (ibid., 306). He was arrested on 21 December, and was released on the twenty-fourth. He made his way back to Wales on 10 January 1654 and began a programme of preaching in mid-Wales which entrenched his opposition to the new government. His enemies sent ample evidence of his hostility and customary vehemence of language, but noted also the element of respect he commanded among the magistrates of mid-Wales. By March 1654 he had devised a petition against the government, and he and ten sympathizers were summoned before Montgomery great sessions for this activity against the protectorate. There was no prospect of his joining any alliance with royalists, however, for all his dislike of the new regime. In the spring of 1655 he was again in arms against insurgent royalists, accompanied by men of Wrexham: he was wounded in a skirmish.<br>
<br>After the scheme of the superintendent major-generals had been established, as a direct result of royalist unrest, Powell's movements were monitored by James Berry, major-general for the Welsh counties. Berry's judgement on the preacher's attitude to the government must have been coloured by Powell's readiness, despite everything, to fight for it, and it led him to underestimate his capacity still to make trouble. Information that Powell was busy in three mid-Wales counties fomenting an armed rising was implausible, but he could still wield the pen to damaging effect. Berry interviewed Powell at Worcester late in November 1655, and was assured that a petition in the making from Wales was simply a matter of conscience. Powell preached four sermons in the city that day, and Berry continued to take a relaxed attitude to Powell even after the petition, <span class="italic">A Word for God</span>, was published. It turned out to be a bitter denunciation of the protectorate, in which the theme of betrayal of the godly was dominant. It undoubtedly had more impact in London than in Wales, but its text and the furore it provoked exposed Berry's insouciance. Powell was its principal draughtsman and chief promoter, and the petition drove a wedge between former clerical colleagues of Powell's, such as Cradock and Llwyd, who could accommodate themselves to a tithe-supported ministry, and Powell himself. <span class="italic">A Word for God</span> also stimulated a print debate, in which Henry Vane the younger and William Sedgwick were notable contributors, on the legitimacy and authority of the government.<h2>
<a name="IndependentandopencommunionBaptist"></a>Independent and open-communion Baptist</h2>In the last years of the interregnum Powell lived at Goetre, in the parish of Ceri, Montgomeryshire, and continued to travel Wales and England to preach and dispute. His first encounter with a Quaker, Richard Hubberthorne, came on 14 November 1653 at Chirk, and it began a series of well-documented disputations with Friends, especially between 1656 and 1658. Powell emphasized the need for repentance for sin on these occasions, and thus on matters of doctrine remained resolutely orthodox, unlike Llwyd, who evinced sympathy for the spiritual insights of the Quakers. Llwyd was also more willing than Powell to think the best of the lord protector, and relations between the two men cooled a little, even if they never chilled, in the late 1650s. Powell's targets in the pulpit were not only the Quakers: in Oxford in July 1657 he preached against the universities, as had William Erbery in the same place nearly ten years previously. On this occasion, Powell denounced Henry Hickman, fellow of Magdalen College, for admitting that the Church of Rome was a true church. Later, Anthony Wood's account attributed to Powell the view that only Independents and Roman Catholics &#145;had religion&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 3.918)&#151;probably a garbling of the 1657 incident.<br>
<br>Powell may have held fast to Calvinist orthodoxy longer than did either Erbery or Llwyd, but his own ecclesiology, at least, developed in new directions from the Independency he had promoted during the propagation and earlier. By this time he had on the question of church membership moved towards Baptist principles. Unlike John Miles, who restricted access to the ordinance of communion to those who had been baptized as adults by total immersion, Powell taught that adult baptism was a rite that every believer should undergo, but that it was neither necessary for salvation nor a condition of admission to the Lord's supper. This placed him in an intermediate position between the Independents, who held with infant baptism, and the Strict Baptists of Miles. Nevertheless, he was still considered enough of an Independent to be invited in 1658 to the assembly to devise a declaration of faith. His response, on 26 August, was a guarded willingness to convey the invitation to churches where he had influence, but he warned against the dangers of the churches becoming too close to the government: &#145;If you go upon political and worldly accounts or by a humane spirit, to work, you may expect God to blast the work&#146;  (Peck, 2.13.25&#150;6). His suspicion that this letter would be intercepted because it travelled near Cromwell's court suggests that his distrust of the protector's establishment was more that of a &#145;country&#146; critic than of one, like William Erbery, with a principled distaste for state power.<h2>
<a name="TheRestorationimprisonmentanddeath"></a>The Restoration, imprisonment, and death</h2>The restoration of Charles II was a personal disaster for Powell, who may have been arrested as early as February 1660, and was certainly detained by 23 April that year. The new government feared his influence and rounded up a number of his followers at Bala. After a period of imprisonment at Shrewsbury, Powell resumed his preaching in June 1660, and when rearrested refused to take the oaths of supremacy and allegiance at Shrewsbury assizes. Despite the clearest signals that he was <i>persona non grata</i> to the restored monarchy he published a repudiation of the authority of bishops and <span class="roman">Book of Common Prayer</span>. He was moved to the Fleet prison and wrote there <span class="italic">The Bird in the Cage Chirping</span>, an apologia for the propagation era. It vindicated his former colleagues and honestly analysed the difficulties they had encountered in making the experiment work. It also explained the Restoration in terms of a squandering by the godly of divine mercies: &#145;We have been stomach-ful, sick and surfeited with the sweet and fat things of God's house &hellip; we trampled and trod under foot the good pastures&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Bird in the Cage Chirping</span>, 1662, 8&#150;9). On 30 September 1662 he was moved to Southsea Castle by yacht, and remained there for five years, unrepentant and still inclined to a millenarian analysis of events. He believed himself to be incarcerated &#145;for foretelling calamities in 1666&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1665&#150;6</i>, 191). The downfall of Edward Hyde, earl of Clarendon, seems to have provided a reason for freeing long-term prisoners of conscience like Powell, and in November 1667 the preacher at last walked free.<br>
<br>Even this long period in prison had failed to daunt Powell, and in March 1668 he was reported to have preached to a congregation of Fifth Monarchists at Blue Anchor Alley, Old Lane, London. In September, returning from a sojourn in Bath, where he was taking the waters for health reasons, Powell preached to gatherings at Newport, Monmouthshire, and Merthyr Tudful. At the instigation of the incumbent of Merthyr, Powell was arrested there, and on 17 October was examined by deputy lieutenants meeting at Cowbridge, in the Vale of Glamorgan. Before these former cavaliers Powell defended himself against charges of unlawful preaching with some verve, and was re-examined on 8 November 1668 and 13 January 1669. Powell managed to impose on these examinations something of the character of a religious disputation. He resisted taking the oaths of supremacy and allegiance on the grounds that he had taken them before and that they had been tendered to him by an officer without lawful authority. He also took exception to the practice of laying a hand on the <span class="roman">Bible</span> to swear an oath. The examinations, or &#145;conventions&#146;  (<span class="italic">Life</span>, 182&#150;8) as Powell called them, had one inevitable outcome, and he returned to prison at Cardiff. A writ of <i>habeas corpus</i> procured by a friend of his provided the authority necessary to move Powell from Glamorgan to London, where it was evidently thought he stood a better chance of a permanent acquittal. It was not to be, however, and Powell was committed to the Fleet on 24 May 1669. He continued to correspond with friends, and may have exercised the liberty of daily parole to frequent old haunts, and even to preach a little. By December 1668 he had married again after the death of his first wife. His second wife was Katherine Gerard (<i>bap</i>. 1638), fifth daughter of Gilbert Gerard, parliamentarian governor of Chester, who was twenty-one years younger than Powell. There were no children from either of his marriages. His last sermons were preached in London on 25 September 1670, by which time he was seriously ill. He died in London on 27 October, of a disease of the alimentary canal involving haemorrhaging and thrush. He was buried at Bunhill Fields, where a marble gravestone once recorded the fact, quoting <span class="roman">Revelation</span> 6: 10:<blockquote>
<div>Christ him released, and now he's joyned among<br>
</div>
<div>The martyred Souls, with whom he cries, How long?<br>
</div> (<span class="italic">Proceedings &hellip; Bunhill Fields Burial-Ground</span>, 83)</blockquote>Although a Welsh speaker, Powell only published in English, and his fifteen works consisted of polemical pieces, sermons before civil authorities, and orthodox evangelical tracts. Some unpublished English verse thought, if not known, to be by him, certainly follows his style in elevating the &#145;saints&#146; in combative terms, and setting them in the political context of the period. He preferred to invest his energies in preaching and disputation rather than authorship, holding that he &#145;would not neglect for the printing of a thousand books, the preaching of one sermon&#146;  (V. Powell, <span class="italic">Christ and Moses Excellency</span>, 1650, sig. A2). Some at least of this preference derived from his temperament, described by friends and foes alike as fiery and impetuous. He may have helped Walter Cradock prepare a Welsh version of the <span class="roman">New Testament</span> in 1647, although there is no direct evidence that he did, and he had in preparation a concordance to the <span class="roman">Bible</span>, which others completed after his death. His closeness to civil authority before December 1653 may have contributed to his adherence in general to theological orthodoxy while others of the Welsh &#145;saints&#146; moved towards antinomian positions: he was a regular preacher at assizes and civic occasions. But his strong belief in the value of the godly magistrate and soldier was balanced by an unshakeable conviction that the purpose of godly secular authority was to protect and nurture the people of God, a minority in the nation. When from December 1653 it seemed to him that secular power was no longer being deployed in the interests of the godly, he withdrew his consent to the government, and moved into permanent opposition, which could only intensify after 1660. An anonymous contemporary described Powell as:<blockquote>a man indefatigably industrious, unweariedly laborious in his studies, and in his ministerial performances: for a long time of great strength of body, and equal vigour of mind, both of which, while out of prison, he restlessly employed in the service of God. (<span class="italic">A Winding-Sheet for Mr. Baxter's Dead</span>, 1685, 10)</blockquote>He was said to have been short in physical stature. His personal seal was &#145;a skeleton or figure of death, holding in the right hand a dart, in the left an hourglass; sitting upon the tree of life&#146;  (Peck, 2.13.26).<br>
