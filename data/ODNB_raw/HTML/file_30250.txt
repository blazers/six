<span class="headword">Youatt,  William</span>  (1776&#150;1847), <span class="occ">veterinary surgeon</span>, was the son of an Exeter surgeon. Educated for the nonconformist ministry, in 1810 he left Devon, and undertook ministerial and scholastic duties in London. In 1812 or 1813 he joined Delabere Pritchett Blaine (1768&#150;1845) in conducting a veterinary infirmary in Wells Street, Oxford Street. This partnership continued for a little more than twelve years, when the business passed into Youatt's hands.<br>
<br>In the 1820s there developed a movement among practising veterinary surgeons to reform the London Veterinary College. The main complaints were that the school ignored species other than the horse, and that the governors refused to appoint veterinary surgeons to the board of external examiners, which consisted entirely of medical men with no veterinary experience whatever. Youatt was a leading reformer who devoted his life to the improvement of the profession.<br>
<br>In 1828 Youatt began a series of lectures and demonstrations to veterinary students at his private infirmary at Nassau Street, which were explicitly designed to include species other than the horse. His ambition was to have veterinary science recognized as a university discipline, and in 1831 he delivered his lectures at the London University (that is, University College); but his health was failing and by November 1833 he could no longer continue. The university course collapsed soon afterwards, but he continued to produce a series of monthly lectures in <span class="italic">The Veterinarian</span>, a professional monthly, started in 1828 by William Percivall, veterinary surgeon to the 1st Life Guards. Percivall was joined by Youatt as an editor soon after the journal was founded, and it was kept alive in the early years only by Youatt's dogged perseverance, at a time when even Percivall wished to abandon the venture.<br>
<br>Youatt's connection with <span class="italic">The Veterinarian</span> was the beginning of a notable literary career. As editor and author he was a prolific contributor to the journal. An expert on rabies he published in 1830 <span class="italic">On Canine Madness</span>, in which he expounded his firm opinion that rabies was a specific disease spread only by the bite of a rabid animal, and that it could not arise spontaneously. He gave evidence on this to the rabies committee of the House of Commons, but it conflicted with the medical opinion of the day and aroused antagonism. In 1830 he entered into an arrangement with the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge to write a series of handbooks on the various animals of the farm. Five titles appeared in this series between 1831 and 1847. The first, entitled <span class="italic">The Horse</span>, was the most successful; it included a &#145;Treatise on draught&#146; by Isambard Kingdom Brunel, though the attribution does not appear in all the editions, of which there were at least a further seven, the last in 1866. Youatt had a strong sense of man's moral responsibility to animals and published these views in 1839 in <span class="italic">Obligation and Extent of Humanity to Brutes</span>. His other literary work included the editing of two editions of <span class="italic">The Complete Grazier</span> (1833, 1839) and <span class="italic">British Husbandry</span> (3 vols., 1834&#150;40). Youatt was one of the original members of the English Agricultural Society when it was founded in 1838, and was placed on the committee of management. Here he did important work in moving and obtaining the appointment of a veterinary committee, of which he was appointed chairman. His objective was to establish a connection between the society and the London Veterinary College to promote the study of the diseases of farm animals. Two other important appointments that he held were as veterinary surgeon to the Zoological Society of London and veterinary surgeon to the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.<br>
<br>Owing partly to his extensive literary work and partly to attacks of gout, Youatt's practice had devolved more and more on his assistant, Ainsley, on whose death in 1844 the establishment in Nassau Street was broken up. Youatt, though now an eminent elder of the profession, was not a registered member of it. He had attended the London Veterinary College as a mature student in 1813 or thereabouts, but his enthusiasm and his connection with Blaine led to disagreements with the college authorities and he left without a certificate of qualification. However, in 1844 the veterinary reformers achieved their ambition when Queen Victoria granted their petition for the creation of a self-governing body for the profession. In March 1844 the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons was incorporated by royal charter and on 15 May Youatt was awarded his diploma of membership.<br>
<br>Youatt's missionary zeal aroused ridicule and derision among some practitioners, but the profession as a whole recognized his literary efforts and presented him with a dinner service of plate in 1839 as a mark &#145;of the high esteem they entertain of his literary labours in veterinary science&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Veterinarian</span>, 1839). His supreme contribution was his work on <span class="italic">The Veterinarian</span> and the influence that this had on the founding of the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons.<br>
<br>Youatt was the father of four daughters. He died by suicide on 9 January 1847 in his seventy-first year and was buried in the churchyard of Old St Pancras.<br>
