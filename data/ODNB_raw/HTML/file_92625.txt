<span class="headword">Chilcott,  Susan</span>  (1963&#150;2003), <span class="occ">singer</span>, was born in Bristol on 8 July 1963 of unknown parentage; she was adopted by Cyrus Oswald Chilcott, a builder, and his wife, of Timsbury, Somerset. Showing early signs of great musicality and of the possession of a fine soprano voice, she studied singing from the age of twelve with Mollie Petrie, who remained her teacher throughout her life. After studying at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama, in 1986 she won the Festival gold medal (and a prize of &pound;2750) at the Royal Overseas League music competition.<br>
<br>Chilcott's first engagement, in 1987, was as Musetta in Puccini's <span class="italic">La Boh&egrave;me</span> for Scottish Opera-Go-Round, which entailed more than thirty one-night stands on a twelve-week tour of the smaller towns of Scotland. Her career was slow to take off and she had to take on other work, such as cleaning, until the 1991&#150;2 season when she sang Frasquita in <span class="italic">Carmen</span> and First Lady in <span class="italic">The Magic Flute</span> for Scottish Opera. For Opera North she took part as Donna Luisa in the British premiere of Roberto Gerhard's <span class="italic">The Duenna</span> (1992), and sang Lady Penelope Rich in Britten's <span class="italic">Gloriana</span> (1993). She obtained a notable success as Tatyana in <span class="italic">Eugene Onegin</span> for Glyndebourne Touring Opera in 1994 when her singing was highly praised as well as her characterization of Pushkin's heroine. The same year she auditioned for the Th&eacute;&acirc;tre Royal de la Monnaie in Brussels, originally for the small part of one of the Nieces in Britten's <span class="italic">Peter Grimes</span>, but in the event she sang Ellen Orford, the chief female character, scoring a personal triumph. Her voice was now fully developed and under perfect control, while she had become an excellent actress. She repeated Ellen Orford at the Snape Maltings with equal success.<br>
<br>Chilcott appeared frequently in Brussels during the next few years, singing Desdemona in Verdi's <span class="italic">Otello</span>, the Composer in Strauss's <span class="italic">Ariadne auf Naxos</span>, and Alice Ford in Verdi's <span class="italic">Falstaff</span>. She also appeared at the Op&eacute;ra Garnier in Paris as Fiordiligi in Mozart's <span class="italic">Cos&igrave; fan tutte</span> and as Tatyana, while she sang Donna Elvira in <span class="italic">Don Giovanni</span> in Geneva and at Santa Fe. She had another Mozart role in her repertory, the Countess in <span class="italic">The Marriage of Figaro</span>, which she sang for Scottish Opera and Welsh National Opera; the latter production was seen at Sadler's Wells Theatre in London.<br>
<br>At English National Opera in 1995 Chilcott was particularly admired in the title role of Dvo&#345;&aacute;k's <span class="italic">Rusalka</span>, the water sprite who wants to become human, while Helena in Britten's <span class="italic">A Midsummer Night's Dream</span> enabled her to display her considerable gifts for comedy. She acquired two very sympathetic new roles, the protagonist of Jan&aacute;&#269;ek's <span class="italic">Katya Kabanova</span> and Blanche in Poulenc's <span class="italic">Dialogues des Carm&eacute;lites</span> at Netherlands Opera. She returned to Brussels in 1998 for another Britten role, the Governess in <span class="italic">The Turn of the Screw</span>, which she also sang in Cincinnati. Chilcott showed a special understanding of the more neurotic heroines of Britten's operas. The following year Chilcott repeated Katya Kabanova, this time for Scottish Opera; her interpretation of the character had become even more sensitive, while her performance showed a greater intensity. Also in 1999 she created Hermione at the premiere of Philippe Boesmans's <span class="italic">The Winter's Tale</span> in Brussels. An adaptation of Shakespeare's drama, the opera&#151;and Chilcott's performance in particular&#151;was very well received.<br>
<br>Meanwhile, having had a son by a previous relationship, on 1 October 2000 Chilcott married David Alfred Sigall, her agent and manager. He was the son of Rudolf Sigall, fur merchant. The first signs of the breast cancer from which she eventually died became apparent that year, but she underwent chemotherapy, and seemed to recover, returning to the opera house in 2001 to give a very fine account of Desdemona at the Glyndebourne Festival, a performance that displayed both the physical frailty of the woman and the courage deriving from her love for Otello. Her next new role was Lisa in <span class="italic">The Queen of Spades</span> which she sang first for Welsh National Opera in 2001 and then repeated for her sensationally successful Covent Garden d&eacute;but the following year, when Tchaikovsky's opera was conducted by Valery Gergiev, while Placido Domingo sang Hermann. Lisa was undoubtedly one of Chilcott's finest characterizations; she was able to express the rawest emotions of the young woman, besottedly in love with a man whose only thoughts were of gambling, while singing with beautiful, unforced tone. She also made a triumphant d&eacute;but at the Metropolitan, New York, in 2002, as Helena in <span class="italic">A Midsummer Night's Dream</span>.<br>
<br>Chilcott's last new role, in 2003, was Jan&aacute;&#269;ek's Jenufa; she gave a searing performance for Welsh National Opera that equalled her Katya in its dramatic effect. Her cancer had by then returned and she was forced to cancel a much-heralded appearance as Natasha in a new production of Prokofiev's <span class="italic">War and Peace</span> at English National Opera. Her final engagement was a concert of songs and poetry devoted to Shakespeare, with Fiona Shaw as reciter and Iain Burnside as pianist. She died on 4 September 2003 at her home, Woodbine Cottage, Sladacre Lane, Blagdon, Somerset. She was survived by her husband and son.<br>
