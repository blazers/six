<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Deakin,  Arthur</span>  (1890&#150;1955), <span class="occ">trade unionist</span>, was born at Holland Street, Sutton Coldfield, Warwickshire, on 11 November 1890, the son of a domestic servant, Annie Deakin. His birth certificate did not record the name of his father. At the age of ten he moved with his mother and stepfather to Dowlais in south Wales, where, when he was thirteen, he started to work for the steel firm Guest, Keen and Nettlefolds for 4<i>s</i>. a week. He joined the National Union of Gasworkers and came under the influence of Keir Hardie, then member of parliament for Merthyr Tudful, of which Dowlais was a part.<br>
<br>In 1910 Deakin moved to Shotton in north Wales and took a job with another steel firm as a roll turner. While working there he met an active trade unionist, Jack George, whose sister, Annie (1885/6&#150;1970), he married on 30 May 1914. She was the daughter of Robert George of Connah's Quay, Flintshire. They had two sons. For a brief spell Deakin was a member of the Amalgamated Society of Engineers, but in 1911 he moved over to the expanding, heterogeneous Dock, Wharf, Riverside, and General Workers' Union, which gave ample scope to his incipient qualities of leadership. Within three years he was an active lay member, and in 1919 he became a full-time official of the union. Until that year he belonged also to the small British Roll Turners' Society, of which for a brief period he was general secretary. When in 1922 the Dockers' Union became part of the Transport and General Workers' Union (TGWU), Deakin was elected assistant district secretary for the north Wales area, where the high unemployment of the next ten years strongly conditioned his attitudes and responses. In 1919 he became an alderman of the Flintshire county council and in 1932 its chairman.<br>
<br>In 1932 Deakin moved to London, where until 1935 he was national secretary of the general workers' trade group of the TGWU. He toured the country examining the problems of his group and so impressed Ernest Bevin, the general secretary of the union, with his organizing ability that in 1935 he was appointed assistant general secretary. He worked closely with Bevin through a difficult time for the union, for in 1938 some of its members seceded to form a union for busmen; and Bevin himself was showing signs of strain from overwork.<br>
<br>When in 1940 Winston Churchill invited Bevin to become minister of labour in the wartime coalition government, Deakin took Bevin's place in the union. He continued as acting general secretary until Bevin retired from union office in March 1946, when Deakin was elected general secretary in his place, with a majority of 59,105 votes over the combined votes of the other five candidates.<br>
<br>Although from 1940 until 1946 Deakin was the formal head of his union, the largest in Britain and one of the largest in the world, his work was done in the shadow of Bevin, whose reputation among the ordinary members was almost legendary and who never effectively relinquished his control of union activities. Deakin himself was essentially a Bevin creation and perhaps the most loyal supporter of a man upon whom he modelled himself to the extent of copying some of his public mannerisms. On the general council of the Trades Union Congress, where he took Bevin's place, he was a useful but not an influential member. The council had been dominated by Bevin and its general secretary, Sir Walter Citrine; with Bevin's departure Citrine remained firmly in control, unaffected by Deakin's presence. Deakin became a member of the government's war transport council and of the committee established to advise the production executive. In one respect he achieved notoriety during the war. When he visited Sweden in 1943 as a fraternal delegate to the congress of the Swedish Transport Workers' Union he conferred with a Finnish trade union leader on the possibilities of negotiating a peace treaty; for this he received much adverse publicity.<br>
<br>A new phase in Deakin's career began in 1946, when he became leader of the TGWU in his own right. After the resignation of Citrine from the Trades Union Congress and a period of uncertainty in the leadership of the movement, the position gradually clarified and settled. By 1948 Deakin had emerged as the most dominant figure in British trade unionism, influential also in the international movement.<br>
<br>Like so many men who find themselves thrust into positions of power and responsibility, Deakin developed to meet the situation. People who knew him under Bevin could never have imagined his filling the role which he subsequently attained in post-war Britain. A Labour government was in office and the country faced extreme economic difficulties. Both factors demanded that trade unions break with their traditional attitudes. They required a close collaboration with the government and the acceptance of attitudes about productivity and profits which unions had traditionally rejected. After an initial hesitation, Deakin gave the government his unconditional support. He urged unions to try to increase productivity and advocated a policy of wage restraint. He possessed a deep loyalty to the labour movement which was epitomized for him by the Labour government. In his eagerness to support the government he stifled much useful criticism of its activities, for he disliked anything which could be misconstrued by the general public or used for political purposes. He was more than an advocate. As far as he could he applied the policy of wage restraint in his own union and incurred the displeasure of some of his more militant members. But if he thought his policy was right no amount of criticism would deter him. At times he risked the unity of his organization and faced large-scale unofficial strikes rather than make expedient concessions. No government could have had a more loyal supporter.<br>
<br>Deakin travelled widely as a member of the international committee of the Trades Union Congress and as the most prominent representative of his own union. He was a member of the executive board of the World Federation of Trade Unions and did much to heal the breach between its communist and non-communist members. During his tenure as chairman of the board, however, he led a walkout of the non-communist delegates and helped to form the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions in 1949. Thereafter he became uncompromisingly anti-communist in his attitude towards foreign affairs, national domestic affairs, and the running of his own union; in 1949 he persuaded the TGWU to ban communists from holding office.<br>
<br>The attitude of Deakin towards communists was in part a reflection of his attitude towards opposition. He believed in the sanctity of majority decisions and was intolerant of those who opposed them. He attacked minorities in his union and in the Labour Party with invective and organizational measures. He would defy procedures and conventions to get his own way and was often accused by his antagonists of being a dictator. By his public manner&#151;outspoken, brusque, and intolerant&#151;and by his approach to the handling of internal union affairs, he lent support to the accusation. The administrative problems of his union increased as it expanded from 743,349 members in 1940 to 1,305,456 in 1955, and by and large Deakin coped with them. But he disliked delegating authority and maintained a strict control over even the smallest administrative detail in his union's head office. He would sometimes speak on behalf of his union without consulting the general executive council which constitutionally controlled him. Deakin believed in positive leadership. &#145;I cannot and will not be a cipher&#146;, he told his members. Yet he never forgot the source of his power and always made sure that on the major issues he had the majority of his ordinary members behind him. He was sentimental about his relations with the lay members of his union. Nothing hurt him more than the suggestion that he was out of touch with them. A cartoon which depicted him with his head in the clouds caused him considerable anger. He did much to improve contacts between officials and lay members, which he hoped to advance through developing educational provisions within the union. The TGWU introduced pioneering training schemes for shop stewards and branch officials, and under his guidance the education department became large and influential.<br>
<br>The public image of Deakin lent itself to caricature. He dressed flamboyantly, smoked large cigars, and courted publicity. But in essential ways both the public image and the caricatures gave a misleading impression. Deakin was modest and shy. He lived quietly and modestly in a small semi-detached house in a north London suburb where his evenings, when free from union business, were spent at home with his wife. He did not drink alcohol and was a member of the Primitive Methodist church. He did not make friends easily and found communication on an individual level difficult. But those with whom he had a close relationship came from various walks of life and different political affiliations. In this respect he was paradoxical. He tended to distrust Labour Party politicians and his personal relations with them were uneasy, whereas he could get on very well with self-made employers and with Conservative politicians. Thus he found it easy to make the transition from a Labour to a Conservative government in 1951. But he never transferred his distrust of Labour politicians to the party itself, and he disapproved of those trade union leaders who moved into industrial management.<br>
<br>Deakin was often accused of seeking honours, yet he twice refused a knighthood. He was appointed CBE in 1943 and CH in 1949, and was sworn of the privy council in 1954; these he regarded as honours to the labour movement rather than to himself. He retained his trade union and political influence until his death, which took place on 1 May 1955 at the Royal Infirmary, Leicester, after he had been taken ill while addressing a May day rally in that city.<br>
