<span class="headword">Burn,  Robert</span>  (1829&#150;1904), <span class="occ">classical scholar and archaeologist</span>, was born at Kynnersley, Shropshire, on 22 October 1829, the second son of Andrew Burn (1790/91&#150;1874), rector of Kynnersley, and his second wife, Mary Harris. He entered Shrewsbury School under B. H. Kennedy in 1843 and Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1849. He had remarkable skill in the writing of Latin hexameter verse. He was senior classic in 1852, and took a second class in natural science in 1853. He was elected a fellow of Trinity in 1854, and spent the rest of his life at Cambridge. He was ordained deacon in 1860 and priest in 1862. For many years he lectured on classical subjects; from 1856 to 1872 he was a tutor of Trinity, and discharged the duties of that office with conspicuous success. He vacated his fellowship on his marriage in 1873 to Augusta Sophia, daughter of Frederick J. Prescott, examiner of army accounts at the War Office and a descendant of Oliver Cromwell. Re-elected a fellow of Trinity in 1874, he was also praelector in Roman archaeology from 1873 to 1885.<br>
<br>Burn, who frequently visited Rome and its neighbourhood during his vacations, was one of the first Englishmen to study the archaeology of the city and the Campagna, and he published several works dealing with it, including <span class="italic">Rome and the Campagna</span> (1871); <span class="italic">Old Rome</span> (1880); <span class="italic">Roman Literature in Relation to Roman Art</span> (1888); and <span class="italic">Ancient Rome and its Neighbourhood</span> (1895). In 1881 he was president of the Cambridge Antiquarian Society. He received an honorary degree from Glasgow University in 1883.<br>
<br>A member of the Alpine Club from 1860 to 1867, Burn was a distinguished athlete in his youth and a good real tennis player up to middle age. He was one of the first captains of the Cambridge University rifle corps, and he was among the committee of Trinity men who drew up the Cambridge University rules for football in 1863. During the last twenty years of his life he was an invalid confined to a bath chair. He died on 30 April 1904 at his home at St Chad's, Cambridgeshire, and was buried in St Giles's cemetery at Cambridge. There is a brass to his memory in the ante-chapel of Trinity College.<br>
