<span class="headword">Phillips,  John</span>  (1631&#150;1706?), <span class="occ">writer</span>, was born in 1631, possibly in October, the fifth child (and the second to be called John) of Edward Phillips (1597&#150;1631), secondary of the crown office in the court of chancery, and his wife, Anne (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1640), sister of Milton; Edward Phillips had died in August 1631, so John was a posthumous child. His place of birth is unknown, and his approximate date of birth known only from an entry in the flyleaf of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18800/', "John Milton's")</script> family <span class="roman">Bible</span>, in which he recorded the birth of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22148/', "Edward Phillips")</script> in August 1630 and then noted that John &#145;is a year younger about Octob[er]&#146;  (family <span class="roman">Bible</span>, BL, Add. MS 32310). His mother later married her husband's colleague and friend, Thomas Agar.<br>
<br>The poet Milton, John's uncle, returned from his visit to Italy in 1639, and early in 1640 he took lodgings in London at the house of a tailor named Russell, in St Bride's Churchyard, near Fleet Street. Anne Agar seems to have died at about this time, and Milton assumed responsibility for his nephews' education. In the first instance John boarded with his uncle and Edward became a day pupil; shortly thereafter Milton moved to a large house in Aldersgate Street and Edward joined his younger brother as a boarder.<br>
<br>Late in 1645 the Milton family moved to a house in Barbican, and in 1647 to a house in High Holborn, near Lincoln's Inn Fields. In March 1649 Milton was appointed by the council of state to the post of secretary for foreign tongues, and so moved his household, including John Phillips, first to temporary accommodation next door to the Bullhead tavern in Charing Cross, near Spring Garden, and then to an apartment at the Scotland Yard end of Whitehall. In 1651 Milton vacated his Whitehall apartment and moved into a house in Petty France, opening onto St James's Park, and the following year, on attaining his majority, John Phillips finally left the Milton household. He may have remained in Westminster, which is the address that he gave on legal documents in 1653 and 1654 (both signed in Shrewsbury).<br>
<br>Accounts of Phillips's career as a writer routinely assert that his first venture into publishing was a book, of which no copy survives, that was entered in the Stationers' register on 31 December 1649 as &#145;Mercurius paedaneus, or, A short and sure way to the Latin&#146;; in fact two copies of <span class="italic">Mercurius paedaneus</span> (Norwich, 1650) have survived but its author is another John Phillips. The real beginning of Phillips's career occurred on 24 December 1651, when he published his <span class="italic">Responsio ad apologiam anonymi cujasdam tenebrionis pro rege et populo Anglicano infantissimam</span>, which the printer, William Dugard, dated 1652. This &#145;Response to the puerile &#147;Apology for the king and people of England&#148; by some anonymous dissembler&#146; was a defence of Milton's <span class="italic">Pro populo Anglicano defensio</span> (1651), in the face of an anonymous attack popularly attributed to John Bramhall but actually written by John Rowland. Edward Phillips records that his brother John brought instalments of his manuscript to their uncle &#145;for his examination and polishment&#146;  (Darbishire, 71), but the persistent speculation that began with Bramhall, that Milton may have been the author, is unfounded. It is possible that Phillips was rewarded for the writing of the <span class="italic">Responsio</span> with semi-official duties but the evidence is ambiguous; Phillips is not named in the order books of the council of state but Edward Phillips's allusion to the &#145;kinsman who was then with him [Milton]&#146;  (ibid., 79), who in June 1652 translated a Latin diplomatic document, almost certainly refers to John Phillips, as does Edward's reference to &#145;our author's kinsman&#146;  (ibid.), who in July 1652 was sent to deliver an expulsion order to a French spy. Similarly a German diplomat called Hermann Mylius noted in his diary on 17 February 1652 that Milton had sent him a message by &#145;his relative&#146; (<i>seinen cognatum</i>)), and again the reference seems to be to John Phillips  (Miller, 191).<br>
<br>During this period Phillips published his first poem, which appeared together with one by his brother among the commendatory verses in Henry Lawes's <span class="italic">Ayres</span> (1653). He also seems to have acted as Milton's amanuensis in the early years of the poet's blindness; the hand of Phillips has been identified in several documents but there is no known document that can be said with certainty to be in Phillips's hand so it remains possible that the handwriting is that of another amanuensis.<br>
<br>On 11 April 1654 Andrew Sandelands, who had been a fellow of Christ's College, Cambridge, when Milton was an undergraduate, explained in a letter to John Thurloe (written from a debtors' prison in London) that he had employed &#145;Mr Phillips (Mr Milton's kinsman)&#146;, apparently to gather information about land held by the crown in Scotland; the letter specifies that Phillips had been in Edinburgh and nearby Leith  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Rawl. A.13, fol. 226). This evidence of intelligence-gathering makes it possible that the John Phillips who wrote from Wales on 15 February 1654 to report anti-Cromwellian opinions was Milton's nephew.<br>
<br>In the mid-1650s Phillips returned to writing with a long poem called <span class="italic">A Satire Against Hypocrites</span>, which was registered (mistakenly in the name of his brother Edward) on 14 March 1655 and published the following August; a variant, post-Restoration title, <span class="italic">The Religion of the Hypocritical Presbyterians</span> (1661), explicitly identifies the target of this coarse and witty attack. Phillips next turned to anti-Spanish propaganda with a translation of Fray Bartolom&eacute; de Las Casas's <span class="italic">Brev&iacute;ssima relaci&oacute;n de la destruyci&oacute;n de las Indias Occidentales</span> (1552) as <span class="italic">The Tears of the Indians</span> (1656), which Phillips dedicated to Cromwell. This translation had been published by Nathaniel Brook (who also employed John's brother Edward), for whom John compiled <span class="italic">Sportive Wit, the Muses' Merriment</span> (1656), which contained &#145;lampoons on some heroic persons of these late times&#146;. Members of the government were not amused; on 22 April 1656 the council of state ordered an investigation, and three days later it received a report concluding that the book was &#145;scandalous, lascivious, scurrilous and profane&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 25/77, p. 80); Phillips was arrested and fined, and Cromwell personally authorized the burning of <span class="italic">Sportive Wit</span> in front of the Old Exchange on 30 April. About the same time Phillips and Brook produced a similar anthology of poems, entitled <span class="italic">Wit and Drollery</span> (1656), which boldly plagiarized a collection published the previous year; this book was ordered to be burnt on 9 May 1656 but was republished in 1661 and 1682.<br>
<br>In 1659 Philips published <span class="italic">Montelion, 1660, or, The Prophetical Almanack</span>, a royalist spoof on the republican astrological almanacs of William Lilly. Several sequels followed&#151;<span class="italic">Montillion 1661</span>, <span class="italic">Montillion 1662</span>, and <span class="italic">Montelion's Introduction to Astrology</span> (1661; 1664)&#151;as did works in a similar vein, such as <span class="italic">Don Juan Lamberto, or, A Comical History of the Late Times</span> (1661; 1665), but it is not certain that these are the work of Phillips; some scholars have attributed the sequels to Thomas Flatman. Pepys records in his diary entry of 10 November 1660 that he so disliked <span class="italic">Montillion 1661</span> that he burnt it.<br>
<br>Phillips fell silent in the late 1660s, which may imply that he had found other employment; that possibility makes it likely that he is the John Phillips, schoolmaster, who was living in Aldersgate Street in 1666, when he was taxed on six hearths. In the 1670s he again took up his pen as a hack writer, translator, and polemicist. He published a parody of two books of the <span class="italic">Aeneid</span>, called <span class="italic">Maronides, or, Virgil Travesty</span> (book v, 1672; book vi, 1673); an epigram in Matthew Locke's <span class="italic">Observations upon a Late Book</span> (1672); an attack on Thomas Salmon, entitled &#145;Duellum musicum&#146;, appended to Locke's <span class="italic">The Present Practice of Music Vindicated</span> (1673); a satire on astrology, called <span class="italic">Mercurius verax, or, The Prisoners' Prognostications for the Year 1675</span> (1674); a continuation of James Heath's <span class="italic">A Chronicle of the Late Intestine War</span> (1677); and a broadside poem called <span class="italic">Jockey's Downfall</span> &#145;on the late fatal defeat given to the Scottish covenanters near Hamilton Park, 22 June 1679&#146;. In 1677 he translated Madeleine de Scud&eacute;ry's <span class="italic">Almahide</span>, Gauthier de Costes de la Calpren&egrave;de's <span class="italic">Pharamond</span>, and Jean-Baptiste Tavernier's <span class="italic">Les Six Voyages</span>.<br>
<br>In 1678 Phillips entered into an alliance with Titus Oates, first writing <span class="italic">Dr Oates's Narrative of the Popish Plot Vindicated</span> (1680) and then, in the same vein, an attack on James, duke of York, entitled <span class="italic">The Character of a Popish Successor, Part the Second</span> (1681), which claimed to be the second part of a book by Elkanah Settle. <span class="italic">The Character</span> was answered by Sir Roger L'Estrange, and Phillips reciprocated with <span class="italic">Horse Flesh for the Observator</span> (1682). He also attacked the tory clergy in <span class="italic">Speculum crape-gownorum, or, An Old Looking-Glass for Young Academics</span> (1682), much of which was borrowed from John Eachard's <span class="italic">Grounds and Occasions of the Contempt of the Clergy</span> (1670). Turning his hand to the learned languages Phillips translated <span class="italic">The History of Ethiopia from the Latin of Ludolphus</span> (1682) and <span class="italic">Treatises in Plutarch's Morals from the Greek</span> (1684). In November 1684 Phillips was investigated for his role in the Popish Plot, with a view to ascertaining who had paid him to write his pamphlets, but he escaped punishment.<br>
<br>On the death of Charles II Phillips contributed to the national obsequies with <span class="italic">A Pindaric Ode to the Sacred Memory of &hellip; Charles II</span> (1685). During the reign of James II he translated <span class="italic">Don Quixote</span> (1687) from Spanish (referring slightingly to <span class="italic">Paradise Lost</span> in his preface) and also <span class="italic">The Turkish Secretary</span> (1688) from the French of Du Vignan, sieur des Joannats. His main polemical work of the late 1680s was <span class="italic">Sam. Ld. Bp of Oxon, his Celebrated Reasons for Abrogating the Test, and Notions of Idolatry</span> (1688), an attack on Marvell's old enemy Samuel Parker, bishop of Oxford.<br>
<br>In 1687 Phillips launched a monthly periodical called <span class="italic">Modern History, or, A Monthly Account of All Considerable Occurrences, Civil, Ecclesiastical and Military</span>, collecting the issues at the end of each year. In August 1690 he abandoned this periodical in favour of the <span class="italic">Present State of Europe, or, An Historical and Political Mercury</span> (much of which was a translation of a French journal published in the Netherlands), which he continued to produce until his death in 1706.<br>
<br>Little is known of Phillips's last years. He assisted Toland in the preparation of his <span class="italic">Life of Milton</span> (1691) but he did not write the anonymous biography of Milton that is sometimes attributed to him; the evidence of handwriting shows the biography to be the work of Cyriack Skinner. In 1693 he published a translation of Marie-Catherine Le Jumel de Barneville's <span class="italic">The Present Court of Spain</span>. Two years later he published an elegy on Queen Mary, and in 1697 a poem called <span class="italic">Augustus Britannicus</span>, on the occasion of the treaty of Ryswick. In 1703 he published a collection of astrological tables and poems by various authors, called <span class="italic">The English Fortune Tellers</span>. Phillips's last known publication, on 6 May 1706, was a poem entitled <span class="italic">The Vision of Mons: Chamillard Concerning the Battle of Ramilies</span>, written, as he acknowledged in public for the first time in decades, &#145;by a nephew of the late Mr John Milton&#146;.<br>
<br>In 1695 Anthony Wood described Phillips (with characteristic harshness) as &#145;a man of very loose principles, atheistical, forsakes his wife and children, makes no provision for them&#146;, but nothing more is known of his religious convictions or of his family; his willingness to support parliament and king, tory and whig, implies that his political principles were flexible. In 1706 the bookseller John Dunton described Phillips as &#145;a gentleman of good learning and well-born&#146;, noting that &#145;he'll write you a design off in a very little time, if the gout or claret don't stop him&#146;  (Dunton, 241). Phillips had mentioned the torment of gout in an issue of his monthly <span class="italic">Mercury</span>, attributing the poor quality of the previous issue to a violent attack of gout in both his hands and his feet. Phillips disappears from the historical record in the autumn of 1706, almost certainly because he had died. He had produced about sixty publications and so, with his brother, was one of the first hack writers, but he is chiefly remembered as the nephew of Milton.<br>
