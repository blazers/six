<span class="headword">Plumptre,  John</span>  (1754&#150;1825), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, was born at Mansfield, Nottinghamshire, on 11 March 1754, the eldest son of Septimus Plumptre (1717/18&#150;1782), vicar of Mansfield, and his wife, Catherine Young. He was the grandson of John Plumptre, MP for Nottingham, and nephew of the Cambridge scholar Robert Plumptre. He entered Eton College in 1770 and King's College, Cambridge, on 20 January 1773; there he graduated BA in 1777, as eleventh in the list of junior optimes (where he was erroneously described as of Queen's College), and MA in 1780. He was elected fellow of King's in 1776; in 1778 he was presented to the vicarage of Stone, Worcestershire, a living in the gift of the crown, and resigned his fellowship. However, in the same year he was described at the visitation as resident at Eton College as a tutor, and a curate discharged the duty of the living. On 7 April 1781, at St Botolph's, Cambridge, he married his first cousin Diana (<i>d</i>. 1825), daughter of Robert Plumptre.<br>
<br>Plumptre was still at Eton in 1782, at the time of his eldest son's baptism, but by 1786 he was at Stone, where he was to hold the living until his death. It was a quiet village of no more than sixty families. In December 1787 he was nominated to the third prebend of Worcester, and in May 1788 he was nominated by the dean and chapter of Worcester to the vicarage of Stoke Prior, probably as a temporary measure to fill the living until his successor was qualified to enter it. In 1790 he surrendered Stoke Prior and was appointed to the rectory of Wichenford, near Worcester, a peculiar also in the gift of the dean and chapter of Worcester, which he held until his death. Like Stone, Wichenford was a small village, containing about forty families, and Plumptre appointed curates to serve the parish in his absence. In both Stone and Wichenford parishes Plumptre ensured that morning and evening prayers were said each Sunday and that catechizing was undertaken regularly. He also maintained his parsonages in good repair.<br>
<br>Plumptre published three works of theology and a sermon, but most importantly he was a good classical scholar with an easy facility for languages. He published a Greek translation of Alexander Pope in 1795, which ran to a second edition within a year; in 1797 he also translated some of Milton's works into Greek. In 1807 he published a translation of the elegies of the first-century author Pedo Albinovanus into English verse.<br>
<br>In April 1808 Plumptre was appointed dean of Gloucester through the influence of his former pupil Henry, third Earl Bathurst, and in the same year he was granted a Lambeth doctorate in divinity. While dean of Gloucester he was described as &#145;a very respectable divine&#146;  (Witts, 47). He was also a correspondent of his fellow Etonian William Wyndham Grenville, Baron Grenville, the prime minister; his manuscript letter complimenting Grenville on his Latin and Greek compositions in <span class="italic">Nugae metricae</span> (1824) is bound with Grenville's own annotated copy of the book in the British Library. After many years' suffering with the stone Plumptre died in Gloucester on 26 November 1825, his wife having died a few months earlier, on 18 June. He was survived by two daughters and three sons, one of whom, John Francis (1782&#150;1864), was so extreme in his protestantism as to suggest that Catholic emancipation was the wickedest thing since the crucifixion.<br>
