<span class="headword">Dolben, Sir  Gilbert</span>, first baronet  (1658/9&#150;1722), <span class="occ">politician and judge</span>, was the eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7775/', "John Dolben (1625&#150;1686)")</script>, Church of England clergyman (and later archbishop of York), and his wife, Catherine (1626&#150;1706), daughter of Ralph Sheldon of Stanton in Derbyshire; Gilbert Sheldon, future archbishop of Canterbury, was his great-uncle. He was educated first at Westminster School (1671&#150;4) and then at Christ Church, Oxford, from where he matriculated aged fifteen on 18 July 1674. In the same year he was admitted to the Inner Temple, and seven years later was called to the bar.<br>
<br>In 1676 Dolben attended the treaty negotiations at Nijmegen, but soon abandoned diplomacy to follow his uncle Sir William Dolben into the law, at first not very successfully. By 1683 he had married well, however. His wife, Anne (<i>d</i>. 1744), was coheir to her father, Tanfield Mulso, of Finedon in Northamptonshire. Dolben's brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7776/', "John Dolben (bap. 1662, d. 1710)")</script> married Anne's sister, but gambled away her fortune, and eventually Gilbert was able to acquire both shares in the Finedon estate.<br>
<br>Dolben was returned to parliament in 1685 for the borough of Ripon, on the archiepiscopal interest. Unlike his brother John, who became a whig, Gilbert was a high-churchman of a priggishly conservative cast of mind, described even at the age of twenty-seven as &#145;the fustiest old gentleman you ever saw&#146;  (<span class="italic">Downshire MSS</span>, 1.389). He was also a man of scholarly interests, and is said to have assisted Dryden to publish his translation of Virgil. The fact that loyalty to the church was paramount for him was evident when he was removed from the commission of the peace in 1688 for refusing to countenance repeal of the <span class="roman">Test Act</span>. In the Convention, in which he represented Peterborough, probably on the cathedral interest, he was the first to give an opinion that the throne was vacant. He also declared that to have a Catholic king was &#145;inconsistent with the law of England&#146;  (Grey, <span class="italic">Debates</span>, 9.28). He sat in parliament almost continuously for the next two reigns, retaining his seat for Peterborough until 1698, recovering it in 1701, and transferring in 1710 to the pocket borough of Yarmouth, Isle of Wight. He was always a tory, but, as a prot&eacute;g&eacute; of the politically pliable secretary of state Sir William Trumbull, he supported the administration throughout the 1690 parliament, even after the king had shifted towards the whigs, and in 1693 was spoken of for the solicitor-generalship. Eventually, however, he followed his party into opposition.<br>
<br>Reward came in May 1701, when under the predominantly tory administration Dolben was named a justice of common pleas in Ireland. While not a permanent absentee, he refused to let judicial duties interfere with parliamentary business, and during sessions was excused attendance on circuit. For a time he was associated with Lord Nottingham, in campaigns against occasional conformity in England, and in imposing the sacramental test in Ireland in 1704, by means of a clause added by the English privy council to an Irish popery bill. In April 1704 he was created a baronet. After Nottingham left office Dolben developed a reputation as a moderate, and kept his place on the bench under the whig ministry of 1705&#150;10. It was only on questions of religion that his prejudices were visible: resisting repeal of the Irish test, for example, or in the debates on the Anglo-Scottish union, in which he not only denounced Scottish Presbyterianism but also pressed for some mention in the union treaty of the English <span class="roman">Test Act</span>, recalling how, &#145;when the church was attacked by a papist that sat on the throne, his first and great endeavour was to get that act repealed&#146;  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Eng. lett. e. 6, fols. 9&#150;11). He found the junto Lord Wharton hard to stomach as lord lieutenant of Ireland, but managed to avoid open insubordination.<br>
<br>Ultimately Dolben's success as a political survivor counted against him, when the tories returned to power in 1710: though in no danger of removal, he found promotion blocked by the &#145;resentments&#146; of Lord Chancellor Harcourt. In a final political accommodation he withstood the purge of tories from office after the Hanoverian succession. A particular interest of his later years was the charity school movement, of which he was an active supporter both in Ireland and at home, setting up a school on his own estate. He was finally obliged to retire through ill health in 1720, and died at Finedon on 22 October 1722. His will included a bequest of &pound;500 to the Corporation of the Sons of the Clergy. His only son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7777/', "Sir John Dolben")</script>, took holy orders, and succeeded to the title.<br>
