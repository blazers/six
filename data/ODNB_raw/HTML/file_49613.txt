<span class="headword">Cork, Sir  Kenneth Russell</span>  (1913&#150;1991), <span class="occ">accountant</span>, was born on 21 August 1913 in Finchley, Middlesex, the youngest of the three sons of William Henry Cork (1885&#150;1940), chartered accountant, and his wife, Maud Alice, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Nunn. After leaving Berkhamsted School in 1930, he joined his father's City accountancy firm, W. H. Cork &amp; Co., which specialized in bankruptcy, and qualified as a chartered accountant in 1937, in which year, on 12 June, he married Nina (<i>b</i>. 1915/16), daughter of Ernest Alfred Oswald Theodore Lippold, furniture manufacturer. They had one son (Sir Roger Cork, lord mayor of London in 1996&#150;7), and one daughter. In 1937 W. H. Cork, Gully &amp; Co. was formed, to do audit work for W. H. Cork &amp; Co., and Kenneth Cork became a partner, with H. J. Gully, in this new firm. He enlisted in the Honourable Artillery Company in 1938, and spent the war in north Africa and Italy, reaching the rank of lieutenant-colonel, in charge of all the catering services at allied forces headquarters and the Army Catering Corps in Italy in 1944.<br>
<br>His father and H. J. Gully had died during the war, and Cork became senior partner in W. J. Cork Gully in 1947. He began to take on insolvency work, and soon moved from audit and accountancy work to specialize in receivership. By the 1970s, W. J. Cork Gully was the largest insolvency practice in Britain, and &#145;the mere mention of Cork's name struck terror into the hearts of businesses everywhere&#146;  (Levin, 233). Cork felt this was unfair, as his philosophy was that receivership did not necessarily lead to failure, and he preferred to try to save an insolvent business and sell it as a going concern, rather than to put it into liquidation, which would mean closing it down and disposing of its assets, as was the usual practice. For example, when Brentford Nylons went bankrupt in 1976, Cork managed to keep the factory going, and sold it to Lonrho, saving 3000 jobs. W. J. Cork Gully was called in to investigate and deal with most of the major bankruptcies of the 1960s and 1970s, including that of Rolls Razor, which made cheap washing machines for John Bloom, and crashed with a &pound;4 million deficit in 1965, and that of Emil Savundra's Fire, Auto, and Marine Insurance Company, which left 400,000 British motorists without cover, in 1966. This investigation took eleven years, before the firm was able to rescue &pound;1 million for the creditors. Another major case was that of the Stern Group, dealing in residential property, which collapsed in 1974 with debts of over &pound;170 million. In 1980 a new firm, Cork Gully, was formed in a merger with the insolvency department of Coopers and Lybrand, with Cork as senior partner, and it became a division of Coopers and Lybrand. One of the first cases taken on by the new firm was that of the DeLorean Motor Company, which had built a factory in Belfast to manufacture sports cars for sale in America, financed by the British government. When the government called in Coopers and Lybrand to review the desirability of continued support, Cork headed the investigation, and as a result of his report the government put the Belfast factory into receivership.<br>
<br>Cork played an important part in the government of the City of London. He was elected to the common council in 1951 for Billingsgate ward, and as chairman of the music committee in 1957 he was responsible for planning the Barbican Arts Centre. In 1970 he was elected alderman by Tower ward, and he served as lord mayor of London from 1978 to 1979. He was also a member of the Wilson committee set up by the government in 1977 to review the country's financial institutions, and in the same year he became chairman of the insolvency law reform committee, to investigate insolvency law in the United Kingdom. The committee decided to write a new law, rather than to try to amend the existing law, with the object of making it easier for an insolvent business to be sold as a going concern, which would preserve jobs, and would also be in the best interests of the creditors. The principle behind the Cork report, published in 1982, was that a business is a national asset, and all insolvency schemes must be aimed at saving a business. In drafting the 1985 <span class="roman">Insolvency Act</span>, the government did not accept the report in its entirety, but picked bits out of it, including the idea of appointing an administrator to try to save businesses threatened with bankruptcy. In his foreword to the 1991 edition of <span class="italic">A Practitioner's Guide to Corporate Insolvency and Corporate Rescues</span>, Cork wrote: &#145;a good insolvency practitioner is coming to be regarded not simply as the undertaker to a business which has failed, but as a source of advice to struggling businesses which hope to avoid collapse&#146;. That this was the case was to a large extent a result of his example.<br>
<br>Cork retired from Cork Gully in 1983, and although he continued to take an interest in insolvency&#151;he published the <span class="italic">European Insolvency Practitioners' Handbook</span> in 1984&#151;he became interested in venture capital and the creation of new businesses (rather than his previous work of rescuing old ones), and was chairman of Advent Eurofund (1983&#150;91), Advent Capital (1985&#150;91), and Advent Management (1988&#150;91). He also helped to set up the youth enterprise scheme, to lend venture capital to young people.<br>
<br>Always interested in the arts&#151;he was chairman of the Royal Shakespeare Company from 1975 to 1985, and it was he who persuaded the Royal Shakespeare Company to make the Barbican its London home&#151;Cork was vice-chairman of the Arts Council from 1986 to 1987, and chaired the Arts Council inquiry into theatre in England, which produced its report, <span class="italic">Theatre is for All</span> (known as the Cork report) in 1986. An expert in finance for the arts, in this report he argued the case for public investment in the arts.<br>
<br>Cork was a devout member of the Church of England, who liked to listen to the <span class="roman">Bible</span> on his journey into the City, and he preached at St Paul's Cathedral during his year as lord mayor. He loved sailing, and always said he would have preferred to skipper a rum-runner in the south seas to joining the family firm. Appointed GBE in 1978, he was the first accountant to have his portrait hung in the National Portrait Gallery, a few days before his death on 13 October 1991, in the London Clinic. He was cremated at Chilterns crematorium, Amersham, on 21 October, following a funeral at the church of Sts Peter and Paul, Great Missenden, Buckinghamshire.<br>
