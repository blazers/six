<span class="headword">Compton,  Henry</span> <span class="st"> [<em>real name </em>Charles Mackenzie]</span>  (1805&#150;1877), <span class="occ">actor</span>, was born on 22 March 1805 at Huntingdon. He was the sixth of the eleven children of John Mackenzie and his wife, formerly Mrs Elizabeth Symonds; the families of both his parents provided numerous distinguished members of the medical profession. After an education at Huntingdon and at a boarding-school at Little Baddow in Essex, Charles was apprenticed to a maternal uncle, a cloth merchant in Aldermanbury, near London. Unhappy in mercantile pursuits and yearning for life on the stage, he was retrieved after running away twice, but, on his third attempt to abscond, in 1826, his family accepted the inevitability of his career on the stage.<br>
<br>Mackenzie's earliest histrionic attempts consisted of imitations of the &#145;At Homes&#146; of Charles Mathews, with which, as with the acting of John Liston, he was impressed. His first engagement, obtained through an agent, was at Lewes. He then played at Leicester as Richmond and Macduff. He appeared briefly at Cromer, and then was employed for twelve months as a member of the Bedford circuit. It was during this period that he adopted Compton as his stage name, borrowed from one of his grandfather's wives.<br>
<br>In 1828 Compton was at Daventry, and it was here that he apparently began to specialize in low-comedy roles. Shortly thereafter he appeared at Hammersmith. Three years' experience on the Lincoln circuit was followed by a long and successful engagement on the York circuit. In Leeds he was a special favourite. His first London appearance was at the English Opera House (Lyceum) on 24 July 1837, as Robin in <span class="italic">The Waterman</span>. After playing several parts there successfully Compton was transferred on 7 October 1837 to Drury Lane, where his Master Slender gave promise of the reputation he was to earn in Shakespeare. Tony Lumpkin, Gnatbrain in <span class="italic">Black-Eyed Susan</span>, Silky in Thomas Holcroft's <span class="italic">The Road to Ruin</span>, Bailie Nicol Jarvie, and the First Gravedigger in <span class="italic">Hamlet</span> followed. His chief successes at the Lyceum and at Drury Lane were Mawworm in Isaac Bickerstaff's <span class="italic">The Hypocrite</span>, Marrall in Philip Massinger's <span class="italic">A New Way to Pay Old Debts</span>, and Dr Ollapod in George Colman's <span class="italic">The Poor Gentleman</span>. While he was at Drury Lane in 1839, a young actress named Emmeline Montague made her London d&eacute;but as Juliet, with Compton taking the role of the Apothecary.<br>
<br>Following the termination of the 1839 season at Drury Lane, Compton went in 1840 to the Theatre Royal, Dublin, whence he returned on 10 December 1841 with the reputation of being the best Shakespearian clown of his epoch. Having been engaged by W. C. Macready, he appeared at Drury Lane in 1843&#150;4, and after visiting Manchester, Liverpool, and Dublin he transferred his services to the Princess's, where he performed as Touchstone on 11 November 1844. He remained at the Princess's for three years. In 1847 he was at the Olympic, where also he remained three years. Polonius, Sir Peter Teazle, Launcelot Gobbo, and Foresight in Congreve's <span class="italic">Love for Love</span> were among the parts he took at Drury Lane; at the Princess's and the Olympic he played a round of &#145;legitimate&#146; characters. When the Olympic was burnt down, Compton migrated to the Strand, and in 1853 he began his longest and best-remembered engagement, with J. B. Buckstone at the Haymarket. During his stay at the Haymarket he created Blenkinsop in Tom Taylor's <span class="italic">An Unequal Match</span>, Sir Solomon Frazer in the same author's <span class="italic">The Overland Route</span>, De Vaudray in Westland Marston's <span class="italic">A Hero of Romance</span>, and Captain Mountraffe in T. W. Robertson's <span class="italic">Home</span>.<br>
<br>On 21 December 1848 Compton and Emmeline Catherine Montague (<i>d</i>. 1911) were married. Thereafter the new Mrs Compton appeared at Windsor Castle in a small role in <span class="italic">The Merchant of Venice</span> (28 December 1848), several times at the Strand (during the summer of 1849), and in a performance at Devonshire House of Bulwer-Lytton's <span class="italic">Not so Bad as we Seem</span>, before Queen Victoria and Prince Albert (May 1851). She then retired from the stage to devote herself to her growing family. The Comptons resided at 19 Charing Cross Road, where most of their children were born.<br>
<br>Henry Compton left the Haymarket to play at the Princess's Theatre, Manchester, on 15 August 1870, and afterwards at the Olympic (3 September 1870), in Taylor's <span class="italic">Handsome is that Handsome does</span>, and on 7 October 1871 appeared in H. J. Byron's <span class="italic">Partners for Life</span>, with which H. J. Montague opened the Globe Theatre. In the noteworthy Bateman&#150;Irving revival of <span class="italic">Hamlet</span>, which opened at the Lyceum on 30 October 1874, he resumed his old character of the First Gravedigger with great success. With the Vezin&#150;Chippendale touring company he played several of his old characters. His last appearance on the stage was at the Prince of Wales's Theatre, Liverpool, on 14 July 1877, as Mawworm in <span class="italic">The Hypocrite</span> and Pangloss in two acts of Colman's <span class="italic">The Heir-at-Law</span>.<br>
<br>When it was known that Compton was ill with cancer and that his family was in serious financial straits, two benefit performances were accorded him. The first, at Drury Lane on 1 March 1877, was notable for the appearances of Henry Irving, Joseph Jefferson, Sir Arthur Sullivan as orchestra leader, W. S. Gilbert in an excerpt from <span class="italic">Trial by Jury</span>, and Compton's son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/45887/', "Edward Compton")</script>, in his father's roles. The benefit realized in excess of &pound;3250, thought by its organizers to be extraordinarily successful. The second benefit, at Manchester on 27 March 1877, was nearly as generous.<br>
<br>Henry Compton died after a long and painful illness on 15 September 1877 at Seaforth House, 12 Stanford Road, Kensington, London.<br>
