<span class="headword">Oppenheim,  Lassa Francis Lawrence</span>  (1858&#150;1919), <span class="occ">jurist</span>, was born in Germany on 30 March 1858 at Windekken, near Frankfurt am Main, the third son of Aaron Oppenheim and his wife, Adelheid (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Nossbaum). He was educated at the Frankfurt Gymnasium and at the universities of G&ouml;ttingen, Berlin, Heidelberg, and Leipzig, where he studied law, philosophy, medicine, and theology. At G&ouml;ttingen he studied Roman law under the great Romanist Von Jhering, and it was here that he took his doctorate, having written his thesis on a highly specialized area of German commercial law.<br>
<br>Having chosen to devote himself to the study and teaching of law, Oppenheim obtained a lectureship in 1885 at the University of Freiburg im Breisgau, where he was appointed extraordinary professor in 1889. Two years later he moved to Basel, again as a professor of law. He lectured on criminal law, philosophy of law, constitutional law, and international law, but throughout his teaching career in mainland Europe he concentrated his area of further study on criminal law. During this time he wrote numerous works on the subject and thereby acquired a considerable academic reputation.<br>
<br>In 1895, however, Oppenheim moved to England for health reasons. His was not a strong constitution, and he felt that the English climate and mode of life would suit him. It was also convenient in that his brother had been living in London for some time. As a German, Oppenheim had been educated in a civil law system, whereas England was the birthplace of the common law, and since he could not hope to continue his criminal-law studies in a common-law system, he instead turned his attentions to the universal topic of international law, which transcended all common- or civil-law boundaries. It was in this branch of legal study that he was to acquire a much wider reputation.<br>
<br>In 1898 Oppenheim was appointed to a lectureship at the London School of Economics, where he remained for ten years. In 1902 he married Elizabeth Alexandra, daughter of Lieutenant-Colonel Phineas Cowan. She took a strong interest in her husband's work. They had one daughter, Mary. During this time Oppenheim published his <i>magnum opus</i>&#151;<span class="italic">International Law: a Treatise</span>. The first volume, <span class="italic">Peace</span>, was published in 1905, and the second, <span class="italic">War and Neutrality</span>, in 1906. This constituted the most complete and systematic account of contemporary public international law yet published, and it placed Oppenheim among the foremost international jurists of his time. Belonging to the positive school of international jurists he derived the rules of legal science from custom and from the quasi-legal international conventions, and he regarded it as the function of the jurist to ascertain and give precision to those rules&#151;to criticize and suggest improvements, but not to create them, nor to select as valid only those of which he approved. Oppenheim protested against the tendency to deduce the law from phrases, too often uncritically accepted as self-evident truths; and he pleaded for the development among jurists of that wider sympathy with other nations which can only come from a study of their juristic systems and from the cultivation of an international outlook.<br>
<br>In recognition of his standing as an international lawyer, Oppenheim was subsequently elected a member of the Institut de Droit International, in 1911, and an honorary member of the Royal Academy of Jurisprudence at Madrid.<br>
<br>In 1908 John Westlake resigned the Whewell chair of international law at Cambridge, and he insisted that a reluctant Oppenheim stand for election as his successor. Oppenheim did so, and was duly appointed to the chair. At Cambridge he continued to add to his considerable list of legal publications, and in joint authorship with Colonel J. E. Edmonds he wrote the official <span class="italic">Manual of Military Law</span> (1912). He also made frequent trips to London, to give advice at the Foreign Office and at other public departments on questions of international law.<br>
<br>Oppenheim had taken British citizenship in 1900, and when the First World War broke out he staunchly supported the British war effort. Being a moderate liberal he had always disliked the prevalence in the recently unified Germany of Prussian militarism and bureaucracy, and he denounced the German attack on Belgium as &#145;the greatest international crime since Napoleon I&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 19 May 1915).<br>
<br>During the war Oppenheim became a corresponding member of the American Institute of International Law. He also prepared useful manuals on international legal subjects for the Foreign Office, to be used by the British delegates at the Versailles peace conference. It was about this time, too, that Oppenheim played a principal role in establishing the <span class="italic">British Yearbook of International Law</span>. Ironically its very first article was to be his obituary. The European situation also led Oppenheim to advocate strongly the foundation of a league of nations.<br>
<br>The strain of the war overtaxed Oppenheim, and in the summer of 1919 his health declined sharply. He was soon to be awarded an honorary doctorate of letters from the University of Cambridge when, on 7 October 1919, he died at his home, Whewell House, in Cambridge; he was survived by his wife. He was cremated at Golders Green, Middlesex, on 10 October. As an international lawyer Oppenheim had the very highest reputation, while in his private life he was noted for his personal charm and his great enthusiasm in anything he undertook.<br>
