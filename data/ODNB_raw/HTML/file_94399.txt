<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Russell,  Conrad Sebastian Robert</span>, fifth Earl Russell  (1937&#150;2004), <span class="occ">historian and politician</span>, was born on 15 April 1937 at Telegraph House, Elsted, Sussex, the son of the philosopher and political campaigner <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35875/', "Bertrand Russell, third Earl Russell (1872&#150;1970)")</script>, and his third wife, Patricia Helen (Peter) Spence. Conrad (named after Joseph Conrad, a novelist Bertrand knew and admired) had a disrupted and unhappy childhood, dragged around America as his father failed to settle into a succession of academic jobs. On his return to a fellowship at Trinity College, Cambridge, Bertrand and his wife used Conrad as a means to further their increasingly bitter feud. In 1949 Peter left, taking Conrad with her. All this took a great toll. Indeed, as he entered manhood Russell twice actively considered suicide. He did not see his father again until 1967, and when he did so it was in the clear knowledge that his mother would refuse ever to see him again. It is difficult not to conclude that he was drawn not to his father but to what his father represented&#151;400 years of aristocratic radicalism: the Russell tradition of self-conscious progressivism that had seen the fourth earl of Bedford stand up to Charles I, William Lord Russell die on the scaffold for plotting against Charles II, the fourth duke of Bedford as the leading Foxite in the Lords, Lord John Russell the epitome of nineteenth-century reforming whiggery, and his own father as a firebrand pacifist and social radical. Across his career Conrad Russell hesitated between supporting the Labour Party (being selected as its candidate in 1968 for the constituency of Mitcham and Beddington) and the Liberal (later Liberal Democrat) Party. When he inherited his title in 1987 he took the Liberal Democrat whip in the Lords, and he was indeed elected by his seventeen fellow hereditary Liberal Democrat peers to represent them in the reformed House of Lords in 1999 (the nearest modern times has seen to an election for Old Sarum). He was in many ways the last great whig, while paradoxically he was seen as the greatest champion of anti-whig history. He was, indeed, no stranger to paradox in any aspect of his life.<h2>
<a name="Beginningsasahistorian"></a>Beginnings as a historian</h2>Deeply wounded by the feuding of his parents, Russell was sent to Eton College in 1950, where he was initially bullied and unhappy; it was only when he went to Merton College, Oxford, in 1955 that he began to emerge from his shell. He combined an old Etonian flamboyance (striding around in a scarlet cape) with helping to found the university Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament group, and heading the campaign to get women admitted to the Oxford Union. He graduated with a first-class degree in 1958. He began research on early Stuart treason laws under Christopher Hill, then establishing himself as the most influential scholar in the world on the English revolution; but the relationship was not a good one, and once Russell began working as a lecturer at Bedford College, London, then an all-women's college, in 1960, the doctorate was abandoned, although fragments of it were published as articles that were still being read forty years later. He was drawn instead into a lifelong passion for the group of MPs in both houses of parliament who coalesced around his ancestor Francis Russell, fourth earl of Bedford, and especially his man of business John Pym. In the last two years of his life, when he had more or less given up writing history, he prepared the lives of both Bedford and Pym for the <span class="italic">Oxford Dictionary of National Biography</span>&#151;both delivered at more than twice the length he was given, and both quite brilliant.<br>
<br>For more than forty years Russell threw himself into the life of a university teacher, and was very good at it. He enjoyed the cut and thrust of debate and the exchange of ideas, and he was solicitous about the well-being of his students. Although eyebrows were raised when he married one of them, this was to be one of the great blessings of his life. His wife was Elizabeth Franklyn Sanders (<i>d</i>. 2003), daughter of Horace Sanders, an electrical engineer and manager; the couple married on 11 August 1962 and had two sons. Elizabeth's influence on Conrad was profound. She brought him the emotional stability denied him by his parents; she brought a cheerful practicality that modified the dysfunctionality of his domestic life (though she could not deal with his sartorial incompetence); and she was to prove the perfect intellectual partner and no mere sounding board. She herself worked on the reign of Mary I and was decades ahead of the field in her views on the successes of that reign (this explains the startling line of argument adopted by Conrad in his 1971 textbook <span class="italic">The Crisis of Parliaments, 1509&#150;1660</span>). She was at his side throughout his career, reinforcing his natural kindness and sharpening his wit.<br>
<br>By 1975 Russell was thirty-eight and a reader at Bedford College. Yet he had written no monograph, had edited one collection of essays directed at students, and had written seven recondite articles in learned journals. His reputation rested on those and on <span class="italic">The Crisis of Parliaments</span>, a clever, quirky, and prescient textbook that was always the book able students were told to read second. Within three years he had one of the top jobs in British history in the USA&#151;as successor to the abrasive Jack Hexter at Yale&#151;and he was in huge demand as a lecturer and keynote speaker on both sides of the Atlantic. It was a very dramatic and entirely proper rise to prominence.<h2>
<a name="Transformingseventeenthcenturystudies"></a>Transforming seventeenth-century studies</h2>The turning point in Russell's career came in the early 1970s when he began to teach a special subject on the parliaments of the 1620s with Nicholas Tyacke. This brought him for the first time into a close scrutiny of parliamentary records, and he was hooked. He wrote two short books for A-level students (so obscure that they are not in the list of his writings prepared by Elizabeth Russell for his Festschrift, do not appear in the <span class="italic">Royal Historical Society Bibliography Online</span>, and are not in at least two copyright libraries in the UK), one entitled <span class="italic">The Reign of James I</span> and the other <span class="italic">The Reign of Charles I, 1625&#150;1642</span>, both published in 1974. Here was revisionism <i>avant la lettre</i>&#151;full of aphorisms that looked to the future: &#145;if the country Charles I inherited was ready for civil war, it was not for any sort of social reasons&#146;  (<span class="italic">Reign of Charles I</span>, 29); &#145;The House of Commons did not want power; it merely wanted freedom to criticise the holders of power&#146;  (ibid., 34); &#145;the English Civil War was a war forced on unwilling men by the pressure of events&#146;  (ibid., 75).<br>
<br>It was these books rather than his well-known edited collection of essays by his colleagues and contemporaries, <span class="italic">The Origins of the English Civil War</span> (1973), that reflected the lessons of Russell's teaching and set him up for the work that transformed a whole field of study: an article published in <span class="italic">History</span> in 1976 entitled &#145;Parliamentary history in perspective, 1604&#150;1629&#146;. This gave him an agenda for the next twenty years and, overnight, it made him a scholar in relation to whom everyone else in the field defined themselves. It was a manifesto for early modern revisionism. Whole issues of several leading journals were devoted to his demolition of the notion that there was a &#145;high road&#146; to civil war in the early seventeenth century. There was misgovernment and there was incompetent kingship. There was no constitutional opposition, no &#145;winning of the initiative by the house of commons&#146;, no use of the power of the purse to clip royal prerogative wings; and the struggles for power at court were amplified within the houses of parliament. The arguments of this famous essay were developed in a succession of more detailed essays and in <span class="italic">Parliaments and English Politics, 1621&#150;1629</span>, which appeared to general acclaim in 1979. Based on an intimate knowledge of the diaries privately made by MPs recording the speeches of their fellow members, it both captured the drama and gave a flavour of the cut and thrust of debate, in which those in power and those aspiring to power struggled to impress a dazzled and mute majority. This gave free rein to Russell's love of paradox, along with his eye for the vivid quotation that made his point and raised a smile: &#145;at the beginning of the [1626] session, earls were being created, whom Rudyard wryly described as &#147;cardinals to carry the consistory, if there be occasion&#148;&#146;  (p. 269). In this book above all his others Russell's love of the physicality of the manuscript and a magpie's instinct for the quotation that glistened in the light of day allowed him to make a close reading of particular parliaments stripped of all anachronistic presuppositions. This was to remain a major strand in his research up to his (unpublished) Trevelyan lectures in Cambridge in 1995, although as time went by he placed less emphasis on misgovernment and more on England's growing ungovernability. He had changed his mind, he told his Cambridge audience, about there being no great political crisis in the 1590s: there was a political crisis, and the crisis consisted in politicians not knowing there was a crisis.<br>
<br>Thus began Russell's dominance of the field, which straddled the years 1976 to 1991. It coincided with his occupancy of the British history chairs at Yale (1979&#150;84) and University College, London (1984&#150;90). In 1990, dismayed by the willingness of his colleagues at University College to take the college out of the federal degree structure of the University of London and to set up on its own, to the detriment, as he saw it, of the smaller colleges, he resigned as Astor professor of British history and moved to King's College, where he remained until his retirement in 2002. Throughout his teaching career he was a conscientious teacher, famed for making his students think &#145;How do we know that?&#146; and &#145;What difference does it make?&#146; He was very committed to teaching the history of political thought from ancient to modern times as well as early modern politics; and the breadth of his teaching informed his writing, where he would charactistically say that the English won no major battle on the continent of Europe between Agincourt and Blenheim  (C. Russell, <span class="italic">The Causes of the English Civil War</span>, 1990, 168). Oddly, although he was a great help to graduate students from all over the world who came to work in and around the Institute of Historical Research, he had very few research students of his own. In <span class="italic">Politics, Religion and Popularity: Early Stuart Essays in Honour of Conrad Russell</span>, a Festschrift presented to him in 2002, only three of the twelve essays were by his own students: but there was no shortage of academic godchildren honoured to honour him.<br>
<br>Russell's position in London from 1984, the fame of the Tudor&#150;Stuart history seminar at the Institute of Historical Research (he was very much <i>primus inter pares</i> among its sponsors) attended by visiting scholars from around the world, the invitations to return to North America as keynote speaker at conference after conference on the civil wars and on the &#145;new&#146; British history, gave him the basis from which to beguile the profession with learned, startling, and stimulating presentations. He bestrode the field. No year went by without at least one important new article in a leading journal or in a Festschrift, and his range was spreading. He had always had an interest in religion, and he allied himself closely to Nicholas Tyacke's view of Laudianism and its polarizing effects. But the most potent new line of argument he adopted was the one announced in his inaugural lecture at University College (&#145;The British problem and the English civil war&#146;), that the English polity was destabilized first and foremost by the ungovernability of the multiple kingdoms of the Stuarts, and that there was a &#145;billiard ball effect&#146; as crises in each in turn had dynamic implications for the other kingdoms. This lecture had as electrifying an effect as his 1976 article (if a more polarizing one), was to be central to all his later work, and found full fruition in his late books. Three more articles teasing out implications of this thesis followed, one after another scintillating contribution to the &#145;British&#146; origins of the &#145;English revolution&#146; given as his inaugural lecture at King's College. The best of the work from the 1980s was brought together in the provocatively entitled and defiantly revisionist <span class="italic">Unrevolutionary England, 1603&#150;1642</span> (1990). But the most powerful expression of all the themes that had come to dominate his studies, and in many ways the pinnacle of his academic career, was the hugely successful series of Ford lectures he delivered in Oxford during the Hilary term of 1988 and published in 1990 under the title <span class="italic">The Causes of the English Civil War</span>. Here there was a rare range&#151;not just the period 1559&#150;1642 referred to in chapter titles, but the ability to make much bolder links across time and space, as in his sweeping comparisons of the trajectories of Reformation across a century and throughout three kingdoms, or in the magisterial depth of his account of the canker of want that ensnared successive rulers from before the Armada to beyond the revolution of 1688.<br>
<br>These lectures met head-on the charge that the revisionists had lost sight of long-term causes. Russell's riposte was to show how the Reformation, the problems of managing a complex composite monarchy, and the inability of the political &eacute;lite to manage institutional change all produced an ungovernable polity. The civil wars were not like a plane crash caused by pilot error (to adapt one of his own metaphors), but the result of metal fatigue that those in the cockpit failed to recognize as they blamed one another for the juddering sounds running through their craft. Yet, brilliant as they were as lectures, they did not quite transfer to the printed page. The book was promoted as a textbook but its allusiveness and combination of bold generalization and esoteric detail were off-putting. And there was an intellectual problem in relating the very broad survey of contexts for breakdown with the particular form that the actual breakdown took. In an understandable but in the end enervating abdication of responsibility Russell produced simultaneously with <span class="italic">The Causes</span> a full-scale, 572-page narrative of the descent to civil war&#151;<span class="italic">The Fall of the British Monarchies, 1637&#150;1642</span> (1991)&#151;that combined a penetrating account of Charles I's miscalculations with the desperate attempts by &eacute;lites in three kingdoms to restrain him from wilful pursuit of religious policies they found repugnant and political programmes they thought hazardous to noble privilege and the rule of law. The books are, sadly, less than the sum of their parts, although <span class="italic">The Fall</span> is as brilliant a reconstruction of the high politics of a composite monarchy as it is possible to imagine. Anyone accepting its premises is drawn into a gripping story of a polity under intolerable pressure. They are better books than <span class="italic">Parliaments and English Politics</span>, but they did not get the ecstatic reviews. If the 1979 book had opened a field, the books of 1990&#150;91 closed it. Disappointment at the response to these books was a factor in his withdrawal from the front line of historical debate. He also felt increasing dismay at the state of the field he dominated and he also came to regret errors of professional judgement. But these reasons were less important than the allure of trading the study of politics for the practice of politics.<h2>
<a name="Peerageandfinalyears"></a>Peerage and final years</h2>In 1987 his half-brother died and Russell inherited his title. John Russell had been prevented by chronic mental illness from being an active presence in the House of Lords. Conrad Russell lost no time in taking his seat and accepting the Liberal Democrat whip. For the rest of his life the Lords came more and more to replace the Institute of Historical Research as his spiritual home. He would conduct PhD vivas there, especially if the subject related to parliament; he became an expert on Lords' procedure and as much a critic as any seventeenth-century Russell of discretionary power passing from the legislature to the executive&#151;as in his passionate speeches against skeleton bills and statutory instruments. He was spokesperson for his party on pensions and social security, and his mastery of detail, together with his strong sense that many of the problems of the poor were perennial and that many of the remedies attempted in the distant past were at least as enlightened as anything the Major or Blair governments could come up with, enlivened the debates in the house. His love of aphorism&#151;his dry-witted quips could come as readily from James Bond or Bertie Wooster as from Sir Edward Coke or much more obscure early Stuart followers of the Russells&#151;was even more evident in the house than in his lectures. His <span class="italic">Intelligent Person's Guide to Liberalism</span> (1999) was a personal political and social credo that displayed a suspicion of all forms of authority (in education as well as in church and state), a deep rationalism, and a hostility to all forms of corporatism. He was a founder member of the John Stuart Mill Institute and a willing servant of the British Academy (of which he became a fellow in 1991), the Royal Historical Society, and many other learned bodies. But he was temperamentally averse to exercising leadership and convinced that all power corrupts. He was a whig who was suspicious of the next change. This temperamental conservatism extended even to technology, where he refused to switch from his sit-up-and-beg typewriter to anything more advanced. Given his tendency to lend the only copy of papers he had written to others, it is just as well he had a photographic memory.<br>
<br>Although a vigorous swimmer throughout his life, Russell neglected his body. He was an unrepentant chain-smoker who also drank gallons of coffee a day with several heaped spoonfuls of sugar per cup, and his diet was no better. All this prematurely aged him and he developed emphysema in his early sixties. It was this, together with an inconsolable grief at the death of Elizabeth in 2003, that caused his steep decline. He died on 14 October 2004 of respiratory failure at the Central Middlesex Hospital, Park Royal, north London, and was survived by his two sons.<br>
<br>Conrad Russell was an exhilarating lecturer and public speaker, a man of immense personal courtesy and kindness, especially to the young, a historian of astonishing clarity of mind and depth of knowledge, and a student of politics notorious for his poor predictions of the political future&#151;he was indeed the Micawber of the Liberal Democrat Party. He continuously predicted the downfall of successive governments, and he once predicted the election of a candidate for the Liberal Democrat leadership on the seventh ballot who was eliminated on the first. His memorial service in St Margaret's, Westminster, in June 2005 would have pleased him. It was a parliamentary occasion, not a religious one; the appreciations were by establishment politicians, and by that most waspish and anti-establishment of establishment historians, David Starkey. Baroness Hamwee, representing the former, recalled that at party gatherings he would gleefully sing &#145;Lloyd George gaoled my father&#146;. The anecdote sums up Russell's pride in the tradition he inherited and represented, it displays his whimsy, and it was surely accompanied by the engaging laugh that accompanied all his best lines.<br>
