<span class="headword">Talbot,  Benjamin</span>  (1864&#150;1947), <span class="occ">steel company manager and metallurgist</span>, was born on 19 September 1864 at Hadley, near Wellington, Shropshire, the second son of Benjamin Talbot, engine millwright, and his wife, Emma Isabella, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Todd. He attended Fulneck School, near Leeds, and served his apprenticeship at the Ebbw Vale works in south Wales. He then worked for his father, who owned the Castle ironworks at Wellington. When the family company ceased operating in 1890 Talbot emigrated to the USA, where he became superintendent of the Southern Iron and Steel Company at Chattanooga, Tennessee, and developed a basic lined gas-heated mixer for the preliminary refining of high-silicon pig iron. Three years later he was hired as superintendent by the Pencoyd Steelworks in Pennsylvania. There, in 1899, he applied the tilting furnace concept of Campbell and Wellman to develop a &#145;continuous&#146; process for making basic open-hearth steel.<br>
<br>Talbot's process involved the sequential charging and tapping of a tilting vessel at frequent intervals. The furnace contained molten steel into which liquid iron was poured and which quickly decarburized on coming into contact with the highly oxidizing slag floating on top of the steel bath. Refining was completed in just four hours (in contrast to about twelve hours in a fixed furnace using cold metal practice) and 20&#150;25 per cent of the finished steel was then tapped into ingot moulds and allowed to cool before rolling.<br>
<br>After Talbot returned to the UK in 1900, his new process played an important role in supporting the rapid growth of basic open-hearth steel making (which accounted for 18.2 per cent of output in the UK in 1906 and 36.7 per cent by 1914), primarily because the tilting furnace made it possible to handle the large amount of slag generated during the refining of highly phosphoric iron made from cheap, low-quality ore. However, his system promised other important advantages. The tilting furnace provided a more regular supply of steel to the rolling mills, increased both yield and output, and lowered labour, fuel, and repair costs. The use of a molten steel bath also made furnaces of much larger capacity (250 tons instead of 80&#150;100 tons) economical. In cold metal open-hearth steel making, as furnace size increased, more time was needed to complete the refining process. How Talbot's system affected steel makers' capital costs is unclear: some contemporaries estimated a reduction of 25&#150;30 per cent, while others believed the tilting vessel was more expensive to construct than a fixed furnace. However, his process lowered operating expenses by 20&#150;25 per cent and was quickly adopted by firms with access to low-grade ores.<br>
<br>To license his process, Talbot formed the Talbot Continuous Steel Process Co. Ltd in association with Sir Christopher Furness. Though the Frodingham Iron and Steel Company was the first to adopt the new system, three of Furness's steel firms&#151;Cargo Fleet Iron, Palmer's Shipbuilding and Iron, and South Durham Steel and Iron&#151;soon followed suit. In 1904 Talbot consulted for Cargo Fleet which had embarked on an ambitious reconstruction programme, and in 1907 he became managing director of this troubled firm. During the next seven years he transformed Cargo Fleet into a financially stable enterprise, but he could not overcome all the deficiencies arising from errors made in the initial planning of the new works prior to his arrival. He became a director of South Durham Steel in 1906, managing director in 1919, and chairman from 1940 to 1947. After the First World War South Durham adopted a hydrocarbon-lining process that Talbot invented for pipe making.<br>
<br>Although primarily a technical specialist, Talbot was a strong, all-round manager who exhibited sound organizational skills, pursued systematic methods, and developed effective sales and marketing plans. His talent for judging character was an asset when he strengthened Cargo Fleet's organization by hiring new staff, including several men who, like himself, had acquired experience abroad. His correspondence reveals a man who possessed strategic vision, yet retained absolute command of operational detail. He was also a very tough negotiator, especially when dealing with various steelmasters' associations. Indeed, from beneath his strong, broad brow, his eyes exuded determination.<br>
<br>Talbot was an adviser to the Ministry of Munitions during the First World War. As a member of the departmental committee formed to examine the position of the steel industry in 1918, he supported the majority opinion that Britain should impose tariffs to protect the trade from dumping. After 1945 he was an unrelenting critic of plans to nationalize the steel industry.<br>
<br>Talbot was awarded the Bessemer gold medal of the Iron and Steel Institute, the Elliott Cresson gold medal, and the John Scott medal of the Franklin Institute. In 1928 he was elected president of the Iron and Steel Institute and served as president of the National Federation of Iron and Steel Manufacturers. He was also a JP. His main hobby was hunting.<br>
<br>Talbot married Frances, daughter of J. P. Chapman of Siddington, Cheshire; they had three children. Benjamin Chetwynd Talbot, his only son, became deputy chairman of South Durham Steel in 1947 and served as chairman from 1950 to 1966. Benjamin Talbot died at his home, Solberge, Newby Wiske, Thirsk, Yorkshire, on 17 December 1947.<br>
