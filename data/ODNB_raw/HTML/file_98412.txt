<span class="headword">Pykenham,  William</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1497), <span class="occ">lawyer and ecclesiastic</span>, was one of four sons of John Pykenham (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1436), a successful lawyer who probably came from a prosperous London merchant family, and his wife, Katherine Barrington. His mother was a member of a prominent Essex gentry family, with estates held of the crown in Hatfield Broadoak and elsewhere, and she herself inherited a moiety of the manor of Otes, High Laver (possibly her birthplace), from her grandmother's family&#151;her great-grandfather Sir Thomas Enfield had held it early in the fifteenth century. William studied first at Cambridge and then at Oxford (1450&#150;65), where he was made a fellow of All Souls College in 1456. Despite occasional brushes with the university authorities&#151;in 1456 he was briefly imprisoned for carrying weapons and striking a man with his fist, and two years later he was in trouble for insulting the chancellor's commissary-general&#151;he emerged with bachelor's degrees in civil and canon law and a doctorate in canon law. In 1457 he was employed by Osney Abbey, Oxford, as its proctor.<br>
<br>Prepared by his education for a career in the law and in the church, the worldly success he enjoyed and the patronage he was able to attract have led to William Pykenham's being described as &#145;one of the cleverest young men of his generation&#146;  (Richmond, <span class="italic">John Hopton</span>, 216). At one time or another he held some sixteen ecclesiastical benefices, in Essex, Norfolk, Suffolk, and Kent. His qualifications and intelligence apart, he owed these preferments mostly to the Bourchier family. His father's clients included Anne of Woodstock, countess of Stafford, whose third husband had been Sir William Bourchier, raising the possibility of an inherited connection, and, while he was a student in Cambridge, Pykenham could also have encountered Anne's son Thomas, a future archbishop of Canterbury, when the latter was bishop of Ely. But the strongest link with the Bourchiers was through his mother's family, the Barringtons, who like them had long been established in Essex. It was Henry Bourchier, Baron Bourchier and later first earl of Essex, Countess Anne's eldest son, who in 1461, while Pykenham was still at Oxford, presented him to his first living, the rectory of Little Hallingbury, Essex. A year later he was presented to another Essex rectory, that of Rayleigh, by his mother's cousin Thomas Barrington. He also enjoyed the patronage of bishops Walter Lyhert and James Goldwell of Norwich; the former made him archdeacon of Suffolk in 1472, the most important appointment of his whole career, and later named him as one of the executors of his will. Pykenham also came to hold a number of other important offices and positions. Again in 1472 Bishop Thomas Kemp of London collated him to the prebend of Wenlocksbarn in St Paul's Cathedral. In 1481 he was appointed keeper of the spiritualities of the see of Ely, and also chancellor of the archbishop of Canterbury and the latter's prelocutor in convocation; the prebend of Leighton Buzzard in Lincoln Cathedral, and that of Gaia Major in Lichfield Cathedral, followed in 1483 and 1485 respectively. His final preferment came in 1493, when he was presented to the deanship of the college of St John the Baptist, Stoke by Clare, Suffolk.<br>
<br>Pykenham's benefactors expected something in return for their liberality. As an able lawyer he seems to have been constantly in demand, notably as a trustee of the earl of Essex's estates from 1475 to 1493, and later a feoffee for his sons. He enjoyed, too, a lifelong professional association, and friendship, with Thomasine Barrington, another Essex cousin, and her third husband, John Hopton of Blythburgh, an important landowner in Suffolk, Yorkshire, and elsewhere. In 1486 he was an executor of the will of Archbishop Thomas Bourchier, as might have been expected, but it is a sign of the range of his professional contacts (and perhaps also of his political affiliations) that in 1495 he should have been called upon to act in that capacity for the great Yorkist matriarch Cecily, duchess of York. Pykenham's training as a civil lawyer gave him a specialized interest in maritime law, making him a natural person for John Hopton to employ in a long-running dispute with the authorities of Dunwich over the town's harbour. After years of wrangling the king's intervention ended the dispute in Hopton's favour, probably in May 1466. Three years later Pykenham was one of the commissioners appointed to hear another maritime case, an appeal against a judgment given in the admiralty court.<br>
<br>At this stage in his career Pykenham was probably sustained by one of his two Essex livings. In 1470, however, Archbishop Bourchier presented him to the living of Hadleigh, Suffolk (an archiepiscopal peculiar), and Pykenham moved into the rectory there. Then, on his becoming archdeacon of Suffolk two years later, he took up residence in the substantial Ipswich archdeaconry premises, on the north side of the town church, St Mary-le-Tower. At this stage of his career his architectural ambitions were relatively limited, and he seems to have confined himself to rebuilding the modest gatehouse. But the emoluments of his ecclesiastical offices, along with his legal fees, must have been growing, so much so that about 1485 his considerable wealth enabled him to build a monumental three-storey gate-tower, housing a suite of elegant living quarters, at the west end of Hadleigh church. With its latrine tower on the south side, it boasted a series of apartments suitable for a man of his status. Indeed the architecture is unmistakably ambitious, in both artistic and social terms, looking back to such East Anglian models as Lord Cromwell's Tattershall Castle, begun in the 1430s, and Oxburgh Hall, more recently constructed by Sir Edmund Bedingfield. Function and appearance alike proclaimed Pykenham's determination to attain the elegance and comfort aspired to by other members of the ecclesiastical &eacute;lite in the late fifteenth century.<br>
<br>William Pykenham died in 1497, between 6 April, when he drew up his will, and 8 May, when it was proved. What must be his Purbeck marble tomb (it also served as an Easter sepulchre) survives on the north side of the high altar in Hadleigh church. He had provided for the saying of 1000 masses by 1000 priests for his own soul and for the souls of his parents, but otherwise his most significant legacy to an individual was that of &pound;10 and two long gowns to Thomasine Risley, perplexingly described as &#145;my sister&#146; but not otherwise recorded as a member of his family. But if Pykenham does not seem to have remembered his kinsfolk, he was generous to his employees. It is a further sign of his standing and wealth that at his death he should have maintained a household of at least nineteen servants, all named in his will, where provision was made for their being given food and drink and their usual wages for three months after their employer's death, and they also received gifts of money.<br>
<br>Otherwise Pykenham's bequests were almost entirely ecclesiastical ones. He left his accumulated lands in trust to support almshouses (effectively a refoundation of the pre-existing poorhouse), a chantry chapel in Hadleigh, and also the college at Stoke by Clare, to which he was generous in other ways, leaving &pound;20 to complete building works he had begun there, &#145;a great Bassyn of sylver parcel gylt&#146; valued at &pound;17, and all his books of law and theology. He also left a copy of Jean d'Abbeville's sermons, and three separately bound commentaries by Nicolas Gorran&#151;which are now in the British Library&#151;to the hospital of St Thomas of Acon, London. All Souls College was given a noble cope of red and gold and &pound;20, and there were bequests to a number of religious houses, nearly all in Suffolk. Moreover William remembered a high proportion of the livings of which he had at some time been parson. Little Hallingbury, his first benefice, was to have 66<i>s</i>. 8<i>d</i>. for a cope; otherwise he usually left money to the incumbent and the poor inhabitants of each parish, and typically for the fabric of their churches as well. Throughout his will Pykenham showed himself concerned for the relief of poverty. His funeral was not to be excessively grand, so that the money saved could be given to the needy, and when all his bequests had been disbursed the residue of his moveable wealth was to be spent on charitable works, and especially on provision for poor scholars at Oxford or Cambridge.<br>
<br>Given his outstanding intellectual abilities, the success of Pykenham's career seems almost preordained. Only one thing was lacking, a bishopric. In the last years of Yorkist rule vacancies on the episcopal bench were scarce, and Thomas Bourchier was becoming old and frail. Even so, Pykenham could probably have expected elevation in due course, had it not been for the change of dynasty in 1485. The new king, and then a new primate, had their own candidates for preferment, and his archdeaconry remained the summit of William's career.<br>
