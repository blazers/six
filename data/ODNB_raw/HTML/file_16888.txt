</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Locke,  Matthew</span>  (<em>c.</em>1622&#150;1677), <span class="occ">organist and composer</span>, is presumed to have been born in Devon, though attempts to link him with a Locke family resident in Exeter at the time have proved inconclusive. His date of birth is inferred from the inscription &#145;aetat 40 anno domini 1662&#146; on a portrait given to the Oxford music school. He was a choirboy at Exeter Cathedral, where his teachers could have included the master of the choristers, Edward Gibbons, the organist John Lugge, and William Wake, who acted as Lugge's deputy from 1635 to 1642. After his voice changed Locke remained at the cathedral as a secondary, an intermediate grade between chorister and lay vicar. In 1638 and 1641 he carved his name or initials in the stone organ screen; on 29 September 1640 he was admonished for fighting, and in the same year he was twice paid for copying music for the cathedral.<h2>
<a name="ThecivilwarandCommonwealth"></a>The civil war and Commonwealth</h2>Locke's activities during the civil war are unknown. Exeter initially declared for parliament, but cathedral services seem to have resumed in September 1643, when the city again came under royalist control: Charles I, Henrietta Maria, and the prince of Wales all subsequently passed through Exeter and could have encountered Locke at this time. However, Locke's name does not appear in the Exeter protestation return of February 1642, either as one of those who had taken the oath or among the minority who refused, and he may already have left the city. Later he probably joined the exiled court at The Hague, as some Italian sacred music in BL, Add. MS 31437, was copied in 1648 &#145;when I was in the Low Countreys&#146;  (fol. 29). <span class="italic">The Close Hypocrite Discovered</span> (p. 10) describes him as &#145;a Papist&#146; who had been &#145;in Arms amongst the Rebels in Ireland&#146;. He had returned to England by 1651, when he composed his <span class="italic">Little Consort</span> at the request of William Wake, and about the same time began his great scorebook, BL, Add. MS 17801, in which he collected and revised his chamber music for the rest of his life.<br>
<br>By about 1655 Locke had married Mary (<i>d</i>. 1701), daughter of the Catholic recusant Roger Garnons of Herefordshire. At least two children must have been born in the 1650s or early 1660s: the father of Locke's grandson John, executor of his grandmother's will, and Mary, who dealt with Locke's estate in 1677. In spite of religious and political differences, Locke became friendly with one of the parliamentary sequestration commissioners for Herefordshire, Silas Taylor, an enthusiastic amateur musician who provided him with a house in Hereford. Taylor's music meetings, in which Locke took a leading part, were suspected of being pretexts for assemblies of &#145;Papists and Delinquents&#146;  (<span class="italic">Close Hypocrite</span>, 10). Much of Locke's instrumental chamber music was probably composed at this time, including the two-part consort &#145;For Seaverall Freinds&#146;, the bass viol duos dated 1652, and the <span class="italic">Consort of Four Parts</span>; the title of <span class="italic">The Flatt Consort for my Cousin Kemble</span> refers to a prominent Herefordshire recusant family to whom Locke may have been related by marriage. Locke's own beliefs came under investigation when on 22 March 1654 he walked to the gallows with a condemned murderer whose final action was to proclaim the Catholic faith. Five depositions concerning this event were taken at Hereford on 29 March and 3 April 1654, including that of Matthew Price, a participant in at least one of Taylor's music meetings, who alleged that about a year previously Locke had made a compromising remark in the course of an argument. Locke was accused only of being a Catholic, not of breach of the peace, and his conduct, however imprudent, seems to have been compassionate and courageous.<br>
<br>In the mid-1650s Locke returned to London, where he became involved in the musical dramas which were the only form of public theatre permitted under the Commonwealth. He composed some of the music for William Davenant's <span class="italic">The Siege of Rhodes</span> of September 1656 and also sang the part of the Admiral. In the same year John Playford published a revised version of the 1651 <span class="italic">Little Consort</span>, and about this time Locke may have taken up a teaching post at a girls' school in Hackney, mentioned obliquely in his book <span class="italic">The Present Practice of Musick Vindicated</span>  (1673, 19). In 1659 he composed the score for a revival of James Shirley's &#145;Morall Representation&#146; <span class="italic">Cupid and Death</span>, incorporating music written by Christopher Gibbons for the first performance in 1653. Locke appears to have formed friendships with a number of other musicians as well as Gibbons: he wrote a dedicatory poem for the 1659 edition of <span class="italic">The Division Violist</span> by his &#145;dear friend&#146; Christopher Simpson, in which he expressed a distrust of music theory later reflected in other works, and Samuel Pepys met him with Silas Taylor and either Henry or Thomas Purcell at a coffee house in Westminster on 21 February 1660.<h2>
<a name="AftertheRestoration"></a>After the Restoration</h2>Locke's rapid advancement after the Restoration suggests that he was already highly regarded by Charles II, perhaps as a result of his activities in the 1640s. In June 1660 he was appointed composer in the private music and composer for the violins. The following year Locke wrote much of the music for Charles II's ceremonial progress through London on 22 April, the eve of his coronation. The collection of suites entitled <span class="italic">The First Part of the Broken Consort</span> and the unfinished <span class="italic">Second Part</span> must have been intended for the &#145;broken consort&#146; at court, a chamber music ensemble which flourished in the early 1660s. Locke also composed anthems for the Chapel Royal and from 1662 onwards was organist of Queen Catherine's Catholic chapel, until 1671 at St James's Palace and then at Somerset House. This last appointment probably provided him with accommodation, as although he was said in 1669 to be &#145;of St Martin in the Fields&#146;  (Ashbee, 1.92) his name cannot be found in the rate books. In June 1664 one Margaret Pothero received 10<i>s</i>. a week for lodging &#145;Mr Lock, organist, and his servants&#146; for seventeen weeks  (ibid., 55), at the same time as the Catholic viol player Paul Francis Bridges and John Harford, an organ blower, were lodged elsewhere, perhaps because all three were for some reason displaced from their usual apartments.<br>
<br>During the plague year, 1665, Locke accompanied the court to Oxford, where several manuscripts were annotated by Edward Lowe, the professor of music. Locke's motet <span class="italic">Ad te levavi oculos meos</span> was performed at the music school on Thursday 16 November; the previous week a new prelude and <span class="roman">Gloria</span> had been composed, added to an existing <span class="roman">Jubilate</span>, copied in parts, and performed, all between noon and 3 p.m. Back at Westminster, an unfortunate incident occurred on 1 April 1666 when Locke's responses to the commandments for some reason went badly wrong in a Chapel Royal service. Although straightforward, Locke's setting departed from precedent by consisting of ten different responses instead of repetitions of the same music. After unfair criticism that the music was excessively difficult and unusual, Locke had the score printed with his comments as <span class="italic">Modern church-musick pre-accus'd, censur'd, and obstructed in its performance before his majesty &hellip; vindicated by the author Matt. Lock</span> (1666). His reaction appears unnecessarily defensive, as his reputation does not seem to have suffered, and the most ambitious of his anthems, &#145;Be thou exalted&#146;, was performed in the Chapel Royal with great success on the 14 August following. A comparable lack of proportion marks Locke's side of a controversy about musical notation with Thomas Salmon, whose <span class="italic">An Essay to the Advancement of Music by Casting Away the perplexity of Different clefs</span> (1672) is as inoffensive in tone as it is impractical in content. Salmon inadvertently provoked Locke by inviting him to write a commendation to his <span class="italic">Essay</span>, and Locke's published replies, <span class="italic">Observations upon a Late Book, Entituled, an Essay to the Advancement of Musick</span> (1672) and <span class="italic">The Present Practice of Musick Vindicated</span> (1673), respond to Salmon's suggestions as if they constituted a personal insult. The prefaces are respectively signed &#145;From my Lodgings near the Savoy&#146; and &#145;From my Lodgings in the Strand&#146;, implying that Locke moved into new accommodation when the queen's chapel transferred to Somerset House.<br>
<br>In 1673 Locke was paid &pound;5 for composing an ode, <span class="italic">Descende caelo cincta sororibus</span>, for the Oxford &#145;act&#146;, or degree ceremony. The same year also saw the publication of <span class="italic">Melothesia, or, Certain general rules for playing upon a continued-bass. With a choice collection of lessons for the harpsichord and organ of all sorts</span>, an anthology edited by Locke containing the earliest surviving printed English instructions for realizing a figured bass. Locke had remained active as a theatre composer after the Restoration, and in the 1670s contributed to three important milestones in the development of English dramatic music: Elkanah Settle's <span class="italic">The Empress of Morocco</span>, including Locke's self-contained <span class="italic">Masque of Orpheus and Euridice</span> (3 July 1673), Thomas Shadwell's version of <span class="italic">The Tempest</span> (1674), with instrumental music by Locke, and Shadwell's <span class="italic">Psyche</span> (27 February 1675), for which Locke wrote the vocal music and &#145;the Instrumental Therein Intermix'd&#146;. Locke's sections of <span class="italic">The Tempest</span> and <span class="italic">Psyche</span> were published as <span class="italic">The English Opera</span> in 1675. His final venture into publication was <span class="italic">Tripla concordia, or, A choice collection of new airs in three parts, for treble and basse violins by several authors</span>, advertised in November 1676 and probably supervised by Locke.<br>
<br>A story related by Roger North may reflect a severe physical or mental decline suffered by Locke towards the end of his life, which may in turn explain why he did not make a will. North states that the Italian singers at the Somerset House chapel were so dissatisfied with Locke's performance that he was relegated from the great organ to a chamber organ, on which he played throughout the services, but there is no evidence of this situation in other sources, including the one surviving account book of Queen Catherine's household, from 1671/2  (Weale, xxix&#150;xxxii). Locke died, probably in his lodgings in the Strand, London, in August 1677 and was probably buried in the Anglican churchyard at St Mary Savoy, given as his parish when probate was granted to his daughter Mary on 13 December. His widow, who renounced her right to the administration of his estate, was buried at St James's, Piccadilly, on 17 July 1701. For the last few years of her life she had occupied a property in James Street, near Golden Square, and a daughter, either Mary or another unknown child, was married to Matthew Scott of Pall Mall. These circumstances suggest that Locke's widow was financially secure, in spite of difficulties caused in his lifetime by late payment of his court salaries.<h2>
<a name="Significance"></a>Significance</h2>Locke's importance to English music in the generation before Purcell cannot be overestimated. He composed significant works in every major genre: his <span class="italic">Consort of Four Parts</span> was regarded by North, who did not know Purcell's fantasias, as the last masterpiece of the English polyphonic tradition, and he excelled in expressive, declamatory vocal writing, which he turned to dramatic effect in his theatre works and combined with counterpoint in his anthems. His achievement was recognized by Henry Purcell in an elegy published in the second book of John Playford's <span class="italic">Choice Ayres</span> (1679), &#145;What hope for us remains now he is gone?&#146;, and several works survive in manuscripts copied by Purcell, Blow, and other discriminating musicians. Perhaps over-sensitive to criticism, Locke was often outspoken in defence of English music and his own works, but Lefkowitz's assessment of his character as &#145;vain, contentious and vindictive&#146;  (<span class="italic">New Grove</span>) has little or no support beyond the polemics against Salmon. In <span class="italic">Observations upon a Late Book</span>  (p. 2) Locke expresses gratitude that the civil war interrupted his career and prevented the publication of his early music before he had &#145;become sensible of the vanity and impudency of it&#146;. His autograph sources bear witness to rigorous editing and revision of mature works, and high standards of artistic, religious, and personal integrity seem to have been as prominent in his character as any more negative elements sometimes evident.<br>
