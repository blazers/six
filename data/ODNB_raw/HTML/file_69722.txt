<span class="headword">Powell,  Colin Trevor <span class="st"> [Cozy]</span></span>  (1947&#150;1998), <span class="occ">rock musician</span>, was born on 29 December 1947 at Cirencester, Gloucestershire. Adopted, he never discovered the identity of his natural parents. He was married but divorced.<br>
<br>Cozy Powell was one of rock's most celebrated drummers. His powerful style was a feature of many of the biggest rock groups of the 1970s and 1980s, including Rainbow, Whitesnake, and Black Sabbath. He also epitomized the flamboyant rock star. Lean and muscular, his dark hair worn long, Powell loved to drive fast cars and motorcycles and was photographed in racing leathers and astride a powerful &#145;superbike&#146; on the cover of Rainbow's 1980 album <span class="italic">Down to Earth</span>, the most successful recording of his thirty-year career. He had raced formula 3 cars before joining Rainbow in 1975.<br>
<br>As a teenager Powell played in a variety of groups, including Big Bertha and the Sorcerors, before he was recruited by leading British guitarist Jeff Beck, who had been Eric Clapton's replacement in the Yardbirds. Powell appeared on two albums by the Jeff Beck Group, <span class="italic">Rough and Ready</span> (1971) and <span class="italic">Jeff Beck Group</span> (1972). Both albums sold well in America but less so in Britain, and when Beck split the group Powell formed his own heavy rock band, Bedlam, with singer Frank Aiello, guitarist Dave Ball, and bassist Dennis Ball. Bedlam released one album, simply titled <span class="italic">Bedlam</span>, on the Chrysalis label in 1973.<br>
<br>Powell was also in demand as a session musician, and played uncredited on numerous pop records of the early 1970s. Noted producer Mickie Most hired him to work on singles by Donovan and Hot Chocolate, and encouraged Powell to make a solo recording. His first solo single, &#145;Dance with the Devil&#146;, was a number three hit in the UK in December 1973&#151;a rare distinction indeed for a drummer. Powell formed a new ensemble, Cozy Powell's Hammer, to capitalize on his success with a British tour. Two more top twenty hits followed in 1974 (&#145;The Man in Black&#146;, which reached number eighteen, and &#145;Na na na&#146;, a second top ten hit) before Powell accepted an invitation from former Deep Purple guitarist Ritchie Blackmore to join his new group, Rainbow.<br>
<br>With Rainbow, Cozy Powell's star rose to its highest point. The first album he recorded with the band, <span class="italic">Rainbow Rising</span>, peaked at number eleven in the UK chart and is widely acknowledged as a classic example of 1970s rock. Powell's contribution to the track entitled &#145;Stargazer&#146; helped to establish the song as Rainbow's defining moment and confirmed Powell as one of the leading rock musicians of his generation, a worthy successor to Led Zeppelin's formidable drummer, John Bonham.<br>
<br>Powell recorded three more albums with Rainbow: <span class="italic">On Stage</span> (1977), <span class="italic">Long Live Rock &#145;n&#146; Roll</span> (1978), and <span class="italic">Down to Earth</span> (1979). The latter produced two hit singles in &#145;Since You Been Gone&#146;, which reached number six in September 1979, and &#145;All Night Long&#146;, which peaked at number five in February 1980 and featured a typically powerful performance from Powell, whose solo single &#145;Theme One&#146; became his final British chart entry in November 1979. In August 1980 Rainbow topped the bill at the inaugural Monsters of Rock festival at Castle Donington racetrack in Leicestershire, drawing an audience of 50,000.<br>
<br>Despite the group's success, Powell quit Rainbow near the end of 1980 and joined the Michael Schenker Group, led by the acclaimed guitarist whose reputation had been established in German hard rock act Scorpions and with British band UFO. This liaison lasted for two years and two 1981 albums: <span class="italic">MSG</span> and <span class="italic">One Night at Budokan</span>. Then Powell was tempted to work with another former Deep Purple star, singer David Coverdale, in Whitesnake. In a turbulent time for the group Powell appeared on the album <span class="italic">Slide it in</span> (1984), which laid the foundation for Whitesnake's huge success in North America in the late 1990s. He also starred on a solo album by The Who's vocalist, Roger Daltrey, entitled <span class="italic">Under a Raging Moon</span> and dedicated to the memory of Daltrey's late bandmate Keith Moon, whose aggressive style of drumming had a profound influence on Powell. His sometime collaborator Neil Murray wrote that Powell was &#145;the most powerful drummer I have played with &hellip; [he] always tried to get &#147;his&#148; sound captured on record, which used a lot of room acoustic to achieve a huge sound&#146;. Live, he &#145;liked to put on a very visual show &hellip; and &hellip; became famous for his drum solos, which incorporated explosions, strobes and flame jets, which many other drummers copied&#146;. Powell's musical tastes were eclectic, and his shows &#145;usually included him playing along to pieces of music such as Tchaikovsky's <span class="roman">1812 Overture</span>&#146;  (Siegler).<br>
<br>Powell was a member of Whitesnake when the band took top billing at Castle Donington in 1983 and at the Rock in Rio festival in 1985, but at the close of 1985 he joined Keith Emerson and Greg Lake in reactivating virtuoso progressive rock trio ELP. In 1989 Powell was lured by another legendary rock band, Black Sabbath, which he left two years later having suffered an injury in a riding accident. He appears on three Black Sabbath albums: <span class="italic">Headless Cross</span> (1989), <span class="italic">Tyr</span> (1990), and <span class="italic">Forbidden</span> (1995).<br>
<br>In the 1990s Cozy Powell recorded and toured with former Queen guitarist Brian May (he is featured on May's 1993 album <span class="italic">Back to the Light</span> and 1998's <span class="italic">Another World</span>) and with former Fleetwood Mac guitarist Peter Green's Splinter Group. Powell, noted for his likeable personality, secured Green's return to the stage following a drug-related breakdown in the late 1960s.<br>
<br>Powell recorded four solo albums: <span class="italic">Over the Top</span> (1979), <span class="italic">Tilt</span> (1981), <span class="italic">Octopus</span> (1983), and <span class="italic">The Drums are Back</span> (1992). He also played on former Led Zeppelin vocalist Robert Plant's <span class="italic">Pictures at Eleven</span> (1982), Gary Moore's <span class="italic">After the War</span> (1989), and Judas Priest guitarist Glenn Tipton's <span class="italic">Baptism of Fire</span> (1998).<br>
<br>Shortly before his death Powell sustained several broken ribs when his new Harley Davidson motorcycle collided with a tractor on a narrow country lane. Unfortunately, the accident did not dampen his enthusiasm for high-speed driving. On the night he died&#151;5 April 1998&#151;Powell was reported to have been travelling at close to 100 m.p.h. on the M4 near Bristol when his Saab vehicle veered from the road. It was also reported that he had been using a mobile phone, the safety of which devices in motor vehicles was a matter of public debate at the time. He died from his injuries at Frenchay Hospital, and his body was cremated in Wiltshire on 18 April 1998; a memorial concert was held in Buxton on 1 May 1999.<br>
