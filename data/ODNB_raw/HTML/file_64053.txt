<span class="headword">Murray,  Ruby Florence Campbell</span>  (1935&#150;1996), <span class="occ">singer</span>, was born on 29 March 1935 at 84 Moltke Street, Donegal Road, Belfast, the youngest of four children of Daniel Murray (<i>d</i>. 1969?), a labourer, originally from Scotland, and Wilhelmina (Winifred) Murray, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Connolly (<i>d</i>. 1989). She was named after a 20-stone local comedienne and chip shop assistant but in her pomp became as much part of the mythology of Belfast as George Best and Harland and Wolff. Furthermore she has achieved immortality in British folklore, as &#145;a Ruby Murray&#146; has evolved as rhyming slang for &#145;a curry&#146;.<br>
<br>Murray left school in Fane Street aged fourteen and worked in several teenage deadbeat jobs. Her ambition to be a singer, however, was fired at the age of four when she was taken to see G. H. Elliott, the music-hall entertainer known as the &#145;chocolate coloured coon&#146;. Against a background of strict laws regarding child performers, she began singing solo aged ten on various stages&#151;large, small, and makeshift&#151;throughout Ireland and Britain. Four years after her professional d&eacute;but at the age of twelve, she joined the cast of a touring revue, <span class="italic">Yankee Doodle Blarney</span>. Playing at the Metropolitan Theatre in London's Edgware Road she was spotted again by producer Richard Afton, who had been responsible for her pre-teen Irish television appearances. He signed her to succeed Joan Regan as resident singer in the television series <span class="italic">Quite Contrary</span> and two days later she made a record&#151;&#145;Getwell Soon&#146;&#151;for conductor Ray Martin's Columbia Records, but it made little impression. Her second release at the beginning of 1955 was &#145;Heartbeat&#146;, the success of which led her to take the pop world by storm, her massive popularity making her one of the most successful stars in the history of British popular music. In November of that year she was voted favourite female vocalist by readers of <span class="italic">New Musical Express</span>, receiving 1000 more votes than Alma Cogan and twelve times as many as Petula Clark.<br>
<br>With an immediately recognizable voice, intimately husky, gentle, and soothing, Ruby Murray's simple style disguised skilful phrasing coupled with a freshness and an appearance of vulnerability and innocence. Once she had five records simultaneously in the top twenty, the accolade list of the 1950s, and her total of eighty weeks in the music charts was surpassed by no other female artist until Madonna in 1985. She earned the sobriquet &#145;Heartbeat Girl&#146; after her first hit, but perhaps her indelible signature tune was &#145;Softly, Softly&#146;, a wistful love ballad sung with an Irish lilt and trademark involuntary catch in the throat. During a hectic period in the mid-1950s she starred with Norman Wisdom in <span class="italic">Painting the Town</span> at the London Palladium, had her own television show and, proving she could dance as well as sing, topped the bill in variety and pantomime, performing also overseas wherever British troops were based. She had a mixed reception in the United States, sometimes mobbed by hysterical crowds and warmly commended by Frank Sinatra, but booed in a Chicago club for refusing to sing Irish rebel songs. She sang the theme song to a rather limp comic film <span class="italic">It's Great to be Young</span> (1956) but in the same year gave a refreshing and totally natural performance as a singing chambermaid in the film <span class="italic">A Touch of the Sun</span>, starring Frankie Howerd.<br>
<br>On 23 August 1957 Ruby Murray married Bernard Burgess (<i>b</i>. 1929?), a member of the Jones Boys harmony group. They had a son and a daughter. She enjoyed further modest hits in the UK in 1959 and 1970, and continued to tour at home and abroad&#151;notably in Africa&#151;but never recaptured the success that she had enjoyed in the mid-1950s. Her increasing dependence on alcohol and valium put both her career and her marriage under strain; the latter was further undermined by her infatuation with the comedian Frank Carson, which made her rendition of &#145;I'll Walk the Rest of the Way&#146;&#151;a song about an extra-marital affair&#151;seem bleakly autobiographical. She and Burgess were eventually divorced in 1977; thereafter she lived with Ray Lamar, a theatrical impresario, and they married in 1993.<br>
<br>Always fondly remembered by many, Ruby Murray was greeted with a standing ovation when she appeared with a host of other stars in the <span class="italic">Forty Years of Peace</span> concert programme (1985). Yet four years earlier she had been fined for drunk and disorderly conduct in Torquay and her final London appearance in March 1993 revealed a frail and uncertain performer. She died of bronchial pneumonia and liver cancer in Torbay Hospital on 17 December 1996. Her obituary in the <span class="italic">Irish News</span> (18 Dec 1996) stressed that &#145;her memory will remain a potent force in the lives of many, particularly in Northern Ireland&#146; but her background had left her ill-equipped to cope with the pressures of stardom and with increasing adversity. A bittersweet tale of triumph and transformation is told in the play <span class="italic">Ruby</span> by Marie Jones, performed in April 2000, recalling 1950s Belfast when, for a time, she had held the world in her hands.<br>
