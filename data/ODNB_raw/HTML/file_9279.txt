<span class="headword">Fenn <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Frere]</span>,  Ellenor</span> <span class="st"> [<em>pseuds. </em>Mrs Teachwell, Mrs Lovechild]</span>, Lady Fenn  (1744&#150;1813), <span class="occ">educationist and children's author</span>, was born in Westhorpe, Suffolk, on 12 March 1744, the third child of Sheppard Frere (1712&#150;1780) of Thwaite, Suffolk, and his wife, Susanna (1709/10&#150;1779), daughter of John Hatley of London. As a child she was &#145;of strong original understanding and great accomplishment&#146;  (Festing, 294). On 1 January 1766 she married the antiquary <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9283/', "John Fenn (1739&#150;1794)")</script> and settled at Hill House, East Dereham, Norfolk. They had no children but raised an orphaned heiress, Miss Andrews, and frequently looked after their nephews and nieces, particularly William Frere, who described &#145;looking up to my uncle and aunt as parents&#146;  (W. Frere, ix).<br>
<br>Ellenor's interest in children's literature developed during the 1770s as she wrote, illustrated, and bound manuscript books for her nieces and nephews. She was influenced by Anna Letitia Barbauld's <span class="italic">Lessons for Children</span> (1778) and contacted the London publisher John Marshall, who issued most of Ellenor's works from 1782 to 1812 either anonymously or under the pseudonyms Mrs Teachwell or Mrs Lovechild. Works by Solomon Lovechild and Timothy Teachwell are sometimes attributed to her, but these attributions are doubtful. As most of her books were undated and passed through several editions it is difficult to determine the order of publication. Early titles from 1782&#150;3 provided instructions in manners: <span class="italic">School Occurrences</span>, <span class="italic">Juvenile Correspondence</span>, and <span class="italic">School Dialogues for Boys</span>. Her most famous title, <span class="italic">Cobwebs to Catch Flies</span> (1783&#150;4), contained dialogues for teaching reading. A copy was received in the royal nursery, and it went through many editions in Britain and America until the 1870s.<br>
<br>Ellenor was particularly interested in educating girls, and many titles were issued in the series <span class="roman">Mrs Teachwell's Library for Young Ladies</span>. Her <span class="italic">Female Guardian</span> (1784) contained moral anecdotes about pupils at a school for girls and included a critique of Horace Walpole's <span class="italic">Castle of Otranto</span>. She published one book of fables (1783), with explanatory &#145;morals&#146; as dialogues between mother and child, but usually disapproved of imaginative works, arguing &#145;there is no need for invention, the world is full of wonders&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Rational Dame</span>, 1790?). Likewise her <span class="italic">Fairy Spectator</span> has been described as a &#145;mean-spirited anti-fairy tale&#146;  (Jackson, 147) in which the heroine realizes that her beautiful dreams are illusory.<br>
<br>Ellenor was not only concerned with writing for children but also with providing their mothers with the materials and the self-confidence to educate them. <span class="italic">The Child's Grammar</span> (1799?) was &#145;designed to enable ladies who may not have attended to the subject themselves to instruct their children&#146;  (title-page). Her <span class="italic">Rational Sports</span> (1783?) contained advice about how mothers &#145;may inform the minds of their little people&#146;  (title-page). She likewise compiled a number of games and other teaching aids, many of which have been lost. <span class="italic">The Art of Teaching in Sport</span> (1785?) was designed to accompany &#145;a set of toys, for enabling ladies to instill the rudiments of spelling, reading, grammar, and arithmetic, under the idea of amusement&#146;  (title-page). <span class="italic">The Mother's Grammar</span> (1798?) was accompanied by an elaborate <span class="italic">Game of Grammar</span>. She also advertised a series of books, &#145;Schemes for teaching under the idea of amusement&#146;, including <span class="italic">The Infant's Delight</span> to teach reading and <span class="italic">The Figure Scheme, or, Figures Rendered Pleasant for Children</span>. She realized the importance of pictures as an aid to learning and published several volumes of woodcuts for children, and seems to have maintained a close practical contact with her publisher in the layout and production of her works, which contain large types with wide margins. She received no payment for her works, merely free copies to distribute to friends.<br>
<br>Ellenor broke with Marshall in 1795 (possibly over his dealings with Hannah More's <span class="italic">Cheap Repository</span> tracts). Her new titles were thereafter published in Norwich (<span class="italic">The Village Matron</span>, 1795, and <span class="italic">The Short History of Insects</span>, 1796) or by Elizabeth Newbery and her successors in London (<span class="italic">The Infant's Friend</span>, 1797, <span class="italic">The Friend to Mothers</span>, 1799, and <span class="italic">Family Miscellany</span>, 1805). Marshall continued to publish editions of her established works.<br>
<br>John Fenn was knighted in 1787 and served as high sheriff of Norfolk in 1791&#150;2. His death, on 14 February 1794, left Ellenor financially secure, enabling her to spend her remaining years carrying out good works in her locality. In 1785 she had been the prime mover in establishing a Sunday school, which by 1788 was teaching over 100 poor children; she was also among &#145;the most respectable Dereham ladies&#146; who taught the girls  (Boston and Puddy, 291). Later she introduced a needlework school and revived the trade of tow-spinning to give poor women an income. Borrow portrays her in old age as the &#145;Lady Bountiful&#146; of Dereham, &#145;generous and kind, who loved to visit the sick, leaning on her gold-headed cane&#146;  (Borrow, 17). She died at Dereham on 1 November 1813, and was buried at Finningham church, Suffolk.<br>
<br>Ellenor Fenn's works were popular and well reviewed in her day and regularly reprinted until the 1860s. However, her formulaic output, her disapproval of imaginative stories, her insistence on class distinctions, and her determination &#145;to correct some of the foibles incident to girls&#146;  (Mrs Teachwell, <span class="italic">Female Guardian</span>, title-page) have not endeared her to twentieth-century critics. Darton considered that she had &#145;something of the professional moralist or even hack in her&#146;  (Darton, 163). Muir includes her in &#145;a monstrous regiment&#146; of women authors &#145;who had no preconceptions beyond turning out persuasive didacticisms of the sort that publishers could sell&#146;  (Muir, 84). Jackson refers to the &#145;oppressive discipline and intense moralizing&#146; of her works  (Jackson, 147). Yet she had humour and realized that the educational process must be enjoyable to both adult and child. Above all she had the gift of communicating with children at their own level. To that extent her chosen epithets of Lovechild and Teachwell were appropriate. Her will, proved on 29 December 1813, left the bulk of her substantial estate to her favourite nephew, William Frere, with smaller bequests to her remaining nephews, nieces, and godchildren.<br>
