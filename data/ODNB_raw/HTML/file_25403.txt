<span class="headword">Shilleto,  Richard</span>  (1809&#150;1876), <span class="occ">classical scholar</span>, son of John Shilleto of Ulleskelf, Yorkshire, was born there on 25 November 1809. He was educated first at Repton and then under Dr Samuel Butler at Shrewsbury School, where he was head boy. He was admitted to Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1828 and was made a scholar in 1830. W. H. Thompson, later regius professor of Greek and master of Trinity, was among his exact contemporaries. Shilleto was second in the first class of the classical tripos. In his day, however, candidates for honours had to satisfy the examiners in both this and the mathematical tripos in which Shilleto was unfortunately bracketed bottom in 1832. On 7 January 1834 he married Isabella Snelgar; they had one daughter and seven sons, three of whom followed him to Cambridge. Shilleto proceeded MA in 1835 and was ordained in 1838, but owing to his marriage he could not become the fellow of a college, although he examined in the classical tripos in 1839 and 1840 and was for many years a college lecturer at Trinity and at King's.<br>
<br>The introduction of the classical tripos in 1824 had not resulted in much improvement in the preparation provided by college teachers, so virtually every candidate for honours had to go to a private coach whom he paid to correct the translations and more especially the compositions which formed the bulk of the examination. Shilleto quickly became the most celebrated of Cambridge coaches, a reputation he maintained for over thirty years. He taught most of those who were themselves to become leading school and university teachers, and thus his influence was far wider than that of any other Cambridge classical instructor of the time. His reputation was based upon his industry (in 1859 he was reported as coaching three days of eleven hours and three of twelve each week), the success of his pupils, and his eccentricity. He enjoyed controversy whether in scholarship (as in his intemperate attack, published in 1851, on the accuracy of Grote's knowledge of Thucydides in his <span class="italic">History of Greece</span>) or local affairs, which he often celebrated in classical or English verse.<br>
<br>Shilleto was a heavy drinker, and this hindered his professional advancement. In 1862 he was an unsuccessful candidate for the chair of Greek at Durham, despite having assembled a dozen impressive testimonials from leading scholars. In 1867 he should have been a strong contender for the regius chair at Cambridge vacated by his contemporary W. H. Thompson, but it was annexed to a canonry at Ely for which he was not deemed suitable. In the same year, however, he was elected a fellow of Peterhouse under a statute which permitted the election of eminent married scholars. He gave up coaching and was appointed assistant tutor, dean, praelector, and librarian. He died at 4 Bateman Street, Cambridge, on 24 September 1876. Despite his years of coaching he left under &pound;3000. His widow was granted a civil-list pension of &pound;150 in 1878, and his daughter, Catherine, one of &pound;50 in 1890.<br>
<br>Shilleto was regarded as the greatest Greek scholar in England since Gaisford. His particular expertise was in Greek prose diction, but he left few published proofs of his learning. His only complete editions were of Demosthenes <span class="italic">De falsa legatione</span> (1844, and three further editions during his lifetime) and Thucydides book 1 (1872). He produced various &#145;adversaria&#146; to classical authors, including Thucydides, Hyperides, and Aristotle. Many of his books, some of which are in the Cambridge University Library, contain detailed unpublished marginalia. He contributed to early volumes of the <span class="italic">Journal of Philology</span> and, under the anagram Charles Thiriold, to <span class="italic">Notes and Queries</span>. His skill as a translator into Greek and Latin prose and verse is exhibited by the large selection of his compositions published in 1901, as well as by contributions to the anthologies <span class="italic">Sabrinae corolla</span> and <span class="italic">Arundines Cami</span>.<br>
<br>Shilleto's son, <a name="cosubject_25403"></a><span class="headword">Arthur Richard Shilleto</span>  (1848&#150;1894), <span class="occ">translator</span>, was born in Cambridge on 18 June 1848, and educated at Harrow, before proceeding in 1867 to Trinity College, Cambridge, where he graduated BA as a scholar in 1871 and MA in 1876. Ordained deacon in 1871 and priest in 1872, he served curacies until 1877 when he was appointed second master at King Edward VI's Grammar School at Stratford upon Avon. From 1879 to 1882 he was master of Ulverston School. He was curate of Satterthwaite, Lancashire, from 1881 to 1883, and of Lower Slaughter, Gloucestershire, from 1883 to 1885. He produced translations of Pausanias (2 vols., 1886), Plutarch's <span class="italic">Morals</span> (1888), and <span class="italic">Josephus</span> (5 vols., 1889&#150;90). He also prepared notes for an edition of Robert Burton's <span class="italic">Anatomy of Melancholy</span> (1893) and was a frequent contributor to <span class="italic">Notes and Queries</span> under the anagram Erato Hills. After many years' suffering from mental illness, Shilleto died on 19 January 1894.<br>
