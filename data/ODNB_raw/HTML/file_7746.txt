</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Doddridge,  Philip</span>  (1702&#150;1751), <span class="occ">Independent minister and writer</span>, was born on 26 June 1702 in London, the last of the twenty children of Daniel Doddridge (<i>d</i>. 1715), an oilman or dealer in oils and pickles, and his wife, Monica Bauman (<i>d</i>. 1711). His father was a son of John Doddridge (1621&#150;1689), rector of Shepperton, Middlesex, who resigned his living after the <span class="roman">Act of Uniformity</span> and became a nonconformist minister, and a great-nephew of the judge and MP Sir John Doddridge (1555&#150;1628). His mother was the daughter of John Bauman (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1668), a protestant refugee who fled from Prague in 1626; after spending twenty years in Germany he moved to London in 1646 and set up a school at Kingston, Surrey. Doddridge inherited his grandfather's German <span class="roman">Bible</span>, and recorded in it his flight from persecution  (Deacon, 29). Only one of Doddridge's siblings survived infancy, his elder sister, Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1735), who married John Nettleton, a schoolmaster at Hampstead and then a dissenting minister at Ongar, Essex. On both sides of his family Doddridge was descended from men who had suffered for their religion, and he was obviously proud of this inheritance, but he was also conscious of the social position of his Doddridge forebears. His lawyer uncle Philip Doddridge (<i>d</i>. 1715), some of whose books he inherited, was steward to the first duke of Bedford. The place of evangelical religion in polite society was a question that was to concern his nephew greatly.<h2>
<a name="Education"></a>Education</h2>When very young, Doddridge was taught <span class="roman">Bible</span> stories by his mother from the Dutch tiles in the fireplace. He was sent first to a private tutor, Mr Stott, and then in 1712 he was put under the Presbyterian minister Daniel Mayo at the school in Kingston founded by his grandfather. He spent his holidays on the Bedford estates with his uncle, and kept up his friendship with the Russell family in later life. At the age of eight he lost his mother; at the age of thirteen, after the deaths of his father and uncle, he was made ward to a Mr Downes, who moved him to a school at St Albans run by another dissenter, Dr Nathaniel Wood. In St Albans he boarded in the same house as the Presbyterian minister Samuel Clark, who was to become one of the three most important influences on his intellectual and religious development. Though not a master, Clark took charge of his education. In the dedication of his funeral sermon for Clark, <span class="italic">Meditations on the Tears of Jesus</span>, preached at St Albans on 16 December 1750, Doddridge described him as &#145;my ever honoured friend and father&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 3.382). Downes, on the other hand, proved to be an utterly unsuitable guardian: in 1718 he lost his ward's inheritance through speculation. Many years later Doddridge described himself as &#145;an Orphan quite defrauded &amp; stripd of all by those that should have been my Guardians&#146;  (Nuttall, <span class="italic">Calendar</span>, no. 1016). As a result he left St Albans to stay with his sister and brother-in-law in Hampstead while he made up his mind about his future. The duchess of Bedford offered to provide for him at Oxford or Cambridge so that he could take orders in the Church of England, but he was already, at sixteen, considering the dissenting ministry. The dissenting historian and spokesman Edmund Calamy, from whom he sought advice, told him to think of another profession. He was offered the opportunity to train as a lawyer, but instead Clark undertook to give him a temporary home in St Albans and find him a place at a dissenting academy. In October 1719, at seventeen, he became a student at the academy of the Independent minister John Jennings, first at Kibworth Harcourt, south-east of Leicester, and then from July 1722 at Hinckley, about 10 miles west of Kibworth. On 24 January 1723 he was satisfactorily examined by three neighbouring ministers; he left Hinckley on 1 June, having completed the four-year course shortly before his twenty-first birthday. Jennings died of smallpox on 8 July 1723, and the academy closed.<br>
<br>After Clark, Jennings was the second person decisively to shape Doddridge's way of thinking and his future career. Invaluable information survives about his studies and Jennings's methods, in the form of his letters to Clark (who paid most of his bills), Nettleton, and others, books he owned while a student, and Jennings's manuscript notebooks. He told Clark on 22 September 1722 that Jennings encouraged &#145;the greatest freedom of inquiry&#146; and did not follow &#145;the doctrines or phrases of any particular party&#146;  (Nuttall, <span class="italic">Calendar</span>, no. 35); he told Nettleton on 27 February 1723 that Jennings &#145;furnishes us with all kinds of authors upon every subject, without advising us to skip over the heretical passages for fear of infection&#146;  (<span class="italic">Correspondence</span>, 1.198). On 16 November 1725 he wrote a long letter to Thomas Saunders, minister at Kettering, with a detailed account of the range of topics covered in the eight halves of the course; in October 1728 he completed the 64-page manuscript &#145;Account of Mr Jennings's method of academical education with some reflections upon it in a letter to a friend&#146;. During his period at the academy he read very widely, in divinity, philosophy, classical and French literature, and history (he read sixty books in one half-year in addition to the parts of books to which Jennings referred in his lectures). He told Nettleton in February 1722 that Tillotson was his particular favourite. He also developed the habits of intense self-discipline and husbandry of time that were to prove essential for the demands of his later career. The &#145;Rules for the direction of my conduct while a student&#146; written in his copy of the <span class="roman">New Testament</span> include the warning, &#145;Never let me trifle with a book with which I may have no present concern &hellip; [L]et me continually endeavour to make all my studies subservient to practical religion and Ministerial usefulness&#146;  (ibid., 1.97).<h2>
<a name="MinisteratKibworthHarcourt"></a>Minister at Kibworth Harcourt</h2>Doddridge preached his first sermon at Nuneaton on 30 July 1722, while still a student. In April 1723 he was invited to Kibworth, which had been without a minister since Jennings's removal to Hinckley; the congregation, consisting mostly of farmers and graziers, numbered fewer than 250, and the salary was only &pound;35 p.a. Advised by Clark to accept, in the meantime Doddridge was tempted by the prospect of an invitation to Coventry, with a very large congregation of 1200 members. By May he had accepted Kibworth, as support for him at Coventry was not unanimous. On 1 June he moved to a village near Kibworth called Little Stretton, where he boarded with a farmer called Thomas Perkins; later he moved to Burton Overy, another nearby village, to the house of William Freeman, whose daughter Kitty rejected him after a long courtship. As his situation with the Freemans had become difficult he moved in September 1725 to Market Harborough (inconveniently further from Kibworth), where he boarded with John Jennings's widow and turned his attentions, again unsuccessfully, to her daughter Jenny. He remained with Mrs Jennings until December 1729.<br>
<br>The work at Kibworth was not onerous: Doddridge was required to preach twice a week in winter and once in summer, though after moving to Harborough he also preached there for the minister, David Some, who had been one of his examiners. He described himself in December 1723 as &#145;moderately inclined&#146; to the Congregational form, &#145;our method of discipline at Kibworth, as it was in the time of Mr Jennings&#146;  (Nuttall, <span class="italic">Calendar</span>, no. 91). He told Clark on 17 February 1725 that he liked the Kibworth ministry because &#145;I may have an Opportenity of dealing very plainly in the pulpit, wch perhaps amongst a nicer People I might not at these years have ye Confidence to do&#146;  (DWL, LNC MS L1/10/5). His biographer Andrew Kippis, who heard Doddridge read these carefully prepared Kibworth sermons in later years to his students, thought them &#145;far superior&#146; to those he then had time for  (Kippis, 271). In his rural solitude, in which he lived &#145;buried alive&#146; or &#145;like a tortoise shut up in its shell&#146;  (Nuttall, <span class="italic">Calendar</span>, nos. 129, 144), Doddridge spent most of his time continuing his programme of study. He received money for books from both the Presbyterian and the Congregational funds&#151;he told Nettleton on 5 August 1725 that he had bought &pound;20 worth of books in two years  (<span class="italic">Correspondence</span>, 2.57); he also belonged to a book society, had access to the libraries of neighbouring ministers, and borrowed from his Kibworth congregation the books they had in their houses, chiefly seventeenth-century works of practical religion. His great love was Richard Baxter: he received a set of his <span class="italic">Practical Works</span> (1707) in 1724 (now in Dr Williams's Library), and observations in his letters and resolutions in his diaries indicate how carefully he read them. Reading Baxter's <span class="italic">Gildas Salvianus: the Reformed Pastor</span> made him think he should spend more time among his people and less on his studies. He was not ordained at Kibworth (which meant that he could not administer the Lord's supper), though there are several references in his letters from 1724 to 1728 to his intention to be so. His reputation was obviously increasing, and he received several further invitations during his Kibworth years from other congregations: Coventry again; Pershore, Worcestershire&#151;&#145;a very rigid set of people&#146;  (Nuttall, <span class="italic">Calendar</span>, no. 84); Girdlers' Hall, London, which Clark was keen for him to accept  (ibid., no. 89); Bradfield, Norfolk; New Court, Carey Street, Lincoln's Inn Fields, London; and two separate Nottingham congregations, Independent at Castle Gate and Presbyterian at High Pavement. He refused partly because of emotional ties, partly because the Kibworth congregation would be in difficulty without him, and partly because, having been taught by Jennings &#145;that latitude of expression which the Scriptures indulge and recommend&#146;, he could not accept the obligation &#145;to talk in the phrases of the [Westminster] assembly's catechism&#146; at Girdlers' Hall or the high orthodoxy of some members of Castle Gate  (ibid., nos. 108, 315).<br>
<br>Meanwhile a new career was opening up. According to Job Orton, his biographer and close friend, Jennings had asked Doddridge when he left Hinckley to add to and improve his course of lectures, and Doddridge later learned that Jennings thought him &#145;the most likely of any of his Pupils, to pursue the Schemes which he had formed&#146;  (Orton, <span class="italic">Memoirs</span>, 48). He was fully responsible for bringing up Jennings's son John. In November 1726 he began going through some of Jennings's course with a pupil who had started it just before his tutor's death, and in December 1727 Thomas Saunders asked him to take his brother Joseph as a pupil, boarding with Mrs Jennings, to which Doddridge agreed in early 1729. Late in 1728 Doddridge's &#145;Account of Mr Jennings's method&#146; (originally written for Thomas Benyon, who died just as Doddridge was finishing it) was shown to Isaac Watts, the leading educational theorist among the dissenters. Watts, who was to become the third key influence on Doddridge's development after Clark and Jennings, was impressed by the account and thought him a suitable person to continue the academy. On 10 April 1729 at a meeting of ministers in Lutterworth, Some proposed the establishment of the new academy at Market Harborough under Doddridge. Though he had initially refused Saunders's request, after seeking advice from Calamy among others Doddridge began teaching a small group of students at Whitsuntide 1729. This was the beginning of what was to become the most influential of eighteenth-century dissenting academies.<h2>
<a name="MinisteratNorthampton"></a>Minister at Northampton</h2>Not long after he had established himself as a tutor at Market Harborough, Doddridge received an invitation from a local congregation. Castle Hill Church, Northampton, had been without a minister since Thomas Tingey's departure for Fetter Lane, London, at the end of 1728. On 28 September 1729 the congregation, having heard Doddridge preach to them occasionally, formally invited him to preach among them as a candidate for a month, &#145;in order for whole Satisfaction&#146;  (Deacon, 59). Clark, Some, and Doddridge all hesitated because of the double burden of a new academy and a large church on a young man, but the congregation were persuasive. On 21 October they applied to Clark, earnestly asking for Doddridge to settle among them, and agreeing to facilitate the transfer of the academy and recompense Mrs Jennings. Doddridge, having twice in November sought the advice of Watts and other London ministers, finally accepted the invitation on 6 December, and despite his distress at leaving the Jennings household moved to Northampton on Christmas eve 1729. His salary was &pound;70 p.a. On 19 March 1730 he was ordained, with Clark giving the charge. He was to remain based in Northampton as pastor and tutor for the rest of his working life.<br>
<br>The meeting-house at Castle Hill was built in 1695, but the church, Presbyterian in origin, was in existence in some form by 1674. The Independent Samuel Blower, ejected from Woodstock, Oxfordshire, after the <span class="roman">Act of Uniformity</span> in 1662, became its first minister. He was succeeded in 1694 by Thomas Shepherd or Shepard, under whom the church building was erected, and then in 1699, after a three-year gap, by John Hunt (like Shepard a hymn writer), and in 1709 by Doddridge's predecessor, Tingey. In the 1690s Castle Hill had an uneasy relationship with what was to become in 1697 College Lane Church (later College Street), the Baptist church in Northampton associated with the Congregationalist Richard Davis of Rothwell. Under Doddridge these denominational differences, which had been the cause of much bitterness, ceased to be significant. His ministry became the source of a new and eclectic kind of dissent in which seventeenth-century puritanism and eighteenth-century freedom of thought fed into the evangelical revival.<br>
<br>Soon after moving to Northampton, Doddridge set out his views on what the distinctive character of modern dissent should be in the anonymous pamphlet <span class="italic">Free Thoughts on the most Probable Means of Reviving the Dissenting Interest</span> (1730), his first important publication, written in answer to Strickland Gough's <span class="italic">Enquiry into the Causes of the Decay of the Dissenting Interest</span> (1730), also anonymous. Gough blamed the falling membership of dissenting congregations on neglect of the fundamental dissenting principle of liberty of conscience, and attacked dissenting ministers for their anachronistic adherence to the manners of their puritan forebears. Doddridge agreed with Gough on the damage caused by &#145;unscriptural impositions&#146; (it was for this reason that he had turned down invitations from several congregations), but he insisted that the crucial issue was the revival of practical religion. The minister should be in the fullest sense popular: &#145;he who would be generally agreeable to dissenters, must be an evangelical, an experimental, a plain and an affectionate preacher&#146;. Where Gough emphasized liberty and politeness, Doddridge's key terms were &#145;piety and catholicism&#146;. He claimed that these methods, as practised by his &#145;fathers and brethren&#146;, had brought about an increase in membership in the Northampton region in the last twenty years  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 4.202, 204, 213, 219, 220).<br>
<br>Information about Doddridge's activities as a minister in Northampton and beyond can be gained from his diaries, letters, and published sermons, the church book still held at Castle Hill (drawn on by Deacon), and the biographies by his former pupils Orton and Kippis. In his diaries (transcribed by Thomas Stedman from shorthand) he habitually considered himself &#145;in the treble view, of a Pastor, a Tutor, and a Student&#146;; as pastor he devoted every afternoon from 2 to 6 to visiting members of the congregation, especially &#145;servants, young people, children, and those under serious impressions&#146;, and to catechizing  (<span class="italic">Correspondence</span>, 5.273, 281). He encouraged the young men to form religious associations. He preached twice on Sundays and administered the Lord's supper once a month, reviewing his activities in his diary each sacrament day. He also preached in surrounding villages to outlying members of his congregation. From 1741 he had four elders (including Orton) and six deacons to help him with administration and pastoral visits. He kept a close eye on the numbers at Castle Hill: on 13 May 1741 he told Watts that the congregation (or church attenders) totalled about 800, and the church members about 240, of whom about 180 had been admitted since he came; in December 1742 and December 1743 he reported a further increase in church membership, but in 1749 the congregation had fallen by 500 since 1741, partly through defection to the Moravians, though he was hopeful of new members. He was also active outside his own church, preaching for ministers in nearby towns and often taking part in ordinations. Early in 1741 he helped form an association of Northamptonshire ministers. Every summer he travelled to visit ministerial and other friends and former pupils, often to London, but also in different years to East Anglia and the south-west, and on these journeys he was much in demand as a preacher, however exhausted he found himself. At the beginning of 1744 he recorded having preached over 140 sermons the previous year, more than ever before. He continued to refuse invitations from prominent churches to be their minister, for example Princes Street, Westminster (Calamy's church), in 1733.<br>
<br>Doddridge's sermons (usually extempore) were often followed by his own hymns, based on specific biblical texts, which epitomized what the congregation had just heard. In his lectures on preaching (first published 1804) for his ministerial students in the academy he emphasized that the preacher should avoid topics such as the doctrines of natural religion and the evidences of Christianity, and concentrate on the covenant of grace, the operations of the Spirit, and the love of Christ. This emphasis is apparent in his published collections of sermons preached at Northampton, which include <span class="italic">Sermons on the Religious Education of Children</span> (1732), <span class="italic">Sermons to Young Persons</span> (1735), <span class="italic">Ten Sermons on the Power and Grace of Christ</span> (1736), and <span class="italic">Practical Discourses on Regeneration</span> (1741). He also published several separate sermons for ordinations, funerals, and public occasions.<br>
<br>Doddridge was brought up by Clark and Jennings to deplore the movement among orthodox dissenters to demand subscription to the doctrine of the Trinity, and he frequently spoke disparagingly in his letters of orthodoxy and bigotry. Clark was therefore surprised and disappointed when Doddridge denied his pulpit to the Arian James Foster in 1737: &#145;we cant be too careful not to give any Countenance to that narrow Spirit, which has done so much Mischief in the Christian Church&#146;  (Nuttall, <span class="italic">Calendar</span>, no. 480). Doddridge's usual spirit was anything but narrow; his ecumenical evangelicalism caused concern and embarrassment to many dissenters, including Watts and the trustees who administered William Coward's fund. In the late 1730s he took a keen interest in the activities of the Moravians, corresponding with James Hutton, though after meeting their leader, Count Zinzendorf, in 1741 he began to have doubts. He was welcoming to the Methodists: in July 1743 he preached at George Whitefield's London Tabernacle, and in October Whitefield reciprocated at Northampton; John Wesley visited him in September 1745, and at his request took his place in expounding scripture to his students; he dedicated <span class="italic">Christ's Invitation to Thirsty Souls</span> to James Hervey (1748), with a preface stressing that though they disagreed about conformity and nonconformity, they preached the same doctrine; and his sermon entitled <span class="italic">Christian Candour and Unanimity</span> (1750) was inscribed in adulatory terms to the countess of Huntingdon.<h2>
<a name="Marriageandfamily"></a>Marriage and family</h2>As a young minister Doddridge had for some time been looking for a wife. In the summer of 1730 he found her. She was Mercy [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/71065/', "Doddridge, Mercy (1709&#150;1790)")</script>], daughter of Richard Maris, a baker and maltster of Worcester, and his second wife, Elizabeth Brindley, who was then living at Upton upon Severn, the home of her mother's half-brother, Ebenezer Hankins, and his wife, Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Avenant. Doddridge met Mercy at the house of her great-aunt in Coventry in July 1730, and they were married at Upton on 22 December. Their income at first consisted of about &pound;120 p.a. (&pound;70 from the church, &pound;30 from the academy, and &pound;20 from the dissenting funds), but Doddridge had hopes of an income of &pound;56 p.a. from land in Hounslow and ground rent in London, which he inherited in 1743. A full and delightful picture of their married life emerges from the playful and passionate letters they exchanged when he was on his regular tours or she was away at Bath for her health (September 1742 to April 1743). They had nine children. The first, Elizabeth or Tetsey (1731&#150;1736), died just before her fifth birthday; Doddridge preached her funeral sermon under the title <span class="italic">Submission to Divine Providence</span> (1737), but he found such submission very hard, and rebuked himself in his diary for doting on her. Their four children who survived to adulthood were Mary or Polly (1733&#150;1799), who married John Humphreys of Tewkesbury; Mercy (1734&#150;1809); Philip (1735&#150;1785); and Anna Cecilia or Caelia (1737&#150;1811). Mercy Doddridge had several miscarriages and gave birth to four other children who died as infants: Samuel (1739&#150;1740), named after Clark; Sarah and Jane, twins who lived for two days (1746); and William (1748), who lived for six.<h2>
<a name="Academytutor"></a>Academy tutor</h2>In January 1730 Doddridge set up his academy in his house in Marefair, Northampton; in 1740, in order to accommodate increasing numbers, he moved it to a substantial house in Sheep Street, rented from the earl of Halifax. A great deal of information about the academy survives in various forms: letters about principles and organization and the problems of individual students, and diary entries about teaching preparation; his description of his teaching methods in &#145;Some account of the life and character of the Rev. Thomas Steffe&#146;, prefixed in 1742 to the <span class="italic">Sermons</span> of Steffe, a former student who died in 1740; &#145;Constitutions orders &amp; rules relating to the academy at Northampton&#146;, agreed between tutors and students in 1743  (Deacon, appx 9); the idealized portrait of the academy of Euphranor in <span class="italic">Dialogues Concerning Education</span> (1745&#150;8) by his friend David Fordyce, the Aberdeen moral philosopher; his posthumously published <span class="italic">Course of Lectures on the Principal Subjects in Pneumatology, Ethics, and Divinity</span> (1763) and <span class="italic">Lectures on Preaching</span> (1804); and the biographies of Orton and Kippis. Doddridge originally wanted to take students for the ministry only, but he was roundly rebuked for this in a letter of 9 December 1732 by his ministerial friend David Jennings, his former tutor's younger brother: &#145;The Support of our Interest comes from the Layity, and they will not be obliged to bring up all their sons ministers or Dunces&#146;  (Nuttall, <span class="italic">Calendar</span>, no. 382). In November 1733 he was prosecuted at the instigation of the chancellor of the diocese of Lincoln, George Reynolds, son of the bishop of Lincoln, Richard Reynolds, for teaching without an episcopal licence. He sought legal advice with the help of his Northampton patron Lord Halifax and prominent London dissenters, and was supported in his refusal to take out a licence by Sir Robert Walpole and the attorney-general. He told his wife on 31 January 1734, &#145;The Judges [in Westminster Hall] order'd a prohibition to be issued which secures me from all further Trouble&#146;  (Nuttall, <span class="italic">Calendar</span>, no. 400), and Reynolds failed in his attempt to challenge the prohibition in June. This case, of great importance for the cause of dissenting education, may have helped recruitment to the academy.<br>
<br>According to Orton, in his twenty-two years as tutor Doddridge educated over 200 students, of whom 120 became ministers  (Orton, <span class="italic">Memoirs</span>, 120). At a high point in July 1737 he had forty-four students; the numbers dropped in later years, but he was confident of their quality: he told the Connecticut minister Daniel Wadsworth in an important letter of 6 March 1741, &#145;I have at present a greater proportion of pious &amp; ingenious Youths under my care than I ever before had&#146;  (Nuttall, <span class="italic">Calendar</span>, no. 663). The students paid &pound;16 p.a. for board (&pound;14 if they were assisted by one of the dissenting funds), and &pound;4 for tuition; they also paid a guinea (&pound;1 1<i>s</i>.) for a closet (or small study), another for the library, and another towards the cost of the scientific apparatus, and they brought their own sheets and paid for their own candles and laundry.<br>
<br>As a tutor Doddridge owed the basic framework of his course to Jennings, but he considerably enlarged its content. Among his surviving books and manuscripts in Dr Williams's Library are his annotated copies of Jennings's text books, <span class="italic">Logica</span> (1721) and <span class="italic">Miscellanea</span> (1721), and Jennings's interleaved divinity lectures, &#145;THEOLOGIA&#146;. His own lectures were in continuous process of revision and expansion. He provided an invaluable summary for Wadsworth: &#145;Most of the Lectures I read are such as I myself draw up, specially in Algebra; Jewish Antiquities; Pneumatology, Ethicks, Divinity, &amp; the Manner of Preaching, &amp; the Pastoral care in its Several branches.&#146; He also lectured on texts such as Watts's <span class="italic">Logick</span>, Keill's <span class="italic">Anatomy</span>, Desaguliers's <span class="italic">Philosophy</span>, Buddeus's <span class="italic">Compendium historiae philosophicae</span>, and Lampe's <span class="italic">Ecclesiastical History</span>,<blockquote>besides Severall Miscellaneous Lectures on other Subjects the Number of which I shall be continually increasing. I have also every Morning an Exposition of a Chapter of the <span class="roman">Old Testament</span> and in the Evening in the <span class="roman">New</span> they are reading the Chapter from the Original. I also give them once a week critical notes on the <span class="roman">N: T</span> which they transcribe as they do my other MSS Lectures generally in short hand, which I teach them as soon as they come under my care. (Nuttall, <span class="italic">Calendar</span>, no. 663)</blockquote>The course lasted four years, with a fifth year for ministerial students. All students were required to have a reasonable standard of Latin and Greek on arrival, and they continued the study of classical literature for the first two years. They began Hebrew in the first year. Kippis queried Orton's statements that they were taught natural and civil history, civil law, mythology, and English history, but they were in agreement that the lectures on pneumatology, ethics, and divinity formed the most important part of the course (manuscript copies survive at Dr Williams's Library, Harris Manchester College, Oxford, and Doddridge and Commercial Street United Reformed Church, Northampton). The 230 lectures in ten parts begin with the faculties of the human mind, continue with natural religion (the being of God, the nature of moral virtue, and the immortality of the soul), then turn to the evidences for revelation, and conclude with Christian doctrine. Doddridge used an idiosyncratic structure derived from Jennings: &#145;axioms, definitions, propositions, lemmata, demonstrations, corollaries, and scholia, just in the method which mathematicians use&#146;  (&#145;Account of Steffe&#146;, <span class="italic">Works</span>, 4.253n.). Watts had criticized this aspect of Jennings's course when he read Doddridge's &#145;Account of Mr Jennings's Method&#146;, but Doddridge was certain of its value: &#145;It is with the humblest Deference to the vastly superior judgement of Dr Watts that I still think Mr Jennings's Method of Treating Logical &amp; Ethical subjects of all others the most proper for Academical Lectures&#146;  (DWL, MS 24.180.3).<br>
<br>In practice the lectures must have been much more exciting than they at first appear on paper. Doddridge's method clearly illustrated his principle of free enquiry: he assembled from various authors arguments for and against a particular position, discussed their merits, and indicated his own position; the students followed up the references in the library, and at the next lecture were questioned on their reading and conclusions. He introduced them to a very wide and heterogeneous group of philosophical and theological authors, ranging from dissenters and churchmen to deists and freethinkers. In his treatment of Christian doctrine, according to Kippis,<blockquote>though he stated and maintained his own opinions, which in a considerable degree were Calvinistical, he never assumed the character of a dogmatist. &hellip; The students were left to judge for themselves; and they did judge for themselves, with his perfect concurrence and approbation. (Kippis, 280)</blockquote>The remarkable library which made this wide reading possible contained several thousand volumes, many presented to the library by Doddridge's friends, some bought by him with the guinea of each new student, and inscribed &#145;In Usum Academiae&#146; with the date and the donor's name. They also had access to his own collection. Kippis warmly remembered Doddridge lecturing on the use of the library, going over the shelves in order and giving the character of each book and author. (About 200 of the academy books and about 500 of his own survive in Dr Williams's Library, brought together by G. F. Nuttall.)<br>
<br>Doddridge could not sustain unaided the burden of the academy and church, his writing, his correspondence, and his engagements outside Northampton, so he employed a succession of assistants from among his former students to help him with teaching: Orton, Thomas Brabant, James Robertson, and Samuel Clark, the son of his early mentor. Students who went on to make their mark as ministers, educators, or men of letters included, in addition to these, Risdon Darracott, Benjamin Fawcett, Fordyce, Kippis, John Aikin, and William Rose. The academy attracted not only English dissenters but Scottish Presbyterians, members of the Church of England (Steffe, the son of a clergyman, became a dissenting minister), and some students from the Netherlands.<br>
<br>Doddridge's status as one of the foremost educators in England was widely recognized: he received the degree of DD from Marischal College, Aberdeen, in 1736 with the support of Fordyce and Thomas Blackwell, and from King's College, Aberdeen, the following year; he was consulted in January 1744 by Richard Newton, principal of Hertford College, Oxford, who was grateful for his summary of his methods in the life of Steffe; he was asked by John Wesley for help with <span class="italic">A Christian Library</span>, and on 18 June 1746 he sent Wesley a long and important letter of suggestions (based on his <span class="italic">Lectures on Preaching</span>), characteristically emphasizing that &#145;a young minister should know the chief strength of error&#146;  (<span class="italic">Correspondence</span>, 4.484&#150;95).<h2>
<a name="Principalpublications"></a>Principal publications</h2>Doddridge's publishing career began in February 1728, when he was asked to review books for the <span class="italic">Present State of the Republick of Letters</span>; he offered to review Isaac Newton's <span class="italic">Chronology of Ancient Kingdoms Amended</span> and Francis Hutcheson's <span class="italic">Essay on the Nature and Conduct of the Passions and Affections</span>. A lengthy abstract of Newton appeared in the journal in April 1728 (pp. 253&#150;352). It is not possible to determine which reviews he wrote (they were all anonymous), but Kippis refers to &#145;papers&#146; in the plural  (Kippis, 292). In 1742&#150;3 he published <span class="italic">An Answer to a Late Pamphlet, Intitled, Christianity not Founded on Argument</span>, in the form of three letters to the anonymous author Henry Dodwell, a freethinker masquerading as a Methodist. Doddridge had long been interested in the attacks by freethinking writers on natural and revealed religion and in the importance of mounting a rational defence of Christianity. His copies of several freethinking works survive in Dr Williams's Library, notably Toland's <span class="italic">Letters to Serena</span> (1704) and <span class="italic">A Collection of Several Pieces</span> (2 vols., 1726, with a record of the names of students among whom these circulated in 1733&#150;5, including Aikin and Orton), Collins's <span class="italic">The Scheme of Literal Prophecy Considered</span> (1727), and Tindal's <span class="italic">Christianity as Old as the Creation</span> (1732, annotated in shorthand). He recommended in his <span class="italic">Answer</span> to Dodwell his own sermons on the evidences of Christianity (the last three of <span class="italic">Ten Sermons</span>, 1736), and pointed out that in several dissenting academies, &#145;to my certain knowledge, the rational evidences of natural and revealed religion, with such a view of the objections against both, are as regularly, and as methodically taught, as logic or geometry&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 1.490, 499). This material forms parts 5 and 6 of <span class="italic">A Course of Lectures</span>.<br>
<br>Doddridge's most influential publications in his lifetime were <span class="italic">The Rise and Progress of Religion in the Soul</span> (1745), <span class="italic">Some Remarkable Passages in the Life of the Honourable Col. James Gardiner</span> (1747), and <span class="italic">The Family Expositor</span> (1739&#150;56). The subtitle of <span class="italic">The Rise and Progress</span> indicates that it is &#145;a Course of Serious and Practical Addresses, suited to Persons of every Character and Circumstance: with a Devout Meditation or Prayer added to each Chapter&#146;. The dedication to Watts describes it as &#145;a book, which owes its existence to your request, its copiousness to your plan, and much of its perspicuity to your review&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 1.211). Watts had originally envisaged &#145;a small Book for the Poor, like Baxters <span class="italic">Call to the Unconverted</span>&#146;, and he did his best, after trying out the manuscript on his servants, to make Doddridge &#145;reduce the Language into easier Words and plainer Periods&#146;  (10 April 1744, Nuttall, <span class="italic">Calendar</span>, no. 963). Nevertheless Watts was certain of its usefulness: &#145;I am not ashamed, by what I have read, to recommend it as the best treatise on practical religion which is to be found in our language&#146;  (13 Sept 1744, <span class="italic">Correspondence</span>, 4.356&#150;7). Doddridge partly attributed Dr James Stonhouse's conversion to it. Both this work and the next were widely distributed and translated into Dutch, French, and German. The <span class="italic">Life of Gardiner</span>, an exemplary biography and conversion narrative of the close friend whom Doddridge regarded as a &#145;Christian hero&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 4.104), had the dual aim of persuading the doubting reader that Gardiner's experiences were not the product of enthusiasm and the devout reader that religious rapture must have a rational basis, and as a result it had a mixed reception from his friends. He was attacked in an anonymous <span class="italic">Letter to the Reverend Dr. Doddridge</span> (1747, possibly by William Wishart) for suggesting, after criticizing Gardiner's excessive doctrinal zeal, that ministers of the established churches of England and Scotland subscribed to formularies that they did not believe. Orton thought he did not reply because of the delicacy of the issue of subscription.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">The Family Expositor, or, A Paraphrase and Version of the New Testament</span>, the longest of Doddridge's works and the one to which he attached most importance, had its origin in his habit of expounding the <span class="roman">New Testament</span> in the evening to his students, though he had told Samuel Clark as early as 1724 that he was drawing up &#145;but only for my own use, a sort of analytical scheme of the contents of the epistles&#146;  (Nuttall, <span class="italic">Calendar</span>, no. 149). The <span class="italic">Expositor</span> was arranged in four parts: the Authorized Version in the margin; his own version, in italics, interwoven with his paraphrase; notes to the text; and the improvement (suggested prayer and meditation) at the end of each section (usually part of a chapter). The paraphrase and improvements unfortunately illustrate his reluctance to check his own fluency. He wrote the work in shorthand and then transcribed it for the press, the process taking much longer than he intended even though he worked on it daily. Volumes 1 to 3 (1739&#150;48) appeared in his lifetime; volumes 4 to 6 (1753&#150;6) were edited by Orton, who transcribed part of the sixth volume with help from some of Doddridge's students. According to a letter in the <span class="italic">Monthly Repository</span>, much of the introductory material in the fifth volume was written by Sir Philip Furneaux and others  (<span class="italic">Monthly Repository</span>, 13, 1818, 734&#150;5). In the preface to volume 1, dedicated to the princess of Wales, Doddridge explained that his aim was &#145;chiefly to promote <i>family religion</i>&#146; and that he wrote for those without a learned education who did not have access to commentators  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 6.9). The lengthy lists of subscribers prefacing volumes 1, 4, and 5, about 2800 in all, indicate a very wide readership, among members of the established church as well as dissenters, and among the aristocracy (many of them women) as well as academics and ministers. It had reached its eighth English edition by 1799.<br>
<br>Doddridge also edited the works of others and gave literary help to his friends. For example, he made an abstract of the second volume of Warburton's <span class="italic">Divine Legation</span> and corrected Whitefield's <span class="italic">Journals</span> and Fordyce's <span class="italic">Dialogues</span> at their authors' request, wrote a prefatory letter to Joseph Williams's <span class="italic">Abridgment of Mr. David Brainerd's Journal</span> (1748), edited Robert Leighton's <span class="italic">Expository Works</span> (1748), and as Watts's literary executor together with David Jennings edited Watts's posthumous <span class="italic">The Improvement of the Mind</span>, part 2 (1751) and his <span class="italic">Works</span> (6 vols., 1753).<h2>
<a name="Lastyearsandreputation"></a>Last years and reputation</h2>Until a few months before his death Doddridge continued to do all he could to further the cause of protestant dissent and evangelical Christianity at home and abroad. Anxious letters from his friends urged him to slow down; after his recovery from a serious illness in early 1745, his friend the London minister John Barker warned him, &#145;may not a Man be intemperate in Labour as well as in liquors?&#146;  (Nuttall, <span class="italic">Calendar</span>, no. 1048). His additional labours in Northampton included starting a charity school in 1738, founding the county infirmary together with Stonhouse in 1743&#150;4, and raising a volunteer force, together with Halifax, during the Jacobite rising of 1745. He was an active member of the Northampton Philosophical Society, founded in 1743, and supported inoculation against smallpox.<br>
<br>Outside Northampton, Doddridge became widely regarded as Watts's heir as the leading representative of the dissenting interest. Watts wrote a recommendation for him to David Longueville, minister of the English church at Amsterdam, as a preface to the Dutch translation (1746) of <span class="italic">Practical Discourses on Regeneration</span>, in which he stated: &#145;if there were any Man, to whom Providence would permit me to commit a second Part of my Life and Usefulness in the Church of <i>Christ</i>, Dr. <i>Doddridge</i> should be the Man&#146;  (Orton, <span class="italic">Memoirs</span>, 150). Doddridge had friendly meetings with the archbishop of Canterbury, Thomas Herring, in the summers of 1748, 1749, and 1751, at the first of which he discussed the possibility of comprehending dissenters in the Church of England. In the spring of 1751 he intervened unsuccessfully with the bishop of London, Thomas Sherlock, over the case of the harassment of the Presbyterian minister Samuel Davies in Virginia. He took a keen interest in the development of New Jersey College, later Princeton, evident in letters to him from the president, Aaron Burr, from 1748 to 1750. In a sermon preached at a meeting of ministers in Kettering in 1741, <span class="italic">The Evil and Danger of Neglecting the Souls of Men</span>, he had asked &#145;Whether something might not be done, in most of our congregations, towards assisting in the propagation of christianity abroad, and spreading it in some of the darker parts of our own land?&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 2.232), and in April 1751 he was still trying to promote missionary activity among the American Indians. Unsurprisingly, his correspondence became increasingly demanding, and though he sometimes coped by dictating his letters to his students, Kippis among them, he had to leave many unanswered.<br>
<br>From August 1750 Doddridge suffered from a violent cough, which became worse when he went to St Albans to preach Clark's funeral sermon in December, and badly affected him on his annual travels in June 1751. In July he set out with his wife from Northampton for the last time, leaving the younger Clark in charge of the congregation and academy, and staying for a month with Orton in Shrewsbury. In August it became apparent that he was dying. His doctors sent him to the Hot Wells at Bristol, and then advised that if he were to have any chance of survival he should go to Lisbon for the winter. His many friends, including the countess of Huntingdon, his congregation, and the Coward trustees, raised &pound;300 for the fruitless journey. The Doddridges sailed from Falmouth on 30 September, reaching Lisbon on 13 October; he died just outside the city on 26 October, aged forty-nine. When his body was opened his lungs were found to be heavily ulcerated. He was buried in the cemetery of the British Factory. A monument with an inscription by Gilbert West was erected in Castle Hill church, but with an error in his age at death.<br>
<br>According to Kippis Doddridge was tall and thin, though his portraits show him plump-faced; in character he was sociable, open, and affectionate. He had an extraordinary capacity for work and for dividing his time between his ministerial, educational, and literary activities&#151;as can be seen from the detailed &#145;schemes of business&#146;, meditations, and reflections recorded in his diaries from 1729 to 1751  (<span class="italic">Correspondence</span>, vol. 5). Kippis, who admired him greatly and inscribed his biography &#145;to the memory of my benefactor, my tutor, my friend, and my father&#146;, thought him ostentatious in describing his many commitments and too fond of applause  (Kippis, 308). Doddridge was vain of his standing in the intellectual and social worlds, seen in his haughty reaction when the University of Glasgow would not award Clark the degree of DD on his testimony alone. More significant was the charge that he was a trimmer, made by those who were unsympathetic to his lifelong attempt as a moderate Baxterian Calvinist and opponent of subscription to steer between the extremes of old Calvinist orthodoxy and new rational dissent. Both Orton and Kippis strongly defended him against the charge. According to Orton: &#145;He used to take Comfort in this, that he was no worse treated, than those four excellent <i>Divines</i>, whose Writings, above all others, he admired, the Arch-bishops <i>Leighton</i> and <i>Tillotson</i>, Mr. <i>Baxter</i> and Dr. <i>Watts</i>&#146;  (Orton, <span class="italic">Memoirs</span>, 257). Kippis acutely pointed out that the rational dissenters &#145;could not easily persuade themselves that a man of such abilities, and general liberality of mind, could entertain very different opinions from their own; and they wished to have him rank more explicitly among them&#146;  (Kippis, 307).<br>
<br>In his will Doddridge left his manuscripts to Orton, and his library (except for 100 books) to the Coward trustees in perpetuity for the use of the academy; he hoped that Caleb Ashworth, minister at Daventry, would take on the academy (in place of his original choice of Orton, who had left to become minister at Shrewsbury). His most important posthumous publications, in addition to volumes 4 to 6 of <span class="italic">The Family Expositor</span>, were his <span class="italic">Hymns</span>, his <span class="italic">Course of Lectures</span>, and his <span class="italic">Lectures on Preaching</span>. He had awkwardly drawn attention to his unpublished hymns by describing Gardiner's delight in them  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 4.68, 92&#150;4). Orton edited <span class="italic">Hymns Founded on Various Texts in the Holy Scriptures</span> (1755, corrected 1776); a few have long been popular, notably &#145;O God of Jacob&#146;, &#145;O happy day&#146;, &#145;Hark the glad sound!&#146;, and &#145;Ye servants of the Lord&#146; (nos. 4, 23, 203, 210). There were several editions of <span class="italic">A Course of Lectures</span>: by Clark (1763; repr. 1776), Kippis (1794; repr. 1799), and Edward Williams in volumes 4 and 5 (1803&#150;4) of his and Edward Parsons's edition of the <span class="italic">Works</span>; the editions of Kippis and Williams have a large number of updated references. The lectures, used as textbooks in several academies, were described by Williams as &#145;the most complete syllabus of controversial theology, in the largest sense of the term, ever published in the English language&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 4.282). The <span class="italic">Lectures on Preaching</span>, to which Doddridge attached great importance, were published in volume 5 of the <span class="italic">Works</span> following the divinity lectures (as he had requested in his will) and separately in 1821. In addition to the <span class="italic">Works</span> (10 vols., 1802&#150;5), the most important addition to the corpus was <span class="italic">The Correspondence and Diary</span> edited by his descendant John Doddridge Humphreys (5 vols., 1829&#150;31), though Humphreys was a very cavalier editor, even by nineteenth-century standards. His scholarly fortunes have been transformed following the bicentenary of his death in 1951 thanks to the important work of G. F. Nuttall.<br>
