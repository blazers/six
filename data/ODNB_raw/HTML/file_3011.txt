<span class="headword">Bourne,  William</span>  (<em>c.</em>1535&#150;1582), <span class="occ">writer on mathematics</span>, was born at Gravesend, the son of John Bourne (<i>d</i>. 1560), who owned property in the town. His exact date of birth is not known. He was appointed a jurat, or town councillor, of Gravesend under the charter of incorporation in 1562 and in 1571&#150;2 served as port-reeve, the equivalent of mayor. In 1573 he made a will, from which it is evident that he had at that time four young sons. He had married Dorothy Beare, a widow with three sons of her own. As well as the four sons mentioned in the will, William and Dorothy Bourne also had a daughter, who was only a child when her mother died in December 1582, also leaving a will.<br>
<br>From both wills it is clear that Bourne and his wife owned considerable property in Gravesend, and lived prosperously. Bourne himself refers to &#145;the profittes of my houses and Tenements&#146;  (Bourne, appx) as sufficient for his wife to bring up the children and give them a good education. He had also inherited from his father a &#145;tyde&#146;, which brought in an income from the service of barges, known as tide barges, plying between the city of London and Gravesend. A residents' list for Gravesend of 1572 records him as serving again as a jurat, and states that he had paid for freedom of the Mercers' Company. A document in his own handwriting (15 March 1571) includes the name of Mr Bourne, port-reeve, as one of fourteen persons fined for selling beer in short measure. One account of his life regards this as conclusive evidence that he was an innkeeper, but it is more likely that the offence was committed by a tenant or employee for whom he was responsible in law.<br>
<br>An active and important citizen of a thriving Thames port, in middle life Bourne set about satisfying a demand for practical textbooks on navigation and gunnery. He was not a university-educated man, unlike other authors dealing with mathematical topics at this time, but he had, from boyhood, everyday contact with seamen, and had practised gunnery as a citizen volunteer with the garrison manning the defensive bulwark at Gravesend. His knowledge of mathematics, of which there is considerable evidence in his writing, must have been acquired through reading and determined study, and was sufficient for him to become a mathematical practitioner, dealing with almanac making, surveying, navigation, and gunnery. According to E. G. R. Taylor, he is &#145;the earliest unlearned English instructor and writer on mathematical practice known to us&#146;  (Taylor, <span class="italic">Mathematical Practitioners</span>, 176).<br>
<br>Bourne's first book was an <span class="italic">Almanacke and Prognostication for iii Yeres</span>, printed in 1567, of which a second, updated version appeared in 1571. The almanac customarily contained astrological material, and there was a tradition, particularly on the continent, of including prognostications, often dramatic and alarming. Bourne thought such prophecies &#145;most vain and foolish&#146;, and in his typically practical way included in his almanac a pocket sea-manual, described as &#145;serten rules of navigation&#146;. One can deduce that the navigational content of the almanac was well received, for probably in 1574 he published <span class="italic">A Regiment for the Sea</span> (the first edition was not dated but contains a kalendar for 1574). This was his most extensive and important work. A second edition appeared in 1580, and the book went through five further editions after Bourne's death, the last in 1643; it was also translated into Dutch.<br>
<br>The <span class="italic">Regiment</span> was not, and did not pretend to be, an original work. Bourne's immediate inspiration came from the English translation, published under the title <span class="italic">Arte of Navigation</span> by Richard Eden in 1561, of Martin Cortes' <span class="italic">Arte de navigar</span>. Bourne was critical of some aspects of the Spaniard's book, and considered that he could produce a manual of more use to the practical seaman, as indeed proved to be the case. Among much advice to the seaman he describes in detail how to make observations of the sun and stars, using the cross-staff, how to measure the ship's way by log and line, and how to plot coastal features from the ship by taking bearings, using the method of triangulation.<br>
<br>The year 1578 saw the publication of three books by Bourne. One, the <span class="italic">Treasure for Traveilers</span>, dealt with the practicalities of making measurements, both at sea and on land, including in the latter case methods of surveying. The second, <span class="italic">The Arte of Shooting in Great Ordnance</span>, drew on his own experience as a gunner. The last, <span class="italic">Inventions, or, Devises</span>, was the first version in English of a type of book made popular on the continent by authors such as Nicholas Tartaglia and Jacques Besson. In it are described novel devices, such as a geared ship's log, and suggestions for military and naval strategies. For what proved to be his last book, Bourne returned to the almanac form with which he had begun writing, and published in 1580 a ten-year almanac and prognostication. Among Bourne's patrons and dedicatees were: Edward Clinton, earl of Lincoln, lord high admiral; Sir William Winter, master of the queen's ordnance, under whom Bourne had learned his gunnery skills; and Ambrose Dudley, earl of Warwick, general of the ordnance.<br>
<br>Another notable public figure with whom Bourne had dealings was William Cecil, first Baron Burghley. A manuscript pamphlet by Bourne, &#145;The property or qualytyes of glaces&#146; (written <i>c</i>.1572 and addressed to Lord Burghley at Burghley's request), is an assessment of the claims for the discoveries of the effects of perspective glasses made by Leonard Digges, which were published after Digges's death by his son, Thomas, in <span class="italic">Pantometria</span> (1571). Bourne claims that Burghley made this request because he had, seven years earlier, received from Bourne a paper on buoyancy in water, as affecting the draught of ships. The pamphlet shows that Bourne had some practical knowledge of concave and convex mirrors and their effects, but he disclaims any first-hand experimental information on the crucial aspect of Digges's claim, namely, that a combination of concave mirror and convex lens would produce a telescopic effect. The manuscript was published in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries and used as an argument for the existence of an Elizabethan telescope. However there was neither the conceptual framework nor the technical capability to make such an instrument during this period.<br>
<br>Bourne was a popular author in the very practical sense that he explained technical matters in a comprehensible way for the &#145;unlettered&#146; man. He owed his success in part to the fact that he lived at the time when the oceans were being opened up to exploration, and the ever-present threat of war with Spain ensured keen interest in all matters military and naval. He died in Gravesend and was buried there on 22 March 1582.<br>
