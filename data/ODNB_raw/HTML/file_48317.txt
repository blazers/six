<span class="headword">Maudeleyn,  Richard</span>  (1371/2&#150;1400), <span class="occ">royal councillor</span>, was born in London, the son of John Maudeleyn, serjeant-yeoman of the king's robes, and his wife, Alice, and the brother of Agnes, wife of Robert Sewall. Between 1386 and 1391 he was a royal scholar at King's Hall, Cambridge; when granted a dispensation to be ordained a priest in 1392, he was aged twenty. He enjoyed the favour of Richard II during the later years of the reign, receiving numerous benefices, including canonries at Lincoln in 1393, at St Stephen's Chapel, Westminster, in 1396, and at York in 1397. In April 1398 he became archdeacon of Lincoln. The king demonstrated great trust in his &#145;Master Richard&#146;: in October 1397 he brought the duke of Gloucester's corpse from Calais to London, and in 1398 was sent to Ireland to prepare the royal chambers in Dublin Castle for the king's arrival. Maudeleyn was also made an executor of the king's will. He accompanied Richard to Ireland in 1394, and again in 1399, returning with him to Wales upon news of Henry Bolingbroke's arrival. At Conwy, where the royal party was cornered by the earl of Northumberland, Walsingham states that the king offered to abdicate on condition that his life and the lives of eight of his counsellors, including Maudeleyn, were spared; the more reliable Creton says that Maudeleyn was one of five royal counsellors whom Bolingbroke intended to try for Gloucester's death.<br>
<br>Together with the captive king Maudeleyn was taken to London, where in October 1399 Bolingbroke, now Henry IV, presented to the knights of parliament a &#145;certain scroll &hellip; containing magic arts&#146; found in Maudeleyn's possession; summoned before convocation the next day to explain it, he confessed that it had been given to him by Richard II, but denied any knowledge of its meaning, and was released  (<span class="italic">Johannis de Trokelowe</span>, 301). With Richard II imprisoned in Pontefract Castle, Maudeleyn now joined a plot to kill Henry and restore Richard to the throne. He was said to resemble the deposed king greatly, and was employed to impersonate him during the early stages of the revolt, but things went badly wrong, and Maudeleyn's chief accomplices were killed at Cirencester or Oxford in early January 1400. Maudeleyn and William Ferriby, another royal clerk, were captured in Yorkshire&#151;apparently they were fleeing to Scotland&#151;and brought to London at the end of January. They were drawn, hanged, and beheaded; Maudeleyn allegedly thanked God that he died in the service of his &#145;sovereign lord, the noble King Richard&#146;  (Creton, 134&#150;5). Two months later, when Richard II's corpse was brought to London for burial, Creton (who was not there, but believed that the former king was still alive) thought it must have been the body of &#145;Maudeleyn, his chaplain, whose face, size, height and build were so exactly similar to the king's that everyone firmly believed that it was good King Richard&#146;  (Creton, 221). Creton was almost certainly wrong. Later suggestions that Maudeleyn might have been an illegitimate child of Richard II are equally implausible, given his likely date of birth.<br>
