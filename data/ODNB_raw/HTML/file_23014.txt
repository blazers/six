<span class="headword">Raikes,  Henry</span>  (1782&#150;1854), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, was born in Broad Street, City of London, on 24 September 1782, the second son of Thomas Raikes (1741&#150;1813), a merchant, who was governor of the Bank of England in 1797. His mother was Charlotte (<i>d</i>. 1810), daughter of the Hon. Henry Finch. The Raikes family was prominent in commercial, social, and evangelical circles. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/23017/', "Thomas Raikes")</script>, the dandy and diarist, was Henry's brother and Robert Raikes, the founder of the Sunday school movement, his uncle.<br>
<br>Educated at Eton College (1793&#150;1800), Raikes entered St John's College, Cambridge, in 1800 and graduated BA in 1804; he proceeded MA in 1807. He spent most of 1805 travelling abroad. After visiting Austria and Hungary he sailed to Greece, where he met George Hamilton Gordon, fourth earl of Aberdeen, his fellow student at Cambridge, and spent the winter in exploring with him the sites of the temples and cities of Boeotia and the interior of the Peloponnese. The following year he accompanied the Mediterranean squadron for some months, as the guest of Lord Collingwood, on its cruise off the coasts of Sicily and Africa.<br>
<br>In 1807 Raikes was ordained deacon and in 1808 priest, becoming curate of Betchworth in Surrey. He was subsequently curate of Shillingstone, Dorset, Burnham, Buckinghamshire, and of Bognor, Sussex. On 16 March 1809 he married Augusta (<i>d</i>. 1820), eldest daughter of Jacob J. Whittington of Theberton Hall and Yoxford, Suffolk. They had one daughter and three sons, the eldest of whom, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/45558/', "Henry Raikes")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/23015/', "Raikes, Henry Cecil")</script>], was the father of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/23015/', "Henry Cecil Raikes")</script>. In 1828 Raikes became examining chaplain to his early friend John Bird Sumner, bishop of Chester, and in 1830 chancellor of the diocese of Chester. His influence rapidly grew, and he became well known in the city and diocese as a preacher, a public speaker on religious occasions, and an active philanthropist. A leading evangelical, he was prominent in the activities of the Church Missionary Society. On 8 August 1844 he was named an honorary canon of the cathedral.<br>
<br>In Chester, Raikes encouraged a lively interest in the city's historical remains and in the restoration of the cathedral. He was a president of the Architectural, Archaeological, and Historic Society of Chester, which he helped to found in 1849, and contributed many papers to its journal. He was also appointed historian to the society.<br>
<br>Raikes's most important published work was <span class="italic">Remarks on Clerical Education</span> (1831), which encouraged the universities to improve the theological examinations and the bishops to require a theological degree as a prelude to holy orders. His other works were mostly collected sermons. He was a member of the commission for the subdivision of parishes in 1849, a measure of church reform that he had long advocated.<br>
<br>Raikes died at his seat, Dee Side House, Chester, on 28 November 1854, and was buried in Chester cemetery on 5 December.<br>
