<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Hinton,  Paula Doris</span>  (1924&#150;1996), <span class="occ">ballet dancer</span>, was born at 132 Cranbrook Road, Ilford, Essex, on 1 June 1924, the elder child of (Alfred) Ernest Hinton (1895&#150;1962) and his wife, Doris Clara Miriam, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Hurley (<i>d</i>. 1972). They were travelling players, appearing in operas and other entertainments, so their daughters' early lives were peripatetic. The family settled in Liverpool; Paula Hinton was already in her mid-teens when, acting in a pantomime and liking the ballets in it, she decided she wanted to become a dancer. After studying locally, she made her ballet d&eacute;but in 1943 as Helen of Troy in an Old Vic <span class="italic">Dr Faustus</span> at the Playhouse, Liverpool. Her late start did not prevent her from being accepted into Ballet Rambert the next year. Small roles came quickly, some in the classics calling for a neat technique, others for a sense of humour in ballets by Frederick Ashton, Frank Staff, and Antony Tudor. There was no one Hinton &#145;look&#146; on stage; she soon learned to transform herself with each role. Her lively qualities were noted by the resident choreographer, <a href="#cosubject_76614">Walter Gore [<i>see below</i>]</a>, and one of her first leading parts was in his ballet <span class="italic">Plaisance</span>.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_76614"></a><span class="headword">Walter Gore</span> <span class="st"> [<em>real name </em>Frederick Robert Taylor]</span>  (1910&#150;1979), <span class="occ">dancer, choreographer, and ballet director</span>, was born on 8 October 1910 at Waterside, Ayrshire, to John William Taylor and his wife, Margaret Anne, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Snape; both parents were actors. Gore went to London in 1924 to study drama at the Italia Conti School of Drama and Dance; he appeared in plays, and a revue by C. B. Cochran starring the dancer Leonide Massine, whose example inspired Gore to take up ballet. He studied with Marie Rambert and appeared with her company from its first season in 1930, also taking roles with the Vic-Wells Ballet, most intensively during 1934&#150;5 when he partnered Ninette de Valois in <span class="italic">Copp&eacute;lia</span> and created the title role in <span class="italic">The Rake's Progress</span>. A flair for characterization, through both movement and his expressively lively, sharply angled face, quickly marked him out to create roles for Ashton (in <span class="italic">Fa&ccedil;ade</span>, <span class="italic">Les masques</span>, etc.), de Valois (<span class="italic">Job</span>), and Tudor (<span class="italic">Dark Elegies</span>). In such parts he was unequalled, but he succeeded also in the virtuoso display of <span class="italic">Bluebird</span>, or even in romanticism as Albrecht in <span class="italic">Giselle</span>, thanks to his intensity and sense of style. During the mid-1930s he took time off to appear in musicals, where he also did his first choreography, besides meeting the dancer Aase Lavendt Nissen (<i>b</i>. 1915/16), whom he married on 16 September 1938. That year also saw his first ballet for Rambert, <span class="italic">Valse finale</span> to music by Ravel, soon followed by further pieces among which the short, tense <span class="italic">Confessional</span> (based on a poem by Browning) in 1940 was the most notable and durable. This revealed Gore's flair for dance drama and also that of its soloist, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/93754/', "Sally Gilmour (1921&#150;2004)")</script>, who became the choreographer's off-stage partner (his wife had returned to her native Scandinavia). During the Second World War Gore was called up into the navy (1942&#150;4) but was discharged on medical grounds after being twice torpedoed. On returning to dance he had a particular success with <span class="italic">Simple Symphony</span>, a lively interpretation of Britten's youthful music, and with the comic <span class="italic">Mr Punch</span>. Ballet Rambert's long Australian tour in 1947&#150;9 brought a change in his private life. This was mirrored in a new ballet, <span class="italic">Winter Night</span>, where he played a man torn between his old and new loves, Gilmour and Paula Hinton. From then on, Hinton and Gore worked as a team; they married on 9 January 1950 following the dissolution of his first marriage. They shared a serious sense of purpose, enthusiasm for hard work, and a flair for theatrical effect.<br>
<br>Gore's <span class="italic">Antonia</span> in 1949, showing an irresistibly fascinating slut murdered by her lover, was an emphatic manifesto of Hinton's and his dramatic force. Then in 1950 Gore and Hinton left Rambert, and Hinton made guest appearances with the Original Ballet Russe, giving a glittering account of the title role in <span class="italic">Le coq d'or</span>, with Festival Ballet (she was outstanding as Giselle among other roles), and with Les Ballets des Champs-Elys&eacute;es in Paris, where Gore created <span class="italic">La damn&eacute;e</span> showing her burnt as a witch. Thereafter the couple spent much time abroad, he becoming director and she leading dancer with companies in Germany, Norway, and Portugal. They formed companies of their own, too, in Australia and twice in Britain: the Walter Gore Ballet (1953&#150;5) and the London Ballet (1961&#150;3). A stubborn refusal to compromise on artistic standards and perhaps a certain impracticality in business matters precluded more permanent operations. But they also worked with many small companies in Britain and Europe, where Gore created ballets, most of them starring Hinton. Through all these peregrinations Hinton, believing that communication with the audience was more important than the occasion, never gave less than her absolute best, whether in heavy drama or light comedy. Even when in 1965, to help Western Theatre Ballet out of an emergency caused by injuries, she learned one of its major roles in Peter Darrell's <span class="italic">The Prisoners</span> at only a few days' notice, she danced it as convincingly as it had ever been done.<br>
<br>The couple's range was demonstrated in 1958 when within twelve months Gore made three contrasting dramas for Hinton: in <span class="italic">Eaters of Darkness</span> as a woman wrongly confined to an asylum who goes mad in consequence; in <span class="italic">The Magical Being</span>, where she played a creature like the fierce firebirds of Russian tradition; and in a powerful though reticent duet about jealousy, <span class="italic">Night and Silence</span>. But they enjoyed equal success in ballets with a comic touch, such as <span class="italic">Peepshow</span> or <span class="italic">Light Fantastic</span>, with no story but a lively and individual animation. Unfortunately, their constant travels prevented their great talents from being as fully recognized as they deserved.<br>
<br>Gore died on 15 April 1979 in Pamplona, Spain, where he and Hinton were working for a time. Hinton subsequently attempted to arrange revivals of his ballets, but with limited success because continuing links with established companies were lacking. She retired to Birkenhead, where she died in Arrowe Park Hospital on 5 November 1996 and was cremated. Hinton and Gore had no children.<br>
