<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Lambert,  Percy Edgar</span>  (1880&#150;1913), <span class="occ">motor racing driver and car dealer</span>, was born at 9 Pimlico Road, Pimlico, London, on 5 October 1880, the third son in the family of at least three sons and three daughters of Charles Lambert (1841/2&#150;1888), a master builder and later house furnisher and picture frame maker, and his wife, Sarah, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Chappell (1837/8&#150;1923), who continued to run the house furnishing business after her husband's death. After schooling he followed his older brother Harold Charles Lambert (1877&#150;1937) into the motor trade, selling Austin and Singer marques from premises in Westminster.<br>
<br>Lambert became an enthusiast for motor racing and drove a range of vehicles which included Austin, Singer, Talbot, and Vauxhall models. He first raced at Brooklands in 1910, the purpose-built racing circuit near Weybridge, Surrey, which had been opened three years earlier. High speed testing and racing of cars could be undertaken there without falling foul of the law of 1903 which restricted cars to a speed of 20 m.p.h. on public roads.<br>
<br>Known in racing circles by his nickname of Pearley, Lambert drove Austins of that name. During the 1911 Brooklands season, while driving his Austin Pearley III, he continually raised the speed limit, starting with a best lap of 77 m.p.h., raising that to 82 m.p.h. in July. By the end of 1911 he had achieved a top lap speed of 91 m.p.h. During 1911 he also secured twenty-one prizes for his efforts and achieved recognition for being a driver who combined daring with fine judgement and skill.<br>
<br>During 1912 Lambert rose to further prominence by winning the class E and 21 hp records for ten laps from a standing start at a speed of 92.3 m.p.h. At the end of June he drove a works Vauxhall C12 in the grand prix de l'automobile de France in Dieppe, but he was forced to retire after completing eighteen laps. Later in November 1912, driving Lord Shrewsbury's single-seater Talbot in the single-seater half mile, kilometre, and mile, he achieved speeds of up to 113 m.p.h.<br>
<br>By the end of 1912 the Talbot company reckoned that it would be possible to establish the record of covering 100 miles in one hour. On 8 February 1913, in a 25 hp Talbot, Lambert made a first attempt to do so but failed when a tyre burst as he was within three miles of his target. At Brooklands a week later, on 15 February 1913, in a 4.5 litre side-valve Talbot, he covered 103 miles and 1470 yards in sixty minutes, and became the first driver to achieve the feat of driving 100 miles in an hour. Carefully organized by the Talbot company, and recorded on cinematograph film, Lambert's drive proved that power was not the only factor in high speed, and that a car of moderate weight with a medium-sized engine, capable of high crank-shaft speed, was best suited to the purpose. He also demonstrated the importance of vehicle reliability, and especially the durability of tyres at speeds over 90 m.p.h.<br>
<br>In April 1913 Lambert's record was broken by another driver, Jules Goux, whose Peugeot covered 106.22 miles in an hour at Brooklands, and this in turn was bettered by Jean Chassange in a Sunbeam in mid-October 1913. On 31 October 1913 Lambert tried to regain his position, using the same car as previously with minor modifications in design. He began driving in poor weather with a mist hanging over the Brooklands track, leading to poor visibility as water formed on his goggles. When he had been driving for about twenty-eight minutes at an average speed calculated at 114 m.p.h. and just after he had passed the members' enclosure at 110 m.p.h., the rear off-tyre burst. The car overturned on an embankment, throwing Lambert out. He was found to be unconscious, suffering from a fractured skull, and died before reaching Weybridge Cottage Hospital. It was widely reported that he had promised his fianc&eacute;e that it would be his last attempt at a world record. A coroner's jury returned a verdict of accidental death and after a funeral at St Peter's, Eaton Square, he was buried at Brompton cemetery, London.<br>
<br>Lambert was a popular figure in racing circles, known for his personal modesty. He emphasized the importance of physical fitness for fast driving and trained for his record attempts. He was a total abstainer from alcohol, and rarely smoked. Although he was not an amateur, as he drove for the Talbot firm, it was said that he possessed sufficient private means from his business interests not to need to attempt records for a living, but instead did so for the pleasure of handling fast cars. Nor was he seeking to produce a spectacle for crowds, and only small numbers of spectators were present to witness his attempts on the one hour record. Shortly before his death he and his brother entered vehicle manufacturing and jointly formed the Lambert Light Car Company.<br>
