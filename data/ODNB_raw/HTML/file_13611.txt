</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Holt, Sir  John</span>  (1642&#150;1710), <span class="occ">judge</span>, was born at Thame, Oxfordshire, on 30 December 1642, the first son of Sir Thomas Holt and of Susan, daughter of John Peacock of Chawley, Berkshire. Holt's father, a barrister of Gray's Inn, was recorder of Abingdon as well as its member of parliament during the 1650s. The younger Holt attended the free school in Abingdon. He was admitted to his father's inn in November 1652 when he was not yet ten years old. On 31 July 1658 he matriculated from Oriel College, Oxford, where he took no degree. Though reportedly a dissolute youth, he was called to the bar in February 1664.<h2>
<a name="Holtasbarrister16641688"></a>Holt as barrister, 1664&#150;1688</h2>By late 1664 Holt had begun to plead in king's bench, the court where he made his greatest mark, and by 1668 he had begun to earn mention in the law reports. On 28 June 1675 he married Ann (<i>c</i>.1657&#150;1712), daughter of Sir John Cropley. From the late 1670s Holt's prominence in his profession was underscored by his regular appearance as counsel in suits before the House of Lords.<br>
<br>Unlike many leaders at the bar in the late 1670s and 1680s, Holt defies easy labelling as a whig or tory. He represented clients such as the Norwich alderman who lost his office after allegations that he had not observed the terms of the <span class="roman">Corporation Act</span> and the Ipswich justices of the peace who would not support collecting fines from dissenters, suggesting Holt's sympathy for nonconformity. But he also provided advice to the leaders of Leicester who wanted to understand better the actions they could take to enforce the conventicle acts. He provided counsel in 1679 to the king's adviser, the earl of Danby, and in 1683 to the accused traitor Lord Russell. Holt performed a supporting role in crown prosecutions, appearing in trials for seditious libel in 1680 and against Slingsby Bethel in 1681 for his alleged assault at Southwark's parliamentary election. On the other hand, Holt represented the whig leader Lord Grey of Warke during his trial for debauching his sister-in-law, Lady Henrietta Berkeley. Holt also joined prominent whig lawyers Francis Pollexfen, William Williams, and Sir Francis Winnington in their unsuccessful defence of Thomas Pilkington, Samuel Shute, Lord Grey, and others for their riot at the election of London's sheriffs in 1682.<br>
<br>While Holt supported these whigs in court in the 1680s, he just as consistently promoted royal authority in the crown's legal battles with the urban corporations. He did not appear in the <i>quo warranto</i> trial against London's corporation, but was among those consulted by the City about how it should respond after judgment came down against it in June 1683. Though Holt advised surrender, the City followed other counsel and ultimately forfeited its charter. Holt likewise advised Berwick to surrender its charter after the town initially decided to fight a <i>quo warranto</i>. In both instances Holt premised his advice on the idea that all franchises&#151;including corporations&#151;derive from the king and would thus survive in royal hands if seized after judgment or upon surrender. The same view of regal power over franchises appeared in Holt's arguments in the East India Company case, in which he found Pollexfen, Williams, and Sir George Treby arrayed against him. In a learned argument, drawn not only from statute and law reports but from scripture, Grotius, John Selden, and other treatise authors, Holt justified the company's privileges by justifying the king's power to grant them a monopoly by royal charter: &#145;by the law of the land, no subject of England can trade with infidels without license from the king&#146;  (<span class="italic">State trials</span>, 10.373).<br>
<br>Holt was made serjeant-at-law in February 1684, at which time he was again advising Danby in his effort to win release from the Tower. Though he aided the former royal minister and had just received the crown's favour, in the same period Holt joined Pollexfen to defend William Sacheverell and other alleged whig rioters from Nottingham, without success. In February 1686 James II knighted Holt and made him recorder of London, the City's charter being still in abeyance and its officers acting by the king's nomination. He was promoted to king's serjeant in April. Holt's reported reluctance to accept the recorder's place only grew when he sat in the Old Bailey in the trial of a soldier accused of desertion. Of nine judges hearing the matter, Holt alone contended that the soldier could not be executed when the kingdom was not at war. Later, in his absence, judgment was given and the soldier was indeed executed. Holt asked to be dismissed from the recordership and in May 1687 the king obliged.<br>
<br>Holt remained a king's serjeant and thus refused to appear as counsel in court against the king throughout 1687 and 1688. But he continued active before the bench, right through the autumn of 1688. In October he was among those convened to investigate whether the prince of Wales, born the previous June, was indeed the queen's child. After James II fled in December Holt was one of the legal counsel consulted by London's leaders and later by the provisional government about how to summon a parliament in the king's absence.<br>
<br>When the convention met in January 1689 the House of Lords asked Holt to serve as one of its legal advisers. Hinting that government was by contract, not <i>jure divino</i>, he was among those who suggested that James II had abdicated because his departure was a violation&#151;and thus a renunciation&#151;of his trust as king. On 31 January Bere Alston returned Holt to the Commons, where he spoke often, served on two dozen committees, and helped to manage the conference with the Lords about the crown&#151;in which he promoted William of Orange's claim to the throne independent of any right by his wife, Mary. During the November debate on the <span class="roman">Bill of Rights</span> Holt also argued that the king possessed the authority to grant <i>non obstantes</i>&#151;a dispensing power&#151;though he added that this power did not permit making exceptions to the <span class="roman">Test Act</span>. Holt also supported the new monarch's right to collect revenues granted by parliament to the previous king. In short, while he accepted that a king like James might forfeit the throne by breaking his trust, Holt continued to accord the monarch significant authority as a matter of law.<h2>
<a name="Holtasjurist16891710"></a>Holt as jurist, 1689&#150;1710</h2>Holt's brief Commons career was ended by his appointment as chief justice of king's bench on 17 April 1689. As a jurist Holt exercised greater sway over the law than any judge between Hale and Mansfield. Unlike Hale, he extended this influence exclusively through his reported opinions rather than by authoring legal treatises, which perhaps explains Holt's concern about the accuracy of most reports. In criminal law Holt was notable for the attention he gave to how evidence was presented before him, though perhaps William Holdsworth's pronouncement that Holt &#145;established the modern attitude of the judge to the criminal&#146;  (Holdsworth, <span class="italic">Eng. law</span>, 6.518) overstates the matter. Holt's summation of the case against Richard Hathaway at Surrey assizes for giving false evidence of witchcraft shows his scepticism of those who sought convictions by questionable means. Similarly Holt refused to countenance evidence of a defendant's character prior to the events in question, though he carefully applied this rule when such evidence might have helped a defendant as well as when it might not.<br>
<br>Holt's care with evidence reveals the precision of his mind in applying law, not a peculiar sensitivity for the accused. This was apparent in his handling of the treason case against Sir William Parkyns. Parkyns complained that he had not had sufficient time to gather his witnesses. None the less, Holt denied his request for a delay, saying that Parkyns had had ample time, even though he had received notice of trial just six days earlier and had been delayed in meeting with his solicitor. Parkyns next asked for counsel in court, pointing to a statute providing for counsel in treason trials due to take effect the day following his arrest. Holt again refused: &#145;we are to proceed according to what the law is, and not what it will be&#146;. Parkyns responded that the preamble to the new law noted that the change thereby enacted was simply &#145;declarative of the common law&#146; because it was a provision that was &#145;always just and reasonable&#146;; Parkyns reasoned that &#145;what is just and reasonable tomorrow, sure is just and reasonable today&#146;. Holt stood firm: &#145;We cannot alter the law till lawmakers do it &hellip; it is not a law till the time comes that the parliament hath appointed&#146;  (<span class="italic">State trials</span>, 13.72&#150;3). Holt denied Robert Charnock the same request. &#145;We are not here in a court of equity, but must proceed according to the rules of law&#146;  (ibid., 12.1382). Both men were executed.<br>
<br>Holt proved as ready as most of his contemporaries on the bench to chastise jurors when he disagreed with their verdicts. When the jury hearing one of the first actions of criminal conversation&#151;brought by the duke of Norfolk against John Germaine for adultery with his duchess&#151;Holt approved the jury's finding of adultery but berated them for fining Germaine only 100 marks with costs. In 1700, in another adultery action, Holt rejected the jury's first verdict and scolded them again when their second verdict was little better.<br>
<br>Holt's judgments in a few slavery cases have traditionally been celebrated as much as his conduct of criminal cases, though again the legacy appears more mixed upon closer analysis. Holt proclaimed in 1701, &#145;as soon as a negro comes into England, he becomes free: one may be a villein in England, but not a slave&#146;. While this applied to England itself, Holt by no means negated laws elsewhere that made chattel slavery legal. As he put it, &#145;the sale was in Virginia, and, by the laws of that country, negroes are saleable; for the laws of England do not extend to Virginia; being a conquered country their law is what the king pleases&#146;  (91 ER 566). Holt recommended that the plaintiff simply amend his declaration in order to make good on his plea of debt for the sale of a slave.<br>
<br>Holt's rulings were less ambiguous in three other areas: commerce, corporations, and administrative law. His impact on commercial law was made largely in the area of negotiable bills of exchange. Posterity has judged him harshly for his judgments in <i>Clerke v. Martin</i>  (92 ER 6) and in <i>Buller v. Crispe</i>  (87 ER 793), condemning his unwillingness to countenance the same procedures for disputed promissory notes as were available for bills of exchange. But Holt's reluctance to accept the imposition of bankers' innovations on the common law arose not only from his precise application of common law, but also from his sense that providing the same remedies in both instances would be to conflate non-commercial with commercial money transfer and lending practices. Holt feared this would give undue power to creditors by sweeping away the old law of debt with all its procedural protections for debtors. His unwillingness to accept alleged mercantile custom in the handling of notes also arose from his hesitance to innovate from the bench in a matter that would have such important implications for law and commerce. He felt that such innovation could only be made by statute, thus revealing the respect he accorded acts made by king-in-parliament. It has been suggested for this reason that Holt himself promoted the statute of 1704 governing the law of notes and bills by which they came to be handled in a similar fashion.<br>
<br>Elsewhere, Holt clarified principles concerning employer liability, declaring in 1697 that when a servant did some damage, &#145;it shall be intended, that the servant had authority from his master, it being for his master's benefit&#146;  (91 ER 1073). Holt carried this broad vicarious liability into the commercial setting, noting that &#145;the master at his peril ought to take care what servant he employs; and it is more reasonable, that [the master] should suffer for the cheats of his servant than strangers&#146;  (ibid., 91.797). In his judgment in <i>Coggs v. Barnard</i> of 1703, Holt separated problems associated with bailment from contract and tort by outlining clear categories by which to assess bailees' obligations. &#145;It is of great consequence, that the law should be settled in this point.&#146; In a rather rare display of modesty, he added, &#145;I don't know whether I may have settled it, or may not rather have unsettled it&#146;  (ibid., 92.114).<br>
<br>In corporation law, Holt's pronouncements built upon extensive experience. Both before and after he rose to the bench he consistently viewed all franchises, including corporate ones, as deriving only from the king. As such, where the liberties granted by the king were injurious to others or were abused by those holding them they could be seized by the king, by judgment either on <i>scire facias</i>, or, more commonly and controversially in the 1680s, on <i>quo warranto</i>. As Holt put it in 1692, &#145;a corporation is a trust reposed in several persons for the better ordering and managing the affairs of the city or town which is incorporated, and if that trust be broken, it incurs a forfeiture&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 35982, fol. 23).<br>
<br>Holt's 1683 advice that London should surrender its charter arose from this position. Holt reiterated this view of the royal origin of franchises&#151;and thus of the legality of charter surrenders&#151;in the parliamentary debates of 1689&#150;90 concerning London and the other corporations that had lost their charters, and again in Sir James Smith's case of 1691&#150;2. Though politically suspect after 1689 for their use in the 1680s to control the corporations, <i>quo warranto</i> was thus preserved by Holt for future use to constrain arbitrary behaviour in corporations. With the Hertford <i>quo warranto</i> of 1698&#150;9, Holt made clear what would be the practice in the years ahead: that individuals rather than the corporation as a whole would be liable for misdeeds. Since corporation members acted according to privileges granted by the king, it would continue to be the role of the king's principal court to inspect&#151;by <i>quo warranto</i>&#151;the use of those privileges and to oust or punish those who used them wrongly.<br>
<br>Holt's view of individual accountability for wrongs committed by corporations points to the active role he accorded his court in supervising other jurisdictions. In 1699 he grandly proclaimed: &#145;it is by the common law that this Court will examine if other Courts exceed their jurisdictions&#146;  (91 ER 1212). He reinforced the point in the case of <i>Cardiff Bridge</i>: &#145;wherever any new jurisdiction is erected &hellip; they are subject to the inspections of this Court by writ of error, or by certiorari and mandamus&#146;  (91 ER 135). Holt strengthened his court's broad power to review the work of other tribunals by clarifying procedure in the use of <i>certiorari</i> and <i>mandamus</i>, by vigorously imposing fines and attachments on those who were slow to return these writs, and by speaking forcefully to questions about where these writs lay. In particular, Holt largely resolved the question about the rationale for granting <i>mandamus</i>, a question on which the court had vacillated throughout the previous century: namely whether it was granted to help gain restitution to office conceived as a type of private property, or whether restoration to office and other uses of <i>mandamus</i> should arise from the public quality of office and official actions. Holt was clear: <i>mandamus</i> lay only where the matter in question concerned the public. By stressing this aspect of local office-holding, he sharpened the distinction between private property and public duties and justified the broad authority over other jurisdictions he accorded his court. For Holt, only parliament acting legislatively stood above such review. No other agencies or courts had &#145;a sovereign power. Therefore all their acts &hellip; are subject to the review of the king's courts, which [acts] are so far valid as they are agreeable to law and right reason&#146;  (Hamburger, 2140). Agreement with law and reason were for Holt and his judicial peers to determine.<br>
<br>Though Holt held statutes made by king-in-parliament as the highest law, he was never shy about challenging arbitrary commands of the separate houses when not acting legislatively. Thus he quashed a murder indictment against Charles Knollys after Knollys argued that he was the earl of Banbury and that he had thus been misnamed in the indictment. Knollys's claims to the earldom had been rejected by the House of Lords. The Lords thus considered it a contempt that Holt had dismissed the charge against Knollys on grounds that he was a peer. But when the house demanded an explanation for the decision, Holt grandly refused, stating that &#145;I gave my judgment according to my conscience&#146;  (<span class="italic">State trials</span>, 12.1179) and that he owed an account to no one for what he did judicially. Rumours circulated that Holt might be imprisoned for this further contempt, but the matter was silently dropped.<br>
<br>The case of <i>Ashby v. White</i> occasioned a similar conflict with the House of Commons. Matthew Ashby had been denied his vote at Aylesbury's parliamentary election, so he sued Mayor William White and won the verdict. White then appealed to queen's bench, where all the judges, except Holt, reversed the initial result, contending that the Commons alone determined rights of election. Ashby next turned to the House of Lords on a writ of error in 1703&#150;4. Holt's view&#151;that this concerned rights of Englishmen for which only the courts could provide relief, and that the Lords, as the highest court, could proceed on a writ of error&#151;now prevailed. The Commons responded by declaring that by pursuing the matter in the House of Lords Ashby had committed a breach of their privilege.<br>
<br>Disputes only intensified as five more Aylesbury voters sued White too. The Commons summoned all five, examined them, and then imprisoned them for breach of privilege. The Aylesbury voters now resorted to queen's bench for writs of habeas corpus. Again, three of the court's justices refused to bail them because they stood committed by the Commons, which commitments they said were beyond their review. Again, Holt disagreed:<blockquote>Neither House of Parliament hath power, no, not both together, to dispose, limit, or diminish the liberty or property of the subject, because by law (which is superior to the actions or determinations of either House) that liberty or property is established, and cannot be diminished or infringed by a less[er] authority than the legislature of the kingdom, which is the Queen, the Lords, and Commons assembled in Parliament. (Hamburger, 2145)</blockquote>Holt always recognized that statute made by queen-in-parliament stood above judicial review. But the pronouncements of each house when acting otherwise than by legislation were not beyond the law applied in his court. Holt had challenged both the Commons' claim to determine all rights of election and their power to imprison. Such bold assertions, consistent with his other views as a jurist, failed to sway his contemporaries.<h2>
<a name="Holtoutsidecourt16891710"></a>Holt outside court, 1689&#150;1710</h2>Holt's commitments as a jurist in no way diminished his political commitments to the revolution settlement and to the king, who made him a privy councillor&#151;on 26 September 1689&#151;as well as a judge. While he presided in numerous treason trials and investigated various plots, his reports to the privy council often served to constrain those in government who hoped to stretch legal principles or practices to ensnare as many of the regime's enemies as possible. But like justices of previous generations, Holt often used his place on the bench to defend the crown from its critics. As he noted during the 1704 trial of John Tutchin for seditious libel:<blockquote>To say that corrupt officers are appointed to administer affairs, is certainly a reflection on the government. If people should not be called to account for possessing the people with an ill opinion of the government, no government can subsist. (<span class="italic">State trials</span>, 14.1128)</blockquote>It is a sign though of Holt's concern for the precise application of law that he then agreed to quash a guilty verdict of which he clearly approved once it was seen that the writ on which Tutchin was tried had been misdated.<br>
<br>The king asked Holt to be lord chancellor in April 1700. He refused, saying he did not know enough of equity to hold the office, though he did serve for one month as one of the commissioners of the great seal until Sir Nathan Wright became lord keeper. In the years following, Holt was troubled by occasional bouts of illness, though this did not prevent his continuing to ride the assize circuits. In 1708 the queen herself shared fears for his health and implored him to rest. A brief spell in Bath may have helped, and Holt was soon back in his post. Rumours now circulated that he might receive a peerage, but by the winter of 1710 his health declined sharply. He died on 5 March 1710 at his house in Bedford Row, London, and was buried on 20 March in the church at Redgrave, Suffolk, the manor of which he had purchased from Sir Robert Bacon. He was survived by his wife; common report suggested that neither enjoyed the union. Having no children, Holt left the bulk of his estate to his brother Rowland, reserving a &pound;700 per annum rent charge for his widow's maintenance. Throughout, Holt had shown great loyalty to his brother, appointing him as master of king's bench&#151;which occasioned a battle with the duchess of Grafton over the right of appointment&#151;and helping him gain the post of comptroller of the customs.<br>
<br>Holt never lacked confidence in his opinions, which permitted him to hold out against the threats of both houses of parliament at different times. When the countess of Anglesey came to Holt and showed him the bruises inflicted by her husband, Holt imposed a bond of &pound;8000 on the earl to keep the peace. A man of Holt's confidence was also quick to protect his dignity, as in 1696 when he ordered the arrest of the bookseller Brabazon Aylmer for his account of Sir John Friend's trial, which had offended Holt. Holt likewise reprimanded three clergymen in 1699 for their criticism of his condemnation of a coiner at Kingston assizes. No less a figure than Daniel Defoe felt it necessary to publish an apology in 1706 when Holt imposed a &pound;200 bond on him after Defoe wrote a piece that was generally understood to reflect negatively on the chief justice.<br>
<br>A monument in the church at Redgrave, carved by Thomas Green, shows Holt seated in his robes, flanked by Justice and Mercy. For twenty-one years on the bench he had served both virtues, though perhaps in less perfect balance than later hagiographers have ascribed to him. But this is not to diminish his accomplishments. Holt's rulings contributed significantly to the development of the law of commerce, of corporations, and of public administration. His collisions with both Lords and Commons highlighted the dangers of peremptory parliamentary behaviour as parliament moved increasingly to the fore in the constitution. Though he wrote no great treatises, his opinions&#151;available in printed reports as well as in his manuscripts in the British Library and the Harvard law school&#151;show his erudition, the neatness of his mind, and the force of his ideas. Holt not only possessed a comprehensive knowledge of the statutes and reports from which common law was constructed, he also read deeply in the civil law and was well acquainted with the ideas of John Locke and other natural law theorists. Presiding over the kingdom's leading court for two decades after the political transformations wrought in 1688&#150;9, Holt was peculiarly positioned by learning and experience to make a deep and lasting imprint on the law.<br>
