<span class="headword">Apulia,  Simon  of</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1223), <span class="occ">bishop of Exeter</span>, was a native of southern Italy; as bishop he used a signet featuring St Nicholas of Myra, much venerated in Bari. His parentage is unknown, and nothing can be said of his early career except that he was a lawyer, styled <i>magister</i>, and may have been the author of a <i>summa</i>. By 1186 he was a canon of York (probably then, as later, holding the prebend of South Newbald), where he became chancellor no later than 1190, and late in 1193 was made dean. The circumstances were controversial. Archbishop Geoffrey at first chose his own brother Peter as dean, then named Simon (who may previously have been his clerk), and finally opted for Philip of Poitou when Simon refused to give up his chancellorship. However, the cathedral canons wanted Simon and duly elected him (the first time they had elected their dean, who had hitherto been appointed either by the archbishop or the king), after which Simon went to Rome and secured nomination by Celestine III, who invested him on 17 May 1194. A payment of 1000 marks secured royal approval. Probably to keep out of Geoffrey's way Simon did not return to York until the following February, and relations between them were almost always bad afterwards; a reconciliation in 1200 failed to last long. In 1195&#150;6 Simon administered the see of York during the archbishop's suspension. In 1201 he claimed the provostship of Beverley, probably unsuccessfully.<br>
<br>Simon of Apulia remained dean of York until 1214, when he was made bishop of Exeter. Bishop Henry Marshal had died on 26 October 1206. The long vacancy that followed, the third such at Exeter in thirty-nine years, was caused by King John's quarrel with Innocent III over the latter's nomination of Stephen Langton as archbishop of Canterbury, which led to a papal interdict on England (1208&#150;14) and John's excommunication (1209&#150;13). In 1209, following the pope's order to the chapter to elect a bishop, the canons elected Henry of London, archdeacon of Stafford, although ineffectively. But in April 1214, following John's submission to the pope, the king and the papal legate, Pandulf, forced the chapter to elect Simon, and on 5 October following Langton consecrated him at Canterbury. The first Italian to obtain a place on the English bench since Anselm, Simon almost immediately departed for Rome, where he attended the Fourth Lateran Council. He had returned to England by 28 October 1216, when he took part in the coronation of the young Henry III at Gloucester.<br>
<br>England was severely disturbed by civil war and foreign invasion during the early years of Simon's episcopate. In January 1218 there was a dispute over the sheriffdom of Devon, and in February the regent, William (I) Marshal, and the papal legate, Guala Bicchieri, visited Exeter and left Robert de Courtenay, lord of Okehampton, in charge there. But the area remained unsettled for some time. In 1220 Simon (who seems to have been on friendly terms with the king's guardian, Peter des Roches) helped to restore royal authority in the south-west when he led a delegation from Cornwall to the royal council, which successfully offered 500 marks for the replacement of Henry fitz Count (dangerously independent in the council's eyes) with a local man as sheriff of the county. As bishop, Simon seems to have managed adequately with the difficult situation. But little documentation of his government has survived, only two original <i>acta</i> and ten copies, four of which come from the Truro cartulary. None of his <i>acta</i> is dated and only two have a witness list. For the first time, however, the name of the bishop's official&#151;Mr John&#151;is revealed. It also seems, on the evidence of the <span class="roman">Exeter Chronicle</span>, that in 1222 Simon fixed the parishes of the city of Exeter. His nephew, Simon, was archdeacon of Cornwall (1218&#150;21). Bishop Simon died on 9 September 1223 and was buried in his cathedral, on the south side of the lady chapel. He was remembered for continuing the rebuilding of the cathedral church and as a generous donor of vestments and ornaments to its treasury.<br>
