<span class="headword">Weston, Sir  Richard</span>  (1620&#150;1681), <span class="occ">judge and politician</span>, was the son of Edward Weston (<i>d</i>. 1645) of Hackney, Middlesex, and his wife, Mary. The Westons were descended from a Sussex family and owned land in the county. Richard Weston was his father's heir and, presumably, his eldest son. Weston matriculated from Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, in 1639, and from Jesus College, Cambridge, in 1641. He took no degree, however, and entered Gray's Inn on 10 August 1642. Weston was called to the bar in 1649. In 1645 his father died and Weston took possession of the family lands. On 30 June 1657 he married Frances Marwood, daughter of Sir George Marwood, baronet, of Little Busby in Yorkshire. No children are mentioned in Weston's will.<br>
<br>After the Restoration, Weston practised law, and his arguments in court were sufficient to gain mention in Sir Thomas Raymond's <span class="italic">Reports of Divers Special Cases</span>. Weston also had a brief parliamentary career, as the member from Weobley, Herefordshire, in the Convention Parliament of 1660. He served on eight committees, including those which drafted the <span class="roman">Indemnity Bill</span> and confirmed parliamentary privileges. His legal expertise probably proved useful to the committee to continue judicial proceedings, and he also served on the committee that examined Oliver Cromwell's counsellor and spymaster, John Thurloe. In his few recorded speeches Weston emerged as a supporter of the episcopal church, and it seems likely that he was already displaying the strong royalist bent for which he later became known. Weston's parliamentary career was cut short on 16 July 1660 when, for unknown reasons, the House of Commons voided the Weobley election.<br>
<br>Weston never re-entered parliament. In 1664, probably due to his wife's Yorkshire connections, he was made a justice of the peace in Cawood, in the West Riding. Weston purchased the Yorkshire estate of Little Cattall in 1669. He served as a commissioner for assessment in the West Riding from 1673 until 1680, and as the recorder of Beverley from 1675 to 1678. As for his legal career, Weston was made reader of Gray's Inn in 1676, serjeant-at-law on 23 October 1677, and king's serjeant on 5 February 1678, whereupon he was knighted. The climax of his career came with his appointment to the bench of the exchequer on 7 February 1680. Weston's ascent seems to have been fuelled by the favour of Thomas Osborne, earl of Danby. He apparently repaid this patronage by drafting Danby's pardon in 1679. This was no doubt unpopular with the House of Commons, which responded by expressly forbidding Weston from acting as Danby's counsel. By this time Weston had become entangled in the factionalism of these tumultuous years, and he was known as a staunch defender of royal prerogative.<br>
<br>As a judge Weston was &#145;obliging, condescensive, and communicative&#146;  (Irving, 114), but he also displayed a hot temper (reportedly exacerbated by gout). Weston caused a stir while presiding over the Kingston assizes in July 1680. When a group of nonconformists was brought before him, Weston's charge to the grand jury included scathing remarks about Calvin and Zwingli. He also declared that &#145;now they were amusing us with fears, and nothing would serve them but a parliament &hellip; for my part I know no representative of the nation but the king; all power centres in him&#146;  (Foss, <span class="italic">Judges</span>, 719). These intemperate remarks would haunt Weston. At the same assizes he made an enemy of George Jeffreys, who appeared before him as an advocate. Weston abruptly rebuked Jeffreys when the latter engaged in an overly hostile examination of a witness. When Jeffreys complained of this treatment, Weston exclaimed &#145;Ha! Since the King has thrown his favours upon you &hellip; you think to run down everybody. If you think you are aggrieved, make your complaint. Here nobody cares for it.&#146; Reports of this exchange soon worked their way to London. Jeffreys may have had a hand in Weston's subsequent troubles before parliament. When the Commons moved to impeach a number of tory judges (including Chief Justice Scroggs) Weston was included for his remarks at the Kingston assizes, which were considered derogatory to the Reformation and tending to raise discord. Undaunted, Weston defied the house by granting a writ of habeas corpus to another of its targets, Thomas Sheridan. But the dissolution of the parliament delayed the impeachment proceedings. In August 1680 Weston presided over the trial of a nonconformist accused of assaulting an Anglican priest, during which he was accused by the defendant of being &#145;popishly affected&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, 22.422). Controversial to the end, Weston died suddenly on 18 March 1681 at his home in Chancery Lane, London, and was buried three days later at Hackney.<br>
