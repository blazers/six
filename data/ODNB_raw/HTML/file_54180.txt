<span class="headword">Elizabeth</span> <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Elizabeth  de Burgh]</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1327), <span class="occ">queen of Scots</span>, consort of Robert I, was the second daughter and one of ten children of Richard de Burgh, earl of Ulster (<i>d</i>. 1326), and his wife, Margaret (<i>d</i>. 1304), who may also have been a de Burgh. Elizabeth was probably born in Down or Antrim. In 1302, in an alliance which conformed to a pattern of family behaviour going back at least to the later twelfth century&#151;the earls of Carrick held lands in Ulster&#151;she became the second wife of Robert Bruce, earl of Carrick and future king of Scots (1274&#150;1329) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/3754/', "Robert I")</script>]. From 1298 to 1300 he had been one of the guardians of Scotland for the exiled King John, but at the beginning of 1302 he had come into Edward I's peace and allegiance.<br>
<br>Within four years of her marriage Elizabeth de Burgh became queen of Scots when her husband led a revolt against the English occupation of Scotland and was inaugurated as king at Scone on 25 March 1306. Three months later the new king and queen were fugitives, hunted through the hills of Perthshire and Aberdeenshire. It was decided to send the queen and other women in the party to Kildrummy Castle in Strathdon, in the charge of John, earl of Atholl. Pursued there by an English force under Aymer de Valence (<i>d</i>. 1324), the royal party was sent on northward, perhaps with the intention of reaching Orkney. They had got only as far as St Duthac's sanctuary at Tain, Ross-shire, when they were seized by the pro-English earl of Ross, who sent them to Edward I. King Robert's sister Mary and Isabel, countess of Buchan (who had crowned Bruce), received harsh punishment, being confined for several years in cages, but Queen Elizabeth, daughter of one of the English king's principal barons, was ordered to be confined in the manor house at Burstwick in Holderness, attended by two elderly maidservants of sober temperament. From Burstwick the queen, styling herself simply Elizabeth Bruce, sent an undated letter to Edward I or II, telling him that her warders allowed her only three changes of clothing a year, no headgear, and nothing for her bed, while her attendants had only one robe a year each, and begging him to order an improvement in her circumstances or to make her a money allowance. At various later dates she was transferred to other places, including the Tower of London and the nunnery at Shaftesbury in Dorset. It was said that she had increased her chances of leniency when at their enthronement she had jested to her husband that he might be a summer king but would never be a winter one. Fascinating as is this relatively early reference to the widespread children's custom of choosing summer kings and queens, the authenticity of the report must be regarded as doubtful. By March 1312 Elizabeth was in the Tower of London, where her situation had improved greatly: she was allowed two damsels, two esquires, and two yeomen, and 40<i>s</i>. a week to pay for them.<br>
<br>King Robert's great victory at Bannockburn in June 1314 allowed the royal prisoners still in English hands to be restored to Scotland. Queen Elizabeth and her stepdaughter Marjorie Bruce, along with Mary Bruce, the king's sister, were freed in exchange for the earl of Hereford. The daughters of Robert and Elizabeth must have been born after their mother's release from captivity. The king's only surviving brother, Edward, was declared heir presumptive to the Scottish throne in 1315 because the situation in which the realm found itself remained perilous. After Edward, however, the king's next heir was unquestionably his eldest daughter, Marjorie, whose mother, Isabel of Mar, had died young. In March 1316 Marjorie gave birth to a son, Robert Stewart, who became presumptive heir when Edward Bruce was killed at Dundalk in 1318. But at Dunfermline Abbey on 5 March 1324, a decade after her release from imprisonment, Queen Elizabeth bore a son, named David [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/3726/', "David II")</script>], presumably in honour of David I (<i>d</i>. 1153), and he at once became the heir apparent, formally recognized as such in the parliament of 1326.<br>
<br>Elizabeth died at the royal residence of Cullen on the Banffshire coast on 26 October 1327 and was buried in the choir of Dunfermline Abbey, resting place of Scottish kings and queens since 1093. A chaplainry was established in the church of St Mary the Virgin at Cullen to celebrate masses for the queen's soul.<br>
