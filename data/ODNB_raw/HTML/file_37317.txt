<span class="headword">Cowper,  Edward Alfred</span>  (1819&#150;1893), <span class="occ">mechanical engineer</span>, was born in London on 10 December 1819, the son of Ann Applegath and her husband, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6504/', "Professor Edward Shickle Cowper (1790&#150;1852)")</script>, head of the department of engineering at King's College, London, who, with his brother-in-law Augustus Applegath, developed an improved newspaper printing press. At the age of fourteen in 1833, Cowper was apprenticed for seven years to John Braithwaite, an eminent locomotive and railway engineer in London, and while in Braithwaite's service he invented, in 1837, the detonating railway fog signal, first tried on the Croydon line and widely used thereafter as an emergency safety measure. In 1841 Cowper joined Fox and Henderson, structural and railway engineers, in Smethwick, near Birmingham, where, as chief draughtsman and designer, he devised an ingenious method of casting railway chairs, and also designed the wrought-iron roof of the New Street Station in Birmingham, which, with a span of 211 feet, was the largest iron roof at the time of its completion. In 1846&#150;7 he took a leading part in the foundation of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers; in 1848 he was elected a member of its council, and in 1880&#150;81 served as president. He was elected a member of the Institution of Civil Engineers in 1860, and was a member of council in 1879.<br>
<br>At the end of 1851, after supervising preparation of the contract drawings for the Great Exhibition building (the Crystal Palace), Cowper left Fox and Henderson to practise on his own account in London as a consulting engineer. One of his first commissions was to undertake the necessary redesign of the Crystal Palace prior to its re-erection in Sydenham in 1852&#150;4. Developing the ideas of his friend C. W. Siemens, in 1857 he invented the regenerative hot blast stove known as the Cowper stove, which greatly improved the economy of the hot blast process (patented in 1828 by James B. Neilson) in the making of steel. The first of these stoves was constructed in 1859, and various improvements were effected in the design up to 1887 both by Cowper and by his son, Charles Edward Cowper, whom he took into partnership shortly before his death. The principle of the regenerative stove is still in widespread use in the iron and steel, glass, and other industries.<br>
<br>Cowper was also greatly interested in the economy of the steam engine, becoming an ardent advocate of compounding and steam-jacketing. About the year 1858 he introduced the steam-jacketed receiver which was subsequently known in the navy as &#145;Cowper's hot-pot&#146;. Among his many other inventions were a wire spoke suspension wheel with a rubber tyre (practically the modern bicycle wheel) and the writing telegraph, which was an electromechanical precursor of modern facsimile equipment. He published several papers in the <span class="italic">Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers</span>, including &#145;An inverted arch suspension bridge&#146; (1847), &#145;Blast engines for the East Indian Iron Company&#146; (1855), and &#145;Regenerative hot-blast stoves working at a temperature of 1,300&deg;F&#146; (1860). Cowper died of pneumonia at his home, Rastricke, Pine Grove, Weybridge, Surrey, on 9 May 1893, leaving a widow, Juliana. Their date of marriage is unknown; they had at least one son.<br>
