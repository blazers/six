<span class="headword">Pigeon,  Anna</span>  (1832&#150;1917), <span class="occ">mountaineer</span>, was born at South Side, Clapham Common, London, in July 1832, the sixth daughter of Henry Pigeon, a distiller and wine importer, of Clapham and 158 Borough High Street, Southwark. She and her sister <a name="cosubject_50649"></a><span class="headword">Ellen Pigeon <span class="st"> [<em>married name </em>Abbot]</span></span>  (1836&#150;1902) were two of the earliest and most accomplished women <span class="occ">mountaineers</span>. Their parents left them well provided for financially, and they were able to maintain a substantial household in Clapham. They began climbing in the Alps in 1869, and became famous that year for their traverse of the Sesia-joch or Seserjoch, a pass between Zermatt and Alagna. The pass had been climbed only once, seven years before, and John Ball's guide to the western Alps doubted whether the ascent would ever be repeated. The Pigeon sisters were attempting to cross another pass, the Lysjoch, when their guide lost the way in the mist. As they descended, Jean Martin, the guide, led and cut steps in the ice, but their porter was so clumsy that Anna placed herself last on the rope, the position most responsible for the safety of the party, so that she could anchor the rope if anyone slipped. Only when they reached the bottom of the face after eighteen hours did they realize that they had made the first descent of the Sesia-joch. Male climbers were astonished at their feat, which challenged contemporary assumptions about gender. The <span class="italic">Monte Rosa Gazzetta della Val Sesia</span> concluded that the absence of fatalities on the expedition was &#145;due to their courage, their habitude to Alpine travel, and especially to the masculine education, too little imitated by the Italians, which the English give their children&#146;  (<span class="italic">Alpine Journal</span>, 369).<br>
<br>From 1872 to 1876 the Pigeon sisters compiled a remarkable climbing record that included 66 peaks over 10,000 feet and 60 passes over 9000 feet, as well as more ascents at lower elevations. Their ascents included the Dom, Aletschhorn, Wetterhorn, Monte Rosa, Grand Combin, Aiguille Verte, Eiger, Schreckhorn, Jungfrau, Finsteraarhorn, and Dent d'Herens. They climbed the Matterhorn twice, including the first female traverse from Breuil to Zermatt in 1873. They privately published <span class="italic">Peaks and Passes</span> (1885), a short book listing their mountaineering tours. Ellen Pigeon married on 27 March 1876 Bradley Abbot (<i>d</i>. 1896), a widower, the vicar of Christ Church, Clapham.<br>
<br>Despite their achievements, the Pigeon sisters were not readily accepted by male mountaineers. Ellen told W. A. B. Coolidge in 1892 that &#145;in days gone by many A. C.s [members of the Alpine Club] would not speak to us&#146;  (Clark, 175). Ellen Abbot died at 40 Weymouth Street, Marylebone, London, on 5 July 1902. In 1910 Anna Pigeon was elected to the Ladies' Alpine Club, founded in 1907, and became one of its vice-presidents the same year and an honorary member in 1911. She died, unmarried, on 15 March 1917 at her home, 42 South Side, Clapham Common, London. Her death certificate described her occupation as &#145;of independent means, property and shareholder, spinster&#146;. A funeral service was held on 20 March at the parish church, Clapham, after which she was buried in her sister's grave at Norwood cemetery.<br>
