<span class="headword">Ogle, Sir  John</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1569, <em>d.</em> 1640), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was baptized at Pinchbeck, Lincolnshire, on 28 February 1569, the fifth son of Thomas Ogle (<i>d</i>. 1574) of Pinchbeck and his wife, Jane (<i>d</i>. 1574), daughter of Adelard Welby of Gedney, Lincolnshire. Nothing is known of John Ogle's early life and he seems to have chosen a military career early on. He went to the Netherlands in 1591, where he joined the company of Sir Francis Vere, sergeant-major-general of the English forces aiding the Dutch republic, whose faithful follower he became. Much of what we know of Vere's campaigns comes from his <span class="italic">Commentaries</span>, but the original seventeenth-century editor included substantial chunks of material specially written by Ogle to flesh out Vere's manuscript.<br>
<br>In 1598 most of the English army under Vere was transferred into Dutch pay&#151;becoming mercenaries in modern terms. On 30 June 1600 the English contingent of the Dutch army played a vital role in the great battle of Nieuwpoort. Ogle rescued his general when Vere was unhorsed (&#145;his blood remained on my clothes&#146;), helped to rally the retreating English infantry, and was in the forefront of their counter-attack, which helped to win a famous victory  (Vere, 162). The following year Vere and his troops defended Ostend against the celebrated Spanish siege, which lasted until 1604: the city became known as &#145;the new Troy&#146;.<br>
<br>By 1601 Ogle was Vere's lieutenant-colonel (a rank he acquired at some point after Nieuwpoort) and invaluable assistant. In early 1602 Ogle and Sir Charles Fairfax acted as hostages in the Spanish camp during &#145;capitulation&#146; negotiations&#151;actually aimed at gaining time. When reinforcements arrived and the talks were abandoned both men could well have been executed by the Spanish, as Vere knew from the start: &#145;What shall I do for my Lieutenant Colonel?&#146; was his refrain and he was ready to pay Ogle's ransom &#145;five times over&#146;  (Vere, 195). But both hostages were released in time to do their part in repulsing a major Spanish assault. Ogle had already lost his left eye to &#145;a small shot&#146; earlier in the siege  (<span class="italic">Salisbury MSS</span>, 11.293); ever after he wore a black eye patch.<br>
<br>By this time it was obvious that Queen Elizabeth could not last long. The Dutch authorities saw a chance to integrate the English troops fully into the national army. Ambitious English officers intrigued against Sir Francis Vere hoping to win favour with the Dutch, but Ogle took his own steps against them. He personally thrashed the lieutenant of Callisthenes Brooke, who had attracted the general's ire, and incited his men to attack John Ridgeway, who frequently complained about Sir Francis. In the end, however, Vere resigned his command in 1604. He was replaced by his younger brother, Sir Horace, and the older Vere's departure proved a great opportunity for Ogle, who had been knighted on a visit home to England on 10 December 1603. Having distinguished himself in the capture of Sluys in the summer of 1604, he was made full colonel in the Dutch army in 1605. However, he was bitter against his fellow colonel Sir Edward Cecil who had agitated against Sir Francis Vere and there was considerable tension among English officers even after the twelve years' truce began in 1609, suspending the war with Spain.<br>
<br>In 1610 the first Arminian troubles broke out. It is a measure of the trust placed in Ogle that he was chosen as governor of Utrecht, where there had been a revolt. Sir John was, Horace Vere suggested, to &#145;administer verry dire&#146;  (Trim, 347). Ogle initially thought he could &#145;assure the loyalty of the citizens without need of a garrison at all&#146; (&#145;<i>s'asseure si bien de la loyaulte des bourgeois &hellip; qu'il ne sera pas besoing de garnison en tout</i>&#146;; Rijksarchief Zuid-Holland, Den Haag, Archief van Johan van Oldenbarnevelt 1318), but though he soon wanted more troops, ultimately he was successful in conciliating the townsmen. Moving his family in straight away was a clever gesture of trust, while it must have helped that Ogle had married a Dutchwoman: Elizabeth, daughter of Cornelius de Vries of Dordrecht. They had four sons and eight daughters, one of whom died young, and two of whom, born in Utrecht, were named after the city: Utricia and Trajectina. The states of Utrecht even voted Utricia a life annuity of &pound;20, which indicates Ogle's ability to win them over.<br>
<br>In this period Ogle led his regiment in Prince Maurice of Nassau's campaign in Cleves-J&uuml;lich in 1614, but otherwise remained in Utrecht. He kept Sir Thomas (later first baron) Fairfax updated with news from the continent, exchanging gloomy forecasts about future threats from the Habsburgs and indignant protests about a Spanish marriage for Prince Charles. When Fairfax's son William joined the Dutch army his father put him in Ogle's care. Ogle also kept in touch with potential patrons in England. He corresponded with Buckingham, promising to &#145;do his best&#146; to procure a place in the states army for Buckingham's client Sir John Manwood  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Add. D. 110, no. 276): in 1627, eight years later, Ogle's eldest daughter, Livinia, married Manwood, by then chief justice of common pleas.<br>
<br>Meanwhile Maurice of Nassau, stadholder and captain-general (and the man who had got rid of Francis Vere), had come into direct conflict with the advocate of Holland (and unofficial chief minister of the republic), Johan van Oldenbarnevelt, partly over Arminianism, which he had come loosely to support. In 1618 matters came to a head: Oldenbarnevelt was arrested (to be executed the following year). Ogle chose chaplains who were strongly orthodox Calvinists, but Oldenbarnevelt was his patron, so the Englishman must have felt torn. In the end he did not support Oldenbarnevelt in a proposed strike against Maurice&#151;but neither did he act decisively against his benefactor. Consequently he was replaced in Utrecht by Horace Vere and, in 1619 or early 1620, went home. Ogle seems never to have returned to the Netherlands, but he did maintain a correspondence with his circle of Dutch friends, including important figures such as Constantijn Huygens. (The correspondence of his eldest son, Sir John Ogle the younger, with Huygens, preserved in Leiden University Library, is probably a continuation of his father's.)<br>
<br>Fortunately Ogle's good contacts in Jacobean England served him well. His time in the Netherlands had been profitable and he invested in the Virginia Company. He appears in both the second (May 1609) and third (March 1612) charters as one of the company's promoters and in 1623 was elected to its council. In the latter year he was appointed to a commission to inspect all England's coastal fortifications, from Land's End to the Thames estuary. Expert in siege warfare, he was well qualified, of course, but the links with Buckingham must have helped, and in the following year he was made a member of a new council of war, charged with considering whether England could intervene in the Thirty Years' War. It involved working with Sir Edward Cecil (now Viscount Wimbledon); unsurprisingly Ogle preferred to concentrate on his work as inspector of fortifications. In 1625, however, this caused him to be in Plymouth when troops were gathering for an expedition to Cadiz&#151;commanded by Wimbledon! Ogle was obliged to take on responsibility for the ill-disciplined and inadequately supplied conscripts, a task he undertook reluctantly.<br>
<br>There were domestic matters to consider. In May 1622 Ogle obtained a grant of denization to his wife and children; but a draft bill of 1626 to naturalize all twelve never became law. His eldest brother, Sir Richard, hopelessly in debt, died insolvent in the Fleet prison in 1627. John bought from Richard their father's manor of Pinchbeck, and though he seems to have lived mostly in London, he also purchased other lands in Lincolnshire and maintained an interest in his home county and in Yorkshire. He personally invested &pound;1100 in a venture promoted by the great Dutch fen-drainer Cornelius Vermuyden to drain Hatfield Chase in Yorkshire and Lincolnshire. Like so many plans of this type, it was opposed by those whose livelihood depended on their common rights in the fen, who in 1634 appealed for the venturers (including Ogle) to be imprisoned.<br>
<br>The financial problems caused by the project were probably the impetus for Ogle's return to the military sphere and that same year he obtained a captaincy in the Irish army from Lord Deputy Wentworth. His purpose was avowedly &#145;rather to mend his fortunes than to require his attendance&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>) but the &#145;thorough&#146; Wentworth was unimpressed. By 1638 Sir John was owed &pound;1464 11<i>s</i>. in back pay for himself and his company and had to solicit the king's letters for &#145;the speedy payment&#146; of the arrears  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1637&#150;8</i>, 427).<br>
<br>Sir John Ogle died in 1640. He was buried in Westminster Abbey on 17 March, and on 15 July his will of 6 December 1628 was proved. In it he left &pound;500 each to his younger sons, and &pound;50 apiece to his five unmarried daughters (Livinia had married in 1627), leaving additionally to Elizabeth and Utricia, the two eldest, lands in Lincolnshire. His wife, Elizabeth, was appointed sole executrix, but with the aid of five overseers&#151;three English and two Dutch. In death, as in life, Ogle was a nexus between England and the Netherlands.<br>
<br>If he never achieved the success or status of fellow soldiers like Horace Vere and Edward Cecil, John Ogle certainly had a varied career and interesting life, and showed a breadth of interests common to English military men of his time. By turns professional soldier, duellist, administrator, colonizer, patron of godly ministers, engineer, country squire, and speculator, Ogle was, if not a Renaissance man, very much a gentleman of his time.<br>
