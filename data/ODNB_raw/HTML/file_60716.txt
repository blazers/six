<span class="headword">Campbell,  George Douglas</span>, eighth duke of Argyll in the peerage of Scotland, and first duke of Argyll in the peerage of the United Kingdom  (1823&#150;1900), <span class="occ">politician and scientist</span>, was the second son of John Douglas Edward Henry Campbell (1777&#150;1847) and his second wife, Joan, daughter and heir of John and Helen Glassel of Longniddry, East Lothian. He was born on 30 April 1823 at his parents' residence, Ardencaple Castle, Dunbartonshire, where he was brought up. His mother, who had been orphaned early and brought up by Anne Grant of Laggan, died in 1828, when he was five years old. His father became a recluse, but from 1831 George Campbell had a stepmother: his father's third wife, Anne, widow of Dr George Cunningham Menteath of Glasgow, who had been his mother's physician at the time of her death following childbirth. Anne died a Roman Catholic in 1874.<h2>
<a name="Educationandearlypublicwork"></a>Education and early public work</h2>George Campbell was not reared to be a duke, for he had an elder brother, John, and his father, an MP until 1822, would succeed to the title only if his married brother had no heir. George Campbell was educated by private tutors: initially Church of Scotland ministers, then J. S. Howson (1816&#150;1885), later dean of Chester. A confident boy, his lonely education made him self-reliant and accustomed to forming his opinions in isolation and with little discussion, a disadvantage when he entered the collegiate world of cabinet-level politics. He was a poet and a competent artist. He was powerfully influenced in youth by his observation of highland wildlife and he early developed a lifelong interest in ornithology and geology. He briefly attended lectures, including those of James David Forbes (1809&#150;1868), at Edinburgh University in 1841 until poor health prevented his continuing them. He was influenced by Forbes's theories of glaciation and perhaps also by his passion for controversy.<br>
<br>In 1837 Campbell's elder brother died, and in 1839 his uncle, the sixth duke, died childless, his father thus becoming seventh duke of Argyll. George Campbell's status was thus transformed as he became marquess of Lorne and heir to the dukedom. The new duke, despite being perhaps the largest owner of church patronage in Scotland, sympathized with the claims of the Church of Scotland in the prolonged dispute over lay patronage which led to the Disruption of 1843. Lorne helped him prepare bills for the House of Lords on the subject and published anonymously <span class="italic">Letter to the Peers from a Peer's Son</span> (1842) on the dispute, its authorship soon being generally known. Lorne's view was that Lord Aberdeen, dangerously influenced by John Hope, was failing to prevent unnecessary disruption. Lorne did not approve of the secession from the established church, of which he continued to be a member, but he believed Scotland had been poorly treated by parliament. His study of the matter is set out in <span class="italic">Presbytery Examined: an Essay on the Ecclesiastical History of Scotland since the Reformation</span> (1848), which was reviewed by W. E. Gladstone in the <span class="italic">Quarterly Review</span> (December 1848) sympathetically with respect to the abilities, though not the arguments, of its author. Lorne believed that the church establishment in Scotland was the best representation of Scottish character, an effective balance between legitimate religious freedom and the dangers of private judgement (though he was influenced in his social thought by the evangelical theology of Thomas Chalmers, the leader of the disrupters). He deplored the Disruption and the self-righteousness of those who individually claimed the direct sanction of God for their opinions. In the heated religious atmosphere of Scotland in the half century after 1840, this moderate position, consistently enunciated by the head of one of Scotland's foremost families, was of some importance.<h2>
<a name="Marriagesuccessionasdukeandpoliticalrise"></a>Marriage, succession as duke, and political rise</h2>On 31 July 1844 Lorne married Lady Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1878), eldest daughter of George Granville Leveson-Gower, second duke of Sutherland, and his wife, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/16544/', "Harriet Elizabeth Georgiana Leveson-Gower")</script>, thus further uniting two of the largest landowning families in Scotland. His mother-in-law, Duchess Harriet, was mistress of the robes and a leading political hostess, and played an important part in managing Lorne's entry into public life. Among their twelve children was the philanthropist <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/48786/', "Lady Victoria Campbell")</script>.<br>
<br>The eighth duke of Argyll, as Lorne became on his father's death on 25 April 1847, was as a youth a Pittite (from reading the younger Pitt's speeches in his father's library) and by the early 1840s saw himself as a follower of Sir Robert Peel. He was irritated by Lord John Russell and the whigs and thought their views on free trade feeble. Argyll quickly established himself in Westminster politics, and especially as an orator by his maiden speech in May 1848 supporting the removal of Jewish disabilities. With one of the great ducal names, and his strong voice and striking red hair, he was courted by each of the political parties. After a speech in the Lords in 1850, Lord Stanley noted that he was<blockquote>the youngest peer who takes part in public affairs: he has some talent, more confidence, a diminutive figure, an affected style of dress, with long red hair loose over his shoulders, and a deep sonorous voice, capable of great rhetorical power. There is nothing to prevent this young man rising to a very high position except his too visible arrogance and conceit. &hellip; Brougham &hellip; clapped him on the back, with a &#145;well crowed, little Highland cock!&#146;, which the Duke did not appear to like. (<span class="italic">Disraeli, Derby and the Conservative Party</span>, 17&#150;18)</blockquote>By that year, at the age of twenty-seven, he was already well known, and in 1851 was elected FRS and chancellor of the University of St Andrews. His rise was confirmed in December 1852 when he became lord privy seal in Lord Aberdeen's coalition government, with the especial task of defending the government in the predominantly tory House of Lords, but with no departmental responsibilities.<br>
<br>Argyll was thus in cabinet but not really in office, a position repeated for much of his political career. This was due partly to his weak health, partly to his always vehemently expressed opinions, which were comparable to those of Lord John Russell in their angularity. Colleagues were wary of Argyll, though admiring his ability and combativeness. Argyll served on the cabinet committee to assist Gladstone on aspects of the 1853 budget but otherwise played little direct part in the extensive reforms of the coalition cabinet. He reminded his colleagues of the &#145;<i>drift</i> of circumstances&#146; by which Britain was becoming the ally of Turkey in the Near East crisis; but as war approached he vigorously, if anonymously, defended the cabinet's position in &#145;The diplomatic history of the Eastern question&#146;, <span class="italic">Edinburgh Review</span> (July 1854). When Aberdeen resigned, in January 1855, Argyll continued as lord privy seal in Palmerston's government, and did not resign from it with Gladstone and the Peelites in February 1855. He thus distanced himself from the Peelite group, with which he had become loosely associated. In December 1855 he transferred to the postmaster-generalship, a post he held until the government fell in February 1858. From June 1859, when Palmerston returned to office, until June 1866, when Russell's government resigned, Argyll was again lord privy seal; during 1860 he managed the Post Office while Lord Elgin was on a special mission to China. At the Post Office Argyll had the advantage of the support of Sir Rowland Hill; by his own admission he deferred on almost every occasion to Hill's energy and judgement in what was a period of considerable expansion of postal activities.<br>
<br>Like the Sutherland family with which he was by marriage associated, Argyll was a strong sympathizer with the anti-slavery movement in the USA and a strong opponent of the Confederate secessionists. For several years before the civil war began he corresponded with anti-slavers, and he met Harriet Beecher Stowe during her London visits. In cabinet he was, with Lord John Russell, the strongest opponent of sympathy or assistance being given to the Confederacy, his position being publicly stated in a strong speech in Edinburgh on 1 April 1863. He consistently opposed the cabinet's willingness to allow the gunship <i>Alabama</i> (built in England and sold to the Confederacy) to use British ports, arguing that she should have been detained and that manufacture of ironclad ships for sale to the South should have been prohibited.<h2>
<a name="SecretaryofstateforIndia18681874"></a>Secretary of state for India, 1868&#150;1874</h2>Argyll had long been interested in India and had on occasion spoken for the government in the Lords on that subject. He had published several articles in the <span class="italic">Edinburgh Review</span> on the mutiny and its governmental aftermath (later collected as <span class="italic">India under Dalhousie and Canning</span> 1865). When Gladstone formed his first government in December 1868, he appointed Argyll secretary of state for India. Argyll held the office&#151;his only major departmental post&#151;until the ministry resigned in February 1874. Argyll took office when the secretaryship had been strengthened in its authority by the quiet work of Sir Charles Wood and the imperial tone of Argyll's immediate predecessor, Lord Cranborne. Argyll's tone sounded similarly imperious and he soon had the reputation of being something of an autocrat, but while emphasizing the general authority of the home government over the viceroy and the Indian government, he was in practice ready to work towards agreements. Having been in Palmerston's cabinet during the Indian mutiny, he was reluctant to relinquish any imperial authority in India. He saw the advancement of Indians in the Indian Civil Service as destabilizing and in April 1869 he cancelled the plans for a scholarship scheme with the comment, &#145;it is one of our first duties towards the people of India to guard the safety of our own dominions. For this purpose, we must proceed gradually, employing only such Natives as we can trust&#146;  (dispatch, 8 April 1869, Williams, 311). But his view of security in India did not require territorial expansion into Persia or the north-west. His policy in the Persian Gulf was &#145;no interference where it can possibly be avoided&#146;, except to prevent piracy and protect trade  (memorandum, 11 Dec 1868; ibid., 204). He therefore quashed the demands of those wanting a &#145;forward policy&#146; towards Russian expansion in central Asia, and later coined the word &#145;Mervousness&#146; to describe those fretting over the Russian advance towards the city of Merv. Argyll thus brought no especial reforming zeal to the India Office. From the government's viewpoint, a ministry often overstretched was happy to have one area of its responsibility quiescent, and no attempt was made to urge reform upon Argyll.<br>
<br>Argyll was active in cabinet beyond his departmental brief. He expressed extensive reservations in 1869&#150;70 about Gladstone's proposed legislation on Irish land. Though his departure to Inveraray to be with his sick wife removed him from London at the critical moment, he had some success in modifying the bill. He was also active in Scottish education, introducing a bill in February 1869 into the Lords, the predecessor of what became the important act of 1872 which he saw through the Lords. However, Argyll did not have the full trust of his prime minister, who saw him as gifted, but erratic. Thus, when the viceroy of India, Lord Mayo, was assassinated in February 1872, it was on Lord Granville, the foreign secretary, that Gladstone chiefly relied when discussing a successor; Lord Northbrook was appointed despite Argyll's prolonged objections. Argyll left office in February 1874 without regret: &#145;Politically, too, there are many compensations to me, as I am not a Radical, and many of the extreme joints of our tail had been wagging too much&#146;  (Argyll to Northbrook, 13 Feb 1874, <span class="italic">Autobiography</span>, 2.289). Despite this, Argyll soon found himself working with the radicals on the Eastern question and in opposing what he saw as the Conservative government's imperialistic initiatives.<br>
<br>Argyll was, with Gladstone, the most prominent survivor of the cabinet which had fought the Crimean War for the integrity of the Ottoman empire. He believed that Russia in that war had received and had registered a strong caution. Argyll blamed the Porte for its failure to reform internally since 1856 and for its brutal suppression of dissident Christians in the Balkans. He was also confident that Russia, in supporting the cause of the Balkan Christians when the British government stood aside, would not go too far in her dismemberment of &#145;Turkey in Europe&#146;. Argyll spoke vehemently in the Lords and on public platforms against the government's conduct of the Eastern question in 1876&#150;8, and he also charged it with mishandling &#145;Afghan affairs&#146; in 1879&#150;80. He was an important representative of anti-Conservative opinion at court. In 1879 he published <span class="italic">The Eastern Question</span> in two volumes, of which <span class="italic">The Afghan Question from 1841 to 1878</span> (1879) was a substantial extract. Argyll was thus seen, slightly improbably, as a leading anti-Conservative critic when the government was defeated at the general election in 1880, even though he disapproved of the radicalism of Gladstone's Midlothian campaign and hoped Lord Granville would be the new prime minister.<h2>
<a name="EstatesandScotland"></a>Estates and Scotland</h2>Argyll's title and estates made him the dominant personality in the western highlands. He owned about 175,000 acres. Though the family was traditionally whig in politics, and Argyll was often described as a whig, he had none of the English whigs' veneration for prescriptive rights. &#145;No delusion&#146;, he wrote, &#145;can be greater than the common popular superstition that the clansmen under the Celtic system enjoyed rights and sources of wealth which they lost when that system was superseded and eventually destroyed&#146;  (<span class="italic">Unseen Foundations</span>, 265). For Argyll, the decisive moment in Scottish history was the change from clan-based customary society to a &#145;universal recognition of legally acknowledged rights&#146;, embodied in a strong law sustained by the monarchy  (ibid., 272). His relationship with his tenantry was thus businesslike, rather than paternal, and this conditioned his view of land law generally, which, chiefly but not uniquely in relationship to Ireland, involved him in frequent political controversy, since many Liberals from the late 1860s took a more sympathetic view of customary rights. Even so, he wore full highland dress at dinner when in Scotland and liked to be referred to as the Mac-Cailein-M&ograve;r (&#145;Son of the great Colin&#146;), the traditional title of the head of the clan Campbell.<br>
<br>Argyll was from the first a notably vigorous landowner. During his father's dukedom he took much responsibility for the estates, which had been badly mismanaged in the 1820s and 1830s, the sixth duke having lost about &pound;2 million. He superintended the heavily encumbered Argyll estates' response to the great famine which began in 1846, in which year and afterwards he was with the duke of Sutherland an early and effective sponsor of assisted emigration (especially from the Ross of Mull and the island of Tiree which he owned) as an alternative to clearance by default. Eviction was used to encourage emigration in a process which became known as compulsory emigration. &#145;I wish&#146;, the duke wrote on 5 May 1851, &#145;to send out those whom we would be obliged to feed if they stayed at home; to get rid of that class is <i>the object</i>&#146;  (Devine, <span class="italic">Clanship</span>, 190). The social costs were high, but the changes resulted in the long run in a more stable estate economy. The great Campbell diaspora in North America was in part the consequence of these efforts. Argyll calculated that between 1847 and 1897 he spent over &pound;554,000 on the improvement of his estates  (<span class="italic">Autobiography</span>, 2.551). He described his policy in <span class="italic">Essay on the Commercial Principles Applicable for the Hire of Land</span>, a pamphlet for the Cobden Club (1877), and in <span class="italic">Crofts and Farms in the Hebrides</span> (1883). A notable action was his gift in 1899 of the abbey church of Iona, with other ecclesiastical buildings on the island, to the Church of Scotland.<br>
<br>Argyll played an important part in the public life of Scotland. He was chancellor of the University of St Andrews from 1851 until his death, and was rector of Glasgow University in 1854&#150;6. In 1856 he became a knight of the Thistle. He was president of the Royal Society of Edinburgh (1860&#150;64) and of the Highland and Agricultural Society of Scotland (1862&#150;6). His Liberal Unionism reflected an important tendency among the Scottish propertied classes. Even so, Argyll's influence in Scotland was less marked than might have been expected from his eminent position. He lacked Lord Rosebery's ability to associate the Scottish Liberal aristocracy with the wider culture of Scottish Liberalism and its nationalistic tendency.<br>
<br>Argyll's English contacts quickly brought visitors to Argyll. In 1847 Queen Victoria appeared unexpectedly at Inveraray by yacht and a welcome had to be swiftly manufactured. Inveraray became something of a highland political and cultural centre, though never matching Dunrobin, the Sutherlands' great house. The Argylls had five sons and seven daughters, the duchess's poor health causing her to leave much of the upbringing to the father. When in England, where the chief family house was Argyll Lodge in west London, Argyll and his family were frequently in the company of Duchess Harriet, often weekending with the Sutherlands and the Gladstones at Cliveden, where high society engaged in theological debate. At Inveraray the duke began the day punctually, for he was fussy about time, with prayers and <span class="roman">Bible</span> reading at the breakfast table. Close links with the court through Duchess Harriet were confirmed by the marriage of Argyll's eldest son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32269/', "John Douglas Sutherland Campbell, Lord Lorne")</script>, to Victoria and Albert's daughter <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/34601/', "Princess Louise")</script> in March 1871. In 1879, when Lorne was governor-general of Canada, Argyll visited him there and also made a short visit to the USA.<h2>
<a name="Houseswivesandchildren"></a>Houses, wives, and children</h2>Argyll's life was disrupted in the later 1870s. On 12 October 1877 a fire at Inveraray Castle destroyed the centre of the house. Argyll had made few alterations to the castle (and later prevented the railway reaching the adjacent town), though he had earlier considered turning Roger Morris's Gothic castle into a Scottish-baronial extravaganza. Fortunately, he did not take advantage of the fire to do so, but employed Anthony Salvin to restore the building, though adding an extra floor and high-pitched conical roofs. He suffered a further blow on 25 May 1878 by the death of the duchess, at the dinner table in London when sitting next to Gladstone. On 17 August 1881 Argyll married again; his new wife was Amelia Maria, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5550/', "Thomas Legh Claughton")</script>, bishop of St Albans, and his wife, Julia Susanna; she was the widow of Colonel Archibald Henry Augustus Anson. She died at Inveraray on 4 January 1894 and was buried at Cannes next to her first husband. Argyll's third wife was Ina Erskine (<i>d</i>. 1925), daughter of Archibald McNeill of Colonsay, whom he married on 30 July 1895. She was an extra lady of the bedchamber. Argyll's second and third marriages were childless.<br>
<br>Argyll's second and third wives brought calm to balance the disconcerting effect of two of his children's marriages. Lorne's marriage to Princess Louise was a source of some awkwardness in Argyll's relations with the queen, as Lorne and Louise soon led partially separate lives, though never formally separating. Even more problematic was the impetuous marriage in 1881 of his fifth son, <a name="cosubject_60716"></a><span class="headword">Lord Colin Campbell</span>  (1853&#150;1895), <span class="occ">city director and politician</span>, who was Liberal MP for Argyll, to Gertrude Elizabeth [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/39636/', "Campbell, Gertrude Elizabeth")</script>], daughter of Edmond Maghlin Blood. Argyll refused to recognize the engagement and handled the marriage unsympathetically. It ended in 1886 in the longest divorce case in English history, with both husband and wife petitioning the court. Argyll left the courtroom abruptly when his son was accused of having syphilis, but gave evidence for him on 6 December, clearly embarrassed and in a moral world he barely comprehended. Argyll's daughters fared more happily than those two of their brothers. Lady Edith (<i>d</i>. 1913) married the duke of Northumberland; Lady Frances married Eustace Balfour, brother of the prime minister [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30554/', "Balfour, Lady Frances")</script>]; Lady Mary Emma (<i>d</i>. 1947) married Edward Carr Glyn, bishop of Peterborough.<h2>
<a name="Argyllandscience"></a>Argyll and science</h2>Argyll had an abiding fascination with causation and morphology in nature, especially with respect to ornithology and geology, and in his later years he related his views to human society and government. His writings on science and society were characterized by a confidence which was impatient of understanding other opinions and arguments. His scientific writings, especially, became intemperate, relying increasingly on point scoring. On the island of Mull his tenant found fossilized leaves intercalated among basalt lava. Argyll announced the discovery&#151;one of considerable importance in the geological discoveries of the day&#151;to the British Association in 1850. Edward Forbes found the deposit to be of early Tertiary age. Argyll's paper to the Geological Society &#145;On Tertiary leaf-beds in the Isle of Mull&#146; in 1851 made a considerable impact, and his description influenced subsequent work in Britain on Tertiary volcanic action. Argyll was a cataclysmal geologist, believing in a primeval convulsion, and he believed that local glaciers and floating ice accounted for geological markings, rather than a general glaciation submerging the mountainous areas of Britain. This position he defended in a long series of vehement papers against evolving contemporary geological opinion. Argyll has been termed a &#145;Christian Darwinist&#146;  (Moore, 306&#150;7). He believed that there might have been several creations and, following Richard Owen, he focused on individual organisms, each of which he believed contained a &#145;plan&#146; and through which the complexities of development could be examined and understood  (ibid., 221&#150;2). He believed in a special creation of the human body and soul and argued that palaeontological evidence conclusively denied &#145;any change whatever in the specific characters of Man since the oldest Human Being was born&#146; and that &#145;all scientific evidence&#146; favoured the derivation of mankind from a &#145;single pair&#146; from which present-day humans had degenerated rather than progressively evolved (Argyll, <span class="italic">Primeval Man</span>, 1869, and <span class="italic">Unity of Nature</span>, 1884; cited in Moore, 231&#150;2). Any progress that might be perceived was planned and directed by &#145;mind&#146;. He thus denied a general and interrelated process of evolution, and clashed both with Darwin and with T. H. Huxley, emerging as one of the most combative of the defenders of the orthodoxies for the 1840s.<br>
<br>Argyll made a substantial attempt to integrate his scientific and social thought. He believed in &#145;the great natural law, which in all societies, has recognised the security of individual possession as the test of national prosperity and independence, even as it is the foundation of their organic life&#146;  (<span class="italic">Unseen Foundations</span>, 136). But this law could not be imposed, and must develop naturally, for the organic parts of society &#145;like the atoms in chemistry, are dynamic&#146;, each with its own function, fully pursuing that function only when untrammelled  (ibid., 174). Consequently, he was a strong individualist, opposing the introduction of limited liability in 1856 and still defending his opposition in the 1890s, and also continuing to deplore&#151;as in his article &#145;Christian socialising&#146;, <span class="italic">Nineteenth Century</span>, 36 (1894)&#151;any national welfare system, even in the moderate form of the nineteenth-century workhouse network. He may be seen as one of the last leading remnants of Thomas Chalmers's moral individualism.<br>
<br>Argyll's intellectual output&#151;unusual for a duke&#151;was one of the most thoroughgoing attempts of the second half of his century to defend a Christian (or at any rate deistic) individualist position. His <span class="italic">Unseen Foundations of Society: an Examination of the Fallacies and Failure of Economic Science due to Neglected Elements</span> (1893)&#151;his most substantial theoretical work&#151;was a significant attempt to link his scientific position to social and political analysis, while denigrating the limitations of the Ricardian school of political economy, which limitations he also emphasized in <span class="italic">Application of the Historical Method to Economic Science</span> (1894).<h2>
<a name="Incabinetagainresignationandfinalyears"></a>In cabinet again, resignation, and final years</h2>Argyll became lord privy seal in Gladstone's second government, formed in April 1880. Though again associated with Liberalism during the Eastern question campaign, he approached most of the policies of the government with scepticism or hostility. He disliked the idea of evolution towards radicalism, and he quarrelled with its Irish policy on historical, political, and intellectual grounds (though, unusually among the landowners hostile to Liberal proposals, he owned no land in Ireland). Since Ireland was the predominant question of the government's early years, he was soon in conflict with it, first offering his resignation on 14 June 1880 on the proposal to give compensation to a tenant for disturbance.<br>
<br>When in the autumn of 1880 Gladstone began planning the <span class="roman">Land Act</span> of 1881, Argyll began a bombardment of correspondence, especially opposing a right of &#145;free sale&#146; of land by tenants. Gladstone kept Argyll within the cabinet by encouraging him in this prolonged correspondence, but on 31 March 1881 Argyll resigned, making a statement of his reasons to the Lords on 8 April. He never again held office. Increasingly disabled by gout, which sometimes diminished, though it could not quell, his ability to write, he enjoyed emancipation from the restrictions of office and spoke and wrote much on public affairs. In 1884 he played some part as an intermediary between Gladstone and Salisbury after the Lords rejected the <span class="roman">Representation of the People Bill</span>, but he condemned the Liberal government's handling of Sudanese policy in 1884&#150;5. In 1885&#150;6 he was a vehement opponent of the Liberal cabinet's home-rule proposals, which he saw as an evil concession and a dangerous precedent, especially for Scotland. During that crisis he was sometimes thought of as a possible prime minister of a coalition government of tories and Liberal Unionists, and in July 1886 the queen considered, but quickly dropped, the notion of asking him to attempt to form a government. Argyll campaigned against home rule in print and on the platform. He developed his opinions on government and society in <span class="italic">Scotland as it Was and as it Is</span> (2 vols., 1887), <span class="italic">The New British Constitution and its Master Builders</span> (1888), and <span class="italic">Irish Nationalism: an Appeal to History</span> (1893). Ironically, his intellectual position was not greatly different from Gladstone's: their quarrel was more about means than ends.<br>
<br>Though in most respects estranged from the Liberal Party, Argyll's cautions about imperial expansion and his mistrust of Turkey&#151;repeated in <span class="italic">Our Responsibilities for Turkey: Facts and Memories of Forty Years</span> (1896)&#151;maintained some links with that party in the 1890s, and he was associated with the protests against atrocities in Armenia in 1895&#150;6. His Liberal Unionism was confined to Irish policy and opposition to government intervention. It was Salisbury, however, who granted him a further dukedom, also of Argyll, in 1892.<br>
<br>In 1897 Argyll began his autobiography, reaching 1857 by his death. It is the best autobiography by a Victorian cabinet minister. He was unable to act as one of Gladstone's pallbearers in 1898, publicly explaining that this was not the consequence of their political differences  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 27 May 1898). He continued to paint, to write poems on theological and ornithological subjects&#151;his <span class="italic">Burdens of Belief and other Poems</span> (1894) is characteristic of his later compositions&#151;and to study the habits of birds. One of his poems was included in the second series of Palgrave's <span class="italic">Golden Treasury</span>. Argyll died at Inveraray Castle on 24 April 1900 and was buried in the family grave at Kilmun on the Holy Loch. His widow, the third duchess, who died on 24 December 1925, edited his autobiography and added a biography with a thorough bibliography (2 vols., 1906) to cover the rest of a complex and interesting life, which has, unfortunately, been little studied since.<br>
