<span class="headword">Sterry,  Peter</span>  (1613&#150;1672), <span class="occ">Independent minister</span>, was born on 14 September 1613 in St Olave, Southwark, and baptized there on 19 September, the son of Anthony Sterry (1584&#150;1632), a cooper originally from Ruardean, Gloucestershire, and his wife, Julia. He probably grew up in Horsleydown Lane, Southwark, and on 21 October 1629 entered the puritan Emmanuel College at Cambridge, where he came under the influence of the Platonist Benjamin Whichcote [<i>see also </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/94274', "Cambridge Platonists")</script>]. On 15 April 1637 he was elected fellow but two years later he left Emmanuel and became a chaplain to Robert Greville, Lord Brooke, a leading member of the parliamentarian opposition. In February 1641 he married Frances Asheworth (<i>d</i>. 1682), a widow in Lord Brooke's household, with whom he had four children.<br>
<br>In May 1643 Sterry was nominated to the Westminster assembly of divines and by December he was listed by Robert Baillie, the Scottish commissioner, as one of the leading Independents in London. He developed a close association with Sir Henry Vane the younger and, along with Moses Wall, was examined on 24 January 1644 in regard to an exchange of letters between Vane and Lord Lovelace about matters relating to the &#145;public peace&#146;  (<span class="italic">Sixth Report</span>, HMC, 3). On 26 November 1645 Sterry delivered his first sermon to the House of Commons, after which he became a popular Independent preacher at St Margaret's, Westminster.<br>
<br>On 16 February 1649 Sterry was appointed preacher to the council of state and in June he was given lodgings at Whitehall. On 1 November 1649 he delivered an influential sermon in defence of the saints' millennial kingdom, and he congratulated Cromwell on the Worcester victory in a letter on 3 September 1651 and in another millenarian sermon on 5 November. Sterry was growing into a figure of authority, with enemies and supporters: in 1650 he was attacked for his millenarianism and in 1652 he was accused by the separatist David Brown of preaching a sermon despite the presence of a naked woman among the congregation; a year later he was praised by the Fifth Monarchist John Rogers and by the Welsh writer William Erbury. He was consulted on political and religious matters from as far away as Wales and Scotland by Morgan Llwyd and Colonel John Jones between June 1651 and September 1656: they queried him on Jakob Boehme, the Ranters, the Rosicrucians, and the &#145;present Power&#146;. In 1654 Sterry was nominated to the board of commissioners, the &#145;triers&#146;, which Cromwell had set up to ensure political and religious conformity among preachers, and in September he started preaching at Whitehall on a fortnightly basis. In December 1655 he was appointed to negotiate with Menasseh ben Israel over the readmission of the Jews to England and in January 1656 he was appointed to a committee headed by Richard Cromwell to help the distressed protestants in Piedmont.<br>
<br>Despite becoming a powerful member in Cromwell's inner circle, Sterry still cared for the lesser people: in March 1654 he gave a certificate of good conduct to the porter at Whitehall and another to Robert Mossom, who had been sequestered, testifying &#145;to his good conduct as a schoolmaster&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1655&#150;6</i>, 134). He continued to be so closely associated with Cromwell that upon the latter's death he was reported to have said that Cromwell was at &#145;the right hand of Jesus Christ, there to intercede for us, and to be mindful of us on all occasions&#146;  (<span class="italic">Memoirs of Edmund Ludlow</span>, 2.45)&#151;a statement that led his detractors to describe him as &#145;a cringing Court-chaplain&#146;  (<span class="italic">A Second Narrative</span>, 42).<br>
<br>On 1 January 1660 Sterry preached his last sermon at Whitehall. After the Restoration he went into hiding in Ironmonger Lane in Southwark. On 9 November 1660 he received a pardon from the king, and began serving as chaplain to Philip Sidney, Viscount Lisle, at West Sheen near Richmond. Although his days of political influence were over, Sterry transformed his experience of defeat into intellectual and devotional productivity. At West Sheen he started the Lovely Society, a close-knit group consisting of his wife, Frances, and their children Frances, Joseph Lee, Peter, and Gratiana, along with Lord Lisle's family and some pupils. This society was described in <span class="italic">Alumni Cantabrigienses</span> as a &#145;conventicle&#146;, but it was actually modelled on Honor&eacute; D'Urf&eacute;'s druidic community in <span class="italic">Astrea</span> (3 vols., 1657&#150;8). Sterry instructed pupils in proper writing, and wrote letters, devotions, poems (including the first English poem on the druids), and allegorical treatises. His work is strikingly free of polemic against the ruling power and shows the influence of figures as different as Henry More and George Herbert, Boethius and Ficino, Titian and Van Dyck, and Ralph Cudworth and John Milton, whom he had known as early as 1650.<br>
<br>A nonconformist during the great persecution, Sterry could preach only to small communities in 1666; in 1663 he had a residence at Chelsea where he kept part of his library, and in 1668 he was at Hackney, where the returns of conventicles compiled by Bishop Henchman included his name, along with those of his former associates John Owen and Thomas Goodwin. Summaries of two sermons preached in March and May 1670, in the wake of the second <span class="roman">Conventicle Act</span>, were published by a member of his flock and show Sterry's adoption of the doctrine of realized eschatology (possibly under the influence of the Quakers). Here he rejected his earlier belief in establishing the kingdom of God through militaristic means and in a futuristic worldly context in preference to its realization in the souls of the saints enduring the Anglican persecution. After the declaration of indulgence in March 1672, Sterry applied for licences to preach in Hackney, Little St Helen's, Bishopsgate, and Berkhamsted. Upon falling ill in May, however, he began dictating to his daughter Frances a verse rendering of the canticles and, with John Donne in mind, a treatise on the <i>ars moriendi</i>, &#145;The state of a saints body and soul in death&#146;. He died in the parish of St Helen's on 19 November 1672 and was buried on the 24th in the chancel of St Helen, Bishopsgate.<br>
<br>Sterry's works were published posthumously by his friends in 1675, 1683, and 1710. His manuscripts also circulated widely, as the records kept by his son Joseph Lee show. A few months after the publication of <span class="italic">Discourse of the Freedom of the Will</span> (1675), Richard Baxter attacked Sterry's determinist fallacy: &#145;overlooking and undervaluing God's Design in Making and Governing free Intellectual agents, by his Sapiential Moral Directive Way&#146;  (W. Lamont, <span class="italic">Puritanism and Historical Controversy</span>, 1996, 168), but an anonymous writer immediately came to Sterry's defence, with &#145;a candid Testimony to Mr. Sterryes learned and accurate Discourse&#146;  (<span class="italic">A Letter Found in Utopia</span>, 1675, 1). He was still admired in 1712 when Jeremiah White, the editor of the last posthumous publication, mentioned how he still spoke to his admirers &#145;tho' he be dead&#146;  (White, 201). Sterry's unpublished writings remain in manuscript at Emmanuel College Library, Cambridge, and although no likeness has survived, there is a fine 1884 stained glass window of him in the Emmanuel College Wren chapel.<br>

<a name="cosubject_26415"></a><span class="headword">Nathaniel Sterry</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1698), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, Peter's younger brother, entered Emmanuel College on 19 July 1644. A Cromwellian supporter, in 1649 he was appointed a fellow of Merton College, Oxford, where he wrote &#145;Direction for a good &amp; profitable proceeding in study by Mr. N. Sterry E. C.&#146;, in which he encouraged students to read Edmund Spenser and Samuel Daniel to perfect their &#145;mother tongue&#146;  (Pinto, 49n.). He proceeded MA on 31 May 1651, and in December gave the congratulatory oration at the appointment of Jonathan Goddard as warden of the college. He worked closely with his brother during the protectorate, for which he was paid the sum of &pound;100 in August 1658. After the Restoration he conformed to the new religious settlement and was appointed rector of Stuston, Suffolk, in 1662. In the same year he received a pass to take two of Sir Thomas Liddel's children on the grand tour of Europe. With the support of Archbishop Sheldon he became dean of Bocking, Essex, in 1674 and proceeded BD on 24 March 1675. He remained unmarried until his death on 10 November 1698 in Bocking.<br>
