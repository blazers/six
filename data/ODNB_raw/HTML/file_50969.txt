</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Devlin,  Patrick Arthur</span>, Baron Devlin  (1905&#150;1992), <span class="occ">judge and legal philosopher</span>, was born at Chislehurst, Kent, on 25 November 1905, the eldest of three sons and second of five children of William John Devlin (<i>d</i>. 1932), architect, and his wife, Frances Evelyn (Fanny), <i>n&eacute;e</i> Crombie. His father, William, came from a Catholic family from co. Tyrone in Ulster but had left Ireland for London to train as an architect. His mother, Frances, was a member of a wealthy Aberdeen family of cloth manufacturers who were protestants. His father's practice did not prosper and in 1909 the family moved from Chislehurst to Aberdeen where Devlin's mother had many relatives and where his father, as the only Catholic architect, might hope to improve his earnings. The hope was disappointed but, with his Crombie relatives, Devlin had a happy childhood. He and his siblings were brought up as Catholics. His brother Christopher (1907&#150;1961) subsequently became a Jesuit priest and writer, and his two sisters, Joan (<i>b</i>. 1904) and Frances (1909&#150;1941), became nuns; his youngest brother, William (1911&#150;1987), was a Shakespearian actor.<h2>
<a name="Educationandcareeratthebar"></a>Education and career at the bar</h2>Devlin was sent to school at Stonyhurst College (1914&#150;22). He did not excel academically but he learned to speak clearly and enjoyed debating, for which he won a joint first prize. He left school early to join the Dominican order as a novice, but after a year abandoned the idea. His enquiring mind had developed a distaste for unthinking acceptance of dogma. Subsidized by his uncle George Crombie he went instead to Christ's College, Cambridge (1923&#150;7). There his talent for debating flowered. He represented the university on a debating tour of the American middle west in 1925 and became president of the Cambridge Union in 1926. With striking red hair and a clear, resonant voice, he possessed both wit and charm. He made some good friends, notably the Butlers (R. A. and Sir Geoffrey) and Arthur Goodhart. He read first history and then law, in both of which he acquired a lifelong interest. His mind was not however attuned to examinations. Their unpredictable questions left no time for serious thought, and he was twice placed in the second half of the second class. All his life he needed time for reflection. He ceased at Cambridge to be a practising Catholic, though his cast of mind continued in the Jesuit mould.<br>
<br>In 1925 Devlin committed himself to a career at the bar but, as it was a choice not a vocation, he did not mean to let it prevent his enjoying life. Enjoyment meant not idleness, which he dreaded, but a life of occupation and congenial work that allowed for the pursuit of virtue. The virtue he preferred to pursue, if he had to choose between compassion and justice, was justice, &#145;the root of which is a love of the order that moves the universe&#146;  (P. Devlin, <span class="italic">Taken at the Flood</span>, 74). The &#145;planetary pleasures&#146;, high among which he ranked good wine, contributed to enjoyment but for them money was needed. &pound;400 a year was the figure he aimed at when starting at the bar, and with the generous help of Uncle George and Arthur Goodhart, whom he helped with editing the <span class="italic">Law Quarterly Review</span>, he managed to secure it. He joined Gray's Inn in 1927 and took lodgings first in Half Moon Street, Mayfair, then at the Savile Club, the centre more of a literary than a legal circle. In 1928 he was marshal to Mr Justice Charles on the northern circuit. He passed the bar examination in 1929. His pupillages with Cartwright Sharp and St John Field did not lead to many briefs, but he soon had the good luck to be interviewed by William Jowitt, the Labour attorney-general, with a view to becoming his devil. At the end of the interview &#145;with my hand on the door handle I turned around and said that I was very keen to get the job&#146;  (ibid., 104). He was taken on and worked for Jowitt while he was attorney-general from 1929 to 1931 and later shared his chambers when in 1932 Jowitt returned to private practice. In the meantime Devlin had become known as junior counsel for the prosecution in the Annie Hearn case, a <i>cause c&eacute;l&egrave;bre</i> of murder by poisoning tried in 1931. His career was however solidly established only after a commercial brief in 1935, for which he was chosen because, of the juniors in practice at the time, his name sounded most Irish. He took the chance, which led to a good deal of work for Shell, and soon became a leading commercial lawyer. &#145;Luck at the bar is opportunity. It is a try that can be converted into a goal&#146;  (ibid., 160).<br>
<br>Devlin had already, on 12 February 1932, married Madeleine Hilda Oppenheimer (1909&#150;2012), younger daughter of Sir Bernard Oppenheimer, the diamond magnate. They had six children, four boys and twin girls, and, in due course, dozens of grandchildren. His wife and all six children became Catholic converts. His family life was notably happy. What with that and his powerful intellect, he was largely able to brush off the criticism that he later attracted.<br>
<br>By the outbreak of the Second World War, Devlin had a lucrative commercial practice. From 1931 to 1939 he was prosecuting counsel to the mint. During the war he served as junior counsel to the ministries of War, Transport, Food, and Supply, and in the legal department of the Ministry of Supply (1940&#150;45). He took silk in 1945, was attorney-general for the duchy of Cornwall in 1947&#150;8, and became a master of Gray's Inn in 1947. But he did not practise as senior counsel for long. Jowitt, now lord chancellor, appointed him a judge in the King's Bench Division in October 1948 at the age of forty-two. He was the second youngest person to be appointed to the High Court bench in the twentieth century. The appointment was not political, for Devlin was not a Labour supporter. He was conservative by temperament. But like Lord Goddard, a friend and admirer, he would not tolerate injustice, and was often critical of the legal establishment. He was knighted in 1948.<h2>
<a name="Devlinasajudge"></a>Devlin as a judge</h2>As a judge Devlin soon established himself as a sound commercial and maritime lawyer. He became a successful president of the restrictive practices court from its creation in 1956 until 1960. He did not share the reservations of those who thought that the work of the court would involve too much economic and political controversy. In this he turned out to be correct. Unlike Lord Denning, Devlin did not regard it as the judge's duty to bring the law into line with contemporary views of justice. That role was for parliament and the jury. The judge should analyse the law carefully and administer it as it stood.<br>
<br>Devlin also made a mark, unexpectedly, as a judge in criminal cases. He was prepared to probe the principles underlying criminal law with a rare insight and attention to detail. As an assize judge in 1949 he gave a direction to the jury on the law of provocation that was much admired. In 1957 he tried Bodkin Adams, an Eastbourne doctor who was popularly supposed to have murdered up to 400 elderly patients from whom he expected legacies. The charge was confined to one alleged murder, supposedly the one best supported by the evidence. The evidence unearthed by the defence, however, weakened the prosecution case. On Devlin's direction, which drew a distinction between alleviating pain and deliberately cutting short life, the jury acquitted the bumbling doctor. Thirty years later, when the persons concerned were all dead, Devlin wrote a brilliant account of the trial in <span class="italic">Easing the Passing</span> (1985). In it he lambasted the prosecutor, Sir Reginald Manningham-Buller, attorney-general at the time of the trial and later lord chancellor, as clumsy, stupid, and perverse. Devlin was not throwing doubt on the jury's verdict, though in his view Bodkin Adams was probably a mercy killer greedy for legacies. He was criticized for expressing this view of Dr Adams, but he combined respect for the due process of law with a zeal for truth, even harsh truths.<br>
<br>After the trial Devlin and Manningham-Buller were both regarded as candidates for the vacant post of lord chief justice, to which in the event neither was appointed. Two years later, in 1959, Devlin was chairman of a commission of inquiry into the declaration by the governor of a state of emergency in Nyasaland. The commission concluded that there were grounds for declaring the state of emergency but that the supposed plot by Dr Hastings Banda and others to murder the governor, his officials, and all the Europeans in Nyasaland was a figment of an informer's imagination. Manningham-Buller ridiculed this conclusion in a speech, much applauded, in the House of Commons. The statement in the commission's report that Nyasaland was &#145;a police state, no doubt temporarily&#146; was true but caused offence in governing circles. But despite what Devlin, tongue-in-cheek, referred to as his &#145;incompetence in finding the elementary facts&#146;  (Devlin, <span class="italic">Easing the Passing</span>, 191) the prime minister promoted him to the Court of Appeal in 1960 and the House of Lords (as Baron Devlin of West Wick) in 1961.<br>
<br>Devlin was not happy as an appellate judge. He found the work dreary and was frustrated by the time-wasting procedures and lack of office and secretarial facilities for appeal judges, especially in the House of Lords. The United States supreme court seemed to him more effectively organized. He gave some interesting judgments, taking the view that the civil law of torts should only rarely be used to punish a defendant who had deliberately behaved badly, but that it could properly be used to give remedies for economic as well as physical losses. He did not have time to make the sort of impact on the law made by his contemporary Denning. Whether, as many thought, he would have made a great mark had he held the office of lord chief justice or master of the rolls can only be surmised. The incumbents staying on longer than expected, he was not appointed to either post and, after fifteen years on the bench, he resigned in 1964 at the early age of fifty-eight.<h2>
<a name="Devlinasawriter"></a>Devlin as a writer</h2>After his resignation Devlin secured interesting and lucrative work as an arbitrator. He was also judge of the administrative tribunal of the International Labour Office (ILO) in Geneva from 1964 to 1986 and greatly enjoyed his visits there. From 1969 to 1971 he chaired the ILO inquiry into freedom of association in Greece. From 1964 to 1969 he was the first non-journalist chairman of the Press Council and in that capacity was diplomatic enough to establish easy relations with the press. He sat as chairman of the Wiltshire quarter sessions from 1957 until 1971, his informal manner, free from any hint of the pompous, being much appreciated. But he resisted attempts to lure him back to the judiciary.<br>
<br>Instead the latter part of Devlin's career was devoted mainly to writing about law and history, which he now saw as not only a pleasure but a duty. He had the knack of presenting a closely reasoned and professionally accurate argument in a form that was intelligible and of interest to non-lawyers. Many of his lectures and addresses were published in <span class="italic">Samples of Lawmaking</span> (1962), <span class="italic">The Enforcement of Morals</span> (1965), and <span class="italic">The Judge</span> (1979). Keenly interested in the relation between law and morals, he saw the criminal jury as the body with the power, though not the right, to refuse to apply laws that were politically oppressive or that the ordinary person found unjust, for instance the law of bigamy as it applied to those who could not afford a divorce. Only in this way could criminal justice take account not merely of the law but of the merits of a case. Devlin first expounded this theme in his incisive Hamlyn lectures, <span class="italic">Trial by Jury</span> (1956). He elaborated it in later works, right up to an article, &#145;The conscience of the jury&#146;, published in the <span class="italic">Law Quarterly Review</span> in 1991. It was not that he thought juries particularly shrewd, except in deciding who was telling the truth. But judges, having conferred on juries the power to decide guilt or innocence, should respect that power. He therefore criticized decisions of the Court of Appeal and the House of Lords in which judges, when new evidence had come to light after a conviction, took it on themselves to decide its cogency without referring it to a jury.<br>
<br>This was one reason why Devlin joined Ludovic Kennedy, Lord Scarman, Basil Hume, and others in campaigns to secure a further review of the convictions first in the Luton post office murder trial (<i>R. v. Cooper and McMahon</i>, 1969), then in that of the Guildford four, convicted in 1975. The Guildford case arose from an IRA bombing in which the police arrested and forced confessions from four innocent people, though by the time of the appeal in 1977 it was known who had in fact carried out the bombing and how. The campaigns were in the end successful and the convictions were quashed, those of the Guildford four in 1989. Despite increasing deafness, Devlin continued to campaign for a review of some other dubious convictions that undermined respect for English criminal justice. In the upshot an independent body was set up to review convictions that were alleged in the light of new evidence to be wrongful.<br>
<br>Devlin's interest in the relation of law to morality led to a famous controversy with <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/51089/', "Professor Herbert Hart")</script>. The context was the recommendation of the Wolfenden committee in 1957 that homosexuality between consenting adults should cease to be criminal. Devlin favoured a modest degree of reform, but in his Maccabaean lecture of 1959 was driven to dig deeper. He argued that the ordinary person's sense of what was morally unacceptable was not valuable merely in inducing juries to frustrate the enforcement of bad laws. If sufficiently strong, popular morality could justify making conduct a criminal offence. It was not true, as Wolfenden had argued, that there was a sphere of private morality into which the criminal law should not enter. Devlin's argument, as he later discovered, was along lines similar to that advanced by a previous judge, Fitzjames Stephen, in <span class="italic">Liberty, Equality, Fraternity</span> (1873). Though Devlin clearly had in mind the sort of sub-Christian morality that prevailed in Britain at the time, his argument was open to the objection that it appeared to justify the enforcement of any morality strongly supported by public opinion, however corrupt&#151;for example that of the Nazis. Hart, in reply, renewed a theme developed by John Stuart Mill, arguing that only the avoidance of harm to others could justify making conduct criminal. He failed, however, to explain satisfactorily how differences of opinion about what was harmful could be resolved, and how far the state was justified in preventing vulnerable people from harming themselves. The debate, though inconclusive, was conducted at a high level of eloquence and has been educative to generations of students. Devlin revised and extended his views on the subject in <span class="italic">The Enforcement of Morals</span> (1965).<h2>
<a name="Oldage"></a>Old age</h2>In retirement Devlin lived at West Wick House and Farm in Pewsey, Wiltshire, which he had bought in 1943. He also had a property in the Algarve in Portugal. He now had more time to think. One of the topics he thought about more deeply was the personality of Woodrow Wilson, in whom he had become interested during the debating tour of America in 1925. In <span class="italic">Too Proud to Fight</span> (1974), a patient and well-marshalled but over-long book, he concluded that Wilson entered the war in 1917, despite having just been re-elected on a policy of neutrality, in order to have a dominating place at the peace conference that would follow when the war was won.<br>
<br>In recognition of his status as a writer on law Devlin was made a fellow of the British Academy in 1963. Between 1962 and 1980 he received honorary degrees from the universities of Glasgow, Toronto, Oxford, Cambridge, Leicester, Sussex, Durham, Liverpool, and St Louis, Missouri. He was high steward of Cambridge University from 1966 to 1991. Though increasingly deaf, he continued to help the campaign against the unjust convictions of supposed terrorists, such as the Maguire seven. In 1988 he began a fascinating autobiography, <span class="italic">Taken at the Flood</span> (1996), which was aimed at budding lawyers and which he carried, as intended, up to 1935, the year in which his practice became firmly established. Of medium height and latterly with a stoop, he was not physically a commanding figure. But his charm, sense of humour, and informality endeared him to people of all sorts. He enjoyed life and brought enjoyment to others. When near death he asked after careful reflection to see a priest. He died peacefully at West Wick on 9 August 1992, fortified by the rites of the Catholic church, and was buried in Pewsey cemetery on 11 August. He was survived by his wife and six children. A memorial mass was held at St James's, Spanish Place, on 28 October 1992.<br>
<br>Devlin was a complex character. His rigorous conscience and eloquence made him a thoughtful and effective enemy of untruth and injustice. At the same time he admired and skilfully defended the common-law tradition of organic growth, even if it involved tolerating anomalies. He and Denning, also appointed to the bench in his early forties by Lord Chancellor Jowitt, combined judicial and juristic work in a way that had no parallel among English judges since the time of James Fitzjames Stephen. If Denning was the more influential judge, Devlin was the more powerful writer, indeed the most impressive produced by the English bench in the twentieth century.<br>
