<span class="headword">Townsend <span class="st"> [Townshend]</span>,  Horace <span class="st"> [Horatio]</span></span>  (1750&#150;1837), <span class="occ">writer and Church of Ireland clergyman</span>, was born in Ross Carbery, co. Cork on 5 November 1750, the fourth (and youngest surviving) of the seven sons of Philip Townshend (1700&#150;1786) of Derry, Ross Carbery, co. Cork, army officer, and Elizabeth, daughter of Thomas Hungerford, of The Island, Co. Cork. He entered Trinity College, Dublin, in 1765. He graduated BA in 1770 and MA in 1776. He was incorporated at Magdalen College, Oxford, on 15 April 1776. Townsend was ordained deacon by the bishop of Cork on 21 September 1770, and priest on 29 September 1770. He immediately became curate of Abbeystrewry in the diocese of Ross. In 1780 he moved to become vicar of St Michael's, Cork, and curate of Carrigaline. In May 1785 he married Helena Meade (1760&#150;1786), fourth daughter of Robert Meade, of Ballintober, co. Cork, rector of Dunderrow. They had one daughter. Following his first wife's death, in October 1787 Townsend married Katherine Corker (<i>d</i>. 1811), daugher of Chambre Corker, of Lota, co. Cork, archdeacon of Ardagh. They had thirteen children, of whom three sons and eight daughters survived to adulthood.<br>
<br>Townsend supported his family in part through the accumulation of livings. While he retained his posts at Cork and Carrigaline, he was rector of Dungavney from 1785 to 1786, vicar of Kilgariff and Desert from 1786 to 1829, and vicar of Kilkerranmore and Castleventry from 1786 to 1837. He was also employed as a tutor, and subsequently as an agent, by Richard Boyle second earl of Shannon, who installed him as sovereign of Clonakilty, co. Cork, and gave him the use of a house at Courtmacsherry in 1786. There he gained practical experience of agricultural improvement. In 1803 he gave up the living of St Michael's, Cork, on becoming rector of Carrigaline.<br>
<br>Townsend is reported to have taken his clerical duties seriously, combining a sense of humour with a benevolence that won him the description &#145;Friend of the poor&#146;  (Townsend, 259). His speech from the pulpit in the Roman Catholic church at Clonakilty on 24 June 1798 was credited by his descendant Richard Baxter Townshend with having averted a rising in the district, but it has also been presented more accurately as an &#145;eloquent condemnation&#146; of the rising following its defeat. Townsend urged the Catholic congregation to accept that they should have no role in the government of their country, and to &#145;Reflect with remorse on the sanguinary designs for which you forged so many abominable pikes&#146;  (Tuip&eacute;ar).<br>
<br>Townsend was a writer of some local fame, not to say notoriety. He wrote much verse and occasional articles for <span class="italic">Blackwood's Magazine</span> under the name Senex, and for <span class="italic">Bolster's Cork Magazine</span> between 1828 and 1831. His most famous publication was <span class="italic">A Statistical Survey of the County of Cork, with Observations on the Means for Improvement</span> (1810). The work was drawn up under the auspices of the Dublin Society. It was not a quantitative survey, but a prose description of the county. Townsend systematically described the geology, physical geography, inhabitants, antiquities, and the state of the church and agriculture in the first part of the book, following it with a topographical description barony by barony. Finally came addenda which were lists of miscellaneous items such as observations on bees and eggs.<br>
<br>Townsend in his <span class="italic">Survey</span> proved a systematic and industrious compiler and could show sympathy towards those whom he observed. He found the local people engaging in some respects and could describe them wittily, comparing for example Englishmen in an inn who would barely exchange one word over their drink with a similar gathering of Irishmen where &#145;the difficulty is to find a listener&#146;  (p. 75). He also wrote sympathetically about the alleged thievish tendencies of the Irish, ascribing these largely to poverty. He perceptively observed that underemployment stemmed from overpopulation in Irish rural districts, and identified the ease with which potatoes could provide for a family as the key to early marriage and further population growth in such districts.<br>
<br>Townsend's survey did, however, show the conventional prejudices of his class and time. In comparing English and Irish peasantry, he proclaimed &#145;the superiority of the English in cleanliness, decorum, the order and decencies of life&#146;  (p. 74). He described the violent attacks among Irish peasants and attributed them to the persistence of their ancient tribal quarrels. What the <span class="italic">Survey</span> became most immediately known for, however, was its comment, repeated in the second edition of the work, entitled <span class="italic">A General and Statistical Survey of the County of Cork</span> (1815), on the state of the Roman Catholic clergy in the county. His remarks, particularly criticisms of the clergy's role in education, led to a bitter and protracted correspondence with the Dublin Society and in the Cork press. Townsend's anti-Catholicism became manifest also in his <span class="italic">Observations on the Catholic Claims</span> (1812), in which he argued against Catholic emancipation chiefly on the grounds that Roman Catholics were claiming a right to freedom of conscience which they denied their own members. While such arguments dominated the immediate and local reception of his work, later readers have valued his detailed and often perceptive descriptions of the county, not least because his was one of the earliest such surveys in Ireland. In 1810 or after Townsend and his second brother, Thomas (<i>b</i>. 1737), bought the family property at Derry from his eldest brother, Richard (1733&#150;1817), where he built a new house. His sight was impaired in later life following an accidental explosion. Townsend died on 26 March 1837 and was buried in St Fachtna's Church, Ross Carbery, where he is commemorated by a memorial in the form of a relief of the Good Samaritan by the noted sculptor Thomas Kirk.<br>
