<span class="headword">Kingscote,  Henry Robert</span>  (1802&#150;1882), <span class="occ">philanthropist</span>, was born on 25 May 1802, the second son of Thomas Kingscote (<i>d</i>. 1811), the brother of Robert Kingscote of Kingscote, Gloucestershire; his mother was Harriet, the third daughter of Sir Henry Peyton of Doddington in the same county. He was educated at Harrow School, and early became a cricketer and rider to hounds. Six feet five inches tall, he played his first match at Lord's on 21 May 1823. President of the MCC for 1827, he initiated a three-match series between Sussex&#151;whose bowlers used the controversial round-arm style denounced by its opponents as &#145;throwing&#146;&#151;and &#145;All England&#146;, which aroused much interest.<br>
<br>A narrow escape from drowning, probably in the late 1820s, apparently led to his conversion. An evangelical, he became a friend of Bishop Charles Blomfield, and with him was instrumental in founding the Church of England Scripture Readers' Association and the Metropolitan Visiting and Relief Association, of which he was a trustee all his life. He munificently assisted St Matthias, Bethnal Green. In 1846 he published <span class="italic">A Letter to &hellip; the Archbishop of Canterbury on the Present Wants of the Church</span>, which ran through several editions. In it he urged the extension of lay agency and the foundation of new bishoprics.<br>
<br>A leading and generous London evangelical, in 1846 Kingscote helped to found the Southwark Fund for schools and churches, and in 1847 he assisted in alleviating the distress of the famine in Ireland. He sent out supplies to the troops during the Crimean War. In 1868 he was one of the founders of the British and Colonial Emigration Society; he was also the founder of the scheme for establishing workshops for the indigent blind, which was not very successful, and of the National Orphan Asylum at Ham Common, Surrey, in 1849.<br>
<br>Kingscote married, on 11 July 1833, Harriet Elizabeth Tower of Weald Hall, Essex; they had three sons and five daughters. Harriet died on 10 March 1875. Kingscote died on 13 July 1882 at his home, 10 Seville Street, Lowndes Square, London.<br>
