<span class="headword">Fairbairn,  (William) Ronald Dodds</span>  (1889&#150;1964), <span class="occ">psychiatrist and psychoanalyst</span>, was born on 11 August 1889 at the Red House, Cluny Gardens, Edinburgh, the only child of Thomas Fairbairn (1854&#150;1925), chartered surveyor and secretary of the Edinburgh Architectural Association, and Cecilia Leefe (1854&#150;1946). Ronald Fairbairn lived in Edinburgh all his life except for periods as a student and while on foreign service during the First World War. His whole school career was passed at Merchiston Castle School in Edinburgh. He wanted to go on to Oxford University but his father forbade this as offering too much opportunity for wickedness, and thus from 1907 he read mental philosophy at Edinburgh, obtaining his MA in 1911. From 1911 to 1914 he took courses in divinity and Hellenic studies in Manchester, London, Kiel, and Strasbourg and entered theological college in Edinburgh. Fairbairn joined the Royal Garrison Artillery as a territorial in 1915 and was posted abroad in 1916, serving in Egypt and Palestine. He had visited Craiglockhart, near Edinburgh, in 1915, where W. H. R. Rivers was pioneering psychotherapeutic work with shell-shock victims, and by the time that he was demobilized he had decided to become a psychotherapist. At that time most of the senior psychoanalysts were medically qualified, and so Fairbairn began his training by undertaking accelerated medical (1919&#150;23; MB ChB) and then psychiatric (diploma in psychiatry) qualifications at Edinburgh University. An essential element in psychoanalytic training involved having a personal analysis, and Fairbairn went into treatment in 1921 with E. H. Connell. After qualification Fairbairn became assistant physician, Royal Edinburgh Hospital For Mental Diseases (1923&#150;4). He had begun an MD on &#145;The relationship of dissociation and repression, considered from the point of view of medical psychology&#146; immediately after qualification as a doctor but did not submit it until March 1929 when the examiners highly commended it. Between 1926 and 1931 Fairbairn was assistant physician at the Longmore Hospital, Edinburgh.<br>
<br>Fairbairn married Mary Ann More Gordon (1901&#150;1952), daughter of Harry More Gordon, in 1926 and in 1927 became a lecturer in psychology in the department of philosophy at the University of Edinburgh. The first of the Fairbairns' children, Ellinor, was born in 1927 and the following year twins were born who did not survive. Their loss of the twins may have been the trigger for the breakdown in the mental and physical health of Mary Fairbairn, which cast a shadow over the remainder of the Fairbairns' marriage. The birth of their fourth child occurred in 1929, the same year that Fairbairn's ideas on &#145;The cause of mental disease&#146; appeared in the <span class="italic">British Medical Journal</span>. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/58533/', "Sir Nicholas Hardwick Fairbairn (1933&#150;1995)")</script>, barrister and MP, was their fifth child. In 1928 Fairbairn had given a paper to the Scottish branch of the British Psychological Society entitled &#145;Notes on the religious phantasies of a female patient&#146;, which described the madness, invalidism, and, ultimately, the death of one of his patients, and expressed a concern with unsatisfiable longing which was to be a cornerstone of his psychological theory subsequently. Between 1929 and 1934 Fairbairn was medical psychologist to the Jordanburn Nerve Hospital, Edinburgh, and Edinburgh University Psychological Clinic for Children. He was elected to associate membership of the British Psycho-Analytic Society in 1931 and to full membership a few years later. In 1931 and 1932 he was lecturer in psychology at Edinburgh University. Preparing lectures for psychology students, being an active member of interdisciplinary meetings, and his own critical reading of Freud prevented him from becoming too immersed in psychoanalysis. His election to fellow of the Royal Anthropological Institute in 1932 reflected these wider interests.<br>
<br>Fairbairn enjoyed the company of children, and a significant part of his early clinical work was with them. He wrote a number of papers on education and on the effects of childhood sexual abuse. Despite this work becoming well known Fairbairn did not publish it, and these writings did not become widely available until the publication of two volumes of Fairbairn's work in an edition by D. Scharff and Fairbairn's daughter, Ellinor Fairbairn Birtles, in 1994. Fairbairn also had a considerable sympathy for people who cannot engage with others, or commit themselves emotionally. He applied to them the term that had become fashionable in Germany&#151;schizoid&#151;but unlike the German psychiatrists, who considered schizoidia an inborn temperament, Fairbairn thought that it was forced on a person by the conflict between desire for another person (prototypically the mother) and that person's constantly frustrating response to the desire. In &#145;The libido theory: the theory of the pleasure principle interpreted in terms of appetite&#146;, written in 1930 but first published in 1994, Fairbairn drew on the work of the social psychologist James Drever, and William McDougall, and proposed that Freud's assertion that behaviour is motivated by sexual and death instincts should be replaced by appetitive tendencies, which are triggered by needs such as hunger, and reactive tendencies, which are stirred by object-interest. The failure of these tendencies to remove what caused them leads to feelings which are characteristic of the tendency and which themselves function like appetites. A loving tendency, if it does not meet a loving response from its object, becomes an appetitive tendency of frustration or sorrow. Objects are usually important others, but may be animals, things, or institutions: indeed anything which a person might think can provide them with what they need or want. Fairbairn's emphasis on the importance of social relationships involving objects marked a turning point in psychoanalysis. It was, however, Melanie Klein, and not Fairbairn, who developed object-relations theory and Fairbairn's only acknowledged contribution is the inclusion by Klein of &#145;schizoid&#146; in her characterization of the infant's early relationship to its carer, the &#145;paranoid-schizoid&#146; position.<br>
<br>Fairbairn's classic papers, &#145;A revised psychopathology of the psychoses and psychoneuroses&#146; (1940) and &#145;Endopsychic structure considered in terms of object-relationships&#146; (1941), were both published in the <span class="italic">International Journal of Psychoanalysis</span>. Although they made his reputation, they also show imprints of Fairbairn's long incubation with Kleinian ideas. Earlier themes recur, but in a more formal, orthodox formulation, lacking the vigour of the earlier unpublished work. Fairbairn became disenchanted by psychoanalysis towards the end of his life. He felt able to reduce his own theory to a single page of principles for the <span class="italic">British Journal of Medical Psychology</span> in 1963, and his correspondence with up-and-coming psychoanalysts at the end of his career indicates a pessimism about the approach and development of psychoanalysis.<br>
<br>Mary Fairbairn died, after many years of ill health, on 28 September 1952, a year that also saw the publication of Fairbairn's collected papers, <span class="italic">Psychoanalytic Studies of the Personality</span>. Fairbairn's personal life took on a new dimension when he began a relationship with Marion Frances Mackintosh (1907&#150;1995), daughter of Captain H. E. M. Archer. Fairbairn married Marion, who had become his secretary, in April 1959, but was in failing health and from 1960 had a series of attacks, the first on the day of Melanie Klein's funeral, which were associated with a decline in his mental and physical health. Fairbairn died on 31 December 1964 at 19 Drumsheugh Gardens, Edinburgh. He was buried in Dean cemetery, Edinburgh, after a service in St Mary's Cathedral. He was survived by his second wife.<br>
<br>Since his death Fairbairn's work has found a new relevance, and its influence has been particularly strong on the theory of highly disturbed or &#145;borderline&#146; patients. Fairbairn would sometimes recall an occasion when, as a young child, he had begged a young girl to come to play but, when she finally acceded to his request, she had been knocked down and killed as she crossed the road to his house. Whether or not Fairbairn was personally preoccupied with the perils of needs and longings, his single most important theoretical contribution is his precise delineation of the allure, the struggles to reject, and the impossibility of giving up the object of desire whose recognition must be bought at a price of guilt, fear, jealousy, or shame.<br>
