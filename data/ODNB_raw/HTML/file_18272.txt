<span class="headword">Mason,  George Heming</span>  (1818&#150;1872), <span class="occ">landscape painter</span>, the son of George Miles Mason and his wife, Eliza Heming, was born on 11 March 1818 at Fenton Park, near Stoke-on-Trent. The Mason family, whose fortune derived from the invention and manufacture of Mason's ironware china, later lived at Wetley Abbey, a large Gothic house between Stoke and Leek, built in the 1820s. Mason was educated at Anderton's school in Newcastle under Lyme. Mason seems to have inherited an interest in literature and the arts from his father, but, despite this, when he left school he was articled to William Royden Watts, a surgeon in Birmingham. In 1843, however, he gave up his medical training to travel in Europe and to study art. Travelling with his brother Frederick Miles, George Mason visited France and Switzerland and eventually arrived in Rome in 1845. In due course, the two brothers joined in the patriotic campaign to free Rome from foreign control; in 1848 Frederick Miles Mason joined the Roman legion, and served in the military campaign against the Austrians, while George tended the wounded during the siege of Rome by the French in 1849.<br>
<br>When George Mason first lived in Italy he found time to explore Rome and the surrounding countryside. However, a financial crisis at home meant that remittances were stopped and for a period Mason suffered dire poverty. He seems to have turned to painting in earnest as a means of supporting himself. Gradually he gained the support of a circle of English visitors to Rome, including fellow Staffordshire man David Watts Russell, and of William Cornwallis Cartwright (later a Liberal MP) with whom, in 1851, Mason explored the Sabine hills. Mason met the Italian painter Giovanni Costa at Ariccia in 1852, when Costa was lying low from the papal authorities following the suppression of the patriotic uprising, in which he had played a part. Costa and Mason made painting expeditions into the Roman campagna, and it was Costa who encouraged Mason to sketch directly from nature. Mason entered upon a close friendship with Frederic Leighton from the time of their first meeting in Rome in 1853. In 1855, Mason travelled to Paris with George Aitchison to visit the Universal Exhibition, where he studied the works of contemporary French landscape painters, notably Antoine H&eacute;bert and Gabriel-Alexandre Decamps. In Paris Mason sold a Roman landscape to the English artist J. B. Pyne. He and Aitchison then travelled on to England for a short visit.<br>
<br>Mason's early paintings seem to have been conventional rustic subjects but, as he became increasingly entranced by the landscape scenery of the campagna, an intense and poetic quality entered his works. Like Costa, Mason sought to represent the landscape of the Lazio region in a specific and authentic way, with reference to the hardships and endurance of the working people. He returned to Italy for a further period after 1855, working on increasingly ambitious paintings such as the scene showing horses being watered at a campagna farmstead known as <span class="italic">An Italian Landscape</span> (Tate collection), or <span class="italic">Ploughing in the Campagna</span> (Walker Art Gallery, Liverpool), which was the first painting he exhibited at the Royal Academy, in 1857.<br>
<br>Finally, in 1858 Mason moved back to England, to marry, on 5 August that year, his cousin Mary Emma Wood; they had seven children, five of whom survived their parents. Following the death of Mason's father in 1859, the couple set up home at Wetley Abbey. In these years Mason struggled to earn enough to support his family; in addition he suffered from bouts of depression and poor physical health. Frederic Leighton encouraged him to allow the Staffordshire landscape to become the inspiration of his painting: <span class="italic">Wind in the Wolds</span> (Tate collection, on loan to Leighton House, London) of 1863, which Mason painted in response to a commission from Leighton, marks his new interest in subjects set in the English countryside. From this time on Wetley, and its immediate vicinity (which includes hills and moorland and the impressive Wetley Rocks), became the dominant motif of his art. In 1863 Costa visited Mason at Wetley Abbey, finding &#145;in the structure and outlines of that upland landscape a resemblance in the distribution of particular hillsides in the remote Maremma region, while the distinguished appearance of the Staffordshire people was reminiscent of the Etruscan physical type&#146;  (Costa, <span class="italic">Quel che vidi e quel che intesi</span>, 1927, 159). After a stay of three months, the two artists travelled together to London, and then on to Paris to see the Salon exhibition, where that year Costa was showing two works. From 1864, the Masons lived principally in Hammersmith, London, first at Westbourne House, Shaftesbury Road, and later at 7 Theresa Terrace.<br>
<br>In the late 1860s and early 1870s Mason's reputation as one of the most aesthetically advanced painters of the day was confirmed by works shown at the Royal Academy and Dudley Gallery, as well as by the exhibition of seventy-one paintings by him shown at the Burlington Fine Arts Club after his death. In 1868 <span class="italic">The Evening Hymn</span> (previously Wyndham collection; probably destroyed) was, according to Algernon Charles Swinburne, &#145;the finest &hellip; of his works, admirable beyond all where all are admirable&#146;. Swinburne went on to describe the subject:<blockquote>A row of girls, broken in rank here and there, stand and sing on a rough green rise of broken ground; behind them is a wild spare copse, beyond it a sunset of steady and sombre fire stains red with its sunken rays the long low space of the sky; above this broad band of heavy colour the light is fitful and pale. (repr. Swinburne, 366)</blockquote>The success of <span class="italic">The Evening Hymn</span> led to Mason's election as an associate member of the Royal Academy. Mason's later paintings are of the same panoramic landscape type that he had devised in Italy, but with a subtlety of mood and soft tonality adapted to the English countryside. Figures occur, often engaged in some rural occupation&#151;harvesting or plodding home from the fields at the end of a day's labour&#151;and by these motifs Mason suggested in symbolical terms the very cycle of existence.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">Girls Dancing</span> (priv. coll.), later known as <span class="italic">A Pastoral Symphony</span>, was shown at the 1869 Royal Academy exhibition, where its intense and wistful mood and an atmosphere of romantic enticement was admired. The French critic Philippe Burty mentioned Mason in his review of the exhibition as:<blockquote>the landscapist who touched me most deeply. He introduces to his vistas something that is vibrant and impassioned &hellip; He has a feeling for romantic colour, and a quality of light which fills the open spaces and loses itself beneath the leaves like the waves of sound of a shepherd's song. (P. Burty, 56)</blockquote>This beautiful painting was one of a group in the exhibition in which the <span class="italic">Art Journal</span> found:<blockquote>manifest the idealism and the realism, the romance and the naturalism, which are so strangely blended in certain new phases of the English school; to these characteristics may be added signs of the growing sway of Continental styles, together with tendency to intensity of sentiment, and to a sustained rhapsody of colour. (<span class="italic">Art Journal</span>, 1869, 199)</blockquote>Mason died on 22 October 1872 at 7 Theresa Terrace. He was buried in Brompton cemetery on 28 October. His wife survived him. <span class="italic">The Harvest Moon</span> (Tate collection), his last painting, became his most famous work, appearing at a succession of exhibitions in the years after Mason's death and through to the turn of the twentieth century. It was reproduced in an etching by Robert Walker Macbeth, published in 1891, and it was the work that moved critics to compare Mason with Jules Breton, Jean-Fran&ccedil;ois Millet, and Charles Daubigny among French painters.<br>
