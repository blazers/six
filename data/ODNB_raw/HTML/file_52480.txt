<span class="headword">Cape,  William Timothy</span>  (1806&#150;1863), <span class="occ">educationist</span>, born at Walworth, Surrey, on 25 October 1806, was the eldest son of the seven children of <a name="cosubject_52480"></a><span class="headword">William Cape</span>  (1773&#150;1847), <span class="occ">banker and schoolmaster</span>, who was born in Ireby, Cumberland, and who had married Mary Ann Knight (<i>d</i>. after 1822) of Tenterden, Kent, in 1805. William Timothy was educated at Merchant Taylors' School, London, with a view to entering the church, and showed great proficiency in his studies. The elder Cape was resident manager of the bank of Brown, Cobb &amp; Co., Lombard Street, but when it failed in 1816 he turned to the importing of tea and finally decided to emigrate. Having obtained letters from Lord Bathurst to Sir Thomas Brisbane, the governor, William Cape, accompanied by his eldest son, sailed for Van Diemen's Land in November 1821. In 1822 they moved to Sydney, where in 1823 the father took over a private school, the Sydney Academy, where William Timothy helped him. In 1824 William Cape became principal of the Sydney public school, with his son as assistant master. After a brief spell at the Sydney Public Free Grammar School, William Timothy Cape became headmaster in 1829, on the resignation of his father. William Cape had had an accident in 1829 which left him lame. He died in Sydney on 19 November 1847.<br>
<br>In 1829, however, William Timothy Cape reopened a private school in Sydney. On 9 April 1831 he married Jane (1811/12&#150;1858), daughter of William Jaques of the survey department. When the high school called Sydney College was founded in 1835, Cape transferred his private pupils to it, and was elected headmaster. He held this office until 1841 when he resigned and in the next year he founded a new private school, Elfred House, at Paddington, Sydney.<br>
<br>Cape was an exacting but popular schoolmaster who strove to fire his pupils with a desire for education and public service, to extend education to poorer boys by helping to found the Sydney Mechanics' School of Art in 1833 (and teaching in it), and to remove education from the damaging sectarian disputes then current. He retired in 1856 and after his wife died on 16 January 1858 he threw himself into public life, in quick succession becoming member of parliament for Wollombi (1859), commissioner of national education, a magistrate, and fellow of St Paul's College within the University of Sydney.<br>
<br>In 1855&#150;6 Cape made a brief visit to England, and went back in 1860 with his younger children, in order to collect educational information. He died of smallpox at 124 Warwick Street, Pimlico, London, on 14 June 1863. His funeral at Brompton was attended by almost all the Australians then in London. His former pupils erected a tablet (destroyed in 1941) to his memory in St Andrew's Cathedral, Sydney.<br>
