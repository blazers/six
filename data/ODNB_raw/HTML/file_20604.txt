<span class="headword">Oglander, Sir  John</span>  (1585&#150;1655), <span class="occ">diarist</span>, eldest son of Sir William Oglander (1554&#150;1609) of Nunwell, near Brading, Isle of Wight, and West Dean, Sussex, and his first wife, Ann, daughter of Anthony Dillington of Knighton, Isle of Wight, was born on 12 May 1585 at Nunwell. His family, which was of Norman origin, had been settled there since the conquest. Pride in his ancestry is a notable feature of his &#145;Advice to his descendants&#146; and the journal, which gives a vivid picture of his life. Having attended Winchester College, he matriculated from Balliol College, Oxford, on 8 July 1603, and spent three years there without taking a degree. In 1604 he also entered the Middle Temple, but he was not called to the bar. On 4 August 1606 he married Frances (1590&#150;1644), fifth daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/19177/', "Sir George More (1553&#150;1632)")</script> of Loseley, Surrey. In the course of a very happy marriage they had four sons and three daughters. Following the death of his father on 17 March 1609, Oglander succeeded to the family estates, and was placed on the commission of the peace. <br>
<br>On 22 December 1615 Oglander was knighted by James I at Royston. In 1620 he was appointed deputy governor of Portsmouth, but he sold the office three years later, having discovered that it entailed a heavy outlay on entertainment. He accepted in 1624 the post of deputy governor of the Isle of Wight, a post which, being close to home, did not also demand neglect of his estates. He sat for Yarmouth, Isle of Wight, in the parliaments of 1625, 1626, and 1628&#150;9, and partook of the general concern about the threat to freemen's liberties posed by money-raising expedients emanating from the privy council over those years, although he was personally charmed by the king during the latter's visit to the island in 1628. He grew to dislike London and its temptations, preferring life on the island, with its simple pleasures of riding and playing bowls on the downs. He made concerted attempts to improve his estates, planting scores of trees and fruit bushes, but by the early 1630s had concluded that an energetic farming policy was insufficient by itself to maintain his income at a level appropriate to his social status: a gentleman needed public office or a career as a lawyer to raise and maintain his family. He was commissioner of oyer and terminer for Hampshire in 1635, and sheriff of the same county from 1637 to 1639. During his shrievalty he displayed great zeal and activity in the collection of ship money. <br>
<br>On the outbreak of the civil war Oglander adhered to the king, and was superseded in the deputy governorship of the Isle of Wight by Colonel Carne. In June 1643 he was arrested and sent to London on suspicion of delinquency, having refused parliament's commission as governor of the island. Detained pending the investigation of the charges against him by the House of Commons, he was discharged after eight weeks, but was sent for again the following September and placed under arrest in January 1644, remaining close prisoner until procuring his release on condition that he remain within the lines of communication. He was discharged on 12 April 1645. A contribution of &pound;500 was levied upon his estate, although he appears to have paid no more than &pound;115 of it. He was among those who waited on Charles I to express their loyalty on 15 November 1647, the day after the king's arrival at Carisbrooke Castle. Those assembled were given to believe that the king had fled Hampton Court out of fear for his life, and he assured them that he looked forward to reaching a settlement with his parliament of England. By this time Oglander's experience of civil war and of what he considered the arbitrary rule of the island by a county committee composed of social upstarts had merely increased his bitterness and resolve. After the meeting he advised the king's servant Colonel William Legge that the only security against an invasion of the island by those &#145;Levellers&#146; who wished the king dead was to have a boat in readiness to convey him to the mainland. A few days later, the king came to Nunwell. Oglander did not reveal the subject of their discussions, but prayed that &#145;God [would] send him happily hence &hellip; to regain his crown as his predecessor King John did here&#146;  (<span class="italic">Royalist's Notebook</span>, 116). As long as the king remained on the island Oglander visited him regularly until the governor, Colonel Robert Hammond, warned him that two of those about the king, Robert Preston, the keeper of the robes, and Captain Anthony Mildmay, were informing against those who resorted to their sovereign&#151;&#145;which (being in the fire before) made me forbear, though much against my will&#146;  (ibid., 120). However, Oglander was on hand to hear the king's speech of farewell, made at the departure from the island of the parliamentary commissioners for the treaty of Newport on 27 November 1648. <br>
<br>Oglander continued to keep his journal for a while after the king's death, noting his displeasure at what he considered the foolish marriage of his daughter Bridget in October 1649, and the visit he received from the duke of Gloucester at his coming to the island with his sister, the Princess Elizabeth, in 1650. He was again arrested and taken to London in January 1651 on suspicion of treasonable designs, and was released early in the following February, on again giving security to remain within the lines of communication. He died at Nunwell on 28 November 1655, and was buried in the family vault in Brading church. The recumbent effigy in full armour which he had commissioned makes an intriguing contrast with his pen-portrait of a &#145;somewhat corpulent, man of middle stature, with a white beard and somewhat big mustachios, riding in black or some sad-coloured clothes &hellip; on a handsome middling black stone-horse, his hair grey and his complexion very sanguine&#146;  (quoted in Heal and Holmes, 20). His wife, Frances, had died on 12 June 1644 and their much-loved eldest son, George, had died at Caen in Normandy. A diminished estate descended to the second son, William (1611&#150;1670), who represented Newport in the Restoration parliament and was created baronet in 1665.<br>
