<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Smith,  Edwin George Herbert</span>  (1912&#150;1971), <span class="occ">photographer</span>, was born on 15 May 1912 at 2 St Paul's Road, Canonbury, London, the only child of Edwin Stanley Smith, a clerk, and his wife, Lily Beatrice, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Gray. He attended an elementary school in Great College Street, Westminster, which he left at the age of twelve&#151;just after it was discovered that he was severely short-sighted&#151;to attend the Northern Polytechnic, in Holloway, to learn building crafts: bricklaying, carpentry, and decorating. He transferred to the polytechnic's architectural school when he was sixteen, and at eighteen won a scholarship to the Architectural Association. He had to abandon his course two years later, as his mother (whose unhappy marriage had ended in divorce) could no longer support him. Thereafter he worked as an architectural draughtsman for several architects in the offices of Marshall Sisson, notably for R. Myerscough-Walker. From 1935 he turned to the life of a freelance photographer as a potential means of supporting a determined interest in painting. On 7 September 1935 he married Rosemary Monica Louise (<i>b</i>. 1914/15), of Mitcham, Surrey, the daughter of Albert Henry Ansell, a confectioner.<br>
<br>Smith's passion for architecture was subsumed in his career as a prolific and gifted photographer. While his reputation rests largely on his acute eye for the essence of the built environment, his repertory was substantially larger than the recording and interpretation of architecture. Stillness and silence are the most widely cited attributes of his photographic work; he has also been described as an English Atget&#151;the French recorder of the architectural details of Paris and its environs. (The only book of another photographer's work that Smith ever purchased was Atget's <span class="italic">Photographe de Paris</span>, 1930.) His early photographic subjects were London, the mining community of Ashington, in Northumberland, the docks and quays of Newcastle, cats, and the fairground and the circus. By the end of the 1930s he had&#151;from an acquaintance with Paul Nash, the painter, designer, and photographer&#151;learned to develop and print his own work. He worked briefly for <span class="italic">Vogue</span> as a fashion photographer, for which he cared little, and subsequently took pictures for an advertising agency. He conceived the photographer as the self-effacing recorder of reality&#151;a reality recorded in a spirit of admiration and celebration. He wrote, to commission for Focal Press, five photographic handbooks, including <span class="italic">All the Photo Tricks</span> (1940). His own technical progression had been from a Box Brownie to a Contax II and a Tenax, both 35 mm cameras made by Zeiss. After the war he used a Ruby mahogany and brass stand camera of 1904, with a mahogany tripod for architectural subjects. He worked in black and white but experimented with colour photography. Significant holdings of his original work are in the Victoria and Albert Museum and in the Museum of London.<br>
<br>Smith's best-known photographs are of architecture and landscapes, the results of commissions for publications such as <span class="italic">English Parish Churches</span> (the first of his visual essays, commissioned by Thames and Hudson in 1950; new edn, 1976), <span class="italic">English Cottages and Farmhouses, The English Garden, England</span> (text by Geoffrey Grigson), <span class="italic">England</span> (text by Angus Wilson), <span class="italic">Scotland</span> (text by Geoffrey Fraser), and <span class="italic">Ireland</span> (text by Miche&aacute;l MacLiamm&oacute;ir). Many had texts by Olive Muriel Cook [<i>see below</i>], his second wife, whom he married on 7 September 1954, his first marriage having been dissolved in 1943. He and Olive also collaborated on many contributions to the <span class="italic">Saturday Book</span>; they had first met under the aegis of its editor, Leonard Russell. Smith published over thirty books of his photographs of buildings, gardens, and landscape during his lifetime; a further four were published posthumously. Much of his work was done in continental Europe, notably France, Italy, Greece, and Germany. In her introduction to <span class="italic">Edwin Smith Photographs, 1935&#150;1971</span> (1984), Olive Cook revealed that her husband spoke of himself &#145;as an architect by training, a painter by inclination and a photographer by necessity&#146;  (p. 5); he was described as a painter on their marriage certificate. Only at the end of his life did he describe himself as a professional photographer; in his heartfelt preference to be regarded as an artist (that is, as a painter, printmaker, or draughtsman) he resembled other photographers such as Atget and Henri Cartier-Bresson. He painted or drew every day, and edited Ralph Mayer's <span class="italic">The Artist's Handbook of Materials and Techniques</span> (1951, with subsequent editions).<br>
<br>Smith took more than 60,000 photographs. He once said &#145;I have come to worship with my eyes&#146;  (Vaizey, 954); his severe myopia, once corrected, effectively sharpened his vision and enhanced his ability to coax the essence from his inanimate subjects. His images define the ways in which light, from dawn to dusk, illuminates the essential features of land and landscape, garden and building. If they do not recognize his name, millions know his images through the continued publication and exhibition of his photographic work.<br>
<br>Smith died of cancer on 29 December 1971 at his home, the Coach House, Windmill Hill, Saffron Walden, Essex, where he had lived since the early 1960s. His legacy is an imaginative documentation of the countryside, churches, palaces, and vernacular buildings of the British Isles and much of Europe. As his second wife and collaborator described it, he &#145;lived by looking&#146;  (Vaizey, 954).<br>
<br>Smith's second wife, <a name="cosubject_76881"></a><span class="headword">Olive Muriel Cook</span>  (1912&#150;2002), <span class="occ">writer and artist</span>, was born on 20 February 1912 at 43 Garden Walk, Chesterton, Cambridge, the daughter of Arthur Hugh Cook, a library assistant at Cambridge University Library, and his wife, Kate, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Webb. Her father came from a family of ornamental plasterers, and her mother from a family of craftsmen in wood. Scholarships took her to both the Perse School and Newnham College, Cambridge, where she read modern languages. After graduating she worked as a typographer at the publishers Chatto and Windus, then as supervisor of publications at the National Gallery, where she worked under Kenneth Clark, and helped with the removal of its treasures to Blaenau Ffestiniog. During the Second World War several of her watercolours were acquired for the Recording Britain project, and in 1945 she left the National Gallery to make her living as a writer and artist. She produced guides to Suffolk (1948, with illustrations by Rowland Suddaby) and Cambridgeshire (1953) before marrying Edwin Smith. After their marriage, besides writing the texts and descriptive notes for most of her husband's publications, she also produced her own works, including <span class="italic">Breckland</span> (1956). From 1952 to 1964 she was the English representative for the Carnegie Institute at Pittsburgh. After her husband's death she managed his collection of negatives and prints, and edited the selection published in 1984. She also produced her own works, including children's stories, an opera libretto (&#145;The split goose feather&#146;, for Christopher Brown), and <span class="italic">Movement in Two Dimensions</span> (1963), a study of the precursors of cinema. She was active in civic as well as social life in Saffron Walden. She was a founder member of the Fry Art Gallery Society, which in 1987 established the Fry Art Gallery there. Less successfully, she was involved in the campaign against the building of Stansted airport, publishing <span class="italic">The Stansted Affair</span> (1967, with a foreword by John Betjeman) in response to the government's decision to overrule the result of a public inquiry. Although she had no children herself, she enjoyed their company, and had a rapport with them. Passionately devoted to her husband's work, fiercely intelligent, and with a highly developed and original moral and ethical sense, she had a wide circle of friends and was hospitable &#145;to the point of recklessness&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Independent</span>). She died on 2 May 2002 at Saffron Walden Community Hospital, Saffron Walden, of cancer.<br>
