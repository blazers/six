<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Dibnah,  Frederick <span class="st"> [Fred]</span></span>  (1938&#150;2004), <span class="occ">steeplejack and television presenter</span>, was born at 7 Alfred Street, Bolton, on 29 April 1938, the son of Frank Dibnah, a bleacher's beetler, and his wife, Betsy, later Bessie, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Travis, a gasworks charwoman. He grew up watching steam trains on the railway line that ran behind the family's terraced house and marvelled at the tall industrial chimney-stacks across the skyline, which he enjoyed sketching. His fascination with steam power was furthered by seeing various contraptions, pulleys, and belts on visits to the bleach factory where his father worked.<br>
<br>After elementary education in Bolton and a short time studying at Bolton College of Art, Dibnah found employment as a joiner's apprentice. Then an interest in high buildings and a need to earn extra money led him to start a weekend job as a steeplejack. After two years' national service with the army in Germany, spent mostly using his joinery skills to renovate a farmhouse and barns at a camp used by the troops, he took up steeplejacking full-time, travelling to jobs on a 1927 AJS motorcycle and using a pair of binoculars to examine chimneys for damage before persuading their owners to allow him to restore the structures to their former glory. On 19 May 1967, at Gretna, he married the nineteen-year-old Alison Mary Foster, hairdresser, of Bolton, daughter of Leslie Arthur Foster, mechanical engineer. They had three daughters.<br>
<br>In 1978 Dibnah was filmed for BBC North West's regional news programme as he repaired Bolton town hall's clock. Dibnah, who invited its reporter, Alistair McDonald, to join him, recalled:<blockquote>I had a plank going from the tower and across the face, so there he is inside the tower, looking out, and I am standing out on the plank, 200 foot up, showing off the new stone pillars we had made for the job. &#145;Are you coming out, then?&#146; I asked, pointing to the plank. His reply is unprintable, as they say, but we did the interview anyway and it went out at the end of the evening news. (<span class="italic">The Independent</span>, 8 Nov 2004)</blockquote>This led Don Haworth, a producer at BBC North West's studios in Manchester, to make a fifty-minute documentary, <span class="italic">Fred Dibnah, Steeplejack</span> (1979), as part of a series about people with unusual occupations. In the programme Dibnah talked about his job while demolishing or repairing factory chimneys, steeples, and towers. Restoration work was his preference, although &#145;doing a dropper&#146; was sometimes necessary&#151;drawing large crowds of onlookers when announced&#151;and he took pride in not using dynamite but ensuring a neat demolition by cutting a mouth out in the bottom of the chimney, propping up the opening with sticks of wood, then burning them by lighting a large fire.<br>
<br>Such was Dibnah's popularity with the public that Haworth made four television series about him: <span class="italic">Fred</span> (1983), <span class="italic">A Year with Fred</span> (1987), <span class="italic">Life with Fred</span> (1994), and <span class="italic">The Fred Dibnah Story</span> (1996). Elevated to celebrity status, he undertook steam-engine restoration projects at a sawmill in Parc Glynllifon, Caernarvonshire, and Wetheriggs pottery, near Penrith in Cumbria, and was seen as an odd-job man arriving to repair a weather vane on top of Mr and Mrs Kellogg's house in a 1996 television advertisement. The subject of so many BBC programmes, recognizable in his flat cap, boiler-suit, and watch on a chain, then became the presenter of further series, touring Britain to celebrate its industrial heritage in <span class="italic">Fred Dibnah's Industrial Age</span> (1999), discovering the country's greatest buildings and feats of engineering in <span class="italic">Fred Dibnah's Magnificent Monuments</span> (2000), examining the craft and engineering skills that were part of its history in <span class="italic">Fred Dibnah's the Building of Britain</span> (2002), and tracing the development of steam power in <span class="italic">Fred Dibnah's Age of Steam</span> (2003). Then the one-off special <span class="italic">Dig with Dibnah</span> (2004) followed his attempt to reconstruct a part of Britain's industrial past by digging a 70 ft deep mine shaft, complete with pithead gear and steam-powered winding engine, in his own back garden. Ill health forced him to cut short filming for another series, <span class="italic">Fred Dibnah's Made in Britain</span>, in which he celebrated great engineering achievements by touring heritage sites on his newly restored 1912 Aveling and Porter steam traction engine, although the twelve programmes were screened posthumously in 2005. The irony of gaining fame for knocking down the mills and mines that once represented Lancashire's status as the textile capital of the world was not lost on Dibnah, who once said: &#145;It's OK for environmentalists but very sad for me&#146;  (<span class="italic">Bolton Evening News</span>, 5 Sept 1992).<br>
<br>Dibnah's first marriage having ended in divorce, he married on 27 February 1987 Susan Lorenz, a 28-year-old administrator and daughter of Jack Allmark, gardener; they had two sons before divorcing in 1996. On 26 September 1998 Dibnah married Sheila Grundy, a forty-year-old former magician's assistant and daughter of Arnold Grundy, milkman; Dibnah thereby became stepfather to her son. He was appointed an MBE in the 2004 new year's honours list and received honorary doctorates from the engineering departments of the universities of Birmingham and Aberdeen. He died on 6 November 2004 at Bolton Hospice, Queens Park Street, Bolton, of cancer. He was survived by his wife, Sheila, his five children, and his stepson.<br>
