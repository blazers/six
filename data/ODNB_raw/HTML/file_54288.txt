<span class="headword">Margaret</span> <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Margaret Drummond]</span>  (<em>d.</em> in or after 1374), <span class="occ">queen of Scots, consort of David II</span>, was the daughter of Sir Malcolm Drummond. She was married at an unknown date to Sir John Logie of that ilk (<i>d</i>. 1363?), almost certainly the grandson of the Sir John Logie executed by Robert I after the Soulis conspiracy in 1320. Her husband was apparently still alive after 1 April 1363, but presumably died soon after. From this marriage Margaret had at least one son, another <a href="#cosubject_54288">John Logie [<i>see below</i>]</a>.<br>
<br>The first mention of Margaret Logie (as she was then described) in connection with her future husband, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/3726/', "David II (1324&#150;1371)")</script>, is in a charter to the Friars Preachers of Aberdeen, dated 20 January 1363, making a grant for the souls of David himself and of &#145;our beloved&#146; Margaret Logie (<i>dilecte nostre</i>). This open recognition of their relationship suggests that David already contemplated a second marriage, if Margaret should be free to contract one; his first wife, Joan, the sister of Edward III, had died on 7 September 1362. Since the Drummond family was powerful and involved in a violent feud against kinsmen and allies of Robert the Steward, this relationship may have helped to cause the Steward to join two other prominent nobles, the earls of March and Douglas, in 1363 in a revolt whose origins are complex and obscure. It may have been in part a reaction to the king's seizure of Mar's castle of Kildrummy early in that year (Mar was married to Douglas's sister). And the rebels were probably also concerned that David's failure to pay his ransom might lead to their being sent as hostages to England. Others besides the Steward may have feared the influence of the new mistress's and prospective queen's relations. After the revolt collapsed, and presumably after the death of Sir John Logie, David proceeded to marry Margaret at Inchmurdo in Fife, where the formal submissions of the Steward and the other rebels were performed on 14 May 1363. The date of the marriage remains uncertain: Andrew Wyntoun gives it as early as April 1363. According to the fifteenth-century chronicler Walter Bower, David sought the marriage &#145;not so much for the excellence of her character &hellip; as for the pleasure he took in her desirable appearance&#146;  (Bower, 7.333). An even stronger motive was probably his desire for the heir which had been denied his first marriage.<br>
<br>For some years Margaret seems to have been in high favour, while her Drummond relatives made prestigious and profitable marriages; her nephew <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/54171/', "Sir Malcolm Drummond (d. 1402?)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/54170/', "Drummond family")</script>] married the daughter of the earl of Douglas, and her niece <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8063/', "Annabella")</script> became the wife of the Steward's son, the future Robert III. By 1368, however, still with no heir in prospect, her position had become less sure. There was an obscure quarrel between David and several members of the Stewart family which Bower attributes to Margaret's influence, though the reasons may have been quite other. David soon after turned on Margaret herself (according to the fifteenth-century <span class="italic">Liber pluscardensis</span>, because she pretended to be pregnant when she was not) and instituted proceedings for a divorce, on what grounds is unknown. This was duly pronounced, probably early in 1369. But Margaret would not go quietly. She is said to have escaped to England and thence appealed to the pope in Avignon: she received a safe conduct to pass through England in 1372 and there is an acknowledgement of a loan to her made by three London merchants at Avignon in June of the same year. Her proceedings, which were continued after David's death in 1371, were ended only by her death, which occurred on a pilgrimage to Rome, probably in or soon after 1374.<br>

<a name="cosubject_54288"></a><span class="headword">John Logie</span>  (<em>fl. </em><em>c.</em>1365&#150;<em>c.</em>1395)<span class="occ"></span>, Margaret's son from her first marriage, had been the beneficiary of special favour from David II, who made several grants of land to him, including the royal lands of Annandale in 1366. In the same year the king granted that the lands of Logie in Strathearn, which had previously been held of the Steward, were in future to be held in barony from the crown; this concession was repeated two years later. Logie continued to be important in the reigns of Robert II and Robert III. A cousin of Annabella Drummond, the wife of John, earl of Carrick, he seems to have attached himself firmly to the Carrick party in the complex politics of the later years of Robert II. Logie was involved in a long-running dispute over Strath Gartney with Carrick's younger brother and rival, Robert, earl of Fife, a dispute which Logie ultimately won after Carrick succeeded to the throne as Robert III in 1390. It was probably he who appeared as chamberlain to the king's eldest son, David, earl of Carrick, in the early 1390s. The date of his death is not known.<br>
