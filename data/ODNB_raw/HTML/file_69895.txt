<span class="headword">Ekarte,  George Daniel</span> <span class="st"> [<em>known as </em>Daniels Ekarte]</span>  (1896/7&#150;1964), <span class="occ">minister and community worker</span>, was born in west Africa, possibly in the Calabar region of Nigeria. His early years were spent at mission stations run by Free Church of Scotland missionaries. Impressed by what he had heard of the glories of the &#145;mother country&#146;, he obtained a seaman's certificate (which named him simply George Daniel) and worked his way to Britain, where he arrived probably in the early 1920s. Instead of finding glories, he found Liverpool, the city with the highest infant mortality rate in the UK, where the unemployment rate among insured workers was 28 per cent; by 1933 10 per cent of the city's population was in receipt of relief, with the poor heavily concentrated in the racially mixed Toxteth district. The census of 1911 revealed 880 residents born in India and 693 born in Africa; ethnicity was not recorded. In 1919 anti-black riots in the city resulted in the lynching of a black man for whose murder no one was arrested, though the police witnessed the incident.<br>
<br>Working in the local oil mills and sugar refineries, Pastor Daniels Ekarte, as he now called himself, began preaching on street corners, at a gospel hall, and at the Coloured Men's Religious Institute. He also began to visit Africans on ships and in lodging-houses and hospitals. Not satisfied with what he could accomplish this way, he approached the Church of Scotland foreign missions committee and probably also the Liverpool diocese for financial help to set up a permanent mission home. The African Churches Mission was opened in Toxteth on 7 July 1931. It became the main, if not the only, source of succour for the city's resident and itinerant black population, as well as for other local people, serving as a spartan hostel, a place of worship, and a canteen providing cheap meals and free breakfasts for the district's children. There was a scout troop and a Brownie pack, music and secondary school classes for schoolchildren, a mothers' union, and an annual children's Christmas party. The mission also served as a social services agency to which even the police referred people, especially Africans. The mission's ledger reveals the level of local poverty: money was provided for boots, winter coats, and burials, for hospital fees and for rent. During the Second World War, when Ekarte was an ARP warden, the mission also provided emergency housing. All this was accomplished with little financial support, but with help from neighbours, white and black, and donations from local shopkeepers.<br>
<br>During the Second World War Ekarte became involved in two controversial issues. In 1940 he actively supported a strike by African seamen, demanding higher wages and the end of the system whereby deductions were made for the shipping company's Liverpool hostel, whether the men stayed there or not. (African and other &#145;colonial&#146; seamen received not only much lower wages than their European peers, but also less living space and rations on board ship.) The men's demands were ignored. The other issue was that of the &#145;brown babies&#146;: that is, the 650 or so children fathered by African American servicemen stationed in Britain, whose white mothers did not want to keep them. (The American army did not permit the men to marry the mothers.) Ekarte lobbied the government for action on the children's behalf and even housed some of them at the mission. With help from the fund-raising efforts of Trinidad-born cricketer and government official Learie Constantine he tried to purchase a larger house to use as a children's home. The government did nothing; Ekarte could not raise enough funds for a home, and in a dawn raid the eight children at the mission were dragged away and dispersed around the country by Liverpool social services.<br>
<br>Naturally Ekarte maintained a relationship with other black organizations in the UK and, when funds permitted, he attended their meetings. The mission was visited by civil and religious African dignitaries, occasionally by MPs interested in its work, and by officials from the Colonial Office, from which it received some support. Three future African prime ministers&#151;Hastings Banda, Jomo Kenyatta, and Kwame Nkrumah&#151;stayed at the mission in the 1940s.<br>
<br>Though racial strife and discrimination in Liverpool did not decrease (there were anti-black riots in 1948), there was a huge increase in social service provisions after the war, and thus the mission lost much of its <i>raison d'&ecirc;tre</i>. Ekarte could not raise the funds to repair the dilapidated and bomb-damaged mission buildings in Hill Street, and they were demolished by the city in 1964. Ekarte was moved to sheltered housing, at 27 Avison Tower, Princes Park, Toxteth, Liverpool, where he died of a coronary thrombosis on 12 July 1964, aged sixty-seven. He was buried on 20 July in Allerton cemetery, Liverpool. Of his wife, Lily, no details are known.<br>
