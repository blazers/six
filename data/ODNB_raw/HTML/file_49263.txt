<span class="headword">&Oacute;l&aacute;f the White</span> <span class="st"> [&Oacute;l&aacute;fr inn Hv&iacute;ti]</span>  (<em>fl. </em>853&#150;871), <span class="occ">viking leader</span>, was active in Ireland and northern Britain during the ninth century. His career is given in the Old Norse <span class="italic">Landn&aacute;mab&oacute;k</span>, which claims that his father was named Ingiald, and that his wife was Aud the Deepminded, the daughter of Ketil Flat-Nefr (Ketill Flatnose), who ruled in the Hebrides. Their son was named Thorstein, and his daughter Groa was the ancestor of the earls of Orkney. The career of &Oacute;l&aacute;f the White corresponds with that of the Olaf &#145;son of the king of Lochland&#146; (Norway) (<i>d</i>. 875), also known as &Oacute;l&aacute;f, king of Dublin (<i>c</i>.853&#150;871), whose activities are recorded in the Irish chronicles; many scholars consider them to be the same individual. They were active at the same time, in the same place, and were recognized as the leaders of the vikings in Ireland.<br>
<br>&Oacute;l&aacute;f of Dublin carved out an empire in Ireland and northern Britain, and was the overlord of the vikings in those lands. He first appeared in Ireland in the mid-ninth century, when he took lordship over the vikings and collected taxes from the Irish. In 857 he and his brother &Iacute;varr led an expedition to Munster and defeated a Caittel Find and his army of vikings and renegade Irish. The brothers made an alliance with Cerball mac D&uacute;nlainge, the lord of Ossory, in 859 and raided Meath. In 860 &Oacute;l&aacute;f was allied with the future high-king <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/50072/', "&#193;ed Findliath mac N&#233;ill")</script> in a confrontation with the high-king M&aacute;el Sechnaill mac M&aacute;ele Ruanaid who had made a show of force at Armagh. The next year the allies raided M&aacute;el Sechnaill's lands in Meath. By this time &Aacute;ed's daughter was &Oacute;l&aacute;f's wife. This alliance ended with the accession of &Aacute;ed to the high-kingship, and in 863 &Oacute;l&aacute;f, together with his brothers &Iacute;varr and Auisl, made a new alliance with Lorc&aacute;n mac Cathail, the lord of Clann Cholm&aacute;in, and plundered Brega. In the course of their campaign they searched four famous caves: &#145;Achadh Aldai&#146; (possibly to be identified with Newgrange), Knowth, Dowth, and Drogheda. This alliance had ended when, at the monastery of Clonard in 864, &Oacute;l&aacute;f drowned Conchobar mac Donnchada of Clann Cholm&aacute;in. &Oacute;l&aacute;f moved into Britain in 866 when he and his brother Auisl raided central Scotland with a force drawn from the vikings of Ireland and Britain in a campaign that lasted from 1 January to St Patrick's day. &Aacute;ed Findliath took advantage of &Oacute;l&aacute;f's absence to lead a sweeping campaign against the vikings in the north of Ireland, destroying their fortresses from Donegal to Antrim. More disasters followed in the next year when a fortress at Clondalkin, called D&uacute;n Amhlaim (&#145;&Oacute;l&aacute;f's fort&#146;), was destroyed by the Irish. The same year &Oacute;l&aacute;f's brother Auisl was slain. One record states that he was killed by the men of Munster, when he and &Oacute;l&aacute;f were attacking the monastery of Lismore, although another story claims that Auisl wanted &Oacute;l&aacute;f's wife, the daughter of Cin&aacute;ed mac Conaing of Brega, and &Oacute;l&aacute;f killed him in a jealous rage. &Oacute;l&aacute;f raided the monastery of Armagh in 869, when reputedly a thousand persons were either captured or killed by the vikings. The following year &Oacute;l&aacute;f and &Iacute;varr returned to Britain and raided until 871, when they returned to Dublin. In that year &Oacute;l&aacute;f departed from Ireland and returned to Scandinavia, leaving behind a son named Oist&iacute;n, who was slain in 875.<br>
<br>Although the Norse sagas claim that &Oacute;l&aacute;f the White was slain in Ireland, the Scottish chronicle claims that &Oacute;l&aacute;f of Dublin was in Scotland when he was slain in battle by Constantine I, king of Scots, about the year 875. The two accounts are not exclusive, for there is no indication that at this date the Norse were aware of distinctions between the Gaelic-speaking communities in Ireland and Britain.<br>
