<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Browne,  Coral Edith</span>  (1913&#150;1991), <span class="occ">actress</span>, was born Coral Edith Brown (she later added the &#145;e&#146; to her surname for stage purposes) on 23 July 1913 in Melbourne, Australia, the only child of Leslie Clarence Brown, restaurateur, and his wife, Victoria Elizabeth Bennett. Her father ran a successful restaurant in Melbourne. She was educated at the Claremont Ladies' College there. Acting (at least for a well-brought-up young girl) was at the time unthinkable in one of Australia's most conservative communities. She had started to study costume design at an art school attached to the local repertory theatre when an actress fell suddenly ill and Browne was thrust on stage to play a woman living &#145;in sin&#146; in Galsworthy's <span class="italic">Loyalties</span> (1931). She was never thereafter to leave the stage for long; at eighteen she was a notable Melbourne Hedda Gabler, and at twenty-one a widely experienced repertory actress.<br>
<br>For her twenty-first birthday Browne's father gave her &pound;50 to visit London, on the condition that she would return home if the money ran out before she had made any kind of success. It duly ran out, but not before Browne had settled into the first of several liaisons, this one with the West End manager Firth Sheppard. &#145;Firth is my shepherd,&#146; she once noted, &#145;I shall not want&#146;  (private information). It took her several years of understudying and minor role playing before she made her name in 1941, opposite Robert Morley, as the long-suffering secretary Maggie Cutler in <span class="italic">The Man who Came to Dinner</span> by Kaufman and Hart, which played in London and on tour almost throughout the Second World War. During this time she started an off-stage affair with the actor and singer Jack Buchanan (1890&#150;1957) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32154/', "Buchanan, Walter John")</script>], with whom she shared a long run in <span class="italic">Castle in the Air</span> (1949).<br>
<br>By now thoroughly established as a comedienne of considerable elegance and a wicked wit, Browne decided as early as 1951 that she wished to be taken more seriously, even classically, on stage, and joined the Old Vic company in that year to play first Emilia to Douglas Campbell's Othello, and then Regan to Donald Wolfit's King Lear, an experience she likened to being &#145;a bit of fluff on the carpet at the approach of a vacuum cleaner in full thrust&#146;  (private information). Like Maggie Smith, whose career parallels Browne's in many ways, she became renowned for her backstage commentaries; acting with Nigel Patrick in <span class="italic">The Remarkable Mr Pennypacker</span> (1955) was, she said, &#145;like working with two tons of condemned veal&#146;  (private information).<br>
<br>Browne's first truly classical success came in 1956, when (again at the Vic) she played a notable Lady Macbeth, and then Gertrude to the somewhat late-life Hamlet of Michael Redgrave; they subsequently took the latter production to Moscow, where Browne met with the spy Guy Burgess (who had been in love with Redgrave at Cambridge), an encounter which later became the subject of Alan Bennett's play <span class="italic">An Englishman Abroad</span>, in which Browne played her younger self for BBC television in 1983. Meanwhile Browne had married, on 26 June 1950, the actor and agent Philip Westrope Pearman (1910/11&#150;1964), son of Albert Pearman, flour miller. The marriage &#145;was famously happy, perhaps <i>because of</i> rather than <i>despite</i> his ambiguous sexuality&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Independent</span>, 31 May 1991). Ten years after his death, and after a long affair with Michael Hordern [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/58193/', "Hordern, Sir Michael Murray (1911&#150;1995)")</script>], she married the actor and art expert Vincent Price (1911&#150;1993), whom she had met on a horror film, <span class="italic">Theatre of Blood</span> (1973). They decided to live in London and furnish a flat; told by a shop manager that the bed they wished to purchase for it had a five-week delivery delay, Coral pointed at her always-cadaverous new husband; &#145;Five weeks?&#146; she asked, &#145;Have you seen Mr Price?&#146;  (private information).<br>
<br>In the 1960s Browne reverted to high comedy and seldom revisited the classics. Through the 1960s and 1970s she scored many London hits in such comedies as <span class="italic">The Right Honourable Gentleman</span> (1964&#150;6) and <span class="italic">Lady Windermere's Fan</span> (1966). Wilde and Lonsdale were always among her favourite dramatists, though she curiously missed out on Coward and Rattigan. In 1970 she joined the National Theatre for a notable Mrs Warren in <span class="italic">Mrs Warren's Profession</span>, her first return to Shaw since her early days in Melbourne, and later that decade she took on (with Vincent Price) two difficult Anouilhs, first <span class="italic">The Waltz of the Toreadors</span> (1974) and then <span class="italic">Ard&egrave;le</span> (1975).<br>
<br>Browne's film career was always intermittent, though she had notable successes as the tough, bitchy friend of the star in <span class="italic">Auntie Mame</span> (1958), the cynical procuress to Vivien Leigh in Tennessee Williams's <span class="italic">The Roman Spring of Mrs Stone</span> (1961), and the lesbian BBC administrator in <span class="italic">The Killing of Sister George</span> (1969). One of her last great appearances was as the elderly Mrs Alice Hargreaves, the original Alice in Wonderland, in <span class="italic">Dreamchild</span> (1985). By then she had settled in California as Mrs Vincent Price, though none too happily; Hollywood was altogether too artificial a culture for her tough Australian honesty. Told by a box office manager that she had rung far too late to secure tickets for a much vaunted <span class="italic">Macbeth</span> featuring Charlton Heston and Vanessa Redgrave that was opening at the local theatre, her response was &#145;Right then, I'll just have two tickets for after the interval&#146;  (private information).<br>
<br>Browne's friends sometimes wished she would more often take more challenging work. But that would be to overlook how good she was in what she did choose to do, and her courage was unquestionable, not least when she ventured into Joe Orton's <span class="italic">What the Butler Saw</span> (1969) at a time when few stars of her generation and elegance would even risk being seen in the audience. Like Edith Evans and Marie Tempest, but precious few others, she was often greater than her roles, and it is arguable that she was often funnier off-stage than on. She endured a long and painful terminal illness with characteristic grace, goodwill, and discretion before dying in Los Angeles on 29 May 1991. She was survived by her husband, Vincent Price. A mass of thanksgiving was celebrated at the church of the Immaculate Conception, Farm Street, London, on 5 September 1991. With her death the British theatre lost a certain style, made up equally of talent, courage, and arrogance, which it was already impossible truly to recapture in an age when directors, designers, and writers called the shots.<br>
