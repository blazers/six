<span class="headword">Paget,  John</span>  (1811&#150;1898), <span class="occ">police magistrate and author</span>, was born in Humberstone, Leicestershire, on 14 May 1811, the second son of Thomas Paget, a Leicester banker and a man of some wealth. John Paget was involved in a bitter feud with his brother, Thomas Tertius Paget, over their father's substantial estate. The family was of Huguenot origin, descended from Valerian Paget who fled to England after the massacre of St Bartholomew. John Paget was educated entirely at home and for some years he was an assistant in his father's bank. He entered the Middle Temple on 16 October 1835, and was called to the bar on 2 November 1838.<br>
<br>On 1 March 1839 Paget married Elizabeth, eldest daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/23161/', "William Rathbone (1787&#150;1868)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/23160/', "Rathbone, William (1757&#150;1809)")</script>] of Greenbank, Liverpool, and his wife, Elizabeth, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Greg (<i>d</i>. 1882). Her Unitarian family had long been associated with social reform. Her brother William Rathbone (1819&#150;1902) was an MP and philanthropist, as was his daughter, Eleanor Florence Rathbone (1872&#150;1946). They had a son and two daughters, one of whom, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35356/', "Mary Rosalind Paget (1855&#150;1948)")</script>, became an influential nurse and reformer of midwifery.<br>
<br>From 1850 until 1855 Paget was secretary first to Lord Chancellor Truro and secondly to Lord Chancellor Cranworth. In 1864 he was appointed a magistrate at the Thames police court; he was transferred from this to the Hammersmith and Wandsworth courts, and on their separation he presided over the court at west London until his resignation in 1889.<br>
<br>Paget gave his leisure to writing. He was a contributor to <span class="italic">Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine</span> between 1860 and 1888. His papers criticizing Macaulay's views of Marlborough, the massacre of Glencoe, the highlands of Scotland, Claverhouse, and William Penn, were reprinted in 1861 as <span class="italic">The New Examen</span>. Other articles on a wide range of topics, including Nelson, Byron, well-known legal cases, and art, were published in 1874 as <span class="italic">Paradoxes and Puzzles: Historical, Judicial, and Literary</span>.<br>
<br>Paget was also a skilful draughtsman, and his illustrations to <span class="italic">Bits and Bearing-Reins</span> (1875) by Edward Fordham Flower helped to make the reader understand the cruelty caused to horses by the method of harnessing against which Flower protested. In early days Paget was an ardent whig, and enrolled himself among those who were prepared to fight for the <span class="roman">Reform Bill</span>. He joined the Reform Club when it was founded in 1836, and was a member of its library committee for twenty-four years and chairman from 1861 to 1865. He died on 28 May 1898 at his residence, 28 The Boltons, West Brompton, London. He was survived by his wife and two daughters.<br>
