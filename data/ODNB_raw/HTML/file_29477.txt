<span class="headword">Drogheda,  William  of</span>  (1200<span class="mult">x</span>10?&#150;1245), <span class="occ">civil and canon lawyer</span>, has no known association with the Irish town of Drogheda. He made provisions&#151;in a charter which survives in the Queen's College, Oxford, charter 287, sealed with his seal&#151;for his parents (and himself) to be buried in the priory church at Monk Sherborne, Hampshire. His presentation to the living of Grafton Underwood, Northamptonshire, his only certain benefice, was by the Norman priory at St Fromund which, like Monk Sherborne, was dependent on the abbey of St Vigor, C&eacute;risy, in Normandy. His connections, therefore, are likely to be with Hampshire, and Drogheda may be a local place name in that county. He may not have been priested until he received the Northamptonshire living in 1242&#150;3. A dispensation to hold an additional benefice was granted to him in 1245, and this may have been Petham in Kent, if a model case in his book is to be believed.<br>
<br>Drogheda's career was associated with Oxford. His mastership apparently postdates Trinity 1237; his regency is mentioned in 1239. There is no evidence that he ever studied at the great Bolognese law school. Drogheda's particular claim to fame is as an Oxford teacher of the late 1230s, who produced a successful law book at a time when legal studies were in a state of transition. This work, the <span class="italic">Summa aurea</span>, served as a handy manual for both student and practitioner. Only one book of the projected six which are promised in the preface (and were to include one on marriage) has survived. It has been edited by L. Wahrmund (1914) and since then only two further manuscripts have been discovered: Bruges, Stadsbibliotheek, MS 355, and Worcester Cathedral, Dean and Chapter MS 74 (incomplete). Drogheda knew and cited the works of the two civilians, Azo and Roffredus of Benevento. Azo's <span class="italic">Summe</span> of the first nine books of the <span class="italic">Code</span> and of the <span class="italic">Digest</span> was in circulation in 1211 and Roffredus's <span class="italic">Libelli de iure civili</span> after 1235. He also knew and used Gregory IX's <span class="italic">Decretals</span> of 1234 and he cites the canons of the legate Otto in the Council of London of 1237. The <span class="italic">Summa aurea</span> is likely to date from 1237, though it may have been in use in various stages of completion before that date. Included in Gregory IX's <span class="italic">Decretals</span>, and so more widely circulated by them, was the bull of Honorius III of 1219 banning the study of the civil law by the clergy. It was the particular importance, therefore, of Drogheda's treatise that following the prohibition it retained and passed on the civilian knowledge which was needed by practitioners in the English canon-law courts. It is a procedural textbook, built on examples, possibly based on actual cases and their documents, and giving advice on how to win cases. There is little doubt that it influenced two generations of Oxford students.<br>
<br>Drogheda himself was an accomplished advocate and proctor: Matthew Paris informs us that William of Montpellier gave up his claim to the bishopric of Coventry and Lichfield on hearing of the death of his advocate, William of Drogheda. The great Bolognese doctor of the fourteenth century, Giovanni d'Andreae, gave Drogheda's work a posthumous fame by adding it to a list of notable civilian treatises which had originally been compiled by the French canonist William Durandus (<i>d</i>. 1296). Drogheda's work, in spite of its local examples, had already found its way abroad, and the manuscript was certainly copied in the thirteenth century in France and in Italy, and perhaps also in the empire and the Low Countries. His career was brought to an untimely end when he was murdered by his servant in 1245. The house in Oxford which he gave to the prior and convent at Monk Sherborne was supposedly on the site of 33 High Street, which is still called Drawda Hall.<br>
