<span class="headword">Lonsdale,  James</span>  (1777&#150;1839), <span class="occ">portrait painter</span>, was born at Lancaster on 16 May 1777 and baptized on 15 June at St John's, Lancaster, the son of Francis Lonsdale and his wife, Anne. It is believed that he attended a charity school in Lancaster. He worked as a pattern designer at Margerison and Glover's printworks, Catterall, near Garstang, Lancashire. About 1799 Lonsdale moved to London, where he briefly became a pupil of George Romney, who retired to Kendal late in 1799, and in October 1801 he entered the Royal Academy Schools. In that year he painted a copy of Van Dyck's Ghent masterpiece <span class="italic">The Crucifixion</span>, as the altarpiece for the Roman Catholic chapel of St Mary and St Michael, Garstang, where it still hangs. In 1806 he presented to Lancaster his <span class="italic">Admiral Lord Nelson</span> (Lancaster town hall), for which he received the freedom of the city. With encouragement from Richard Threlfall, a local Lancaster architect, whose portrait by Lonsdale was exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1809, he soon received commissions from Archibald, ninth duke of Hamilton of Ashton Hall near Lancaster, of whom he exhibited one portrait in 1804 and another in 1819. Between 1802 and 1838 Lonsdale exhibited 138 paintings at the Royal Academy, eighty-seven with the Society of British Artists (which he had helped to found) in Suffolk Street, and seven with the British Institution. He was painter to the Sublime Society of Beefsteaks, a dining club limited to twenty-four members, more familiarly known as the Beefsteak Club, founded in 1735 by the theatre manager John Rich, which included Hogarth among its founding members.<br>
<br>On 7 April 1807 Lonsdale married Jane Thornton (1776/7&#150;1827), who came from Lancaster, in Edmonton, Middlesex. On the death of John Opie in 1807 Lonsdale bought that painter's house in Berners Street, Marylebone, where the couple lived thereafter. They had three sons, all baptized at St Marylebone, Middlesex: Richard Threlfall Lonsdale, who became a painter; James John Lonsdale, who became a circuit judge in the West Riding of Yorkshire (1855&#150;67) and recorder of Folkestone (from 1847 to his death, <i>c</i>.1886); and Edward Francis Lonsdale, who became a surgeon. It is thought that a descendant, Henry Lonsdale, wrote a life of James Lonsdale which was published in 1870, although no copy of this work appears to be extant. Jane Lonsdale died on 28 April 1827.<br>
<br>Lonsdale's commissions included one in 1820 from the lord mayor of London for a portrait of Queen Caroline; on Henry Meyer's stipple engraving of that portrait Lonsdale is described as &#145;Principal Painter in Ordinary to the Queen&#146;, a description that Cross questions in his biography of Romney  (Cross, 241). Another portrait of Queen Caroline painted by Lonsdale <i>c</i>.1821 is in the National Portrait Gallery, London. Further aristocratic and royal commissions included <span class="italic">HIH Archduke Maximilian</span> (exh. RA, 1819); the king of the Belgians; the tsar of Russia; <span class="italic">Lord Hamilton</span> (exh. RA, 1822; Royal Collection), and portraits of the duke of Wellington (1815; Gov. Art Coll., HM embassy, Vienna) and the duke of Sussex (exh. RA, 1817; Trinity College, Cambridge). Famous sitters included the <span class="italic">Right Honourable William Pitt</span> (1807; Lancaster town hall); the French tragic actor Fran&ccedil;ois-Joseph Talma as Hamlet (exh. RA, 1818); the sculptor Joseph Nollekens (<i>c</i>.1818; NPG); Henry Brougham, first Baron Brougham and Vaux (1821; NPG), and the scientists Sir William Congreve (exh. RA, 1812; NPG); John Dalton (exh. Society of British Artists, 1825; Manchester University), and Sir Humphry Davy (exh. RA, 1822). Also of interest are his <span class="italic">King John Signing Magna Charta</span> painted for the duke of Norfolk and later executed in stained glass, and <span class="italic">A Game at Chess</span> (exh. British Institution, 1837; Castle Museum and Art Gallery, Nottingham) which includes a self-portrait of Lonsdale and portraits of his three sons.<br>
<br>Commentators note Lonsdale's bold, accurate portrayal of faces with &#145;little attempt at flattery&#146;  (Redgrave, <span class="italic">Artists</span>, 75). This may explain why his clientele was &#145;chiefly confined to male sitters&#146;  (Bryan, <span class="italic">Painters</span>, 3.244). Lonsdale died at his home in Berners Street on 17 January 1839. A memorial to him and his wife was placed in St Mary's Priory church, Lancaster.<br>
