<span class="headword">Taylor,  Edward</span>  (<em>c.</em>1642&#150;1729), <span class="occ">minister in America and poet</span>, was born in Sketchley, Leicestershire, the son of William Taylor, a yeoman farmer, and his wife, Margaret. Taylor's extant correspondence shows that he had at least two siblings: a brother, Richard, and another brother, Joseph, whose wife was named Alice. While his infancy was punctuated by the vicissitudes of the civil war, after 1650 Taylor's childhood and teenage years passed in relatively undisturbed comfort on his parents' productive farm. According to his obituary, printed in the <span class="italic">Boston Weekly News-Letter</span> in August 1729, the young Taylor attended the local grammar school, where he was so proficient a scholar that he became himself &#145;qualified to keep a School&#146; and did so for a portion of a year at Bagworth, Leicestershire.<br>
<br>Ezra Stiles, a grandson of Taylor and one of Yale University's early presidents, wrote that his grandfather &#145;was a vigorous Advocate of Oliver Cromwell&#146;  (Stanford, &#145;Edward Taylor&#146;, 320). Upon the Restoration, however, Taylor's good fortunes began to shift. When in 1662 Charles II issued the <span class="roman">Act of Uniformity</span>, compelling schoolmasters, like the clergy, to accept the <span class="roman">Book of Common Prayer</span> in its entirety and abjure the solemn league and covenant, Taylor became restive, but it was the <span class="roman">Conventicle Act</span> of 1664, which made it illegal for Taylor and other nonconformists to practise their faith in &#145;conventicles&#146;, or groups of more than five, that forced him to consider another venue where he might worship in peace. By the middle to late 1660s Taylor had set his eyes on emigration to the Massachusetts Bay colony.<br>
<br>Taylor set sail for Boston on 26 April 1668. In his diary, begun on the voyage, Taylor was scrupulous to record his unpleasant bouts of seasickness and was careful to note that sabbath exercises for the duration of the journey fell to him, predicting his later vocation. In a particularly diverting passage the young man remarks that, just before going to sleep one evening, he read &#145;the fourth chapter of <span class="roman">John</span> in Greek&#146;  (&#145;Diary&#146;, 12), indicating that his knowledge far exceeded that taught at New England's Latin grammar schools of this period. Despite his sessions of seasickness Taylor devoted a great portion of the diary to close observations of birds, fish, and debris encountered by the vessel, suggesting the keen interest in nature he would later display in his poetry.<br>
<br>Upon arrival in Boston, Taylor declared his intentions to become &#145;settled in the college&#146; of Harvard  (&#145;Diary&#146;, 15), and he recorded his admission to the college on 23 July 1668. He graduated BA in 1671, and proceeded MA in 1674. After receiving his first degree Taylor at first hoped to continue at the college as one of its tutors, but he soon took the opportunity to serve as minister to Westfield, Massachusetts, where he delivered his first sermon on 3 December 1671.<br>
<br>By 1673 Taylor had been given a parsonage and a meeting-house, which doubled as a fort for protection against native Americans. He then turned his attention towards the prospect of marriage. His desires were realized soon after he met Elizabeth Fitch (<i>d</i>. 1689) from Norwich, Massachusetts, whom he married in 1674. Taylor's sincere and moving courtship of Elizabeth is recorded in a letter and an elaborate acrostic poem dated 8 July 1674 and in another poem of 27 August 1674; the acrostic poem is particularly noteworthy as it is as ingenious in its complex architecture (a heart surrounded by a &#145;ring of love&#146;, encased in a triangle celebrating the Trinity, with the words of the poem entwined about these figures) as it is touching in its sentiment.<br>
<br>Taylor was not ordained until 27 August 1679 because of the distractions provoked by the conflict known as King Philip's War. Not long after his ordination he composed one of his major poems, <span class="italic">Gods Determinations Touching his Elect</span>. Taylor apparently wrote this long, often dramatic, tract as an aide to his parishioners wishing instruction in the church's catechism; while he may have had plans to publish <span class="italic">Gods Determinations</span>, he almost certainly allowed it to be circulated in manuscript among his parishioners.<br>
<br>Many of his occasional poems, such as the well-known &#145;Upon the sweeping flood Aug: 13.14, 1683&#146;, &#145;Upon a wasp child with cold&#146;, &#145;Huswifery&#146;, and &#145;Upon a spider catching a fly&#146;, were composed during this same period, and Taylor allowed Cotton Mather to publish two stanzas from &#145;Upon wedlock, and death of children&#146; in his <span class="italic">Right Thoughts in Sad Hours</span> (1689). Having written thousands of lines of poetry, from his adolescence until his last years, Taylor permitted only these two stanzas to appear during his lifetime. The wonder is that Taylor, whose busy schedule demanded he serve his parish as physician as well as pastor and spiritual adviser, could have found the time to construct such a large poetic opus.<br>
<br>Taylor's reputation as a poet rests primarily on his <span class="italic">Preparatory Meditations, First and Second Series</span>, a collection of poems numbering nearly 220, many of which were composed in preparation for the administration of the eucharist. Like the sermons Taylor's poems, with the exception of the two stanzas which appeared in 1689, only began appearing in print in the 1930s.<br>
<br>Taylor's poetry is marked by his positive application of classical knowledge, in contrast to the hostility towards the ancient world and mythology conventionally expected from puritan writers. While Taylor's homilies include negative anecdotes and examples from the ancient classical world, his <span class="italic">Preparatory Meditations</span>, which should be understood as his private colloquies with his idea of God, contain many classical references employed in the positive contexts one might expect from a recipient of the typical Renaissance college education that Taylor obtained at Harvard. In the <span class="italic">Preparatory Meditations</span> he faithfully practised the <i>meditatio</i>, deriving from the classical rhetorical exercise of memory (imagination and the senses), understanding (reason), and will (resolve to act upon instruction from the understanding), a rhetorical praxis early adapted to Christian rhetoric by such church fathers as Augustine.<br>
<br>The classicism which characterizes his best poetry yields to Taylor's orthodox theology expressed in the plain, unadorned style of his sermons. This same orthodoxy characterized his public service to his community. In 1688, for example, Solomon Stoddard, who had been librarian at Harvard during Taylor's college days, established in his own parish the controversial half-way covenant, by which unregenerate sinners were allowed to participate in the performance of the eucharist. This practice so offended the orthodox Taylor that he denounced both Stoddard and the half-way covenant from his pulpit on many occasions. During this same period, moreover, tragedy struck the Taylor family with stubborn persistence. Elizabeth Taylor dutifully bore eight children: Samuel, Elizabeth, James, Abigail, Bathsheba, Elizabeth (the first Elizabeth had died), Mary, and Hezekiah. She died on 7 July 1689 soon after the birth of Hezekiah. Taylor memorialized his intense grief for Elizabeth in one of the most moving of his many elegies wherein he declares his &#145;Onely Dove&#146;  (<span class="italic">Poems</span>, 473) has now his &#145;harp &hellip; turned to mourning&#146;  (ibid., 472); &#145;Not Proud &hellip; [but] Grave, Courteous, ever good&#146;, Elizabeth Taylor was one who &#145;I'th' golden mean did goe&#146;  (ibid., 474)&#151;that is, her life displayed the principal classical virtue, moderation.<br>
<br>Three years passed before Taylor married again. His second wife was Ruth Wyllys (<i>d</i>. 1729/1730), from Hartford, Connecticut, whom he married at Westfield on 2 June 1692, and who survived her husband by about six months. With her Taylor had six more children: Ruth, Naomi, Anna, Mekitabel, Keziah, and Eldad. During Taylor's second marriage he renewed his friendship with the colonial merchant and diarist Samuel Sewall, with whom he had shared a room at Harvard. In 1705 Taylor wrote a poem of 190 verses about the discovery of huge bones (probably those of a mastodon) that had been unearthed at Claverack not far from Albany, New York. It is a testament to Taylor's reputation for learning that at least two teeth from this &#145;monster&#146; were brought to him at Westfield for his investigation. Towards the end of his life, Taylor embarked upon the construction of a long poem of over 20,000 lines. He left this substantial tract untitled, although his twentieth-century editor, Donald E. Stanford, gave it the title <span class="italic">A Metrical History of Christianity</span>; again, Taylor probably shared this work with his parishioners for purposes of instruction.<br>
<br>Taylor died on 24 June 1729 at Westfield, Massachusetts, where he was buried. He left his parish the solid legacy of his orthodox, puritan theology, a tradition of thorough medical care (Taylor's personal library included many books on surgery and pharmacology), and a sizeable body of sensitive and intellectually challenging poetry. While most of his poetic <i>&#339;uvre</i> remained unknown to Westfield's denizens, this extensive and learned collection constitutes some of the best poetry written in America before 1800. Of this collection, it is the <span class="italic">Preparatory Meditations</span>, the elegies, and the several occasional pieces which establish Edward Taylor's place among the best of British American colonial poets. Thomas H. Johnson initiated the recovery of Taylor's poems and prose works when in 1937 he published selections from the 400-page manuscript of the poems left by Taylor and housed in the Yale University Library since 1883. A more complete edition of the poems appeared in 1960 as <span class="italic">The Poems of Edward Taylor</span>, edited by D. E. Stanford.<br>
