<span class="headword">Allbeury,  Theodore Edward Le Bouthillier <span class="st"> [Ted]</span></span>  (1917&#150;2005), <span class="occ">intelligence officer and novelist</span>, was born on 24 October 1917 at 478 Manchester Road, Stockport, Lancashire, the son of Theodore Allbeury, cotton goods buyer, and his wife, Florence, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Bailey. He had one sister. His father died when Allbeury was young, though the circumstances are unclear; Allbeury later claimed both that his father was an officer in the Black Watch, killed a few days before the armistice in 1918 (no such casualty is recorded by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission), and that he died in Africa when Allbeury was five. Allbeury was prone to story-telling about his own life. After his father's death he and his mother and sister lived first in Birmingham, where he attended Slade primary school in Erdington, then in Ilford, where he attended Ilford county high school, then again in Birmingham, where he attended the King Edward VI Grammar School in Aston. He showed a particular flair for art, and on leaving school worked in the drawing office of an iron foundry, while also taking evening classes and teaching himself French and German.<br>
<br>Shortly after the outbreak of the Second World War Allbeury responded to an advertisement in <span class="italic">The Times</span> seeking linguists for special work with the army. He was interviewed in the back room of a barber's shop off Trafalgar Square, an encounter that he later wrote into several of his novels. Accepted into the intelligence corps, he served in Somalia, Ethiopia, the Sudan, Italy, and finally occupied Germany. He was demobilized in 1947 with the rank of lieutenant-colonel.<br>
<br>It is unclear whether, to what extent, and how long Allbeury continued in intelligence work after his official release in 1947; his own accounts varied. From the 1950s through to the late 1970s he worked in advertising and public relations, except for a few years in the early 1960s when he farmed chickens on the Isle of Oxney, Kent (which he found tedious and unrewarding). In the late 1950s he ran J. W. Southcombe, an advertising agency, and in 1964 he co-founded Allbeury Coombs &amp; Partners. In 1965 he took over a pirate radio station, King Radio, which broadcast from the Red Sands fort in the Thames estuary. He renamed the station Radio 390 (from its wavelength) and relaunched it to provide middle-of-the-road, &#145;easy listening&#146; music, mainly to housewives. It broadcast Allbeury's own show, <span class="italic">Red Sands Rendezvous</span>. The station was closed, along with other pirate radio stations, in 1967. In 1968 Allbeury stood unsuccessfully as a Liberal candidate at Petersfield. He was married several times, the last on 13 May 1972 to Grazyna Maria [Graz] Felinska (<i>d</i>. 1999), a 25-year-old secretary, and daughter of Richard Marian Felinski, businessman. He had a son and three daughters in total.<br>
<br>It was the experience of losing contact with one of his daughters that in part inspired Allbeury to write his first novel, <span class="italic">A Choice of Enemies</span> (1973), a spy thriller set largely in occupied Germany. Its main protagonist, Ted Bailey, clearly based in part on Allbeury himself, is sympathetically portrayed, faced with a recurrent choice between obeying orders and following his conscience (the latter with dire consequences). Allbeury went on to write some forty books under his own name, as well as others under the pseudonyms Richard Butler and Patrick Kelly; at one point he was publishing four books a year. Most were spy thrillers, set apart from most others in that genre by their preoccupation with character and psychology rather than action and gadgetry, though his early books in particular contained their fair share of spy chases. Perhaps his best books were <span class="italic">The Lantern Network</span> (1978), a story about honour and betrayal in the Special Operations Executive in France, and a sequel, <span class="italic">As Time Goes By</span> (1994), written from the perspective of its women agents in France. Other notable books included <span class="italic">The Special Collection</span> (1975), about KGB infiltration of British trade unions, and <span class="italic">The Alpha List</span> (1979), in which the narrator has to investigate his closest friend. Allbeury's books were commercially successful, and in one year he received a penny more under public lending right than Barbara Cartland, an achievement he relished.<br>
<br>Allbeury gradually gave up his work in advertising in order to concentrate on writing. He continued writing into his eighties, his last book published in his own lifetime being <span class="italic">Hostage</span> (2004). Several more were published after his death. The death of his wife, Grazyna, was a hard blow. Living latterly at 7 Lanthorne Mews, Tunbridge Wells, he died on 4 December 2005 at the Kent and Sussex Hospital, Tunbridge Wells, of bronchopneumonia. He was survived by his four children.<br>
