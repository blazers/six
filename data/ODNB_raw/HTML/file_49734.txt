<span class="headword">Valentine,  James</span>  (1815&#150;1879), <span class="occ">engraver and photographer</span>, was born on 12 June 1815 in Dundee, the second of the five children of John Valentine (1792&#150;1868), linen weaver, and his wife, Mary Watson (<i>bap</i>. 1790, <i>d</i>. 1866), daughter of Andrew Watson, a Dundee shipmaster and his wife, Elizabeth Elder. After schooling in Dundee, he was sent to Edinburgh to study art. He returned to Dundee in 1832 to set up an engraving and copperplate printing business with his father, who had taken up a new trade cutting wooden blocks for linen printing. On 28 August 1837 he married Christina Marshall (1812/13&#150;1842), daughter of John Marshall, shoemaker. In June 1838, days before the birth of his first child, he announced that he was no longer a partner in Valentine &amp; Son and was setting up on his own account as an engraver and copperplate and lithographic printer in the Overgate in Dundee. After giving birth to their third child in November 1841, his wife died on 3 May 1842 of lung disease. The only son of this marriage, John (1841&#150;1867), became a pioneer photographer in Hawaii. On 5 December 1843 James Valentine married his second wife, Rachel Dobson (1817&#150;1879), in Glasgow.<br>
<br>Valentine prospered; he rarely described himself in the same way twice in the Dundee directory, but the mainstay of his business was the engraving, printing, and supplying of business stationery. In 1840 he became a member of the guildry and in 1845 a burgess, both evidence of his progress in the Dundee business establishment. About 1849 he met the colourful American social campaigner Elihu Burritt; he was involved in publicity for Burritt's visit to Dundee, producing engraved illustrated envelopes supporting his varied causes, which included universal brotherhood, arbitration for war, freedom of commerce, and (more mundanely) penny postage overseas. By 1851 Valentine had fourteen employees; in that year he decided to add portrait photography to his firm's activities, having become interested in this new invention as an aid to engraving. To equip himself, he studied &#145;in M. Billoch's photographic academy in Paris&#146; and corresponded &#145;with some of the best French and English photographers&#146;  (Dundee Public Library, Lamb MS 215 (2)).<br>
<br>This enterprise proved to be so profitable that in 1855 Valentine erected one of the largest photographic glasshouses in Britain. By the end of the decade portrait photography came first in his advertisements and he was retailing photographs of local worthies. In the early 1860s&#151;after instruction in the studio of Francis Frith in Reigate, Surrey&#151;he added landscape photography to his repertory, aided by the ingenious conversion of a barouche into a mobile dark-room and by the entry into the business of his eldest son by his second marriage, William Dobson Valentine. In 1864 he solicited the Queen Victoria's attention with topographical photographs, including one of Queenswell in Glen Mark, and was rewarded with commissions for views of Scottish scenery. In 1868 he obtained the royal warrant as &#145;photographer to the queen&#146;, the second in Scotland to do so after George Washington Wilson of Aberdeen. This side of his business rapidly developed: the sale of view scraps for prices ranging from 1<i>s</i>. to 3<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>. and elegant albums from half a guinea to 12 guineas gave rise to a large printing works at 152 and 154 Perth Road, Dundee. The 12,000 wet-plate collodion negatives which Valentine prepared were not markedly different in quality from those of his competitors in the landscape photograph trade aiming at upper- and middle-class tourists, but he excelled in the organization of his business and the presentation of his products.<br>
<br>James Valentine was a staunch member of the Congregational church, initially attending the Castle Street Chapel and from 1867, after a disagreement when he headed a list of eighty-three dissident members, becoming a member of the Panmure Street Chapel. (His son James (1846&#150;1918) became a Congregational minister at Peterborough.) He died at his home, 19 Thomson Street, Dundee, on 19 June 1879 and was buried in Balgay cemetery in Dundee. His second wife survived him by seven weeks. He had laid the foundations of a firm which, under his sons and grandsons, became the longest-surviving and possibly the largest of British photographic publishers. He was immediately succeeded by his sons William Dobson Valentine (1844&#150;1907) and George Dobson Valentine (1852&#150;1890). The main collection of James Valentine's photographs is in the Valentine archive in St Andrews University Library, but examples are also found in most general photograph collections in Britain and in many overseas.<br>
