<span class="headword">Kirke,  Thomas</span>  (1650&#150;1706), <span class="occ">antiquary and topographer</span>, born on 22 December 1650, was the eldest son of Gilbert Kirke (1624&#150;1663) of Cookridge, near Leeds, and his wife, Margaret Layton (<i>d</i>. 1688), daughter of Francis Layton of Rawden, Yorkshire. On 28 May 1668 Kirke matriculated at Trinity College, Cambridge, where his tutor was the Yorkshire antiquary and cleric Miles Gale, but he did not graduate.<br>
<br>Kirke was also a distant relative and close acquaintance of another Yorkshire scholar and topographer Ralph Thoresby, who acknowledged that &#145;my dear friend&#146;, or &#145;mon cher ami, Mr. Kirk&#146; had often accompanied him on his antiquarian rambles  (<span class="italic">Diary of Ralph Thorseby</span>, 1.380, 390). At Cookridge Kirke, a virtuoso engaging in a wide range of intellectual and practical activities, himself designed a &#145;most surprizing Labyrinth&#146;, or maze, with over 300 separate vistas which attracted admiring visits from &#145;almost all Foreigners and Gentlemen of Curiosity of our own Nation&#146;  (Thoresby, <span class="italic">Ducatus Leodiensis</span>, 159). In May 1677 Kirke undertook a three-month tour of Scotland, covering nearly 1000 miles and incorporating visits to Edinburgh, St Andrews, Aberdeen, Inverness, the Orkney Islands, Perth, Stirling, and Glasgow. From his observations he anonymously published a polemical pamphlet in 1679 entitled <span class="italic">A Modern Account of Scotland &hellip; Written from Thence by an English Gentleman</span>. According to Kirke's splenetic and caustic narrative, the Scots were not only &#145;Proud, Arrogant, Vain-glorious boasters, Bloody, Barbarous and Inhuman Butchers&#146;, but also perfect &#145;English-haters&#146;, who &#145;shew their pride in exalting themselves and depressing their Neighbours&#146;  (Kirke, 11). During his travels Kirke had however also kept a detailed topographical journal which Thoresby subsequently transcribed and which was later included as an appendix to Thoresby's own posthumously published diary and correspondence.<br>
<br>On 11 July 1678 Kirke had married Rosamund (1661&#150;1688), daughter and coheir of Robert Abbott of Purston Jacklin, with whom he had two sons and two daughters. She died on 30 August 1688.<br>
<br>On 30 November 1693 Kirke was elected a fellow of the Royal Society and contributed an account of an orphaned lamb being successfully suckled by a castrated ram to the society's <span class="italic">Philosophical Transactions</span> the following year.<br>
<br>After Kirke's death on 24 April 1706 Thoresby claimed to have composed a memoir of Kirke for inclusion in his projected topography of Leeds. Although Thoresby's work was never completed, there survives an anonymous poetical dialogue between Kirke's ghost and his former Cambridge tutor, Gale, which includes a description of various curiosities contained in Kirke's antiquarian museum at Cookridge  (BL, Add. MS 4459). The collection was, however, sold by auction in 1710, following the death of Kirke's surviving son, Thomas, the previous year.<br>
