<span class="headword">Walker,  Robert</span>  (1801&#150;1865), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and physicist</span>, was born in Dover, the third of at least five sons of Robert Walker, gentleman, and his wife, Elizabeth Mozier, both of Dover. On 20 January 1819 he entered Wadham College, Oxford, where he was an exhibitioner. He obtained a second class in <i>literae humaniores</i> and a first in mathematics in 1822. He took holy orders as a deacon in 1826, and was ordained priest in 1827. Walker was appointed junior chaplain of Wadham College in 1826, but had to relinquish the post when he married, in 1831, Elizabeth Holdsworth of Alverstoke, Hampshire; they had at least two sons and two daughters, of whom the elder son, Robert Holdsworth Walker (<i>b</i>. 1834), followed his father to Wadham and into the teaching profession.<br>
<br>As early as 1826 Walker served as a university examiner in mathematics, the first of many occasions. From 1828 until 1853 he was mathematics tutor of Wadham College, though he was never a fellow. He was elected FRS in 1831. In 1839 he succeeded Stephen Rigaud as reader in experimental philosophy (physics) at Oxford, becoming responsible not only for a well-established course but also for an extensive collection of apparatus with an endowment for its development. One of the first pieces that he added was the Oxford dry pile, an extremely durable battery. Walker's appointment as reader (upgraded to professor in 1860) was significant, for he was the first to hold the post in its own right, rather than annexed to a professorship in another subject.<br>
<br>Inspired by the meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of Science in Oxford in 1847, at which he was one of the local secretaries and president of the physics section, Walker, along with Henry Acland, Charles Daubeny, and Philip Duncan, launched a vigorous campaign for the reform of scientific education in Oxford. The eventual results were the creation of a new degree in natural science in 1850 and the building of a new scientific teaching centre, which became known as the university museum. Walker was one of the most active members of the steering committee appointed in 1853 to establish the museum; and as secretary of the British Association in 1859&#150;61 he helped organize the Oxford meeting of 1860, which inaugurated the museum but became famous for its discussion of Darwinism.<br>
<br>Walker was not an original physicist, but kept pace with the work of his great contemporaries in order to demonstrate their experiments to his students, and also to senior members of the university in the Ashmolean Society. He made his lecture demonstrations as lively as possible in order to capture the interest of the undergraduates. A brief account of them occurs in the memoirs of William Tuckwell.<br>
<br>Walker's vocation as a clergyman was not eclipsed by his scientific career. He was one of the university's select preachers in 1840&#150;42 and 1847&#150;9, and became vicar of Culham, Oxfordshire, in 1848, moving with his family to Culham vicarage. He resigned this living in 1862. Little is known about Walker's personality, though Tuckwell describes him as cheery. He died at Rose Hill, Iffley, near Oxford, on 28 September 1865.<br>
