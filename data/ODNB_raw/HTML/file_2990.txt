<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Bourchier,  John</span>, second Baron Berners  (<em>c.</em>1467&#150;1533), <span class="occ">soldier, diplomat, and translator</span>, was the son of Sir Humphrey Bourchier (<i>d</i>. 1471) and Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1497), daughter and sole heir of Frederick Tilney of Boston, Lincolnshire. His father, a Yorkist, was killed at the battle of Barnet in 1471, and Berners succeeded to the barony at the age of seven when his grandfather died in 1474. The family was a distinguished one: one of his grandfather's brothers was summoned to parliament as Baron Fitzwarine in 1449, another was created earl of Essex in 1461, and a third became archbishop of Canterbury in 1454. His paternal great-grandmother Anne was the daughter of Thomas of Woodstock, sixth son of Edward III.<h2>
<a name="Earlylifeandemployment"></a>Early life and employment</h2>After the death of Berners's father his mother married Thomas Howard, created second duke of Norfolk in 1514. The first duke, John Howard (<i>d</i>. 1485), was Berners's guardian and Berners himself married Katherine (<i>d</i>. 1536), John's daughter from his second marriage. (Berners's stepfather, Thomas, was the son of John's first wife, Katherine Moleyns.) Berners had two legitimate children, both daughters. Mary, the elder daughter, married Alexander Unton of Wadley, but was childless and predeceased her father. The younger daughter, Jane, married Sir Edmund Knyvet, sergeant-porter to Henry VIII; heir to Berners's English properties, she lived until 1561. In his will Berners also named three illegitimate sons, Humphrey, James, and George, and he also had a daughter Ursula, who married Sir William Sherington. Berners's portrait, formerly attributed to Holbein, but in fact by an unknown Flemish artist, hangs in the National Portrait Gallery.<br>
<br>Anthony Wood claims that Berners was educated at Balliol College, Oxford, but there is no evidence to substantiate this; Wood probably confused him with his distant relative John Bourchier, son of Lord Fitzwarine. At the time of the marriage of Richard, second son of Edward IV, on 17 January 1478 Berners was knighted. According to Richard Grafton's continuation of Hardyng's chronicle he was involved in the attempt to put Henry Tudor on the throne in 1484 and subsequently fled to Brittany. Probably as a consequence of his connection with Thomas Howard, who was the chief general in England, he contracted in 1492 to &#145;serve the king in his warres beyond see on hole yeere with two speres&#146;  (Rymer, <span class="italic">Foedera</span>, 12.479), and in 1497 he took part in the suppression of Perkin Warbeck's rebellion. He was first summoned to parliament on 14 October 1495 and was regular in his attendance when in England. He was last summoned on 9 August 1529.<h2>
<a name="Servicesoverseas"></a>Services overseas</h2>In Henry VIII's reign Berners acted as a soldier and diplomat. In 1513 he took part in the French campaign and then seems to have joined his half-brother, Lord Thomas Howard, who had been made lord admiral on 2 May 1513, in Scotland and to have acted as marshal to the army. After peace had been restored with France, Norfolk led the group that escorted Princess Mary to France to marry Louis XII; Howard, now earl of Surrey, was a member of the entourage and Berners was chosen to be Mary's chamberlain. The French, however, demanded the dismissal of all her menservants and Henry Courtenay, earl of Devon, was appointed to wait on her instead. In May 1514 Berners was granted the chancellorship of the exchequer for life in reverson after Sir Thomas Lovell. He received a new grant on 29 May 1516 and finally succeeded to the office after the death of Lovell on 24 May 1524, being admitted on 14 July 1524. In 1518 Berners was sent on a special mission to Spain with John Kite, archbishop of Armagh, as part of a scheme for a general peace in Europe. Throughout the mission the ambassadors were plagued with financial problems, Berners reporting to Wolsey on 26 July that &#145;we lye here with most charge and expence, horse and man, &amp; in most scarcity of all good things as well meat as drink, that may be thought&#146;  (<span class="italic">LP Henry VIII</span>, 2/2, no. 4342). But although seriously ill with gout for much of the time, he nevertheless sent a spirited report back to Henry VIII on the customs at the Spanish court. Berners was not present at the Field of Cloth of Gold in 1520, as has been generally stated, but remained with the council in London. On 28 November 1520 Henry appointed him deputy of Calais and he occupied that position until 1526 when he was replaced by Sir Robert Wingfield. He then returned to England, but took up the Calais appointment again in 1531, on condition of paying Wingfield 100 marks per annum during his tenure of office. His successor as deputy was Arthur Plantagenet, Viscount Lisle.<br>
<br>Berners became heavily involved in lawsuits over his properties in England, and had to borrow money from the king as early as 1511. His debts continued to grow and in 1532 Henry ordered his agents to watch over Berners's personal effects. After Berners's death at Calais on 16 March 1533 his half-brother Lord Edmund Howard, controller of Calais, was directed to seize all his goods in Calais for the crown. By the terms of his will, dated 3 March 1533 and proved on 4 February 1534, Berners left his great tenement in Calais to Sir Francis Hastings, later second earl of Huntingdon, and one of the executors of his will. He also left Lord Edmund a standing cup of silver. In an attempt to deal with a debt of &pound;500 he requested the king to accept after his wife's death Staffordshire properties settled on her by deed of jointure. He was buried in the parish church in Calais.<h2>
<a name="Chivalricromances"></a>Chivalric romances</h2>Like his more famous predecessor Sir Thomas Malory, Lord Berners combined an active military life with a strong literary bent&#151;the <i>post mortem</i> inventory of his goods listed eighty books in his study&#151;and he was an accomplished translator both of French and Spanish texts. <span class="italic">Arthur of Lytell Brytayne</span>, probably his earliest work, dates to the second decade of the sixteenth century. It is a translation of <span class="italic">Artus de la Petite Bretagne</span>, a fourteenth-century prose romance which was first printed in Lyons in 1493; Berners seems to have made use of the second version of 1496. The first surviving edition of Berners's translation was printed by Robert Redborne, perhaps <i>c</i>.1560, and there was another edition in 1582 (STC 807, 808). Berners's statement that he gave up the translation after a few pages because of the fantastic nature of the story but picked up again once he realized the text had a moral purpose is probably conventional rather than autobiographical and may be in direct imitation of Caxton, thus showing the literary tradition in which Berners was situating himself. The first edition of the French prose version of <span class="italic">Huon de Bordeaux</span>, another exemplary chivalric romance of which Berners's <span class="italic">Huon of Burdeux</span> is a translation, was published by Michel le Noir in 1513. The earliest surviving edition of Berners's translation, now in private ownership and unavailable for inspection, is undated, but the second was printed in 1601 (STC 13998.5, 13999). The undated edition was issued from the press of Julian Notary, perhaps as early as <i>c</i>.1515. Although the first edition is described as imperfect at beginning and end, the second has a preface and colophon in which it is stated that the earl of Huntingdon, Lord Hastings, requested the translation and sponsored the printing. It also gives a date of 1570. There are problems determining which earl of Huntingdon is meant, but it is likely that the reference is to Francis Hastings, the second earl. In this case, there must have been a lost edition, in which the preface and colophon first appeared, printed for Hastings between his creation as earl in 1545 and his death in 1561, and perhaps a 1570 edition as well.<br>
<br>Berners's best-known work is his translation of Froissart's chronicles, begun soon after 15 August 1521 when Henry VIII signed the treaty of Bruges, undertaking to declare war on France the following year. According to Berners's preface, the project was undertaken at Henry VIII's express command. The Tudor arms appear on the verso of the title page. The translation, made from one of the early printed editions in four books, was no doubt intended to remind &#145;noble gentlemen&#146; of their ancient right to France and was meant to spur them on to bravery by enabling them &#145;to see, behold, and read the high enterprises, famous acts, and glorious deeds done and achieved by their valiant ancestors&#146;. The first volume, completed in 1522, was printed by Richard Pynson on 28 January 1523 (STC 11396). According to the colophon the second volume was finished on 10 March 1525 and was printed on 31 August (STC 11397), that is the day after the treaty to end the war with France was signed at The More. Pynson's device is found at the end of the second volume and he may have shared the costs of publication. Lord Berners's translation of Froissart was republished in the <span class="roman">Tudor Translations</span> series in six volumes edited by W. P. Ker (1901&#150;3).<h2>
<a name="Latertranslations"></a>Later translations</h2>Berners's first three translations were all of chivalric romances and histories of the type favoured by Caxton, and the prose style tends to be old-fashioned as well. After his return to England in 1526 Berners's choice of material and manner of expression changed&#151;perhaps as a result of exposure to new literary trends&#151;and his last two translations were of more up-to-date works by Spanish authors. Berners himself claimed that he undertook the translations at the request of the children of his sister Margaret, Lady Bryan, both of whom were well connected in court circles. His niece Elizabeth, the wife of one of Henry's former minions, Sir Nicholas Carew, master of the horse, asked him to translate Diego de San Pedro's <span class="italic">C&aacute;rcel de amor</span>. The resulting work, <span class="italic">The Castell of Love</span>, is a translation from the French version, <span class="italic">La prison damours</span>, published in 1525, but it includes a preface first found in the French edition of 1526, which thus gives a <i>terminus a quo</i> for its production. It also contains a continuation by Nicolas Nu&ntilde;ez, not found in any of the surviving early French editions, and Berners translated directly from the Spanish in this section. He consulted the Spanish original in the earlier parts too. There is no evidence that the <span class="italic">Castell of Love</span> was published during Berners's lifetime, and the first surviving edition was printed by John Turke <i>c</i>.1548, the second by Robert Wyer <i>c</i>.1552, and the third by J. King <i>c</i>.1555 (STC 21739.5&#150;42). Berners's last work, <span class="italic">The Golden Boke of Marcus Aurelius</span>, derives from the French translation by Ren&eacute; Berthault (1531) of Antonio de Guevara's <span class="italic">Libro aureo de Marco Aurelio</span>. According to the colophon Berners completed the work on 10 March 1532; it was undertaken at the request of Sir Francis Bryan, who was a close associate of Henry VIII as well as the brother of Lady Carew. Bryan, who himself translated another work by Guevara, was probably responsible for the publication in 1535 by Thomas Berthelet (STC 12436), and the work went through at least ten editions by 1586.<br>
<br>In his <span class="italic">Index Britanniae scriptorum</span> John Bale attributes two other works to Berners&#151;a comedy, <span class="italic">Ite in vineam</span> and a <span class="italic">De officiis Calesianorum</span>&#151;on the authority of unnamed individuals from Calais (&#145;ex testibus Calesiensibus&#146;). There are no records of the former, but the latter may be the &#145;Ordinances for watch and ward of Calais&#146; (BL, Cotton MS Faustina E. vii, fols. 89&#150;102) printed in <span class="italic">The Chronicle of Calais</span>, edited by J. G. Nichols (London, 1846), pages 140&#150;62. Bale also claims that Berners translated many books from Italian, but he gives no authority for the statement.<br>
<br>No manuscripts of any of Berners's works survive and no printed books from his library can be identified. When Lady Carew's husband was executed in 1539 his goods were sequestered and Beddington Place fell to Henry VIII. According to a <i>post mortem</i> inventory of Henry VIII's possessions, there were twenty books at Beddington. Of these, ten were copies of Froissart&#151;one copy described as &#145;Frosort&#146;, four copies of the &#145;premier volume of Froscoit&#146;, three copies of the &#145;secund volume de Froscoit/Frosart&#146;, and two of the &#145;third volume&#146;. These were almost certainly books acquired by Lady Carew from her uncle. At Henry's palace at Westminster there were also copies of <span class="italic">La prison damours</span> and the <span class="italic">Livre dor&eacute; de Marc Aurele</span> in the editions used by Berners, but this is no doubt a coincidence.<br>
