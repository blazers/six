<span class="headword">Baines, Sir  Frank</span>  (1877&#150;1933), <span class="occ">architect and architectural preservationist</span>, was born at 1 Maria Terrace, Stepney, Middlesex, on 7 December 1877, the fourth child of Samuel Baines (1840&#150;1913), coppersmith, and his wife, Elizabeth, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Coates. Though Baines habitually stated that he was educated privately, he probably attended the Trafalgar Square special board school, and certainly studied at the People's Palace School, Mile End, where he was awarded the governors' prize for freehand drawing and mathematics in his final year. While at the school he came under the influence of Toynbee Hall teachers such as Arthur Pillans Laurie and C. R. Ashbee. With his elder brother, Hubert (1874&#150;1953), Baines was a member of the boys' club formed by these and other teachers. On leaving school in 1892, and like his brother before him, Frank was apprenticed to Ashbee, who at that time was in practice at Essex House, Mile End Road. Hubert was a particular favourite of Ashbee, but Frank seems not to feature in his records.<br>
<br>In 1895, and having misrepresented his age, Baines was appointed to the office of works as a junior draughtsman at 15<i>s</i>. a week. Following encouragement from his superiors, he applied for and was promoted assistant architect, second class, in 1911. Thereafter, his rise was meteoric, and in 1920 he was appointed, on an annual salary of &pound;1500, as director of works and chief architect&#151;with responsibility for royal palaces, the Palace of Westminster, public and historic buildings, and ancient monuments. Prior to 1914 Baines was employed mostly on work relating to historic monuments, in which he had gained a reputation for the stabilizing and preservation&#151;not restoration&#151;of the nation's patrimony. He was appointed MVO for his work at Caernarvon Castle in connection with the investiture of the prince of Wales in July 1911. Other work undertaken from 1912 included projects at Buckingham, Hampton Court, and Eltham palaces, and at the medieval religious abbeys of Tintern, Byland, Rievaulx, Jedburgh, Melrose, and Dryburgh. In June 1914 he issued a report on the decayed condition of the timber hammerbeam roof of Westminster Hall at the Palace of Westminster. The roof, which was constructed when the hall was remodelled in the late fourteenth century, is the largest surviving medieval hammerbeam structure in northern Europe. Baines had examined the timbers in 1913 when he found the wood decayed by beetle larvae and the structure significantly weakened. Drawing on his experience at Eltham Palace (1912&#150;13), Baines proposed the insertion of steel reinforcements within the timbers which, invisible from the ground, would allow as much of the medieval material as possible to remain in place. Work to insert 350 tons of steel into the roof began in the early 1920s and was concluded by late 1922. The saving of the roof brought immediate and international recognition and its completion was marked by a private visit by George V and a state ceremony on 17 July 1923.<br>
<br>Baines was attached to the Ministry of Munitions during the First World War. His career as an architect progressed rapidly in the war years and saw him take on responsibility for building projects costing up to &pound;80 million. His principal works were the construction of prefabricated factories and houses for munitions workers, both of which were undertaken with great skill and speed. Baines's greenfield site housing projects&#151;of which Well Hall, Eltham (1915), and Roe Green, Kingsbury (1917&#150;19), were the prime examples&#151;were executed in an arts and crafts style, in which he had been taught by Ashbee and which he made his own. Both estates, built to accommodate workers at the Royal Arsenal, Woolwich, and Hendon's Aircraft Manufacturing Company (Airco) respectively, were planned within three days, with construction beginning at Eltham no more than a week later. Baines's preference for low density plotting and for the domesticated arts and crafts style meant that, despite their rapid execution, both estates had the appearance of established villages in south Suffolk or north Essex. Well Hall has since drawn particular praise as a &#145;tour de force of picturesque design&#146;  (Pevsner, 306) and Baines's influence ensured the continuation of the arts and crafts style in council housing well into the mid-twentieth century. At the Sunray estate, Herne Hill (1920&#150;21), he also demonstrated his ability to build without his earlier flamboyance in a project commended for its careful plotting and rapid completion. Baines also had control of rebuilding after the chemical works explosion at Silvertown, east London, in January 1917, and with Sir Lionel Earle, permanent secretary at the office of works, he was responsible&#151;in the wake of Zeppelin and Gotha raids&#151;for transforming the closed Strand underground station into a store for the national art collection in 1918. In the following April he was sent to Belgium to advise on post-war stabilization and reconstruction. Appointed a CBE in 1916, he was made a knight bachelor for his war work in 1918.<br>
<br>In the summer of 1920 Baines provoked controversy with his proposal for a national war memorial at Hyde Park Corner, London, which took the form of a colossal Egyptian pylon flanked by two temples. Baines intended his design's scale and simplicity to convey and commemorate the imperial sacrifice, but it prompted widespread protest for its size, incompatibility with surrounding buildings, and imitation of a style favoured by the &#145;despotic&#146; pharaohs  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 16 July 1920). Within a week the proposal was declared to be &#145;quite dead&#146; in a Commons debate  (ibid., 21 July 1920). Baines's last and greatest architectural project, costing &pound;1 million, was for two blocks of offices on opposite sides of Horseferry Road, Millbank, Westminster&#151;complemented by the remodelling of Lambeth Bridge. Nobel House was built between 1927 and 1929 for Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI) while Thames House (1929&#150;30) was for government, serving as the headquarters of the home intelligence service, MI5, between 1934 and 1939 and again from 1994. Baines's involvement with Nobel House prompted questions in parliament concerning the acceptability for a senior civil servant to work simultaneously for a private company, and led to his retirement from the office of works in September 1927. Appointed CVO in 1923, he was elected a fellow of the Royal Institute of British Architects two years later; on his retirement from the office of works he was awarded a second knighthood (KCVO), the personal award at a private investiture of George V, with whom he was on close terms.<br>
<br>From the mid-1920s Baines turned his attention to the preservation of English vernacular buildings, with a particular focus on the cottages that had been central to his earlier estate commissions. In an article in <span class="italic">The Times</span> (7 April 1925) he celebrated the adaptability and variation of England's &#145;real folk architecture&#146; which he feared was under threat from uniform design and &#145;the demands of modern progress&#146;  (). Baines also initiated the Fund for the Preservation of Ancient Cottages, which held its first annual meeting at the Royal Society of Arts in February 1929. At that time, a preservation order could not be made on an inhabited house. With the aid of G. K. Menzies, secretary to the RSA, and with the support of Ramsay Macdonald and Stanley Baldwin, Baines sought reform to enable inhabited homes to be protected. This was fully accomplished only with the advent of listed buildings and conservation areas in the <span class="roman">Town and Country Planning Act</span> (1947). In 1929 Baines was a member of the editorial board&#151;with Arnold Bennett, Aldous and Julian Huxley, H. G. Wells, and others&#151;of the short-lived periodical <span class="italic">The Realist: a Journal of Scientific Humanism</span>. For the first edition he contributed an essay, &#145;Architecture and Sculpture: an Intimate Relation&#146;, in which he argued that good architecture was a fusion of all the arts:<blockquote>Architecture, more than any other craft, needs the stimulus of public opinion, based on knowledge and sympathetic interest, to keep it healthily active and sane &hellip; No other craft is so primarily, so vitally, so intrinsically, the concern of us all. (vol. 1, April 1929, 128)</blockquote>Baines appears to have been secretive, not to say duplicitous, in his private life. On 13 June 1914 he married, at Southwark register office, Rhoda Eleanor Oldham (1889&#150;1963), who was recorded as a housemaid in Chigwell, Essex, in the 1911 census. The marriage was contracted under the name Francis Lloyd Baynes&#151;with the original &#145;i&#146; of Baines crossed out and a &#145;y&#146; substituted&#151;and with the husband's occupation given as &#145;commercial traveller in motor oils etc&#146;; a few days previously, Baines, under his real name and profession, had attended the royal levee at Buckingham Palace. The couple's son, born in September 1915, was registered as Francis Trevean Baynes; his father's name on the birth certificate was given as at his marriage, though his profession was now &#145;civil engineer&#146;. Baines's double life also shaped his living arrangements. As Francis Baynes he was resident with his wife at Grafton Mansions, Venn Street, Clapham, while from 1908 or 1909 the senior civil servant&#151;always Frank Baines&#151;lived at Loughton, Essex, where from about 1915 he was resident at Hillside, The Uplands. Here he designed three houses, for himself, his brother, and his sisters to whom he was always close. From the 1920s Baines was also resident at St Keverne, Cornwall. As a child his son used the name Baynes. At Oundle School he did not know the sons of his uncle, Hubert, who were schoolfellows, or that his father was a knight. The son was unsure how much, if anything, his mother knew of her husband's public career. Sir Frank Baines died from heart failure and degeneration on 24 December 1933 at his home on Trenoweth, St Keverne, Cornwall. He was buried at St Keverne, and was survived by his wife. She subsequently adopted her husband's birth name and title, and moved to Coggeshall, Essex, where&#151;as Lady Baines, a doyenne of the establishment&#151;she died in 1963. Their son, who achieved note as a writer, was also a sailor and businessman in India, and died in October 1987.<br>
