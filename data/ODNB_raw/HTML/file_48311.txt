<span class="headword">Evesham,  Dominic  of</span>  (<em>d.</em> in or before 1150), <span class="occ">Benedictine monk and hagiographer</span>, was perhaps born of English parents, as some slight linguistic evidence suggests. He seems to have become a monk at the Benedictine abbey of Evesham during the abbacy of Walter (1078&#150;1104), probably during its latter years&#151;he was not a monk in 1077, and knew only at second hand about some remarkable events at Evesham in Walter's earlier years. Dominic was an Evesham monk before Walter died, however, but was not highly placed in a list of the convent that was drawn up soon afterwards. In due course he became prior, and in that capacity represented his abbot in 1125 at the consecration of the abbot of Tewkesbury and witnessed his abbot's charters in 1130 and probably 1133. But by 1150 there was a different prior, and the inference is that Dominic was dead. Evesham Abbey observed his obit every year on 11 October.<br>
<br>Although Evesham Abbey was not very notable for its writings in Abbot Walter's day, Walter himself was believed to be &#145;greatly learned in both liberal and grammatical literature&#146; and he encouraged the monks to study; &#145;he made many books&#146;  (<span class="italic">Chronicon abbatiae de Evesham</span>, 96&#150;7). Dominic's chief literary interest was in miracle stories connected with the house. It was probably before 1100 that he rewrote Byrhtferth of Ramsey's life of Evesham's founder, St Ecgwine (<i>d</i>. 717), which he rendered in a more conventional and polished style to agree with Anglo-Norman taste, and in or after 1104 he added his own collection of stories about Ecgwine's posthumous miracles, from the late tenth-century revival of Evesham to the abbacy of Walter. Together Dominic's life and miracles of St Ecgwine have been praised for their clarity and elegance. The life was published by M. Lapidge in <span class="italic">Analecta Bollandiana</span>, 96 (1978), 65&#150;104. The miracles are in Hereford Cathedral Library, MS P.vii.6, and a thirteenth-century Evesham version of them, with no significant changes, was published in <span class="italic">Chronicon abbatiae de Evesham</span> (pp. 36&#150;67). Dominic also collected miracles of St Odulf (<i>d</i>. 855), a Brabantine missionary whose relics were given to Evesham in the early eleventh century. The stories evidently dated from that time to the abbacy of Maurice (1104&#150;<i>c</i>.1121) and seem to have been appended to a life lightly adapted, perhaps by Dominic, from that usually ascribed to Cappidus of Stavoren. The life and Dominic's miracles of St Odulf, or versions of them, are probably those in Bodl. Oxf., MS Rawl. A.287, folios 116<i>v</i>&#150;119<i>v</i>, from which the miracles were published in <span class="italic">Chronicon abbatiae de Evesham</span> (pp. 313&#150;20).<br>
<br>Dominic's most widely read collection, and one that became more influential than he could have foreseen, was of fourteen miracles of the Virgin Mary, Evesham's patron. He appears to have compiled it after <i>c</i>.1121&#151;one of the stories probably came from Abbot Robert, appointed about then&#151;and under the influence of a contemporary compilation of miracles of the Virgin now ascribed to Anselm, abbot of Bury (<i>d</i>. 1148). William of Malmesbury's collection of miracles of the Virgin borrowed seven or eight stories from Dominic's, and all three English collections were amalgamated by the mid-twelfth century. In that form they laid the foundations of a new genre, devoted to the Virgin herself rather than to places or saints that she had honoured, which was to permeate the culture of western Europe. Dominic later made a collection of eleventh-century miracle stories associated with Evesham called <span class="italic">Acta proborum virorum</span> (&#145;Deeds of good men&#146;), in which he listed his own earlier miracle collections. It was published in <span class="italic">Chronicon abbatiae de Evesham</span> (pp. 320&#150;25). There is no evidence to confirm the suggestion that Dominic revised (to 1078) and continued the Evesham <span class="italic">Gesta abbatum</span> (&#145;Deeds of the abbots&#146;); those parts of the <span class="italic">Gesta</span>  (printed in <span class="italic">Chronicon abbatiae de Evesham</span>, 69&#150;98) are unlike Dominic's known writings in genre and style. Nor has it been demonstrated that a lost life of St Wigstan (<i>d</i>. 849), whose relics lay at Evesham, was Dominic's work, though a version of it was written at Evesham in the thirteenth century  (published in <span class="italic">Chronicon abbatiae de Evesham</span>, 325&#150;37).<br>
