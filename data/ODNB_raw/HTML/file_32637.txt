<span class="headword">Crompton,  Henry</span>  (1836&#150;1904), <span class="occ">barrister and positivist</span>, was born at Liverpool on 27 August 1836, the second of five sons and three daughters of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6756/', "Sir Charles John Crompton (1797&#150;1865)")</script>, judge of the queen's bench, and his wife, Caroline Fletcher. The eldest son, Charles Crompton (1833&#150;1890), QC, was briefly a Gladstonian Liberal MP for Staffordshire (Leek division), and the fourth son, Albert Crompton (1843&#150;1908), manager of the Ocean Steamship Company, was the founder of the positivist church at Liverpool. Of his sisters, the eldest, Mary, married the Christian socialist clergyman John Llewelyn Davies; the second, Caroline Anna [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/48679/', "Robertson, Caroline Anna Croom")</script>], married the philosopher George Croom Robertson; and the third, Emily, married the positivist Edward Spenser Beesly. The Crompton parents were Unitarians but brought up their children as Anglicans.<br>
<br>Crompton attended University College School, London, and then a private school at Bonn, before entering Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1854. He graduated BA as junior optime in the mathematical tripos in 1858. Through his father's influence he was appointed in 1858 clerk of assize on the Chester and north Wales circuit, a post he held until retirement in 1901; he was called to the bar at the Inner Temple on 6 June 1863. His familial legal connections were strengthened by marriage, on 8 November 1870, to the Hon. Lucy Henrietta (<i>d</i>. 1923), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/24048/', "John Romilly, first Lord Romilly")</script>, master of the rolls. They had two sons.<br>
<br>During a long period of illness in 1861, Crompton read Harriet Martineau's edition of Comte's <span class="italic">Philosophie Positive</span> and became a convert to the secular religion of positivism. After meeting E. S. Beesly in 1864, and through him Richard Congreve, he joined the positivist community in London. Like other followers of Comte, he studied medicine and biology, attending classes at St Mary's Hospital, Paddington. He was active in denouncing the oppression of subject races, and became a member of the Jamaica committee in 1867 to prosecute Governor Eyre; he also signed the petition on behalf of the Fenian prisoners in the same year. He later urged British intervention to protect the French republic in 1871, and attacked the immorality of wars of colonial conquest in a pamphlet edited by Congreve and published in 1879. His <span class="italic">Letters on Social and Political Subjects</span> were published in 1870. He was active in the movement in 1868 to establish lectures open to women at University College, London, his mother, Lady Crompton, being a founder member of the London Ladies' Educational Association. He belonged to the circle of John Russell and Katherine Russell (Lord and Lady Amberley); one of their more conservative relatives, deploring Crompton's defence of the Paris commune, pronounced him &#145;one of the biggest fools I ever met&#146;  (Russell and Russell, 2.462).<br>
<br>Crompton's particular contribution to the positivist project of social reconstruction lay in his assistance to the Trades Union Congress in its campaign between 1871 and 1875 to place employers and workers in a position of equality before the law and to remove the criminal law from the conduct of industrial relations. His numerous publications during the controversy included articles in the trade union paper <span class="italic">The Beehive</span> and pamphlets on the <span class="roman">Criminal Law Amendment Act</span> (1871) and the law of conspiracy in the TUC's series of <span class="roman">Tracts for Trade Unionists</span>. At the Congress held in Leeds in 1873 he contributed to the drafting of the TUC legislative programme, and later described its successful outcome in an article on &#145;The workmen's victory&#146;, published in the <span class="italic">Fortnightly Review</span> (1875). His professional insight into the criminal law and its administration made his counsel particularly valuable, but his influence lay as much in his even-tempered and sympathetic character. Unlike the more abrasive and outspoken positivists Beesly and Frederic Harrison, he established good relations with the secretary to the TUC parliamentary committee, George Howell, who regarded him as a personal friend. After 1875 he encouraged the TUC to support the extension of trial by jury and the codification of the criminal law. His articles on the subject, published during 1875&#150;6 and reprinted after his death as <span class="italic">Our Criminal Justice</span> (ed. K. Digby, 1905), though critical in detail, were ultimately preservative in their intent, namely, to stimulate popular interest in and loyalty to the law. His failure in 1881 to persuade the TUC to oppose the government's policy of coercion against the leaders of the Irish Land League led to a more distant relationship with the labour movement.<br>
<br>Crompton was a well-informed and influential analyst of contemporary trends in industrial relations. His pamphlet <span class="italic">The Labour Laws Commission</span> (1875) sharply exposed the divergence between legal assumptions and the facts of industrial life, and this approach was developed in his <span class="italic">Industrial Conciliation</span> (1876), an optimistic account of the development of collective bargaining in British industry. It was described by Sidney and Beatrice Webb as &#145;the classic work&#146; on the subject  (<span class="italic">The History of Trade Unionism</span>, 1920 edn, 338 n.), and its evolutionary approach was drawn upon by Arnold Toynbee in his account of the industrial revolution. His methods also helped to inspire his cousin Charles Booth to embark upon a programme of social investigation.<br>
<br>Crompton was among those who followed Congreve after the schism in the English positivist movement in 1878, and assumed responsibility as his successor as director of the Church of Humanity at Chapel Street, London, where he was known for his piety and religiosity. His leadership was challenged by Malcolm Quin, the positivist leader in Newcastle and, in poor health, he resigned in 1901, despairing at the divisions within the movement. Crompton died on 15 March 1904 at his home, Churt House, near Farnham, Surrey. His widow, also a positivist, published a volume of <span class="italic">Selections of Prose and Poetry by Henry Crompton</span> in 1910.<br>
