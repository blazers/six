<span class="headword">Hutchison, Sir  (William) Kenneth</span>  (1903&#150;1989), <span class="occ">gas industrialist</span>, was born on 30 October 1903 at Dooria, Assam, India, the third of the five children of William Hutchison (1855&#150;1932), a tea planter, and his wife, Barbara, <i>n&eacute;e</i> McCormack (1880&#150;1906). On the death of their mother the children were brought up by an aunt near Dumfries; they later moved to Edinburgh. Hutchison was educated at Edinburgh Academy, won a scholarship to Corpus Christi College, Oxford, and graduated with first-class honours in chemistry. At the instigation of Harold Hartley, a director of the Gas Light and Coke Company, Hutchison joined the company as a research chemist in 1926, and for the next fifteen years helped to bring more scientific method to the empirical traditions of gas engineering. In 1939 he married Dorothea Marion Eva Bluett (<i>c</i>.1905&#150;1987&times;9); they had one daughter.<br>
<br>During the war Hutchison was given an opportunity to escape from the laboratory. He was attached to the Air Ministry, where within a couple of years he had become director of hydrogen production for barrage balloons; then, in 1944, he was appointed director responsible for the supply of all compressed gases, especially oxygen, for the British and American air forces. Apart from gaining invaluable direct management experience and learning the ways of Whitehall, he came to meet many senior figures in the gas industry. On his return to Gas Light and Coke he was appointed controller of by-products (coke, tar), and in 1947 became a director of the company. On nationalization in 1949 he was appointed first chairman of the South Eastern Gas Board.<br>
<br>Hutchison recognized that the gas industry had little control over its raw material costs and could be held to ransom as long as coal was its predominant feedstock. He placed great emphasis on developing new processes to use whatever oil feedstocks were available cheaply and in quantity. As an extension of this policy, he was closely involved in developing new technology for importing liquified natural gas by sea from Algeria. Even before 1964 when the gas tankers entered service, another possibility had been opened up by the discovery of natural gas in the Netherlands. In 1960 Hutchison was appointed deputy chairman of the Gas Council, which co-ordinated the activities of the twelve area gas boards. He foresaw the prospects of huge reserves of natural gas in the British sector of the North Sea, and fought to ensure that the gas industry would participate in the risks of exploration and production (and incidentally gain inside knowledge of the economics of the business) rather than remain a passive customer of the oil industry.<br>
<br>Making cheaper gas affordable was not enough if customers were abandoning gas for electricity or oil. Hutchison was the driving force behind national publicity campaigns, notably for &#145;high-speed gas&#146;, to persuade customers to buy gas fires and gas central heating. Such strategies, together with improved appliances and the likelihood of markedly cheaper gas, transformed the prospects of the industry. Sales of gas had been falling steadily since the war but they began to expand in 1961; and when Hutchison retired in 1966 they were increasing at 10 per cent a year. Supplies of North Sea gas had not yet started to flow, but Hutchison had already foreseen the way the market might expand and how the industry could accommodate this, both organizationally and technically.<br>
<br>Hutchison's move from scientist to entrepreneurial general manager came when he had turned forty. Despite this late start, more than any other single person he was the driving force behind the technical, commercial, and organizational changes which transformed the gas industry in the mid-twentieth century. From the fragmented, coal-dependent concerns which had survived from the nineteenth century, gas became a taut, centralized, organized industry, able to deal on equal terms with international oil companies. Lacking statutory powers, Hutchison had the strength of character to impart direction to the activities of the twelve semi-autonomous gas boards; and at the same time Sir Henry Jones, the chairman of the Gas Council, liaised with government and the civil service.<br>
<br>Hutchison was made a CBE in 1954 and knighted in 1962. He was president of the Institution of Gas Engineers (1955&#150;6) and the Institution of Chemical Engineers (1959&#150;61). In 1966 he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society. Generally taciturn and proud of being a scientist, he found it easier to make friends with lovers of literature. He was a keen golfer and sailor until late in life, and a first-class chef. He died a widower on 28 November 1989, from heart disease, at his home, 2 Arlington Road, St Margaret's, Twickenham.<br>
