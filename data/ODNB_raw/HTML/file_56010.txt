<span class="headword">Jessop <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Wilde]</span>,  Ann</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1782, <em>d.</em> 1864), <span class="occ">cabinet-maker</span>, was baptized at the church of St Peter and St Paul, Sheffield, on 9 May 1782, the daughter of Adam Wilde and his wife, Elizabeth. Nothing is known of her early life except that she was twice married: first at Sheffield on 21 June 1805 to Charles Turner; second at Rotherham parish church on 8 November 1818 to a widower, Edward Bardwell, an auctioneer and appraiser. Both marriage certificates were witnessed with a cross, indicating that she lacked education.<br>
<br>Around 1814 Edward Bardwell established a cabinet-making business in the centre of Sheffield at 92 Fargate. He was listed in trade directories of 1817 as an auctioneer and furniture broker, together with John Bardwell jun. (presumably a son or brother), auctioneer and appraiser, and Bardwell &amp; Son, auctioneers and appraisers, in nearby Marketplace. By 1821 Edward had died and despite the presence of several male relatives, Ann Bardwell was listed as trading alone as a cabinet-maker, upholsterer, and furniture broker from slightly smaller premises at 95 Fargate. The business continued in her name until 14 May 1828 when she married her third husband, James Jessop, another widower. Both signed the register with their names, Ann presumably having acquired literacy and numeracy while helping her second husband run his business. Between 1828 and 1832 the firm was known as James Jessop, cabinet-maker, but the 1833 Sheffield trade directory listed Mrs Ann Jessop, cabinet-maker, upholsterer, china, glass, and earthenware dealer, as trading from 95 Fargate alone.<br>
<br>In the same year Ann Jessop was one of nine local cabinet-makers approached by the Company of Cutlers in Hallamshire to tender designs and prices for the manufacture of 250 mahogany dining chairs and three large mahogany dining tables. Although she was unsuccessful in this commission, the fact that she was invited to tender for it indicates that she was one of the foremost cabinet-makers in the town. By 1839 the firm had moved to larger, rented premises at 26 Fargate, consisting of a house, shop, and warehouse. A surviving yew wood Windsor chair sold from there still bears a printed label inscribed, &#145;From A. Jessop's cabinet, picture frame, and looking glass manufactory&#146;. In the 1851 census Ann Jessop was listed as a widow aged sixty-eight. She was described as upholsterer, cabinet-maker, carver, and gilder, employing a total of eighteen men.<br>
<br>The firm continued under the name of Mrs Jessop until 1854 when, in her seventy-first year and after thirty-four years in business, she announced her retirement in favour of her nephew, F. J. Mercer, who had managed the firm for fourteen years. Ann Jessop retired with her niece to Springfield Place, 323 Glossop Road, then part of the affluent western suburbs of Sheffield. Unfortunately, the business ceased trading around 1870 and three years later F. J. Mercer committed suicide.<br>
<br>Ann Jessop died from gastroenteritis on 23 September 1864 aged eighty-two at her home, 264 Western Bank, Sheffield. She had the distinction, despite losing three husbands, of successfully running one of the leading cabinet-making, upholstery, carving, and gilding businesses in Sheffield in the mid-nineteenth century.<br>
