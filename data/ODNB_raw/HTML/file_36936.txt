<span class="headword">Willis,  William</span>  (1835&#150;1911), <span class="occ">barrister and judge</span>, was born at Dunstable, Bedfordshire, on 29 April 1835, the eldest son and third child in the family of eight sons and six daughters of William Willis, a straw hat manufacturer at Luton, and his wife, Esther Kentish, daughter of Johnson Masters, who ran a straw hat business at Dunstable. He received his early education at the free grammar school, Dunstable, then at schools in Hockcliffe, Bedfordshire, and at Hatfield, and lastly at Huddersfield College. After finishing school he worked in Luton and in the Old Change in London, where he was in business for six years. He subsequently matriculated at London University in 1857, graduating BA in 1859 and LLD with gold medal in 1865.<br>
<br>Willis entered as a student at the Inner Temple on 21 April 1858, winning the studentship given by the inns of court; he was called to the bar on 6 June 1861. His success from the first was swift; he had a sound knowledge of the common law and he was extremely effective with juries. He took silk on 13 February 1877 and was made a bencher of the Inner Temple on 28 January 1880. For the next twenty years he was one of the most conspicuous figures and determined fighters in the courts of law at Westminster and in the Strand. Of a fervid temperament and very voluble in speech, he would identify himself absolutely with the interests of his client, and assail his opponents with as much zeal and indignation as if his own honour and property were at stake. He came into frequent collision with both the bar and the bench. His services were greatly in demand in cases which required violent appeals to sentiment and emotion, and he could be forcible and convincing where the issue turned on points of law. Out of court his flow of conversation was the source of endless amusement to fellow lawyers, among whom he was extremely popular. He was said to enjoy speaking to everyone he met.<br>
<br>On 21 March 1866 Willis married Annie, eldest daughter of John Outhwaite of Clapham, with whom he had four sons and five daughters. On 2 September 1897 he married Marie Elizabeth, daughter of Thomas Moody of Lewisham.<br>
<br>A Baptist by religion and a radical in politics, Willis advocated his principles in all companies. In 1903 he was chosen president of the Baptist Conference, a distinction rarely conferred upon a layman. In the general election of 1880 he was returned second on the poll as Liberal member for Colchester, defeating the Conservative candidate by a single vote. He took frequent part in the proceedings of the house, and on 31 March 1884 he succeeded in carrying a motion for the exclusion of the bishops from the House of Lords by a majority of eleven votes in spite of the opposition of Sir William Harcourt on behalf of the government. Colchester no longer having a second member, he stood unsuccessfully for Peckham in the general election of November 1885, and again in July 1886. In March 1897 he was given a county court judgeship by Lord Halsbury, first in Norfolk and Cambridge and later in Southwark, Greenwich, and Woolwich. As a judge he was said to favour the employee against the employer. His constant warfare with counsel attracted frequent press attention.<br>
<br>Though largely a self-educated man, Willis had a wide knowledge of English literature and especially of the classic writers of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries and published several works in this area, as well as legal texts and a volume of <span class="italic">Recollections</span> (1908). He lectured on Milton and Bunyan with real eloquence. On 29 May 1902 he read publicly in the hall of the Inner Temple an imaginary &#145;report of the trial of an issue in Westminster Hall, 20 June 1627&#146;, dealing with the Shakespeare&#150;Bacon controversy. Willis died at his residence at 18 Belmont Park, Blackheath, London, on 22 August 1911 after a prolonged illness, and was buried later that month in Lee cemetery. He was survived by his second wife.<br>
