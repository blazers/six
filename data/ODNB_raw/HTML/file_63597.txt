<span class="headword">O'Coigly <span class="st"> [O'Coigley]</span>,  James</span>  (1761&#150;1798), <span class="occ">Irish nationalist and Roman Catholic priest</span>, was born in August 1761 at Castleraw, Kilmore, co. Armagh, the second son of James Coigley, farmer, and Louisa, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Donnelly. His maternal ancestors, the O'Donnellys of co. Tyrone, were a landed Jacobite family who suffered grievous losses at the battle of the Boyne (July 1690). His father's family had also been heavily engaged in the Williamite wars, but afterwards recovered their economic stability and were engaged in farming and weaving in the 1760s. James O'Coigly was educated in Dundalk's grammar school, co. Louth, and ordained in the Roman Catholic church in January 1785. He travelled in June of that year to Paris for further studies at the Coll&egrave;ge des Lombards, where his leadership talents were displayed at the head of a student body agitating for better conditions. Although reputedly involved in the storming of the Bastille in July 1789 with fellow Irish student James Blackwell, the anti-clerical character of the French Revolution obliged him to flee to Ireland from Dieppe in October. On returning to Armagh, O'Coigly found himself in the middle of worsening civil strife between the Ulster Presbyterian Peep o' Day Boys and the Catholic defenders. He is believed to have written the anonymous pamphlet <span class="italic">An Impartial Account of the Late Disturbances in the County of Armagh</span> which was published in Dublin in 1792.<br>
<br>During the early 1790s, while based in a Louth parish and chaplain to Dundalk prison, O'Coigly became deeply engaged in radical politics and an influential supporter of the defenders. He was probably a leading member of the group and was also associated with the United Irishmen. In 1791&#150;3 he was one of several activists who attempted to harness the paramilitary manpower of the defenders to the more sophisticated revolutionary politics of the United Irishmen. He visited Randalstown, Dungiven, Newtownlimavady, Magilligan, Maghera, and other Ulster centres during this time and liaised with radical Belfast Presbyterians who formed the backbone of the United Irishmen in the north. O'Coigly allegedly introduced Dublin radical James Napper Tandy to the Louth defenders, a meeting which obliged Napper Tandy to flee to Philadelphia. More certain is that O'Coigly's cousin led the defenders at the battle of the Diamond in September 1795 which presaged the formation of the Orange order. Other close family members were prominent in Armagh, co. Tyrone, and Louth defenderism, and the homes of his father and brother were singled out for attack by loyalists.<br>
<br>O'Coigly's stature in the United Irishmen rose in 1796 owing to arrests, the society's incorporation of the defender movement, and the emergence of the Lord Edward Fitzgerald clique to which he was attached. In June 1797 O'Coigly travelled to Manchester and London to help arrange co-operation between French-backed English, Scottish, and Irish revolutionaries. Having conferred with Colonel Edward Despard and Thomas Evans of the London Corresponding Society, he went from Hamburg to Paris with fellow United Irish delegate the Revd Arthur McMahon, where they fell in with Tandy's circle. On reporting to Valentine Lawless and other London contacts in December 1797 and to Fitzgerald in Dublin in January 1798, O'Coigly prepared to return to France in company with Arthur O'Connor, John Binns, John Allen, and John O'Leary.<br>
<br>The party were arrested on 28 February 1798 at Margate when seeking passage to France and high treason proceedings commenced. O'Coigly completed a defiant pamphlet when in Maidstone gaol on 30 April and contemptuously ate an orange when his trial began on 21 May. O'Coigly, variously referred to as Coigly, O'Coigley, and Quigley, was the most incriminated of all the defendants owing to documents recovered on his person. He was convicted of high treason and hanged at Pennenden Heath, near Maidstone, Kent, on 7 June 1798. In July 1900 Coigly was commemorated by a window in the Roman Catholic church of St Francis of Assisi in Maidstone.<br>
