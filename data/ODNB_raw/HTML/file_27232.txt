<span class="headword">Thomas,  Joshua</span>  (1719&#150;1797), <span class="occ">Particular Baptist minister and historian</span>, was born on 22 February 1719 at T&#375;-hen, Caeo, Carmarthenshire, the eldest son of Thomas Morgan (<i>c</i>.1690&#150;1760), carpenter, and his wife, Jane Hughes (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1689). After a rudimentary education at a school kept by the Independent minister David Williams at Bwlch-y-rhiw, in his home parish, he left for Hereford in 1739 to pursue an apprenticeship, possibly as a mercer. Within months of his departure the family, who had been Independents, transferred their allegiance to the Baptist cause, while Joshua Thomas himself was baptized by immersion at Leominster in May 1740.<br>
<br>On his return from Herefordshire to Caeo in 1743 Thomas became closely involved in the activities of the recently established Bethel branch of the Aberdyar Baptist Church, at which his brother Timothy had been ordained minister. In 1746 he married Elizabeth Jones (<i>c</i>.1725&#150;1807) from Cardiganshire before settling, in May of that year, at Hay, Brecknockshire, taking up membership at the Trosgoed (subsequently Maesyberllan) church. It was during this time that he began preaching, confining his labour to Trosgoed's branches at Olchon, on the Hereford side of the Welsh border, and Capel-y-ffin. It was there in 1749 that he was ordained as ministerial assistant. A further move occurred in November 1754, when he accepted a call to the ministry of the Baptist congregation at Leominster, Herefordshire, where he was to remain for the rest of his life.<br>
<br>It was during his Leominster pastorate that Thomas's skills as a researcher were first nurtured and his reputation as a sound historian and accomplished author came to fruition. He had already published a short work, <span class="italic">Ateb i'r ugain rhesymmau</span> (1751), a reply to an anti-Baptist polemic, during his time at Hay, but a growing fascination with the beginnings of his Leominster congregation during the protectorate served to hone his interest in dissenting history. Using church records and the recollections of his oldest members as his source, in 1764 he began to compose &#145;A brief history of the Baptist church at Leominster&#146;, completing the manuscript five years later. This provided an apprenticeship for subsequent works, including what was to become his most accomplished volume, <span class="italic">Hanes y Bedyddwyr ymhlith y Cymry</span> (&#145;A history of the Baptists among the Welsh&#146;; 1778), and the one for which he remains best remembered. Although he had been encouraged by his ministerial colleagues as early as 1751 to write a sketch delineating the history of the Welsh Baptists, he did not begin to collate material until 1774. He spent the summer of 1776 travelling throughout south Wales visiting churches and gleaning information, and when the attractive 468-page quarto volume was published it was immediately apparent that a judicious historian and writer of the most elegant Welsh prose had emerged. The <span class="italic">Hanes</span> would become the principal source for early Welsh Baptist historians for generations to come and a notable contribution to Welsh historiography. His succeeding work, the two-volume manuscript &#145;Ecclesiastical history of Wales&#146;, which described the legends which accompanied the coming of Christianity to Wales and its subsequent history up to the puritan ascendancy, was completed by 1779, while a virtual translation of the <span class="italic">Hanes</span> entitled &#145;Materials for a history of the Baptist churches in the principality of Wales from about the year 1630 to 1782&#146; was completed three years later. Although less anecdotal than the original, its factual content had been strengthened by the inclusion of information which Thomas had received from American sources provided by Isaac Backus and Morgan Edwards in Philadelphia. This formed the basis of his meticulous and detailed contributions to John Rippon's <span class="italic">Baptist Annual Register</span> (1791&#150;), which prompted Rippon's description of him as &#145;the best informed person on earth concerning the origin and growth of the baptized Churches in Wales&#146;. The bulk of a further manuscript history, &#145;A history of the Baptist churches in Wales&#146;, was completed by 1794, and this became the basis for Benjamin Davies's Welsh translation of 1885, which gave Thomas's historical work a new lease of life and further confirmed his reputation among Victorian nonconformists. His final published work, also based upon his contribution to Rippon's <span class="italic">Register</span>, was <span class="italic">History of the Baptist Association in Wales from the Year 1659 to the Year 1790</span> (1795), though less substantial histories of individual churches, including Bewdley, Worcestershire, Hook Norton, Oxfordshire, and Colchester, remain in manuscript form.<br>
<br>Along with his contribution as denominational historian, Thomas was a key figure in eighteenth-century Baptist life in the east midlands as well as in Wales. His long correspondence with his close friend and colleague Benjamin Francis (1734&#150;1799), another expatriate Welshman whose career was spent ministering to Baptist congregations in the west of England, affords a fascinating glimpse of mid-eighteenth-century dissenting life. Though eirenic by temperament he nevertheless argued strongly for doctrinal orthodoxy, as witnessed by his widely used translation of the London Particular Baptists' 1689 confession, <span class="italic">Cyffes ffydd wedi ei gosod allan</span> (1791) and his 1794 translation of Robert Hall's essay on the Trinity. His evangelical Calvinism was shared by his brothers Timothy (1720&#150;1768), author of a very able treatise on the doctrine of justification, <span class="italic">Traethiad ar y wisg-wen ddisglair</span> (1759), and Zacharias (1727&#150;1816), both of whom served as ministers of the Aberdyar church.<br>
<br>The best known of the five of Joshua Thomas's children to survive infancy was <a name="cosubject_65286"></a><span class="headword">Timothy Thomas</span>  (1753&#150;1821), <span class="occ">Particular Baptist minister</span> for forty-seven years at the Devonshire Square church in Bishopsgate, London. Following his marriage to Sarah, daughter of Hugh Evans, president of the Bristol Baptist Academy, he became chairman of the Particular Baptist Fund and a member of the London Education Society, which in turn became the Stepney College and latterly Regent's Park College. He was buried at Bunhill Fields, London.<br>
<br>Joshua Thomas died, aged seventy-eight, on 25 August 1797 at Etnam Street, Leominster, Herefordshire, having served the Baptist community there for forty-three years. He was buried three days later in the Etnam Street churchyard.<br>
