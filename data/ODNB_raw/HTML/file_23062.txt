<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Ralston,  William Ralston  Shedden-</span>  (1828&#150;1889), <span class="occ">librarian, folklorist, and Russian scholar</span>, was born on 4 April 1828 in York Terrace, Regent's Park, London, the only son of William Patrick Ralston Shedden (1794&#150;1880), merchant of Calcutta, and his wife, Frances Sophia, daughter of William Browne of that city. His grandfather William Ralston Shedden of Roughwood, Ayrshire, had had children from two unions in America, the second of which was confirmed on his deathbed in New York; but the Scottish estate passed none the less to relatives, and Ralston's father (as he afterwards maintained) was brought up ignorant of the facts. The Sheddens retired to England in 1833, settling at Palmyra Square in Brighton, where Ralston spent much of his childhood before being educated to university entrance level by the Revd John Roughton Hogg at Lower Brixham, Devon. Admitted to Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1846, he read mathematics, but was drawn to law, and before graduating in 1850 had entered Lincoln's Inn, London. His sensitive, warm-hearted nature was, however, distracted by London's squalor, and he gave himself to church charity work; he also became involved in the Working Men's College, and subsequently observed and commented on poverty in Paris.<br>
<br>The family's Indian wealth was meanwhile being exhausted by litigation. Shedden's claim to Roughwood was denied by a Scottish court and by the House of Lords, but the <span class="roman">Legitimacy Declaration Act</span> encouraged him to try again; insolvent as he now was, his case was brilliantly argued before the probate court in 1860 by his daughter Annabella Jean. Despite the emphatic judgment that Shedden was illegitimate and could not inherit British property, he appealed, and as late as 1869 reverted unsuccessfully to the House of Lords. By contrast his son, who loved and later succoured him, shrank from the notoriety and assumed the surname Ralston; in 1861 he formalized the name as Shedden-Ralston, preparatory to being called to the bar at the Inner Temple. Although he resided there in Fig Tree Court for many years, he never practised law, having already in 1853 joined the department of printed books at the British Museum. By diligent if often tedious work, he rose steadily to reach by 1867 the upper section of the first class of assistants. Slim, about 6 feet 6 inches tall, with receding dark hair above a wistful face and flowing pepper-and-salt beard, he was an imposing but kindly figure; his presence was said to bring sunlight to the darkest room. He moved easily in the intellectual world, and was often at Macmillan's &#145;tobacco parliaments&#146;; he enjoyed cordial if self-effacing relations with many leading writers, including Dante Gabriel Rossetti, Wilkie Collins, Tennyson, Carlyle, and George Eliot.<br>
<br>With the encouragement of Anthony Panizzi, Ralston developed a Slavonic speciality. He taught himself Russian to a very high level (by memorizing the pages of a dictionary), though he lamented his hesitancy when speaking it. He began to write about Russia and from the first exhibited his love of the common people, whose rich, lucid language, strong traditions, and unaffected religion he witnessed for himself in 1868 and 1870, when he also became acquainted with prominent linguists and folklorists such as V. I. Dal and A. N. Afanasyev. Among the earliest authors to excite him as translator were Koltsov (the &#145;Russian Burns&#146;), the racy dramatist Ostrovsky, and the earthy fabulist Krylov. His study <span class="italic">Krilof and his Fables</span> (1869) was a landmark in the reception of Russian literature in Britain. As a translator and critic Ralston is, however, associated primarily with Turgenev, with whom he enjoyed a warm and productive friendship. Turgenev gave much practical help and advice, and Ralston enthusiastically championed the novelist in print, facilitated meetings with leading British authors, arranged a grand dinner for him in 1881, and translated&#151;as <span class="italic">Liza</span>&#151;Turgenev's <span class="italic">Dvoryanskoye gnezdo</span> (&#145;A nest of the gentry&#146;; 1869): Turgenev considered this the best translation ever made from any work of his.<br>
<br>Nicknamed the Russian Don Quixote, Ralston saw his vocation as tilting at British ignorance about Russia. Passionate in both praise and blame, he was constantly truthful and erred only by occasional extravagance. Already by 1875 he had published nearly a hundred items, including three authoritative books, <span class="italic">The Songs of the Russian People</span> (1872), <span class="italic">Russian Folk-Tales</span> (1873), and <span class="italic">Early Russian History</span> (1874). He lectured inimitably on Russian topics at the Royal Institution, at Oxford University, and throughout Britain. However, a crisis now occurred. For some years Ralston had protested that the museum constrained his time and energy, imposed on him unnecessary cataloguing chores, kept him from Slavonic books, and passed him over for promotion. As &#145;one of the rare just spirits in that academical Dotheboys Hall&#146;  (Gosse, 131), he became implicated in attacks on management and in April 1875 resigned his post, ostensibly on grounds of ill health.<br>
<br>Ralston was now a free agent, but needed to fill his life with work in order to survive. While he could, he did. He promoted Tolstoy's <span class="italic">War and Peace</span>, translated Lermontov's <span class="italic">Song of Ivan Vasilyevich</span>, contributed articles to the <span class="italic">Encyclopaedia Britannica</span>, wrote numerous reviews, and helped to found the Folklore Society. His regular public story-tellings were extraordinarily popular and led to invitations to Marlborough House and Buckingham Palace. His researches were rewarded by membership of many Russian institutions, including the Geographical Society and the Academy of Sciences. But the lack of a daily routine drove Ralston in on himself and depression set in. He failed to carry through a planned monograph on Russian heroic poetry and a biography of Pushkin, and desisted from writing a general work on Russia, in favour of Mackenzie Wallace. His attempts at travel, to Russia and elsewhere, were generally aborted. He complained of rheumatism, dyspepsia, roaring in the ears, perpetual sleepiness; he perhaps had myalgic encephalomyelitis. Enforced inactivity brought no income, and most of what he did publish was unremunerative; his pension was mean, and he gave generously to friends and to charity. He increasingly shunned society, becoming almost a recluse.<br>
<br>Ralston no longer cared whether he lived or died: as early as 1882 he spoke of killing himself. In 1887 he nearly set his chimney on fire while burning his papers and diaries; all that survived was a large group of Turgenev's letters, and a few from Tolstoy and some English writers. Relief did sometimes come, as when late in 1888 Ralston became engaged to 26-year-old Annie, daughter of Henry Vizetelly. He hoped to obtain a post in Russia to support her, and placed such capital as he possessed&#151;some &pound;3000&#151;in a trust for their marriage. Precisely at this period, however, he was twice arrested for disorderly behaviour, and his old Cambridge friend A. J. Munby had to intervene on his behalf at Bow Street and with the lunacy commission. Forced to move from his comfortable flat at 8 Alfred Place, Bedford Square, to cramped lodgings nearby at 11 North Crescent, Ralston attempted to control his despair with narcotics. On 6 August 1889 he was found dead, a gutta-percha sheet over his head and a bottle of chloroform in his hand. The coroner returned a verdict of misadventure. Ralston was buried in Brompton cemetery on 12 August.<br>
