<span class="headword">Applegath,  Augustus</span>  (1788&#150;1871), <span class="occ">printer</span>, was born on 17 June 1788 in Stepney, the second child of Augustus Joseph Applegath, an East India Company sea captain, and his wife, Ann, formerly Parker, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Lepard. He was educated at Dr Wanostrocht's Alfred House Academy at Peckham Road, London, before being apprenticed to Benjamin Lepard, a wholesale stationer, at Covent Garden. Applegath and his younger brother, Joseph, continued in the stationery business in Covent Garden until 1813, when, on the death of William Cornish, Augustus joined Cornish's partners, Henry Mitton and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6504/', "Edward Cowper")</script>, in the printing firm of Cornish &amp; Co. at Nelson Square, Southwark. In September 1813 he married Sophia, daughter of Captain John Drew of Bristol. Of their numerous children, seven survived him.<br>
<br>In November 1817 the partners put forward a proposal to the Bank of England for a method of printing banknotes which could not be copied by forgers. Mitton left the partnership in December. Applegath and Cowper were required to deposit a sum with the bank equal to their estimated cost of development of the method, recoverable only if it was adopted; however, the bank did contribute to the cost of materials and labour. The two men developed a machine capable of printing six colours in perfect register and some millions of &pound;1 notes were printed. But these were never issued because the bank reverted to cash payments in 1821. Applegath and Cowper received only &pound;4000 in recompense for their three and a half years of labour.<br>
<br>The partners also made a name for themselves in constructing and improving printing machinery, especially for <span class="italic">The Times</span> from 1818. By 1826 no fewer than ten newspapers were printed on Applegath and Cowper presses. In 1827 an Applegath and Cowper four-feeder machine was installed for <span class="italic">The Times</span>, in 1846 an eight-feeder, and in 1847 a nine-feeder. These considerable feats of engineering enabled the newspaper to raise its circulation far in advance of its rivals.<br>
<br>Despite these achievements, Applegath was declared bankrupt in 1826 and his Blackfriars workshops and goods were sold to another printer, William Clowes, who became a dominant figure in Victorian printing. By 1828 Applegath was working as a silk and calico printer, specializing in silk handkerchiefs, with a factory at Crayford, Kent, and a London office. In 1842 he was again declared bankrupt. The Crayford business was sold to David Evans and Applegath moved into a works in Dartford which had been established by his brother John, where he manufactured printing machinery. He remained at Dartford until his death, at his home in Spital Street, on 9 February 1871.<br>
