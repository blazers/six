<span class="headword">Hopper <span class="st"> [<em>married name </em>Chesson]</span>,  Eleanor Jane <span class="st"> [Nora]</span></span>  (1871&#150;1906), <span class="occ">writer</span>, was born on 2 January 1871, at 8 Radnor Place, St Leonard, Devon, the daughter of Captain Harman Baillie Hopper (<i>d</i>. 1871), an Irish officer retired from the 31st Bengal native infantry, and his second wife, Caroline Augusta, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Francis, who was Welsh. Eight months later, Hopper died. Caroline Hopper went to live with her unmarried sister Sarah in Sussex Villas, Kensington. Nora was educated at Cumberland House, South Kensington, and lived with her mother at 36 Royal Crescent, Notting Hill, until her marriage.<br>
<br>Nora Hopper began to write poems at fifteen and studied folklore at the British Museum with the encouragement of Dr Richard Garnett and A. P. Graves, spending three years reading Icelandic sagas. She began to publish poems and stories in such periodicals as <span class="italic">The Sketch</span>, <span class="italic">Black and White</span>, <span class="italic">Household Words</span>, <span class="italic">Longman's</span>, <span class="italic">Macmillan's</span>, and <span class="italic">Chambers'</span> magazines, <span class="italic">Sylvia's Journal</span>, the <span class="italic">Yellow Book</span>, the <span class="italic">National Observer</span>, and <span class="italic">The Lyceum</span>.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">Ballads in Prose</span> (1894), Hopper's first book, alternated verse and prose in a <i>conte-fable</i> structure ostensibly based on Irish fairy-lore, but in fact &#145;spun out of the moonshine of my own brain &hellip; Irish tradition has given me nothing&#146; she confessed  (letter to Richard Garnett, 28 Jan 1895, Harry Ransom Humanities Research Center, University of Texas at Austin). That the Irishness of her work had been achieved by one who had never been there was &#145;a remarkable instance of temperament and interest independent and almost defiant of environment&#146;. Home rule politics were &#145;meaningless in her ears, and she only becomes a partisan at the sound of &#147;'98,&#148; or at the names of Emmett or Sarsfield&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Bookman</span>, Sept 1895).<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">Ballads in Prose</span> contained na&iuml;ve plagiaries of both Yeats and Katharine Tynan. Annoying as Yeats found the plagiary of his announced title <span class="italic">The Wind among the Reeds</span>, incorporated into Joseph Walter West's cover design, he reassured Hopper. He was &#145;haunted&#146; by four &#145;strange wayward&#146; stories which, in turn, influenced his <span class="italic">The Secret Rose</span> (1897), including &#145;The gifts of Aodh and Una&#146;, which inspired his plans for a Celtic mystical order. (Hopper played a minor role in its visionary experiments.)<br>
<br>Unequal and immature as Hopper's work was, Yeats praised <span class="italic">Ballads in Prose</span> in two lists of &#145;Best Irish Books&#146; in 1895 as &#145;an absolute creation, an enchanting tender little book full of style and wild melancholy&#146;, leading the Irish newspapers to suspect rightly that he was booming her prematurely  (<span class="italic">Collected Letters</span>, 440&#150;43, 453n., 470n.). He included her work in <span class="italic">A Book of Irish Poetry</span> (1900) and wrote the headnote for her poems in Brooke and Rolleston's <span class="italic">A Treasury of Irish Poetry in the English Tongue</span> (1900).<br>
<br>Hopper's drawback was her lack of precise knowledge of Ireland. After her death Yeats thought that Irish Fairyland had spoiled her work (always excepting &#145;The King of Ireland's Son&#146;, which she had herself spoiled by revision, as he told her in 1898). Yet Thomas MacDonagh considered Hopper (with Lionel Johnson) as one of only few writers who were born and who lived their whole lives out of Ireland, and yet were truly Irish. Nora Hopper's work appeared in a range of publications: <span class="italic">Folk-Lore</span>, <span class="italic">The Celt</span>, <span class="italic">The Evergreen</span>, the <span class="italic">Cornish Magazine</span>, <span class="italic">Daily Express</span> (Dublin), and <span class="italic">New Ireland Review</span>.<br>
<br>Collections of Hopper's poems such as <span class="italic">Under Quicken Boughs</span> (1896), <span class="italic">Songs of the Morning</span> (1900), and <span class="italic">Aquamarines</span> (1902) followed, as did <span class="italic">The Bell and the Arrow: an English Love Story</span> (1905). She read at &#145;original nights&#146; of the Irish Literary Society, London (1898&#150;1901), with &#145;an exquisitely modulated voice, but her appearance was disappointing &hellip; rather common-looking, short and squat&#146;  (MacManus, 5). Ford Madox Hueffer (later Ford) recalled her &#145;quality of having existed for ever, not of having aged. Above all, it was the quality of seeming aloof &hellip; not absent-mindedness, but rather abstraction&#146;. During a train journey, she &#145;was not in the carriage at all. She was, precisely, in another world, and just before we entered London, with a sudden air of &#147;pulling herself together,&#148; she announced that she had a poem in her head&#146;  (Chesson, biographical note, xi&#150;xii).<br>
<br>On 5 March 1901 at Brentford register office Hopper married (Wilfrid) Hugh Chesson (1870&#150;1953), literary journalist and publisher's reader for T. Fisher Unwin, whom she had known since 1894. Their first child, Ann Caroline Spry, was born on 6 August 1902, followed by a son, Dermot, on 11 July 1904. They lived at Childwall, 337 Sandycombe Road, North Sheen, Surrey, Hugh Chesson's home for the next fifty years. The house belonged to Nora Chesson: she had investments of &pound;60 a year and literary earnings of &pound;40 a year from prolific hack work as reviewer, novelist, anthologist, versifier for children's books illustrated by Louis Wain, and paraphraser and reteller of nursery tales for Raphael Tuck &amp; Sons. She also wrote for the <span class="italic">Girls' Own Paper</span>. &#145;No poet of her time contributed more to the Press&#146;, Chesson recalled, but she had become so well known as Nora Hopper that &#145;the press refused her the privilege of being equally well known&#146; as Nora Chesson  (Chesson, biographical note, viii). Nora Chesson wrote the libretto for O'Brien Butler's three-act opera <span class="italic">Muirgheis</span> (&#145;The sea-swan&#146;), produced in Dublin in 1903 and later translated into Irish by T&oacute;rna (Tadhg &Oacute; Donnchadha), and a Celtic play &#145;The dark prince&#146; (rejected for the Abbey in 1910).<br>
<br>On 27 June 1905 Nora Chesson applied to the Royal Literary Fund after her husband's &#145;complete nervous breakdown&#146;. As her case was appraised, H. C. Beeching invoked comparisons with Christina Rossetti. In July 1905, when the first instalment (&pound;150) of the &pound;250 grant came, she took the family to Crockham Hill, Edenbridge, and thence to the Waverley Hotel, Lyme Regis. On 13 September 1905 she met Irish writers in Dublin for the first time, and by 9 November 1905 the Chessons were at 6 Mark Street, Portrush, co. Antrim, where her husband made &#145;steady progress&#146;. Back in London, a second daughter, Dagmar, was born on 21 March 1906. On 14 April 1906 Nora Chesson died at her home in North Sheen. The death certificate lists &#145;old valvular disease of the heart&#146; and &#145;parturition 24 days&#146;, but E. V. Lucas told the Royal Literary Fund that she died of puerperal fever. A friend, Margaret Harwood, arranged for Dermot Chesson to be adopted by her sister and brother-in-law, Alice and Graham Spence. Thereafter, Dermot had virtually no contact with his father or sisters.<br>
<br>Hugh Chesson's interest on the &pound;2284 15<i>s</i>. 8<i>d</i>. left by Nora Chesson came to &pound;74 per annum, and there were debts. Ford Madox Hueffer proposed to pay Chesson a small sum for preparing an edition of his wife's poems and to return the proceeds to a fund for the daughters, who lacked a breadwinner and a responsible parent. Five fascicles of her poems under the overall title <span class="italic">Selected Poems</span> (1906) followed. The first, <span class="italic">Dirge for Aoine and other Poems</span>, contained a biographical note by Chesson and an &#145;Introductory&#146; by Hueffer. By 4 July 1906 the appeal had raised &pound;206 9<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>. G. K. Chesterton, Justin McCarthy, and Richard Garnett supported a further bid to the Royal Literary Fund. &pound;250 was added, and the fund became the Chesson Trust (&pound;505 3<i>s</i>. 7<i>d</i>.).<br>
<br>Hugh Chesson &#145;slowly recovered from a most terrible struggle with inner forces whispering of self destruction &hellip; [feeling] not far removed from the precipice into which any mental strain might again precipitate him&#146;, as Garnett testified. His spiritualism enabled him to &#145;look upon his wife's death not so much as loss but as separation and that alleviated by the possibilities of continued intercourse&#146;  (Royal Literary Fund archive, London). In his introduction to her novel <span class="italic">Father Felix's Chronicles</span> (1907) Chesson claimed that his occult beliefs arose in part from his wife's visionary experiences, which involved time travel and the gift of tongues. More darkly, he hinted that she &#145;coveted the pain of them whom she loved&#146;  (p. 8). On 20 June 1923 Hugh Chesson married a Miss Daisy Green. By then his daughter Ann had committed suicide shortly after her marriage to Gilson MacCormack, and the discovery of his infidelity. Chesson had at least two more children, and died on 16 February 1953, aged eighty-two. Dagmar Chesson was given administration of the residue of Nora Hopper's estate at his death. She never married, but lived a bohemian life in Chepstow Villas, Bayswater, and died in 1991.<br>
