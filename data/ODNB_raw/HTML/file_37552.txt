<span class="headword">Hoare,  Henry</span>  (1705&#150;1785), <span class="occ">banker and patron of art</span>, was born on 7 July 1705, the eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/47085/', "Henry Hoare (1677&#150;1725)")</script>, banker, and his wife, Jane (<i>d</i>. 1741), daughter of Sir William Benson of Bromley. His grandfather, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13385/', "Sir Richard Hoare (1648&#150;1719)")</script>, was the founder of Hoare's Bank. The elder Henry Hoare bought the manor of Stourton in Wiltshire in 1717 and employed Colen Campbell to build a new house, Stourhead, which was completed in 1724, just before his death, and which he bequeathed to his son. The younger Henry (known in the family as Henry the Magnificent) moved to Stourhead on his mother's death in 1741, but succeeded his father immediately as a partner of Hoare's Bank in 1726, abandoning his previous life, which he had led largely at Quarley in Hampshire &#145;hunting and drinking with other young men of his age&#146;, and applied himself to serious study of the classical writers. In 1734 he bought the Palladian mansion Wilbury House in Wiltshire, and was elected MP for Salisbury. Later he went abroad to pursue his study of painting and began collecting works of art. The death of his uncle Benjamin (1693&#150;1750) made him undisputed senior partner of the bank and the steady rise in deposits and profits reflected his constant attendance to bank affairs. He was keenly aware that the success of his plans for Stourhead depended entirely on the careful management of the business.<br>
<br>Hoare married first in 1726 Anne, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18263/', "Samuel Masham, first Baron Masham")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18261/', "Masham, Abigail, Lady Masham")</script>]. She died in 1727, leaving one daughter, Anne (<i>d</i>. 1735). He married second, in 1728, Susan, daughter and heir of Stephen Colt (<i>d</i>. 1708), and from this marriage had three sons (two died in infancy, and his surviving son, Henry, died in 1752) and two daughters. His elder daughter, Susanna (1732&#150;1783), married first in 1753, Charles Boyle, Viscount Dungarvan (<i>d</i>. 1759), and second, in 1761, Thomas, Baron Bruce, of Tottenham Park, Wiltshire, created earl of Ailesbury in 1776. His younger daughter, Anne (1737&#150;1759), married in 1756 her first cousin, Richard Hoare (1735&#150;1787), created baronet in 1786; their son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13387/', "Richard Colt Hoare, second baronet (1758&#150;1838)")</script>, inherited his grandfather's estate. He recalled Henry thus: &#145;tall, comely in his person, elegant in his manners and address and well versed in literature&#146;.<br>
<br>Hoare's second wife died in 1743, and as a widower, he began in earnest the creation of the gardens and the embellishment of the house through collecting and patronage. He transformed the Stourhead landscape into a Claudian idyll, damming the River Stour to create a lake and engaging Henry Flitcroft, who designed the classical temples of Flora (1745) and Apollo (1765), and the Pantheon (1753&#150;4), which is regarded as an outstanding example of his work, recalling Claude Lorrain's <span class="italic">Coast View of Delos with Aeneas</span>. The gardens at Stourhead are historically important as an early example of &#145;le jardin anglais&#146;.<br>
<br>It was Hoare who started the picture collection at Stourhead: he patronized John Wootton, Samuel Woodforde, and his namesake, William Hoare of Bath (no relation, but whose daughter Mary married Hoare's nephew Henry, known as &#145;Fat Harry&#146; (1744&#150;1785) in 1765). Among his old masters were two pictures by Nicolas Poussin, a double portrait by Carlo Maratta (<span class="italic">Marchese Pallavicini and the Artist</span>), and pictures by Rembrandt, Gaspard Dughet, and Claude-Joseph Vernet. He commissioned <span class="italic">Caesar and Cleopatra</span> from Anton Raffael Mengs in 1758 as a companion to the Maratta. Both pictures remained in the house, though many were sold at the Stourhead heirlooms sale at Christies in 1883. The sculptor John Michael Rysbrack was associated with Stourhead from 1744 to his death in 1770. His <span class="italic">Hercules</span> (1756) is in the Pantheon at Stourhead, together with his <span class="italic">Flora</span> (1761).<br>
<br>Not only was Stourhead an attractive and dependable asset for the bank's customers, but also, Hoare's profits exceeding &pound;10,000 p.a., it enabled him to make generous provision for his daughters, and to increase his country estates in addition to spending well on them. He was troubled in his old age by the threat to the country and his beloved Stourhead, by Lord North's weak wartime government, leading to &#145;public calamity&#146; and &#145;our ruin&#146;. Accordingly, on Colt Hoare's betrothal to Hester Lyttelton in 1783, he settled his estate on his grandson, provided all connection with the bank was severed. He left his share of the bank, and his house in Lincoln's Inn Fields, to Colt's father, his nephew (and son-in-law) Richard, who felt deprived of his full inheritance. Hoare moved to his house, The Wilderness, Clapham, designed for him by Flitcroft thirty years before, where he died on 8 September 1785, his children having predeceased him. He was buried in Stourton churchyard.<br>
