<span class="headword">Porter, Sir  Charles</span>  (1631&#150;1696), <span class="occ">politician and lord chancellor of Ireland</span>, was born on 6 September 1631, the second son of Edmund Porter (<i>d</i>. 1670?), rector of Heveningham, Norfolk, and prebendary of Norwich, and his wife, Mary, daughter of Sir Charles Chibborne of Messing Hall, Essex. In his youth Porter served as an apprentice in Norwich, until his involvement in the royalist riots in 1648 necessitated a rapid escape to the Netherlands, where he initially served as an enlisted soldier, and then kept an eating-house for cavaliers. This latter venture failed owing to the inability of his clientele to pay their bills, so that Porter soon returned to England, where he found employment as an under-clerk in chancery. In 1656 he entered the Middle Temple, was called to the bar in 1663, became a bencher in 1682, a reader in 1685, and treasurer in 1688. He was married twice, first, in 1666, to Sarah Mitchell of Edmonton, Middlesex, and second, in 1671, to Letitia (<i>d</i>. 1692), daughter and coheir of Bartholomew Coxeter of Weald Manor, Bampton, Oxfordshire, with whom he had a son and two daughters.<br>
<br>Porter's legal career was marked by a steady rise through related government offices. In 1660 he was appointed solicitor to James, duke of York, a post he held until 1685. In 1678 he was made deputy remembrancer, and in 1688 remembrancer, of the first fruits and tenth parts in the exchequer, which office he held until his death. From the outset he proved to be an able lawyer, though his career also benefited from his association with Francis North, Baron Guilford, and his involvement as a junior counsel in a case in 1675 which brought into question the jurisdiction of the House of Lords and which resulted in Porter and his three associates being sent to the Tower by the House of Commons on 4 June. His imprisonment was short-lived, owing to the prorogation of parliament five days later. In 1685, at the outset of James II's reign, Porter was elected MP for Tregony, while in the same year he was made a king's counsel. In early 1686 he was knighted and was also appointed lord chancellor of Ireland, a post which carried with it the speakership of the Irish House of Lords and a salary of &pound;1000 p.a., which in May 1686 was increased by &pound;500. With other perquisites of office the theoretical annual income for the lord chancellor was &pound;1900. This remuneration may have represented the main reason for Porter's acceptance of a post in a country where he had no familial, political, or professional connections, as despite his successful legal career he was always in financial difficulty, reputedly because of his great liking for &#145;women and the bottle&#146;  (North, 1.382). Burnet believed that Porter's appointment was made on the grounds that his financial problems would ensure that he was a &#145;person fit to be made a tool of&#146; by the king  (<span class="italic">Bishop Burnet's History</span>, 3.73). However, Porter was not as pliable as was expected, and his first sojourn in Ireland proved a difficult time. His appointment was not looked upon favourably by the lord lieutenant of Ireland, Henry Hyde, second earl of Clarendon, though Porter's early activity, especially in declaring to everyone that James II would not tamper with the <span class="roman">Acts of Settlement</span>, soon altered Clarendon's opinion, the earl later recounting that Porter was one of only two honest lawyers he met with on a visit to the Temple in January 1689. However, it was Porter's failure to maintain good relations with James II's future Irish chief governor, the Roman Catholic Richard Talbot, earl of Tyrconnell, which led to his dismissal in early 1687. Porter's experiences in Ireland served to alienate him from James II, and it was not surprising that despite his high-church tory leanings he was an early adherent of William of Orange in 1688. His attitude did not harm his stalled legal career either, as he was reappointed king's counsel under William and Mary, and in 1690 lord chancellor of Ireland and one of the lords justices appointed to act as chief governors.<br>
<br>Having been returned on petition as MP for New Windsor in May 1690, Porter travelled to Ireland later that year. He spent the next two years serving as a lord justice alongside Thomas Coningsby, who was joint Irish paymaster and receiver-general with Charles Fox. Initially Porter's period in office was dominated by the need to bring the war in Ireland to a speedy conclusion, and although not party to the negotiations of the articles of Limerick in September&#150;October 1691, he was one of the main signatories of the treaty. However, his association with this treaty, which was disliked by many Irish protestants for its apparently beneficial treatment of Jacobites and Roman Catholics, and his earlier association with James II's reign in Ireland, earned him many enemies in the Irish body politic. At the same time accusations of mismanagement and corruption in the government during 1690&#150;92 reflected badly upon the lords justices, not least because of Coningsby's central role in the Treasury. Porter, by association if not actual involvement, suffered the consequences of the investigations into these accusations over the next few years.<br>
<br>The first crisis for Porter arose in the Irish parliament of October&#150;November 1692, when the Commons took the opportunity, presented by the delay in sending the main body of government legislation from England, to embark upon detailed investigations into the management of government, the embezzlement of forfeitures, and the favour shown to Roman Catholics. The lord lieutenant, Henry, Lord Sidney, who had replaced Porter and Coningsby as chief governor earlier in the year and who was closely associated with Porter, having served briefly as a lord justice with him in 1690, prorogued parliament before matters could come to a head. However, this action only delayed the attack on Porter. In February 1693 the complaints raised in Ireland were brought before the English parliament by several Irish MPs, supported by English whig MPs. Although the whigs were using Irish affairs primarily as a way to disrupt government business in Westminster, the investigations and ensuing addresses to the king from both houses further undermined Porter's position, which was made evident in June when Sidney's removal resulted in his being appointed only as an interim lord justice prior to the arrival of three new lords justices, despite it being the case that the lord chancellor was usually a member of any such commission. The English parliament's investigations had also prompted Porter and Coningsby to request a royal pardon for their time in the Irish government. This action prompted a petition in June requesting that the pardon be stopped, as it was intended to impeach both men in the next session of the English parliament. Although the petition received little countenance at the privy council, Porter still had to travel to England in the autumn to defend himself against the impeachment brought before the English Commons on 16 December 1693. The impeachment was dismissed by the house on 29 January 1694.<br>
<br>With the granting of a royal pardon in April 1694 it appeared that Porter's travails were at an end. However, two factors combined in Ireland to ensure that there was to be one last attack on him. The first was the continuing desire of leading Irish opposition MPs to bring about his downfall, and the second was the presence of the whig Henry, Lord Capell, in the commission of lords justices. Capell's political opinions were diametrically opposed to Porter's, while it is also evident that he believed that Irish affairs would benefit from Porter's removal from office. Capell, who had formed an alliance with the leading Irish opposition MPs, was made lord deputy in May 1695, with orders to summon parliament. Porter's fear that this new court party, made up of men who had led the previous attacks upon him, would do so again in parliament, proved true, and on 30 September articles of high crimes and misdemeanours were presented against him in the Irish Commons. The impeachment proceedings were eventually rejected 121 to 77, following a personal appearance in the Commons by Porter on 25 October. Although once again saved from impeachment, his remaining fourteen months alive were far from peaceful. The conflict between himself and the Capellite party continued unabated, including a personal affront by the speaker of the Commons, Robert Rochfort, following the rejection of the impeachment, and an attempt by a section of the Irish government to exclude him from the commission of lords justices following Capell's death in May 1696, while in the autumn there were rumours that a further attempt to impeach him would be made in Westminster. However, no such action was taken as Porter died suddenly of an apoplexy, on the evening of 8 December 1696, while writing a letter in the study of his house in Chancery Lane, Dublin. He was buried at Christ Church, Dublin. His financial circumstances were such that he left no provision for his family, and although leading junto whigs believed that Porter's death was good for the king's affairs, William III felt differently, and granted a parcel of forfeited lands to the family in order to provide for Porter's two daughters. This grant was the only one to be exempted from the <span class="roman">Resumption Act</span> in 1700, suggesting Porter's reputation among English tories remained high after his death.<br>
