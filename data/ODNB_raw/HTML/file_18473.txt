<span class="headword">Meadowcourt,  Richard</span>  (<em>c.</em>1695&#150;1760), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and literary critic</span>, the son of Richard Meadowcourt, was born at Worcester. He matriculated at Merton College, Oxford, on 9 March 1710, graduated BA in 1714, and proceeded MA in 1718. He was also elected one of six whig fellows at Merton College in 1718. This happened at a time when there was great pressure to elect tories as fellows  (Ward, 99&#150;100).<br>
<br>Meadowcourt's university experience included membership of the whig-orientated Constitution Club, in which he served as the club steward. Founded by students with whig proclivities, the club sought to oppose perceived treasonous attitudes at the university on the part of the tories, then dominant at Oxford. Meadowcourt's involvement with the group led to a two-year delay in the granting of his MA. Nicholas Amhurst's <span class="italic">Terrae filius</span> (1726) alleged that Meadowcourt was disciplined for fomenting rebellion against the university. He was fined 40<i>s</i>. for being out after 9.00 p.m., and also had his name placed in the proctor's black book, which meant that he would not receive his degree until giving satisfaction to the proctor. Allegedly these actions were taken because he drank to the health of King George I. He finally received his degree in 1718 on the basis of a royal decree of grace  (Amhurst, 116&#150;20, 130&#150;1, 284).<br>
<br>Meadowcourt's political and religious positions, including his flirtation with Bangorianism, delayed his long-sought preferment in the church. His ecclesiastical career began only in 1727, when he was appointed vicar of Oakley, Buckinghamshire. He was passed over for the nomination as warden of Merton College in 1734, but on 15 October 1735 he was instituted a canon of the cathedral at Worcester. Following this appointment Meadowcourt was able to add to his preferments the vicarage of Quinton, Gloucestershire, in 1738 and the rectory of St Martin's, Worcester, in 1738. In 1751 he received his final preferment, as vicar of Lindridge, Worcestershire. He resided at Lindridge until he died, apparently unmarried, on 8 September 1760.<br>
<br>Meadowcourt's literary career was marked by the publication of eleven sermons, including <span class="italic">The Nature of Truth Defin'd, and it's Definition Apply'd to the Holy Scriptures</span> (1724; 2nd edn, 1725), and <span class="italic">Popery disarmed of those weapons of force, and those instruments of fraud, in which it chiefly trusts</span> (1740). The latter sermon was preached at the cathedral at Worcester on 5 November 1739. He also devoted attention to the literary world, especially John Milton. His <span class="italic">Critique of Milton's &#145;Paradise Regain'd&#146;</span> (1732; 2nd expanded edn, 1748) is considered by modern scholars to be the first critical study of Milton's epic poem, precipitating a &#145;re-evaluation of the brief epic&#146;  (Wittreich, vi, xiv). In Bishop Thomas Newton's edition of <span class="italic">Paradise Regain'd</span> (1752), Meadowcourt provided manuscript remarks and explanations for several difficult lines in the poem. Although he was an early Milton scholar, modern scholars have questioned his insight into the work. One has suggested that &#145;there is little penetration in Meadowcourt's analysis of the characters of the poem&#146;, and has concluded that the &#145;frankness and outspokenness of this artistic utilitarianism and classicism is that of a clergyman apparently more intent on professional sermonizing and instruction than on the study of literary subtleties&#146;  (Oras, 221).<br>
