<div class="para">
<span class="headword">FitzRoy,  Augustus Henry</span>, third duke of Grafton  (1735&#150;1811), <span class="occ">prime minister</span>, was born on 28 September 1735, the elder of the two surviving sons of Lord Augustus FitzRoy (1716&#150;1741), a naval officer and the younger son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/93055/', "Charles FitzRoy, second duke of Grafton")</script>, and his wife, Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1788), the daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/68523/', "Colonel William Cosby")</script>, governor of New York.<h2>
<a name="Earlylifeandcareer"></a>Early life and career</h2>FitzRoy's father died of fever in Jamaica, where he was serving with the navy, before the boy's sixth birthday, and his uncle, Lord Euston, died in 1747, so that from an early age Augustus Henry, who from 1747 enjoyed the courtesy title earl of Euston, was heir to an important title. His mother married again, to James Jeffreys, that same year. Euston's relations with his stepfather seem to have been friendly, to judge at least from the duke's later willingness to seek favours both for him and his daughter. However, his mother and stepfather had little involvement with his education, which was rather more influenced by his paternal grandfather, lord chamberlain for thirty-three years and a close friend of the duke of Newcastle. He was educated at Hackney School and from 1751 to 1753 at Peterhouse, Cambridge. In 1753&#150;4 he completed his education in the manner appropriate to an eighteenth-century gentleman by going on the grand tour with a Swiss tutor named All&eacute;on.<br>
<br>On 29 January 1756 Euston married Anne [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/88658/', "Fitzpatrick, Anne, countess of Upper Ossory (1737/&#150;1804)")</script>], the daughter and heir of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/40432/', "Henry Liddell, first Baron Ravensworth (bap. 1708, d. 1784)")</script>, a coal owner, of Eslington, Northumberland, and Anne Delm&eacute; (1712&#150;1794). They had three children, Georgiana (<i>b</i>. 1757), <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9634/', "George Henry FitzRoy, later the fourth duke (1760&#150;1844)")</script>, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9631/', "Charles FitzRoy (1764&#150;1829)")</script>, but the marriage was not a happy one. Temperamental differences led first to separation, in January 1764, and finally to divorce, granted by act of parliament on 23 March 1769. In June 1761 the couple had set off on an extended continental tour, thought by some to be an attempt to patch up an already faltering marriage. It was not a success. Horace Walpole's correspondent Sir Horace Mann later commented (17 April 1762): &#145;I saw such seeds of disagreement when they were here [Florence] as too plainly showed that they neither of them meant to contribute to the other's happiness&#146;  (Walpole, <span class="italic">Corr.</span>, 22.279&#150;80). By the time their third child was born in July 1764 they were virtually living apart and he had already established his relationship with the courtesan Nancy Parsons (<i>c</i>.1735&#150;1814/15), the daughter of a London tailor and the former mistress of Horton, or Houghton, a West Indies merchant. He attended the races with her in June 1764, and in September Lord Barrington reported: &#145;The Duke of Grafton &hellip; lives incognito at Woodford in Essex with Nancy Parsons&#146;  (Barrington to Buckinghamshire, 24 Sept 1764, <span class="italic">Lothian MSS</span>, 252). Proceedings for a separation were begun a few weeks later. The duchess had an affair with John Fitzpatrick, second earl of Upper Ossory, whom she married on 26 March 1769, having given birth to their son in August 1768.<br>
<br>In November 1756 Euston was appointed a lord of the bedchamber to the prince of Wales, a post he held until June 1758. In May 1757 he was appointed lord lieutenant of Suffolk. He was dismissed in December 1762 for voting against the peace preliminaries but was reappointed in 1769 and served until 1790. He also held the posts of recorder of Thetford and Coventry and high steward of Dartmouth, hereditary ranger of Whittlebury and Salcey forests, and several sinecures, including places in the king's bench, common pleas, and court of exchequer. In September 1769 he was appointed KG.<br>
<br>Euston's political career began in November 1756, shortly after his twenty-first birthday, when he was elected MP for both Boroughbridge, Yorkshire, and Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk. He chose to represent the latter, but held the seat for only a few months, until his grandfather's death and his own elevation to the House of Lords the following May. Neither in the Commons nor in the Lords at this period of his life was Grafton especially active, though it was a formative time in establishing his political allegiances. While he was loosely connected with his grandfather's great friend the duke of Newcastle and his circle, and on friendly terms with the Cavendishes (Lord John Cavendish had been his contemporary at Cambridge), the politician he most admired was William Pitt. He had met Pitt quite early in his childhood, and seems to have been treated with rare warmth both by Pitt himself and by his brother-in-law Lord Temple. Both in England and while on his second continental tour Grafton wrote to Pitt on matters relating to politics and patronage.<br>
<br>Grafton's connection with Pitt was to be central to his political career, though in fact it was with Newcastle's circle that he re-entered politics on his return in 1762. In the run-up to the 1762 session and subsequently Grafton took a leading role among Newcastle's &#145;young friends&#146;, where his warmth and zeal were frequently remarked upon. He led for the opposition in the debate on the peace preliminaries on 9 December 1762, and, though he spoke rather personally against Lord Bute, his speech was commended and was an early indication of his talent for debate. His political rise was noted by Horace Walpole, who observed the following year that Grafton was much commended and was in the front rank of politics. While maintaining his association with the young friends, Grafton also developed links with the senior whigs, the marquess of Rockingham, the duke of Devonshire, and the duke of Cumberland. More than most of Newcastle's circle, however, Grafton kept in contact with Pitt and Temple. In May 1763, following Temple's lead, he attempted to visit John Wilkes in the Tower, an action significant not only as evidence of his association with Temple, but also because of the sentiments which prompted him to go, &#145;to hear from himself his own story and his defence; and to shew that no influence ought to stop the means of every man's justifying himself from an accusation, even though it should be of the most heinous kind&#146;  (Grafton to Temple, 3 May 1763, <span class="italic">Autobiography &hellip; of Grafton</span>, 191).<br>
<br>Pitt's negotiations to form a ministry in August 1763 failed, and George III patched up his relationship with George Grenville. However, it remained an uneasy relationship, and by the spring of 1765 he was determined to remove Grenville from office and to change his administration. In May he commissioned his uncle, the duke of Cumberland, to commence negotiations. On 14 May Cumberland communicated with Pitt and Temple, Rockingham and Newcastle, and also (though it appears not to have been part of his instructions) summoned Grafton. Though Grafton and Cumberland had had several contacts in recent months, both in political matters and at Newmarket, Grafton was not one of the principal members of Newcastle's circle, and Cumberland's decision to involve him was almost certainly due to Pitt's supposed regard for him and Grafton's own regard for and connection with Pitt. Indeed, Cumberland used Grafton as an intermediary more than once. In spite of strenuous efforts by Cumberland, however, Pitt refused to accept office. Eventually the king agreed to appoint an administration with the marquess of Rockingham at its head. Grafton accepted office as secretary of state for the northern department on condition Pitt could join as head when he wished.<h2>
<a name="SecretaryofstateandfirstlordoftheTreasury17651767"></a>Secretary of state and first lord of the Treasury, 1765&#150;1767</h2>Grafton's appointment as secretary of state came as no surprise. Though inexperienced (as were many in the administration), Grafton had proven abilities. Clearly apprehensive about his new responsibilities, Grafton commented to Lord Gower, &#145;that, like a girl who is going to be married, he felt himself much pleased with the general idea, but much frightened as the hour drew nigh&#146;  (<span class="italic">Eglinton MSS</span>, 390). He turned out to be a respectably diligent minister and a capable advocate in the Lords. But his connection with Pitt was at least as important as his untried skills. In spite of Pitt's refusal to take part and the manner of that refusal, the new ministry hoped for his acquiescence if not his active support. Grafton's links with Pitt were seen as an advantage to the administration, a signal to Pitt that ministers were serious. In the event, however, Grafton's connection turned out to be a weakness rather than a source of strength. He himself later asserted that he had accepted office only on the understanding that efforts would be made to bring Pitt in. Although Pitt's demands grew increasingly unreasonable, Grafton never wavered from this resolve, and when Rockingham and the king, finally exasperated beyond measure at Pitt, refused to continue with negotiations, Grafton determined to resign.<br>
<br>Grafton resigned as secretary of state on 14 May 1766. As he himself put it, he had gone out of office not &#145;from a love of ease and indulgence to his private amusements, as had been falsely reported, but because they wanted strength, which one man only could supply&#146;, and that &#145;though he had carried a general's staff, he was ready to take up a mattock or spade under that able and great minister&#146;  (bishop of Carlisle to Grenville, 29 May 1766, <span class="italic">Grenville Papers</span>, 3.243). Two months later the ministry fell. Pitt this time accepted the king's invitation to form an administration, and, following Temple's refusal of the post of first lord of the Treasury, persuaded Grafton to accept it. Grafton was reluctant, and according to his own later account, accepted only because Pitt threatened to withdraw if he refused:<blockquote>Here all that I wished to see established, together with all that I dreaded for myself, crowded at once on my mind &hellip; If Mr Pitt's threatenings were to be realised it was easy to see the confusion into which the country would be plunged, and possibly that I should be marked as the principal cause of the disaster. (<span class="italic">Autobiography &hellip; of Grafton</span>, 90)</blockquote>Having accepted, however, Grafton took little part in forming the administration. In all matters, even to the appointing of his own Treasury board, he deferred to Pitt. This was to be typical of his role throughout the next few months, as he relied entirely on Pitt for direction, and would scarcely take even the smallest decision without Pitt's approval. And indeed, he was given little encouragement to act independently, for Pitt could be devastatingly critical of anyone who deviated from the line he had laid down. Yet Pitt's leadership was inadequate from the beginning. In the first place he seriously weakened his position by accepting a peerage (as earl of Chatham). Then, through illness, he spent long periods in Bath, too far removed from the centre of affairs to exercise detailed control. By March 1767 he had been overtaken by illness and was completely incapable of political activity. Grafton, who had not been appointed to direct affairs, was reluctant to take responsibility as long as there was a chance of Chatham's recovery. But such a lack of direction was almost disastrous for the ministry, which suffered both internal division and opposition in parliament. Disunity in the cabinet over East India Company affairs ended in the adoption of a policy totally at variance with Chatham's opinions; the government suffered defeat in February on an opposition motion to reduce the land tax; and throughout the spring it had to grapple with the potentially divisive problem of the disobedience of New York to the <span class="roman">Mutiny Act</span> and the issue of raising an American revenue. Opposition to the ministry's handling of American issues built up during April and May, and Grafton was faced with the very real prospect of defeat. When the ministry's majority in the House of Lords, normally the stronghold of administration, sank to three on 26 May 1767 he was very close to resignation.<br>
<br>That Grafton did not resign was due partly to support and encouragement from Lord Northington, lord president of the council, but most of all to the determined encouragement of the king. It took another month for Grafton to build up sufficient resolution to take on responsibility for leading the administration, and to shake off what by now had become his fear of Chatham. As long as Chatham remained nominally at the head of the ministry he was a destabilizing influence, and the weeks between the vote on 26 May and the beginning of negotiations with the opposition in early July were critical in freeing Grafton from dependence on Chatham and securing his loyalty to George III. Throughout June attempts were made to persuade Chatham to return, but to no avail. Eventually George III, Grafton, and Northington attempted to force Chatham's hand, saying that he must either come forth or retire completely. In the event this stratagem too failed, but Chatham's refusal to respond seems to have been sufficient to persuade Grafton to go ahead alone.<h2>
<a name="Primeminister"></a>Prime minister</h2>Grafton now in effect became prime minister, though he remained acting head of the administration until Chatham's eventual resignation in October 1768. His first task was to strengthen the administration. Initially he was unsuccessful. In the negotiations of July he succeeded in splitting the opposition but not in gaining any support. But at the end of the year, following renewed negotiations with the Bedford group, he secured their accession to the ministry. Before this he had secured the appointment of Lord North as chancellor of the exchequer, following the death of the mercurial but unreliable Charles Townshend. The terms with the Bedfords included two cabinet posts, one of which was obtained by the transfer of Henry Seymour Conway (hitherto one of Grafton's closest colleagues and friends) from secretary of state to lieutenant-general of the ordnance, though he retained cabinet rank. A by-product of the negotiations was the division of the southern secretaryship and the creation of a new post of secretary of state for the colonies: this had important consequences for the future both by the alienation of Lord Shelburne (holder of the southern secretaryship) and in the appointment of the relatively hard-line Lord Hillsborough to the new post.<br>
<br>These changes gave Grafton some useful additional votes in parliament and some effective departmental ministers. North in particular proved himself an able colleague both at the exchequer and in parliament, where he soon took over the leadership of the House of Commons from Conway. But the alliance with the Bedford group did little to strengthen the cabinet, which remained throughout the ministry rather a collection of individuals than a powerful united body. Indeed, Grafton's principal weakness as head of the administration was his inability to weld together a united cabinet. Partly this was due to the personal and political differences of the individuals involved: the cabinet was an uneasy amalgam of ex-<script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/95095', "Chathamites")</script> (such as Camden, Conway, and Shelburne), members of the Bedford group (such as Weymouth and Rochford), and strong-willed individualists without any particular allegiance (such as Hillsborough). But partly also it was due to Grafton's own personality. Personally more industrious than has often been admitted, he was not a strong leader. He believed in collective responsibility, but was all too often unable either to achieve a collective view or to quell dissent. Naturally conciliatory, he also inclined to inaction rather than to risk stirring up trouble. All these characteristics were to become evident in the major issues facing the ministry during the next two years.<br>
<br>Within a few weeks of its formation, Grafton's new administration was put to the test by the re-emergence of John Wilkes on to the political stage. Though still outlawed, Wilkes had returned to England in February 1768. The following month he stood as candidate for the City of London in the general election. Defeated but undaunted, he tried again in Middlesex, where, to the accompaniment of much riotous behaviour, he came top of the poll. The ministry was faced with two problems: one was the preservation of public order; the other, a much more delicate political question, was what to do with Wilkes.<br>
<br>On the question of public order Grafton was quite prepared to back strong measures, as soon as they were seen to be necessary&#151;though he had been reluctant to give the impression of &#145;finding fault only with the People for their Joy too riotously testified at the late Election&#146;  (Grafton to George III, 31 March 1768, <span class="italic">Correspondence of George III</span>, 2.605). It was the duty of government to keep order and preserve society and the constitution. Although Grafton took little part in arranging measures&#151;this was Weymouth's department&#151;he gave his approval to a policy of vigour. In the case of Wilkes himself, Grafton's natural reaction was one of caution. Remembering the trouble that Wilkes had caused Grenville in 1763&#150;4, he had no desire to give gratuitous offence by ill-advised intervention. But those who had pressed for vigorous action against the rioters were also anxious to punish Wilkes. The king adopted a similar attitude. Considering his sense of duty to the king, it is perhaps surprising that Grafton went as far as he did to avoid the application of hard-line measures against Wilkes. He succeeded in ignoring calls for Wilkes's expulsion from the House of Commons for the remainder of the session, and might have avoided facing the issue altogether had not Wilkes published in December what amounted to an accusation that the government had deliberately contrived and premeditated the &#145;massacre of St George's Fields&#146; earlier in the year (an occasion when troops had been employed against rioters and seven people had been killed). This revived calls for Wilkes's expulsion and, crucially, turned Grafton from opposing the move to acquiescing in it. Several cabinet colleagues remained opposed&#151;a situation which would cause Grafton difficulties in the future&#151;but when Barrington moved, on 3 February 1769, that Wilkes be expelled it was carried by a large majority.<br>
<br>The other major issue that Grafton's administration faced concerned the attitude to be adopted towards the American colonies, which had offered severe provocation during 1768. Grafton was again in a difficult position. On this issue the cabinet was more definitely polarized into authoritarian and conciliatory camps than it had been over Wilkes. Grafton once again favoured moderation, and once again faced a strong force of hard-line opinion. He hoped to defuse the situation and avoid a division in the ministry by offering a compromise solution, but it met with little enthusiasm in the cabinet, and Grafton, though disappointed, did not press it. The crucial decision came in May 1769, when the cabinet met to discuss Townshend's 1767 customs duties. The cabinet was determined that the duties be repealed, but was divided on the question of whether the duty on tea should be retained, as an assertion of the right of parliament to tax the colonies. Hillsborough's proposal that the tea duty be retained was accepted by five votes to four&#151;with Grafton in the minority.<h2>
<a name="Secondmarriage"></a>Second marriage</h2>Although political problems continued to trouble him throughout the spring of 1769, in his personal life Grafton enjoyed a short respite. Since the beginning of his premiership he had been associated with Nancy Parsons. In the early days, though scarcely concealing the relationship, he had acted with some decorum, arousing gossip rather than scandal. In 1768, however, following the return of his mistress from an extended trip abroad, Grafton threw caution to the winds and offended even the relatively lax society of the day by openly consorting with her, entertaining with her at his London house, and accompanying her to the opera. But this proved to be a final fling. Early in the following year he ended the relationship. At about the same time, on 23 March 1769, his divorce proceedings against his first wife were completed. Now a free man, he began to pay court to the woman who was to be his wife for the next forty years. Elizabeth (1745&#150;1822) was the second daughter of Sir Richard Wrottesley, seventh baronet, dean of Worcester, and his wife, Mary Leveson-Gower, and the niece of the duchess of Bedford. The engagement was announced on 18 May and the marriage took place at Woburn on 24 June. Immediately afterwards the duke and duchess departed for Wakefield Lodge. The duke of Bedford, who dined with them a few days later, noted in his journal: &#145;It was a great satisfaction to see how happy they were, and how well pleased with each other&#146;  (<span class="italic">Cavendish's Debates</span>, 2.619). The couple had twelve children. Grafton's cast-off mistress, Nancy Parsons, found a new lover in the third duke of Dorset, and then married Charles Maynard, second Viscount Maynard (1752&#150;1824), a landowner, in the summer of 1776; she died in France in the winter of 1814&#150;15.<br>
<br>Shortly after his wedding Grafton left for Cambridge to be installed, on 1 July, as chancellor of the university, a post to which he had been unanimously elected the previous autumn. The customary ode on the occasion was written by the poet Thomas Gray, who had been appointed to the professorship of modern history through Grafton's influence. To celebrate the occasion, Grafton offered &pound;500 towards paving and lighting the town.<h2>
<a name="Resignationandlatercareer"></a>Resignation and later career</h2>However, politics could not be put out of mind for long. Savage attacks in the press on the government in general and on Grafton in particular had intensified with the arrival on the scene of &#145;Junius&#146; in January 1769. Between March and July, Junius wrote five letters directly addressed to Grafton and several more attacking him in a very personal way. Meanwhile, opposition to the government's measures against Wilkes were voiced through the petitioning movement in the country at large. Grafton's reaction was concern for the constitution but fear that too vigorous repression would only make matters worse. Finally there was the reappearance of Chatham. Chatham attended court on 7 July, when his manner towards Grafton was particularly cold and ungracious. As the autumn progressed it became clear that he intended to start the new season in opposition and also that he intended to attempt to break up the ministry by detaching Camden and Granby from their allegiance to Grafton.<br>
<br>It is unclear whether Chatham hoped to persuade Camden and Granby to resign, or whether, by fostering dissension in the cabinet, to force Grafton into resignation and bring about an opening for himself. Undoubtedly at this period relations between Chatham and Grafton reached their lowest ebb. Chatham worked hard in the weeks leading up to the session, and when parliament met in January 1770 he and the Rockingham group launched a strong attack on the government. The divisions in the Commons showed but a slender majority for the government. Worse, Grafton suffered defections from the cabinet. Camden resigned on 17 January and Granby, after wavering, followed suit. Grafton had now lost the last of the colleagues with whom he had entered government in 1766. In spite of their differences, Grafton found the loss of Camden a severe blow. Encouraged by the king he made an attempt to persuade Charles Yorke to take the seals. Yorke hesitated, accepted, and within three days of accepting was dead, widely believed to have committed suicide. Grafton then made a half-hearted attempt to persuade William de Grey to accept. When this too failed, so did Grafton's resolution to continue. Out of loyalty to the king he delayed his resignation until George III had secured Lord North's agreement to take over. Grafton left office on 30 January 1770.<br>
<br>It is often assumed that George III saw Grafton's resignation as a desertion, and it is true that in later years the king did describe it in such terms. At the time, however, the relationship between the two men remained cordial, and on several occasions in the succeeding months the king referred to his esteem for the duke. Grafton continued to support North's administration, speaking vigorously in its defence in debates in the Lords. Indeed, he soon found himself wishing to be back in office. He let it be known that he was interested in taking the Admiralty, though in the event this went to Lord Sandwich when the post became vacant in 1771, and Grafton had to wait until the summer when a vacancy in the office of lord privy seal occurred, though he did not regain a seat in cabinet. His support for the administration continued, though with gradually diminishing ardour. The issue on which he finally parted company with North was America, and after speaking against North's American policy he resigned on 9 November 1775.<br>
<br>An attempt was made in February 1779 to bring Grafton and some other former Chathamites back into administration, but it was unsuccessful, and he remained in opposition until the fall of North in 1782. In Rockingham's second administration he was again made lord privy seal. Following the death of Rockingham in July 1782 he continued to serve under Shelburne, but as differences between the two men widened Grafton found it increasingly difficult to support the ministry, and he resigned with the rest of the cabinet in February 1783. He opposed the Fox&#150;North coalition (though this did not prevent him from subsequently establishing friendly relationships with Fox), and initially remained cool towards the younger Pitt, declining the offer of the post of lord privy seal. He later warmed to Pitt, though he continued to decline office and does not appear to have spoken in parliament. Nevertheless, he gave his support until disagreements over foreign policy led him back into opposition in 1794. He never again held office, though he maintained an interest in politics until his death. His autobiography, written in 1804, is largely an account of his political life.<h2>
<a name="Privatelife"></a>Private life</h2>Grafton's withdrawal from a leading role in government allowed him to devote more time to his other interests. He had always enjoyed hunting and racing, and even during his administration was regularly to be seen at Newmarket and Ascot. His kennels and his stables enjoyed a widespread renown. He also maintained a lively interest in agricultural matters. One writer recalls an occasion, in the midst of his premiership, when he was to be found in the dirtiest corner of a Northampton fair talking to a group of graziers about bullocks. In later years he corresponded with Arthur Young, inviting that noted agriculturist to Euston, Suffolk, on a number of occasions, and he was an occasional contributor to Young's <span class="italic">Annals of Agriculture</span>. In 1793 he was one of the first members appointed to the newly formed board of agriculture. He was not a great builder (both Wakefield Lodge and Euston Hall had been remodelled in his grandfather's time), though he was responsible for further building work at Wakefield Lodge in 1770&#150;71; however, he was noted for developing his estates, establishing a large home farm at Wakefield Lodge, and bringing into cultivation at Euston an extensive acreage that had previously been only rough grazing. He employed Capability Brown to improve the grounds at Euston, while Young recorded that on one of his visits he spent two days taking the levels of the river to see how much ground the duke might water. He took a keen interest in new techniques in husbandry&#151;&#145;willing to try any experiment, promising to be of public utility&#146;, as Arthur Young put it  (Young, 15.305)&#151;and successfully introduced drilling as a method of sowing crops on his Suffolk estates, where he also, with encouraging results, mixed some South Down sheep among his large flock of Norfolks. As lord lieutenant of Suffolk he took an active part in the manoeuvres of the Suffolk militia during the invasion scares in 1778&#150;9.<br>
<br>From 1770 onwards Grafton developed an increasing interest in theological matters. At Cambridge he was associated with a number of liberal churchmen. Among his friends and correspondents were John Hinchcliffe, bishop of Peterborough, and Richard Watson, bishop of Llandaff, and latterly the Unitarian divine Thomas Belsham. In 1773 he supported a bill to release Anglican clergy from the necessity of subscribing to the <span class="roman">Thirty-Nine Articles</span>, and the following year he became one of the first members of the Unitarian congregation at Essex Street Chapel. His support for unitarianism was personal and did not extend to his family: his son Henry entered the church and became canon of Westminster. He published two theological works, <span class="italic">Hints Submitted to the Serious Attention of the Clergy, Nobility and Gentry, by a Layman</span> (1789), which urged amendment of life by the upper classes and greater attention to public worship, together with a revision of the liturgy; and <span class="italic">The Serious Reflections of a Rational Christian from 1788&#150;1797</span> (1797), which argued in favour of unitarianism. He also supported the publication of Richard Watson's <span class="italic">Considerations on the Expediency of Revising the Liturgy and Articles of the Church of England</span> (1790), and was responsible for the costs of printing 700 copies of an edition of Griesbach's Greek <span class="roman">New Testament</span> in 1796. His personal library, sold after his death, was extensive and included a number of rare works. He died on 14 March 1811 at Euston Hall, and was buried at Euston on 21 March.<h2>
<a name="Reputation"></a>Reputation</h2>Grafton was much criticized in his lifetime and fared little better after his death. But most of his contemporary critics were also his political enemies or, like Horace Walpole (who felt the duke had treated his close friend Conway badly), men who had personal reasons for attacking him. Walpole began by admiring Grafton, and in 1765 presented the duke with a copy of the first edition of <span class="italic">The Castle of Otranto</span> as a token of friendship, but by 1768 he described him as a man who thought &#145;the world should be postponed to a whore and a horse race&#146;  (Walpole to Conway, 16 June 1768, Walpole, <span class="italic">Corr.</span>, 39.101); in his memoirs he referred variously to the duke's &#145;moody and capricious temper&#146;, his &#145;disgusting coldness&#146;, his &#145;sullen negligence&#146;, and his &#145;mutability&#146;  (Walpole, <span class="italic">Memoirs</span>, 3.179, 76, 137, 91). Coupled with Junius's descriptions of the duke&#151;most memorably as &#145;sullen and severe without religion, profligate without gaiety&#146;  (Junius to Grafton, 30 May 1769, <span class="italic">Letters of Junius</span>, 69)&#151;this is the picture transmitted to posterity, and often repeated by historians. Other contemporaries, by contrast, presented a different picture. Joseph Cradock in his memoirs wrote of him as &#145;punctual in his dealings, kind to his domestics, hospitable to strangers and faithful to his friends&#146;  (Cradock, 1.116&#150;17); and John Almon (who from his connection with Wilkes might be expected to have been unfavourable) referred to Grafton's &#145;honourable character, his virtues as a patriot, and his talents as a statesman&#146;  (Almon, 1.26). Almon, indeed, writing about the early 1770s, described Grafton as one of those disinterested politicians whose support for administration &#145;becomes a pledge to the public that the steps taken by the ministry are taken upon the proper ground&#146;  (ibid., 1.24)&#151;of all the tributes that could have been made, almost certainly the one that would have pleased him most. Personally not always the most relaxed and engaging of men, Grafton nevertheless established and maintained lifelong friendships with men from a variety of backgrounds. His friendship with Richard Stonehewer, his old Cambridge tutor, lasted until the latter's death in 1809, while John Symonds, master of Peterhouse, was a regular Christmas guest at Euston for more than thirty years from the early 1770s. Among politicians his longest and closest friendship was with Camden, who in one of his last letters wrote of his &#145;real attachment and regard&#146; for the duke  (Camden to Grafton, 15 Nov 1793, <span class="italic">Autobiography &hellip; of Grafton</span>, 402); while Charles James Fox, another friend of long standing, with whom he discussed literature as well as politics, once declared that he could act with Grafton &#145;with more pleasure in any possible situation than with any one I have been acquainted with&#146;  (Fox to Grafton, 4 Dec 1775, <span class="italic">Autobiography &hellip; of Grafton</span>, 276).<br>
