<span class="headword">MacDonald,  Angus, of Dunyvaig and the Glens</span>  (<em>c.</em>1548&#150;1613), <span class="occ">chief of clan Iain Mh&ograve;r or clan Donald south</span>, was born probably in Dunyvaig Castle, in Islay, the family seat. He was the second of six legitimate sons of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/69919/', "James MacDonald")</script>, sixth chief (<i>c</i>.1515&#150;1565), and his wife, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/69172/', "Lady Agnes Campbell (d. in or after 1590)")</script>, daughter of the third earl of Argyll, who was allegedly abducted into this, her second marriage, in 1545. After her husband's death Lady Agnes was married for a third time, in 1569, to Turlough Luineach O'Neill of T&iacute;r Eoghain, or Tyrone, a political union which greatly facilitated the lucrative hire of her son's mercenaries by the native Irish. Angus succeeded to the chiefship, as eighth chief, after the death of his elder brother, Archibald MacDonald, in 1568. He is likely to have received a traditional Gaelic education, befitting the son of a chief, from members of hereditary learned families who taught literacy in common classical Gaelic, bardic verse, seanchus or history, harping and bagpiping, and the exercise of military prowess, such as sword fighting and use of the cudgel. He was born into the Catholic faith, though it was illegal to practise it in Scotland throughout his chiefship. With his wife, Fynvola MacLean of Duart, he had at least two legitimate sons, James and Angus Og MacDonald, and a daughter, Margaret; he also had two natural sons, Gillespie or Archibald MacDonald of Gigha and Ranald Og MacAllester. In 1597, according to the state papers for Ireland, he also accepted the eldest son of Hugh O'Neill, second earl of Tyrone, under the Gaelic system of fosterage. <br>
<br>The clan Donald south, a fragment of the old lordship of the Isles, was one of the most powerful on the western seaboard of Scotland in the late sixteenth century, with extensive lands in Kintyre, Islay, and Jura, and the Glens of Antrim. Angus MacDonald was not an impressive figure. Sir Arthur Chichester said of him in 1602 that he was &#145;a perpetual drunkard &hellip; [and] his men of base and treacherous disposition, inclined to dissolute and licentious living&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP Ire.</span>, <i>1601&#150;3</i>, 335). But he had the additional misfortune to be chief when a lethal combination of external forces and internal dissension had begun to prey upon the stability of the clan. The main external threat came from his mother's family, the house of Argyll. The Campbells, who had long coveted the clan's territory in Kintyre, were often employed by the lowland government in the 1580s and 1590s, as it became increasingly determined to bring the clans under control. In addition, the English government was constantly trying to limit the involvement of Angus's mercenaries in Ireland, and in this it increasingly had the support of James VI, looking ahead to the day when, as king of England and Ireland, he inherited all the problems associated with Anglo-Irish condominium. There was also almost continuous conflict between the clan and Angus's wife's family, the MacLeans of Duart, over the title to the Rhinns of Islay, a dispute which eventually gave the government an additional excuse for intervention. <br>
<br>The MacDonald&#150;MacLean feud, begun under James MacDonald, continued under his son, and reached a peak of violence in May 1586, when the massacre of MacLean prisoners by Angus's men led to the enactment of the statute known as &#145;murder under trust&#146;. Eventually, in 1590, Angus was summoned with Lachlan MacLean and Donald Gorm MacDonald of Sleat under a safe conduct to Edinburgh, to discuss the governance of their territories. They were imprisoned instead, to be released a year later on surety of 10,000 merks each, and equal amounts in annual rent. Angus's heir, <a href="#cosubject_70143">James [<i>see below</i>]</a>, was imprisoned in Edinburgh Castle as surety for his father, and remained there almost continually over the next five years, with only brief periods of liberation to try and persuade his father to agree to terms. Angus was also compelled to find surety for his clansmen's good behaviour in Ireland. By 1594, however, both he and Lachlan MacLean had been placed under sentence of forfeiture for refusal to submit to the king. MacLean submitted in June 1596 and agreed to augment his rents, but Angus held out. In the same month, according to intelligence from Knockfergus, Angus sought the help of O'Neill, earl of Tyrone, whereupon the exasperated king gave MacLean a lease of the Rhinns of Islay, and commissioned Sir William Stewart of Houston to lead an expedition against the clan Donald south, with orders to take its main castles. Angus still refused to submit, but his affairs were made still more complicated by a dispute with his kinsmen in northern Ireland. The two branches of clan Donald south had co-operated under the leadership of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17465/', "Sorley Boy (Somhairle Buidhe) MacDonnell")</script>, but after the latter's death in 1590 his son James MacSorley quarrelled with Angus, principally over the Glens of Antrim, held by Angus of the English crown and administered by his son Angus Og. In 1596 James took forcible possession of the glens, and in the following year submitted a claim to Kintyre and Islay as well, declaring that Angus was illegitimate; the allegation was a useful weapon against Angus for James VI. With Argyll controlling the movement of fighting men between Scotland and Ireland, Angus could hope for no support from O'Neill. <br>
<br>Beset on every side, and with no effective allies, in November 1596 Angus MacDonald submitted to King James. The settlement imposed by the king was potentially ruinous, since it required Angus to withdraw from Kintyre and Gigha. His agent in these negotiations was his son <a name="cosubject_70143"></a><span class="headword">Sir James MacDonald of Knockrinsay</span>  (<em>c.</em>1570&#150;1626)<span class="occ"></span>, and Angus's inability to control the divisions within his own clan was most poignantly manifested in the utter breakdown of relations which followed between himself and his heir. James MacDonald was now in his mid-twenties. Knighted between 1594 and 1596, he married Margaret, sister of Campbell of Cawdor, about 1597, but had no children. He spent several years in custody as a result of the government's hostage diplomacy, thereby losing all faith in his father. The terms he obtained in 1596 would have required him yet again to stay at court. Sir James understood, where his father did not, that prolonged passive resistance could no longer force an issue with the government. He felt that the clan should make a tactical withdrawal from Kintyre so that it could at least retain Islay. Angus disagreed. Having abandoned hope of persuading his father to submit to the crown, and bitter at the years of imprisonment in his stead, Sir James set fire to his father's house of Askomull, in Campbeltown in Kintyre, in February 1598, in the full knowledge that his parents were inside. But though he was badly burnt, Angus survived to be imprisoned by Sir James, who now assumed leadership of the clan. <br>
<br>The MacLeans took the opportunity of this internecine strife to drive the MacDonalds out of Islay, and make good their lease from the crown. Battle ensued on 5 August 1598 at Loch Gruinart, where MacLean was killed. Sir James went to Edinburgh, offering to carry out the promises which his father had made in 1597 to evacuate Kintyre, to surrender Dunyvaig Castle, and to pay crown rents, and offered to pay his father a pension of 1000 merks per annum, for which he wished to be confirmed in the title to Islay. But thanks to the intervention of John Campbell of Cawdor and the seventh earl of Argyll, Sir James was not granted the feu. When Angus escaped from imprisonment in 1600, father and son vied for the leadership. Angus succeeded in capturing his son in 1603, and handed him over to Argyll, who nevertheless worked against Angus in the privy council to gain a feu of the crown lands in Kintyre and Jura, which had been forfeited by him. <br>
<br>By 1605 Angus had effectively lost control of Kintyre and Jura, which were formally granted to Argyll in 1607. He held on to Colonsay and Islay, however, and like other chiefs consequently remained subject to pressure from the crown. A show of force in 1608, during which Dunyvaig Castle was occupied, was followed in 1609 by a commission led by Bishop Andrew Knox, which held a justiciary court to which the island chiefs were summoned, including Angus. The statutes of Iona which Knox then promulgated continued the process of reducing chiefly power; Angus MacDonald, brought to submission by the previous year's expedition, also agreed to pay &pound;3000 arrears of rent. By this time he was probably worn down by his efforts to preserve his heritage. The last significant transaction of his life was effectively an acknowledgement of failure. By a deed of 1 January 1612 he surrendered his patrimony in Islay to Sir John Campbell of Cawdor, in exchange for other lands and a payment of 6000 merks, thereby continuing the absorption of MacDonald territory by the Campbells. By the time Angus died, probably in Rothesay, between January and 17 March 1613, the clan Donald south had effectively disappeared as a territorial clan. <br>
<br>Meanwhile Sir James MacDonald had been put on trial in May 1609 for &#145;treasonable&#146; breaking of ward and also for imprisoning and trying to kill his father. The court was presided over by Argyll himself, and inevitably Sir James was convicted, but though he was condemned to death he was not executed, but was placed in custody once more. Then, following Angus's death, his illegitimate son Ranald Og seized Dunyvaig Castle in spring 1614, triggering off a rising in Islay. Although Sir James made an offer from prison to recapture the castle, and to pay 8000 merks for the crown lands of Islay, a feu charter was instead issued to Cawdor. In May 1615 Sir James escaped from Edinburgh Castle, and with the support of MacDonald of Sleat and MacDonald of Clanranald drove Cawdor's men from Islay. In a letter to the secretary of state he insisted that &#145;if his Majestie be not willing that I sall be his heignes tennent in Ila, for Goddis cause let his Majestie hauld it in his awin hand; for that is certane, I will die befoir I sie a Campbell posses it&#146;  (Pitcairn, 21). But when Argyll arrived as royal lieutenant to repress the rising, assisted by English ships, Sir James was obliged to escape to Galway, and then to Spain. Although he was pardoned in 1620, he was never permitted to return to Scotland, but lived in London until his death there in 1626.<br>
