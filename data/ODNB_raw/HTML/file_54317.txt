<span class="headword">Sempill,  John</span>, first Lord Sempill  (<em>d.</em> 1513), <span class="occ">landowner and administrator</span>, was the eldest son and heir of Sir Thomas Sempill of Elliston in Renfrewshire and Elizabeth, daughter of John, first Lord Ross. Sir Thomas died at the battle of Sauchieburn (11 June 1488), fighting for James III. John retained his father's lands, but lost the sheriffdom of Renfrew to his local rivals Robert, first Lord Lyle (with whom Thomas Sempill had been at feud in 1483), John Stewart, earl of Lennox (<i>d</i>. 1495), and Lennox's son Matthew (<i>d</i>. 1513). These three, dissatisfied with their share of the spoils after James III's death, were among the rebels of 1489&#150;90 and used their shrieval jurisdiction to attack the lands of former supporters of James III, including Sempill. Consequently, on 13 September 1489 Sempill received a lieutenancy as sheriff of Renfrew from James IV's regime so that he could act against the rebellious Lord Lyle and Matthew Stewart, master of Lennox. Sempill had reduced Lyle's castle of Duchal with the king's artillery by July 1489, but the 1489&#150;90 rebellion ended in political compromise, with Lyle restored to the government, and on 16 March 1491 James IV obliged Sempill and the Lennox Stewarts to end their feud.<br>
<br>However, Sempill continued to enjoy royal favour. He was styled knight on 20 June 1492, but was a lord of parliament by 1493, probably as a regional counterbalance to Lyle and the Lennox Stewarts on the crown's behalf. In 1492 he was among the ambassadors to England, and personally received &pound;20 from Henry VII. He was given royal conveyances of Lochwinnoch (1501), Henderstoun Wester (1502), and Eliotstoun, Southannan, Glassford, Cassiltoun, and other lands (1503&#150;5) in Renfrewshire and Ayrshire, which were confirmed by James IV in 1505&#150;6 and 1508. By 1505 he was bailie of Cunningham, and he had a royal grant of Paidyeauch in Ayrshire on 8 June 1512. On 21 April 1504 he founded a collegiate church at Lochwinnoch.<br>
<br>By 9 September 1501 Sempill was married to Margaret (<i>d</i>. before 21 April 1504), daughter of Sir Robert Colville of Ochiltree, Ayrshire. They had three sons and two daughters, including the eldest, William, who became second Lord Sempill and before 1517 married Margaret, daughter of Hugh Montgomery, first earl of Eglintoun. John Sempill had remarried by 16 February 1506; he and his second wife, Margaret, daughter of James Crichton of Ruthvendenny, had no children. He was killed at the battle of Flodden on 9 September 1513, and it seems likely that he was buried in the church he had founded at Lochwinnoch.<br>
