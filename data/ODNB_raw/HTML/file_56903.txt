<span class="headword">Brophy,  John</span>  (1899&#150;1965), <span class="occ">journalist and novelist</span>, was born on 6 December 1899 at 87 Everton Road, Liverpool, the son of John Brophy, an earthenware dealer, and his wife, Agnes, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Bodell. At the age of fourteen, he escaped from a dull adolescence in that city, and joined the army upon the outbreak of the First World War. It was while on infantry service in France and Belgium that he accumulated the information that was to be the basis of much of his writing.<br>
<br>Brophy did not write about the First World War right away. When he was demobbed he returned to Liverpool, took a degree at Liverpool University, and then spent a year at Durham University. On 6 June 1924 he married Charis Weare Grundy (1895/6&#150;1975), the daughter of James Grundy, a clergyman from Chicago. Brophy then took a teaching job in Egypt, but the couple returned to England after two years, Charis Brophy being ill. Brophy found a position writing advertising for a large store in Liverpool and then moved to London to be head copywriter for a leading British advertising firm. He began to take an interest in literature and became the chief reviewer of fiction for the <span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span>. He wrote also for <span class="italic">Time and Tide</span> and for the BBC.<br>
<br>It was Brophy's first novel, however, which truly launched his literary career. <span class="italic">The Bitter End</span> (1928) was a war novel which featured an attractive semi-autobiographical hero, Donald Foster, who gave voice to the sense of loss and disappointment in England a decade after &#145;the war to end war&#146;. The novel marked Brophy as an author to watch, particularly in its development of the mixture of nostalgia and anger that was to give a popular appeal to his disillusioned descriptions of the horrors of war.<br>
<br>The Brophys' daughter, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/59784/', "Brigid Antonia Brophy (1929&#150;1995)")</script>, also a writer, was born in the following year, and Brophy was determined to support his new family as a professional writer. In 1929 he published his second and third novels, <span class="italic">Pluck the Flower</span> and <span class="italic">Paul Lavelle</span>, as well as an anthology, <span class="italic">The Soldier's War</span>. In 1930 he edited, with Eric Partridge, <span class="italic">Songs and Slang of the British Soldier, 1914&#150;1918</span> (later revised as <span class="italic">The Long Trail</span>, 1965). Through the 1930s he published at least one novel a year, never equalling his first, and he also wrote <span class="italic">English Prose</span> (in the <span class="roman">How and Why</span> series, 1932), contributed to <span class="italic">The Writer's Desk Book</span> (1934), and wrote <span class="italic">Ilonka Speaks of Hungary: Personal Impressions and an Interpretation of the National Character</span> (1936) and <span class="italic">The Five Years</span> (1936), a rather personal history of the First World War. It was not until 1939 that he had a real success, not with his collection of stories <span class="italic">The Queer Fellow</span> nor with his novel <span class="italic">The Ridiculous Hat</span>&#151;both published in that year&#151;but with his fictional life of Shakespeare, <span class="italic">Gentleman of Stratford</span> (1939).<br>
<br>The Second World War found Brophy editing <span class="italic">John O'London's Weekly</span> and serving in the Home Guard, for which he wrote handbooks and manuals and, eventually, &#145;a character study&#146;, <span class="italic">Britain's Home Guard</span> (1945). Brophy came more alive during the war and produced an &#145;entertainment&#146; called <span class="italic">Solitude Island</span> (1941) and several action novels well received on both sides of the Atlantic, including <span class="italic">Immortal Sergeant</span> (1942); <span class="italic">Spear Head</span> (published in the United States as <span class="italic">Spearhead</span>, 1943), about commando raids on France and Norway; and <span class="italic">Target Island</span> (1944), about the brave resistance of Malta. Of these, and in fact of all his work, <span class="italic">Immortal Sergeant</span> is the best. In 1943 a film was made based on the novel, starring Henry Fonda as Corporal Spence, who rises to the occasion in the Libyan desert war when his sergeant is killed. The film served to enhance Brophy's reputation, which, however, declined after the war.<br>
<br>Brophy's post-war work was more copious than compelling. He collected <span class="italic">Selected Stories</span> (1946), edited some letters of Sarah Curran (1955), and wrote an introduction to those of Holbrooke Jackson (1960). He also wrote a number of books on art which reflect the keen visual sense shown in his novels: <span class="italic">The Human Face Reconsidered</span> (1962), recalling his <span class="italic">The Human Face</span> (1942); <span class="italic">The Face in Western Art</span> (1963); and <span class="italic">The Face of the Nude</span> (1965). In addition to a 1964 profile of W. Somerset Maugham written for the British Council, he continued to publish novels such as <span class="italic">City of Departures</span> (1946), <span class="italic">A Woman from Nowhere</span> (1946), <span class="italic">Sarah</span> (1948), <span class="italic">Julian's Way</span> (1949), <span class="italic">Turn the Key Softly</span> (1951), <span class="italic">The Prime of Life</span> (1954), and <span class="italic">The Day they Robbed the Bank of England</span> (1959). This last made a successful caper film in 1960, with Peter O'Toole and Aldo Ray. The cinema not only provided Brophy with more money for his passion for old master drawings but made the neat if sometimes sentimental character sketching and swift plotting in his novels known to larger international audiences than those who read his books. John Brophy died at the Royal Waterloo Hospital, Lambeth, London, of heart failure on 12 November 1965; his wife survived him. Brophy's novels were enjoyable, often insightful, well-constructed entertainments, popular in their day. They were translated into sixteen languages and based, in large part, on the personal experience of a sensitive and articulate Englishman of a war-torn century.<br>
