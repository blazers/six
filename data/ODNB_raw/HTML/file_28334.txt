<span class="headword">Vitelli,  Cornelio</span>  (<em>d.</em> in or before 1554), <span class="occ">humanist scholar</span>, was among the first Italians to show in person to Oxford the levels reached in rhetoric and philology by the Italian Renaissance. By his own account a native of Cortona, Vitelli may have studied in Bologna and in Rome under Francesco Filelfo, Domizio Calderini, and perhaps Nicol&ograve; Perotti. Vitelli's first work may be his letter, or <span class="italic">Commentariolus</span> (probably of 1473), to Perotti on the elder Pliny. It was printed with Perotti's commentary in Venice about 1482 as well as in the Aldine (1499) and some early sixteenth-century editions of Perotti's <span class="italic">Cornucopiae</span>. In late August 1474 Federigo da Montefeltro was created a papal duke; probably hoping for patronage, Vitelli eulogized the creation in a Latin epigram. In 1478 he was certainly tutoring the son of Paolo Leoni of Padua. Within three years he was acting as tutor to the sons of Venetian patricians, and in 1481 gave a course of lectures, perhaps at the studium of Padua, perhaps in Venice. Vitelli attacked the scholarship of Giorgio Merula, professor of eloquence in Venice. His <span class="italic">Defensio Plinii et Calderini</span>, first printed at Venice in 1481&#150;2 along with his tractate on Roman time measurement, was dedicated to Ermolao Barbaro the elder; his third essay in Plinian controversy, <span class="italic">Enarratiuncula in C. Plinium</span>, which seems to belong to this phase of his career, was first printed with Marino Becichemo's Pliny commentaries (Paris, 1519).<br>
<br>Vitelli's polemic against Merula led to his securing the latter's post, which was probably its intention. From May 1483 he served the Venetian republic as state rhetorician, being replaced in that position by Giorgio Valla towards the end of 1484. From about January 1485 he was praelector of New College, Oxford, a position he occupied for two years, during which he taught Latin and Greek in Oxford; William Grocyn and Thomas Linacre may have been his pupils. It was most likely in 1486 that he made the Latin oration to which Thomas Chaundler is reported by Leland as having responded.<br>
<br>From 1 February 1487 to the end of January 1488 Vitelli held the chair of poetics at Louvain. In the summer of 1488 he was in Paris, where he met two fellow Italian humanists, Giovanni Balbi and Publio Fausto Andrelini, and was authorized with them on 5 September 1489 to lecture publicly on the poets. Becoming involved in verse controversy in Balbi's interest against Andrelini, Vitelli lost Balbi's favour also. He left Paris at the end of 1489 or the beginning of 1490, and appears to have gone first to London, where he failed to win royal patronage by joining Giovanni Gigli, Bernard Andr&eacute;, and Pietro Carmeliano in deriding the French humanist and ambassador Robert Gaguin, who had been successively his friend and rival in Paris. From autumn 1490 to summer 1492 Vitelli rented a room in Exeter College, as Grocyn did from 1491 to 1493. Competition for pupils from Grocyn may have been the reason for Vitelli's leaving Oxford, which he seems to have done in late summer 1492. In 1490 he ate Christmas lunch with the vice-president of Magdalen College, and he may have dined in New College in 1492.<br>
<br>Thereafter little can be said of Vitelli. He may have been the <i>cortonese</i> to whom Constantino d'Andrea hoped to give pleasure by his Italian <span class="italic">Disticha Catonis</span>, published in Venice <i>c</i>.1493&#150;4, and it is also possible that he tried to support himself by teaching in Florence. By 9 February 1508, however, he had become rector of Sant'Antimo in the diocese of Arezzo; he still held the benefice in 1525, and may have done so until 1554.<br>
<br>The only work Vitelli wrote in England that is extant is his poem against Gaguin. A Greek epigram by Poliziano (<i>d</i>. 1494) may be directed against him. No English or Scottish contemporary author mentions him, though he had a later reputation here for verbal fluency and as a teacher: Andr&eacute;, about 1500, calls him the most eloquent of orators, and Polydore Vergil, after 1514, says that he was nobly born and Oxford's first instructor in good letters. In 1528 Erasmus refers dismissively to him among the ruck of Ciceronians.<br>
