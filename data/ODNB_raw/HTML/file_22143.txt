</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Phillipps, Sir  Thomas</span>, baronet  (1792&#150;1872), <span class="occ">collector of books and manuscripts</span>, was born on 2 July 1792 at 32 Cannon Street, Manchester. He was illegitimate, the only child of Thomas Phillipps (1742&#150;1818), the prosperous senior partner of Phillipps, Lowe &amp; Co., calico manufacturers and printers of Manchester, and Hannah Walton, daughter of James Walton, of Warley, and his wife, Mary Greenroyd. His grandfather William Phillipps farmed at Broadway, Worcestershire. On retiring from business his father moved to Broadway, and in 1794 he bought Middle Hill, a handsome five-bayed house, recently enlarged, below Broadway Tower, with a fine view over the Vale of Evesham. Father and son moved there two years later. His mother had no part in his upbringing, although she lived on until 1851, and married Frederick Judd in 1812. Thomas Phillipps senior did not take easily to country life, although he much extended his estate and became high sheriff of Worcestershire in 1802. His chief occupations were meddling in the firm, from which he had nominally retired, and litigation with his neighbours, from whom he was also isolated by deafness. Both characteristics were inherited by his son, whom he wished to become a gentleman. But Lord Chesterfield's maxims, much cited by the father, were no substitute for a mother's care; a lonely youth spent with an ageing and irascible father induced in the younger Phillipps a lifelong indifference to the feelings of others.<h2>
<a name="EducationandearlycollectingtheMeermansale"></a>Education and early collecting; the Meerman sale</h2>Phillipps was educated locally before going to Rugby School in 1807. There his future tastes began to show. Long afterwards, in 1864, he printed the catalogue that he made at the age of sixteen of what was then a library of 110 volumes. Most of these, surprisingly, were Gothic novels, but at Oxford his antiquarian tastes developed rapidly. He went up to University College late (in October 1811), and spent four years there, acquiring more books than learning. He needed a private tutor to prepare him for examinations, and took his BA degree in 1815. His father had good cause to complain of his extravagance, especially on books. But he made some like-minded friends, who encouraged his interests. This gave him the confidence to write to the veteran antiquary Sir Richard Colt Hoare offering to help with his history of Wiltshire. Hoare welcomed this and set him to work copying documents at Salisbury; Phillipps&#151;unusually for him&#151;remained on consistently friendly terms with Hoare until the latter's death in 1838. By this time he had fallen in love with Henrietta Elizabeth (<i>b</i>. 1794/5), third daughter of Major-General Thomas Molyneux. She had good looks and a respectable family, but no dowry, which to Phillipps's father was a serious obstacle. This impediment was removed when the old man died on 1 November 1818, and the marriage took place early in the following year, on 7 February 1819. His father, apprehensive of his son's continuing extravagance, left the estate in trust, giving his heir access to only the income.<br>
<br>The next ten years were perhaps the happiest of Phillipps's life. His three daughters were born&#151;Henrietta (1819), Sophia (1821), and Katharine (1829)&#151;and he was now able to indulge his interests without paternal censure. He was elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1820, and thanks to his father-in-law's interest with the duke of Beaufort was made a baronet in the coronation honours in the following year. He set about buying books and manuscripts with gusto, copying and commissioning transcripts of historic documents, and from 1822 having them printed, usually coarsely and in small quantities, by a succession of his own printers on a private press at Broadway Tower. Even so, an income of over &pound;6000 p.a. should have sufficed, but his complete inability to restrain his expenditure and refusal to accept the advice of his agents soon landed him in debt, from which he was never again free. In 1822&#150;3 he was obliged to economize by living on the continent. He returned there in 1824, and again in 1827&#150;9. This was a period when, following the French Revolution, the Napoleonic wars, and the secularization of the German monastic houses in 1803, old books and manuscripts were more widely available than at any time before or since. Phillipps made his acquisitions from many places as he travelled from Brussels to Bern, with major purchases at The Hague and Lille, in Germany, and from the booksellers of Paris. At this time he made, and largely retained, friendships with continental scholars, who repaid his hospitality by showing greater tolerance of his eccentricities than did his British contemporaries.<br>
<br>Phillipps's largest acquisition in this period was the purchase at auction of over 650 manuscripts from the collection of the Dutch typographic historian Gerard Meerman (1722&#150;1771) at The Hague in 1824. This featured texts from the seventh and eighth centuries, some renowned illuminated manuscripts, and a tenth-century Greek manuscript in gold capital script. Phillipps was just as eager in the pursuit of rarities when he returned to Britain. At the sale in 1827 of the Revd Theodore Williams, another victim of his own extravagance, he bought two famous manuscripts, the gospels of Matilda of Tuscany and the Gundulf <span class="roman">Bible</span>, for the high prices of &pound;172 and &pound;189. He had many dealings with the two major booksellers of the time, Payne and Foss, and Thomas Thorpe. The former represented him at the sale of Richard Heber's library in 1835&#150;6, at which (for over &pound;2500) he bought 428 manuscripts; the latter sold him countless historic documents. Thomas Payne and his partner, Henry Foss, were not reliant on the baronet's custom, and dealt with his unreasonable demands with firmness and good sense. Thorpe, who was less independent and less scrupulous, was too ready to give Phillipps long credit, which was subsequently abused, forcing Thorpe into bankruptcy in 1837. Over all this Sir Frederic Madden, keeper of manuscripts in the British Museum, kept a close watch, fairly tolerant if increasingly exasperated by Phillipps's activities, and his detailed and sharply observant diary provides a vivid picture of Phillipps as a collector and in his domestic life.<h2>
<a name="RelationswithJOHalliwellanexpandingcollection"></a>Relations with J. O. Halliwell; an expanding collection</h2>In March 1832 Phillipps's wife died aged thirty-seven, and after a blatantly mercenary search he married again on 2 June 1842. His second wife was Elizabeth Harriet Anne (<i>b</i>. 1815), daughter of the Revd William Mansel. As the companion of his later years, she showed (and needed) great forbearance in the face of his increasing eccentricity. In the interval a family event with far-reaching consequences took place. James Orchard Halliwell had as a Cambridge undergraduate in 1839 written to Sir Thomas for historical information. He was still only eighteen, and Phillipps was impressed by the young man, who examined Cambridge libraries for him. In recompense Phillipps printed the catalogue of the scientific manuscripts that Halliwell had already assembled, and then invited him to stay. Halliwell visited Middle Hill in February 1842, and promptly fell in love with Phillipps's eldest daughter. Phillipps was initially sympathetic, but soon fell out with Halliwell over a dowry. But Henrietta was of age, and the couple eloped in August, soon after her father's second marriage. Phillipps's rage was unbridled and lasting, especially after evidence emerged in 1845 that Halliwell had stolen manuscripts from Trinity College, Cambridge. Thereafter Phillipps did his best to thwart and denigrate his son-in-law, and to make his daughter's life a misery. She tried her utmost to effect a reconciliation, and remained on good terms with her sisters, who both married clergymen.<br>
<br>Meanwhile the collections at Middle Hill expanded rapidly. Ever since the Palace of Westminster had burnt down in 1834, when he himself had tried to rescue records from the flames, Phillipps had been preoccupied with the danger of fire. As a precaution he kept his own books in coffin-like boxes with handles and drop-down lids, piled on each other, so that if in danger they could be speedily removed. They surprised visitors, who nevertheless admitted the utility of this arrangement. Phillipps was his own librarian, and occasionally pressed his daughters into service while they still lived at home. The task demanded a professional staff and was too much for him: visiting scholars, always received with hospitality, were sometimes disappointed when what they came for could not be found. Continental scholars such as his old friend G. H. Pertz, editor of the <span class="italic">Monumenta Germaniae Historica</span>, and American historians such as W. H. Prescott and Jared Sparks, enjoyed productive visits, which they wrote about with gratitude. Phillipps was a discriminating and generous patron to two contemporary artists, the landscape painter John Glover and the American George Catlin. He had a particular sympathy with Catlin's crusade not merely to depict but to preserve the way of life of the indigenous peoples of North America.<br>
<br>All this was of lesser importance when compared with Phillipps's principal task of amassing documents of the past. Phillipps referred to himself as a complete &#145;Vello-maniac&#146;. He ranged widely, embracing illuminated manuscripts oriental as well as Western, medieval charters, antiquaries' collections, and all manner of historical documents and early printed books. He bought extensively at the sales of David Powell, the genealogist, George Baker, the historian of Northamptonshire, and Viscount Kingsborough, author of <span class="italic">The Antiquities of Mexico</span>, in 1842, and of Augustus, duke of Sussex, in 1844. At the Wilks sale in 1847 he bought the Caxton <span class="italic">Recuyell of the Historyes of Troy</span> and the first folio of Shakespeare, but failed to secure the Gutenberg <span class="roman">Bible</span>, the price of which he ran up to &pound;500, more than double the previous record for this book. He tried to buy the duke of Buckingham's Stowe manuscripts but lost out to Lord Ashburnham; and he competed strongly between 1849 and 1862 for Guglielmo Libri's fabulous&#151;if dubiously acquired&#151;collections. At the Ker Porter, Routh, Dering, and Mitford sales he consistently bought the major lots. This level of acquisition continued until he was well into his seventies; he frequently argued with his suppliers, and even complained about the condition of some books rescued from the fire that burnt down Sothebys rooms off the Strand in 1865.<h2>
<a name="Thefateofthecollectionoldageanddeath"></a>The fate of the collection; old age and death</h2>By this time the ultimate destination of his collection was in the forefront of Phillipps's mind. For ten years up to 1861 he was intermittently in negotiation with the University of Oxford, reviving earlier discussions about terms of possible acquisition by the Bodleian Library. He then proposed that he should become Bodley's librarian, with the newly appointed Henry Octavius Coxe as his deputy. Coxe, who fortunately had a sense of humour, was unable to take this seriously. Phillipps thereupon broke off negotiations. The British Museum, too, was often in his thoughts, as in his requests to Madden that the institution should stand down in his favour at sales or, alternatively, when he was more than usually hard pressed, that it should purchase his whole collection at an appropriately inflated price. In 1861 Anthony Panizzi, the principal librarian, wrote to Phillipps, ultimately to invite him to become a trustee of the museum. Phillipps accepted (in 1861), and although he rarely attended meetings, was full of ideas for improvements. Some had merit. He recommended the introduction of guide lecturers, the use of an electric telegraph to communicate between the bookstacks and the reading-room, and binding the books for use there in cloth instead of leather. But he was affronted when other suggestions were rejected, and when it came to providing for his own collection, he proved impossible to satisfy. He turned next to Wales and in particular to Manorbier, the home of the Phillipps family of Picton Castle, with whom Sir Thomas claimed some remote consanguinity; by 1869 this scheme had likewise foundered.<br>
<br>Phillipps was determined, in his obsessive hatred of Halliwell, that his son-in-law should not lay hands on the collection, even though Middle Hill itself was entailed on his wife. It was this, as well as an ever more urgent space requirement, that in 1863 led Phillipps to take the lease of Thirlestaine House in Cheltenham, a large and uncomfortable mansion with additional art galleries left empty at the death of the second Lord Northwick, and to buy it in 1867. It took two years for a wagon train to transport the library across the Cotswolds to its new home. Phillipps himself arranged the books, and once wrote:<blockquote>I do everything myself, I manage all my Estates&#151;I have seven Works in the Press to collate &amp; correct. People come continually to see my Gallery of Pictures &amp; I am the only Cicerone. People come from the Continent to examine my MSS &amp; from all parts of England, Scotland &amp; Ireland, &amp; I am the sole Librarian to search for the Books. Others in great Numbers will write for information &amp; I am the sole amanuensis. The Booksellers send me countless Catalogues which I look over &amp; select &amp; order &amp; when the Books arrive I am the sole unpacker and arranger on the Shelves. (Munby, 4.134)</blockquote>This self-portrait is accurate and his powers, despite his advanced age, were undiminished. Lady Phillipps, her husband's heart set so much on his books, took a less favourable view of the move: she was, she complained, &#145;booked out of one wing and ratted out of the other&#146;  (ibid., 2.91).<br>
<br>Phillipps remained at Thirlestaine House, gouty and foul-tempered, his bad qualities accentuated by age. His unreasoning anti-Catholic prejudice continued as vigorously as ever, but a campaign for the preservation of public records by anastatic printing was based on views that were well grounded and far-sighted. In Cheltenham he entertained the young W. W. Skeat, at work on his edition of <span class="italic">Piers Plowman</span>, and the great German historian Leopold von Ranke. He continued to correspond with his oldest and best friends, Sir Henry Dryden and Robert Curzon, now Lord Zouche, with whom he could exchange bibliophilic gossip in a far lighter manner than he ever displayed to his family or to librarians or booksellers. A fall from a library ladder restricted his movement, but he persisted in arranging his collections until he was too weak to continue. On 1 February 1872 he signed his will, drafted and redrafted for over fifty years, and on 6 February he died at Thirlestaine House. He was buried at St Eadburga's Church, Broadway.<br>
<br>Phillipps's will was proved at about &pound;120,000, of which he left only &pound;100 to his widow. Most of his unentailed lands were settled on tenants called Phillipps and chosen for that reason, with a remainder to his grandson Owen Walcot. Thirlestaine House and its contents were left in trust for his youngest daughter, Katharine, with a life interest for her third son, Thomas Fitzroy Fenwick. Not a book was to be moved; the Halliwells and all Roman Catholics were banned from entering. It took many years to circumvent such provisions, though the Halliwells (who promptly took the name Halliwell-Phillipps) were soon allowed to break the entail on Middle Hill and to profit from what was still a handsome estate. But not until 1885 were the Fenwicks, left with the enormous and expensive Thirlestaine House but little income to support it, enabled by judicial approval to begin the gradual dispersal of the contents.<br>
<br>Shrewdly negotiated sales of groups of manuscripts to foreign governments (such as the Meerman collection to Germany) and to major private collectors followed, and there was a long series of auctions at Sothebys. Some twenty-two sales had taken place before the still vast residue was bought, speculatively on the basis of its catalogues, by the London antiquarian booksellers Lionel and Philip Robinson, in 1946. They continued a profitable dispersal, through their own retail catalogues and eventually by a further series of auctions at Sothebys. The remainder was acquired by the New York dealers H. P. Kraus in 1977.<br>
<br>The impression of Phillipps&#151;vain, obstinate, and intolerant&#151;which suffuses his extensive correspondence, is not entirely fair. Like his old friend Madden, he is seen at his worst on paper. His unfortunate family received his outbursts with some degree of indulgence. He often contested his bills, and usually paid them late, but this was less unacceptable at a time when money held its value, and in commerce the debts of a good customer could be more useful than his money. His true memorial lies in his collection; dispersed though it is, its formation was a great achievement. He was well aware that much of what he gathered was at risk of destruction. He bid high in the rooms and forced the market upwards against himself, but he recognized that higher prices would encourage preservation. In 1869 he wrote jokingly to Robert Curzon, &#145;I am buying Printed Books because I wish to have <i>one copy of every Book in the World!!!!!</i>&#146;  (Munby, 1.38). That was clearly impossible, but his collection of over 60,000 manuscripts was an outstanding achievement in the annals of bibliophily.<br>
