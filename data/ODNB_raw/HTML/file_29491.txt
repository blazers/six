<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Williams,  Daniel</span>  (<em>c.</em>1643&#150;1716), <span class="occ">Presbyterian minister and benefactor</span>, was born at Wrexham, Denbighshire, but the identity of his father is unknown. His mother was probably a daughter of Hugh Davies of Wrexham, grandfather of Stephen Davies (<i>d</i>. 1739), minister at Banbury, whom Williams in his will called &#145;cousin&#146;, and made a residuary legatee.<h2>
<a name="Educationandcareerto1688"></a>Education and career to 1688</h2>Where Williams was educated is obscure, although he himself wrote that &#145;from five years old [I] have had no Employment besides my Studies&#146;, and that &#145;before nineteen I was regularly admitted a preacher&#146;  (Williams, <span class="italic">Defence of &#145;Gospel Truth&#146;</span>, preface). It is likely that his education for the ministry was curtailed by the Restoration and his decision not to conform. Evans records that Williams had &#145;some Disadvantages in his Education at first setting out&#146;  (Evans, 34). He then &#145;preach'd for a few Years occasionally in several Parts of England&#146;, but finding &#145;the Times here so frowning on a Protestant Dissenter&#146;  (ibid., 35), about 1664, while on a visit to Lady Wilbraham of Weston, near Shifnal, Shropshire, he accepted an invitation to be chaplain to the countess of Meath in Ireland. While in her service he preached regularly to a joint Presbyterian&#150;Independent congregation at Drogheda until he was called by the congregation at Wood Street, Dublin, in 1667 as colleague to Samuel Marsden, a moderate Independent.<br>
<br>In 1675, by a licence of 16 October, Williams married Elizabeth (1635/6&#150;1698), widow of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/67255/', "Thomas Juxon")</script> of East Sheen, Surrey, daughter of Sir Robert Meredith of Green Hills, Kildare, and sister to Alice, countess of Mountrath. She had been &#145;Brought home to God in Her Younger Years by Means of a Sermon&#146; by Edward Baynes, minister of the Winetavern meeting, Dublin, from 1668  (Calamy, <span class="italic">Funeral Sermon</span>, 73). They had no children. One extraordinary event of Williams's ministry, in 1678, the exorcism by prayer of a violent knocking which had terrorized a young woman, was recorded by Richard Baxter, to whom Williams communicated the account, in <span class="italic">The Certainty of the Worlds of Spirits</span> (1691). Williams had an important role in contributing &#145;much to the restauration of Peace&#146; among the Scottish Presbyterians in Dublin &#145;and somewhat to the Union there&#146; among the dissenting congregations  (Williams, <span class="italic">Defence of &#145;Gospel Truth&#146;</span>, preface). Between 1682 and 1687 he was assisted by Gilbert Rule, in exile from persecution in Scotland, from whom he acquired his admiration for the presbyterian system and Scottish universities. The following year Joseph Boyse joined them and for some years the Wood Street congregation was served by three ministers.<br>
<br>On the outbreak of the troubles of 1687 Rule returned to Scotland and Williams, who had been a fierce opponent of Catholicism, believing his life to be in danger, withdrew to London in September, where he arrived at a critical juncture. He quickly gained an influential place amongst dissenters. He became friendly with two of the leading ministers, John Howe (who had served as chaplain to Viscount Massareene in Ireland between 1670 and 1676) and Richard Baxter. Shortly after his arrival Williams was invited twice (20 November 1687 and 9 January 1688) to preach before the lord mayor, Sir John Shorter, an Independent. Both sermons were published. He was present at a meeting at John Howe's house on 23 May 1688 when efforts were made to solicit an address of thanks from the dissenters for James II's declaration of indulgence. According to tradition Williams urged his fellow ministers to refuse, for &#145;it were better for them to be reduc'd to their former Hardships, than declare for Measures destructive of the Liberties of their Country&#146;  (Evans, 43), thus avoiding the threat of an open breach with the Church of England.<br>
<br>Efforts were made by the Wood Street congregation to persuade Williams to return to Dublin, but on 1 May 1688 Boyse wrote to Thomas Emlyn that &#145;Mr Williams, whose return was expected, has, after long keeping us in suspence, determined to fix in London&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 1.x). By September 1690 Boyse had concluded that, though &#145;some are not willing to despair&#146;, Williams &#145;will never return to settle here, where he can neither make the same figure nor meet with half the encouragement he does in London&#146;  (ibid., xiv&#150;xv). On 9 May 1688 Williams received a call to succeed John Collins as minister of the Congregational church in Paved Alley, Lime Street, London, which prompted a protest by twenty-six members of the church. Although Williams &#145;hath often declared that he is for particular organized Churches&#146; and promised that he would &#145;not alter the practice of this Church&#146;  (Browne to Bosworth, 27 June 1688, DWL, MS 24.67 (2)), the majority concluded that &#145;we think a Presbyterian minister an unsuitable officer to a Congregationall People&#146;  (Bosworth to Browne, 29 June 1688, ibid. (4)), though they hoped he would assist them with an occasional sermon. In December 1688 John Oakes died, and the following year Williams succeeded him as minister of Hand Alley, Bishopsgate, where he remained until his death.<h2>
<a name="Religiouscontroversies"></a>Religious controversies</h2>Initial enthusiasm following the <span class="roman">Toleration Act</span> of 1689 led to the ambitious Happy Union, involving a formal accommodation between Presbyterians and Congregationalists in the hope of submerging their doctrinal differences. Williams was one of the committee. He was also one of the original managers of the Common Fund, founded in June 1690 to support provincial dissent, and the only one who was not an ejected minister. Within months the union had ruptured, aggravated by the aggressive independency of Richard Davis, minister of the Independent church at Rothwell, Northamptonshire. Attempts by the Presbyterian members of the United Ministers in London, led by Williams, to discipline Davis were opposed by the Congregational ministers, who in protest withdrew from the union. Doctrinal differences had also been inflamed by the re-publication of Tobias Crisp's sermons, <span class="italic">Christ Alone Exalted</span>, by his son in 1690 after a lapse of over forty years, which were condemned as Antinomian by Baxter. Williams was closely associated with Baxter during the last years of his life and supplied for him at the Tuesday merchants' lecture, at Pinner's Hall. Following Baxter's death in December 1691 Williams and Thomas Woodcock were rival candidates for the lectureship. The votes were equal and Williams was elected by lot. Jeremiah White later declared that, though he had supported Woodcock, &#145;yet he thought providence had clearly determined the matter, and that Mr Williams was a man of the best natural parts of any man in England&#146;  (&#145;Some account&#146;, xii&#150;xiii). Williams also continued Baxter's opposition to high Calvinism.<br>
<br>Williams took up the Crisp controversy and in May 1692 published his <span class="italic">Gospel Truth Stated</span> &#145;reducing the Controversy into the Compass of a few Heads, and distinctly stating Truth and Error under each of them&#146;  (Calamy, <span class="italic">Continuation</span>, 973). It was, in Calamy's opinion, &#145;Much carp'd at, but never distinctly answer'd&#146;  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Eng. hist. d. 90, fol. 11<i>r</i>). But with its testimonial signed by sixteen Presbyterian ministers the book was quickly identified by the Congregationalists as a declaration against their party. Its publication was the signal for &#145;Great Heats about Doctrinal Matters among the Dissenters&#146;  (ibid., fol. 13<i>r</i>). Isaac Chauncy attacked Williams's opinions in <span class="italic">Neonomianism Unmaskt</span> (1692, 1693), to which Williams replied with <span class="italic">A Defence of &#145;Gospel Truth&#146;</span> (1693). At the beginning of 1694 Nathaniel Mather, a former colleague in Dublin and the successful candidate at Lime Street in 1688, preached two sermons on justification at the Pinner's Hall lecture attacking Williams's arguments as &#145;semi-Socinian&#146;. They were later published as the <span class="italic">Righteousness of God through Faith</span> (1694). Williams replied at his merchants' lecture, subsequently published as <span class="italic">Man Made Righteous by Christ's Obedience</span> (1694). The breach was completed when Williams's dismissal from the lectureship was contrived by a meeting packed with small subscribers in August 1694, and the other Presbyterian ministers withdrew to establish a rival lecture at Salters' Hall which met the same day and hour.<br>
<br>Williams was then accused of immorality. At his request a committee of the United Ministers met at Little St Helen's meeting, Bishopsgate, hearing evidence for eight weeks on Williams's conduct from boyhood. On 8 April 1695 the general body of ministers found Williams &#145;intirely clear and innocent&#146;  (Williams, <span class="italic">Gospel Truth Stated</span>, 302). Grateful to Edmund Calamy for his assistance in obtaining an important witness, Williams made him his assistant at Hand Alley. With the failure of this attack Williams was charged with Socinianism and other heresies by Stephen Lobb. When Lobb used Bishop Stillingfleet as an authority against him Williams appealed to the bishop who replied firmly in Williams's favour. Dr Jonathan Edwards of Jesus College, Oxford, who had also been used against Williams, likewise took his side. Williams's last publication in the controversy was <span class="italic">An End to Discord</span> (1699), written at the request of Lobb to put a halt to the disputes between the Presbyterians and the orthodox Congregationalists. Besides his controversial works he published funeral sermons for Samuel Annesley (1697), John Woodhouse (1701), John Quick (1706), Thomas Doolittle (1707), and Matthew Henry (1714), thanksgiving sermons for the protestant deliverance from the 1641 Irish rebellion (1690) and for the union with Scotland (1707), which he strongly supported, and two more substantial works on religious faith, the <span class="italic">Vanity of Childhood and Youth</span> (1691) and a <span class="italic">Letter to the Author of a Discourse of Free-Thinking</span> (1713), which maintained the eternity of hell.<br>
<br>Williams's first wife died on 10 June 1698, aged sixty-two, through grief at the death of her sister Alice, dowager countess of Mountrath. Williams then married, on 2 January 1701, Jane (<i>d</i>. 1740), elder daughter of George Guill, a Huguenot refugee merchant, and widow of Francis Barkstead, with whom she had had a son, Francis, and daughters, Mary and Elizabeth, but there were no children with Williams. Her sister, Susanna, married Joseph Stennett, the Seventh Day Baptist minister. By both his marriages Williams acquired considerable property which he used sparingly that &#145;he might be more useful to others both in his Life and after his Death&#146;  (Calamy, <span class="italic">Continuation</span>, 970). Indeed &#145;he exercis'd a Frugality as to his own Person, possibly to an Excess&#146;  (Evans, 44).<h2>
<a name="Finalyearsandlegacy"></a>Final years and legacy</h2>Although Williams never sought prominence as a public man he was consulted by William III for his knowledge of Irish affairs. He seemed to Sir Charles Wolseley &#145;to talk like a privy counsellor&#146;  (&#145;Some account&#146;, xxvi). Williams used his influence on behalf of dissenters in Scotland and the American colonies as well as England and Ireland. He told Boyse in February 1699 that he had spoken with &#145;the K[ing']s right hand who hath undertaken the affair&#146; about a minister in Galloway  (BL, Add. MS 4276, fol. 223<i>r</i>). Besides assisting in individual cases he made strenuous though unsuccessful efforts to prevent the imposition of the Irish sacramental test in 1704. He also represented English dissent. He led the joint address in March 1702 of the &#145;Three Denominations&#146; on the accession of Anne; the first occasion that the Presbyterians, Independents, and Baptists had acted together. More important, he kept an active correspondence with Robert Harley, first earl of Oxford, from at least 1701, maintaining a careful response to his overtures, especially efforts to detach dissenters from their whig political allies. In 1710 he received an offer from the earl of Oxford of &pound;1000 to be distributed among dissenting ministers as royal bounty. Distrusting Oxford he declined the offer. Yet all his political influence could not prevent the passing of the <span class="roman">Occasional Conformity Act</span> (1711) or the <span class="roman">Schism Act</span> (1714). He became particularly apprehensive about the state of affairs at the end of Anne's reign, expressing freely to Oxford his concerns about the protestant succession. In 1709 he reluctantly accepted an honorary doctorate of divinity from Edinburgh and Glasgow universities.<br>
<br>In May 1711 Williams was dangerously ill, prompting a day of prayer at his meeting-house by the leading London ministers. On his recovery in June he drew up his will, and, his health rapidly declining, he left most of the work in the ministry to John Evans, his assistant since 1704. The particularly unflattering description of Williams by John Fox as &#145;the greatest bundle of pride, affectation, and ill manners I had ever met with&#146;  (Fox, 194), belongs to this period of ill health. His last public act was shortly after the accession of George I when, on 28 September 1714, he again led the loyal address to the throne by the &#145;Three Denominations&#146;.<br>
<br>Williams died, possibly from an asthma attack, at his house in Hoxton, London, on 26 January 1716 and was buried in a vault at Bunhill Fields, London. He devoted the bulk of his estate (estimated at &pound;50,000) to charitable uses. Besides provision for his widow, numerous legacies, bequests to the poor in various places, endowments for Presbyterian meetings at Wrexham and Burnham, Essex, for St Thomas's Hospital, for the universities of Glasgow and Harvard, and for mission societies in Scotland and New England, he established a trust for 2000 years for religious and educational purposes, though &#145;his trustees met with great difficulties in pursuing his designs&#146;  (Calamy, <span class="italic">Historical Account</span>, 2.344). Williams's sister and heir-at-law, Mrs Elizabeth Roberts, who was entitled to all property that he had not legally devised, questioned the legality of some parts of the will but at length was satisfied with an annuity of &pound;60 for designated charitable purposes in Wales. The provisions Williams made in his will for establishing the library which bears his name were modest, and the opening of the library in Red Cross Street in 1729 was largely due to the efforts of his trustees. For over a century it served as &#145;the headquarters of London dissent&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>). The collections were greatly enlarged over the years with many important gifts, and Williams's original benefaction of about 7600 books forms only a small part of the modern library. After several moves, the trustees acquired University Hall in Gordon Square, London, where the library opened in 1890.<br>
<br>Williams's extraordinary influence among dissenters after the revolution was remarkable both for the speed with which it was achieved and the height that it attained. His great wealth acquired with his first marriage and consolidated by his second was undoubtedly important, but &#145;his large Acquaintance and diffusive Influence, gave him Advantages for Usefulness beyond many of his Brethren&#146;  (Evans, 35). If his lack of formal theological training encouraged much of the suspicion concerning his orthodoxy, his ability in a controversy to &#145;immediately fasten upon the main hinge on which the thing turned&#146; together with his &#145;penetrating judgment&#146; and close application gave him success in the Crispian controversy  (&#145;Some account&#146;, xxiii&#150;xxiv).<br>
