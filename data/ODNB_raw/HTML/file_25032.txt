<span class="headword">Segar,  Francis, the younger</span>  (<em>b. </em>before 1564, <em>d.</em> 1615), <span class="occ">courtier</span>, was the son of Anne Sherard and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25031/', "Francis Seager (or Segar)")</script> of Devon, a poet and translator known for his <span class="italic">School of Vertue</span> (1557) and his verses on Richard III in William Baldwin's <span class="italic">A Mirror for Magistrates</span> (1563). Francis had a younger brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25033/', "Sir William Segar")</script>, who became Garter king of arms, and a sister, Jane, who authored &#145;The divine prophesies of the ten sibills&#146; (1589), a bound manuscript intended for Queen Elizabeth (BL, Add. MS 10037). Jane married Lionel Plumtree, who may have been connected to the Muscovy Company, and lived for a time in Russia  (Frye, 102). William and Francis are named in Francis Meres's <span class="italic">Palladis tamia. Wits Treasury</span> (1598) as contemporary painters in England  (Meres, 287<i>v</i>). A number of paintings attributed to Segar survive, but it is unclear whether William was responsible for all of these or whether some were by Francis.<br>
<br>Little is known of Francis Segar's early life. A reference in the will of Richard Westerfield (dated 4 December 1565) to a house in St Benet Paul's Wharf, &#145;then in the tenure of Francis Segar, citizen and scrivener&#146;, may be to the residence of Francis's father  (TNA: PRO, 11/48/411<i>v</i>&#150;413). The possibility is strengthened by the fact that two children of William (<i>b</i>. 1604)&#151;who was a son of Sir William Segar and his second wife, Mary&#151;were born at the College of Heralds and baptized at St Benet: Ann in 1623 and Francis in 1624. Moreover, Westerfield's will indicates that the Segar living in the &#145;messuage&#146; was a &#145;citizen and scrivener&#146;; Francis Nycholson, alias Seagar, father to Francis the elder, was made free of the Stationers' Company on 24 September 1557  (Arber, 1.69); and William Segar, Garter king of arms, was also trained as a scrivener.<br>
<br>On 28 December 1591 Francis Segar's name was recorded in the register of the University of Padua with the notation that he was an Englishman with a scar on the underside of his left hand&#151;&#145;cum cicatrice in ima parti manus sinistrae&#146;  (Andrich, 133). Entries in Segar's <i>album amicorum</i>, or autograph book, indicate that he was a captain (Hunt. L., HM 743), as does an ode written by Hermann Fabronius to &#145;Franciscum &agrave; Segra captaneum Lichtenaviensem&#146;  (Universit&auml;tsbibliothek Kassel, 2&deg; MS poet. et roman. 12, 499&#150;502). An earlier speculation that the younger Francis was the Segar who was captain of the <i>Golden Noble</i> in 1589  (Tenison, 61&#150;3) has proven false  (Spies, <span class="italic">Francis Segar: Die erste Probe</span>). Because Francis's brother served in the Netherlands in 1586 with the earl of Leicester, it is possible that he served there as well.<br>
<br>Whatever his military service, if any, Francis Segar spent most of his career in Kassel. From 1594 or 1595 to 1615 he served as gentleman of the bedchamber and counsellor to Landgrave Moritz of Hesse-Cassel, an influential protestant prince who hosted English actors at his court and kept an alchemical laboratory said to be the most impressive in Europe  (Universit&auml;tsbibliothek Kassel, 4&deg; MS chem. 47). Segar was present in 1596 at the baptismal ceremonies for the landgrave's daughter Elisabetha, attended by a delegation from the child's godmother, Queen Elizabeth of England; at the coronation of James I in London in 1604; and at the visit in 1611 of the landgrave's son Otto to England, where the young prince sought a marriage settlement with the king's daughter, Princess Elizabeth. John Stow, recording Prince Otto's visit in his <span class="italic">Annales</span>, describes Segar as &#145;chiefe gentleman, and director of his affaires &hellip; a sworne Counseller unto prince Morris &hellip; and one of his captaines in ordinary&#146;  (Stow and Howes, 912&#150;13).<br>
<br>While at the Kassel court Segar wrote several poems, including, in 1610, his first attempt at poetry in German (1610; Universit&auml;tsbibliothek Kassel, 4&deg; MS poet. et roman. 1); an autograph sonnet, in English, praising Moritz appears in a presentation copy of the landgrave's translation of the <span class="roman">Psalms</span> of David (1595; BL, C.27.e.7). From 1599 to 1611 Segar kept an <i>album amicorum</i>, which was later indexed by his great-nephew <a href="#cosubject_109695">Simon Segar the elder [<i>see below</i>]</a> and then by his great-great-nephew <a href="#cosubject_25032">Simon Segar the younger [<i>see below</i>]</a>. The album contains a wide selection of contributors, including a number of British notables&#151;Ben Jonson, Inigo Jones, Walter Ralegh, Henry Wotton, Robert Devereux, second earl of Essex, Prince Henry, and King James&#151;some addressing him as &#145;captain&#146; and some as &#145;Sir&#146;, although no record of his having been knighted has been found. Adam Segar, probably the Adam Segar who was captain of the <i>Golden Noble</i>, also signed.<br>
<br>Segar travelled extensively on behalf of the landgrave. Among several extant letters is one dated 10 May 1597 sent by him from Geneva (Hessisches Staatsarchiv Marburg, Best. 4 g Nr 35), reporting on affairs in France and Italy (while revealing his fluency in French and Italian), and two dated 22 October 1597 sent from Amsterdam by George Webster (Hessisches Staatsarchiv Marburg, Best. 4 g Nr 36 and 37), an English player who, with Robert Brown, fled Kassel during an outbreak of the plague. Segar's &#145;10 ember&#146; 1613 letter to Moritz (the date is only partially legible) reveals that the Englishman, returning from recent travels, had brought one of William's sons with him to Kassel, hoping to secure a place for the boy at Moritz's court  (Universit&auml;tsbibliothek Kassel, 2&deg; MS Hass. 57 (10, 168)). (Subsequent references indicate this was John Segar, who was seventeen at the time.) Segar's many trips abroad, along with correspondence dated 3 August 1607 and 10 June 1610 from Francis Segar to Robert Cecil, first earl of Salisbury, reporting events on the continent  (TNA: PRO, SP 81/9 and 81/10), suggest that Segar may have been part of an international intelligence network run by the second earl of Essex, and subsequently by Salisbury.<br>
<br>Francis Segar was on a mission to England in 1615, carrying papers from the landgrave, when he was stricken with the plague. In a letter to Moritz, dated 9 September that year (Hessisches Staatsarchiv Marburg, Best. 4 f England Nr 58), and another of the same date to Gaspar Muchio at the landgrave's court (Hessisches Staatsarchiv Marburg, Best. 4 f England Nr 59; for a transcript of both letters see Spies, <span class="italic">Francis Segar: Die erste Probe</span>), William Segar reported that his brother had died. Francis's belongings in England, he reported, consisted of apparel, books, jewels, medals, and &pound;40 in gold. Among the medals were one from Landgrave Moritz and two from King James; among the jewels were three diamond rings given by the queen (either Elizabeth or James's consort, Anne), Lady Elizabeth, and Prince Henry, a collection suggesting Segar's importance to the English crown. The letters spoke of arrangements for retrieving the remainder of Francis's estate, which, according to an inventory in Francis's hand, was sealed up in a wardrobe in Kassel. William was sending his eldest son, Jacob, and Abraham Vanderdoorf to Kassel to collect Francis's belongings and William's son John, who had been in Kassel under his uncle's care. It is unclear whether John actually returned in 1615; for two or three years he had been a student at the landgrave's Collegium Mauritanum, after which a record of 1616 places him at the University of Marburg. In 1615 John wrote <span class="italic">Juno, Minerva &amp; Venus</span>, with an acrostic poem dedicated to Landgravine Elisabetha (Universit&auml;tsbibliothek Kassel, 4&deg; MS Hass. 71); he is probably the &#145;J.S. Med. D e Coll. Joan. Oxon&#146; who wrote a tribute to the landgrave in <span class="italic">Monumentum sepulchrale &hellip;</span>, published in three parts from 1635 to 1640  (BL, 143.f.141).<br>
<br>Apparently, Francis Segar had wanted to end his service in Kassel as early as 1607. As he explained in a letter of 3 August 1607 to the earl of Salisbury reporting on the situation in Poland, Moritz would not grant him a pension, which would enable him to &#145;laye [his] bones&#146; in England  (TNA: PRO, SP 81/9). Eight years later he did just that, but he was still in the service of the landgrave who, he claimed, owed him a year's pension  (Hessisches Staatsarchiv Marburg, Best. 4 f England Nr 58 and 59). When Segar was in London on what proved to be his final assignment, he received letters from Arthur Barton in Holborn: one dated April was sent to him at Garter House, where he was apparently staying with his brother; one dated September was addressed to him &#145;at his house at Poplar&#146;, in east London, where he died  (Universit&auml;tsbibliothek Kassel, 2&deg; MS chem. 19(2)). His end, his brother reported to Muchio, was &#145;Christian like and resolved&#146;  (Hessisches Staatsarchiv Marburg, Best. 4 f England Nr 59).<br>
<br>Documents in Segar's hand from his twenty-year stay at the Landgrave Moritz's court are in Kassel and Marburg. These include correspondence, poems, copies of sermons, and treatises on alchemy and agriculture, the latter including instructions on the &#145;Inglishe practice of corne&#146; ((1595?); Universit&auml;tsbibliothek Kassel, 4&deg; MS philos. 13). Interestingly, a notebook of Sir Hugh Plat, author of <span class="italic">The Jewell House of Art and Nature</span> (1594), contains instructions for cleaning old paintings, sent to him by Francis Segar (BL, Sloan MS 2189, fol. 33) (Spies, <span class="italic">Francis Segar: Die erste Probe</span>).<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_109695"></a><span class="headword">Simon Segar the elder</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1684)<span class="occ"></span> was the great-nephew of <a href="#cosubject_109694">Francis Segar the younger [<i>see above</i>]</a> and the son of Thomas Segar (1607&#150;1670) of St Giles-in-the-Fields, Middlesex, courtier and Bluemantle pursuivant of arms, whose own father was the herald <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25033/', "Sir William Segar")</script>. Simon the elder entered Gray's Inn, London, on 22 September 1655. On 14 June 1667 he was appointed &#145;collector of all the dutyes of the house due from the gent: except commons due to the Steward&#146; at Gray's Inn  (Fletcher, 1.454). On 27 April 1670 he was appointed third butler, charged with &#145;collect[ing] the Chappell Readers Roll for this terme&#146;; on 6 November 1674, second butler (and library keeper); and on 22 November 1676, chief butler  (ibid., 2.9, 33, 43). On 13 November 1674 Simon was paid for &#145;setting up the sheilds of the severall Readers armes of this Society in the Library&#146;  (ibid., 2.34), and on 23 May 1679 with ensuring that &#145;papists&#146; were aware of &#145;an order of the House of Lords&#146; and had conformed to it  (ibid., 2.55). Simon Segar the elder was responsible for compiling &#145;A table showing the number of gentlemen admitted into the society of Gray's Inn in each year from 1521 to 1674, with an alphabetical list of the benchers and treasurers and other matter directly drawn from authentic sources&#146;  (BL, Harley MS 1912, fol. 1108, Gray's Inn). According to his will, made on 9 January 1684 and proved on 17 January  (TNA: PRO, PROB 11/375/67), Simon Segar, of St Andrew's, Holborn, owned several houses, dwelling in one in Spread Eagle Court. The will names Frances (<i>b. c</i>.1650), his widow and executrix, who was apparently pregnant at the time, and three children: a daughter, Anne, and two sons, <a href="#cosubject_25032">Simon [<i>see below</i>]</a> and Samuel (<i>bap</i>. 1682).<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_25032"></a><span class="headword">Simon Segar the younger</span>  (<em>b. </em>1675, <em>d.</em> in or after 1715), <span class="occ">author and genealogist</span>, of the parish of St Andrew, Middlesex, matriculated at Pembroke College, Oxford, on 28 July 1690, at the age of fifteen. Like his father, <a href="#cosubject_109695">Simon Segar the elder [<i>see above</i>]</a>, who died when he was nine, the younger Simon was interested in titles of honour and nobility. In 1711 he prepared a &#145;Genealogia familiae Harlaeanae apud Gallos&#146;, a genealogy of the Harley family in France (BL, Add. MS 70080). On 18 December 1714, while in the employ of Sir Walter Calverley, he certified that he copied &#145;divers ancient deeds &amp; scripts &amp; muniments relating to his [Calverley's] estates and family&#146;, creating a thick bound manuscript, in his own hand  (BL, Add. MS 27412), and a vellum roll of &#145;The genealogy and arms of the Calverley family&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 27414). The project took at least two years, as suggested by correspondence with Sir Walter, at Eshott near Bradford, Yorkshire, bound with the manuscript. Under the title &#145;Aspidora Segariana&#146; (1586&#150;1633; BL, Add. MS 12225), the younger Simon collated the grants and confirmations of arms for which his great-grandfather Sir William Segar was responsible. His <span class="italic">Honores Anglicani: or, Titles of Honour of the Temporal Nobility of the English Nation</span> was published in 1712, reissued as <span class="italic">Titles of Honour</span> in 1720. He also wrote a mourning poem on Queen Mary entitled &#145;Threno-Maria, a Rapsodicall Essay on the Death of Our Late Gratious Soveraign Queen Mary of Ever-Blessed Memory&#146;, published in 1695 in a memorial volume (Newberry Library, Chicago, Wing S2413).<br>
<br>The younger Simon Segar's interest in his own family history is reflected in an annotation in his copy of a fifteenth-century manuscript of the <span class="italic">Brut Chronicle</span>  (Yale U., Beinecke L., MS 494):<blockquote>This book was in the 3<sup>d</sup> year of Edw. the 4<sup>ths</sup> time William Nasby's but is now owned 1696 by Simon Segar son of Simon the son of Thomas the son of S<sup>r</sup> William Segar Kn<sup>t</sup> Garter principall King at arms (liveing temp Elizabeth Reg. &amp; King James the first) the son of Francis the son of Nicholas [cancelled word] by the daughter of &hellip; [Eleanor] Crasanthorpe the son of another Nicholas the son of Gerrard etc. (ibid.)</blockquote>He also recorded his genealogy in a note inscribed in the <i>album amicorum</i> of his great-great-uncle <a href="#cosubject_109694">Francis Segar the younger [<i>see above</i>]</a>, for which both he and his father before him provided an index. Sadly, as a boy Simon tore out several pages from the album, later confessing to the deed:<blockquote>
<i>NB</i>. There were several Other Autographs as appears by the first Index (made by my father Simon Segar son of Thomas son of S<sup>r</sup> W<sup>m</sup> Segar younger brother to S<sup>r</sup> Francis) w<sup>ch</sup> refers to the Pages divers of w<sup>ch</sup> were torne out by me Simon Segar (son of Simon Segar aforesaid) when a Boy after my fathers decease &hellip;.</blockquote>The date and place of the younger Simon's death are unknown. He was alive on 18 December 1714, when, at age forty, he certified that he copied materials relating to the Calverley family and estates.<br>
