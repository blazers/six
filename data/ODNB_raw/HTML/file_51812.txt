<span class="headword">Creak,  (Eleanor) Mildred</span>  (1898&#150;1993), <span class="occ">child psychiatrist</span>, was born on 11 August 1898 in Swann Lane, Cheadle Hulme, Stockport, Cheshire, the elder daughter of Robert Brown Creak, mill engineer, and his wife, Ellen, <i>n&eacute;e</i> McCrossan. She knew from an early age that she wanted to be a doctor and work with children. She entered the London School of Medicine for Women at the age of eighteen years but after a year transferred to University College Hospital (UCH), London, and qualified MB, BS (London) in 1923. While a medical student she developed an admiration for two psychiatrists on the staff at UCH, Bernard Hart and A. F. Tredgold. This led her to want to specialize in psychiatry.<br>
<br>At the time that Creak qualified it was difficult for women doctors to obtain employment, and she made ninety applications before securing a post. While a medical student she had become a Quaker, and in 1924 she was appointed assistant physician to the Quaker mental hospital, The Retreat, in York. She remained there for four years and then in 1929 was appointed to the Maudsley Hospital, London. There she helped to lay the foundations for what became an internationally recognized centre for research into child and adolescent psychiatric disorders. In 1932 she was awarded a Rockefeller Fellowship for postgraduate training in the United States, where she spent most of her time at the Philadelphia Child Guidance Clinic. On her return she engaged in clinical and academic work with children, specializing in those whose problems had a biological basis. At this stage in her career she published articles on organic psychoses, chorea, tics, compulsive utterances, and hysteria in childhood. In the mid-1930s, she was involved in planning the first psychiatric in-patient unit for children in the country at the Maudsley Hospital, but war was declared when it had been open for just a month, and the patients were evacuated to Mill Hill Hospital. Creak herself joined the Women's Army Corps and rose to the rank of major. Much of her service was in India.<br>
<br>At the end of the war Creak was offered a post at the Maudsley but declined, disliking what she felt was an over-emphasis there on statistical research, for which she felt she was not fitted. Instead in 1946 she took up the offer of a post at the Hospital for Sick Children, Great Ormond Street, London, where she established a thriving, clinically active department with a strong training role. From the time of her appointment to her retirement in 1963 she worked tirelessly to establish the credibility of the speciality of child psychiatry in the world of paediatrics, a world in which many of her paediatric colleagues questioned the importance of emotional factors in the lives and illnesses of their patients. Her success can be gauged by the fact that the department that she founded became one of the largest in the hospital.<br>
<br>Perhaps Creak's best-known contribution was in autism. Many autistic children were referred to her, and she developed what was then the unfashionable concept that it stemmed not from parental inadequacy, as was commonly believed by her child psychiatric colleagues, but from constitutional or what were later called genetic factors. This view was based on studying 100 children with autism, many of whom turned out to have evidence of brain dysfunction. She chaired a working party to establish criteria for the diagnosis of autism, and her &#145;nine points&#146; were for some time the agreed basis for this diagnosis. She was highly respected both by paediatricians and psychiatrists. She gave the Charles West lecture at the Royal College of Physicians in 1958 and had a number of child psychiatric units named after her during her lifetime. These included a unit in Perth, Western Australia, and the child psychiatric in-patient unit at Great Ormond Street.<br>
<br>Creak's outstanding characteristic was her gentleness. Paradoxically she was both highly puritanical and exceptionally tolerant. When a psychotherapist in her department bought a comfortable couch for his child patients (and doubtless to rest on himself in exhausted moments), she caught sight of it and exclaimed &#145;you're turning this place into a brothel&#146;. With her complete lack of make-up, her horn-rimmed spectacles, and her skirt length that made no concession at all to prevalent fashion it is difficult to imagine a person less likely to have any idea what a brothel was really like. Yet she was totally non-judgemental when it came to parents who behaved deplorably, and merely tried to do her best for their children.<br>
<br>Creak had a wide circle of friends but few interests outside her work. She never married. She was a committed Christian and an active Quaker. After her retirement she went to live in Welwyn Garden City and attended Friends' meetings there regularly. She suffered from Alzheimer's disease for most of the last two decades of her life, and latterly from cancer, but she continued to attend meetings until her last months. She died, of breast cancer, at her home, Martins House, Jessop Road, Stevenage, Hertfordshire, on 27 August 1993.<br>
