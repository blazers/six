<span class="headword">Pinto,  Thomas</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1728, <em>d.</em> 1783), <span class="occ">violinist and composer</span>, was baptized at St Giles Cripplegate, London, on 2 February 1728, the son of Guglielmo Pinto, an Italian gentleman of Portuguese ancestry, who for political reasons fled from his high-ranking position in Naples to England, where he married and had three sons. Only his mother's first name, Mary, is known, but the &#145;Memoir of George Frederick Pinto&#146; (1828) indicates that there was friction in the marriage for religious reasons, and the couple eventually separated. Thomas Pinto showed musical ability from an early age, becoming adept enough as a violinist to lead the band at St Cecilia's Hall, Edinburgh, in his early years. In the 1750s he was performing in London as a leader and soloist. He succeeded the violinist Felice Giardini as leader at the King's Theatre in 1757, and in 1762 played concertos at oratorio performances organized by Thomas Arne at Drury Lane, becoming leader of the opera orchestra there in 1763.<br>
<br>In 1769 Pinto undertook an unsuccessful speculation in Marylebone Gardens in partnership with a Mr Troughton (not Samuel Arnold, as mentioned in many sources, though Arnold's music was performed). A wet summer ruined the project and Pinto evidently lost &pound;2000. He fled to Scotland, where he remained until 1773. He then led at the Smock Alley Theatre, Dublin, for six years. He appears to have retired to Edinburgh, where he died in 1783.<br>
<br>Burney described Pinto as an exceptionally gifted violinist whose superior sightreading abilities allowed him to get away without much practice, until the arrival of Giardini about 1750, whose professionalism forced him to take more care. In Dublin, John O'Keeffe found his manner &#145;perfectly respectable, proper and very grave&#146;  (O'Keeffe). Pinto published a set of six sonatas for violin about 1770.<br>
<br>On 16 October 1766 Pinto married his second wife, the singer <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/3322/', "Charlotte Brent (1734&#150;1802)")</script>; they had seven children. His first wife, a German singer named Sybilla Gronemann, whom he had married in 1745, was mother to several children including a daughter, Julia, a singer who married Samuel Sanders (or Saunders) and was the mother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22306/', "George Frederick Pinto (1785&#150;1806)")</script>.<br>
