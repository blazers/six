<span class="headword">Tilsley,  John</span>  (<em>c.</em>1614&#150;1684), <span class="occ">clergyman and ejected minister</span>, was born in Lancashire, possibly near Bolton; nothing is known of his parents. He was educated at Edinburgh University, where he graduated MA on 22 July 1637. He became curate to Alexander Horrocks, vicar of Deane, Lancashire, and signed the protestation there on 23 February 1642. On 4 January 1643 Tilsley married Margaret Chetham (1621&#150;1663) at the collegiate church in Manchester. She was the daughter of Ralph Chetham and a niece of Humphrey Chetham, the founder of Chetham's Hospital. Margaret died on 28 April 1663, two weeks after the miscarriage of her ninth child. Of their children, only four survived infancy.<br>
<br>Tilsley was with Sir John Seaton's parliamentary forces when they took Preston on 9 February 1643, and he wrote an account of the affair. The benefice of Deane was given to him by a draft order of the House of Lords on 10 August 1643, his predecessor, Horrocks, being retained at Deane as assistant minister until 1648. Tilsley was appointed by parliament on 13 December 1644 as one of the ordaining ministers in Lancashire. He took the covenant and became one of the leading presbyterians in the county. In 1646 he joined with Richard Heyrick, Richard Hollinworth, and others in petitioning parliament to set up an ecclesiastical government in Lancashire as according to the advice of the Westminster assembly. Adam Martindale described Tilsley and other Manchester presbyterians as &#145;zealous (usually called Rigid) Presbyterians, that were for the setting up of the governance of the Church of Scotland amongst us&#146;  (<span class="italic">Life of Adam Martindale</span>, 62&#150;3). In the same year Tilsley wrote a vindication of the petition and its promoters (<span class="italic">A True Copy of the Petition of the Twelve Thousand, Two Hundred</span>). This was in answer to a pamphlet in the Independent interest entitled <span class="italic">A New Birth of the City Remonstrance</span>. Parliament answered the petition by establishing presbyterianism in Lancashire by an ordinance dated 2 October 1646, and Tilsley became a principal member of the Bolton or second classis. In 1648 he signed the &#145;harmonious consent&#146; of the ministers of Lancashire with those of London, which upheld the solemn league and covenant and fiercely condemned the toleration of sectaries, as did his assistant Alexander Horrocks.<br>
<br>Tilsley refused the engagement in 1650. Humphrey Chetham, who died in 1653, made Tilsley one of the feoffees of his hospital and library, and one of the purchasers of books for the five church libraries that he founded: responsibilities which Tilsley conscientiously fulfilled. In 1655 Tilsley seemed inclined to accept an invitation to Newcastle, but pressure was brought upon him to stay at Deane church. On 13 July 1659 he subscribed to the accommodation between the presbyterian and Independent ministers of Lancashire. After ejection following the <span class="roman">Act of Uniformity</span> in 1662, Tilsley continued to live in Rumworth in Deane parish, where he acted as trustee of a fund for the relief of the poor of Rumworth and also as a trustee of Deane School.<br>
<br>In 1665 Tilsley attracted the attention of the authorities for holding conventicles, and the episcopal returns of 1669 record two or three meetings a week of &#145;ministers and others&#146; in Deane parish  (Turner, 1.335). In 1670 Tilsley was threatened under the <span class="roman">Five Mile Act</span> of 1665. However, in the same year he conformed and was licensed as a lecturer at Deane. In late July 1670 John Rawlet passed on the news to Richard Baxter that Tilsley was one of three or four nonconformists, and the only one &#145;of Note&#146;, who had been persuaded to conform by the &#145;candour&#146; and &#145;arguments&#146; of Bishop John Wilkins  (Keeble and Nuttall, 2.96). Thereafter Tilsley preached not only at Deane but also at Bolton and nearby Cocky chapel. However, he was prosecuted under the <span class="roman">Oxford Act</span> in 1675 and after protracted legal proceedings (which included his opponents providing graphic accounts to the central government of his evasions of the requirements of due conformity and his local power) he was ejected from the lectureship.<br>
<br>The diaries of Henry Newcome and Oliver Heywood and the autobiography of Adam Martindale show Tilsley to have been on intimate terms with those divines. According to Edmund Calamy, Tilsley &#145;had prodigious parts, a retentive memory which made whatsoever he read his own, a solid judgment, a quick invention, and a ready utterance&#146;  (Calamy, <span class="italic">Abridgement</span>, 2.402). Tilsley died at Manchester on 12 December 1684. Oliver Heywood accorded him the epitaph &#145;an admirable man&#146;, and recorded his age as seventy  (Heywood and Dickenson, 70). Although Newcome and Tilsley had sometimes had differences of opinion, Newcome nevertheless sincerely mourned the loss of his friend and attended the funeral and burial at Deane church on 16 December. Afterwards he preached to Tilsley's surviving children as the dead man had requested. By his will, proved at Chester on 13 June 1685, Tilsley left bequests to a number of nonconformist ministers, including Newcome and Martindale. He provided for his grandchildren, and named his daughter Margaret Partington and son-in-law Richard Partington as executors.<br>
