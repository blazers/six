<span class="headword">Gill,  Thomas Patrick</span>  (1858&#150;1931), <span class="occ">journalist and politician</span>, was born at Ballygraigue, Nenagh, co. Tipperary, on 25 October 1858, the son of Robert Gill, a civil engineer. He was educated by the Christian Brothers in Nenagh and entered Trinity College, Dublin, in January 1876, but he appears not to have graduated. In early life he was greatly influenced by his uncle Peter E. Gill, the founder and proprietor of a Nenagh paper, the <span class="italic">Tipperary Advocate</span>, and a member of the National Brotherhood of St Patrick, a Fenian organization. Through his uncle's influence, Gill became secretary of the North Tipperary Farmers' Association, a forerunner of the Land League. While still at college, he was sent by E. Dwyer Gray, the owner of the <span class="italic">Freeman's Journal</span>, to visit the west of Ireland, and he wrote a series of articles, &#145;The famine fever in the west&#146;. He subsequently worked as associate editor with William O'Brien of <span class="italic">United Ireland</span>, and in 1881 founded <span class="italic">Tipperary</span>, a nationalist paper in Thurles, co. Tipperary. After the suppression of the Land League in 1881, Gill went to America and worked in New York as editor of the <span class="italic">Catholic World</span>, and was hired by the <span class="italic">North American Review</span> to study land tenure in the United States. He subsequently wrote a series of articles for the <span class="italic">Review</span> called &#145;Landlordism in America&#146;.<br>
<br>Gill returned to Ireland in 1885 when, under the patronage of Charles Stewart Parnell, he became home-rule MP for Louth South. In November 1889 Gill went to America with John Dillon, William O'Brien, and Timothy Harrington to raise funds, and at this moment Parnell published his <span class="italic">Manifesto to the Irish People</span>, which precipitated the split in the Irish party. On his return, Gill took part in negotiations held in Boulogne in an attempt to repair the rift. However, these failed and he decided not to seek re-election in 1892. During this period, he met Horace Plunkett, and became a key figure in Plunkett's work to establish agricultural co-operatives and assistance for industry. In 1895 Gill worked with Plunkett on the recess committee (so-called because it met during parliamentary recess), whose task was to study the Irish economy. Gill reported on developments in state assistance in continental Europe, and as its secretary he wrote the committee's report recommending a system of financial and administrative backing for Irish agriculture. His skilful drafting ensured that the report was adopted unanimously.<br>
<br>In 1898 Plunkett bought the Dublin <span class="italic">Daily Express</span> and appointed Gill as editor. Here he provided a platform for the Irish literary revival, publishing articles by W. B. Yeats, John Eglinton (W. K. Magee), Lady Gregory, and &#145;AE&#146; (George Russell); James Joyce reviewed regularly for the paper. In May 1899 Gill was the host of a Dublin banquet for the Irish Literary Theatre, which was satirized by George Moore in <span class="italic">Hail and Farewell</span>, likening Plunkett and Gill to Flaubert's clerks, Bouvard and Pecuchet. The experiment with the <span class="italic">Daily Express</span> lasted just over a year, for, in 1900, Gill was appointed secretary to the newly formed department of agriculture and technical instruction, again headed by Plunkett, where he remained until 1923. During the last ten years of his life, he was a member of committees that considered various aspects of Irish agriculture and forestry. He negotiated the removal of the American government's embargo on the import of Irish potatoes, and during the First World War was a member of war committees for the supply and distribution of food and materials for agricultural and industrial production. He ended public life as president of the Irish Free State central savings committee.<br>
<br>Gill's background and his linguistic ability (he spoke French and Italian fluently) led to his appointment as one of the original members of the general assembly of the International Institute of Agriculture in Rome. He was a member of the council of the Ligue Internationale pour l'&Eacute;ducation Familiale in Brussels, and a corresponding member of the French Academy of Agriculture. He wrote a pamphlet on the constitutions of the British empire, and his translation of a book by L. Paul-Dubois on the Irish question was published in 1934. Plunkett described Gill as &#145;a practical Thomas Davis&#146;  (quoted in West, 42); Gill's political connections provided Plunkett with an essential link with the nationalists. He was called &#145;neutral Gill&#146; because of his tendency to go with the majority, and although his politics were on the moderate wing of nationalism he was frequently attacked by Unionists, who prevented his appointment to the constitutional convention of 1917 chaired by Plunkett.<br>
<br>In 1882 Gill married Annie, daughter of John Fennell; they lived in D&uacute;n Laoghaire, co. Dublin. He died on 19 January 1931 in the Whitworth Hospital, Dublin.<br>
