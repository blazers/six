<span class="headword">Walton, Sir  George</span>  (1664/5&#150;1739), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, was born into a family from Little Burstead, Essex, although details of his parentage and early life are unknown. He was commissioned lieutenant on 22 February 1690 and assigned to the <i>Anne</i> (Captain John Tyrell). In May the ship was dismasted in the battle of Beachy Head. Unable to sail under a jury rig she was run ashore to the west of Rye, and burnt to the waterline to prevent her capture. Following Tyrell to his new command, Walton moved to the <i>Ossory</i>, in which he saw action at the battle of Barfleur. In 1693 he became first lieutenant of the <i>Devonshire</i> (Captain Henry Haughton), serving in the channel, and in 1696 he moved to the <i>Restoration</i> (Captain Thomas Fowlis) with the main fleet. On 19 January 1697 he was promoted captain and ordered to command the <i>Seaford</i> (24 guns). He was in command of her when the French captured and burnt the vessel off the Isles of Scilly. After returning to England he was assigned to the <i>Seahorse</i>, which he commanded for the following two years, seeing service in the North Sea and off the coast of Holland, before joining Vice-Admiral Matthew Aylmer in the Mediterranean in 1699. For ten months between 1701 and 1702 he commanded the <i>Carcass</i>; he went in her to the West Indies, with the squadron under Vice-Admiral John Benbow, by whom, in March 1702, he was appointed to the <i>Ruby</i> (48 guns), one of the squadron with Benbow in the actions with Admiral Jean-Baptiste Du Casse on 19&#150;24 August 1702 off Cape Santa Marta on the coast of what was later Colombia. Of all those engaged Walton was the only captain whose conduct was above reproach; the <i>Ruby</i> closely supported the flag until disabled and ordered to make her way to Port Royal, Jamaica, with a prize. In June 1703 Walton was moved to the <i>Canterbury</i> by Vice-Admiral John Graydon with whom he returned to England in the following October. Continuing in the <i>Canterbury</i> for a total of six years and nine months, he was employed in the Mediterranean during 1705 and 1706. In 1707 he accompanied Sir Thomas Hardy in the voyage to Lisbon; at the subsequent court martial Walton gave evidence strongly in favour of Hardy, whose conduct was called in question. In September 1710 he took command of the <i>Montagu</i>, one of the fleet sent to attack Quebec under Sir Hovenden Walker; Walton captured two prizes during the passage. On his return in December 1712 he was ordered to act as commander-in-chief at Portsmouth.<br>
<br>Early in January 1718 he was appointed to the <i>Defiance</i>, and shortly afterwards he moved to the <i>Canterbury</i>; in her he went out to the Mediterranean with Sir George Byng (afterwards Viscount Torrington), and had a singular share in the action off Cape Passaro on 31 July 1718, having been sent in command of a detached five-ship squadron in pursuit of a division of the Spanish fleet. Walton took six ships and destroyed a further six in the Strait of Messina. His letter of 5 August informing Byng of his success was, according to <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span>, &#145;remarkable for naval Eloquence&#146;: &#145;Sir, we have taken and destroyed all the Spanish ships which were upon the coast: the number as per margin&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 606). Walton's laconic style was the source of some humour. Thomas Corbett pronounced him fitter to achieve a &#145;gallant action&#146; than to describe one, although in fact the extract from <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> forms only the final section of Walton's letter.<br>
<br>In 1720 Walton was appointed to the guardship <i>Nassau</i> at Sheerness and on 15 January 1721 he was knighted for his exploits off the coast of Sicily in 1718. On 16 February 1723 he was promoted rear-admiral of the blue, and in 1726 he was second in command of the fleet in the Baltic under Sir Charles Wager, wearing his flag in the <i>Cumberland</i>. Recalled from that service, he was again under Wager off Cadiz and Gibraltar in late 1726. In April 1727 he returned to the Baltic approaches with his flag in the <i>Captain</i>, second in command to Admiral Sir John Norris, and in the following year he was promoted vice-admiral of the white. In 1729 he was again with Wager in the channel and in the Mediterranean, flying his flag in the <i>Princess Amelia</i>. Commander-in-chief at Spithead in 1731, and vice-admiral of the red in January 1732, he was promoted admiral of the blue on 26 February 1734. In 1734&#150;5 he was commander-in-chief at the Nore, with his flag in the <i>Revenge</i> and then the <i>Newark</i>. In 1736 Walton retired on a pension of &pound;600 a year. He died, apparently unmarried, on 21 November 1739, aged seventy-four, and was buried at the parish church of St Mary the Virgin in Little Burstead, Essex, where his ancestors were also interred. Among the total of &pound;9600 he left in specific legacies, Walton gave &pound;3000 to his niece, Pooley Onslow, wife of Richard Onslow (who was his executor and to whom he also left the residue of his estate); &pound;2000 to their son; &pound;2000 to Charles Duran, the son of his natural daughter, Sarah, the wife of Jonas Duran, a Middlesex pewterer; and &pound;500 to his god-daughter, Anne, the youngest daughter of Sir John Tyrell, bt.<br>
