<span class="headword">Knevet,  Ralph</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1602, <em>d.</em> 1672), <span class="occ">poet and Church of England clergyman</span>, was baptized at St Margaret's, Hardwick, Norfolk, on 19 February 1602, the seventh child and second son of &#145;Raphe Nevett and Alis&#146;, relatives of the great Norfolk family of Knyvett. Admitted pensioner at Peterhouse, Cambridge, on 3 September 1616, Knevet seems not to have resided after December 1618. He was probably tutor in the Oxnead household of his patron William Paston in Norfolk (Paston's maternal grandfather was Sir Thomas Knyvett of Ashwell Thorpe). When Paston's wife, Lady Katherine Bute, died after childbirth on 30 December 1636, Knevet wrote <span class="italic">Funerall Elegies</span> (1637) as well as an inscription for the monument by Nicholas Stone, the celebrated master mason. In 1638 Knevet and Nicholas Stone jun. accompanied Paston on a tour to Florence and to Rome, where they then waited for Paston's return from Egypt in March 1639. The cautious Paston may have designed the journey &#145;to avoid employment&#146; and involvement during an unstable period; he was readily discharged from sequestration on 3 June 1644.<br>
<br>Knevet's first published work is <span class="italic"><i>Strati&#333;tikon</i>, or, A Discourse of Militarie Discipline</span> (1628), which is prefaced by thirty-seven dedicatory poems addressed in hierarchic order to Norfolk gentry active in militia organization or public affairs. It partly resembles instructional treatises like Roger Ascham's <span class="italic">Toxophilus</span> (1545), Barnaby Riche's <span class="italic">Alarme to England</span> (1578), and Sir Henry Knyvett's <span class="italic">The Defence of the Realme</span>, a manuscript presented to Queen Elizabeth in 1596. But <span class="italic"><i>Strati&#333;tikon</i></span> also belongs with the verse georgic, fashionable in the 1620s. Knevet expresses forthrightly (if in allegorical guise) his concern about the papacy's secular power, and advances Spartan arguments for military training to promote discipline and preparedness. He concludes with a dark threnody on two Norfolk military men who had died on the &Icirc;le de R&eacute; expedition (1627).<br>
<br>On 3 May 1631 a masque by Knevet, <span class="italic">Rhodon and Iris</span>, was presented at Norwich to the Society of Florists, for whom William Strode (<i>c</i>.1632&#150;1635) and Matthew Stevenson (1645) were later to write. Again allegory licenses bold speech&#151;this time satire of hypocritical puritans, besides two local individuals, an ambitious lawyer, and a military coxcomb. It provoked protests, which in turn elicited a published version (entered 12 November 1631 and printed in both Norwich and London). Its verse is sometimes rough, as if prose has been set as verse.<br>
<br>Knevet's <span class="italic">Funerall Elegies</span> (1637), written within three months, argue for cessation of grief in the exalted vein of mid-century elegies. Some have compared it to Donne's panegyrics on Elizabeth Drury but Knevet's praise is less wildly excessive: Lady Katherine actually was &#145;patronesse Of all [his] hopes&#146;  (<span class="italic">Shorter Poems</span>, 265). Otherwise Knevet's work remained in manuscript until the twentieth century. <span class="italic">A Supplement of &#145;The Faery Queene&#146; in Three Bookes</span>, dated 1635, continues Spenser's poem through books VII&#150;IX with a <i>mise en sc&egrave;ne</i> in Norfolk and continental Europe. The manuscript (CUL, MS Ee.3.53) is a fair copy in Knevet's hand, which he had prepared for publication; for some reason, however, he changed his mind and later purged it of almost all evidence of his authorship. <span class="italic">A Supplement</span> shows Knevet's interest in contemporary affairs (Albanio figures James I; Callimachus, Gustavus Adolphus) but inevitably disappoints any reader expecting Spenser's larger reach.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">A Gallery to the Temple</span> (BL, Add. MS 27447) contains Knevet's best poems. It remained in manuscript until careful editions by G. Pellegrini  (R. Knevet, <span class="italic">A Gallery to the Temple</span>, Studi e Testi, 6, 1954) and A. M. Charles (1966). Probably written in the 1640s, it was subsequently inscribed for &#145;Sir Robert Paston's Lady&#146;  (<span class="italic">Shorter Poems</span>, 277). Unlike such other homages to George Herbert as Christopher Harvey's, Knevet only occasionally imitates <span class="italic">The Temple</span> closely. As his title, from Giambattista Marino's <span class="italic">La galeria</span> (1619) suggests, Knevet means to present foreign spoils. Rejecting Italian superstition and English coldness (&#145;The Extremes&#146;), his devotional warmth, like Crashaw's, is capable of surprise (&#145;Truth&#146;; &#145;The Feast&#146;). A preface expounds Knevet's critical opinions, which include admiration of the Italian poets Vittoria Colonna and Marino, and dislike of secular Italian academies.<br>
<br>In 1652 Knevet was presented by William Paston to the living of St Michael's, Lyng, Norfolk, valued at &pound;66 per annum. He officiated as preaching minister until 21 September 1662, when he was ordained by the moderate presbyterian bishop Edward Reynolds. Knevet kept the parish register in his own hand until 9 August 1671. On 22 January 1672 he made a will, leaving all to his wife, Anne, his executor; he died probably before 25 March, and certainly before 16 July, when the will was entered for probate. Knevet was buried in the chancel at St Michael's, Lyng.<br>
