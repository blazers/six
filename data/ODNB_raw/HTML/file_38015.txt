<span class="headword">Stormonth,  James</span>  (1824&#150;1882), <span class="occ">Episcopalian minister and lexicographer</span>, was reputedly born in Edinburgh  (<span class="italic">The Athenaeum</span>, 11 Feb 1882), the son of James Stormonth, fish curer, and his wife, Jane, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Robertson. He had at least one younger brother. He was educated at the Canongate burgh school, Edinburgh, and the University of Edinburgh (1845&#150;7, 1851&#150;7) where he read arts and divinity but did not proceed to graduate. He entered the ministry of the Church of Scotland as a licentiate at New Street Church, Edinburgh. He married, at some time after the third proclamation of the banns on 29 August 1847, Mary Trotter Hunter (<i>b</i>. 15 April 1826), the daughter of the Revd Robert Hunter, a schoolmaster of Colinton, Midlothian, and Joanne Menzie Hunter (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Mehison). Appointed to a teaching post at the Canongate burgh school, he remained there until 1864, when disagreements with the school's directors led to his dismissal. In 1862 he had been admitted to the eldership of the Canongate Kirk; he was subsequently elected its session clerk. In 1867 this post was terminated amid recriminations, although he remained a member of the session until 1871. Between 1867 and 1869 he had a licentiate and teaching appointment in the parish of Annbank, Ayrshire, and from 1869 to 1870 in the parish of Dunbog, Fife. From 1870 to 1875 he worked in the Orkney Islands, at Rendall, Firth, and Stenness. It was during the five years he spent in Orkney that he began to make a name for himself in the field of English-language studies; he was also the writer of the &#145;Orcadian Boatman's Song&#146;. Arguments with his congregation in Stenness and the presbytery of Cairston, in part caused by the &#145;miserably inadequate income&#146; he received  (<span class="italic">Orkney Herald</span>, 22 Dec 1875) led to his demitting his post towards the end of 1875 and returning to Edinburgh shortly afterwards. Stormonth's philological work focused on the lexis, pronunciation, and orthography of English. His <span class="italic">Etymological and Pronouncing Dictionary of the English Language</span> (1871) was immensely popular with the general public&#151;by 1918 it had passed through eighteen editions. Its success lay in the clarity and succinctness of exposition of the subject matter. In the academic world, however, the work was received less approvingly. A devastating review by Henry Bradley in <span class="italic">The Academy</span> (April 1884), after Stormonth's death, exposed the numerous weaknesses in his etymological analyses. From the dictionary Stormonth derived other publications, including a series for schoolchildren and students on the vocabulary and spelling of English.<br>
<br>In 1880 Stormonth became a deacon of the Scottish Episcopal church; in 1881 he was ordained priest and served at the church of St John the Evangelist, Edinburgh. His tenure of the post was short: his health had been declining progressively for several months as a result of overwork, and he died on 5 February 1882 at his home at 7 Cornwall Street, Edinburgh. He was survived by his wife, two sons, and four daughters.<br>
