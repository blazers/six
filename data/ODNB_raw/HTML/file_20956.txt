<span class="headword">Ouseley, Sir  Ralph</span>  (1772&#150;1842), <span class="occ">army officer in the Portuguese service</span>, was born at Kilticoghly, co. Galway, the second son of John Ouseley and his wife, Anne, daughter of Francis Surridge of Fairyhill, co. Galway. He was the younger brother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20954/', "Gideon Ouseley")</script>. On 25 November 1794 he was appointed lieutenant in the Leicester fencible infantry, one of many regiments of home-service regulars called &#145;fencibles&#146;. He served gallantly with the forces in Ireland in 1798, commanded a detachment at the defeat of Lake's troops at Castlebar, and helped to force the surrender of the French at Ballinamuck. Ouseley was appointed to the 38th foot in March 1801. He commanded the grenadier company during Robert Emmet's insurrection in Dublin in 1803. For a year he was often detached to guard the powder mills near Rathcool. In 1804 Ouseley joined the 76th to go to India, and in succession was transferred to a company in the Royal African Corps in March 1805, the 82nd in August, and the staff of the army depot, Isle of Wight, in March 1807. In September 1809 he exchanged to the 63rd foot.<br>
<br>Ouseley then began a more continuous tenure by entering the Portuguese service under Marshal Beresford as major in the 18th infantry, with which he served during the campaigns of 1810&#150;12. He became lieutenant-colonel of the regiment after the capture of Badajoz, and commanded it in the Pyrenees in 1813, where he distinguished himself in action against a superior force near Pampeluna on 30 July 1813. He was then transferred to the 8th Portuguese, and commanded that regiment in a night attack on the height in front of Urda. In this action, his modest force of 500 men drove off a French force of 3000. Philippart highlighted this event, but Napier merely stated that the French were on this occasion dislodged from the heights by two Portuguese brigades. Ouseley was carried from the field with a bayonet wound in the breast and a musket ball through the abdomen, which was extracted from the back. He received the Peninsular gold medal for the Pyrenees.<br>
<br>Ouseley attained the rank of major, the highest he held in the British service, on 25 November 1813, and was placed on half pay on 25 October 1814. He then went to Rio de Janeiro, where the king of Portugal renewed his Portuguese rank of lieutenant-colonel, and made him a knight of the order of the Tower and Sword. In 1817 he raised and organized at Rio de Janeiro the 1st regiment. He commanded it in the capture of Pernambuco and was made a knight of San Bento d'Avis. In October 1817 he was promoted colonel and placed on the staff. In 1818 he was sent from Rio to England with dispatches, which he had the acuity to rescue when the vessel was taken by pirates.<br>
<br>Ouseley retired from the British service in 1825. He attained the rank of major-general in the army of Portugal. He died at Lisbon on 3 May 1842, aged seventy. An autopsy showed that the musket ball which passed through his body at Urda caused a lesion of the intestines, which after an interval of nearly thirty years contributed to his death. Ouseley's foreign knighthood was not recognized in British army lists.<br>
