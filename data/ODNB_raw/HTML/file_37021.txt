<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Woolley, Sir  (Charles) Leonard</span>  (1880&#150;1960), <span class="occ">archaeologist</span>, was born at 13 Southwold Road, Upper Clapton, Hackney, London, on 17 April 1880, the third of eleven children (four boys and seven girls) of the Revd George Herbert Woolley, curate of St Matthew's, Upper Clapton, and his wife, Sarah Cathcart. Coming from a large family, he had to finance his education by scholarships for St John's, Leatherhead, and New College, Oxford, where he achieved a first in <i>literae humaniores</i> (1903) and a second in theology (1904). By his final year at university Woolley had abandoned his initial ambition of taking holy orders, settling instead on becoming a schoolmaster. When the warden of New College, W. A. Spooner, advised him to take up archaeology, Woolley acquiesced. After studying modern languages on the continent, he was in 1905 appointed assistant to Arthur Evans, keeper of the Ashmolean Museum. Woolley served his apprenticeship in field archaeology while excavating with D. Randall-MacIver in Wadi Halfa (Egyptian Nubia) in 1907&#150;11; during this period he also conducted a brief excavation of Roman baths at Teano in Italy.<br>
<br>Woolley's first experience with the ancient Near East came at Carchemish (Syria), a project that D. G. Hogarth had organized for the British Museum. When the excavation director, R. Campbell Thompson, left the project after the first season (1911), Woolley accepted the position and directed the five remaining seasons of the project (1912&#150;13, 1920). Working with T. E. Lawrence as his assistant, Woolley uncovered defensive works, temples, and palaces of neo-Hittite (9th&#150;8th centuries <span class="smallcap">BC</span>) Carchemish; the sculptured orthostats that graced the buildings provided important documentation of neo-Hittite art. Woolley also recovered traces of earlier occupations, but circumstances prevented him from uncovering significant portions of these.<br>
<br>Woolley and Lawrence also collaborated in a survey of Wadi Araba south of the Dead Sea, their work bringing to completion the Palestine Exploration Fund's programme of mapping all the Holy Land. This work, published in 1915 as <span class="italic">The Wilderness of Zin</span> under both collaborators' names, produced information and experience that was later useful to Lawrence's war. With the outbreak of the First World War Woolley served as an intelligence officer posted to Cairo, attaining the rank of major before the Turks took him prisoner late in 1916 when his ship blew up in the eastern Mediterranean. During his internment Woolley entertained his fellow prisoners of war with written vignettes of his archaeological experiences in Italy, Egypt, and Syria; published in 1920 as <span class="italic">Dead Towns and Living Men</span>, these stories humorously depict the often difficult and sometimes dangerous conditions of archaeological work in Ottoman Near East. When the unsettled post-war conditions impeded further excavation at Carchemish, Woolley collaborated in 1921 with T. Eric Peet in excavations at Tell al-Amarna (briefly the capital of New Kingdom Egypt) on behalf of the Egypt Exploration Society.<br>
<br>After several seasons in Egypt Woolley began the work for which he is best remembered, his excavations at Ur in southern Iraq. R. Campbell Thompson (1918) and R. H. Hall (1918&#150;19) had started excavations there on behalf of the British Museum, but this work fell into abeyance for lack of funds. When in 1922 the British Museum accepted the proposal by the University of Pennsylvania Museum of a joint venture at Ur, Woolley was named the expedition's director. He worked at Ur for twelve seasons between 1922 and 1934, assisted during many of those seasons by Katharine Keeling, who became his wife, and by Max Mallowan. He also completed the excavations at the nearby site of al-&#145;Ubayd that Hall had begun. Woolley revealed at Ur occupation beginning in the prehistoric &#145;Ubaid period and enduring into Hellenistic times, a span of four and a half millennia (roughly 4500&#150;200 <span class="smallcap">BC</span>). His most enduring discoveries belong to the eight centuries between 2600 and 1750 <span class="smallcap">BC</span>, from the heyday of the Sumerian civilization to the time of Hammurabi.<br>
<br>Woolley first encountered the famous royal cemetery in autumn 1922 while extending Hall's work but elected to defer tackling it until the 1926&#150;7 season in order to give himself time to master the technical difficulties of Mesopotamian excavations and to train a skilled workforce; few archaeologists would have had the patience to follow this intelligent course. Of the sixteen tombs that Woolley identified as royal, many contained stunning wealth, as did several other tombs that did not satisfy his criteria for royalty; among the thousands of burial objects are some of the great examples of Sumerian art. The royal tombs also contained as many as seventy-four other bodies, apparently retainers accompanying their master in death; this macabre touch stirred great popular interest. The royal tombs formed the initial (2600 <span class="smallcap">BC</span>) nucleus of a larger cemetery of several thousand poorer graves, the interments occurring over the next half-millennium. Although Woolley argued for the royalty of his sixteen burials, subsequent scholars have mulled over the nature of the cemetery without reaching firm conclusions.<br>
<br>The architectural gems of the city belonged to the Ur III (2100&#150;2000 <span class="smallcap">BC</span>) period when Ur was the capital of a small empire, and to the early Old Babylonian (2000&#150;1750 <span class="smallcap">BC</span>) period when the city fell into the hands of neighbouring princes. The first Ur III king built the religious centre of the city; his ziggurat, or stepped tower-like platform, has become an iconic image of Mesopotamian architecture. Later Mesopotamian kings periodically renovated the ziggurat and main temples, notably in the fourteenth century <span class="smallcap">BC</span> and sixth century <span class="smallcap">BC</span>. Woolley also uncovered several residential quarters of the Ur III and Old Babylonian periods; although less spectacular than some of his other results, their combination of architecture, private archives, burials, and other finds continues to be an invaluable resource for understanding the social and economic fabric of more ordinary life in ancient Mesopotamia.<br>
<br>A change in the antiquities laws of Iraq encouraged many Mesopotamian archaeologists to shift their attention to Syria after 1933, then under the French mandate. In 1937 Woolley initiated his third great excavation project in Hatay (a part of northern Syria transferred to Turkey in 1938). He chose Tell Atchana (ancient Alalakh) and the port at al-Mina to investigate connections between the Aegean world and the Near East, Hatay forming a corridor between the eastern Mediterranean coast and the interior; his team also excavated at two prehistoric mounds near Atchana during the project's seven seasons (1937&#150;9, 1946&#150;9). At Atchana Woolley found a sequence of palaces and temples belonging to the middle and late Bronze ages (2000&#150;1200 <span class="smallcap">BC</span>). The walls of one palace had been decorated with frescoes in a style borrowed from Minoan art, an unanticipated result for Woolley's research. Their archives of cuneiform tablets make Alalakh levels VII (<i>c</i>.1700 <span class="smallcap">BC</span>) and IV (<i>c</i>.1450 <span class="smallcap">BC</span>) the most discussed portions of the sequence; the inscription carved on the statue of King Idrimi is still one of the few historical sources for the time around 1500 <span class="smallcap">BC</span>. The excavations at al-Mina revealed ten levels of structures that Woolley identified as warehouses associated with Greek pottery and other objects, a sequence that Woolley assigned to the eighth to fourth centuries <span class="smallcap">BC</span>. Although the al-Mina results are incompletely published, they remain a cornerstone of discussions about Greek commercial enterprise in the east.<br>
<br>At the request of the archaeological survey of India, Woolley visited the subcontinent in 1938 on an inspection tour, aiming to revive the moribund survey. He advised a focus on training, and recommended that Mortimer Wheeler be named director-general; this happened in 1944. During the Second World War Woolley served as lieutenant-colonel with a brief to safeguard European patrimony. He was knighted in 1935, and received numerous scholarly distinctions (honorary degrees from the universities of Dublin and St Andrews, and the Lucy Wharton Drexel (University Museum, 1955) and the Flinders Petrie (University of London, 1957) medals.<br>
<br>For much of his adult life Woolley split his year between Near Eastern fieldwork and London, where he turned his attention to writing and lecturing; in both worlds he was extraordinarily energetic. He was a hard but fair taskmaster in the field, and drove himself very hard&#151;the workday began within half an hour of sunrise, and Woolley continued well past midnight in his office. He worked with two or three assistants, a small staff that supervised a workforce of up to 400 men (&#145;the maximum consistent with proper supervision&#146;, in Woolley's words); such ratios of staff to workforce, although common at the time, can compromise the quality of excavation. As a result, Ur's contribution to Mesopotamian chronology remained secondary, and Atchana's history has attracted a prolonged, ongoing debate. But the extensive exposures of public and residential architecture that he achieved in his three major Near Eastern excavations would have been otherwise impossible, and the trade-off was worth while.<br>
<br>Woolley held the admirable view, commonly expressed but rarely honoured in the profession, that failure to publish archaeological excavations is criminal. His record on this score was exemplary, for in addition to presenting annual reports and public lectures about his results he also produced usually multi-volume final reports for each of his three major projects. <span class="italic">Carchemish</span> appeared in three volumes (vol. 1 by Hogarth, 1914; vol. 2 by Woolley, 1921; vol. 3 by Woolley and R. D. Barnett, 1953); the usefulness of these volumes is often marred by inadequacy in excavation techniques of the day. He completed the ten volumes of the Ur report (<span class="italic">Ur Excavations</span>) soon after the project's conclusion, several volumes appearing during the lifetime of the project although budgetary problems delayed publication, the last volume appearing in 1976. The Ur reports, so rich in detail, are Woolley's principal legacy to Near Eastern archaeology. The final report on Tell Atchana (<span class="italic">Alalakh: Excavations at Tell Atchana</span>, 1955) appeared just six years after the excavations there ended, although this volume did not match the excellent standard of the Ur reports.<br>
<br>Woolley also composed several interpretative studies, among them <span class="italic">The Sumerians</span> (1928), <span class="italic">The Development of Sumerian Art</span> (1935), and <span class="italic">Abraham</span> (1936). Of less enduring value by their very nature, these works were marred from the beginning by shortcomings of Woolley's intellectual attitudes. His was not an academic bent, and his scholarship emphasized fieldwork over library research. Only incompletely did he attend to contemporary research on early Mesopotamia, and this limited his understanding of Sumerian civilization and of Ur itself, thereby encouraging his ill-founded persuasion that civilization arose significantly earlier in Mesopotamia than in Egypt; he therefore endorsed a chronology significantly older than that accepted by scholarship in the 1930s and later. Despite his youthful decision against holy orders he greatly exercised his theological interests, notably at Ur in his eager identification of a silt deposit as evidence of Noah's flood; his search for traces of Abraham sometimes forced his interpretations into unlikely directions.<br>
<br>Woolley found time to write popularizing books as well. In addition to his general introduction to archaeology, <span class="italic">Digging up the Past</span> (1930), he presented his findings at Ur in <span class="italic">Ur of the Chaldees: a Record of Seven Years of Excavation</span> (1929; revised in 1954 to include all twelve excavation seasons). He also gave Tell Atchana a popular treatment in <span class="italic">A Forgotten Kingdom</span> (1953). In these writings Woolley explained his results and their implications to the reading public, to satisfy the intense curiosity that his Ur discoveries had aroused and to encourage continued public support of ever more costly archaeological excavations. Here again he set a laudable standard that most archaeologists fail to meet. In these books, as well as in public lectures and in the tours he gave to the frequent visitors to his excavations, Woolley displayed both his gift for story-telling and showmanship, and his keen imagination that sometimes overcame scholarly sobriety.<br>
<br>Woolley married Katharine Elizabeth Keeling (1888&#150;1945), the widow of Lieutenant-Colonel (Bertram E.) Francis Keeling, on 11 April 1927; she was the daughter of Carl Theodore Menke, of King's Norton, Worcestershire, a merchant of Prussian origin. Suffering persistent ill health but accompanying Woolley in his fieldwork none the less, Katharine Woolley was &#145;a daunting and powerful personality of whom even at this time it is difficult to speak fairly&#146;  (Mallowan, 36). The Woolleys were childless. Woolley died at 16 Fitzroy Square, St Pancras, London, on 20 February 1960, and was cremated at Golders Green, Middlesex, on the 24th.<br>
