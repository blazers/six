<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Sherwin,  John Keyse</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1751, <em>d.</em> 1790), <span class="occ">designer and engraver</span>, was baptized on 27 May 1751 at East Dean, near Chichester, Sussex, one of nine children born to Francis Sherwin, a shipyard carpenter's labourer, and his wife Martha Nowell. Sherwin anticipated the &#145;ploughman poet&#146; Robert Burns and the &#145;Cornish wonder&#146; John Opie in being catapulted into society from humble circumstances and f&ecirc;ted as a genius. He was working as a gardener on William Mitford's estate near Petworth in 1769 when Mitford discovered his talent and sent his drawing &#145;The Head of a Blackmoor&#146; to the Society of Arts, where it was awarded a silver medal. Sherwin was then enabled to go to London, where he studied painting under the affluent showman John Astley, who had married into society and bought Schomberg House, to which fashionable ladies flocked. Sherwin was taught to engrave by the celebrated royal favourite Francis Bartolozzi, whose bohemian lifestyle exerted an equally malign influence on the impressionable prodigy. In 1770 he was admitted to the schools of the Royal Academy, and in 1772 gained the gold medal for a historical picture.<br>
<br>According to the contemporary artist Edward Dayes his training left Sherwin full of &#145;impudent assurance&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 349). On leaving Bartolozzi in 1774 he set up on his own, his first published plate being <span class="italic">The Madonna</span> (1775), after Sassoferrato. He exhibited ambitious red-and-black chalk drawings of historical subjects over the next ten years and was appointed &#145;engraver in the red chalk manner&#146; to George III. He engraved some fine portraits and subjects after Sir Joshua Reynolds, Angelica Kauffman, Thomas Gainsborough, and others and he was undoubtedly talented and skilful. He was chiefly celebrated in his own day for such &#145;history prints&#146; as his fine altar pieces after Guido Reni at Magdalen College, Oxford, and after Anton Raphael Mengs at All Souls; <span class="italic">The Fortune Teller</span>, after Reynolds; and <span class="italic">The Death of Lord Robert Manners</span>, after Thomas Stothard (for which last Thomas Macklin paid him &pound;700). His style in line engraving was distinctively metallic and flashy, tending to stylization and full of bravado. In 1785, on Woollett's death, he became historical engraver to the king. He also began to engrave and publish a series of his own designs, but he lacked a talent for composition: <span class="italic">The Happy Village</span> and <span class="italic">The Deserted Village</span> (1787) were ill-conceived and their fashionable mixed-method technique was muddy in effect. Another historical print, <span class="italic">The Finding of Moses</span> (1789), was a transparently commercial device for grouping portraits of the leading society ladies with the princess royal starring as Pharaoh's daughter. Fashionable ladies flocked to his house, vying for inclusion. He charged a bold 3 guineas for the print, with early impressions costing double that. His oil &#145;The Installation Dinner at the Institution of the Order of St Patrick in 1783&#146;&#151;some 50 or 60 feet long&#151;was left unfinished at his death, as was his engraving of it.<br>
<br>Such projects tended to justify Dayes's caustic observation that Sherwin's &#145;vanity was so great that he imagined nothing too difficult&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 349), and it was probably these ambitious publishing schemes that ultimately broke him. According to Dodd, Sherwin, &#145;realizing by his labours considerable affluence &hellip; launched into an imprudent course of life by which he destroyed his constitution and met with a premature death &hellip; at the age of 37&#146;  (Dodd, fol. 232). The unsympathetic Dayes did not mince his words:<blockquote>by running from one excess to another, he broke a good constitution, impaired his mind, and so embarrassed his affairs, that he was afraid to appear abroad: under these wretched circumstances he sank into eternity, at the house of Wilkinson, the print-seller in Cornhill. (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 349)</blockquote>Sherwin died at a small alehouse in Oxford Road, Westminster, on 20 September 1790. A sale of items from his workshop was held on 9&#150;10 November; Robert Wilkinson acquired his plates.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_25391"></a><span class="headword">Charles Sherwin</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1757)<span class="occ"></span> was baptized on 14 February 1757; he was John Sherwin's brother and worked as his assistant. He completed his brother's portrait of Captain Dampier, after Murray, and those of Viscount Folkestone, after Gainsborough, and George Cleghorne MD. His own work had no special merit and consisted of portraits for books. It is not known when or where he died.<br>
