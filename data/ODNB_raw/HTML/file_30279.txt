<span class="headword">Young,  Robert</span>  (1822&#150;1888), <span class="occ">philologist and translator</span>, son of George Young, manager of a flour mill, and Jean Dudgeon, was born in Edinburgh or in East Lothian on 10 September 1822; his father died when Robert was a child. After education at private schools, he was apprenticed to the printing trade and set up as a printer and bookseller on his own account in 1847. During his apprenticeship he used his spare time to study Hebrew and other oriental languages, and also interested himself in religious work; for three years he was connected with Thomas Chalmers's territorial church sabbath school in the deprived district of West Port, Edinburgh. He published a variety of works of oriental grammar and translation, which chiefly focused upon the study of the <span class="roman">Old Testament</span> in its ancient versions. His first production was an edition with translation of Maimonides's 613 precepts. In 1856 he married, and until 1861 he was literary missionary and superintendent of the mission press at Surat; during this time in India he added Gujarati to his linguistic portfolio, which already included Gaelic and Finnish, in addition to the Romance and Teutonic languages. From 1864 to 1874 he conducted the Missionary Institute in Edinburgh, and in 1867 he visited the most important cities in the United States.<br>
<br>The best-known of Young's works is his <span class="italic">Analytical Concordance to the Bible</span> (1st edn, 1879), which went through many editions, and more than a century later remained in print in two American editions and one British. Young said that the object of his <span class="italic">Concordance</span>, as Tyndale said of his <span class="roman">New Testament</span>, was that every &#145;ploughboy&#146; should know more of the scriptures than the &#145;ancients&#146;. He maintained that the main feature of the <span class="italic">Concordance</span> was the analytical arrangement of each English word under its original in Hebrew or Greek, with the literal meaning being given in each case. This enabled the reader to distinguish differences which were frequently obscured in the English <span class="roman">Bible</span> and which could not be ascertained from the <span class="italic">Concordance</span> produced by Alexander Cruden in 1737.<br>
<br>In 1871 Young stood unsuccessfully for the Hebrew chair at St Andrews University. Most of his life was passed in Edinburgh, where he died at The Grange, on 14 October 1888, leaving two sons and four daughters.<br>
