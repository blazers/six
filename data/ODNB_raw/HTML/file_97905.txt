<span class="headword">Jackman family</span>  (<em>per. </em>1763&#150;1976), <span class="occ">horticulturists and nurserymen</span>, based in Woking, Surrey, came to prominence as breeders of new clematis cultivars in the mid- and late Victorian period.<br>
<br>William Jackman (1763&#150;1840) founded the nursery in 1810 on 50 acres at St Johns, Woking. He was married to Sarah, with whom he had four sons. In 1830 the nursery passed to two of his sons, George Jackman (1801&#150;1869) [<i>see below</i>] and Henry, but the partnership did not prosper and within two years was dissolved, Henry going his own way. William's other two sons, James (<i>d</i>. 1865) and William, were both involved in the nursery trade in the vicinity of Woking. In 1852 William the younger married Ruth Waterer of another well-known nursery family whose nursery was at Hook Hill, Woking. By 1865 James was employing eighteen men and five boys at his Goldsworth Nursery at Hook Hill, Woking. <a name="cosubject_98244"></a><span class="headword">George Jackman</span>  (1801&#150;1869)<span class="occ"></span>, born at Woking on 25 March 1801, was the outstanding nurseryman among his brothers and he lent his name to the nursery. He married, on 28 October 1834, Mary Ann Freemantle (<i>d</i>. 1840), with whom he had a son, George Jackman (1837&#150;1887) [<i>see below</i>], who later entered the business. His wife died in 1840, and her unmarried sister became housekeeper. Holding 90 acres and employing thirty-five men and six boys in 1851, he expanded the nursery to in excess of 300 acres of growing plants.<br>
<br>About 1850 the plant hunter Robert Fortune introduced to Britain a wild clematis species from China, <i>C. lanuginosa</i>, that offered the possibility of a larger flower than was previously possible. Jackman and his son recognized its potential and in 1858 a mixture of three clematis pollen parents, <i>C. lanuginosa</i>, <i>C. Hendersonii</i>, and <i>C. viticella</i> &#145;Atrorubens&#146;, produced seed. The most significant resulted in the clematis cultivar <i>C. Jackmanii</i>, which was given the nursery code number &#145;seedling no. 1&#146;, indicating that it was probably the first of many deliberate hybrids the nursery attempted. With an abundance of large flowers, it was an immediate success and was awarded a first-class certificate by the floral committee of the Royal Horticultural Society on 4 August 1863. Whether the father or the son was the prime mover in creating the famous hybrid that bore the family name remains a matter of conjecture. George Jackman the elder died somewhat suddenly at Woking on 12 February 1869 following an attack of gout and was buried in St John's churchyard, Woking, where he had been churchwarden for twenty-five years.<br>
<br>His son <a name="cosubject_61072"></a><span class="headword">George Jackman</span>  (1837&#150;1887)<span class="occ"></span> was born at Woking on 13 March 1837, and was educated at a private school, Foster House, Egham, Surrey, before joining the nursery business. He married, at St John's, Woking, on 3 October 1865, Mary Ann, daughter of Thomas Lee, a farmer. They had four sons and four daughters, two of whom, Arthur George Jackman [<i>see below</i>] and Percy Jackman, later ran the business. On his father's death he succeeded to the ownership of the nurseries and displayed considerable business acumen; the nursery exported large quantities of plants to North America, the home trade was built up, and the stock of clematis was improved with new introductions.<br>
<br>In 1872 George Jackman co-wrote with his friend Thomas Moore, the curator of Chelsea Physic Garden and a horticultural journalist, the first book on the genus Clematis. <span class="italic">The Clematis as a Garden Flower</span> described how, as a result of the recent work of hybridizers, the hardy clematis had been transformed in fewer than ten years &#145;from an ordinary climbing shrub, handsome in some, and elegant in all its forms, to one of the most gorgeous of garden ornaments, unrivalled as a flowery woody climber&#146;  (p. 19). While the book reflected the depth of understanding and love of the subject that must have gripped the young George at an early age, it also made commercial sense to advertise and encourage the use of clematis in gardens. Judging by the names of the nobility after whom many clematis were named by the nursery, the Jackmans rarely missed the opportunity to bring their products to the attention of estate owners and other potential customers.<br>
<br>George Jackman also grew trees, roses, and shrubs. Ornamentals such as peaches were very profitable. Roses formed a large part of his trade and latterly rose petals were sold to the nearby Essential Oils Distillery at Byfleet. Brick making was also another side to his business. He died at Woking on 29 May 1887 after catching a cold that developed into pneumonia.<br>
<br>His son <a name="cosubject_98245"></a><span class="headword">Arthur George Jackman</span>  (1866&#150;1926)<span class="occ"></span> was born at Woking on 16 July 1866 and was educated at the county school at Cranleigh, before entering the family business. Under the provisions in his father's will, the nursery at St John's was sold and transferred to a new site of about 60 acres at Mayford and 70 acres in Smart's Heath Road near to Woking Railway Station. On 17 October 1895 he married Florence Martha (1869&#150;1907), daughter of George Pearson Stannage, painter and decorator. They had one son, (George) Rowland Jackman [<i>see below</i>]. During this period the clematis <i>C. texensis</i> (originally called <i>C. coccinea</i>) was introduced to Britain from Texas via France, and the Jackman nursery was at the forefront of using it to produce a strain of tulip-shaped cherry-pink to scarlet flowers, the most notable surviving cultivars being <i>C</i>. &#145;Duchess of Albany&#146; and <i>C</i>. &#145;Sir Trevor Lawrence&#146; (a president of the Royal Horticultural Society). During the First World War the horticultural trade slumped and the nursery, like many others, was put under the plough to grow food crops. Arthur Jackman died of leukaemia at his home, Alverstone, Wych Hill Lane, Woking, on 16 March 1926. He was buried at St Peter's Church, Old Woking.<br>
<br>His only son, <a name="cosubject_98246"></a><span class="headword">(George) Rowland Jackman</span>  (1902&#150;1976)<span class="occ"></span>, was born at Alverstone, Wych Hill Lane, Woking, on 1 July 1902, and was educated at Dane Court preparatory school, West Byfleet, and then at St Lawrence, Ramsgate. On leaving school in 1919 he studied forestry and worked on several estates, as the horticultural business suffered during the post-war depression and appeared to offer limited prospects. When signs of recovery appeared he underwent formal training as a nurseryman, spending a year with Barbier of Orl&eacute;ans, France, who specialized in trees and shrubs, and another year with J. R. Pearson &amp; Sons of Lowdham in Nottinghamshire. He returned to the family nursery in 1923 and three years later, on his father's death, he became a partner with his uncle Percy Jackman (1873&#150;1934), who was content to leave the everyday running of the business to a manager. On Percy's death in 1934 Rowland took sole charge and under his direction the nursery became mainly a retail establishment. By 1938 the nursery extended to about 130 acres and employed seventy men. He married, on 28 July 1936, Muriel Jessie Barbara, daughter of Peter Murray Ross, and they had a daughter.<br>
<br>Probably influenced by his broad training when young, Rowland Jackman had a keen eye for the unusual or good form of a genus across a wide spectrum of trees, shrubs, and perennials. His main method was to identify particularly fine forms of established plants and to propagate from them commercially, often spotting good plants while holidaying or travelling. He initiated a catalogue, <span class="italic">The Planter's Handbook</span>, and took great pains to ensure its accuracy for every year it was printed. Although he did not especially concentrate on raising new clematis, he did introduce three modern cultivars of note: <i>C</i>. &#145;Barbara Jackman&#146;, named after his wife, <i>C. alpina</i> &#145;Pamela Jackman&#146;, after his daughter, and <i>C</i>. &#145;Barbara Dibley&#146;, after his secretary. In 1960 he sold the nursery site for use as building land, and moved it two miles to Havering Farm. Finally, in 1967, he sold the business, but remained there for another five years studying plants and their uses, writing articles, and giving lectures. He was a committee member and judge for the Royal Horticultural Society, which in 1973 awarded him its highest honour, the Victorian medal of honour. He died at his home, Pyrlands, Maybury Hill, Woking, Surrey, on 26 March 1976.<br>
<br>The legacy of the Jackman family is the considerable number of large-flowered clematis cultivars that they produced and that continue to be available. <i>Clematis Jackmanii</i>, in particular, has stood the test of time for nearly 150 years and remains the best-known and most widely grown cultivar around the world.<br>
