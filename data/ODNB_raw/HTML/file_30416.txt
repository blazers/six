<span class="headword">Andrewes, Sir  Frederick William</span>  (1859&#150;1932), <span class="occ">pathologist and bacteriologist</span>, was born at Greyfriars House, Friar Street, Reading, on 31 March 1859, the eldest of the four sons of Charles James Andrewes, an engineer, who was mayor of Reading, and his second wife, Charlotte Parsons. He began his education at Oakley House School, Reading, and among his schoolfellows were Edward Bagnall Poulton, W. F. R. Weldon, and Owen Seaman. Andrewes formed then, and kept throughout his life, a special friendship with Poulton; they had like interests, as boys and young men, in field entomology and geology, and shared many expeditions in school holidays and, later, in vacations. Andrewes always retained his interests as a field naturalist, and Poulton records with pride that he was able later to include in the university museum at Oxford entomological varieties of great interest which Andrewes had taken in school holidays when he was between thirteen and fourteen years old&#151;early evidence of a skill and an alertness of observation which were later to serve him well in other areas.<br>
<br>Andrewes entered Christ Church, Oxford, in 1878; his essay is said to have made an especially favourable impression upon his examiners. In 1881, with biology as his subject, he was placed alone in the first class of the final honours school of natural science. In 1883 he was awarded the Burdett-Coutts university scholarship in geology. In 1886 he was elected to the Sheppard fellowship at Pembroke College, the holder of which was under obligation to study either law or medicine. Owing to his biological background he had already chosen medicine as his career, having won an open entrance scholarship at St Bartholomew's Hospital in London, and he began his studies there in 1885. After qualifying as MRCS, London, and BM at Oxford in 1887, Andrewes spent a short time in Vienna as a preliminary to entering upon a career as a consulting physician. He became FRCP in 1895. In the same year Andrewes married Phyllis Mary, daughter of John Hamer JP, publisher; they had a son and a daughter.<br>
<br>Andrewes had now become increasingly interested in pathology and bacteriology. The latter, undergoing vigorous development on the continent through the schools of Louis Pasteur and Robert Koch, had reached Great Britain rather late. One of its pioneers in this country was Edward Emanuel Klein, lecturer on physiology at St Bartholomew's medical school, and when Andrewes first made contact with the pathological laboratory there in 1885 Klein was already examining material from the wards for the tubercle bacillus, discovered by Koch some three years earlier. In 1893 Alfredo Auturus Kanthack was appointed lecturer in pathology and pathologist to the hospital, and Andrewes worked in increasingly close association with him until, on Kanthack's departure to Cambridge in 1897, Andrewes was appointed to succeed him.<br>
<br>Over the next thirty years (during which his post of lecturer at St Bartholomew's was raised to that of professor by the University of London in 1912), Andrewes saw the department change from a single laboratory to a separate building with three floors of laboratories and an additional one for post-mortem examinations. His tenure of office had begun at a time when pathology and especially the new science of bacteriology were developing an essential relationship with public health and with clinical medicine, and he was an important agent of that development. His reputation, which grew steadily with the years, depended more on his influence as a teacher, on his wide knowledge and experience, and on his care and wisdom as an expert and consultant on special problems, than on such new developments of knowledge as arose from the researches which he had always in hand. In pathology he added something of permanent value to the differential histology of lymphadenoma and to a more exact knowledge of arteriosclerosis. In bacteriology he took particular interest in variations within a bacterial species, as recognized by reactions with specific, immune sera. During the First World War he made a valuable classification on these lines of the variant strains of dysentery bacilli. He was one of the first to recognize the importance of healthy or mildly affected persons carrying such infections as diphtheria.<br>
<br>Andrewes was a man of quiet, friendly personality, readily accessible, generous with his help, and prone to flavour his wisdom with a sly humour. Throughout life, in work and recreation, his instinct and habit were those of a born naturalist; in his later years especially, these tastes found expression in the creation and tending of a rock garden, well known to all his friends. He had a great gift for the effective, though apparently free and informal, exposition of intricate problems, and was known as a forceful lecturer outside his own department. To the Royal College of Physicians he delivered the Dobell (1906) and the Croonian (1910) lectures, as well as the Harveian oration (1920). His deep knowledge and wide experience made him a valuable member of various public committees and of the Medical Research Council. He was elected FRS in 1915. In 1919 he was appointed OBE in recognition of his services during the First World War, and he was knighted in 1920.<br>
<br>Andrewes died at his home, Windy Gap, Merton Lane, St Pancras, London, on 24 February 1932. He was survived by his wife; his son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/40059/', "Sir Christopher Howard Andrewes")</script>, went on to become deputy director of the Medical Research Council.<br>
