<span class="headword">Wood,  Thomas</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1577), <span class="occ">soldier and religious activist</span>, may have been of either Leicestershire or Yorkshire origin. Until 1960 he was known only as one of the four Englishmen who founded the protestant exile community in Frankfurt am Main on 27 June 1554 and as an elder of the later English congregation at Geneva. He has also been identified tentatively (though undoubtedly incorrectly) by Christina Garrett as the mercer of that name who had some association with John Knox in 1553. The publication by Patrick Collinson in 1960 of the copies Wood's son Ambrose made of &#145;my father Captaine Thomas Wood his lettres to certaine noble personages and other his good freinds&#146;  (&#145;Letters of Thomas Wood&#146; in <span class="italic">Godly People</span>, 83) not only brought him out of the shadows, but also transformed our understanding of Elizabethan history.<br>
<br>Collinson discovered most of the biographical details now available, but it is possible to supply further information about Wood's military career. Although he may have attended Cambridge University, Wood is first publicly encountered as a man-at-arms of the garrison of Boulogne, jousting to celebrate the accession of Edward VI on 24 February 1547. In 1548 he was serving as a junior officer with the Boulogne horse in Scotland. On 17 July he was taken prisoner in an ambush at Linton Bridge, Haddingtonshire, and not released until the end of 1549. In 1551 he went to Ireland to negotiate a lease of former monastic property granted him for his arrears of pay. At Cork in April he met an old acquaintance from Boulogne, the new lord deputy, Sir James Croft, who employed him as a confidential messenger with the privy council until December 1552. On 19 July 1552 (styled &#145;the king's servant&#146;) Wood was granted a lease in reversion of Tintern Abbey, co. Wexford.<br>
<br>Nothing is known about Wood's earlier association with the other three founders of the Frankfurt community, except that one, William Williams, the assay-master of the Dublin mint, was married to his sister Jane by June 1554. Nor are Wood's precise motives for going into exile known, but he was accompanied by his wife, Anne, and possibly some of his children. He ultimately left two sons (Thomas and Ambrose) and five daughters, one of whom, Debora, was born in Frankfurt. Wood was one of the signatories of the congregation's invitation to John Knox to become its pastor, which raises the question of whether he had made Knox's acquaintance while serving on the borders. He was also a member of the faction that, under the leadership of William Whittingham, followed Knox to Geneva, where he and his family arrived in October 1555. In December 1557 he was elected an elder of the English congregation.<br>
<br>By 9 March 1560 Wood was back in England. He then wrote to Lord Robert Dudley, later earl of Leicester, about an inspection carried out at Portsmouth, evidence both of his resumption of military service and of his association with the Dudleys, which had certainly begun earlier. He reached the high point of his military career two years later when he served under Dudley's brother Ambrose, earl of Warwick, as clerk of the council and captain of a company in the garrison of Newhaven (as the English called Le Havre) between October 1562 and July 1563. In August 1563 Sir William Cecil nominated Wood as clerk of the council in a proposed appointment of Warwick as lord deputy of Ireland, but this was never implemented. In 1568 Wood was styled of &#145;Tottenham, Midd. Esq.&#146; and two years later as &#145;the queen's servant&#146;. Since the manor of Tottenham was an established perquisite of servants of the household, Wood may have held a minor post in the latter. In 1570 he leased the manor of Groby, Leicestershire, from the crown, where he resided until his death. He served as a Leicestershire JP and was closely associated, both socially and financially, with the third earl of Huntingdon, Leicester and Warwick's brother-in-law. By mid-1576 he was seriously ill and he died at Groby at some point during the spring of 1577. Wood made his will on 16 July 1576 and it was proved on 3 May 1577. He was survived by a widow named Agnes, who was still alive in 1598, but whether she was a second wife, or Agnes a variant of Anne, is unclear.<br>
<br>The letters copied by Ambrose Wood are both the central source for his father's life after 1563 and, as Collinson appreciated, among the most important records of Elizabethan lay puritanism. The most significant are an exchange with Cecil over the suppression of a puritan exercise in London in 1566, one to Whittingham of 15 February 1574, and&#151;the most dramatic&#151;an exchange with Leicester and Warwick in the late summer of 1576. They reveal much about Wood's religious allegiances and his responses to the major issues of the day, but&#151;as always&#151;they raise possibly more questions than they answer.<br>
<br>The letter to Whittingham includes the important recollection concerning the <span class="roman">Book of Common Prayer</span> that &#145;yow were the first that made me and many others mislike with the said boke&#146;  (&#145;Letters of Thomas Wood&#146; in <span class="italic">Godly People</span>, 89). It is not clear whether this took place at Frankfurt or Geneva, but it could imply that Wood returned to England in 1559 a committed presbyterian. He certainly kept the records of the English congregation at Geneva (at least until he left). The combination of his strong anti-episcopal views in the 1570s and his firsthand knowledge of the events of the exile has led Collinson to suggest that he rather than Whittingham was the author or compiler of the famous and controversial account of the Frankfurt community, <span class="italic">A Brieff Discours off the Troubles Begonne at Franckford</span> [1575]. On the other hand, if read in sequence his letters reveal his increasing hostility to the episcopate following the &#145;persecution&#146; of ministers who refused to wear the surplice, then those who refused to subscribe to the prayer book in 1571, and finally the suppression of exercises. This might imply an initial willingness to accept the Elizabethan church settlement that diminished over time in response to the church's treatment of nonconformity.<br>
<br>The correspondence with Warwick and Leicester was a consequence of Wood's illness in the summer of 1576. Wood had attended the great festivities at Kenilworth in 1575 and had spoken briefly to Leicester then. Had he been fit to travel in 1576, he would (he admitted) have preferred to see Leicester personally rather than to write. The surviving letters are eight in number: an initial letter to Leicester and a covering note to Warwick, both dated 4 August; an answer from Warwick on the 16th; one from Leicester on the 19th; a further letter from Wood to Warwick on the 20th; Wood's answers to Warwick's and Leicester's letters (both dated 7 September); and a final undated letter from Wood to both earls in early 1577. The subject of this exchange was an admonition from Wood that Leicester was being blamed for the dissolution of the exercise at Southam in eastern Warwickshire earlier in the summer. Wood also wanted to warn Leicester of &#145;verie common brutes verie dishonorable and ungodly&#146; about him  (&#145;Letters of Thomas Wood&#146; in <span class="italic">Godly People</span>, 92), but only by word of mouth (he had tried to do so at Kenilworth but could not find the opportunity). It has been assumed that these were related to Leicester's private life.<br>
<br>Leicester denied any responsibility for the Southam dissolution and claimed he had learned of it only when Elizabeth, who had her own sources, complained to him of &#145;disorders&#146; there. But as important as the content of the exchange is its style. What has struck most commentators is the combination of both Wood's boldness in criticizing Leicester and Leicester's willingness to defend both his conduct and his commitment to religion at length in his answer of 19 August. Wood appreciated that his initial admonition to Leicester was &#145;plaine, and peradventure may be thought to plaine&#146;  (&#145;Letters of Thomas Wood&#146; in <span class="italic">Godly People</span>, 92), and sent it to Warwick unsealed for him to read and then deliver to his brother personally.<br>
<br>Yet the real significance of this exchange is that it was not unique. Wood's correspondence with Cecil in 1566 had been a similar &#145;friendly admonition&#146; (as Cecil termed it) that Cecil was being blamed for the suppression of the St Antholin's exercise. Nor is the exchange between Wood and Leicester the only example of puritan criticism sent directly to Leicester and long defences by Leicester of his conduct. Leicester's willingness to tolerate and respond to the apparently constant carping and admonishing, however irritating it may have been&#151;&#145;I stand on the topp of the hill, where I knowe the smallest slipp semeth a fall&#146;, as he wrote to Wood on 19 August  (&#145;Letters of Thomas Wood&#146; in <span class="italic">Godly People</span>, 96)&#151;was a key aspect to his role as &#145;patron-general&#146; of Elizabethan puritans. It also accounts for the political influence of Elizabethan lay puritanism. Wood's Genevan loyalties were strong, but they should not obscure the fact that his public career in the crown's service placed him at the heart of the Elizabethan protestant establishment. What characterized that establishment was the very openness of the dialogue between men of Wood's rank and independence of mind and his nominal superiors, Cecil, Leicester, and Warwick.<br>
