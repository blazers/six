<span class="headword">Lindores,  Lawrence</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1437), <span class="occ">natural philosopher and university principal</span>, is first recorded as a Scottish student in Paris, taking his MA in 1393 under the nominalist Aegidius Jutfaes. Parisian records are wanting for the ten years before this, and nothing records his precise date or place of birth. As a master he presented pupils in arts up to 1401 at least; at the same time he was also studying in theology, in which he was a <i>scholaris</i> by 13 October 1394, BTh by 8 August 1403, and LTh by 1406. Playing only a modest part in the wider life of the (&#145;English&#146;) nation and university, he did successfully argue that members of his nation should not&#151;through the vagaries of end-of-schism politics&#151;lose their rights to supplicate for benefices under the aegis of the university.<br>
<br>Lindores is last attested at Paris on 7 August 1403, though still technically &#145;present&#146; in the university on 9 November 1403. He is next recorded&#151;for the first time in Scotland&#151;on 10 May 1408, when he is styled rector of Criech, near St Andrews. The appointment had been his from no later than 1407, by which year he was also an ordained priest, and Criech was to remain his only benefice until his death in 1437. He had earlier been styled <i>dominus</i> (April 1393), &#145;cleric of St Andrews diocese&#146; (October 1394), and by August 1403 had done everything needed to take up a benefice, with or without cure. He is not to be confounded with a namesake who became abbot of the Cistercian house of Culross, who outlived him by some years.<br>
<br>Two strands stand out in Lindores's work in Scotland: his distinguished part in the foundation of St Andrews University, and his career as inquisitor-general. Named first among the university's first teachers&#151;he was the only theologian listed&#151;he lectured for a time on the four books of <span class="italic">Sentences</span>, but taught regularly in arts, as his status as examiner implied. He was rector twice: at the beginning, and in the crucial town-and-gown delegation which persuaded James I to confirm the university's privileges, and abandon the project of transferring it to Perth. He was more often dean of arts, consciously strengthening the relatively powerful faculty both in symbols of status, and in its possessions. Master for life of the college of St John from 1418, he became in addition principal of the faculty's pedagogy (regulated hall), which was founded on an adjacent site in 1430, and ran them increasingly as one institution, formally recognized as the faculty's possession on Lawrence's death.<br>
<br>The &#145;Roman&#146; inquisition operated for at least some sixty years in Scotland. Lindores was not the only inquisitor-general recorded, but he was the first, acting under Avignon and post-schismatic papal jurisdictions successively from 1408 until his death. Two trials ended in burning. At Perth in 1408 one James Resby, an English Wycliffite priest (and arguably not, <i>pace</i> some, a Franciscan) was burnt. The inquisitor's arguments against two of the forty or more tenets found objectionable were recorded by the chronicler Walter Bower (<i>d</i>. 1449). They are commonplace enough, but show that the inquisitor was taking Resby not as a simple enthusiast, but as someone who had been arguing a case (on papal authority) that would have to be met. The second burning, at St Andrews on 23 July 1433, was that of Pavel Kravar, who is now thought to have been a Bohemian (as Knox indeed said), rather than from Krava&#345;e in Silesia. An academic turned Hussite propagandist, Kravar had used a medical cover in Poland, and was apparently set to do the same in Scotland, to win support for the Hussite cause at the Council of Basel. Against a third accused, the Franciscan Robert Harding, Lindores showed himself reluctant to act. Harding, an English theologian, had been invited by the duke of Albany (<i>d</i>. 1420), regent of Scotland during the captivity of James I, to put the case against the measures taken by the Council of Constance to end the papal schism. Arguing on broadly conciliarist lines, Harding was vigorously opposed by Scottish churchmen, who also pressed Lindores to act. Despite further pressure from Martin V (<i>r</i>. 1417&#150;31) too, Lindores delayed still, and Harding died a natural death in 1419. The Avignon pope Benedict XIII (<i>r</i>. 1394&#150;1417) under whose jurisdiction the inquisitor had earlier worked, was still alive, and Lindores (who had been significantly absent from crucial steps in transferring allegiance) is not recorded as acting again as inquisitor until after the deaths of both Benedict and Martin V. The two remaining cases known ended in recantations at an early stage. John Fogo, abbot of Melrose, one of those who had pressed Lindores to act against Harding, later exposed himself to the inquisition through loosely stated views on oath-bound obligations. Summoned to St Andrews, Fogo recanted. In 1435 one Robert Gardiner extolled canon law and disparaged arts in a lecture to St Andrews canonists. Before a significantly solemn assembly (27 October) Gardiner recanted the propositions that had been found objectionable.<br>
<br>From Lindores's arts teaching at Paris come the surviving commentaries on Aristotle's <span class="italic">Physics</span> and <span class="italic">De anima</span> which migrated with &#145;Parisian&#146; nominalism itself to Prague (by 1406), Cracow, Leipzig, Erfurt, Vienna, Freiburg, and elsewhere, and kept his name alive among philosophers for over a century. A commentary on the <span class="italic">Perihermeneias</span> was last recorded in sixteenth-century Alcal&aacute;, and a <span class="italic">De caelo</span> commentary and a question <span class="italic">De reflexionibus</span> have also been attributed to him. No theological works are known to survive, though he did lecture on Peter Lombard's <span class="italic">Sentences</span> at St Andrews. Later attributions of works in canon law are more dubious.<br>
<br>What of the thought in the surviving works? By the time of Lindores, nominalists were concerned to show in detail how the abstract terms needed in a scientific language could be grounded in a world of concrete particulars, and without appeal to the abstract entities of some earlier metaphysicians. Thus in Aristotelian psychology (<i>scientia de anima</i>) Lindores set himself to explain how the term <i>anima</i>, taken as connoting a capacity for certain observable, vital operations, might be made sense of in relation to the operations: much as dispositional terms generally (for example &#145;soluble&#146;, &#145;fragile&#146;) have to be made sense of, he appears to have thought. This may not be particularly easy for a nominalist of Lawrence's stripe, and how far his programme succeeds either in this, or in his treatment of impetus in physics (which attracted some attention, but no known followers), or in his treatment of universals generally, cannot yet be safely assessed.<br>
<br>Little is known of Lindores's family, and even his name need not tie him to Lindores, or to its abbey. The most intimate insight into the man comes from a charter of 1434, founding a chaplaincy in the parish church of St Andrews to celebrate mass &#145;for the salvation of the souls of &hellip; the present bishop of St Andrews, of my father and mother; also for the salvation of my own soul, and of the souls of my brothers and sisters and benefactors &hellip; living or dead &hellip; and of all the faithful&#146;  (Fleming, 578&#150;87). No children are known, and no suggestion of interest in the romantic or the prurient was made in his lifetime. The chaplaincy was fulfilled into Reformation times, monitored by the provost and council.<br>
<br>Poor enough in Paris, Lindores passed for a man of property in St Andrews: he put up the money, jointly with the earl of Douglas, for the faculty's mace, and owned houses in fashionable South Street. Named material beneficiaries of the chaplaincy were the bishop of St Andrews (10<i>s</i>. annually), the abbot and convent of Balmerino (10<i>s</i>.), the (Augustinian) &#145;monastery of St Andrews&#146; (2<i>s</i>.), and Agnes Fryslae and her heirs (6<i>s</i>.).<br>
<br>Lindores's inquisitorial work was followed by a couple of generations of (perhaps merely specious) calm. At St Andrews his institutions endured, and in the Scottish universities generally it became something of a custom for theologians to teach in arts, as John Mair (<i>d</i>. 1550) was to note. But from the complexities made easier to appreciate by the publication of the arts faculty's <i>acta</i>, he should not&#151;in view of his opportunities&#151;be ascribed quite such a masterful personality, or quite the dominance in the university, that historians used sometimes to attribute to him. And his management of people left recurring conflicts, independently of the waning of nominalism at St Andrews, which in any case came neither from intellectual revolution nor active suppression (or release), but rather because academic contacts proved easier with realist-favouring Louvain and Cologne, than with the nominalist-favouring universities of central Europe. His natural philosophy, apparently unavailable at Paris when George Lokert (<i>d</i>. 1547) and others were printing nominalist texts there in the early sixteenth century, fell into oblivion, until Michalski and other Polish scholars reported on it from the 1920s. Editions of the <span class="italic">Physics</span> and <span class="italic">De anima</span> commentaries are in progress, but a systematic and comprehensive exposition of his thought is not yet available.<br>
<br>Neither the place of Lindores's death nor that of his burial is known, but the arts masters' haste to secure his muniments and assume his funeral costs&#151;before the theology faculty could be formally constituted (and hence succeed to the college of St John)&#151;makes the early hours of 16 September 1437, in or near St Andrews, the likeliest time and place of his death.<br>
