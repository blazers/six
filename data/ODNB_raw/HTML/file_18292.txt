<span class="headword">Mason,  William</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1719?), <span class="occ">stenographer and writing-master</span>, is of unknown origins. He wrote that from his youth he &#145;delighted in the Art of Short-Hand&#146;  (W. Mason, <span class="italic">La plume volante</span>, 1707, &#145;To the reader&#146;). In 1736 it was noted, &#145;As for Mr. Mason he has obtained a very great Reputation in the world (and that deservedly) as a short-hand writer&#146;  (Gibbs, 51). Mason's shorthand system may be described as a perpetual work-in-progress. For a half century he taught and made radical modifications to his system, which was originally based, as Mason acknowledged, on that of Jeremiah Rich (more accurately called the William Cartwright&#150;Jeremiah Rich system).<br>
<br>In 1672, &#145;to delight the Ingenious, and to encourage the Industrious&#146;, Mason published his first shorthand treatise, <span class="italic">A Pen Pluck'd from an Eagles Wing</span>. The alphabet contained nineteen of Rich's characters; by contrast, the alphabet of his second treatise, <span class="italic">Arts Advancement</span> (1682), contained only six. Elaborately engraved, <span class="italic">Arts Advancement</span>, which sold for only a shilling, had ornamental borders with a bird's feather and quill pen motif and a handsome oval portrait of Mason by Benjamin Rhodes. Both works were among the shorthand books in the library of Samuel Pepys. Even fewer echoes of Rich's system were found in Mason's last and most influential treatise, <span class="italic">La plume volante</span> (1707), from which he had taught in manuscript from about 1692. All three versions of Mason's system had subsequent editions, and Mason also published broadsheet learning aids to accompany his texts. <span class="italic">La plume volante</span> also offers an insight into Mason's personal life, of which few details were known until recent research. The volume includes a poem, &#145;To William Mason on his Excellent Short-hand&#146;, by Joseph Stennett, who was from 1690 pastor of the Pinner's Hall Seventh Day Baptist church in Old Broad Street, London. <span class="italic">La plume volante</span> also includes Mason's definition &#145;Seventh day (is the) sabbath&#146;, which indicates that he too was a Seventh Day Baptist. Record books for Pinner's Hall (1686) refer to a William and Jane Mason (the only Masons listed in the books), and entries for 1689 identify Jane as Mason's wife. This Jane, who appears to have been the stenographer's wife, died on 27 January 1718, when she and William Mason were resident in Lombard Street, All Hallows parish. Mason is mentioned frequently in the Pinner Hall records and it may be that he was the William Mason arrested with twenty-six fellow sabbatarians at the Bell Lane church in 1671. B. S. Capp, for one, has suggested that the Mason arrested at Bell Lane (and then described as an upholsterer) was the person who appears in the Pinner Hall records.<br>
<br>A self-described teacher of &#145;Fair-Writing, Arithmetick, Merchants Accompts, and Short-Hand&#146;  (<span class="italic">Aurea clavis</span>, 1695, &#145;Advertisement&#146;), Mason was also &#145;very famous, in writing many things in a little Compass&#146;  (Turner, pt 3, chap. 13, p. 26), a reference to his skill in miniature writing. Indeed, John Bagford claimed that he &#145;graved in the Compass of an Heart the number of Letters, words, Chapters and verses in the <span class="roman">Bible</span>&#146;  (Heal, 73). In <span class="italic">Arts Advancement</span> Mason announced his intention to engrave and print the entire <span class="roman">Bible</span> in &#145;Character&#146; (i.e. shorthand&#151;a task evidently never completed) and also wrote a collection of aphorisms. His name appeared among the recommenders of the 1678 and 1700 editions of Edward Cocker's <span class="italic">Cocker's Arithmetick</span>.<br>
<br>In the tradition of the great seventeenth-century writing-masters, Mason was a keen advertiser and promoter of both his personal qualifications and his very moderately priced books. A successful teacher who emphasized his many years' experience, Mason boarded pupils and advertised that he would instruct students at convenient hours in their own houses. On 27 August 1700 the <span class="italic">Post Man</span> announced the removal of Mr Mason's academy the Hand and Pen (previously in Prince's Court, Lothbury, and in Talbot Court and Bell Yard off Gracechurch Street) to Scalding Alley &#145;over against Stocks Market&#146; near the Royal Exchange. As late as 1716, Mason advertised his services:<blockquote>William Mason, designs to teach [shorthand] twice a Week at his very next Door, being Leaden-Hall Coffee House in Leaden-Hall Street, where is a Room for that Purpose, called the Stenographical Club Room, to teach in [<i>sic</i>] Monday and Thursday Evenings, for two Hours together, at such Times as all may agree to, for One Shilling a Week &hellip; where all will receive ample Satisfaction. (<span class="italic">Monthly Catalogue</span>, November 1716)</blockquote>In the previous year the Pinner Hall record books recorded that William Mason (most probably the stenographer) had held a meeting for the church at his house. Membership lists for the church also show that this William Mason died on 3 September 1719 in Carolina  (Glass, 264). The likelihood that Mason died in this year, and was the person listed in the Pinner Hall records, is strengthened by the fact that by 1719 his pupil Joseph Smith was the instructor at the Hand and Pen.<br>
<br>Mason's <span class="italic">La plume volante</span> &#145;shaped the destiny of shorthand reporting&#146;  (Butler, 40), for it was adapted and published by Thomas Gurney, official shorthand writer to the Old Bailey  (T. Gurney, <span class="italic">Brachygraphy</span>, 1750; eighteen editions by 1884), who maintained what amounted to a rigid copyright. Through the medium of Gurney and his stenographic family, Mason's system profoundly influenced the use and status of shorthand in the eighteenth-century law courts and continued in use well into the nineteenth century. The &#145;secret diaries&#146; of William Byrd of Westover, Virginia, who may have studied with Mason while Byrd was a student in London, are written in Mason's system. Mason is now generally regarded as one of the greatest stenographers of the seventeenth century.<br>
