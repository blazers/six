<span class="headword">Taylor,  Henry</span>  (1711&#150;1785), <span class="occ">religious controversialist</span>, was born at South Weald, Essex, in May 1711 and baptized there on 17 June 1711, the second son of William Taylor (1673&#150;1750), and his wife, Anne Crisp (1680&#150;1739), daughter of Edward and Ann Crisp. His father was a London merchant with property in Essex and enjoyed some reputation as a wit. Taylor was sent to school in Hackney, where John Hoadly, the youngest son of Benjamin Hoadly, was a contemporary, and from there he matriculated at Queens' College, Cambridge, in 1729. He took his BA in 1731, and was elected a fellow in 1734 before proceeding MA the next year.<br>
<br>Taylor was ordained deacon in 1733, then priest in 1735 by the bishop of Winchester, Benjamin Hoadly, &#145;that great defender of civil &amp; religious liberty&#146;, and his major patron  (H. Taylor to the third duke of Richmond, 3 Oct 1774, CUL Add. MS 7901/4/14). In 1736 he became curate of Rivenhall, Essex, and in 1737 he was instituted to the rectory of Wheatfield, Oxfordshire, which he held for a minor. On 16 June 1740 he married Christian (Kitty) Fox (<i>bap</i>. 1715, <i>d</i>. 1769), fourth daughter of the Revd Francis Fox, vicar of St Mary's, Reading, and his wife, Susannah. Her fortune relieved his indebtedness and they had a family of eight surviving children. Taylor was meanwhile enhancing his preferment. On 1 February 1744 Hoadly collated him to the rectory of Baughurst, Hampshire, which he held with Wheatfield. On 12 December 1745 he was instituted to the vicarage of Portsmouth by Winchester College and thereupon resigned Baughurst. In 1748 he was appointed chaplain to James Dalrymple, third earl of Stair. On 3 August 1753 he was collated to the rectory of Ovington, also in the bishop's gift, resigning Wheatfield. In early 1755 he was instituted to the rectory of Crawley with the chapel of Hunton, Hampshire, which he held with Portsmouth, resigning Ovington. From this date Crawley became his main residence and he employed curates at Portsmouth parish church.<br>
<br>Unlike his patron Bishop Hoadly, Taylor openly espoused the restrained Arianism of Samuel Clarke, and this held him back from the highest offices, especially after he went a step further and embraced the Apollinarian heresy which questioned the human nature of Christ's person. This he did in a series of letters addressed to Elisha Levi (1771&#150;7) purporting to be the &#145;apology&#146; of Benjamin Ben Mordecai for embracing Christianity. Though anonymous, the work was known as Taylor's, and was so acknowledged in the second enlarged edition of 1784. It abounds in learning and argument, but is very discursive. In 1772 Taylor was one of the clergy petitioning for relief from subscription; Mrs Taylor's nephew, Francis Stone, was chairman of the Feathers tavern petitioners. He was disappointed by the unsuccessful outcome, as would be expected from one who habitually omitted the Athanasian creed in his services. &#145;How&#146;, he complained of his Winchester colleague, Archdeacon Thomas Balguy, &#145;can a man have the face to tell us, that the doctrine of three coequal persons is plainly revealed in scripture?&#146;  (H. Taylor to Mrs Jebb, CUL Add. MS 7901/3/9, n.d., <i>c</i>.1774). His <span class="italic">Considerations on Ancient and Modern Creeds</span> appeared posthumously in 1788, edited by his son William.<br>
<br>Taylor was an ambitious controversialist who used a number of pseudonyms. He appeared as Indignatio in a tract directed against Bishop William Warburton called <span class="italic">Confusion Worse Confounded</span> (1772), and as Khalid E'bn Abdallah with <span class="italic">An Enquiry into the Opinions of the Learned Christians</span> (1777). In that year he engaged anonymously against Soane Jenyns with his <span class="italic">A Full Answer to a &hellip; Late View of the Internal Evidence of Christian Religion</span>, and then replied to Gibbon (within a broad millenary context) on his five causes favouring the progress of Christianity in <span class="italic">Thoughts on the Nature of the Grand Apostacy, with Reflections on &hellip; Gibbon's History</span> (1781). In this, as in most of Taylor's writings, there was a sharp anti-Roman Catholic flavour. He published <span class="italic">Farther Thoughts on the Nature of the Grand Apostacy of the Christian Churches</span> two years later. Here, <i>inter alia</i>, he contended that the <span class="roman">Bible</span> was the unique test of faith and not made-up articles of human framing. Taylor was an entertaining, sometimes idiosyncratic letter writer who inherited his father's wit and epigrammatic skills. His verses on marriage, &#145;Paradise Regain'd&#146;, are in Dodsley's <span class="italic">Collection of Poems by Several Hands</span> (1758, 6.126). In politics, he was staunchly whig and an opponent of the American War of Independence. The Cambridge antiquary William Cole called him &#145;a cheerful, lively, and sensible little man, very thin, and of no promising appearance&#146;  (Nichols, <span class="italic">Lit. anecdotes</span>, 8.428).<br>
<br>Taylor was respected as a controversialist, but inclined to prolixity. He was a copious correspondent and on good terms with non-Anglican Arians such as Richard Price. He died at Titchfield, Hampshire, on 27 April 1785 (the residence of his son, the Revd Peter Taylor), and was buried on 3 May in the chancel of Crawley church. His wife had died earlier, on 23 July 1769.<br>
