<span class="headword">Foggon,  George</span>  (1913&#150;2006), <span class="occ">civil servant and industrial relations adviser</span>, was born at 88 Station Lane, Hebburn, co. Durham, on 13 September 1913, the elder son and eldest of five children of Thomas Foggon (1891&#150;1965), copperworks labourer, and later laboratory technician, and his wife, Margaret Burn, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Martin (1892/3&#150;1957). He attended Hebburn colliery board school, from where, in 1924, he gained a scholarship to Jarrow grammar school. Entering the civil service at 16, he began his working life as a clerk in the Ministry of Labour at Felling labour exchange, Gateshead, in 1930. The 1930s were his formative years. He saw the Jarrow marchers, and he dealt daily with large numbers of the unemployed. This experience imbued him with great compassion, kindness, and a sense of fairness. He had already inherited a marked desire for knowledge and improvement. He read widely and developed an interest in modern history. His regional controller where he began his working life was Jameson Adams, who had been with Sir Ernest Shackleton in 1908 on his historic journey to within 97 miles of the south pole. This sparked such an interest in Foggon that he studied in great detail all of Shackleton's expeditions and he later regaled his friends with his knowledge of this topic, with infectious enthusiasm. On 25 June 1938, at the church of St John the Evangelist, Hebburn, he married Agnes McIntosh (1912&#150;1968), daughter of James Robert McIntosh, carpenter. They had one son, Miles (<i>b</i>. 1951).<br>
<br>Following the outbreak of the Second World War, in 1940 Foggon volunteered for the Royal Air Force and trained as an armourer. Commissioned in 1943, he led the RAF armaments team at the Normandy landings, finding himself among the first members of the RAF to go ashore after D-day. In the course of following the armies from Normandy to Berlin he rose in rank to wing commander. He was appointed MBE in 1945. Shortly after hostilities ceased he was seconded to the Foreign Office to work on the staff of the British military government in Berlin, as an adviser for labour affairs. In this capacity he assisted in the restoration of German social structures in West Berlin and contributed to the efforts of the Allied Control Commission in the re-establishment of the West German trade unions and employers' organizations. He was promoted OBE in 1949.<br>
<br>Later in 1949 Foggon entered the Colonial Office as a principal. After two years' service in London he was promoted to assistant secretary and appointed to the West African Inter-Territorial Secretariat, based in the Gold Coast. In 1952 he became commissioner for labour in Nigeria. During his service in Africa he argued for the establishment of properly democratic trade unions and employer organizations as well as governmental and legal institutions to support social and labour affairs. His pleasant personality and fairness towards all sides gained the trust of many leading African politicians, trade unionists, and employers. He did much then and later in pursuit of these essentials and, in doing so, contributed greatly to limiting Soviet and later Chinese influences, which were intruding into this facet of developing countries.<br>
<br>In 1958 Foggon was brought back to London as labour adviser to the secretary of state for the colonies. In 1961 he was appointed CMG. In 1962, when most of the colonies began to move towards independence, he became a member of the Secretariat for Technical Co-operation. In 1965 his appointment was transferred to the Ministry of Overseas Development. By then he was emerging as a considerable expert in all matters of international labour affairs and industrial relations legislation. He was clearly one of the most appropriately qualified civil servants when appointed, in 1966, to the post of overseas labour adviser to the Foreign Office, in which post he remained until his retirement from the civil service in 1976. He established close working relationships with the Trades Union Congress and the Confederation of British Industry, particularly with their international departments. He pressed for the secondment to his office of representatives of both bodies, and, until the election of the Conservative government of Margaret Thatcher, TUC officers were attached to the overseas labour adviser's office of what was now the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. Meanwhile Foggon strove, with the help of a diminishing number of Labour attach&eacute;s, to ensure that his knowledge of international labour problems was accurate and up to date. In one year he covered 100,000 miles, with visits to Egypt, Turkey, Iran, and Sri Lanka. In the same year he went to advise on the resolution of a general strike in the Gilbert Islands. Such journeys gave him much enjoyment as well as hard work, and provided him with a fund of stories always told with masterly detail and with kindly humour. His great strength was his ability to make the acquaintance of a wide mix of people and to see which of them were, or would become, key figures.<br>
<br>Such was now his standing, internationally as well as in the UK, that Foggon had already been invited by the International Labour Office in Geneva to head their London office. He took up this new task on retirement from the British civil service and served until his ultimate retirement in 1982. All those with whom he worked, then as before, liked him, sought his advice, and enjoyed his company. His great knowledge and efficiency, his charm, kindness, generosity, humour, and dedication all contributed to his popularity.<br>
<br>Following the death of his first wife, on 30 August 1969 Foggon married Audrey Clarissa (1932&#150;2002), the daughter of Joseph William Blanch, diplomat. There were no children of the marriage. They lived for most of Foggon's retirement in Pimlico, which provided easy access to his office and his clubs. He had long been a member of the Athenaeum and the Oriental Club, and his joy was to entertain his many friends to long and informative lunches in these venues. In 2000 he and Audrey moved to 3 Castle Hill House (the former Wylam Manor), in Wylam, Northumberland, where they bought an additional guest apartment to accommodate their visitors. Foggon died, at Castle Hill House, on 18 February 2006, of prostate cancer. He was cremated at Newcastle crematorium on 25 February and his ashes were later buried in Hebburn cemetery. He was survived by his son, Miles.<br>
