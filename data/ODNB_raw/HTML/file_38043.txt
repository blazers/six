<span class="headword">Swire,  John Kidston <span class="st"> [Jock]</span></span>  (1893&#150;1983), <span class="occ">businessman</span>, was born on 19 February 1893 in Kensingston Court, London, the elder son and second of four children of John Swire of Hillingdon House, Harlow, Essex, and his wife, Emily Kidston; he was the grandson of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/39475/', "John Samuel Swire (1825&#150;1898)")</script>, who moved the emphasis of the family's trading business from Liverpool to the Far East in the mid-1800s. Of Scottish descent, Jock Swire was educated at Eton College (1906&#150;10) and University College, Oxford (1910&#150;13), where he obtained a third class in jurisprudence.<br>
<br>Swire joined the family business, John Swire &amp; Sons, in 1913, arriving in Hong Kong just before the First World War broke out. Having been commissioned in the Oxford University officer training corps cavalry in 1912 and transferred to the Essex yeomanry in 1913, he served in the war with his regiment in France, rising to the rank of major. He was twice wounded and twice recommended for decorations; he remained partially deaf for the rest of his life. In 1920 Swire became the London-based director in charge of the company's overseas staff, and thereafter in a series of long, energetic, and often dangerous tours&#151;the civil war in China was at its height&#151;he regularly explored every nook and cranny of the company's Far Eastern empire. One of the suggestions, revolutionary at the time, which Swire put to his board in London, was that female clerks should work on an equal footing with men, and for the same pay; another was that Swire recruits earmarked for Eastern posts should be university graduates, and should also learn Chinese. His was also an important voice, together with that of his uncle <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/39473/', "G. Warren Swire (1883&#150;1949)")</script>, in arguing that Chinese nationalism had to be accommodated by British firms, and that companies like Swires had, in effect, to &#145;Sinify&#146; themselves, if they were to survive. On 18 July 1923 Swire married Juliet Richenda (1901&#150;1981), daughter of Theodore Barclay, a Hertford stockbroker; they had two daughters and two sons.<br>
<br>In the Second World War, when German bombing destroyed the Swire head office in the City, Swire moved his entire staff to his mother's house in Harlow. He was high sheriff of Essex, 1941&#150;2. As chairman of the port employers in London (1941&#150;5), Swire was involved in organizing the loading of the myriad vessels needed to carry troops and stores for the invasion of Europe. Fortunately he had become friendly in the 1930s with Ernest Bevin, then a dock-union leader. Once, after a long negotiation, Swire invited Bevin for a drink and a sandwich at the City of London Club, where the chairman reprimanded him for having brought a working man into the club. Swire was delighted when Bevin subsequently became wartime minister of labour.<br>
<br>In 1946 Swire became chairman of the group, and he directed its operations until 1966. He succeeded his uncle, G. W. Swire, with whom he had seriously disagreed over the firm's direction. His finest hours came after VJ-day. His contribution, as chairman of John Swire &amp; Sons, to the rebuilding of Hong Kong was inestimable. The colony had been devastated during the Japanese occupation. Swires' Taikoo dockyard was in ruins, Swires' ships sunk or dispersed. Hong Kong's great harbour, full of sunken vessels, was stagnant; the docks were at a standstill; so was public transport. Thanks to Swire's optimism, foresight, and dogged determination, the firm's operations were restored. The joint efforts of Swires, Jardine Matheson, and the Hongkong and Shanghai Bank (which provided unstinting financial support) enabled Hong Kong to rise from its rubble, and provided the foundations on which Chinese and foreign enterprise made it one of the commercial successes of the Eastern world. Swire was chairman of the China Association from 1951 to 1955.<br>
<br>Swire's other triumph was his creation of a worldwide airline. Before 1939 John Swire &amp; Sons had tinkered with the idea: its large interests on passenger shipping made this a logical step forward. By 1947 it was obvious to John Swire that long-distance travel in the East, as elsewhere, would be by passenger aircraft. Despite the misgivings of his more conservative directors, he induced his company to acquire a small Hong Kong-based airline, Cathay Pacific Airways, recently founded by two wartime fliers. Though somewhat ramshackle, the airline had proved successful. Swire intended to develop a top-class regional airline serving cities in the East and Australia. With the jet age, however, Cathay was obliged to expand. Before he died in 1983, Swire, then honorary president of the company, had the exhilarating experience of watching one of his Cathay Pacific aircraft landing at Gatwick airport, the first of innumerable scheduled passenger flights from and to Hong Kong by the airline he had built up as an international enterprise.<br>
<br>Swire was very tall and good-looking, had a zest for life, and was a good horseman. He was warm, gregarious, crotchety, and humorous. His wife predeceased him in 1981; and he died on 22 February 1983 at his home, Hubbards Hall, Churchgate Street, Old Harlow, Essex. He was buried at St Mary's, Harlow, on 28 February.<br>
