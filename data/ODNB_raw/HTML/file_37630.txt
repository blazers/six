<span class="headword">Kempe,  Harry Robert</span>  (1852&#150;1935), <span class="occ">electrical engineer and journal editor</span>, was born at 12 Addison Terrace, Kensington, London, on 1 March 1852. He was the youngest in the family of four sons and one daughter of the Revd John Edward Kempe, later rector of St James's, Piccadilly (1853&#150;95), prebendary of St Paul's, and chaplain-in-ordinary to Queen Victoria (1864&#150;1901), and his wife, Harriet, daughter of the Revd R. Wood, of Osmington House, Dorset. One of his older brothers was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/37628/', "Alfred Bray Kempe")</script>, an ecclesiastical lawyer. He was educated at Westminster School (1865&#150;7) and at King's College, London (1867&#150;70), where he studied applied science, but took no degree. His autobiographical reminiscences mention two years spent in the laboratory of Sir Charles Wheatstone. He worked for three years with Sir Samuel Canning, engineer-in-chief of the Telegraph Construction and Maintenance Company, and was involved with the laying of the Malta&#150;Gibraltar cable in 1870. He also had a working association with the civil engineer Robert Sabine, one of the pioneers of transatlantic telegraphy.<br>
<br>Kempe moved to Southampton to work with William H. Preece, divisional engineer in the postal telegraph department, on 1 April 1872. Preece was appointed electrician to the postmaster-general in 1877 and Kempe was subsequently transferred to London on 2 March 1878 to act as his assistant. On 8 July 1880 he married Helen Catherine (<i>d</i>. 1932), daughter of Major-General Byng of the Madras light infantry. They had one daughter.<br>
<br>During the 1890s Kempe worked on inductive telegraphy, which was particularly important for communication with lighthouses and lightships. He was responsible for many telegraph and telephone services used by the Post Office (including sending keys, and postal pneumatic extensions) and his design of the Dover&#150;Calais cable for the London&#150;Paris telephone was an acknowledged success. He succeeded Preece, becoming principal technical officer on 15 March 1900 and electrician on 1 August 1907, a position from which he retired in 1913. During the First World War he was examiner to the inventions committee of the Air Ministry.<br>
<br>While still living with his family in London in 1871, he was among the first associate members of the newly formed Society of Telegraph Engineers (later the Institution of Electrical Engineers). From 1872 onwards he contributed student articles to the <span class="italic">Telegraphic Journal</span>, which later became the <span class="italic">Electrical Review</span>. He became the editor and one of the proprietors, retaining full control of the journal until 1931. His major written works include <span class="italic">A Handbook of Electrical Testing</span> (1876), <span class="italic">Alternating Currents</span> (1916), <span class="italic">The Electrical Engineers' Pocket-Book</span> (1890), and a contribution on telephony and telegraphy for the eleventh edition of the <span class="italic">Encyclopaedia Britannica</span>. His <span class="italic">Engineer's Year-Book</span>, first produced with W. Hannaford-Smith, was a major achievement and a project which he steered for thirty-six years.<br>
<br>Kempe lived for many years at Lavethan, Brockham, Betchworth, Surrey, and died there on 10 April 1935. He was buried on 15 April 1935 at Brockham church.<br>
