<span class="headword">Walsh,  Richard Hussey</span>  (1825&#150;1862), <span class="occ">economist</span>, born at Kilduff, Tyrrellspass, King's county, and baptized at Philipstown (now Daingean) Roman Catholic Church in King's county on 3 August 1825, was the fifth son of John Hussey Walsh of Kilduff and his wife, Maria, daughter of Michael Henley of La Mancha, co. Dublin. His grandmother Margaret was the daughter and heir of John Hussey of Mull Hussey, Roscommon. After being educated by private tutors, in 1842 Walsh entered Trinity College, Dublin, where he graduated BA in 1847, taking the highest honours in mathematics and physics. In the next year he obtained the senior mathematical prize founded by John Law, bishop of Elphin. On 5 May 1848 he was admitted a student of Lincoln's Inn, but he soon abandoned the study of law.<br>
<br>As a Roman Catholic, Walsh was precluded from reading for a fellowship at Trinity College, and in consequence turned his attention to the study of political economy, with the intention of competing for the Whately professorship. At the prize examination in the subject in 1850 he obtained the first place and in the same year was appointed to one of the Barrington lectureships in political economy administered by the Dublin Statistical Society (later renamed the Statistical and Social Inquiry Society of Ireland). In 1851 he was elected one of the honorary secretaries of this society and was also appointed Whately professor on the results of the examination held in that year.<br>
<br>In 1853 Walsh published one of the courses of lectures he gave as professor, under the title <span class="italic">An Elementary Treatise on Metallic Currency</span>. The book was unusual for its time in attempting to set out fully the state of knowledge in this branch of political economy. It contained some perceptive comments on the likely effect of recent gold discoveries on price levels when monometallic or bimetallic standards were in use and was favourably received by Nassau Senior and J. S. Mill but was more notable for its lucidity and completeness than for its originality. Walsh also contributed papers to the <span class="italic">Proceedings of the Dublin Statistical Society</span>, the statistical section of the British Association, and <span class="italic">The Economist</span>. Between 1848 and 1855 he also wrote elementary school books on political and domestic economy for the series of <span class="roman">Education Lessons</span> edited by Edward Hughes.<br>
<br>In the winter of 1853 Walsh acted temporarily as deputy for the professor of jurisprudence and political economy at Queen's College, Belfast, but when his term of office in the Whately chair ended in 1856, he took up a government post, under W. Neilson Hancock, as assistant secretary to the endowed schools (Ireland) commission. Because of the ability he displayed in this capacity, he was recommended for appointment as superintendent of the government schools in Mauritius, and entered on his duties in May 1857. These combined the responsibilities that in England were divided between commissioners, secretaries, and inspectors. He established new schools, and before he had been in office twenty months he increased their number from twenty to forty-four. His energy attracted the notice of the governor, William Stevenson, who placed him on a civil service commission nominated to inquire into the organization of the twenty-two civil service departments into which the island was divided. The work occupied nearly two years, and the results were highly approved by the duke of Newcastle, the colonial secretary  (<span class="italic">Mauritius Gazette</span>, 5 Oct 1861). Walsh was also entrusted with the conduct of the census of the island taken in 1861 and had just completed it when he suffered a brain haemorrhage. Four days later he died, unmarried, at Port Louis on 30 January 1862.<br>
