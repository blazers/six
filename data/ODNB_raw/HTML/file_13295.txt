<span class="headword">Hill,  Roger</span>  (1605&#150;1667), <span class="occ">lawyer</span>, was born on 1 December 1605 at Colyton, Devon, the second of nine children and eldest son of William Hill (<i>d</i>. 1642) of Poundisford, Somerset, and Jane (<i>b</i>. 1584), daughter of John Yonge of Colyton. The family had prospered as merchants in Taunton and tenants on the bishop of Winchester's estate, showing an interest in parliament exceptional for minor gentry and contracting useful matches with several Dorset families of similar status. Hill was admitted to the Inner Temple, London, in 1624 and called to the bar in 1632. On 10 December 1635 he married Katherine, daughter of Giles Greene of Corfe Castle, Dorset. After bearing a son and a daughter, she died, and was buried on 30 November 1638.<br>
<br>It was probably this connection that brought Hill the recordership of Bridport, which he represented throughout the Long Parliament. He served on more than sixty committees, showing particular interest in religious and legal issues. A zealous presbyterian, he was outspoken in his attacks on the hierarchy, especially Archbishop William Laud. On 3 August 1641 he married Abigail, daughter of Brampton Gurdon of Assington, Suffolk. Said to be of no considerable estate, he nevertheless promised &pound;100 for the defence of parliament. He attended the second marriage of Denzil Holles, having earned 20 guineas for drafting the settlement. But he soon moved to the left in politics, though not in religion, probably under the influence of two other Dorset borough members, John Pyne, leader of the Somerset radicals, and Edmond Prideaux, in whose coach he usually commuted to Westminster. An uxorious husband, he sat up past midnight, sometimes &#145;after a dozen houres attending at the House&#146;  (BL, Add. 46500, fol. 24), to write letters to his wife in the country, combining assurances of affection with spiritual counsel. He was added to the Somerset committee in 1644, and at the sale of episcopal lands he bought the great manor of Taunton Dean, which he improved by enclosure. He was horrified to discover that one of his cousins was growing into strange opinions smacking of Independency and antinomianism, and urged Pyne to promote a petition for the establishment of presbyterianism, and for strong measures against cavaliers and malignants. But when Holles's supporters in the City invaded parliament on 22 July 1647 Hill and Prideaux were among the MPs who fled to the army for protection.<br>
<br>Hill was named to the high court of justice to try Charles I, but did not act, and delayed taking his seat in the Rump until 23 February 1649. On 18 May he acted as teller for the bill to establish a court for probate and marriage cases, and although he co-operated with the promoter of the conveyancing bill, he seldom attended later sessions. Hill assisted Prideaux in preparing the case against John Lilburne and the Levellers, and became a bencher in the following month. He was less of a doctrinaire republican than Pyne, with whom his relations began to deteriorate in 1650.<br>
<br>After the establishment of the protectorate Hill again assisted Prideaux in the trial of John Penruddock and the royalists, steering a cautiously legal course. He was rewarded with the dignity of the coif, and became baron of the exchequer in 1657, performing the usual duties of holding assizes on circuit and carrying messages to the Commons from the upper house. Hill's second wife died on 31 December 1658, and was buried with three of their four children in the Temple Church. On the fall of the protectorate he resumed his seat in the Rump, keeping a cursory diary of its proceedings. He must have welcomed the overthrow of the military junto that supplanted it, being promoted to the upper bench in January 1660. Hill lost office at the Restoration, though he insisted on retaining the style of serjeant-at-law. He had to give up Taunton Dean; but unlike Pyne he was not excluded from the <span class="roman">Act of Indemnity</span>.<br>
<br>On 1 May 1662 Hill married another Abigail, the daughter of Thomas Barnes of Alborough Hatch, Essex, coheir to her brother James and widow of John Lockey of Holmes Hill, Hertfordshire, and of the quondam radical Joshua Berners of Clerkenwell, Middlesex, over whom she is said to have exercised a moderating influence. Hill's lengthy will, which he signed on 9 March 1665, begins with an old-fashioned assurance of sharing in the resurrection of the just. He enjoyed substantial liquid assets, including &pound;4000 advanced on mortgage to Lord Arundell of Wardour and &pound;1424 to a Herefordshire squire. In addition he had &pound;3000 for which he had failed to find a high-yielding investment. The sum of &pound;200 was set aside for distribution to twenty of the industrious poor who &#145;truly love and feare the Lord&#146;  (TNA: PRO, PROB 11/323, fol. 347<i>v</i>). Hill died in London on 21 April 1667, leaving instructions for the avoidance of &#145;any vaine Pompe or Ceremony att all&#146; at his funeral  (ibid., 11/323, fol. 344). He was buried two days later with his second wife in the Temple Church. His widow, with whom he had no children, survived until 24 November 1713.<br>
<br>Hill was clearly a workaholic. To judge from the prolixity of his letters and his will, his legal opinions may have been expensive, but satisfying to those clients who wanted even the unlikeliest contingencies covered. He had laid the foundations for the social promotion of his younger son, Roger, who swiftly acquired a knighthood, a freehold estate in Buckinghamshire, and a county seat in parliament.<br>
