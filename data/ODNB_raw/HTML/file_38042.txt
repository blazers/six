<span class="headword">Swindin,  Norman</span>  (1880&#150;1976), <span class="occ">chemical engineer</span>, was born at Silkstone Common, Silkstone, Yorkshire, on 16 December 1880, the eldest of three sons and a daughter of William Swindin, stationmaster at Silkstone, and his wife, Martha Normansell. The family moved in 1884 to Macclesfield, where Swindin attended St Paul's School, winning a scholarship to Macclesfield grammar school. His father died in 1892 and Swindin, aged fourteen, started work as a weigh-bridge clerk to help support his family. In 1895 they moved to his mother's home town of Barnsley, and Swindin found employment as a clerk at Rylands bottling plant. His interest in improving the operating systems in the plant brought home to him his lack of mathematical and scientific knowledge and he began to study at evening classes, a habit which continued throughout his working life.<br>
<br>In 1901 Swindin joined Davis Brothers, a firm of consulting chemical engineers in Manchester, as a draughtsman. He was given a good training and much responsibility, and as George Davis was the owner of the <span class="italic">Chemical Trade Journal</span>, Swindin found himself writing for this and for technical books published by the firm. He revelled in Manchester's cultural life, joined various social and radical groups, and exchanged his earlier orthodox belief for a respectful atheism. On 14 May 1910 he married Norah Beatrice Bayfield, the daughter of a shipper's clerk, and they set up house at Stockport. It was to be a long and happy, though childless, marriage.<br>
<br>George Davis's death in 1907 caused Swindin to seek work elsewhere. His next three years were spent at the Lennox foundry in south London where he designed chemical vessels to be cast in a non-corroding alloy invented by Lennox. Swindin did not enjoy his time there but learned much that was of use in later years. There was a brief episode with the Safety Celluloid Company, the first manufacturers of cellophane, before Swindin joined Edgar Ashcroft, a more generous inventor who gave him free rein. Around 1918 a change of management drove him out and he joined the staff of Beckton gasworks, spending two years there before moving to work for Frank Elmore designing apparatus for the extraction of zinc and lead from sulphide ores.<br>
<br>Swindin confessed in his autobiography that his whole career had consisted of interludes until he joined Elmore  (Swindin, 122), but during his time at Elmore's Harlesden workshops he developed two techniques of fundamental importance for handling and processing corrosive chemicals, which also reduced the cost of plant construction. The first was the Swindin burner for submerged combustion, in which the flame was immersed within the liquor to be heated; the second was a method of bonding vulcanized rubber to mild steel so that corrosive liquors could safely be circulated through steel pipes, pumps, and holding tanks.<br>
<br>Elmore's lead-extraction process ended in failure and his company was taken over. Swindin decided that the time had come for him to set up his own consultancy; having recruited his brother Thomas, and a few friends from previous projects, he set up a laboratory at Wealdstone, trading under the name Nordac. The business flourished and Swindin was able to devote more time to professional activities. He was a member of the Institute of Mechanical Engineers and a founder member of the Institution of Chemical Engineers, in which he was too much of a maverick to reach high office, though he received its Osborne Reynolds medal. He took a keen interest in professional training for young engineers and developed a close association with Loughborough University, which awarded him an honorary degree in 1972. In 1946 and again in 1950 he and his wife crossed the Atlantic to visit chemical engineering plants in the USA and Canada, and in 1948 he was invited to lecture in Paris.<br>
<br>Reading was always Swindin's passion and his means of self-improvement. He retained a strong belief in social justice, without desiring to take part in politics. He was no stranger to the problems of management and administration, yet these had no appeal for him, and although a successful businessman, he never considered himself a capitalist. Swindin retired at the age of eighty, and moved to Bognor Regis, where he died at his home, 7 Parkway, on 25 August 1976.<br>
