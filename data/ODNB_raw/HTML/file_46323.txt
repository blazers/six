<span class="headword">Cousins <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Gillespie]</span>,  Margaret Elizabeth</span>  (1878&#150;1954), <span class="occ">social reformer and women's activist</span>, was born on 7 November 1878 at Boyle, co. Roscommon, Ireland, the first child of Margaret Shera and her husband, Joseph Gillespie (<i>d</i>. 1930). Her father was the clerk of petty sessions in the Boyle court house, a unionist, and a protestant. Her parents provided a materially and emotionally comfortable middle-class childhood. Margaret attended Victoria High School for Girls in Londonderry on a scholarship and matriculated with distinction in 1898. She then went to the Royal Irish Academy of Music in Dublin where she acquired academic and professional reinforcement for her lifelong interest in music and earned the bachelor's degree in music from the Royal University of Ireland in October 1902. In 1900 she met <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/46537/', "James Henry Sproull Cousins (1873&#150;1956)")</script>, an aspiring poet and playwright who had come from Belfast to Dublin where he was active in the Celtic revival. They married on 9 April 1903; at their wedding banquet she announced her commitment to the vegetarianism which her husband practised.<br>
<br>During the early years of the twentieth century Margaret Cousins became involved in organizational activities related first to vegetarianism and then to women's suffrage. In her memoirs, written with her husband, Margaret linked an invitation to speak at a vegetarian conference in Manchester with her initial awareness of the women's suffragist movement after attending a meeting of the National Council of Women held simultaneously in December 1906  (Cousins and Cousins, 128&#150;9). Subsequently she began to campaign with women suffragists in Ireland and in England. In November 1908 she joined Francis and Hannah Sheehy Skeffington to found the militant Irish Women's Franchise League, which sought the franchise for Irish women on the same basis as that granted for Irish men. For not subordinating female suffrage to Irish home rule, the league was criticized as unpatriotic and its members as selfish. Disillusioned by the lack of impact that outdoor meetings and written propaganda had during the league's initial years, Margaret took up the militant tactics of the suffragettes, breaking windows on Downing Street in November 1910 and then at Dublin Castle in January 1913, and serving a one-month sentence of imprisonment in each case. Although she became an ally of English suffragists such as the Pethick-Lawrences, Cousins was careful to articulate the need for Irish suffragists to formulate goals and tactics suitable in the Irish situation.<br>
<br>Intimately linked with this public, political activity was Cousins's exploration of the occult and of theosophy. From the early 1900s she deemed herself to be especially receptive to the world of spirits and able to communicate with the spirits of deceased friends. Theosophy was congenial to such communication and to some feminist values. Theosophical authors proclaimed that males and females were on equal planes and that intuition, usually viewed as more developed in women than in men, was a higher means of knowing the world of spirits. Theosophical thought also emphasized the underlying unity of diverse elements such as religions and ethnic groups. Theosophy provided both a propitious ideological base and the entry to India, where Cousins would work for the remaining four decades of her life.<br>
<br>In 1913 the Cousinses moved to Garston, near Liverpool, where James worked for a vegetarian food company. Since Margaret was unable to establish close ties with English women activists in the Liverpool area, she felt rudderless and was eager to move to India when her husband obtained a position as literary editor on <span class="italic">New India</span>, a newspaper launched by Annie Besant, then the president of the Theosophical Society, at Adyar in the suburbs of Madras. Soon after arriving in Madras in November 1915 James Cousins lost his editorial post. In late 1916 the couple moved to Madanapalle, in the hinterland of Madras, where both taught at a theosophical college. Here Margaret became involved with women's rights issues. In 1917, when constitutional reform was imminent, she organized a deputation of Indian women and drafted a petition asking Edwin S. Montagu, the secretary of state for India, and the viceroy, Lord Chelmsford, for female suffrage. From then until the late 1930s she worked behind the scenes to gain and extend women's suffrage in India: briefing Indian women who lobbied British officials in London, writing supportive articles for Indian newspapers, and organizing campaigns for Indian women candidates when they became eligible for election to provincial assemblies.<br>
<br>Although content to be in the shadow of Annie Besant, Margaret was an active propagandist for theosophy as well as for women's rights. In 1917 she helped Dorothy Jinarajadasa, a British theosophist, to organize the Women's India Association, and became the editor of its journal, <span class="italic">Stri Dharma</span>, which was published in English, Telugu, and Tamil versions. The association and its journal linked political and social programmes. In 1926 Cousins embarked on planning for the All India Women's Conference, which focused initially on developing women's education, then on broader social and legal issues such as age of marriage, birth control, and a uniform civil code, while trying to remain aloof from political objectives which were deemed potentially divisive. Margaret was a long-time member of the standing committee of the conference and its president in 1936&#150;7. She was particularly active as a propagandist, publishing numerous articles and two books on Indian women, <span class="italic">The Awakening of Asian Womanhood</span> (1922) and <span class="italic">Indian Womanhood Today</span> (1941). In the early 1940s poor health and &#145;the feeling that direct participation by me was no longer required, or even desired, by the leaders of Indian womanhood who were now coming to the front&#146;  (Cousins and Cousins, 740) led to her withdrawal from public activity. In 1943 Margaret suffered the first in a series of debilitating strokes.<br>
<br>A feminist first and a nationalist second, whether in Ireland or in India, Cousins sought to reform patriarchal ideology, practices, and institutions to equalize educational, political, and economic opportunities for women. Her ideology of the &#145;femaculine&#146; which strove for &#145;a synthesis of the virtues of the masculine and feminine in which the defects of each are balanced if not eliminated&#146;  (M. Cousins, <span class="italic">Irish Citizen</span>, 12 June 1912, 10) was both conservative and radical. It reflected a belief that men and women had inherent characteristics, and led her to extol women's distinctive qualities as both biological and social mothers. At the same time she sought to achieve transfigured gender relationships based on equality. In Ireland and England she focused on suffrage issues, while in India her purview expanded to include better educational opportunities, health care, and working conditions for women as well as suffrage. She also became a vocal proponent of Indian freedom and supporter of Mahatma Gandhi, and protested against a government ban on free speech in Madras in 1932 which earned her a year's imprisonment. Although she was articulate about the inequities of class divisions within Indian society, her reform programme was directed at the concerns of middle- and upper-class Indian women. Even so, Cousins worked tirelessly to identify with Indian women as a colleague, to develop organizational and propaganda infrastructures which Indian women could utilize to pursue their own agendas, and to foster contacts between Indian women and women activists around the world. A life of service was her ideal, and in India she sought to be a builder of bridges between women.<br>
<br>Margaret Cousins died on 11 March 1954 in Adyar, Madras. She was cremated according to Hindu practices, and her ashes were deposited in the Ganges River at Varanasi. The All India Women's Conference honoured her contribution by naming their library at their national headquarters in New Delhi after her.<br>
