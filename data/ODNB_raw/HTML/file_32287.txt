<span class="headword">Cardew,  Philip</span>  (1851&#150;1910), <span class="occ">army officer and electrical engineer</span>, was born on 24 September 1851 at Oakshade, near Leatherhead, Surrey, the eldest son in a family of four sons and four daughters of Captain Christopher Baldock Cardew, 74th highlanders, of East Hill, Liss (son of Lieutenant-General George Cardew, colonel-commandant Royal Engineers), and his wife, Eliza Jane, second daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2305/', "Richard Bethell, first Baron Westbury")</script>. Educated at Guildford grammar school, he passed first into the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, in 1868, and left at the head of his batch. He was awarded the Pollock medal and the sword of honour, and commissioned lieutenant in the Royal Engineers on 4 January 1871. After two years at Chatham, he was sent to Aldershot and Portsmouth. From September 1873 to April 1874 he was employed at the War Office on defences, and, after a year at Glasgow, went to Bermuda in May 1875.<br>
<br>Cardew was placed in charge of military telegraphs and joined the Submarine Mining Service, applying electricity to military purposes, which was to be the pursuit of his life. At the end of 1876 he was transferred to Chatham, where the headquarters of the Submarine Mining Service was on board HMS <i>Hood</i>, lying in the Medway off Gillingham. In 1878 he was acting adjutant of the submarine miners at Portsmouth, and became in the same year (1 April) assistant instructor in electricity at Chatham. Cardew married in London, on 19 June 1879, his first cousin, Mary Annunziata, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21380/', "Mansfield Parkyns")</script>, the traveller in Abyssinia. They had three sons and two daughters, and Mary survived him.<br>
<br>Cardew assisted in important experiments with electric searchlight apparatus for the Royal Engineers committee. The need for better instruments led him to design a galvanometer for measuring large currents of electricity (described in a paper for the Institution of Electrical Engineers, 25 May 1882). He next evolved the idea of the hot-wire galvanometer, or voltmeter, for which he was awarded the gold medal at the inventions exhibition in London of 1885. He also originated a method of finding the efficiency of a dynamo.<br>
<br>Cardew's invention of the vibratory transmitter for telegraphy was perhaps his most important, and in the case of faulty lines it proved useful not only on active service overseas but also during heavy snowstorms at home. He received a money reward for this from the imperial and Indian governments. The utility of the invention was greatly extended by his further invention of &#145;separators&#146;, consisting of a combination of choking coil and two condensers. These instruments enabled a vibrating telegraph circuit to be superimposed on an ordinary Morse circuit without interference between the two, thus doubling the message-carrying capability of the line. His apparatus for testing lightning conductors was adopted by the war department.<br>
<br>Promoted captain on 4 January 1883 and major on 12 April 1889, Cardew was from 1 April 1882 instructor in electricity at Chatham. On 1 April 1889 he was appointed the first electrical adviser to the Board of Trade. He held a long inquiry into the proposals for the electric lighting of London, and drew up regulations on the supply of electricity for power and light.<br>
<br>Cardew retired from the Royal Engineers on 24 October 1894, and from the Board of Trade in 1898. He then entered into partnership with Sir William Preece &amp; Sons, consulting engineers, and was actively engaged on large Admiralty orders, involving an expenditure of &pound;1,500,000. He joined the board of the London, Brighton, and South Coast Railway in 1902, and visited Sydney, New South Wales, in connection with its electrical installations. He published scientific and technical papers, served on the council of the Institution of Electrical Engineers, and was its vice-president in 1901&#150;2. Cardew died on 17 May 1910 at his residence, Crownpits House, Godalming, Surrey, and was buried at Brookwood cemetery on the 21st.<br>
