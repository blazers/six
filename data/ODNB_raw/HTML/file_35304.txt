<span class="headword">Oliver,  Francis Wall</span>  (1864&#150;1951), <span class="occ">palaeobotanist and ecologist</span>, was born on 10 May 1864 at Richmond, Surrey, the only son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/54095/', "Daniel Oliver (1830&#150;1916)")</script>, from 1864 keeper at Kew, and Hannah, daughter of James Wall, of Sheffield. Oliver's father was a member of the Society of Friends and sent his son at the age of nine to the Friends' school at Kendal. There, Oliver developed a passion and skill for mountaineering which persisted; in later years he climbed the Alps with J. Norman Collie and E. J. Garwood. He went next to Bootham School, York, where he was given charge of their 4&frac12; inch telescope and, but for his early love of botany, might have adopted astronomy as a career. After a year at University College, London, he went to Trinity College, Cambridge, where he obtained a foundation scholarship and first-class honours in both parts of the natural sciences tripos (1885&#150;6). He spent vacations studying at Bonn and T&uuml;bingen, where he met many leading botanists of the day.<br>
<br>In 1888 Oliver took his father's place at University College, London, first as lecturer, then in 1890 as Quain professor of botany, a chair which he held until 1929. Oliver's earliest papers were mostly of a physiological character and mention should be made of his pioneer investigations of the effect of fog on vegetation at the time when &#145;London particulars&#146; could turn daylight into darkness  (<span class="italic">Journal of the Royal Horticultural Society</span>, 1891). In 1894&#150;5, with the help of others, he translated the <span class="italic">Pflanzenleben</span> of Kerner von Marilaun, under the title of <span class="italic">The Natural History of Plants</span>, which was a great success financially and further stimulated the ecological bias that had been aroused in Oliver by his contacts at Bonn. In 1896 Oliver married Mildred Alice (<i>d</i>. 1932), daughter of Charles Robert Thompson, surgeon, of Westerham, whom he encountered when climbing in the Alps. They had one daughter and two sons, both of whom attained distinction in the navy. The elder son was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/31514/', "Sir Geoffrey Nigel Oliver")</script>.<br>
<br>In 1892 Oliver became associated with the newly appointed honorary keeper of the Jodrell Laboratory, D. H. Scott. Oliver induced Scott to give the famous lectures on fossil plants at University College in 1896. Soon afterwards Oliver began his researches, which might best be described as meticulous palaeobotanical detection, on fossil seeds. They led to the recognition of <i>Lagenostoma lomaxi</i> as the seed of a woody, fern-like plant, the well-known fossil, <i>Lyginopteris oldhamia</i>  (<span class="italic">Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society</span>, 1905). Oliver thus established the existence of a group, the Pteridosperms, with fern-like habits but bearing seeds, as an important feature of the Coal-Measure vegetation. Apart from this, his chief contributions to the subject were a detailed account of a primitive type (<i>Physostoma elegans</i>) of <i>Stephanospermum</i> and, with E. J. Salisbury, an account of the seeds of the genus <i>Conostoma</i>  (<span class="italic">Annals of Botany</span>, 1911). For his contributions to palaeobotany Oliver was elected FRS in 1905.<br>
<br>From 1904 to 1908 Oliver organized September visits to the Brittany coast to study salt-marsh vegetation, and after 1910 he annually took his honours students for a fortnight to Blakeney Point, Norfolk, to study plant life in relation to habitat conditions and raised the funds to erect the field laboratory there. In his later years Oliver turned his attention increasingly towards the dynamic aspects of ecology, studying in particular the physiography of shingle beaches and salt marsh development in relation to their vegetation. As an outcome he became interested in the value of cord grass (<i>Spartina townsendii</i>) as a reclaimer of mud flats and subsequently in collaboration with a marine engineer, A. E. Carey, published a book on <span class="italic">Tidal Lands</span> (1918) which emphasized the role that plants could play in coastal conservation.<br>
<br>From 1929 until 1935 Oliver was professor at Cairo University. In the latter year he went to live on the edge of the desert and studied the changing aspects of its vegetation. He returned finally to England in 1950. Robust physically, with a strikingly well-cut physiognomy, Oliver had only one serious illness. He was fundamentally shy and reserved, with a marked capacity for silence, but he evoked the affection of his close associates. His sense of humour was reflected in his <span class="italic">Who's Who</span> entry, where he listed his recreations as &#145;once mountaineering, now washing up&#146;. He died at his home, Ballards Barn, Limpsfield, Surrey, on 14 September 1951.<br>
