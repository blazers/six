<span class="headword">Day,  William</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1605, <em>d.</em> 1684), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and biblical commentator</span>, was baptized at Windsor on 23 June 1605, the eldest son of Matthew Day (1574&#150;1661), five times mayor of Windsor, and lord of the manor of Sunninghill, Berkshire, and Mary (1580/81&#150;1667), daughter of George Dowdeswell, gentleman, of Eton, Buckinghamshire, and grandson of his namesake, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7373/', "William Day (1529&#150;1596)")</script>, bishop of Winchester; he had five brothers and six sisters, including <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7370/', "Matthew Day (bap. 1611, d. 1663)")</script>. He became a king's scholar at Eton, and in 1624 was admitted as a scholar of King's College, Cambridge, where he graduated BA in 1628, proceeded MA in 1632, and was a fellow until 1637. He was also incorporated at Oxford in 1635.<br>
<br>In 1637 Day was presented by Eton College to the vicarage of Mapledurham, Oxfordshire, on the resignation of his prospective father-in-law, Daniel Collins, fellow of Eton and canon of Windsor. He married Mary Collins on new year's day 1638 in St George's Chapel, Windsor, and apparently lived in the town, since his first two sons were baptized at St George's. From late 1643 he was resident at Mapledurham, where five daughters and three more sons were born, several of whom died in infancy. He continued in the parish throughout the Commonwealth. In 1654 he described himself as &#145;An Unworthy Servant of God in the Gospel, at Mapledurham&#146; when he published <span class="italic">An Exposition of the Book of the Prophet Isaiah</span>, a scholarly commentary on the text intended for family use, with questions and answers to assist learning, and a glossary of technical vocabulary. In 1660 he was made divinity reader at St George's Chapel, but remained resident at Mapledurham, virtually unassisted, where he also wrote <span class="italic">A Paraphrase and Commentary upon &hellip; Romans</span> (1666); this took a traditional evangelical approach, and argued dispassionately against texts used by Anabaptists and Quakers respectively to support baptism by immersion and personal guidance by the Holy Spirit.<br>
<br>With his eldest son, Matthew, Day helped manage the Sunninghill estate in his father's last years, but sold it in 1668 after his mother's death. After inheriting he gave property to New Windsor parish to endow alms for the poor. He died in 1684, and was buried at Mapledurham church on 20 December; his wife survived him.<br>
