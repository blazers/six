<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Tindal,  Matthew</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1657, <em>d.</em> 1733), <span class="occ">freethinker and religious controversialist</span>, was baptized on 12 May 1657 at Bere Ferrers, Devon, the son of John Tindal, who was the minister there, and his wife, Anne Halse. He was taught by his father before entering Lincoln College, Oxford, in 1672, and there he was a pupil of George Hickes, the future nonjuror; he migrated to Exeter College, and graduated BA on 17 October 1676. He was elected to a law fellowship at All Souls College, Oxford, in 1678, taking the degrees of BCL in 1679 and DCL in 1685, after which he became a member of Doctors' Commons. He had become a Roman Catholic at Oxford, and attended mass frequently during James II's reign; he worked in his service during Monmouth's rebellion. Tindal, a great frequenter of London coffee houses, &#145;fell into the acquaintance of some persons, whose conversation led him into a dislike of Popery&#146;  (Lloyd, 3960), and he returned to the Church of England, taking communion from the warden of All Souls on Easter day 1688.<br>
<br>A warm defender of the revolution in 1688, Tindal became an increasingly strong critic of the powers claimed by Church of England clergy, turning from Christianity to freethinking within a decade. Many of his contemporaries saw him as an opportunist in religion, having converted to Catholicism allegedly in the hope of securing the wardenship of All Souls under James II and returning to the Church of England just before the king's defeat by William of Orange. He was notoriously immoral, and was publicly reprimanded at All Souls as &#145;an <i>Egregious Fornicator</i>&#146;  (Lloyd, 3960). The poet Abel Evans combined both of his principal vices when denouncing Tindal in <span class="italic">The Apparation</span> (1710):<blockquote>
<div>In Vice and Error from his <i>Cradle</i> Nurs'd:<br>
</div>
<div>He studies hard, and takes extreme Delight,<br>
</div>
<div>In Whores, or Heresies to spend the Night.<br>
</div> (p. 6)</blockquote>In the course of this satire, Evans has Tindal surprised by Satan in the form of a female bedmaker with whom he has previously had an affair; Satan then reverts to his true form and plots, with his &#145;Vassal sworn&#146;, the destruction of the Church of England in favour of atheism, Spinozism, and dissent, before obligingly disappearing up a chimney. Thomas Hearne, the Oxford antiquary, thought Evans's work ingenious, and reported that Tindal was &#145;dejected at it&#146;; Hearne always kept a close eye on Tindal the &#145;Libertine&#146;, &#145;that notorious Atheist&#146;, &#145;that Rascal&#146;, a promoter of other &#145;vile, republican Rascals&#146;  (<span class="italic">Remarks</span>, 2.332, 72; 3.255, 381, 439).<br>
<br>Whatever his personal reputation, Tindal had made a name for himself as a lawyer in the early years of William III's reign, first in the case of an Italian count who had sought protection as a foreign subject from prosecution for murder, and second for arguing, in a controversial judgment in 1693, that followers of James II who had taken to the seas ought to be prosecuted as pirates, on the grounds that a deposed monarch had no authority to issue a commission for the high sea. He developed his case, citing Cicero and Grotius and other legal precedents, in a blatantly anti-Jacobite tract, <span class="italic">An Essay Concerning the Laws of Nations, and the Rights of Soveraigns</span> (1694), which denounced all James's followers as either robbers or pirates. Such loyalty to the Williamite regime gained him a considerable public reputation, and, it was claimed, an annual salary of &pound;200 from the crown. This was the high point of his legal career, and he devoted his remaining years to pamphleteering on political and religious matters, continuing to practise law at Gray's Inn and retreating regularly to All Souls, where he gathered around him a group of whig secularist lawyers opposed to the religious requirements made of fellows by the college's statutes. He enjoyed baiting college fellows on religious matters; Herbert Croft reported a characteristic remark he made about a younger fellow, Edward Young, which found its way into Johnson's life of the poet: &#145;&#147;The other boys,&#148; said the atheist, &#147;I can always answer, because I always know whence they have their arguments, which I have read an hundred times; but that fellow Young is continually pestering me with something of his own&#148;&#146;  (&#145;Young&#146; in S. Johnson, <span class="italic">Lives of the English Poets</span>, ed. G. B. Hill, 1905, 3.364).<br>
<br>As his friend Edmund Curll observed, Tindal's life was to prove &#145;a continual Warfare in the Republic of Letters, for the Space of above forty Years&#146;  (Curll, 1). The general direction of Tindal's future thoughts on politics and religion can be traced in the first pamphlet which he devoted to these matters, <span class="italic">An essay concerning the power of the magistrate, and the rights of mankind, in matters of religion</span> (1697). The tract was written to further Locke's arguments in his &#145;three incomparable Letters concerning Toleration&#146;, as Tindal emphasized that &#145;impartial Liberty and mutual Toleration&#146; were the &#145;only way to preserve both Church and State&#146;  (p. 2). Tindal argued that the rights of the magistrate were secured from the people, not from God, so that he had no powers over religion. To enforce conformity against the pleas of individual conscience was to destroy each individual's chance of eternal happiness, and to act against God's honour: it was &#145;consequently the greatest and most comprehensive of all Sins whatever&#146;  (p. 67). He went on to argue for the rights of dissenters to worship as they pleased, and in favour of a nationalization act for religious refugees, which would have had, he contended, a markedly beneficial impact on trade and commerce. The chief part of religion was, he insisted, &#145;promoting the Publick Good&#146;  (pp. 173&#150;4), and his defence of toleration was designed to do just that. The tone of this pamphlet was even-handed and decorous; his writings quickly became altogether more sarcastic and contentious when his battles with high-churchmanship become much more explicit in the early 1700s.<br>
<br>By far the most contentious of Tindal's writings at mid-career appeared in 1706: <span class="italic">The rights of the Christian church asserted, against the Romish, and all other priests who claim an independent power over it</span>. The enemy he identified was at least as much high-churchmanship as it was Roman Catholicism, and he adopted the apparently moderate tones of a supporter of an Anglican <i>via media</i> in a defence of the Reformation which actually had profound implications for all styles of churchmanship. He opposed the claims for two independent powers subsisting in the same society, the one ecclesiastical, the other magisterial, condemning &#145;the Spiritual Babylon&#146; promoted by high-church contenders for such a separation  (p. 33). He argued that it was in the interests of the clergy to complicate religion, thereby making themselves indispensable in the religious lives of the people: their powers made the protestant call for further reformation impossible, and the interests of their church were declared to be incompatible with those of true religion. &#145;From this Conduct of the High-flown Clergy&#146;, he concluded, &#145;some have taken the Liberty to compare a High-Church Priest in Politicks to a Monkey in a Glass-shop, where as he can do no good, so he never fails of doing Mischief enough&#146;  (p. 270). He saw in this attitude of clerics a means to defend himself, noting of it that &#145;nothing sooner [gives] a Man the Character of an Atheist than being an Enemy to Priestcraft&#146;  (p. 415).<br>
<br>Hickes, Tindal's former tutor, wrote one of the most effective replies to the work, having discovered that his former pupil had told &#145;a Gentleman, who found him at it with Pen in Hand, <i>That he was Writing a Book which would make the Clergy Mad</i>&#146;. <span class="italic">The Rights of the Christian Church</span> was denounced by Hickes as &#145;the Commonplace-Book of <i>Atheists</i> and <i>Deists</i>&#146;, as he found, &#145;In one word, That it is Atheistical all over&#146;  (<span class="italic">Spinoza Reviv'd</span>, 1709, [1], [50], 3). William Wotton delivered an equally pugnacious reply, declaring of Tindal's book that it was written with &#145;Petulancy and Indecency of Stile&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Rights of the Clergy in the Christian Church Asserted</span>, 1706, 3). An anonymous reply quickly appeared, denouncing both Wotton and Hickes and pointing out that Le Clerc had made admiring noises about the book in his <span class="italic">Bibliotheque choisie</span>. Entitled <span class="italic">A Defence of the Rights of the Christian Church</span> (1709), this reply aroused almost as much anger as had Tindal's book, and it was burnt on the orders of the House of Commons, along with its high-church analogue, Sacheverell's <span class="italic">Sermons</span>, on 25 March 1710. Dozens of replies had been made to <span class="italic">The Rights of the Christian Church</span>, and a campaign was launched against it at Oxford, where Tindal was denounced as a Lockean and an extreme whig. Hearne lamented the impact of <span class="italic">The Rights of the Christian Church</span>, &#145;a most Violent, poysonous Book, and levell'd against ye Church of England&#146;  (<span class="italic">Remarks</span>, 2.72). Jonathan Swift was less certain of the book's impact on Christian commitment, asking ironically, &#145;What other Subject through all Art or Nature could have produced Tindal for an Author, or furnished him with Readers?&#146;  (<span class="italic">An Argument Against Abolishing Christianity</span>, in <span class="italic">The Prose Works of Jonathan Swift</span>, ed. H. Davis, 1939, 2.36).<br>
<br>Aside from sporadic contributions to the anti-clerical cause, notably <span class="italic">New High-Church Turn'd Old Presbyterian</span> (1709), <span class="italic">Merciful Judgements of the High Church Triumphant</span> (1710), and <span class="italic">A New Catechism with Dr. Hickes's Thirty Nine Articles</span> (1710), Tindal reverted to politics as his main focus in the early years of the reign of George I. He censured Robert Walpole for splitting the whig party&#151;he had looked to him for a reform of the universities, and had particularly hoped to laicise the fellowship at All Souls&#151;in two tracts, <span class="italic">Defection Considered</span> (1717) and the consequent <span class="italic">Account of a Manuscript, Entitul'd, &#145;Destruction the Certain Consequences of Division&#146;</span> (1718). This soon became a more positive relationship, as can be seen in two further tracts, <span class="italic">A Defence of our Present Happy Establishment, and the Administration Vindicated</span> (1722) and his <span class="italic">Enquiry into the Causes of our Present Disaffection</span> (1722). Tindal was something of a court whig, and was quick to denounce opposition whiggery, as in his critique of the polemicists John Trenchard and Thomas Gordon in <span class="italic">The judgement of Dr. Prideaux concerning the murder of Julius Caesar, by the conspirators, as a most villanous act, maintain'd</span> (1721), where he praised England's political system as &#145;the best, and easiest of all Governments; where the utmost Liberty and Safety are joined together&#146;  (p. 94).<br>
<br>Religious issues dominated the closing years of Tindal's life, and he was one of the principal propagandists during the anti-clerical warfare that dominated the 1730s. His first contribution to this debate was in the form of two replies to Bishop Edmund Gibson's immensely influential pastoral letters to his London clergy on the increase in freethinking and infidelity. In <span class="italic">An Address to the Inhabitants of the Two Great Cities of London and Westminster</span> (1729; 2nd edn, 1730) Tindal voiced his shock at Gibson's defence of revelation as being, in Tindal's reading, above reason. Citing on his side a long line of rational divines, Tindal found in Gibson and his clerical allies such as Daniel Waterland an abrogation of reason which could only compromise religion; in <span class="italic">A Second Address</span> (1730) he also pointedly adverted to West Indian slavery and bad behaviour in India as indicating the hypocrisies attendant on a merely external adherence to Christianity. Much of Tindal's language was consciously modulated in the style of latitudinarian divines, hence something of the anger of clerical respondents to his writings. This register was distilled most effectively in his final work, <span class="italic">Christianity as Old as the Creation</span> (1731). This takes the form of a dialogue, and is essentially a detailed argument for the supremacy of natural over revealed religion. For Tindal, reason was to be employed first to discover, and then to put into practice, the obligations of morality which flow from discovering the existence of a beneficent creator. While he pays lip-service to Christianity as being what his subtitle proclaims a &#145;republication of the religion of nature&#146;, it is abundantly clear to the reader that natural religion effectively makes revealed religions&#151;Judaism, Islam, Christianity&#151;redundant and, as polemical distortions of natural religion, potentially dangerous. It was a notably contentious book; Tindal claimed that natural religion would bring out the &#145;same sentiment&#146; in &#145;Men of good Sense&#146;, so that &#145;a Shaftesbury will say the same as a Tillotson&#146;  (<span class="italic">Christianity as Old as the Creation</span>, 78), thereby eliding a freethinker with the most revered of latitudinarian divines. He blamed priestcraft as the cause of religious controversy, for the imposers of creeds had proved themselves &#145;the common Plagues of Mankind&#146;  (ibid., 163&#150;4). When a Christian divine attempted to prove the superiority of revealed over natural religion, as in the writings of Samuel Clarke, Tindal saw only that &#145;on Pretence of promoting the Honour of Revelation, [he] is introducing universal scepticism&#146;  (ibid., 381). Though in many ways a grand summation of freethinking at mid-century, <span class="italic">Christianity as Old as the Creation</span> is, as one authoritative commentator has observed, &#145;a disappointing book which deserved some at least of the scorn of its contemporary critics&#146;  (Rivers, 2.15). Scorn there was in plenty, and answers to the book encompassed a wide arc of clerical (and lay) opinion, from the nonjuror William Law to the dissenter Nathanial Lardner. In all, something like thirty replies, from pamphlets to quartos, appeared to repudiate its message. Even John &#145;Orator&#146; Henley added his contribution in <span class="italic">Deism Defeated, and Christianity Defended</span> (1731), and an anonymous poem appeared in 1730, <span class="italic">Blasphemy as Old as the Creation</span>, in which Tindal's Epicureanism was turned against him:<blockquote>
<div>This Tindal knew; and pious vow'd to quit<br>
</div>
<div>Doctrines, that very seldom turn'd his Spit:<br>
</div>
<div>Tir'd with a Church, whose Canons did define<br>
</div>
<div>That to believe, was sweeter than to Dine.<br>
</div> (p. 8)</blockquote>Tindal's reputation for sensual indulgence, both sexual and at the table, was often used against him. An anonymous fellow of All Souls pitched on his &#145;Canine Appetite&#146; as a recurring metaphor for his venal character in <span class="italic">The Religious, Rational, and Moral Conduct of Matthew Tindal, L.L.D.</span> of 1735  (p. 10). Debauchery was his other great sin, and the writer referred to the &#145;Doctor's Amours and natural Children&#146;  (p. 22), before retelling older tales of his attempts on young women's honour, concluding of his subject that he was &#145;a notorious and bare-faced Factor for the Devil, a Debauchee, a Renegade, an Atheist&#146;  (p. 62). A fault of which the author made little was Tindal's abstemiousness when it came to drink. After the furore over <span class="italic">Christianity as Old as the Creation</span>, Tindal fell into a decline. Only the first thirty-two pages of the second part of <span class="italic">Christianity as Old as the Creation</span> were subsequently printed.<br>
<br>Tindal died, following complications from a gallstone, in his rooms at Gray's Inn on 16 August 1733. He was buried, as he had wished, next to the latitudinarian bishop Gilbert Burnet in the cemetery attached to Clerkenwell church, London, on 23 August. Even in death he was subject to controversy. The writer Eustace Budgell insisted that he and Mrs Price, the widow of a judge (who seems to have been Tindal's last mistress), were his only legatees, but the will so promoted was disputed by his nephew, the historian Nicholas Tindal, in whose favour the matter was resolved. Budgell claimed to have been entrusted with a copy of the second part of <span class="italic">Christianity as Old as the Creation</span>; if so, it was never recovered, and the story that Bishop Gibson acquired it before destroying it is spurious.<br>
