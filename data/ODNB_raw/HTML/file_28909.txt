<span class="headword">Wearg, Sir  Clement</span>  (1686?&#150;1726), <span class="occ">lawyer and politician</span>, was born in Kensington, London, the eldest son of Thomas Wearg of the Inner Temple and his wife, Mary Fletcher of Ely. He was baptized at the church of St Botolph, Aldersgate, the parish where his grandfather, Thomas Wearg, a wealthy merchant, lived. He was admitted to Peterhouse, Cambridge, in 1705, and became a student at the Inner Temple on 25 November 1706. In 1711 he was called to the bar; he became a bencher in 1723, a reader in 1724, and treasurer in 1725.<br>
<br>Wearg was a zealous whig and protestant. In 1722 he contested, without success, the borough of Shaftesbury in Dorset. He acted as the counsel for the crown in the prosecutions of the Jacobites Christopher Layer and Bishop Francis Atterbury, and his replies, made with Thomas Reeve, to Atterbury's defence in court were published in 1723. On 1 October of the same year he married Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1746), the daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/19022/', "Sir James Montagu")</script>, chief baron of the exchequer. Following the resignation of Sir Robert Raymond as attorney-general, he was appointed solicitor-general on 3 February 1724. He was knighted three days later, and was returned for the Godolphin parliamentary borough of Helston on 10 March. While solicitor-general, Wearg managed the impeachment of Lord Chancellor Macclesfield (the attorney-general, Sir Philip Yorke, declined to undertake the impeachment, as a friend of Macclesfield), and also gave legal support to Lord Bolingbroke's petition for the restoration of his estates. He died of a violent fever on 6 April 1726 and was buried, in accordance with the request in his will, in the Temple churchyard, under a plain raised tomb, on 12 April. His oratory has been described as that of &#145;a master of terse and forcible reasoning; and if his life had not been cut short by a premature death he would probably have attained a high judicial position&#146;  (Holdsworth, <span class="italic">Eng. law</span>, 12.460).<br>
<br>Following Wearg's death, Edmund Curll advertised late in 1726 the publication of six volumes of <span class="italic">Cases of Impotence and Divorce, by Sir Clement Wearg, Late Solicitor-General</span>. Curll was attacked for this by &#145;A. P.&#146;, perhaps Alexander Pope, in the <span class="italic">London Journal</span> on 12 November 1726, but two days later swore an affidavit that a book published by him in 1715 entitled <span class="italic">The case of impotency as debated in England, anno 1613, in trial between Robert, earl of Essex, and the Lady Frances Howard</span> was by Wearg. It was dated from the Inner Temple, 30 October 1714. As Wearg then had chambers in the new court, there might have been some grounds for the controversy. Lady Wearg died on 9 March 1746, and was buried with her husband on 14 March. There were no children from the marriage.<br>
