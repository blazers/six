<span class="headword">Dickson,  David</span>  (1754&#150;1820), <span class="occ">Church of Scotland minister and theologian</span>, was born in the parish of Newlands, Peeblesshire, on 30 March 1754, the son of David Dickson (1709&#150;1780), minister of Newlands, and his wife, Ann Gillon (<i>d</i>. 1756). After attending school at West Linton and Peebles grammar school, he studied at Glasgow University from 1766 to 1774 or 1775, and then at Divinity Hall, Edinburgh University. He became assistant to his uncle John Noble, minister of Libberton, and, on Noble's death replaced him in that parish, being ordained on 1 May 1777. On 10 December 1777 he married Christiana Wardrobe (1754/5&#150;1832); they had eight children, including <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7616/', "David Dickson (1780&#150;1842)")</script>, Church of Scotland minister. In 1783 Dickson was translated to Bothkennar in Stirlingshire. In 1795 he was transferred to the chapel in New Street, Edinburgh; in 1799 to Trinity Church; and in 1801 to the New North Church in the same city, where he remained until his death.<br>
<br>Dickson was a popular minister in all his parishes; his appointments to Libberton and Bothkennar were both the results of petition by parishioners to the parish patrons. He was always conscientious about visiting his parishioners, and was involved in all of Edinburgh's charitable institutions.<br>
<br>Dickson was a supporter of the popular party in the Church of Scotland. He voted in the general assembly of 1789 against receiving the explanation of the Revd William McGill of Ayr as a satisfactory answer to the heresy with which he was charged. This case was satirized in Robert Burns's poem &#145;The kirk's alarm&#146;. Dickson was outspoken in his championship of popular party principles and was prepared to face censure by the ecclesiastical courts, as he did in the cases of the settlements of Biggar and Larbert, rather than act against his conscience. During his life he published several separate sermons, as well as a collection in 1818. He also wrote the account of Bothkennar parish for John Sinclair's <span class="italic">Statistical Account</span>. He died in Edinburgh on 2 August 1820. He was survived by his wife, who died on 14 March 1832, aged seventy-seven.<br>
