<span class="headword">Tooke,  Andrew</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1673, <em>d.</em> 1732), <span class="occ">schoolmaster and translator</span>, was baptized in the parish of St Gregory by Paul, London, on 22 January 1673, the second of the three sons of Benjamin Tooke, citizen and stationer, and his wife, Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Juell. He attended Charterhouse School from 1686 until 1690, when he entered Clare College, Cambridge, as a scholar; he graduated BA in 1693 and commenced MA in 1697. In 1695 he became usher, or assistant master, at Charterhouse, a post he retained when on 5 July 1704 he was appointed to succeed Robert Hooke as professor of geometry at Gresham College, London. In November that year he was elected fellow of the Royal Society, whose members met in his rooms at the college until 1710, when they acquired premises elsewhere.<br>
<br>On the death of his brother Benjamin (1671&#150;1723), Tooke inherited an estate of several thousand pounds. He continued to teach at Gresham College and at Charterhouse, where he was effectively in charge from 1723 during the terminal illness of the headmaster, Thomas Walker (<i>d</i>. 1728), whom he succeeded on 17 July 1728. Having taken deacon's orders, he occasionally preached and officiated in the Charterhouse chapel, but most of his time was spent teaching the boys. On 7 May 1729 he married Elizabeth, widow of Henry Levett (1668&#150;1725), the former physician at Charterhouse, and resigned as Gresham professor on 26 June that year.<br>
<br>A prolific writer, Tooke was best known for <span class="italic">The pantheon, representing the fabulous histories of the heathen gods and most illustrious heroes</span> (1698), translated from the <span class="italic">Pantheum mythicum</span> of the Jesuit father Fran&ccedil;ois Antoine Pomey, which went through twenty-two editions. He probably intended his <span class="italic">Synopsis Graecae linguae</span> (1711) and his edition of William Walker's <span class="italic">Treatise of English Particles</span> (1720) for his students. He also reprinted some accounts of Gresham College and a copy of Sir Thomas Gresham's will, which he had contributed to Stowe's <span class="italic">Survey of London</span>. His other publications were translations from French and Latin works of a moral or religious nature. Tooke died of dropsy on 20 January 1732 and was buried in the Charterhouse chapel, where a monument was erected to his memory. His large library was sold by auction in May 1732, and his estate passed to his brother Richard (1685&#150;1737).<br>
