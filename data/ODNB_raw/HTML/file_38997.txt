<span class="headword">Foden,  Edwin</span>  (1841&#150;1911), <span class="occ">vehicle manufacturer</span>, was born on 5 August 1841 in Smallwood, near Sandbach, Cheshire, the son of William Foden, a grocer, and his wife, Martha, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Goodall. He left school at thirteen, and after two years as a village post-boy he took up an apprenticeship with the agricultural engineering firm of Platt and Hancock, at Elworth, near Sandbach, walking the 3 miles from Smallwood daily. He then widened his experience at Crewe railway workshops and at another workshop in nearby Kidsgrove before returning to Elworth, where by the age of nineteen he was shop foreman.<br>
<br>By 1866, when he was twenty-five, Foden had risen to be a partner in the firm, now Hancock and Foden. He worked closely with his staff, readily sharing his engineering expertise. He earned their respect and loyalty, despite his tendency to criticize what he regarded as poor workmanship. He was known to peer over the shoulder of an employee, then take the tool from the man's hand and do the job himself, saying, &#145;Do it this way, lad, then tha'lt do it reet&#146;  (Kennet, 33).<br>
<br>In the mid-1860s Foden married Sophia Scragg (1841&#150;1893); they had two sons and two surviving daughters. In 1868 their first son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/46998/', "William Foden")</script>, was born. In 1870 Foden's partner, George Hancock, retired from Foden and Hancock, as it now was, though remaining as adviser. In 1876 Foden took sole control and renamed the firm Edwin Foden &amp; Sons, anticipating a family concern. At first he built mainly traction engines and mechanical threshers powered by horse-drawn &#145;portable&#146; steam engines. Such machines were cumbersome and costly, however, and he sought to improve them. Most traction engines were then of the single-cylinder type and designed for agricultural use, since the legislation of the day severely limited the haulage of freight by road. When restrictions on the use of engines on roads began to be lifted from the 1870s, Foden saw that the way lay ahead for a much more efficient engine, and that it could attract a healthy market. However, it would need to economize on fuel, since all the coal would have to be carried by the vehicle instead of being left in a heap at the worksite.<br>
<br>Foden's answer was a traction engine powered by a twin-cylinder, compound steam engine. It took him three years to develop this and early trials were not always successful. Finally, he produced a reliable, marketable engine and was so pleased with its performance that he entered it for the Royal Agricultural Society trials at Newcastle in 1887. Driven by his second son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/46999/', "Edwin Richard Foden (b. 1870)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/46998/', "Foden, William")</script>], it won a gold medal, thanks to its low fuel consumption (only 1.84 lb of coal per horsepower per hour) and versatility. Even so, it was still designed for agricultural use, and it was only in 1896, when the <span class="roman">Locomotives on Highways Act</span> was passed, allowing heavy machines to travel on the road, that Foden was finally free to develop his road engines.<br>
<br>Building on the success of his agricultural model, Foden and his sons concentrated their efforts on the production of a road steamer. The first four prototypes were built by 1900, the last of which, a 3 ton vehicle with horizontal boiler, defeated ten other engines in trials by the War Office in 1901, again gaining praise for its performance and manoeuvrability.<br>
<br>Despite such acclaim Foden was aware that his family business was inadequate to cope with the necessary expansion and modernization. To raise capital, in 1901 he formed a new company, Fodens Ltd, with himself as managing director and a business colleague, Cecil Brunner, as chairman. His two sons were joined on the board by two more brothers, former Elworth customers. Over the next ten years the firm's profits rose fivefold. Foden's first wife died in 1893, and the following year he married Annie Cowap (1868&#150;1939). There were two daughters and one surviving son from the second marriage.<br>
<br>By 1910 Edwin Foden's health was in steady decline, and he died from cancer on 31 August 1911 at his home, Elworth House, Bradwall, near Sandbach, Cheshire. His cort&egrave;ge was led by the Foden Motor Works Band, which he had helped to found, playing his favourite Methodist hymns. His younger son, Edwin Richard Foden, founded ERF, the truck manufacturers, in 1933.<br>
