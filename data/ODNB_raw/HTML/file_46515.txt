<span class="headword">Vernon,  Henry</span>, styled Baron Powys  (1548&#150;1606), <span class="occ">landowner and peerage claimant</span>, was born on Christmas day 1548, the elder son of Thomas Vernon (<i>d</i>. 1557), of Stokesay, Shropshire, and his wife, Dorothy Lovel. His grandfather Thomas's marriage to Anne Ludlow, a coheir to the estate founded in the late thirteenth century by the famous wool merchant Lawrence of Ludlow, led to Henry's inheriting substantial Shropshire properties, and also a claim to greater eminence in the barony of Powys, founded on the belief that his maternal great-grandmother Elizabeth, wife of John Ludlow, was the daughter of Richard Grey, first Baron Grey of Powys. The death of Edward Grey, the fourth baron, without a legitimate heir in 1551 had led to Henry Vernon's father and uncle suing in chancery for the Powys lands and title; Henry himself devoted most of his adult life to the same cause. The records of this extended lawsuit, along with the survival of personal papers, help to make him one of the best-documented men of his rank from the Elizabethan age.<br>
<br>Aged nine when his father died in 1557, Henry Vernon was probably given into the custody of his grandfather, who died in 1562. On 15 November 1564 his wardship and marriage were granted to the countess of Rutland. He entered the Middle Temple on 31 October 1568, and came of age on 25 December 1569. No later than September 1571 he had relaunched his father's bid to secure the barony of Powys. As far as the lands were concerned he faced the problem that the fourth baron had made a series of settlements entailing most of his estates on his illegitimate son Edward Grey. Vernon's response was undeniably imaginative, a bizarre story (which became ever more elaborate as time passed) that the last document had been quite literally signed and sealed posthumously, when conspirators acting for Grey had opened his father's coffin as it lay at Buildwas and manipulated the dead man's hand so as to obtain a signature and a seal on a blank sheet of parchment, on which a conveyance had then been drawn up. As well as discrediting Grey's claim Vernon also had to prove his own, by providing satisfactory evidence that his ancestor Elizabeth Ludlow had indeed been Richard Grey's daughter. His attempts to do so provoked counter-allegations of forgery, possibly justified&#151;he was said to have tried to strengthen his case by adding inscriptions to family tombs.<br>
<br>Vernon enjoyed an early success about 1574 when he secured the manor of Pontesbury in the bench; but thereafter constant litigation, both at county assizes and in the Westminster courts, though it aroused strong feelings in the west midlands, and provoked two successive days of rioting at Bridgnorth in 1577, brought him little but frustration. Baron Burghley referred Vernon's claim to the heralds, who found nothing to support it. In 1578 the issue was farcically complicated when it transpired that important documents in the keeping of Sir John Throckmorton had been nibbled by mice and the missing words later written in, enabling Vernon to make further allegations of forgery on Grey's behalf. But though his negligence cost Throckmorton 1000 marks and led to one of his subordinates losing his post, their offence hardly affected the issue. Vernon persevered, however, and made his greatest effort in 1590 when he appealed directly to the queen for recognition of his title. Elizabeth referred the case to the justices while Vernon, hopeful of success, on 22 October 1590 signed a deed styling himself cousin and heir of the late Lord Powys. But the justices sent the case to Star Chamber, where it had already been heard several times, and Vernon's hopes faded.<br>
<br>Possibly to build up an estate appropriate to a peerage title, Vernon bought four Herefordshire manors, paying &pound;5500 for them between 1578 and 1581. The move proved unfortunate, for the vendors were in debt to the crown and by 1582 the manors had been taken into the queen's hands, reducing Vernon to trying to lease them from the crown. The costs of litigation were substantial, as were those of a lavish lifestyle. His account books show that he expected to dress well, purchasing such finery as a damask cloak with a velvet collar and &#145;a new taffeta hat with a bugle band and a black sprig in it&#146; as well as a brush for his beard  (TNA: PRO, SP 46/59, fol. 262). He usually travelled with a page and a handful of liveried attendants, but on 24 September 1583 he had a retinue of twenty-four men as he waited at Bewdley for the earl of Leicester (who did not come). He spent money on jewellery, gifts to musicians and paupers, books (in 1576 he bought Richard Edwards's <span class="italic">Paradise of Dainty Devices</span> and an account of the Spanish destruction of Antwerp), and food, some of it exotic&#151;on 15 February 1583 he spent 2<i>d</i>. on &#145;potata roots&#146;  (ibid., fol. 321). Inevitably he borrowed frequently, and was several times rumoured to be financially stretched. In 1584 it was claimed that he was &#145;greatly in debt bothe by statute and otherwise and had solde much of his lande&#146;, an allegation Vernon angrily denied, asserting that his estate was worth at least &pound;100 &#145;more than discended to him from his father or grandfather&#146;  (TNA: PRO, REQ 2/136/34).<br>
<br>Disaster struck just when Vernon made his greatest effort. By Michaelmas 1591 he was in the Fleet, having backed a bond of &pound;2000 for his cousin Francis Curzon of Kedleston. Curzon failed to pay and his creditors descended on his surety. While in prison Vernon received visits from a woman named Ursula Tey who claimed to be his wife. She was rumoured to be married to another man, and the warden of the Fleet was ordered to ensure &#145;that she slypp not to him in the house at any tyme disguised in man's apparell, as yt is likely she will, being the woman she is suspected to be&#146;  (<span class="italic">APC</span>, <i>1591</i>, 468&#150;9). Late in 1592 Vernon obtained his release and subsequently married Ursula, but his fortunes never recovered. Overwhelmed by debts, in December 1596 he mortgaged Stokesay, subsequently obtaining the money to redeem the mortgage and pay his other debts by undertaking to sell the manor to Sir George Mainwaring. Vernon later tried to renege on the deal but on 11 July 1598 the sale went ahead, for &pound;6000. In February 1597 he had sold Pontesbury for &pound;1600 and a few days later conveyed Westbury, part of his inheritance, to his cousin Robert Vernon of Hodnet.<br>
<br>By March 1599 Vernon was living in the Savoy, London, whence he claimed that Mainwaring owed him &pound;3000; perhaps it was to settle this claim that on 4 March 1600 Mainwaring agreed to pay Vernon and his wife an annuity of &pound;240. It was not much on which to keep up appearances (Vernon pertinaciously styled himself Lord Powys) and fend off creditors, and in Trinity term following he was outlawed for a debt of &pound;400. Ursula seems to have died at the end of 1605, and by the following summer Vernon was living in Stoke Newington. He died there on 28 July 1606, having made a nuncupative will a few hours earlier, leaving all his worldly goods to one Peter Brambile, possibly his landlord; with perhaps characteristic panache he had declared that &#145;if they were a kingdom they were too little&#146;  (TNA: PRO, PROB 11/110, no. 69). Litigation against Brambile by Vernon's next-of-kin John Curzon followed, unsuccessfully. In 1609 Robert Vernon allowed Edward Grey, son of Henry Vernon's opponent, to buy him out of his claim to the Powys lands; claims to the barony resurfaced at intervals for centuries.<br>
