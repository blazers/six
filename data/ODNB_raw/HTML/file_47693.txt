<span class="headword">Gott,  John William</span>  (1866&#150;1922), <span class="occ">freethought propagandist</span>, was born at Cowling, Yorkshire, on 17 January 1866, the son of John Gott (<i>b</i>. 1841/2), farm labourer, and his wife, Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Peel (<i>b</i>. 1842/3), house servant, both of Cowling. Little is known of his childhood. By 1891 he was a self-employed tailor and draper in Bradford where, through aggressive advertising in freethought and socialist periodicals, he built a successful mail-order business, employing as local agents men whose participation in unpopular movements had resulted in their dismissal from regular work. On 3 January that year he married Ada Dyson (1869&#150;1912), weaver. There was one child of the marriage, Alice (<i>b</i>. 1893).<br>
<br>Gott had joined the National Secular Society under the presidency of George William Foote in 1887, and in March 1891 he became secretary of the revived Bradford branch of the society. In May 1894 he was business manager of the <span class="italic">Truth Seeker</span>, a local penny monthly freethought periodical. By 1900 he was editor, publisher, and proprietor of what was now a strongly anti-Christian paper that appeared intermittently until at least 1915. The attempt to revive secularism in Bradford in the 1890s was unsuccessful as new organizations were succeeded by others equally short-lived. Gott was central to most of them as secretary or treasurer. In 1903 he was summonsed five times and convicted once for selling freethought and other radical literature on a Sunday on Woodhouse Moor, Leeds, contrary to local by-laws, and was charged with blasphemy for a cartoon reprinted in the <span class="italic">Truth Seeker</span> for October, but the stipendiary magistrate dismissed this case on a technicality. This was the beginning of a propagandist war of attrition by a group of militant freethinkers which was to lead during the next few years to several blasphemy prosecutions. Gott's role was primarily as publisher, through his Freethought Socialist League, an organization formed about 1909 to combat the Liberal tendencies of G. W. Foote's secularism and the Christian tendencies of Keir Hardie's socialism. In 1911 he was prosecuted for blasphemy for publishing a pamphlet of crude anti-Christian questions entitled <span class="italic">Rib Ticklers, or, Questions for Parsons</span>, and was sentenced to four months in Armley gaol, Leeds. On 16 February 1912 his wife, Ada, suffered a stroke and died. The home secretary immediately ordered his release, but the circumstances of Ada's death added a personal edge to Gott's campaign.<br>
<br>In 1913 Gott was funding an anti-Christian lecture campaign, in November 1916 he was sentenced to two weeks' hard labour at Birkenhead police court for selling a profane book, and in July 1917 he was sentenced at the Birmingham assizes to six weeks' hard labour for blasphemous libel, again in the <span class="italic">Rib Ticklers</span>. On this occasion, the unsuccessful defence was led by Norman Birkett. In July 1918 Gott appeared before the Westminster police court charged under the <span class="roman">Defence of the Realm Act</span> with exhibiting a poster, for which he was fined &pound;25 or two months' imprisonment, and in 1921 he was sentenced at the Birmingham assizes to six months' hard labour for blasphemous libel for publishing and sending through the post an obscene book, <span class="italic">How to Prevent Pregnancy</span>, and also again the <span class="italic">Rib Ticklers</span>. Shortly after release he was summoned before West Ham police court on a charge of obstruction, later changed to blasphemy, for selling the <span class="italic">Rib Ticklers</span> and similar publications. The case was heard at the Old Bailey in December 1921 where, after a retrial, he was found guilty and received nine months with hard labour. An appeal in January 1922 confirmed the sentence. This was the last time that anyone in Britain was imprisoned for blasphemy. Gott emerged in broken health and died at Victoria Hospital, Blackpool, of cancer of the pancreas, stomach, and liver, on 4 November 1922, survived by his daughter, Alice. He was buried on 8 November 1922 in Bradford.<br>
<br>Gott was a provocative agitator, yet he aroused considerable support among MPs, academics, and writers for a liberalization of the law in England and Wales, leading to unsuccessful campaigns to abolish the blasphemy laws. The works for which he was imprisoned seemed harmless a century later.<br>
