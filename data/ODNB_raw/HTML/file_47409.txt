<span class="headword">Gifford,  John</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1655), <span class="occ">Independent minister</span>, was best known as the minister who inspired John Bunyan, author of <span class="italic">The Pilgrim's Progress</span>. Nothing is known about Gifford's birthplace or parentage, but his arrival in Bedford, conversion, and ministry are described in &#145;A brief account of the 1st gathering of the Church of Christ at Bedford&#146; included in the modern edition of the minutes of the church.<br>
<br>Gifford, the account records, was a Kentish man who served as a major in the king's army during the civil war and was taken prisoner by Fairfax's forces after fighting at Rochester in 1648. He was condemned to die but escaped, with the help of his sister and divine intervention, first to London then to Bedford, only to embark on a life of debauchery while he practised as a physician. He would later recall his murderous fantasies against &#145;brother Harrington, meerly from that great antipathy that was in his heart against the people of God and the holyness of the Gospell&#146;  (Tibbutt, 16). His conversion is recorded as following a conventional pattern. After losing heavily at gambling and having &#145;desperate thoughtes against God&#146;, Gifford was convinced of his sinfulness by reading a holy book by a Mr Bolton  (ibid.). He subsequently sought the acquaintance of a group of puritan believers in Bedford who shared a dislike for &#145;the bishops and their superstitions&#146;  (ibid., 15) but had not yet separated from the open communion of the parish. These included John Grew, John Eston, and Anthony Harrington. Initial scepticism among the godly about Gifford's conversion from sinner to believer was overcome by his skill as a preacher. It is recorded that he made a convert, Sister Cooper, during his first public sermon.<br>
<br>Gifford was a prime mover in organizing the Bedford puritans into a gathered church and was chosen as its first pastor in 1650 by his eleven fellow &#145;foundation stones&#146;, three men and eight women. The unprecedented religious freedoms of the 1650s, under the Commonwealth and protectorate, allowed this collective or congregational church to enjoy a brief period of toleration. In 1653 Gifford, who had never been ordained, was admitted to the mastership of the hospital and rectory of the church of St John the Baptist in Bedford.<br>
<br>The only extant writing by Gifford is a letter sent to his congregation from his deathbed in 1655. The letter exhorts the faithful to avoid divisive arguments and disputes about matters like baptism, psalm singing, or &#145;any externalls&#146;, to follow the scriptures, and to &#145;submit to one another in love&#146;  (Tibbutt, 19). It also rejects discrimination on the basis of wealth or social status, advocates that leading members of the church act as examples in their &#145;faith, love and zeale&#146;, and reminds the congregation of the need for orderly behaviour  (ibid., 20). Gifford's letter was traditionally read aloud to the congregation on new year's day until the twentieth century, including the more turbulent times of persecution under the Restoration regime.<br>
<br>Gifford's ecumenism and insistence on equality and order may have influenced the thinking of his most famous successor as minister of the Bedford church, John Bunyan, who had been baptized and made a full member of the church just before Gifford's death. After Gifford's death the congregation nominated John Burton as minister, and after pressure was put on the mayor and corporation by Oliver Cromwell he was granted the living of St John the Baptist. Burton was in turn succeeded by Bunyan in 1672.<br>
<br>There is little evidence of Gifford's life or family. He died on 21 September 1655 and was buried in St John the Baptist Church, having made a will on 2 August. His will designated his &#145;loving wife&#146; Margaret as his sole executrix and established bequests to each of three children: to his eldest daughter, Mary, &pound;55 on the day of her marriage or at the age of twenty-one, to his daughter Elizabeth &pound;50 on the same conditions, and &pound;50 to a child as yet unborn. This child was born the following year and named Martha. Gifford also seems to have had a son who died before him: a register in St Paul's Church in Bedford records the burial of John, son of John Gifford, on 30 June 1651.<br>
