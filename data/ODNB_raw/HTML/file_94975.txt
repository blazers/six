<span class="headword">Crowther,  James Gerald</span>  (1899&#150;1983), <span class="occ">science journalist and administrator</span>, was born at 6 Westfield, Hipperholme, Halifax, Yorkshire, on 26 September 1899, the second child and first son of James Crowther (<i>b</i>. 1866), principal of a technical school, and his wife, Alice, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Ainscow (<i>b</i>. 1870), both of Manchester. At Bradford grammar school in 1917 he gained an exhibition to study mathematics and physics at Trinity College, Cambridge. The award was suspended for the duration of the war, and he worked instead on anti-aircraft guns under the physiologist A. V. Hill. He began his studies at Trinity in 1919, but after failing to change course from mathematics to history of science, he abandoned Cambridge after one term.<br>
<br>Crowther made a bare living in temporary teaching posts, and became involved with a left-wing educational group, through which he became interested in the politics of the Soviet Union. He joined the Communist Party in 1923. He also became acquainted with scientific and educational publishing houses, and in 1924 he joined Oxford University Press as technical books representative, a post that required much travel, in the United Kingdom and overseas, to universities and scientific meetings. Despite being a shy man with a formal manner, he thus met and befriended many influential people in science. On 11 June 1924, at St Pancras register office, he married Dora Amy Royle de Bude (<i>b</i>. 1889/90), a school matron from London who was the daughter of Frederick de Bude, colonel in the Royal Artillery. Crowther became stepfather to her six-year-old daughter.<br>
<br>Crowther lamented what he called the public's &#145;deep ignorance&#146; of science, and looked for ways to disseminate science to non-scientists. He urged publishers to start a popular journal for science, but was rewarded only with a few small commissions for articles. In 1925 he devised a &#145;science page&#146; for the BBC's magazine <span class="italic">Radio Times</span>, and offered himself to the BBC as the page's editor. The <span class="italic">Radio Times</span> typeset a sample page, but decided not to publish it. Crowther also proposed a &#145;science bureau&#146; for the BBC, which would gather up the science broadcasting that was scattered across the BBC and develop it into talks and series aimed at audiences of particular levels of education. He offered himself as its manager. The suggestion was not taken up by the BBC, though it did secure him attention, and he was invited to give some radio talks in 1928. The BBC had previously only used working scientists to give talks on their specialist subject, rather than professional popularizers like Crowther. Although his broadcasting style was considered rather dull by some, it was appreciated by many, and he gave talks&#151;over forty in all&#151;on BBC radio until the early 1970s.<br>
<br>Crowther's search for opportunities to disseminate science was more immediately successful at the <span class="italic">Manchester Guardian</span> newspaper, where he first published in 1926. He persuaded the editor, C. P. Scott, to hire him; his column, which began in 1928, was widely read and much respected among scientists. During his work for Oxford University Press, Crowther had established a close relationship with the physicists of the Cavendish Laboratory at Cambridge University, on which he now drew. By attending an internal seminar at the Cavendish, he scored an important journalistic scoop when in 1932 he broke the news of James Chadwick's discovery there of the neutron. He acted as unofficial press agent for the Cavendish for some time.<br>
<br>Through these activities Crowther identified science journalism as a distinct specialism. Where before, general journalists reported science among many other topics, or scientists wrote articles about their research, now there existed a new specialist&#151;the science journalist&#151;who was recognized and hired by media institutions.<br>
<br>Crowther also wrote a large number of books, the earliest of which were accessible accounts of the physical sciences. The scope of these books soon expanded to include the history of science and biographies of scientists and inventors, and his analysis of and prognosis for the social relations of science. He visited the Soviet Union many times between 1929 and 1936, building on contacts made during his teaching years, and also on his friendship with the Russian physicist Pyotr Kapitsa, who was working at the Cavendish Laboratory. Crowther was welcomed in Russia by state officials who wanted to encourage international support for Soviet science. When the Soviets sent a delegation to the Second International Congress of the History of Science and Technology, which took place in London in June 1931, Crowther acted as liaison for the visitors, among whom were the Soviet politician and Marxist theoretician Nikolay Bukharin and the physicist Boris Hessen. Hessen made a profound impact on the congress with his historical exposition of the social and political context from which Newton's <span class="italic">Principia</span> had emerged, presaging a new era in historical studies of science. At the congress Crowther also introduced the Russians to leading left-wing thinkers among British scientists, including the crystallographer J. D. Bernal and the biochemist Joseph Needham, whom he knew well from the influential <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/95704', "Tots and Quots")</script>, a dining club and science think-tank. Crowther became confirmed in the belief that a planned socialist society was necessary if science and scientists were to flourish; and also that scientists should contribute to the organization and planning of society.<br>
<br>Although the exact nature of Crowther's involvement with the Soviet Union is not clear, he did have a number of friends there by the mid-1930s. However, many of them were to disappear during Stalin's purges. Kapitsa was prevented from returning to England after a visit to Russia in 1935, and Hessen was arrested and shot in 1936. While Crowther's commitment to the Soviet Union waned, his socialist convictions remained firm, and his writings on the social and political aspects of science continued to attract attention. Influential among these works were <span class="italic">The Social Relations of Science</span> (1941) and <span class="italic">Science in Modern Society</span> (1967).<br>
<br>Crowther's first marriage having ended, he married Francisca Mendelssohn, a German who had come to Britain in 1933 with her brother, the physicist Kurt Mendelssohn.<br>
<br>Crowther was active in the British Association for the Advancement of Science, in its division for the social and international relations of science, which was founded in 1938 and supported and pursued his aim to develop science journalism. With the outbreak of war in 1939 he was appointed to the British Council, as the first director of its new science department. He believed that the council should encourage co-operation between differing nations and political systems, and that science could serve as a common language in which this co-operation could be achieved. To this end he returned to his lobbying of the BBC; and while the BBC remained aloof from such political overtures, he had some success in increasing the science content of the BBC's Overseas Service. He was also responsible for the British Council's contribution to aid and resettlement for scientists displaced by the Nazi regime in Europe. One product of this activity was the Anglo-French Society of Sciences, through which he explored his ideas about science as a means for international relations. With Needham, in 1942, he also directed the council's establishment of a British cultural scientific office in China, a move that also supported Needham's classic historical work <span class="italic">Science and Civilisation in China</span>, published from 1954.<br>
<br>Crowther can also be credited with the British Council's involvement in the establishment of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), which was founded in 1945. The inclusion of science in UNESCO's remit was due to a public campaign by Crowther, Needham, and the biologist Julian Huxley. Despite these successes, Crowther's pursuit of this political use of science distanced him from some parts of the British scientific and political establishment, and the influence of the council in national scientific affairs declined after the war. Crowther resigned from the council in 1946.<br>
<br>Crowther's criticism of the deployment of the atomic bomb in 1945 also marginalized him in the scientific community, and soured his relationship with the <span class="italic">Manchester Guardian</span>. He was still active in radical science politics, particularly in his work for the World Federation of Scientific Workers, for which he drafted the first constitution. He held the post of secretary-general of the federation from its founding in 1946 until 1954. In 1947 he was one of five founding members of the Association of British Science Writers.<br>
<br>Crowther was critical of what he saw as the corruption of science under capitalism, and remained committed to the socialist ideal. During the 1960s he was highly respected by a younger generation of left-wing scientists who were exploring the social relations of science. His writings informed the emerging academic field in this area. He remained active as a journalist, for example in supporting <span class="italic">New Scientist</span> magazine through a period of financial insecurity and editorial realignment in the late 1960s and early 1970s: he was particularly influential in the magazine's campaigns on the social and political issues in science. He also continued to advise scientific publishers, and maintained a close relationship with Oxford University Press throughout his life. He published a memoir, <span class="italic">Fifty Years with Science</span>, in 1970.<br>
<br>In their later years Crowther and his wife lived frugally in Bloomsbury, London, and in a small cottage Crowther had inherited at Flamborough Head, Yorkshire. He died at the East Riding General Hospital, Driffield, Yorkshire, on 30 March 1983 from bronchial pneumonia and dementia. An investigation into Francisca Crowther's disappearance shortly after her husband's death concluded that she had thrown herself into the sea from cliffs near their home.<br>
<br>When Crowther was awarded an honorary doctorate of the University of York in 1981, the citation read &#145;for creating the profession of scientific correspondent, for scholarly contributions to the history of science and to the social aspects of science, and for acting as a healthy irritant to the scientific establishment for 60 years&#146;. This remains an appropriate summary of the achievements of J. G. Crowther, who made a pioneering and substantial contribution to creating a public sphere for science in the United Kingdom and more widely, and to fostering critical discussion of the social and political dimensions of science.<br>
