<span class="headword">Marshall,  James</span>  (1796&#150;1855), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, was born at Rothesay, Bute, on 23 February 1796, the son of Hugh Marshall, a doctor, and his wife, Elizabeth Wilson. When Dr Marshall died, in 1806, the family removed to Paisley. James was educated at Paisley grammar school and subsequently at the universities of Glasgow and Edinburgh. On 2 September 1818 he was licensed to preach by the presbytery of Glasgow, and after assisting his mother's friend Dr Robert Balfour at the Outer High Church, Glasgow, succeeded to Balfour's charge at his death in 1819. Marshall married in 1822 Catherine Mary, daughter of Legh Richmond, rector of Turvey, Bedfordshire. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18139/', "Sir James Marshall (1829&#150;1889)")</script>, convert to Rome and colonial judge, was their son. In 1828 Marshall was appointed by the Edinburgh town council to the Tolbooth Church, Edinburgh. Marshall was an effective preacher, and as a young man he attracted the favourable notice of Thomas Chalmers in that capacity. His calm demeanour in the pulpit strikingly contrasted with the vehemence commonly characteristic of the Scottish clergy.<br>
<br>Although for some years Marshall generally sympathized with the opponents of the establishment in the controversy which led to the Disruption in 1843, he disliked the extremities to which what became the Free Church party seemed to be committing itself. Ultimately he embraced episcopacy, which (encouraged perhaps by his wife's family) he had convinced himself was the only scriptural form of church government, and severed his connection with the Scottish church. He sent his resignation to the presbytery of Edinburgh on 29 September 1841, and, after being confirmed by the bishop of Edinburgh, was ordained on 19 December 1841 by the bishop of Durham as curate to Canon Gilly at Norham. He took priest's orders on 6 February 1842, and was appointed to the rectory of St Mary-le-Port, Bristol. In 1845 Marshall became secretary to the newly founded Lay Readers' Association, which he energetically developed for many years. In May 1847 he was appointed by the Simeon trustees to the living of Christ Church, Clifton, which he held until his death.<br>
<br>Marshall published, besides sermons and addresses, <span class="italic">Inward Revival, or, Motives and Hindrances to Advancement in Holiness</span> (1840) and <span class="italic">Early Piety Illustrated in the Life and Death of a Young Parishioner</span> (n.d.), both of which had a large circulation. He also edited <span class="italic">The Letters of the Late Mrs Isabella Graham of New York</span> (1839), his aunt. After three years' ill health Marshall died on 29 August 1855 at his house in Vyvyan Terrace, Clifton, and was buried on 4 September in the Clifton parish church burial-ground.<br>
