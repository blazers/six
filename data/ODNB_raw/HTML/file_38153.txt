<span class="headword">Worsley,  Benjamin</span>  (1617/18&#150;1677), <span class="occ">physician and projector</span>, was the eldest son of Francis Worsley of Kenton, Warwickshire, and his wife, Mary, daughter of Shipman Hopkins of Coventry. He was probably brought up in London. The only certain detail concerning his formal education is his admission as a pensioner at Trinity College, Dublin, in 1643 at the late age of twenty-five. He claimed to possess a degree from Trinity College. He entered public service under Thomas Wentworth, first earl of Strafford, lord lieutenant of Ireland, and was in 1643 surgeon-general in the army in Ireland.<br>
<br>Worsley's career as a projector began in 1646 when his scheme for the manufacture of saltpetre attracted attention, primarily on account of its value for gunpowder production. He capitalized on this opportunity by making the saltpetre project the centrepiece of a programme for revitalization of the British economy and the development of an integrated manufacturing and trading system embracing an expanding colonial empire. He published little, but elaborations of his proposals for the exploitation of technical innovation and the regulation of trade are found in abundance in such archives as the Hartlib papers and Shaftesbury papers, and his views were seriously regarded, even though his reputation suffered as a result of a bitter controversy with William Petty.<br>
<br>At first Worsley was ahead of Petty. In 1646 his saltpetre scheme impressed the young Robert Boyle and brought patronage from Boyle and his sister, Lady Ranelagh. Worsley was the prime mover in the Invisible College established at this time&#151;a group of intellectuals exchanging ideas by correspondence, motivated by utopian aspirations, and particularly engaged in promoting science and technology. This agency brought him into association with Samuel Hartlib. Worsley was reappointed surgeon-general to the army in Ireland in 1647, but seems not to have taken up the post. Between 1647 and 1649 he was based in the Netherlands, where he acted as a major source of intelligence on economic and scientific affairs. In 1649 his hopes revolved around a scheme for developing the economy of Virginia. With the promise of a situation in America he returned to England and his efforts contributed to the council of state's decision to establish a council of trade, presided over by Sir Henry Vane the younger, a patron of Worsley's. The council's main achievement was the 1651 <span class="roman">Navigation Act</span>, of which Worsley claimed to have been &#145;the first sollicitour&#146;. He also wrote at this time <span class="italic">The Advocate</span> (1652), in defence of the act, and a related economic tract, <span class="italic">Free Ports</span> (1652).<br>
<br>Renewed prospects opened up for preferment in Ireland. Between 1651 and 1653 Worsley served as secretary to the commissioners in Ireland and commissioner-general for the revenue, and then, having failed to be selected to join the embassy to Sweden, he returned to Ireland as surveyor-general of forfeited estates. He remained in this post until 1658, but the real work was undertaken by Petty, for whom Worsley developed a deep jealousy. Petty responded with venom in his history of what became known as the &#145;down survey&#146;. Having failed as surveyor-general, Worsley made an unsuccessful attempt in 1659 to secure the Post Office farm surrendered by John Thurloe. His tenuous hold on office was reduced to his positions as justice of the peace in Queen's county and commissary-general of musters. In 1656 he married Lucy, daughter of William Cary of Dartmouth, Devon.<br>
<br>After the Restoration, Worsley, who was living in Tuthill Fields, was inhibited from his more radical schemes for social and religious reform. He played no part in the newly founded Royal Society or the College of Physicians, although at this time he began to describe himself as an MD. He concentrated on economic issues, especially on American colonial affairs. Repeating the pattern of 1650, in 1660 he was involved in the establishment of the council of trade. He continued to write on general policy questions, but he also tried to turn his knowledge to profit. For instance, in 1666 he was granted a licence for the cultivation of senna in the plantations. The continuing strength of his reputation is witnessed by his involvement between 1668 and 1673 in the revival of the committees involved with trade and plantations. After serving as a commissioner of trade between 1668 and 1669, he was appointed assistant secretary of the council of foreign plantations in 1670, and in September 1672 he was promoted to the post of secretary and treasurer of the council of trade and foreign plantations, under the presidency of his patron Anthony Ashley Cooper, first earl of Shaftesbury. He resigned on account of the <span class="roman">Test Act</span> in September 1673, being succeeded by John Locke. A catalogue of his fine library was published in 1678, revealing a huge collection of nonconformist, and especially Socinian, religious literature. Worsley died in 1677.<br>
