<span class="headword">Penrose,  Francis</span>  (1718&#150;1798), <span class="occ">medical writer</span>, was a surgeon who practised for many years at Bicester, Oxfordshire. He bought property in the nearby village of Chesterton, and later bought Chesterton Lodge, which he greatly improved. The estate was sold after his death. Penrose was chiefly remembered in the area for his attempt to investigate the ruins of Alchester in Wendlebury, the Roman station at the junction of two roads adjoining Chesterton. There, in a wood on the west side of the castrum, he discovered in 1766 the remains of a large building, within which were a tesselated pavement and a hypocaust. This building he described as the Praetorium. Penrose left Bicester about 1782, and went to live in Stonehouse, Devon, but did not practise there.<br>
<br>Penrose was a prolific writer of pamphlets on scientific subjects related to medicine. His works do not, as a rule, repay perusal. He wrote <span class="italic">A Treatise on Electricity</span> (1752), and <span class="italic">An Essay on Magnetism</span> (1753). His <span class="italic">Physical Essay on the Animal Economy</span>, in which old physiological theories were revived, was published in 1754. His essay on the putrid sore throat and putrid fever, published in 1766, was a practical treatise, in which he recorded cases he had seen in his practice. His Newtonian <span class="italic">Letters Philosophical and Astronomical</span>, on &#145;the creation, the deluge, vegetation, the make and form of this terraqueous globe&#146; was published in 1789. The letters were originally written to John Heaviside (1747/8&#150;1828), and were dated from Stonehouse in 1783. The critical reviews in December 1788 said of them that &#145;the Mosaic account of the creation is here explained and defended, as well as the deluge, and gravity is accounted for by hot and cold ether&#146;. Penrose's <span class="italic">Essays ... Founded on the ... Chemistry of Lavoisier, Fourcroy ...</span> (1794) was severely handled in the first volume of the <span class="italic">Medical and Chirurgical Review</span> (1795). On the title-page he describes himself as MD for the first time; he is supposed to have obtained the degree at a German university.<br>
<br>Penrose's son, James Penrose (1750&#150;1818), was appointed surgeon-extraordinary to George III in November 1793, in succession to John Hunter (1728&#150;1793). Francis Penrose died in his son's house at Hatfield, Hertfordshire, on 17 January 1798. Both father and son were buried in the churchyard at Hatfield, but no trace of their tombstone exists.<br>
