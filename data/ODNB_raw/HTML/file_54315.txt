<span class="headword">Rossy,  Thomas</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1397<span class="mult">x</span>1406), <span class="occ">theologian and bishop of Whithorn</span>, is first recorded in 1371 as a Scottish Franciscan, whom Pope Gregory XI ordered the chancellor of Paris to allow to study for the degree of BTh. He was already an experienced scholar and had spent seven years in England when in 1373 he lectured at Paris on the Immaculate Conception of the Virgin Mary; his lectures survive and show him to have been possessed of considerable theological and canonistic learning. In 1375 he was appointed vicar-general of the Franciscan order in Scotland and in 1378 (by now with the degree of DTh) papal penitentiary for the English and Irish tongues. Sent as an envoy to Scotland by the Avignon pope Clement VII on 15 July 1379, he was provided to the see of Whithorn on the same day&#151;the only Franciscan to become a Scottish bishop. Although he was probably consecrated in 1380, he had to overcome the resistance of the prior of Glenluce (who had been elected by the Whithorn chapter), but in October 1381 he paid some of his services into the papal chamber and was secure in his see thereafter.<br>
<br>Rossy became closely involved in both papal and national politics. He was an ardent advocate of the Clementist cause in the schism which began in 1378&#151;no doubt this was the subject of the sermon he delivered before Robert II on 2 February 1380, as well as of other sermons which he preached at the heart of the kingdom and on the Anglo-Scottish marches. These addresses formed the basis of his highly partisan treatise on the schism, completed in the late 1380s. It was accompanied by an open letter to the English bishops, in which he offered to debate with them on the border or even, in response to a challenge reportedly made to him by an English priest, to settle the matter by single combat. No response is known to have been forthcoming. Rossy had apparently not lost his theological interests, however, for he was described as having preached at Scone on 16 August 1390, two days after the coronation of Robert III, in the character of a &#145;theolog solempne&#146;. Little is known about him as a diocesan, but on 16 July 1381 he appropriated Buittle church by charter to Sweetheart Abbey, and as bishop of Whithorn he presented a long roll of petitions to Clement VII in December of the same year. He is also reported to have been at Whithorn in 1387. Back at Avignon in 1395, he was licensed to visit his diocese for three years by deputy; on 6 September 1397 he was still at Avignon. It is not known whether he returned to Scotland or when he died. His successor at Whithorn was appointed on 28 May 1406.<br>
