<span class="headword">Crowley, Sir  Ambrose</span>  (1658&#150;1713), <span class="occ">ironmaster</span>, was born in Stourbridge, Worcestershire, on 1 February 1658, the only son of Ambrose Crowley (<i>bap</i>. 1635, <i>d</i>. 1720) and his first wife, Mary Hall (<i>d</i>. in or after 1658), the daughter of Thomas Hall of Bromsgrove, Worcestershire. His father, a Quaker, started out at Stourbridge as a semi-literate nailer, but through thrift, application, and considerable business acumen, became a manufacturer of nails on the putting-out system, an ironmonger, and an owner of iron forges. His interests extended to south Wales, where he was a part owner of an ironworks with Major John Hanbury of Pontypool, the inventor of the iron-rolling process used in the manufacture of tin plate.<br>
<br>The younger Ambrose, after serving an apprenticeship with a London ironmonger, became free of the Drapers' Company on 9 July 1684. He immediately became active in London as an independent wholesale ironmonger serving both home and export markets from his warehouses and residence in Thames Street, near the river. When his business outgrew these premises he acquired property in 1704 on the Thames at Greenwich, where he built a wharf, warehouses, and a spacious residence.<br>
<br>At the very start of his business activity Crowley recognized that there was an enormous demand for nails on the south and east coasts, particularly from shipyards, both royal and private. With land transport slow and costly, this market was inconveniently and expensively served by west midland nail makers such as his own father in Worcestershire. However, he saw his opportunity and integrated backwards, acquiring manufacturing premises in co. Durham which had readier access to the shipbuilding market: first at Sunderland (by 1685) and subsequently at Winlaton, near Newcastle upon Tyne. These proving profitable, he strengthened his market position by buying out competing works at nearby Swalwell. During the period 1707&#150;9 his undertakings in co. Durham contained two slitting-mills, two forges, four steel furnaces, many warehouses, and innumerable smithies producing a very wide variety of ironmongery. His naval contracts alone mentioned 108 varieties of nails, plus anchors, screws, bolts, hinges, latches, files, pots, and the like, as well as hemp and pitch presumably obtained in trade.<br>
<br>Crowley supervised operations from his Greenwich warehouse whence he supplied the metropolitan and export markets in particular. For inland distribution he had other warehouses in London and at Blaydon-on-Tyne, Ware in Hertfordshire, Wolverhampton, Walsall, and Stourbridge. The last was also used to buy bar iron for the Durham works, while Blaydon supplied other manufacturers in the north-east with semi-manufactured iron products including steel and iron rods. The firm prospered markedly during the wars of 1689&#150;1713, when it became a major vendor of ironmongery to the Royal Navy.<br>
<br>The sheer size of Crowley's ironworks and his decision to control operations from London caused serious managerial problems. The solution, laid out in the <span class="italic">Law Book of the Crowley Ironworks</span>, was a written constitution for the works, enumerating the duties of the principal officials and clerks. The regulatory framework, built up in the fifteen or so years after 1690, was unique for its time and embodied not only penalties for infringement but also insurance and welfare provisions for the employees.<br>
<br>As a large supplier to the royal dockyards, Crowley was inevitably drawn towards politics. He was a tory, and his associations helped his contracting in the 1680s when he was favoured by the duke of York, lord high admiral, with permission to bring skilled workers from Li&egrave;ge. Crowley was in due course elected member of the London common council (1697&#150;1711), sheriff (1706&#150;7), the office that brought him his knighthood on 1 January 1707, and alderman for Dowgate ward (1711&#150;13). His status was also acknowledged by his selection as master of the important Drapers' Company (1708&#150;9), while his political weight was enhanced by his election in 1713 as MP for Andover. As a major government contractor, he had accumulated over &pound;50,000 in navy bills during the last stages of the War of the Spanish Succession and was one of the key figures in the City consulted by Robert Harley, earl of Oxford, on ways to relieve the government of the burden of such floating debt. Out of these consultations came the plan for the South Sea Company. With its launching in 1711, Crowley's holdings of naval bills and the like could be converted into shares in the new undertaking, of which he became one of the largest shareholders, a director (1711&#150;13), and ultimately deputy governor (1712&#150;13).<br>
<br>To support his activity as wholesale ironmonger and manufacturer, Crowley was necessarily also a merchant in foreign trade. To supply his customers and his own smithies in the north-east, he became a very large importer of Swedish bar iron at Newcastle upon Tyne&#151;possibly the largest in the kingdom. A substantial portion of his ironmongery sales went to exporters, while he himself appears in the London customs records in the late 1690s as an exporter of nails and hardware to New England. During the tory ministerial ascendancy after 1710, the Board of Trade consulted him about both the Baltic iron trade and ways of encouraging exports of English ironwares to the American colonies.<br>
<br>Two of Crowley's half-sisters remained within the Society of Friends on marrying fellow Quakers of the Lloyd family: Sarah to Charles Lloyd of Dolobran; and Mary to Sampson Lloyd, a Birmingham iron-dealer. Mary's son, also Sampson Lloyd, was one of the founders of Lloyds Bank. By contrast, Crowley broke with his father's strong Quaker commitments and had become an Anglican by the time of his marriage, in March 1682, to Mary, daughter of Charles Owen, a Londoner from a Shropshire gentry family. In 1712 Sir Ambrose was named one of the commissioners for building fifty new churches and persuaded that board to give priority to rebuilding the parish church near his property at Greenwich. He died at Greenwich on 7 October 1713 and was buried at the parish church of Mitcham, Surrey. He left portions of &pound;10,000 each to the four of his five daughters still unmarried; John Crowley (1689&#150;1728), his only son and residuary legatee, inherited the business.<br>
<br>Sir Ambrose's children continued their father's tory associations. John, a suspected Jacobite, sat in the House of Commons from 1722 to 1728. Lettice (1692&#150;1718), the second of Sir Ambrose's five daughters to reach marriageable age, married Sir John Hynde Cotton, third baronet, a prominent tory politician; the third, Sarah (1697&#150;1759), married Humphry Parsons, a wealthy brewer and extreme tory lord mayor of London; the fourth, Anne (<i>b</i>. 1699), married Richard Fleming (<i>c</i>.1682&#150;1740), a Hampshire country gentleman and tory MP; and the fifth, Elizabeth (1702&#150;1769), married another tory, the eleventh Baron St John of Bletso.<br>
<br>The firm which Crowley founded was continued by his son John and by his grandsons and lasted well into the reign of Queen Victoria, prospering from all the wars in the century following his death. As a major supplier to the Atlantic export trades, it also gained from the great growth of population, housebuilding, and shipbuilding in the American colonies during the period from 1700 to 1775, engendering orders to the firm for nails and other building hardware. At its height in the second quarter of the eighteenth century, the firm, then worth over &pound;100,000 and employing over one thousand workers, was reputed to be the largest iron-manufacturing concern in Europe. Its exceptional integration and scale made it, in the words of its historian, &#145;a giant in an age of pigmies&#146;  (Flinn, <span class="italic">Men of Iron</span>, 252).<br>
