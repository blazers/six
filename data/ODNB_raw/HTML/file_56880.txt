<span class="headword">Cory,  Annie Sophie</span> <span class="st"> [<em>pseud. </em>Victoria Cross]</span>  (1868&#150;1952), <span class="occ">novelist</span>, was born on 1 October 1868 in Rawalpindi, Punjab, the youngest of the three daughters of Colonel Arthur Cory (<i>bap</i>. 1831, <i>d</i>. 1903), an army officer and later newspaper proprietor, and his wife, Elizabeth Fanny Griffin (1834&#150;1916), daughter of Alfred Griffin (1811&#150;1867), a barrister and landowner; Annie sometimes used her mother's maiden name, calling herself Vivian Cory Griffin. The poet <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35237/', "Adela Florence Nicolson (1865&#150;1904)")</script>, was her middle sister. Her sisters went to school in Richmond, Surrey but there is no evidence that she did. Her father resigned from the army in 1876, becoming editor and co-proprietor of the <span class="italic">Civil and Military Gazette</span> in Lahore until 1882; in 1884 he moved to Karachi to become editor and proprietor of the <span class="italic">Sind Gazette</span>. Annie Sophie matriculated at London University aged nineteen in 1888, but although she passed the intermediate examination in arts as an external student in 1890, partly qualifying herself for a BA pass degree, she did not graduate, either because she failed the final examination or because she abandoned her course of study.<br>
<br>Cory's first traceable publication as Victoria Cross was &#145;Theodora: a Fragment&#146;, which was published by John Lane in the <span class="italic">Yellow Book</span>, 4 (January 1895), an extract from a very daring manuscript novel she had offered him, which was not to appear until 1903, when Walter Scott published it as <span class="italic">Six Chapters from a Man's Life</span>. In August 1895 Lane published <span class="italic">The Woman who Didn't</span> by &#145;Victoria Crosse&#146; in the Keynotes series. Many critics have been misled, as no doubt were some contemporaries, into believing that the book was written as a riposte to Grant Allen's <span class="italic">The Woman who Did</span>, published in the same series in February 1895. In fact it is very different, an account of a brief unconsummated encounter on board ship between an officer in the Indian army and an unhappily married woman, and the title seems to have been a bit of clever marketing. The titillating evocation of sexual desire was to be the main selling point in the fiction of Victoria Cross (as she called herself on the title-page of <span class="italic">Paula: a Sketch from Life</span> (1896), and from then on). The reticence which characterizes <span class="italic">The Woman who Didn't</span> was shaken off in such works as <span class="italic">Anna Lombard</span> (1901), one of her best-sellers (she claimed it had sold 6 million copies by 1928), about an Englishwoman torn between her lust for an Indian and love for an Englishman. She marries them both, and eventually murders her child by the former to save her marriage to the latter. <span class="italic">Five Nights</span> (1908), about a woman's affair with her painter cousin, made Elinor Glyn's <span class="italic">Six Weeks</span> (1907) seem pretty tame. Her books are ostentatiously nonconformist in their attitude to marriage, often have spiritualist or mystical elements, but are dubious about religious conformity. Like many feminists of her generation Cory was a keen anti-vivisectionist (being a patron of the British Union for the Abolition of Vivisection), and she opposed conventional medicine, denouncing the pernicious effects not only of vaccination but also of appendicectomy. Another conspicuous theme is a horror of childbearing, in its effects both on women's bodies and on relationships between men and women. Surviving correspondence with T. Werner Laurie, Cory's main publisher, indicates that her books had very large sales, especially in cheap form, into the early 1920s. Several were dramatized or filmed. Thereafter, although she went on publishing until 1937, her popularity declined. Her work is extraordinarily uneven; it often focuses on the disabling effects of gender roles in a way that is startling for its date. It can be witty, but it can also be pretentious and absurd. Even in the 1930s, by which time her power to shock the conventional had declined, she was capable of producing intermittently fascinating work, such as <span class="italic">A Husband's Holiday</span> (1932), about a prim woman who disguises herself as a coarse one to win her husband back, only to realize that he is not worth it; and the futurist <span class="italic">Martha Brown, MP</span> (1935), set in a world in which women rule and men are dim, shallow, and whining. Her letters indicate that she was convinced of her own greatness; perhaps if she had been less isolated from her contemporaries it might have been better for her work.<br>
<br>Her adult life seems to have been luxurious and peripatetic but almost devoid of friendships outside her family. Her father's death in 1903 was followed in 1904 by the death of her brother-in-law General Nicolson and the suicide of his widow. Cory and her mother set up home with the latter's brother Heneage Mackenzie Griffin (1848&#150;1939), who had made a fortune mining in the USA. They travelled widely, especially after her mother's death in 1916. They were in England during the First World War, but thereafter spent their time in the grand hotels of the Italian lakes and the south of France, mostly at the Riviera Palace Hotel, Menton. Heneage Griffin died in September 1939 and his niece spent the war in Geneva. She died in a nursing home, the Clinica Capitanio, in Milan on 2 August 1952, her novels out of print and forgotten, leaving a large estate to be the subject of litigation between rival claimants.<br>
