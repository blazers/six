<span class="headword">Caird <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Alison]</span>,  (Alice) Mona</span>  (1854&#150;1932), <span class="occ">writer</span>, was born on 24 May 1854 at 34 Pier Street, Ryde, Isle of Wight, to John Alison, an inventor from Midlothian, and Matilda Ann Jane, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Hector. As a child she wrote plays and stories. On 19 December 1877 she married James Alexander Caird (<i>d</i>. 1921), son of Sir James Caird, at Christ Church, Paddington, London. The couple resided at Leyland, Arkwright Road, Hampstead, London, for the remainder of their forty-four-year marriage. Their only child, Alison James Caird, was born at Leyland on 22 March 1884.<br>
<br>At the beginning of her writing career, Caird briefly used the pseudonym G. Noel Hatton, but of the five novels she published between 1883 and 1915, <span class="italic">The Wing of Azrael</span> (1889), <span class="italic">A Romance of the Moors</span> (1891), and <span class="italic">The Daughters of Danaus</span> (1894; repr. 1989), published under her own name, have received the most attention from literary critics. In <span class="italic">A Romance of the Moors</span> she tells the story of Dick Coverdale and his lover, Bessie Saunders. The plot's catalyst involves Dick's meeting Mrs Margaret Ellwood, a widowed London artist who has lost her way on the moor, who introduces the two young people to the idea of independence. She advises Dick and Bessie to reject the traditional ideas about marriage and to marry when they are mature and able to act reasonably and responsibly. In the end Mrs Ellwood encourages Bessie to return to London with her where she can &#145;form other interests; that will bring [her] nearer to Dick, not take [her] farther away from him&#146;. While this novel indicates that women's liberation can sometimes be accomplished peacefully, in <span class="italic">The Wing of Azrael</span> Caird has the main character, Viola Sedley, murder her husband Philip to end a violent marriage. She escapes into the wilderness to avoid prosecution and she must reject her long-time lover, Harry Lancaster, to save him from a destructive association with her. The ideas expressed in these two novels, while poles apart in tone and action, reflect the positions on women's lives which Caird espoused in her non-fictional tracts and essays as well.<br>
<br>In 1897 Caird collected essays which previously had been published in the <span class="italic">North American Review</span>, the <span class="italic">Westminster Review</span>, the <span class="italic">Fortnightly Review</span>, and <span class="italic">Nineteenth Century</span> for her book <span class="italic">The Morality of Marriage and other Essays on the Status and Destiny of Women</span>. Her general ideas are focused on equality for women in marriage and for equal partnerships in the home which will &#145;bring us to the end of the patriarchal system&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Morality of Marriage</span>, 59) which she described as repressive both for men, who were trained to see only &#145;the woman's-sphere and woman's-responsibility condition of things&#146;  (ibid., 53), and for women, whose &#145;best qualities &hellip; will disappear&#146;  (ibid.) if they keep within such a system. Her essays are frequently derisive and she employs irony to make her points about the repressive order of society which cannot separate wives from other types of property. As a progressive thinker, Caird sought legal reforms in childcare and divorce which would improve women's social positions by removing the stigmas of irresponsibility and ignorance. Her views have been the subject of late twentieth-century feminist literary criticism concentrated on how she approached the issue of social change in her fiction and her essays. Her efforts earned her the label of &#145;feminist&#146; in her lifetime and she has been described by John Sutherland as &#145;one of the most aggressive of the New Woman novelists&#146;  (Sutherland, 99). She was also active in the temperance movement, and was an outspoken antivivisectionist, publishing two works on the subject in 1894 and 1896.<br>
<br>Mona Caird died of colon cancer on 4 February 1932 at 34 Woronzow Road, St John's Wood, London, where she had moved some time after her husband's death. At her death her name is given as Henryson Caird, suggesting that her husband had taken this extra surname some time after their marriage. Her probate record indicates that she owned property, Cassencary, at Creetown, Kirkcudbrightshire, Scotland.<br>
