<span class="headword">Lieven <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Benckendorff]</span>,  Dorothea Khristoforovna</span>, Princess Lieven in the Russian nobility  (1785&#150;1857), <span class="occ">political hostess</span>, was born in Riga, Latvia, on 17 December 1785, the daughter of General Christoph von Benckendorff and his wife, Juliane (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Baroness Schilling von Canstatt). Her success in life owed much to her parents' powerful connections at the Russian court. Her father was governor of Riga, and enjoyed the full confidence of Emperor Paul I, while her mother was a childhood friend of the empress, Maria Feodorovna, whom she had accompanied to Russia on her marriage to Paul. It was thanks to the Empress Maria that Dorothea entered the Smolny Institute, Russia's leading school for noble girls, and became a lady-in-waiting at court a year before leaving the classroom.<br>
<br>Dorothea's marriage on 24 February 1800 to Count Khristofor Andreyevich Lieven (1774&#150;1839) was also arranged by the empress: inevitably, it determined much of her subsequent life. Though a much older aristocratic family than the newly ennobled Benckendorffs, the Lievens were also Baltic protestants, with exceptionally strong connections at court. Lieven's mother, Charlotta, was governess of the imperial children and subsequently mistress of the robes. She was the Empress Maria's closest friend and confidante in Russia, and remained close to the younger generation of Romanovs, including the emperors Alexander I and Nicholas I. It was thanks to her influence that her son was an aide-de-camp general by 1798 and head of Paul's military campaign chancellery, the key post linking the monarch to the army. Subsequently he served as minister in Berlin, and then as minister and ambassador in London from 1812 to 1834. It was during this posting that his wife acquired her reputation as a hostess and intriguer.<br>
<br>Dorothea Lieven rapidly made her mark on London society, becoming one of the lady patronesses of the exclusive dances held at Almack's. In this capacity she formed a friendship with Emily, Countess Cowper, the mistress and eventual wife of Palmerston. Devoutly committed to the principle of autocratic government, Madame de Lieven (as she was generally known) was to use her social influence to promote the interests of Russia and the Holy Alliance for the next twenty years. Her extensive family connections at the Russian court&#151;her brother, Alexander von Benckendorff, was the first chief of the so-called &#145;third section and gendarmerie&#146;, the state security police&#151;enabled her to pass the unofficial information she garnered through her salon in London on to the Russian government. In 1818 at the congress of Aix-la-Chapelle she became the mistress of the Austrian chancellor, Metternich: although they met infrequently, they continued a regular political correspondence. Another regular correspondent, Lord Grey, was believed to have been her lover in the 1820s. She claimed to have used her influence with him to secure the foreign secretaryship for Palmerston in 1830, believing that he would provide a pro-Russian voice in the whig cabinet. Palmerston, however, proved a political disappointment to Princess Lieven (that title having been conferred in 1826), and in consequence of a diplomatic incident in 1832 he was held responsible by the princess for the recall of the Lievens to Russia in 1834. On their departure <span class="italic">The Times</span> observed that &#145;there never figured on the Courtly stage a female intriguer more restless, more urgent, more arrogant, more mischievous, more (politically, and therefore we mean it not offensively) odious than this supercilious Ambassadress&#146;. Thereafter Dorothea Lieven was unremitting in her hostility to Palmerston, and after 1838, when she became the mistress of Guizot, derived satisfaction from thwarting his international plans.<br>
<br>Distress at the circumstances of her departure from London was exacerbated in 1835 by the deaths of Princess Lieven's two youngest sons from scarlet fever. Her own inability to adapt to the harsh Russian climate caused her health to deteriorate. She departed for Paris, where she eventually re-established her salon. The liaison with Guizot contributed to a breach with her husband, who died in January 1839. Living in Paris without any official position, she nevertheless remained a significant point of contact between the Russian and French governments, playing a role in the negotiations connected to both the outbreak and the conclusion of the Crimean War. Dorothea Lieven died at home in the rue St Florentin, Paris, on 26 January 1857, and was buried in the Lieven family cemetery at Mesothen, her nephew's estate near Mitrau in Courland.<br>
<br>Dorothea Lieven's sustained influence reflects not just her powerful international connections but also her native wit, charm, and intelligence, all of which were remarkable. Not a deep, still less a warm-hearted, woman, she lived for the world of high politics, and enjoyed to the full her influence and reputation. Her husband's recall to St Petersburg in 1834 was thus a devastating personal blow. Her role, unusual but not unique, was made possible by the context of aristocratic <i>ancien r&eacute;gime</i> Europe, and the intermingling of politics and social life in the diplomatic salons. Of these, none was more famous in the nineteenth century than Dorothea Lieven's, whether in London or Paris. Several of her voluminous correspondences&#151;including those with Metternich, Guizot, Lady Holland, Lady Palmerston, Lord Aberdeen, and Lord Grey&#151;have been published, and are a fine source for historians of early nineteenth-century diplomacy and London political society.<br>
