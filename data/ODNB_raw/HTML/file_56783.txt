<span class="headword">Peel <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Bayliff]</span>,  Constance Dorothy Evelyn</span>  (1868&#150;1934), <span class="occ">journalist and writer on household management</span>, was born on 27 April 1868 at Ganarew, Herefordshire, the seventh of nine children (four of whom died in infancy) of Richard Lane Bayliff, captain in the 100th regiment and adjutant of the Monmouthshire Volunteers, and his wife, Henrietta, daughter of Robert Peel. Constance Bayliff's early childhood was spent in Wyesham, Monmouthshire, in straitened circumstances due to her father's poor health. Following a move to Bristol, she was mainly educated at home by her parents. Her education was constantly interrupted by asthmatic illness and she spent a considerable time convalescing with much wealthier relatives. She moved to Folkestone aged seventeen and came out at a military ball. She recalled that she and her sister &#145;lived what sensible people call an aimless life&#146;, visiting and party-going, which they could ill afford, struggling to &#145;freshen up&#146; their few party dresses  (Peel, 58). Her frugal upbringing, together with her parents' preoccupation with the poor and the extravagance she saw in the homes of her relatives, left a considerable impression on her.<br>
<br>Constance's journalistic career started after her family moved to Twickenham. Inspired by her sister, who was illustrating articles for <span class="italic">The Queen</span>, she won a competition for a dress article in <span class="italic">Woman</span>. Despite her poor education, she went on to write for most of the popular magazines and newspapers of her time, her earnings giving her an unusual amount of financial independence. Arnold Bennett, editor of <span class="italic">Woman</span>, told her that she did not know how to write and arranged for her to have grammar lessons from a board schoolteacher. She learned more, however, from Bennett's skilful editing.<br>
<br>On 6 December 1894 Constance married her second cousin Charles Steers Peel, the son of Francis William Peel, rector of Burghwallis, Yorkshire. Her husband was an electrical engineer and they moved to Dewsbury. Constance continued to work as a journalist in London, publishing as Mrs C. S. Peel. She inhabited three very different worlds: the artistic London world, the manufacturing town world, and the country house world (she was presented at court the year after she married), all of which influenced her writings. She drew on her experience of setting up home in her first book, <span class="italic">The new home: treating of the arrangement, decoration and furnishing of a house of medium size to be maintained by moderate income</span> (1898). Forced to run her own house when her maid left, she &#145;soon discovered how easily money could be wasted by bad kitchen management&#146;  (Peel, 111). She concentrated on work that she could do from home so that she could spend time with her young daughter. She was editor and managing director of <span class="italic">Hearth and Home</span>, <span class="italic">Woman</span>, and <span class="italic">Myra's Journal</span> from 1903 until 1906 and published a series of popular cookery books. She was also managing director of Beeton &amp; Co. from 1903 to 1906.<br>
<br>Constance Peel took a break from work after the birth of her second child, Denise. A year and a half later she lost her third and last baby. She decided on a change of career and, fashionably, started a hat shop with her friend Ethel Kentish. The business met with some success, with famous clients such as Ellen Terry. However, she had doubts about the morality of fashion and eventually decided to close down the business owing to ill health. When she recovered in 1914 she wrote a novel, <span class="italic">The Hat Shop</span>, which met with critical acclaim, encouraging her to write three more.<br>
<br>By 1913 both children were at school and Constance Peel began to miss her former life as a journalist. She took up the post of editor of the household department of <span class="italic">The Queen</span>, a position she held for seventeen years, as well as working for <span class="italic">Hearth and Home</span> and <span class="italic">The Lady</span>. Her books such as <span class="italic">Marriage on Small Means</span> (1914) and <span class="italic">The Labour Saving House</span> (1917) instructed women in modern methods and technologies of household management. In 1918 Lord Northcliffe appointed her editor of the <span class="italic">Daily Mail</span> women's page. This was brought to an abrupt end when she was diagnosed with diabetes in 1920; her life was saved by the discovery of insulin later in the year.<br>
<br>During the First World War, Constance Peel organized a Soldiers' and Sailors' Wives Club in Lambeth, and was a speaker for the United Workers' Association and the National War Savings Association. In partnership with Maud Pember Reeves she worked as co-director of women's service for the Ministry of Food during the period of voluntary food rationing, March 1917&#150;March 1918. She travelled round the country and delivered 176 addresses promoting the economical use of food. She was appointed OBE in 1919. After the war she worked for improvements in women's domestic lives. She served on two committees, under the Ministry of Reconstruction, on working-class housing and domestic service. She also was involved in committees of the Ministry of Health, the Town Planning and Garden Cities associations, Women's Pioneer Housing, and the Peckham Pioneer Health Centre. She was vice-president of the British Women Housewives' Association.<br>
<br>Constance Peel wrote five volumes of memoirs with vivid descriptions of interiors and a keen eye for social detail on the great social changes in her lifetime. In <span class="italic">Life's Enchanted Cup: an Autobiography, 1872&#150;1933</span> (1933) she made it clear that she worked out of necessity as well as pleasure: to provide for her two children, to support an aunt, and to save for her old age. She died at 7 Knaresborough Place, Kensington, London, on 7 August 1934 from complications induced by her long-standing myocarditis and diabetes. Her husband survived her.<br>
