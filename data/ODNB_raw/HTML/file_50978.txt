<span class="headword">Miller,  William Galbraith</span>  (1848&#150;1904), <span class="occ">jurist</span>, was born on 3 June 1848 in Glasgow, eldest of the three sons of Thomas Miller, warehouseman and pawnbroker, and his wife, Isabella, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Galbraith. Initially privately educated, he attended Glasgow high school for three years before matriculating at Glasgow University in 1864. He followed various arts courses, gaining distinctions in his classical subjects. He graduated with second-class honours in mathematics in 1872. In 1869 he had begun a legal apprenticeship, adding law courses to his studies. To fulfil the requirements for the Glasgow LLB degree, he needed to take further courses in Edinburgh. These included lectures by James Lorimer, to whom his first book was dedicated. He graduated again in 1875, the first to do so under the thirteen-year-old regulations. After setting a precedent by convincing the Court of Session that his LLB warranted direct admission as a law agent, he entered a local firm and became a partner there two years later. In 1884 he left to join the Faculty of Advocates, and moved to Edinburgh, though he continued to teach a course at Glasgow University as he had since 1876. Although his practice at the bar was not extensive, he was well respected and regularly consulted by colleagues.<br>
<br>Miller was most remembered for his teaching, for his efforts to improve legal education, and for his academic work. For more than fifteen years he gave a course in public and international law at Glasgow in return only for the fees paid by his students. During this period he was passed over for two chairs, one in Glasgow and one in Edinburgh, despite strong support from distinguished lawyers and his own students. It was not until 1894 that he was awarded an annual salary of &pound;300 as a lecturer. This was insufficient to allow him to give up his practice and he continued to travel from Edinburgh. Throughout these years Miller corresponded with university authorities, legal practitioners, and the press in attempts to improve the content and funding of law teaching. He also published various articles, the most substantial being a pamphlet of forty-eight pages, <span class="italic">The Faculty of Law in the University of Glasgow</span> (1889). He met with little success in these campaigns and in an allied scheme for the LLD degree. This is reflected in his will, with his book collection being left away from the university. His friends were also forbidden to set up any memorial to him there, in the belief that, when the changes he sought did come about, his reputation and memory would &#145;take care of itself&#146;. His brother Harry was, none the less, moved to publish a pamphlet within months of his death, &#145;to put on record the main facts of his connection with Glasgow University, and what he tried to do for the Faculty of Law&#146;  (Miller, preface).<br>
<br>Miller's academic writings are marked by intellectual acumen, humour, and a scholarship extending beyond law, philosophy, and history into philology, art, and poetry. They include fourteen articles in law journals, and in 1887 two papers in the <span class="italic">Journal of Jurisprudence</span> on various analogies between the development of language and law which foreshadowed later research. His main contributions to legal theory are found in three books: <span class="italic">Lectures in the Philosophy of Law</span> (1884); <span class="italic">The Law of Nature and Nations in Scotland</span> (1896); and <span class="italic">The Data of Jurisprudence</span> (1903). Like many Scottish and Glaswegian contemporaries, he wrote in the Kantian and Hegelian traditions, though the <span class="italic">Data</span> is of more sociological bent. The second volume, which he died before producing, was intended to return to the abstract. Miller's ideas were clearly influential on other scholars, with whom he corresponded extensively, and are, for example, recorded in the works of Roscoe Pound, the renowned American legal theorist. Miller travelled widely within Europe. In 1895 he was invited to become a member of the <i>Internationale Vereinigung f&uuml;r vergleichende Rechtswissenschaft und Volkswirthschaftslehre</i>, and in 1903 he was elected to the council of the International Law Association.<br>
<br>Miller was, as an illustrated appreciation in the <span class="italic">Scots Law Times</span> of 1898 put it, &#145;a capital cellist, as his many years as a prominent member and President of Glasgow University Orchestral Society bear witness&#146; and a man of many friends. He died on 6 February 1904, at 13 Albany Street, Edinburgh, of congestion of the lungs. Belated acknowledgement by the university authorities came in a motion by the general council, encapsulating him &#145;as a pioneer in the systematic study of Jurisprudence on its scientific side, to which he devoted his life and made contributions of lasting value, as an able and successful teacher and as a man of gracious and attractive personality&#146;.<br>
