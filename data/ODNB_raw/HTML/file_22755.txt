<span class="headword">Price,  John</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1736), <span class="occ">architect of London</span>, of whose parents nothing is known, was a designer of early Georgian churches in an unsophisticated vernacular style derived from Wren. He was the John Price &#145;of Richmond&#146;, who designed Isleworth church, Middlesex, 1705&#150;7, and also architect and builder of the church of St Mary-at-the-Walls, Colchester, Essex, 1713&#150;14. In 1714&#150;16, in conjunction with his son John Price (also of Richmond), he designed and built St George's Chapel, Yarmouth, Norfolk, where in 1715 they also contracted to build a new town hall and assembly room. John Price subsequently designed the church of St George, Southwark, the foundation-stone of which was laid on 23 April 1734 by the deputy of George II, <i>adjuvante</i> <i>Johanne Price</i> <i>armiger, architecto</i>. It was completed in 1736.<br>
<br>Price engaged in speculative building in London, and in 1718 took leases on the Harley estate in Holles, Oxford, Margaret, and Prince's streets. In 1720 he was responsible for a project for residential development at Headley in Surrey, near Epsom, then a fashionable watering-place. The design is remarkable as &#145;the earliest English essay in urban terrace composition&#146;  (Hussey, 1539&#150;40) since Inigo Jones's Covent Garden, anticipating Colen Campbell's for Grosvenor Square by five years. This is known from an engraving (found separately, and as plates 96&#150;7 of Badesdale and Rocque's <span class="italic">Vitruvius Brittanicus</span>, vol. 4, 1739) inscribed &#145;The Elevation of West Prospect of Part of a Design of Building already began to be Erected on the Lawne at Headly in Surrey/Design'd by John Price, Architect, 1720&#146;. It shows a grand central building with portico and mansard roofs (presumably some sort of assembly rooms) flanked by two identical ranges each of nine houses treated as a uniform composition. It was never completed, but traces of Price's unfinished buildings were still to be seen at Headley in the early nineteenth century.<br>
<br>Price was employed by the duke of Chandos at Cannons House, Middlesex, in 1720&#150;21. By this time the structure was largely complete, and Price's contribution, so far as original designs were concerned, was probably small. However, the elevations of Cannons published by Hulsbergh at this time are inscribed &#145;John Price Architect, Built Anno 1720&#146;, although what they show was largely the work of his three predecessors in the duke's service. The design of the duke's projected mansion in Cavendish Square, owing much to Cannons, is similarly described as &#145;Design'd by John Price, architect 1720&#146;. It was never built, and by 1723 Price's place as the duke's surveyor had been taken by Edward Shepherd. In 1726&#150;8 Price was among those who made designs for a bridge to be built across the Thames between Fulham and Putney. His designs were not, however, accepted by the Company of Proprietors of Fulham Bridge. In 1735 Price published <span class="italic">Some considerations humbly offered to the House of Commons, for building a stone-bridge over the River Thames from Westminster to Lambeth</span>, with an engraved design.<br>
<br>John Price died in November 1736. Little is known of the career of his son John, although he appears principally to have been a London surveyor. He was warden of the Carpenters' Company in 1751&#150;2, and was elected master in 1753. He acted as surveyor to the Fishmongers' Company in the 1760s, and died on 17 October 1765.<br>
