<div class="para">
<span class="headword">McCormack,  John Francis</span>  (1884&#150;1945), <span class="occ">singer</span>, was born on 14 June 1884 in the Bawn, Mardyke Street, Athlone, co. Westmeath, Ireland, the second son and fifth of the eleven children (five of whom died in infancy or childhood) of Andrew McCormack, a foreman at the Athlone Woollen Mills, and his wife, Hannah Watson. Both parents were from Galashiels, Scotland, where his father had worked in the tweed mill, although his paternal grandfather was from Sligo, in the west of Ireland. His father had a fine voice and sang in the church choir, but although McCormack sang from an early age he had no formal singing lessons. He was educated by the Marist Brothers before winning a scholarship to the Diocesan College of the Immaculate Conception, Summerhill, Sligo, in 1896. Leaving school in 1902 he narrowly failed to win a scholarship to the Dublin College of Science, and was working as a clerk while preparing for the civil service entrance examination when he was encouraged by his friends to audition for the Palestrina Choir at the pro-cathedral in Dublin. He sang in this choir for two years under the direction of Vincent O'Brien, and won the gold medal in the solo tenor class at the Feis Ceoil, the National Irish Festival in Dublin, in 1903. This led to an invitation to America to take part in the musical entertainment in the Irish village at the St Louis World Fair in 1904. On his return he raised funds to study singing with Vincenzo Sabatini in Milan from 1905 to 1906. On 2 July 1906 he married Lily, daughter of Patrick Foley, a Dublin innkeeper. A soprano, she had been another gold medal winner at the 1903 Feis Ceoil. They had one son and one daughter, and in 1918 adopted another son, the sixteen-month-old child of Lily's brother.<br>
<br>McCormack made his opera d&eacute;but on 13 January 1906 at Savona, near Genoa, using the name Giovanni Foli, as Fritz in Pietro Mascagni's <span class="italic">L'Amico Fritz</span>, but after failing to get any engagements in Milan he returned home early in 1907 and moved to London, where he began to build a reputation as a ballad singer in concerts and at private parties. After a successful appearance in one of Arthur Boosey's Queen's Hall Ballad Concerts in 1907 he was taken up by Sir John Murray Scott, a wealthy patron of the arts, who arranged an audition at Covent Garden. McCormack made his Covent Garden d&eacute;but on 15 October 1907 as Turiddu in Mascagni's <span class="italic">Cavalleria rusticana</span>, the youngest tenor to sing a major role at the Royal Opera House. This was followed by Don Ottavio in Mozart's <span class="italic">Don Giovanni</span>. He was then engaged for the 1908 season, and sang in the gala performance to celebrate the state visit of the French president, Emile Loubet. He was re-engaged as a <i>primo tenore</i> for the grand season each summer until 1914, performing sixteen roles, including Alfredo in Giuseppe Verdi's <span class="italic">La traviata</span> with Luisa Tetrazzini, and Rodolfo&#151;his favourite role&#151;in Giacomo Puccini's <span class="italic">La Boh&egrave;me</span> with Nellie Melba.<br>
<br>McCormack's European reputation grew as he was invited to sing at the Salzburg Festival by Felix Weingartner, and to perform in Verdi's <span class="italic">Rigoletto</span> at the Teatro San Carlo in Naples in 1909, and in 1909, thanks to Tetrazzini, he was invited to New York by Oscar Hammerstein. He made his New York d&eacute;but at the Manhattan Opera House with Tetrazzini in <span class="italic">La traviata</span>, and after the Metropolitan Opera bought the Manhattan Opera Company in 1910, changing its name to the Chicago&#150;Philadelphia Opera Company, McCormack remained for the 1910&#150;11 season, making his first appearance at the Metropolitan Opera on 29 November 1910 with Nellie Melba in one of the company's weekly performances there.<br>
<br>McCormack's concert career began to take off in America in 1912, and in 1914 he made New York his home, eventually taking American citizenship. But he became unpopular in England because of his outspoken Irish nationalism, and he did not sing there from 1914 until 1924. He gave up opera soon after the war. He had always been a poor actor, and his voice was lighter than that of the leading Italian operatic tenors. Although Enrico Caruso regarded McCormack (known as the Irish Caruso) as the finest tenor of his time, he had never been universally admired as an opera singer. But as a recitalist he was unsurpassed, and he had an enormous popular following, especially in America. He toured throughout the world in the 1920s and 1930s, his concerts always starting with serious songs by Handel or Mozart, and German lieder, usually by Brahms or Hugo Wolf, before moving on to the Irish ballads and sentimental popular songs. Although often accused of pandering to his audience's craving for sentimental songs he claimed never to have sung music he did not want to sing. His most famous songs were &#145;I hear you calling me&#146;, which he recorded eight times, and &#145;Mother Machree&#146;. He always sang with his head raised, his eyes shut, and his legs wide apart, with a closed book clasped to his chest. His voice declined rapidly after 1932, and he retired from the concert platform in 1938, when he sold his house in Hollywood and settled in Ireland. He made one film, <span class="italic">Song o' my Heart</span>, in 1929, and in 1936 made a brief appearance in <span class="italic">Wings of the Morning</span>, the first British film to be shot in Technicolor. He came out of retirement at the beginning of the Second World War to make a concert tour with Gerald Moore on behalf of the Red Cross, and appeared in the first series of the <span class="italic">Irish Half Hour</span> in 1941 to 1942 on the BBC. But he was unable to sing after 1942, when he developed emphysema.<br>
<br>What was most striking about McCormack's voice was the beauty and sweetness of his tone, and the clarity of his enunciation. He became famous partly through his gramophone recordings, starting in 1904 when he made eight recordings on wax cylinders for the Edison Bell Company. Most of his recordings were of the lighter side of his repertoire, but one of the most famous was &#145;Il mio tesoro&#146;, from <span class="italic">Don Giovanni</span>.<br>
<br>A devout Catholic, McCormack was honoured many times by the pope for his services to Catholic charities, and he was especially proud of his hereditary title of papal count, awarded by Pope Pius XI in 1928. When the Eucharistic Congress was held in Dublin in 1932, and the pontifical high mass was celebrated by the papal legate in Phoenix Park, McCormack, wearing his uniform as count of the papal court, sang C&eacute;sar Franck's <span class="italic">Panis angelicus</span> before a congregation of one million. He became a privy chamberlain of cape and sword to the pope in 1933.<br>
<br>Although slim as a young man McCormack developed a vast appetite, and became very fat. He lived extravagantly and had expensive hobbies, with an art collection that included Corot's <span class="italic">Nymphs Bathing</span>, Franz Hals's <span class="italic">Man</span>, and a Rodin sculpture, and he was addicted to horse-racing, although he never realized his ambition to own a Derby winner. James Joyce used him as a model for Shaun the Post in <span class="italic">Finnegans Wake</span> (1939). McCormack died of pneumonia on 16 September 1945 at his home, Glena, Booterstown, overlooking Dublin Bay, and was buried at Dean's Grange cemetery, Dublin.<br>
