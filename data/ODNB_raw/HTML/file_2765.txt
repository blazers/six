<span class="headword">Bogle,  George</span>  (1746&#150;1781), <span class="occ">diplomatist</span>, was born on 26 November 1746 at Daldowie, near Bothwell, Lanarkshire, the third son and youngest of nine children born to <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/65002/', "George Bogle (1700&#150;1784)")</script>, merchant and rector of Glasgow University, and his wife, Anne (<i>d</i>. 1752), daughter of Sir John Sinclair, fourth baronet (<i>d</i>. 1726), of Stevenson, Haddingtonshire, and his wife, Martha Lockhart. He received his early education in Haddington and Glasgow, and after attending the University of Edinburgh from November 1760 to April 1761, he was sent to a private school at Enfield for three years. After six months' travel on the continent, in June 1765 he entered as clerk the counting house of Bogle and Scott in London, of which his eldest brother, Robert, was the head. In 1769 his friends obtained for him an appointment in the East India Company, and the following January he sailed on the <i>Vansittart</i> for Calcutta, arriving there on 19 August. His first letters home provide a vivid description of a devastating famine in Bengal. While serving first as writer with the select committee that had charge of political matters, he quickly learnt Persian. On 10 October 1772 he was appointed assistant secretary to the board of revenue and in that capacity accompanied the governor of Bengal (and future governor-general), Warren Hastings, on a tour to Cossimbazar. On 9 March 1773 he was made registrar of the court of appeals (<i>diwani adalat</i>) and soon after secretary to the select committee, holding the two posts simultaneously. To save the family home at Daldowie from being sold to meet the debts of his brother Robert, he began from this time to send nearly all his savings to his father.<br>
<br>For the respect and loyalty he showed to Warren Hastings, already caught in a web of factional strife, Bogle was rewarded by appointment as envoy to the third Panchen Lama of Tibet, Lobsang Palden Yesh&eacute; (1738&#150;1780). The lama, a broad-minded scholar-statesman who maintained close contact with many Asian courts, had interceded with Hastings on behalf of the Bhutanese in a border conflict. The governor was quick to exploit this overture, not only with the aim of securing the free flow of British goods across the Himalayas into Tibet but also to satisfy his scientific and scholarly interests. Hastings was exceptionally well served by Bogle, whose qualities of good humour and warm tolerance were matched by diligence and efficiency. After a protracted delay in Bhutan for four months, he and his companion Alexander Hamilton entered Tibet on 23 October 1774, the first Britons ever to reach that country. They were the guests of the Panchen Lama, first for a month at an isolated monastery where he had gone to escape from a smallpox epidemic, and then for five months at his principal seat of Tashilhunpo at Shigatse. The mission returned to India in June 1775 after a further two months in Bhutan. Owing to opposition from the Chinese in this period of the Qing ascendancy in Tibet, Bogle won only temporary and limited commercial gains for the British. However, the very genuine friendship that developed between him and the lama opened the door to further contacts between the British and the Tibetans.<br>
<br>It is difficult to think of anyone who fits the colonial stereotype less than Bogle. As he admitted, &#145;I always like to do at Rome as they do at Rome&#146;  (Markham, 88). He was quick to adopt Tibetan dress and to master colloquial Tibetan, enjoying many opportunities to indulge in &#145;merriment&#146; as he feasted with his Tibetan hosts, hunted with the lama's nephews, played chess with Kalmyk merchants, and, it can be assumed, pursued amorous dalliance (see below). Yet he was no profligate, taking his duties very seriously in the course of complex negotiations with many interested parties at Tashilhunpo. The lively prose of his surviving correspondence (preserved at the Mitchell Library, Glasgow) and mission journal (not published until 1876, a hundred years after the mission) reveals a warm, cultivated humanity dedicated to friendship, intellectual curiosity, and the pleasures of life.<br>
<br>Bogle found himself unemployed on his return to India because the powerful factions opposed to his patron, Hastings, were blocking all nominations. However, in November 1776, after the governor-general had again secured a majority in council, Bogle was appointed both to oversee the renewal of the leases of the company's provinces and to serve as commissioner of lawsuits. In April 1779 Hastings asked him to lead a second mission to Tibet, but this was abandoned when it was learnt that the Panchen Lama had left for Peking (Beijing), where he later died. In September of that year Bogle was appointed collector of Rangpur, where he established an annual trade fair for merchants from Bhutan. In January 1781 he was recalled by Hastings to serve on a new committee of revenue in Calcutta. There he was taken ill and died on 3 April. His tomb lies in the South Park Street cemetery.<br>
<br>Although Bogle's papers appear to have been censored by his family, it is clear that he fathered at least five children during his career in the east. Two daughters, Martha and Mary, were sent after his death to the care of his family at Daldowie, both later marrying Scotsmen. Their descendants asserted that the girls' mother had been a Tibetan lady called Tichan (Dechen, a common Tibetan name properly romanized as bDe-chen), describing her as &#145;sister of the Teshoo [Panchen] Lama&#146;  (Richardson, 76). She was more probably a niece or other more distant relative of the lama and may perhaps be identified with the Beebee Bogle who was still being paid a pension in Calcutta from Bogle's estate fifty-seven years after his death. Alternatively, that lady may have been the mother, probably a Bengali, of yet another daughter of Bogle, also called Mary, whom he had sent to the care of a friend in London in 1780. Bogle also had two, possibly three, sons, one of whom died on 31 April 1782, and another, George, who was baptized in Calcutta on 10 February 1784 on the same occasion as (his true sisters?) Martha and Mary, who were sent to Scotland.<br>
