<span class="headword">Tagore, Dwijendranath</span>  (1840&#150;1926), <span class="occ">poet and philosopher</span>, was born in Calcutta, India, on 11 March 1840, the eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/98328/', "Debendranath Tagore (1817&#150;1905)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/94946/', "Tagore family")</script>] and his wife, Sarada Devi (1826?&#150;1875). His grandfather <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/98105/', "&#145;Prince&#146; Dwarkanath Tagore")</script> was one of the most successful independent Indian merchants of the early nineteenth century. The Tagore family was remarkable for its gifted and influential men and women. Dwijendranath's younger brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36404/', "Rabindranath Tagore (1861&#150;1941)")</script> was a world-famous poet who became the first Indian and first Asian Nobel laureate in 1913.<br>
<br>Dwijendranath Tagore was educated in Calcutta at St Paul's School and Presidency College. He was a man of many talents: philosopher, poet, songster, mathematician, innovator, and hobbyist. His hobby was making boxes with paper and experimenting with trigonometry. His publications include <span class="italic">Ontology</span> (1871) and <span class="italic">Boxometry</span> (1913). He developed shorthand in Bengali and wrote a book on it, <span class="italic">Rekhaksar varnamala</span> (1912). He composed songs and wrote their musical notations in Bengali, <i>swaralipi</i>, introducing the &#145;kasimatrik&#146; notation system in 1880. His patriotic song &#145;Malin mukhachandrama bharat tomari&#146; (&#145;pale is your face oh India&#146;) became popular. He wrote witty verses on the English-educated Bengali youth who had taken to imitating the English. He coined a term for them, <i>Ingo-Bango</i>, or the &#145;English-Bengali&#146; type  (<span class="italic">Visva Bharati Quarterly</span>, 1945, 145). Yet, as his close companion Charles (C. F.) Andrews, commented, Tagore had &#145;<i>wholly</i> annexed&#146; Shakespeare, Scott, and Dickens. To him these were not &#145;foreign at all&#146;  (Andrews, 336). Andrews gave the better part of his life to serve the Santiniketan school that Rabindranath Tagore founded in rural Bengal, where Dwijendranath Tagore lived. Like any family member, Andrews called Dwijendranath <i>barodada</i> (elder brother).<br>
<br>Dwijendranath Tagore and Mahatma Gandhi met several times and, according to Andrews, revered one another. A keen observer of the Gandhian way, Tagore once wrote to Gandhi doubting if &#145;penance and fasting&#146; were &#145;quite the things&#146; that were &#145;necessary&#146;. But, &#145;on second thought&#146;, he continued:<blockquote>I find that we are not competent to judge the matter from our standpoint. You are deriving your inspiration from such a high source that, instead of calling in question the appropriateness of your sayings and doings, we ought to thankfully recognize in them the fatherly call of providence full of divine wisdom and power. (D. Tagore to M. Gandhi, n.d., Rabindra-Bhavana archives, D. Tagore file)</blockquote>Referring to Gandhi, he used to tell his brother Rabindranath, &#145;Rabi, you do not understand. This man will deliver India&#146;  (Kripalani, 257).<br>
<br>In his philosophical convictions Tagore was a follower of Kant. He wrote a philosophical work in four volumes, <span class="italic">Tattwavidya</span> (1866&#150;9), comparing Kantian and Indian philosophy. He also wrote a spiritual treatise, <span class="italic">Brahmajnan o Brahmasadhana</span> (1900). He held sessions on the <span class="italic">Bhagavad Gita</span> with the Santiniketan teachers and published <span class="italic">Gitapatha</span> (&#145;Readings from the <span class="italic">Gita</span>&#146;) in 1915. Andrews described how &#145;humble and truthful&#146; Tagore was about his own spiritual experience. He spoke of having found comfort from the scriptures, which included not only the <span class="italic">Gita</span> but also the Christian gospels. His two favourite sayings from the latter were &#145;The kingdom of heaven is within you&#146;, and &#145;Except ye become as little children, ye cannot enter the kingdom of heaven&#146;  (Andrews, 340).<br>
<br>As a poet Dwijendranath Tagore was best known for his allegorical verses <span class="italic">Swapnaprayana</span> (&#145;Dream journey&#146;) of (1875). He translated the Sanskrit epic <span class="italic">Meghdut</span> into Bengali (1860), which Michael Madhusudan Dutt, the greatest contemporary writer of epic verses, acclaimed. Tagore converted the difficult Sanskrit texts from the <span class="roman">Upanishads</span> into simple Bengali verse for all to read. He did that also for the prayer book, <span class="italic">Brahmo dharma grantha</span>, of the Brahmo Samaj (a Hindu reformist movement influential in Bengal from the mid-nineteenth century). He wrote his second book of original verses, <span class="italic">Kavyamala</span> (1921), in old age. He enjoyed rhyming in English and wrote letters to Andrews beginning &#145;Oh, Charlie dear, I wish you were here&#146;  (Andrews, 339).<br>
<br>Dwijendranath Tagore was unusual in the way he lived. He was eccentric and other-worldly. Even his own creations had no use for him after he had read them out to an intimate circle of listeners. His brother, Rabindranath, wrote how <i>barodada</i> would alternately write and read from his <span class="italic">Swapnaprayana</span> with his &#145;boisterous laughter at his own conceits making the verandah tremble&#146;  (Tagore, 94). Other contemporaries also wrote about his &#145;hearty and child-like laugh&#146;  (Chowdhury, 27). He could also be impatient. It was a familiar sight to see his old faithful servant Muniswar running to fetch whoever had been called for. But he was very troubled if he felt he had lost control or been harsh. Then it was a mad rush until he had made amends.<br>
<br>In Santiniketan, where he moved after his father's death in 1905, Tagore's day began early with a walk round the garden followed by a cold bath at the same time every day, followed by feeding the mynahs from his own plate and continuing to revise his Bengali shorthand even when his fingers were bent with rheumatism. Some of his letters revealed his inner anxiety when his father entrusted him with charge of the family's estate. He was married and had five sons and two daughters, but his wife died relatively young. He died at Santiniketan on 19 January 1926.<br>
