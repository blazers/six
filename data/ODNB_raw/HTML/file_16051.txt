<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Lanier,  Nicholas</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1588, <em>d.</em> 1666), <span class="occ">musician and art dealer</span>, was baptized on 10 September 1588 in the church of Holy Trinity Minories, London. His father, John Lanier (<i>d</i>. 1616), was a sackbut player in the royal court band or musick, and his mother, Frances (<i>bap</i>. 1566, <i>d</i>. after 1616), was the daughter of Mark Anthony Galliardello, an Italian member of the musick. The strong musical tradition in the family stemmed from Nicholas's paternal grandfather, also called Nicholas (<i>d</i>. 1612), a Huguenot musician (originally from Rouen) in the service of Elizabeth I. John Lanier's five brothers&#151;Alphonso, Innocent, Jerome, Clement, and Andrea&#151;were also all members of the musick.<br>
<br>The younger Nicholas Lanier entered the household of Robert Cecil, earl of Salisbury, as an apprentice musician, probably about 1601. Later he seems to have acted for a time as music tutor to Salisbury's heir, William, Lord Cranborne. He himself came under the influence of John Coprario, who was also attached to Salisbury's household, and of the younger Alfonso Ferrabosco. In 1610 Lanier joined Cranborne in Paris and possibly accompanied him to Italy; he certainly visited Venice in the autumn of that year as a diplomatic courier.<br>
<br>On 26 December 1613, in the former banqueting house of Whitehall Palace, Lanier sang his own song &#145;Bring away this sacred tree&#146; in <span class="italic">The Squires' Masque</span>, an entertainment with text by Thomas Campion and music mostly by Coprario. This song marked Lanier's first tentative use of the Italianate declamatory or <i>recitativo</i> style, which was to be the main feature of his vocal compositions. Perhaps partly as a result of this d&eacute;but Lanier succeeded to a vacant place as a lutenist and singer in the king's musick (12 January 1616), of which John Dowland was then also a member. Lanier was in addition a skilled viol player. During the next decade he was associated with a number of court masques, mostly with texts by Ben Jonson, including <span class="italic">The Vision of Delight</span> (1616) and <span class="italic">The Masque of Augurs</span> (1621). Little of his music for these events survives, with the notable exception of the song &#145;Do not expect&#146; from <span class="italic">The Masque of Augurs</span>. The masque <span class="italic">Lovers Made Men</span>, performed on 22 February 1617 at the home of Lord James Hay, was especially significant, as it seems that Lanier not only composed all the music but also designed the stage sets and costumes. Through a combination of his own talents and the influence of powerful patrons such as the duke of Buckingham and the earl of Arundel he became a member of the privileged circle surrounding Prince Charles. Here he developed as a connoisseur of art and also as a practising painter. The precise date of his appointment as master of the king's musick is unknown, but he is first named as such in documents dated 13 and 22 June 1626  (Ashbee, 3.18).<br>
<br>Immediately after the funeral of James I on 7 May 1625 Lanier was dispatched by the new king, Charles I, to Italy, to search out and purchase paintings for the enlargement of the Royal Collection. Through Daniel Nys, a French-born art dealer, agent, and entrepreneur, Lanier made contact with the duke of Mantua, Ferdinando Gonzaga, with a view to buying the extensive and celebrated Mantuan collection. The negotiations were long and tortuous and were not finally completed until 1628; the total price paid for this splendid collection was 68,000 scudi (then about &pound;15,000). (Lanier was not involved in a second sequence of negotiations, which culminated in the purchase of Mantegna's <span class="italic">The Triumph of Caesar</span>.)<br>
<br>During this period Lanier made two separate visits to Italy, being based for the most part in Venice. At the end of his first trip he returned to England with his own portrait by Van Dyck (now in the Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna). As a result Van Dyck was invited to enter the service of King Charles. Lanier had already begun to collect drawings, both for himself and for his patron Lord Arundel, at a time when such pieces were considered valueless, and was the first to imprint on them a distinctive collector's mark. Among his friends were members of the Oliver family of miniaturists, and a miniature of Lanier, perhaps by Peter Oliver, was said by Vertue  (Vertue, <span class="italic">Note books</span>, 1.62) to have been in the Royal Collection. Lanier may also have received instruction in painting technique from Oliver.<br>
<br>Lanier now returned to his musical duties at court. The murder of the duke of Buckingham on 23 August 1628 inspired him to compose his most celebrated work in <i>stilo recitativo</i>, a setting for solo voice with instrumental accompaniment of the legend of Hero and Leander, the words also being by Lanier. It shows the influence of Monteverdi, whom Lanier probably had met in Venice. Both the piece itself and Lanier's singing of it were greatly admired by King Charles. Most of his surviving vocal compositions (about thirty songs) date from the 1630s. A handful of instrumental works in dance form also survives. On 15 July 1635 Lanier was appointed first marshal of the Corporation of Musick, a body set up to supervise standards among professional musicians.<br>
<br>With the outbreak of the English civil war in 1642 Lanier followed the court to Oxford, where he painted the half-length self-portrait now hanging in the faculty of music there. This shows the influence of Rubens, who had visited England in 1629. Lanier depicts himself in sober costume, in face and appearance not unlike his king, holding a brush and artist's palette, together with a <i>memento mori</i> skull and a fragment of his own music. By spring 1645 he had already left England, and he spent the next fifteen years variously in France and the Netherlands. However, his self-imposed exile was not complete; official passes (still extant) gave him permission to enter England with paintings, presumably purchases for patrons, and in 1649&#150;50 he was present on several occasions at the gigantic sale of King Charles's art collection which he had himself largely helped to create. At the sale he managed to buy for &pound;10 his own portrait by Van Dyck. He was joined in exile by his wife, Elizabeth, whom he had probably married about 1626; there were apparently no children.<br>
<br>Lanier also experimented as a printmaker. About 1636 he had produced a handful of etchings after drawings by Giulio Romano, and in 1656, possibly in Paris, he made a few more, after Parmigianino. Recent research has dispelled former doubts as to his authorship of the second set.<br>
<br>Following the Restoration in 1660 Lanier was reinstated in his former posts as master of the musick, marshal of the Corporation of Musick, and groom of the queen's bedchamber. However, in his will (drawn up on 5 March 1661) he was already complaining of &#145;divers infirmities, incident to old age&#146;, and he was by that time probably no longer fully equal to the demands of his offices. Samuel Pepys records several musical meetings in Greenwich (where he was temporarily staying because of the plague) between 30 October 1665 and 3 January 1666, at which Lanier was present and sang, &#145;in a melancholy method, very well, and a sober man he seems to be&#146;  (Pepys, 30 Oct 1665). Lanier died a few weeks later, apparently suddenly, and was buried on 24 February 1666, probably at St Alfege, Greenwich. His widow survived him for a further seven years and died in February 1673.<br>
<br>Mystery surrounds another <a name="cosubject_16051"></a><span class="headword">Nicholas Lanier</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1646)<span class="occ"></span>, resident in the parish of St Martin-in-the-Fields, where he was buried on 4 November 1646. No firm family connections have been established, and this Lanier is said to have been a tradesman of some kind (possibly a pastry-cook). He was not a musician, and was clearly not the creator of the Lanier etchings, as was at one time supposed. The original error probably arose because of the misreading of the date of the etchings as 1636 instead of the correct 1656.<br>
