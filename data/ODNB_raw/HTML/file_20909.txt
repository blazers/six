<span class="headword">Osthryth <span class="st"> [Ostrith]</span></span>  (<em>d.</em> 697), <span class="occ">queen of the Mercians, consort of King &AElig;thelred</span>, was the daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20930/', "Oswiu (611/12&#150;670), king of Northumbria")</script>, and his second wife, Eanflaed. Her marriage appears to have taken place some time before 679, in which year her husband fought with her brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/37384/', "Ecgfrith, king of Northumbria")</script> since 670, near the River Trent. Another of her brothers, a youth named &AElig;lfwine, was killed in the battle; he is said to have been beloved in both kingdoms, which suggests that he had been frequenting his sister's court in Mercia as well as his brother's in Northumbria. Ecgfrith's desire to avenge &AElig;lfwine's death would have provoked further conflict between the two kingdoms, if Archbishop Theodore had not made peace. A sign of the subsequent co-operation between the Mercian and Northumbrian rulers is provided by the willingness of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/52315/', "&#198;thelred (d. after 704)")</script> and Osthryth to expel Wilfrid from their kingdom, allegedly to please Ecgfrith.<br>
<br>It seems to have been after the battle of the Trent that Osthryth carried out the pious action for which she is best remembered. She retrieved the remains of the body of her uncle, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20916/', "Oswald")</script>, who had been killed by the Mercian king Penda at the battle of &#145;Maserfelth&#146; in 642 (his head and arms had already been taken to Northumbria), and arranged for them to be transported to the monastery at Bardney in the province of Lindsey (modern Lincolnshire), of which she and her husband were generous patrons. The Bardney monks were at first reluctant to receive the remains of the hated king who had once conquered their land, although they acknowledged Oswald's sanctity; a timely miracle changed their minds, and the relics were reverently washed and placed in a shrine.<br>
<br>It has been speculated that Osthryth's promotion of her uncle's cult may have had a political motive. The veneration of Oswald was already developing into a dynastic cult in Northumbria, where his head was preserved at Lindisfarne and his arms at Bamburgh; perhaps the choice of Bardney as the resting-place for the other remains was intended to provide a focus for Northumbrian sympathies in Lindsey, which was a territory long disputed between Mercia and Northumbria. Whether for this or for some other reason, Osthryth does not seem to have been popular in her husband's kingdom: in 697 she was murdered by the Mercian nobles. She was probably buried at Bardney, where her husband &AElig;thelred subsequently retired as a monk; a later list of saints' resting-places indicates that both of them were venerated there. &AElig;thelred is known to have had one child, most likely (though not certainly) with Osthryth: this was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5000/', "Ceolred (d. 716)")</script>, who became king of Mercia in 709.<br>
