<span class="headword">Walpole,  Michael</span> <span class="st"> [<em>pseud. </em>Michael Christopherson]</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1570, <em>d.</em> 1625), <span class="occ">Jesuit</span>, was baptized on 1 October 1570 at Docking, Norfolk, the son of Christopher Walpole (<i>d</i>. 1596) of Anmer Hall, near Docking, and Margery Beckham. He was the youngest of seven brothers, four of whom, including <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28594/', "Henry Walpole")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28599/', "Richard Walpole")</script>, became Jesuits. After being educated at Norwich School he met the Jesuit John Gerard on the latter's arrival in Norfolk in 1588, and became his constant companion for a year. On learning of his brother Henry's imprisonment at Flushing in December 1589, he crossed the sea with ransom money for his release. He then proceeded to Rome with his cousin <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28592/', "Edward Walpole")</script> and entered the English College on 12 May 1590. Following in the path of his brothers and of his cousin Edward he entered the Society of Jesus in September 1593. For the next ten years little is recorded of him, except that after his theological studies at Rome he appears at the English College, Valladolid, as prefect of studies in 1603.<br>
<br>From about this time Walpole's life became bound up with that of a noble lady and benefactor of the English mission, Luisa de Carvajal, who took up residence in London in 1606, bringing Walpole with her as confessor and spiritual adviser. James I's proclamation of 2 June 1610, issued in response to the assassination of Henri IV of France and urging the carrying out of all penal laws against the recusants and the ministering of the oath of allegiance, led Walpole to publish <span class="italic">A Briefe Admonition to All English Catholikes</span>, under the initials M. C. P. (Michael Christopherson Priest). It contained an appeal to Queen Anne, who was known to have Catholic sympathies, if not to be a Catholic, to act as Queen Esther and intercede for the deliverance of English Catholics. In the same year he was arrested at Do&ntilde;a Luisa's house and imprisoned, and released only on condition of his leaving the country.<br>
<br>Walpole then lived for a time at Douai, where he engaged in further controversy with George Downame, one of the royal chaplains, who had in 1603 published <span class="italic">A Treatise Concerning Antichrist</span>, against Cardinal Bellarmine. After consultation with Bellarmine, Walpole brought out an answering <span class="italic">Treatise Concerning Antichrist</span>, under the above pseudonym, in two parts (1613&#150;14). Dedicating his book to James I, he drew the king's attention to the sufferings of English Catholics, remarking how &#145;many things lie hid which would astonish and amaze the world&#146;. On 17 August 1613 Walpole was appointed superior of the English mission and returned to London in the retinue of the new Spanish ambassador, Count Gondomar. When Do&ntilde;a Luisa died in January 1614 he was by her side, and the following year he accompanied her body to its resting place in Spain. It was not until August 1615, on the death of the previous superior, Robert Jones, that he was able to assume fully the responsibilities of his new position.<br>
<br>About this time he also turned his pen from works of controversy to translations of saints' lives. Already for Luisa de Carvajal he had translated the autobiography of St Teresa of Avila in 1611, and in 1616 he brought out his translation of Ribadeneira's popular biography of St Ignatius of Loyola. In 1619 Walpole retired to Spain, and held posts at the English College, Seville. He died in Seville on 11 November 1625 <span class="smallcap">OS</span>.<br>
