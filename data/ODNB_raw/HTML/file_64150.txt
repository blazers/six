<span class="headword">Brandard family</span>  (<em>per. </em><em>c.</em>1825&#150;1898), <span class="occ">printmakers</span>, came to prominence with <a name="cosubject_3257"></a><span class="headword">Robert Brandard</span>  (1805&#150;1862), <span class="occ">printmaker and painter</span>, who was born at Birmingham, and baptized on 31 January 1805 at St Philip's, Birmingham, the eldest son of Thomas Brandard (<i>d</i>. 1830), engraver and copperplate printer, of Barford Street, Deretend, Birmingham, and his wife, Ann. A member of the Birmingham school of engravers, Robert Brandard learned the rudiments of his profession from his father, and probably studied also at J. V. Barber's Great Charles Street Academy and under the engraver William Radclyffe. In 1824 he became a pupil in London of the landscape engraver Edward Goodall, and about a year later set up professionally in Islington. He joined the Artists' Annuity Fund in 1827 and signed the 1837 petition to the king on the admission of engravers to the Royal Academy. Robert is primarily known for his landscape and topographical prints after works by contemporary painters such as Clarkson Stanfield, Augustus Callcott, J. F. Herring, Richard Westall, and most notably J. M. W. Turner, whom he met through Goodall. Many of his metal-engraved prints after Turner's paintings were produced under the supervision of the artist, who considered Robert to be one of the six best contemporary engravers  (Rawlinson, lxvi). One of his earliest engravings to attract attention was <span class="italic">Sans souci</span> after Thomas Stothard, which appeared in the first volume of William Pickering's <span class="italic">The Bijou</span> (1828). Other journals to which he contributed include the <span class="italic">Literary Souvenir</span>, <span class="italic">Friendship's Offering</span>, <span class="italic">The Keepsake</span>, the <span class="italic">Landscape Annual</span>, and <span class="italic">Heath's Picturesque Annual</span>. His first important book illustration commission was for eight plates after William Brockedon for his <span class="italic">Illustrations of the Passes of the Alps</span> (1828&#150;9). Many others followed, among them twenty-one plates after William Henry Bartlett for N. P. Willis's <span class="italic">American Scenery</span> (1840) and <span class="italic">Canadian Scenery</span> (1842), seven after Stanfield and William Collins for Walter Scott's <span class="roman">Waverley</span> novels, and three vignettes after George Cattermole and others for Baroness Calabrella's <span class="italic">Evenings at Haddon Hall</span> (1846). Five engravings of pictures in the Royal Collection were included in S. C. Hall's <span class="italic">The Royal Gallery</span> (<i>c</i>.1855). Among his wood-engraved work are illustrations to Charles Knight's <span class="italic">London</span> (1841&#150;2). Of his various steel- or copper-engraved reproductions of Turner's work, those for <span class="italic">Picturesque Views in England and Wales</span> (1838), <span class="italic">Rivers of France</span> (1837), <span class="italic">The Poetical Work of Sir Walter Scott</span> (1834), and <span class="italic">The Poetical Works of John Milton</span> (1835) are among the most successful, the Scott plates earning him 60 guineas each. Between 1851 and 1866 fifteen of his plates appeared in the <span class="italic">Art Journal</span>, of which the eight after Turner were subsequently published in <span class="italic">The Turner Gallery</span> (<i>c</i>.1878), most notably <span class="italic">Rain, Steam and Speed</span> (1860), <span class="italic">The Snowstorm</span> (1861), and <span class="italic">Whalers&#151;the &#145;Erebus&#146;</span> (1861). The latter, one of Robert's last engravings, was considered by a contemporary to be &#145;a gem on which his reputation may well rest&#146;, while others regarded his large plate of <span class="italic">Crossing the Brook</span> (1842), exhibited with <span class="italic">The Snowstorm</span> at the International Exhibition of 1862, as his finest  (Hunnisett, 24). From his home address in Eynsford, Kent, he jointly published with J. Hogarth <span class="italic">Scraps of Nature</span>, two volumes of etchings made between 1842 and 1851 of the coast and Weald of Kent, examples of which were included in the <span class="italic">Art Journal</span> (1875). According to one obituary &#145;quiet, unobtrusive, and gentlemanly in manner&#146;  (<span class="italic">Art Journal</span>), Robert was esteemed by everyone who knew him. His pupils included his brother-in-law, Mr (possibly William) Floyd, and James Clayton Bentley. He died at his home, 2 Campden Hill Villas, Kensington, London, on 7 January 1862, survived by his wife, Elizabeth. Between 1831 and 1858 he exhibited frequently at the British Institution, Royal Academy, Society (later Royal Society) of British Artists, and New Watercolour Society. Examples of his work are held at the Victoria and Albert Museum and British Museum, London; the Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge; Leicester City Museums; and Blackburn Museum Art Collection.<br>
<br>Robert's brother <a name="cosubject_64149"></a><span class="headword">John Brandard</span>  (1812&#150;1863), <span class="occ">lithographer</span>, was born at Birmingham, and baptized on 13 March 1812 at St Martin's, Birmingham. He began his career as an engraver, mainly of commercial designs. He married on 17 January 1833 Maria Chater at Edgbaston, Birmingham. Their five children were all baptized at St Pancras Old Church, London, between 1835 and 1845. One of the earliest and most skilful English lithographic artists, he became well known in the 1840s for his music-cover illustrations, his reputation enhanced by his close association with the eminent London lithographic printers M. and N. Hanhart, with whom he was exclusively employed for many years. His chromolithographs are characterized by delicate colouring, and smooth, even tone achieved by the use of high-quality paper and a close attention to detail in the preparation of lithographic stones. For this and other tasks John constantly employed two assistants, thus greatly increasing his output. Stage subjects were his speciality, ballet and opera in particular. His prints of dancers, many sketched from life, were admired by Degas, their oval faces and mouths, and pointed hands and feet characteristic of John's figure style. Celebrities depicted include Carlotta Grisi as La P&eacute;ri in <span class="italic">Giselle</span> (1844), and Lucille Grahn in <span class="italic">Catarina</span> (1846). Idealized images of Queen Victoria, Prince Albert, and other members of the royal family feature regularly on music covers, notably for titles published by Jullien &amp; Co., such as <span class="italic">The Court Ball March</span>. Military and comic scenes recur on song and music sheets, as do portraits of women, later issued as single prints. Many of his colour lithographs appeared also in black and white. Lithographic landscapes include views of Hastings and illustrations to <span class="italic">Kenilworth and its Castle Illustrated</span> (<i>c</i>.1865) to which Robert also contributed. John also designed fancy title-pages and ornamental borders for various musical albums, books of beauty, and pocket books. A direct reference to the illustrator is included in one of the verses to <span class="italic">The Polka-Mania</span>: &#145;And graphic Brandard takes the whim&#151;But let his pencil speak for him&#146;. The initials J. B. appear on some of the early titles, but more often his work was signed J. Brandard. He made&#151;and spent&#151;money freely, often charging as much as 20 guineas for a print. (The average price for a cover was 3<i>s</i>. to 4<i>s</i>.) An imposing, dandified figure, he liked to be seen arriving at Drury Lane or Covent Garden in his own coach. He died at his home, 8 Southampton Place, Chalk Farm, London, on 15 December 1863. Extensive collections of his work are held at Reading University; at the Theatre Museum, Covent Garden, Victoria and Albert Museum, and British Museum, London; and at the Bodleian Library, Oxford. His son Walter Brandard (<i>bap</i>. 1842) also drew some music titles.<br>
<br>Another brother, <a name="cosubject_64150"></a><span class="headword">Edward Paxman Brandard</span>  (1819&#150;1898), <span class="occ">printmaker and painter</span>, was born probably at Birmingham. He was baptized on 19 September 1820 at St Martin's, Birmingham. On his father's death in 1830 he was apprenticed to Robert, whose studio Turner frequently visited. Edward was said to be the last to work under the personal superintendence of Turner as well as the last of the steel engravers  (Hunnisett, 18). Of his prints after Turner, <span class="italic">Apollo and Daphne in the Vale of Tempe</span> and <span class="italic">The Bridge of Sighs</span> were published in <span class="italic">The Turner Gallery</span>. Etchings include <span class="italic">The Hay Wain</span> and <span class="italic">Salisbury Cathedral</span> after Constable, and his own <span class="italic">Meadows at Marlow in the Thames</span> for <span class="italic">The Portfolio</span>, 14 (1883). Edward frequently contributed to books on topography, history, art, and architecture: engravings after T. Allom for G. N. Wright's <span class="italic">China</span> (1843) were followed by a succession of plates and vignettes, many after W. H. Bartlett, for books such as W. Beattie's <span class="italic">The Danube</span> (1844), Conybeare and Howson's <span class="italic">Life and Epistles of St Paul</span> (1854), and B. Woodward's <span class="italic">General History of Hampshire</span> (1863). Some of his prints of the 1860s and 1870s, such as <span class="italic">Laufenburg</span> for <span class="italic">Picturesque Europe</span> (1876&#150;9), were engraved after Miles Birket Foster. Edward contributed numerous plates to the Art Union of London. Between 1853 and 1887 thirteen appeared in the <span class="italic">Art Journal</span>. He exhibited at a number of London galleries from 1849 to 1885, including the British Institution (where his prices ranged from 4 guineas to 25 guineas), Royal Academy, New Watercolour Society, and Society of Painter-Etchers. He died on 3 February 1898 at Aysgarth, Kingston Road, New Malden, Surrey, leaving a widow, Susannah. He was then living at 1 Albion Grove, Thornhill Road, Barnsbury, London. Examples of his work are held at the Victoria and Albert Museum and British Museum, London. A sister, Annie Caroline Brandard, a landscape painter, exhibited at the Royal Academy (1838, 1883, and 1884).<br>
