<span class="headword">Whitman,  Alfred Charles</span>  (1860&#150;1910), <span class="occ">writer on engravings</span>, was born at Hammersmith, London, on 12 October 1860, the youngest son of Edwin Whitman, a grocer, and his wife, Fanny. He was educated at St Mark's College School, Chelsea, after which he was employed by the firm of Henry Dawson &amp; Sons, a typo-etching company of Farringdon Street and Chiswick. On 12 August 1885 he married, at Hammersmith, Helena Mary Bing. Later that same year, on 21 December, Whitman was appointed an attendant in the department of prints and drawings in the British Museum. For some years he served in his spare time as amanuensis to the translator Lady Charlotte Schreiber, and helped her to arrange and catalogue her collections of fans and playing cards. He was promoted to the office of departmental clerk in the print department on 20 May 1903. His tact, patience, and courtesy, combined with an exceptional knowledge of the English prints in the collection, made his aid invaluable to the museum's visitors, and he acquired, in particular, a well-deserved reputation as an authority on British mezzotint engraving.<br>
<br>Whitman's earlier books, <span class="italic">The Masters of Mezzotint</span> (1898) and <span class="italic">The Print Collector's Handbook</span> (1901; new and enlarged edn, 1912), which were aimed at the amateur collector, were popular in character and have less permanent value than his catalogues of eminent engravers' works, which were the outcome of notes methodically compiled during many years, not only in the British Museum, but in private collections and salerooms. <span class="italic">Valentine Green</span>, published in 1902 as part of a series, <span class="italic">British Mezzotinters</span>, to which other writers contributed under his direction, is less satisfactory than <span class="italic">Samuel William Reynolds</span>, published in 1903 as the first volume in a series entitled <span class="roman">Nineteenth Century Mezzotinters</span>. It was followed by <span class="italic">Samuel Cousins</span> (1904) and <span class="italic">Charles Turner</span> (1907). These two books rank among the best catalogues of an engraver's work produced in England during this period.<br>
<br>Whitman's health began to fail in the autumn of 1908, and he died in London after a long illness, on 2 February 1910; he was survived by his wife. His annotated copy of J. C. Smith's <span class="italic">British Mezzotinto Portraits</span> was sold at Christies on 6 June 1910 for a considerable sum.<br>
