<span class="headword">Canning <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Stuart]</span>,  Charlotte Elizabeth</span>, Countess Canning  (1817&#150;1861), <span class="occ">courtier and vicereine of India</span>, was born at the British embassy in Paris on 31 March 1817, the elder of the two daughters of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26698/', "Sir Charles Stuart, later Baron Stuart de Rothesay (1779&#150;1845)")</script>, diplomatist, and his wife, Lady Elizabeth Yorke (1789&#150;1867), daughter of the third earl of Hardwicke. Like her sister Louisa [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/45749/', "Beresford, Louisa, marchioness of Waterford")</script>], Charlotte Stuart was celebrated for her beauty, piety, and artistic talent. Her appearance was enthusiastically described in 1853: &#145;She is very dark, with splendid eyes and rich black hair and the most classic outline of head and face&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters of the Hon. Mrs Edward Twisleton</span>, 139). At eighteen she married, on 5 September 1835, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/4554/', "Charles John Canning (1812&#150;1862)")</script>, only surviving son of the prime minister, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/4556/', "George Canning")</script>, and heir to his mother's viscountcy.<br>
<br>The early years of the marriage, which was childless, were spent in establishing Canning's political career, and in travel on the continent. Then in May 1842 Charlotte Canning was invited to become a lady of the bedchamber to Queen Victoria. This appointment, which entailed spending a fortnight in waiting on the queen three times a year, shaped her life for the next thirteen years. Although at this period the queen was too wrapped up in her husband to have much interest in the friendship of her courtiers, Lady Canning was a particular favourite, not least because she won the approval of Prince Albert. The prince was notorious for being unwilling even to talk to the ladies of the household, but Charlotte Canning's character was so impeccable that he unbent sufficiently to deem her &#145;such a distinguished person&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters of Queen Victoria</span>, 1st ser., 3.609). Her quiet charm, tolerance, and capacity for enjoyment endeared Lady Canning to the queen, and her artistic talents made her indispensable. Photography was in its infancy, and the queen herself seldom had time to make a complete visual record of the places she visited, so Charlotte Canning was often her choice of attendant for expeditions where her pencils and watercolours could be put to good use. Thus she accompanied the royal party on a yachting trip to the west country and to France in August 1843, and in the following month to Belgium. In 1844 she went with them on their second excursion to Scotland, staying at Blair Castle, and in 1845 on the visit to Albert's homeland of Coburg and Gotha. Lady Canning's facility with a pencil was matched by her ability to draw vivid word-pictures, and her many letters are a valuable mine of social detail.<br>
<br>Charlotte Canning was a devout high-churchwoman, and active in many charitable causes. As chairwoman of the committee of the Establishment for Gentlewomen during Illness, she had been responsible for the appointment of Florence Nightingale as superintendent of their hospital in Henley Street in 1853; she was criticized for not seeking the permission of Miss Nightingale's parents. Then with the outbreak of the Crimean War, Lady Canning was heavily involved in the interviewing and selection of nurses to accompany Florence Nightingale to Scutari.<br>
<br>In June 1855 Lord Canning accepted the post of governor-general of India. &#145;[I] will not take any part in the decision but only be ready to follow like a dog&#146;  (Surtees, 193), his wife wrote, rather dispiritedly. They left London in November, travelling to Calcutta via Paris, Malta, and Egypt, pausing in Bombay, Ceylon, and Madras before reaching their destination on 29 February 1856. The queen thanked her for her first letter, from Cairo, envying her former lady-in-waiting the opportunity to see the wonders of the East, though not its inconveniences: &#145;If it was not for the heat &amp; the <i>insects</i> how much I should like to see India&#146;, she wrote  (ibid., 197). Lady Canning now experienced court life from the other side, presiding over the society of the British in India, as well as being the hostess at the governor-general's court. With no formal duties, no family, a husband inevitably preoccupied with affairs of state, no British ladies of sufficiently high social status to make friends, and only very limited contact with Indian ladies, it was a lonely and challenging life. She was fortunate in the selection of her husband's aides-de-camp, who provided her regular companionship, even if, like Johnny Stanley, they had a tendency to fall in love with her.<br>
<br>The year of the Indian mutiny, 1857, put a tremendous emotional and physical strain on the Cannings. Charlotte was kept well away from the dangerous areas, but she gathered information assiduously, keeping the queen informed in detail of the events as they unfolded, and was able to dispel some of the worst atrocity stories: &#145;there is not a particle of evidence of the poor women having been &#147;ill-used&#148; anywhere&#146;, she wrote  (Surtees, 245). (Death, murder, starvation, and the mutilation of corpses did not compare to the horror felt at the idea of interracial rape.) To Lady Canning, the queen was able regularly to express her complete confidence in the beleaguered Canning, who was under continual pressure from the British at home and in India to exact a bloody retribution. Canning was able to rely on his wife to communicate with his colleagues in Britain when the pressures of the situation overwhelmed his correspondence. Lord Granville read a letter of hers to the cabinet in October 1857, drawing from the prime minister, Lord Palmerston, &#145;a compliment at the expense of her sex. &#147;Ah, ah, a capital letter, unlike a lady's letter; it is all to the point, ah, ah&#148;&#146;  (Fitzmaurice, 1.261).<br>
<br>The revolt over, Canning was elevated to an earldom, the government of India was removed from the hands of the East India Company, and the governor-generalship was transformed into a viceroyalty. The new vicereine travelled widely throughout India, from Madras in the south, to the borders of Tibet in the north. She sketched and painted as she went, and wrote detailed accounts of her travels to her family and to the queen. Despite the difficulties, she had come to enjoy India, but was looking forward to her frequently postponed return to England, which was set for January 1862. In October 1861 she journeyed through Darjeeling, to the borders of Sikkim, and saw Mount Everest, but her mind was on home and planning for the future there. She returned to Calcutta on 8 November, clearly suffering from &#145;jungle fever&#146;, or malaria. Four days later she was confined to bed, and shortly afterwards her mind started wandering, and she died at 2.30 in the morning of 18 November. She was buried the following day in the viceroy's garden at Barrackpore, &#145;looking upon that reach of the grand river which she was so fond of drawing,&#151;shaded from the glare of the sun by high trees,&#151;and amongst the bright shrubs and flowers in which she had so much pleasure&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters of Queen Victoria</span>, 1st ser., 3.608). The queen received news of Charlotte's death as her own husband lay dying; when Canning followed his wife to the grave seven months later, she thought him blessed: &#145;How enviable to follow so soon the partner of your life! How I pray it may be God's will to let me follow mine soon!&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters of Queen Victoria</span>, 2nd ser., 1.36).<br>
