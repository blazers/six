<span class="headword">Unstead,  Robert John</span>  (1915&#150;1988), <span class="occ">historian</span>, was born at Firth Dene, Stanhope Road, Deal, Kent, on 21 November 1915, the son of Charles Edmund Unstead, a Post Office clerk and telegraphist, and his wife, Elizabeth Nightingale. He later told how he &#145;took up writing seriously at the age of 9&#146;  (Unstead), when he was awarded the East Kent Wolf Cubs' prize for an essay on the British empire. Educated at Dover grammar school (1926&#150;33), he won a scholarship to Cambridge but could not afford to go and instead trained as a teacher at Goldsmiths' College, London (1933&#150;6). The proceeds of the sale of a couple of short stories to an evening newspaper paid for an engagement ring and he married Florence Margaret Thomas (<i>b</i>. 1917) on 27 May 1939 at St George the Martyr's Church, Deal; she was a chemist's assistant and the daughter of Oswald Frederick Thomas, a collier. They had three daughters. He taught from 1936 to 1940, when he joined the RAF and became a sector controller on combined operations in Normandy, Greece, and Italy. In 1946 he was appointed headmaster of Norton Road primary school, Letchworth, and in 1951 of the Grange School, Letchworth, where he remained until 1957. Thereafter he concentrated on writing.<br>
<br>Unstead reviewed for the <span class="italic">Times Educational Supplement</span>, producing protests from publishers as he scorned the turgid, matter-of-fact approach of many contemporary textbooks, declaring most history books to be written in a way calculated to put children off the subject for the rest of their lives. The publishers A. and C. Black took up his challenge and his <span class="italic">Looking at History</span>, published in four books (1953), constituted a new approach to the teaching of history in primary schools. As he remarked in the foreword to the <span class="italic">Middle Ages</span> volume, &#145;You will not find very much about kings, queens and battles in this book &hellip; this is a book about everyday people and things&#146;. Unstead wrote what might be termed &#145;inclusive history&#146;; his book <span class="italic">Castles</span> in 1970, for example, also dealt with fortified houses used in border warfare, showed how and why castles were built, defended, and attacked, and included a chapter entitled &#145;How to visit a castle&#146;. He aimed to stimulate the reader's imagination about life as it was lived. The <span class="italic">Times Literary Supplement</span> wrote of him that &#145;his narrative is always clear and his style direct and forceful&#146;. He was also concerned for accuracy and possessed of a passionate patriotism. On the cover of book 4 of <span class="italic">England: a History</span> (1963) he reproduced John Piper's window from the new Coventry Cathedral, and his philosophy was encapsulated in the book's foreword:<blockquote>at a time when it is fashionable in some quarters to belittle England's achievements in the past and to doubt her place in the future, I have tried to show that whereas England has often acted foolishly or badly, her history shows the persistence of ideals which good men have lived by since Alfred's day.</blockquote>The popularity of Unstead's books&#151;over 8 million copies were sold of <span class="italic">Looking at History</span> alone&#151;was based on perhaps two things above all else: his capacity for simplification, which was compared with Arthur Mee's in an earlier generation, and his recognition that most twentieth-century children preferred an illustrator's impression of a historical event to an authentic contemporary picture. His books were richly illustrated so as to bring history to life; his texts were tautly written. In more than fifty books he covered many civilizations ancient and modern&#151;Greece and Rome, Egypt, the British empire, Australia especially&#151;and he was able to make children's reference books, like the generously illustrated <span class="italic">History of the English-Speaking World</span> (1972), as fascinating as fiction. The books were often keenly priced and they sold exceptionally well; they appealed to children and teachers as basic texts and as sources for the topics and projects so popular in primary and middle schools in the 1960s and 1970s. To Unstead's delight, they were sometimes bought as Christmas and birthday presents.<br>
<br>Many of Unstead's titles were published overseas and this led to invitations to the United States, east Africa, and Australia, for example. His most ambitious work, <span class="italic">A History of the World</span> (1983), was targeted at a wider readership and was also a decided success. A small boy at a prep school wrote sorrowfully to ask whether Unstead could write a series about the ancient world which he had to study. The result was <span class="italic">Looking at Ancient History</span> (1959)&#151;another best-seller.<br>
<br>Unstead was a modest and humorous man who aroused much affection by his balance between heart and brain which put people of diverse backgrounds at ease. He worked hard for his fellow authors: he was founder and chairman of the Educational Writers' Group of the Society of Authors (1965&#150;8); a member of the Council of East Anglian Writers (1976&#150;88); and he campaigned vigorously for the Public Lending Right. He remained interested in education long after he left teaching, and was a governor of Leiston middle school (1973&#150;85). He gave freely of his time to young authors in particular and retained to the end a boyish enthusiasm as well as an outspokenness which marked him as an honest man and a sincere friend. He accepted philosophically that his early ambition to become a high-flown literary critic and novelist was not to be fulfilled. At the time of his death, from heart failure, at Ipswich Hospital, on 5 May 1988, he was working on a new book on the 1940s with his youngest daughter Sue, a children's publisher.<br>
<br>A keen golfer and gardener, a devoted follower of cricket, Unstead was above all a family man. He was survived by his wife and their three daughters. In the words of Sean Lang in <span class="italic">Teaching History</span>, &#145;not one single writer of children's history has yet even approached the eminence or creative productivity, never mind the affectionate esteem, which were the hallmarks of R. J. Unstead&#146;  (Lang, 26). He was deservedly promoted by his publishers as &#145;the young person's historian&#146;. As he remarked in his Dean lecture to Goldsmiths' College, in 1985, he &#145;wanted children to begin to understand that the past was different from the present and that it is unfair to judge people of the past by the standards and ideas of to-day&#146;  (Unstead).<br>
