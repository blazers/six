<span class="headword">Cianchettini,  Pio Lewis Frederick</span>  (1799&#150;1851), <span class="occ">composer and pianist</span>, was born on 11 December 1799 in London, the second child of the Roman-born Francesco (Francis) Cianchettini (1765/6&#150;1833), head of the London music publishers Cianchettini and Sperati, and his Bohemian wife, Catharina Veronica Anna Rosalia Dussek (1769&#150;1833), a pianist, harpist, singer, music teacher, and composer. Taught and fostered intensively by his parents, Cianchettini became a precocious linguist and a child prodigy on the piano. At a recital in the concert chamber of the London Opera House (now Her Majesty's Theatre) in 1805 he played an original sonata and improvised on given themes; later that year his father took him on an extensive and successful concert tour of Germany, Holland, and France, and by the age of nine he was performing a grand concerto of his own composition. Some idea of the manner in which he was produced may be gained from the dedication of his op. 2, published by his father's firm in 1807: &#145;To His Royal Highness, the Prince of Wales, these two Fantasias for the Piano-Forte, composed at the age of seven years by Pio Cianchettini surnamed Mozart Britannicus are &hellip; offered as a <i>Primizia</i> of his Infantine Musical Talents.&#146; The flattering sobriquet the &#145;British Mozart&#146; was, however, due more to Cianchettini's juvenile ability than to any lasting genius, and his early reputation fast declined, though in adult years he produced varied and abundant piano music as well as choral and vocal pieces, including a <span class="roman">Benedictus</span> for three soloists and chorus, a cantata based on Milton's <span class="italic">Paradise Lost</span>, and settings of Pope's <span class="italic">Ode on Solitude</span> and the Shakespeare song &#145;Take, o take those lips away&#146;; he also arranged a large group of Italian canons by Giambattista Martini, edited works by Mozart and Beethoven, and made himself a secondary fame as accompanist, conductor, and composer for the soprano Angelica Catalani during her English concert tours. But he never enjoyed the pecuniary fortune which might have been expected. From the mid-1830s he resided much in Cheltenham, where he taught music and performed his own works and those of his mother's family before often quite small audiences in St James's Church, at the Rotunda, and at the new organ of the Roman Catholic chapel in Somerset Place, to which he was as generous as circumstances allowed. In his public appearances he was frequently associated with two other provincial musicians, the tenor Antonio Sapio and the organist and string player John Uglow. On 21 June 1841 he married Emma Athanasia Everill (1820&#150;1849), with whom he had a son, Francis Pio Thomas, born on 20 September 1842, but indifferent health and money problems kept the family moving from address to address, and Emma died on 10 April 1849. Cianchettini, who suffered from chronic diarrhoea, died at 10 Northwick Terrace, Cheltenham, on 13 July 1851 and was buried at St Mary's parish church on 18 July. Friends in the town raised a subscription for his destitute orphaned son.<br>
