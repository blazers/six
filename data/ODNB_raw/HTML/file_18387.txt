<span class="headword">Maurice,  Thomas</span>  (1754&#150;1824), <span class="occ">oriental scholar and librarian</span>, was born at Hertford on 25 September 1754, and claimed descent from an ancient Welsh family. His father, Thomas, on retiring from West Indian commerce, opened an academy at Clapham, and married an elderly lady with some property. In 1753, shortly after the death of his first wife, Thomas married her eighteen-year-old maid; Thomas was the eldest of six children of this second marriage, although only he and one brother, William, survived to maturity. After his father's death in 1762, Thomas's mother converted to Methodism and was &#145;trepanned into a clandestine marriage&#146;  (Maurice, 1.4) with Joseph Wright, an Irish Methodist preacher, who mistreated her and from whom she was legally separated in 1771. Thomas was sent to Christ's Hospital, thence to Ealing, and subsequently, through his mother's influence, to the Methodist school at Kingswood, near Bath. He took chambers in the Inner Temple, but found the study of classical and English literature more attractive than that of law, and, under the tuition of Dr Samuel Parr at Stanmore, he devoted himself to the classics.<br>
<br>On 6 May 1774 Thomas Maurice matriculated from St John's College, Oxford, migrating after a year to University College, where he graduated BA in 1778 and MA in 1808. While at Oxford he published some poetry and a translation of Sophocles' <span class="italic">Oedipus tyrannus</span>, for which Samuel Johnson wrote a preface  (Boswell, <span class="italic">Life</span>, 3.370 n.2); this was the last extended preface he wrote for anyone else, and one of his best. Maurice also studied &#145;practical astronomy&#146; there. He was ordained by Bishop Lowth on leaving Oxford and became curate of Woodford, Essex; in 1779, through Johnson's influence, he was also offered the curacy of Bosworth. In 1783 he began work on his <span class="italic">History of Hindostan</span>, which was nearly completed by 1789. In 1784 he relinquished his curacy for the chapel of Epping, but about the same time a legacy from a wealthy relative enabled him to buy a chaplaincy in the 97th regiment, which was disbanded later in the same year. Maurice received half-pay for the rest of his life. On 10 August 1786 he married Hannah, the daughter of Thomas Pearce, a captain in the service of the East India Company; she died childless in 1790.<br>
<br>In 1789 Maurice interrupted work on the <span class="italic">History of Hindostan</span> for the more polemical <span class="italic">Indian Antiquities</span>, with a view to defending the <span class="roman">Pentateuch</span> from the attacks of sceptical French mythographers such as Baillie, Volney, and Dupuis, who sought to interpret religious myths, whether Hindu or Christian, as astronomical and natural allegories. Maurice was encouraged in this apologetic project by Sir William Jones, whom he had known at Oxford, and whose mythographical syncretism profoundly influenced his work. In 1795 Maurice published an elegiac poem on Jones's unexpected death. The first two volumes of <span class="italic">Indian Antiquities</span> were published in 1792; volume 3 appeared in 1793, 4 in 1794, 5 in 1795&#150;6, and 6 in 1796. <span class="italic">A Dissertation on the Oriental Trinities</span>, extracted from the fourth and fifth volumes of <span class="italic">Indian Antiquities</span>, was published in 1800, arguing that the Hindu triads, like the Christian Trinity, were vestiges of a universally revealed monotheism. Meanwhile, Maurice set about publishing his <span class="italic">History of Hindostan</span>: volume 1 appeared in 1795, volume 2 in 1798, and volume 3 in 1799. He went on to supplement his massive study of ancient Indian history with the <span class="italic">Modern History of Hindostan</span> (2 vols., 1802&#150;10) which brought his account up to the late eighteenth century. A staunch anti-Jacobin, he also reviewed works on oriental mythology for the tory high-church <span class="italic">British Critic</span>. In 1798 he was presented by Earl Spencer to the vicarage of Wormleighton, Warwickshire, and in the following year he was appointed assistant keeper of manuscripts in the British Museum. In 1804, on the presentation of the lord chancellor, he became vicar of Cudham, Kent. All these offices he retained until his death. In 1800 he obtained, through Bishop Tomline, the pension which had been enjoyed by William Cowper. In 1812, abandoning his earlier syncretist project of defending the historicity of the <span class="roman">Bible</span> from Hindu mythographical sources, he published <span class="italic">Brahminical Fraud Detected</span>. A second edition, entitled <span class="italic">The Indian Sceptic Refuted</span>, was published in 1813. Another work of apologetics, <span class="italic">Observations Connected with Astronomy and Ancient History</span>, appeared in 1816. Maurice's final publication was the uncompleted <span class="italic">Memoirs of the Author of &#145;Indian Antiquities&#146;</span> (1819&#150;22), which contains recollections of contemporary men of letters and casts new light on the composition of Johnson's <span class="italic">Lives of the Poets</span>. Maurice died on 30 March 1824 in his apartments at the British Museum.<br>
<br>Maurice was on intimate terms with many leading contemporary scholars and men of letters; his poetry and drama were widely read, although Lord Byron, in <span class="italic">English Bards and Scotch Reviewers</span>, described him as &#145;dull&#146; and his poem &#145;Richmond Hill&#146; as &#145;the petrifaction of a plodding brain&#146;. He was a voluminous author, but his researches in Asiatic history and myth were hampered by ignorance of Asiatic languages, and by his overriding polemical concern to refute French scepticism. His syncretist approach to mythology was of the school of Jacob Bryant, confident in comparing and contrasting different cultures on the basis of superficial etymological resemblance, without any understanding of grammar, syntax, or sound change. This etymological approach was rejected and discredited by Franz Bopp and other German comparative grammarians in the 1810s, rendering Maurice's scholarship largely obsolete. Today his work is largely of interest to students of Romantic literature and antiquarianism on account of its influence on Coleridge, Shelley, and other contemporary writers.<br>
