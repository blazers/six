<span class="headword">Alanson,  Edward</span>  (1747&#150;1823), <span class="occ">surgeon</span>, was born on 23 October 1747 in Newton-le-Willows, Lancashire, the son of John and Margaret Alanson. He was apprenticed to William Pickering, a surgeon to the Liverpool Infirmary, in 1763. In 1768 he went to London and became a house pupil of the surgeon and natural scientist, John Hunter. In 1770 he became a surgeon to the Liverpool Infirmary. Four years later he left the house of William Pickering and moved to Cable Street, Liverpool. In 1777 he became a partner of Henry Park, who was also a surgeon to the infirmary, and in the same year he moved to Basnett Street. Alanson became one of the first three surgeons appointed to the Liverpool Dispensary in 1778. In 1779 he published <span class="italic">Practical Observations on Amputation and the After-Treatment</span>. At about the same time he helped to found the Liverpool Medical Library and the Liverpool Blind Asylum. In 1790 he moved to Wavertree, near Liverpool. He resigned his post at the infirmary on the grounds of poor health four years later and moved to Aughton, near Ormskirk, where he continued to practise surgery. In 1808 he returned to Wavertree.<br>
<br>Alanson is best-known for his improvements in the technique of amputation, and his important suggestions for hospital reform were a vital adjunct to his new surgical methods. In the early part of the eighteenth century amputations were generally performed by a circular incision perpendicular to the limb. A large open wound remained which was dressed by dry lint and the arteries were tied off by passing a ligature around the entire mass of vessels. Alanson urged that operations be carefully planned in advance. He championed the flap technique, which had recently been revived by a few English surgeons. In this procedure the surgeon cut obliquely inwards towards the bone. The muscles were divided so that the cut end of the bone was covered and a flap of skin was left that could be used to cover the wound. Alanson suggested that the wound be cleansed with warm water and bandaged so that the edges formed a straight line across the stump: no dressings were to be used. He also urged that the arteries be drawn out and tied individually. Although it had been common for surgeons to expect suppuration of the wound as an inevitable concomitant of amputation, Alanson demonstrated that by these methods it was possible for these wounds to heal &#145;by the first intention&#146;, that is, without significant infection. Wounds healed with little fever or discharge and patients seldom needed opium to control post-operative pain. Moreover, the cushion of muscle provided a more useful and less vulnerable stump.<br>
<br>Alanson reported that, of forty-six traditional amputations that he had witnessed, ten patients died and the survivors suffered prolonged complications. Following his adoption of the new methods, there were no deaths and only a few minor complications in thirty-five patients treated without selection at the Liverpool Infirmary. This was the best record until the development of antisepsis by Joseph Lister.<br>
<br>Alanson and his colleagues obtained these results by making hospital reform an important part of their work. It is reported that he never performed an operation without washing his hands. He also urged that hospital wards be vacated and thoroughly cleansed every four months, that iron beds be used, that patients be washed on admission and dressed in clean clothes and that their own clothing be cleaned before discharge, that infectious patients be denied admission, that patients with offensive sores and surgical patients be placed in separate rooms, that hospitals remain uncrowded, that the windows of each ward be opened daily, and that infirmaries remove patients to country houses for recovery.<br>
<br>Alanson's innovations evolved in close consultation with his gifted colleagues at the Liverpool Infirmary&#151;the surgeons Henry Park and John Lyon, and the physicians Matthew Dobson, Henry Richmond, and Thomas Houlston&#151;as well as with several other innovative surgeons and local reformers. He himself did not claim to have originated many of his improvements, but his work is notable for the way in which many details of care and technique were combined to produce a dramatically improved outcome, and for the rigour with which he analysed his work. Together, these amounted to a significant advance in the practice of surgery.<br>
<br>In June 1775 Alanson married the daughter of Nehemiah Holland, a Liverpool merchant. Alanson died on 12 December 1823 in Wavertree. His wife died a year later; they were survived by five of their twelve children.<br>
