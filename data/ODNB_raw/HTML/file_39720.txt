<span class="headword">Silvester,  Eusebius</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1714, <em>d.</em> in or after 1759), <span class="occ">lawyer and projector</span>, was baptized at Tamworth, Staffordshire, on 19 January 1714, the first of the eight children of Nicholas Silvester (1680&#150;1745), gentleman, and his wife, Susanna, daughter of Euseby Dormer and his wife, Mary (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Fenwick). Feckless, self-pitying, and importunate, he owes his reputation to his correspondence of the 1750s with the novelist Samuel Richardson, which Richardson closed by threatening to circulate or publish as &#145;a <i>Warning Piece</i> to Posterity&#146;  (Forster MSS, XV, 1, fol. 58).<br>
<br>Early in the correspondence Silvester wrote that his life had been &#145;a confused Scene of Advers Perplexitys almost from my Cradle&#146;, owing first to the worldly failure of a father<blockquote>defeated by those very Qualitys which ought rather to have merited success; an open frankness and generosity of Heart, which led him, to place too much Confidence in those, who by an abuse of it, were the occasion of a series of Misfortunes which at length &hellip; weighed him down &amp; deprived him of his life! (Forster MSS, XIV, 4, fol. 4)</blockquote>The misfortunes, and the speculative and litigious temperament that drew them on, are copiously documented in chancery records concerning Nicholas Silvester. He shared with his son ambitious theories of land improvement, and ran into financial difficulties following his lease from Lord Weymouth in 1714 of property in Bangley Park, Staffordshire, and his later lease from Ralph Floyer of &#145;many hundreds of acres of waste and barren land&#146; in Hints, Staffordshire, which he claimed to have &#145;improved at vast expense&#146;  (TNA: PRO, C 11/2053/18). He first became mired in chancery proceedings in 1724 over a disputed legacy, and subsequent family wrangles, together with actions for arrears and debts arising from failed agricultural projects, involved him in protracted and ruinous litigation for the next two decades.<br>
<br>In his late teens Eusebius Silvester served for two and a half years as articled clerk to his uncle Thomas Harris of Dorking, but left about 1734, probably in connection with the family quarrels. He later served for two and a half years as clerk to George Garnett of Took's Court, Holborn, the address he gave when swearing an affidavit in May 1738 to secure his recognition as a qualified attorney. He duly appears in the rolls of the common bench attorneys, which give his place of residence as Middlesex until, in Michaelmas 1745, the addition &#145;now Warwick&#146; (where he remained) appears against his name.<br>
<br>In 1754 Silvester used a letter praising <span class="italic">Sir Charles Grandison</span> to initiate his correspondence with Richardson, which ended acrimoniously in 1759 after two meetings and at least forty-five letters. At the outset he made much of his refusal to conform to professional type, lamenting that his honesty gave him &#145;no great reason to believe, that I &hellip; ever shall attain to any great Eminence in my Profession&#146;, and made fellow attorneys think him &#145;a Dastardly Unnatural Brother&#146;  (Forster MSS, XIV, 4, fol. 5). Though Richardson later rebuked Silvester for his &#145;parading Epistles&#146;  (ibid., XV, 1, fol. 58), he seems to have been favourably impressed, and in November 1755 was still applauding &#145;that good Heart which so visibly dictates to y<sup>r</sup> Pen&#146;  (ibid., XIV, 4, fol. 8). At this point he seems to have complied with Silvester's request that he print &#145;a manuscript containing some Observations on Agriculture&#146;  (ibid., fol. 7), now untraced, but outlining ideas which, if ministerially adopted, would make his fortune: a later note by Richardson records that the project &#145;was to obtain Grants to himself of thousands of Acres &hellip; to be cultivated according to a Method invented by himself, and Father, he being a great Schemer in Agriculture&#146;  (ibid., fol. 26). At the same time Richardson advanced the first of two loans of &pound;25 in response to Silvester's worry that &#145;just in the very Crisis &amp; turn of my Fortune, I sho'd, after so many Years Painful Struggles, be dashed down &amp; sunk again &hellip; for want of that small Assistance&#146;  (ibid., fol. 11). It was only when repayment failed to materialize that Richardson's opinion began to change. Late in 1756 he frostily declined to print a further piece &#145;on a Popular Subject now under the Consideration of our Legislators&#146;  (ibid., XV, 1, fol. 38), and relations subsequently collapsed. Understandably, though perhaps unjustly, Richardson ended by thinking Silvester a cynical confidence-trickster, berating him for &#145;the Repetition of such gross Pretensions to <i>Integrity</i> of <i>Heart</i>, as you abounded with in every Letter, and continue thro' <span class="italic">Detection</span>&#146;  (ibid., fol. 58).<br>
<br>Undaunted by Richardson's refusal to touch the second piece, Silvester succeeded in publishing it (with a dedication dated 12 December 1757 to Francis Greville, Earl Brooke, of Warwick Castle) as <span class="italic">The causes of the present high price of corn and grain, and a state of the abuses and impositions practised &hellip; by the millers or meal-men</span>. A year later, in similar fraud-busting vein, he submitted a memorial to the Treasury commissioners, detailing how tanners were evading the duty on hides, and hoping to &#145;meet with Your Lordships Favour and Encouragement&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 32886, fol. 92). Thereafter he fades from the record, and his last surviving correspondence with Richardson is dated August 1759.<br>
