<span class="headword">Mackay,  Thomas</span>  (1849&#150;1912), <span class="occ">social theorist</span>, was born in Edinburgh on 10 December 1849, the eldest son of Aeneas John Mackay, a former major in the 16th regiment Bengal native infantry, and his wife, Eleanor Roberts. Mackay's mother died in 1855, leaving one brother, James. In 1864 both brothers were sent to Trinity College, Glenalmond, from where Thomas went in 1868 to New College, Oxford, where he took thirds in classical moderations and <i>literae humaniores</i>. He was admitted to the Inner Temple in 1871. In 1874, the same year in which he was called to the bar, he became engaged to Beatrice Baillie (<i>d</i>. 1899), the daughter of the Hon. and Revd John Baillie, canon of York. His prospective father-in-law appears to have doubted Mackay's ability to support a wife and family as a young barrister, and instead persuaded him to go into business. He thus became a partner in the wine business of Charles Kinloch, a first cousin of his father.<br>
<br>The offices of Kinloch and Mackay were situated in London's East End, a location that gave a practical stimulus to Mackay's interest in social and economic questions. He became a member, and then secretary, of the local committee of the Charity Organization Society (COS), an office he retained for twenty-five years; he also served as vice-chairman of the COS national council for eleven years. The COS worked to supplement the basic relief provided by the 1834 poor law with organized, charitable giving to the &#145;deserving&#146; poor, and Mackay's leading role in the society provided the bedrock for his subsequent investigations into the principles and methods of poor relief.<br>
<br>In 1885 Mackay's partnership with Kinloch ended, but he had acquired a sufficiently large fortune to enable him to devote his energies to a study of social problems. His first work, <span class="italic">The English Poor</span>, was published in 1889; its argument for the strict application of the 1834 poor law draws heavily upon the writings of Herbert Spencer, especially in support of the view that poor relief is the cause rather than the cure of social problems. Like Spencer, Mackay was committed to the principles of individualism, the doctrine which resisted the extension of the activities of the state beyond those necessary to protect liberty and property, and he became a member of the Liberty and Property Defence League. In 1891 he edited <span class="italic">A Plea for Liberty</span>, intended as the league's riposte to the <span class="italic">Fabian Essays in Socialism</span>. Mackay himself contributed the chapter on &#145;Investment&#146;, and Auberon Herbert and Wordsworth Donisthorpe also provided chapters. Herbert Spencer wrote the introduction. Three years later this volume was followed by another, also edited by Mackay, under the title of <span class="italic">A Policy of Free Exchange</span>.<br>
<br>Mackay continued to publish on social topics throughout the 1890s. An anonymous pamphlet, <span class="italic">The Great Coalition: an Adventure in Statecraft</span> (1893), satirized the efforts of social reformers. More substantial was <span class="italic">Methods of Social Reform</span> (1896), a collection of review articles, and <span class="italic">The State and Charity</span> (1898), which appeared in the <span class="roman">English Citizen</span> series. In 1899 Mackay published his chief work, <span class="italic">A History of the English Poor Law from 1834 to the Present Day</span>, which was technically a continuation of the <span class="italic">History</span> begun by Sir George Nicholl. In all these writings Mackay emphasized the debilitating effects on the character of the poor of state benefits and indiscriminate charity, and argued that the solution to social problems must reside in self-help and voluntary action.<br>
<br>Mackay edited the autobiography of Samuel Smiles (1905) and was also the author of biographies of the engineer Sir John Fowler (1900) and of Albert Pell (1908), a friend who shared many of his social views. He contributed frequently to the leading reviews and to <span class="italic">The Spectator</span>. In 1894 he was awarded an honorary degree by the University of St Andrews.<br>
<br>Mackay's first wife died in 1899, leaving him childless, and in 1905 he remarried, his second wife being the eldest daughter of James Augustus Grant, the African explorer. She died in 1907, leaving an infant son who did not long survive her. Mackay himself died at his London home, 89 Iverna Court, Kensington, of heart failure on 23 February 1912.<br>
