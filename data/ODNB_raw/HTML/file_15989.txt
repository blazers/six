<span class="headword">Lane,  Edward</span>  (1605&#150;1685), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, was elected a scholar at St Paul's School, London, where he was a pupil of Alexander Gill the elder. He was admitted on 4 July 1622 to St John's College, Cambridge, graduating BA in 1626 and proceeding MA in 1629. Ordained priest on 22 September 1628 he was presented in 1631 (admitted 24 March) to the vicarage of North Shoebury, Essex, by the crown, through the lord keeper, Thomas Coventry. He resigned on 28 January 1636, being presented by the same patron to the vicarage of Sparsholt, Hampshire. He was also rector of Lainston, Hampshire, a parish adjoining, probably from 1637. On 9 July 1639 he was incorporated MA at Oxford. In 1644, being a &#145;time of warre&#146;, Lane was absent from Sparsholt: he was recommended by the Westminster assembly on 27 February 1645 to fill the sequestrated benefice of Sholden, Kent.<br>
<br>Lane's writings resulted from controversy. <span class="italic">Look unto Jesus</span> (1663) expanded a sermon first preached before the Restoration, when it had stirred up controversy because it accepted the celebration of Christmas; it was published as a defence of the restored Church of England (bound with the British Library copy is an autograph manuscript entitled &#145;A taste of the everlasting ffeast &hellip; in Heaven&#146;). <span class="italic">Mercy Triumphant</span> (1680) and <span class="italic">Du Moulin's Reflections Reverberated</span> (1681) attacked the assertion of Lewis Du Moulin's <span class="italic">Moral Reflections on the Number of the Elect</span> (1680) that the elect might be fewer than one in a million as contrary to the gospel, harmful to godliness and troubled souls, and opposed to the riches of God's mercy. Postscripts to <span class="italic">Du Moulin's Reflections</span> attacked transubstantiation (and in passing, Lutheran consubstantiation) and, against the Erastian Edmund Hickeringill, defended church courts. &#145;A discourse of the waters of Noah&#146;, left in manuscript at his death, was a reply to Thomas Burnet's <span class="italic">The Sacred Theory of the Earth</span> (1684).<br>
<br>Although Lane remained an incumbent throughout the interregnum, after the Restoration he wrote of Charles I as a saint and martyr. He also then defended divine right episcopacy, bowing at the name of Jesus, and the use of set forms of prayer, which he claimed to be the general practice of the Reformed churches. He argued that those who had taken the solemn league and covenant could conscientiously disavow it. Next to scripture he sought the guidance of &#145;my good Mother the Holy Church of England&#146;  (<span class="italic">Mercy Triumphant</span>, 40). Roman Catholicism he considered a Babylon of error and novelty, and dissenting conventicles he scorned for blasphemy, narrowness, and sedition. Lane was convinced that the Jews would eventually be converted to Christianity.<br>
<br>Lane's incumbency at Sparsholt lasted fifty years. He had collected and transcribed the parish registers from 1607, and was reputed to be an exemplary parish clergyman. He was also rector of Nursling, Hampshire, from 1667 until his death. He died on 2 September 1685 and was buried on 4 September in the chancel of Sparsholt church. His wife, Mary, had been buried on 27 October 1669. None of his children survived him: Edward, who had been in Ireland, was buried on 17 May 1660; Henry, baptized on 11 April 1639, who had been a scholar at New College, Oxford, was buried on 6 October 1659.<br>
