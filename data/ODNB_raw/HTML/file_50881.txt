<span class="headword">Bowles family</span>  (<em>per. </em><em>c.</em>1690&#150;<em>c.</em>1830), <span class="occ">print and mapsellers</span>, came to prominence with <a name="cosubject_64978"></a><span class="headword">Thomas [i] Bowles</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1721)<span class="occ"></span> who was possibly the son of John Bowles, a joiner of St Lawrence Poultry, whose will was proved in 1652. A Thomas Bowles published a broadside dated 1683 and in that year Harrhman, son of Thomas Bowles and his wife, Anne, was baptized on 1 March at St Gregory by Paul's. The first certain record of the printseller was the publication in 1691 of a print of a triumphal arch, from his house on the corner of Paul's Alley next to the chapter house in St Paul's Churchyard. A plan of the house, which was leased from the bishop of London, is attached to the deeds in the Guildhall Library. It remained the principal family shop for over a century and for most of that time the Bowles were one of two dynasties dominating the flourishing London print trade. Thomas Bowles died on 5 April 1721, &#145;haveing left off trade and being out of business for some time before his death&#146;  (inventory, CLRO, common serjeant's book 6, box 47, fol. 57b). At that time he was described as a citizen and joiner of St Gregory by Paul's; he also owned four tenements in London House Yard and a half-share in two houses in Bloomsbury. Among his most notable publications were views of the new St Paul's Cathedral (1708), and the set of large prints of the duke of Marlborough's victories (1717) after Louis Laguerre, for which Claude Du Bosc was paid the handsome sum of &pound;80 per plate.<br>
<br>This latter undertaking may, in fact, have been the initiative of <a name="cosubject_50881"></a><span class="headword">Thomas [ii] Bowles</span>  (1689/90?&#150;1767)<span class="occ"></span>, who took over the running of the business from his father about 1714. He was first recorded in 1695 with his sister, Anne, as surviving children of Thomas Bowles. His birth is not recorded in the parish registers of St Gregory which survive up to 1687 but in its report of his death in 1767 the <span class="italic">London Evening-Post</span> gave his age as eighty-seven. This is inherently unlikely since it would have made Bowles twenty-four years old when apprenticed to his father in 1704 and it is possible that the report erred by exactly ten years. He was made free of the Joiners' Company in 1711 and about that time he married Bethia Stevens.<br>
<br>Although best-known for his ruthless piracy and commercial exploitation of the ideas of artists such as William Hogarth, Thomas [ii] Bowles was also an energetic and enterprising publisher in his own right. In 1720 his <span class="italic">Bubble Cards</span> and other South Sea Company satires achieved nationwide distribution. During the next decade he undertook an impressive set of sea pieces after Thomas Baston (1726) and an even more ambitious series of historical prints of the life of Charles I (1727) which George Vertue considered &#145;well deserves being Collected as one of the productions in the Art of Graving here, whereby, alone may be seen the improvements by encouragement this Art has obtaind in London within the space of Twenty Years&#146;  (Vertue, <span class="italic">Note books</span>, 6.191). In 1743 he and his brother <a href="#cosubject_52220">John [<i>see below</i>]</a> published prints of the paintings that decorated Vauxhall Gardens and from about that date they launched a long series of topographical views depicting the sights of London and the surrounding villages. Thomas [ii] Bowles retired from business in 1763, and on 8 April 1767 &#145;the great printseller&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 37, 1767, 192) died at his house in Stoke Newington leaving most of his estate to his daughter Bethia Squire and her two sons, William and Thomas. He was succeeded in the shop (now numbered 69 St Paul's Churchyard) by his nephew <a href="#cosubject_50880">Carington [<i>see below</i>]</a>, as his own son, Thomas, had predeceased him. <a name="cosubject_71625"></a><span class="headword">Thomas [iii] Bowles</span>  (1712?&#150;1762), <span class="occ">designer and engraver</span>, is said to have been born in 1712 and was trained as an engraver, producing competent botanical plates for <span class="italic">Pomona, or, The Fruit-Garden Illustrated</span> (1729) and numerous topographical engravings, some of which were after his own design. His death on 23 December 1762 was recorded four days later in the <span class="italic">Public Advertiser</span>; his wife, Margaret, survived him.<br>
<br>Most of Thomas [ii] Bowles's ventures were undertaken in partnership with his younger brother <a name="cosubject_52220"></a><span class="headword">John Bowles</span>  (1701?&#150;1779)<span class="occ"></span>. He was under twenty-one years old when his father, Thomas [i] Bowles, died in 1721 and is said to have been born in 1701. He was made free of the Joiners' Company by patrimony on 7 May 1723. By his father's will Thomas [ii] Bowles was obliged to pay him &pound;500 at age twenty-one, twenty-three, or twenty-five and another &pound;500 later. He had set up at Mercer's Hall in Cheapside by May 1725 and was still there in 1731, but had moved to the Black Horse, Cornhill, by February 1734. His first notable publication was <span class="italic">Several Prospects of the most Noted Publick Buildings, in and about the City of London</span> (1724) and maps and topographical views remained a principal speciality of the firm. Beginning with <span class="italic">A Catalogue of Maps, Prints, Books and Books of Maps</span> (1728), John Bowles issued successive printed catalogues of his stock, facilitating trade with merchants and provincial shopkeepers. By February 1753 he was in partnership with his son&#151;presumably Carington&#151;and the partnership persisted until Carington took over his uncle Thomas's business during 1763. John continued at the Black Horse, subsequently no. 13 Cornhill, until he died in 1779. He married Mary Carington and at his death had four surviving children, John, Carington, Mary, and Margaret. His considerable fortune was divided between his children but John's was to be paid in small allowances to avoid:<blockquote>his submitting again to be gulled preyed upon and exhausted by those Monsters in imposture cruelty and wickedness who have already drained him of an handsome ffortune and regardless of the Misery and ruin they bring upon him are ready to assail him entising with diabolic artifice and to bubble him out of any bequest I might bestow. (will, PROB 11/1056/335)</blockquote>Most of John Bowles's stock of plates and prints passed after his death to Robert Wilkinson.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_50880"></a><span class="headword">Carington Bowles</span>  (1724&#150;1793), <span class="occ">printseller</span>, the son of John Bowles, was born on 1 April 1724. He was apprenticed to his father on 2 March 1741, was made free of the Joiners' Company on 2 March 1752, and soon became his father's partner, trading as John Bowles &amp; Son until he took over his uncle's shop. His father left him only a token legacy &#145;as I have already advanced him and he is not only in a very flourishing business but possessed of a plentiful ffortune out of Trade&#146;  (will, PROB 11/1056/335). Carington's characteristic contribution to the family publishing interest was comic prints, or &#145;drolls&#146;. He became the principal publisher of the designs of John Collett and later of Robert Dighton and they, with lesser designers, produced hundreds of droll prints which comment with rumbustious humour on the social preoccupations of the time. Carington Bowles died on 30 June 1793 at Kensington Gore, London, and was succeeded in business by his son <a name="cosubject_64979"></a><span class="headword">Henry Carington Bowles</span>  (1763&#150;<em>c.</em>1830)<span class="occ"></span>. Henry Bowles, born on 31 August 1763, was made free of the Joiners' Company on 7 December 1784 and was in livery by 1792. He traded in partnership as Bowles and Carver until shortly before his death in 1830.<br>
