<span class="headword">Kitchin,  Thomas</span>  (1719&#150;1784), <span class="occ">cartographer and engraver</span>, was born in the parish of St Olave, Southwark, most probably on 4 August 1719, apparently the eldest of several children of Thomas Kitchin, hat dyer, and his wife, Mary Birr, whom he married in 1716.<br>
<br>Kitchin was apprenticed to the map engraver Emanuel Bowen on 6 December 1732. He finished his time in 1739 and on 25 December that year married his master's daughter, Sarah. Despite the family connection with his former master Kitchin was at work independently from at least 1741. From 1746, when he was made free of the Merchant Taylors' Company, he took on apprentices in his expanding firm. His early production includes John Elphinstone's map of Scotland (1746), used before Culloden, the first pocket atlas of Scotland, <span class="italic">Geographia Scotiae</span> (1748&#150;9), and <span class="italic">The Small English Atlas</span> (1749), co-published with Thomas Jefferys, another of Bowen's apprentices. The <span class="italic">Large English Atlas</span> (serially produced with Bowen between 1749 and 1760) was the most important county atlas since Elizabethan times and the first real attempt to cover the whole country at large scale. In 1755 Kitchin engraved the great John Mitchell map of North America, used at the peace treaties of Paris and Versailles, and the standard map until the end of the century.<br>
<br>Originally based in Clerkenwell, by late 1755 Kitchin was established at The Star (no. 59), Holborn Hill, opposite Ely House, running a substantial business producing all kinds of engraved material, even including portraits and caricatures. Further county atlases appeared in the 1760s. Larger individual works were Andrew Armstrong's survey of Northumberland (1769), awarded a 50 guinea prize by the Society of Arts, the twelve-sheet road map <span class="italic">England and Wales</span> (1770), and Bernhard Ratzer's elegant plans of New York (1769&#150;70). From 1773 Kitchin appears in the <span class="italic">Royal Kalendar</span> as hydrographer to the king. Eventually retiring from Holborn to St Albans, Kitchin continued map making to the end of his life. Prolific and reliable, he produced countless maps for travel books and geographies, and the 170 maps he produced for the <span class="italic">London Magazine</span> alone (1747&#150;83) would prove sufficient companion for the entire history of his time.<br>
<br>As an engraver, Kitchin showed a fine technical facility, the lettering clean and assured and the etched decoration from his workshop among the most impressive of all English rococo work. He is also known as an amateur painter. Clues to his personal life are meagre. An early publication, <span class="italic">The English Orpheus</span>, a collection of drinking songs of about 1743, is light-hearted, especially where it appears to poke fun at Kitchin's Welsh master. The well-written <span class="italic">Traveller's Guide</span> (1783) has both wry humour and relaxed confidence. He was extremely active in the Baptist community and served as deacon of his chapel. His will, which requests burial &#145;with as little expense as may be&#146;, shows a more than conventional piety.<br>
<br>Kitchin married his second wife, Jane (1719/20&#150;1789), daughter of the Baptist minister Joseph Burroughs, on 27 May 1762. To the latter he left a comfortable estate. His son of the first marriage, Thomas Bowen Kitchin, apprenticed to his father in 1754 and also hydrographer to the king, had already inherited the stock-in-trade. Kitchin died in St Albans on 23 June 1784 and was buried in St Albans Abbey on 29 June. A memorial inscription in St Albans Abbey has not survived.<br>
