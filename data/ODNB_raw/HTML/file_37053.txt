<span class="headword">Moore,  Mary Charlotte</span> <span class="st"> [<em>married name </em>Mary Charlotte Wyndham, Lady Wyndham]</span>  (1861&#150;1931), <span class="occ">actress and theatre manager</span>, was born in Islington, London, on 3 July 1861, the fifth child and third and youngest daughter of Charles Moore of Dublin and his wife, Haid&eacute;e Sophie Acland. When Mary was born her father was a prosperous parliamentary agent, but financial ruin hit the family in 1873. Mary, aged twelve, had to collect rents from slum houses in Hoxton, an experience which taught her the value of money (and, incidentally, gave her a reputation in later life for stinginess). Her education was interrupted by lack of money though she did attend Warwick Hall, Maida Vale, when a German couple needed someone to accompany their daughter to the school. She learned a little German, which would be useful during her career.<br>
<br>Although untrained, Mary Moore could sing and at fifteen she joined the chorus of <span class="italic">The Bohemian Girl</span> and <span class="italic">Little Doctor Faust</span> (by H. J. Byron) at the Gaiety Theatre. On 12 June 1878, aged sixteen, she married the dramatist <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/278/', "James Albery (1838&#150;1889)")</script>; they lived for a time in his bachelor chambers in Southampton Street off the Strand. Three sons were born and they moved to Fairlawn, Stone, Greenhithe, Kent. They subsequently returned to London, taking 11 Bentinck Terrace facing Regent's Park. This was not a wise move, being close to the temptations of the West End which Albery was unable to resist. For the second time in her life Mary experienced a collapse in family fortunes; by the mid-1880s James Albery, owing to ill health and alcoholism, could no longer write, so Mary had to support him and the children. She had known <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/37051/', "Charles (later Sir Charles) Wyndham (1837&#150;1919)")</script> when he commissioned Albery to adapt <span class="italic">Dominos roses</span> and other French plays, so she nervously approached him for work. He was so shocked by her changed appearance that he doubted whether he could engage her. When he did it was as an understudy on tour. Mary quickly realized that he did not intend to do more than this (out of kindness) and pay her &pound;4 a week. She told him she must be allowed to appear if her career was to progress. Wyndham gave her two small parts in farces at the Criterion Theatre and when he saw what she could do he gave her the leading part of Lady Amaranth in John O'Keeffe's <span class="italic">Wild Oats</span>, in which he played Jack Rover. When he followed this with a revival in November 1886 of T. W. Robertson's <span class="italic">David Garrick</span>, with Mary as Ada Ingot, their stage partnership was established. With this encouragement her good looks returned and she retained her slim figure for many years. They played <span class="italic">David Garrick</span> at Sandringham and were invited to take it to Berlin, where they played in German. Wyndham was fluent in the language but Mary had to study. One German critic commented: &#145;Miss Moore does not speak our language as well as her talented companion, but with what a consoling charm!&#146;  (Moore, 60). They also played&#151;in German&#151;before the tsar in St Petersburg. <span class="italic">David Garrick</span> would be their most enduring production.<br>
<br>The Alberys separated four years before James's death from cirrhosis of the liver in 1889. When an obituarist accused Mary of neglecting him, she was tempted to sue, but received a written apology.<br>
<br>Recognizing that Mary Moore had a superior head for business, Wyndham sealed their business partnership in 1896 and together they planned to enlarge their empire by building two theatres on land occupied by old houses between Charing Cross Road and St Martin's Lane. The marquess of Salisbury, then prime minister, was the ground landlord, and stated that no theatres should be built there unless they were for Charles Wyndham, whose acting he admired; Wyndham's Theatre opened in 1899 and the New Theatre in 1903.<br>
<br>Mary Moore was a woman of good sense who excelled at playing the opposite&#151;the sillier the woman the better, and such parts were written for her by Henry Arthur Jones in <span class="italic">The Case of Rebellious Susan</span> (1894), <span class="italic">The Liars</span> (1897), and <span class="italic">Mrs Dane's Defence</span> (1900), and by Hubert Henry Davies in <span class="italic">Mrs Gorringe's Necklace</span> (1903) and <span class="italic">The Mollusc</span> (1907), in which she gave a remarkable performance, seldom moving from the sofa on which she reclined. As Irene Vanbrugh, who appeared with her in <span class="italic">The Liars</span>, said of her: she &#145;still held without effort after a number of years the title of the perfect <i>ing&eacute;nue</i>&#146;  (I. Vanbrugh, <span class="italic">To Tell my Story</span>, 1949, 38).<br>
<br>The acting partnership continued until 1913; Wyndham also preserved a youthful spirit and figure until failing memory compelled his retirement at the age of seventy-six. Mary acted little without him. On 1 March 1916, after the death of Wyndham's wife, she married her business partner in order to be able to take care of him. After Wyndham's death in 1919 she made one successful appearance in a new play and then devoted herself to managing her theatres (she founded Wyndham Theatres Ltd in 1924) with the assistance of her stepson, Howard Wyndham, and her son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30754/', "Bronson Albery")</script>. When no one attempted to write a biography of Wyndham she wrote her own memoirs, <span class="italic">Charles Wyndham and Mary Moore</span> (1925), which her family insisted should be privately printed as they feared the prejudice against a mistress. In her last years she suffered a disfiguring illness and died in London on 6 April 1931.<br>
