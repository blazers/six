<span class="headword">Knight,  Thomas</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1820), <span class="occ">actor and playwright</span>, was born in Dorset of a family which was of some importance but not wealthy. He was intended for the bar, and received lessons in elocution from the actor Charles Macklin. A favourite with Macklin, he accompanied him to the theatre, and acquired in his visits tastes that led him to adopt the stage as a profession. At an unrecorded date he appeared at the Richmond theatre as Charles Surface, but failed conspicuously. He then joined Austin's company at Lancaster. Before leaving London he tried vainly to force upon Macklin payment for his services as a teacher. Tate Wilkinson saw Knight, it is said, in Edinburgh, and engaged him for the York circuit. His first appearance was made in York in 1782 as Lothario to the Calista of Dorothy Jordan. Wilkinson, who was greatly disappointed with him, advised him to quit the stage, but Knight struggled on, playing Charles Oakley, Spatterdash in John O'Keefe's <span class="italic">The Young Quaker</span>, and Carbine in <span class="italic">The Fair American</span>, and gradually grew in public favour. Wilkinson generously acknowledged the error of his former judgement, and during the five years in which Knight remained with the company he took the lead, and had only one quarrel with the management: finding his name as Twineall in <span class="italic">Such Things Are</span> put third on the list, the customary place for the character, he refused to appear. On 27 October 1787 he played at the Bath theatre as the Copper Captain. Spatterdash, the Duke of Monmouth in <span class="italic">Such Things Were</span>, and the Marquis in <span class="italic">The Midnight Hour</span> followed.<br>
<br>In 1787 Knight married at Bath <a name="cosubject_60135"></a><span class="headword">Margaret Farren</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1804), <span class="occ">actress</span>, the sister of the countess of Derby. She was the daughter of George Farren, a surgeon and apothecary in Cork, and his wife, whose father was a Liverpool publican and brewer named Wright. Both George Farren and his wife acted. Margaret Farren had been seen at an early age in London, having played at the Haymarket on 18 June 1777, under the name Peggy Farren, Titania in <span class="italic">The Fairy Tale</span>, a two-act adaptation of <span class="italic">A Midsummer Night's Dream</span>. She joined Wilkinson in 1782, left him to act in Scotland and Ireland, and rejoined him in 1786. In that year she appeared with Knight in York, where she was a favourite. Soon after her marriage she made her first appearance in Bath as Miss Peggy in <span class="italic">The Country Girl</span> to her husband's Sparkish. In the course of the same season Knight acted thirty characters, among which Touchstone, Trappanti, Claudio in <span class="italic">Measure for Measure</span>, Trim in <span class="italic">The Funeral</span>, Sir Charles Racket, and Pendragon may be mentioned. In Bath, as at Bristol, which was under the same management, he played during the nine years of his engagement an endless variety of comic parts&#151;Charles Surface, Antonio in <span class="italic">Follies of a Day</span>, the Clown in <span class="italic">All's Well that Ends Well</span>, Mercutio, Duret&ecirc;te, Goldfinch, Dromio of Ephesus, Pistol, and Autolycus being among the most easily recognizable.<br>
<br>Knight's first appearance at Covent Garden took place on 25 September 1795, as Jacob in <span class="italic">The Chapter of Accidents</span> (when his wife played Bridget) and Skirmish in <span class="italic">The Deserter</span>. The most important of the huge number of parts he took at the theatre were Sim in <span class="italic">Wild Oats</span>, Hodge, Bob Acres, Slender in <span class="italic">The Merry Wives of Windsor</span>, Roderigo, Gratiano, Dick Dowlas, Sir Benjamin Backbite, Tony Lumpkin, Sergeant Kite in <span class="italic">The Recruiting Officer</span>, Sir Andrew Aguecheek, Touchstone, and Lucio in <span class="italic">Measure for Measure</span>. His original parts included Young Testy in Holman's <span class="italic">Abroad and at Home</span>, Count Cassel in Elizabeth Inchbald's adaptation <span class="italic">Lovers' Vows</span>, Changeable in Thomas Dibdin's <span class="italic">The Jew and the Doctor</span>, Farmer Ashfield in Morton's <span class="italic">Speed the Plough</span>, and Corporal Foss in <span class="italic">The Poor Gentleman</span>. After the couple had remained for three years at Covent Garden, they went together to Edinburgh, where she played on 2 July 1799 Aura in <span class="italic">The Farm House</span>, and he made what was called, probably in error, his first appearance in the city as Sir Harry Beagle in <span class="italic">The Jealous Wife</span>. Margaret Knight afterwards performed at Newcastle and elsewhere before returning to Bath, where she died on 28 July 1804.<br>
<br>With well-known artists such as J. G. Holman, H. Johnston, J. S. Munden, and Charles Incledon, Knight signed the significant <span class="italic">Statement of the differences subsisting between the proprietors and performers of the Theatre-Royal, Covent Garden</span> (3rd edn, London, 1800). The lease of the Liverpool Theatre was taken by Knight in partnership with the actor W. T. Lewis, and the house opened on 6 June 1803 with <span class="italic">No Song, No Supper</span> and Thomas Morton's <span class="italic">Speed the Plough</span>, together with an address by Thomas Dibdin, spoken by Knight. During this season Knight remained at Covent Garden, where his last performance took place for his benefit, on 15 May 1804, as Farmer Ashfield in <span class="italic">Speed the Plough</span>, and, for the first time, Lenitive in <span class="italic">The Prize</span>. He also spoke an address. In 1802 he was living at 10 Tavistock Street, Covent Garden. While managing the Liverpool theatre he lived first at Norton Hall, Lichfield, and then at Woore, Shropshire. In 1817 a new lease was granted to Knight, Thomas Lewis, a son of his late partner, and Banks, with whom Knight became associated in the management of the Manchester theatre. Knight died, with &#145;appalling suddenness&#146;, at the Manor House, Woore, on 4 February 1820.<br>
<br>Knight wrote many pieces himself. His <span class="italic">Thelyphthora, or, The Blessings of Two Wives at Once</span>, a farce, was acted at Hull in 1783, but neither printed nor apparently brought to London; <span class="italic">Trudge and Wowski</span>, a prelude, supposedly from <span class="italic">Inkle and Yarico</span>, was acted by Knight in Bristol in 1790, and <span class="italic">Honest Thieves</span>, a two-act abridgement of <span class="italic">The Committee</span>, by Sir Robert Howard, was produced at Covent Garden, with Knight as Abel, on 9 May 1797. On 14 November 1799 he appeared at Covent Garden as Robert Maythorn in his own <span class="italic">The Turnpike Gate</span>. This farce was printed in 1799, was well received, went through five editions in two years, and was constantly performed. Charles Munden made a noteworthy success in it as Crack. The anonymous author of the &#145;Managers' note-book&#146;, which appeared in the <span class="italic">New Monthly Magazine</span>, attributes to Knight <span class="italic">The Masked Friend</span>, an anonymous and unprinted reduction to three acts of Holcroft's <span class="italic">Duplicity</span>, given at Covent Garden on 6 May 1796, with Knight as Squire Turnbull and his wife as Miss Turnbull. The same author attributes to him <span class="italic">Hints for Painters</span>, an unprinted farce, given on the same occasion, and <span class="italic">What would the Man be at?</span> a one-act piece, unprinted, in which Knight played Charles, George, and Will Belford, three brothers. Knight also wrote an <span class="italic">Ode on the Late Naval War and the Siege of Gibraltar</span> (1784) and some comic songs or recitations.<br>
<br>Although he lived in good style, and consorted with men of science and letters, Knight accumulated considerable savings, which were augmented by a legacy from an uncle. His repertory was not unlike that of his namesake Edward Knight. He had a light and elegant figure, a melodious voice, and much sense and tact. As Watty Cockney in <span class="italic">The Romp</span>, a version of Isaac Bickerstaff's <span class="italic">Love in the City</span>, chosen for his second part, he did not create much effect, and his wife's Priscilla Tomboy was a failure, the result being that both were relegated for a time into obscurity. His great parts were Jacob Gawkey, Plethora in Thomas Morton's <span class="italic">Secrets Worth Knowing</span>, Count Cassel, and Farmer Ashfield, all very distinct characterizations. His Master Stephen in Ben Jonson's <span class="italic">Every Man in his Humour</span>, which he revived, also won much praise. During the latter part of his life he assumed the position of a country gentleman, and he left a reputation for great liberality.<br>
