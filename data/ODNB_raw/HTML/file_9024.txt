<span class="headword">Exley,  Thomas</span>  (1775&#150;1855), <span class="occ">natural philosopher and scriptural commentator</span>, was born in Gowdall, Yorkshire. Little is known of his first thirty years. He is sometimes described as an MA, but it is not known if he attended a university. However, it is certain that he maintained an interest in a wide spectrum of academic and literary disciplines, for in 1812 he co-authored, with the Revd William Moore Johnson, the four volume <span class="italic">Imperial encyclopaedia, or, Dictionary of the sciences and arts; comprehending also the whole circle of miscellaneous literature</span>. About the time of this publication Exley was employed as a mathematics instructor in a Bristol school, a situation he retained until his retirement in 1847. During the first half of his life he was also involved in a variety of theological disputes, especially concerning the eternal Sonship of Jesus. In 1817&#150;18 he joined forces with his brother-in-law, Adam Clarke, to answer a number of pamphlets which maintained that even after his ascension into heaven, Jesus was not the equal of the Father.<br>
<br>Exley is best remembered for his controversial scientific speculations. As a natural philosopher he explicitly rejected the complex series of attractive and repulsive spheres which he insisted corrupted the matter theories of Newton and Boscovich, and instead proposed a system of subtle and gross particles for which there were no eighteenth-century precedents. This system was developed in many works, including his <span class="italic">Principles of Natural Philosophy</span> (1829) and his <span class="italic">New Theory of Physics</span> (1841). In particular he posited the existence of four types of matter: common or tenacious, electric, ethereal, and microgenic. He first proposed the existence of microgen, &#145;exceedingly small atoms&#146;, at the 1838 meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of Science. Although his account fared poorly in the philosophical market place, he contended that their presence could account for &#145;miasmata of marshes, infections, odiferous effluvia, and other phenomena&#146;  (Exley, 34), as well as animalcules and their ova.<br>
<br>Exley employed his conception of matter and forces to tackle a multitude of other problems in chemistry and optics. In chemistry he produced novel formulations of atomic combinations, gaseous vapours, and specific gravities. In addition, he exploited his conception of common matter, ether, and short-range attractive and repulsive forces in order to develop a sophisticated account of optical phenomena such as flexion, refraction, and polarization. In his <span class="italic">Physical Optics, or, The Phenomena of Optics Explained According to Mechanical Sciences</span> (1834) he supposed that light was caused by high-speed ether particles and, as one of the last supporters of the projectile theory of light, sided with David Brewster, Henry Brougham, Richard Potter, and John Barton against G. B. Airy, William Whewell, and John Herschel. However, Exley's explanations of optical phenomena met with vehement opposition. At the 1836 meeting of the British Association in Bristol he suffered an energetic assault by John Dalton, who ridiculed his explanation of the aurora borealis.<br>
<br>Exley was married to Hannah Clarke, but the date of their marriage is not known. A son, John Thomas, was admitted to St John's College, Cambridge, in 1834. Towards the end of his life Exley toiled hard to reconcile the latest scientific work with scripture. In 1844, the same year that Robert Chambers's <span class="italic">Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation</span> was published, Exley brought out his <span class="italic">Commentary on Genesis</span>, which attempted to elucidate the Mosaic account of creation and the tale of the deluge in terms of modern concepts such as the electric fluid and caloric. Returning to Hebrew texts, and utilizing his own conception of the ether, microgen, and recent geological facts, Exley developed astonishing explanations for the chaos, the creation of the animal kingdom, the flood, the Holy Ghost and God's superintending providence. Despite the remarkable nature of the narrative, little attention was paid to the text. Exley died at his home in Cotham Park Road, Bristol, on 17 February 1855 in relative obscurity.<br>
