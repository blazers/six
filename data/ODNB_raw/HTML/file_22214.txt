<span class="headword">Pickersgill,  Frederick Richard</span>  (1820&#150;1900), <span class="occ">history painter</span>, was born in London, probably at 6 Northampton Street, on 25 September 1820, the son of Richard Pickersgill (<i>fl</i>. 1818&#150;1853), a naval officer and amateur marine and landscape painter, and his wife, Anne Witherington, the sister of the painter <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29806/', "William Frederick Witherington (1785&#150;1865)")</script>. His paternal uncle was the portrait painter <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22216/', "Henry William Pickersgill (1782&#150;1875)")</script>, and his cousin <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22215/', "Henry Hall Pickersgill (1812&#150;1861)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22216/', "Pickersgill, Henry William")</script>] was also a painter. Pickersgill received his first instruction as an artist from his uncle W. F. Witherington. He entered the Royal Academy Schools on 21 April 1840, having already exhibited a watercolour, <span class="italic">The Brazen Age</span>, at the Royal Academy in 1839. In 1843 he achieved early success, winning a prize of &pound;100 for his cartoon <span class="italic">The Death of King Lear</span> in the competition to decorate the new houses of parliament. His entry the following year, <span class="italic">Sir Calepine Rescuing Serena</span>, was not successful, and Pickersgill acknowledged that he had not mastered the technique of working in fresco. However, in 1847 he won a first-class prize of &pound;500 for <span class="italic">The Burial of Harold</span>, and the work was purchased for the houses of parliament for an equal amount. Pickersgill was elected an associate of the Royal Academy on 1 November 1847 at the early age of twenty-seven. Earlier that year, on 5 August, Pickersgill married Mary Noorouz Elizabeth (1824/5&#150;1886), the eldest daughter of James Hook, a judge in the mixed commission courts of Sierra Leone, and his wife, Eliza Frances Clarke; Mary was the sister of the landscape and history painter <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/33968/', "J. C. Hook (1819&#150;1907)")</script>. The couple had one son.<br>
<br>Pickersgill exhibited fifty works at the Royal Academy between 1839 and 1875, of which the majority were subjects taken from literature, especially authors such as Spenser and Milton, religious subjects, and scenes from ancient history and the Italian Renaissance period. His early work included restrained compositions such as <span class="italic">Amoret, Aemylia, and Prince Arthur in the Cottage of Sclaunder</span> (exh. RA, 1845; Tate collection); typically they were distinguished by &#145;careful and accurate drawing (we should think he had studied Flaxman with some attention,) and by judicious colouring, although in a few of his works this latter quality would be improved by more power&#146;  (<span class="italic">Art Journal</span>, 12, 1850). The influence of William Etty is also apparent in works such as <span class="italic">Samson Betrayed</span> (exh. RA, 1850; Manchester City Galleries) and <span class="italic">The Pearl Boat</span> (1850s; ex Sothebys, 14 November 1990), in which Pickersgill delighted in contrasting fair-skinned female nudes with muscular dark-skinned male forms. Critics felt that &#145;his productions exhibit brilliant and sparkling colours, good though rather academic drawing&#146;, but that his figures &#145;were certainly less vigorously conceived&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Athenaeum</span>, 29 Dec 1900). In 1854 his only exhibit at the Royal Academy, <span class="italic">The Death of Francesco Foscari, Doge of Venice</span> (1854; Royal Collection), was bought by Prince Albert as a birthday present for Queen Victoria. The composition of this work is skilfully constructed, but the drama of the scene is lessened by the prominence of beautifully dressed women. Contemporary critics, while being impressed by the tasteful design, thought that &#145;his personages want life-blood &hellip; They are costume figures&#151;drapery holders&#151;poetical vacuities, and one has no firm belief in their vitality or <i>bona fide</i> existence&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Athenaeum</span>, 19 May 1855).<br>
<br>Pickersgill seems to have experimented with photography, as an albumen print, <span class="italic">Sunshine and Shade</span>, was included in <span class="italic">The Sunbeam: a Book of Photographs from Nature</span> (1859), which was compiled and edited by Philip Henry Delamotte. Pickersgill's photograph shows two figures sitting by an overgrown path and captures in fine detail the play of sunshine and shade across the scene. He himself sat for the photographer David Wilkie Wynfield; his striking appearance, with his narrow face, long thin nose, and arched eyebrows, is clearly seen behind the fancy dress typical of Wynfield's photography. Pickersgill also drew illustrations to various publications, among them P. Massinger's <span class="italic">Virgin Martyr</span> (1844), Milton's <span class="italic">Comus</span> (1858), and <span class="italic">The Poetical Works of E. A. Poe</span> (1858). Pickersgill's designs for <span class="italic">The Life of Christ</span> were engraved on wood by Dalziel in 1850, and he also contributed to Dalziel's <span class="italic">Bible Gallery</span> (1881). His illustrative work was influenced by John Flaxman with its emphasis on line, but the effect was softened by the use of shading to give his figures more volume. Examples of his excellent draughtsmanship may be seen in a collection of drawings at the Barber Institute, Birmingham.<br>
<br>On 14 June 1857 Pickersgill was elected a full Royal Academician. His diploma piece, <span class="italic">The Bribe</span> (1857; RA), is typical of his work during the 1850s and 1860s, in its precise draughtsmanship, its minute attention to detail, and the evident enjoyment of contrasts&#151;in this case a young woman with an old man and a velvet dress with a suit of armour. Perhaps in response to criticism that some of his literary subjects had too little &#145;poetical fancy and too much of daily association&#146;  (<span class="italic">Art Journal</span>, 17, 1855, 234), Pickersgill expanded his range of subjects in the 1860s to include modern life scenes. <span class="italic">The Path where the Brown Leaves are Spread</span> (1862; ex Phillips, 20 June 1995) depicts a mother and child in a wood which is clearly influenced by the Pre-Raphaelites in its careful delineation of every leaf and bramble. He also exhibited in 1869 <span class="italic">A Honiton Lace Manufactory</span> (ex Christies, 6 November 1995), in which three women are shown lace-making out of doors.<br>
<br>Pickersgill was commissioned in 1871, for a fee of &pound;1000, to design a lunette fresco for the Victoria and Albert Museum on the subject <span class="italic">The Industrial Arts in Time of Peace</span>. He executed a full-size oil (V&amp;A), but the fresco was never executed as a design by Frederick Leighton was later preferred. Pickersgill was elected keeper of the Royal Academy Schools on 10 July 1873 and served in this post until 3 August 1887. He presided over the schools during a period of change, and on his resignation it was noted that &#145;gratitude [was] due to him for his conscientious devotion to the duties of his office as Keeper, which have become greatly more responsible and onerous during the development of the Academic schools and curriculum during the last two decades&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Portfolio</span>).<br>
<br>Pickersgill's wife died on 21 June 1886, and on 7 February 1888 he retired from the Royal Academy. He spent the remainder of his life at The Towers, Yarmouth, on the Isle of Wight, where he died on 20 December 1900 after suffering a long and painful illness. He was buried on 24 December in Yarmouth. His obituarist remembered him as an &#145;excellent painter, amiable gentleman and good friend&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Athenaeum</span>, 29 Dec 1900).<br>
