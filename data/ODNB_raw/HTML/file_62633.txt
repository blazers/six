<span class="headword">Austen,  William</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1449&#150;1454), <span class="occ">metal-founder</span>, is known only for his work on the tomb of Richard Beauchamp, earl of Warwick (<i>d</i>. 1439), in the latter's chantry in St Mary's Church, Warwick. Documentary evidence for Austen's involvement survives in the form of seventeenth-century transcripts, and eighteenth- and nineteenth-century copies of transcripts, taken from medieval contracts which appear to have been incomplete when the transcripts were made, and which are now lost.<br>
<br>Described as a citizen of London, Austen is mentioned in five separate contracts for the Beauchamp tomb. His main tasks, assigned between 1449 and 1454, were threefold: first, to cast and make perfectly, according to wooden patterns supplied by the executors, an image of fine latten (an alloy of copper and zinc), of a man armed, carrying a sword and dagger, with a helm and crest under his head and a muzzled bear and a griffon at his feet, and to bring the image to Warwick and install it on the tomb. Second, he was commissioned to make, again using wooden patterns, fourteen images of lords and ladies, dressed as weepers, and eighteen images of angels, which were to stand in housings provided on the monument. Third, he was to collaborate with John Essex, marbler, and Thomas Stevens, coppersmith, in making the base plate on which the effigy would rest, and which would carry the inscription, and the hearse to go over it. He was also involved in preparing the images of angels and weepers for gilding, though all the other preparations for gilding, and the burnishing, polishing, and gilding itself, were done by <a name="cosubject_62633"></a><span class="headword">Bartholomew Lambespringe</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1449&#150;1454), a Dutchman.<br>
<br>There has been much debate about the extent to which Austen made an artistic contribution to the project and to what extent he was following instructions laid down by the executors or another of the artisans involved. Most scholars have assumed that he was an artisan with no particular artistic pre-eminence. Indeed, what emerges most strongly from an examination of the documents, and of the monument itself, is that the whole enterprise was collaborative, and the roles of all the artisans were interdependent to the extent that it is difficult to attribute the design of the monument, or even any aspect of the finished work, to any individual.<br>
<br>Thus one of the first of the contracts, requesting Bartholomew Lambespringe, a <span class="occ">goldsmith</span> of London, to hone and polish the &#145;image of latten of a man armed that is in making&#146;  (Dugdale, 354) in preparation for its gilding, was drawn up in 1449 between him and John Massingham, woodcarver, Roger Webbe, barber surgeon, and William Austen, founder, giving the impression that Lambespringe was answerable for his work to the three others, who were engaged jointly in the making of the effigy. Perhaps the barber surgeon was employed to ensure anatomical accuracy, evident in the extreme sensitivity of modelling of such details as the veins upstanding on the hands. As for John Massingham's contribution, it is possible that the wooden forms were used to underpin the general shape over which the wax would have been modelled.<br>
<br>While the enterprise was collaborative, Austen's role was undoubtedly a highly significant one. He was not just required to cast an effigy and figures from forms supplied, but also to &#145;cast, work and perfectly to make&#146; images whose attributes were listed in some detail, as if he was responsible for ensuring that those attributes and details were present  (Dugdale, 354). There can be no doubt of his immense skill as a founder. Modern technical analysis has shown that the metal is indeed as requested, of the highest quality, a complex soft alloy with a very high copper content. The effigy was cast in seven pieces, and as perfectly modelled and finished on the back as on the front. Austen has to be accorded a pre-eminent role among all the artisans involved, as the maker of the figures in their final form. But, just as he was probably not responsible for their design, so he was not entirely responsible for their final appearance. For Bartholomew Lambespringe honed and burnished and polished and gilded the whole monument, and was also contracted to make the heads and hands and all the unclothed parts of the weepers and angels after Austen had cast the figures and they had both prepared them for gilding. Whether this means that Austen's faces and hands were unsatisfactory and had to be replaced, or whether he had not made them in the first place, is not clear. It may also be indicative of their relative status that Lambespringe was paid more than twice as much as Austen for his labour.<br>
