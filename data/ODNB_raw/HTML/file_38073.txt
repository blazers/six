<span class="headword">Tozer,  Henry Fanshawe</span>  (1829&#150;1916), <span class="occ">geographer and classical scholar</span>, was born in Plymouth on 18 May 1829, the only son (there was also a daughter) of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27648/', "Captain Aaron Tozer RN")</script> and his wife, Mary Hutton of Lincoln. He entered Winchester College in 1842, and University College, Oxford, in 1847, and won a scholarship to Exeter College, Oxford, in 1848; he obtained a second class in <i>literae humaniores</i> in 1850. He was elected a fellow of Exeter in 1850, and was ordained deacon in 1852 and priest in 1853. He was classical tutor at Exeter College and remained a fellow (from 1893 honorary fellow) until his death, except for the period from 1868, when he vacated his fellowship on his marriage, until 1882, when the passing of the statutes of the second university commissioners enabled him to be readmitted as fellow. Tozer married Augusta Henrietta, daughter of Hans David Christopher Satow, a Swedish merchant who settled in London in 1825, and his wife, Margaret Mason, an Englishwoman.<br>
<br>A versatile and hardy traveller, Tozer made his first journey to Italy and Sicily, the prelude to an extended and detailed tour of Greece as far as Thessaly. Thereafter he made regular journeys in Greece and Turkey, some of which formed the subject of two of his major travel books, <span class="italic">Researches in the Highlands of Turkey</span> (2 vols., 1869) and <span class="italic">Turkish Armenia and Eastern Asia Minor</span> (1881). The first of these described two arduous journeys from Constantinople to Salonika (taking in Mount Athos, which he climbed) across the Scardus and Bertiscus ranges, then further north into Montenegro and across the Mirdita country of central Albania; the second described a journey from Samsun across the Anatolian plateau, through Cappadocia, past Lake Van to Erzurum, and so back to Trebizond, the last stretch roughly along the route taken by Xenophon and the Ten Thousand. On these travels Tozer was usually accompanied by T. M. Crowder, bursar of Corpus Christi College, Oxford, whose sixteen volumes of closely written journals, recording these and many other travels, are preserved in the college library.<br>
<br>Tozer travelled after the pioneer journeys of W. M. Leake in Greece and Macedonia and of W. J. Hamilton in Asia Minor had opened up these countries to archaeologists, and his main interest was not in the discovery of archaeological material but in physical and human geography. He was thus a true follower of Strabo, the author to the dissemination of whose work he contributed most. He was a keen observer of the landscape (including the flora&#151;he was a skilled botanist) and of the people who lived in it and the regimes under which they lived. In Greece especially he absorbed much local folklore, and all his life he continued to write articles on modern Greek legends and folk-songs and allied topics. He was also deeply interested in Byzantine history and literature, and one of his lasting achievements was to re-edit George Finlay's seven-volume <span class="italic">History of Greece</span> (1877). This was a task of considerable complexity and Tozer's edition became the standard one. The geographers were, however, never far from his thoughts, and in 1893 he produced his admirable <span class="italic">Selections from Strabo</span> (which remained the most sympathetic introduction to Strabo); this was followed in 1897 by <span class="italic">A History of Ancient Geography</span>&#151;one of the best, if not the best, handbook on both ancient geography and geographical writers, in Greek and Latin, to the end of the western empire. This is in a way a companion volume, in its emphasis on the geographers, to his much earlier book, <span class="italic">Lectures on the Geography of Greece</span> (1873), based on lectures given in Oxford in 1872. His later travels in the Aegean formed the subject of his delightful <span class="italic">Islands of the Aegean</span> (1890). In addition to this intensive work on his special subjects, and the work, such as the study of modern Greek, that arose naturally out of his other activities, Tozer had an abiding love for Dante, and published both an elegant three-volume commentary on the <span class="italic">Divina commedia</span> (1901) and a prose translation of the poem (1904).<br>
<br>Tozer's writings are invariably simple in style and straightforward in substance, but he had a direct appreciation of landscape, which carries its own charm, and, like his friend Edward Lear, a sharp eye for human foibles and vanities as revealed by the activities of local officials in the Turkish provinces. His main contribution to the understanding of ancient geography lay in his personal knowledge of the topography over a wide area, combined with a natural appreciation of the writings of the geographers themselves, especially Strabo. His eminence in his field was signalled by his inclusion in the original list of fellows of the British Academy in 1903; but in the Oxford of the second half of the nineteenth century, parochial, preoccupied with spiritual and philosophical problems, the Oxford of Jowett, Pater, and Pattison, his interests and experiences must have set him apart. He died childless on 2 June 1916 at his home, 18 Norham Gardens, Oxford. One of his executors was his wife's brother, Sir Ernest Mason Satow.<br>
<br>Tozer is chiefly remembered as a pioneer of the establishment of geography in British universities, which lagged far behind their continental counterparts in this respect. His particular research and lectures proved, like contemporary work in biblical geography, to be something of an academic cul-de-sac. They were regarded as peripheral to classical studies, and geography ultimately drew more on the natural sciences and contemporary exploration which dominated German advances in the subject. None the less, Tozer's work has been consulted by those (admittedly few) geographers interested in the field (see  (Coones, 1986)), and his <span class="italic">Ancient Geography</span> was reprinted as late as 1974. It is his staunch belief in the need for history to have a firm base in geography and in the inherent value of geography that remain of most interest. He strongly advocated &#145;the intelligent study of historical geography&#146;  (his dedication to A. P. Stanley in the <span class="italic">Geography of Greece</span>), and in the 1880s wrote to John Scott Keltie to say &#145;it would be a good thing to have a professor or reader in geography [at Oxford] as a definite recognition of the subject and as providing the university with a man who should represent the branch of knowledge&#146;, though he recognized that &#145;the studies of undergraduates are almost entirely regulated by the examination&#146; so that without syllabus reform geography would continue to be &#145;crowded out&#146;  (Baker, 124&#150;5). In 1887, shortly after Tozer wrote, Halford Mackinder became the first reader in geography at Oxford, though the establishment of geography as an honour school was to take longer. This interest in broadening the university curriculum was typical of Tozer, who, unlike many contemporary fellows, was active in learned societies such as the Society for Promoting Hellenic Studies, was a corresponding member of Near-Eastern learned societies, and, as curator of the Taylor Institution in 1869&#150;93, was active in broadening the scope of scholarly enquiry at Oxford.<br>
