<span class="headword">Coote,  Charles</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1760, <em>d.</em> 1835), <span class="occ">historian and biographer</span>, was the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/66073/', "John Coote (bap. 1733, d. 1808)")</script>, a bookseller of Paternoster Row, London, and the author of several dramatic pieces, who died in 1808; his mother was Jane, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Weaver (<i>d</i>. in or before 1808). He went to St Paul's School in 1773, matriculated from Pembroke College, Oxford, in 1778, took the degree of BA in 1782, and on 30 December 1784 was elected a scholar on the Benet or Ossulstone foundation in that society. He proceeded MA in 1785, BCL by commutation on 10 July 1789, DCL on 14 July following, and was admitted a member of the College of Advocates on 3 November in the same year. He devoted his attention to literature rather than to law, and was for some time editor of the <span class="italic">Critical Review</span>. To adopt his own words, &#145;even after his enrolment among the associated advocates he for some years did not dwell within the circuit of the college, and when he became a resident member he rather patiently awaited employment than eagerly sought it&#146;  (Coote, 133). Coote was<blockquote>of a retired disposition, with much of that eccentricity and indolence which often accompany literary merit, he passed through his profession with credit and respect, but without that emolument which was perhaps due to his abilities, had they been much exerted. (<span class="italic">GM</span>)</blockquote>Not being an able speaker he was rarely employed as an advocate, but he frequently acted as a judge in the court of delegates.Coote's first work was <span class="italic">Elements of the Grammar of the English Language</span> (1788; 2nd edn, 1806), a work of some interest; he then wrote <span class="italic">The History of England from the Earliest Dawn of Record to the Peace of 1783</span> (9 vols., 1791&#150;8), to which he added in 1803 another volume, bringing down the history to the peace of Amiens in 1802. He then published two classical histories (1794 and 1796), followed by a <span class="italic">History of the union of the kingdoms of Great Britain and Ireland: with an introductory survey of Hibernian affairs traced from the times of Celtic colonisation</span> (1802), which sold poorly. His most distinctive work was <span class="italic">Sketches of the lives and characters of eminent English civilians, with an historical introduction relative to the College of Advocates</span> (1804), in which he included himself. He added six volumes to Mosheim's ecclesiastical history in 1811, and published a history of ancient Europe (3 vols., 1815), and various other updatings of other authors' historical works.<br>
<br>Coote had been married, but was for many years a widower. He died at Islington, London, on 19 November 1835, survived by two daughters and three sons, one of whom was the historian <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6245/', "Henry Charles Coote")</script>.<br>
