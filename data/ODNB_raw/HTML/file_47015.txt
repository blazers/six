<span class="headword">Gabriel,  (John) Beresford Stuart</span>  (1888&#150;1979), <span class="occ">machine tool manufacturer</span>, was born on 1 August 1888 at Twickenham, Middlesex, the elder son of the three children of John William Wright Gabriel and his wife, Eleanor, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Broad. That year J. W. W. Gabriel sold his interest in the family drug manufacturing company of Gabriel and Troke and joined the partnership of Charles Churchill (1837&#150;1916) and his eldest son, Charles Henry Churchill, formed in 1865 to import the new machine tools of the American system of interchangeable manufacture, which led to mass production. In 1889 the firm was registered as Charles Churchill Ltd, a private company with a capital of &pound;5500.<br>
<br>Beresford Gabriel, as he was known, went to Mill Hill School (1902&#150;7) and then read mechanical and applied sciences at Emmanuel College, Cambridge, graduating with a second class degree in 1910. He then gained practical engineering experience, successively in the works of R. W. Munro &amp; Co. and the Churchill Machine Tool Company, and afterwards as overseas representative for the Cincinnati Milling Machine Company. During the First World War he served with the Royal Engineers, working on searchlight defences for London and reaching the rank of captain.<br>
<br>Gabriel returned to the Churchill family firm as assistant managing director in 1920. Demand for machine tools, traditionally cyclical and derived from the machine making industries, was dented first by the post-war sale of surplus government machine tools and then by the slump of 1921&#150;2. Moreover, during the war years Charles Churchill and two of his sons had died. Gabriel, appointed a joint managing director in 1923, reduced the network of warehouses to those in Birmingham, Glasgow, Manchester, Newcastle, and London (the location of headquarters). Manufacturing was sited in two plants, one near Salford, which made grinding machines under a subsidiary company, the Churchill Machine Tool Company. The other was a third share (purchased in 1919) in C. Redman &amp; Sons' Pioneer ironworks at Halifax, a small firm which made a variety of planers and lathes.<br>
<br>Some recovery came in the late 1920s but in 1931 the national economic crisis hit the company with a peculiar severity, cutting demand and introducing 20 per cent duties on imported machine tools. Gabriel, sole managing director from 1932, responded by securing manufacturing licences from a number of Churchills' American suppliers. Secondly he negotiated the formation in 1933 of an English subsidiary of the Cincinnati Milling Machine Company, with himself as chairman. At this point boardroom divisions split the firm between a sales agency and a manufacturing business (named the Churchill Machine Tool Company). Gabriel stayed with the former, Charles Churchill &amp; Co., as managing director, under F. P. Burnage, son-in-law of Charles Churchill, chairman. In December 1934 Gabriel restored the firm's manufacturing base by purchasing complete control of the Redman firm, renamed the Churchill-Redman Company, which grew to a turnover of &pound;141,773, with pre-tax profits of &pound;23,415, and 300 employees in 1939. The basic technology still originated in the USA. From the Jones and Lamson Company of Springfield, Vermont, a manufacturing licence was secured in 1937 for the Fay lathe, an automatic lathe noted for its versatility, suitability for mass production, and relative ease of operation.<br>
<br>Still, neither Churchill-Redman, nor the British machine tool industry as a whole, met effective demand. This grew with the expansion of the motor industry in the early 1930s. The Ford Motor Company placed the first of its many orders with Churchill-Redman in 1931 and Gabriel set up a new machine tool headquarters at South Yardley in the midlands' motor manufacturing region in 1938. Demand for machine tools was augmented by rearmament after 1936 and then by the outbreak of war in 1939.<br>
<br>For much of the Second World War Gabriel was controller of machine tools, in charge of the Ministry of Supply's programme for mobilizing the industry which had to meet 83 per cent of home demand, the rest coming from the USA under &#145;cash and carry&#146; and lend-lease arrangements. Targets were reached in November 1943. Gabriel returned to Churchills in 1944.<br>
<br>When peacetime released pent-up demand for machine tools, Gabriel expanded the firm's output. In 1945 he visited the USA to negotiate arrangements under which Churchills would manufacture hobbing and gear shaving machines, required by the motor industry particularly. Capacity was then increased by purchasing the Longfield foundry in Halifax and by leasing from Vickers Armstrong part of the extensive Admiralty works in Scotswood Road, Newcastle upon Tyne. At Halifax, Gabriel launched the search for technical improvements in machine tool performance. Higher cutting speeds and faster times in sizing work pieces, setting up work, and transferring it to another machine were the objectives which led the firm's engineers to develop a new heavy-duty copying lathe, forerunner of the CR P5 range of fully automatic, multi-tool and profiling lathes. A lathe with an automatic feed and delivery heralded an automatic machine tool production line.<br>
<br>The growth in machine tool demand, stemming from the expansion in motor car manufacture, was reflected in Churchill-Redman turnover, which rose from just over &pound;200,000 in 1946 to over &pound;1 million in 1955. To meet demand, new capacity and new products were sought in the mid-1950s. The Scotswood operation moved to a purpose-built factory at Blaydon on the other side of the Tyne in 1957. This plant made machine tools for the motor industry, including the Vertimax vertical spindle production lathe, invented in the war by James Anderson, a Glasgow garage proprietor.<br>
<br>Anderson's company was one of a number of innovative firms in the industry which Gabriel brought into the Churchill Group in the 1950s and early 1960s. Gabriel preferred to run these acquisitions as separate operating companies, to which he added a selling firm, Charles H. Churchill Ltd, in 1962. The firm's headquarters were moved in 1950 from London to Birmingham, though he kept his chairman's office at Caxton Street, London, until 1960. The parent company's capital was increased to &pound;1.26 million in 1955. A decade later the Churchill Group was one of the largest in the machine tool industry, with group sales of &pound;14 million and employing 2000. However, rising German and Japanese competition, and the concomitant needs to increase investment and to cut labour costs drastically, persuaded him to recommend a take-over of the Churchill Group by Tube Investments. When this happened in 1966 Gabriel retired.<br>
<br>Gabriel belonged to both the Institution of Mechanical Engineers and the Institution of Civil Engineers. In 1949&#150;51 he served as president of the Machine Tool Trades Association. Early in life he enjoyed rowing and later took up golf. Raised as a Methodist, he later attended the Church of England, but could not always agree with Anglican doctrines. Politically, he regarded socialism as a false paradise. He married in 1914 Elfrida Ianthe Mary Griffith Clarke, daughter of Edward Clarke, a merchant. They had three sons, the youngest of whom, Ralph, read engineering at Cambridge, served in the REME in the Second World War, and afterwards joined the management of the Churchill Group. Gabriel died at his home, Robin Hill, Forrest Road, Kenilworth, on 7 July 1979.<br>
