<span class="headword">Evans,  George</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1631, <em>d.</em> 1702), <span class="occ">antiquary</span>, was baptized in the abbey church, St Albans, on 19 February 1631, the son of George and Mary Evans. He was probably educated at the free school and thereafter was admitted to Jesus College, Cambridge, graduating BA in 1650 and proceeding MA in 1653. He was a fellow from 1650 to 1658, and was awarded a doctorate in divinity in 1665. By this time he had been admitted a canon of Windsor (26 July 1660) and on 6 May 1663 he was given a lease of the rectory and parsonage of St Benet Fink, London, by the college of canons. He was also, on 26 March 1667, instituted rector of the parish of Hitcham, Buckinghamshire, where he seems to have spent some time.<br>
<br>Evans and his wife, Rebecca, had five sons and four daughters; a son and a daughter were buried in the churchyard at Hitcham in 1685 and 1690 and his daughter Mary married there in 1697. He seems to have been an affectionate father, asking to be buried &#145;as near my dear children &hellip; as conveniently can be&#146; and &#145;with as much privacy and little expense as well may be&#146;  (TNA: PRO, PROB 11/454, sig. 45). He also had a lively interest in the past and present of St George's Chapel, Windsor; two volumes of his notes of deeds and memoranda of events concerning the college survive in the chapter library. Some of his work was published in <span class="italic">The Antiquities of Berkshire</span> (1719) by his friend Elias Ashmole, with whom he corresponded over a number of years. Evans died at Hitcham on 2 March 1702 and was buried in the churchyard there four days later; his wife survived him. In addition to the advowson of Hitcham, he owned land and property in Buckinghamshire, Huntingdon, and Cambridgeshire, and had lent about &pound;170 to the crown to be repaid as annuities from the excise. Among his bequests were gifts to the free school of St Albans, the college of Windsor, and the poor of St Albans and New Windsor.<br>
