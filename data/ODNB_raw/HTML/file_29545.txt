<span class="headword">Williams,  Rowland</span>  (1817&#150;1870), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, was born at Halkyn, Flintshire, on 16 August 1817. His father, Rowland Williams (<i>d</i>. 1854), canon of St Asaph, held successively the livings of Halkyn, Meifod, and Ysgeifiog. One of the most able Welsh clergymen of his age, he married Jane Wynne, daughter of the Revd Hugh Wynne Jones of Tre Iorwerth, Anglesey, who was prebendary of Penmynydd. Rowland was their second surviving son. Educated initially by his father, he went to Eton College as king's scholar in 1828 and became Newcastle medallist in 1835. A year later, he went up to King's College, Cambridge, and gained Battie's university scholarship in his first year. Elected to a fellowship at King's in 1839, he travelled in Europe and taught briefly at Eton before returning to Cambridge in 1842. He was ordained deacon in 1842 and priest in 1843 by John Kaye, bishop of Lincoln, then spent the next eight years as classical tutor at King's. He proceeded MA in 1844 and BD in 1851. He also developed an interest in oriental studies, carrying off a prize in 1848 offered to the university by John Muir for a dissertation which compared Christianity and Hinduism. An extended version of his submission was published in 1856.<br>
<br>During his Cambridge years, Williams remained very conscious of his Welshness. He was in active contact with London Welsh circles, spoke regularly at St David's day dinners, and sported a leek on appropriate occasions. Under the pseudonym Goronva Camlan, he published verse with the aim of rescuing some of the heritage of Wales from the &#145;threatening train of steam engines and schoolmasters&#146;, as he put it. He campaigned successfully, with the earl of Powis and others, against the mooted merger of the sees of Bangor and St Asaph. He played a leading part in the awarding of the Powis scholarships (held at Oxford and Cambridge), which were established to commemorate this triumph. Articles in the <span class="italic">Quarterly Review</span> in 1849 and 1850 on Methodism in Wales and on the church and education in Wales confirmed his continuing interest in Welsh questions. It was for this reason that the invitation to become vice-principal and professor of Hebrew at St David's College at Lampeter in 1850 was attractive: it would enable him to combine his own academic work with the improvement of the educational standards of Welshmen who intended ordination. It was even possible that, in due time, though a Welshman, he would become a bishop.<br>
<br>The college was founded in 1822 and took in its first students in 1827. From the outset, however, it was handicapped by an inadequate financial base, and also by the disposition of prominent local clergy to dispute among themselves too vigorously. There were also allegations, not without foundation, of administrative incompetence. Williams had no difficulty in settling into prevailing conventions of controversy&#151;it was later said that his pen dripped with vitriol the moment he began to write. His contentious defence of English as the medium of instruction in the college led to the grave accusation from some quarters that his heart was &#145;Anglo-Welsh&#146;. Lady Llanover, one of his prominent critics, explained that such a heart was a much worse thing than a Saxon one because it was &#145;unnatural&#146;. Williams hit back, publishing a defence of the broad type of education offered at Lampeter and initiating financial and administrative changes which helped to give the college a more secure future. A charter in 1852 gave it the power to grant the degree of BD.<br>
<br>In December 1854, as select preacher in Cambridge, Williams delivered a course of sermons whose general contention was that everything doubtful or transparently erroneous in the <span class="roman">Bible</span> could be surrendered with little or no detriment to the essentials of the Christian faith. The evolution of his ideas up to this point owed much to Julius Hare and Coleridge and, in Germany, to F. D. Schleiermacher (Williams read German). <span class="italic">Rational Godliness</span>, the published title of these and other sermons, did not altogether commend itself in west Wales. In 1855 the bishop of Llandaff forced Williams to resign his post as examining chaplain in his diocese. Williams tried to defend himself in his <span class="italic">Lampeter Theology</span>, published in the following year, but that volume only made matters worse locally, although a petition to the bishop of St David's that Williams should be removed did not succeed. Years of controversy followed. They were intensified by the publication, also in 1856, of Williams's <span class="italic">Christianity and Hinduism</span>. This substantial work took the form of a dialogue between a Buddhist, a Hindu, a Vedantist, a German naturalist, and two English clergymen on the respective merits of Indian and other religions. On the strength of these publications, Williams was awarded his DD in 1857.<br>
<br>Meanwhile, an acrimonious debate was launched in Wales involving Connop Thirlwall, bishop of St David's, and Alfred Ollivant, bishop of Llandaff, both Welsh-speaking Englishmen and graduates of Cambridge, who also had personal connections with St David's College as visitor and sub-visitor respectively. In the debate about orthodoxy and heterodoxy that ensued, opportunity was taken to revive old issues concerning the administration, structure, and mission of the college. Ollivant concluded that Williams's teaching, while it might be acceptable in Cambridge, was not suitable for the &#145;raw and undisciplined youths&#146; who apparently constituted the chief body of Lampeter students&#151;Ollivant was himself a former vice-principal. Williams in turn found that observation to be an insult to the genius of the Welsh people. Ollivant subsequently found Williams's language sneering and unjust. Conscious of his own past reputation as a &#145;liberal&#146;, Thirlwall prevaricated obscurely and irritated all parties.<br>
<br>It was in these circumstances that in 1858 Williams gratefully accepted the King's College living of Broad Chalke with Bower Chalke and Alvedistone, near Salisbury, though initially he limited its demands on his time to the vacations from Lampeter. In 1859 he married Ellen, daughter of Charles Cotesworth RN, a Liverpool merchant. They had no children. After Williams's death, she wrote his biography and returned to her original home in Liverpool.<br>
<br>In 1862 Williams gave up his position in Lampeter completely. He thought it appropriate to preach his farewell sermon in the college on the text &#145;princes have persecuted me without cause&#146;. In the meantime, he had become involved in further controversy as a result of his review of Baron von Bunsen's <span class="italic">Biblical Researches</span>; the review appeared in the celebrated volume <span class="italic">Essays and Reviews</span> in February 1860. This time the public argument extended beyond what Williams had dispiritedly come to regard as &#145;an unsympathizing corner of a barbarous land&#146;. De Bunsen, diplomat and biblical scholar, was a personal friend with whom he had stayed in Heidelberg. The tone of Williams's contribution no doubt reflected what he had come to refer to as his &#145;Lampeter purgatory&#146;. W. K. Hamilton, bishop of Salisbury, took proceedings against Williams for heterodoxy before the court of arches of the province of Canterbury. He was defended by J. P. Deane and J. F. Stephen in a hearing which lasted ten days in December 1861 and January 1862. The subsequent judgment sustained three charges relating to inspiration, propitiation, and justification, but dismissed the others. In retrospect, however, the liberty that the judgment allowed seems more significant than these three particular condemnations. Williams himself wrote:<blockquote>Whatever freedom I have claimed is judicially conceded as permissible by the Church of England. If we gain nothing more, I feel this day that I have not lived in vain; my Master has done a work by me which will abide.</blockquote>Williams and H. B. Wilson (another of the essayists proceeded against in the court of arches) appealed in person on 19 June 1863 before the judicial committee of the privy council. In February 1864 the court reversed such parts of the judgment as were unfavourable to Williams. The essence of the position of the seven essayists, who wrote independently, was that the <span class="roman">Bible</span> should be read with freedom like any other book. Condemnation of the reversal followed in the lower house of convocation, and Pusey made such contribution as he could to the reversal of what he took to be the tide of scepticism by lecturing on the book of <span class="roman">Daniel</span>.<br>
<br>Williams spent his remaining years largely at Broad Chalke where he was an active clergyman, rebuilding one of his churches, providing allotments out of his glebe, and starting a library for local inhabitants. He published sermons and issued a translation, with commentary, of the Hebrew prophets, though he did not live to complete this work. It was an achievement which excited the admiration of the German scholar Heinrich Ewald, who visited him in Wiltshire. At about this time Williams by chance shared a railway compartment with Pusey, but the two men did not fraternize. Williams was never strong and late in life had a disconcerting tendency to fall off his horse and to stumble when lighting a cigar. He died on 18 January 1870 at his home, the Broad Chalke vicarage, and was buried in the churchyard there. Three years later painted glass in the west window of his church was unveiled in his memory. Pupils and friends caused memorials to be put up in the college chapels at St David's, Lampeter, and King's College, Cambridge.<br>
<br>The portrait by John Robertson, now at Lampeter, reveals a man with a large head and high-domed forehead. His features were held in the nineteenth century to be of the &#145;Celtic type&#146;. In his study of Williams, Jones concludes that the portrait reveals Williams as a man of pride and passion, whose egotism was expressed alternately in melancholy and elation&#151;a man of a certain arrogance who had an intensely personal approach to everything he attempted. It was, however, the passion for freedom that he brought both to <span class="roman">Old Testament</span> scholarship and to the study of religions which makes Williams a figure of abiding significance in nineteenth-century British theological study, even though his specific views and theories may not entitle him to a place in the first rank of biblical scholars.<br>
<br>Despite his final decade in Wiltshire, thoughts of Wales were never far away and Williams died in the knowledge that the proofs of his final poem, significantly entitled &#145;Owen Glendower&#146;, were to hand. The intensity with which he fought for the freedom to conduct unfettered biblical research may reflect the experience in this era of a young Welshman from a rural background thrown into a very different social and cultural environment and anxious to prove, before there was a university in Wales, that he could match anything more assured Englishmen could achieve. It was in Wales that he wished to be primarily remembered and his library was, after his death, housed in Swansea. It is fitting that the major part of that collection, revealing his wide scholarly interests, was later transferred to the National Library of Wales in Aberystwyth. With all his limitations, he was the most important Welsh scholar in biblical studies and the comparative study of religion in the nineteenth century.<br>
