<span class="headword">Raffald <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Whitaker]</span>,  Elizabeth</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1733, <em>d.</em> 1781), <span class="occ">cook and writer on cookery</span>, was born at Doncaster and baptized there on 8 July 1733. She was one of at least three daughters born to Joshua Whitaker, a man of some property in the town which the daughters inherited. After receiving a fair education, she passed about fifteen years (1748&#150;63) in service, rising to become housekeeper at Arley Hall, Cheshire, to Lady Elizabeth Warburton. She married her employer's gardener, John Raffald, on 3 March 1763, at Great Budworth, Cheshire. They had at least nine children, all daughters; only three reportedly survived into adulthood. The daughters attracted much attention walking out, each in a clean white frock and each with her own nurse behind. The youngest, Anna, passed on this and many other anecdotes about her mother. Several sons of Mrs Raffald's sister Middleward lived with the Raffalds &#145;to be company for her Manchester sisters lasses&#146; and to be apprenticed at the appropriate time  (<span class="italic">Harland's Manchester collectanea</span>, 145).<br>
<br>A great publicist, Mrs Raffald recorded most of the highlights of her later career by advertisements in the <span class="italic">Manchester Mercury</span> and she is reported to have assisted Harrop in its publication, both with money and with advice. She opened a shop in Fennell Street, Manchester, near her husband's floristry shop, supplying &#145;cold Entertainments, Hot French Dishes, Confectionaries, &amp;c.&#146;  (<span class="italic">Manchester Mercury</span>, 29 November 1763). In September 1766 she transferred her business to Exchange Alley by the Bull's Head in Market Place. This later became the Exchange Coffee House. She was a shrewd, tactful and strong-willed woman, with a good knowledge of French and an active concern for the poor. From her shop she ran a school of cookery and domestic economy, and what was probably the first register office for servants in Manchester.<br>
<br>In 1769 Mrs Raffald published her <span class="italic">Experienced English housekeeper, for the use and ease of ladies, housekeepers, cooks, &amp;c., wrote purely from practice &hellip; consisting of near 800 original receipts</span>. Six more genuine editions were published during her lifetime, all, according to their title pages, &#145;printed for the author&#146; and &#145;sold by R. Baldwin&#146;, the London printer. Baldwin reportedly paid Mrs Raffald &pound;1400 for the copyright. Apparently when he suggested certain northern expressions in her work be altered, she replied: &#145;What I have written I proposed to write at the time; it was written deliberately, and I cannot admit to any alteration&#146;  (<span class="italic">Harland's Manchester collectanea</span>, 147). The popularity of her work is shown by the many editions, mostly spurious, published in England and in Dublin during her lifetime and after. She is said to have refused to allow any portraits to be published, so that the first, from a painting by P. McMorland, appeared in the eighth edition in 1782, after her death.<br>
<br>For a time Mrs Raffald ran the Bull's Head near her shop but in 1772 the Raffalds took over the King's Head, Chapel Street, Salford, which they had &#145;fitted up in the neatest and most elegant manner&#146;  (<span class="italic">Manchester Mercury</span>, 25 August 1772). Within a month, they were advertising fortnightly &#145;Card assemblies&#146; during the winter season  (<span class="italic">Manchester Mercury</span>, 8 September 1772). The excellent cuisine and her ability to converse in French were said to have attracted many foreign visitors.<br>
<br>Mrs Raffald was instrumental in establishing a second Manchester newspaper, the <span class="italic">Prescott's Journal</span>, in 1771. The following year she published the first <span class="italic">Directory of Manchester</span>. A second extended edition including Salford followed in 1773, and a third in 1781. She wrote a book on midwifery, with Charles White, but did not live to print it. Her husband is believed to have sold the manuscript in London, but if published it bore another name. She died suddenly on 19 April 1781, and was buried in the churchyard at Stockport on 23 April among her husband's ancestors. Raffald, an able botanist and florist, but of improvident and irregular habits, moved to London after her death, and lived extravagantly. He died in December 1809, aged eighty-five, and was buried at Sacred Trinity Chapel, Salford.<br>
