<span class="headword">Carpenter,  George Alfred</span>  (1859&#150;1910), <span class="occ">physician and paediatrician</span>, was born on 25 December 1859 at 176 Lambeth Road, London, the son of John William Carpenter MD and his wife, Mary, daughter of George Butler of New Shoreham, Sussex. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/4725/', "Alfred John Carpenter")</script> was his uncle.<br>
<br>After two years (1874&#150;6) at Epsom College, a school then much favoured by doctors, Carpenter spent a year (1877) at King's College School, London, which had established an outstanding academic reputation and which educated many future distinguished members of the medical profession.<br>
<br>Carpenter trained first at St Thomas's Hospital, London, where he was a prizeman, qualifying MRCS and LSA in 1885. He graduated MB (London) in 1886 with first-class honours. Subsequently he studied at Guy's Hospital in 1889, qualifying MRCP in 1889 and MD (London) in 1890.<br>
<br>After a brief period as deputy medical superintendent at the Coppice Lunatic Hospital, Nottingham, Carpenter returned to London to practise at 12 Welbeck Street, Cavendish Square. His medical career, however, centred on his work with the young children of the poor. Between 1885 and 1903 he was on the staff of the Evelina Hospital for Sick Children, Southwark, where he was finally physician in charge of the extensive outpatients' department. In 1903 Carpenter was appointed assistant physician at the North Eastern Hospital for Sick Children, renamed the Queen's Hospital in 1908, which treated sick children of the poor under the age of twelve. At the time of his death Carpenter was full physician.<br>
<br>Carpenter's significant contributions to the study of paediatrics consisted not so much in any innovations he made in clinical treatment as in his assiduous compilation of case notes, his tireless efforts to encourage specialization in that branch of medicine, and in his meticulous editing and documentation of such work.<br>
<br>In 1900 Carpenter was joint founder and leading figure of the Society for the Study of Disease in Children of which provincial branches were rapidly established in England. He edited eight volumes of the society's reports between 1900 and 1908, after which it was incorporated as a section of the Royal Society of Medicine, of which Carpenter was vice-president at the time of his death.<br>
<br>In 1904 Carpenter founded the <span class="italic">British Journal of Disease in Children</span>, partly to fill the gap left when the American journal <span class="italic">Pediatrics</span> ceased publication. This was published jointly in New York and London, between 1896 and 1901. Carpenter was its English editor and a copious contributor to the eleven volumes. He was also a corresponding member of La Soci&eacute;t&eacute; P&eacute;diatrie of Paris and a member of La Soci&eacute;t&eacute; Fran&ccedil;aise d'Ophtalmologie, to both of which he contributed papers. He was also a regular contributor to <span class="italic">The Lancet</span> and the <span class="italic">British Medical Journal</span> and he read a number of papers to the Hunterian Society, the Royal Society of Medicine, and the Institute of Hygiene.<br>
<br>The time spent by Carpenter on his editorial and administrative tasks, besides his medical attention to sick children, may explain why he published only two books, both in 1901, <span class="italic">Syphilis in Children in Every-Day Practice</span> and <span class="italic">Golden Rules for Diseases of Infants and Children</span>. The former, one of the <span class="roman">Medical Monograph</span> series, draws heavily on Carpenter's comprehensive experience of the congenital complaints he had treated in infants of the poor. In reviewing the book <span class="italic">The Lancet</span> commented that though &#145;there is no new or original feature&#146; yet &#145;nothing, except for certain matters of treatment, is omitted&#146;.<br>
<br>Carpenter's Wightman lecture of 1909 is an account of the various congenital heart complaints that he had noted, mainly during his work at the two hospitals, together with references to the research of other specialists. The paper that he read to the Institute of Hygiene in 1907, &#145;The rearing of children&#146;, stresses the necessity of suitable food, clothing, and hygiene and moral guidance in the care of young children. One sentence in this paper voices the conviction brought home to him by his lifelong work among the poor: &#145;Many of life's failures are not so much hereditary as environmental&#146;.<br>
<br>Carpenter married H&eacute;l&egrave;ne Jeanne, daughter of Henry, Baron d'Este, on 21 April 1908. He died of a cerebral haemorrhage at Cold Harbour, Waddon, Surrey, on 27 March 1910, and was buried in the old Sanderstead churchyard.<br>
