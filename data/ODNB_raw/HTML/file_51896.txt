<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Burt family</span>  (<em>per. </em><em>c.</em>1830&#150;1964), <span class="occ">building contractors and civil engineers</span>, achieved prominence with <a name="cosubject_51897"></a><span class="headword">John Mowlem</span>  (1788&#150;1868), <span class="occ">contractor</span>. He was born at Carrants Court Cottages, Swanage, Dorset, on 12 October 1788, the third child and eldest son of John Mowlem (1751&#150;1837), quarryman, of a family long established there, and his wife, Hannah Froom (1764&#150;1836). &#145;His father and his three brothers and himself were the last gang of quarrymen who worked at Tilly Whim&#146;, an ancient Purbeck stoneworking  (Hardy, 121).<br>
<br>Though he himself told of quitting home for London almost penniless, travelling free on a stone-brig, it appears that when employed as a mason at Norris Castle, Isle of Wight, Mowlem was recommended by the architect to the master mason Henry Westmacott with a wharf in King's Row, Pimlico, near where Mowlem lodged on his arrival in London about 1807. &#145;He was a big, strong young fellow&#146;&#151;aged only twelve, but tall for his age, he had been obliged to hide from a press gang&#151;&#145;with a splendid eye and hand for work&#146;  (Hardy, 122). Despite working for &#145;beggarly wages&#146; he married Susannah (1788&#150;1849), daughter of George Manwell of Swanage, at St George's, Hanover Square, on 29 February 1812. They lived at various addresses in King's Row, Pimlico, for several years; his wife soon became indisposed, suffering poor health the rest of her life. Mowlem, &#145;honest, industrious and sober&#146;, was &#145;taken from the number of journeymen to complete a job in Whittlebury Forest at the house of General Fitzroy&#146;, as foreman about 1815. &#145;This being completed&#146;, he recalled, &#145;I was made foreman over all the works then going on in London&#146;  (Baines, 1.7&#150;8).<br>
<br>Responding to the emerging demand for macadamizing London's streets, Mowlem set up as a paving contractor and stone merchant about 1823, though it took several years to establish himself. He moved from Pimlico in 1825 to share a house in Upper Quebec Street, Marylebone, with his wife's brother, Henry, parish rate collector. In 1831&#150;6 the Mowlems lived in Chester Place, Regent's Park (partly sublet), by which time he enjoyed a substantial interest in several metropolitan paving contracts, including the West End parishes. But the competition was intense; failure to maintain an adequate supply of stone sometimes lost a contract, though his rivals suffered similarly, and there is evidence of collusion. It was by close attention to detail that Mowlem made his profits in a trade of large turnover but narrow margins&#151;in 1838 his turnover was probably rather more than &pound;12,000. Perennially short of cash, he operated on bills of exchange.<br>
<br>In 1839&#150;40 Mowlem undertook his first work of national importance, paving Blackfriars Bridge with the granite sets known as &#145;narrow cubes&#146;, of which he was the first manufacturer. He realized that this could establish him in the first rank of paving contractors. &#145;This contract&#146;, he wrote, &#145;is one of the best I have ever had and will place me above harm and in that situation in the Metropolis where I shall be much envied&#146; (that is, by rival contractors; Baines, 1.72&#150;3). Leaving his ordinary business to be managed by his wife's nephew George Burt and Burt's brother-in-law, Joseph Freeman, he moved to Guernsey (where he had long been a major purchaser) for eight months in November 1839 to ensure the vital supplies of granite. &#145;Although this is the devil's own battle to fight, I will stick here; for if the job is completed well, all will be well afterwards &hellip; I <i>will</i> have a large share of the Metropolis&#146;  (ibid.).<br>
<br>Contending with hostile merchants, Mowlem leased and bought quarries; faced with incessant rain, he introduced tarpaulins into the quarries, and himself often took a double turn at the pump; &#145;I am so fatigued in the evening I can scarcely get home&#146;  (Baines, 1.72&#150;3). Lacking sufficient stone-dressers, he raised piece-rates, brought quarrymen from the mainland, reduced his charge for dressing stones from 4<i>d</i>. to 3<i>d</i>., and sent some stones for dressing in London. His gamble succeeded: he prised the St Clement Danes' paving contract from the firm that had held it for twenty years, succeeded George Manwell as office of works contracting mason for the London district, responsible for maintaining government property, and in 1842 recovered the St Martin's paviour's and mason's contract. When in January 1845 he took George Burt and Joseph Freeman into partnership, the firm's stock was valued at &pound;4668, including stone, barges, horse-trucks, horses, a crane, and a travelling scaffold; by 1850 the valuation had more than doubled.<br>
<br>Despite retiring in 1845 to Swanage, where he bought property (most extensively from 1857), became a public benefactor, and found time for an all-over wash in cold water every morning&#151;&#145;I have been too busy through the whole of my life to indulge in this sort of cleanliness&#146;  (Baines, 1.224)&#151;Mowlem kept a close eye on the metropolitan paving contracts. He attended committees himself when necessary, and travelled to inspect quarries&#151;in 1847 alone he needed 50,000 tons of Guernsey stone. Coal provided freight for his brigs when they were not carrying stone. 1848 saw a notable expansion in the firm's activities, and Mowlem secured a dominant position in the supply of granite. In May 1851 the firm was &#145;very successful&#146;  (<span class="italic">John Mowlem's Swanage Diary</span>, 120) in bidding for the London vestries' contracts&#151;some for only hundreds of pounds&#151;that provided nearly all the firm's work into the 1870s, earning it the sobriquet of London John. Work for ten major local authorities in the 1860s grossed an average of over &pound;50,000 per annum.<br>
<br>Mowlem's manuscript diary shows that, although he had little formal education, he wrote a clear round hand, and expressed himself clearly and pithily (&#145;as demure as an old whore at a christening&#146;; <span class="italic">John Mowlem's Swanage Diary</span>, 73). Physically tough&#151;at fifty-two he described himself as &#145;waterproof. I stand my ground, blow high, blow low, and am as hearty as a buck, never destined for a drawing-room&#146;  (Baines, 1.79&#150;80)&#151;, &#145;too fond of money to gamble&#146;  (<span class="italic">John Mowlem's Swanage Diary</span>, 83), he yet found time to go to the Derby. He enjoyed wine and music, particularly Handel and German chorales. Travelling in France and Germany in 1846 for the benefit of his wife's health, he noted the high quality of German masonry and acquired a liking for warm baths which led him to install a bathroom on his return home. &#145;Very respectful to upper ranks&#146;  (Baines, 1.217) and lacking sympathy for the Chartists he none the less contemned aristocratic superciliousness and sympathized with the Anti-Corn Law League. In 1849 he was elected an assistant of the Glass-Sellers' Company. Though brought up a Methodist, he became a churchgoer and was a connoisseur of sermons. He was a freemason. As a Dorset magistrate he found his colleagues &#145;a set of old ladies&#146;, half a millennium behind the times  (<span class="italic">John Mowlem's Swanage Diary</span>, 123). He died, childless, at Purbeck House, Swanage, on 8 March 1868 and was buried at Swanage cemetery.<br>
<br>Mowlem's principal partner, <a name="cosubject_51896"></a><span class="headword">George Burt</span>  (1816&#150;1894)<span class="occ"></span>, contractor, was born at Swanage on 2 October 1816, the eldest son of Robert Burt (<i>d</i>. 1847), stone merchant, and his wife, Laetitia Manwell (<i>c</i>.1787&#150;1861), sister of Mowlem's wife. After starting work as a stonemason in the Swanage quarries, at the age of nineteen George Burt was summoned to join his uncle in London, becoming his partner in 1844. Burt presided over a change in the character of the firm's work: the financial crisis of 1866&#150;7 that brought down many great speculative contractors left Mowlems unimpeded, so that they were able to enter the list of major public-works contractors, landing one of the biggest contracts then offered, for building Queen Victoria Street in the City (1869). Their new status was secured by rebuilding Billingsgate Market (1874&#150;7); thereafter they played a leading role in London (notably the City of London School in 1880, Smithfield fruit market in 1882, and the Imperial Institute in 1887, as well as major sewerage and railway works).<br>
<br>George Burt married Elizabeth (<i>b</i>. 1812), daughter of John Hudson of Stow, Norfolk, on 19 May 1840; they had two sons and three daughters. In 1850 he leased a five-bedroomed house in Cambridge Place, Paddington, where his family lived with a governess and two female servants. Tall, with broad forehead, deepset eyes, and long, curved nose, in later life he wore a full beard and moustache. According to Thomas Hardy, who met him in 1892, Burt &#145;had a good profile, but was rougher in speech than I should have expected after his years in London&#146;  (Lewer and Smale, 138). He continued his uncle's transformation of Swanage into a seaside resort, buying property and planning to develop Durston Park as a villa estate; he established gas and waterworks as well as a pier from which his paddle-steamer plied to Bournemouth, and he built a pretentious mansion, Purbeck House, in the main street, and was satirized in Elizabeth Godfrey's novel, <span class="italic">The Cradle of a Poet</span> (1910), as a vulgarian flaunting his wealth. He left a reputation as &#145;the amazing Burt, in whose nature eccentricity and business capacity, and the instincts of the pedagogue, the philanthropist and the money-maker seem to have been strangely mixed&#146;  (Lewer and Smale, 139).<br>
<br>Collecting relics of old London, often from his firm's own demolitions, Burt re-erected many in Swanage, notably the porch for the post-fire Mercers' Hall, now adorning the town hall. He was a JP in the metropolis and Dorset, a prominent freemason, an active member of the Metropolitan Asylums Board, three times master of the Glass-Sellers' Company, and in 1878&#150;9 sheriff of London. Although he paid for the building of St Aldhelm's Anglican church in Swanage (1892), Burt also subscribed to rebuilding the Methodist church (1886), where his face was carved over the entrance. He died suddenly, of heart disease, at Purbeck House on 18 April 1894, but was buried at Kensal Green cemetery in London. He established a Purbeck Estate Trust to perpetuate the house for his family's residence, its contents devolving as heirlooms with the estate. His other extensive property in Swanage he bequeathed to his children to be developed for building.<br>
<br>George Burt's elder son, <a name="cosubject_51895"></a><span class="headword">Sir John Mowlem Burt</span>  (1845&#150;1918)<span class="occ"></span>, contractor, born in Paddington on 2 February 1845, godson of John Mowlem, took up his dominant role. Physically, John Mowlem Burt strongly resembled his father. Educated privately and at Marischal College, Aberdeen, he began as a mason in the company's Aberdeen yards (acquired in 1858), before returning to London; instructed in all the departments, he proved &#145;a quick learner and an active man in carrying forward work&#146;, as well as a &#145;kind-hearted lad&#146;  (<span class="italic">Aberdeen Free Press</span>). He became a partner in 1875, overseeing such major works as the Admiralty extensions and arch (1896&#150;1901, 1906&#150;14); New Scotland Yard (1908); Institution of Civil Engineers (1911); and refronting Buckingham Palace (1913). As contractor for the coronation annexe at Westminster Abbey he was knighted in 1902. The firm was incorporated in 1903 but reverted to a private company in 1908.<br>
<br>John Mowlem Burt married Marion (1847&#150;1903), daughter of Robert Ker Aitchison, merchant, on 9 February 1869; they had one son and two daughters. The year after her death he married Grace Emma, daughter of Joseph Blackstone, a doctor. Like his father, Burt was a freemason. In 1881 he was living with his wife and children, three servants, and a nurse, at 18 Grosvenor Road, adjoining Mowlem's extensive leasehold premises. On his second marriage he bought Durlston, Elsworthy Road, Hampstead. In 1916 he moved to his house at Swanage, where he had long been active in local government. He died on 20 February 1918 at his Swanage house, Carthion. He divided the bulk of his estate equally among his three children, his son having the option of taking his holding in J. Mowlem &amp; Co.<br>
<br>His nephew, <a name="cosubject_46796"></a><span class="headword">Sir George Mowlem Burt</span>  (1884&#150;1964)<span class="occ"></span>, contractor and civil engineer, made still greater advances. Born in Grosvenor Road, Westminster, on 10 January 1884, he was the elder son of George Burt (1851&#150;1919)&#151;younger son of George Burt (1816&#150;1894) and a governing director of the firm&#151;and his wife and cousin, Emily, daughter of James Arbon and his wife, Susannah Manwell, John Mowlem's favourite. George Mowlem Burt was educated at Clifton College and followed his father's and uncle's path into the family firm in 1902, becoming an apprentice in the joiners' shop. His progress was rapid. Promoted assistant foreman on the Admiralty Arch in 1906 and an outside superintendent in 1911, he was appointed to the board in 1913 at a salary of &pound;600. On his father's death he became supervising director. In 1911 he married Olave Charlotte Sortain, daughter of Frederich E. Hulbert of Rotherfield, Sussex; they had one son.<br>
<br>A rich crop of contracts immediately after the First World War included the Port of London Authority (PLA) offices at Tower Hill, the Star and Garter Home at Richmond, and Bush House, Aldwych (1929 and 1934), followed by a great deal of dock reconstruction for the Port of London Authority; dock, jetty, and factory for Fords at Dagenham; and the King George V graving dock, Southampton. Other major London contracts included the Peter Robinson department store, the new Lloyds building, titanic office-blocks on Millbank for Imperial Chemical Industries (1927&#150;8), power stations (Fulham and Battersea), and hospitals (St Mary's, Paddington, and the Royal Masonic).<br>
<br>Such a scale of operations called for a wider capital base: George Mowlem Burt took the company public in 1925 with a capital of &pound;500,000 (&pound;350,000 issued), paying a 7.5 per cent dividend. The annual turnover rose from an average of &pound;1,530,000 in the 1920s to &pound;3,470,000 in the 1930s. Rearmament and war brought yet greater increases: construction of the Royal Ordnance Factory, Swynnerton (1939&#150;42), alone cost &pound;4 million. From 1940 to 1945 Mowlems won over &pound;29 million worth of contracts, including airfield runways and concrete units for Mulberry harbours. Similarly, Mowlems played an important role in post-war reconstruction, notably power stations and refineries. When Burt retired as chairman in 1961 (becoming president), his company ranked eleventh in the British construction industry.<br>
<br>Knighted in 1942, and appointed KBE in 1955, Sir George Mowlem Burt actively promoted the interests of the construction industry. A notable committee man, he was a founding member of the Federation of Civil Engineering Contractors, serving as chairman in 1932&#150;3 and president in 1946&#150;8 and 1951&#150;6. He also served as president of the London Master Builders Association (1921), and of the International Federation of Building and Public Works (1930). On the board of the Building Research Station from about 1936 to 1956, he was chairman for ten years. In addition he served on several important committees under the ministries of Health and Works, accompanied Lord Portal to the USA in 1942 to study building methods, and chaired the interdepartmental committee on alternative forms of house construction. He was an Olympic fencer (1920 and 1924) and British &eacute;p&eacute;e champion in 1922. Enthusiastic for traditional country gentry sports, from 1931 to 1937 he was master of the Old Surrey and Burstow hunt. He died at his home, Comforts Place, Tandridge Lane, Lingfield, Surrey, on 1 September 1964.<br>
<br>For several generations the Burt family exemplified the characteristics of the founder of their firm. Self-educated, John Mowlem had slowly built up a considerable and profitable contracting business with a high degree of vertical integration, largely confined to a particular sector, on the basis of small unit profits on a steadily increasing turnover. The Burts further expanded the firm, and seized an opportunity afforded by their conservative financial policy to break into major public building contracting. They, like Mowlem, made an enduring impact on their native Swanage, but although they established estates they remained primarily public-works contractors. After the First World War the enormous cost of public works demanded a widening of their capital base to be obtained only by a public flotation, but the family's predominance in the company was maintained for nearly half a century longer.<br>
