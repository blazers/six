<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Williams,  John Henry</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1747, <em>d.</em> 1829), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and peace advocate</span>, was baptized in Gloucester Cathedral on 10 April 1747, the son of John Williams and his wife, Mary (<i>d</i>. 1800); his armigerous family was descended from the distinguished judge Sir David Williams (1550&#150;1613). Williams attended the College School, Gloucester, from 1755 and matriculated at Pembroke College, Oxford, in 1763. He graduated LLB in 1769, was ordained (deacon, 1768; priest, 1769), and in 1774 was briefly vicar of Winchcombe in Gloucestershire. In 1776 and 1777 he was curate of Cherington, Warwickshire, where the rector was John Warner. In 1778, at Waterstock, Oxfordshire, Williams married Warner's daughter, Sarah (1747/8&#150;1820). The couple had three children: Henry (Harry, who became a clergyman), Grace, and Sarah, baptized respectively in 1780, 1781, and 1785.<br>
<br>Besides Cherington, John Warner was rector of Fleet Marston in Buckinghamshire, and in 1776, following Warner's resignation, Williams succeeded him there. Two years later Williams became vicar of Wellesbourne, Warwickshire, residing in the parsonage, and also serving the nearby chapel of Walton Deyville; he retained the Fleet Marston living until his death, employing curates. Judging by Bishop Richard Hurd's 1782 survey of the Worcester diocese, and the neat parish registers, Williams discharged his duties at Wellesbourne and Walton most conscientiously. He seems to have been a cultured man who enjoyed drama and music and was well read&#151;for a time he was president of Wellesbourne's book club, comprising &#145;the principal clergy and gentry of the place and its neighbourhood&#146;  (W. Field, <span class="italic">Memoirs of &hellip; Samuel Parr</span>, vol. 1, 1828, 207). His social acquaintance included local whigs&#151;notably the Dormer family, Bertie Greatheed of Guy's Cliffe, and Dr Samuel Parr of Hatton; the last apparently &#145;often spoke of [Williams] in terms of fervent admiration and esteem&#146;  (ibid., 206). Williams also appears financially adroit. He exchanged lands which he owned in Wales for land at Fleet Marston, and greatly improved the parsonage at Wellesbourne and its outbuildings.<br>
<br>In 1793, following the outbreak of war between Britain and France, the government proclaimed a general fast day for 19 April, to be marked by Church of England services. The forms of services implored God's blessing on the nation's arms and vilified the French revolutionaries; in sermons, parsons were to justify the war. Williams was troubled: should he promote &#145;the thirst of bloodshed&#146; or &#145;by the sullenness of his doubts [incur] the imputation of disloyalty?&#146;  (<span class="italic">Two Sermons</span>, viii). He resolved to denounce the war from the pulpit, and publish the sermon. The 1793 sermon, <span class="italic">Piety, Charity, and Loyalty</span>, was published by a radical Birmingham printer, John Thompson. It was reprinted and issued with another which Williams preached on the 1794 fast day, by George Robinson, the great London publisher. Robinson's firm also published Williams's <span class="italic">War the Stumbling-Block of a Christian, or, The Absurdity of Defending Religion by the Sword</span> (1795) and <span class="italic">A Thanksgiving Sermon for the Peace</span> (1802).<br>
<br>Williams was not a pacifist, always opposed to war. In 1795 he stated &#145;we can perceive no grounds for the assertion that a Christian <i>must not fight</i>&#146;  (<span class="italic">War the Stumbling-Block</span>, 23). But he maintained that self-protection was the sole Christian justification for armed conflict: &#145;[a] Christian may not fight, either individually or collectively, except in the unavoidable and unequivocal necessity of self-defence&#146;  (<span class="italic">Thanksgiving Sermon</span>, 9). Furthermore, for Williams, war was &#145;the most horrid and unnatural state of man&#146;  (<span class="italic">Two Sermons</span>, 19). Its physical horrors were appalling, and it was &#145;pregnant with moral anarchy, religious corruption, and political distress&#146;  (<span class="italic">Thanksgiving Sermon</span>, 9). He feared for the souls of the military, and thought that war bred malice, intolerance, and suspicion at home. He scorned the notion that the defence of religion was one of the conflict's chief objects: &#145;[t]he SWORD of Christianity is the WORD OF GOD, and it will not admit of carnal warfare, either for its propagation or its defence&#146;  (<span class="italic">War the Stumbling-Block</span>, 6). Peace nurtured religion and national well-being: &#145;[w]ithout the dew of peace, the seeds of the Gospel will neither spring nor grow&#146;  (<span class="italic">Two Sermons</span>, 62); &#145;[w]ith Peace dwell piety, charity, science, literature, industry, security and liberty&#146;  (<span class="italic">Thanksgiving Sermon</span>, 8). Williams deplored, moreover, the government's presumption in expecting the clergy's &#145;pious assent to the justice and necessity&#146; of the conflict  (<span class="italic">Two Sermons</span>, vii). The secular arm, now enjoying, he maintained, &#145;a complete ascendancy&#146;, had converted the church &#145;into a mere engine of the state&#146;  (ibid., v&#150;vi). He despised those clergymen who followed the arguments of Samuel Horsley and other supporters of a damaging church&#150;state alliance and meekly submitted to the government's commands.<br>
<br>Williams plainly crafted the printed versions of the sermons very carefully. The style is polished, some of the imagery memorable. He chose his texts sensibly and naturally took care to buttress his arguments with references to, or quotations from, the scriptures. His sermons were reviewed in a range of periodicals and, when criticized, Williams defended his opinions in the newspaper press. The <span class="italic">Monthly Review</span> noted in 1795 that his reasoning, &#145;aided by the resistless weight of the sacred writings, has made a greater impression on our minds, than has always been the case when we have risen from the perusal of discourses of the same kind&#146;  (<span class="italic">Monthly Review</span>, 475).<br>
<br>From 1796 to 1801 Williams probably continued to preach against the war, though the sermons were not published. In 1797 the Warwickshire whigs produced a requisition for a county meeting, which Williams signed, and at the meeting at Warwick he read a petition&#151;which was adopted&#151;asking George III to dismiss the younger Pitt's ministry and stop the war. The incident demonstrated Williams's high standing in Warwickshire opposition politics, although the petition emphasized political and economic arguments against the war, rather than the Christian ethics of his published sermons. Williams's political stance had long antagonized local tories; and in response to the meeting they commissioned a medal showing the high sheriff, Parr (who had composed the address), and Williams in a cart with hangman's nooses above. For his part, Williams disliked the loyalists' fervour; in 1793 for instance he deplored their &#145;self-constituted dictatorial and inquisitorial associations&#146;  (<span class="italic">Two Sermons</span>, 30).<br>
<br>Williams published no sermons during the Napoleonic wars: perhaps Napoleon's aggression convinced him that the renewed conflict was one of legitimate self-defence. None the less, in 1815 the Unitarian minister and writer William Field recalled Williams's &#145;admirable discourses&#146; in his <span class="italic">Historical and Descriptive Account &hellip; of Warwick and &hellip; Leamington</span>  (p. 360); and in his <span class="italic">Memoirs of &hellip; Samuel Parr</span> he declared that Williams might &#145;justly claim a distinguished place among the most enlightened and liberal clergymen of his time&#146;  (p. 206). In his seventies Williams continued to undertake his duties at Wellesbourne and Walton (though he also arranged a curacy): he conducted his wife's funeral in 1820, and performed his last christening, marriage, and burial services in 1826. He died on 12 May 1829 at Leamington, and was buried at St Peter's Church, Wellesbourne, on 18 May. He left his house at Leamington and his other property to his children Henry and Grace.<br>
<br>Williams's portrait was painted by William Artaud; in 1815 it hung with several Greatheed family portraits at Guy's Cliffe. William Say engraved a mezzotint of it. It shows a man with a high brow, dark, searching, thoughtful eyes, a long nose, and short chin; the expression is earnest and slightly anxious.<br>
