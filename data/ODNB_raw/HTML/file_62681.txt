<span class="headword">Bristed,  Charles Astor</span>  (1820&#150;1874), <span class="occ">literary critic and writer on English university life</span>, was born in New York on 6 October 1820, the son of John Bristed (1778&#150;1855), an English-born clergyman in the protestant Episcopalian church in the USA and a prolific author, and his wife, Magdalen (1788&#150;1832), the divorced wife of Adrian Bentzon and eldest child of John Jacob Astor. The marriage soon failed, and after his mother's death in 1832 Bristed was brought up by his grandfather in a bachelor establishment where he had frequent contact with the poet Fitz-Greene Halleck and the Anglophile writer Washington Irving. After being taught classics at the Revd T. Huddart's school by the eccentric Englishman Henry Herbert (Frank Forester), he entered Yale in 1835, gaining several prizes and graduating in 1839. In the following year he went to Trinity College, Cambridge, gaining further prizes and, in 1845, second-class honours in the classical tripos. The friends he made in Cambridge included William Johnson (later Cory), Henry Maine, Tom Taylor, and Henry Hallam; his experiences were recorded in <span class="italic">Five Years in an English University</span> (1852), perhaps the best account of the student experience ever written in English.<br>
<br>Both before and after his return to the USA in 1846 Bristed contributed to journals on a wide variety of topics; he published over 200 articles in all, many under the pseudonym Carl Benson. The income and Manhattan property that J. J. Astor left him at his death in 1848 enabled Bristed to live a life of leisure, much of which he devoted to writing. A series of articles in <span class="italic">Fraser's Magazine</span> later became <span class="italic">The Upper Ten Thousand: Sketches of American Society</span> (1852), a vivid account of the life of the New York social &eacute;lite at home and on holiday. In 1851 Bristed moved to Paris with his wife, Laura Brevoort (<i>d</i>. 1861), whom he had married on 14 January 1847. He witnessed the 1851 <i>coup d'&eacute;tat</i>, and described it, and Parisian social life, in a series of articles for the <span class="italic">Literary World</span>. In the mid-1850s the Bristeds moved to Baden-Baden, his grandfather's birthplace; here he had printed a collection of his articles, <span class="italic">Pieces of a Broken-Down Critic</span> (4 vols. in 1, 1858&#150;9). After his wife's death in 1861 Bristed returned to the USA. During the Civil War he was active in support for the Union, working for the Loyal Publication Society and publishing several polemical pamphlets. Throughout his adult life Bristed suffered from rheumatism, from which he died on 14 January 1874 at his home, 1715 Kalb Street, Washington, DC; he was survived by his second wife, Grace Sedgwick (1833&#150;1897), whom he had married in August 1867, two sons, and one (illegitimate) daughter.<br>
<br>The wealth Bristed inherited enabled him to live where and how he wished, and he travelled extensively. The two books he published in 1852 offered insights into English life for Americans and vice versa; several later articles described and interpreted French society and culture for his countrymen. He was an early reader of Baudelaire, whom he probably met, and defended the life and work of George Sand against her moralistic American detractors. In the 1860s he wrote for <span class="italic">The Knickerbocker</span>, the <span class="italic">Round Table</span>, and <span class="italic">The Galaxy</span>, New York magazines which pioneered the untrammelled discussion of literature and art and sought to break free of the puritanism of the Boston &eacute;lite. Bristed had a lifelong interest in the classics and in comparative philology. His essay &#145;The American language&#146; (<span class="italic">Cambridge Essays 1855</span>, 1855) was described by H. L. Mencken as &#145;the most intelligent brief discussion of the subject ever penned &hellip; The first really full-length defence of American by an American&#146;  (<span class="italic">The American Language</span>, 1949, 69&#150;71). He also contributed papers on the pronunciation of Latin to the first meetings of the American Philological Association in the early 1870s. Bristed was remembered by his friends as a witty and generous host and a man of high principle; his writings, though at times self-centred, are marked by a refreshingly acid intelligence. On his death, his contemporary George Templeton Strong remarked that &#145;In spite of certain foibles and oddities, &#147;Carl Benson&#148; is a great loss. We have few such scholars, and nobody more honest of purpose and resolute in expression&#146;  (J. A. Nevins and M. H. Thomas, eds., <span class="italic">The Diaries of George Templeton Strong</span>, 1952, 4.510).<br>
<br>Bristed's wealth, his leisured life, and the nature and range of his writings have led to an understandable but unjustified neglect. His <span class="italic">Five Years in an English University</span> stands out, in its vivid description and richness of detail, in a genre it helped to create: the extended account of university life. Its status as a personal memoir gives it more immediacy than V. A. Huber's lengthy survey <span class="italic">The English Universities</span> (1843, translated from a German original of 1839); it certainly tells us more about Cambridge than the later account by Bristed's fellow-countryman William Everett (<span class="italic">On the Cam</span>, 1866). It has in fact become an important primary source, drawn on heavily in modern accounts. The book was written, Bristed tells us, principally to show Americans what could be learned from the English universities; he is scathing about his earlier alma mater, Yale, and in his final chapter urges reforms in some detail. Cambridge too came in for criticism; but for the most part, <span class="italic">Five Years</span> reads like the recollection of a lost paradise. Charles Bristed, an Anglophile in the USA but an American patriot when in England, a long-term resident in four different countries, perhaps found it difficult to be completely at home anywhere. The life of his nephew William Waldorf Astor took a different, though also transatlantic, course: he emigrated from the USA to England in 1890, to become Viscount Astor and the founder of an English dynasty.<br>
