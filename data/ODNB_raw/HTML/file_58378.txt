<span class="headword">Doharty <span class="st"> [Dougharty]</span>,  John</span>  (1709&#150;1773), <span class="occ">land surveyor</span>, was born on 17 January 1709 at Bewdley, Worcestershire, the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7853/', "John Dougharty (1677&#150;1755)")</script>, a land surveyor and teacher of mathematics, and his wife, Priscilla Fereder (<i>d</i>. 1741). Nine years earlier the couple had had another son John, who died within a few days of his birth. The surviving son John was educated at the King's School, Worcester (1716&#150;23), and the technical skill that he displayed in his first surveying commissions suggest that he had been sent thereafter to London for professional training. His brother <a name="cosubject_73796"></a><span class="headword">Joseph Dougharty</span>  (1699&#150;1737), also a <span class="occ">surveyor</span>, was born on 5 May 1699 in Kidderminster. He was educated at the King's School, Worcester (1712&#150;14), and later in London with a view to pursuing a career in mathematics. He returned to Worcestershire to help his father as both teacher and surveyor.<br>
<br>The family had a flourishing land-surveying business which produced estate maps for the local gentry and aristocracy, with whom contacts were forged through pupils at the father's school and the adjacent King's School. Between 1727 and 1732 Joseph produced fine estate maps of lands in Shropshire and Herefordshire as well as Worcestershire, and between 1731 and 1733 Joseph and more especially John undertook the arduous fieldwork for their father's famous survey of Hanbury Hall, Worcestershire. John Dougharty's last dated map was completed in 1736, and in 1737 Joseph died, leaving John Doharty junior, as he then styled himself, to continue the surveying work alone. The first map he had produced by himself was made in 1732, and some eighty of his maps and plans have now been discovered. These include surveys of the earl of Coventry's lands in Worcestershire and Gloucestershire (1738&#150;40), apparently intended to form an estate atlas to match his father's of Hanbury Hall. Although most are of estates in the west midlands, Doharty also worked for clients, notably King's College, Cambridge (1747&#150;51), as far afield as Middlesex and Somerset. His maps exemplify the range of a land surveyor's work, having been drawn for such purposes as boundary disputes, promoting enclosure, and assisting estate management, but they show greater technical skill and finer aesthetic judgement than many such maps. Doharty also undertook land valuation work, laid out pleasure grounds in Worcester, invested in property, and was one of the original partners in the first porcelain works in the city. His last map is dated 1755.<br>
<br>The death in that year of Doharty's father, whom, as he remained unmarried he had continued to live with and support, marked the start of his decline. His melancholy writings of the period indicate his insecurity and megalomania with a hint of trouble with a woman, ill health, and fire. In 1755 he left Worcester to live with his nephew John Powell on the western outskirts of London, but he was admitted a pensioner of Sutton's Hospital (the Charterhouse) on 31 March 1760. Absent for a time because of infirmity and insanity, he died there on 6 April 1773 and was buried there on 9 April.<br>
<br>The surviving maps and plans drawn by both brothers and their father (listed as appendix 1 to Smith, &#145;The Doharty family&#146;) bear witness to the skill and industry of these important west midland land surveyors.<br>
