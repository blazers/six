<span class="headword">Gunn,  Thomas Edward</span>  (1844&#150;1923), <span class="occ">taxidermist</span>, was born at Trafalgar Street, Lakenham, Norwich, Norfolk, on 5 November 1844, the son of Robert Gunn, coachbuilder, and his wife, Charlotte, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Hipper. After attending the Norwich Blue Coat School he was apprenticed aged fourteen to John Sayer, the long-established taxidermist at 47 St Giles Street, Norwich. He subsequently rose to become Sayer's manager and chief taxidermist, taking over the business when Sayer died in 1866. This was a time of increasing interest in wildlife and taxidermy. Gunn had the good fortune to be practising in the heyday of collection-based natural history and was based in an area rich in birdlife, including a regular influx of rare migrant birds, much in demand from museums and gentleman collectors. The business grew, and in the mid-1870s moved to larger premises at 84&#150;6 St Giles Street, Norwich, where it remained for sixty-five years, one of Britain's largest and most respected taxidermy operations.<br>
<br>Gunn developed a distinctive style of high-quality taxidermy and was widely known beyond East Anglia. His glass cases were almost invariably of the wooden box type (with only a single glass pane to the front). Typically the inside was washed with a bluish grey, and decorated with dried reeds and sedges painted pale yellowish green. The simulated mud or sand groundwork was made from absorbent grey paper, glued into mounds and slopes, then covered with sand and painted, usually ochre or dark brown. His mounted bird specimens were typically bound tightly with threads while the feathers dried, creating a tight and sleek appearance when the threads were removed. He used a peculiar system for the wire support within his birds, evidently learned from his mentor John Sayer, and not illustrated in the contemporary taxidermy manuals.<br>
<br>Most of Gunn's work consisted of British birds, trapped or shot around the coasts and wetlands of Norfolk by gamekeepers and professional wildfowlers. Working in Norwich, he had access to many key sites, especially for rare migrants, such as bluethroats and the occasional egret, spoonbill, or ibis, and he supplied many of the major bird collectors of his day. After severe winters kingfishers and bitterns would be brought to the shop, having been found starving as a result of being unable to feed in frozen streams and lakes. Fishermen, sport shooters, and the general public anxious to preserve some natural beauty were also among his customers. Specimens of fish were sometimes preserved by him, as well as cases of otters (usually depicted with a fish as prey, but snarling unnaturally).<br>
<br>Gunn married, on 13 August 1865, Maria (1845/6&#150;1889), daughter of William Frankling, builder. They had at least three sons and five daughters. An awkward-looking man, with a large beard, high forehead, thin hair, and a tendency to wear eccentric floppy-brimmed hats when out in the field, Gunn was sometimes irreverently referred to as &#145;Robinson Crusoe&#146;. He was a keen wildfowler and shot many of the birds that he set up, some of them illegally, for which he was prosecuted in 1881. Nevertheless he was a widely respected member of the local community, a freemason, and a lifelong member of the Norwich and Norfolk Conservative Club. His personal interests included angling and bowls. He enjoyed a high reputation as a field naturalist and published many of his own observations in appropriate journals, including <span class="italic">The Field</span> and <span class="italic">The Zoologist</span>. He was elected a fellow of the Linnean Society in 1883 and was a founder member of the Norfolk and Norwich Naturalists' Society. Natural history was thus both his hobby and his job.<br>
<br>Gunn had his own personal egg collection, and an extensive collection of taxidermy, each with its own meticulous catalogue. The taxidermy comprised carefully designed cases, set up with the birds in typical habitat scenes, and stacked to the ceiling in his Norwich home. The collection mostly comprised Norfolk birds, but included red grouse, shot on a visit to Staffordshire. He created similar cases for many of the famous collectors of the day, including Edward Thomas Booth (1842&#150;1890) of Brighton, who had pioneered the idea of &#145;habitat groups&#146; for the display of birds, and for the ophthalmologist and sportsman&#150;naturalist Fergus Menteith Ogilvie (1861&#150;1918), whose fine collection (now in Ipswich Museum) includes some of the best surviving examples of Gunn's work. Gunn would accompany these valued customers on shooting trips and often stayed at Calke Abbey in Derbyshire, where he taught Sir Vauncey Harpur Crewe, tenth baronet, the art of taxidermy and assisted in building up a considerable natural history collection there.<br>
<br>Ill health having forced his retirement from business in 1919, Gunn died at the Bethel Hospital, Bethel Street, Norwich, on 13 July 1923, and was buried in Norwich. He bequeathed his business and associated equipment to his son Frederick Ernest Gunn (1869&#150;1950), who continued working until the Second World War. After the war he disposed of the taxidermy shop and donated the remains of his father's collection to the Natural History Museum in London.<br>
