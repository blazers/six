<span class="headword">Powell,  Lawrence Fitzroy</span>  (1881&#150;1975), <span class="occ">literary scholar and librarian</span>, was born at 235 Cowley Road, Oxford, on 9 August 1881. He was the youngest of the seven children of Harry Powell (1830&#150;1886), a trumpeter, who was wounded in the charge of the light brigade of 1854 and who published his <span class="italic">Recollections</span> in 1876, and his wife, Anne Budd, of Oxford. Powell was named after two of Harry Powell's regimental officers. He was educated at a board school in London.<br>
<br>Powell began work in the library of Brasenose College, Oxford, in 1893, and in 1895 became a boy helper at the Bodleian Library, under E. W. B. Nicholson. In 1901 he joined the team of William Craigie on the <span class="italic">New English Dictionary</span>. On 31 July 1909 he married Ethelwyn Rebecca (1873/4&#150;1941), writer, daughter of James Slatter Steane, wine merchant, of Oxford. They had one son. In 1914 Powell was declared unfit for active service, but joined the Admiralty in 1916. After the war he returned to the <span class="italic">New English Dictionary</span>. In 1921, supported by Joseph Wright and Charles Firth, he was appointed librarian of the Taylor Institution, Oxford, from which he retired in 1949. Thereafter he supervised many graduate research students, and was recognized by honorary fellowships at St Catherine's and Pembroke colleges in 1966, and an Oxford DLitt in 1969. It was one of his few boasts that he had never taken an academic examination in his life.<br>
<br>Powell's lexicographical work under Craigie laid the foundations of his scholarship, enforcing an interest in Samuel Johnson. In 1923 R. W. Chapman invited him to revise the edition by G. Birkbeck Hill of James Boswell. The four volumes were published in 1934, and acknowledged with the award of a DLitt by Durham University in 1935. Thereafter, as for Johnson, the title was inseparable from his name. The emergence of more Boswellian material from Malahide Castle and Fettercairn House led to a full edition of Boswell's <span class="italic">Tour to the Hebrides</span>. A motoring tour of Scotland with James Marshall Osborn in 1935 was followed by annual excursions with Esmond de Beer to Raasay, where Powell prepared articles and papers in tranquil surroundings and pursued the intricacies of highland genealogy. This edition was published in 1950 as volume 5 of his <span class="italic">Boswell</span>, together with a separate index volume to the whole.<br>
<br>Powell's scholarship ranged over work on the sections M&#150;N, Q&#150;R, Si&#150;St, and U&#150;V, for the <span class="italic">Oxford English Dictionary</span>; an edition of the translation by Nicholas Love of Bonaventure's <span class="italic">Meditationes vitae Christi</span> of <i>c</i>.1410; studies of the <span class="italic">Adventurer</span> of John Hawkesworth; the bibliography of Samuel Johnson, Thomas Percy, Thomas Pennant, and Robert Southwell; contributions to the <span class="italic">Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature</span>, vol. 2 (1940), and the Yale edition of Johnson (1963); and a collaboration with John Munro on the London Shakespeare (1958). His published works are listed in <span class="italic">Johnson, Boswell and their Circle</span> (1965), a Festschrift celebrating his eighty-fourth birthday. Equally important contributions are recorded in the acknowledgements of Johnsonian and Boswellian scholars, who benefited from his advice.<br>
<br>The career of L. F. (as he was generally known) displayed native tenacity. An orphan boy with few material advantages, he was largely self-taught, undeterred by difficulties, ever alert for information, and he kept his memory in full activity. A formidable indexer, he rightly considered his memory superior to card indexes, and drew together disparate source material, references, and recondite information, with effortless skill. For his pupils he resembled Johnson without the danger: cheerfulness was always evident. He was eminently clubbable, loved a <i>bon mot</i> or anecdote, and despised gossip. He defied the doctors of 1914 with energetic pedestrianism, and in his eighties would sometimes trick unwary visitors by suggesting a stroll. He was a shrewd and learned editor, a patient mentor, and a courteous friend; his <span class="italic">Boswell</span> is a lasting memorial.<br>
<br>In 1969 Powell became seriously ill and in February 1970 was moved to the Tracy Nursing Home in Banbury, from where he continued to collect material for a further edition of <span class="italic">The Life of Johnson</span>. He died there, aged ninety-three, on 17 July 1975.<br>
