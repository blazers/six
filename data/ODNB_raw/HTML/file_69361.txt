<span class="headword">Densell,  John</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1536), <span class="occ">serjeant-at-law</span>, was the son of Remfry Densell and his wife, Katherine, daughter of John Skewys. He came of a Cornish family whose name derived from Densell or Denzil in the parish of Mawgan in Pydar. He was admitted to Lincoln's Inn in 1504 at the instance of his maternal grandfather, and was elected a bencher in 1520, four years before his first reading (which was on the <span class="roman">Statute of Westminster II</span> c. 45). His signature appears frequently on bills in chancery during Wolsey's chancellorship, and he also practised in the requests. By 1526 he was counsel to Dartmouth corporation, and in 1530 became a justice of the peace for Cornwall. At an unknown date he married Mary (<i>d</i>. 1540), daughter of Sir William Lucy of Chalvercote.<br>
<br>Densell achieved some fame in the profession by reason of his second reading, given in Lent 1530, on the 1489 <span class="roman">Statute of Fines</span>  (4 Hen. VII c. 24). This circulated very widely over the next century, and at least ten manuscript texts still survive. It was printed in 1662, to accompany Coke's reading on fines, as <span class="italic">Le reading del Monsieur Denshall, sur l'estatute de finibus fait anno 4. H. 7</span>. The year after delivering this reading, on 12 or 13 November 1531, he was chosen to be a serjeant-at-law, and delivered a third reading (on an unknown subject) as serjeant-elect. He did not, however, live long enough to secure a major appointment. He died on 3 January 1536, and in accordance with his instructions was buried in the chancel of St Giles-in-the-Fields, Middlesex.<br>
<br>Family tradition had it that Densell &#145;was no corrupt or griping lawyer, for he made no improvement at all of his estate&#146;  (Holles, 54). He did, nevertheless, add to his Cornish properties an estate at Hendon in Middlesex and a house in St Giles's parish. He appointed his wife as his sole executor, &#145;to whom&#146;, he said, &#145;I commyt all my truste to do for my sowle as hir kynde harte shall thinke meate&#146;. They had two daughters. Anne married Sir William Holles (<i>d</i>. 1591), and their eldest son was named Denzil after her father; their great-grandson was the well-known parliamentarian <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13550/', "Denzil Holles")</script>. Alys married the Cornishman William Reskymer.<br>
