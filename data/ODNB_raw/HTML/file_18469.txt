<span class="headword">Mead,  William</span>  (<em>c.</em>1627&#150;1713), <span class="occ">Quaker patron and merchant</span>, lived in London, where he became a prosperous linen draper and merchant; he was also a member of the Company of Merchant Taylors. He served as captain of a trained band and was a Seeker in religion, joining the presbyterians and Independents among others before finally becoming a Quaker early in 1670. Later that year, on 14 August, he was present at a large and crowded meeting in Gracechurch Street at which William Penn was the chief speaker. Soldiers arrived with orders to break up the meeting, and in order to keep the peace Penn volunteered to give himself up when the meeting had ended. When he did so, Mead accompanied him; both were arrested and committed to Newgate. Accused of unlawful assembly and disturbing the peace Penn and Mead were tried at the Old Bailey, and when the jury found them not guilty the jury were imprisoned by the judge without food or water until they returned a verdict with which he agreed. However, the jury refused to be intimidated, and so the case, and in particular the jury's foreman, Edward Bushell, became famous in legal history. Eventually all parties were released, and a detailed account of the trial under the title <span class="italic">The Peoples Ancient and Just Liberties Asserted</span> was published by Penn and Mead later the same year.<br>
<br>Mead now put his energies and his wealth at the disposal of London Friends and the Quaker leadership. He bought flax which poor Friends were employed to spin and was involved in buying land on which to erect workhouses for the poor. He often advanced money for Friends' projects, although he was careful to claim it back again in due course. He gave hospitality to travelling Friends, and his house was often used as an address to which Friends' letters could be directed. George Fox, who had no permanent home in London, often stayed with him in Fenchurch Street and later in Highgate. Mead was not averse to using his position in London society to advance the Quaker cause and to assure those in power that Quakers were respectable and posed no threat. In 1672 he is quoted as being &#145;confident his Majesty cannot be safe from any of the Dissenters but the Quakers&#146;  (&#145;Present state of the nonconformists&#146;).<br>
<br>Mead was of mature years and a settled and prosperous position when he first married in 1679, but his wife, Mary Lawrence, died the same year, and their son, Jonathan, died in 1680. In 1681 William Mead married Sarah Fell (1643?&#150;1714), the fourth daughter of Margaret Fell, the wife of George Fox. Sarah was confident, capable, and well educated, a prominent member of Quaker women's meetings and the efficient manager of the large household at Swarthmoor Hall. In 1684 William Mead bought an additional country property at Gooses, near Romford in Essex, and in the same year their only son, Nathaniel (<i>d</i>. 1760), was born. Mead was now at the centre of the Quaker leadership in London. His house, his coach, and his business acumen were at the service of his father-in-law, George Fox. He looked after Fox's business papers and his library of more than 300 books, and in time became his literary executor. It was Mead's money that ensured the printing of Fox's <span class="italic">Journal</span> in 1694, but this also gave Mead the power to object to William Penn's preface which, as a result, was printed only in later editions; Mead and Penn had become estranged over politics, Penn appearing to be too much of a friend to James II while Mead remained a staunch whig.<br>
<br>Mead was a man of strong opinions and quick decisions, downright in speech and behaviour. His wealth made it possible for him to help Friends and to keep in contact with London society, but some accused him of a lack of Quaker simplicity, and there may be some grounds for this. William and Sarah's son, Nathaniel, was sent to the Middle Temple at sixteen, a &#145;worldly&#146; employment which caused some unease to his relatives if not to his parents: he prospered, was knighted, and did not remain a Quaker.<br>
<br>William Mead died at his house, Gooses, on 3 April 1713, when he was said to be aged eighty-six, and was buried in the Quaker burial-ground at Barking. His wife, Sarah, died on 9 June 1714 and was buried with him. William's grave is marked by a headstone which, most unusually for a Quaker, describes him as &#145;William Mead Esq.&#146;.<br>
