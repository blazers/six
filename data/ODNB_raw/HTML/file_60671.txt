<span class="headword">Stewart,  Desmond Stirling</span>  (1924&#150;1981), <span class="occ">writer</span>, was born on 20 April 1924 at Colis Farm, Leavesden, Hertfordshire, the first of four children of Roy Mackenzie Stewart (1889&#150;1964), a neurologist, and Agnes Maud Stirling (1900&#150;1994), daughter of Thomas William Stirling, naval officer and pioneer of fruit growing in British Columbia, Canada, and Marie Mabel, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Connolly. Stewart was educated at Haileybury College, where he was a scholar (1938&#150;41), and read classics at Trinity College, Oxford, from 1942 to 1944 and from 1947 to 1948 as a scholar. His BLitt was on Swinburne's <span class="italic">Atalanta in Calydon</span>. A pacifist, he did hospital work during the Second World War.<br>
<br>In autumn 1948 Stewart took up a teaching post at the College of Arts, Baghdad, Iraq. He favoured the Arab cause and was popular with his Iraqi students. His first publication was a lively translation of Plato's <span class="italic">Symposium</span> (1950); then followed three novels set in Iraq, each of which was perceptive and entertaining. Outstanding among the three was <span class="italic">The Unsuitable Englishman</span> (1954), a satire on the British attitude to the Iraqis. In between came <span class="italic">The Memoirs of Alcibiades</span> (1952), a fictional autobiography. In 1956 he co-authored <span class="italic">New Babylon: a Portrait of Iraq</span> with John Haylock, with whom he set up house in Juniyyah, Lebanon, in October 1956. The British embassy in Baghdad was suspicious of his pro-Arab stance and his friendship with Sir Oswald and Lady Mosley, and the contracts of both authors were not renewed because of <span class="italic">New Babylon</span>. Popular with most Iraqis, this candid book infuriated the establishment. From 1955 to 1956 Stewart gave occasional English lessons to Lieutenant-Colonel Abdul-Karim Kassin, who, in July 1958, overthrew the monarchy and formed a republic.<br>
<br>In 1958 Stewart wrote <span class="italic">Turmoil in Beirut</span> and moved to Cairo, a city he loved, and about which he wrote <span class="italic">Cairo</span> (1965) and <span class="italic">Great Cairo</span> (1968). <span class="italic">Boy with a Hoop</span>, his biography of the Lebanese industrialist Emile Bustani, came out in 1967. From this time until his death his output was prolific, his energy remarkable, his scholarship impeccable. He wrote five books on the Arab world and Islam for Time&#150;Life Books, New York, and one (<span class="italic">The Pyramids and the Sphinx</span>, 1971) for Newsweek Book Division. In 1974 he wrote a biography of Theodor Herzl and <span class="italic">The Middle East: Temple of Janus</span> (1971), an exhaustive account of the modern history of that region. He translated two Egyptian novels: <span class="italic">Egyptian Earth</span> by A. R. Sharkawi (1962) and <span class="italic">The Man who Lost his Shadow</span> by Fathy Ghanem (1966). Stewart was an admirer of President Gamal Abdul Nasser, who once granted him a long interview, and he set out the aspirations of the Nasserist revolutionary programme in <span class="italic">Young Egypt</span> (1958). His trilogy <span class="italic">A Sequence of Roles</span> (1965&#150;8), about a Scottish family's connections with Egypt, was poorly received. His biography of T. E. Lawrence (1977) postulated the mythomaniac traits in Lawrence's character.<br>
<br>Stewart was tall, with slate-coloured eyes and fairish brown hair, which he wore short. Francis King always referred to him as &#145;life-enhancing&#146;. Stewart acquired a fluency in Arabic, and studied Islam seriously, but he remained a devout Christian. Amusing, he had a mischievous wit which could be provocative. He was as much at home with an Egyptian paratrooper as he was with Diana Mosley.<br>
<br>In 1967 Stewart bought a house together with his adored widowed mother in the Greek village of Myrtou, in northern Cyprus. When in England he lived in the house at Wells next the Sea, Norfolk, which he had inherited from his paternal uncle. Myrtou's occupation by the Turkish army in 1974 meant that he could only alternate between Egypt and Norfolk. In 1981, while in Cairo, he contracted hepatitis. He was ill for some weeks and died in London at Charing Cross Hospital of liver failure on 12 June 1981. His devoted Egyptian friend Hassan Haggag was at his deathbed along with his mother. Stewart was unmarried. He was buried in the churchyard of St Nicholas at Wells next the Sea. His two posthumous books, <span class="italic">The Foreigner</span> (1981), a life of Christ, and <span class="italic">The Palestinians</span> (1982), were both edited by Alan Neame, poet and writer, an Oxford contemporary of Stewart's and lifelong friend.<br>
