<span class="headword">McWilliam,  Frederick Edward</span>  (1909&#150;1992), <span class="occ">sculptor</span>, was born on 30 April 1909 in Newry Street, Banbridge, co. Down, the son of William Nicholson McWilliam, medical practitioner, and his wife, Elizabeth Esther, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Rounds. An exile for most of his life, McWilliam cherished memories of his childhood in a small country town where craftsmen still pursued their traditional skills&#151;his own work was splendidly imbued with craftsman-like qualities&#151;but he also carried darker memories of Ireland in the 1920s, as it moved towards partition in an atmosphere of bigotry and intolerance. He was educated at Campbell College, Belfast, and at Belfast College of Art (1926&#150;8). He continued his studies, at first intending to become a painter, at the Slade School of Fine Art, London (1928&#150;31). Influenced by a member of the teaching staff, A. H. Gerrard (later Slade professor of sculpture), and by Henry Moore, whom he met for the first time in his second year&#151;both of these men became his lasting friends&#151;McWilliam emerged from the Slade committed to sculpture. After being awarded the Robert Ross leaving scholarship, he went straight to Paris to work: &#145;It was the mecca &hellip; holy ground, full of the memory of C&eacute;zanne, and the presence of Picasso&#146;, he said later  (Flanagan and Marle, 22). His visit coincided with the slump, his money soon dwindled, and he returned to London.<br>
<br>On 31 March 1932 at St John's Presbyterian Church, Kensington, McWilliam married the painter Elizabeth Marion (Beth) Crowther (1909/10&#150;1988), whom he had met at the Slade. She was the daughter of Ramsden Crowther, a mill owner from Golcar, near Huddersfield. They had two daughters. Their first home&#151;at Chartridge, Buckinghamshire&#151;was a rented cottage which they shared with Henry Moore. There McWilliam began in earnest to carve, using cherrywood from the orchards which surrounded the house. His early pieces were semi-abstract, but a visit to the International Surrealist Exhibition at the New Burlington Galleries, London, in 1936 induced a change of direction. In the following year he joined the British surrealist group, and exhibited with them. He had his first one-man exhibition, of sculpture and drawings, at the London Gallery, Cork Street, London, in March 1939.<br>
<br>The outbreak of the Second World War interrupted this steady progress. For six years, while serving in the RAF (in England and then, from 1944 to 1946, in India), McWilliam produced very little. As soon as conditions allowed, he returned to his work in wood, stone, clay, bronze, and concrete. In addition, he was invited in 1947 by A. H. Gerrard to teach sculpture at the Slade, a post which he occupied until 1968.<br>
<br>McWilliam tended to work in series, exploring a theme in a succession of variations, rather as a composer might do. Characteristic of his sculpture produced just before and soon after the war was his exploration of &#145;the complete fragment&#146;, the part standing for the whole, in works which are aptly described by their titles: <span class="italic">Mandible</span> (1938), <span class="italic">Eye, Nose and Cheek</span> (1939; Tate collection), <span class="italic">Profile</span> (1939&#150;40), and the extraordinary <span class="italic">Head in Extended Order</span> (1948), in which the components of a face&#151;lips, eyeballs, nose, and ear&#151;are laid in a row like excavated fragments of classical antiquity. His later <span class="italic">Legs</span> series (1977&#150;81) was a more playful excursion into the same territory. Another surreal device much favoured by McWilliam might be called &#145;the missing torso&#146;. In <span class="italic">Man and Wife</span> (1948), <span class="italic">Father and Daughter</span> (1949), and <span class="italic">The Matriarch</span> (1952), to name but a few pieces, limbs tenderly and convincingly, in defiance of common sense, surround an empty space. Henry Moore's riven sculptures of the same period became more famous but McWilliam's work had a lightness and grace which were all his own.<br>
<br>In 1949 McWilliam was elected to the London group (he resigned in 1963); and in the following year he and his wife, Beth, made what proved to be their final move, to a house and studio in Holland Park, London. The house had a large, tree-lined garden, lovingly tended by Beth, where they entertained their many friends and where, according to the artist and collector Roland Penrose, &#145;his sculptures, placed appropriately on mounds among trees, seem to join the conversation&#146;  (<span class="italic">Women of Belfast</span>, introductory note).<br>
<br>In 1951 McWilliam was commissioned to create a large figurative work, <span class="italic">The Four Seasons</span>, for the country pavilion at the Festival of Britain; many public commissions followed throughout the 1950s and 1960s. Probably the most important was his monumental <span class="italic">Princess Macha</span> (1957) for the Altnagelvin Hospital in Derry, a tall elegant figure which marked the beginning of his re-engagement with his Irish past. He also undertook a number of &#145;straightforward&#146; portrait commissions, including a fine bronze of his friend and fellow Ulsterman the painter William Scott (1956).<br>
<br>The Irish present&#151;or one brutal aspect of it&#151;announced itself with the commencement of the troubles in 1969. On 4 March 1972 a bomb exploded without warning among the diners at the Abercorn Tea-rooms in Belfast. Two women were killed, two more lost both legs, and a total of 130 people were injured. McWilliam, who never before had used his sculpture for direct comment, was moved by this dire event to create a series of small bronzes, known collectively as <span class="italic">Women of Belfast</span> (1972&#150;3; Arts Council of Northern Ireland Collection, no. 5). These suffering figures, whirled about, tumbled, and harried by the bomb blast, their faces contorted, their clothing agitated, have undeniable power. Though connected to the Northern Ireland conflict, they had a wider significance: they were emblems of innocence violated in a violent century.<br>
<br>McWilliam received an honorary DLitt from Queen's University, Belfast, in 1964. He was appointed CBE in 1966, and in 1971 he won a gold medal for sculpture at the Oireachtas Exhibition in Dublin. He was briefly an associate of the Royal Academy: he was elected in 1959, but resigned in 1963 in protest at the hanging committee's rejection of a painting by William Gear. A comprehensive photographic survey of his work, by Roland Penrose, was published in 1964. A large retrospective in 1981&#151;held first at the Ulster Museum, Belfast, before travelling to Dublin and Cork&#151;showed how various and inventive his contribution had been. He continued to carve with verve until almost the end of his life; and a second retrospective, at the Tate in 1989, included examples from his latest series, the fantastic <span class="italic">Mulberry Figures</span>, carved from a gnarled mulberry tree growing in his garden, which the great storm of 1987 had uprooted. He died of cancer at 12 Pembroke Square, Kensington, London, on 13 May 1992. He was survived by his two daughters, his wife having predeceased him.<br>
