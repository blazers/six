<span class="headword">Clark,  Alice</span>  (1874&#150;1934), <span class="occ">campaigner for women's rights</span>, was born on 1 August 1874, at Green Bank, Street, Somerset, the fourth of the six children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/46819/', "William Stephens Clark (1839&#150;1925)")</script>, shoe manufacturer and social reformer, and Helen Priestman Bright (1840&#150;1927), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/3421/', "John Bright (1811&#150;1889)")</script> of Rochdale, politician. Her family's wealth derived from the shoemaking enterprise, C. and J. Clark Ltd, in Street. Alice Clark was a birthright member of the Society of Friends, counting some noted Quaker women ministers among her forebears. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/38518/', "Hilda Clark (1881&#150;1955)")</script> was her sister.<br>
<br>Most of her education was undertaken at home, but in May 1891 Alice Clark began a period of formal schooling at Brighthelmston, Southport, a school founded by Hannah Wallis, also a Quaker. She completed her studies there in December 1892, having passed the Cambridge matriculation examinations. Unlike her three sisters, however, she did not then continue her formal education at university or college. Instead, she chose to enter the family firm to pioneer a new career for women. She began an informal apprenticeship in 1893, learning each of the various processes of shoe manufacture and selling.<br>
<br>Alice Clark's family circle included a number of women who had taken a leading part in the formation of an organized movement for women's rights in the 1860s, including her mother, and her great-aunts, Priscilla Bright McLaren, Margaret Tanner, and Mary and Anna Maria Priestman. She followed their example, working continuously on behalf of women's rights from early adulthood. From the 1890s she campaigned on behalf of women's suffrage as a member of the Women's Liberal Federation, helping form a branch in her locality. Temperance was another cause which she pursued during these years, alongside adult education.<br>
<br>Ill health first interrupted Alice Clark's business career in 1897. After a period in a Black Forest sanatorium, she returned to work in the Clark factory, supervising several of the manufacturing processes, and managing the home order office and correspondence with customers. In 1904, when the firm became a limited company, she was appointed one of the original five life directors of C. and J. Clark Ltd. In 1909 she again became seriously ill and tuberculosis of the throat and lungs was diagnosed. The prognosis was not hopeful, but she made what was considered a striking recovery. The period of convalescence, however, was prolonged and only completed in 1912.<br>
<br>This crisis was followed by a change of direction, and Alice Clark withdrew from an active role in the family firm for some years. Her illness had coincided with ever more violent confrontations between the authorities and militant women's suffragists, a development she viewed with some anguish. In 1907 Alice Clark had herself taken up a non-violent form of militancy when she attempted to resist the payment of taxes. Now she increasingly lent her support to the constitutional National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies, a branch of which was formed in Street in 1910. Following her recovery, she sought a more active role in its campaigns and made herself a new home in London. There she rapidly moved into the leadership of the National Union, joining its executive committee in 1913. She also became its assistant parliamentary secretary at a critical time, as the National Union pursued a working alliance with the Labour Party with the aim of pressuring the Liberal government to enact votes for women.<br>
<br>In 1914 Alice Clark was awarded the Charlotte Shaw fellowship at the London School of Economics. Her research, undertaken with direction from Dr Lilian Knowles, was published as <span class="italic">The Working Life of Women in the Seventeenth Century</span> (1919). This was among the earliest studies in the field, and underwent several reprintings. It represents the foremost of those &#145;pessimistic&#146; accounts which argue that the advent of capitalism undermined the economic and social position of women. Some of its findings have been confirmed by subsequent research. Others have been thrown into question, perhaps most notably the periodization which Alice Clark applied to the process of industrialization, and her tendency to see the position of women in the seventeenth century in too rosy terms. None the less, her study constitutes one of the most comprehensive surveys available on this topic.<br>
<br>During the First World War Alice Clark took a prominent part in the work of the Friends' War Victims Relief Committee, notably in aid to refugees in France, and in the organization of post-war famine relief in Austria. 1922 saw her return at last to full-time work at the Clark factory. In this last period of her working life she became an innovator in marketing, in staff training, and in personnel management, and continued to promote technical and adult education in Street. During her final years Alice Clark left the Society of Friends, turning instead to the doctrines of Christian Science. She died on 11 May 1934, at Millfield, her home, in Street; her remains were cremated at Arnos Vale, Bristol.<br>
