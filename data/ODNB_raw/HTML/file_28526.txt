</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Wall,  Joseph</span>  (1737&#150;1802), <span class="occ">army officer and murderer</span>, was born in Dublin, the eldest son of Gereld or Garrett Wall, a well-to-do tenant farmer on the estate of Sir John Denny Vesey, second baronet, near Abbeyleix in Queen's county. Details of his early life are sparse. His family were Roman Catholic but he and his brothers converted to protestantism. Most accounts state that at the age of fifteen he attended Trinity College, Dublin, where he studied and mastered classical languages, but he is not recorded in college lists, nor did he take a degree.<br>
<br>It is said that about 1760 Wall volunteered for military service as a cadet, with his younger brother Augustine (<i>d</i>. 1780), later a barrister and the first Irish law reporter to include names of speakers in his accounts. He served with distinction at the siege of Havana in 1762, returning home with the rank of captain. Lieutenant Charles Forbes of the 1st Royal Scots regiment referred to Wall's brave conduct at the siege when testifying at his trial forty years later. However, the army lists record no regimental commission, leaving the possibility of a brevet field promotion. Upon his return Wall obtained an appointment with the East India Company at Bombay, but he left this service after a few years following a duel. Although a tall man of &#145;genteel appearance&#146;  (<span class="italic">Life</span>, 40), he &#145;lacked proper balance and suffered from a very short temper&#146;  (Gray, 248). He returned to Ireland to look for a rich heiress, but he courted a Miss Gregory, whom he met at an inn near his father's tenancy, &#145;in a style so coercive&#146; that she prosecuted him for assault and defamation and &#145;succeeded in his conviction and penal chastisement&#146;  (<span class="italic">Life</span>, 4).<br>
<br>Wall moved to England and spent his time in gaming and amorous intrigues in London and the spa towns. To relieve his debts, in 1773 he procured a captaincy in what was to become the African corps, consisting of three independent companies of foot stationed at St Louis on the River Senegal for the defence of the recently created province of Senegambia. The governor, Charles O'Hara, placed great confidence in Wall, and he was left as senior military officer when O'Hara left Senegambia in 1776.<br>
<br>Ensign Matthias Macnamara, lieutenant-governor of the Gambia, &#145;a man without education, extremely brutal, vulgar and avaricious&#146;  (Gray, 244), then returned to St Louis as acting governor and quickly removed his principal rival by appointing Wall lieutenant-governor of the Gambia in his stead. This was more a punishment than a promotion. The post at James Island was regarded as little more than a penal colony and its troops were of the poorest quality. Wall treated his position as an independent command, ignoring Macnamara's orders, and relations between the two quickly deteriorated. When rumours reached St Louis that Wall was acting in an arbitrary manner towards his subordinates, an investigation by the governor and council of Senegal was convened. Despite much conflicting evidence and signs of perjury and bias among the witnesses, the investigation showed the charges had substance.<br>
<br>Wall, by now a sick man, continued to ignore Macnamara's orders. Matters were brought to a head when on 8 August 1776 he returned to St Louis and confronted Macnamara. He was placed under arrest for quitting his post without orders, and sent back to James Island, where he was kept in close confinement for ten months. No effort was made to bring him to trial, and Wall's health deteriorated further. In the meantime news of Macnamara's maladministration and cruel treatment of local people had reached Britain, and Captain John Clarke was appointed permanent governor; he arrived at St Louis on 8 April 1777. Wall's case was brought before the council in June, when the sickly Wall conducted his own defence. Macnamara's charges of disobedience, mistreatment of subordinates, and private trading were proved to be grossly embellished and were dismissed. Released from prison, Wall commenced several actions against Macnamara for damages over the removal of goods and false imprisonment. The council in Senegal awarded him &pound;1527 for the former. On 28 May 1778 Wall replaced Macnamara as lieutenant-governor of Senegambia. The following year he brought a further civil action against Macnamara in London at the court of common pleas, which decided that, while his arrest might have been at first legal on the grounds that he left his post without orders, his subsequent imprisonment was malicious, and it awarded him &pound;1000.<br>
<br>Governor Clarke had died on 18 August 1778, and in Wall's absence the British administration in Senegambia surrendered to the attacking French fleet on 11 February 1779. Wall returned with a contingent of the African corps in a naval squadron under Sir Edward Hughes to occupy the island of Goree, which could be used to control the mouth of the River Gambia but which the French had left undefended. Leaving a small force to rebuild and garrison the dismantled forts, Wall, as acting governor of Goree, proceeded with four men-of-war to the Gambia. He reached James Island on 31 May, but the fort was found to be in a dilapidated state, beyond repair. Wall then sailed with the squadron to Barbados, returning to Goree in 1780. His younger brother Ensign Patrick Wall accompanied him to Goree, but died shortly after their arrival, allegedly from the shock of watching a man named Paterson flogged to death on board ship by order of his brother. Under Wall's protection, British merchants began trading on the Gambia River again, and a series of settlements were built along the river bank. However, after he had been governor and superintendent of trade for two years Wall's health gave way, and he prepared to leave the colony.<br>
<br>On 10 July 1782 a deputation of the African corps, who had been on short allowance, waited on him to ask for a settlement. Wall caused their leader, Sergeant Benjamin Armstrong, and two others to be arrested on a charge of mutiny. Without holding a court martial he ordered Armstrong and the others to be flogged with a knotted rope by black slaves, which was contrary to military practice. Armstrong and the others received 800 lashes. Wall left Goree the next day. Armstrong and the other men died of their wounds several days later. In England, Wall made no mention of a mutiny in his official report, but rumours began to circulate of the tyrannical and arbitrary nature of his governorship. Charges were laid against him by Captain Roberts, one of his officers. Wall was brought before a court martial, but the charges were allowed to drop as the ship in which the witnesses were returning was believed to be lost. Wall then retired to Bath. In October 1784, following the arrival of the witnesses, he was arrested and charged with murder by two king's messengers. They began to escort him to London, but Wall escaped at Reading, walking &#145;60 miles across country before he took a carriage, when he proceeded to Scotland, and there remained until a favourable occasion offered for his passage to the continent&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 1 Feb 1802). There he met Frances, the sixth daughter of Kenneth Mackenzie, styled Lord Fortrose (<i>d</i>. 1761), whom he married.<br>
<br>For many years the couple lived in France and Italy, where they were admitted into society. Wall made several secret visits to Britain, and in 1797 both he and his wife returned to London, living under the assumed name of Thompson, at a house in Upper Thornhaugh Street, Bedford Square. Wall had returned to surrender himself for trial but lacked resolve, and it was not until 25 October 1801 that he wrote to Thomas Pelham, home secretary, about this intention. He was arrested soon after.<br>
<br>Wall's motive was primarily financial. A large property belonging to his wife was in the hands of trustees, which he had frequently applied for, &#145;but they, knowing the circumstances in which he was placed, and that he could not legally sue them for it, without exposing himself to the dangers of a criminal prosecution, consistently resisted his applications for money&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 1 Feb 1802). To free himself of this difficulty Wall had to clear his name. The death of Captain Roberts in Ireland some ten years before and the &#145;supposed dissolution or dispersion of the other principal witnesses taught him to rely with perfect security in his surrendering himself for trial&#146;  (<span class="italic">Life</span>, 6). He was tried for the murder of Armstrong on 20 January 1802 at the Old Bailey by a special commission, presided over by Sir Archibald Macdonald, chief baron of the exchequer. The chief evidence for the prosecution was given by the surgeon, Mr Ferrit, and the orderly sergeant who were on duty during Armstrong's punishment. The evidence was not shaken on any point and the charge of mutiny was not sustained. The absence of a court martial, and of any record of a mutiny in the garrison records or in Wall's official report upon his return, proved telling. The trial lasted from 9 a.m. until 11 o'clock at night and resulted in a verdict of guilty. Efforts were made by a relative of his wife's, Charles Howard, eleventh duke of Norfolk, to obtain a pardon for Wall. The privy council held several deliberations on the case, but it had become a subject of great public interest and popular indignation, and a pardon was politically inexpedient. It would have been unwise to spare the life of an officer condemned for brutality to his soldiers when at the same time sailors were being executed at Spithead for mutiny against their officers.<br>
<br>After two respites, on 28 January 1802, at 8 o'clock, Wall emerged from his cell at Newgate, to the hostile cheers of an immense crowd. &#145;He did not remain above two minutes on the scaffold before the platform dropped, but owing to the rope slipping a little &hellip; he was a considerable time in dying, during which time he appeared to be much convulsed&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 29 Jan 1802). Following the execution the body was only formally dissected and not exposed to public view. Upon payment of 50 guineas to the Philanthropic Society by his family his remains were handed over and buried in St Pancras churchyard.<br>
<br>The execution was at the time considered a triumph of justice&#151;the administration of the criminal law making no distinction between the classes&#151;but the poet Robert Southey pointed out:<blockquote>Nobody seems to recollect that he has been hanged, not for having flogged three men to death, but for the informality in the mode of doing it &hellip; The martial laws of England are the most barbarous which at this day exist in Europe. (Southey, 3.109)</blockquote>Wall was survived by his wife and a son aged about nine at the time of his death. She was at Harrogate in September 1821 at the same time as the poet James Montgomery, who, observing her solitary walks, &#145;recollected how faithfully she clung to her husband through the period of his desertion, disgrace and suffering&#146;  (Holland and Everett, 3.253). Her example suggested the theme of a poem he then commenced on &#145;Woman&#146;, later published as &#145;Tale without a Name&#146;.<br>
