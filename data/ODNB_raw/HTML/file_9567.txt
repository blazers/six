<span class="headword">FitzGerald,  James Edward</span>  (1818&#150;1896), <span class="occ">politician and civil servant in New Zealand</span>, was born on 4 March 1818 in Bath, Somerset, the fifth and youngest son of Gerald FitzGerald of Kilminchy, Queen's county, Ireland, and his second wife, Catherine (<i>d</i>. 1819), the daughter of the Rt Hon. Sir Lucius O'Brien, bt. He was educated in Bath and at Christ's College, Cambridge, where he matriculated in 1837 and graduated BA in 1842. In 1844 he entered the department of antiquities in the British Museum and in 1848 became under-secretary of the museum. During the Irish famine of 1846 he became interested in colonization, and was the first secretary of the Colonial Reform Society in 1850. He worked with Edward Gibbon Wakefield and John Robert Godley, who were then organizing the Church of England colony by which Canterbury in the South Island of New Zealand was settled. On 22 July 1850 he married, at St George's, Bloomsbury, London, Frances (Fanny) Erskine (<i>d</i>. 1900), the daughter of George Draper of London. Shortly afterwards the couple sailed for Lyttelton aboard the <i>Charlotte Jane</i>.<br>
<br>Having reached New Zealand on 16 December 1850, FitzGerald combined with humour and energy the various duties of founding editor of the settlement's first newspaper, the <span class="italic">Lyttelton Times</span>, sub-inspector of police (1851&#150;January 1863), and immigration agent. Active in promoting responsible government, he was elected in 1853 first superintendent of the province of Canterbury and also member for Lyttelton in the first New Zealand general assembly. When parliament met in 1854, on the invitation of the acting governor, Wynyard, FitzGerald, together with Henry Sewell and Sir Frederick Aloysius Weld, formed a ministry. His cabinet was a hybrid body consisting of elected members of the new legislature and old permanent officials, appointed under royal warrant, who had administered affairs while New Zealand had been a crown colony. This singular arrangement broke down after seven weeks. FitzGerald resigned, and responsible government was virtually postponed for two years, by which time he was too ill with heart disease to participate.<br>
<br>Meanwhile FitzGerald, as superintendent of Canterbury, was active there in promoting the Wakefield land system, under which the public lands were for many years sold without restriction of area to all purchasers able to pay &pound;2 an acre in cash for them. He was also an advocate of national as opposed to clerical school teaching. From 1857 to 1859 he was in England as immigration agent for Canterbury, and on his return, in recognition of his work, he was given the Springs station, west of Christchurch, which he ran as a cattle and dairy farm with only modest success. In 1861 he founded <span class="italic">The Press</span> newspaper, of which he was editor, and after a short time sole proprietor (to 1867). He was a lucid, vigorous, and at times brilliant writer, and though journalism yielded him no financial profit <span class="italic">The Press</span> quickly became one of the colony's leading newspapers.<br>
<br>In 1862 FitzGerald re-entered parliament, there honourably to distinguish himself by his eloquent pleading for the right of the Maori to special representation in both houses&#151;a privilege which was granted, though not until after his retirement. For a few weeks in 1865 he was native minister under Sir Frederick Weld, but in January 1867 he retired from politics to join the civil service at Wellington, in which the last thirty years of his life were spent. At first comptroller of the public accounts, he was made commissioner of audit in 1872 and controller and auditor-general in 1878, and was throughout a diligent public servant. He was a prominent pamphleteer and literary reviewer, and an attractive public speaker who displayed wit, dash, and emotional power. Able, cultivated, and high-minded, FitzGerald needed only more prudence, patience, and tenacity to have left a much deeper mark on the history of New Zealand, and to have been one of the most prominent men of the day. A contemporary biographer, William Gisborne, described him in 1886 as &#145;a brilliant failure&#146;. FitzGerald died in Wellington on 2 August 1896 and was buried at the city's Bolton Street cemetery. He was survived by his wife and by four sons and three daughters of their thirteen children.<br>
