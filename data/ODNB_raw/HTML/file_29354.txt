<span class="headword">Widdowes,  Giles</span>  (1588/9&#150;1645), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, the elder son of Thomas Widdowes of Mickleton, Gloucestershire, entered Oriel College, Oxford, probably in 1603 or 1604. He graduated BA on 25 February 1608, proceeded MA on 27 January 1614, and was elected fellow of Oriel on 19 July 1610 by recommendation of William Barlow, who as the bishop of Lincoln was the official college visitor and who overruled objections. In 1614, through the support of Endymion Porter, whose father held land at Mickleton, Widdowes almost obtained from the king Walgrave rectory in Northamptonshire, but it went to John Williams, Lord Chancellor Ellesmere's chaplain. After supporting in 1618 the election as provost of Oriel of William Lewis, chaplain to Lord Chancellor Bacon, Widdowes became college dean in 1619/20. However, when in 1621 Bacon fell from the chancellorship, Provost Lewis, beleaguered by scandal, departed, and John Williams, newly installed as lord keeper, in his role as bishop of Lincoln became the visitor of Oriel. On 14 December Widdowes resigned his fellowship and moved to Gloucester Hall, where he was vice-principal for a time.<br>
<br>In 1619 Widdowes had obtained the rectory of St Martin's at Carfax, Oxford. Here he gradually introduced fuller prayer book worship at his church, Thomas Crosfield noting on 1 January 1628, &#145;The custome of Common prayer morning &amp; Evening begun at Carfax&#146;  (<span class="italic">Diary</span>, 17). It was later claimed that Widdowes had placed a crucifix in a window. He was an antisabbatarian and danced at Whitsun ales.<br>
<br>Widdowes produced poems for university volumes commemorative of royal occasions. In 1630 he printed a sermon preached at Witney &#145;concerning the lawfulness of Church-authority, for ordaining and commanding of Rites and Ceremonies to beautifie the Church&#146;, entitled <span class="italic">The Schysmatical Puritan</span>, which he dedicated to Katherine, duchess of Buckingham, as her &#145;most humble servant and Chaplaine&#146;. It was &#145;much displeasing to Dr. Abbot archb. of Canterbury&#146;  (Wood, 3.179). William Prynne, whom Wood suggests Widdowes had tutored at Oriel, responded in the 1630 edition of his <span class="italic">Anti-Arminianism</span>. In 1631 Widdowes reprinted <span class="italic">The Schismatical Puritan</span> and replied to Prynne in <span class="italic">The Lawlesse Kneelesse Schismaticall Puritan</span>, dedicated to Porter. Prynne countered later that year with <span class="italic">Lame Giles his Haultings</span>. Wood suggested Widdowes &#145;was fitted as 'twere on purpose to duel with Prynne (as Don Quixot with the wind-mill which no man else was knight errant enough to encounter)&#146;  (Wood, 3.855).<br>
<br>Although Widdowes's anti-puritan stance was sufficiently pronounced to provoke disturbances at St Martin's by puritanical scholars of Lincoln College on 13 December 1637 and by another group on 10 February 1641, he was not successful in gaining further preferment during Laud's time at Canterbury. In 1639 he sought through Porter and the presumed goodwill of Laud the benefice of Islip, Oxfordshire, which was in the gift of the dean and chapter of Westminster. The dean, none other than John Williams, was at that time under suspension, but Islip was given to a fellow of St John's College.<br>
<br>Widdowes was generous to the poor and an energetic pastor towards soldiers during the civil war. He died poor and living in rented accommodation at Oxford, his goods being valued at only &pound;4 17<i>s</i>. 10<i>d</i>. He was buried on 4 February 1645 in the chancel of St Martin's. Wood described him as<blockquote>a harmless and honest man, a noted disputant, well read in the schoolmen, and as conformable to, and zealous in, the established discipline of the church of England, as any person of his time, yet of so odd and strange parts that few or none could be compared with him. (Wood, 3.179)</blockquote>
