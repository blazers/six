<span class="headword">Power,  Jane <span class="st"> [Jennie]</span>  Wyse</span> <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Jane O'Toole]</span>  (1858&#150;1941), <span class="occ">Irish nationalist and feminist</span>, was born in May 1858 in Main Street, Baltinglass, co. Wicklow, the youngest of the seven children, three daughters and four sons, of Edward O'Toole, provision dealer, and his wife, Mary Norton. She grew up in Dublin, where her father set up shop in 1860 in the St Stephen's Green area, and probably attended a local convent school. She was well educated, articulate, and in appearance tall and dark-haired. Her first political involvement was in the Ladies' Land League (1881&#150;2), of which she became a central executive member. While the male leaders were imprisoned from October 1881 to May 1882 the Ladies' Land League, headed by Anna Parnell, sister of Charles Stewart Parnell, ran the land campaign. Anna became estranged from her brother, owing to different interpretations of land league policy, but O'Toole remained devoted to both. On 5 July 1883 she married John Wyse Power (<i>c</i>.1859&#150;1926), journalist and member of the Irish Republican Brotherhood. They had four children, three daughters and a son, none of whom left any children.<br>
<br>In 1893 Jennie Wyse Power and her husband became active members of the Gaelic League. In 1899 she set up a business, the Irish Farm Produce Company, with restaurant attached, at 21 Henry Street, Dublin. The family lived above the business, which became a nationalist meeting-place. A feminist and suffragist, Wyse Power was a member of the Irishwomen's Suffrage and Local Government Association, founded in 1876, and later of the Irish Women's Franchise League, founded in 1908. When eligibility for women as poor-law guardians was achieved in 1896, she was elected as a guardian in Dublin South and served from 1903 to 1911. In 1900 she was a founding member of Inghinidhe na hEireann (Daughters of Ireland), founded to facilitate women's active participation in the male-dominated nationalist movement. Its first president was Maud Gonne. In 1905 she became a founder and executive member of the National Council, from 1908 called Sinn F&eacute;in (&#145;we ourselves&#146;), who were committed to Irish self-reliance and self-government. She took a middle position in debate among feminist-nationalist women as to which took priority. She believed that the demand to include women's suffrage should not be pushed before the <span class="roman">Home Rule Bill</span> was passed, in case it held up the bill's passage, but once passed she was ready to campaign for its inclusion.<br>
<br>Wyse Power became a member, and later president, of Cumann na mBan (League of Women), established in 1914 as an auxiliary to the Irish Volunteers. She was among the Cumann members who shared the belief that the First World War was an opportunity for Irish nationalism. The 1916 proclamation was signed at her house, and she and her family actively supported the 1916 rising. After that date she became an executive member of the new Sinn F&eacute;in, now an umbrella group for nationalists committed to separation from England. When it won the 1918 election and set up its own parliament (D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann) and government, she acted as treasurer of the party and as a judge in the Sinn F&eacute;in courts. She was elected to Dublin corporation in 1920.<br>
<br>One of a minority in Cumann na mBan who accepted the Anglo-Irish treaty of 1921 as a stage towards complete independence and a united Ireland, she resigned and joined the pro-treaty Cumann na nGaedheal Party and became a member of the Seanad (senate) of the Irish Free State. Disillusioned with her party when the boundary commission of 1924 failed to make any change in the partition of Ireland, she resigned in 1925 to become an independent. When Eamonn De Valera's party, Fianna F&aacute;il, came into government in 1932 she liked its policies of economic self-sufficiency and of dismantling aspects of the treaty. She joined it in 1936, and became a Fianna F&aacute;il senator. She remained a consistent supporter of women's rights, opposing policies of both Cumann na nGaedheal and Fianna F&aacute;il governments which restricted women's full citizenship and employment opportunities. When Fianna F&aacute;il abolished the Seanad in 1936 her public political life ended.<br>
<br>John Wyse Power had died in 1926, and in 1929 Jennie sold her business and lived with her daughter Nancy at 15 Earlsfort Terrace, Dublin. She died in Dublin on 5 January 1941 and was buried in Glasnevin cemetery beside her husband and her daughter Maura.<br>
