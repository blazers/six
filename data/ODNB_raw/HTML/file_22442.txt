<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Polding,  John Bede</span>  (1794&#150;1877), <span class="occ">Roman Catholic archbishop of Sydney</span>, was born in Liverpool on 18 November 1794; his father was a German Catholic whose family name had been Anglicized from Polten or Poulten, and his mother, Elizabeth, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Brewer, was of the small community of English recusants. Orphaned by the age of eight he was placed in the hands of the Benedictine community, first with nuns near Liverpool and then at St Gregory's Benedictine College at Acton Burnell, near Shrewsbury, Shropshire. A lively and affectionate boy, his background gave him a European Catholic disposition and outlook, but also a strong consciousness of being English. From childhood his imagination was caught by tales of the convicts of Botany Bay, whom he determined to help.<br>
<br>Polding entered the Benedictine order at Acton Burnell on 15 July 1811, and transferred with them in 1814 to Downside, near Bath, where he was ordained priest on 4 March 1819. There he remained for twenty years, becoming a mainstay of both monastery and school: he had charm, versatility, zeal, a strong interest in individuals, and even a liking for cricket. However, his wish to remedy Australia's spiritual destitution increased: Australia was already, from 1818, a Benedictine responsibility through the vicariate of Mauritius, and, after various difficulties, in 1834 Polding was appointed bishop and vicar apostolic of New Holland and Van Diemen's Land with adjacent islands. He arrived in Sydney on 13 September 1835 with one priest and five students.<br>
<br>New South Wales in 1835 was a penal colony with a population of 71,000, about 40 per cent of whom were convicts; there were more than 20,000 Catholics, with eight priests. Polding responded as a dedicated missionary of prodigious energy, travelling everywhere on horseback throughout his diocese. This redemptive role took him away in mind and time from his pressing duties as bishop, which were to build up the essential structures of a new church growing apace in size and complexity in a rapidly developing society. In this growth Polding faced predictable obstacles from the sheer size and extent of his pioneering responsibilities, and from sectarian anti-Catholicism (even though the government's religious even-handedness worked in Catholicism's favour). But his unique difficulties lay within his own church. His ambition was to make English Benedictine monasticism the form and focus of Australian Catholic life, but Polding had neither the resources nor the personnel to pursue his dream properly. His attempts increasingly led to frustration, friction, failure, and alienation within his own communion, which was overwhelmingly Irish. Irish priests strenuously politicked in Dublin and Rome to wrest control of the church from English Benedictine governance, and they gradually succeeded in limiting Polding's power. Polding was also confronted by lay and clerical rebels at odds with his hierarchical style. Such challenges made his episcopate eventful and tumultuous.<br>
<br>On his arrival in Sydney, Polding faced a hostile Anglicanism, but a government determined on equality of denominational treatment. His first priority was the provision of more priests, and in 1836 he dispatched his vicar-general, William Ullathorne, to recruit them. He himself followed in 1840. Only Irish priests responded to his call, strengthening Irish influence in Australia and effectively thwarting Polding's Benedictine plans, though he refused to face realities which were becoming increasingly obvious to Rome. However, on 5 April 1842 Rome approved the creation of an Australian hierarchy with Polding as metropolitan and archbishop of Sydney, an action which provoked a short-lived sectarian explosion among Sydney's Anglicans.<br>
<br>Polding's long absence (1840&#150;44) allowed dissident elements to entrench themselves within his church. On his return, his authority as metropolitan was called upon to deal with constant internal disputes as far afield as Western Australia. These absorbed vast amounts of his energy and time; for instance, he spent eight months of 1852 in Perth. To assist him in running his own archdiocese, in 1844 he appointed the Benedictine Henry Gregory as vicar-general. It was a disastrous choice. Gregory was devoted to Polding but was an autocrat, bringing all Polding's policies and plans into contention and disrepute. In 1860 he was recalled to England, against Polding's will. Polding's first coadjutor, Henry Davis, appointed in 1848, was an excellent choice, but he died in 1854; his next coadjutor, appointed in 1873 against Irish wishes, was the English Benedictine Roger Bede Vaughan.<br>
<br>Polding's intellectual spirituality was beyond the comprehension of his ordinary priests and people and he was often physically away from them, during long absences from his archdiocese, in Europe, or elsewhere in Australia. This allowed his critics to coalesce against him, particularly through the <span class="italic">Freeman's Journal</span>, their mouthpiece from 1850. Polding increasingly harboured a sense of threat and failure, perhaps symbolized by the destruction by fire on 29 June 1869 of his mother church, St Mary's Cathedral. His enemies included those opposed to his policies and also those critical of his personal shortcomings: he was no administrator or church politician, and an idealist and dreamer rather than a realist. Above all he was defeated (though never abandoning effort or hope) by the sheer enormity of the problems that confronted him&#151;vast, complex, Australia-wide&#151;which were beyond the capacity of any individual to resolve.<br>
<br>On 7 March 1877 Polding, then eighty-two, took to his bed unwell. A procession of public figures called to visit. His long silver hair trailing to his shoulders, his longevity, and above all his personal sanctity and total devotion to the service of religion had made him a legend in life. He died on 16 March 1877 at the Sacred Heart presbytery, Darlinghurst, Sydney, and was buried at Petersham cemetery. He was reinterred in the rebuilt St Mary's Cathedral on 17 March 1901.<br>
