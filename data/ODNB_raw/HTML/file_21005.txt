<span class="headword">Owen,  Hugh</span> <span class="st"> [<em>alias </em>John Hughes]</span>  (1615&#150;1686), <span class="occ">Jesuit</span>, was born in Bodeon in Anglesey in June 1615, the son of Hugh Owen (<i>c</i>.1575&#150;1642) of Gwernynog, Llanfflewyn, in Anglesey, and his wife, Elizabeth, daughter of Thomas Bulkeley of Groesfechan. He was educated in the Brecknockshire&#150;Monmouthshire area, and converted to Catholicism at the age of eleven, in 1626. He later studied humanities at the college at St Omer before being admitted a student at the English College, Rome, on 25 December 1636. On 16 March 1641 he was ordained a priest in the church of St John Lateran, left Rome on 28 September 1643, and laboured as a secular priest in Wales for five years. In 1648 he entered the Society of Jesus at Watten, and returned to the mission in south Wales in 1650. In 1655 he was recorded by the society as serving in the college of St Francis Xavier at Cwm, parish of Llanrothal, Herefordshire, a district which covered north and south Wales, Herefordshire, Gloucestershire, and Somerset.<br>
<br>In 1666 responsibility for north Wales was devolved to the residence of St Winifred, based on Holywell in Flintshire, and Owen was subsequently stationed there. Holywell was the location of a secular mission known as the &#145;Cross Keys&#146; and a Jesuit mission called &#145;The Star&#146;, of which he was in charge. The adoption of these veiled place names enabled priests to attend to the needs of pilgrims who visited St Winifred's Well and offered them protection during periods of acute persecution. Holywell had been a great pilgrimage centre from the fifteenth century despite protestant attempts to &#145;de-Christianize&#146; such places. &#145;For Catholics and Protestants alike, Holywell retained an extraordinary attraction, and from the accounts of cures there it appeared to retain its extraordinary powers&#146;. The Jesuits had an enormous part in affording continuity to the small Catholic community around Holywell from the establishment of the residence there in 1670. Their presence and the tradition of miraculous cures helped it flourish as &#145;a centre of Catholic devotion in an area otherwise barren of Catholicism&#146;  (Champ, 154&#150;5, 156).<br>
<br>Owen is said to have been the author of a report, in Welsh, dated 6 July 1668, of the miraculous cure of Roger Whetstone, a lame and aged Quaker from Bromsgrove, who drank the water at St Winifred's Well and may well have been given protection by the priest. Owen is also recorded as the author of <span class="italic">Maint pechod marwol</span> (1668) on the grievousness of mortal sin, especially heresy, apparently incorporated in his <span class="italic">Allwdd neu agoriad paradwys i'r Cymry</span>, published at Li&egrave;ge in 1670, and perhaps drawing on a book of prayers in English, the <span class="italic">Key to Heaven</span>. He also edited a translation of Thomas &agrave; Kempis into Welsh undertaken by his father, also a convert, published in 1684 as <span class="italic">Dilyniad Christ, a elwir yn Gyffredin Thomas a Kempis</span>, and of a catechism in Welsh. There is no evidence to suggest that the Popish Plot of 1679 ever endangered his life, although his alias of John Hughes may well have allowed him to avoid such suffering. He died at The Star on 28 December 1686 and is said to have had &#145;a great character for sanctity&#146;  (Gillow, <span class="italic">Lit. biog. hist.</span>, 2.223).<br>
