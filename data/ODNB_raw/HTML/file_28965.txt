<span class="headword">Wedgwood,  Hensleigh</span>  (1803&#150;1891), <span class="occ">philologist</span>, was born on 22 January 1803 at Gunville, Dorset, the fourth and youngest son of Josiah Wedgwood of Maer Hall, Staffordshire, and Elizabeth Allen of Cresselly, Pembrokeshire. He was also the grandson of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28966/', "Josiah Wedgwood (1730&#150;1795)")</script>, master potter. Hensleigh Wedgwood was educated at Rugby School. He matriculated from St John's College, Cambridge, and graduated from Christ's College BA in 1824 and MA in 1828. He took a high mathematical degree (1824), and in the classical tripos, initiated the same year, he came last, giving rise to the title &#145;the wooden wedge&#146; by which the classical equivalent of the mathematical wooden spoon continued to be known for sixty years. After leaving Cambridge he read for the chancery bar, and qualified as a barrister in 1828, but never practised. He was a fellow of Christ's College from 1829 to 1830. On 10 January 1832 he married Frances Emma, the daughter of Sir James Mackintosh; they had six children, the eldest of whom was the writer <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/52808/', "(Frances) Julia Wedgwood")</script>.<br>
<br>In 1831 Wedgwood was appointed police magistrate at Union Hall, Southwark. This led to the most characteristic action of his life. In 1837, having become convinced that the administration of oaths was inconsistent with the commands of the <span class="roman">New Testament</span>, he resigned his office, in spite of the protests of his friends. He stated his decision to his father in the memorable words:<blockquote>I think it very possible that it may be lawful for a man to take a judicial oath, but I feel that it is not lawful for me, and there is no use in letting &pound;800 a year persuade one's conscience.</blockquote>In 1838 the loss of income was partially recovered by his appointment to the post of registrar of metropolitan carriages, which he held until its abolition in 1849.Wedgwood's career as a scholar began with two small, interesting treatises, <span class="italic">The Principles of Geometrical Demonstration</span> (1844) and <span class="italic">On the Development of the Understanding</span> (1848); the keen interest in psychology that inspired them was the decisive factor in his pursuance of the philological studies by which he first became well known. One of the original members of the Philological Society (founded 18 May 1842), in 1857 he published his <span class="italic">Dictionary of English Etymology</span>, a work far in advance of all its predecessors, displaying an extraordinary command of linguistic material and considerable insight, but marred by imperfect acquaintance with recent discoveries in philology. Much attention, and initial criticism, was excited by the elaborate introduction, in which he energetically combated the theory, then recently advanced by Professor Max M&uuml;ller, that language originated in a series of ultimate and irresoluble roots, spontaneously created by primitive man as expressions for his ultimate and irresoluble ideas. Wedgwood himself regarded language as the elaborated imitation of natural sounds, but onomatopoeia proved to be too limited and subjective a notion to provide the complete explanation he sought, despite his ingenious arguments and illustrations. Two years later his theory was placed in a new context by the publication of <span class="italic">The Origin of Species</span> by his cousin Charles Darwin. When in 1881 Professor Skeat completed his <span class="italic">Etymological Dictionary</span>, Wedgwood was among its ablest critics; his <span class="italic">Contested Etymologies</span> (1882) deservedly exercised a considerable and mainly beneficial effect upon the dictionary's second edition.<br>
<br>In his last years Wedgwood became a confirmed spiritualist and contributed to the periodical <span class="italic">Light</span>. Personally he was a man of extreme modesty. His reputation came unsought, and he lived to welcome the final triumph of the movement for the remission of the compulsory oath, a movement in which his own early efforts were forgotten. He died on 2 June 1891 at his house at 94 Gower Street, London.<br>
