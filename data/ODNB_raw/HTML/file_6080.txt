<span class="headword">Conn C&eacute;tchathach</span>  (<em>supp. </em><em>d.</em> 157), <span class="occ">legendary high-king of Ireland</span>, flourished, if he existed at all, many generations before the beginning of documentation in medieval Ireland, and he therefore cannot be dated with any hope of accuracy. The genealogies show him as one of seven sons of Feidlimid Rechtaid, king of Tara (the title of the high-kings of Ireland), and his mother was said anachronistically to be the daughter of the king of Scandinavia. He was claimed as ancestor by three prominent peoples in the northern half of Ireland: the Connachta (whence the name of the later province of Connacht), the Airgialla of Ulster, and the U&iacute; N&eacute;ill, the most powerful dynasty in Ireland between the sixth and tenth centuries. It is not surprising that when medieval scholars began to think of Ireland in terms of a division between north and south, they called the former &#145;Conn's Half&#146;. The notion of this dichotomy seems to reflect the politics of the eighth century. One tale explains it thus: &Eacute;ogan M&oacute;r (otherwise Mug Nuadat, supposed ancestor of the &Eacute;oganachta dynasties of southern Ireland) seized the province of Munster from the three kings who had formerly held it. One of the dispossessed kings was given troops by Conn, but was defeated. Conn himself then fought with &Eacute;ogan, but was defeated in ten battles. The result was the division of Ireland from Galway Bay to Dublin Bay.<br>
<br>Conn was said to have been born at Tara, a site with pagan associations, the symbolic seat of those who claimed the kingship of Ireland in the middle ages. At his birth three great rivers sprang up, and three lakes (Lough Neagh, Lough Rea, and Lough Leane), and three famous trees. This may be connected with the concept that the king was the bringer of fertility. However, it has been suggested&#151;notably by T. F. O'Rahilly&#151;that Conn was originally a god. One meaning of his name is &#145;sense, wisdom&#146;, and there is a prominent figure in Welsh mythology called Pwyll, whose name means the same. If this is not coincidence, it would appear that both heroes have their source in a single pre-Christian, pan-Celtic personage. Conn seems to have a divine role in what is perhaps the earliest text to mention him, the late seventh-century <span class="italic">Baile Chuinn Ch&eacute;tchathaig</span> (&#145;The frenzy (or vision) of Conn C&eacute;tchathach&#146;), a series of obscure and poetic utterances prophesying the kings of Tara who would come after him.<br>
<br>However, an updated version of this text written some centuries later shows Conn as human, not divine. The prophecy is given by Lug (who was undoubtedly a Celtic deity), although Conn is the one to whom it is spoken. Of Conn himself, Lug prophesied that he would participate in a hundred battles; this is evidently an attempt to explain his epithet (which may be translated as &#145;Hundred-Battler&#146;). Lug listed these battles, but the total is well short of the target. However, the early modern historian Geoffrey Keating quotes a stanza which says that Conn fought a hundred battles against the Munstermen, a hundred against the Ulstermen, and sixty against the Leinstermen.<br>
<br>The genealogies disagree on the number and names of Conn's children. The most significant of his progeny was Art &Oacute;enfher, high-king of Ireland, his son with the daughter of the king of Scotland A&iacute;fe ingen Alp&iacute;n. Among his other wives was Lenabair, the daughter of Cath&aacute;er M&aacute;r, ancestor of the ruling dynasties of Leinster. A Leinster genealogical source claims that while Cath&aacute;er ruled at Tara, Conn ruled at nearby Kells, and that there was complete peace between them.<br>
<br>There is a brief tale about Conn's death, reputedly in 157. He was in a state of enmity with his brother, Eochaid, who had fled to the Ulstermen. Conn sent envoys to the kings of Ulster to get assurances from them about his brother. However, the envoys found Eochaid alone, and took the opportunity to murder him, which was regarded as an outrage by his hosts. A peace was made, but one of the kings, Tipraite, did not accept it and fled to Scotland. He and his men returned after three years, veiled and in women's garb. They came across Conn alone at Tara and Tipraite slew him.<br>
