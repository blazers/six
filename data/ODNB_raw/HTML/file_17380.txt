<span class="headword">MacCarthy,  Justin</span>, first Viscount Mountcashel  (<em>c.</em>1643&#150;1694), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was the third and youngest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/67053/', "Donough MacCarthy, first earl of Clancarty (1594&#150;1665)")</script>, and Eleanor Butler (1612&#150;1682), sister of James Butler, the first duke of Ormond. He was brought up in exile in France, where his eldest brother commanded a regiment. About 1663 he married Lady Arabella (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1628), a daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29056/', "Thomas Wentworth, first earl of Strafford")</script>, a lady some fifteen years his senior. They had no children. MacCarthy's military career began in French service, probably in the Irish regiment raised in 1671 by his cousin Sir George Hamilton. In 1676 MacCarthy was appointed lieutenant-colonel of the duke of Monmouth's regiment, then in French pay, and served against the Dutch. He returned to England in 1678, where it was Charles II's intention to employ him in Ireland. He was given the colonelcy of a regiment of foot in succession to Sir Thomas Dongan, but the accidental discovery of MacCarthy in the houses of parliament in the wake of the uncovering of the Popish Plot caused an uproar when it was revealed that he, an Irish Catholic, held the king's commission. The secretary of state Sir Joseph Williamson was sent to the Tower for countersigning this and other commissions, and MacCarthy fled to Ireland and applied to join the Danish army.<br>
<br>Both MacCarthy's brothers were dead by 1676, and his nephew <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17378/', "Donough Maccarthy (1668&#150;1734)")</script> succeeded as the fourth earl of Clancarty. In 1684, when Clancarty was sixteen, his protestant mother entrusted his education to Dr John Fell (of the celebrated epigram), bishop of Oxford. While in London, &#145;to pervert his nephew, as well as make his own court, [McCarthy] got the king to write to the bishop to let the young lord come up and see the diversions of the town at Christmas&#146;  (Burnet, 2.448), where he was instrumental in arranging his marriage to the fourteen-year-old daughter of the secretary of state Robert Spencer, second earl of Sunderland, and his conversion to Roman Catholicism. In January 1685 MacCarthy was again given the colonelcy of an Irish regiment despite objections that he was a Catholic. Following the accession of James II, he was in 1686 made a privy councillor and promoted to major-general, the second most senior post in the Irish army. Although he was at first recommended for the post by Clarendon, the lord lieutenant, the two men fell out over the deductions that were made from subsistence pay which had become widespread in the Irish army and which Clarendon saw as an abuse. Clarendon was abruptly recalled in early 1687 and MacCarthy kept his post throughout Tyrconnell's purge of protestants in the army.<br>
<br>In February 1689, just before King James arrived in Ireland, the protestants of Bandon declared themselves for William III. MacCarthy marched his regiment into the town while the population were at their Sunday services and installed eight of his men as a garrison to keep the peace. On the next day (&#145;bloody Monday&#146;) these Irish troops were either killed or chased out, the town gates were shut, and a flag proclaiming &#145;no surrender&#146; was raised. MacCarthy returned to the town, forced his way in, rounded up the culprits, and took them back to Cork, where they petitioned King James for mercy. This provided James with an opportunity of showing his goodwill to his protestant subjects: &#145;You may now see you have a gracious king&#146;  (<span class="italic">Full and True Account</span>, 2).<br>
<br>In May 1689, following James's abortive mission to Londonderry, MacCarthy was made master-general of the ordnance in place of Viscount Mountjoy, who was then in the Bastille. In the Dublin parliament of that month MacCarthy sat as a member for co. Cork. On 22 May he brought up to the House of Lords the bill for repealing the <span class="roman">Act of Settlement</span>. On the following day he was created Baron Castleinch and Viscount Mountcashel and he took his seat in the upper house on 24 May.<br>
<br>In the summer of 1689, while the best part of King James's Irish army was besieging Londonderry, MacCarthy was ordered to lead a force of some 4000 men to attack the second stronghold of Williamite resistance, Enniskillen. He was instructed to join forces with Patrick Sarsfield, who was south of the Erne, and James Fitzjames, duke of Berwick, who was at Trillick, and mount a combined attack on Enniskillen. Once an English fleet had been spotted on Lough Swilly, Berwick was recalled to Londonderry and, without contacting Sarsfield, MacCarthy marched on alone. His orders were first to attack Crom Castle, on Upper Lough Erne, which he did unsuccessfully on 30 July 1689. Alerted to his presence, William Wolseley led a force from Enniskillen 15 miles away. On 31 July MacCarthy detached Anthony Hamilton with his dragoons to attack a body of Enniskillen horsemen. Hamilton was defeated and his men chased away. MacCarthy met Wolseley at Newtownbutler, where the Enniskilliners charged through a bog and scattered his army. Once the battle had been decided, MacCarthy led a few horsemen in a desperate charge on those troops who had captured his artillery. He was shot from his horse and taken prisoner to Enniskillen. He told his captors that &#145;he came with a design to lose his life, and was sorry that he had missed his aim, being unwilling to outlive the disgrace of that day&#146;  (Harris, 225). MacCarthy's wounds were treated and once he had given his parole he was allowed to walk in the town. Following a rumour that the Irish intended to free him, he was confined in a cell. Considering himself no longer bound by parole, he escaped by bribing his guard, Sergeant Acheson, who was later executed. &#145;The General [Schomberg] was much concerned when he heard of <i>Mackarty's</i> Escape, and said he took him to be a Man of Honour, but he would not expect that in an Irish Man any more&#146;  (Story, 51).<br>
<br>When MacCarthy arrived back in Dublin at the end of December, he was greeted with bonfires and a procession to Dublin Castle, where he was received by King James. He was chosen to command a force of 5000 Irish recruits, who were to serve in France in exchange for a like number of veteran troops to be sent by Louis XIV to support James's army. MacCarthy was delighted. He had written to the French minister of war that this command was &#145;the thing I most desire in the world &hellip; If they should send another that would cause me the greatest grief and I would only think of retiring for the rest of my days&#146;  (Murphy, 28). The French ambassador, D'Avaux, commented at the time that MacCarthy's short sight would prevent him from ever becoming a great general. John Michelburne more graphically recalled &#145;my colonel, old Justin Maccartie, looks damn'd squinting upon me with his blind eyes&#146;  (Michelburne, 5).<br>
<br>Throughout the spring, with some difficulty, the troops for the &#145;Mountcashel brigade&#146; were recruited and MacCarthy set sail from Cork on 18 April 1690. On his arrival in Brest he was acquitted by a French tribunal of any wrongdoing in breaking his parole in Enniskillen. He was received by Louis XIV at Versailles, had money lavished upon him, and was promoted to the rank of lieutenant-general. In the late summer of 1690 Mountcashel's brigade marched across France to join Marshal Catinat in Italy. In September they were in action in Savoy, where the Irish troops were said to have &#145;performed miracles&#146;  (<span class="italic">Journal &hellip; Dangeau</span>, 3.225), although MacCarthy was shot and dangerously wounded in the chest. He wintered at King James's court in exile at St Germain, where he was involved in the palace plots to discredit Tyrconnell. He campaigned for an audience for the delegation sent to France by Sarsfield and circulated his correspondence from Ireland. By the summer of 1691 he had sufficiently recovered to be sent to Catalonia to serve under Marshal Noailles. In 1692 he joined the army on the Rhine and remained there until the spring of 1694. His old wounds rendered him unfit for command, and he travelled to Bar&egrave;ges in the French Pyrenees to take the curative waters. He died there on 1 July 1694, and was buried there. His wife survived him. By a will dated 8 May 1693 he adopted his distant cousin Florence Callaghan MacCarthy of Carrignavar, co. Cork, as his son and sought to bequeath his title to him.<br>
