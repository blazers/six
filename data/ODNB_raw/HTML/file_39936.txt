</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Helpmann, Sir  Robert Murray</span>  (1909&#150;1986), <span class="occ">ballet dancer and actor</span>, was born on 9 April 1909 at Kingsley House, Bay Road, Mount Gambier, South Australia, the eldest of the three children of James Murray Helpman (1881&#150;1927), stock judge and auctioneer, and his wife, Mary (1883&#150;1970), daughter of Robert Melville Gardiner and his wife, Catherine. His parents' origins were British (the extra &#145;n&#146; in his surname was adopted for the theatre).<br>
<br>Helpmann's great-grandfather, Lieutenant Benjamin Helpman RN, served on HMS <i>Beagle</i> in 1840, contributing to the exploration of northern Australia. His maternal grandfather, Captain Robert Gardiner, born in Scotland in 1812, eventually owned sheep stations in South Australia. No connections with the theatre existed on either side but his maternal grandmother, according to her daughter Mary, was &#145;a good pianist, a good singer, and a devastating mimic, entertaining us with not always kind impersonations of visitors&#146;  (Helpman, 3). Mary grew up with a passion for plays and poetry, but professional acting was out of the question. Her frustration resulted in all three of her children&#151;Robert, Max, and Sheila&#151;making notable stage careers.<br>
<br>Robert was early indoctrinated into his mother's enthusiasms and, as an uninterested and recalcitrant scholar (at Prince Alfred College, Adelaide), he devoted his energies to dancing, piano, and theatregoing. In 1927, when Anna Pavlova toured Australia, she took him on as a student apprentice. Unable for family reasons (his father died in 1927) to go overseas with her, he accepted a contract with the theatre management J. C. Williamson Ltd as principal dancer for musicals, revues, and pantomimes.<br>
<br>Prompted by the actress Margaret Rawlings, who was touring Australia, Helpmann went to England in 1932 with an introduction to Ninette de Valois, director of the Vic-Wells Ballet. De Valois recalled the meeting: &#145;This unknown young man impressed me with a strange sense of power; here, possibly, was an artist of infinite range&#146;  (Anthony, [7]). Although his experience was primarily in stage dancing, she took him on and never regretted it. He was one of a group of talented young men, but steadily outstripped them by reason of his versatility. Technically he was not a classical virtuoso, but ballet then largely required interpretative demi-character dance for which his skills were ideal. He had impeccable musicality, excellent <i>port de bras</i>, and an outstanding gift for partnering.<br>
<br>In April 1934 De Valois gave Helpmann his first created lead in <span class="italic">The Haunted Ballroom</span>. He partnered Alicia Markova in <span class="italic">Swan Lake</span>, and danced in operas and in open-air ballets at Regent's Park. In 1935 he was leading dancer in the revue <span class="italic">Stop Press</span>. Returning to the Wells, he danced the principal role in De Valois's latest ballet, <span class="italic">The Rake's Progress</span>, which, over many years, displayed his great histrionic power and depth. As part of the stimulating Vic-Wells organization he met people in drama, opera, and the visual arts as well as in ballet. One particular, and always acknowledged, mentor was Constant Lambert, the Vic-Wells Ballet's musical director.<br>
<br>In 1936 Frederick Ashton staged an intensely romantic work, <span class="italic">Apparitions</span>, featuring Helpmann and the teenaged Margot Fonteyn. Fonteyn recalled that this was when &#145;the harmony of dancing with Robert Helpmann began taking hold&#146; of her: &#145;It is hard for me to explain the intensity of our involvement in that magical process of &#147;theatre&#148;&#146;  (M. Fonteyn, <span class="italic">Autobiography</span>, 1975, 61). An example of their perfectly matched partnership was their superb rendering of the Aurora <i>pas de deux</i> in <span class="italic">The Sleeping Beauty</span>.<br>
<br>Helpmann's inherited talent for comedy surfaced on stage in 1937, when Ashton's wittily eccentric <span class="italic">A Wedding Bouquet</span> proved his command of burlesque. As a comedian he understood how to differentiate between send-up fun, delicate wit, clever mimicry, and out-and-out clowning. Roles like his inventively crusty Dr Copp&eacute;lius, and the endearingly inebriated Mr O'Reilly in De Valois's <span class="italic">The Prospect before Us</span>, won him staunch admirers. Ballet, however, would never be enough to satisfy Helpmann and in 1937, in a historic Old Vic production by Tyrone Guthrie of <span class="italic">A Midsummer Night's Dream</span>, he played Oberon to Vivien Leigh's <span class="roman">Titania</span>. It was at the Old Vic that he met the producer <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/76194/', "Michael Pickersgill Benthall (1919&#150;1974)")</script>, with whom he had a lifelong homosexual partnership as well as many working collaborations.<br>
<br>During the Second World War, Sadler's Wells Ballet (as it was now known) alternated provincial tours with London seasons. It was accepted that drama, opera, and ballet had a vital part to play in supporting public morale. As an Australian, Helpmann was not liable to be called up, but his tireless wartime workload often involved dancing leads in three performances in one day. The appeal of his partnership with Fonteyn and of his own ballets resulted in the company being far better known and loved after the war than before.<br>
<br>Helpmann turned choreographer in 1942 after Ashton was called up. His first ballet, <span class="italic">Comus</span>, reflected Milton faithfully through lyrical and dramatic dancing, and two months later came a brilliantly condensed <span class="italic">Hamlet</span> set to Tchaikovsky's fantasy overture and stunningly designed by a discovery of Helpmann, Leslie Hurry. The kaleidoscopic action, representing Hamlet's dying memories, testified to Helpmann's thorough knowledge of the play; and in 1944 he acted the part in a Guthrie production for the Old Vic, giving a reading of keen intelligence and finely spoken verse. Later that year came another highly successful ballet, <span class="italic">Miracle in the Gorbals</span>. Theatrically compelling, this was a morality story of a Christlike stranger who raised a suicide and was killed by a gang of thugs. Classical dance, folk-dance, and popular social dances were smoothly intertwined.<br>
<br>Sadler's Wells Ballet transferred in 1946 to the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, and at the gala premi&egrave;re of <span class="italic">The Sleeping Beauty</span> Helpmann, although barely convalescent after a serious viral illness, doubled as Prince Florimund and an elegantly malevolent Carabosse. Healthwise he was in no way up to choreographing and dancing the lead in his complex <span class="italic">Adam Zero</span>, premi&egrave;red in April. Although a memorably exciting production, it was uneven and over-ambitious, and as such was critically damned. Its failure alone did not alter Helpmann's relationship with the company, but another more important factor existed in Ashton's growing antipathy towards him. Temperamentally dependent on general admiration, Ashton was fiercely envious of Helpmann's popularity with the public. Helpmann responded by turning more and more towards other activities.<br>
<br>Although Helpmann continued to dance and maintain connections with ballet&#151;he choreographed the ballet in the film <span class="italic">The Red Shoes</span> (1948)&#151;the next few years were primarily devoted to the dramatic theatre, for the most part in serious or tragic roles. In 1947 he and Benthall presented a triumphant revival of <span class="italic">The White Devil</span> in which he played Flamineo. In 1948 they joined Barry Jackson's company at Stratford upon Avon, and Helpmann added King John and Shylock to his repertory. In 1951 they were associated with the Olivier&#150;Vivien Leigh season of Shaw's <span class="italic">Caesar and Cleopatra</span> and <span class="italic">Antony and Cleopatra</span>, when Helpmann played Apollodorus and Octavius Caesar. In 1952 he acted with Katharine Hepburn (who became a close friend) as the Doctor in <span class="italic">The Millionairess</span>. In 1954 he played Oberon at the Edinburgh festival, and was rightly acclaimed as The Devil in G&uuml;nther Rennert's production of <span class="italic">The Soldier's Tale</span>. He returned to Australia in 1955 (after twenty-three years), with Hepburn and Benthall, in a stimulating trio of Shakespeare plays, acting Petruchio, Shylock, and Angelo in <span class="italic">Measure for Measure</span>. Three years later he danced for the first time in Australia with the Royal Ballet.<br>
<br>Helpmann was now directing plays, having staged a remarkable production of <span class="italic">Murder in the Cathedral</span>, starring Robert Donat, at the Old Vic in 1953. In opera, there was a spectacular and amusing production of <span class="italic">Le coq d'or</span>, starring Mattiwilda Dobbs, at Covent Garden in 1954. During Benthall's term as director of the Old Vic (1953&#150;61), Helpmann regularly acted and directed there while at the same time appearing in West End plays such as Coward's <span class="italic">Nude with Violin</span> and Sartre's <span class="italic">Nekrassov</span> in 1957. Television plays included the solo performance <span class="italic">Box for One</span> in 1953, and his film roles included the terrifying Child-catcher in <span class="italic">Chitty Chitty Bang Bang</span> (1968).<br>
<br>Australian tours had tightened Helpmann's always strong family bonds, and in 1964 he choreographed <span class="italic">The Display</span> for the Australian Ballet. This related the lyre-bird's mating dance to a group of young picnicking Australians, and was an immense local success. In the following year he became co-director of the company with Peggy van Praagh. Other ballets followed, and Helpmann's worldwide contacts and standards were also of great value to the Australian Ballet's development and its increasingly important overseas tours. His services to both British and Australian ballet were marked by a knighthood in 1968.<br>
<br>Helpmann's international reputation in the performing arts, and his mischievous delight in feeding the media with controversial material (he was wittily articulate), made him a household name in Australia. He was, however, often in conflict with the Australian Ballet board, and in 1976 they sacked him (his word) from his directorship. During the next ten years he continued acting and directing plays and operas. In May 1986, although suffering from emphysema, he appeared for the last time on stage as the Red King in an Australian Ballet revival of De Valois's <span class="italic">Checkmate</span>, an impressive mime role he had created forty-seven years before. On 28 September 1986 he died at Sydney Royal North Shore Hospital.<br>
<br>Australia realized what it had lost. He was given a state funeral on 2 October at St Andrew's Cathedral, Sydney, before a private cremation, and tributes came from the senate and the house of representatives, where the prime minister (Bob Hawke) said: &#145;No one should underestimate Sir Robert Helpmann's role in the development of the growing maturity of Australia's art and culture&#146;. De Valois summed up their long association more personally:<blockquote>To work with Robert Helpmann was always an inspiration. There was at work an alerted intelligence with an acute sense of perception &hellip; Bobby had a sense of humour that surmounted everything. Sometimes it was expressed by word of mouth, sometimes by an outburst of mime, at other times by just a look&#151;and the latter could prove to be the most potent of all. (<span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span>, London, 29 Sept 1986)</blockquote>Helpmann's achievements in the dramatic arts resulted from natural talents guided by a well-balanced and courageous character. He brought unremitting perfectionist application, as well as great zest, to everything he undertook. As a choreographer he created mime and movement dramas rather than plotless ballets, and always chose collaborating composers and designers of the highest calibre. Inevitably he had critics and denigrators, and people he upset either by his mimicry or by the incurable honesty with which he said what he thought. Great friendships, however, were a dominant feature of his life. Michael Somes of the Royal Ballet spoke for many who knew him when he wrote in <span class="italic">Uproar</span>, the Royal Ballet's house journal at Christmas 1986:<blockquote>Perhaps only those of us (from all branches of the theatre) who were fortunate enough and privileged enough to work and learn from him, can know how much we owe to his influence and example &hellip; [he] was not only a kind and generous human being who &hellip; was willing to share his talent for the benefit of others. Above all, on and off the stage, we owe him hours of laughter.</blockquote>
