<span class="headword">Fletcher <span class="st"> [<em>married name </em>Wedderburn]</span>,  Elizabeth <span class="st"> [Betty]</span></span>  (1731&#150;1758), <span class="occ">scholar</span>, was born in December 1731, the youngest daughter and seventh of the eight children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9721/', "Andrew Fletcher, Lord Milton (1691/2&#150;1766)")</script>, lord justice clerk of Scotland, and his wife, Elizabeth Kinloch (<i>bap</i>. 1710, <i>d</i>. 1782), daughter of Sir Francis Kinloch of Gilmerton. Generally known as Betty, she was educated at Miss Aylesworth's school in Chelsea from February 1742 to April 1745, although there is little evidence for its curriculum beyond music and singing. She was later taught French and music with her sisters in Edinburgh by private tutors. Her life was brief; from the point of view of her only daughter, also Elizabeth, she married early and within a year she was dead in childbed  (Wedderburn, 104&#150;5).<br>
<br>Starkly summarized, Betty Fletcher's short existence and untimely end might seem tragic but unremarkable in an age of high maternal mortality. However, there was more to Betty than these brief facts suggest. Her father, Lord Milton, known for his shrewdness, leniency, and discretion, exercised these qualities not only as a judge but as confidential agent to Sir Robert Walpole's leading Scottish adviser, Archibald Campbell, Lord Ilay, later third duke of Argyll. The two men were friends as well as business associates, and so Betty spent several weeks each summer with her parents and sisters at Inveraray Castle, the duke of Argyll's principal residence. There she mixed with a stimulating group of clever young men. One of them was Robert Adam the celebrated architect, then at the start of his career. Proud and ambitious, he felt that Lord Milton's family were patronizing him when he met them at Inveraray in 1754. When Betty said that she envied his forthcoming opportunity of going to Italy, for she loved paintings, he commented to his own sisters: &#145;This from the stinkingest of mortals I look'd on as no small compliment, till [the] next disdainful look from her nizzety gab wipt entirely away all impression of it&#146;. He went on to characterize her sister Mally as proud and overbearing and their amiable mother as &#145;virulent&#146;  (Lindsay and Cosh, 70).<br>
<br>Adam's reaction was not shared by others, for it seems that Betty was very popular with her contemporaries. More than that, she played an important role in the circle of young men who were to become the leading intellectuals of Scotland's Enlightenment. It was she who introduced William Robertson the historian, David Hume and Adam Ferguson the philosophers, Adam Smith the economist, and John Home the playwright to her father and so to the all-powerful Lord Ilay. &#145;They owe their rise to her&#151;genius, taste and refinement of sentiment in no degree inferior to their own&#146;, her daughter wrote proudly, many years later, commenting that not one of them would disclaim it  (Wedderburn, 104&#150;5).<br>
<br>In the late 1750s Betty met Captain John Wedderburn of Gosford (1720&#150;1793), who later changed his name to Halkett when he inherited the baronetcy of Pitfirrane. They fell in love, and married on 6 February 1758. A devoted couple, they hated being apart even for a few hours, but within months of the wedding Captain Wedderburn's regiment was posted to the West Indies. Betty was by now pregnant, and her friends urged her to use her influence to have her husband sent somewhere nearer home. She refused to interfere, and he set sail. She bore his absence with serenity, but she had always been delicate and &#145;Grief suppressed preys on the vitals&#146;  (Wedderburn, 104&#150;5). She gave birth to a daughter, whom she named after herself, but died soon afterwards, on 18 December 1758, telling her friends, &#145;I have done my duty to my husband's honour, but my doing so has cost me my life&#146;  (ibid.).<br>
<br>Captain Wedderburn returned to Scotland, eventually remarried, and had fourteen more children, but he never forgot his first wife and he brought up their daughter on tales of her mother's modesty, discernment, and thirst for knowledge. At a time when women were increasingly developing scholarly interests, her short life demonstrates how, even without a formal education, intelligent women could play a full and influential part in intellectual society.<br>
