<span class="headword">Selous <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em>Slous]</span>,  Henry Courtney</span>  (1803&#150;1890), <span class="occ">artist and illustrator</span>, was born at 2 Panton Street, Haymarket, London, on 25 April 1803, the son of Gideon Slous (1779/80&#150;1856) and his wife, Sophia Ann Lokes (<i>d</i>. 1847). His father, a painter specializing in miniatures, trained him in music, literature, and art, and prepared him successfully for entry to the Royal Academy Schools in 1818. That year he exhibited his first work at the Royal Academy, <span class="italic">Portrait of a Favourite Cat</span>. Despite his young age he won four separate medals for figure drawing, two gold and two silver. Commissioned in 1825 by Charles Knight to produce twelve illustrations to short passages from Shakespeare's <span class="italic">The Tempest</span>, he responded with a series of updated Flaxmanesque works in which the few key figures are large and clear, arranged on a plane, like a frieze. His academic training was evident in the dominant central characters, using clear gestures to signal their emotions in the manner of the heroic classicism of the seicento schools of north Italy, especially the work of Guido Reni and the Caracci. His commercial success was founded on this heroic style, which was almost the official version of classicism, sponsored by Reynolds and popular with aristocratic collectors.<br>
<br>During the early 1830s Slous developed his career as an illustrator, taking such work as Elliott's <span class="italic">Portraits of Painters</span> (3 vols., 1832), and providing twelve illustrations for <span class="italic">Tales of a Rambler</span> (1836), a collection of historical short stories by his younger brother Angiolo Robson Selous 
    (or Slous; 1812&#150;1883)
  . By 1835 he felt financially secure enough to move into Keats's former home in Wentworth Place, Hampstead, and about that time adopted Selous as the spelling of his surname. He married, at St Pancras parish church on 4 March 1837, Emily Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1879), daughter of the successful miniature painter <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2837/', "Henry Pierce Bone")</script>. They had four daughters.<br>
<br>Selous's wealth and reputation always rested on commercial grounds. He was the principal assistant painter of the enormous canvas panoramas produced by Robert Burford at the Leicester Square Rotunda in London. Such vast and hurried work was clearly a collaborative project. Each canvas was covered with varnished oil paint, not distemper, as Burford insisted that this was art, not mere stage work. It has been estimated that Selous worked on about thirty of these vast works, but the evidence is incomplete. The first known contribution by Selous, in 1829, was <span class="italic">Milton's Pandemonium</span>. In 1833 he recorded his work on <span class="italic">The View of the Continent of Boothia</span> (1833), from the polar expedition of Sir John Ross. The subject matter of the panoramas was usually &#145;sublime&#146; in the style of John Martin and David Roberts, and covered historical events from early biblical and classical history, but also included the most contemporary subject matter, based on sketches made by observers, for instance <span class="italic">The Battle of Sobraon, with the Defeat of the Sikh Army at Punjab</span> (1846), several works during the Crimean War (Alma, 1854, and Sevastopol, 1855) and the destruction of Canton (1859). Another perennial topic was exotic travel, usually prompted by contemporary events, with Naples and Nanking (Nanjing) (1845), Rouen and Constantinople (1846), the Himalayas and Cairo (1847), Paris and Pompeii (1848), Lucerne (1850), Niagara Falls (1851), Salzburg and the Alps at Berne (1852), Mexico and Granada (1853), St Petersburg (1856), and Messina (1861).<br>
<br>Practised in large-scale work, Selous entered the fresco competition for the houses of parliament in 1843 with his <span class="italic">Boadicea Haranguing the Iceni</span>. This received a &pound;100 prize, but was not executed. Nevertheless he was commissioned to produce a fresco for the Law Society on Chancery Lane, <span class="italic">King Alfred Submitting his Code of Law</span> (1844). His plates for <span class="italic">Bunyan's Pilgrim's Progress</span> and <span class="italic">Sintram and his Companions</span>, each undertaken in 1844, show his progress, and both were published by the Art Union. The works are busier and more dynamic than before, but the central action is always clear. He also added the kind of exuberant border work (foliation, arches, and framing motifs) characteristic of medieval manuscripts and, in particular, the fashionable work of contemporary German illustrations (contemporaries noted August Moritz Retzsch as a key influence, particularly in the Bunyan works).<br>
<br>In the 1850s Selous earned a more respectable reputation for his illustrations (<span class="italic">Life of Moses</span> in twenty plates and <span class="italic">Seven Events in the Life of Robert the Bruce</span>, both 1850) and for a series of large oil canvases. His <span class="italic">The Opening of the Great Exhibition</span> (1852; V&amp;A) was painted in the same year as his design for <span class="italic">Surrender of Calais: Queen Philippa Pleading with the Burgesses</span>, which won a prize of &pound;500 from the Art Union. Still with an eye for a popular subject, he painted <span class="italic">The Glorious Charge of the Heavy Brigade at Balaclava</span> (exh. RA, 1855), linking his professional work with his more commercial work for Burford.<br>
<br>In the 1860s Selous continued to market his popular heroic style. In 1863 he produced a large-scale fresco imitation of Leonardo da Vinci's <span class="italic">Last Supper</span>, with an accompanying chromolithograph print and, later, a pamphlet study of Leonardo in 1870. He also undertook the work on which his reputation now rests, the illustrations for <span class="italic">Cassell's Illustrated Shakespeare</span> (1864&#150;8). In 1869 he produced a series of widely admired engravings for Kingsley's <span class="italic">Hereward the Wake</span> (once again issued by the Art Union).<br>
<br>By the 1870s Selous's fortunes were at their peak. He was living in 28 Gloucester Road, and in 1871 his daughter Maria married George Webb Medley, a wealthy stockbroker and economist living on Park Lane. Selous celebrated with a proud self-portrait (1871; NPG). He produced a series of topographical works of the Holy Land, after a visit there in the early 1870s: <span class="italic">Jerusalem: in Her Grandeur (<span class="smallcap">AD</span> 33)</span> and <span class="italic">In Her Fall</span>. Here he returned to the style of David Roberts, and each was typically accompanied by a short explanatory pamphlet. He also wrote stories for children, <span class="italic">The Young Governess</span> (1872), <span class="italic">Granny's Story-Box</span> (1874), and <span class="italic">Our White Violet</span> (1880). He died at the country house that his daughter and son-in-law had recently built, Winsford Tower, Beaworthy, Devon, on 24 September 1890, and was buried at Highgate cemetery.<br>
