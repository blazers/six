<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Clynes,  John Robert</span>  (1869&#150;1949), <span class="occ">trade unionist and politician</span>, was born at Oldham, Lancashire, on 27 March 1869, the elder of two sons, and one of seven children of Patrick Clynes, an illiterate Irish farmworker, and his wife, Bridget Scanlan. His father had been evicted in 1851 and emigrated to Lancashire, where he gained employment as a gravedigger.<br>
<br>Clynes stated later that he hated his years at the local elementary school, and eagerly became a &#145;half-timer&#146; at the age of ten, working as a &#145;little piecer&#146; in a textile mill from six in the morning until noon for half-a-crown a week and continuing at school in the afternoon. At the age of twelve he left school altogether and was earning 10<i>s</i>. a week at the mill. Out of his early wages he bought a tattered dictionary for 6<i>d</i>. and Cobbett's <span class="italic">Grammar</span> for 8<i>d</i>. He received 3<i>d</i>. a week for reading regularly to three blind men, whose discussions of the political news aroused his interest. He paid 8<i>d</i>. for tuition on two nights a week from a former schoolmaster.<br>
<br>By 1883 Clynes was a &#145;big piecer&#146; earning 17<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>. a week, and was reading the works of Carlyle, Ruskin, Mill, Emerson, and Renan. Attracted to the skills of debate, Clynes practised oratory with a workmate in a disused quarry outside the town. He began to contribute to the local press under the pen-name Piecer, describing the conditions of child life in the mill, and writing on trade unionism, socialism, and labour representation. He successfully rebelled against having to clean and oil machinery without pay, and organized a Piecers' Union, for piecers had no direct representation in the Spinners' Union. In 1891, at the invitation of Will Thorne (1857&#150;1946), he left the mill to serve as a district organizer at 30<i>s</i>. a week for one of the first organizations for unskilled workers, the National Union of Gasworkers and General Labourers, which Thorne had inaugurated in 1889.<br>
<br>Described in his obituary in <span class="italic">The Times</span> as &#145;short in stature, slight in build, not a powerful voice&#146;, and without a forceful personality, Clynes gained respect by the very reasonableness and gentleness of his approach. It was said of him in 1901 that he was a man of peace who thought that what was mostly wanted was a sense of humour. His methods were often seen by contemporaries to have achieved results when the more aggressive tactics of some of his colleagues had failed. On 13 September 1893 he married a cardroom hand, Mary Elizabeth, daughter of Owen Harper, watchmaker, of Oldham. They had two sons and a daughter.<br>
<br>Clynes was president of the Oldham Trades Council in 1892 and its secretary from 1894 to 1912. At this time he also began to be involved in socialist politics on a wider front: he attended the foundation conference of the Independent Labour Party at Bradford in 1893, and in the same year was a delegate to the International Socialist Congress at Z&uuml;rich. A twenty weeks' lock-out in the cotton trade during this period emphasized in his mind the need for working-class political organization. Representing his union at the Belfast Trades Union Congress in 1893, he supported nationalization as a principle. He was appointed secretary for the Lancashire district of his union in 1896. His union was one of the strongest proponents of independent labour political action and Clynes represented it at the Plymouth Trades Union Congress in 1899 when it was decided to form the Labour Representation Committee, destined from 1906 to become the Labour Party. At the inaugural conference in London in February 1900 he again attended for his union, and in 1904 was elected to represent the affiliated trades councils on the national executive; from 1909 to 1939 he was consistently elected to the trades union section. He was chairman of the party organization in 1908, presiding over the Portsmouth conference in 1909.<br>
<br>Clynes's parliamentary career began in 1906 when he was returned for the North-Eastern (later Platting) division of Manchester as a member of the first Parliamentary Labour Party, and he lived to be the last survivor of this group. He represented the constituency until defeated in October 1931. He made various journeys abroad, among others to attend the 1909 Toronto convention of the American Federation of Labor as fraternal delegate from the British Trades Union Congress.<br>
<br>In 1915 Clynes opposed the entry of Labour into the Asquith coalition in which three of his colleagues had appointments; but after the formation of the Lloyd George coalition he served on the food commission in 1917 and in the same year joined David Alfred Thomas, Lord Rhondda, food controller, as parliamentary secretary. A system of rationing was gradually introduced and a consumers' council set up, of which Clynes was chairman. He became a privy councillor in 1918 and succeeded Rhondda as food controller when the latter died in that year. When the war ended Clynes opposed the withdrawal of the Labour Party from the government, sharing the view of his colleague, G. N. Barnes, that Labour should assist in the formulation of the peace treaties; but when the party decided against that policy, Clynes, unlike Barnes, conformed, and resigned his office.<br>
<br>Clynes was returned unopposed as MP for Platting at the general election in 1918. Elected vice-chairman of the parliamentary party, he became chairman in 1921 after the resignation of William Adamson, and led the party in the general election of 1922. In the election for chairman of the parliamentary party which followed, he was defeated by Ramsay MacDonald by five votes, and accepted the vice-chairmanship. In January 1924 he moved the successful vote of no confidence which brought about the defeat of the Baldwin government and led to MacDonald's first Labour administration in which Clynes himself was lord privy seal and deputy leader of the House of Commons.<br>
<br>Opposed to the principle of a general strike, in 1926 Clynes and others in the parliamentary party sought to conciliate between the Miners' Federation, the mine owners, and the government. Nevertheless, when the strike took place Clynes supported the miners throughout the dispute, which cost his union &pound;200,000 in strike pay. As home secretary in MacDonald's second government of 1929, Clynes was active in the area of prison reform and took great interest in an inquiry into the cotton trade. He was also responsible for refusing Trotsky permission to settle in England. In 1931 Clynes introduced an electoral reform bill providing for the alternative vote, and also abolishing university representation, a clause which was deleted by four votes in the committee stage in the House of Commons. The bill was drastically amended in the House of Lords and soon afterwards the economic situation brought the Labour government to an end.<br>
<br>On the formation of Ramsay MacDonald's &#145;national&#146; government, Clynes refused the party leadership which went to Arthur Henderson. In the ensuing general election Clynes lost his seat and devoted himself to the work of his union, of which he had been president since 1912. The union, which was by then known as the National Union of General and Municipal Workers, had become one of the largest in the country, and when Clynes retired from the presidency in 1937 it covered nearly half a million members in a wide range of industries. Clynes received the honorary degree of DCL from the universities of Oxford and Durham in 1919.<br>
<br>In 1935 Clynes returned to parliament as MP for Platting and was content to be counted an elder statesman of the labour movement generally. Contemporaries greatly respected his judgement, sincerity, and loyalty. In 1945 he retired on reaching the parliamentary age limit set by his union and lived quietly and frugally, on the pension which it gave him, in his Putney home. In 1947 Clynes wrote to <span class="italic">The Times</span> and other journals complaining of his circumstances and the insufficiency of his union pension, and a fund was raised by his parliamentary colleagues and friends. Many close to him were disappointed by these complaints, which they felt to be unjustified, and thought they indicated how his wartime and other trials had affected him (his wife became an invalid after sustaining serious air-raid injuries in the Second World War). Clynes died at his home, 41 St John's Avenue, Putney Hill, London, on 23 October 1949. He was cremated at Putney Vale crematorium on 27 October. His wife survived him, but died shortly afterwards.<br>
