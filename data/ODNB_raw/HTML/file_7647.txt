<span class="headword">Dilkes, Sir  Thomas</span>  (<em>c.</em>1667&#150;1707), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, was described in 1687 as a relative of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6485/', "Sir William Coventry")</script>, and later as a prot&eacute;g&eacute; of Lord Carbery. He served as a king's letter boy between 1683 and 1686, became a lieutenant in 1687, and took command of the fireship <i>Charles</i> in April 1689. In 1692 he was appointed to the <i>Adventure</i> (50 guns), in which he shared in the victories of Barfleur and La Hogue. In different ships he remained actively employed in the channel, on the coast of Ireland, in the Bay of Biscay, or on the coast of Portugal until, in 1696, commanding the <i>Rupert</i> (60 guns) he went to the West Indies in the squadron under Vice-Admiral John Nevell. Following the deaths of Nevell, Rear-Admiral George Mees, and nearly all the other captains, Dilkes succeeded to the command, and brought the squadron home in October 1697. He held a series of short-lived commands in the years of peace that followed, and was seriously injured when his ship was wrecked on the Irish coast in 1699. In 1702 he commanded the <i>Somerset</i> (70 guns) in the fleet under Sir George Rooke, who hoisted his flag in that ship for the attack on the combined fleets in Vigo harbour.<br>
<br>In March 1703 Dilkes was promoted rear-admiral of the white, and during the summer, with his flag in the <i>Kent</i>, he commanded a squadron on the coast of France. On 26&#150;7 July he drove onshore near Granville and Avranches, and captured or destroyed almost all the fleet of forty-five merchant ships and three frigates which formed their escort&#151;a service for which the queen ordered gold medals to be struck and presented to the admirals and captains. Dilkes was then employed cruising in the channel, and he returned to Spithead just in time to escape the fury of the great storm on 26 November 1703. In the same year he was elected MP for Castle Martyr in the Irish House of Commons, a seat he held until 1707.<br>
<br>In 1704 Dilkes sailed with Sir Cloudesley Shovell to join Rooke at Lisbon; afterwards he took a prominent part in the battle of Malaga as rear-admiral of the White squadron, in acknowledgement of which he was knighted by the queen on 22 October 1704. In February 1705 he sailed again for the straits, with his flag in the <i>Revenge</i>, and on 10 March, after joining Sir John Leake, he played a major role in capturing and destroying the French squadron that was blockading Gibraltar. He remained with the Mediterranean Fleet under the earl of Peterborough before returning to England with Shovell in November. During 1706 he was employed chiefly in the blockade of Dunkirk but in January 1707 he sailed in company with Shovell for the Mediterranean, where he took part in the operations, including the siege of Toulon. On the siege being lifted Dilkes remained commander-in-chief and, after conferring with Archduke Charles at Barcelona, he sailed for Leghorn where he anchored on 19 November. On his arrival Dilkes became involved in a dispute over salutes with the fort. He claimed the right to be saluted first, but it was contended that the fort never saluted any flag first, except those of admirals or vice-admirals. Dilkes had to be content with this. To show that there was nothing personal in this refusal, he was invited to a public dinner on shore on 1 December. In going back to his ship from the heated room he got a chill, followed by a fever, of which he died on 12 December 1707; his death, so soon after his dispute with the grand-ducal court, led to a groundless rumour that he had been poisoned. He was survived by his wife, Mary, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20463/', "Murrough O'Brien, first earl of Inchiquin")</script>, and widow of Henry Boyle of Castle Martyr; they had at least one child, Michael O'Brien Dilkes, army officer. Mary Dilkes later married Colonel John Irwin.<br>
