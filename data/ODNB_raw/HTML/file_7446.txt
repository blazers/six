<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Rue,  de la, family</span>  (<em>per. </em><em>c.</em>1820&#150;1923), <span class="occ">stationers and printers</span>, came to prominence with <a name="cosubject_7446"></a><span class="headword">Thomas  de la Rue</span>  (1793&#150;1866)<span class="occ"></span>, born in La For&ecirc;t, Guernsey, on 24 March 1793, and apprenticed to the master printer Joseph Antoine Chevalier at St Peter Port in Guernsey in 1803. On finishing his apprenticeship, Thomas took up with Tom Greenslade of Bishop's Nympton in Devon, who was related by marriage to Thomas's future wife, Jane Warren: in 1812 they launched a newspaper, <span class="italic">Le Publiciste</span>. After only a few months Thomas walked out on the partnership and, with a determination and audacity that were to characterize his business life, raised funding from John Campion, husband of his sister Rachel, to publish his own rival newspaper, <span class="italic">Le Miroir Politique</span>. This was so successful that after only a few months he advertised for an apprentice. Thomas's interest in the quality of printing and in other types of publication, such as editions of the litany and <span class="roman">Psalms</span>, indicated the future direction of his career.<br>
<br>On 21 March 1814 de la Rue married Jane Warren (1789&#150;1858) of Bishop's Nympton. Their first child, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7447/', "Warren de la Rue (1815&#150;1889)")</script>, was born at St Peter Port in January 1815. In that summer de la Rue left the <span class="italic">Miroir Politique</span>, and after his father's death in November 1816 he and his family left Guernsey. They may have moved first to Barnstaple before settling in London, where Thomas set up business in Finsbury Square manufacturing straw hats, a skill perhaps learned in Guernsey through family connections. His second son, <a href="#cosubject_64906">William Frederick [<i>see below</i>]</a>, was born in London soon after. Millinery still allowed de la Rue to experiment with different printing techniques and dyes for paper bonnets during the 1820s; however, a reference to playing cards in his notebooks for 1828 signalled what was to become a lucrative new line. Two years later he was in business with Samuel Cornish and William Frederick Rock, calling themselves &#145;Cardmakers, Hot Pressers and Enamellers&#146;.<br>
<br>The new decade brought mixed fortunes. The first few years were prosperous: in 1831 de la Rue registered an ace of spades at the Stamp Office, Somerset House, as was required for purposes of duty on playing cards; the following year he received royal letters patent for improvements in the colour printing and decoration of playing cards. His specification contained descriptions of two methods of applying colour by surface-printing, one employing typography from raised wooden or metal blocks, the other lithography, printing from stones. In each case separate blocks or stones were used for different colours and Thomas paid particular attention to methods of fitting the design together in perfect register, with no overlap or gap between colours. Not all his innovations were successful: attempts to add character to the expressions on the face cards were unpopular&#151;instead, Thomas applied creativity to decoration on the back of the cards. In 1835 the business moved to the address that became the seat of its empire, 110 Bunhill Row in the City, with the family living next door at number 108. However, the commercial depression of 1837 caused serious financial difficulties for the firm and the partnership&#151;now de la Rue, James, and Rudd&#151;was dissolved. Things were so bad that late in May de la Rue was arrested for debt, and though it was in his creditors' interest to bail him out, they drove a hard bargain to do so, running the business for a while as a trust with de la Rue as a paid employee, and negotiating a low price to buy his patent for the production of white lead. The family pulled together to weather the storm: by 1837 both de la Rue's sons were working in the business, and his wife and eldest daughter also helped out. Warren de la Rue had joined the firm some two years earlier, and was already proving the worth of his scientific interests; indeed, another scientist with whom he had collaborated, Charles Button, lent de la Rue money to help clear his debts. In 1839 both Warren and Charles Button were made partners in the firm, and in the following year Warren married Georgiana Bowles (1819&#150;1918), who travelled with him on business and helped him throughout his career. Typically, Thomas de la Rue bounced back from his problems, celebrating Victoria's coronation in June 1838 by employing 100 staff for six days to gild a special edition of the <span class="italic">Sun</span> newspaper.<br>
<br>For several decades both family and business flourished as established lines and new products were developed with shrewd collaboration and constant experiment, and were rewarded with public recognition. Warren de la Rue combined scientific experiment with business travel, as well as superintending building works and devising an improved boiler for making tea for the workmen. Playing cards became a cornerstone of the business, the more expensive packs distinguished by the work of Owen Jones (1809&#150;1874), who in an association lasting several decades produced over 170 designs for playing cards alone, including a pack for the royal family, as well as for diaries and calendars. The cards and their manufacture earned the praise of Charles Dickens in his <span class="italic">Household Words</span> (vol. 6, 1853), and their influence was indirectly acknowledged by the family long after the business had diversified: referring to the number of cards in a pack, William Frederick left &pound;52 in his will to Owen Jones, while Warren's younger son, <a href="#cosubject_32773">Thomas Andros de la Rue [<i>see below</i>]</a>, had the houses of Cadogan Square renumbered so that his would be number 52.<br>
<br>In an early venture into overseas markets in the early 1840s Thomas de la Rue established his younger brother, Paul, in St Petersburg to oversee the tsar's playing card business, for which De La Rue supplied machinery. Railway tickets and visiting cards were added to the range of printed goods, and the range of social stationery expanded. Such activities followed on from existing business, but as early as 1840 de la Rue took out a printing patent which contained hints of two key areas of future development, in a reference to &#145;banknotes, post office envelopes or any work requiring great difficulty of invention&#146;. At this date the firm was not yet directly engaged in the security printing of currency or stamps, but among several valuable contacts, Warren was friendly with Edwin Hill, the brother of Rowland Hill who introduced the pre-paid penny postage in 1840. Capitalizing on the market opened up by the increase in post, De La Rue initially moved into the manufacture of envelopes, cut mechanically by a machine invented by Warren de la Rue and Edwin Hill.<br>
<br>This venture was just one feature of the accolade published in <span class="italic">Chambers's Edinburgh Journal</span> in July 1846: recounting his experience in &#145;A day at De La Rue's&#146;, the writer found &#145;an amusing hive of industry; steam-engines, machinery and animated beings, commingling in restless and varied movement&#146; to produce playing cards, mourning stationery and marriage cards, needle-books, and even a portable chessboard. The description shows that inventive production was matched by economies of scale and good management: the firm made and repaired their own machinery, while the productivity of some 300 employees was maximized by such paternalistic measures as replacing beer breaks with a shorter working day and establishing a library and a sickness fund. The article described the firm as the largest of its kind in the world&#151;journalistic exaggeration, perhaps, but indicative of status which was recognized and enhanced at the Great Exhibition of 1851.<br>
<br>With the help of good contacts&#151;Warren had by now been elected to the Royal Society and Owen Jones was superintendent of works for the Great Exhibition&#151;De La Rue had a prime site and attracted huge crowds to their display, of which the envelope-making machine was the centrepiece. Other items included portable writing-desks, designed by William Frederick, and playing cards with coloured pips to assist those with poor sight; the latter were not a success at the time, though similar devices are now a common feature on paper currency, of which the present-day De La Rue is a major producer. Thomas, Warren, and the firm won medals for their contributions to the exhibition, which were also rewarded by good publicity in the exhibition catalogue, the <span class="italic">Illustrated London News</span>, and in Henry Selous's painting of Victoria opening the exhibition, which included Thomas and Warren among the onlookers&#151;indeed, the family bought the painting, later presented to the Victoria and Albert Museum. At the exhibitions in New York and Paris in 1853 and 1855 the firm won further honours and Thomas was made chevalier of the L&eacute;gion d'honneur.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_64906"></a><span class="headword">William Frederick  de la Rue</span>  (1825&#150;1870)<span class="occ"></span>, Thomas's younger son, was born in London on 3 April 1825; he began working for the firm in 1837 and became a traveller in 1840. He was made a partner in 1850 and married Emma Tanner on 20 May of the following year. For some time they lived in the family house next door to the business in Bunhill Row before moving to Harley Street in 1864. Known as Colonel Billy because of his close association with a militia regiment, the 4th Tower Hamlets, William Frederick applied his administrative skills to complement Warren's scientific interests. Over the next twenty years they introduced two important new lines: postage stamps and paper money. In 1853 the firm received a four-year contract from the Inland Revenue to produce adhesive revenue stamps for drafts and receipts. The surface-printing techniques De La Rue used for playing cards enabled them to offer benefits of cost and security over their rivals, Perkins, Bacon &amp; Co., who had hitherto had the Inland Revenue business. In the next few years this advantage was pressed further, helped by a chemist, Hugo M&uuml;ller, whom Warren had brought to the firm and who worked on perfecting secure printing inks. In 1855 De La Rue produced their first postage stamp, the fourpenny carmine; two years later they received a further contract for the 1<i>s</i>. and 6<i>d</i>. stamps. Another major market opened up in 1854 with the order for stamps for the East India Company, a contract which led to further postal business for the whole of India, including the supply of government stationery.<br>
<br>A second breakthrough came in 1858 when the crown agents asked De La Rue to produce stamps for the British colonies. Once again, De La Rue's gain was Perkins Bacon's loss: disapproving of their lack of consultation, the new agent general for the crown agents established a good relationship with William Frederick, who was given the courtesy title &#145;Engraver to the Agents General for the Crown Colonies&#146;. The potential offered by colonial business was boosted further in 1859 when Mauritius placed an order for paper currency, a line of security printing anticipated in the patent of 1840. In 1860 banknotes for Mauritius were printed from copper plates. For the immediate future postage stamps were the greater area of growth for the firm, but these developments were the seeds of greater things to come, for in the twentieth century supplying stamps and banknotes to the British empire was a major part of De La Rue's business.<br>
<br>During the 1850s Thomas de la Rue continued to work on improvements in paper and printing inks, still maintaining his determination to stay ahead of the field; thus in 1856 and 1857 he took John Dickinson &amp; Co. to court for infringing the patent for the envelope-making machine, and won. In 1858 his wife, Jane, died; some months later he married a young Swedish woman, Alice Marie Andr&eacute;. Soon afterwards he retired from the firm, having negotiated a generous settlement which included lending money to his sons at high interest. In valuing his own achievement in founding the business above that of his sons in developing it, Thomas created a bitterness that was not resolved; thus his career ended as it had begun, with a successful partnership turning sour. After a few weeks of illness, he died at 84 Westbourne Terrace, London, on 7 June 1866, and was buried at Kensal Green.<br>
<br>Following Thomas's retirement the firm's business continued to expand at home and abroad. Perhaps through William Frederick's friendship with American cousins, De La Rue in 1862 was given the contract to print postage stamps for the Confederate states. William Frederick and Warren were both active in travelling to solicit new business. They won orders for stamps and railway tickets in Italy, latterly helping the Italians to set up their own printing plant. Two letters from William Frederick at Bunhill Row to Warren in Italy in 1862 are a mix of family concerns&#151;Emma, William Frederick's wife, was ill&#151;and business, including a promising new order from the raja of Mysore. Postal contracts continued for India, and were established for Portugal and in South America. At home output and sales of playing cards and railway tickets rose impressively, research continued into improving paper and watermarks, and the stationery business flourished, including the ever popular Improved Indelible Diary and Memorandum, almost a miniature almanac, and calendars and diaries embellished with Owen Jones's exquisite decoration&#151;also to be found on labels for Whitbread's stout and Huntley and Palmers' biscuits. To accommodate this growth, the firm opened offices in Liverpool and Paris (the effects of the Civil War led to the early closure of a New York office) and expanded their London property.<br>
<br>On 24 August 1870 William Frederick de la Rue died at 122 Harley Street, London, aged forty-six, from cancer of the liver, leaving a distraught family. Warren, who had retired some months earlier, came back to run the firm with the help of his two sons, Warren William (1847&#150;1921) and <a name="cosubject_32773"></a><span class="headword">Sir Thomas Andros  de la Rue</span>, first baronet  (1849&#150;1911)<span class="occ"></span>, both of whom had joined the firm on finishing their education. From the 1870s to the 1890s the firm built on existing foundations, again acquiring new property to meet orders from the crown agents and the Board of Inland Revenue, who in 1879 gave De La Rue the order for the 1<i>d</i>. stamp, thus putting the country's entire postage stamp business into their hands. As in the past, production was backed by research, to prove, for example, that the red ink used on the penny stamp was not harmful. The continued growth probably owed much to Warren's presence, for after his retirement in 1880 and death in 1889 the picture changed considerably.<br>
<br>Warren de la Rue's sons showed strong family loyalty, helping at home when their father was ill, but their contrasting personalities&#151;William Warren pedantic and humourless and Thomas Andros urbane and extrovert&#151;were markedly less successful in business than their father and uncle, though Warren William's thoroughness at least protected the firm's interests for a time. Accounts differ on how long Warren William remained active in the firm; it seems likely, however, that his involvement diminished after a riding accident in 1896, if not before, and that Thomas Andros was effectively in control of the business after their father's death. On 1 February 1876 he married Emily Maria Speed (1848&#150;1904), with whom he had three sons; he conducted a glittering social life with a passion for theatre and parties. In 1898 he was made a baronet (in recognition of his work as governor of the Royal Chest Hospital) and he turned the firm into a public company, with most of the shares owned by the family and friends. Having inherited a spectacularly successful business, Thomas Andros proceeded to run it with complacency and short-sightedness, caring less for the welfare of staff and more for profit. His attitude towards major customers suggests some of the first Thomas's stubbornness, but without his drive towards invention and investment to develop new lines and maintain the firm's competitive edge. Thomas Andros alienated two crucial clients: the relationship with the crown agents deteriorated, and the Inland Revenue became concerned about De La Rue's monopoly of stamp production, noting that their prices did not fall to reflect cheaper manufacturing costs. In 1911 the Inland Revenue proposed splitting their contract between De La Rue and Harrisons; there may also have been a request that De La Rue lower their prices: either way, Thomas Andros refused to compromise, and the whole contract went to Harrisons.<br>
<br>This major loss was the start of a serious decline in the fortunes of the De La Rue firm. Thomas Andros died a few months later, at 52 Cadogan Square, London, on 10 April 1911, leaving the business in the hands of his sons, Evelyn, Ivor, and Stuart. They inherited a diminished empire and their lack of flair and harmony failed to restore it. Though the scarcity of gold during the First World War led to contracts for printing 10<i>s</i>. and &pound;1 notes, these orders were shared with another firm, Waterlow Brothers and Leighton; Stuart de la Rue entered into a dubious arrangement with a third company, Waterlow &amp; Sons, with mutual promises of financial compensation should either receive future contracts. His two older brothers having joined the army, Stuart was left in charge, recklessly acquiring new and unprofitable businesses. By 1921 De La Rue was approaching bankruptcy: ten years after the loss of the Inland Revenue contract Stuart repeated his father's stubborn short-sightedness and lost the government's postal and stationery business for India because he was not prepared to set up a printing office there. Two years later, in 1923, a court battle with the now combined Waterlow firms culminated in public scandal when it emerged that Thomas Andros had long since had a private agreement with Waterlows to share out remuneration from postal contracts. Unable to restore confidence, his youngest son was now forced to leave, ending the family's control of the firm.<br>
<br>Under new management, retrenchment was eventually followed by the revival, marked by the establishment of a prestigious annual dinner in 1932, and the negotiation of substantial and lucrative banknote contracts from the minister of finance in China. In 1939, with war again imminent, De La Rue undertook to safeguard this production by building printing works in Shanghai and Rangoon, rediscovering the initiative which had been evident in the 1840s and which would again carry them forwards. By the start of the twenty-first century the firm still bearing the family name De La Rue has become the world's largest commercial security printer, operating internationally to provide currency for over 150 countries, cash-handling systems, and security documents. With this dynamism in developing technology and searching out new business, the modern firm still bears witness to the legacy of its founding father, Thomas, and his sons Warren and William Frederick.<br>
