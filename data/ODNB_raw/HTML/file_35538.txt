<span class="headword">Plater,  Charles Dominic</span>  (1875&#150;1921), <span class="occ">Roman Catholic priest and social worker</span>, was born at Brook Green, London, on 2 September 1875, the third son and youngest child of Edward Angelo Plater and his wife, Margaret Harting. His paternal grandfather, Charles Edward Plater (who was of Polish ancestry), was co-founder of Marlborough College; his father, who resigned a War Office clerkship in 1878 in order to devote himself to music, had been received into the Roman Catholic church in 1851 by John Henry Newman. The Harting family, which had always remained Catholic, was distinguished in historical research and natural science. Hereditary qualities&#151;Christian zeal, sense of scholarship, unconventional geniality, love of music, and especially the brilliancy, controlled emotionalism, and intuition of his maternal grandmother, a Scotswoman&#151;were startlingly visible in Charles Plater. One brother was a stockbroker; another manufactured bicycles in Paris. His sister joined the Sisters of Charity.<br>
<br>At Stonyhurst College, where he was educated from 1887 to 1894, Plater was precociously clever and an audacious leader; he might have become a journalist, actor, or diplomat. He records that at the age of three he wanted to be a priest, at five a clown, but, sincerely pious, he entered the Jesuit noviciate at Manresa College, Roehampton, in 1894. After four years spent there as a novice and studying the classics, he pursued philosophical studies for two years at St Mary's Hall, the Jesuit seminary at Stonyhurst.<br>
<br>In 1900 Plater went to his order's house of studies, Pope's Hall (afterwards Campion Hall), at Oxford. A second class in classical moderations (1902), and in Greats (1904), rewarded him accurately; but scientific archaeology disciplined his imagination, and vacations in the Netherlands, Belgium, and France enriched his sympathies and revealed his vocation&#151;namely to foster and apply Catholic social principles in England and to create a system of spiritual &#145;retreats&#146; for the laity, especially for working men.<br>
<br>While finishing his philosophical studies and subsequently teaching classics at St Mary's Hall (1904&#150;07), Plater displayed much journalistic endeavour and became connected with every kind of Catholic social work. During four years of theological studies in Wales, at St Beuno's College, St Asaph (1907&#150;11), he was influential in the opening of retreat houses and the foundation of the Catholic Social Guild&#151;a remarkable achievement for one who was not yet a priest and was stationed in the remote countryside. Plater was ordained in 1910, and in 1911 went to St Stanislaus College, Tullabeg, Ireland, where he remained until the following year. From 1912 to 1915 he taught psychology and philosophy at Stonyhurst, the next year classics at Wimbledon College. In 1916 he was appointed master of the Jesuit hall at Oxford. In 1918 he obtained a university statute to convert his hall into a &#145;permanent private hall&#146; of Oxford University, and it then took the name Campion Hall; the Benedictines of Ampleforth were granted the same status for their St Benet's. Plater took an energetic share in the social work of Oxford. He also visited his own Catholic Social Guild study circles, especially on Tyneside and in the north, and did creative work in many military centres, labouring not least for colonial and American soldiers. At the same time he conducted a very large number of retreats and wrote constantly on social subjects, his <span class="italic">Primer of Peace and War</span> (1915) being his best-thought-out book. His personal influence, especially among the working classes, seemed unlimited and his remarkable output of work was matched by the affection which he inspired. Even as a boy the intensity of his exertions caused him mental strain, and finally his health broke down in 1920. After a useless sojourn in the west of Ireland, Plater went to Malta in November of that year. While visiting the sick at the Blue Sisters' Hospital in Sliema, he died of a cerebral haemorrhage on 21 January 1921. He was buried two days later at the Addolorata cemetery. The former Catholic Workers' College in Oxford was renamed Plater College in his memory.<br>
