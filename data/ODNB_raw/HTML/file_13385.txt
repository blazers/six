<span class="headword">Hoare, Sir  Richard</span>  (1648&#150;1719), <span class="occ">banker</span>, was the only child of Henry Hoare (<i>d</i>. 1699), a horse-dealer of Smithfield, and his wife, Cicely (<i>d</i>. 1679). His parents were resident in the City of London parish of St Botolph, Aldersgate. Nothing is known of Hoare's childhood until 9 June 1665 when he was apprenticed for seven years to the goldsmith Richard Moore, who died before the end of Hoare's term. Hoare was then &#145;turned over&#146; to Robert Tempest at the sign of the Golden Bottle in Cheapside. He was admitted to the freedom of the Goldsmiths' Company on 5 July 1672, the date considered to mark the foundation of Hoare's Bank. Tempest's death in November 1673 gave Hoare the opportunity to buy his business and operate on his own account in earnest.<br>
<br>Hoare married Susanna, daughter of John Austen (<i>d</i>. 1670) of Brittens, Essex, on 27 July 1672 in the chapel of Lincoln's Inn. They lived in the parish of St Mary Woolnoth, where their first child, also Richard, was born on 24 May 1673. Hoare and his wife had seventeen children, ten of whom died in infancy.<br>
<br>The early goldsmiths' books reveal that Hoare contracted out much of the plate and jewellery trade, and from the start acted as banker to his customers. He kept &#145;running cashes&#146; and opened named accounts, honouring drawn notes and issuing receipts. He took money on deposit, and lent at interest. In the autumn of 1690, he moved his business to Fleet Street, to premises formerly called the Golden Hinde, which he renamed the Golden Bottle. He acquired the goodwill of a goldsmith's shop already on the site and added to its customers a list of established clients he had brought from Cheapside.<br>
<br>Hoare was in an excellent position to attract good customers in London and the country. Many were distinguished in their own fields, and all were looked after assiduously by Hoare, as Lord Ashburnham testified: &#145;Upon all occasions [you] have so eminently showed your affection, care and diligence in promoting the wellfare and interest of mee and myne &hellip; I shall never be wanting nor shall those that belong to mee&#146;  (Ashburnham to Hoare, 12 May 1698, Hoare's Bank Archives). Until 1702, when he was joined by his son <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/47085/', "Henry Hoare (1677&#150;1725)")</script>, Hoare worked alone, except for the assistance of three clerks. He was a good judge of investments and his standing among City financiers was high, which no doubt assisted his progress in his career as public servant. He was appointed a receiver for the <span class="roman">Salt Duty Act</span> (1694) and for the <span class="roman">Malt Duty Act</span> (1697), and began his political career in the tory interest by his election to the aldermanic bench for Bread Street ward in 1703. He was elected sheriff in 1708 and attained the office of lord mayor, by seniority, in 1712. In that year he also became one of the founding directors of the South Sea Company.<br>
<br>Queen Anne conferred on him a knighthood on her visit to the Guildhall on 29 October 1702; and Hoare secured her privy purse account through the offices of her lady-in-waiting, his friend Lady Abigail Masham (<i>d</i>. 1734), whose daughter Anne was to be the first wife of Hoare's grandson, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/37552/', "Henry Hoare (1705&#150;1785)")</script>. Interested in the development of his native city, Hoare presided over Christ's Hospital from 1713 to 1719 and over the London workhouse, and served as prime warden of the Goldsmiths' Company (1703&#150;4), and as one of the committee for building fifty new churches in London. He finally succeeded in gaining a seat in parliament in 1710, representing the City of London until 1715. Hoare provided Robert Harley's administration with advice and financial aid, but his support waned over the issue of protecting British trade interests during the War of the Spanish Succession. He joined Sir Francis Child (1642&#150;1713) and other goldsmith bankers in opposition to the whig-sponsored Bank of England, and published his objections to its foundation (1694) and to the renewal of its charter (1707)  (<span class="italic">The Anatomy of Exchequer Alley</span>, 16 March 1707). Never allowing politics to be an obstacle to good business, however, he welcomed two of the directors as bank customers. A high-church Anglican, he privately supported the tory preacher and pamphleteer Dr Sacheverell, but while serving as sheriff Hoare was instrumental in the suppression of the published text of the sermon Sacheverell had delivered at St Paul's Cathedral on 5 November 1709.<br>
<br>Hoare succeeded in establishing an enduring private banking dynasty, but in his lifetime his ambition for four of his sons was that they should be established abroad in the merchant service with a special interest in the diamond trade. He was a conscientious father and a diligent correspondent, offering encouragement as well as strict advice; but his entreaties to his sons abroad to acquire good business habits were doomed to fail, and their incapacity, allied with a wartime depression in the trade, laid waste his plans. His eldest son Richard was perpetually in debt to his father, and so his second surviving son, Henry, became his heir, inheriting the business with his brother Benjamin (1693&#150;1750).<br>
<br>Seldom at leisure, Hoare nevertheless enjoyed his country house at Hendon and took an interest in its furnishing and garden. By the terms of his marriage settlement he bought an estate in Staplehurst, Kent, where subsequent generations of his family were to settle. From his father he inherited a lifelong interest in horses, and hunted into middle age. Early in 1718 Hoare was taken ill, and he died at Hendon on 6 January 1719. His funeral, on 13 January, at St Dunstan-in-the-West, opposite his banking house, was attended by a great number of people of all ranks. He was buried there, and a monument, designed by Thomas Stayner, was subsequently erected by his heir. His wife, Susanna, survived him.<br>
<br>Sir Richard's bank at the sign of the Golden Bottle acquired a reputation as one of the most conservative and solid of the West End banking houses. Although he was himself unequivocally a mercantile figure, his son Henry and grandson Henry became landed proprietors as well as bankers, and were responsible for the creation of the gardens at Stourhead. Another grandson, <a name="cosubject_13386"></a><span class="headword">Sir Richard Hoare</span>  (1709&#150;1754), <span class="occ">banker</span>, was lord mayor of London at the time of the Jacobite rebellion in 1745, and was knighted on 31 October 1745. He married Sarah Tully (<i>d</i>. 1736) in 1732, and, after her death, Elizabeth Rust (<i>d</i>. 1752) in 1737; he had two sons and two daughters. The younger Sir Richard died on 12 October 1754, and was buried in the family vault in St Dunstan-in-the-West.<br>
