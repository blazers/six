<span class="headword">Seton, Sir  John</span>, Lord Barns  (<em>c.</em>1553&#150;1594), <span class="occ">judge</span>, was the third son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25121/', "George Seton, fifth Lord Seton (c.1530&#150;1586)")</script>, and his wife, Isabel (<i>c</i>.1529&#150;1604), daughter of Sir William Hamilton of Sanquhar. His father was a Catholic, and John Seton, despite acknowledging the government of James VI in April 1573, also continued to be associated with the Catholic interest and was excommunicated by the kirk. During the mid-1570s he visited the court of Philip II of Spain, where he was made a knight of the royal order of Santiago and a gentleman of the king's chamber.<br>
<br>Seton returned to Scotland in 1579 and suffered imprisonment at the hands of the earl of Morton's government. On Morton's fall at the end of 1580, Seton found favour with King James. He was sent to complain to Elizabeth I about her interfering on Morton's behalf, but was refused entry into England. On 9 May 1581 he was formally appointed by James VI as &#145;principall maister of all his hienes horsis and stabillis, cure, reull and ordour thairof&#146; for life  (Donaldson, 45). He opposed the ultra-protestant Ruthven raid in 1582, and in 1583 was employed as an envoy to Spain; in December that year he was included in royal letters of protection. His father granted him a charter for the barony of Barns on 10 May 1583.<br>
<br>In the late 1580s Seton's promotion was rapid: James VI made him on 3 January 1587 first master of the king's household, as well as admitting him on 27 January to membership of the privy council, and, in March of that year he was nominated ambassador to Spain. On 17 February 1588 he was appointed an extraordinary lord of session, with the title Lord Barns, replacing his brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25113/', "Alexander Seton, afterwards first earl of Dunfermline")</script>. Sir John married Anne, youngest daughter of William, seventh Lord Forbes, on 10 September 1588, at the house of Lord Ogilvie, an occasion attended by a number of Catholic lords. He died on 25 May 1594. His son and heir, Sir John Seton, became a gentleman of the privy chamber to Charles I; he also left an illegitimate son, Hannibal.<br>
