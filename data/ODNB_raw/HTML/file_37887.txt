<span class="headword">Smith, Sir  George  Reeves-</span>  (1863&#150;1941), <span class="occ">hotelier</span>, was born in Scarborough, Yorkshire, on 17 July 1863, one of at least two sons of George Reeves-Smith, who was for a time manager of the Brighton aquarium. Educated at Brighton College, Reeves-Smith was apprenticed to Bordeaux wine merchants, Jean Calvert &amp; Co., before training in the hotel industry. About 1890 he was appointed manager of the Victoria Hotel, Northumberland Avenue, London. By 1893 he was manager of the Berkeley Hotel, Piccadilly, which he subsequently purchased by forming a small syndicate in 1897, taking for himself the office of managing director.<br>
<br>Richard D'Oyly Carte, founder of the Savoy Hotel, sought to rebuild his management team after the departure of C&eacute;sar Ritz and Auguste Escoffier. To secure the services of Reeves-Smith, he purchased the Berkeley Hotel in 1900 and appointed him managing director of the Savoy Company. Reeves-Smith held this office, together with that of vice-chairman of the Savoy Company, from 1916 until his death.<br>
<br>Reeves-Smith's style of management was precise, for he was aware of the slightest derogation from high standards of housekeeping or service; yet he was innovative and capable of masterly delegation. Although apparently punctilious and conservative in manner and dress, he had a shrewd business appreciation of practical detail and people's tastes in leisure activities. Some idea of his skill may be gained from <span class="italic">Imperial Palace</span> (1930), a novel by Arnold Bennett based on the author's knowledge of the Savoy and its chief executive, and dedicated to Reeves-Smith.<br>
<br>Reeves-Smith founded the Hotels and Restaurants Association (1910) and was chairman of its executive (1910&#150;41) and of its council (1931&#150;41). He was connected with several industry-wide associations and committees, as well as being chairman of the London coronation accommodation committee (1937). He was involved in the Preston Hall settlement for tuberculous ex-servicemen in Aylesford, Kent (1919&#150;25), and the British Sanatorium in Montana-Vermala, Switzerland. He was knighted in 1938 for service to the hotel industry, and in the same year he was made a chevalier of the L&eacute;gion d'honneur. In 1939 he became a knight commander of the Order of the Crown of Italy.<br>
<br>On 16 August 1888 Reeves-Smith married Maud, daughter of Charles Hindle, a Brighton hotelier. They had a son, who was killed in the First World War, and a daughter. They lived in rooms, first in the Berkeley, then at Claridge's (also part of the Savoy group of hotels). Reeves-Smith was an inveterate buyer of books, and it was said that he bought a hotel in Seaford, Sussex, to accommodate his library. He died from pneumonia on 29 May 1941 in his rooms at Claridge's, survived by his wife.<br>
