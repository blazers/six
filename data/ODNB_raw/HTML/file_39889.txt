<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Caccia,  Harold Anthony</span>, Baron Caccia  (1905&#150;1990), <span class="occ">diplomatist</span>, was born on 21 December 1905 in Pachmarhi, India, the only child of Anthony Mario Felix Caccia, of the Indian forest service, and his wife, Fanny Theodora, daughter of Azim Salvador Birch, of Erewhon and Oruamatua, New Zealand. Caccia's great-grandfather had fled to England from Lombardy as a political refugee in 1826. Caccia went to Eton College, where he was a popular all-rounder, and then to Trinity College, Oxford, where he gained a rugby blue and second-class honours in philosophy, politics, and economics (1927). In 1928 he won a Laming travelling fellowship from Queen's College, Oxford.<br>
<br>Caccia entered the Foreign Office in 1929 and was appointed third secretary at Peking (Beijing) in 1932. Also in that year he married Anne Catherine (Nancy), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30624/', "Sir George Lewis Barstow")</script>, civil servant. He returned to London in 1935 as a second secretary and, from 1936, as assistant private secretary to the secretary of state until, in 1939, he was transferred to Athens. Driven from Athens in 1941, the Caccias with the embassy wives and children and some commandos, including Oliver Barstow, his wife's brother, had a perilous journey. Their ship was bombed <i>en route</i> to Crete, and Barstow was killed. They reached Crete in another small craft and a destroyer took them to Cairo. Caccia was appointed in 1943 to the staff of the resident minister in north Africa, Harold Macmillan, at Algiers. He soon moved to Italy as vice-president of the Allied Control Commission, and political adviser to General Harold Alexander. In 1944 he became the political adviser to the general officer commanding British land forces in Greece, and was in the embassy during the communist uprising in Athens in December 1944. Caccia was in his element in a military environment, and got on well with the allied commanders. In 1945 he became minister at the Athens embassy, before returning to the Foreign Office as chief clerk in 1949. In this post he was instrumental in putting into effect the administrative reforms which Anthony Eden had announced in 1943.<br>
<br>In 1950 Caccia went to Austria, then still under four-power administration, first as minister, then as British high commissioner, and finally as ambassador from 1951 to 1954. He was again in his element in Austria, <i>persona grata</i> to the allied military commanders and popular with the Austrian authorities. For relaxation he pursued chamois in the mountains. In 1956 he became British ambassador in Washington. After the Suez d&eacute;b&acirc;cle, communications between the two governments were virtually suspended. In spite of his earlier relationship with the US president, Caccia received a frosty reception. However, after Harold Macmillan became prime minister normal relations were rapidly restored, and there were no further crises during his mission. A major success was the resumption of full co-operation on atomic energy in 1958, and the relationship was further enhanced by an official visit by the queen. Caccia soon got back on excellent terms with the administration and became a respected and popular figure in the United States.<br>
<br>In 1962 Caccia became permanent under-secretary of state, and in 1964 head of the diplomatic service until his retirement in 1965. He was appointed CMG (1945), KCMG (1950), GCMG (1959), and GCVO (1961). In 1965 he was created a life peer as Baron Caccia. He took the arms of his Florentine ancestors.<br>
<br>From 1965 to 1977 Caccia was provost of Eton, and he also accepted many outside appointments in banking, finance, industry, and insurance. He was director of the National Westminster Bank, chairman of the Orion Bank, a director of the Foreign and Colonial Investment and European trusts, director of the Prudential, chairman of Standard Telephones and Cables and of ITT (UK) Ltd, and a member of the advisory council of Foseco Minsep plc. He was chairman of the Gabbitas Thring educational trust, a member of the advisory committee on public records, and chairman of the Marylebone Cricket Club. In 1969 he became first chancellor and then lord prior of the order of St John of Jerusalem. He was a regular attender at the House of Lords, where he sat on the cross benches, speaking mainly on foreign affairs. He was chairman of the Anglo-Austrian Society and became an honorary fellow of Trinity College, Oxford, in 1963, and of Queen's College, Oxford, in 1974.<br>
<br>In appearance Caccia was short, stocky, and bald with a fair complexion. He was forthright in speech and energetic in action, and he retained throughout his life a cheerful and light-hearted, almost boyish, manner, which concealed a serious and thoughtful disposition. He was a good administrator and universally popular in all that he undertook. He ended as he had begun, as a great all-rounder.<br>
<br>Caccia was happy in his family life and he and his wife were a devoted couple. They had two daughters and one son. But his latter years were saddened by the untimely death of his son, David, in 1983. Caccia died of cancer at his home, Aber-nant, Builth Wells, Brecknockshire, on 31 October 1990.<br>
