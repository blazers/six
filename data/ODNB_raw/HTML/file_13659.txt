<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Hone,  William</span>  (1780&#150;1842), <span class="occ">political writer and publisher</span>, was born on 3 June 1780 at Bath, the first child of William Hone (1755&#150;1831) and his wife, Frances Maria Stawell (<i>d</i>. 1833).<h2>
<a name="Backgroundandearlylife"></a>Background and early life</h2>Little is known of Hone's mother. Hone's father was the eldest son of a farmer from Surrey, who, after an apprenticeship with a law stationer and a short-lived ambition to act in the theatre, became a clerk, initially to a solicitor, then to a corn merchant in Bath. Hone was baptized on 26 August in the parish of St James, and in 1783 the family moved to London in order that Hone's father, a devout Calvinist Methodist, could attend the congregation of the well-known preacher William Huntington. They lived first in Grafton Street, Paddington, then briefly in Tottenham Court Road, before settling in Warren Street, while Hone's father resumed his career as a solicitor's clerk. The environment of Hone's early years, spent on the edge of a rapidly expanding London, allowed him to witness the poverty of urban life alongside the rural scenery of nearby dairy farms and Hampstead Heath. His parents taught him to read from the <span class="roman">Bible</span> (although Hone claimed his first book was &#145;Nature&#146;), and before he was six he was sent to a local dame-school, where he showed an aptitude for reading. At seven he was sent to a day school for boys, and shortly afterwards contracted a dangerous smallpox; this, followed by another move&#151;to Old North Street, Red Lion Square&#151;led to a cessation of his formal education. At twelve he attended another boys' school for a short period before a bullying incident led his father to remove him permanently. Thereafter the only instruction he received was from his father and his own reading.<br>
<br>Hone's love of books was evident from an early age. His home held only a few devout volumes, but he garnered reading material from a variety of sources, saving his meagre pocket money in order to buy secondhand copies, borrowing books from friendly booksellers and neighbours, gathering odd sheets from printers, and even collecting old printed papers used for wrapping. In 1792, at the age of twelve, he witnessed the arrest of Thomas Spence for allegedly selling Paine's <span class="italic">Rights of Man</span>, an event prefiguring his future persecution as a champion of the free press. At this time, however, Hone's incipient politics were conservative, and in 1793, encouraged by his parents, he wrote an anti-Jacobin poem comparing the liberties of England to the tyrannies of revolutionary France, which was privately printed as a single sheet. Its distribution brought small gifts of money from admirers. In the same year Hone began employment as a solicitor's assistant before becoming a clerk in the office which his father supervised, and then, in turn, a clerk to a solicitor named Pelletti. Hone held this position until he was seventeen, when his father arranged for him to take up a similar post in Chatham, probably as a result of his worries about the political and social life which his son was developing: Hone had become infatuated with the theatre, interested in Unitarianism and subsequently intrigued by rationalism, a member of the London Corresponding Society, and a follower of Holcroft and Godwin. His exile was short-lived. He returned to London the next year, took lodgings at Lambeth, and on 19 July 1800 married his landlady's daughter, Sarah Johnson (1781&#150;1864). With the help of Sarah's mother he set up as a bookseller and stationer with a circulating library on Lambeth Walk.<h2>
<a name="Earlypublishingandphilanthropicventures"></a>Early publishing and philanthropic ventures</h2>Hone's life in business was always a struggle, and a large family compounded his difficulties: the first of his thirteen children was born in 1801. Bankrupted twice, and permanently beset by debt, he spent the greater part of the next thirty years engaged in publishing ventures ranging from outright flops to popular successes, but he was never able to convert the latter into significant financial gain. About 1806 he became involved in an elaborate and ambitious scheme known as &#145;tranquillity&#146;, and inaugurated by John Bone, one-time secretary of the London Corresponding Society. This aimed to end the poor law by establishing a fund by subscription to provide for the deserving poor. Bone, together with the radical publisher J. S. Jordan, also set up the Society for the Gradual Abolition of the Poor's Rate, and Hone acted as the secretary. The venture collapsed within a year. In 1808, a year in which a severe bout of rheumatic fever led Hone to learn to write with his left hand, he went into partnership with Bone to take over Jordan's publishing and bookselling business. Until 1810, when the business went bankrupt, they were active in publishing reformist works, and in providing support for the financial backing of the &#145;Old Price&#146; riots against an increase in theatre admission prices in 1809. These activities drew Hone into the Westminster circle of reformists and radicals, an association which lasted some ten years, and led to his friendship with Francis Place, and his acquaintance with Bentham, Mill, and John Cam Hobhouse, among others. In 1810 Hone was prominent among organizers of the triumphal procession planned to accompany Sir Francis Burdett's release from the Tower of London, following his controversial confinement there by the House of Commons on a breach of privilege charge (Burdett's case had become a focal point for the radical cause, and a large crowd had gathered along the route planned by Hone and his associates, only to be disappointed by Burdett's decision to take a quiet exit route along the Thames). By the end of 1810 Hone's family were living with his wife's mother, while he opened a small bookshop in Bloomsbury. By 1811 Hone was a trade auctioneer in Ludgate Hill, but his continuing impecuniosity forced the whole family to move into the Old Bailey, whence Hone contributed articles to such publications as the <span class="italic">Critical Review</span> and the <span class="italic">British Lady's Magazine</span> as a means of securing some income.<br>
<br>Hone's strong public-spirited and reformist tendencies are evident in his campaign of 1814 to improve the condition of lunatic asylums. Together with Edward Wakefield and James Bevans the architect, he formed a self-appointed and voluntary committee to investigate asylums and present a report to parliament. The committee simply visited asylums and compiled an account of what they saw. Their most famous exposure was that of William Norris, confined in Bethlem Hospital for twelve years with an elaborate system of chains and manacles permitting only minimal movement. Wakefield presented the report to a selected group of MPs while Hone extracted the illustration of Norris and published it priced at a shilling. The etching was by George Cruikshank, and it marks the beginning of Hone's fruitful partnership with this famous caricaturist and illustrator. Hone's efforts were undoubtedly influential in the subsequent asylum reforms. Following the case of Norris, he espoused two other famous causes in 1814 and 1815: that of Lord Cochrane, who had been tried and convicted of alleged fraud in 1814 as a result (it was widely believed) of his reformist politics and his anti-Admiralty stance; and that of Elizabeth Fenning, who was convicted and hanged for attempted murder. Hone took a major part in the Cochrane affair, collecting a public subscription to pay his &pound;1000 fine.<br>
<br>The case of Fenning&#151;who was convicted on circumstantial evidence&#151;attracted large public sympathy. Before she was hanged Hone was active in compiling a petition for mercy; after the event, he published accounts of the case and a hurriedly produced but highly successful satirical pamphlet with illustrations by Cruikshank, based on a popular drama showing at the time, entitled <span class="italic">The Maid and the Magpie</span>. In 1815 Hone also witnessed the shooting of a corn-law rioter, Edward Vyse. Having become editor of the <span class="italic">Critical Review</span> in the previous year, Hone used the journal to publicize this brutality, and made other political critiques. This led to his dismissal in June 1815, and the loss of a salary. Undeterred as ever, Hone went on to lend his support to the lord mayor, Matthew Wood, in his exposure of the spy network and blood money system in London.<h2>
<a name="Theblasphemytrialsof1817"></a>The blasphemy trials of 1817</h2>December 1817 marked Hone's moment of eminence, for it was then that he was put on trial for blasphemy, in one of the great case histories of all blasphemy trials. The provocation was three parodies written and published by him in 1817: <span class="italic">The Late John Wilkes's Catechism of a Ministerial Member</span>, <span class="italic">The Political Litany Diligently Revised to be Said or Sung until the Appointed Change Come</span>, and <span class="italic">The Sinecurists' Creed or Belief, as the Same Can or May be Said</span>. The trials&#151;a separate trial for each publication&#151;attracted enormous publicity, and they were clearly a strategic and malicious attempt by the government to make an example of Hone, who, at this time, may have seemed an easy target. Although reasonably well known, he was not regarded as among the most dangerous of radicals. He had placed himself&#151;with some political acumen&#151;apart from the ultra-radicals in 1816 when he distributed posters advising against carrying arms at the time of the Spa Fields riots, and he was not, unlike many radicals of his time, a great public speaker. Nevertheless, he had begun publishing the <span class="italic">Reformists' Register</span> in February 1817, and he had entered the controversy surrounding the suspension of habeas corpus in 1817, which had been provoked by a stone thrown at the regent's carriage in January. The stone was at first adjudged to be a bullet, and the event, therefore, an assassination attempt, and this in turn had called forth a form of thanksgiving that was published and read in churches. Hone's quick-witted response was another parody of litany entitled <span class="italic">The Bullet Te Deum</span>, a publication not included in the charges against him, almost certainly because the affair had become so farcical.<br>
<br>Hone knew he was being watched. He withdrew his parodies, and when seditious materials were planted on his premises, he simply took them up and handed them in at the Treasury. Yet on 3 May 1817 he was arrested on grounds of blasphemy and sedition, and was brought before Lord Ellenborough, the lord chief justice, who demanded that he plea without seeing a copy of the indictment. A punitively high bail was set at &pound;2000, and Hone was sent to await trial in prison. He was released on 2 July after protests against the grounds of his arrest and amid challenges to special juries (generally acknowledged to be packed) by Charles Pearson, a young lawyer acting on his behalf. The campaign against special juries continued in the <span class="italic">Reformists' Register</span>. In November 1817 the case against Hone was reinstated, and the first trial was set for 18 December. Hone elected to speak for himself, a decision that brought with it the entitlements to call witnesses, cross-examine, and review the case for the jury. The courtroom was full to the brim with a large crowd outside; <span class="italic">The Times</span> gave a figure of 20,000. Most of the special jury did not arrive, and unvetted jurors were therefore conscripted.<br>
<br>The three trials were&#151;vindictively&#151;held on successive days and Hone was acquitted at each one. Justice Abbot presided over the first, and was promptly replaced on the bench by Ellenborough himself for the second and third, a ploy which increased the prosecution's humiliation, as also did the attorney-general's decision to go on to a subsequent trial after each acquittal. Hone's defence in each case was quite simple, although all accounts of the trials testify to his masterly control and strong sense of theatre. Shabbily dressed, and surrounded by literary evidence, he complained purposefully that his trial was unjust because he was not allowed to see the indictment without paying an extortionate fee. He claimed that parodies were of two kinds: those that ridiculed the form imitated, and those that, like his own, used the form as a means of ridiculing another subject. As he had been charged with blasphemy and not sedition, he found himself in the unique position of being able to frame his defence against a vituperative government by claiming that it, and not religion, was the subject of his ridicule. Further, he remarked on the number of parodies of scripture and litany in a vast range of literary and other texts, including those of Canning, the anti-Jacobin poet&#151;who, ironically, sat in the ministry that endorsed Hone's persecution. Quoting extensively, and rising in confidence though ailing in health as each trial proceeded, Hone won three unmitigated victories and stated that he stood not just for himself but for &#145;the liberty of the press&#146;. His exoneration was celebrated wildly and vigorously by a London public fired up by the transparency of vituperative government tactics, and delighted by Hone's unlikely virtuoso performance in court. The trials also stood for the restitution of the credibility of the jury system, each concluding with shouts of &#145;Long live an honest jury! An honest jury for ever!&#146; Hone was therefore acclaimed as champion of the people's rights on a dual account.<h2>
<a name="Laterpublishingventures"></a>Later publishing ventures</h2>Following the trials came rallies of support for Hone in the form of visits from eminent sympathizers, contributions of money, press coverage, and a proliferation of popular literature about the trials themselves and the discomfited ministers. On 29 December a public meeting for the &#145;Friends of Liberty of the Press and Trial by Jury&#146; was held at the London tavern, organized by Robert Waithman, who had assisted Hone with the asylum project, and was later to become lord mayor. The meeting set up a subscription list for Hone which excited a national response, and the money he received allowed him to move his household to 45 Ludgate Hill, where he set up in business. Hone was now famous, and the subsequent publishing ventures brought in sales but not financial security. He sought now to set himself up as a publisher of collectable editions as well as popular items. To this end, he proposed to develop his antiquarian interests by investigating the collections in the British Museum, and made an application for access in 1818 that was granted in 1820. The <span class="italic">Trials</span> themselves were published early in 1818, and in February 1819 Hone announced his most ambitious project to date: an edition of the <span class="italic">Trials</span> that would also serve as a history of parody, providing full versions of all the parodies cited in his defence. An extensive library of materials for this history was collected by Hone, and was auctioned in 1827 when he was imprisoned for debt: the publication was never finished. <span class="italic">The Political House that Jack Built</span> (1814), however, was highly successful, with sales in excess of 100,000 copies in fifty-four editions. This satire, a response in part to the atrocities of Peterloo, was a poem by Hone based on the similarly fitted nursery rhyme, accompanied by thirteen woodcuts by Cruikshank. An attack on Liverpool's cabinet (specifically Canning, Castlereagh, and Sidmouth), the regent, and other well-known figures of the day involved in government repression (such as Robert Gifford, the attorney-general from July 1819), the parody extolled the virtues of a free press and reform as guardians of a traditional British liberty. The piece is carefully pitched, like so much of Hone's work. The levity established in the nursery-rhyme structure provided a protection against prosecution, which necessarily would invoke trivia and farce. Simultaneously, the parody is vehemently critical of its targets, of the violent oppression of the people, and uncompromising in its defence of a subversive free press.<br>
<br>In the same year Hone and Cruikshank collaborated on an imitation of a &pound;1 note, entitled the <span class="italic">Bank Restriction Note</span>, a copper-plate engraving displaying a line of figures on the gallows. The note was an attack on the legislation which permitted the death penalty for the forging or passing of imitation paper money, a law which was popularly deemed too savage given the temptations involved and the opportunity for the persecution of innocent people, including children. The note attracted much attention, as too did another joint parodic production, <span class="italic">A Slap at Slop and the Bridge Street Gang</span> (1820), a burlesque of John Stoddart's newspaper, the <span class="italic">New Times</span>. Stoddart had attempted to influence the jury in Hone's trials by circulating false reports that someone had been tried and convicted for publishing Hone's parodies. <span class="italic">A Slap at Slop</span> (&#145;Slop&#146; being Hone's nickname for Stoddart) was his revenge, much of the imitation being taken up by mischievous mockery of the newspaper itself, and a good proportion dedicated to a vicious biography of Stoddart. The years from 1819 to 1822 were perhaps Hone's most prolific period as a political satirist, during which he published such popular successes as <span class="italic">The Queen's Matrimonial Ladder</span>, <span class="italic">Hone's Political Showman&#151;at Home!</span>, and <span class="italic">Buonapartephobia</span>.<br>
<br>Hone had always nurtured a scholarly antiquarianism alongside his politics. In 1820 and then again in 1823 he published two books with impacts in both fields, raising questions about biblical canonicity: <span class="italic">The Apocryphal New Testament</span> and <span class="italic">Ancient Mysteries Described</span>. He wryly claimed that his interest in the medieval mystery plays was stimulated by a comment by Lord Ellenborough about them at his trial. Investigating the manuscripts at the British Museum led to the discovery of the little-known <span class="roman">New Testament</span> apocrypha, which he very rapidly published, to the great discomfort of Christian orthodoxy; the book had a stormy reception. <span class="italic">Ancient Mysteries Described</span> was less controversial, but by no means innocent: both books constituted a challenge to the limits of knowledge, and in particular scriptural knowledge. Hone was also accused of stepping beyond his class position in his invasion of theology, an exclusive field of scholarship.<br>
<br>However, these controversial books mark Hone's passage into the more generally acceptable antiquarian publishing activities which led to his fame in the nineteenth century, in the form of the <span class="italic">Everyday Book</span> (1825), the <span class="italic">Table Book</span> (1827), and the <span class="italic">Year Book</span> (1832). Admired by Southey and Dickens among others, these works began as weekly publications before being bound into volumes. Each was a miscellany, including short articles from various contributors including Hone on fairs and customs, folklore, memories, accounts of urban rambles or travels, trade and working practices, natural history, and local life. There were also illustrations from a variety of sources. These publications were at once popular, educational, quaint, and socially pertinent. They constructed an inclusive readership not restricted by class boundaries, and they were affordable.<h2>
<a name="FinalyearsconversiontoChristianity"></a>Final years: conversion to Christianity</h2>As ever, Hone's sensitivity to the public taste was not matched by his financial abilities. In April 1826 he was arrested for debt, evicted from Ludgate Hill, and placed under the rules of the king's bench prison requiring him to live in Southwark, where he remained with his family until declared bankrupt in 1828, when he moved to Newington Green. Friends and benefactors then raised a sum to help the Hone family set up in a coffee house in Gracechurch Street near London Bridge which opened in April 1830, and ran for three years before the inevitable bankruptcy. Thereafter the family went to live in a cottage on Peckham Rye Common before Hone's appointment as a sub-editor of <span class="italic">The Patriot</span> required a removal to the paper's office at Bolt Court in 1836. The newspaper was an organ of evangelical nonconformism under the editorship of Josiah Condor, and Hone was well regarded there, although he found the work onerous, not least because of his declining health. In 1832 Hone became a Christian, and soon afterwards, a regular member of the congregation of the Weigh House Chapel, where he became a friend and admirer of the preacher the Revd Thomas Binney. The ecclesiastical historian John Fuller Russell met Hone in 1833, and described him as &#145;rather corpulent, dressed very plainly, and his lofty forehead, keen eye, grey and scanty locks, and very expressive countenance, commanded respect&#146;; by then he reportedly believed that the 1832 <span class="roman">Reform Act</span> had gone too far and that the political unions should have been forcibly put down. In June 1840, after a string of convalescent breaks, Hone retired and soon after moved to Tottenham, eventually settling there at 8 Grove Place. In 1841 he published a work of autobiography, <span class="italic">The Early Life and Conversion of William Hone</span>. He died at home in Tottenham on 6 November 1842, having been visited on his deathbed by Cruikshank (with whom he had quarrelled some fifteen years before) and Dickens, of whose novels he had grown particularly fond. He was buried in Abney Park cemetery, Stoke Newington. A collected edition of his output entitled <span class="italic">Hone's Works</span> (4 vols., 1882) is not comprehensive: a full bibliography is included in F. W. Hackwood, <span class="italic">William Hone: his Life and Times</span> (1912). <br>
<br>Until recently, Hone's fame rested largely on the achievements of the <span class="italic">Everyday Book</span>, <span class="italic">Table Book</span>, and <span class="italic">Year Book</span>, the antiquarian charm of which appealed to his Victorian readers. Undoubtedly these works were important, and they retain their value as forms of social commentary and records of popular life. In addition, their serialized production and their form&#151;that of the essay-sketch&#151;influenced the genres and styles of later writers. Latterly, Hone has been increasingly recognized as a key figure for those historians recovering the radical milieux of early nineteenth-century Britain on account of his strong advocacy of the liberty of the press and the rights of individuals and the persecuted. He dedicated himself to these causes to the detriment of his own self-interest and financial security, and his literary and political influence is still underestimated.<br>
