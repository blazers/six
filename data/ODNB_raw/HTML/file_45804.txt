<span class="headword">Glasgow Girls</span>  (<em>act. </em>1880&#150;1920), <span class="occ">were a group of women artists in Glasgow</span>. The name, conferred on the group by twentieth-century scholars, deliberately alludes to the contemporary group of Scottish male artists known as the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/64500/', "Glasgow Boys")</script>. The impetus to identify, record, and exhibit the work of women artists in Glasgow at the end of the nineteenth century came from the exhibition &#145;Scottish Painting&#146; held at the Glasgow Art Gallery in 1961: this featured the work of &#145;the Boys&#146; in abundance but did not include a single work by a woman. The earliest recorded reference to the Glasgow Girls appears to be that in William Buchanan's essay in the catalogue to the Scottish Arts Council exhibition &#145;The Glasgow Boys&#146; in 1968, the year in which the exhibition &#145;Founder Members and Exhibitors&#146; was held at the Lady Artists' Club. The founding of the Glasgow Society of Lady Artists in 1882, the first residential club of its kind in Scotland, provided a meeting place for women artists and opportunities and a space to exhibit their work. It was, however, the encouragement and enlightened approach to teaching that <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/49479/', "Francis (Fra) Newbery")</script>, the exceptional headmaster of the Glasgow School of Art from 1885 to 1917, showed to his women students during that period that provided the foundation of their success. All of the Glasgow Girls studied at the school and several went on to become members of staff.<br>
<br>At the school students came into contact with, and became practitioners within, the contemporary art movement known as the Glasgow style, an avant-garde design development that was influenced by the arts and crafts movement and an understanding of art nouveau. The revival of Celtic designs also contributed to this innovative style. Alongside these developments in design the Glasgow Girls worked within the context of the movement in painting known initially as the Glasgow school and later by the name given to the group of painters involved, the Glasgow Boys. The burgeoning prosperity of Glasgow ensured not only that there were local patrons willing to buy art, but that funding was available to support the education of women as well as men at the Glasgow School of Art. In 1897 the school moved from the top floor of the Corporation Buildings to a new building designed by the architect and designer <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/34764/', "Charles Rennie Mackintosh")</script>, whose work was in that year the subject of an important article in <span class="italic">The Studio</span>. The enlarged school provided better facilities for artisans attending early morning and evening classes in manufacturing design. Day classes were also held for middle-class women and paid for initially by their families.<br>
<br>Four years after his appointment as headmaster, on 28 September 1889 Fra Newbery married Jessie Wylie Rowat, an <span class="occ">embroiderer</span>. <a name="cosubject_45805"></a><span class="headword">Jessie Wylie Newbery</span>  (1864&#150;1948)<span class="occ"></span> was born in Paisley, near Glasgow, on 28 May 1864, one of the four children of William Rowat and his wife, Margaret Downie Hill. William Rowat was a shawl manufacturer and later tea importer who had strong views on the education of women. Like her father, Jessie had an independent nature. At the age of eighteen she visited Italy, where she became interested in mosaics, textiles, pottery, and &#145;peasant crafts&#146;. Throughout her life she collected textiles from Italy, Russia, and the Balkans. In 1884 she enrolled as a student at the Glasgow School of Art, and ten years later she became head of the school's department of embroidery, which she had established earlier. Her work raised the status of embroidery to that of a creative art form. She evolved<blockquote>a characteristic linen appliqu&eacute; &hellip; worked on linen ground, with applied simple stylized flowers and leaves, cut out of coloured linens and held down by satin stitch in silk &hellip; the stems coiled into strong lines, outlining the shape of the article. (Swain, &#145;Mrs J. R. Newbery&#146;, 105)</blockquote>She &#145;liked the opposition of straight lines to curved; of horizontal to vertical &hellip; I specially aim at beautifully shaped spaces and try to make them as important as the patterns&#146;  (ibid.). The Glasgow rose, emblem of the Glasgow style, &#145;is believed to have evolved from her circles of pink linen, cut out freehand and applied with lines of satin stitch to indicate folded petals&#146;  (ibid.). She introduced lettering, mottoes, and verses as part of her designs, and also taught needleweaving and dress design. In an interview with Gleeson White she commented, &#145;I believe in education consisting of seeing the best that has been done. Then, having this high standard thus set before us, in doing what we like to do: that for our fathers, this for us&#146;  (G. White, 48). She was a fine teacher and inspired many of her students.<br>
<br>At the same time Mrs Newbery managed her mercurial husband and brought up two daughters, Elsie and Mary, for whom she designed artistic yet practical dresses, as she designed and made her own attractive clothes. Her original and individual designs for dresses incorporating embroidery set a style for her students which was emulated by many of the Glasgow Girls, including the Macdonald sisters, Margaret and Frances. Like women in other artistic circles, for example, Jane and May Morris, Jessie Newbery wore dresses of an Italian Renaissance appearance, though she also believed that dress should be practical as well as beautiful. At a school at-home in November 1900<blockquote>her black merve [<i>sic</i>] gown was slightly trained and had the long sleeves puffed at intervals to correspond with the simply fashioned bodice which was finished with a narrow collar of old lace, and on the shoulders bows of reddish gold velvet. (Burkhauser, 148)</blockquote>It was later noted that &#145;she never wore a corset in her life &hellip; she deplored the tight lacing imposed by the current fashion&#146;  (ibid., 50), a comment that reveals her interest in rational dress (she possessed a &#145;rational&#146; skating costume with red flannel bloomers). In 1918 she retired with her husband to Eastgate, Corfe Castle, Dorset, where she died on 27 April 1948.<br>
<br>Jessie Newbery's most talented student, <a name="cosubject_45804"></a><span class="headword">Ann Macbeth</span>  (1875&#150;1948)<span class="occ"></span>, was born at 41 Chorley Old Road, Little Bolton, Lancashire, on 25 September 1875, the eldest of the nine children of Norman Macbeth, a mechanical engineer, and his wife, Annie MacNicol. Her grandfather was the portrait painter <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17357/', "Norman Macbeth RA")</script>. She attended a dame-school in St Anne's, whither her family had moved, and was influenced by her parents' active support of the local church. (Though Scottish Presbyterians, they attended a Congregational church, there being no Presbyterian church nearby.) Owing to a childhood attack of scarlet fever, Ann had the use of only one eye. In 1902, while still a student, Ann Macbeth joined Jessie Newbery as a teacher in the embroidery department of Glasgow School of Art. That year she won a silver medal at the Turin Esposizione Internazionale d'Arte Decorativa, and a silk cushion she had worked with the floral attributes of the four countries of Britain was presented to Queen Alexandra in commemoration of the coronation. She taught needlework, embroidery, and appliqu&eacute;, and from 1909 to 1912 also taught metalwork and bookbinding. About 1911 she succeeded Jessie Newbery as head of the embroidery department at Glasgow School of Art, where she had become a member of the school council in 1908. Like her teacher, she made and embroidered her own dresses and also executed fine works of embroidery such as <span class="italic">The Sleeping Beauty</span> (1902; Glasgow Museums and Art Galleries) and a pictorial work, <span class="italic">Elspeth</span> (1904; priv. coll.). Her works often incorporate panels of figures worked on satin. Their &#145;billowing elongated skirts with &hellip; decorated borders are romantic but still functional&#146;  (Swain, &#145;Ann Macbeth&#146;, 8). She was a fine draughtswoman and an influential teacher at her Saturday classes for teachers run by the school. Macbeth reached a wider public with a series of lectures across Scotland, England, and Wales. Her books included <span class="italic">Educational Needlework</span> (1911, with Margaret Swanson), <span class="italic">Embroidered Lace and Leatherwork</span> (1924), and <span class="italic">Countrywoman's Rug Book</span> (1926; repr. California, <i>c</i>.1990). Over a long period examples of her work were on exhibition at Miss Cranston's tea-rooms in Glasgow. She designed for Liberty's and Knox's Linen Thread Company, and embroidered a frontal for the communion table of Glasgow Cathedral. Fra Newbery praised &#145;her very practical outlook&#146; and noted of her work &#145;how stuffs, plain, yet of sound quality and good colour could be beautified by the addition of embroidery and other decoration&#146;  (ibid.). She was awarded diplomas in art from institutions in Paris, Tunis, Ghent, Budapest, and Chicago. In 1928 she retired to Patterdale, Westmorland, where she &#145;was quickly recognized by her long flowing cape, her skirt possibly vivid scarlet and emerald green, wearing long necklaces&#146;  (Ives, 6). Ann Macbeth died, unmarried, at 8 Eden Mount, Carlisle, on 23 March 1948. As a foreword to Anne Knox Arthur's <span class="italic">Embroidery Book</span> (1920) she wrote: &#145;One may embroider poems, another may embroider prayer and praises for her church, another may beautify a woman's garments or sing a little song in stitches for a baby's robe&#146;  (ibid.). Her embroidery of <span class="italic">The Nativity</span> is in Glasgow Museum and Art Gallery; that of <span class="italic">The Good Shepherd</span> remains in Patterdale church.<br>
<br>Following their move to Glasgow in 1890, Margaret Macdonald [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/38964/', "Mackintosh, Margaret Macdonald")</script>] and her sister <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/39323/', "Frances Eliza Macdonald")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/38964/', "Mackintosh, Margaret Macdonald")</script>] attended Glasgow School of Art. Noticing a similarity in style between their work and that of two evening students, Charles Rennie Mackintosh and Herbert McNair, Fra Newbery introduced them, a meeting that led to the development of the Glasgow style and then to the marriages of Frances to McNair and Margaret to Mackintosh in 1899 and 1900 respectively. While they were still students, some of their work appeared in &#145;The Magazine&#146;, a manuscript periodical edited by a fellow student, Lucy Raeburn (1869&#150;1952), which appeared from 1893 to 1894. The work of the Glasgow Four as they came to be known is seen to represent the core of the Glasgow style. Both sisters were members of a group at the school known as the Immortals.<br>
<br>The bookbinder and illustrator <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/38944/', "Jessie Marion King")</script> also studied at the Glasgow School of Art, where her vivid imagination and fine linear style were encouraged by Fra Newbery. From 1900 to 1908 she taught in the school's department of book decoration, which became the department of bookbinding and design. In 1902 she was awarded a gold medal at the Scottish section of the international decorative arts exhibition at Turin for her binding of <span class="italic">L'enfance de l'&eacute;vangile</span>. She illustrated many books, including <span class="italic">The High History of the Holy Grail</span> and <span class="italic">The Defence of Guinevere</span>, two of her finest works.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_77073"></a><span class="headword">Annie <span class="st"> [Anne]</span> French</span>  (1872&#150;1965)<span class="occ"></span> was another illustrator who used a fine linear technique. Born at 5 Calder Street, Govan, Glasgow, on 6 February 1872, she was the daughter of Andrew French, a colliery clerk and later metallurgist, and his wife, Margaret Weir. Unlike Jessie King, her interest in art was encouraged by her family, and she was a student at the Glasgow School of Art from 1886 to 1889. She taught at the school's department of ceramic decoration from 1908 to 1912. Her black and white illustrative work, for example <span class="italic">The Picture Book</span> (reproduced in <span class="italic">The Studio</span>, 14 July 1906) and <span class="italic">The Plumed Hat</span> (<i>c</i>.1900; reproduced in Burkhauser, 142), shows some similarity in style to that of Aubrey Beardsley: it was imaginative and full of fantasy, but was little published although well reviewed in the prestigious art journal <span class="italic">The Studio</span>. In 1914 she married the ceramic artist George Wooliscroft Rhead (1867&#150;1920) and settled in London. She died at The Limes, a nursing home in St Helier, Jersey, on 27 January 1965. Examples of her work are held in private collections and a few are in the collection of Glasgow Museums and Art Galleries.<br>
<br>Though <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/56491/', "Katharine Cameron")</script> illustrated many books, she was better known as a watercolour painter of flowers (especially roses) and landscapes. As a student at the Glasgow School of Art from 1888 to 1895 she was friendly with C. R. Mackintosh and the Macdonald sisters, and a member of the Immortals group. She contributed to &#145;The Magazine&#146; and in 1949 presented its four issues to the Glasgow School of Art.<br>
<br>Among Fra Newbery's many innovative ideas was the establishment of craft studios and the appointment of many women teachers of design on his staff. <a name="cosubject_77074"></a><span class="headword">De Courcy Lewthwaite Dewar</span>  (1878&#150;1959), <span class="occ">metalwork designer</span>, was born on 12 February 1878 in Kandy, Ceylon, the daughter of a tea planter, John Lewthwaite Dewar, and his wife, Amelia Cochran. Her unusual first name had been passed down through several generations in her family, by whom she was known as Kooroovi, the Tamil word for a small bird. She was one of three surviving daughters of the family. From 1891 until 1908 or 1909 she studied part-time at the Glasgow School of Art. Her enamel and metalwork, which included jewellery, clock surrounds, mirror surrounds, plaques, caskets, buttons, and sconces, was frequently illustrated in <span class="italic">The Studio</span>. She also painted, engraved, and produced designs for bookplates, calendars, tea-room menus, and cards, as well as costumes for masques. For thirty-eight years Dewar taught design in the metalwork department of the school, during some of that period with Peter Wylie Davidson, in whose <span class="italic">Applied Design in the Precious Metals</span> (1929) her <span class="italic">Presentation Casket</span> (<i>c</i>.1910; Glasgow Society of Women Artists, on loan to Glasgow Museums and Art Galleries) is illustrated. &#145;Dewar's enamel and graphic work is characterized by strong colour and vigorous outline and the Glasgow Style designs from her student and tutorial phase gradually evolved to a more geometric and boldly coloured Czechoslovakian folk-art influenced style&#146;  (Burkhauser, 163). She was president of the Society of Lady Artists' Club, whose history she wrote (privately printed, 1950). Her sketchbooks of <i>c</i>.1895&#150;1910 (priv. coll.), letters, and journals provide &#145;a rare account of a woman designer of the Glasgow Style era&#146;  (ibid.). Dewar was involved with the women's suffrage movement, for whom she designed bookplates, programmes, and calendars. She compiled files on women artists for the National Council of Women in London providing biographical information and reproductions of works. She did not marry and lived with her sister, Katharine, at 15 Woodside Terrace, Glasgow, until her death there on 24 November 1959.<br>
<br>Of a talented family, Helen Walton (1850&#150;1921) joined the staff of the Glasgow School of Art in 1894 to teach ceramic design and decoration. The designer and architect <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/38968/', "George Henry Walton")</script> was her brother. Helen's sister Hannah (1863&#150;1940) decorated china and glass, and another sister, Constance, like their brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/38954/', "Edward Arthur Walton")</script>, was a painter. Later, in 1902, Dorothy Carleton Smyth (1880&#150;1933) and her sister Olive (1882&#150;1949) were both on the school's staff and taught in a variety of applied art media and techniques such as sgraffito, gesso panels, illumination on vellum, and woodblock printing on textiles. Dorothy is now chiefly remembered for her costume illustrations and Olive for her stylized scenes in watercolour on vellum of subjects from legends.<br>
<br>Four of the Glasgow Girls were painters in oils and worked more independently than the designers and decorative artists. <a name="cosubject_59394"></a><span class="headword">(Richmond Leslie) Stansmore Dean</span>  (1866&#150;1944), <span class="occ">painter</span>, was born at 105 Breadalbane Terrace, Hill Street, Glasgow, on 3 June 1866, the youngest of the six children of Alexander Davidson Dean, an engraver and a co-founder of the printing firm of Gilmour and Dean, and his wife, Jean Leslie. From 1883 Stansmore Dean studied at the Glasgow School of Art, where she became friends with Margaret Rowat, the sister of Jessie Newbery, and was a fellow student of C. R. Mackintosh and Bessie MacNicol. She was the first woman student to win the school's Haldane travelling bursary in 1890, and went to the Acad&eacute;mie Colarossi in Paris to study under August Courtois. At the beginning of the twentieth century she established her own studio in Glasgow and exhibited at the Glasgow Institute, in Paisley, and in Liverpool. She showed twice with the International Society in London; her work, for example <span class="italic">Meditation</span> (<i>c</i>.1899; Glasgow Museums and Art Galleries) and <span class="italic">Girl in a Straw Hat</span> (<i>c</i>.1910; priv. coll.), shows the influence of J. A. M. Whistler, president of that society. When exhibiting work her masculine-sounding name, which was a family one, may have been an advantage. An active member of the Lady Artists' Club and a forceful personality, she put forward Mackintosh as the man to carry out alterations and redecoration of the club's premises in Blythswood Square. His distinctive black entrance porch was erected before the club's council overrode her recommendations as convenor of the decorating committee. On 30 April 1902 she married the artist Robert Macaulay Stevenson (1854&#150;1952). He was a widower, and she helped to bring up his young daughter, Jean. This left her with fewer opportunities to develop her own career, and financial worries obliged them to let Robinsfield, their large house by Bardowie Loch to the north of Glasgow, where each had their own studio. They went to live at Montreuil-sur-Mer in northern France, where they both worked throughout the First World War with the Church of Scotland huts helping the soldiers. They returned to Robinsfield in 1926 but left again in 1932 to live in Kirkcudbright, then home to several Scottish painters, and Borgue. Stansmore Dean died at Castle Douglas, Kirkcudbrightshire, on 15 December 1944. Her portrait of the writer Neil Munro (<i>c</i>.1905) is in the Scottish National Portrait Gallery, Edinburgh.<br>
<br>Bessie MacNicol [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/70511/', "MacNicol, Elizabeth")</script>] studied at the Glasgow School of Art from 1887 to 1892. In 1896 she painted a portrait of Edward Atkinson Hornel, one of the Glasgow Boys, in his studio in Kirkcudbright and was subsequently much influenced by his use of colour and interest in paint textures. So much did she share stylistically with &#145;the Boys&#146; that many members of the Glasgow Art Club (which did not then admit women painters) attended her funeral and left a wreath mourning &#145;the loss of a true artist&#146;  (Burkhauser, 197).<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_59396"></a><span class="headword">Eleanor Allen Moore</span>  (1885&#150;1955), <span class="occ">painter</span>, was born on 26 July 1885 at Glenfield, Glenwherry, co. Antrim, Northern Ireland, the daughter of Hamilton Moore (1856&#150;1927), an Irish Presbyterian minister, and his wife, Annie Kinnear Stephen (1860&#150;1940) of St Cyrus, Kincardineshire. Her childhood was spent at Newmilns in Ayrshire, where her father was minister of Loudoun parish. She studied at the Glasgow School of Art from 1902 to 1907. As a daughter of the manse she was dependent on bursary assistance, and was encouraged by Fra Newbery, who was still teaching painting classes himself until 1906, when Maurice Grieffenhagen joined the staff. Since she was unable to afford models, her earlier work consisted of large richly painted self-portraits in various guises, for example, <span class="italic">Marmalade</span> (<i>c</i>.1913; priv. coll.) and <span class="italic">The Silk Dress</span> (<i>c</i>.1919; priv. coll.). On 29 June 1922 she married Robert Cecil Robertson (1889&#150;1942), a doctor of medicine, and their daughter was born in 1923. In 1925 the family sailed for Shanghai, where her husband took up an appointment in public health. Eleanor Moore continued to paint portraits of British army and naval officers, but with the help of the Shanghai Art Club was also able to paint Chinese men, women, and children of all ages. As anti-foreigner riots began to die down she was able to explore the Yangztze (Yangzi) delta by houseboat and visited the walled cities of Soochow and Wusih. She painted landscapes and townscapes, but her preference was to paint portraits of Chinese people. A good example is <span class="italic">The Letter Writer</span> (<i>c</i>.1936; priv. coll.). Though she loved Chinese art, her own remained uninfluenced by it. With other British women and children she was evacuated from Shanghai in 1937 and went to live in Hong Kong. Following her husband's death there on 4 August 1942 she returned to Scotland and died at the Western General Hospital, Edinburgh, on 17 September 1955. Her ashes were interred in Loudoun cemetery, Ayrshire.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_59395"></a><span class="headword">Norah Neilson Gray</span>  (1882&#150;1931), <span class="occ">painter</span>, was born on 16 June 1882 at Carisbrooke, 108 West King Street, Helensburgh, Dunbartonshire, the second youngest daughter among the seven children of George William Gray, a Glasgow shipowner, and his wife, Norah Neilson. She first studied locally at The Studio with Miss Park and Miss Ross, but the family moved to Glasgow, where she was a student at the Glasgow School of Art from 1901 to 1906. She taught fashion-plate design at the school and also taught art to the girls of St Columba's School, Kilmalcolm, before establishing her position as a portrait painter with her first solo exhibition in 1910 at Warneuke's Gallery, Glasgow. During the First World War she painted several important pictures, including <span class="italic">The Belgian Refugee</span> (1916; Glasgow Museums and Art Galleries) and <span class="italic">The Country's Charge</span>, bought by the manufacturer Joseph Bibby and presented to the Royal Free Hospital, London. In 1918 she went as a Voluntary Aid Detachment nurse to the Abbaye de Royaumont, near Paris, which was staffed by women of the Scottish Women's Hospitals, and in her free time painted the arrival of the wounded in the old vaulted hall of the abbey. She was later commissioned to paint the surgeon Frances Ivens, with hospital staff and patients in the abbey cloisters. <span class="italic">The Scottish Women's Hospital</span> (1920) is now in the Imperial War Museum, London. After the war Gray resumed portrait painting and excelled particularly with young children. <span class="italic">Little Brother</span> (1920&#150;22, exh. RA, 1922; Glasgow Museums and Art Galleries) was bought by Glasgow corporation at the memorial exhibition of her work in Glasgow in 1932. Gray exhibited annually at the Paris Salon des Artistes Fran&ccedil;ais and was awarded their silver medal in 1923; she was better known abroad than in her own country. Her watercolours, for example, <span class="italic">July Night, Loch Lomond</span> (<i>c</i>.1922; priv. coll.), were notable for their modernist approach and pointilliste technique. Gray died of cancer at the height of her career at 1 St James Terrace, Glasgow, on 27 May 1931.<br>
<br>In 1988 the Glasgow School of Art mounted the exhibition &#145;&#147;Glasgow Girls&#148;: Women in the Art School, 1880&#150;1920&#146;. This was well received, and the work of this talented group of designers and painters was recognized, in some cases for the first time. The exhibition led to the publication of <span class="italic">&#145;Glasgow Girls&#146;: Women in art and design, 1880&#150;1920</span> (1990; rev. edn, 1993), edited by Jude Burkhauser.<br>
