<span class="headword">Berlepsch,  Emilie  von</span> <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Dorothea Friderika Aemilia  von Oppel; <em>other married name </em>Emilie Harmes]</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1755, <em>d.</em> 1830), <span class="occ">author and traveller</span>, was baptized on 26 November 1755 as Dorothea Friderika Aemilia von Oppel, at Gotha, Thuringia, daughter of Carl Georg von Oppel (<i>d</i>. 1760), lord of the manor of Wellerswalde, near Oschatz, Saxony, and vice-chancellor of the duchy of Saxe-Gotha, and Amalie, countess of D&ouml;nhoff (<i>d</i>. 1768), lady in waiting to the duchess of Saxe-Gotha. After her father died, her mother married <i>Legationsrat</i> (&#145;Counsellor&#146;) Friedrich Ulrich von Stirn, and, possibly because of the marriage, Emilie was placed under the guardianship of her uncle, Johann Siegmund von Oppel, at Weimar where she received a good private education. On 2 March 1772 she married at Weimar Friedrich Ludwig von Berlepsch (1749&#150;1818), subsequently <i>Hofrichter</i> (&#145;judge&#146;) at the court of the elector in Hanover. She lived there and in Schloss Berlepsch, near G&ouml;ttingen, and at Weimar, where she became a devoted disciple of J. G. Herder, leader of the pre-Romantic movement in Germany. She moved in literary circles, publishing two slim volumes of poetry.<br>
<br>Wavering between elation and depression, Emilie von Berlepsch took refuge in Switzerland in 1793&#150;5. The sublime landscape peopled by innocent shepherds, which she knew from literature, seemed to exist in reality, and she came to love the country as a peaceful idyll. Its invasion by France in 1798 roused her to violent protest. In <span class="italic">Einige Bermerkungen zur richtigern Beurtheilung der erzwungnen Schweitzer-Revolution</span> (1799) she gave &#145;a fairer assessment of the revolution imposed on Switzerland by force&#146;, and she vowed she would not visit the country as long as it remained occupied by French troops. Instead she decided to visit Scotland where she hoped to regain the paradise lost in the Alps. Again literature&#151;this time Ossian and Burns, both admired by Herder&#151;was her guide, and she also saw Britain as a bulwark against French imperialism. Her host was the Revd James Macdonald, a Hebridean and promoter of cultural exchange between Scotland and Germany, whom she had met at Weimar soon after her first marriage ended in divorce in 1795. She spent the winter of 1799&#150;1800 in Edinburgh and toured the highlands the following summer with Macdonald. <span class="italic">Caledonia</span> (4 vols., 1802&#150;4), dedicated to Herder, is her account of the country and her emotional response to it. She recalls passages from Ossian in Glencoe and is distressed to be unable to reach Staffa. In the first long notice in German given to Robert Burns, she praises him as a true poet according to Herder's criteria, a creative genius drawn from peasant stock. By her prose paraphrase in German of &#145;The Cotter's Saturday Night&#146; she tries to win to the ranks of his admirers those put off by his dialect. She saw the highlanders as noble savages, and, although aware of their lack of development and poverty, was full of praise for their frugal life, discipline at work, thrift, and pride in their history&#151;all reminiscent of the Swiss. Her observations on Edinburgh upper-class society centre on the role of women. Her long excursus on British women writers singles out Mary Wollstonecraft as a kindred spirit. She evidently knew Wollstonecraft's work thoroughly and draws to her the attention of a German public which had largely forgotten her. She claims the right of women to write books on any subject, hitherto a male preserve, and indeed her own work, she proudly remarks, was the first of its kind by a German woman.<br>
<br>Emilie von Berlepsch returned home disillusioned after Macdonald had refused to marry her. On 5 June 1801 she married the commoner August Heinrich Harmes (1762&#150;1839) from Mecklenburg with whom she lived by Lake Z&uuml;rich from 1804 to 1817. Bad fortune and ill health drove the couple back to Mecklenburg-Schwerin where they lived precariously on the benefaction of the grand duke. She died at Lauenburg on the Elbe on 27 July 1830. <span class="italic">Caledonia</span> received some critical notice at the time, but later descriptions of Scotland, inspired by Scott's fiction, eclipsed her work, rather than claiming it as a forerunner. Interest in her was revived in the later twentieth century.<br>
