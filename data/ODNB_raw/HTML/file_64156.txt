<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Reece, Sir  Gerald</span>  (1897&#150;1985), <span class="occ">colonial administrator</span>, was born on 10 January 1897 in Christchurch, New Zealand, the only son and second child of Edward Mackintosh Reece and his wife, Rose Emily Shaw, of Birmingham. His grandfather had an ironmongery business and cattle farm in New Zealand, as well as a plantation in Fiji. Educated at Rugby School, he was commissioned into the Sherwood Foresters in 1915, and saw active service in France and Belgium. After the war he qualified as a solicitor, and practised in London from 1921 to 1925, also serving as a territorial in the London Scottish regiment.<br>
<br>Reece joined the Kenya administration in 1925, and was posted as a district officer to West Suk, in the Turkana district. In 1928 he was appointed district commissioner in Mandera, in the northern frontier district, an area of 100,000 square miles of semi-desert covered with thorny scrub between the frontiers of Ethiopia and Italian Somaliland. There were no European settlers and it was sparsely populated by pastoral nomadic peoples, the camel-owning Somali and the cattle-herding Boran. It was a closed district and special permits were required to enter the area: this was an attempt to check the south-westerly drive of the Somali, which threatened the European-settled highlands to the south. The district commissioners spent much of their time travelling on foot among the scattered tribesmen, settling disputes, collecting taxes, and improving grazing and water supplies, but the key issue was the control of grazing. In Mandera, Reece trained a tribal police force known as Dubas after their red turbans, recruited from the leading families, and responsible only to the district commissioner. An &eacute;lite force, the Dubas were independent of the Kenya police, whom Reece regarded as unreliable. The Dubas were later introduced into the other frontier districts. As district commissioner in Moyale from 1932, Reece was seconded to the Foreign Office in 1934 as British consul for southern Ethiopia, at Mega, where he had to cope with the refugees who poured over the mountains after the Italian invasion of Ethiopia in 1935. He was appointed district commissioner in Marsabit in 1936.<br>
<br>Since 1934 the officer in charge of the northern frontier district had been Vincent Glenday, who was district commissioner in Turkana when Reece first arrived in Kenya. Glenday expected his junior officers to remain unmarried until they had done at least two tours of duty, and it was not until 20 March 1936 that Reece married Alys Isabel Wingfield (<i>b</i>. 1912/13), daughter of Horace Ernest Humphrey Tracy of Bury St Edmunds, a retired RAF squadron leader, and sister of the writer Honor Tracy; they had two sons and two daughters. Alys Reece later wrote an account of their life in Kenya, <span class="italic">To my Wife: Fifty Camels</span> (1963).<br>
<br>While Glenday was on leave in 1938, Reece acted as officer in charge at Isiolo, headquarters of the northern frontier district; and when Glenday left Kenya to become governor of the Somaliland protectorate in 1939, Reece was appointed in his place. Very similar in outlook to Glenday, Reece loved the tough frontier life, and wrote that the northern frontier district was where &#145;real life&#146; was to be found: &#145;there was something genuine and real about it all &hellip; those of us who'd had hard lives in the war found a certain peace in the solitude of the desert&#146;  (Allen, 96). He was very demanding, expecting his officers to work long hours, and to spend at least half of each month on foot safari. He was a stickler for detail, and bombarded his young officers with detailed orders and circulars. Reece was admired and respected by all, and inspired great affection in many, even among the Goan clerks serving in remote districts, to whose welfare he paid great attention. He came to be universally known as Uncle. A man of many interests, he was especially fond of the poetry of R. L. Stevenson. Reece was made an OBE in 1937 and a CBE in 1943.<br>
<br>When Italian forces invaded Kenya in June 1940, the British abandoned the frontier area, including Mandera and Moyale, but when the Italians were pushed out of Italian east Africa and Haile Selassie was restored to the throne of Ethiopia in 1941, Reece argued the case for establishing a British military administration in Borana, in southern Ethiopia. When the occupied enemy territory administration took over in 1941, he was appointed senior political officer for the Borana province, in addition to his position in the northern frontier district. He faced the task of trying to keep the peace among warring tribesmen armed with rifles, and he managed to extract compensation from them for years of raids south of the border with Kenya. He moved his wife and family from Isiolo to Marsabit, and often did not see them for months on end. In 1942 the Ethiopians took over from the occupied enemy territory administration, but the raids from Borana into the northern frontier district continued until the end of 1943. After the war Reece was appointed the first provincial commissioner of the new Northern Province, which was expanded in 1947 to include Turkana. He faced the problem of the increasing political activity of the Somali Youth League. Formed in 1943 in the former Italian Somaliland as the Somali Youth Club, it aimed to unite all Somali in an independent Somalia. Reece banned the movement in Garissa as subversive, and later extended the ban to the whole province in 1948.<br>
<br>Reece left Kenya in 1948 to become the first post-war governor of the Somaliland protectorate and military administrator of the Haud and reserved areas along the Ethiopian border. Since 1941, a British military administration had controlled British Somaliland, the former Italian Somaliland, and the Ogaden area of Ethiopia. However, the Bevin Plan of 1946, proposing the formation of a united Somali state under the trusteeship of the United Nations, was rejected, and Somalia was divided again, with Ogaden handed back to Ethiopia in 1948, Italian Somaliland placed under United Nations trusteeship administered by Italy, while British Somaliland reverted to protectorate status. Under Reece's governorship, the civil administration was restored, the Somalization of the civil service and the police began, in preparation for independence, although no date had been set, and he devoted himself to educational and economic development. A trade school opened in Hargeisa in 1952, and the first government school for girls and the first secondary school for boys in 1953, while water storage basins were excavated along the southern boundary of the protectorate. He also managed to get funds from the Colonial Office to build a road over the Daloh Pass, from Erigavo in the mountains down a 7000 ft escarpment to Mait on the coast of the Gulf of Aden, which he opened himself in 1953. Despite the bias of the British government towards the Ethiopians, Reece had grown to respect the Somali, and he was remembered long after his retirement. He was bitterly disappointed when the Foreign Office decided to return the Somali grazing areas of the Haud and reserved areas to Ethiopian control according to the treaty of 1897, and he decided to retire in 1953, rather than have to implement this decision. He was made a KCMG in 1950.<br>
<br>Reece settled in East Lothian, Scotland, and in his retirement he worked for prison reform as Scottish chairman of the Howard League for Penal Reform from 1961 to 1973, and chairman of the managers of Loaningdale Approved School from 1968 to 1976. He continued to take an interest in Somali affairs, and in the 1960s argued the case for the secession of the Somali part of the Northern Province of Kenya to Somalia. He was patron of the Anglo-Somali Society from 1978. He also took part in local affairs, serving as honorary sheriff of East Lothian from 1962 to 1973, and as deputy lieutenant in 1971. Reece died on 14 October 1985 in Roodlands Hospital, Haddington, East Lothian.<br>
