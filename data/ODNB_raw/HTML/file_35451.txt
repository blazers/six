<span class="headword">Peel, Sir  Frederick</span>  (1823&#150;1906), <span class="occ">politician and railway commissioner</span>, born in Stanhope Street, London, on 26 October 1823, was the second son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21764/', "Sir Robert Peel, second baronet (1788&#150;1850)")</script>, prime minister, and his wife, Julia (1795&#150;1859), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9773/', "General Sir John Floyd, first baronet")</script>. His elder brother was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21765/', "Sir Robert Peel, third baronet")</script>; his younger brothers were <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21766/', "Sir William Peel")</script>, naval captain, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35450/', "Arthur Wellesley (afterwards first Viscount) Peel")</script>, speaker of the House of Commons.<br>
<br>Frederick Peel was educated at Harrow School (1836&#150;41), and then at Trinity College, Cambridge (his father disapproving of the decline of discipline at Christ Church, Oxford, his own college). He graduated BA in 1845 as a junior optime and with a first class in the classical tripos, and proceeded MA in 1849. He was the ablest intellectually of the Peel children, and, from his father's viewpoint, the most dependable. On leaving Cambridge he became a student at the Inner Temple on 5 May 1845, and was called to the bar on 2 February 1849. In the same month he entered the House of Commons, being returned unopposed as Liberal member for Leominster; his choice of party was seen by many as confirmation of his father's inclinations. His maiden speech (11 May 1849) supported the removal of Jewish disabilities, and seemed to suggest a promising political career. Peel was a staunch supporter of free trade and of the extension of the franchise, but being distrustful of secret voting he was not in favour of the ballot. Despite his outspoken criticism of the Liberal government's <span class="roman">Ecclesiastical Titles Bill</span> (14 February 1851), Lord John Russell recognized his ability by appointing him under-secretary for the colonies. After the general election of 1852, when Peel successfully contested Bury, he resumed the post of under-secretary for the colonies in Lord Aberdeen's coalition ministry. On 15 February 1853 he introduced the <span class="roman">Clergy Reserves Bill</span>, designed to give the government of Canada effective control over the churches there and to end the use of Canadian land to subsidize the protestant clergy. Under Peel's auspices the bill passed the House of Commons, despite violent opposition from the Conservatives, and received the royal assent on 9 May 1853.<br>
<br>On the fall of the Aberdeen ministry in January 1855 Peel became Palmerston's under-secretary for war. In view of the popular outcry against the mismanagement of the Crimean War the post involved heavy responsibilities. Peel's chief, Lord Panmure, sat in the House of Lords, but Peel was responsible minister in the House of Commons. It was he who consequently bore the brunt of the criticism of the war and its inept handling. In 1857 he lost his seat at Bury and resigned office. In recognition of his services he was made a privy councillor. He was once more returned for Bury in 1859 and was appointed by Palmerston to the financial secretaryship of the Treasury, a post which he held until 1865, working with W. E. Gladstone, who was chancellor of the exchequer. In 1865 he was again defeated at Bury at the general election and lost his office. Peel then tired somewhat of the rough-and-tumble of political life. He unsuccessfully contested South-East Lancashire in 1868, and never re-entered the House of Commons. He was created KCMG in 1869, and turned to law and administration.<br>
<br>In 1873, on the passing of the <span class="roman">Regulation of Railways Act</span>, Peel was appointed a member of the railway and canal commission, on which he served until his death. The tribunal was constituted as a court of arbitration to settle disagreements between railways and their customers which lay beyond the scope of ordinary litigation. The commission rapidly developed in importance, and was reorganized by the <span class="roman">Railway and Canal Act</span> of 1888, a judge of the High Court being added to its members. Peel and his colleagues rendered useful service to the farming and commercial interests by reducing preferential rates on many railways. In <i>Ford &amp; Co. v. London and South Western Railway</i> they decided that the existence of a favoured list of passengers constituted an undue preference  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 3 Nov 1890). The decisions of the commissioners were seldom reversed on appeal. In the case of <i>Sowerby &amp; Co. v. Great Northern Railway</i>, Peel dissented from the judgment of his colleagues, Mr Justice Wills and Mr Price, to the effect that the railway company was entitled to make charges in addition to the maximum in respect of station accommodation and expenses, but the view of the majority was upheld by the Court of Appeal (21 March 1891). As senior commissioner, Peel became the most influential member of the tribunal. He had his father's judicial mind and cautious, equable temper, but his reticence, aloofness, and lack of ambition militated against his success in public life.<br>
<br>Peel married first, on 12 August 1857, Elizabeth Emily (<i>d</i>. 1865), daughter of John Shelley of Avington House, Hampshire, and niece of Percy Bysshe Shelley, the poet; and second, on 3 September 1879, Janet (<i>d</i>. 1925), daughter of Philip Pleydell Bouverie of Brymore, Somerset, who survived him. There were no children by either marriage. Peel lived at the manor house of Hampton in Arden, Warwickshire, which his father bought for him and bequeathed to him. He died at his London house, 32 Chesham Place, on 6 June 1906 and was buried at Hampton in Arden.<br>
