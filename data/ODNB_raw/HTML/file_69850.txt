<span class="headword">Milligan,  Francis Sydney</span>  (1894&#150;1965), <span class="occ">adult educationist</span>, was born on 18 September 1894 at 5 Grosvenor Square, Poulton-cum-Seacombe, Birkenhead, the son of Alexander M'Call Milligan, a commercial clerk, and his wife, Emily Cummine. Educated at Wallasey grammar school in Cheshire, he won a scholarship to Liverpool University in 1914 but his studies were interrupted by the outbreak of the First World War. As a pacifist Frank Milligan initially joined the ambulance corps as a stretcher-bearer but, after a few weeks in France, he enlisted in the 7th King's regiment (Liverpool). Awarded the Military Medal as an NCO he was subsequently commissioned, won the Military Cross, and finished the war with the rank of major.<br>
<br>In 1918 Milligan resumed his education at the University of Birmingham, where he was awarded an MA degree for a thesis entitled &#145;Politics and industry within the state: a plea for evolution in place of revolution&#146;. As president of the university's guild of students he was a member of the small group which established the National Union of Students in 1920. On graduation he spent four years teaching for the Workers' Educational Association, where he forged a lifelong commitment to adult education and local voluntary action. In 1924 he was headhunted to become warden of Beechcroft educational settlement in Birkenhead, where he relished the multifaceted role of warden which ranged from &#145;defining a common purpose&#146; for the settlement's disparate user groups to &#145;acting as an odd-job man&#146;  (Milligan, &#145;The years between&#146;, 87).<br>
<br>On 14 June 1922 he married Gwendoline Mary (<i>b</i>. 1899/1900), daughter of James Henry Spencer, a schoolmaster; they had two sons. Increasingly preoccupied by the needs of the unemployed, Milligan resigned as warden in 1933 to launch a bold and imaginative experiment in residential adult education. At Wincham Hall, a country house near Northwich in Cheshire, he ran six-week courses for groups of men from the unemployed clubs of south-west Lancashire and Cheshire. The programme combined practical instruction and technical education with discussion groups on social affairs and cultural activities. This successful experiment was based on Milligan's distinctive educational philosophy that &#145;individuals must be free to choose their own way of education&#146; and that &#145;no-one shall nourish his own interests in isolation but shall put them increasingly to the service of the community&#146;  (Milligan, &#145;Wire in the blood&#146;, 25).<br>
<br>The Wincham Hall experiment was brought to a premature end by the outbreak of war in 1939, when Milligan found himself unexpectedly running a hostel for evacuated women and children. The following year he rejoined the army as a welfare officer before becoming, in 1942, a full-time lecturer for Liverpool University's regional committee for forces education. In 1944 Milligan was appointed the first secretary of the National Council of Social Service's newly established community centres department which became the secretariat for the National Federation of Community Associations in 1945. The war had given a new impetus to the development of neighbourhood community associations and the educational value of community centres had been recognized by the Ministry of Education. But the high hopes of 1945 rapidly gave way to the harsh reality of post-war Britain; restrictions on the use of skilled labour for construction and constraints on educational expenditure meant slow progress in building new community centres and developing a professional cadre of centre wardens.<br>
<br>Despite these problems the community associations movement grew to maturity during the fifteen years of Milligan's leadership of the federation. In 1945 the federation had eighty-five members and was in contact with a total of 400 local groups. By 1958 the membership was nearing 400 and the total number of groups with which it worked exceeded 1650. These achievements owed much to Milligan's &#145;imaginative, patient efforts to translate ideals into practical achievement &hellip; his grasp of principle and his understanding of human diversity&#146;  (Brasnett, 113) and his &#145;tolerance, tenacity and humanity&#146;  (Hutchinson, 16). Milligan was appointed OBE in 1958, and he retired in 1959, but he retained an active interest in adult education until his death at Cheriton, Alexandra Road, St Ives, Cornwall, of lung cancer, on 18 August 1965. His wife survived him.<br>
