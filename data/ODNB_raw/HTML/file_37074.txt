<span class="headword">Young,  George</span>, Lord Young  (1819&#150;1907), <span class="occ">lawyer and politician</span>, was born on 2 July 1819 at Dumfries, the only son of Alexander Young of Rosefield, Kirkcudbrightshire, procurator fiscal of Dumfriesshire, and his wife, Marian, daughter of William Corsan of Dalwhat, Kirkcudbrightshire. He was educated at Dumfries Academy and thence proceeded to Edinburgh University. His intellectual powers were great enough to see him included in the honours list of the junior Scots law class of 1837. After a reportedly severe apprenticeship he was admitted as an advocate at the Scottish bar in December 1840. In July 1847 he married Janet (1829&#150;1901), daughter of George Graham Bell, advocate, of Crurie, Dumfriesshire. They had four surviving sons, all in the legal profession, and six daughters. One of these daughters, Lily, married Lord Mackenzie, also a judge in the court of session.<br>
<br>As an advocate Young was one of the most brilliant and successful court pleaders of his day. Described as having a tall, striking figure, an unfathomable face, &#145;luminous, piercing eyes&#146; and a &#145;resonant, incisive voice&#146;, he inspired &#145;the conviction that he was born to lead and not to follow&#146;  (<span class="italic">Juridical Review</span>, 209&#150;10). This powerful character showed in his style of pleading, which was carried on with the bench as between equals and in which he apparently refused to stoop to win verdicts by flattery or wheedling. Deliberate in his method, he seems to have adopted a coercive rather than a persuasive approach. He earned a reputation as merciless cross-examiner, who excelled in difficult and desperate cases.<br>
<br>Whatever criticisms he attracted, Young's practice prospered and his success was paralleled by his official career. He was appointed advocate-depute in 1849 and became sheriff of Inverness in 1853. From 1860 to 1862 he was sheriff of Haddington and Berwickshire. In 1857 he acted as junior counsel to John Inglis at the celebrated trial of Madeleine Smith for murder. Their successful conduct of her defence was due partly to Young's skill in its preparation. In this trial he was, as in others in this period, on the opposite side of the case to James Moncreiff. From November 1862, when he was appointed solicitor-general for Scotland in Lord Palmerston's government, he also worked under Moncreiff as lord advocate. Linked in the public mind as a result of their contribution to the development of Scottish education, the contrast between the two men was in fact marked. Young's forceful style as an advocate was coloured by a matter-of-fact coolness that could shade into sarcasm. Moncreiff, on the other hand, was fiery and eloquent. In a working relationship which was apparently not harmonious, Young was less than loyal to a man he is said arrogantly to have regarded as his intellectual inferior.<br>
<br>In 1865 Young was elected unopposed to parliament as the Liberal member for Wigtown burghs. His Liberalism was of the undogmatic kind and he canvassed support as an unashamed Palmerstonian. He continued as solicitor-general after Palmerston's death until the Russell government resigned in July 1866 and was appointed to the same office by Gladstone after the Liberal election victory in December 1868. Seemingly impatient for Moncreiff to move on, his opportunity came in November 1869 when he was himself appointed lord advocate. Young's tenure in this office was certainly the high point in his career. He ruled Scottish MPs with a verbal rod of iron and, though most of his attempts to pass legislation were frustrated, his achievement in finally passing a measure to create an effective national system of education in Scotland was a lasting monument. Although there is no doubt that the ground for the <span class="roman">Education (Scotland) Act</span> of 1872 had been long prepared by his predecessor, the passage of this particular measure owed a lot to Young's drive and flexibility. In effect he &#145;solved&#146; the religious question by leaving the management of schools to locally elected boards and therefore ensured that a system, which embodied compulsory elementary education supported by public funds and which stood the test of time, was at last put in place nearly twenty years after Moncreiff had first made the attempt.<br>
<br>In a parliament dominated by Irish land, English education, and army reform, Scottish business was otherwise marginalized. Although he was responsible for the <span class="roman">Public Health Act (Scotland)</span> in 1871, among the problems Young could not solve were the tenant farmers' grievances of hypothec and ground game, a failure which was to contribute to the poor Liberal showing in the Scottish counties at the 1874 election. Despite more than one attempt, Young was also unable to get very far with legislation to clarify and make sense of the Scottish law of entail. These difficulties do not appear to have turned Young's thoughts, as was the case in some of his Liberal parliamentary colleagues, towards a reform of the system of Scottish administration involving the appointment of a Scottish secretary. On the contrary, Young was reported to have contemplated the abolition of the court of session, for example. This would have been motivated partly by a desire to save money, but it would also have reflected his belief in the assimilation of the Scottish and English judicial systems.<br>
<br>Young was himself known and well regarded in English legal circles. In 1869 he was called to the English bar at the Middle Temple, London, of which he was made a bencher two years later. What were described as his bleak, inscrutable face and his thin compressed lips were said to be familiar to students at the Middle Temple, as he dined there during term time on regular visits to London, a habit he maintained for the remainder of his life.<br>
<br>At the 1874 general election Young initially, and very narrowly, lost Wigtown burghs. Poor treatment of the sheriff of Lanarkshire, Henry Glassford Bell, and the opposition of local Orangemen were held up at the time as significant contributory factors in this result. In the event, after an investigation the seat was eventually awarded to Young, but he had in the meantime agreed to become a judge of the court of session, taking his seat in March 1874.<br>
<br>Over the succeeding thirty-one years, until his resignation in 1905, Young earned a reputation with the public for his disregard of precedent, as well as for his sardonic wit and impatience. In the eyes of the legal profession his defects almost certainly outweighed his strengths and these may help to explain why he ended his career as an ordinary member of the second division of the court's inner house. Just as he had reportedly terrorized witnesses in cross-examination as counsel and refused to soothe deputations when lord advocate, so now as a judge Young, with a mixture of equity and dispatch, bludgeoned advocates into brevity and tried to manage their cases for them. One advocate was even said to have asked him if he would like to call his next witness. He had little respect for legal precedents if he thought they were unjust, and put much emphasis on simplifying underlying principles of jurisprudence, of which he was credited with having a firm grasp. Young frequently dissented from his colleagues, could show intolerance with those he thought were litigating over trifles, and was reported to have taken his dislike for authority to the extent of trying to block the application of a House of Lords' judgment in a case involving the Free Church. By contrast he was usually lenient in judging criminal cases, and his common-sense approach to procedure was applauded as a contribution to efficiency.<br>
<br>Young wrote his own opinions which, lacking in terseness and finish, were seen as reflecting a spoken style, an echo of the voice of an advocate in the position of a judge. At the bar he had acted, between 1842 and 1850, as a reporter of court of session cases for <span class="italic">Dunlop's Reports</span>. The demands of his growing practice led him to give this up and in accordance with the usual custom he wrote nothing for separate publication after he became a judge. Overall, his career on the bench could be said to have reflected his frustrated ambition. He was rumoured to be ready to step down from the bench when Gladstone returned to office in 1880, because he missed life in London and the conscious exercise of power involved in holding political office.<br>
<br>Young, who was praised by his friends as capable of disinterested kindness and of being able to draw people out in conversation, could also snub and offend. He became famous for witty&#151;the victim might have said sarcastic&#151;sayings, which caught the attention of London as well as of Edinburgh society. Some may not even have originated from him, but Young was credited with them anyway. Thus, for instance, the gift of half a million pounds, given by James Baird to the Church of Scotland, was described as &#145;the heaviest insurance against fire on record&#146;, and a Free Churchman appearing before him in court was told he might be a good man in spite of his denominational allegiance. Young was an admirer of Tennyson and counted among his friends Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman and above all Lord Rosebery. His summers were regularly spent at Silverknowes, near the Rosebery estate at Dalmeny. Among the honours conferred on him were his appointment as a privy councillor in 1872. He was created LLD by Edinburgh University in 1871 and by Glasgow in 1879.<br>
<br>Two years after Young resigned from the bench, on one of his visits to London he fainted, fell, and broke a rib, in the Middle Temple. He had been in robust good health until late in life, which he attributed to his hobby of walking. After a month's illness he died in a London nursing home on 21 May 1907. He was buried in St John's Episcopal churchyard in Edinburgh on 24 May. At the time of his death Young was praised as having been a powerful and successful advocate. As a judge he was seen, depending on the standpoint of the commentator, either as wilful and oblivious to precedent, or as forceful and humorous, and at his best when dissenting. His historical significance lies in his achievement in bringing to fruition James Moncreiff's efforts to create a compulsory national system of education in Scotland.<br>
