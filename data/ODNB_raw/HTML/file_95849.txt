<span class="headword">Page, Sir  Frederick William</span>  (1917&#150;2005), <span class="occ">aircraft designer and industrialist</span>, was born on 20 February 1917 in Wimbledon, Surrey, the only child of Richard Page, a chauffeur then serving in the army, and his wife, Ellen Sarah, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Potter (<i>d</i>. 1960). His father was killed on active service in France during the First World War shortly before his birth. Brought up in humble circumstances by his widowed mother, he won a scholarship to Rutlish Grammar School at Merton, Surrey, before gaining a Surrey county major scholarship and entrance to St Catharine's College, Cambridge, in 1935. Reading mathematics and aeronautics, he achieved the rare distinction of starred first-class honours in the mechanical sciences tripos. Ambitious from his mid-teens to design aircraft, in 1938 he joined Hawker Aircraft at Kingston upon Thames, working under Sydney Camm, designer of the famous Second World War Hurricane fighter. There he worked during the war on the Hurricane, Typhoon, and Tempest aircraft, designing structures, control systems, and high-speed aerofoil sections. On 6 July 1940 he married Kathleen Edith de Courcy (1916&#150;1993), a 24-year-old ARP warden, and daughter of Albert Edwin de Courcy, post office official. They had three sons, Gordon, Stephen, and Alan, and a daughter, Jennifer.<br>
<br>Such were Page's demonstrated abilities that in 1945 he was invited to join W. E. W. (Teddy) Petter's newly created aircraft design team at English Electric in Preston, Lancashire. Over the next thirty years Page was to play a leading role in both design and management in the very advanced military combat aircraft programmes emanating from what, largely under his inspired direction and guidance, became the most accomplished military aircraft organization in Europe. The initiating project there was a jet bomber replacement for the wartime de Havilland Mosquito, in the conception of which he was centrally involved and which was realized as the highly successful Canberra, Britain's first jet bomber. First flown in May 1949, it proceeded swiftly through development and into production.<br>
<br>Now located at nearby Warton, Page was appointed assistant chief designer later in 1949 and, after the resignation of Petter, he was made chief engineer in 1950 at the age of only thirty-two, and played a major role in bringing the Canberra into operational service. Serving with the Royal Air Force from May 1951 and with fourteen overseas air forces in twenty-one variants, and capturing twenty-two world distance and altitude records, the total production of this aircraft ran to 1376 units, including licensed production in the United States and Australia, the last example continuing in service with the RAF until 2007. In parallel Page guided Petter's first studies of the P-1A twin-engined supersonic research aircraft initiated in August 1948, incorporating a 60&deg; wing sweepback. The P-1A was first flown in August 1954, becoming the first British (and European) aircraft to achieve sustained supersonic speeds. His team then went on to evolve this aircraft into the Lightning supersonic fighter for the RAF. First flown in April 1957, the Lightning became the first British aircraft to exceed Mach 2 (twice the speed of sound, i.e. 1400 m.p.h.) in level flight. No other aircraft design team anywhere in the world made the transition from subsonic to bisonic flight in one leap (while also incorporating a complex weapons system). The Lightning entered operational service in June 1961, and a total of 340 were produced in six variants for the RAF and for export. Most significantly, the Lightning formed the basis of a series of major contracts in the Middle East, notably for Saudi Arabia, and the starting point for the huge exports of military equipment to that country that followed.<br>
<br>In 1957 Page's team began studies to meet the RAF's general operational requirement GOR339 for a supersonic successor to the Canberra&#151;the bisonic tactical, strike, and reconnaissance TSR2&#151;also intended as a &#145;golden welding flux&#146; in facilitating the concentration of the UK's then twenty-two airframe and six engine companies into three and two large units respectively. The eventual government contract was placed in March 1959 with Vickers&#150;Armstrongs at Weybridge, Surrey, with English Electric as a 50 per cent partner. Accordingly, when English Electric Aviation was formed that year Page was appointed chief executive. The TSR2 programme was effectively the means for the creation of the government-enforced merger of the two companies, together with Bristol Aircraft, to form the British Aircraft Corporation (BAC) in January 1960. However, this very advanced and complex programme was dogged by excessively demanding equipment changes and performance increases that also meant it was beset by corresponding delays and cost escalation that in turn greatly exacerbated its political vulnerability. Although the first example had flown successfully in September 1964, and essentially demonstrated its formidable performance capability, and Page had belatedly been given overall programme responsibility, it was precipitously cancelled by the incoming Labour government in the budget of April 1965, just as quantity production was about to begin. What would have constituted around half the forward military aircraft workload of the new joint company until well into the 1970s was thus lost at a stroke, presenting Page with the daunting management challenge of reconstructing the seriously depleted Warton workforce to maintain its nationally essential core competence.<br>
<br>By mid-1965 an inter-governmental agreement with France was sealed to give the go-ahead to a joint programme with Dassault&#150;Breguet and a management company, Sepecat, for a new supersonic fighter-bomber and advanced trainer, later named Jaguar and first flown in France in September 1968, Page was appointed co-chairman of Sepecat, with a French counterpart. A total of 200 aircraft each was produced for the RAF and for the French air force, and ninety-four for export by BAC to Ecuador, Oman, and India, where Page also played a leading part in the establishment of the licenced production of an initial batch of seventy-six Jaguars, which was subsequently augmented by further large batches. He later also became chairman of Panavia, the Anglo-German-Italian joint company formed in 1969 in Munich with Messerschmitt&#150;B&ouml;lkow&#150;Blohm and Fiat to produce the supersonic, variable wing sweepback, multi-role combat Tornado. First flown by BAC in August 1974, 872 were jointly produced for the three home countries, with a further 120 exported to Saudi Arabia in the al-Yamamah programme.<br>
<br>In 1967 Page had become chairman of the BAC military aircraft division. Five years later he was appointed BAC's managing director (aircraft), with the added responsibility as chairman of BAC's commercial aircraft division of rationalizing the company's then struggling commercial aircraft portfolio and rebalancing the company's overall aircraft work loading. In this, his perceptive and imaginative industrial management strategies and techniques in financial and risk management, as well as technical and multiple programme management, were a key ingredient in the run-up to the long-threatened government edict nationalizing the aircraft industry. In particular, his earlier developed &#145;matrix&#146; management structure&#151;wherein the corporate functional control lines were meshed with the multiple programme operational lines&#151;proved to be consistently effective. Eventually implemented in 1977, bringing together BAC, Hawker Siddeley Aviation, and Scottish Aviation, nationalization resulted in the creation of British Aerospace, of whose aircraft group Page was appointed chairman and chief executive. His final appointment, this presented him with a further substantial managerial challenge in initiating the progressive return of the company to private ownership in 1982.<br>
<br>Appointed CBE in 1961 and knighted in 1979, Page was also made a fellow of the Royal Society (1978), the Fellowship of Engineering, later the Royal Academy of Engineering (1977), an honorary fellow of the Royal Aeronautical Society (1980), and received numerous other honours, including the British gold medal for aeronautics in 1962 for his &#145;outstanding practical contribution to aircraft design&#146;, and the gold medal of the Royal Aeronautical Society in 1974. Formally retiring from the board of British Aerospace in June 1983, he then served on the councils of the Royal Society and the Royal Academy of Engineering, which included a two-and-a-half-year study of acidic emissions, and the council of the Royal Institution, before fully retiring in 1990. He died of myelodysplasia on 29 May 2005 at Avon Reach nursing home, Farm Lane, Mudeford, Dorset. He was survived by his four children, the eldest of whom, Gordon, also became an aeronautical engineer and chairman of Cobham plc, a specialist aerospace and defence equipment company.<br>
<br>Of outstanding ability and integrity, Page&#151;affectionately known to his professional colleagues as Freddie&#151;was one of the most highly accomplished and highly regarded British aircraft designers and industrial leaders of his generation. Entering the industry during the extreme pressures of wartime expediency, and in the immediate post-war years becoming centrally engaged in the pioneering of the jet age and the supersonic era of military aircraft, his forty-five-year aviation career spanned some of the most demanding times and situations in British and world affairs and for the aeronautical industry in particular&#151;and throughout which he lived out his teenage ambition to the full. Pioneering and inspiring a generation of leading-edge aviation technologies and a progressive and innovative industrial management style and techniques that in many respects were well ahead of his contemporaries, he went on to become one of the key figures in the large-scale integration of the British aircraft industry and in international collaboration in Europe. All of this also resulted in the provision of hugely valuable high-calibre employment and commercial and export benefits for Britain and Europe.<br>
