<span class="headword">Allen, Sir  James</span>  (1855&#150;1942), <span class="occ">politician in New Zealand</span>, was born on 10 February 1855 in Adelaide, South Australia, the son of James Allen and his wife, Esther, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Bax. His mother died when he was very young and his father, a New Zealand businessman and property speculator, soon took him to Dunedin, the provincial capital of Otago, New Zealand. In the early 1860s he and his brother Charles were sent to England and placed in the care of an uncle in Cockhill, Somerset. Their father returned to Dunedin, where he died in 1865.<br>
<br>After attending a boarding-school in Somerset with his brother, Allen was educated at Clifton College, Bristol (1869&#150;74). He went on to St John's College, Cambridge (followed by his brother), where he specialized in mineralogy and graduated with a third-class degree in the natural sciences tripos in 1878. At university he excelled in rowing and rugby. On 23 August 1877 he had married, at Evercreech, his cousin Mary Jane Hill Richards (<i>d</i>. 1939), the daughter of John Richards, a farmer of Alford in Somerset. They had three daughters and three sons.<br>
<br>Following a teaching stint at Harrow School, Allen returned to Dunedin, where he had inherited considerable property. He gained his first political experience with a seat on the city council from 1880 to 1883, during which time he became a well-known local figure. Back in England between 1884 and 1887, he spent three successful years in London at the Normal School of Science and the Royal School of Mines. When his businesses in Otago called him back to New Zealand he used his new knowledge to add coal- and goldmining to his interests. In 1887 he rose rapidly to national prominence by dramatically seizing the Dunedin East seat in the house of representatives from the premier, Sir Robert Stout.<br>
<br>Allen was among the conservatives who lost their seats in the Liberal victory of 1890, but two years later he was returned as the member for Bruce at a by-election. His reputation for integrity and hard-working soundness and solidity was eventually rewarded, and in 1903 he was generally recognized as the only possible rival to William Massey when the leadership of the opposition fell vacant. His lack of charisma, even compared with that of Massey, ensured however that he stood no chance; and he slipped easily into the role of the new leader's loyal and dependable deputy.<br>
<br>Allen became the leading opposition spokesman on defence matters, pursuing an interest long held through training in volunteer defence units (in which he ultimately reached the rank of colonel). He also developed a long-standing interest in education at all levels. His vigorous personal support of the &#145;bibles-in-schools&#146; movement reflected a lifelong interest in religion. He was the last life member appointed to Otago University's council (1887) and served as its vice-chancellor (1903&#150;9) and chancellor (1909&#150;12). As a member of the senate of the University of New Zealand Allen would&#151;unusually for him&#151;take up some progressive causes, such as the appointment of examiners from within New Zealand. But he was more usually to be found attacking the Liberal government's radicalism and its alleged profligacy in spending and borrowing.<br>
<br>Allen became deputy to the premier when Massey established the Reform ministry in July 1912. In view of his interests he was selected to take up the defence, education, and finance portfolios. In these he found it difficult&#151;especially in economic matters&#151;to live up to promises of fundamental change. However, there were initiatives in education, including statutory funding for university colleges and a general educational restructuring in 1914, and developments in defence, such as efforts to increase efficiency in the compulsory military training programme. His most important achievement in peacetime was the procurement in 1913, in the face of &#145;bullying&#146; opposition by the first lord of the Admiralty, Winston Churchill  (diary, 21 April 1914, Grant-Duff MSS, CAC Cam.), of Britain's consent to dedicated naval forces for New Zealand. Later that year, after initial doubts, he acquiesced in the government's sometimes clandestine use of the military in its determination to crush organized labour during the &#145;great strike&#146;.<br>
<br>Allen's particular strength was organization, and his careful shepherding of defence administration enabled the dominion to make a quick and easy adjustment to wartime mode in 1914. A New Zealand expeditionary force seized German Samoa shortly after the outbreak of the First World War in August, and by mid-October the bulk of the main New Zealand expeditionary force had left for the Middle East, in line with Allen's war contingency plans. (Previously, he had vigorously championed the idea of a force ready to react to disturbance anywhere in the empire, a concept even right-wing observers felt to be imperialist &#145;militarism run mad&#146;  (Weitzel, 138).) The creation of a national coalition government in August 1915, the month his youngest son died at Gallipoli, left him able to concentrate solely on the defence portfolio.<br>
<br>Not only was Allen New Zealand's war leader from August 1916, he was also acting prime minister for a total of nearly two years. This resulted from the frequent absences overseas (on imperial, war, and peace business) of Massey and his <i>de facto</i> co-leader in the National Government, Sir Joseph Ward. His wartime role was, however, punctuated by controversies. In particular, serious opposition to the government's initial reliance on voluntary war service was targeted at the defence minister. Then from 1916 he was under severe attack from the opposite perspective when cabinet did endorse his arguments for the introduction of conscription&#151;including for the draconian way in which he applied the system. But the views of the commander of the expeditionary force (who did not like his reserved, humourless demeanour) sum up his overall reputation in this period: his pre-war &#145;efforts to improve the status and organisation of the New Zealand forces&#146; had provided an &#145;invaluable&#146; base for the war effort. &#145;I cannot say enough of all the help and support that he gave to me and to all the units of the force&#146; during the conflict  (General Sir Alexander Godley, archives of St John's College, Cambridge, ref. 4257).<br>
<br>Weary of the problems posed by post-war rehabilitation, Allen prepared to leave politics at the 1919 general election. But with the demise of the coalition government in August of that year he was persuaded to stay on and also to take up the finance portfolio again. On narrowly retaining his seat he added to his defence and financial portfolios that of New Zealand's first minister of external affairs. His acceptance of this position, that of administering the dominion's interests in the Pacific, reflected a long-standing fascination in the region; in 1903 he had published <span class="italic">New Zealand's Possessions in the South Seas</span>. He now instituted arrangements for exercising his country's League of Nations mandate in Western Samoa.<br>
<br>But in 1920 Allen finally relinquished politics for diplomacy to become New Zealand's high-profile high commissioner in the United Kingdom. He now championed imperial co-operation and the sanctity of British imperialism with the same enthusiastic conviction which had led him during wartime to secure the highest proportion of men in uniform in the empire. After his return to Dunedin in 1926 he continued to pursue his international interests, presiding for example for a dozen years over the new dominion branch of the Institute of Pacific Relations, as well as serving on its Pacific council.<br>
<br>As high commissioner Allen had represented his country at the League of Nations, where he had displayed a frugality over financial policy which had increasingly become his characteristic during his years of ministerial responsibilities. His essential conservatism, coupled with his practical experiences, had, however, brought him to believe that international co-operation was a vain hope: the best one could hope for was a <i>pax Britannica</i> resting on the Royal Navy and the might of the British empire. As an active legislative councillor after his appointment to the second chamber on 1 June 1927, he focused on imperial and international affairs.<br>
<br>Allen was appointed KCB in 1917, for his contribution to the war effort, and GCMG in 1926. He ceased to attend legislative council meetings a year before his wife's death in 1939, and his appointment as a councillor lapsed in 1941. He died on 28 July 1942 at his home, Arana, Clyde Street, Dunedin, and was buried at the city's northern cemetery. He had been a highly efficient&#151;if unglamorous&#151;statesman and administrator. He was unfazed by criticism, and his reputation rests principally on his firm organizational control over New Zealand's preparations for and operations of war. It might be said that he epitomized the rather dull conservatism of many New Zealand politicians of the post-pioneering period; it might also be said that he embodied, at a high level of probity and effectiveness, a cautiousness and consolidationism that was virtually inevitable given the temper of his times. Either way, a recent assessment that he &#145;deserves a more prominent place in New Zealand history than he has hitherto been given&#146;  (Baker, 224) is vindicated by a reassessment of the evidence.<br>
