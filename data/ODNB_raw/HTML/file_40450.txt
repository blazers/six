<span class="headword">Baddeley,  (Madeleine) Angela</span>  (1904&#150;1976), <span class="occ">actress</span>, was born on 4 July 1904 at 64 Pretoria Road, West Ham, London, one of the four daughters of William Herman Clinton-Baddeley, journalist, and his wife, Louise Rosalie Bourdin. She was a descendant of Sir Henry Clinton, the British general who captured New York during the American War of Independence. A first marriage, to Stephen Kerr Thomas, was short-lived, but produced a daughter. After a divorce she married on 8 July 1929 <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/40205/', "Glencairn Alexander Byam Shaw (1904&#150;1986)")</script>, with whom she had a son and a daughter. Byam Shaw was an actor and theatrical producer known for his work with theatrical classics and in opera.<br>
<br>Angela Baddeley made her professional d&eacute;but in London in 1915 and by her early twenties had become one of the leading actresses on the West End stage. Her performance in <span class="italic">Richard III</span> was the first of many classical roles, but she played in many different kinds of production&#151;as did her sister, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/39923/', "Hermione Baddeley (1906&#150;1986)")</script>&#151;and was known as a versatile actress. Some theatre critics wondered if she was almost too versatile, in that she never concentrated on one kind of role, but such a professional attitude served Baddeley well, as her career in live theatre lasted until her death. James Agate once favourably commented that she could be &#145;an ing&eacute;nue without being a ninny&#146;, and Baddeley's versatility in performance came from what many viewed as a charming personality and depth of sensitivity. She was known to possess a &#145;subtle technique&#146;, which she developed throughout her long career. Her early theatre work included frequent stints as Jenny Diver in the long-running revival (1920&#150;23) of John Gay's <span class="italic">The Beggar's Opera</span>, as well as roles in popular new plays such as J. M. Barrie's <span class="italic">Mary Rose</span>. She toured Australia with the theatrical producer Dion Boucicault and was as likely to be working in the West End as in one of the independent or more experimental theatres of the day, such as the Everyman at Hampstead or the &#145;Q&#146; in Richmond. Notable performances were those in R. B. Sheridan's <span class="italic">School for Scandal</span> (as Lady Teazle in 1927) and as Florrie in W. Somerset Maugham's expressionistic play <span class="italic">Sheppey</span> (1933). During the 1930s she became well known for her work in productions of Emlyn Williams's plays, and was one of his favourite actresses.<br>
<br>Williams's work began to have a real impact on the West End theatre in the mid-1930s and Angela Baddeley played to great acclaim as Olivia Grayne in his macabre <span class="italic">Night Must Fall</span> in 1935. This role took her to her American stage d&eacute;but at the Barrymore Theater in New York in 1936. She worked a great deal with Williams during the 1930s and 1940s, often playing opposite him in lead roles, and became a founder member of what Richard Huggett claims can be loosely termed the Emlyn Williams repertory players. The connection with Williams also entangled her with Binkie Beaumont, one of the most powerful theatre producers of the day. Beaumont was notoriously camera-shy, despite, or perhaps because of, his immense power within the fairly closed London theatrical world of the mid-twentieth century, and Baddeley features, along with Williams, in one of the most famous first publicity shots of Beaumont printed in <span class="italic">The Tatler</span> in 1947. The photo, taken by the prolific and influential theatrical photographer of the day Angus McBean shows Beaumont as the &#145;puppet master&#146; controlling the strings of the actors (Baddeley and Williams) in yet another of his West End hit productions, Terence Rattigan's <span class="italic">The Winslow Boy</span>. Baddeley's association with Beaumont and his production company from the 1930s to the 1950s led to significant roles in such plays as Dodie Smith's <span class="italic">Dear Octopus</span> (1938) and Williams's <span class="italic">The Light of Heart</span> (1939). She starred alongside such notable performers of the day as Michael Redgrave and Gladys Cooper. A notable performance was in No&euml;l Coward's <span class="italic">Relative Values</span>, produced by Beaumont in 1950 as part of the Festival of Industry and the Arts.<br>
<br>Angela Baddeley was also acclaimed as a Shakespearian actor. She was a member of the Old Vic company in the late 1940s, and had major roles during numerous seasons at the Royal Memorial Theatre in Stratford upon Avon in the 1950s. Especially noteworthy were her appearances as the Nurse in <span class="italic">Romeo and Juliet</span>, and as Mrs Hardcastle in Oliver Goldsmith's <span class="italic">She Stoops to Conquer</span>. Her own favourite roles were as Cattrin in <span class="italic">The Light of Heart</span> by Emlyn Williams and Stella in J. B. Priestley's <span class="italic">Eden End</span>. In 1975 she was appointed CBE.<br>
<br>Unusually for a female actor, Baddeley sustained a career in live performance until her death, when she was appearing as Madame Armfeldt in <span class="italic">A Little Night Music</span> by Stephen Sondheim in the West End. But her most significant triumph in her later years was the immense popularity of her Mrs Bridges in the ITV television series <span class="italic">Upstairs Downstairs</span>, a chronicle of an upper-class Edwardian household. Baddeley played the feisty cook throughout the series, which lasted from 1971 to 1975, and there were even rumours of plans for a follow-on series which focused on the relationship between Mrs Bridges and the butler, Mr Hudson (played by Gordon Jackson), now married and running a seaside boarding-house. Such rumours were never borne out as Angela Baddeley died following a serious viral flu infection on 22 February 1976 at Grayshott Hall, Grayshott, Hampshire, near Haslemere. She was survived by her second husband.<br>
