<span class="headword">Marx <span class="st"> [<em>known as </em> Marx-Aveling]</span>,  (Jenny Julia) Eleanor</span>  (1855&#150;1898), <span class="occ">socialist writer and activist</span>, was born on 16 January 1855 at 28 Dean Street, Soho, London, the sixth child of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/39021/', "Karl Marx (1818&#150;1883)")</script>, revolutionary socialist philosopher, and his wife, Jenny (1814&#150;1881), daughter of Baron Johann Ludwig von Westphalen, Trier city councillor, and his wife, Caroline. Eleanor, who quickly acquired among her intimates the lifelong nickname Tussy, was the youngest by eleven years of three sisters, the other three children of the Marx household having died in infancy. Although born in a cramped and insalubrious flat in Soho, Eleanor spent her early years in a terraced house in Kentish Town, to which the Marxes moved in September 1856, before settling in a spacious villa in Maitland Park in 1864. She attended the South Hampstead College for Ladies, leaving at the age of fourteen with rather a haphazard education.<br>
<br>The Marx household itself, however, provided Eleanor with extensive exposure to politics and literature, which were to be her lifelong intellectual and practical interests. Her mother described her as &#145;political from top to toe&#146;. She visited Ireland with her father's collaborator, Friedich Engels, in 1869 and passionately supported the Fenian cause. But it was the Paris Commune of 1871 and its bloody suppression that marked her serious introduction to political activism. Both her sisters married Frenchmen who were committed to the socialist cause, and both settled in France. Eleanor was active in helping to organize aid for the French refugees in London and was herself briefly arrested while on a visit to France in August 1871.<br>
<br>The commune also left Eleanor Marx with a very different kind of legacy. She fell in love with, and became engaged to, Hyppolite Prosper Olivier Lissagaray, one of its more flamboyant refugees, who belonged to an old Basque family and was exactly twice her age. Both her parents strongly disapproved. She took a post in a ladies' seminary in Brighton for six months in 1873, but returned to London to look after her father, whose health had seriously and permanently deteriorated. Forbidden by parental authority to see Lissagaray, Eleanor threw herself into literary activity. She went regularly to the British Museum, where she worked for Frederick Furnivall's Philological, Chaucer, and Shakespeare societies. She became friendly with actors such as Ernest Radford and Dolly Maitland, and planned unsuccessfully for a career on the stage. Increasingly imprisoned by the ill health of her parents, to whose interests she felt she had &#145;sacrificed the best, precious years of my life&#146;, she was liberated only by the death of her father in 1883.<br>
<br>In 1884 Eleanor began to live openly with <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/40929/', "Edward Bibbens Aveling (1849&#150;1898)")</script>, a married man and a well-qualified zoologist with oratorical talent, whose commitment to socialism was as genuine as his character was fickle. Her attachment to Aveling (whose name she used in conjunction with her own) did, however, provide Eleanor with a firm sense of direction. She began to give public addresses on social and political matters, thus developing her talents in explaining Marxism with reference to the practical needs and interests of her audience. She had been active in the early years of the Social Democratic Federation, sitting on its executive committee, but resigned in 1885 together with (among others) Belfort Bax and William Morris to found the Socialist League. Nor did she neglect her writing: she published a pamphlet entitled <span class="italic">The Woman Question</span> (1886), translated Lissagaray's <span class="italic">History of the Commune</span> (1886), produced the first English version of Flaubert's <span class="italic">Madame Bovary</span> (1886), and even learned Norwegian to translate Ibsen. From 1887 onwards she became more directly involved in labour unrest: she made frequent visits to the East End of London, where she was particularly involved in the defence of Jewish workers, was active in support of the gas workers' and dockers' strikes of 1889, and sat for several years on the council of the Gas Workers and General Labourers Union. Further afield, she was present at the founding congress of the Second International in Paris in 1889, where she was an indefatigable translator and interpreter. Her finest hour was perhaps her speech at the Brussels Congress of the International in 1891. Published later as a penny pamphlet under the title <span class="italic">Report from Great Britain and Ireland</span>, it was a lengthy document presented in the name of the Gas Workers and General Labourers Union, the Legal Eight Hours and International Labour League, the Bloomsbury Socialist Society, and the Battersea Labour League.<br>
<br>Although she attended the founding conference of the Independent Labour Party in Bradford in 1893 and again addressed the Z&uuml;rich Congress of the International in the same year, Eleanor's morale began to undergo a slow but fatal descent. Always close to Engels, she felt herself increasingly excluded, particularly by his new housekeeper Louise Freyberger. There were several disagreements about how Marx's manuscripts should be dealt with, though Eleanor did edit and publish editions of her father's writings on eighteenth- and nineteenth-century history and politics. The death of Engels in September 1895 and his revelations about the paternity of Marx's illegitimate son, Frederick Demuth, whose paternity Engels had assumed and to whom Eleanor was very close, were hard blows from which she never recovered. She continued to lecture, began to collaborate again with the Social Democratic Federation, and was secretary to the committee organizing the 1896 London Congress of the International. But Eleanor Marx felt sidelined, as it was becoming clear that the influence of Marxism on the British socialist movement would be limited, and the mid-1890s saw a reversal of what had seemed an irresistible tide of working-class political progress. Her death was precipitated by Aveling's secret marriage to Eva Frye in June 1897. Eleanor learned about this in August, and although she continued to live on and off with Aveling she committed suicide by taking prussic acid on 31 March 1898 at her home, 7 Jews Walk, Sydenham, Kent. She was cremated on 5 April at Woking.<br>
