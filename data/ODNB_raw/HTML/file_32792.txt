<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Soissons,  Louis Emmanuel Jean Guy  de</span>  (1890&#150;1962), <span class="occ">architect and town planner</span>, was born in Montreal, Canada, on 31 July 1890, the younger son of Charles de Soissons and his wife, Julie, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Rozwadowska. When he and his brother and sister were small, the family moved to London.<br>
<br>De Soissons's early education was at Bewshers and Colet Court, the preparatory school for St Paul's, but he did not continue on to a public school. He knew early that he would be an architect and at the age of sixteen was articled to J. H. Eastwood. From 1906 to 1911 he attended evening classes at the Royal Academy. He became the Royal Institute of British Architects' Tite prizeman (1912) and then their Henry Jarvis student at the British School at Rome (1913). He next went to the &Eacute;cole des Beaux-Arts, attending the atelier Duquesne and winning three medals, but returned from Paris when the First World War broke out. Back in Britain, he tried to enlist in a line regiment but short sight precluded this. Instead, he served with the Army Service Corps and later undertook liaison duties with the Italian army. He was mentioned in dispatches, appointed OBE in 1918, was awarded the <i>croce di guerra</i>, and was made a <i>cavaliere</i> of the order of the Crown of Italy. He also worked with the War Claims Commission where his fluent French and Italian were useful.<br>
<br>After the war de Soissons returned briefly to his studies at the Beaux-Arts. There followed a short-lived partnership with Philip Hepworth, followed by a longer-lasting but informal arrangement with George Grey Wornum. In 1919 destiny placed a finger upon de Soissons. Ebenezer Howard, the doyen of the garden-city movement, had in 1919 impetuously decided to start a second town for 40,000&#150;50,000 near Welwyn to take up the torch from his first experiment at Letchworth. The initial sketch-plan came from a Letchworth architect, but the sapient Sir Theodore Chambers, chairman of Welwyn Garden City Ltd, then asked the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA) to recommend an architect-planner. In April 1920 de Soissons was appointed to produce a revised plan, with the duty also of company architect. He presented his plan in June. Its subsequent development and implementation revealed a breadth of interests and skills of design and decision-making which proved to be in excellent balance. Besides laying out the whole plan of Welwyn Garden City, de Soissons designed a high proportion of its civic buildings, its early factories, and its housing. On behalf of the company he had the final decision about the work of other architects in the town, which he always exercised with respect for his fellow professionals. When in 1948 Welwyn Garden City was expanded into one of the government's post-war new towns, de Soissons was confirmed as planner and his firm laid out the large extension scheme.<br>
<br>On 29 April 1922 de Soissons married Elinor Maude Charlotte Penrose-Thackwell, with whom he had three sons. They set up their first home in the embryo new town and he lived in or near it from then on, believing that such a responsibility should not be discharged from a distance. He knew that while a plan could provide a strategy, it was the detail that would touch people's feelings. The results are evident in the pleasure of moving around the town and in the active affection that it generates among its inhabitants.<br>
<br>What is known of de Soissons's architectural philosophy has to be derived mainly from his work and conversation, for he wrote little. He perceived architectural quality without prejudice about style, but had a personal affection for the Italian Renaissance, the eighteenth-century English and American classical vernacular, especially the buildings of Nantucket, and Regency Brighton, Cheltenham, and Leamington. He was too independent to be greatly influenced by any of this or by Welwyn Garden City's immediate predecessors, Letchworth (which he did not much like) and Hampstead Garden Suburb. Like them, his town was conceived as having a formal civic centre surrounded by informal residential areas. The latter were innovatively planned and invested with exceptional natural charm. Yet it was one of his main contributions to the garden-city movement that despite their relaxed and natural character, his streets and housing are distinctively urban in idiom and are not villages writ large. This was a lesson de Soissons had absorbed from the Liverpool school of architect-planners such as Stanley Adhead and Patrick Abercrombie. He developed their neo-Georgian style with suavity and flexibility, but could design flat-roofed houses when asked to. His industrial buildings at Welwyn Garden City were also notable: he attempted, for instance, to confer architectural quality upon the banal &#145;sectional factories&#146; hitherto built for leasing on trading estates.<br>
<br>De Soissons did much other inter-war housing for people of low and middle incomes, in part through the patronage of Sir Theodore Chambers. He was architect to the duchy of Cornwall estate in Kennington, London, and was one of a small group with whom Edward VIII as prince and king discussed housing problems. He served on the Central Housing Advisory Committee and the Burt committee, appointed after 1945 to promote innovation in construction. He was greatly pleased by an invitation just before the war to design barracks for the brigade of guards and after 1945 to rebuild Carlton House Terrace for the Foreign Office&#151;but sadly both had to be cancelled. He did popular work at Cheltenham. As senior partner in the extended post-war firm of Louis De Soissons, Peacock, Hodges, and Robertson, he participated in rebuilding the bombed centre of Plymouth, as well as further housing in the west country. Among much other work he was responsible for the George VI memorial in Carlton Gardens, the Hobbs memorial gates at the Oval, the restoration of the Nash terraces in Regent's Park, and buildings at Cheltenham College. He was architect to the Imperial War Graves Commission for Greece and Italy, where his firm meticulously designed and planted war cemeteries rivalling the best built after the First World War; one of the largest and most moving is at Cassino. He believed in personal commitment in design and was the final arbiter in the office. He conveyed his ideas with decisive comments and quick sketches, and expected them to be carried out exactly. He was, however, more open-minded about modern work in the office than his personal tastes might suggest.<br>
<br>In 1923 de Soissons was made a fellow of RIBA and a member of both the Town Planning Institute and the Soci&eacute;t&eacute; des Architectes Dipl&ocirc;m&eacute;s par le Gouvernement. But he was not an &#145;institute&#146; man and preferred to put effort into the Architectural Association School (1929&#150;33) where he was a vice-principal of the upper school and a tough, incisive critic. He was also active at the Royal Academy, to which he was elected in 1953 (having become an associate in 1942) and where he served as treasurer from 1959, and at the Royal Fine Arts Commission (1949&#150;61). He was also involved with F. R. Yerbury in founding the Building Centre. He was awarded the RIBA distinction in town planning in 1945 and was made CVO in 1956, the honour that he most greatly valued.<br>
<br>De Soissons dressed like a Frenchman, sporting a moustache, round glasses, and a beret, frequently with the addition of a bow-tie. He loved good food and wine, sculpture, and paintings (James Woodford and Charles Cundall were among his close friends), but he did not particularly enjoy theatre or music. He read quickly and enjoyed the best current architectural journals, especially French, Italian, and Scandinavian. He was a devotee of whodunits and of the novels of Dickens, Dumas, and Zane Grey. Though averse to publicity, he was gregarious and friendly with anyone who gained his respect, whatever they were and wherever he found them. He made every day an event for those with him at the time, for he had great vitality and a strong sense of fun. Religious or political compatibility was irrelevant. When he walked into a pub he would look quickly around and give a greeting, and he resented any lack of response. Not a sporting man himself, he enjoyed the idea of field sports, and walking holidays gave him pleasure at one stage. He was a member of the Athenaeum and the Arts Club, but not a club devotee. Among his architectural contemporaries he admired Sir Edwin Lutyens, with whom he once worked briefly, Sir Giles Gilbert Scott, H. S. Goodhart-Rendel, Charles James, and Frank Lloyd Wright. His own closest collaborator in his firm was Kenneth Peacock, with whom he designed the war cemeteries.<br>
<br>De Soissons was first, last, and always a practical architect; and although he wanted the challenge of major set-piece architecture, Welwyn Garden City is likely to be viewed in history as his great achievement, especially its plan and its residential areas. He died at the London Clinic on 23 September 1962.<br>
