<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Taylor,  William</span>  (1765&#150;1836), <span class="occ">reviewer and translator</span>, was born on 7 November 1765 in Surrey Street, Norwich, the only child of William Taylor (1731/2&#150;1819), merchant, and his wife, Sarah (1735/6&#150;1812), daughter of John Wright of Debenham, Suffolk, and later Diss. Intended for a mercantile career, he was tutored in languages from an early age by John Bruckner, pastor of the French and Dutch protestant churches in Norwich. In 1774 he was sent to the recently opened school at Palgrave, near Diss, run by Rochemont and Anna Letitia Barbauld. The latter made a profound impact on Taylor, who subsequently described her as &#145;the mother of his mind&#146;  (Robberds, 2.570). Removed from the school in 1779, he was taken on a business tour of the Netherlands, France, and Italy by his father's trading partner, Casanave. After briefly returning to Norwich in 1781, Taylor was sent away again, this time to Germany, where he spent a year mastering German in Detmold. There he was befriended by Lorenz Benzler (1747&#150;1827), a minor literary figure who nurtured Taylor's interest in contemporary German writing and confirmed his literary proclivities. Taylor returned to Norwich at the end of 1782 and immediately entered the family business; a <span class="italic">Norwich Directory</span> for 1783 lists &#145;Taylor Wm. Son and Casanave, <i>Merchants</i>&#146;. In his leisure hours he immersed himself in literary pursuits and read widely in heterodox literature. He resumed an important friendship with Frank Sayers, begun at the Barbaulds' school; it is possible the two men were lovers, and probable, in any case, that Taylor was homosexual.<br>
<br>Ostensibly a Unitarian like his parents, in the late 1780s Taylor became increasingly prominent in the whiggish and dissenting intellectual circles in Norwich. He actively supported such liberal causes as the abolition of the slave trade and repeal of the <span class="roman">Test and Corporation Acts</span>. He gained a reputation as a formidable conversationalist with a passion for argument. His literary efforts became more ambitious and increasingly reflected his other concerns: about 1789 he made an accomplished translation of Goethe's <span class="italic">Iphigenie auf Tauris</span>, then in 1790 proceeded to translate Lessing's <span class="italic">Nathan der Weise</span> and make a startling free adaptation of B&uuml;rger's &#145;Lenore&#146;. Of these works, <span class="italic">Nathan</span>, which he felt encouraged &#145;mutual indulgence between religious sects&#146;  (preface to 1805 edn), meant the most to Taylor, and he had his translation printed for distribution among his acquaintances. The other translations circulated in manuscript for several years, that of &#145;Lenore&#146; gaining considerable celebrity. In 1789&#150;90, excited by the French Revolution, Taylor experienced the feelings of ebullience common to young radicals of his generation. He helped found the Norwich Revolution Society in November 1789 and subsequently conducted the society's correspondence. In May 1790 he made an enthusiastic visit to Paris, on his return publishing a series of pro-revolutionary articles in the <span class="italic">Cambridge Chronicle</span> over the signature &#145;A Friend to Liberty&#146;. There was something innately sceptical in Taylor's thinking, however, and it is the relativity of &#145;truth&#146; which these letters finally seem to celebrate.<br>
<br>Taylor's ambiguous stance towards religious and political &#145;progress&#146; became more marked in 1791. After the Birmingham riots which destroyed the house of Joseph Priestley, he responded, rather surprisingly, with an adaptation of Samuel Butler's <span class="italic">Hudibras</span> that presented Priestley as the mystical nonconformist Ralpho. A former admirer, he now felt, apparently, that Priestley's bigoted claims for Unitarianism had harmed the dissenting interest. In the 1790s Hume, whom Priestley had attacked on more than one occasion, became, and remained, the major influence on Taylor's thinking. Religion, he increasingly felt, should be judged according to its utility, not its &#145;truth&#146;. Dialogue became Taylor's preferred mode for expressing ideas, and he appropriately embarked on a translation of several of Wieland's Lucianic <span class="italic">G&ouml;ttergespr&auml;che</span>, a genre he imitated in one of his finest original works. The success of his friend Sayers's <span class="italic">Dramatic Sketches of the Ancient Northern Mythology</span> (1790) had seemingly inspired Taylor with the idea that he too might attempt a literary career. In 1791&#150;2 he was able to use the threat to the Norwich trade posed by disturbance on the continent to persuade his father that they should give up the family business. By 1795 the Taylors' withdrawal from commerce was complete, but already, in 1793, Taylor had become a regular, salaried reviewer for the best-selling <span class="italic">Monthly Review</span>. His talents were perfectly suited to reviewing: he was exceptionally widely read, and his dialogic method engaged skilfully with a book's arguments and assumptions. Although he always took the &#145;liberal&#146; side on political and religious questions, his underlying position remained the relativity of truth. He should almost certainly be considered the outstanding British reviewer of the 1790s; Hazlitt later credited Taylor with pioneering &#145;philosophical criticism&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Spirit of the Age</span>, 1825, 308). Confirming his new status as a professional man of letters, Taylor now published his major translations: <span class="italic">Iphigenia in Tauris</span> (1793), <span class="italic">Dialogues of the Gods</span> (1795), <span class="italic">Ellenore</span> (1796), and <span class="italic">Nathan the Wise</span> (1805). In this period he was undoubtedly England's foremost Germanist.<br>
<br>Taylor was closely involved with the immensely successful <span class="italic">Monthly Magazine</span> from its foundation in 1796. It provided him with a suitable forum for articles on all manner of subjects, as well as short translations and original poems. His articles are of a peculiar originality. He often presented facts, ideas, and opinions culled from his vast reading as though they were the results of his own research: in this respect it would be easy to dismiss him as a compulsive plagiarist. But he had a talent for placing information in a fresh and provocative light, often by drawing out contradictions inherent in the material, or introducing contradictory facts from other sources. Moreover Taylor was the channel by which a great deal of knowledge of the intellectual scene on the continent, especially Germany, reached the English-speaking world. He was particularly attracted to the &#145;higher criticism&#146;, not only promoting Eichhorn's ideas, but making some bold sallies into biblical scholarship himself. His most notorious theory, published as <span class="italic">A Letter Concerning the Two First Chapters of Luke</span> (1810), argued that &#145;Zacharius [<i>sic</i>], who wrote those chapters, meant to hold himself out as the father of Jesus Christ&#146;  (Robberds, 2.281&#150;2). Many copies were destroyed by incensed readers. Another book-length work which developed out of his periodical writing was <span class="italic">English Synonyms Discriminated</span> (1813).<br>
<br>From the mid-1790s Taylor's life assumed a regular routine. He continued to live with his parents, working in the morning, exercising in the early afternoon, socializing in the evening. From this date his biography is a relatively straightforward account of involvement with various periodicals and increasing disrepute in Norwich. He left the <span class="italic">Monthly Review</span> in 1799, having quarrelled with the editor, George Edward Griffiths; he did not write for it again until 1808. Between 1802 and 1808 he reviewed prolifically for the <span class="italic">Annual Review</span>. In 1803&#150;4 he edited a whiggish Norwich paper, <span class="italic">The Iris</span>, and in the same years wrote for the <span class="italic">Critical Review</span>, which he rejoined briefly in 1809. In 1807 he started writing for <span class="italic">The Athenaeum</span>, the periodical John Aikin had established in opposition to the <span class="italic">Monthly Magazine</span>. After 1810 his writing commitments simplified, and he wrote mainly for the <span class="italic">Monthly Review</span> and <span class="italic">Monthly Magazine</span>. The total volume of Taylor's periodical writing is enormous, yet his Norwich contemporaries took less interest in his literary industry than his social habits. He became notorious for frequent drunkenness and spreading extremely unorthodox opinions among the young men he liked to surround himself with, the most famous of whom was George Borrow.<br>
<br>Most of Taylor's best writing was done in the 1790s. In the early 1800s he wrote too much to maintain such standards, and by 1807 there were pressing financial reasons for him to privilege quantity. Though rich when he retired from business, Taylor's father had made a series of risky investments, which by this date were causing Taylor considerable anxiety. A long-developing financial crisis finally descended on the Taylors in 1811, and they were forced to move to a smaller house in King Street. It was to be a decade of constant attrition, with the death of both his parents, and the onset of Taylor's own long struggle with illness. His writing steadily deteriorated, and he lost faith in his ability to produce the sort of large-scale work his friends expected from him. About 1820, however, possibly inspired by Borrow, Taylor did start working towards what eventually became the three-volume <span class="italic">Historic Survey of German Poetry</span> (1828&#150;30). This gathered together four decades' worth of translations and critical writing on German literature, but was out of date, and accordingly condemned by Carlyle in the <span class="italic">Edinburgh Review</span>. Taylor, who had already abandoned periodical writing, was past caring; his health had declined alarmingly and by 1830 he was given to &#145;sit[ting] for hours absorbed in a dull lethargic silence&#146;  (Robberds, 2.254). He clung on for another six years, died at his home on 5 March 1836, and was buried in the Octagon Chapel, Norwich.<br>
