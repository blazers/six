<span class="headword">Webb,  Francis</span>  (1735&#150;1815), <span class="occ">General Baptist minister and writer</span>, was born at Taunton on 18 September 1735, the third son of John Webb and his wife, Mary, daughter and coheir of William Sweet, also of Taunton. Educated privately at Abingdon and at Mr Foot's in Bristol, he entered the dissenting academy at Daventry under Caleb Ashworth in 1753; he finished his theological training under Thomas Amory at Taunton Academy. He became pastor of the General Baptist congregation at Honiton, and was so successful that in September 1758 he moved to the General Baptist chapel in Paul's Alley, London, as assistant to Joseph Burroughs, whom he succeeded as sole pastor in 1761.<br>
<br>On 31 March 1764, at Wareham, Dorset, Webb married Hannah (1730/31&#150;1822), daughter of William Milner of Poole. In 1766 he resigned his pulpit, publishing two volumes of his sermons (later augmented to four) in the same year. He became deputy searcher at Gravesend at &pound;500 a year, a move an admirer plausibly explained by Webb's having taken a house at a rent greater than his income  (<span class="italic">Monthly Repository</span>, 1816, 71). In 1777 he retired to Dorset to pursue a literary career. Above middle height, handsome, and an excellent conversationalist, he entered the circle around Lord Carmarthen, later fifth duke of Leeds, and formed a lifelong friendship with Sir Isaac Heard, Garter king of arms.<br>
<br>&#145;I love to go to the bottom of things&#146;, he wrote to Heard  (F. Webb to I. Heard, 10 Oct 1793, Library of Congress), &#145;&amp; write on <i>fundamental principles</i>&#146;. His steadfast radical whiggism is displayed in an anonymous pamphlet of 1772, <span class="italic">Thoughts on the constitutional power and right of the crown in the bestowal of places and pensions</span>, with an appendix containing lists of placemen and pensioners in the House of Commons and of members who had voted for the expulsion of John Wilkes, the seating of Colonel Luttrell, and the commitment of the lord mayor to the Tower. A firm supporter of the American colonists, in 1775 he republished Samuel Johnson's <span class="italic">Marmor Norfolciense</span>, with a satirical preface contrasting the early, unconcealed Jacobitism of its author with Johnson's support of the crown in the 1770s. The whig/tory overtones in the much-canvassed case of the forged Shakespeare manuscripts put forward by W. H. Ireland may have persuaded Webb to publish, under the pseudonym Philalethes, a pamphlet attesting to the authenticity of the documents in 1796. It may have been his friendship with Heard, who had apparently introduced him to Ireland, that led him to overcome his initial reluctance and support Ireland in print. His support of the French Revolution and an early sympathy with Napoleon (later revised) made him an effective negotiator when he served as secretary to Francis James Jackson in the preliminaries to the peace of Amiens of 1802; he disagreed, however, with some of his fellow diplomats, and left for home, on the pretext of ill health, before the conclusion of the peace.<br>
<br>In 1770 the General Baptists had fallen into schism, the larger New Connexion turning to evangelicalism, while the Old Connexion remained loyal to the rational religion of mid-century, moving steadily towards the Unitarian end of that spectrum, as did Webb, although he inclined more towards the Arian position on the divinity of Christ than to the fully humanitarian view of the Unitarians. He despised mystery, that &#145;reproach to human intellect&#146; on which faith too often anchored  (F. Webb to I. Heard, 28 Sept 1796, Library of Congress). The foundations of his rational beliefs are clearly set out in the second of his <span class="italic">Poems on Wisdom, on the Deity, on Genius</span> (1790), and he eloquently defended religious liberty in <span class="italic">An Epistle to the Rev. Mr. Kell, with an Ode on Fortitude</span> (1789): Robert Kell (1761&#150;1843), an Arian, was embroiled with the Trinitarian congregation at Wareham, to which he had gone a year earlier as assistant minister.<br>
<br>For a time after 1802 Webb lived in Crewkerne, where he attended the Unitarian chapel presided over by William Blake (1773&#150;1821), son and successor of the William Blake (1730&#150;1791) who had been a fellow student at Daventry; later, living near Yeovil, he joined the Unitarian congregation under Samuel Fawcett (1754&#150;1835). He became a member of the Western Unitarian Society, taking the chair at its meeting in Yeovil in 1814. Forced from his Yeovil house, a parsonage, by the Church of England clergyman, he spent his last years in Barrington, Somerset, where he died on 2 August 1815, and was buried in the parish church.<br>
<br>Delighting in the wit and ingenuity of other poets, Webb displays those qualities in some of his occasional verses, notably in a poem on his first tasting char  (F. Webb to I. Heard, 16 Feb 1800, Library of Congress), but his odes, marked by evocations of the sublime, the heightened rhetoric typical of the form, and a parade of classical learning that even his admiring obituarist found at times obscure&#151;notably in <span class="italic">Hymn to the Dryads</span> (1796) and <span class="italic">Somerset</span> (1811)&#151;reveal the limitations of his poetic gift. In Somerset, Webb had early formed a friendship with the painter Giles Hussey, whose theories of proportion and their equivalence to musical harmony found in Webb a willing convert. He published a sketch of Hussey in volume 8 (1814) of John Nichols's <span class="italic">Literary Anecdotes of the Eighteenth Century</span>, and his last publication, <span class="italic">Panharmonicon</span> (1815), restates and expands Hussey's views to incorporate Webb's explication through an all-embracing harmony of the divine intelligence manifested in creation.<br>
