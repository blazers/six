<span class="headword">Freame,  John</span>  (1665&#150;1745), <span class="occ">banker and lobbyist</span>, was probably the second son in the family of at least three children of Robert Freame, a Gloucestershire clothier. In 1681 his father was one of the &#145;first purchasers&#146; of Pennsylvania and some members of the Quaker Freame family emigrated there to escape religious persecution by the Gloucestershire magistrates.<br>
<br>The young John Freame sought refuge in London: he was apprenticed in 1683 to Job Boulton, a leading Lombard Street goldsmith. Boulton was also an influential member of the Friends' Committee on Sufferings, one of the first lobby groups in British politics. Freame completed his apprenticeship in 1690 and set up as a banker in partnership with another young Quaker, Thomas Gould. He married Gould's sister Priscilla (1673/4&#150;1727) in 1697 and they had seven children. The Freame&#150;Gould business partnership (cemented also by Gould's marriage to Freame's sister, Hannah) lasted until Thomas Gould's death in 1728; Gould's own son set up an independent bank which went bankrupt in 1730.<br>
<br>The Freame bank was one of the few seventeenth-century banks to survive well into the next century. Others among this select few (like Hoares or Coutts) evolved into West End banks for gentlemen, while Freame and Gould's business seems to have focused on the City's merchant community. They financed links not only with the English provinces but with Quaker traders in the American and Caribbean colonies and the Baltic. Among the enterprises in which they participated financially were the Enfield turnpike, Atlantic trading ventures, the Pennsylvania Land Company, the London Lead Company, and the Welsh Copper Company. The latter two Quaker-dominated companies developed the reverberatory furnace for lead smelting, which was financed by a &pound;500 loan at 6 per cent interest from Freame and Gould; the bank also owned shares in the company and dealt in its by-product, silver, for the Royal Mint.<br>
<br>Freame's career was clearly built on the religious connections forged during his apprenticeship. The Friends deposited their &#145;national stock&#146; (that is, their central funds, amounting to &pound;1100 in 1695) in his bank from an early stage, and he knew the Quaker luminaries of the day intimately. He was frequently called upon to arbitrate in Quaker business (as well as religious) matters and served as clerk to the Friends' supreme body, the yearly meeting, in 1711. The year after that he published <span class="italic">Scripture Instruction</span>, a textbook of morals much reprinted for over a century and used in the schools of the Quaker educational pioneer Joseph Lancaster. Freame was one of those Quakers who helped to entrench toleration after 1689 by diplomatically, but relentlessly, wringing from a reluctant Anglican establishment small cumulative concessions on matters such as affirmation (in place of the oaths of which they disapproved) or summary prosecution before magistrates (rather than the more vexatious church courts), thus reconciling his faith's many tender consciences to the requirements of civil society.<br>
<br>Freame's daughter Priscilla married in 1723 the Quaker merchant <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/37149/', "David Barclay (1682&#150;1769)")</script> whose son joined Freame's son, Joseph, in 1733 as a partner with a quarter share in the Lombard Street bank. The bank was a pioneer of the rediscounting of provincial bankers' bills in London and held large reserves at the Bank of England to support this position. John Freame spent more time on Quaker affairs after his son entered the bank. He also reconstructed the London Lead Company (of which he became governor), following revelations in the later 1720s of misuse of its funds by Quaker fraudsters in the South Sea Bubble affair. He died in 1745, his wife having predeceased him in 1727; his funeral at Winchmore Hill, in the burial-ground of the Quaker meeting-house near his country home, Bush Hill, north of London, was the Friends' equivalent of a Westminster Abbey interment. Apparently a man of self-effacing modesty, his quiet effectiveness had enabled him to become one of the more successful bankers, political lobbyists, and religious leaders of his generation.<br>
