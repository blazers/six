<span class="headword">Young,  Stuart</span>  (1934&#150;1986), <span class="occ">accountant and broadcasting executive</span>, was born on 23 April 1934 at home in Stamford Hill, London, the younger child and younger son of Joseph Young, who was in the flour business, and his wife, Rebecca (Betty) Sterling. The family were religious Jews and his mother made Young very conscious of his religious and charitable duties. Indeed, he met his wife on a charity committee when he was only sixteen, and he continued to be active in Jewish and other charities until his death. His brother, David, later became Baron Young of Graffham. He was educated at Woodhouse grammar school, North Finchley, Middlesex, left school at sixteen, and qualified as a chartered accountant in 1956. In that year he married Shirley, daughter of Harry Aarons, a fashion company director; there were two daughters of the marriage.<br>
<br>Young was a highly successful accountant. He set up his own practice in 1958, when he was only twenty-four. From 1960 he was the senior partner of his own firm, Hacker Young. He was hard working and decisive, with a very logical financial mind. In the early 1960s, when his practice was already well established, he began to get business from the interests of Sir Isaac Wolfson, including Great Universal Stores. He became a director of many companies, including Tesco, the food store group (from 1982), and of Caledonian Airways (from 1973).<br>
<br>In the summer of 1981 Young was appointed a governor of the BBC. From the beginning of his term he was uneasy about what he regarded as the financial laxity and the overmanning of the corporation, though he felt great admiration for its broadcasting quality. This contrast between financial concern and admiration for the broadcast product marked his work both as a governor and as chairman of the BBC. Within a few weeks the financial concern led to a confrontation, which he won. The governors had to approve a new contract to promote BBC sales in American television. Young and another governor asked to see the contract; they were told that this would not be customary and that Alasdair Milne, the managing director of BBC television, was reluctant to agree. Young told the chairman, George Howard, that he would not approve a contract that he had not read, whereupon he was shown the contract. When Howard's term came to an end in 1983 Young was appointed chairman of the BBC governors. Margaret Thatcher, as prime minister, wanted the BBC to be put under stronger financial control. By that time Alasdair Milne had succeeded Sir Ian Trethowan as director-general. Young promoted and encouraged Michael Checkland, who was eventually to succeed Milne as director-general, as the member of the board of management who was to carry out the financial reforms he considered urgently necessary.<br>
<br>Within a few weeks of his appointment as chairman Young suffered the first symptoms of the lung cancer which proved fatal to him, and his whole period as chairman was conducted under this disability, which he bore with great courage. His illness allowed him to form a personal link with Alasdair Milne, whose wife suffered from recurrent cancer; Milne had a sympathetic understanding of Young's condition. Yet Young did not feel that Milne had an adequate grasp of the business aspects of running so large a corporation and he did not find in him the partner who might have welcomed necessary reforms. If he had been in better health he might have been more ruthless in dealing with the problems that he recognized. None the less the reforms and the demanning, which were later associated with the chairmanship of Marmaduke Hussey, his successor, were started in Young's time.<br>
<br>During Young's chairmanship, which he regarded as a high honour, there were a number of BBC crises of a characteristic kind. One was the libel action which arose out of <span class="italic">Maggie's Militant Tendency</span>, a television attack, which proved to be defamatory, on some right-wing Conservative MPs; another was the dispute in late July 1985 between the board of governors and the board of management over the <span class="italic">Real Lives</span> interviews with Irish terrorists (made contrary to BBC producer guidelines); and a third was the dismissal of Richard Francis as managing director (radio) by Alasdair Milne. In all of these matters Young took a moderate position, trying to reconcile the warring parties in the interest of the BBC as a whole. His period as chairman was circumscribed by his illness; instead of being the radical reforming chairman that he, and Margaret Thatcher, had hoped he might be, he could only start to turn the tide from the extravagant BBC triumphalism of Howard and Milne toward the neo-puritanism of Hussey and John Birt, a later director-general. Young was courteous and friendly to his colleagues and staff. His balanced judgement and diplomatic approach were matched by firmness of purpose.<br>
<br>Young did much charitable work, which included aid for Israel, and he was treasurer of the Joint Israel appeal; he was also involved in local charities in north London, and in heritage appeals. He was a trustee of the National Gallery from 1980. From 1977 he was a member of the finance and investment committee of Wolfson College, Cambridge, of which he became an honorary fellow in 1983. He was 6 feet tall, good-looking, and always well dressed, and he had a calm and friendly expression. His two passions were chess and golf. Young died of lung cancer at his home in Hampstead Garden Suburb, 29 Ingram Avenue, on 29 August 1986, and was survived by his wife and daughters. A celebration of his life and work was held at Guildhall, London, on 10 December 1986.<br>
