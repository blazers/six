<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Procktor,  Patrick George</span>  (1936&#150;2003), <span class="occ">painter</span>, was born on 12 March 1936 at 15 Lower Hatch Street, Dublin, the younger son of Eric Christopher Procktor (<i>d</i>. 1940), accountant, of Desmond, Crosthwaite Park West, Kingstown, Dublin, and his wife, Barbara Winifred, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Hopkins; but he was not Irish, as his Wildean wit and exotic persona later suggested. (His parents were English, and the family returned to England when he was still young.) On his father's premature death his mother worked to assure her children a private education; none the less, lack of money forced Procktor to leave Highgate School early, when his ability at classics had marked him out for Oxford. After a fruitful period of national service, when he was assigned to learn Russian, opening the gates to a culture that rhymed with his own melancholy and romantic nature, he entered the Slade School of Fine Art in 1958. He always believed his true calling was acting but his height, 6 feet 7 inches, disqualified him. He treasured the comment of an art critic that he was &#145;a comic off the old boards&#146;. &#145;One hopes to entertain&#146;, he would drawl.<br>
<br>Procktor was a star pupil at the Slade, but while honouring its accent on sound drawing and figurative commitment he was never a slave to its measured prescriptions. The sale of a watercolour through the Redfern Gallery as a student began a career-long engagement, sustained early and late by the gallery's eventual director Maggie Thornton, his &#145;Picture-Dealer Extraordinary&#146;  (McEwen, 29). His first Redfern solo show, the product of a visit to Greece paid for by a Slade travelling scholarship, was his most successful. Bryan Robertson, foremost English curator of the mid-century, became his champion and included him in his &#145;New generation&#146; show at the Whitechapel Gallery, where Procktor proved the exception to the prevailing &#145;Pop and op&#146; art rule. Robertson noted that Procktor, for all his sociability and quest for diversion, was an &#145;unusually self-sufficient man&#146;; that his art had &#145;a keen satirical and theatrical sense as well as a concern for the reality&#151;including the tragedies&#151;of life&#146;; and that his colours had become &#145;increasingly personal, decorative and rich&#146;  (Robertson, 250). Robertson's perception held true.<br>
<br>In 1967 Richard Buckle, Britain's leading ballet historian, commissioned Procktor to decorate a pavilion at Montreal's Expo '67, in which placards of Mao and the Rolling Stones appeared; but his first watercolour exhibition at the Redfern the following year was more indicative of the lonelier road he now took. Watercolour on paper, poor sister of oil on canvas, suited his taste for travel, and over the years he made prolonged visits to China, Egypt, India, Japan, Morocco, and his favourite, Venice. It was a drift eastward, stylistically as much as geographically. He found &#145;the light in Egypt is violet, in China daffodil, in Venice opalescent&#146;  (McEwen, 9). He became a master in watercolour, every effect painted with one wispy brush; but he remained a fine and ever more daring painter in oils, and resented categorization. Denying a distinction between his landscapes and portraits, he said: &#145;Eyebrows are rather hedge-like&#146;  (ibid.). He was equally adept at flowers and still lifes.<br>
<br>In the 1960s Procktor became a close friend of James and Kirsten Bo Benson, founders of Odin's restaurant in Marylebone, where he lived. After James died in 1966 Peter Langan took over Odin's and later opened Langan's Brasserie. He commissioned artists' work for his restaurants and paid them by allowing them to eat and entertain there free of charge. The largest was Procktor's panoramic mural of Venice in the Brasserie's upstairs room. On 25 August 1973 Procktor married Kirsten (<i>d</i>. 1984). She was the daughter of Niels Bo Andersen, engineer, and at the time of their marriage was aged thirty-three. They had a son, Nicholas, a stepbrother for Edward and Juliet Benson.<br>
<br>In 1976 Procktor published a suite of aquatints and etchings illustrating <span class="italic">The Rime of the Ancient Mariner</span>, consolidating his outstanding reputation as a printmaker. In 1983 he was commissioned to design <span class="italic">Turandot</span> for the Royal Opera House and also by the Imperial War Museum to paint the British army in Belize. In 1984 his wife died and he painted a reredos for a chapel in Chichester Cathedral. In 1996 he was elected a member of the Royal Academy, which he enjoyed but whose pomposities he liked to tease. In 2003 he suffered a devastating fire in his studio. He died not long after, on 29 August 2003, at Whipps Cross University Hospital, Leytonstone, of a pulmonary embolus. He was survived by his son and his two stepchildren. His family scattered his ashes in Marylebone public gardens, pursued by an irate park keeper.<br>
<br>Patrick Procktor's fashionable artistic moment was in the 1960s, when he and his friend David Hockney were twin stars in the new firmament of young British painters. But he never rested on his laurels, perfecting his skill and extending his subject matter, with no thought of the commercial consequence. To spurn acceptance was a productive goad to his imagination. In art as in life he was &#145;agin' the government&#146;. And yet, contrary to his theatrical persona and liberated sexual mores, which placed him at the centre of the &#145;swinging London&#146; social scene, Procktor, like Hockney, was a traditionalist at heart&#151;a defender of art and craft at a time when the academic training from which he had benefited was abandoned, and even the ancient concepts of painting and sculpture were widely repudiated as redundant emblems of the <i>status quo</i>. That he lived to see a reversal of these attitudes, albeit in the lax form of bland tolerance, was to some degree the reward for his own faith and persistence through a lean time. This was especially true of Procktor, who remained a parochial figure in terms of the market, rooted in London and loyal to the Redfern Gallery in Cork Street, whereas Hockney, in Californian exile, achieved fame in the USA and therefore the world.<br>
