<span class="headword">Heylyn,  Rowland</span>  (1562&#150;1632), <span class="occ">ironmonger and church benefactor</span>, was born in Shrewsbury, the son of David Heylyn, who was of Welsh ancestry, and his wife, Alice. After attending the free school there from 1571 he went to London, where in 1576 he became an apprentice ironmonger. He was admitted to the company in 1584 and subsequently served twice as its master, in 1614 and 1625. Elected an alderman from Cripplegate in April 1624, later that year he was also elected sheriff of London. At an unknown date he married Alice (<i>d</i>. 1641), daughter of Richard Aldworth of Reading; they had no surviving children.<br>
<br>A man of deep religious convictions, Heylyn was a particularly good example of a puritan layman whose sense of vocation moved him to take an active role in the church and in society. According to John Stow he was responsible for printing the <span class="roman">Bible</span> in Welsh &#145;in a more portable bulk&#146;  (Beaven, 2.178). In 1626 he became one of the feoffees for impropriations, a group of puritan lawyers, ministers, and merchants whose goal was to buy up church livings and staff them with godly divines. Heylyn, who can be considered as one of the two most important lay members, served as treasurer and then in 1629 as president; in 1628 the feoffees met at his house. He raised funds, and in an early list of donors is listed as giving &pound;500, the largest single donation. In 1628 he obtained for the feoffees the advowson of the vicarage of St Alkmund in his native Shrewsbury, a lease of the tithes of St Mary's, and a barn at Cotton near the same town. Ironically, it was his kinsman <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13171/', "Peter Heylyn")</script> who, as chaplain to Archbishop William Laud, waged a determined and vocal attack against the group, describing them as plotters and conspirators.<br>
<br>From 1631 Heylyn served as president of the Bethlem and Bridewell hospitals. His will, dated 5 September 1629, contains many charitable benefactions. He left significant sums for the poor to the corporation of Shrewsbury and for imprisoned debtors in London, and sums for the ill and indigent, as well as a large donation for poor ministers. His books were donated to Shrewsbury Library. His generosity to the Ironmongers' Company included a gift for young men and a stipend for a yearly sermon on the date of the Gunpowder Plot.<br>
<br>Heylyn died in London in February 1632. His will was proved on 15 February by his widow, who inherited much of the residue of his estate; the remainder went to his sisters, nephews, nieces, and cousins. The feoffees did not long survive him, being suppressed by Laud in 1633.<br>
