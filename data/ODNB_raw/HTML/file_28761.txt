<span class="headword">Warner,  John</span>  (1736&#150;1800), <span class="occ">classical scholar and Church of England clergyman</span>, was born in London, the son of Ferdinando Warner (1703&#150;1768), a clergyman. After initial schooling in Greenwich, he was admitted to St Paul's School, London, on 30 March 1747. On leaving, he spent a few months in Lisbon, but his family felt him to be unsuited to the commercial life. Instead, on 2 July 1754, he was admitted as a sizar at Magdalene College, Cambridge, but moved to Trinity College on 6 November. After matriculating in the Lent term 1755, he became Pauline exhibitioner and Perry exhibitioner the same year. He graduated BA from Trinity College in 1758, and proceeded MA in 1761 and DD in 1773.<br>
<br>Warner was ordained priest in London on 21 September 1760, and on the 30th was elected lecturer of St Andrew by the Wardrobe and St Ann Blackfriars. That same month he was nominated as morning preacher of his own proprietary chapel in Long Acre (later sold to Dr King, formerly chaplain of the British factory at St Petersburg) by the vicar of St Martin-in-the-Fields, so beginning a ministry which brought him some celebrity as an eloquent preacher at London. He looked to his father's connections with the old corps whigs for patronage. On 20 December 1763 he was licensed to perform the office of assistant preacher and reader at Tavistock Chapel in the parish of St Martin-in-the-Fields (leased from the Bedford estates) and on 30 November 1765 he was licensed as a general preacher throughout the London diocese. He also gained his first living, the vicarage of West Ham, Essex, which he held for ten years until resignation in March 1775, when he was admitted to the rectory of North Benfleet, Essex. West Ham was a crown living bestowed by the duke of Newcastle (newly returned to office) as a means of silencing Ferdinando Warner's complaints of official neglect.<br>
<br>John Warner also advanced his career outside the capital. In 1777 he was presented to the rectory of Scrivelsby-cum-Dalderby, Lincolnshire. Having been instituted on 4 August, he promptly resigned the living within two months, and was appointed instead to the united rectories of Hockcliffe and Chalgrave in Bedfordshire on 19 December 1777, suddenly vacant after the execution of the previous incumbent, the unfortunate Dr William Dodd, for forgery. The precise reasons for ceding the Lincolnshire parishes so quickly are unclear. Hockcliffe, at &pound;200 p.a., was slightly more profitable than Scrivelsby, valued at &pound;160 p.a. in 1777. It may be that Warner was attracted by the greater proximity to his metropolitan friends. Whatever the explanation, he was largely non-resident and continued to hunt for more comfortable preferment. It was his ambition, he told George Selwyn, &#145;to be a tight Trulliber, to feed pigs, and grow fat with them&#146;  (Jesse, 4.343). His search for the right living finally ended in 1790, when he resigned Hockcliffe and was presented by his friend Sir Richard Colt Hoare to the rectory of Stourton, Wiltshire (instituted 8 October), which he held until his death. In June 1790, on the recommendation of Frederick, fifth earl of Carlisle, and George Selwyn, Warner served as chaplain to the new British ambassador in Paris, Earl Gower. Warner knew the city well. His sister, a Roman Catholic convert, had become a nun there, while Warner himself had lived there previously in the winter of 1778&#150;9, staying with the Abb&eacute; Raynal, a sure token of his progressive sympathies.<br>
<br>Once in France, Warner exhibited an enthusiasm for the revolution deemed excessive for an Anglican clergyman, and he stayed in France for the next three years beyond the closure of the embassy. With other radical whigs (including fellow cleric Horne Tooke) Warner's name was put forward in the Convention in September 1792 for citizenship as one &#145;known for his energetic speeches, in which he deploys his love of liberty and hatred for kings&#146;, as one French newspaper reported, with embarrassing exaggeration  (Erdman, 188). There is no evidence to suggest it was granted. In October 1793 the Convention decreed the arrest of all British subjects. The decree came into force just as Warner had reached Boulogne, and he was obliged by the authorities to live outside the town until some time after the overthrow of Robespierre in July 1794. He remained sympathetic to the ideals of the revolution, despite the excesses of the terror, opining that he did not &#145;think it an advantage to this country [Britain], that Bourbon politics should grow in fashion, and that, because the French run mad, the sound principles of English liberty should be trodden under foot&#146;  (<span class="italic">Monthly Magazine</span>, 171).<br>
<br>Warner was a committed whig, an advocate of parliamentary reform, and a friend of his fellow radical parson Horne Tooke; he subscribed to the <span class="italic">Diversions of Purley</span> and left Tooke a silver goblet in his will. Warner was an excellent scholar with a reputation for wit that made him, in later life, a close friend of George Selwyn (by whom he was nicknamed The Snail) and a member of the circle of the fourth duke of Queensberry (whom he attended to both Drumlanrigg and Amesbury). As one obituarist recorded: &#145;His attachment to literature was unbounded; he was moderate to an extreme at the table, and equally abstemious at the bottle: a book, a pipe, and cheerful conversation, in which he eminently excelled, were his supreme delight&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 70/1, 1800, 92). His humanitarian concerns were well known. He personally relieved distress among his parishioners in the 1790s and was an ardent admirer of his Bedfordshire neighbour the philanthropist John Howard: Warner was a moving spirit in the erection of the statue to Howard's memory in St Paul's Cathedral.<br>
<br>Warner died in St John's Square, Clerkenwell, on 22 January 1800, and was buried in a vault in St John's Church on the 30th. His genial, sociable temperament limited his literary productivity. He published anonymously, <span class="italic">Metronariston, or, A new pleasure recommended, in a dissertation upon a part of Greek and Latin prosody</span> (1797) and a memoir of Major Cartwright in <span class="italic">Public Characters</span> (1798). He never married.<br>
