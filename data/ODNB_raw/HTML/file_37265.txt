<span class="headword">Cary,  John</span>  (1755&#150;1835), <span class="occ">cartographer</span>, was born on 23 February 1755 in Corsley, Wiltshire, the second of the four sons and one of possibly five or more children of George Cary, maltster, and his wife, Mary (<i>d</i>. 1799). In 1770 he entered a seven-year engraving apprenticeship under William Palmer of New Street, London.<br>
<br>Cary set himself up in business as an engraver before 1782 at Johnson's Court, Fleet Street, London. By about 1783 he was at 188 Strand and about 1791 moved to 181 Strand, which he occupied until January 1820 when fire destroyed his workshop and his brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/4845/', "William Cary")</script>'s adjacent premises, bringing forward a planned move to 86 St James's Street. The Cary business continued to operate here until after John's death. Although he generally worked independently, Cary did collaborate, notably with John Wallis, who seems to have inspired his diversification into publishing about 1783 or 1784, with his brother William in globe production and his brother Francis (<i>c</i>.1756&#150;1836) in engraving, and, most significantly, with the geologist William Smith and others in the development and publication of geological maps, including Smith's great map of 1815 and a county series, begun in 1819 but not completed.<br>
<br>Cary's first known engraved plan is dated 1779. Henceforth, the quality of his engraving established new standards and a new style, with his effective, starkly beautiful, plain design being widely adopted. His firm's cartographic output was prolific and diverse, ranging through maps, plans, atlases, astronomical and educational works, road-books (including works based on surveys by Aaron Arrowsmith the elder, who probably trained him), guides, and globes. Particularly noteworthy are the immensely popular <span class="italic">New and Correct English Atlas</span> (editions from 1787), which became the standard county atlas of the period, and the <span class="italic">Traveller's Companion</span> (from 1790), the printing plates of both of which had to be replaced having become worn in the effort to meet the huge demand, and the particularly fine <span class="italic">New English Atlas</span> (from 1801) and <span class="italic">New Universal Atlas</span> (from 1808).<br>
<br>Despite the high quality of his maps, Cary's only public recognition was the award of the Society of Arts gold medal (1804) for publishing Singer's Cardiganshire survey (1803). Cary's appointment as surveyor of the roads to the General Post Office (1794) led to his publication of authoritative road measurements (measured by perambulator) in his influential <span class="italic">New Itinerary</span> (numerous editions from 1798).<br>
<br>Cary probably married Ann Jackson (<i>c</i>.1752&#150;1824) of Clerkenwell on 21 June 1779. They had three sons and one daughter. The Elizabeth Jackson of Clerkenwell who later married his brother William may have been his sister-in-law. In 1820 he was joined in business by his eldest son, George, who served his engraving apprenticeship under his father from 1802 and took over the business about 1821 in partnership with his brother John, although their father probably remained a partner until his death. The newly styled firm of G. and J. Cary continued at 86 St James's Street until 1850, although map production apparently ceased about 1846. It carried on William Cary's scientific instrument and terrestrial and celestial globe making business after his death (1825) until about 1853. The firm's cartographic materials were subsequently acquired by <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/46712/', "George Frederick Cruchley")</script> and later Gall and Inglis, with both publishing adaptations of original stock and plates.<br>
<br>Cary died in Mortlake, Surrey, on 16 August 1835 and was buried in Kensington, London, on 22 August. He and the firm he created dominated British map production for a generation at least, being the most influential private-sector map maker of the age. His contemporary reputation is confirmed by the extended life of much of his output and by the widespread plagiarism of his productions.<br>
