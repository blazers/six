<span class="headword">Hill,  George</span>  (<em>c.</em>1716&#150;1808), <span class="occ">lawyer and eccentric</span>, was born at Waddington, Lincolnshire, the eldest son of Nathaniel Hill MA (<i>d</i>. 1732), rector of Waddington and lord of the manor of Rothwell, Northamptonshire. As well as his father, his brother and two uncles were clergymen. Hill's father died in 1732, and George broke with family tradition by pursuing a career in the law.<br>
<br>Hill matriculated at Clare College, Cambridge, in 1733 and was admitted to the Middle Temple in 1734 and called to the bar in 1741. His practice seems to have been mainly &#145;chamber practice&#146; of conveyancing and advice. On 6 November 1772, after thirty years of obscurity, Hill was created serjeant and king's serjeant. The explanation is possibly that Henry Bathurst, as the first tory chancellor since 1714, had difficulty in finding tory lawyers sufficiently senior for preferment. Hill held a reactionary view of recent legal development: he is quoted as saying that &#145;the greatest service that could be rendered the country would be to repeal all the statutes, and burn all the reports which were of later date than the Revolution&#146;  (Romilly, 72). On creation as serjeant he immediately gained an extensive practice in common pleas, as can be seen from the law reports of the period. In king's bench, however, he repeatedly clashed with the chief justice, Lord Mansfield.<br>
<br>Mansfield used Hill's deafness and rather ponderous advocacy to make him the butt of jokes in court, and satirized his fondness for extensive reliance on old cases in preference to general principles, so that Hill acquired the nickname of Serjeant Labyrinth. However, after Mansfield's death, as the pendulum of legal patronage and culture swung towards the tories, Hill was transmuted from an &#145;old fool&#146;&#151;his own account, to the young Eldon, of most young lawyers' view of him  (Twiss, 93)&#151;to a respected, if eccentric, elder statesman of the bar. Nineteenth-century legal memoirs preserve numerous anecdotes about Hill's eccentricity&#151;reflecting both views; an unfriendly story tells of his accidentally producing a candlestick in court when he meant to produce a law report; a friendlier one of his ordering his servants to kill a fox which had been chased into his garden, and responding to the outraged hunt by producing a medieval case report which justified his action.<br>
<br>Hill married, some time before 1761, Anna Barbara, daughter and heir of Thomas Medlycote of Cottingham, Northamptonshire, and they had two daughters. One anecdote tells of his becoming so absorbed in business that he had to be called to church to attend his wedding. Any expectations which Hill might have had of the marriage were disappointed on Thomas Medlycote's death, when he was found to have left all his property on trusts which gave his daughter only a separate property for life, and that provided that she returned to using her maiden name. On his wife's death (some time between 1793 and 1799) Hill said to Eldon (then attorney-general), &#145;I have lost poor dear Mrs Hill&#146;, and then, after a pause, &#145;I don't know, though, that the loss <i>was</i> so great; for she had all her property, Mr. Attorney, to her separate use&#146;  (Twiss, 301). Hill died at his house in Bedford Square, London, on 21 February 1808, and was buried in the family vault at Rothwell, where there is an epitaph upon him by Bennett, bishop of Cloyne. An important collection of legal manuscripts was purchased from his executors by the Society of Lincoln's Inn, and is in the library there.<br>
<br>Mansfield's attempt to make Hill a laughing stock was transmitted by Campbell's <span class="italic">Lives of the Chief Justices</span> and has been followed by some modern authors. Hill, however, had the last laugh: for most of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries orthodox views of what made a &#145;sound lawyer&#146; were closer to Hill's than to Mansfield's.<br>
