<span class="headword">Philips,  Nathaniel George</span>  (1795&#150;1831), <span class="occ">artist</span>, was born on 9 June 1795 in Mayfield, Manchester, the youngest of the five children of John Leigh Philips (1761&#150;1814) and his wife, Caroline Renny (1770&#150;1834). His father gained great popularity as lieutenant-colonel commandant of the Manchester and Salford Volunteers and is said to have had &#145;a talent for rendering discipline engaging and authority amiable&#146;  (Philips). He was well known as a philanthropist, but he also formed a remarkable collection of books, pictures, and other works of art which, on his death in 1814, were dispersed at a sale that extended over nineteen days. Philips was educated at Manchester grammar school and afterwards entered the University of Edinburgh, with the intention of qualifying for the medical profession. While pursuing his medical studies he made the acquaintance, among many brilliant men then resident in Edinburgh, of Sir William Allan, who included his portrait in the principal group of his picture <span class="italic">The Circassian Slaves</span>, and other distinguished artists of the Scottish school. By their advice he ultimately adopted art as a profession. In Edinburgh he had also gained the friendship of the learned Roman Catholic Bishop Cameron, which secured for him, on his visit to Italy, an introduction to artistic circles in various towns that he visited.<br>
<br>To prepare for his new profession, in 1824 Philips went to Italy, where he stayed for three years. So greatly was his talent appreciated in Rome that, on the death of Fuseli, he was, in 1825, elected to fill his place as a member of the Academy of St Luke. During his time in Italy he travelled widely, and it was said that during one trip into the remote countryside with a fellow artist, when they were captured by bandits, that they were able to escape by giving their captors examples of their work.<br>
<br>On his return to England Philips settled in Liverpool, where he worked industriously. He exhibited landscapes at the Liverpool Academy and the Royal Manchester Institution and between 1819 and 1829 three paintings at the Royal Academy in London, including <span class="italic">View Near Naples, on the Road to Salerno</span> in 1828 and <span class="italic">Aqueduct on the road between Caestella Mora and Amalfi: a party of pleasure surprised by brigands</span> in 1829. The work by which he is best remembered is a series of twenty-eight engravings on copper, many of them beautifully executed by himself from his own drawings, of old halls in Lancashire and Cheshire, including Dinkerley Hall and Thurland Castle. These were first published as <span class="italic">Views in Lancashire and Cheshire of old halls and castles, intended as illustrations to the county histories</span> (1822&#150;4), and there is some doubt if more than twenty-five were then printed. All were reissued in book form in 1893, &#145;with descriptive letterpress by twenty-four local contributors&#146;, a memoir of the artist by W. Morton Philips, and &#145;a pedigree of Philips of Heath House &hellip; county Stafford&#146;.<br>
<br>Philips also produced some etchings, and three portrait paintings by him are known, one of which depicts the lawyer and poet W. Baltine (1803, at Uppark, Hampshire). All his work is marked by close attention to detail. Philips died relatively young, unmarried, and after several years of illness, at his residence in Rodney Street, Liverpool, on 1 August 1831. He was said to have been &#145;an amateur artist of great taste and skill&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 101/2, 1831, 651). According to his will he was able to leave substantial annuities to his mother and to a family friend, Catherina Bansfield. The sale catalogue of his collections of paintings and books reveals him as having acquired several old masters, notably <span class="italic">Head of a Poetess</span> by Domenichino and <span class="italic">The Emblem of St Luke</span> by Correggio. His collection included various costumes, among them a Roman tunic and a female brigand's dress, and examples of the work of himself and his contemporaries.<br>
