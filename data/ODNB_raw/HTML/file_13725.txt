<span class="headword">Hope,  James</span>  (1764&#150;1847), <span class="occ">United Irishman</span>, son of a fugitive highland covenanter who had settled in the north of Ireland as a linen weaver, was born in the parish of Templepatrick, co. Antrim, on 25 August 1764. With only fifteen weeks of formal schooling, he was apprenticed to linen weaving at the age of ten. In due time he became a journeyman weaver. The commercial distress prevalent in the north of Ireland, as a result of the American War of Independence, convinced Hope that the fundamental question of the time was social rather than political, and only to be solved by restoring to the people &#145;their natural right of deriving a subsistence from the soil on which their labour was expended&#146;. But it was the religious feuds between the Peep-o'-Day Boys and the Defenders, nowhere more bitter than in his own neighbourhood, that first seriously attracted his attention to politics. He threw himself with enthusiasm into the movement for a union between the Roman Catholics and Presbyterians, aimed at an extension of civil and religious freedom among all classes of the community, and he became a member of the Roughford volunteer corps, and at a later period a member of the Mallusk Society of United Irishmen. On the reconstruction of the United Irish Society in 1795, he consented, though reluctantly, to take the oath of secrecy and fidelity, and was appointed a delegate to the upper baronial committee of Belfast.<br>
<br>Firmly in the confidence of United Irish leaders such as Henry Joy McCracken and Thomas Russell, Hope's chief role in the society was as a messenger and organizer, extending the movement outside Ulster. In the spring of 1796 he was sent to Dublin to spread the principles of the society among the workers of the capital. For a time he lived at Balbriggan, working as a silk weaver; but his motives were suspected by the Orangemen in the factory, and he moved to Dublin, to work in the liberties as a cotton weaver. Here he managed to found a branch society, but when he was suspected of being a castle spy, he narrowly escaped assassination, and returned to Belfast. On the outbreak of the rebellion in Ulster in 1798 he remained true to his principles, and took part in the battle of Antrim (7 June). After lurking about in the neighbourhood of Ballymena and Belfast for four months, he made his way undetected to Dublin in November 1798. Here he was joined in the following summer by his family; but for four years he lived in continual expectation of being arrested. While in Dublin he became acquainted with Robert Emmet in 1803, and assisted him in his plot, but he took no part in the insurrection, being at the time engaged with Russell in organizing a rising in co. Down. After the failure of Emmet's rebellion he avoided arrest, and on the political amnesty that followed the death of Pitt and the accession to office of Fox and Grenville in 1806, he returned to Belfast, and resumed his work as a linen weaver. For a time he was employed by Mary Ann McCracken, the sister of Henry Joy McCracken, and later as a clerk for Joseph Smyth, publisher of the <span class="italic">Belfast Almanac</span>. In 1843 he wrote his memoirs at the request of R. R. Madden.<br>
<br>Hope was of medium height, slightly but firmly built, and of a modest and retiring disposition, known among his comrades as the Spartan. He married the daughter of his first employer, Rose Mullen, who died in 1831, after bearing four children. He died in Belfast in 1847 and was buried at Mallusk, co. Down.<br>
<br>Hope's &#145;Memoirs&#146;, printed in Madden's <span class="italic">United Irishmen</span>, provide a rare testament to the social radicalism and expectations of lower-class supporters of the United Irish movement. A persistent theme is the betrayal of the rank-and-file members by timid but opportunistic middle-class leaders. His firsthand account of the battle of Antrim appears in Madden's chapter on Henry Joy McCracken.<br>
