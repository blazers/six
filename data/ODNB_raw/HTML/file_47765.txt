<span class="headword">Aylward,  Margaret Louisa</span>  (1810&#150;1889), <span class="occ">philanthropist and Roman Catholic nun</span>, was born on 23 November 1810 in Thomas Street, Waterford, the fifth child of William Aylward (<i>d</i>. 1840), merchant, and his wife, Ellen Mullowney, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Murphy (<i>c</i>.1781&#150;<i>c</i>.1860). There were ten children born of the marriage, and a half-brother, from Ellen Murphy's first marriage, also lived with the family. The family's wealth was based on the provisions trade.<br>
<br>Aylward was educated at a local Quaker school and at the age of ten was sent as a boarder to the Ursuline convent in Thurles, co. Tipperary. She became fluent in French and a talented artist. When she returned to Waterford in 1830 she became involved in various charities around the city. Her sister Catherine joined the religious congregation, the Sisters of Charity, in Dublin in 1834 and Aylward followed her into that congregation. There she came under the influence of Eliza Bodenham, the mistress of novices, who in 1839 was dismissed from the congregation, an action that caused havoc in the community. Many of the novices subsequently left the community, believing that Bodenham had been harshly treated. Aylward was among those who left, and between 1839 and 1842 she continued to correspond with Bodenham, who had plans to begin a school for young ladies.<br>
<br>By 1845 Aylward was again considering joining a religious community and by the end of that year had become a novice in the Ursuline convent in Waterford. By January 1846, however, she had left the order. She moved to Dublin in 1848 and became involved in extensive philanthropic work: she worked with the lay charity the Ladies' Association for the Spiritual and Temporal Relief of the Sick Poor, known as the Ladies' Association. She organized a branch of this society in Marlborough Street in Dublin in 1851. The aim of the association was to relieve distress among the poor but also to catechize. Within five years it had 148 lady visitors and several branches around the city, and had formed St Mary's Industrial Institute, which attempted to find needlework for poor women.<br>
<br>Aylward worked closely with the Catholic clergy and was instrumental in bringing the French Daughters of Charity of St Vincent de Paul to Dublin in 1858 after eight years of negotiation. The visitations undertaken by Aylward and her co-workers in the Ladies' Association had alerted them to the extent of protestant missionary work among the poor in Dublin. She was particularly concerned with the work of the Irish Church Missions, which was an openly proselytizing organization and targeted the children of the very poor by educating and feeding them. Aylward and members of the Ladies' Association often stood outside the schools run by the Irish Church Missions and took down the names of the children attending. This led to acrimonious exchanges between the Ladies' Association and the agents of the Irish Church Missions. In order to counteract protestant proselytism Aylward founded an orphanage, St Brigid's, in 1856, which boarded out children to Catholic families. Aylward oversaw the running of the orphanage in all its details. In 1860 she failed to deliver up a child who had passed through the orphanage after the child's mother insisted on raising her daughter as a protestant, and, having claimed not to know of the child or her whereabouts, was imprisoned for six months on a contempt of court charge. The case was widely reported in the press of the period, and led to the disbandment of the Daughters of St Brigid, a group of six lay women, who formed the core of the Ladies' Association and the committee of the orphanage. Aylward's health was seriously affected by her imprisonment, but undaunted she established her first school in Dublin within five months of her release. With a reluctance perhaps born of her own failure to persevere in noviciates, she formed the religious congregation the Sisters of the Holy Faith, which was canonically approved in 1867. Organizing a religious congregation made her work appear respectable and allowed for permanency, particularly after her prison experience. The name of the new congregation echoed its mission against protestant proselytism. Aylward (who took the name Agatha on the founding of the congregation) remained independent in her actions; she did not, for example, wear a religious habit, and had numerous disagreements with clerics.<br>
<br>Aylward suffered much ill health in her later years. For the last two years of her life she was bedridden as a consequence of varicose ulcers. She was also affected by erysipelas for a great number of years. She died on 11 October 1889 and was buried in the convent cemetery at Glasnevin, Dublin.<br>
