<span class="headword">Landel,  William</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1385), <span class="occ">bishop of St Andrews and diplomat</span>, was probably a younger son of a baronial family originally established in Berwickshire. On the death of his brother John, William acquired the baronies of Hownam and Crailing in Roxburghshire, but surrendered these in 1367 to John Crichton. By then Landel's ecclesiastical and political career was well established, but his early years remain shrouded in obscurity. He may have studied in France in the 1330s, but he was only occasionally styled master thereafter, and it remains uncertain whether he graduated. A lengthy sojourn in France, whether as a student or perhaps in the entourage of the exiled King David II, would, however, explain why nothing is known of Landel's pre-episcopal career&#151;other than that he was rector of Kinkell, Aberdeenshire, immediately before his elevation. Residence in France would similarly account for the support which both King Philippe VI of France and David II extended to Landel's episcopal appointment in a supplication to Pope Benedict XII (<i>r</i>. 1334&#150;42).<br>
<br>Benedict appointed Landel as bishop of St Andrews on 18 February 1342; he was consecrated at Avignon on 17 March. Instructed by the pope the following day to return to his diocese, Landel was back in Scotland by the end of that year. He remained a close associate of David II, who had returned from exile in France the previous year. From 1357, after the king's release from English captivity, Landel frequently witnessed royal charters and presumably spent much of his time with the royal court, not just during its visits to the principal centres of government at Edinburgh, Perth, and Scone, but also on its occasional journeys to the west and the north-east of the kingdom. Thus he was with the king when David visited the north-east during the winter of 1362&#150;3 in order to escape an outbreak of plague further south. Although holding no official governmental position, Landel was often entrusted with diplomatic business. Between 1348 and 1370 he was nominated to serve on almost every Scottish embassy to England, including that which conducted the negotiations leading to the treaty of Berwick and David II's subsequent release in 1357. Spiritual activities further prolonged Landel's probably lengthy absences from his diocesan seat. He received safe conducts to undertake pilgrimages to Santiago de Compostela in 1361 and Canterbury in 1362, and to visit the papal court in 1363, and an unspecified destination overseas in 1365.<br>
<br>Although he crowned Robert II during the inauguration ceremony at Scone on 16 March 1371, Landel's political prominence declined after the accession of the new king, doubtless mainly due to the effects of advancing years. Although he continued to witness royal charters regularly in the early years of the new reign, his diplomatic role diminished and he probably began to spend more time in St Andrews, where he supervised the beginning of reconstruction work on his cathedral after its destruction by fire in 1378. Although by 1381 Landel was reported to be feeble and broken with age, from at least 1383 until his death he was entrusted with the custody of the king's illegitimate son, James. Landel bequeathed jewels, vestments, books, and &#145;other more pleasing playthings&#146;  (Wyntoun, 3.27) to his cathedral church. He was one of the first Scottish bishops able to dispose of his personal property by testament, having been instrumental in persuading the crown to grant this concession to the episcopate. Landel died on 23 September 1385 and was buried in his cathedral church.<br>
