<span class="headword">Looten,  Jan</span>  (<em>c.</em>1618&#150;<em>c.</em>1680), <span class="occ">landscape painter</span>, was born in Amsterdam. He appears in a group portrait of a company of militia dated 1642, and was married in Amsterdam in September 1643, when he was about twenty-five years old. He moved to London early in the reign of Charles II. The Ogdens, writing about the English taste in landscape in the seventeenth century, rate him the &#145;most important landscape painter of the Northern tradition active in England&#146; during the 1660s, and one of the few to use &#145;English scenery consciously in composing their ideal landscapes&#146;  (Ogden and Ogden, 116). He painted landscapes &#145;of a sublime or romantic description&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>), with dark woods and waterfalls, in the style of Roelant Roghman, Allart van Everdingen, Jacob van Ruisdael, or Meindert Hobbema. Looten also painted some views of the Alps in Switzerland, where he is said to have lived for several years. He generally used larger than average canvases, and the figures in his paintings were often the work of Jan Lingelbach. Jan Griffier was his pupil and, according to George Vertue, &#145;became a more pleasant Painter than his Master&#146;  (Vertue, <span class="italic">Note books</span>, 1.50). In 1669 Looten was living in St James's Market, where he was visited on 11 April by Samuel Pepys, who &#145;there saw no good pictures&#146; but was introduced to another painter, Simon Verelst  (<span class="italic">Diary</span>, 514). Vertue states he &#145;died poor in Yorkshire&#146;  (Vertue, <span class="italic">Note books</span>, 1.77). That he was in Yorkshire and in straitened circumstances is suggested by a letter of 1678 from William Lodge in London to Henry Gyles in York saying &#145;as for those things of Mr Loton they are out of my way &hellip; tell honest Cowell as a secret that I would not have him putt so much confidence in his Landskip painter, by what I have heard of him here being in debt to severall he delt withall and so left em&#146;  (Hake, 64). He died in London or York about 1680. Administration of the effects of Johanes Looton was granted to one of his creditors in London in February 1691.<br>
<br>Four landscapes attributed to Looten are in the Royal Collection; of the three originally in the collection of James II, <span class="italic">Landscape with an Estuary</span> and <span class="italic">A Wooded Landscape</span> were probably painted for him about 1675. Looten landscapes in national collections include those at Cheltenham Art Gallery, falsely signed and dated &#145;Hobbema pinx 1686&#146;; Temple Newsam House, Leeds; and Beecroft Art Gallery, Southend-on-Sea. The <span class="italic">River Landscape</span> in the National Gallery, thought to be by Looten, is now attributed to Joris van der Haagen. There are also earlier landscapes in Amsterdam (figures by Lingelbach), Nancy (1655), Copenhagen (two, 1656; figures by Lingelbach), Rotterdam (1658), Hamburg, Berlin (two), and elsewhere. Numerous Looten landscapes have passed through the auction houses over the years.<br>
