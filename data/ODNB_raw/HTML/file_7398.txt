<span class="headword">Dease,  William</span>  (<em>c.</em>1752&#150;1798), <span class="occ">surgeon</span>, was born at Lisney, co. Cavan, Ireland. He was sent to Dr Clancy's school in Dublin, and afterwards studied medicine in that city and in Paris. He set up in practice in Dublin, and quickly gained repute as a surgeon, holding good hospital appointments. He took an active part in procuring a charter of incorporation for the Dublin surgeons, and became the first professor of surgery in the new college in 1785, and its president in 1789. He had a good practice, and was much esteemed for his virtues. He married Eliza, daughter of Sir Richard Dowdall. Dease wrote <span class="italic">Observations on Wounds of the Head</span> (1776; much enlarged, 1778), <span class="italic">Different Methods of Treating the Venereal Diseases</span> (1779), <span class="italic">Radical Cure of Hydrocele, and on Cutting for the Stone</span> (1782), and <span class="italic">Observations on Midwifery</span> (1783).<br>
<br>Dease's death in Sackville Street, Dublin, on 21 January 1798, occurred under circumstances which no coroner's inquest would seem to have cleared up. According to one account he had made the mistake of opening an aneurysm in a patient with a fatal result, taking it for an abscess, and was so appalled by his error that he went to his study and opened his own femoral artery; according to another account, he died from an accidental wound of the femoral artery; and by a third account, from the rupture of an aneurysm. In 1812 the Irish College of Surgeons acquired his bust and placed it in the inner hall; in 1886 a statue of him, presented by his grandson, was placed in the principal hall of the college.<br>
