<span class="headword">Dow,  Alexander</span>  (1735/6&#150;1779), <span class="occ">army officer in the East India Company and author</span>, was born in Perthshire, Scotland. Alexander Dow's father was &#145;of the customs at Dunbar&#146; and Alexander himself was said to be apprenticed at Eyemouth to be educated for a mercantile career. In 1757, however, he joined the <i>King of Prussia</i>, a private ship of war, as a midshipman. One explanation given for this sudden career change was that he was forced to leave Scotland because of a fatal duel. In the course of the following three years he somehow made his way to Bengal, some say via Bencoolen, in Sumatra, where he entered the East India Company's military service as a cadet in 1760. Later that same year he was raised to the rank of ensign. In 1763 he became lieutenant and a year later he raised the 19th battalion of sepoys at Murshidabad. Appointed captain in April 1764, he took part in the assault on the Chunar Fort on 2 December that same year, during which he sustained a skull fracture. In 1766 he participated in the officers' association to protest against Clive's measure to abolish the double field allowance. Probably in consequence of his involvement in this affair, Dow found himself in Britain in 1768.<br>
<br>In that year Dow published <span class="italic">Tales Translated from the Persian of Inatulla of Delhi</span> and the first two volumes of the <span class="italic">History of Hindostan</span>. The latter work is a translation of the Persian text by Muhammad Kasim Ferishta, to which Dow added a dissertation on the religion and philosophy of the Brahmans and an appendix containing the last forty years of the history of the Mughal empire. His dissertation on Hindu religion and philosophy did not add much to existing knowledge of Hinduism but reached a wide audience and was extensively reviewed and discussed in Britain. It was therefore of some influence in shaping British views on India and on the religion and philosophy of its people until real advances in knowledge were made by William Jones and his fellow orientalists during the last two decades of the eighteenth century. Dow's treatise also influenced the views of Voltaire, and a French translation of his work appeared in 1769. In London Dow shared his lodgings with James Macpherson, another Scot with literary tastes, who would make a name for himself as the perpetrator of the Ossian hoax. In 1769 Dow published <span class="italic">Zingis</span>, a tragedy in five acts, which played with some success at Drury Lane. His qualities as a Persian scholar were called into question by John Shore, who supposed that he had had his Persian interpreter read and explain the stories of Inatulla to him, after which he had freely rewritten the substance of them in English. Shore considered Dow's translation of Ferishta's work, however, to be more correct, and in some places even exact in its translation. In his memoirs John Macdonald, in those days Dow's personal servant, wrote that his master spent so much money on women that he was tired of waiting on them. But Macdonald also recognized that Dow was a generous employer and when the latter set out for Bombay in April 1769, the footman agreed to accompany him.<br>
<br>During the voyage Dow worked on the third volume of his <span class="italic">History of Hindostan</span>. From Macdonald we learn that Dow spoke to inland princes in their own language and felt much at ease in their company as he &#145;knew their ways&#146;. From this we may conclude that Dow's acquaintance with the Persian language went beyond his having a capable interpreter. Once arrived in India, his servant said that as his &#145;master made his fortune in Bengal and was a single man, he did not mind money&#146; and &#145;kept the best house in Bombay&#146;  (<span class="italic">John Macdonald: Memoirs</span>, 117). But Bombay did not agree with Dow, and when, early in 1771, Eyre Coote passed through the settlement on his way overland to Britain, Dow asked Lieutenant-Governor Hodges for leave to accompany him. During the voyage they met with various &#145;fatiguing, dangerous and disagreeable accidents of detention&#146;  (Dow to Philip Francis, 8 Nov 1777, BL OIOC, MS Eur. F/5, fols. 329&#150;31) which seem to have called forth Coote's notoriously quick temper.<br>
<br>Back in Britain in 1772 Dow considerably added to the public clamour raised against the East India Company in that year by publishing the third volume of his <span class="italic">History of Hindostan</span>, to which he prefixed two essays: &#145;A dissertation on the origin and nature of despotism in Hindostan&#146;, and &#145;An enquiry into the state of Bengal, with a plan for restoring that Kingdom to its former prosperity and splendour&#146;. The essays, like the writings published earlier that year by William Bolts, were openly critical of Clive, but Dow, unlike Bolts, expressed himself more charitably about Clive's successor, Harry Verelst, whom he qualified as a man of &#145;probity and honour&#146;. But even his friendship for Verelst did not prevent Dow from criticizing him for failing to implement many obviously necessary regulations. Dow's ideas on improvement centred around the introduction of paper money to relieve Bengal commerce from the stranglehold caused by a lack of specie, the introduction of property rights in Bengal, the establishment of a board of revenue, and the introduction of a proper judicial system under a supreme court with jurisdiction over all of the Bengal territory. Dow's plan for property rights in Bengal was an early expression of the ideal of the permanent settlement. He expected that the enhanced security such a measure would provide would induce the new owners to improve the cultivation of their lands while at the same time strengthening their loyalty to the British. However, he saw the introduction of property rights not as an aim in itself but as a measure that would revive commerce by an increased agricultural output. His ideas were essentially mercantilist. In 1774, while Dow himself was in India, his new verse tragedy was published in London under the title <span class="italic">Sethona</span>. It was staged by Garrick at Drury Lane but was acted only for nine nights.<br>
<br>In March 1772 the directors, having already cleaned the slates of many other officers involved in the officers' association of 1766, decided to restore Dow to the rank he would have held in Bengal had he never participated in that transaction. Dow now ranked as a lieutenant-colonel but was to receive the pay of a captain until a lieutenant-colonelcy became available in Bengal. A year later he took his passage on the <i>Stormont</i> via Madras. In 1775 he was appointed commissary-general, an administrative post taking care of the military stores of all the factories and stations of the company's Bengal establishment. While executing his function diligently and to his employers' satisfaction, he grew impatient about being kept occupied &#145;in the detail of Brigade duty on the scanty pittance of 240 Rupees per month&#146;, obliging him &#145;to expend the greater part of a small independent fortune&#146; he possessed  (Dow to Francis, 11 Oct 1777, BL OIOC, MS Eur. F/5). Finally, he was rewarded for his services by an appointment as commander of the fort at Chunar for the limited duration of two years. But after one year he received notice that Lieutenant-Colonel Upton was appointed to succeed him. By such setbacks Dow was driven into the camp of Philip Francis, the opponent of Warren Hastings, hoping to receive more favourable treatment should Francis succeed Hastings as governor-general. Dow was now stationed at Barrackpore and, after notice of the war with France was received in Bengal, Hastings, despite Dow's allegiance to his great opponent, entrusted him with the task of investing the French settlement at Chandernagore. Dow executed this order at daybreak on 10 July 1778.<br>
<br>Towards the end of that year Dow felt his constitution deteriorating. He left Calcutta to try to retrieve his health. On 18 July 1779 he wrote to Francis from Murshidabad: &#145;From some remaining obstruction in my liver I have been necessitated to recommence, or rather to prolong my course of mercury, which prevents so sudden a restoration of strength as I had once reason to expect&#146;  (BL OIOC, MS Eur. E/17). Thirteen days later, on 31 July 1779, Dow died at Bhagalpur, aged forty-three. Two years later an inventory was made up of his possessions in Bengal. From his papers it appeared that they amounted to Re146,720 (about &pound;18,000), but his administrators had by that time only been able to recover half of that sum.<br>
