<span class="headword">Price,  John</span>  (1626/7&#150;1691), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, was born at Gatcombe on the Isle of Wight, the son of Ellis Price, rector of Gatcombe, and his wife, who was probably Ann, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Rathborne. John Price went to Eton College as a king's scholar: he and his younger brother William (1631&#150;1684) were so poor that in 1645 they received a grant from the college. On 10 January 1645, aged eighteen, he went to King's College, Cambridge. He graduated BA in 1650, and was elected to a fellowship of the college, a post he held until 1656. He proceeded MA in 1653. His brother William followed him from Eton to King's in 1648 and was also a fellow there, from 1651 to 1666.<br>
<br>Price served General George Monck, who had been a fellow-commoner at King's in 1627, as a chaplain in Scotland from 1654 to 1659, becoming his chosen confidant. In August 1659 he was particularly involved, along with Monck's clerical brother, Nicholas, Dr Thomas Gumble, the Presbyterian chaplain to the Edinburgh council, and Dr Samuel Barrow, a physician, in the plan to send a remonstrance to parliament, &#145;to complain of the long sitting of Parliament and to call for elections&#146;  (Masson, 5.476&#150;7). Indeed Price seems to have been the trusted amanuensis of this Dalkeith letter, which was later burnt once General Lambert had crushed the summer insurrection.<br>
<br>Travelling south with General Monck towards London, Price complained of a long fast sermon he and the general had to endure from Hugh Peters at St Albans in late January 1660. The House of Commons instructed him on 26 April 1660 to preach before them at St Margaret's Church to celebrate the day of solemn thanksgiving for the &#145;Mercies God has bestowed on the nation through the successful conduct of the Lord General Monk&#146;. In his sermon on 10 May he observed that the Church of England &#145;could not have fallen but by the heates of its own Ecclesiasticks&#146;, that the country would never mean mischief to the court, &#145;unlesse the Court first minister occasion of offence, either seeming or real&#146;, and that it was to the subjects' advantage &#145;to keep the prerogative of the Crown inviolable&#146;  (J. Price, <span class="italic">Sermon Preached before the Honourable House of Commons at St Margarets</span>, 1660, epistle dedicatory) and likened the occasion to the annual thanksgiving for the 1605 Gunpowder Plot.<br>
<br>Price was later well rewarded for his loyalty. Nicholas Monck having become provost of Eton, on 12 July 1660 Price became one of the fellows there. He kept rooms at Eton until his death, when he bequeathed the tapestries and fireplace picture in his &#145;great Roome&#146; to his successor  (TNA: PRO, PROB 11/404, fol. 188<i>v</i>). Further, Charles II presented him to the prebendal stall of Grimston in Salisbury Cathedral, on 8 October 1660 during the vacancy in see. This was fully three weeks before the house committee on religion was due to meet again to discuss the status of non-episcopally ordained clerics. This followed the rowdy discussions in July for the settling of ministers. Sir Edward Dering fulminated that &#145;ordination by presbyters without a bishop is &hellip; not so much discountenanced, but left equally estimable to the ancient episcopal ordination&#146;  (<span class="italic">Diaries and Papers</span>, 49). Dering's appeals reopened the debate over discipline and nonconformity. In spite of this Price was instituted on 28 November 1660 and later installed. He received Anglican orders as deacon on 23 January, and priest on 31 January the following year, and in the same year the University of Cambridge conferred on him a DD by royal letters patent. (He incorporated this degree at Oxford in 1680.)<br>
<br>In 1669 Price became rector of Petworth, Sussex. Price remained close to Monck and in 1676 wrote &#145;The designed loyaltie of the renowned Generall George Monck in restoring King Charles&#146;, now in the British Library, published in 1680 as <span class="italic">Mystery and Method of his Majesty's Happy Restauration</span>. In September 1683, following the Rye House plot, he preached against division and backbiting, appealing for unity and, by way of admonition, recalled a time when parliament soldiers &#145;did Plunder the Houses and take away the Houses of honest country-men&#146;  (J. Price, <span class="italic">Sermon Preached at Petworth in Sussex Sept. 9. 1683</span>, 1683, 9). The sermon was printed at the behest of his patron, the duchess of Somerset.<br>
<br>For many years Price lived at Petworth with his wife, Frances, who suffered from dementia. By his will of 10 October 1690 he provided that she and her sister Margaret Edmonds should be allowed to live in his house in Suffolk Street in London with a lifelong maintenance grant from his estate. He required that at her death a substantial charity be established to support scholars of King's College. He died at Petworth on 17 April 1691 and was buried in the parish church on 20 April. He and his wife had no children.<br>
