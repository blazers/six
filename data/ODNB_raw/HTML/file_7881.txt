<span class="headword">Douglas,  Sylvester</span>, Baron Glenbervie  (1743&#150;1823), <span class="occ">politician and diarist</span>, was born in Fechil, Aberdeenshire, on 24 May 1743, the elder and only surviving son of John Douglas (1713/14&#150;1762), landowner, of Whiteriggs, Kincardineshire, and his first wife, Margaret Gordon (<i>d</i>. 1747), daughter and coheir of James Gordon of Fechil. His father was descended from a brother of Sir William Douglas of Glenbervie, later earl of Angus, and resided at Fechil after having bought out his wife's two sisters, who were second cousins of George Keith, the Jacobite Earl Marischal. Douglas's pride in his genealogy is displayed in the account of his family which he published in the third edition of <span class="italic">Lyric Poems</span> (1806) by his brother-in-law, the poet James Mercer (1734&#150;1804), who had married his only sister, Katherine Douglas.<br>
<br>Douglas was educated at Foveran School, Aberdeen, where bullying by a young kinsman, so he later alleged, damaged his development. From 1754 his father engaged tutors (Alan Gordon, John Calder, and Alexander Gall) to teach him at home, until in 1757 he entered King's College, Aberdeen, of which he later became rector from 1805 to 1814. He lived at home, his father having moved to Aberdeen, and left college without a degree in 1760. After his father's death he spent some time in Edinburgh, proceeded to London in 1765, and took a medical degree at Leiden in 1766, with a dissertation &#145;De stimulis&#146;. He travelled to Paris, then toured Italy and progressed to Vienna, from where he visited Hungary; his first publication was to be an account of Tokay wines in the <span class="italic">Philosophical Transactions</span> (1773). He returned to London in 1769, switched from medicine to the law, and entered Lincoln's Inn in 1771. When called to the bar in 1776 he had already embarked on reporting the disputed parliamentary elections to the 1774 House of Commons, which were published in four volumes in 1775 and 1777. From 1778 he reported Lord Mansfield's judicial decisions in king's bench, published in 1783. He was elected FSA in 1781 and FRS 1795. In 1779 he published <span class="italic">Treatise on the Provincial Dialect of Scotland</span>, described as &#145;by far the most sophisticated example of the Pronouncing Dictionary in eighteenth-century Scotland&#146;  (C. Jones, ed., <span class="italic">The Edinburgh History of the Scots Language</span>, 1997, 289), and reprinted in 1991.<br>
<br>By 1784 Douglas's election reports were said to earn him &pound;3000 a year. He had also, since his call, practised on the Oxford circuit, and for a decade to 1794 he was king's attorney. Tall and high-nosed with beetling black brows, he was more remarkable for his assimilative capacity and ambition than for any originality. One of the prosecuting counsel for Warren Hastings's impeachment, he moved in whig circles, joining Brooks's Club and the Whig Club in 1789, when he made a momentous marriage on 25 September that year. His bride, Catherine Anne North (1760&#150;1817), to whom he had been introduced by Lord Sheffield, was the eldest daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20304/', "Frederick North, second earl of Guilford (1732&#150;1792)")</script>, the former premier, and his wife, Anne Speke, and was her father's match for wit and ugliness. They had a son, <a href="#cosubject_7881">Frederick Sylvester North Douglas [<i>see below</i>]</a>, but both of their daughters were stillborn. Douglas's whig friends had encouraged him to look to high legal office during the Regency crisis, but even the solicitor-generalship would have left him much poorer than his professional income, and he was in no hurry to enter parliament, which served him better with its crop of election and canal disputes.<br>
<br>The death of his father-in-law in 1792 freed Douglas from whig shackles. He joined the phalanx of Portland whigs who went over to Pitt the younger's administration. He took silk on 7 February 1793, and became a bencher of his inn (of which he was to be treasurer in 1799). After complaining loudly of not having been made solicitor-general to the prince of Wales, he was offered a commissionership at Toulon, captured from the French, in September 1793. As this appointment was worth &pound;1500 a year and not pensionable, Douglas declined, preferring an under-secretaryship at the Foreign Office. In January 1794, however, he agreed to become chief secretary to the lord lieutenant of Ireland, and was sworn of the Irish privy council on 20 January and of the British privy council on 4 May. Report had it that having failed to &#145;bustle himself into the Chancellorship of Ireland&#146;, he &#145;bullied himself into the Secretaryship&#146;  (Walpole, 12.124). He sat for St Canice in the Irish parliament. Recalled from Dublin with Viceroy Westmorland in January 1795, he was unable to obtain the sinecure Irish secretaryship of state, being told this was reserved for Irishmen, but he was offered compensations: the first vacant lordship of the Treasury at home, a seat at the Board of Control for India, a pension of &pound;800, half of which was to descend to his son, and a seat in parliament. The latter was for Fowey, where he was by-elected on 14 February 1795 with ministerial backing, having failed in his negotiations elsewhere. His pension, awarded on 21 March 1795, was actually set at &pound;600 for life and the same in survivorship for himself or his son unless he accepted office of &pound;1000 a year (a condition which reflected his stated aspiration to succeed John Robinson as surveyor of woods and forests). He gave his maiden speech on disputed elections on 14 April 1795, but was shouted down when he defended Westmorland's Irish administration on 19 May. In June he took his seat at the Board of Control, but chafed for further employment. Lord Camden would not have him as his chief secretary at Dublin, although the king had suggested it, and he tried to make himself useful to ministers in debate, coming to the defence of Henry Dundas and of Pitt, whose <span class="roman">Poor Relief Bill</span> he helped to prepare. In March 1796 he obtained a seat at the Board of Trade.<br>
<br>Douglas sat for Midhurst on Lord Carrington's interest in the 1796 parliament. In September he was invited to accompany Lord Macartney to the Cape with the promise of succeeding him as governor in eighteen months' time, and of receiving a &pound;2000 pension two years later. He agreed, on condition that he would be raised to the Irish peerage, but his wife disapproved, and her influence on his decisions was paramount. He jobbed with Dundas to place him at the Treasury board instead. In the Commons he served as committee chairman and teller, and was a notable promoter of the Irish union: his speech of 22 April 1799 answering objections to it was published in 1800. When in January 1800 he was again offered the governorship of the Cape, his wife took the blame for his refusal. After talk of a continental mission, he settled for the Cape in October 1800, and was duly created Baron Glenbervie on 30 November. Pitt's resignation spared him the Cape, and from Addington he requested the Home Office. Instead he was appointed joint paymaster-general, in March 1801, to which he would have preferred a return to Dublin or promotion on the Board of Control, and finding himself second fiddle at the pay office, he angled to replace Dundas in charge of Scottish affairs. As his Irish peerage enabled him to sit at Westminster, he was by-elected for Plympton Erle as a government nominee on 6 July 1801; he made himself useful in debate, and was offered the presidency of the Board of Control. This still did not satisfy his ambitions as he would have preferred the vice-presidency of the Board of Trade, presiding in Lord Liverpool's absence, or better still, the speakership. He scorned, as Lord North's son-in-law, Addington's proposal of a diplomatic mission to the United States in December 1801, even though he introduced a bill easing commercial relations with America, and on 24 May 1802 reminded Addington that he had no objection to negotiating a commercial treaty with France.<br>
<br>In January 1803 Glenbervie, who sat for Hastings as a Treasury nominee in that parliament, succeeded Robinson as surveyor of woods and forests, thereby enabling Addington's brother to replace him at the pay office, although he would have preferred to have held both. He obtained &pound;3000 a year, but not for life, and promotion in the peerage might have compensated him. Ostensibly for health reasons he took little part in debate, and in February 1804 gave up the Board of Trade. On Pitt's return to power that year he was a doubtful supporter, and offered to relinquish office only if compensated. By September he was listed as a reliable government supporter, and in 1805 defended Lord Melville against charges of naval maladministration. He was mortified to lose his surveyorship when the Grenville administration took over in February 1806. He complained that the pension he negotiated was only a fifth of what he had been earning in 1793, and tried to obtain compensatory employment hearing appeals to the privy council. He did not seek re-election to parliament that year. The Portland ministry restored him to the surveyorship of the woods and forests in April 1807, reducing his salary but not sufficiently to allow him to retain his pension: this saved the public &pound;1600 a year. In July 1810, when his office was reformed, he became first of three commissioners. Then, and in 1812, he was criticized as a jobber in the Commons, and Lord Liverpool was reluctant to let him serve in 1814 in view of his pension claims. He travelled on the continent, and his later years were devoted to a vain attempt to guide his son's career. His wife died on 6 February 1817 and his son in 1819. Cared for by his daughter-in-law, he turned to literary pursuits. Nothing came of a projected biography of Lord North, but he managed a translation of part of the Italian poet Fortiguerri's <span class="italic">Ricciardetto</span>, published in 1822. From 1812 he was a trustee of the British Museum. He died at Cheltenham on 2 May 1823, whereupon his title became extinct. His journals and diaries, published piecemeal in 1910 and 1928, are a record of his aspirations and disappointments, interlaced with scandalous anecdotes, political gossip, and travel notes, which account for their attraction as a period piece.<br>
<br>His son, <a name="cosubject_7881"></a><span class="headword">Frederick Sylvester North Douglas</span>  (1791&#150;1819), <span class="occ">politician and classical scholar</span>, was born in Bedford Square, London, on 8 February 1791 and christened at home by the rector of St Giles-in-the-Fields, Bloomsbury. Delicate and precocious, he was educated at Sunbury School, proceeding to Westminster School in 1801 and Christ Church, Oxford, in 1806. Admitted to Lincoln's Inn in 1807, he was not called to the bar. Taking a first in classics and a top second in maths at Oxford in 1809 (MA, 1813), he went to Edinburgh to pursue his studies, but was taken ill. Physically he resembled his mother's family. In 1810 he embarked on a two-year tour of Greece and the Near East, under the aegis of his philhellenic uncle <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20305/', "Frederick North, fifth earl of Guilford (1766&#150;1827)")</script>, colonial governor in Ceylon. His <span class="italic">Essay on Certain Points of Resemblance between the Ancient and the Modern Greeks</span> went into a second edition in June 1813, in which year he acted as Germaine de Sta&euml;l's guide to Oxford and deputy secretary of the politically ambivalent Grillion's Club. He had entered parliament in 1812 for Banbury, the North family borough, of which his father was recorder. His political independence soon alarmed his father. His maiden speech was lukewarm in support of the Christianization of India and he consistently voted for Catholic relief and abolition of the slave trade. More conventionally he was shy of parliamentary reform, apart from sponsorship of a bill (lost on 16 May 1814) to stop payment of non-resident electors' expenses. He opposed the peacetime reduction of the militia in 1815; he had been a major in the Surrey militia since 1813, and was a captain in the Oxfordshire yeomanry in 1817. During the recess in 1814 he interviewed Bonaparte, who liked him best of his English visitors on Elba. From February 1816, when he consulted the speaker about his debating style, which was disliked by reporters, he acted increasingly under the whig opposition, joining Brooks's Club on 7 May. He voted against the address and tried to exempt Scotland from measures against sedition in the 1817 session, to the chagrin of his father, whom he joined on a continental tour in the autumn. In spite of defending his father and uncle in debate in 1818, he also delivered a speech on 15 May against the <span class="roman">Aliens Bill</span> which went unanswered by the administration. In 1819 he conceded the need for piecemeal parliamentary reform, and in his last speeches in June, he spoke in favour of South American independence and educational reform. On 19 July 1819 he married a whig bride, Harriet Wrightson (<i>d</i>. 1864), eldest daughter of William Wrightson of Cusworth, Yorkshire. He died on 21 October 1819, after a bout of jaundice, in Brook Street, Westminster. According to one obituary, he had &#145;enlivened every society by his presence&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 1st ser., 89/2 1819, 468). His widow married in 1825 Colonel Henry Hely Hutchinson and died on 16 July 1864.<br>
