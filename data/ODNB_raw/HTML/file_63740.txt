<span class="headword">Wimberley,  Douglas Neil</span>  (1896&#150;1983), <span class="occ">army officer and educational administrator</span>, was born on 15 August 1896 at 8 Ardross Terrace, Inverness, the son of Colonel Charles Neil Campbell Wimberley (then a surgeon-captain), and his wife, Minnie Lesmoir Gordon, daughter of Colonel R. J. Wimberley. Educated at Wellington College and the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, he was commissioned into the Queen's Own Cameron Highlanders in 1915. He served on the western front, was wounded, and won the MC.<br>
<br>A very bright officer, Wimberley gained distinction in promotion examinations in 1924, and then studied at Emmanuel College, Cambridge, before entering the Staff College, Camberley, in 1925. On 29 April that year he married Elsye Myrtle Livington (<i>b</i>. 1903/4), daughter of Captain F. L. Campbell RN. They had a son and a daughter. He continued to win distinction as a peacetime soldier: his essay on the lessons of recent campaigns won the <span class="italic">Army Quarterly</span> military prize in 1933. When war came Wimberley was commanding officer of the 1st Cameron Highlanders. Rapid promotion to general rank followed and in June 1941 he took command of the 51st (Highland) division.<br>
<br>Although heir to a proud tradition, scattered across north-eastern Scotland as it was when Wimberley took command, the Highland division lacked cohesion. He forged a strong divisional <i>esprit de corps</i>, drawing heavily on Scottish patriotism. He insisted that the divisional concert party include plenty of distinctively Scottish material in its act. He rejected &#145;Sassenach&#146; drafts and poached Scotsmen serving in other formations. Under Wimberley regimental tartan was worn whenever possible. Tartan Tam, as his troops dubbed him, proved an inspiring divisional commander and turned the highlanders into a formidable fighting force.<br>
<br>Having arrived in Egypt in August 1942, the division fought with the Eighth Army from Alamein to the end of the Sicily campaign. Wimberley always explained forthcoming operations to officers on a model, insisting that COs repeat the exercise so that every soldier knew how his tasks fitted into the divisional plan. Tall and lanky, he became a familiar figure touring divisional areas in his jeep, his knees seemingly level with his chin. On these travels he was not averse to explaining developments personally to private soldiers he met. Nor was he reluctant to contribute his own physical labour to encourage tired men to further effort.<br>
<br>The Highland division thrived under Wimberley's leadership, its unflagging morale underpinning exceptional fighting effectiveness. General Montgomery thought him a first-class divisional commander. After Sicily, however, both agreed that he needed a change&#151;a great loss to the division, which lacked its former edge under his successor. Judging Wimberley unsuited to corps command, Montgomery recommended him as commandant of the Staff College. After fifteen months in that post he moved in December 1944 to the War Office as director of infantry, which proved to be his last appointment in the army.<br>
<br>In October 1946 Wimberley resigned to pursue a rather less happy career as principal of University College, Dundee (UCD, later the University of Dundee), then a constituent college of the University of St Andrews. Ambiguous constitutional arrangements between the two institutions provoked constant dispute. The ancient university, suspicious of the upstart college across the Tay and jealous of its own higher status, opposed all duplication of academic fields worked at St Andrews. Although most of UCD's council favoured accommodation with St Andrews, some Dundee academics, many of the city fathers, and the city's local newspaper agitated for independence. In the difficult balancing act of satisfying the reasonable and necessary ambitions of his institution without undermining St Andrews, Wimberley received little co-operation from the university's principal, Sir James Irvine. Dundee academics did not help by excluding Wimberley from much academic decision making, denying him the background in academic politics needed to deal effectively with Irvine. None the less, under Wimberley's leadership UCD expanded steadily.<br>
<br>Wimberley avoided a military management style, which would not have worked in a college, but habitual morale-building was a welcome survivor of his military past. He strove to create an <i>esprit de corps</i> among staff and students, improving college premises and facilities, and establishing a ceremonial university service at the parish kirk. The appointment to a lectureship of the prominent Scottish nationalist Douglas Young illustrates the retired major-general's open-mindedness. Young had preferred prison to fighting in a British (rather than Scottish) army during the war. This disqualified him in Irvine's eyes. Perhaps recalling the fierce patriotism he had encouraged in the Highland division, however, Wimberley admired Young's moral courage, ignored Irvine's objections, and hired him.<br>
<br>Wimberley hoped to remain after the reconstitution of UCD within the university in 1954. Indeed, most Dundee academics wanted him to stay. The new vice-chancellor of St Andrews, however, insisted that college principalships be part-time posts filled by senior academics in rotation, precipitating Wimberley's retirement. Once a promising athlete, he took up genealogy in retirement and lived with his wife at Coupar Angus in Perthshire. He was colonel of the Queen's Own Cameron Highlanders from 1951 to 1961. He died at Foxhall, Coupar Angus, on 26 August 1983, survived by his wife.<br>
