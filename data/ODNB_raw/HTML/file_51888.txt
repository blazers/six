<span class="headword">Ranulf (I)</span> <span class="st"> [Ranulf le Meschin]</span>, third earl of Chester  (<em>d.</em> 1129), <span class="occ">magnate</span>, was son of Ranulf (Ralph) de Briquessart, vicomte of the Bessin (the area around Bayeux), and Matilda, daughter of Richard, vicomte of the Avranchin (the area around Avranches). The name Meschin (&#145;younger&#146; or &#145;junior&#146;) was presumably first employed to distinguish him from his father.<h2>
<a name="Familyandearlycareerintheborders"></a>Family and early career in the borders</h2>In the Durham book of fraternity (the <i>liber vitae</i>), in addition to Ranulf there are listed his parents, an elder brother, Richard, who died young, and a younger brother, William; and he had also a sister, Agnes, who was the first wife of Robert de Grandmesnil (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1136). Ranulf (I) was a member of the military household first of William II and then of Henry I. He is first recorded as Ranulf, son of Ranulf <i>le vicomte</i>, on 24 April 1089 when he authenticated with his cross a grant of Robert Curthose, duke of Normandy, to the cathedral of Bayeux. In 1093&#150;4, as nephew of Hugh d'Avranches, earl of Chester (<i>d</i>. 1101), he witnessed the charter which recorded the establishment of a monastic community at Chester. About 1098 he became the third husband of Lucy (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1138), heir of the honour of Bolingbroke, who had earlier been married first to Ivo Taillebois and then to Roger fitz Gerold (the father of her son William de Roumare). This made him a major landowner in Lincolnshire. It also either originated or strengthened his ties with what would become the English shires of Cumberland and Westmorland, centred on Carlisle. In succession to Ivo Taillebois he was for a time lord of Appleby, for he later referred to &#145;my castle&#146; in that place, which controlled the road from north Yorkshire to Carlisle  (Prescott, no. 3). William Rufus had captured Carlisle in 1092, and it became the centre of Anglo-Norman settlement in the region. Ranulf was long remembered as the first lord of this region, and his lordship was for a time visible on the ground. An interesting charter of David, king of Scots, granting Annandale to Robert (I) de Brus (<i>c</i>.1124), defined his territory as being north of &#145;the boundary of Ranulf Meschin&#146; (<i>divisam</i> <i>Randulphi Meschin</i>), and his rights as those &#145;which Ranulf Meschin once had in Carlisle and in his land of Cumberland&#146;  (Lawrie, 48&#150;9). It is possible that Ranulf's involvement at Carlisle predated 1100, for one of his charters describes William Rufus as his lord, but firm dates come from the reign of Henry I. Close to Carlisle, at Wetherhal, <i>c</i>.1106, Ranulf founded a Benedictine priory, a colony of St Mary's Abbey, York. The earliest baronies, according to the memory of the shire in 1212, were granted by Ranulf in the reign of Henry I, and the more significant of these were held by his relatives and dependants. His brother-in-law Robert de Trivers was given the lordship of Burgh by Sands. His Norman tenant Richer de Boiville received Kirklinton and served as sheriff.<h2>
<a name="WilliamleMeschin"></a>William le Meschin</h2>The most important member of a tightly knit family group was Ranulf's younger brother <a name="cosubject_51888"></a><span class="headword">William  le Meschin</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1129<span class="mult">x</span>35)<span class="occ"></span>. William went on the first crusade, where he is mentioned, as &#145;William son of Ranulf <i>le vicomte</i>&#146; at the siege of Nicaea in 1097  (Ordericus Vitalis, <span class="italic">Eccl. hist.</span>, 5.59). In Cumbria William le Meschin was first given charge of Gilsland, which he failed to hold against the Scots, and then Egremont (the barony of Copeland). He built the castle at Egremont, and close by on the coast he founded the priory of St Bees, a further daughter house of St Mary's, York. William le Meschin married Cecily de Rumilly, the daughter of Robert de Rumilly and heir to the barony of Skipton in Craven, west Yorkshire, thus creating a substantial cross-Pennine estate. William and Cecily were the founders of the priory of Embsay, which later removed to Bolton in Wharfedale. In addition to the two baronies of Egremont and Skipton, William le Meschin acquired tenancies in several counties, the more significant held of his brother in Lincolnshire (where the Lindsey survey of 1115&#150;18 provides detailed record) and in Cheshire. William remained closely linked with Ranulf, whom he survived by just a few years, dying before 1135. An elder son, Matthew, having predeceased him, William's heirs were successively his younger son, also called Ranulf le Meschin, and three sisters, Amice, Alice, and Matilda, who in the course of a total of seven marriages comprehensively dismembered the estate.<h2>
<a name="EarlofChester"></a>Earl of Chester</h2>Ranulf was in regular though not frequent attendance at the court of Henry I: he is found at various times at the palaces at Westminster, Winchester, and Rouen, at the hunting lodges at Brampton and Woodstock, and at the monastery at Reading. Most significantly, he was one of the commanders of Henry's forces at the battle of Tinchebrai in late September 1106, the others being Robert, count of Meulan, and William (II) de Warenne, earl of Surrey (<i>d</i>. 1138), all three men described by Orderic Vitalis as officers of the royal household. Ranulf was one of the magnates who witnessed the treaty of Dover made with the count of Flanders on 17 May 1110; and he was present at the Christmas court at St Albans in 1115. He occurs twice as a royal justice, first in 1106, then <i>c</i>.1116, and it may be significant that in each case one of his fellow justices was Geoffrey Ridel, whose wife was an illegitimate daughter of Hugh d'Avranches, earl of Chester. Even with his substantial English lordships, Ranulf was frequently in Normandy, particularly at times of military threat.<br>
<br>In 1119 Orderic Vitalis mentioned &#145;Richard, earl of Chester, and his kinsman and successor Ralph of Briquessart&#146; as pre-eminent among those who remained loyal to the king  (Ordericus Vitalis, <span class="italic">Eccl. hist.</span>, 6.223). The chronicler here looked ahead to the last and most crucial of the events that determined Ranulf's career. On 21 November 1120 Richard of Chester and Ranulf were together at Barfleur and witnessed a charter in favour of the abbey of Cerisy. Just four days later Richard died in the <i>White Ship</i> disaster. Ranulf was appointed earl of Chester in succession to his cousin, and occurs as such in a charter issued at London early in January 1121. The precise terms of his succession are not clear, but certainly some of Lucy's Lincolnshire lands were surrendered to the king, and seemingly also Ranulf's lordships in Cumbria. According to later tradition, on succeeding to the earldom Ranulf &#145;gave back to the lord king the county (<i>comitatus</i>) of Cumbria, on condition that each of those he had enfeoffed should hold of the king in chief&#146;  (Wilson, 492): this is from the <span class="italic">Chronicon Cumbrie</span>, a &#145;special source of error&#146; according to J. H. Round  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>), but with regard to the timing of the transfer probably accurate. He promised the king a substantial relief, for in 1129/30 his son Earl Ranulf (II) owed &pound;1000 &#145;for his father's debt for the land of Earl Hugh&#146;  (<span class="italic">Pipe rolls</span>, 31 Henry I, 110). This may well represent the full total of the original debt, for good connections at court and loyal service in the field would temper the king's demands for payment.<br>
<br>At court in the early 1120s Earl Ranulf (I) was named as chief among the kinsfolk who arranged a marriage that linked the Basset and Ridel families: named also in an agreement ratified by the king at Woodstock were his brother William le Meschin, his constable William, his chancellor Geoffrey, and Nigel d'Aubigny. All the while the old campaigner remained on military alert. In March 1123 the king at Woodstock received news of a threat from supporters of William Clito (<i>d</i>. 1128), and immediately the earls of Gloucester and Chester were sent over to Normandy &#145;to guard that territory&#146;  (Symeon of Durham, 267&#150;8). Throughout the winter of 1123&#150;4 Ranulf had charge of the garrison of &Eacute;vreux. Good intelligence of the movements of the enemy led to the ambush at Bourgth&eacute;roulde on 25 March 1124, which led to the capture of Waleran, count of Meulan, and others, and gained Ranulf much credit.<h2>
<a name="Deathandlegacy"></a>Death and legacy</h2>The earldom of Chester gave Ranulf his title, but in the county itself he may not have had time to put down strong roots. His own grants as earl were all confirmations, to St Evroult in Normandy, to St Werburgh's, Chester, and to his wife's foundation at Spalding in Lincolnshire. He did, however, establish a second generation of his family in English lordship. His daughter Alice married the marcher lord Richard de Clare who was killed by the Welsh in late April 1136. Among the witnesses to his son's charters occur Richard Bacun, who married an illegitimate daughter, an illegitimate son, Benedict, and Fulk de Briquessart, who was possibly his nephew. Ranulf died in January 1129, and was buried in the chapter house of Chester Abbey. A long series of agreements made by his son <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/23128/', "Ranulf (II) (de Gernons)")</script> and his widow, the Countess Lucy, are entered on the pipe roll of 1129/30. Among these the countess offered the king 500 marks that she not be required to marry again.<br>
