<span class="headword">Ludlow <span class="st"> [Lodelowe]</span>,  Lawrence  of</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1294), <span class="occ">merchant</span>, was the son of <a name="cosubject_52190"></a><span class="headword">Nicholas  of Ludlow</span>  (<em>d.</em> in or before 1279), also a <span class="occ">merchant</span>, and his first wife, Margery, to whom he was married by 1267. Although his family took its name from Ludlow in Shropshire, the centre for Nicholas's operations was Shrewsbury, where the fine wools of the Welsh borderlands provided the basis for his fortunes. Active in the wool trade by the mid-1260s, Nicholas had important court connections; he was described as merchant to Edward I, as both prince and king, and bought cloths and skins for Edward's cousin, Henry of Almain. In the 1270s Nicholas was exporting wool (often through London) on a considerable scale, and inevitably suffered from the disruption of trade caused by English disputes with successive rulers of Flanders between 1270 and 1276, even though he was several times licensed to export wool at times of embargo&#151;in 1274 his losses were estimated at &pound;1928. His personal involvement made him an appropriate person to be sent to Flanders in 1276 to demand reimbursement for English losses. But in spite of his difficulties his profits remained such as to enable him to sell silver to the mint worth &pound;900 per annum. Nicholas was dead by 20 August 1279; Margery had predeceased him, and he left a widow named Idonia. His children, at least four sons and two daughters, all appear to have been born of his first marriage.<br>
<br>Lawrence of Ludlow was probably the eldest of Nicholas's sons. Active as a merchant by 1272, he seems sometimes to have traded in partnership with his father and brothers, two of whom (John and Thomas) also dealt in wool. Indeed, it may not be an exaggeration to describe him as the head of a family business. His sister Cecilia's first husband, John Adrian, was a London draper who traded in wool, while her second, John Banquell, was a lawyer who might act as Lawrence's attorney. Like his father, Lawrence exported wool to the Low Countries in the 1270s (200 sacks in 1277, for instance) and afterwards; in 1285 he complained that 60 sacks destined for sale abroad had been arrested at Boston fair at the suit of a merchant of Arras. And he continued to trade in his native Shropshire&#151;at the 1292 Shropshire eyre his name headed the list of those infringing the assize of cloth at Ludlow. His wealth enabled Lawrence to lend money to the king, who in 1291 made arrangements to repay a loan of 1000 marks, and also to lay and ecclesiastical magnates in and around Shropshire, including the earl of Arundel, Edmund Mortimer of Wigmore, Roger Mortimer of Chirk, John (V) Lestrange of Knockin (who acknowledged owing &pound;4000), the abbot of Buildwas, and Worcester Cathedral priory. Another outlet for his capital was real estate. Lawrence bought several properties in Ludlow itself, and at the time of his death was in process of acquiring the Shropshire manors of Rowton and Ellerdine. But his most notable purchase was the manor of Stokesay, some 7 miles north-west of Ludlow, which he bought in 1281. Since he obtained rights of common for his livestock in the neighbouring manor of Sibdon, Lawrence probably did not intend Stokesay to be only a country retreat. Even so, the grant of free warren which he obtained in the year of purchase, and still more the fortified manor house which he constructed there, obtaining a licence to crenellate in 1291, may still point to social ambitions for himself and his family. The structure surviving in the late twentieth century incorporated earlier work, but the three-storied south tower, the impressive hall, with the fine timberwork of its cruck roof and staircase, and the handsome stone fireplace and decorated floor tiles in the north tower, all of the late thirteenth century, proclaimed their owner and creator as a man of wealth, taste, and standing.<br>
<br>Lawrence of Ludlow was clearly a capable man of affairs, with talents extending beyond commerce. In June 1294 Ralph de Tosny, lord of Painscastle in Shropshire, who was about to go overseas, made Lawrence his principal agent for the administration of his estates during his absence. The king, too, made use of Lawrence's organizational skills. 1294 saw the outbreak of war with France, and Edward I, badly in need of funds, devised ways of raising money with Lawrence's assistance. The annals of Dunstable specifically attributed a new tax on exports of wool, the so-called &#145;malt&ocirc;te&#146; of 40<i>s</i>. per sack, to Lawrence of Ludlow, describing him as <i>nominatissimus mercatorum</i> (&#145;most renowned of merchants&#146;; <span class="italic">Ann. mon.</span>, 3.389). And he was also involved in an accompanying scheme for raising money from wool, which was to be shipped under royal supervision to the Low Countries, and customs duties paid to the king's officers on its arrival, while its owners would also make loans to the king from the proceeds of subsequent sales. The money thus raised would go towards the substantial sums which Edward I undertook to pay to his allies, the archbishop of Cologne and the count of Bar. The latter had earlier visited England, and Lawrence was apparently involved in negotiations with the count, who was later said to have received &pound;200 from him in London.<br>
<br>The fleet carrying the wool left from London under the command of Lawrence of Ludlow, whose own contribution to the king's finances was later calculated at just over &pound;1000 in customs payments and loans, and the royal clerk Roger of Lincoln, but ran into a storm. Most of the fleet escaped destruction, but the ship carrying Lawrence and Roger was driven onto the Suffolk coast at Aldeburgh on the night of 26 November 1294, and both men were drowned. Lawrence's body was recovered from the sea and buried at Ludlow on 20 December following. With his wife, Agnes, he had at least five sons, and some of his purchases of land may have been intended to provide for them&#151;a fragment of his will records a bequest of two messuages and seven shops in Ludlow to his youngest son, Richard. After his death his widow herself traded in wool, and in company with her eldest son, William, devoted much energy to the recovery of her husband's debts. She later married Simon Leyburn. The descendants of Lawrence of Ludlow deserted trade for a country life in Shropshire, remaining lords of Stokesay until 1497.<br>
