<span class="headword">Payne,  (George) Adney</span>  (1846&#150;1907), <span class="occ">music-hall manager</span>, was born in the Curragh, Ireland, the son of Edward Payne, a licensed victualler. Unlike most music-hall entrepreneurs of his generation, Adney Payne (as he was generally referred to), was not born into the theatrical profession. Indeed, he frequently recalled that his parents had held a very low opinion of the value of popular entertainments.<br>
<br>It was while working as a wine merchant in Greenwich that Payne first became involved in the music-hall business. In 1878 he and Charles Spencer Crowder purchased Lusby's music-hall, Mile End Road, for &pound;25,000. Crowder took responsibility for the theatrical aspects of the business, while Payne utilized his experience as a licensed victualler in overseeing the backstage activities, primarily the sale of refreshments. Lusby's had a chequered history under Crowder and Payne's control. It bore the brunt of Frederick Charrington's religious crusade against London's music-halls and was burnt down in 1884, soon reopening as the Paragon. Meanwhile, in 1882 Crowder and Payne also purchased the Canterbury music-hall, Westminster Bridge Road, Lambeth. When Crowder retired in 1887, Payne became managing director of the newly formed Canterbury and Paragon Limited.<br>
<br>Payne rose to prominence within the music-hall business during the West End boom of the 1890s as a key figure in the emergence of Henry Newson-Smith's syndicate of theatres. After the retirement of the latter in 1896, Payne, as the managing director of the Tivoli and Oxford music-halls and the London Pavilion, enjoyed a virtual monopoly over the West End's music-halls. He was largely responsible for nurturing the talents of many of the greatest &#145;stars&#146; of the variety stage who rose to fame during the 1890s and was closely associated with the much heralded &#145;improvement&#146; in both the artistic merit and the moral tone of performances and in the behaviour of audiences at this time. After the turn of the century Payne, in collaboration with Henry Gros, turned his attention to the booming suburban music-hall market, becoming joint managing director of &#145;Palaces&#146; in Chelsea, Walthamstow, Tottenham, and East Ham. His influence over the metropolitan music-hall business was further enhanced by the marriage of one of his daughters to Walter Gibbons, another leading manager.<br>
<br>Payne was twice married. His first wife was Marion Ford (<i>d</i>. 1897); they had six children, two of whom died in infancy. On 15 November 1898 he married Clara Agnes Proctor (whose stage name was Ethel Earle), a theatrical and music-hall performer. She was the daughter of Alfred Pavey, a builder and estate agent. Payne was a keen fruit grower and horticulturalist and a member of the Hertfordshire yeomanry for seventeen years. He took especial pride in his thirty prizes for best turned-out man and horse at local shows.<br>
<br>According to one obituary Payne played a significant role in &#145;the foundation of the variety theatres into a large commercial industry&#146;  (<span class="italic">Daily Mail</span>, 16 May 1907); and he was certainly renowned for his energy and perseverance. An imposing figure, he was &#145;a man of wonderful decision and dominating temperament&#146;  (<span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span>, 16 May 1907) and &#145;when his mind was thoroughly made up as to a particular course, nothing would divert him from it&#146;  (ibid., 18 May 1907, 4). In spite of his &#145;marshal [<i>sic</i>] bearing, [and] strict disciplinarian methods in business&#146;  (<span class="italic">Daily Mail</span>, 16 May 1907) Payne cultivated a paternalistic relationship with his performers and was a trustee of the Music Hall Benevolent Fund. Notwithstanding this image, Payne's halls were boycotted by performers during the infamous music-hall strike of 1907.<br>
<br>George Adney Payne died of a blood clot at the Mount Ephraim Hotel, Tunbridge Wells, on 15 May 1907, ten days after a serious motor car accident in the town. He was buried in a family plot in St Pancras cemetery, East Finchley, on 18 May. He was survived by his wife.<br>
