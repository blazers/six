<span class="headword">Maxse, Dame  (Sarah Algeria) Marjorie</span>  (1891&#150;1975), <span class="occ">political organizer</span>, was born on 26 October 1891 at Villa du Palmier, Birmandreis, Algiers, one of the two children, and the only daughter, of Ernest George Berkeley Maxse (1863&#150;1943), British vice-consul at Algiers, and his wife, Sarah Alice, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Miller (<i>d</i>. 1908). Marjorie Maxse was a cousin of Leo Maxse, for many years editor of the <span class="italic">National Review</span>, and of Sir (Frederick) Ivor Maxse, a distinguished First World War general. Her father's work for the consular service meant that she spent the first twenty-five years of her life abroad, and she acquired an understanding of foreign countries and the aspirations of other peoples that proved of value in later life. During the First World War she served for a time as an auxiliary nurse in a French military hospital. She was appointed MBE in 1918.<br>
<br>Maxse was a natural leader who combined powers of self-control and reserve with clear vision and a single-minded determination to achieve her goals. Her freedom from personal animus was an especially valuable attribute in the world of politics, where she made her career. In 1921 she was chosen as one of the first women area agents appointed by Conservative central office. The 1918 <span class="roman">Representation of the People Act</span> meant that urgent attention had to be given to organizing women voters, and the Conservative Party was in many respects in the forefront of this development. In 1923 Maxse was promoted to be the first administrator of the Women's Unionist Organization (WUO) based at the party headquarters in London. The WUO was a highly successful political organization, whose purpose was, she told party agents in 1924, &#145;to teach women to be voters and Conservative voters, not to create a feminist movement within the Conservative party&#146;  (McCrillis, 62). Along with Caroline Bridgeman and Gwendolen Guinness she was one of the WUO's chief promoters. Under John Colin Campbell Davidson, Conservative Party chairman 1926&#150;30, she became in 1928 deputy principal agent of the party. As a member of the governing body of the Junior Imperial League she helped to organize the canvassing of recently enfranchised young women voters, and dismissed the suggestion that the &#145;flapper vote&#146; had played a part in the Conservatives' defeat at the general election of 1929  (ibid., 190, 216). In 1931 she was appointed chief organization officer, the first woman to occupy such a role in any political party. She held this post until 1939. Maxse was thus one of the &#145;principal architects&#146; in the development of women's organization in the Conservative Party  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 6 May 1975).<br>
<br>Women Conservatives were important for fund-raising and canvassing, and Maxse aimed as far as possible to maximize their influence in the party. She believed that men mostly did not wish to give them organizational responsibility, or indeed any &#145;legitimate sphere for their aspiration&#146;, and so she favoured developing separate women's branches at the constituency level  (Maguire, 75). By retaining a separate organization women stood a greater chance to gain recognition of their role, as well as retain a degree of autonomy. She appreciated that this could also lead to their being marginalized, but on balance she felt that the policy brought about real advances.<br>
<br>Maxse also understood that a united party organization would ultimately develop, and to this end did her best to harmonize relations between the sexes. There were inevitably tensions. When Davidson took office as party chairman he perceived &#145;a distinct antagonism running right through the organization in the country between the men and the women&#146;, which he feared would seriously undermine party unity  (Maguire, 79). An obvious area of disagreement lay between party agents and women organizers at the constituency level. The latter, who were paid officials employed by the local associations, convened committee meetings, formed branches, and taught basic political organization to interested women activists. In some places they virtually did the work of party agents, but for less money. The national society of Conservative agents, though, would not countenance admitting them to membership. While advising the women workers not to seek to usurp the position of men, Maxse sought for them greater parity with the party agents. Davidson supported her in mediating the ongoing disputes, and with powerful backing at central office she overcame much of the resentment. Davidson regarded her appointment as deputy principal agent as &#145;a bold undertaking&#146;, but one that he considered to have been vindicated by the growing co-operation between men and women in the party  (Rhodes James, 338&#150;9).<br>
<br>In 1940 Maxse was appointed director of the Children's Overseas Reception Board. In the same year she became, with Lady Iris Capell and Mary Agnes Hamilton, one of the three vice-chairs of the Women's Voluntary Services for Civil Defence (WVS), in succession to Priscilla Norman (Mrs Montagu Norman). In principle a non-political organization, the WVS had a Conservative bias, and both Maxse and her successor, Lady Hillingdon, &#145;played a major role&#146; in its daily running, in contrast to their Labour colleagues, Mary Agnes Hamilton and Dorothy Archibald  (Hinton, 291).<br>
<br>Maxse relinquished her offices at the Children's Overseas Reception Board and the WVS in 1944, when she accepted an invitation to become vice-chair of the Conservative Party Organization. The general election defeat in 1945 forced the Conservative Party to look hard at its constituency organization, and under Lord Woolton, chairman of central office, the old structure of separate men's and women's branches was abolished. There were still women's sections in the constituencies, co-ordinated by women's advisory committees, whose task it was to advance the interests of women in the party. But Woolton was determined to unify the party structure, and he valued very highly Maxse's experience of the party machine. She served as his adviser on all women's work.<br>
<br>The decline of Conservative Party organization in the constituencies by 1945 was seen by Maxse as a possible opportunity for the advancement of women, and yet the introduction of joint branches seemed to frustrate this hope. By being grouped with the men, women party workers lost the autonomy they had previously enjoyed without any real compensatory increase in their power or influence. As a party vice-chair Maxse was determined that the joint organization should not become the cause &#145;of a falling-off on the women's side, for a falling-off had undoubtedly taken place&#146;  (Maguire, 141). She feared that the party might lag behind Labour and the Liberals &#145;in the formulation of policy of special interest to women&#146;  (ibid., 154). At the party conference in 1945 a resolution affirming equal opportunities, &#145;in order to ensure that the best mind or hand shall have the same chance to excel&#146;, was rejected  (Smith, 74). Conservative women badly needed encouragement, and Maxse supported the formation of a parliamentary subcommittee in November 1946 designed to forge closer links between the parliamentary party and the Conservative women's national advisory council. She would not be deflected from her belief that the best way of advancing the cause of women generally was through Conservative electoral success; thus she adamantly opposed any Conservative involvement in the Housewives' League, which she feared would detract from the party's efforts. Her policy of detachment proved sensible, for the league soon degenerated into reactionary politics before self-destructing.<br>
<br>In 1948 Maxse was a member of the party committee set up by Rab Butler to frame a &#145;women's charter&#146;: Lady Tweedsmuir and Evelyn Emmet were also members. The committee's brief was to examine all aspects of women in society, and it attacked the discrimination experienced at many levels. It also called for equal pay in at least some sectors of the economy. The committee's endeavours were warmly supported at the annual conference in 1948, though its charter was rejected: delegates preferred that the issues dealt with should be included in statements of general policy, rather than be treated as issues specific to women. But the charter did see light of day as a party document, <span class="italic">A True Balance</span>, published in March 1949 and enthusiastically endorsed at that year's women's conference.<br>
<br>In 1952, shortly after her retirement in 1951, Maxse was appointed DBE. She remained active in the work of the United Nations Association and also on behalf of the Anglican church in the diocese of Chichester. She died, unmarried, on 3 May 1975 at St George's Retreat, Ditchling, Sussex.<br>
