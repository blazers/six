<span class="headword">Bhabha, Homi Jehangir</span>  (1909&#150;1966), <span class="occ">theoretical physicist</span>, was born on 30 October 1909 at Bombay in an established Parsi family, the eldest son of Jehangir Hormusji Bhabha (1876&#150;1942) and his wife, Meheran Pandey (<i>d</i>. 1973). Bhabha's father was educated at Oxford and had studied law at Lincoln's Inn. For some years he was presidency magistrate in Bombay; later he joined Tata Sons and was associated with their scheme of hydroelectric power. Bhabha's mother came from the business family of Petit and was a granddaughter of Sir Dinshaw Maneckji Petit (1823&#150;1901), the first Indian baronet and a philanthropist. Homi Bhabha's aunt Meherbai was married to Sir Dorab Tata. Bhabha had his early education in Bombay, first at John Cannon High School and then at Elphinstone College and the Royal Institute of Science, before studying engineering in 1927 at Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, where Sir Dorab Tata had earlier spent two years and to which he had donated &pound;25,000 in 1920. Cambridge at that time was bursting with excitement over the quantum theory of elementary particles and radiation. Bhabha wrote to his father asking his permission to switch to physics from engineering, which was agreed to, subject to his obtaining a first class in the mechanical tripos, which he did in June 1930. He received the degree of PhD from Cambridge in 1934.<br>
<br>Bhabha's main research at Cambridge concerned quantum electrodynamics. The process of electron&#150;positron scattering, now called Bhabha scattering, was investigated by him in 1935 using Dirac's equation. This calculation provided evidence that negative energy electrons can indeed be identified with positrons. Bhabha and Heitler's cascade theory in 1937 explained the cosmic ray showers in terms of conversion of electron energy into quanta of radiation and their reconversion into secondary electron&#150;positron pairs. Before their work it was suspected that quantum electrodynamics might fail to account for them. It was further known that the cosmic rays also had a penetrating component. Bhabha, in a brilliant phenomenological analysis of this component, suggested the existence of heavier electrons in 1937. These particles, muons, were discovered by Anderson and Neddermyer in 1938. Yukawa had proposed in 1935 that the nuclear force can be understood as arising through an exchange of heavy particles, now called mesons, between the nucleons. Bhabha was among the earliest workers on meson theory outside Yukawa's group in Japan. The word &#145;meson&#146; was coined by Bhabha, Kemmer, and Pryce. Initially, the muons, postulated to explain the penetrating component of the cosmic rays, were thought to be the same particle as mesons. Bhabha worked on vector meson theory, with mesons obeying Proca's equation, in order to provide a better account of nuclear forces using both quantum perturbation theory and classical field theory. Bhabha was first to suggest that studying the variation of meson lifetime with velocity would provide a beautiful test of Einstein's time dilation formula.<br>
<br>Bhabha was on vacation in India in 1939 when war began in Europe. The war conditions made a return to England impossible. He therefore joined the special cosmic ray research unit, created for him by the Sir Dorabji Tata Trust, at the Indian Institute of Science at Bangalore in 1940. He was elected fellow of the Royal Society in 1941. At Bangalore he worked on classical relativistic spinning point particle theory (Bhabha&#150;Corben equations). He also initiated balloon based cosmic ray experiments. During this period he began to feel more and more committed to India and decided to dedicate himself to bringing modern science and technology to the country. Bhabha wrote to J. R. D. Tata on 19 August 1943 regarding his ideas on building strong research groups in India. On being encouraged by him, he addressed, on 12 March 1944, to Sir Sorab Saklatvala, chairman of the Sir Dorabji Tata Trust, a formal letter containing a proposal to set up a new research institute which would be comparable to the best anywhere in the world. The proposed institute, named Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, was founded by the Sir Dorabji Tata Trust and the government of Bombay. It started functioning in June 1945 at Bangalore with Bhabha as its founder director. The institute soon shifted to Bombay and was formally inaugurated on 19 December 1945. At Bombay he worked on his theory of relativistic wave equations (Bhabha wave equation) for elementary particles. Bhabha had already visualized the possibility of the Tata Institute playing a role in the development of nuclear energy. In his original proposal he wrote, &#145;Moreover, when nuclear energy has been successfully applied for power production in say a couple of decades from now, India will not have to look abroad for its experts but will find them ready at hand&#146;  (Lala, 87&#150;8). Bhabha's note to the prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, on the organization of atomic research in India, resulted in the setting up of the atomic energy commission of India in August 1948, with Bhabha as its chairman. An atomic energy establishment, later renamed the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre, was created at Trombay in January 1954, its initial trained manpower drawn from the Tata Institute. A separate department of atomic energy was created in August 1954 with Bhabha as secretary. Asia's first nuclear reactor, Apsara, became critical on 4 August 1956; nuclear grade uranium was produced in 1959; a plutonium plant was commissioned in January 1965. A power projects engineering division was created for the production of nuclear power, later known as the Nuclear Power Corporation of India. Bhabha presided with distinction over the international conference on developing peaceful uses of atomic energy organized by the United Nations and held in Geneva in 1955. Bhabha died in an air crash on Mont Blanc on 24 January 1966 on his way to a meeting of the scientific advisory committee of the International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna.<br>
<br>Bhabha was a renaissance man, equally at home in the world of science and of arts. Like his hero Leonardo da Vinci he never married. A number of his paintings were collected in a volume entitled <span class="italic">Homi Bhabha as Artist</span> (1968); some are quite remarkable, for example his surrealist painting inspired by Mozart's aria &#145;Dove sono&#146;. His many pencil sketches show a fine command of drawing. His deep interest in architecture and landscaping is reflected in the design and surroundings of the buildings of the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research and those of the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre at Trombay.<br>
