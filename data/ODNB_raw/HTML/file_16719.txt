<span class="headword">Lindsay,  William Lauder</span>  (1829&#150;1880), <span class="occ">physician and botanist</span>, was born on 19 December 1829 in Edinburgh, the eldest son of James Lindsay of the sasine office, General Register House, Edinburgh, and his wife, Helen, daughter of Captain Lauder. He was educated at the Royal High School, Edinburgh, where he was dux in 1844 and 1845. He then entered the University of Edinburgh, where he studied medicine. His interest in botany was fostered by John Hutton Balfour (1808&#150;1884), who suggested he study lichens, then greatly neglected. Although he worked as a clerk in the register house during the whole of his medical course, Lindsay obtained several university prizes, including the medal and first prizes in botany, and on graduating MD in 1852 he obtained the highest honours (three stars) for his thesis, &#145;Anatomy, morphology, and physiology of the lichens&#146;.<br>
<br>In 1854, after serving for a year as resident physician of the City Cholera Hospital, Edinburgh, and subsequently as assistant physician in the Crichton Royal Institution, Dumfries, Lindsay was appointed medical officer to Murray's Royal Institution for the Insane at Perth. There he combined geological with botanical researches, but continued to specialize in lichens, publishing, in 1856, <span class="italic">A Popular History of British Lichens</span>. The work contained numerous coloured plates, and was a readable and stimulating account of lichens, which did much to popularize the subject. For his work in this department of botany he received in 1859 the first Neill gold medal from the Royal Society of Edinburgh. In the same year, he had married, on 26 April, Elizabeth, the only daughter of William Paterson Reid, solicitor, of Demerara. They had at least one daughter.<br>
<br>In 1861&#150;2 Lindsay visited the Otago province, New Zealand, making many observations on the botany and geology of the region, collecting specimens, and later publishing many papers on his work there. He received from the New Zealand Exhibition of 1865 a silver medal in recognition of his botanical researches, which were published in 1868 as <span class="italic">Contributions to New Zealand Botany</span>. He also travelled to north Germany, Norway, and Iceland and published on the flora of those countries. In 1870 he published his important <span class="italic">Memoir on the Spermogones and Pycnides of Lichens</span>, to which is appended a list of his thirty-three contributions to lichenology, which appeared either in the <span class="italic">Journal of Microscopical Science</span> or in the transactions of the Linnean and Royal (Edinburgh) societies. Lindsay studied chemical variation in lichens and pioneered new areas of study, including the diversity of lichenicolous fungi, and conidiomata in lichens. He published profusely, illustrating his monographs and papers with his own fine anatomical drawings.<br>
<br>Besides these botanical papers Lindsay published many pamphlets on mental disease and other medical subjects, on education, and on the place of natural history in colonization. His last work, <span class="italic">Mind in the Lower Animals in Health and Disease</span> (1879), which aimed at showing the similarity of mental processes in man and the lower animals, broke new ground. Lindsay was a great and omnivorous reader, and a most energetic worker. He died at his home, 3 Hartington Gardens, Edinburgh, on 24 November 1880. He is commemorated by the fungal genus <i>Lauder lindsaya</i>.<br>
