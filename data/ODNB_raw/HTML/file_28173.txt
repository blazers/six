<span class="headword">Veitch,  John</span>  (1829&#150;1894), <span class="occ">philosopher</span>, born in Biggiesknowe, Peebles, on 24 October 1829, was the eldest and only surviving child of Sergeant James Veitch, a Peninsular War veteran, and his wife, Nancy Ritchie. Both parents, particularly the mother, held those high ideals of the value of education characteristic of some of the Scottish peasantry. Until sixteen years of age Veitch was educated successively at Mr Smith's &#145;adventure&#146; school and at the high school of Peebles. In 1845 he proceeded to Edinburgh University, where he at once gained a bursary or entrance scholarship.<br>
<br>Two years before, at the time of the Disruption, Veitch, with his parents, had joined the Free Church of Scotland, and, after one session's attendance at Edinburgh University, he entered the New College there, just instituted for the benefit of Free Church students. Here he first met Professor A. Campbell Fraser, who became his lifelong friend. The year 1848 found him back at the university, hearing the brilliant lectures of John Wilson and of Sir William Hamilton, by whom Veitch was profoundly influenced. Originally destined for the ministry of the Free Church, he turned his attention in 1850 to theology but was repelled by the dogmatic tendencies of the day. Until 1856 he supported himself by private tuition.<br>
<br>In 1856 Veitch was appointed assistant to Sir William Hamilton in the chair of logic and metaphysics in the University of Edinburgh. Hamilton's death took place in the same year, and was followed by the transference of Campbell Fraser from the professorship of philosophy in New College. Veitch continued in his position as assistant to Fraser until, in May 1860, he was elected to the chair of logic, rhetoric, and metaphysics in the University of St Andrews. During the same period he aided his chief in the editorial work of the <span class="italic">North British Review</span>. Veitch's duties at St Andrews required him to teach English literature as well as philosophy, and he began studies in the literature and antiquities of the Scottish border. At this period his friends included many remarkable men, among others James David Forbes, James Frederick Ferrier, John Tulloch, William Young Sellar, and John Campbell Shairp. On 17 June 1862 he married Eliza Hill Wilson, only daughter of George Wilson of Dalmarnock and Auchineden. They had no children.<br>
<br>In the summer of 1864 Veitch was elected to the professorship of logic and rhetoric in the University of Glasgow, which he occupied until his death. Six months of the year were thenceforth spent in Glasgow, and the remainder in Peebles, where he built a residence, The Loanings, and enjoyed unique opportunities of studying the scenery, history, literature, and lore of his native borderland. He took an active part in the leading border associations, in the politics of Peeblesshire, and in various benevolent institutions. In 1872 he received the honorary degree of LLD from Edinburgh University. He died at The Loanings on 3 September 1894 and was buried in the Old Town in Peebles. His wife survived him.<br>
<br>As a thinker Veitch was at odds with the chief movements of his day, and by adopting an extreme, and often contemptuous, attitude of criticism, he precluded himself from having a formative influence on the thousands of students who came under his care. Those of them who knew him intimately were affected by his personal character, not by his lectures. One former pupil, J. H. Muirhead, commented that &#145;Veitch's real interest was not in philosophy at all except, as with so many in these theology-ridden days, as it seemed to provide a rod with which to chastise Hume and assert the rights of uncritical belief&#146;  (Drummond and Bulloch, 228). Contemporaries judged him to be limited to the work of criticism, incapable of much original thought. His critique of idealism in <span class="italic">Knowing and Being</span> (1889), some of whose themes were continued in <span class="italic">Dualism and Monism</span> (1895), demonstrated the exhaustion of the Scottish school of philosophy, pitting a na&iuml;ve realism against the new problems posed by T. H. Green's reading of Kant and Hegel. His philosophical publications also include translations of Descartes, and memoirs of Dugald Stewart (1857) and William Hamilton (1869), both of which are strictly biographical, attempting only limited accounts of their subjects' thought. His <span class="italic">Hamilton</span> (1882) was an exhaustive statement of Hamilton's contribution to philosophy.<br>
<br>Inborn inclination, extraordinary opportunity, and rare power of observation combined in the production of Veitch's work on <span class="italic">The History and Poetry of the Scottish Border</span> (2 vols., 1893). The same qualities reveal themselves in the fine volumes on <span class="italic">The Feeling for Nature in Scottish Poetry</span> (2 vols., 1887), as well as in his three small books of verse, <span class="italic">The Tweed, and Other Poems</span> (1875), <span class="italic">Hillside Rhymes</span> (1872), and <span class="italic">Merlin and Other Poems</span> (1889). The poems are less successful than the prose works. Occasionally they reach a high level, but always within a limited range.<br>
