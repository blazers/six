<span class="headword">Elliott,  Michael Paul</span>  (1931&#150;1984), <span class="occ">theatre director</span>, was born at 4 Chester Square, Westminster, London, on 26 June 1931, the second son and third child of the Revd Wallace Harold Elliott (<i>d</i>. 1957) of Brook House, Compton, near Guildford, Surrey, and his wife, Edith Evelyn Plaistowe, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Kilburn (1895&#150;1988). His father, who was vicar of St Michael's, Chester Square, chaplain to George VI and Elizabeth II, and an honorary canon of Coventry Cathedral, was a frequent broadcaster, known for many years as the Radio Parson. Elliott was educated at St Ronan's preparatory school, Worthing, Radley College, and Keble College, Oxford, where he took a third in modern history in 1954. It was at Oxford that he first met Casper Wrede and began an artistic association that lasted until Elliott's death.<br>
<br>Elliott entered the theatre as a television director and was staff producer with BBC television drama from 1956 to 1960. During this time he co-directed several productions with Wrede and he became his associate for the 59 Theatre Company season at the Lyric Hammersmith. He made his own stage directing d&eacute;but with an acclaimed production of Ibsen's <span class="italic">Brand</span> in 1959: Elliott was an Ibsen specialist and this production, with Patrick McGoohan, had &#145;a bleak and terrible beauty in performance and decor&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>). On 25 July 1959 he married Rosalind Marie Knight (<i>b</i>. 1933), an actress, the daughter of Esmond Pennington Knight, actor; they had two daughters.<br>
<br>In 1961 Elliott directed Vanessa Redgrave in <span class="italic">As You Like It</span>, a landmark in the history of the Royal Shakespeare Company, at Stratford; the play later moved to London. The next year he directed Trevor Howard in John Mortimer's <span class="italic">Two Stars for Comfort</span> in the West End. He was appointed artistic director of the Old Vic in 1962, the last year before it became the National, and directed <span class="italic">Peer Gynt</span> with Leo McKern, <span class="italic">The Merchant of Venice</span>, and <span class="italic">Measure for Measure</span>. For five years from 1963 he worked as a freelance: notable productions included <span class="italic">Little Eyolf</span> at the 1963 Edinburgh Festival, and Strindberg's <span class="italic">Miss Julie</span> (1966), with Maggie Smith and Albert Finney, at the National. This phase came to an end when, having turned down the offer to become Olivier's heir apparent at the National, as well as the posts of artistic director of the Royal Court and head of BBC drama, he opted to move to Manchester to form a group theatre, the 69 Theatre Company, with Casper Wrede, James Maxwell, Richard Negri, and Braham Murray.<br>
<br>Elliott first went to Manchester in 1967 to direct Tom Courtenay in <span class="italic">The Playboy of the Western World</span>, for Braham Murray's Century Theatre. In the following year he directed one of the 69 Theatre Company's opening productions there, <span class="italic">When we Dead Awaken</span>, with Wendy Hiller. Subsequently he directed <span class="italic">Daniel Deronda</span> with Vanessa Redgrave (1969); <span class="italic">The Tempest</span>; <span class="italic">Peer Gynt</span> with Tom Courtenay (1970); <span class="italic">The Family Reunion</span>; and, in Manchester Cathedral, <span class="italic">The Cocktail Party</span>.<br>
<br>After two extraordinary years at the small university theatre the 69 Theatre Company was invited by Manchester city council to build a new theatre. Elliott was a student of theatre form, especially through his researches into Greek theatre, and together with Negri, the designer, and Wrede, he created an extraordinary space-module theatre-in-the-round in the old Cotton Exchange in Manchester city centre. Like his colleagues he rejected the proscenium arch, the decadent Roman form, and fashioned an auditorium in direct descent from the Greek and Elizabethan forms. In his words: &#145;Why are we in the round? Because we believe that theatre is a happening and that what happens among people has more effect than what happens the other side of a peep hole&#146;.<br>
<br>The Royal Exchange Theatre opened in 1976, and Elliott helped to establish its traditions, with an emphasis on the actors being the magnetic point of the 250 people working in the building. He was a founding artistic director of the Royal Exchange Theatre Company and in its first season directed Albert Finney and Leo McKern in <span class="italic">Uncle Vanya</span> (1977). Three of his later productions&#151;<span class="italic">The Ordeal of Gilbert Pinfold</span> (1977) with Michael Hordern, <span class="italic">The Lady from the Sea</span> (1978) with Vanessa Redgrave, and <span class="italic">The Family Reunion</span> (1979) with Edward Fox&#151;transferred to London, while <span class="italic">Crime and Punishment</span> (1978) was seen in Germany, and <span class="italic">The Dresser</span> went on to New York in 1981 after its West End success the previous year. His final productions were <span class="italic">Philoctetes</span> (1982); Ronald Harwood's <span class="italic">After the Lions</span> (1982); and at Christmas 1983 his own adaptation of <span class="italic">Moby Dick</span>.<br>
<br>Elliott also produced two operas, both world premi&egrave;res by Gordon Crosse: <span class="italic">The Story of Vasco</span> for the English National Opera at the London Coliseum, and <span class="italic">Potter Thompson</span> at the Aldeburgh Festival. He was responsible for more than fifty major television productions in Britain, and several in Norway and Sweden, and directed the CBS coast-to-coast spectacular of <span class="italic">The Glass Menagerie</span> in New York in 1964. His memorable BBC plays included <span class="italic">Antigone</span> with Dorothy Tutin, <span class="italic">Time Remembered</span> with Edith Evans, <span class="italic">The Lower Depths</span>, <span class="italic">The Cherry Orchard</span> with John Gielgud and Peggy Ashcroft, and <span class="italic">Ghosts</span> with Tom Courtenay, Celia Johnson, and Donald Wolfit. His last television production was the award-winning <span class="italic">King Lear</span> with Laurence Olivier for Granada Television.<br>
<br>Elliott was a member of the Arts Council drama panel from 1963 to 1970, and a member of the Arts Council from 1972 to 1975. He served on the advisory council of the BBC, was a member of the board of governors for the Central School of Speech and Drama, and from 1963 to 1966 sat on the building committee for the National Theatre, where he was &#145;perhaps the coolest mind &hellip; very practical and impatient with dogma&#146;  (Elsom and Tomalin, 174). He was appointed OBE in 1980. He died on 30 May 1984 at the Royal Infirmary, Manchester, and was buried on 5 June at the southern cemetery, Barlow Moor Road, Manchester. He was survived by his wife and two daughters.<br>
<br>Michael Elliott was one of the most admired directors of his day. He combined a daunting intelligence and passionate intensity with breathtaking natural stagecraft. One leading critic said that he was the only director for whom nobody had a bad word. His fierce integrity led him into a counter-movement against the pessimism and nihilism of the established theatre. By selflessly leaving a glittering career in London to break the old pattern of assumption that first-rate theatre could not be created in the provinces, he pioneered the concept of regional theatres of national standards which would later be taken for granted. His legacy lived on with all those who worked with him, and with the new artistic directors at the Royal Exchange, who included his daughter Marianne.<br>
