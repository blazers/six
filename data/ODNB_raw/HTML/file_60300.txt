<span class="headword">Burden,  Harold Nelson</span>  (1860&#150;1930), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and health administrator</span>, was born on 20 March 1860 at Hythe, Kent, the eldest of the three children of Thomas Burden (1829&#150;1872), a grocer, and his wife, Sarah Ann (Sally) Munk (<i>c</i>.1833&#150;1902). When he was twelve his father died, and he was probably brought up by his grandparents, who were farmers. Unfortunately he was not successful as a grazier and dairyman and was declared bankrupt in 1886. He then worked in the slums of the East End of London, where he met his first wife, Katherine Mary Garton (<i>c</i>.1854&#150;1919), the daughter of Henry Garton, a tobacco manufacturer of Hull; she was a niece of the wife of George Huntington, rector of Tenby, and had worked with Octavia Hill, who praised her. They married on 26 September 1888 after Burden was ordained deacon in the Church of England; they then emigrated to Ontario, where they were missionaries for three years. Here their two children were born and died. Burden was ordained priest in 1891.<br>
<br>The Burdens returned on account of Harold's ill health and spent time in Shoreditch and Cambridge, where he wrote a well-received book on his missionary work, <span class="italic">Life in Algoma, or, Three Years of a Clergyman's Life and Church Work in that Diocese</span> (1894). This was followed by <span class="italic">Manitoulin, or, Five years of church work among Ojibway indians and lumbermen resident upon that island or its vicinity</span> (1895). In 1896 a novel and a set of sermons for &#145;busy clerics&#146;, <span class="italic">Duty's Call</span> and <span class="italic">Addresses on St Matthew's Gospel</span>, were published. At Cambridge, where he matriculated in Lent 1893 and served as chaplain of St Catharine's College (1893&#150;5), Burden gained his English licence to be a priest. He also became a member of the Barbers' Company and a freeman of the City of London. From 1924 to 1926 he served as master of the Barbers' Company.<br>
<br>Burden moved to Bristol in 1895 as secretary of the Church of England Temperance Society. With local support, he and his wife created a retreat for female &#145;habitual drunkards&#146;, the Royal Victoria Home, and later the first &#145;inebriate reformatory&#146;, the Brentry extension of the home. In 1902 they formed the National Institutions for Inebriates and two years later its 600 beds constituted two-thirds of the places in English establishments of that type. Because of this, and his good relationships with the Home Office, he was appointed to the royal commission on the care and control of the feeble-minded (1904&#150;8).<br>
<br>From his experience on the commission, Burden set up Sandwell Hall, Birmingham, in 1906. This was the first industrial school for &#145;feeble-minded&#146; children, and in 1909 he established another, at Stoke Park, Bristol. Partly on account of the low cost of his &#145;inebriate reformatories&#146;, the Treasury reduced its subsidy for these bodies in 1907, triggering the collapse of such institutions nationally. As a result the Burdens changed their reformatories into &#145;mental deficiency colonies&#146;. Later they concentrated their efforts at Stoke Park and at Whittington, Chesterfield, operating the National Institutions for Persons Requiring Care and Control (NIPRCC).<br>
<br>Katherine Burden died in 1919, and on 12 May 1920 Burden married the superintendent of the Stoke Park colony, Rosa Gladys Williams (<i>c</i>.1873&#150;1939), the daughter of the Revd John Williams. At the time of Katherine's death the incorporation of the NIPRCC operated more than 2000 of the 7000 beds in licensed institutions for mentally handicapped people in England. Burden's other innovation was the creation, just before his death, of the Burden Mental Research Institute (1929). He died on 15 May 1930 at his home, Clevedon Hall, Clevedon, Somerset, and was buried on 20 May at Clevedon parish church. His second wife in turn founded the Burden Neurological Institute in 1939. After their deaths the NIPRCC became the Burden Trust.<br>
<br>Harold Burden did well financially from running the institutions he created, leaving an estate of almost &pound;150,000&#151;although exactly how he managed to amass this wealth remains obscure. Although he engaged committees of the great and good to help him, Burden appears to have worked poorly with others and was autocratic. However, he undoubtedly benefited from the drive and support of his first wife. He was privately criticized by the Board of Education and fell out with several of the board's commissioners over the running of his establishments. Nevertheless, he created some of the first institutions to deal with alcoholism (as advocated by the temperance movement) and with mental handicaps (as proposed in the <span class="roman">Mental Deficiency Act</span> of 1913).<br>
