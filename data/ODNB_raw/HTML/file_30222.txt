<span class="headword">Yonge,  Charles Duke</span>  (1812&#150;1891), <span class="occ">classical scholar and historian</span>, was born at Eton College on 30 November 1812, the eldest son of the Revd Charles Yonge (1781&#150;1830), Eton schoolmaster, and Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1868), daughter of Joseph Lord of Pembroke; his parents had married on 4 December 1810. Yonge's father's family were Devon gentry with a seat at Puslinch, near Coombe, and their most famous ancestor was James Yonge FRS (1647&#150;1721), the naval surgeon and medical writer. In 1746 the Revd John Yonge, his great-grandfather, had married Elizabeth Duke, a coheir to property at Otterton in Devon. Yonge was educated at Eton College (<i>c</i>.1823&#150;<i>c</i>.1829) and entered King's College, Cambridge, on 24 February 1831. He left the college exactly three years later, following the rejection of his case for a fellowship, and was admitted to St Mary's Hall, Oxford, on 17 May 1834. There he acquired a cricket blue and graduated BA with a first-class honours in classics in December 1835; he proceeded MA in 1874.<br>
<br>Until 1866, when he was appointed by the crown to the chair of English literature and history at Queen's College, Belfast, Yonge lived principally in London and worked as a private tutor and a writer. On 15 August 1837 he married Anne, daughter of J. V. Bethell of Hereford, but little is known about his personal circumstances other than that the marriage was childless, and that he was a close friend of an influential kinsman, Sir John Taylor Coleridge, the editor of Blackstone's <span class="italic">Commentaries</span> and a justice of the king's bench 1835&#150;58. However, by the time of his appointment at Queen's, Yonge had established a reputation as a prolific classicist and historian. Between 1842 and 1855 he translated eight classical works that were published in Bohn's series of antiquarian, classical, and ecclesiastical texts and was the author of a profusion of exercises in Greek and Latin composition. The first of his principal historical works, <span class="italic">A History of England from the Earliest Times to the Peace of Paris</span>, was published in 1857 and merited a further edition in 1871. Five other major works appeared in the next ten years: <span class="italic">Parallel lives of ancient and modern heroes, of Epaminondas and Gustavus Adolphus, Philip of Macedon and Frederick the Great</span> (1858); <span class="italic">Life of Field Marshall, the Duke of Wellington</span> (2 vols., 1860), which was reissued as a single volume in 1891; <span class="italic">A History of the British Navy from the Earliest Period to the Present Time</span> (1863); an edited and revised version of <span class="italic">Taylor's Students' Manual of Modern History</span> (1866); and <span class="italic">History of France under the Bourbons</span> (1866). By the time he was appointed to Queen's he was already at work on the three-volume <span class="italic">Life and Administration of Robert Banks, Second Earl of Liverpool</span>, which was published in 1868.<br>
<br>Yonge's professorial duties did not lead to any significant decline in the quantity of publication. His teaching consisted principally of ten lectures each week in the first and second terms&#151;usually six in English language and literature and the rest in history. Four notebooks of his lectures survive&#151;one each for English language, English literature, English (and some Irish) history, and French history&#151;and these suggest that he relied upon his first texts for the remainder of his career. He also supervised essays, one of the first that he set being entitled &#145;The usefulness or mischief of ambition&#146;. Although he became one of the inner circle of professors who advised the president of the college and at one stage had pretensions to become president himself, there is no evidence that administrative ambitions on his own behalf ever detracted significantly from his teaching and writing. With an average income of about &pound;420, he and his wife lived comfortably&#151;at one stage in Notting Hill in the leafy suburb to the south of the college&#151;and he continued to publish. Some of his works, such as his edition of Goldsmith's essays (1882), probably grew out of his teaching of English but the majority were historical. Apart from the life of Lord Liverpool, the most important were a history of the English revolution of 1688 (1874), a two-volume life of Marie Antoinette (1876), which merited two further editions; and <span class="italic">The Constitutional History of England from 1760 to 1860</span> (1881), which was designed as a continuation of Hallam's <span class="italic">History</span>. It is a mark of Yonge's dedication as a scholar that he continued as professor and author until his death at his home, 12 Elmwood Avenue, Belfast, on 30 November 1891, the day of his seventy-ninth birthday. His two-volume edition of Horace Walpole's letters had been published the year before; and two further works&#151;one on military commanders and another on Dryden&#151;appeared in 1892. This brought his total number of separate publications to fifty. He was buried in Drumbeg churchyard, near Belfast.<br>
<br>Yonge probably had more lasting influence as a classicist than as either a literary or political historian. His translations and exercises appear to have been widely used in universities and schools. But his histories, although some sold well, had little impact on the historical profession. One reason for this is that his principal concern&#151;to explore the origins and evolution of Britain's liberal constitution and her status as a great power&#151;became increasingly outmoded. He began his enquiries along these lines in the <span class="italic">History of England</span> and most of his subsequent work was devoted to assessing the contributions of different &#145;commanders, or legislators, or statesmen&#146;. In the case of politicians, for example, his thesis for the period after 1760 is that most of the leading figures had made a contribution to the evolution of a liberal constitution as a result of &#145;honest and patriotic&#146; motives inspired by their education, an argument which he developed in his studies of Wellington and Liverpool. However, his books were published at a time when a younger generation of historians such as Leckey, Froude, Stubbs, and Freeman were subjecting the triumphalism of &#145;whig history&#146; such as Yonge's to searching scrutiny. His work therefore received little notice from his peers in the periodicals and journals, and it is significant that he was not elected a fellow of the Royal Historical Society.<br>
<br>Another reason for the neglect of Yonge's historical works is that there was nothing exceptional in his research methods or his style of writing. He relied primarily on printed sources and wrote with a measured elegance that has the effect of draining the life from a subject. Although few of his books received detailed reviews, one of his life of Lord Liverpool which appeared in the <span class="italic">Quarterly Review</span> (1869) concludes with an assessment that might be applied fairly to all of his work:<blockquote>His style is not very lively; his research is not very deep; nor does he convey the impression that when undertaking the life of Lord Liverpool he could not with equal readiness have undertaken the life of Confucius. But he deserves praise for the simplicity of his language, the directness of his method, and the moderation of his opinions. (<span class="italic">QR</span>, 206)</blockquote>
