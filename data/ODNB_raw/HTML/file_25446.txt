<span class="headword">Shirreffs <span class="st"> [Shirrefs]</span>,  Andrew</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1762, <em>d.</em> 1807?), <span class="occ">poet</span>, was baptized in Aberdeen on 9 February 1762, the son of David Shirreffs, carpenter, and his wife, Ann Lunan. Two of his brothers attained some distinction in Aberdeen. James was minister of St Nicholas's Church from 1778 to 1814, and Alexander was sheriff-clerk-depute and latterly president of the Society of Advocates. Andrew Shirreffs was educated at the grammar school, entered Marischal College in 1779, and graduated MA in 1783. He lost both legs and consequently abandoned the intention of following a learned profession, and began business in Aberdeen as a bookseller and bookbinder.<br>
<br>Shirreffs corresponded with John Skinner and James Beattie. Burns in the notes of his northern tour mentions having seen him, and describes him as &#145;a little decrepid body with some abilities&#146;. He was best-known as the author of <span class="italic">Jamie and Bess</span>, a pastoral five-act comedy, written avowedly in imitation of Ramsay's <span class="italic">Gentle Shepherd</span>. It was performed in Aberdeen in 1787, and in Edinburgh, for the author's benefit, in 1796, where he appeared and sang his own song, &#145;A Cogie o'yill and a pickle Aitmeal&#146;. In May 1787 he joined with others in starting the short-lived <span class="italic">Aberdeen Chronicle</span> (not to be confused with the paper of the same name started in 1806), and became proprietor and joint editor of the <span class="italic">Caledonian Magazine</span>. The latter ceased in 1790, and he went to Edinburgh as a bookseller and printer. Inglis mentions a short piece, <span class="italic">The Sons of Britannia</span>, said to have been acted in Edinburgh in 1796, but it does not seem to have been printed. In 1790 Shirreffs published in Edinburgh <span class="italic">Poems, Chiefly in the Scottish Dialect</span>.<br>
<br>In 1798 Shirreffs left for London, after which it is impossible to trace him. The date of his death is given as 1807, but this cannot be confirmed; and from his not appearing with his brothers in the will of his first cousin Alexander, a Jamaica planter, who died in 1801, it might be inferred that he was dead before that date. His dramatic and poetic works were reprinted in 1996.<br>
