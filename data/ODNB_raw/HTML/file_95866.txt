<span class="headword">Whyte,  James Aitken</span>  (1920&#150;2005), <span class="occ">Church of Scotland minister</span>, was born at 15 Pitt Street, Leith, on 28 January 1920, the second son of Andrew Whyte, produce broker, and his wife, Barbara Janet Pittillo, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Aitken. He was educated at Daniel Stewart's College, Edinburgh, and Edinburgh University, gaining first-class honours in philosophy in 1942. On 4 July the same year, at Greyfriars Church, Edinburgh, he married Elisabeth Wilson Mill (<i>d</i>. 1988), a 21-year-old schoolteacher, and daughter of George Scott Mill, Church of Scotland minister and missionary in India. They had two sons and one daughter. Whyte remained at Edinburgh to train for ministry in the Church of Scotland, and was ordained in 1945. He served as a chaplain to the forces until in 1948 he was called to be minister of Dunollie Road Church in Oban, where he served until 1954. From 1954 to 1958 he was minister of Mayfield North Church in Edinburgh. He was then, until his retirement in 1987, professor of practical theology and Christian ethics at the University of St Andrews, where he also served terms as dean of the faculty of divinity (1968&#150;72) and principal of St Mary's College (1978&#150;82). He served on many church committees, and in 1988&#150;9 he was moderator of the general assembly of the Church of Scotland.<br>
<br>As an academic Whyte built up a reputation as a dynamic teacher who was passionately committed to the Scottish tradition that the university is the proper place to educate and form ministers. He published little, even in the area of his most serious theological inquiry&#151;the design and ordering of church buildings according to the Reformed tradition. He published two books of sermons, <span class="italic">Laughter and Tears: Thoughts on Faith in Face of Suffering</span> (1993) and <span class="italic">The Dream and the Grace: Sermons on Healthy and Unhealthy Religion</span> (2001). In the former was printed the remarkable sermon he delivered in 1989 at the memorial service for the victims of the Lockerbie air disaster the previous year. Whyte was himself grieving the recent death of his first wife, Elisabeth, and was able to grapple honestly and effectively with the grief and pain and anger that those involved, and many others as well, suffered. Addressing those who sought vengeance, Whyte declared, &#145;Justice yes, retaliation no. For if we move in the way of retaliation we move right outside of the fellowship of Christ's sufferings, outside of the divine consolation. There is nothing that way but bitterness and the destruction of our own humanity&#146;  (p. 94). These words reverberated around the world, and may have helped to inhibit hasty armed reactions. Among the memorable sermons in Whyte's second volume was that preached at the memorial service for the sixteen pupils and their teacher who were killed by Thomas Hamilton in their primary school in Dunblane in 1996.<br>
<br>As moderator Whyte presided over the general assembly when the prime minister, Margaret Thatcher, addressed the assembly, claiming rather stridently that the policies of her government were based on Christian truths. She was received politely but suspiciously by the assembly, and at the end of her address the moderator distanced himself, and by implication, the church, from her message by giving her two books produced in the Scottish church&#151;a study of housing especially for poor people, and a study of the Christian principles that should inform the distribution of wealth, income, and benefits in a decent society.<br>
<br>In an earlier general assembly, in 1984, Whyte had also played a major role. Two men who had been in prison for serious offences, embezzlement and murder, had felt a call to the ministry in the Church of Scotland, and now asked the church to test their call. This, understandably, aroused a great deal of controversy in the church, and the matter was taken to the assembly, where a vigorous debate ensued. The opponents of allowing the two men to be ordained claimed that if this were done the moral standing and the respectability of the whole church would be undermined. The debate seemed to be going strongly in the direction of denying the possibility of ordination to the two petitioners when Whyte rose and in a remarkable and moving speech declared that the real issue was whether the church really believed in the forgiveness of sins. This speech swung the assembly, and the two men were allowed to proceed to ordination. An Edinburgh prison chaplain reported that a few days after this assembly decision a prisoner who was an elder of the kirk came to him in tears and said that his wife had visited him and told him that last Sunday she had gone to church for the first time since his conviction because, she said, &#145;I now realise that the Church believes in the forgiveness of sins&#146;  (private information).<br>
<br>James Whyte was the very epitome of the practical theologian, deeply involved simultaneously in the work of the church and the academy, and covering in his lectures a wide field of pastoral care and counselling, and a range of ethical topics, as well as liturgy and homiletics. In his theology and his practice he was strongly Presbyterian, and although he devoted much energy to inter-church issues, he became increasingly suspicious of the ecumenical movement, and in particular of any proposals for reconciliation or unity with Episcopalians. He was made an honorary LLD of Dundee University in 1981, an honorary DD of St Andrews in 1989, and an honorary DUniv of Stirling in 1994. On 26 June 1993, at St Leonard's Chapel, St Andrews, he married his second wife, Ishbel Christina Rathie, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Macaulay (<i>b</i>. 1925), a former schoolteacher, widow of William Rathie, and daughter of Alexander Macaulay, schoolteacher. He died at his home, 13 Hope Street, St Andrews, on 17 June 2005, of cancer, and was survived by his wife and the three children of his first marriage.<br>
