<span class="headword">Mayhew,  Arthur Innes</span>  (1878&#150;1948), <span class="occ">educationist</span>, was born at 18 Bradmore Road, Oxford, on 27 September 1878, the third son and sixth in the family of seven children of the Revd Anthony Lawson Mayhew (1842&#150;1916), chaplain of Wadham College, Oxford, and a noted lexicographer of the English language, and his wife, Jane Innes (1843&#150;1915), the daughter of John Griffen, a doctor in Banbury. He attended the Oxford preparatory school (1888&#150;91) before winning an open scholarship to Winchester College in 1891. Six years later he won a further scholarship to New College, Oxford, from where he graduated in 1901 with firsts in classical moderations and <i>literae humaniores</i>. By his own admission he was fascinated by Plato's insistence on the state's responsibility for the education of its citizens and this eventually led him, after travel in Europe, Ceylon, and Burma, to join the &eacute;lite Indian education service in 1903. He was to spend almost twenty years in India, during which time he met his future wife, raised a family of three children, and achieved high office in the educational bureaucracy.<br>
<br>Mayhew's first appointment was as a school inspector in Madras. Within four years he was deputy director of public instruction and two years later inspector of European and teacher-training schools. In 1909 his career took an unusual turn when he was seconded for two years as the educational adviser to the nizam of Hyderabad. In 1914, at the age of thirty-six, he was appointed acting director, and two years later director, of public instruction in the Central Provinces. As acting director he presided over a committee whose report subsequently led to the establishment of Nagpur University. In 1919 he was made CIE for his services to Indian education. Prior to his departure from India in 1922 he also presided briefly over the newly created central advisory Board of Education.<br>
<br>In September 1908 Mayhew married May Catherine (1882&#150;1954), the daughter of Sir James Davies, a judge of the high court of Madras. They had two sons and a daughter. Mayhew left India partly for family and health reasons but also because he was opposed to the transfer of education to local Indian control in 1921. He feared that this would lead to increasing political interference, especially in universities, with appointments being made in return for political favours and a further decline in already dubious academic standards.<br>
<br>Upon his return to England Mayhew taught classics at Eton College and wrote two books, <span class="italic">The Education of India</span> (1926) and <span class="italic">Christianity and the Government of India</span> (1929), which established him as a leading scholar on British rule in India. By the late 1920s he was seeking a new career opening; he was selected in 1929 as one of the two joint secretaries of the revamped and enlarged Colonial Office advisory committee on education in the colonies.<br>
<br>Mayhew was fifty years old when he started sharing an office with Hanns Vischer, the other joint secretary, at 2 Richmond Terrace, situated on the southern side of Whitehall, London. During the next ten years he travelled widely. In 1931 he visited the West Indies and, together with F. C. Marriott, wrote a report on education in Trinidad, Barbados, and the Leeward and Windward islands. In 1932 he visited the Gold Coast as a member of the first inspection team of Achimota College. He attended two major overseas conferences on colonial education, at Yale (1934) and Hawaii (1936), and thereafter visited Fiji to prepare a report on education (1937). Throughout the 1930s he was also known personally to dozens of officers in the colonial education service; he edited <span class="italic">Oversea Education</span>, a successful journal about colonial education; he was closely involved in the ever expanding activities of the advisory committee; he lectured on British education policy in India and the colonies at the London Institute of Education; and he also wrote a third book, <span class="italic">Education in the Colonial Empire</span> (1938), which established his reputation as the leading authority on the subject. His experience in India had made him acutely aware of the practical problems which confronted men and women working in schools in tropical Africa and elsewhere and enabled him to empathize with teachers and administrators.<br>
<br>Mayhew's was the major voice on colonial education in Whitehall in the 1930s, and his advice was always sought. His successor at the Colonial Office, Sir Christopher Cox, spoke of his selfless character, his unassuming and modest, but far from diffident, personality, and his depth of knowledge, sanity, clarity, and accuracy, to which he sometimes added irony and a salty wit  (TNA: PRO, CO 1045/1483). As an educationist he was highly critical of British education policy in India. He recognized the value of Western knowledge and the English language in helping India and the colonial empire to relate to the modern world but he was equally insistent that the education system of any country must be closely linked to its own unique history and culture. Throughout his life he retained strong Anglican beliefs derived from his family background and these helped him to win the trust and respect of the Christian missions; his close and friendly links with protestant missions raised his influence within the Colonial Office. He was made a CMG in 1936.<br>
<br>The onset of war in 1939 gave Mayhew few opportunities to enjoy retirement. He continued to edit <span class="italic">Oversea Education</span> until 1946 and remained an active member of the advisory committee on education in the colonies besides doing war-work of a non-educational kind in Whitehall. He was also a member of the council of Radley College, and in 1940 he wrote a series of articles for the <span class="italic">Times Educational Supplement</span> entitled &#145;Educating the colonies&#146;. He died unexpectedly in his sleep at his home, Normanhurst, Slough Road, Datchet, Buckinghamshire, on 16 March 1948, and was cremated on 18 March at Woking.<br>
<br>Mayhew's career epitomized the Platonic ideal of the guardians that so interested him as a student at Oxford at the turn of the century. He never consciously sought the limelight&#151;he remained a relatively obscure figure in British colonial education&#151;and his outstanding intellect was best suited to those behind-the-scenes activities traditionally associated with the drafting of memoranda and official correspondence, but, as Cox suggested, there was also a warm human side to his personality. W. E. F. Ward wrote soon after his death:<blockquote>There are probably many of us in the Colonial Education Service to whom for many years the Colonial Office meant simply Arthur Mayhew. In our timidity we never ventured to approach the frowning portals of Downing Street; but on the other side of the Cenotaph, in the sunny seclusion of Richmond Terrace, we were sure to find a ready welcome from a professional colleague. Mayhew was a man of two worlds: a man of Kipling's India and, though he never served in the Colonies, a man of the Colonial Empire. (Ward, 755)</blockquote>
