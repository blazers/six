<span class="headword">Althans,  (Andrew) Henry</span>  (1784&#150;1855), <span class="occ">educationist</span>, was born on 22 October 1784 at Whitechapel in the East End of London. He was the eldest son of Frederick Charles Althans, a corn factor, and his second wife, Margaretta Magdalen Jasper (1752&#150;1789), who was partly of German origin. His mother's piety was commemorated by the posthumous publication of her papers, <span class="italic">The Christian Character Exemplified</span> (1791). After attending a boarding-school at Greenwich run by John Bitterman, he conducted a business as a corn factor in London, having premises at Tower Hill from 1822 until his death. He probably married before 1805, but no details of his wife are known.<br>
<br>Like his mother, who died when he was a child, Althans was devout; in 1811 he became a Sunday school teacher at the Sion Congregational Chapel in Whitechapel, and a little later he opened a school for pauper children near the Tower of London. When this school was forced to close he transferred his efforts to a Sunday school at Bethnal Green. In 1814 he helped to establish the east London auxiliary of the Sunday School Union, remaining a leading committee member for many years and editing tracts and magazines. In 1831, when Henry Dunn became secretary of the British and Foreign School Society, with its headquarters in Southwark, Althans was appointed half-time agent and inspector for the society's metropolitan schools within 12 miles of central London, at a salary of &pound;80 a year. As he informed the parliamentary select committee on the state of education in 1834, it was his duty to visit schools &#145;unexpectedly&#146; and keep in touch with teachers and committee members. His 1837 report on the Borough Road model school at Southwark contained a detailed description of the monitorial system and was the most informative account of Borough Road since Joseph Lancaster's day.<br>
<br>In 1838, Althans gave evidence to the select committee on education of the poorer classes. He also wrote two reports on education in London, one on Whitechapel and the East End, and one on the south London parishes. He played a prominent part in the opening of the Abbey Street British day schools at Bethnal Green in 1840, becoming superintendent of the Sunday school section. A strong supporter of the monitorial system and of scriptural education, he was opposed to free education for the children of the poor, believing it would be little valued. On his retirement in 1854, he was presented with a portrait of himself which was later engraved in his memorial testimonial. Little is known about his family life: several of his sons worked as clerks at their father's corn factor business in George Street, Tower Hill; one of them, John (<i>d</i>. 1882), was prominent in the Religious Tract Society. Althans died from hepatitis at his home, 12 Great Cambridge Street, Shoreditch, on 4 March 1855 and was interred at Abney Park cemetery, Stoke Newington.<br>
