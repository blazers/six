<span class="headword">Fitzgerald,  Maurice</span>  (<em>c.</em>1194&#150;1257), <span class="occ">justiciar of Ireland</span>, was the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9552/', "Gerald fitz Maurice Fitzgerald (d. 1204)")</script>, who obtained half of the cantred of Offelan, centred on Maynooth and Rathmore, from his brother William (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1199) before 1189, owned land at Croom in Limerick and Imokilly in Cork, and before 1189 held Offaly as its first lord with centres at Lea and Geashill. Gerald fitz Maurice acquired Offaly through his marriage to Eva, daughter of the first grantee of the area, Robert of Bermingham, and Maurice Fitzgerald was the child of this marriage, which took place in or shortly before 1193. On his father's death in 1204 Maurice was a minor of about nine years of age. He and his lands were placed in the wardship of William (I) Marshal, who in 1207&#150;8 successfully resisted King John's attempts to take them from him. Maurice came of age in 1215 and in the following year his Irish lands, with the exception of those in Offaly, were delivered to him. On Gerald fitz Maurice's death his widow had married Geoffrey fitz Robert and then, after 1211, Geoffrey de Marisco with whom she had several children. The lands in Offaly were Eva's inheritance and they went with her to Marisco, who was entitled to hold them for his life, even after Eva died about 1225.<br>
<br>In 1234 Marisco lost his Irish lands for supporting Richard Marshal, who was mortally wounded on the Curragh on 1 April that year. Fitzgerald had been appointed justiciar in 1232, replacing Richard de Burgh, who shared temporarily in the downfall in that year of his uncle Hubert de Burgh. He led the force which confronted Richard Marshal on the Curragh and was subsequently rewarded by regaining Lea and Geashill from Marisco. It was recorded in the local chronicle that Richard was murdered &#145;by the Geraldines, holding the place and taking the part of the king&#146;  (<span class="italic">Annals of Ireland</span>, ed. Butler, 7). Fitzgerald was summoned to England after Marshal's death but no action was taken against him. In the following year, however, his messenger, Henry Clement, was murdered by William de Marisco who had been with Marshal on the Curragh. Fitzgerald suspected the involvement of Richard's brother and successor, Gilbert Marshal (<i>d</i>. 1241), and relations between the two men were cool.<br>
<br>The conquest of Connacht in 1235 provided the opportunity to heal the rifts among the English magnates in Ireland caused by the murder of Marshal. In that year the settlers gathered under Fitzgerald to make good Richard de Burgh's claim to the province. From Athlone they travelled north to Boyle in Roscommon, but failed to encounter Fedlimid &Oacute; Conchobhair, who soon fled to &Oacute; Domnaill for protection. The invaders then attacked the islands of Clew Bay before besieging and capturing temporarily the island of Loch C&eacute;, which belonged to the Mac Diarmada family. Fedlimid came to terms and agreed to hold the king's five cantreds in Connacht as a tenant of the crown, but in 1236 Fitzgerald banished him and replaced him with a rival. Fedlimid soon returned to contest the situation and with the support of Richard de Burgh eventually re-established his position in 1237.<br>
<br>In 1235 Richard de Burgh granted Sligo to Hugh de Lacy. He in turn granted a large part of this, namely Carbury and the northern half of the barony of Leyny, to Fitzgerald who acquired the other half of Leyny from Jordan d'Exeter, another of de Burgh's grantees. In 1238 Fitzgerald and Hugh de Lacy ousted Domnall Mac Lochlainn, king of Cen&eacute;l n&Eacute;ogain and as a reward Lacy granted Fitzgerald his claims as earl of Ulster on T&iacute;r Conaill and Fermanagh. In 1239 Fitzgerald plundered Carbury, which at this period was subject to &Oacute; Domnaill. In 1242 he entered T&iacute;r Conaill with Fedlimid &Oacute; Conchobhair and took the submission of the local families. Thereafter he built castles at Banada and Ardcree in Leyny and in 1245 built the castle of Sligo, again with the assistance of Fedlimid. In 1253 he founded a Dominican friary in the town. After losing the justiciarship in 1245 he continued to raid into T&iacute;r Conaill, taking hostages and setting up kings. In 1252 he built the castle of Caol Uisce, which was destroyed by &Oacute; Domnaill in 1257. Sligo was burnt at the same time. This effectively saw the end of the English thrust into the north-west.<br>
<br>Fitzgerald gained land elsewhere in Connacht after 1235. Richard de Burgh granted him land in the baronies of Dunkellin and Kiltartan in Galway and he established manorial centres at Ardrahan and Kilcolgan. The territory had previously belonged to the family of &Oacute; h&Eacute;idhin and they were allowed to retain some of their former land as Fitzgerald's tenants. In Mayo, Fitzgerald received land in the barony of Kilmaine from Gerald de la Roche and Raymond fitz Griffin. Here he established the manor of Lough Mask where he also built a castle.<br>
<br>Henry III had confidence in Fitzgerald's ability, as justiciar, to raise money for his enterprises. In 1240 the king ordered him to prepare for a royal visit to Ireland which was subsequently cancelled, and in 1242&#150;3 he complied with Henry's demands for men, money, and supplies from Ireland for his French campaign. In 1245 Fitzgerald was entrusted with the task of organizing a force from Ireland for Henry III's campaign against Dafydd ap Llywelyn in Wales. He gathered upwards of 3000 men, including Fedlimid &Oacute; Conchobhair and many other Irish. This force arrived at Gannock (Deganwy) late in October, by which time the king was preparing to return home and the force from Ireland ravaged the island of Anglesey. Fitzgerald's punishment for arriving late was to be replaced as justiciar by John fitz Geoffrey in 1245. He was not disgraced, however, and in August 1248 was in Gascony at the king's bidding. In 1249 he and fitz Geoffrey punished &Aacute;ed, son of Fedlimid, for an attack on the Berminghams and replaced Fedlimid with a rival &Oacute; Conchobhair. Fitzgerald had founded a Franciscan friary at Youghal, Cork, in 1224 or 1231 and he died there, in the habit of a Franciscan, in 1257.<br>
<br>Nothing is known of Fitzgerald's wife except her first name, Juliana. Their eldest son was Gerald fitz Maurice Fitzgerald, who died in Poitou in 1242/3. He in turn had a son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9575/', "Maurice Fitzgerald (d. 1268)")</script>, who succeeded his grandfather as third lord of Offaly upon reaching his majority, some time before 1262. He was drowned in 1268 while crossing from England. Gerald fitz Maurice Fitzgerald also had a daughter, Juliana, who married John de Cogan. The second son of Maurice Fitzgerald and Juliana was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9577/', "Maurice fitz Maurice Fitzgerald (d. 1286)")</script>. He acquired the T&iacute;r Conaill, Fermanagh, and Connacht lands by feoffment from his father and served as justiciar in 1272&#150;3. About 1258 he married Matilda (Maud), the widow of Maurice de Rochford and daughter of Gerald de Prendergast. The third son of Maurice Fitzgerald and Juliana, Thomas fitz Maurice Fitzgerald, was given Banada in Leyny, Sligo, by his brother Maurice. He was the father of the first earl of Kildare, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9645/', "John fitz Thomas Fitzgerald")</script> and he died at Lough Mask in 1271.<br>
