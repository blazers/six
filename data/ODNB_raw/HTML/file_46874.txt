<span class="headword">Paula,  Frederic Rudolph Mackley  de</span>  (1882&#150;1954), <span class="occ">writer on accountancy and industrialist</span>, was born on 23 July 1882 at Avenue House, Tenterden Grove, Hendon, London, one of the five children of Friedrich Mortiz Alphonse Felix de Paula, a partner in the City solicitors' practice of Carey, Warburton, and de Paula, and his wife Ellen Harriet, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Mackley. Frederic, whose grandmother was of German origin, had one brother (who became a City stockbroker) and three sisters. Following his father's death in 1902, the family lived for a time in North Finchley, and later at Netherdale, Nether Street, Church End, Finchley. De Paula attended Mill Hill School before going to work in the City of London in 1901, when he became articled to the chartered accountant Charles F. Cape at 12 Coleman Street; he qualified in 1905 and set up in practice in 1909. A year later he was joined by Edgar John Turner, and practised as De Paula, Turner &amp; Co. until 1913, when a further partnership change resulted in the creation of De Paula, Turner, Lake &amp; Co.<br>
<br>De Paula's main contribution to accountancy was not as a practitioner but as a teacher and writer, industrialist, and champion of regulatory requirements concerning financial reporting practice. Soon after qualifying he presented auditing lectures to the finals students of the Chartered Accountants Students' Society of London. Increasingly dissatisfied with the literature available for students, he published in 1914 <span class="italic">The Principles of Auditing</span>, a successful text which ran to eleven editions during his lifetime. In 1920 he joined Lawrence R. Dicksee at the London School of Economics as a part-time lecturer on the new commerce degree. De Paula continued his involvement, part time, as a reader from 1924, and as professor of accountancy and business methods (in succession to Dicksee) in 1926. This was the year he presented arguably his most important public lecture, entitled &#145;The place of accountancy in commerce&#146;. The lecture aimed to raise the status of the accounts department within companies by identifying its principal functions and making businessmen fully aware of the way it could contribute to the practical management of business organizations. It was a timely intervention. Accountants were beginning to move from the profession in growing numbers, sometimes at top level (with Francis D'Arcy Cooper's move to Lever Brothers the most celebrated example), but more often in a specifically accounting capacity. There was a need for greater recognition of the contributions they could make beyond keeping the records straight and assisting in the preparation of the published accounts. The opportunity for de Paula to put his ideas into practice was not long in coming. In 1929 he resigned his chair and his partnership in order to give full attention to his new appointment as chief accountant at the Dunlop Rubber Company, where he soon became controller of finance.<br>
<br>At Dunlop de Paula renewed personal links developed during the First World War, when he had joined the Ministry of Munitions and worked for Sir Eric Geddes. His immediate superior was George Beharrell, and in due course he succeeded Beharrell as director of the statistical section of the gun ammunition filling department. In 1917 he followed Geddes to France, and became the latter's assistant director-general of transportation at general headquarters, with the rank of lieutenant-colonel. With Dunlop suffering from financial problems in the late 1920s, it was perhaps natural that the company's chairman, Geddes, and managing director, Beharrell, should turn to de Paula to see what contribution an accountant could make to the resolution of their difficulties.<br>
<br>It is de Paula's contribution towards the improvement of Dunlop's financial reporting practices which has perhaps received most attention. The year 1931 saw the prosecution of the chairman (Lord Kylsant) and auditor (Harold Moreland, of Price, Waterhouse &amp; Co.) of the Royal Mail Shipping Company for publishing a balance sheet which was false and fraudulent. Although resulting in acquittal, the prosecution served to demonstrate the lamentable state of financial reporting practice among many of Britain's largest companies. The prestige of the profession slumped to an unprecedented depth. De Paula had already persuaded Dunlop to make a number of innovations in the accounts for 1929, and these were taken further in 1931, and again in 1933, drawing acclaim from the financial press and being described by the <span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span> as &#145;a joy to its own shareholders and the envy of all others&#146;. In the aftermath of the Royal Mail case, Dunlop undoubtedly blazed a trail for other companies to follow.<br>
<br>Turning to the company's management information system, de Paula placed particular emphasis on the need to develop an integrated system of budgetary planning and control covering the company's entire financial affairs. Such ideas were not unknown in the literature, but British industry had been slow to give them practical effect. De Paula provided leadership, both in terms of the reforms introduced in Dunlop, which were copied by other companies (for example, Pilkington), and in important lectures delivered in the mid-1930s, which attracted widespread attention. A serious illness then led to his retirement in 1941. Later, however, he moved on to Harding, Tilton, and Hartley Ltd, a firm of shirt manufacturers at Taunton, as vice-chairman and joint managing director. He served as chairman of this company (renamed British Van Heusen Company) and on the board of other leading public companies.<br>
<br>De Paula's final major achievement was to help raise the awareness of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales (ICAEW) concerning the need to cater for chartered accountants who had moved to industry. By the outbreak of the Second World War, about 50 per cent of all chartered accountants were working in business, but there was a tendency for the institute's leaders (drawn from public practice) to regard them as, at best, second-class citizens. Pressure from younger members in industry in the early 1940s, together with criticism in the press, helped to contribute to the establishment of the taxation and financial relations committee of the ICAEW, which dealt with the relationship of the business community with the Inland Revenue and other government departments. Also, for the first time, arrangements were made for the election of non-practising members to the institute's council.<br>
<br>De Paula was the first non-practising member appointed to council, and he was also elected vice-chairman of the new committee, which is today best remembered for the twenty-nine recommendations on accounting principles issued between 1942 and 1969. These forerunners of today's financial reporting standards were guidelines on best practice, which companies were encouraged to adopt, and it is generally agreed that they succeeded in raising significantly the general standard of financial reporting. De Paula was the committee's chairman between 1943 and 1945, during which time recommendations 6 to 10 laid out the main valuation bases for published accounts. The topics covered correspond fairly closely to the list of subjects requiring attention identified by de Paula in the preface to <span class="italic">The Principles of Auditing</span> (6th edn, 1933). De Paula was appointed CBE in the new year's honours list of 1951, partly in recognition of his work on a government committee appointed to review the organization and administrative methods of the Inland Revenue.<br>
<br>De Paula married, in 1912, Agnes Smithson, the daughter of Frances Joseph Clark, of the Quaker shoemaking family of Street, Somerset. They lived for many years in Radlett, Hertfordshire, where they served, respectively, as captain and lady captain of the Porters Park Golf Club. There were two sons from the marriage, Hugh Francis Mackley and Frederic Clive. The latter edited issues of <span class="italic">The Principles of Auditing</span> published after his father's death. De Paula died at his London home, 55 Park Mansions, Knightsbridge, on 13 December 1954. The Quaker influence was evidenced by his express wish that no mourning should be worn. His wife survived him.<br>
