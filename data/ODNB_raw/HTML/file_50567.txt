<span class="headword">Macdiarmid, Sir  Allan Campbell</span>  (1880&#150;1945), <span class="occ">steel manufacturer</span>, was born at Glasgow on 18 August 1880, the youngest son of Allan Macdiarmid, a partner in a Glasgow merchants (James Anderson &amp; Co.), and his wife, Elizabeth, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Tulloch. Educated at Kelvinside Academy in Glasgow, and then at Uppingham School, Macdiarmid declined to follow his two elder brothers to Cambridge and instead trained as an accountant with a local firm, McClelland, Ker &amp; Co.<br>
<br>In 1909 Macdiarmid began his career in the steel industry, becoming company secretary to Stewart and Lloyds, a firm he was to be associated with throughout his career. It had been formed in 1903 as an Anglo-Scottish merger of two steel-tube producing interests: Stewart and Menzies on Clydeside and Lloyd and Lloyd of Birmingham. Profitable and relatively efficient, the combine produced about half the UK's output of steel-tube products and exported nearly one-half of its finished tubes and fittings. Controlled by family interests (the Stewarts in Scotland and the English Lloyd and Howard families) and commercially tough and competitive, the company, under its chairman, John G. Stewart, offered Macdiarmid both an opportunity and a training. He soon made his mark as a board-room adviser, making contributions to both accounting systems and some policy decisions.<br>
<br>In 1918 Macdiarmid joined the board of Stewart and Lloyds and immediately set up an important policy unit&#151;the general purposes advisory committee. This organization helped the drive towards centralization and modernization in the 1920s. Macdiarmid's influence was felt in some pioneering improvements in information systems, which sought to give better control of capital requirements and cash flows. By the mid-1920s, Macdiarmid had become J. G. Stewart's most logical successor. When the latter died in 1925 he became briefly deputy chairman; then in June 1926 he was appointed chairman.<br>
<br>Macdiarmid now entered the most dynamic phase of his career as he pursued Stewart and Lloyds' long-term policy objectives. These included international competitiveness and a leading position in the domestic steel-tube business, based on the cheapest production of steel tubes in the country. These objectives had been traditional ones at Stewart and Lloyds, but Macdiarmid refined them for the more difficult era of the inter-war years.<blockquote>To these tasks he brought formidable supplies of guile, nerve and persistence. He became a pastmaster particularly at stonewalling and playing hard to get, exuding mystery or noncommittal helpfulness, taking a long view and plotting forward sequential moves well in advance. (<span class="italic">DSBB</span>)</blockquote>Macdiarmid brokered important agreements to supply oil companies, absorbed rival tube makers, negotiated for both domestic and international cartels, and sought best-practice tube technology from the USA and Germany.<br>
<br>Stewart and Lloyds was relatively well-placed in the early 1920s. The older dynastic family elements within the firm, which had crippled many other steel firms, had given way at Stewart and Lloyds to professional managers, such as Macdiarmid. The firm's restrained financial policies meant that it had also avoided the kind of heavy debts that other firms had incurred in the brief post-war boom. However, Macdiarmid recognized that the firm's relative prosperity was threatened by its fragmented layout, which prevented the use of the newest tube technologies. Macdiarmid's answer was to build a major new integrated iron and tube works at Corby, Northamptonshire. This aimed to produce the cheapest bulk steel in Europe. For this undertaking a canny negotiator like Macdiarmid was able to utilize government support, which came in the form of advice, financial help (through the Bankers' Industrial Development Company (BID Co.), and protectionism. This enabled Stewart and Lloyds to build its works cheaply and to consolidate its hold on the steel-tube business, despite the opposition of some powerful voices within the industry, such as the United Steel Companies. There were some negative aspects. Corby was an ecological blot on the landscape and labour relations at the company were uninspired. Macdiarmid's critics found him rapacious, and his hard-nosed attitude to BID Co. and other firms, such as Colvilles, did not win him admirers everywhere. The company stood aloof from some important developments: it refused to affiliate, for example, to the new British Iron and Steel Federation (BISF), and was also choosy about following voluntary price controls set by the import duties advisory committee of the BISF. However, the Corby initiative was fortuitously well timed&#151;it was built quickly and economically and came on stream at the end of 1934 as steel demand began to recover&#151;and Stewart and Lloyds became one of the few British steel firms to break decisively and successfully from its Victorian past.<br>
<br>Within the firm Macdiarmid was an autocrat who by the early 1930s dominated the board-room. Like many of the old Victorian owner&#150;managers, he acted as both chairman and managing director. Like them, he needed help, which came, notably, from leading managers such as Guy McClay and Francis McClure (his double brother-in-law), J. H. Lloyd (marketing), and R. Menzies Wilson (works management). One of Macdiarmid's sons, Niall, was also to become chairman and managing director of Stewart and Lloyds. However, the elder Macdiarmid was the dominating presence at the company, maintaining his position by the force of his personality and his successful policies. He evidently cared little for great wealth or social status. A shy man who disliked formal occasions and had no particular interest in religion, he had few commitments outside his family (which consisted of his wife, Grace Buchanan, <i>n&eacute;e</i> McClure, whom he had married in 1910, and two daughters and three sons). In business he found rewards in the pursuit of trade as a great intellectual game, in which his success could not be doubted. By the late 1930s Stewart and Lloyds was returning record profits. The approach of war had obviously helped: however, it was &#145;in many ways a copy book case of successful competitive strategy&#146;  (<span class="italic">DSBB</span>).<br>
<br>In the Second World War, Stewart and Lloyds became a major shell producer. Such was the level of demand, even activity in Scotland began to revive. Macdiarmid threw himself into the armaments drive with his usual energy, developing closer ties with Whitehall and giving some thought to the reconstruction of the industry after the war. He became president of the BISF in 1944, healing his former rift with that body. He was knighted in 1945. However, just as it looked as though he was about to emerge as an industrial statesman for the post-war steel industry, his career was ended by his death in London on 14 August 1945. He was survived by his wife.<br>
