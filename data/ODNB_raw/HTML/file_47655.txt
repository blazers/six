<span class="headword">Ditchfield,  John Edwin  Watts-</span>  (1861&#150;1923), <span class="occ">bishop of Chelmsford</span>, was born on 17 September 1861 at Green Lane, Patricroft, Manchester, the fifth child and only surviving son of John Ditchfield (<i>b</i>. 1814) and his wife, Mary Ann Watts (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1823). His father had started work in a cotton mill at the age of eight, but had risen to become headmaster of Patricroft higher grade school.<br>
<br>The family was strongly Methodist and concerned with social questions and temperance. From an early age the younger John Ditchfield was taken on pastoral visits by his father, and during adolescence had a profound religious experience which left him determined to enter the ministry. He preached his first sermon in 1877, and gradually worked through the Wesleyan hierarchy until in 1887 he was accepted for the ministry and entered Headingley College, Leeds. But the Methodist ministry was overcrowded and Ditchfield was advised that he could not make it his profession, either in Britain or overseas. He converted and in 1888 was confirmed in the Church of England at Manchester Cathedral. About the same time he changed his name to Watts-Ditchfield. He studied at St John's Hall in Highbury (north London), was ordained in 1891, and became curate at St Peter's, Upper Holloway. On 3 September 1892 he made a happy and successful marriage to Jane Wardell (<i>b</i>. 1864/5), daughter of Thomas Lax Wardell of Bow, a commercial clerk. A daughter was born in 1895.<br>
<br>Many churchmen of the time saw the Sunday school as the chief means of evangelism, on the assumption that the child, once captured, would remain in the church. Watts-Ditchfield disagreed: he believed that the church was seen as something fit only for women and children, and argued that if the church got the man, it got the whole family. He instituted a men's service at St Peter's, and, by adroit publicity, eye-catching and provocative titles for his sermons, and careful attention to pastoral work, built up a regular attendance of several hundred. He also instituted several thrift and benefit societies, besides clubs for ramblers and sportsmen, and a reading-room.<br>
<br>In 1897 Watts-Ditchfield was offered the living of St James-the-Less, Bethnal Green, a parish of some 11,000 people. The several parishes in the borough presented the churches with a recognized challenge. The area was poor; its housing was dilapidated, insanitary, and overcrowded; there was little provision for any recreation, and the population was largely employed in low-paid and insecure casual labour or in &#145;sweated&#146; industries. These cumulative distresses found their outlet in heavy drinking, domestic violence, and attitudes to the church which ranged from contemptuous dismissal to a cringing hope of charity. If the church could succeed in evangelizing Bethnal Green, it could succeed anywhere.<br>
<br>Watts-Ditchfield applied the same methods as at Upper Holloway: the institution of separate men's and women's services, active evangelism, and the provision of facilities for recreation. As vicar he showed a remarkable talent for fund-raising, and so was able to provide his parishioners with a parish centre, a recreation ground, hostels for single working men, and a medical service. He insisted that if people would not come to church, the church must go to them, and held open-air services in Green Street Market and Victoria Park, besides instituting a brass band which toured the area on Sunday afternoons. Watts-Ditchfield was also active on the side of social justice: in 1902 and 1904 he held exhibitions of goods produced by &#145;sweated&#146; labour, and these activities led to the <span class="italic">Daily News</span> exhibition of 1906 and eventually to the <span class="roman">Trades Boards Act</span> of 1909.<br>
<br>Bethnal Green was a make-or-break job, and it made Watts-Ditchfield. There were twenty-six Easter communicants in 1897, but 597 in 1903, and 915 in 1914. According to the <span class="italic">Daily News</span> religious census of 1903, 1699 people attended at St James-the-Less, more than double the number at any other Anglican church in the borough. The diocese of Chelmsford was created out of that of St Albans in 1914, and as it was to include the large suburban area of &#145;London over the border&#146;, Watts-Ditchfield was an excellent if surprising choice as its first bishop. He had the urban mission experience, but the bench was full of men from Anglican families, educated at public schools and the ancient universities. Watts-Ditchfield was a convert; he was not a graduate, and his experience had been in parish work rather than administration. He was consecrated on 24 February and enthroned on 23 April 1914.<br>
<br>Almost immediately Watts-Ditchfield had to face the challenges presented by the First World War. His was not an unthinking patriotism and he continued to insist on social justice and on Christian conduct, not only on Britain's part but on that of its allies, particularly Belgium and Russia. Perhaps for this reason, he was an enthusiastic supporter of the &#145;national mission of repentance and hope&#146; of 1916. After the war Watts-Ditchfield's main difficulties were clerical discipline and organization. Perhaps because he was a convert to Anglicanism, he appeared to have an exaggerated view of his episcopal powers and the degree of conformity he could expect from his clergy, and some of his subordinates resented the rigid and even menacing tone of his doctrinal pronouncements. A particular thorn in Watts-Ditchfield's side was Conrad Noel, vicar of Thaxted, who combined extreme Anglo-Catholicism with revolutionary socialism. The problems of diocesan organization included an underpaid workforce and inadequate buildings. In Chelmsford itself, the parish church had been chosen as the cathedral without any provision being made for its new function.<br>
<br>A favourite saying of Watts-Ditchfield's father was that it was &#145;better to wear out than to rust out&#146;. His son lived and died by that precept. Watts-Ditchfield added to his burdens without thought for his health, and he was exhausted when obliged to have an operation for appendicitis. He never recovered from the anaesthetic, and died on 14 July 1923 at 41 Beaumont Street, St Marylebone, London. He was buried in the churchyard of Chelmsford Cathedral five days later.<br>
