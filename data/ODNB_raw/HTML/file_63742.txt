<span class="headword">Beauman,  (Archibald) Bentley</span>  (1888&#150;1977), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was born on 30 November 1888 in Paddington, London, the eldest son of Bentley Martin Beauman, a stockbroker. He was educated at Malvern College and Sandhurst and was commissioned into the South Staffordshire regiment in 1908. He joined the 2nd battalion in South Africa in the same year. After serving in South Africa and England he landed in France with the 2nd battalion South Staffordshire in 1914 with the original expeditionary force, but was wounded in the first battle of Ypres in November 1914 and invalided home.<br>
<br>After recovering from his wounds Beauman returned to France in January 1915 and became adjutant of the 1st battalion. When his commanding officer became ill during the battle of Neuve Chapelle in 1915, Beauman commanded the battalion, and though only a captain at the time held the temporary rank of acting lieutenant-colonel. He was wounded again near Hooge later in the year and then served on the staff as deputy assistant adjutant and quartermaster-general (a major) before returning to command the 1st battalion during the battle of the Somme in 1916.<br>
<br>In May 1918 he was promoted to command 69th infantry brigade in Italy, and thus achieved the temporary rank of brigadier-general at the age of twenty-nine. He was awarded a DSO during the battle of the Somme and earned a bar to it during the third battle of Ypres (Passchendaele) the following year. He was also mentioned six times in dispatches and received the Italian silver medal for valour and the Italian cross of war.<br>
<br>In 1919 Beauman commanded the 20th Durham light infantry, in 1920 he took the course at the Staff College, Camberley, and from 1921 to 1925 he served on the staff in Baluchistan district, India. On 15 September 1923 he married Eva Dorothy (<i>d</i>. 1949), second daughter of Albert E. Pullar of Durn, Perth. They had a son (who predeceased him) and a daughter. In 1926 he became chief instructor in tactics and military history at the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, and he then commanded the 1st battalion York and Lancaster regiment in Northern Ireland from 1928 to 1932.<br>
<br>From 1932 to 1936 he was assistant commandant and chief instructor at the Netheravon wing of the Small Arms School, and from 1934 to 1938 he commanded 15 infantry brigade in Palestine. This last appointment involved active service during the Arab revolt and earned him a CBE and a further mention in dispatches. In 1938 he was aide-de-camp to the king.<br>
<br>Although he retired from active service in 1938, Beauman was recalled in September 1939 and appointed commander, Cherbourg area. In 1940 he was promoted major-general to command northern district, lines of communication (including the defence of airfields), British expeditionary force. During and after the Dunkirk evacuation he commanded an improvised formation made up of miscellaneous troops gathered from the rear areas and named Beauforce, which later became Beauman division. Despite the circumstances Beauforce fought a creditable and gallant rearguard action. Beauman was mentioned in dispatches twice more at this time. After returning from France he commanded Sheffield sub-area and from 1942 to 1944 North Riding district.<br>
<br>After the war Beauman, who had always been a keen horseman, acted for a time as a racing correspondent. He was an excellent cricketer and a keen fisherman. A popular and much respected commander, he was particularly good as a trainer of troops. In 1919 he wrote a booklet, <span class="italic">With the 38th in France and Italy</span>&#151;38 being the original number of the 1st Staffordshire regiment&#151;which gave a vivid account of his regiment's First World War experiences, and a book of reminiscences entitled <span class="italic">Then a Soldier</span> (1960). In 1939 he published <span class="italic">Common Mistakes in the Solution of Tactical Problems</span>.<br>
<br>On 24 June 1952 Beauman married Barbara Gwendoline Arnold (<i>b</i>. 1907/8), who survived him. He died at his home, Orwell, Nursery Road, Walton on the Hill, Tadworth, Surrey, on 22 March 1977 at the age of eighty-eight.<br>
