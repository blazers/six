<span class="headword">Bull,  Phil</span>  (1910&#150;1989), <span class="occ">racehorse owner and punter</span>, was born on 9 April 1910 at 3 Cemetery Road, Hemsworth, West Riding of Yorkshire, the only son and eldest of the three children of William Osborne Bull (<i>c</i>.1870&#150;1954), a coalminer who later became a sanitary inspector, and his wife, Lizzie Jessop (Dolly) Watson (1884&#150;1972), schoolteacher. He was educated at Hemsworth church school and then, by way of scholarships, at Hemsworth grammar school (1921&#150;8) and Leeds University (1928&#150;31), where he took a degree in mathematics. He worked first as a schoolteacher in London but left that profession to devote himself to racing. He specialized in betting and selling advice to other punters, either directly or via his own racing publications, initially under the <i>non de plume</i> William K. Temple. His meticulous accounts show that when he gave up serious betting about 1974 he had taken the equivalent (in early twenty-first-century terms) of over &pound;5 million from the bookmakers. He was not a gambler but a rational placer of bets who gained intellectual stimulus from the challenge of the new set of horses that appeared each year.<br>
<br>The basis of Bull's betting was past racing performance, but not merely the relative finishing positions used by most students of form. He maintained that a moderate horse could never become a great one but that any horse which ran a fast time was capable of replicating the feat when conditions were propitious. From this idea came his development of <span class="italic">Timeform</span>, which he introduced to the racing public in 1948. In this detailed publication every racehorse in Britain was rated according to achieved speed. This major original contribution to racing became internationally recognized, and was eventually mirrored by the Jockey Club in its handicapping system.<br>
<br>Although Bull always maintained that for the public racing was about betting, not breeding, he was himself interested in the latter aspect of the sport. He founded the Hollins Stud in 1947, though this was not a tangible entity but a corporate name for his breeding operations. He was unusual for an owner&#150;breeder in that every year he offered all his stock for sale. Perhaps this contributed to his never winning a classic, although his fillies Arietta and Aureoletta were third respectively in the One Thousand Guineas and the Oaks.<br>
<br>A socialist by upbringing&#151;his uncle Gabriel Price (1879&#150;1934) was Labour MP for Hemsworth&#151;and an egalitarian by conviction, Bull had little time for the racing establishment, especially for those members of the Jockey Club who had been public-school educated. Many of his writings were trenchant criticisms of the club's conservatism and of its failure to act in the interests of punters, who, as Bull often pointed out, made a major contribution to racing via the betting levy. Well before they were adopted he advocated electronic timing, Sunday racing, and prominently displayed betting odds boards. He was never invited to join the Jockey Club; in 1980, however, he was appointed to the chair of the horseracing advisory committee. He lasted just over four months before he resigned from what he termed a &#145;cosmetic charade&#146;  (Wright, 223), a body not treated seriously by either the Jockey Club or the Horserace Betting Levy Board, which were the key players in running and financing racing. In any event Bull was not by nature a compromiser and he found it difficult to curb his individualism to the needs of committee work. Although he felt that kindness was a virtue he had no such regard for tolerance, believing that one should speak out against people and policies with which one disagrees.<br>
<br>Bull married three times. His first marriage, on 15 June 1935, was to a fellow teacher, Doris Astley, who was five months pregnant at the time with his son David. They soon separated and were divorced in June 1944. By then Bull had been living for almost four years with another teacher, Eleanor (Nell) Oxley, with whom he had two children, Anne and Raymond. On 4 November 1949 he married Wendy Carter, and on 2 September 1963 Patricia Scott Finlay. Patricia had replaced Wendy as his personal assistant at <span class="italic">Timeform</span>, and both eventually left Bull for younger men.<br>
<br>Instantly recognizable with his ginger beard (first retained as a protest after a headmaster demanded he shave it off), heavy glasses, and ubiquitous cigar, Bull cultivated his image of bluntness and liked to play the showman. Away from the racetrack and the study where he spent hours working on his betting plans he indulged his passion for classical music, chess, and snooker. He was a humanist who maintained that all religions were superstitious nonsense and that the Christian faith in particular had brought immeasurable unhappiness to the world. He died at his home, The Hollins, Warley, Halifax, Yorkshire, on 11 June 1989.<br>
