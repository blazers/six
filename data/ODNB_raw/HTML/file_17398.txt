<span class="headword">Maccormac,  Henry</span>  (1800&#150;1886), <span class="occ">physician</span>, was born at Carnan, co. Armagh, the fifth of the eight children of John Maccormac (<i>d</i>. 1811), a linen merchant, and his wife, Anne (<i>d</i>. 1846), daughter of Joseph Hall, a distiller from co. Armagh. He studied medicine in Dublin and then in Paris, where he studied at the L'H&ocirc;tel Dieu under the famous surgeon Guillaume, Baron Dupuytren, before graduating MD at Edinburgh in 1824 with a thesis entitled &#145;De clabo secalino&#146;. In the same year he became a licentiate of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh.<br>
<br>Following the completion of his studies Maccormac visited Africa, travelling by land from the Cape of Good Hope to Sierra Leone where his brother John was a magistrate. During this journey he nearly died of yellow fever. He subsequently made two voyages to the United States and Canada. He was appointed physician in 1828 to the Belfast Fever Hospital, where in 1832 he successfully limited the spread of an outbreak of cholera in the city. In recognition of this work he received a public testimonial from the citizens of Belfast. In 1833 he married Mary Newsam 
    (or Newsham; 1811&#150;1871)
  ; they raised a family of two sons and three daughters.<br>
<br>In 1835 a faculty of medicine was established in the Belfast Academical Institution and Maccormac was appointed to the chair of theory and practice of medicine, a post he held until 1848. During this time he was also, from 1840 to 1845, dean of the faculty of medicine. In 1849 Maccormac unsuccessfully applied for the chair of medicine in the new Queen's College. In the same year he was appointed physician to the Belfast Lunatic Asylum, a position which he held until his death. He brought about a marked change in the quality of the life of the patients, introducing an active healthy regimen to the asylum and improving the patients' diet. In 1849 cholera again struck Belfast, but owing to Maccormac's methods there were no deaths in the asylum.<br>
<br>Maccormac's medical writings cover a broad range of subjects but he devoted particular attention to the cause and cure of tuberculosis. In the mid-nineteenth century a wide variety of theories were advanced to explain the cause of the disease. Without a common belief in the contagious nature of tuberculosis, causes such as physical predisposition, hereditary inheritance, poverty, and alcoholism were suggested. Maccormac believed that the disease was caused by re-breathed air and advocated the benefits of fresh air as a cure. He was in good company as this view was shared by Florence Nightingale. However, the stubborn way in which Maccormac put forward his ideas, refusing to see reason in any of those who opposed him, did not endear him to his peers. He demanded that his patients follow his advice and open the windows of their homes to ensure good health. On one occasion he had to appear in court for breaking the window panes of the house of a patient who had refused to heed his advice.<br>
<br>In 1861 Maccormac gave a paper to the Royal Medical and Surgical Society in London on &#145;the true nature and absolute preventibility of tubercular consumption&#146; in which he presented his belief that foul and impure air was the only possible source of tuberculosis. This paper was so badly received by the society that its members refused to pass a vote of thanks to him and calls were made for all future papers to be reviewed by a committee before being read to the society. Undaunted by this slight, Maccormac immediately replied robustly to his critics in the pages of the <span class="italic">Dublin Medical Press</span>. The event was not forgotten by Maccormac, and twenty years later he published another letter to the society on the subject asking them to reconsider their earlier actions. The attitude of the members of the Royal Medical and Surgical Society was not shared by all of Maccormac's contemporaries. His ideas on the open-air treatment of tuberculosis were embraced in Europe. Indeed a street was named after him in Copenhagen in recognition of his contribution to the treatment of the disease.<br>
<br>About 1866 Maccormac retired from his practice, though he continued to attend the asylum, and devoted himself to his literary and scientific studies. He wrote on a wide variety of subjects including medicine, insanity, religion, philology, and classical antiquity. He also concerned himself with the well-being of animals, writing a work advocating a way of killing animals for food that was more humane than the practices of the time. Although a deeply religious man, he did not adhere to any particular faith. One of his daughters, Mary, remained unmarried and looked after her father after the death of his wife in 1871. One of his sons was the distinguished surgeon <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/34690/', "Sir William MacCormac")</script>. Henry Maccormac died on 26 May 1886 at Fisherwick Place, Belfast.<br>
