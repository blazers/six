<span class="headword">Stevens family</span>  (<em>per. </em><em>c.</em>1830&#150;1925), <span class="occ">natural history auctioneers</span>, whose name was synonymous with natural history and curiosity auctions for over a century, became involved in this business when John Crace Stevens became a partner in a long-established Covent Garden auction house. The company had been founded about 1759 by Samuel Paterson, primarily to sell books although he conducted a few natural history auctions in his first decade. After several changes of ownership the business was taken over in 1824 by Thomas of Foster Lane, whom <a name="cosubject_56433"></a><span class="headword">John Crace Stevens</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1809, <em>d.</em> 1859)<span class="occ"></span> joined as a partner in 1831. He was the first son of John Stevens (<i>c</i>.1772&#150;1836) and Augusta Crace, who had married at St Anne's, Soho, on 4 June 1808. Another son, <a name="cosubject_56435"></a><span class="headword">Samuel Stevens</span>  (1817&#150;1899)<span class="occ"></span>, was also destined to enter the business, and they had at least one other child, a daughter, Ann, born on 22 August 1812, and baptized on 20 September at St Paul's, Covent Garden.<br>
<br>John Crace's first sale was the extraordinary collection of 40,000 insects belonging to pioneer entomologist Adrian Hardy Haworth. The company name changed to J. C. Stevens in 1834 and remained so thereafter, even surviving John's death. Samuel joined him as a partner in 1840 after a serious illness had compelled him to abandon his chosen career as an artist. About 1841 the first of the famous Stevens live sales was introduced&#151;the sales subsequently specialized in items as diverse as orchids and Lord Derby's menagerie. Samuel withdrew from the family business in 1848 and established the Natural History Agency at 24 Bloomsbury Street, Bedford Square, London, but took up the hammer temporarily after John's sudden death at the age of fifty, until John's son <a name="cosubject_71804"></a><span class="headword">Henry Stevens</span>  (1843&#150;1925)<span class="occ"></span> was old enough to continue the succession. Samuel became a well-known commercial entomologist and collector, and through his agency sold all the Amazonian and other treasures collected by the naturalists Alfred R. Wallace (1823&#150;1913) and Henry W. Bates (1825&#150;1892). His nephew, J. S. Stevens, assisted him in his business for many years. In 1867 he sold his agency to Edmund Thomas Higgins (<i>c</i>.1816&#150;1891), and devoted himself to insect-collecting, fishing, and watercolour painting. He married late in life, but his wife predeceased him and they had no children.<br>
<br>Henry Stevens, born on 8 February 1843 above the Great Rooms of 38 King Street, was the third child of John Crace Stevens and Mary Blockley, who had married in 1837. A born collector, Henry became a good amateur conchologist and horticulturalist and a noted photographer, as well as the doyen of natural history auctioneers. Although it was his father's wish that he become an architect, John's premature death precipitated his son into the auctioneer's world. He lived above the auction rooms until he married in 1869 Jessie Baily. She died in 1879, leaving him with a son and six daughters, the eldest aged nine, the youngest a baby.<br>
<br>Henry took out his first auctioneer's licence in 1863, and under his ownership Stevens remained the major British clearing house for natural history collections for the rest of the century and beyond. His first sale was the collection of Paul Du Chaillu, which included several gorillas. Every collectible thing passed over Stevens' tables: minerals, fossils, shells (including most of the finest private collections to come to the hammer), plants (especially orchids), birds' eggs (Stevens' telegraphic address&#151;Auk, London&#151;says it all), ethnographia and archaeologia, and an astonishing variety of curiosities and antiquities offered at his famous Friday miscellaneous sales and Tuesday curio sales. Curios had been a feature since Paterson's day, where once a &#145;bit of the Holy Cross&#146; fetched &pound;13. The most gruesome offerings were shrunken human heads, sold by Stevens on several occasions, the most remarkable being, in 1902, the collection of thirty-three tattooed Maori heads, the property of General Robley, who, it is said, decorated his bedroom wall with these relics and &#145;when unable to sleep at night &hellip; would rise and comb his Maoris' hair, and felt himself soothed&#146;  (Allingham, 204&#150;5). In 1900 Henry auctioned his late uncle Samuel's wonderful collection of butterflies and moths, the result of sixty years of collecting. It was noted for its &#145;amplitude of rarities, extraordinary varieties and numerous Haworthian types&#146;  (Chalmers-Hunt, 10) and realized record prices for British lepidoptera  (Allingham, 130&#150;31).<br>
<br>So many famous natural history collections came under the hammer during the Stevens' time at the auctioneer's rostrum that it takes a whole book to enumerate them all  (Chalmers-Hunt, 1976), let alone the who's who of scientists, collectors, and curators who frequented the saleroom floor and made many an auction as much a social and scientific gathering as a commercial event. Stevens' Great Rooms were the scene of many a triumph and tragedy, lovingly described by Emily Allingham in her excellent anecdotal history of the company. Perhaps the most telling tale of the collector's obsession is that of the conchologist who owned a unique shell. One day another such shell appeared at Stevens' rooms: &#145;He bid for it, he won it, and then&#151;before them all there, he dropped it on the floor, and he stamped on it, and &#147;Now&#148;, said he, &#147;I <i>still</i> have the unique specimen&#148;&#146;  (Allingham, 57). Henry died suddenly of pneumonia, at his home, Addlestone Lodge, Addlestone, Surrey, on 11 June 1925. The company carried on, but the popularity of natural history sales dwindled in the early twentieth century and the business closed down in the 1940s.<br>
