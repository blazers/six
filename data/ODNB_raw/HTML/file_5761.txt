<span class="headword">Cock,  George</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1615, <em>d.</em> 1679), <span class="occ">merchant and friend of Samuel Pepys</span>, was baptized at All Saints, Newcastle upon Tyne, on 25 April 1615, the son of Garrett Cocke. His family were deeply involved in trade and after his apprenticeship in 1631 to a corn merchant he became an influential and active member of the Newcastle Merchants Company, negotiating for them in their dispute with the Merchant Adventurers of London.<br>
<br>During the civil wars Cock was an early supporter of the king and was captured in 1643. He was released in exchange for a parliamentary prisoner but returned to Newcastle as a member of the marquess of Newcastle's army and was present at the siege when he was again captured, imprisoned, and eventually fined in 1646 as a delinquent. In one of several petitions after the Restoration he stated that he had been in exile for eleven years and was rewarded for his loyalty with the post of searcher in the port of Newcastle in 1660.<br>
<br>While abroad Cock was employed as an agent of the Eastland Company in Danzig. Here he may have met his first wife, Anna Marie Solomons, after whose death he married again. According to Pepys, Cock's second wife was &#145;a Germane lady, but a very great beauty&#146;  (Pepys, 22 Nov 1661). On his return to England he had houses in Greenwich and London. As a navy contractor and the &#145;greatest epicure in the world&#146;  (Pepys, 21 Aug 1665) he appears often in Samuel Pepys's diaries, usually with the prefix Captain. On 21 July 1662 Pepys records that &#145;I did take boat and down to Greenwich to Captain Cockes, who hath a most pleasant seat and neat&#146;. Cock was one of the few merchants wealthy and experienced enough to deal in Baltic and Scandinavian timber, owned a tannery in Limerick, and dealt extensively in hemp and tar. Though frequently enjoying his company and hospitality Pepys and others were wary of him. When asked by Lord Sandwich how far he could be trusted in the rather shady affair of the prize ships which they had all invested in, Pepys replied &#145;not too far&#146;  (Pepys, 23 Sept 1665). He was suspected by Pepys of anonymously offering hemp at high price when supplies were low during 1665&#150;6 but the risks for the merchants were considerable, given the Navy Board's frequent lack of money. Cock seems to have talked too much, particularly when drunk, a quality that would naturally make Pepys uneasy, especially on occasions such as that on 5 November 1665, when Cock interrupted a meeting &#145;as drunk as a dog, but could stand and talk and laugh &hellip; But very troublesome he is with his noise and talk and laughing, though very pleasant&#146;. However he generously bestowed gifts on Pepys and other associates, sending them wine, sturgeon, plate, and money. Cock was treasurer of the Commission for Sick and Wounded Seamen (1665&#150;7). He successfully petitioned for funds towards this on several occasions but came under suspicion for irregular accounting in 1670. Cock was elected a fellow of the Royal Society on 21 March 1666 (proposed by Viscount Brouncker). A merchant to the bone Cock wrote after the fire &#145;the city will be rebuilt by trade&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, vol. 170, p. 105). His will, dated 19 February 1679 and proved on 3 April that year unravels many threads of his life while dealing with his considerable estate and includes &pound;30 to repatriate a servant, &#145;Dutch Margaret&#146;. His will also mentions four sons: John, George, Matthew, and William. He died in the parish of St Clement Danes, London, and, in accordance with his wishes, was buried at night near his first wife in the church of St Peter-le-Poer, London.<br>
