<span class="headword">Compton, Sir  William</span>  (1482?&#150;1528), <span class="occ">courtier</span>, was the son and heir of Edmund Compton of Compton, Warwickshire; he was described as eleven years old and more on his father's death in 1493. According to Dugdale he became a page to Prince Henry, duke of York, and in due course a deep and lasting friendship grew between them. In 1510, a year after Henry's accession to the throne, Compton was first described as groom of the stool, and he served until 1526 as one of the king's most important and intimate personal servants, jousting with the king (nearly losing his life in 1510), keeping the king's linen, holding and disbursing large sums of money for the king's daily purchases. Compton was often entrusted with delicate tasks by Henry: enquiring on his behalf how far the fifth earl of Northumberland's marriage plans had gone, arranging for the king to meet a mistress, arresting the duke of Buckingham. He served in the military campaign of 1513 (he was knighted after the capture of Tournai in September) and on the Scottish borders in 1523.<br>
<br>Compton did enormously well out of the king's service, holding many offices; he became constable of several royal castles in the midlands, including Warwick, Sudeley, Kenilworth, and Fulbrook, and was variously bailiff, keeper, receiver, and steward on crown lands, taking what Wolsey, after Compton's death, described as &#145;excessive fees&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 1/49, fol. 75). He leased or received crown lands on a notable scale, ruthlessly exploiting his royal favour in disputes with Margaret Pole, countess of Salisbury, Edward Stafford, third duke of Buckingham, and Richard Grey, third earl of Kent, and embezzled jewels and gilt plate properly the king's. He bought up lands aggressively, possibly pressurizing a reluctant Buckingham to sell him a series of manors in 1520, and possibly being committed for a short time to the Fleet prison following complaints by Sir Henry Grey. By the end of his life he had built up a landed estate, centred on the south midlands, whose gross income in 1524&#150;5 was &pound;1689. It provided the basis for the peerage granted by Queen Elizabeth to Sir William's grandson Henry Compton. The latter's descendants, the marquesses of Northampton, have continued to live in the picture-book early Tudor country house built by Sir William Compton at Compton Wynyates in Warwickshire.<br>
<br>Compton does not appear to have played much part in the government of the realm and the administration of the localities. His posts as JP in Hertfordshire (1511&#150;14), in Leicestershire, Northamptonshire, Warwickshire, and Worcestershire (all from 1511), and in Somerset (from 1513), as sheriff (notably sheriff of Worcestershire for life from 1516), and as chancellor of Ireland (1513&#150;16) measure his standing rather than describe his activities. The same can be said of his chancellorship of Ireland between 1513 and 1516. Polydore Vergil believed that Compton's favour with the king made Cardinal Wolsey fearful, so much so that in 1523 he had Compton dispatched to the wars on the Scottish borders so that in his absence Wolsey &#145;might gradually cause him to be hateful to Henry&#146;  (<span class="italic">Anglica historia</span>, 308&#150;9). But military service was a natural step in the evolution from upstart courtier to landed magnate. Possibly Wolsey was responsible for Compton's resignation as groom of the stool in 1526, as part of the reforms known as the Eltham ordinances, but since Compton was then appointed usher of receipts in the exchequer and granted a licence allowing him to wear his hat in the royal presence, and since there is no sign that he lost his influence with the king, perhaps he did not regret the loss of a post too humble for the magnate he had now become.<br>
<br>There is nothing to suggest that Compton was interested in the concerns of government&#151;that he was for or against war with France, or that he had views on taxation or on how Ireland should be governed or the church reformed&#151;nor did he attempt to build up any kind of personal following or to displace Cardinal Wolsey. Lord Herbert of Cherbury, Henry VIII's biographer in the 1640s, summed him up well as &#145;being more attentive to his profit, than publique affairs&#146;  (Herbert, 8). In 1512 Compton married Werburga, widow of Sir Francis Cheyne and daughter of Sir John Brereton and his wife, Katherine, sister and heir of Sir William Berkeley. That he received several manors as a royal gift suggests that the king may well have played a part in the marriage. Wolsey in his capacity of legate later cited Compton for living in adultery with Lord Hastings's wife and for having taken the sacrament to disprove it. He died of sweating sickness in June 1528, leaving a son, Peter, aged six.<br>
