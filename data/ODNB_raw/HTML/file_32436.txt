<span class="headword">Clauson,  Albert Charles</span>, Baron Clauson  (1870&#150;1946), <span class="occ">judge</span>, was born on 14 January 1870 in Paddington, London, the younger of the two sons of Charles Clauson, merchant, and his wife, Julia Burton, daughter of the Revd John Wall Buckley, vicar of St Mary's, Paddington. His mother's family was one of considerable note, and several of its members had a recognizable influence on his career, particularly his uncle Henry Burton Buckley, the eminent lawyer who became the first Baron Wrenbury. From a home of quiet distinction Clauson entered the Merchant Taylors' School in 1881, proceeding as a scholar to St John's College, Oxford, where he won firsts in both classical moderations (1889) and <i>literae humaniores</i> (1891). Later he became a senior scholar of the college (1894) and an honorary fellow (1927).<br>
<br>Clauson was called to the bar in 1891 by Lincoln's Inn, of which he was treasurer in 1937. On 15 December 1902 he married Kate, daughter of James Thomas Hopwood, barrister, of Lincoln's Inn, widow of Lucas Thomasson and sister of Sir Francis Hopwood (later Lord Southborough). Clauson's association with his uncle, who had taken silk in 1886, assisted him to acquire a large junior practice at an unusually early age. He edited the seventh (1897) and eighth (1902) editions of Buckley's classical treatise on the <span class="roman">Companies Acts</span>, which brought him lucrative business in that branch of the law. When he took silk in 1910 he was one of the busiest of the Chancery juniors. His success as a leader was soon such that he ceased to be attached to the court of a particular judge, as was then the rule, and joined the select band of &#145;specials&#146; who accepted briefs only when marked with a special fee. During the First World War Clauson took up work at the Admiralty, where he acted as the legal member, unpaid, of the controller's staff. He was appointed CBE for his services in 1920. In 1918&#150;19 he was in India with his brother-in-law Lord Southborough, who was chairman of the Indian franchise committee.<br>
<br>On his return to the bar Clauson resumed his position as one of the leading equity practitioners, and was soon engaged as much in the House of Lords and privy council as in the Strand. He was standing counsel to the University of Oxford and to the Royal College of Physicians. The success of Clauson's advocacy was due less to profundity of knowledge than to a clear and logical mind finding felicitous expression in apt and lucid language. He argued his cases with much distinction of style, although his precision of manner appeared on occasions to be pedantic, and as with many Chancery practitioners he was more at home in legal argument than in the handling of witnesses.<br>
<br>Clauson was appointed to the Chancery bench in 1926 and received the customary knighthood. Many of his qualities appeared to even greater advantage after he became a judge; he was courteous, and he was rapid, although inclined at times to an excess of subtlety and ingenuity. His twelve years' work as a Chancery judge was efficient and unobtrusive. His judgments in every branch of the equity jurisdiction were careful and scholarly, and he did much to elucidate the <span class="roman">Law of Property Act</span> of 1925, and the other reforming and consolidating statutes known to lawyers as the <span class="roman">Birkenhead Acts</span> which came into force in the year of his appointment. A citation from a Clauson judgment, especially in a Chancery matter, is always treated as authoritative and worthy of great respect.<br>
<br>Clauson was made a lord justice of appeal and sworn of the privy council in 1938, and displayed in the higher tribunal the same judicial aptitudes. But his time there was comparatively brief. He retired at the beginning of 1942 and was created a baron. Thereafter, until shortly before his death, he occasionally sat at the hearing of appeals both in the House of Lords and in the privy council.<br>
<br>Clauson's intellectual gifts found ample and congenial scope in the administration and practice of the law, and his ambitions were fully satisfied by the success which he achieved. By a kindliness of heart imperfectly concealed by a somewhat austere manner he won the affection of a large circle of friends both in his profession and beyond it. He maintained throughout his life a close interest in the Merchant Taylors' Company of which he was twice master. His portrait painted by L. Campbell Taylor in 1939 fortunately survived the destruction of the company's hall. He died at his home, Hawkshead House, North Mimms, near Hatfield, Hertfordshire, on 15 March 1946, a few weeks after the death of his wife. He had no children and the peerage became extinct on his death.<br>
