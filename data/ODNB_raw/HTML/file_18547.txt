<span class="headword">Melville,  James</span>  (1556&#150;1614), <span class="occ">Church of Scotland minister and diarist</span>, was the son of Richard Melville of Baldovy, minister of Maryton near Montrose, Angus, and his wife, Isabell Scrimgeour (<i>d</i>. 1557/8), sister of the laird of Glasswell. He was born on 25 July 1556, though his uncle, the presbyterian leader <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18543/', "Andrew Melville")</script>, considered that he was born in 1557  (<span class="italic">Autobiography and Diary</span>, 1.13). Taught first by the minister of Logie-Montrose, James was sent to school in the nearby burgh of Montrose and learned the rudiments of Latin and some French, before entering St Leonard's College, St Andrews, where he matriculated in 1570. He appreciated the value of education, was promised a bursary, and &#145;lyked the schollar's lyff best&#146;  (ibid., 23). Yet on arrival at university he found himself &#145;nather being weill groundet in grammar, nor com to the yeirs of naturall judgment&#146;, burst into tears when he failed to follow the Latin lectures, and was ready to return home  (ibid., 25). He persevered, however, and benefited from private tuition in the evenings. Also in St Andrews he heard the preaching of John Knox, whose powerful oratory made him shudder and tremble to such an extent that he found himself unable to &#145;hald a pen to wryte&#146;; he nevertheless became accustomed to hear the reformer, who was apt to call &#145;us schollars unto him and bless us, and exhort us to knaw God and his wark in our contrey, and stand be the guid cause&#146;  (ibid., 26). Melville's father hoped that he would become a lawyer, but James's thoughts turned to the ministry, and after graduating BA on 9 February 1572, he was invited by Andrew Melville, on the latter's appointment as principal of Glasgow University, to undertake teaching in arts.<br>
<br>At Stirling, as he travelled west to Glasgow, Melville met the eight-year-old James VI, &#145;the sweitest sight in Europe that day, for strange and extraordinar gifts of ingyne, judgment, memorie and langage&#146; and heard him discourse on knowledge and ignorance, &#145;to my grait mervell and estonishment&#146;  (<span class="italic">Autobiography and Diary</span>, 48). Melville's teaching at Glasgow began in 1575 with the Greek authors, Ramus's <span class="italic">Dialecticae</span>, and Talon's <span class="italic">Rhetorica</span>, followed in 1576 with instruction in arithmetic, mathematics, logic, and moral philosophy. In private study, however, Melville pursued Hebrew and theology, and participated in the &#145;exercise&#146; or &#145;prophesying&#146; organized by the ministers of the area for biblical exposition and homiletical training. According to his own account, his exhortation in church before the congregation, when his turn came round, &#145;pleasit and confortit guid peiple verie mikle, sa that they resorted verie frequentlie&#146;  (ibid., 55&#150;6).<br>
<br>When his uncle left Glasgow for St Andrews in 1580 to become principal of St Mary's College, James Melville, who had proposed to go to France, was persuaded to accompany his uncle to St Andrews and teach Hebrew grammar there. The town of Stirling petitioned in 1582 to have him as their minister, but neither the general assembly nor Andrew Melville granted approval for his translation. On 1 May 1583 he married Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1607&times;10), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8322/', "John Durie (1537&#150;1600)")</script>, the radical minister in Edinburgh who had initiated the debate on episcopacy in the general assembly in 1575. They had six children: Ephraim (<i>b</i>. 1585, <i>d</i>. in or before 1629), later minister of Pittenweem; Andrew (1586&#150;1588); Andrew (<i>b</i>. 1588, <i>d</i>. in or before 1613); Margaret (1593&#150;1594); John (1595&#150;1649), later minister of Newton; Issobel; and Anna (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1598).<br>
<br>Following the promulgation in 1584 of the <span class="roman">Black Acts</span> asserting the royal supremacy and authority of bishops, Melville heard that the archbishop of St Andrews intended to have him arrested. He made for Dundee and sailed for the safety of Berwick upon Tweed disguised as a &#145;shipbroken sie-man&#146;  (<span class="italic">Autobiography and Diary</span>, 168), as his house and papers were searched by the authorities. His eldest son was born in the town on 15 January 1585. Prohibited from preaching in public at Berwick, Melville served as minister to the banished ultra-protestant lords who had congregated at Newcastle upon Tyne and drew up an order of discipline to be observed. He announced there would be four sermons a week, with common prayers twice daily, and thanksgiving at every meal, with a chapter read from the <span class="roman">Bible</span> and a psalm sung. A week each month was to be set aside for fasting and meditation, followed by the celebration of the Lord's supper. Provision was also made for lectures and for lessons on the catechism. All who could read were to possess copies of the <span class="roman">Bible</span> and <span class="roman">Psalm Book</span>. The elders and deacons elected from the congregation were to meet weekly. The nobles dutifully agreed to these terms, which they observed for the duration of their exile.<br>
<br>From the safety of England, Melville wrote a lengthy letter condemning &#145;this present intolerable tyrannie of the fals Bischopes&#146; and censuring those ministers who had obeyed the king's requirement and signed the subscription of 1584 in favour of bishops and the royal supremacy  (<span class="italic">Autobiography and Diary</span>, 200). In November 1585 he returned home along with other presbyterian exiles. He and his uncle soon became embroiled in disputes with Archbishop Patrick Adamson, partly because the archbishop had reconverted St Mary's College into an arts school in their absence. A fierce attack on Adamson by James Melville at a meeting of the synod of Fife in the spring of 1586 led the assembled body to excommunicate the archbishop. The latter then retaliated by having an excommunication of the Melvilles proclaimed in Edinburgh. Uncle and nephew were called before the privy council in May, and the dispute was resolved by all parties being assigned teaching duties. In October 1586 James Melville was appointed minister of Anstruther and Kilrenny in Fife. Two years later he had the unusual experience of interviewing an admiral of the Spanish Armada whose ship found its way to Anstruther harbour after the fleet had been damaged in storms off Fair Isle in the far north.<br>
<br>Melville acquired further charges in Fife, but kept them only briefly. Active in collecting for the relief of exiled French protestants in England and for the city of Geneva, he consulted with nobles, lawyers, burgesses, and ministers in 1588 on the threat posed by the activities of Jesuits and seminary priests at home. In 1590 he was appointed by the privy council as a commissioner for preserving and promoting protestantism in Fife. During the following decade he published <span class="italic">The description of the Spainyart's naturall, out of Julius Scaliger, with sum exhortations for warning of kirk and countrey</span> (1592) and a devotional work, <span class="italic">Ane fruitful and comfortable exhortatioun anent death</span> (1597). In 1598 he issued <span class="italic">A Spiritual Propyne of a Pastor to his People</span>, a catechism &#145;for the profit of my peiple&#146;  (<span class="italic">Autobiography and Diary</span>, 12). His proposition that prayer makes &#145;us hamely with God&#146;  (<span class="italic">A Spiritual Propyne</span>, 5) reveals his ability to appreciate his parishioners' needs, and he underlined the value of music in enhancing family devotions. Sensitive to nature in his writings, he wrote poetry as well as prose, including a lament on the kirk in Greek verse.<br>
<br>Moderator of the general assembly in June 1589, Melville preached against attempts at introducing conformity with the Church of England. After obtaining Archbishop Adamson's repentance in 1591, he recommended to the synod of Fife the archbishop's release from excommunication. In 1594, with his uncle Andrew, he accompanied King James on an expedition against the northern Roman Catholic earls but at an interview with the king at Falkland Palace in 1595 he defended his fellow minister David Black whom the king had accused of preaching politics. In 1598 he opposed the king's plans for ecclesiastical representation in parliament as a device for reviving episcopacy. While he was prepared to give a public thanksgiving for the king's deliverance from the Gowrie conspiracy in 1600, he refused thereafter to celebrate the anniversary, as commanded by king and parliament. After his uncle had been warded in 1602, he continued to attend assemblies of the kirk and to speak out forcefully. By 1604 it was said that &#145;the king hated him most of anie man in Scotland, becaus he crossed all his turnes and was a ring-leader to others&#146;  (Calderwood, 6.261&#150;2).<br>
<br>In September 1605 Melville wrote an apology on behalf of the warded ministers who had offended the king by holding a general assembly at Aberdeen in defiance of his wishes, and in 1606 he signed the protest against episcopacy. As one of the presbyterian ministers invited by the king to London to attend a meeting at Hampton Court in 1606, he rejected any notion of royal supremacy in matters ecclesiastical, and was warded with the bishop of Durham. Permitted to leave London on 6 May 1607, he was ordered to remain within ten miles of Newcastle. However, following the death of his wife some time between 1607 and 1610 he was allowed to return briefly to Scotland to settle his affairs. According to David Calderwood, in October 1607 the king deputed Sir John Anstruther to go to Newcastle and offer Melville a bishopric, which he firmly declined; and in 1608 Melville declared that episcopacy &#145;was poprie&#146;  (Calderwood, 6.732). From Newcastle Melville published another devotional work, <span class="italic">A Morning Vision</span> (1609). In 1612 he married Deborah, the nineteen-year-old daughter of Richard Clerke, vicar of Berwick; they had no children. Melville seems to have contemplated moving to France, but he died in Berwick on 19 January 1614, and was buried there on 21 January.<br>
<br>To the sympathetic Calderwood, Melville was &#145;one of the wisest directours of kirk affaires that our kirk had in his tyme&#146;  (Calderwood, 7.190). With John Forbes and Robert Bruce he was a central figure in the ongoing Reformation and played a key role of spiritual father to men only a little younger than himself. For Archbishop John Spottiswoode, once his student at Glasgow, he was &#145;a man of good learning, sober and modest&#146;, but &#145;a crafty, biding man&#146; and &#145;so addicted to the courses of Mr Andrew Melvill, his uncle, as by following him he lost the king's favour, which he once enjoyed in a good measure, and so made himself and his labours unprofitable to the Church&#146;  (Spottiswoode, 3.190). Yet his writings have made a profound impression on the historiography of the kirk. His <span class="italic">Diary</span>, completed in 1602 and published in the nineteenth century, paints an admiring picture of one of its leading figures, his uncle Andrew, and presents a vivid and intimate portrait of church life which is generally faithful to the facts. His <span class="italic">True Narratioune of the Declyneing Aige of the Kirk of Scotland</span>, composed in 1610, also heavily influences an anti-episcopalian perspective, and other posthumously published works such as <span class="italic">The Black Bastel</span> (1634) and <span class="italic">A Short Relation of the Kirk of Scotland since the Reformation</span> (1638), have served to enhance it.<br>
