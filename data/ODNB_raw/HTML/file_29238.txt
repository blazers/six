<div class="para">
<span class="headword">White,  Charles</span>  (1728&#150;1813), <span class="occ">surgeon and man-midwife</span>, only son of Thomas White (1696&#150;1776), surgeon and man-midwife, and his wife, Rosamond, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Bower, was born at Manchester on 4 October 1728 and educated there by the Revd Radcliffe Russell. About 1742 he was apprenticed to his father and subsequently studied medicine in London at the school of William Hunter, who was then establishing a reputation in obstetrics. There White became close friends with William's brother, John, who was also studying at the school. White completed his studies in Edinburgh, before returning to Manchester, where he joined his father's practice as a surgeon and man-midwife.<br>
<br>In 1752 White was instrumental, along with Joseph Bancroft, a local merchant, in founding the Manchester Infirmary. This charity, funded by subscriptions of the wealthy, provided medical advice and treatment for the poor. White served as honorary surgeon from 1752 until 1790.<br>
<br>From the 1750s White began to establish a reputation as an innovative surgeon. He carried out a wide range of procedures, including lithotomy, amputations, and the removal of tumours. In 1760, in a paper before the Royal Society, he described a successful operation on a fractured arm, which brought together and united the two ends of the broken bone. Two years later he presented a further paper describing the use of sponges to stop haemorrhaging. He became a fellow of the Royal Society on 18 February 1762, and a member of the Company of Surgeons in the same year.<br>
<br>White was also concerned to develop the midwifery side of his father's practice. Following the principles established already by his father, he advocated &#145;rational methods&#146; and became highly regarded. In his well-known and influential book, <span class="italic">Treatise on the Management of Pregnant and Lying-in Women</span> (1773), he advised that women should give birth &#145;naturally&#146;. Delivery should not be assisted until the shoulders of the baby were expelled by the force of the mother's labour pains. He advised mothers to get out of bed as soon after delivery as possible and stressed the importance of cleanliness and ventilation. He recognized the analogy between puerperal and surgical fevers. This book, dedicated to his former teacher, William Hunter, was translated into both French and German and was also published in North America.<br>
<br>In 1757 White married Ann, daughter of John Bradshaw, one-time high sheriff for the county of Lancaster. They had eight children&#151;four sons and four daughters. Their second son, Thomas White (<i>b</i>. 1763), became physician to the Manchester Infirmary and a man-midwife. He died in 1793 following a fall from his horse. John Bradshaw White, their fourth son, also joined his father's practice but died in 1797.<br>
<br>White played a prominent social role in Manchester, then rapidly developing into an industrial city. He was a founding member of the Manchester Literary and Philosophical Society in 1781. In 1783, along with the physicians Thomas Percival and Thomas Henry, he helped to establish the short lived College of Arts and Science, where he and his son Thomas lectured on anatomy.<br>
<br>In 1790, after a dispute over the enlargement of the Manchester Infirmary, White resigned. Almost immediately he set up another hospital, the Lying-in Charity. This was, at first, a domiciliary service. In 1795 a modest in-patient facility was added. From its foundation the charity's aims were broad. A register of wet-nurses was kept and lecture courses were offered for both apothecaries and female midwives. In 1793 White himself gave a series of talks. White acted as man-midwife extraordinary to the charity until 1811. In 1854 the charity became known as St Mary's Hospital, the title it retains today.<br>
<br>From about 1795 White became interested in the relationships between different human races and between species of plants and animals. He read a number of papers to the Literary and Philosophical Society on the subject, which were published in 1799 as <span class="italic">An Account of the Regular Gradation in Man, Animals and Vegetables</span>. He concluded that there is general gradation from one species to another, suggesting relationships between species and races. However, he rejected the idea that one species may have developed from another.<br>
<br>In 1803 White had an attack of epidemic ophthalmia, which resulted in blindness in 1812. He died at his country house, The Priory, Sale, Ashton-on-Mersey, Cheshire, on 20 February 1813. In the church of Ashton-on-Mersey a monument to him and several members of his family was later erected.<br>
