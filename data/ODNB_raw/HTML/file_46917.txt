<span class="headword">Paston <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Knyvett]</span>,  Katherine</span>, Lady Paston  (<em>bap. </em>1578, <em>d.</em> 1629), <span class="occ">estate manager and letter writer</span>, was baptized on 22 June 1578 at Ashwellthorpe in north Norfolk, one of six surviving children of Sir Thomas Knyvett (<i>d</i>. 1618) and his wife, Muriel (<i>d</i>. 1616), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21433/', "Sir Thomas Parry (1515&#150;1560)")</script>. Details of Katherine's education are unknown. On 28 April 1603 she married Edmund Paston (1585&#150;1632), the only son of Christopher Paston (<i>b</i>. 1554, <i>d</i>. in or after 1611) and his wife, Anne (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Audley). The Paston family was at that time headed by <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21516/', "Sir William Paston (1528&#150;1610)")</script>, Edmund's grandfather, and it might have been he who initiated the match between Edmund and Katherine, for her father had been an &#145;old friend&#146;  (Marshall, 32) of his and one of the first governors of Paston School, which was his foundation.<br>
<br>Edmund Paston was knighted in March 1609. Following Sir William's death in 1610, Edmund and Katherine moved to the family seat, Paston Hall, and had two sons, William (1610&#150;1663) and Thomas (<i>b</i>. 1614). However, their lives remained heavily influenced by the actions of the family patriarch. Owing to the fact that his heir, Christopher, suffered from mental illness, in deeds of 1603 and 1608 Sir William had settled his estate into a trust from which Edmund and Katherine received &pound;800 a year for their maintenance. This arrangement led to several legal disputes between his descendants. Concerned that full provision should be made for her two sons, and because her husband was &#145;exceedinge sickly&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 27447, fol. 175), Katherine took matters into her own hands and carried a suit in Edmund's name to the court of chancery. In October 1618 she took up residence at St Giles-in-the-Fields in London with her two &#145;sweet boyes&#146;  (ibid., fol. 168) to enable her to attend the court. Although she corresponded frequently with Sir John Heveningham (1577&#150;1633), husband of Edmund's sister Bridget (1583&#150;1624) and one of Sir William's trustees, and also received support from Sir Thomas Holland (1574&#150;1626), widower of her sister Mary and godfather to her younger son, Lady Paston was far from dependent on these men. Her correspondence, preserved at the British Library (Add. MSS 27447 and 36988) and published in the twentieth century, reveals a sceptical businesswoman who tended to check all accounts and documents herself in the interest of her family. There are forty-eight letters from her, and thirty-seven addressed to her or to members of her family, mostly dating from 1618 to 1627.<br>
<br>About half the letters are from Lady Paston to her son William, and are concentrated in the period 1624 to 1627, when he was a student at Corpus Christi College, Cambridge. They reveal a significant level of maternal care and control, as well as a strong piety, usually beginning and ending with invocations of God's blessings on her son. Katherine sent advice, reminding William that now was &#145;the cheefest time to gayne the truest good boeth for sowll and body&#146;, and hoping that he might return to her &#145;adorned bothe with devine and humayne Learninge&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 36988, fol. 27). She also sent parcels of food for her son and his tutor, William Roberts, as well as the occasional gift for the college's master, Dr Samuel Walsall, who acknowledged thankfully the gifts of her &#145;bountifull hand&#146; and was full of praise for William's &#145;conversation &amp; demeanour&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 27447, fol. 205). Katherine visited Cambridge at least twice, in June and in October 1626, on the latter occasion just before the family moved temporarily to Palgrave to escape an outbreak of plague at Paston. They remained there until shortly before Easter 1627.<br>
<br>Lady Paston died on 10 March 1629 and was buried at St Margaret's Church, Paston. The master mason and sculptor Nicholas Stone made the monument the same year. The inscription proclaiming that her<blockquote>
<div>vertue did all ill soe overswaye<br>
</div>
<div>That her whole life was a comunion day<br>
</div> (<span class="italic">Correspondence</span>, 23)</blockquote>was said to have been written by John Donne, but the editor of the letters was unable to find evidence to substantiate this.<br>
