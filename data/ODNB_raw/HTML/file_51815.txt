<span class="headword">Cross,  Joan Annie</span>  (1900&#150;1993), <span class="occ">singer and teacher</span>, was born in London on 7 September 1900, and was adopted by an aunt and uncle. She was educated from 1913 at St Paul's Girls' School (where Gustav Holst was among her music teachers, and where she played in the first performance of Holst's <span class="italic">St Paul's Suite</span>) and Trinity College of Music, where, after studying the violin, she was taught singing by Dawson Freer, whose ability to establish firm vocal foundations she continued to praise to the end of her life. In 1923 she joined the chorus of Lilian Baylis's Old Vic, and by 1924 had graduated to principal status with, where Miss Baylis was concerned, a not untypically haphazard selection of leading roles, including Cherubino, Second Lady in <span class="italic">The Magic Flute</span>, Elisabeth in <span class="italic">Tannh&auml;user</span> (later alternating with Venus), Lola in <span class="italic">Cavalleria Rusticana</span>, both Mercedes and Frasquita in <span class="italic">Carmen</span>, and Alisa in <span class="italic">Lucia di Lammermoor</span>. The title role in <span class="italic">Aida</span> (alternating with the Priestess) preceded her biggest success to date in the role of Elsa in <span class="italic">Lohengrin</span> (1928), learned as an emergency replacement in the space of ten days. Evidence of her ability to soar above the chorus in the finale of <span class="italic">Lohengrin</span>'s act <span class="smallcap">I</span> and, in the act <span class="smallcap">II</span> scene with Ortrud, to project tone as well as conveying the ecstatic side of Elsa's character, was captured in recordings made at a performance in October 1933 and published in a retrospective album entitled <span class="italic">The Old Vic and Sadler's Wells</span>. &#145;Does the Wells public know its luck in having so rare a soprano?&#146; wrote Richard Capell in the <span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span> that year.<br>
<br>By the end of the 1920s Cross had added what became the basis of her repertory as a leading lyric soprano: Pamina, Donna Elvira, Mimi, Desdemona, Tatyana, Marguerite, Micaela, and Violetta, the last named after a full year of study. Capell wrote:<blockquote>Verdi's <span class="italic">Traviata</span> was given last night at the Old Vic &hellip; with such a singer in the title role as must have amazed any casual visitor &hellip; who might happen not to be aware that the Old Vic has the luck to claim the services of one of the best lyric sopranos of the day.</blockquote>In 1930 came Leonora in <span class="italic">La forza del destino</span>, of which role Francis Toye wrote in the <span class="italic">Morning Post</span>: &#145;Joan Cross, at her best, reached heights of vocal beauty and expressiveness that entitle her to rank among some of the best exponents of the art.&#146; According to her erstwhile colleague Clive Carey (writing twenty-three years later in the magazine <span class="italic">Opera</span>), in this role she &#145;matured from a promising singer to an operatic artist of first-rate potentialities&#146;.<br>
<br>The opportunity to realize those potentials came after the opening in 1931 of the Sadler's Wells Theatre, where the Old Vic's chief conductor, Charles Corri, was soon succeeded by Lawrance Collingwood, whose standards were high and who would influence much of the remainder of Joan Cross's life. Butterfly, Dido, and Antonia and Giulietta in a new production of <span class="italic">The Tales of Hoffmann</span> soon followed, and in September 1931, after singing Pamina at a matin&eacute;e at Sadler's Wells, she made an impromptu d&eacute;but at Covent Garden as Mimi. <span class="italic">The Times</span> wrote:<blockquote>She showed herself a credible Mimi, sympathetic but not too pathetic, who maintained in the bigger theatre the purity of line and subtle inflexions of tone which she employs on the smaller stage of the Old Vic and Sadler's Wells.</blockquote>Her pre-war activities at Covent Garden were to be sporadic: Mimi, Elsa, Micaela (with Conchita Supervia as Carmen), and a single Desdemona opposite Lauritz Melchior in 1934 (&#145;Better forgotten&#146;, she later said; &#145;We met for the first time on stage when I addressed him as &#147;Mio superbo guerrier&#148;!&#146;). At Sadler's Wells she created Arthur Benjamin's <span class="italic">The Devil Take her!</span> (under Beecham) and sang Collingwood's <span class="italic">Macbeth</span>, missing the premi&egrave;re because of illness; figured in revivals of Stanford's <span class="italic">Travelling Companion</span> and Vaughan Williams's <span class="italic">Hugh the Drover</span>; sang in the first British performances of Rimsky-Korsakov's <span class="italic">Snow Maiden</span> and <span class="italic">Tsar Saltan</span>; and added to her repertory Mar&#283;nka in <span class="italic">The Bartered Bride</span>, Amelia in <span class="italic">A Masked Ball</span>, Donna Anna, Fiordiligi, and Rosalinda, and, less probably, Gilda and Nanetta. In the seasons immediately preceding the war she registered what were to date possibly her two greatest successes, whose nature suggested a future which was never realized. In December 1937, only days after the sudden death of Lilian Baylis, came the first performance of <span class="italic">The Valkyrie</span>, in which Joan Cross sang Sieglinde to great critical acclaim, and in March 1939 there followed <span class="italic">Der Rosenkavalier</span> with her as the Marschallin. &#145;This and Sieglinde were her finest and most mature achievements&#146;, Clive Carey later wrote; and these roles pointed the direction for an international career which surely beckoned but which the advent of war in 1939 effectively prevented.<br>
<br>Sadler's Wells was bombed during the blitz on London, and autumn 1940 saw a skeleton company embarking on a programme of touring, at first with productions so small that they could be fitted into a lorry, and in towns often hit by bombing, but later, as civilian life stabilized, of a more ambitious nature. Joan Cross was seen as the obvious successor to Lilian Baylis, and soon after the start of wartime touring, Tyrone Guthrie, director of the Old Vic and Sadler's Wells, appointed her manager of the opera company. Seasons alternated between the New Theatre in London's St Martin's Lane and provincial theatres all over the country (in sixty-nine different towns in five years), and by 1943 the company had grown sufficiently to undertake a highly successful revival of <span class="italic">The Bartered Bride</span>, followed by <span class="italic">Cos&igrave; fan tutte</span> with Joan Cross as Fiordiligi. Her management was skilled enough to ensure that the company emerged from the war years in a solvent condition, something of a triumph for a manager singing roles in <span class="italic">Dido and Aeneas</span> and <span class="italic">The Beggar's Opera</span>, as well as giving regular performances of Butterfly, Violetta, the Countess, and Mimi.<br>
<br>The post-war years brought disappointments as well as triumphs for Joan Cross, and Sadler's Wells Theatre reopened with a mixture of the two. The premi&egrave;re of Benjamin Britten's <span class="italic">Peter Grimes</span> in June 1945 had Peter Pears in the title role and Joan Cross in the female lead of Ellen Orford, a role conceived by the composer specially for her. He drew on the compassion of a mature Violetta, harnessed the fire of Sieglinde, and reinvented the grand statement of the Marschallin in one great role to form the apogee of her career and the herald of the start of its last phase. Her choice, as manager, of <span class="italic">Peter Grimes</span> can with hindsight be perceived not only as the beginning of a new era for British opera but also as a triumph for the Sadler's Wells ensemble itself, but in fact it disrupted the company, who felt the choice as baffling as the music. Within a year Peter Pears, Reginald Goodall (who conducted the new opera), Eric Crozier (who directed it), Anna Pollak, and Joan Cross herself had left the company. She was henceforth to sing on stage very little opera apart from new works by Benjamin Britten, all tailored to her particular talents.<br>
<br>Glyndebourne, where Cross had rather surprisingly never sung before the war, was the scene of Britten's next two operas, <span class="italic">The Rape of Lucretia</span> (1946) and <span class="italic">Albert Herring</span> (1947), and the formation by Britten of the English Opera Group, which Cross joined. She sang respectively the Female Chorus and Lady Billows, the former a compassionate commentator on the brutal events of the story, the latter a comic representation of one side of her own character, a <i>grande dame</i> of considerable splendour and panache. In 1947 she produced for the newly formed Covent Garden Opera <span class="italic">Der Rosenkavalier</span> (but was sadly not asked to sing even a handful of performances of the Marschallin, her favourite role, which she had sung only seven times), and the same year sang Ellen Orford in a new production of <span class="italic">Peter Grimes</span>, a role which she had sung in Z&uuml;rich in 1946 and was to repeat at Covent Garden in two more seasons. A late climax to her career came with Britten's coronation opera, <span class="italic">Gloriana</span> (1953), whose premi&egrave;re in front of the young Queen Elizabeth was not without controversy, but whose title role, like that of Ellen Orford in <span class="italic">Peter Grimes</span>, was composed with Joan Cross's qualities very much in mind. It was written in an easy soprano tessitura, but its demands on a singer's expressive resources ran the gamut from the domineering monarch in public to the sensitivity of a woman of experience in the scenes with Essex, taking in the humility of a ruler praying for guidance, the serenity of a queen confident in her subjects' affections, and the agony of a woman confronting a decision which will eliminate danger but with it her last emotional prop. These demands she met, fortified perhaps for the extensive dialogue of the last scene by her Mary Stuart a few years earlier in Tyrone Guthrie's radio production of Schiller's play.<br>
<br>In 1954 Cross sang the last of her five Britten premi&egrave;res when she was Mrs Grose in <span class="italic">The Turn of the Screw</span>, an important role but secondary none the less. She took the hint and the following year bade farewell to the stage, initially with the Countess in <span class="italic">The Marriage of Figaro</span> at Covent Garden, a late backward glance at past Mozartian glories. &#145;Joan Cross's Countess &hellip; is a wonderful example of a character created <i>through</i> the music&#146;, wrote Andrew Porter in <span class="italic">Opera</span> magazine in July 1955;<blockquote>One cannot pretend that she sang her first aria well but thereafter schooling told; in many an ensemble passage, and particularly in &#145;Dove sono&#146;, the voice was beautifully placed, the tone often lovely. By handling Mozart's phrases as if they were precious objects, beautifully arranged, which the audience was to share in enjoying, she went to the heart of the music and the drama.</blockquote>After her last Mrs Grose at London's Scala Theatre in September 1955, Desmond Shawe-Taylor wrote regretfully in <span class="italic">Opera</span> (November 1955): &#145;the long narrative in the first act, in some ways the core of the whole work, was handled with such skill and subtlety, she was moreover in such fine voice.&#146;<br>
<br>Cross continued to work in the service of opera, but now as director, more often abroad (in the Netherlands, Scandinavia, and Canada) than in England, and as principal of the new Opera Studio, which she and Anne Wood had founded in 1948. About her work as a teacher, to which a large number of successful singers paid tribute, she said:<blockquote>I like to suggest &hellip; I've no patience or time unless there's talent &hellip; I do love talent! You can't teach people how to act; it must be in them. You can teach only the mechanics&#151;how to move, how to stand still.</blockquote>Her time with the Opera Studio and its successor ended when she and Anne Wood resigned in 1964 after a dispute with the board, which may have accounted for her appointment as CBE in 1951 never being followed up by the damehood which much of the operatic world, though never that nebulous entity known as the establishment, believed she deserved.<br>
<br>Joan Cross was a singer noted for subtle inflection of music and text rather than bold vocal assault, and for purity of singing line more than overwhelming vocal plenitude, and as an actress, for constant care for the development of character, in the manner of a stage play, rather than reliance on sheer physique, in the manner of film. She placed great emphasis as both performer and teacher on operatic craft, the matching of music and words, voice and movement, and, as well as a singer of real importance, she became an actress of consummate skill, in comedy as well as tragedy. Her place in English operatic history is substantiated not only by records&#151;although she was not a natural denizen of the studio&#151;but by more than a dozen premi&egrave;res and British first performances in a career lasting over forty years. She remained a formidable though much loved presence into her nineties, an involved observer of the operatic scene, and a keen, though usually constructive, critic. She died at her home, Garrett House, Park Road, Aldeburgh, Suffolk, on 12 December 1993, following a stroke, and was buried in Aldeburgh on 17 December. As a young woman she had married James Armstrong, but the marriage did not last long and she seldom referred to it. She had no children.<br>
