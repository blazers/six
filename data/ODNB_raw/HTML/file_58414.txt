<span class="headword">Bennett <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Rawlings]</span>,  Crystal-Margaret</span>  (1918&#150;1987), <span class="occ">archaeologist</span>, was born on 20 August 1918 in Alderney, the third of five children of George Rawlings, a soldier, and his wife Elizabeth (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Jennings). Educated at La Retraite Convent School and then Bristol University, where she received a bachelor's degree in English, she married Philip Roy Bennett (1907&#150;1986), a draughtsman, in 1940. He was an Anglican, and she converted from Roman Catholicism to the Church of England on his account. Their only child, Simon, was born in 1945, and they divorced in 1946.<br>
<br>Bennett's archaeological career began in 1954 at the Institute of Archaeology, University of London, where she took the postgraduate diploma in the archaeology of the Roman provinces in the west and later the diploma in Palestinian archaeology under Kathleen Kenyon. After directing two excavations at Roman sites in England she joined Kenyon's pioneering excavations at Jericho in Palestine in 1957.<br>
<br>In 1958, while taking part in excavations at Petra in Jordan, Bennett became interested in the Iron Age Edomite site of Umm al-Biyara in the centre of Petra. At the time little was known about the Edomites, the Iron Age inhabitants of southern Jordan, so she undertook excavations there between 1960 and 1965. Umm al-Biyara was an almost inaccessible rock massif; even donkeys were unable to climb it, and all water and supplies had to be carried by hand (or dropped by helicopter). The Edomites became the prime focus of her research from then on; she also excavated the Edomite sites of Tawilan (1968&#150;70, 1982) and Busayra, the probable capital of Edom (1971&#150;4, 1980). Her results considerably revised the generally accepted chronology of Edom, clearly dating Edomite pottery to the seventh century <span class="smallcap">BC</span>, rather than to the thirteenth century <span class="smallcap">BC</span> as previously thought. Although she published regular preliminary reports on her excavations in academic journals, she did not produce a final report for any of these sites. After her death this work passed to younger colleagues for completion.<br>
<br>Bennett was assistant director of the British School of Archaeology in Jerusalem from 1963 to 1965, and director from 1970 to 1980. After the Six Day War of 1967 and Israel's occupation of the West Bank it became difficult to cross from Jerusalem to Jordan, which affected the British School's archaeological work in Jordan. In 1970 she therefore set up at her own expense an office in Amman which acted as a base for British excavations in Jordan. In 1975 she was asked by the Jordanian department of antiquities to direct a rescue excavation on Amman citadel, prior to the building of a new museum. This work lasted three long seasons, the final results being published after her death by her assistant director. Bennett's experiences in Jordan convinced her that there was a real need for a permanent British archaeological body in the country, and together with Kenyon she persuaded the British Academy to found and fund the British Institute at Amman for Archaeology and History. Bennett served as its first director from 1980 to 1983.<br>
<br>Bennett was tall, well-built, provocative, and energetic, although late in life illness confined her to bed for long periods, even during excavations. At a politically difficult time she managed to remain friends with Israelis and Arabs, and was never shy of using her close friendship with the Jordanian royal family to solve seemingly intractable bureaucratic problems. She was generous to younger scholars, helping them to establish their own archaeological projects. She was made an OBE in 1980 for services to archaeology in Jordan and was awarded an honorary degree of DLitt by Trinity College, Dublin, in 1983. After a short retirement in Cyprus, she died of liver disease at her home, Tolbury House, Bruton, Somerset, on 12 August 1987, and was buried at Bruton on 17 August 1987.<br>
