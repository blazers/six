<span class="headword">McCracken,  Henry Joy</span>  (1767&#150;1798), <span class="occ">businessman and Irish nationalist</span>, was born at 39 High Street, Belfast, on 31 August 1767, the fifth child of Captain John McCracken (1721&#150;1803), shipowner and textile manufacturer, and his wife, Ann Joy (1730&#150;1814). Both the Joy and McCracken families were Presbyterian, industrious, and prominent; his mother was a great-granddaughter of George Martin, sovereign (mayor) of Belfast in 1645, and the daughter of Francis Joy, a public notary of Huguenot descent, and founder of one of Ireland's first newspapers, the <span class="italic">Belfast News-Letter</span>. In 1777 the families joined economic forces to create one of Belfast's first mechanical cotton-spinning mills, Joy, McCabe, and McCracken. McCracken displayed an early talent for mechanics and, following his education at a local school run by David Mason, was apprenticed to the family business: by 1789, he was managing the mill. A humane and popular employer, he followed in the philanthropic family tradition by creating a lending library for the poor, and in 1788 created, with his sister <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/47301/', "Mary Ann McCracken (1770&#150;1866)")</script>, social reformer, Belfast's first non-denominational Sunday school.<br>
<br>A crusader by temperament, McCracken was influenced by his family's advanced political ideas. In 1788 Belfast had been at the forefront of the volunteer movement. His father and four of his relatives were founding members of the 1st Belfast volunteer company, and an uncle, Henry Joy, had been a delegate to the Dungannon convention of February 1782, which had demanded greater legislative freedom for Ireland. His family, like many other Ulster Presbyterians, had sympathized with the rebellious American colonies, and McCracken later embraced the more revolutionary ideals of the French Revolution and the ideas of Tom Paine's <span class="italic">The Rights of Man</span>. After the Society of United Irishmen was formed in 1791, the McCracken family welcomed to Belfast the Dublin lawyer Theobald Wolfe Tone. Tone joined the society, was elected an honorary member of the 1st Belfast volunteer company, and began a chapter of the society in Dublin. Although not a founding member, McCracken formally joined the United Irishmen in March 1795, at a time when it was being reorganized into a secret revolutionary society dedicated to the military overthrow of British rule, with French aid, and the creation of an Irish republic.<br>
<br>Before Tone left Belfast for exile in Philadelphia, he, McCracken, and other Belfast radicals climbed Cave Hill in Belfast and swore an oath to undermine British rule and create a republic. While McCracken remained lukewarm to the notion of the necessity of obtaining French military aid, he played a crucial role in forging an alliance between the Catholic Defenders and the largely Presbyterian United Irishmen of Ulster. Before the French invasion fleet floundered outside Bantry Bay the authorities struck against the United Irishmen in the north: in October 1796 McCracken was arrested and imprisoned in Kilmainham gaol, Dublin. Although he initially refused to accept bail, his increasing ill health led him to accept bail and release in November 1797. Having returned to a province suffering under the full weight of the suspension of habeas corpus and the repressive measures carried out by the military under the provisions of the <span class="roman">Insurrection Act</span> of 1796, McCracken threw himself into the planning of a United Irishmen rebellion. Expecting another French invasion in the spring of 1798, the Ulster directory of the Society of United Irishmen dispatched McCracken to Dublin to help co-ordinate an effective rising.<br>
<br>On his return to Belfast, McCracken informed the Ulster leaders that an attack on Dublin, together with the simultaneous stopping of all mail-coaches to hamper government intelligence on 27 May, would signal a general uprising under the leadership of Lord Edward Fitzgerald. The betrayal of the Leinster directory to the authorities and the subsequent arrest of Fitzgerald led to the easy suppression of the Dublin revolt; yet, when a more serious and successful rebellion broke out in co. Wexford, on 26&#150;7 May, McCracken urged Robert Simms, the adjutant-general of Antrim, to mobilize forces. Dismayed at Simms's refusal, McCracken, by then deputy chief of the Antrim Defenders, pressed the issue and replaced Simms on 3 June, thereby becoming in effect the United Irish commander-in-chief in Ulster. The plans for an Ulster rising had already been betrayed to General George Nugent, but, having issued a stirring proclamation on 6 June, McCracken, with approximately 1500 men, attacked the county town of Antrim on 7 June.<br>
<br>In a short, sharp action, McCracken's forces initially captured the town in a battle which took the life of John, Lord O'Neill. They were eventually forced to retreat by the arrival of forces dispatched by Nugent, and a similar rising in co. Down was also defeated by Nugent at the battle of Ballynahinch on 12&#150;13 June. Following his defeat McCracken took refuge in the mountains outside Ballymena, hoping to secure passage to the United States. He was recognized by three Carrickfergus yeomen, and was arrested, brought to Belfast, and, following a court martial, hanged, to the great dismay of the townspeople, on 17 July 1798, outside the market house. As a final act of humanity, General Nugent allowed McCracken's body to be quickly cut down and entrusted to the care of his sister; he was buried the following day in St George's churchyard, Belfast.<br>
<br>Although McCracken never married, an illegitimate daughter was brought to Mary Ann McCracken two weeks following his execution. It is usually assumed that Mary Bodel was the mother, and the child, Maria, was brought up in the McCracken household, the constant companion of Mary Ann. In later life Maria married another Belfast radical, William McCleery. In 1998 the Republic of Ireland issued five commemorative stamps remembering the 1798 rising: one bore the portrait of the Ulster Presbyterian Henry Joy McCracken.<br>
