<span class="headword">Saulles,  George William  de</span>  (1862&#150;1903), <span class="occ">medallist</span>, was born on 4 February 1862 at Villa Street, Aston Manor, Birmingham, and baptized there on 13 April 1863 at St Philip's Church, the son of William Henry de Saulles, glass merchant, and his wife, Elizabeth Anne. His grandfather was French, or possibly Swiss, but his father had settled in Birmingham. He began his art training at the Birmingham School of Art under E. R. Taylor and gained several prizes there. He was then apprenticed to John Wilcox, die-sinker, in Birmingham, from whom he gained varied experience, including the execution of dies for large labels for Manchester manufactured goods, which sometimes included figures in their design. He moved to London in 1884, and worked for John H. Pinches, the die-engraver, then in Oxenden Street, Haymarket. In 1888 he returned to Birmingham and worked for Joseph Moore, the medallist.<br>
<br>During 1892 de Saulles was commissioned to work on new coinage for the Royal Mint, following the death of Leonard Charles Wyon, the chief engraver. In January 1893 he was appointed &#145;engraver to the mint&#146;  (<span class="italic">Annual Report of Deputy Master of the Mint</span>, 1893, 30), and from that time until his death was actively engaged in the production of dies for English and colonial coins and for official medals. He was a highly skilled craftsman who worked with great rapidity, and who designed, modelled, and engraved most of his dies. He was in some degree influenced by the French school of L. O. Roty and J. C. Chaplain, but in his official work there was little scope for innovation or the exercise of imagination.<br>
<br>De Saulles's medallic work between 1894 and 1903 included large numbers of official and private medals and several plaques, many of which were exhibited at the Royal Academy from 1898. Notable among these were the diamond jubilee medal of Queen Victoria (1897), the coronation medal of Edward VII (1902), and the Stokes jubilee medal with a portrait of Professor Nathaniel Stokes (1899).<br>
<br>De Saulles's first commission from the mint was to execute the dies for the new issue of coins of Queen Victoria in 1893, designed by Thomas Brock. He designed the Britannia reverse of the English bronze coins of 1895, and the issue of English coins made in 1902 after the accession of Edward VII. His signature on the coins is De S. He also designed and engraved the dies for various colonial coins, such as the British East Africa copper coins (1897), the British Honduras coins (1894), and the British dollar for India (1895). He made the last great seal of Queen Victoria (1899), and many designs for official seals for the colonies. At the time of his death he was preparing the models for the great seals of the United Kingdom and those of Ireland and Scotland, subsequently executed by F. Bowcher. (His work is listed in more detail by Pinches, 312&#150;13; Hocking, 2.301; and Brown, vols. 2&#150;3.)<br>
<br>De Saulles was regarded as a kind-natured man and was entirely devoted to his profession. He died on 22 July 1903 at his home, 31 Fairfax Road, Bedford Park, Chiswick, and was buried on 25 July in the churchyard of St Nicholas's, Chiswick. He left a widow, Myra Elizabeth. Works and designs on paper by de Saulles are among records of the mint at the Public Record Office, London.<br>
