<span class="headword">King,  Gregory</span>  (1648&#150;1712), <span class="occ">herald and political economist</span>, was born at Lichfield, Staffordshire, on 15 December 1648, the eldest son of Gregory King (<i>fl</i>. 1648&#150;1668), who was originally from Leicester, and his first wife, Elizabeth Andrews (<i>d</i>. 1668) of Sandwich in Kent. King's later criticisms of his father, who was a mathematician and surveyor, might cast doubt on the statement that &#145;he was packt away to school at two years of age&#146;  (King, &#145;Miscellaneous notes&#146;, xxvi) but certainly he was a student at Lichfield Free School (the grammar school) between the ages of five and fourteen, though in his last two years there he began to help his father with work. At school King excelled, becoming skilled in Greek, Hebrew, and Latin, and he was about to go to university when his father agreed to a suggestion that he become a clerk to the herald William Dugdale.<h2>
<a name="Cartographyandheraldsoffice"></a>Cartography and herald's office</h2>What might be called King's apprenticeship decisively influenced his life's course. On Dugdale's visitations to scrutinize pedigrees of the &eacute;lite he acquired a detailed knowledge of local and family circumstances, of the nature of communities, and of the increasingly uncertain interplay of wealth and status. He spent five years criss-crossing the northern counties of England, finding the time to learn French and develop some skills as an artist. In 1667, with Dugdale's visitations complete, King was recommended to Lord Hatton, whom for two years he helped with his antiquarian interests. Between 1669 and 1670 King was back in Lichfield, doing odd jobs, before he secured a position as steward, auditor, and secretary to Dowager Lady Gerard at Sandon in Staffordshire.<br>
<br>In 1672 King left provincial England and the service of the well-to-do for London. There he renewed his acquaintances among the heralds, securing a recommendation to John Ogilby, the printer and cartographer. For Ogilby he initially undertook some minor engravings, including for Sir Peter Leycester's <span class="italic">Historical Antiquities</span> (1673). But Ogilby, who in 1671 had obtained a royal warrant for a survey of Britain with a view to publishing a book of maps, soon came to make much greater use of King. King helped to map Essex, digested the notes of the other surveyors, and, critically, in 1672 and 1673 joined Christopher Wren, John Aubrey, and Robert Hooke on a small committee with links to the Royal Society to draw up a questionnaire to be circulated to elicit information for Ogilby's planned <span class="italic">Britannia</span>. Though shelved, the twenty-two queries were used later in structuring King's exercises in political arithmetic. Indeed, cartography played as important a role in forming King's view of English society as his interest in heraldry. Detailed maps he produced of London and Westminster at this time added considerably to his knowledge of town life (the capital then accounted for about ten per cent of England's population) and he was involved in much other map making besides. He also worked with John Adams, whose <span class="italic">Index villaris</span>, first published in 1680, listed villages, towns, and cities as well as country seats, and depended in part upon an analysis of hearth tax materials.<br>
<br>Between 1675 and 1680 King spent much of his time as an engraver, often of maps, and was involved in a major survey of the new development of Soho in London&#151;Soho Square initially took his name as King Square. But he remained in touch with his connections at the heralds' office. In ill health Francis Sandford, Rouge Dragon pursuivant, often turned to King for help, notably for his <span class="italic">Genealogical history of the kings of England, and monarchs of Great Britain, &amp;c. from the conquest to the year 1677</span> (1677). And Thomas Lee, Chester herald, began to make use of King. Through Lee's patronage in May 1677 King took over Sandford's office when Sandford became Lancaster herald, and until 1694 was very active in heraldic matters, becoming registrar of the College of Arms in 1684 and Lancaster herald himself when Sandford resigned, unable to accept the accession of William and Mary in 1689. Consequently King went on further visitations to the midland counties and to London, helped organize the coronations of James II and William III and Mary II, and produced with Sandford the luxurious <span class="italic">History of the Coronation of &hellip; James II</span> (1687). He also undertook three trips to Europe, taking part in the investitures of the Garter of the elector of Brandenburg in 1689, the duke of Celle in 1691, and the elector of Saxony in 1692&#150;3.<h2>
<a name="Politicalarithmetic"></a>Political arithmetic</h2>In 1694 King was a leading keeper of the flame of ceremony, hierarchy, and of form, but a dispute with the earl marshal over arrangements for Queen Mary's lavish funeral in 1695 put a stop to his heraldic career. It was also at this point that his autobiography ends (it was perhaps written then). It is a sad irony that from then until his death, a period when he produced the works for which he is now best-known, his pioneering exercises in political arithmetic, details of his life are scanty and highly fragmentary. What is clear is that between 1694 and his death in 1712 King was much involved in producing and analysing statistics for various areas of central government. Along with Blathwayt, Lowndes, and Davenant, King was one of a small band of dedicated public servants at the forefront of expanding and overhauling the institutions of the state as it waged two terrible wars against France, the greatest European power of the period. King's contribution, however, was wholly distinctive, for he developed political arithmetic, &#145;the art of reasoning by figures, upon things relating to government&#146;, in important new ways  (C. Davenant, <span class="italic">The Political and Commercial Works of that Celebrated Writer Charles D'Avenant</span>, ed. C. Whitworth, 5 vols., 1771, 1.128).<br>
<br>King's political arithmetic was notably wide-ranging. For the newly formed Board of Trade he produced an analysis of the population of Gloucester in 1696 and in the following year a valuable survey of almshouses and &#145;hospitals&#146; that contributed to their analysis of poor relief; in 1697 he compiled an account &#145;Of the naval trade of England&#146; for 1688; he was secretary to the commissioners for public accounts, probably in 1702&#150;6 and 1708&#150;12; in 1705&#150;6 and 1710 he was secretary to the comptroller of the army accounts (with an annual salary of &pound;300); in 1708 he became a commissioner to state William III's debts; and in 1710 he produced a paper detailing income inequality among the clergy for the governors for Queen Anne's Bounty. Whatever the many merits of these efforts King is undoubtedly best known for his &#145;Natural and political observations upon the state and condition of England, 1696&#146;, probably produced for Robert Harley, then a leading figure in the country &#145;party&#146; that was so critical of William III's financial administration. This is an invaluable document, mainly an exercise in demography, that attempted to estimate population size, its distribution between town and countryside, household size, age distribution, marriage patterns, and birth and death rates. Further guesses are provided of the housing stock, agricultural land use, livestock, and output, various tax revenues, and wealth.<br>
<br>At the heart of the &#145;Observations&#146; is King's famous social table, &#145;A scheme of the income and expense of the several families of England calculated for the year 1688&#146;. Here he estimated patterns of household size and income and expenses per head for twenty-six social groups, from temporal peers to vagrants. Historians have long valued the picture this provides of late seventeenth-century society, even though it has obvious inaccuracies (despite being rooted in tax data derived from poll taxes and assessments of marriages, births, and burials). It shows one well-informed view of hierarchy, of the relationship between income and status, and of the extraordinary degree of inequality which then existed. It also betrays a number of common assumptions of the propertied. The poor are judged to be decreasing the wealth of the nation, eminent merchants are placed lower in the pecking order than less prosperous gentlemen, poor clergy are superior to richer freeholders, and, most notably, the poorer half of society is encapsulated in only five categories: common seamen, labouring people and outservants, cottagers and paupers, common soldiers, and vagrants.<br>
<br>King's political arithmetic was highly original and he had no peer until the flowering of the nineteenth-century statistical movement. In the first place he was distinguished by tying his calculations closely to detailed available evidence, often by imaginative use of tax records, though his earlier work as a herald and cartographer was also vital. If King's political arithmetic was more ambitious than that of any other contemporary it was also more securely based and, in that sense, he is better seen as a successor to John Graunt than to Sir William Petty, aspiring to work within the methodological framework championed in the early seventeenth century by Francis Bacon. Second, if he frequently sought to depict the nation as a whole, and sought after generalizations, he well knew that a country was but a collection of individuals, families, and parishes&#151;he made detailed studies of his own family and over a dozen particular communities, including London, a point often overlooked because of the innovative modes of categorization King developed in order to produce generalizations. Third, the breadth of his estimates, and a sense of the interrelationships within society, was distinctive; he attempted to see the nation as an integrated whole and worked hard, if not always successfully, to ensure the internal consistency of his estimates. One particular aspect of this which has proved particularly durable was the so-called &#145;King&#150;Davenant law of demand&#146;, which related grain prices to harvest yields. Finally, he was notable for considering how populations changed over time and attempting crude comparisons between the fortunes of England, France, and Holland. Despite his ambitions there is little doubt that King appreciated the limitations of his approach. His meticulous notebooks show a high degree of speculation and a search for the credible. His close, neat hand suggests to those of a graphological bent a precise, fastidious, not to say obsessive man. Yet his final calculations are often heavily rounded, for anything more detailed would be illusory.<br>
<br>Assessing the importance of King's political arithmetic to contemporaries is very difficult, not least because of the suspicion that only a fraction of his calculations has survived. Moreover, if Harley and Sir Stephen Fox at the Treasury saw some of these, his calculations were very largely unpublished at the time, save some extracts in Davenant's <span class="italic">Essay upon the Probable Methods of Making a People Gainers in the Ballance of Trade</span> (1699). Rather, King's influence is glimpsed by the various offices he held, by the stimulating effect he clearly had upon the likes of Davenant, through odd references of esteem such as that by Leibniz, and his salary. Consequently, with his death and the passing of the generation of politicians he had worked for his name rapidly faded. It was rediscovered at the end of the eighteenth century when political arithmetic was once again consciously and enthusiastically championed. In 1793 James Dallaway's survey of the history of heraldry in England printed King's autobiography and nine years later George Chalmers first published King's &#145;Natural and political observations&#146;. Since then King's importance as an acute observer of England has been widely acknowledged, though modern research has sometimes revised his estimates.<br>
<br>As a person King is largely anonymous (very little private correspondence survives) though his public work suggests much about the private man: careful, painstaking, cautious, conservative. In religion he was for the Church of England and, though against James II's religious policies, was, because of his &#145;great respect to the succession of the Crown by legal descent&#146;  (King, &#145;Miscellaneous notes&#146;, xxxviii), unenthusiastic about the succession of William III and Mary II in 1689&#151;it is notable that he held office mostly during the years of tory supremacy under Queen Anne. He was a man of some substance, a property owner, stockholder in the East India Company, and governor of St Bartholomew's Hospital. He was twice married, first on 20 July 1674 to Anne, daughter of John Powel of Tirley in Gloucestershire, and then in 1701 to Frances Grattam, with whom he had three children who all died young. King died in London on 29 December 1712 and was buried in the chancel of St Benet Paul's Wharf, London, the parish where he had lived for some years. An epitaph there by his second wife justly celebrated him as &#145;a skilful herald, a good accomptant, surveyor, and mathematician, a curious penman, and well versed in political arithmetic&#146;  (ibid., xlviii).<br>
