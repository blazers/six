<span class="headword">Deacon,  Henry</span>  (1822&#150;1876), <span class="occ">chemist and manufacturer</span>, was born on 30 July 1822 in London, the elder son of Henry Deacon, merchant, and his wife and cousin, Esther Deacon. The Deacons belonged to the Sandemanian church, whose most famous member, Michael Faraday, took an interest in their son. When he was fourteen Deacon was apprenticed to Galloway &amp; Sons, a London engineering firm: when it failed, Faraday arranged for him to join Nasmyth and Gaskell at Patricroft, near Manchester. They supplied machinery to Pilkingtons of St Helens, where Deacon moved after completing his apprenticeship in the early 1840s. He became manager of the glass-polishing department and their highest-paid employee, but left in 1851 to work for John Hutchinson, a Widnes alkali manufacturer.<br>
<br>In 1853 Deacon filed his first patent (for an improved sulphuric acid manufacturing process) and established an alkali works in Widnes with William Pilkington. This unhappy partnership was dissolved in 1855, and Deacon, with his former employer Holbrook Gaskell, founded Gaskell, Deacon &amp; Co. He experimented unsuccessfully with the ammonia-soda process (later perfected by others), but for mass production of alkali he relied on the proven method invented by N. Leblanc, which generated quantities of hydrochloric acid. C. Dunlop and Walter Weldon had devised methods for converting this noxious waste to chlorine (which could be profitably combined with lime to make bleaching powder) but they were both expensive and wasteful. About 1867 Deacon, assisted by Ferdinand Hurter, began seeking a better way: in 1870 they claimed success. The Deacon process used a cheaper catalyst (copper chloride) and recovered more chlorine; it remained industrially important for five decades, though its adoption was initially delayed owing to its complexity.<br>
<br>Deacon married Emma Wade of Basford, Nottinghamshire, on 4 December 1851. They had two sons and a daughter. After his first wife's death, Deacon married Caroline Rutt of Islington, London, on 27 November 1866. Deacon accumulated a fortune in excess of &pound;100,000, but his health was weakened by overwork and he died of typhoid on 23 July 1876 at his home, Appleton House, Widnes. He was survived by his widow and seven sons and five daughters, some of whom may have been from his previous marriage.<br>
