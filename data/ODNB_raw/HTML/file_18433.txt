<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Mayhew,  Henry</span>  (1812&#150;1887), <span class="occ">author and social reformer</span>, was born in London on 25 November 1812, the son of Joshua Dorset Joseph Mayhew (<i>d</i>. 1858) and Mary Ann Fenn. He was educated at Westminster School from 1822 to 1827, and began his writing career shortly thereafter, at the age of sixteen, according to his son Athol.<br>
<br>One of seventeen children and the fourth of seven sons (among his siblings were <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18434/', "Horace Mayhew")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18432/', "Augustus Mayhew")</script>), Mayhew failed to live up to his father's expectations; a prominent solicitor and a rigid patriarch, Joshua Mayhew apprenticed each of his sons to the law, and each, except one, eventually pursued other interests. Almost all of them, including Henry, were disinherited as a result (after his father's death, Henry received a legacy of &pound;1 per week). Henry was particularly ill-suited to legal study, and nearly caused Joshua's arrest by neglecting to file some important documents. This d&eacute;b&acirc;cle led to expatriation in Paris for a period, where he formed a close circle with Douglas Jerrold and William Thackeray.<br>
<br>Back in London in the late 1820s Mayhew and his friend Gilbert &Agrave; Beckett conceived and edited the popular weekly <span class="italic">Figaro in London</span>, a journal based on the French <span class="italic">Le Figaro</span>. About this time Mayhew also began to explore writing for the stage; he is responsible for the well-received&#151;and, even by today's standards, funny&#151;farce <span class="italic">The Wandering Minstrel</span> (1834), and he co-wrote plays with Henry Baylis (<span class="italic">But However</span>&#151;, 1838), and others. In fact, Mayhew may be considered a significant contributor to the Victorian theatre, although little critical attention has been paid to his plays in the twentieth century.<br>
<br>In 1841 Mayhew embarked on one of his most important journalistic ventures: the hugely successful magazine <span class="italic">Punch</span>. Co-edited by Mayhew, Mark Lemon, and Stirling Coyne, <span class="italic">Punch</span> solicited and printed articles by talented young writers such as Jerrold, Thackeray, Henry's brother Horace Mayhew, and &Agrave; Beckett. In 1842 Lemon became sole editor, and Mayhew increasingly drifted away from the magazine. That same year he began serial publication of <span class="italic">What to Teach, and How to Teach It</span>, followed in 1844 by <span class="italic">The Prince of Wales's Primer</span>. Neither serial was completed.<br>
<br>This faltering energy was typical of Mayhew, who was indolent and undirected, if prolific. Even his marriage, on 20 April 1844, to <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/14789/', "Douglas Jerrold's")</script> daughter Jane Matilda (1825&#150;1880) was uneven, interrupted periodically by separations, and ended, practically speaking, by a final separation in the late 1860s, at which point Jane moved in with their daughter, Amy. The first of these separations may well have been instigated by his 1846 bankruptcy, a result of lavish housekeeping and the failure of the journal devoted to railway news, <span class="italic">Iron Times</span>, he had started with the publisher Thomas Lyttleton Holt.<br>
<br>In spite of the personal and financial difficulties which plagued him throughout his life, Mayhew produced some important work. His <span class="italic">London Labour and the London Poor</span> (2 vols., 1851; reissued with additions, 1861, 1862, 1864, 1865) remains a seminal study of London street life in the middle of the century, and has been often reprinted. It is required reading for anyone interested in the minutest details of Victorian lower-class life, such as what kinds of foods were sold on the streets, how financial transactions with street-sellers were conducted, and how vendors &#145;cried&#146; their wares. Mayhew provided &#145;in embryo at least &hellip; a theory of the specificity of the London economy which in turn made intelligible the economic behaviour of the London poor&#146;  (Jones, 263). The study had its origin in a series of eighty-two articles, published from October 1849 through December 1850, entitled &#145;Labour and the poor&#146;, in the <span class="italic">Morning Chronicle</span> (Mayhew was its metropolitan correspondent). The series was hugely popular, attracting enthusiastic letters from readers and resulting in the establishment of a special Labour and the Poor Fund.<br>
<br>In late 1850 Mayhew left the <span class="italic">Chronicle</span> over a political dispute; according to a recent biography, the magazine strongly supported free trade, while the radical Mayhew, probably as a result of his two years among the working class, opposed it on the grounds that international competition compromised workers' wages. When the <span class="italic">Chronicle</span> published articles promoting its position, Mayhew walked out. His friend H. Sutherland Edwards tells a different story: that, according to Mayhew, the <span class="italic">Chronicle's</span> editor refused to expose the sub-standard working conditions in a Regent Street tailor's establishment on the grounds that the business advertised regularly in the <span class="italic">Chronicle</span>. In any case, it was only after leaving the newspaper that he developed his earlier work and produced, initially as a serial from December 1850 to February 1852, the study that became <span class="italic">London Labour and the London Poor</span>.<br>
<br>Mayhew's journalistic achievements were considerable. He edited several publications, including <span class="italic">Figaro in London</span> (1835&#150;8), <span class="italic">Punch</span> (1841&#150;2), the <span class="italic">Comic Almanack</span> (1850&#150;51), and the <span class="italic">Morning News</span> (1859). He also, of course, contributed to the periodical press, writing articles for the <span class="italic">Morning Chronicle</span>, <span class="italic">Bentley's Miscellany</span>, and the <span class="italic">Edinburgh News and Literature Chronicle</span>. Among his fiction works are several novels, co-authored with his brother Augustus and published under the name the Brothers Mayhew. These include the notably titled <span class="italic">Whom to Marry and How to Get Married, or, The Adventures of a Lady in Search of a Good Husband</span> (1848) and <span class="italic">The image of his father, or, One boy is more trouble than a dozen girls, being a tale of a young monkey</span> (1848). He also wrote travel literature, including several titles on Germany that achieved wide contemporary notice, and children's books, such as <span class="italic">Young Benjamin Franklin</span> (1861).<br>
<br>Mayhew's work influenced contemporary literature and popular entertainments as readily as it helped to shape Victorian social theories. Many literary representations of the working class were indebted to Mayhew's sketches; Dickens's certainly were, and the same might be said for any number of novels with lower-working-class characters produced during and after the 1840s. Equally indebted was the stage: plays such as J. B. Johnstone's <span class="italic">How we Live in London</span> (1856) and J. Elphinstone's <span class="italic">London Labour and the London Poor, or, Want and Vice</span> (1854), to name only two, drew liberally on Mayhew's characterizations, as did legions of music-hall patter singers and songs. It is also possible, however, that Mayhew himself drew on English popular entertainments as well as on the testimonies of his subjects in creating the personae in <span class="italic">London Labour</span>. Lower-class characters had been represented on the stage as comic, loose, or slick talkers for centuries prior to Mayhew's day, and this at least complicates his affiliation of street folk with these eccentric idioms. However he derived them, the subjects of <span class="italic">London Labour</span> are vivid and unforgettable.<br>
<br>Mayhew's corpus of published works was extensive. He wrote to instruct and entertain, producing not only popular farces and comic novels but educational children's books and serious journalistic prose as well. He contributed richly to the Victorian cultural scene, continuing to write well into his later years. He died at 8 Tavistock Street, Holborn, London, on 25 July 1887, leaving a very modest personal estate, and was buried at Kensal Green cemetery.<br>
