<span class="headword">Pym, Sir  William</span>  (1772&#150;1861), <span class="occ">military surgeon</span>, son of Joseph Pym of Pinley, Warwickshire, and his wife, daughter of Thomas Arnott MD, of Cupar, Fife, was born in Edinburgh in January 1772. He was the elder brother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22927/', "Sir Samuel Pym")</script>. William was educated at Edinburgh University and then entered the medical department of the army. He served with the 35th and 70th regiments of foot, and from 1794 to 1796 was in medical charge during an epidemic of yellow fever in Martinique, when it is estimated that nearly 16,000 troops died. Pym thus obtained an unparalleled knowledge of yellow fever. He also served in Sicily, Malta, and in Gibraltar, where he acted as medical adviser to the governor, the duke of Kent. He became deputy inspector-general of army hospitals in 1810, and in 1811 was president of the board of health in Malta.<br>
<br>Pym returned to England in 1812 and lived in London, but in 1813 returned to Malta, where plague was raging. In September 1816 he became inspector-general of army hospitals. In 1815 he published <span class="italic">Observations upon the Bulam Fever</span>, one of the first comprehensive accounts of the disease now known as yellow fever. In this work Pym maintained: that it was a disease <i>sui generis</i> known by the name of African, yellow, or bulam fever, and was the <i>v&oacute;mito prieto</i> of the Spaniards, being attended with that peculiar and fatal symptom the &#145;black vomit&#146;; that it was highly infectious; that its infectious powers were increased by heat and destroyed by cold; that it attacked natives of warm climates in a comparatively mild form; and that it had also a singular and peculiar character, attacking, as in a case of smallpox, the human frame only once. The work attracted considerable criticism, and the ensuing debate was illustrative of the confusion over the nature of tropical diseases at the time.<br>
<br>In 1826 Pym was appointed superintendent-general of quarantine, and in 1831 he was made a knight commander of the Hanoverian order. During the cholera epidemic of 1832 he served as chairman of the central board of health. In 1845 the ship <i>Eclair</i>, paralysed by an outbreak of yellow fever, was refused permission to land at Haslar by the quarantine officer, on the grounds that yellow fever was contagious. This was contested by Sir William Burnett and Alexander Bryson of the navy, who perceived the disease to be non-infectious. In 1848 Pym published an enlarged edition of his book on yellow fever, in which he reviewed Burnett and Bryson's <span class="italic">Report on the Climate and Principal Diseases of the African Station</span> (1847), and reiterated his belief in the contagious nature of the disease.<br>
<br>Pym died of a stroke on 18 March 1861 at his house in Upper Harley Street, London.<br>
