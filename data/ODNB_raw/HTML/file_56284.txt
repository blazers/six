<span class="headword">Pochin <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Heap]</span>,  Agnes</span>  (1825&#150;1908), <span class="occ">campaigner for women's rights</span>, was the youngest daughter of George Gretton Heap, manufacturer, and his wife, Hannah, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Lord (1813&#150;1878). She was born at Ryefield, Timperley, Cheshire, on 25 November 1825, and had three brothers and four sisters. A woman of slight physique but great determination of character, on 20 April 1852 in a Unitarian ceremony she married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/47964/', "Henry Davis Pochin (1824&#150;1895)")</script>. His successful career in Manchester as an industrial chemist was already well established, and he later became a Liberal MP. Agnes's sister was the widow of Pochin's partner. The Pochins lived at Broughton Old Hall, Salford, and had many children, most of whom died in infancy. Three survived those dangerous first years: Walter (1853&#150;1867), Laura Elizabeth (1854&#150;1933) (later <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/58228/', "Laura McLaren, Lady Aberconway")</script>), and Percival Gerald (1862&#150;1918).<br>
<br>Although nothing is known of Agnes Pochin's upbringing and education, it gave her, or did not prevent her from developing, an ability to think clearly and imaginatively, free from the shibboleths of the day. In 1855 she wrote, as Justitia, <span class="italic">The Right of Women to Exercise the Elective Franchise</span>, a pamphlet published by Chapman and Hall. This was one of the earliest tracts on women's suffrage to appear in the nineteenth century. Although it was acknowledged at the end of the century by such women of perception as Elizabeth Wolstenholme Elmy and Helen Blackburn, and although it had been reprinted in 1873 under Mrs Pochin's own name, it has been overlooked by most twentieth-century commentators. In her essay Agnes Pochin argues cogently, with verve and wit, that women should have the right to the parliamentary franchise on the same conditions as men, that mere sex should be considered no barrier in the recognition of talent, that women should have the same rights to divorce as men, that marriage should not necessarily put a stop to a woman's career, and that a woman's education should train her for a career. She writes:<blockquote>Woman's life in the middle classes is, and has been rendered, essentially a dull one. The necessity she is thought to be under of confining herself almost exclusively to one spot; the little variety she sees, whether of scene or character; the small number of her Creator's works upon which she is permitted to render her perceptive faculties; her entire withdrawal from the investigation of her Creator's laws; the necessity she is under of conforming to a stereotyped conventional standard of character &hellip; all combine to produce what may be emphatically designated a dull life. (<span class="italic">The Right of Women to Exercise the Elective Franchise</span>, 1855, 31)</blockquote>When John Bright introduced his <span class="roman">Reform Bill</span> in 1858 Agnes Pochin tried, unsuccessfully, to persuade him to include a clause on women's suffrage. She persisted in her campaign, and in April 1868 sat on the platform of the Free Trade Hall in Manchester during the first public meeting devoted to women's suffrage. She introduced the second resolution of the evening, Lydia Becker having moved the first. Her husband, then mayor of Salford, chaired the meeting. She was an early member of the Manchester Society for Women's Suffrage, and in 1872 was a member of the newly formed executive committee of the central committee of the National Society for Women's Suffrage. She and her husband were on the radical wing of the Liberal Party, and at a public meeting held by the central committee in July 1872 she remarked that it would be well on some future occasion to make some appeal to the working classes in the interests of women's suffrage. In the early 1850s her husband had founded the Salford Working Men's College and by 1860 Mrs Pochin, putting principle into practice, was teaching classes of girls.<br>
<br>The Pochins left Salford in 1870 and moved to Barn Elms, in Surrey, which they leased until 1884. In 1874 they bought the Bodnant estate in the Conwy valley; Agnes does not appear to have taken any decisive part in the development of the now-famed gardens. She died there on 12 February 1908, some dozen years after her husband, and was buried in the family mausoleum, The Poem.<br>
