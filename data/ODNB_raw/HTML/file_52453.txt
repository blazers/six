<span class="headword">Turner, Sir  George</span>  (1851&#150;1916), <span class="occ">politician in Australia</span>, was born in Melbourne, Australia, on 8 August 1851, the only child of English parents Alfred Turner, a cabinet-maker, and his wife, Ruth Dick. He was educated at the National Model School, Melbourne, but left at the age of fourteen to work in the office of John Edwards, a solicitor. On 10 August 1872 he married 21-year-old Rosa, the daughter of John Morgan, a potter from Devon; they had a son and a daughter. Turner matriculated in 1874, took the articled clerk's course, and was admitted to practice in 1881, when he went into partnership with Samuel Lyons to form the legal firm of Lyons and Turner. He was involved in various lodges and friendly societies, notably the Australian Natives' Association, an organization of people born in Australia which became politically very important in this period.<br>
<br>Turner was an elected member of the St Kilda local government council (1886&#150;1900), and was mayor in 1897. In 1889 he entered the legislative assembly of the Victorian parliament as member for St Kilda, having campaigned as a Liberal Protectionist. In what were politically unstable times he served as minister for customs and commissioner for trade in the Munro government (1890), posts he retained in the Shiels government (1892). With the defeat of the Shiels government by James Patterson in 1893, Turner reluctantly became leader of the opposition Liberal Party when the leading Liberal, Alfred Deakin, a trusted colleague of Turner, refused the position. On the defeat of the government in September 1894, at a time of severe economic depression, Turner became the first Australian-born premier of Victoria. This dour, steady plodder, who lacked the oratorical skills of some of his contemporaries, was an unlikely leader. However, to a public shocked by the boom and the consequent depression, his down-to-earth, businesslike approach, retrenching and cutting expenditure, was appealing. Beatrice Webb, on meeting Turner in 1898, described him in her diary as &#145;a modest unassuming businessman, a solicitor by profession, who has gained the approbation of the majority of the people and of the House by his cautious administration, his plain business ways and his indomitable industry&#146;  (Webb and Webb, 66). Mindful of public opinion, Turner was pragmatic in gaining political support and tenacious in resolving issues, and was beholden to Deakin and to David Syme, the proprietor of <span class="italic">The Age</span> newspaper. He gained the respect and confidence of the state and was re-elected in 1897. While restoration of fiscal confidence was his main contribution, during his premiership some notable legislation was passed, including, in 1896, the <span class="roman">Factories and Shops Act</span>, which reduced &#145;sweated labour&#146;, and savings bank legislation, and, three years later, the abolition of plural voting. While by temperament cautious, as the Melbourne <span class="italic">Age</span> wrote in its obituary (14 August 1916), &#145;his liberalism led him often to the left wing of his party&#146;, and his willingness to accommodate Labor Party members and his support for old-age pensions are indicative of this.<br>
<br>In June 1897 Turner went with other colonial premiers to Britain for Queen Victoria's diamond jubilee celebration, and was appointed privy councillor and KCMG and received an honorary LLD from both Oxford and Cambridge universities. He also became an important figure in the federation movement, attending the federal councils of 1895 and 1897. In 1898 he was elected (topping the poll) to represent Victoria in the national convention to frame a federal constitution, and the following year he became president of the council. He worked with Deakin, Isaacs, and Peacock and leaders from other states in the difficult and tortuous negotiations leading to federation, and was often an important &#145;solvent&#146; and behind-the-scenes negotiator. His contribution to the federal movement has often been underestimated, and, as Deakin wrote in his <span class="italic">Federal Story</span> (1944), his &#145;sterling qualities of fairness, thoroughness, sincerity and reliability shone&#146;  (Deakin, 85), especially in contrast to others such as the flamboyant Reid.<br>
<br>In Victoria in October 1899 Turner was temporarily dislodged by disaffected rural conservatives led by McLean, but was restored to office in November 1900. When he resigned in 1901 to stand for the federal seat of Balaclava he was the longest-serving Victorian premier. He declined to work with Lyne, who tried to form the first federal ministry (the Hopetoun blunder), but became the first commonwealth treasurer in the Barton ministry (1901&#150;3); he also served in the Deakin ministry and later in the Reid ministry. Sound in finance and an able administrator, he was a successful treasurer and, as mentioned in <span class="italic">The Age</span> obituary, established a &#145;tradition of economy, laid the foundations of honest book keeping and gave clear full official statements of expenditure&#146;. He brought in the first four federal budgets. He became an influential and trusted member, and it surprised nobody when the Watson Labor ministry invited him to continue as treasurer, though he refused.<br>
<br>In declining health, Turner retired at the election of 1906. He resumed his law practice and became chairman of commissioners of the State Savings Bank of Victoria. His son was killed in a train accident in 1908. Turner himself died from heart disease on 13 August 1916 at his Hawthorn home, Summerlea, 78 Riversdale Road (he had moved from St Kilda in 1904), survived by his wife and daughter. He was buried with Church of England rites at the St Kilda cemetery on 15 August.<br>
<br>Dull and prosaic in manner, Turner had a high-pitched, almost falsetto voice, and his speeches were devoid of ornament. Deakin described him as<blockquote>the ideal bourgeois, who married early and who was in dress, manner and habits, exactly on the same level as the shopkeepers and prosperous artisans who were his ratepayers and constituents. He was also bourgeois in his uprightness, straightforwardness, domestic happiness and regularity of habits. His facility of work was enormous, his love of detail great. (Deakin, 66)</blockquote>Physically Turner was a big man, bespectacled, with a large head and a bristling moustache. An able yet underrated politician, administratively and financially competent, he was an important figure in achieving federation and in establishing the commonwealth government.<br>
