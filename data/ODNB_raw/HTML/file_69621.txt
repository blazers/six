<span class="headword">Davis,  Fred</span>  (1913&#150;1998), <span class="occ">billiards and snooker player</span>, was born on 14 August 1913 at The Moor, Newbold, Whittington, Derbyshire, the youngest of the six children of Fred Davis, innkeeper, and his wife, Ann Eliza Clark. He learned to play snooker on a miniature table at home, and then in the billiard hall in Chesterfield owned by his parents. His ability was overshadowed by that of his eldest brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/31013/', "Joseph (Joe) Davis")</script>, who won his first world championship in 1928. Fred Davis won his first major title the following year, at the age of sixteen, when he became world junior professional billiards champion (a title he held on two further occasions). Joe was critical of his younger brother: Fred, he believed, did not take the game seriously enough, and smiled too much in practice and in competition. But Joe recognized Fred's inherent skill: &#145;Fred was the greatest technician in the profession&#146;, he said.<blockquote>His cue action and stance was near perfect and when in form he never batted an eyelid or moved his head or body so much as a millimetre &hellip; if he had a flaw in his make up it was a tendency to be temperamental, at times giving the impression he could not care less. (Davis, 176)</blockquote>But, as Fred's opponents often testified, this easy manner and ever present smile concealed a steely determination to succeed: the (unrelated) snooker player Steve Davis remarked that &#145;He'd be smiling while kicking you in the teeth. He'd smile when concentrating on his shot&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Independent</span>).<br>
<br>Fred Davis arrived on the billiards scene just as the sport was losing its popularity, and did not compete again until 1937, when he reappeared as a snooker player at the world professional snooker championships; he lost 17&#150;14 in the first round to Bill Withers. His performance was undermined by his myopia, which made it difficult for him to focus on the balls for any length of time; the condition was later remedied with the use of a revolutionary pair of swivel-lensed spectacles. His playing improved immediately, and in the world championships of 1940 he lost to his brother Joe in the final by only one frame. On 15 July 1940 Davis married Sheila Goodacre (<i>b</i>. 1913/14); they had two daughters. During the Second World War Davis served in the army with the 3rd airborne division.<br>
<br>After the war Joe went into semi-retirement; although Fred no longer had to compete directly with his brother, Joe's status as the undefeated world champion continued to cast a shadow over Fred's achievements. Fred Davis won the first of his eight world championship titles in 1948 by beating Walter Donaldson 84&#150;61. He won again in the following year, and in every year between 1951 and 1956. The world championships were dropped after 1957, when only four players entered the competition. Television saw no future in snooker as a televised sport. The championships were revived in 1964, and from 1969 took the form of a knock-out tournament: Fred Davis, in his late fifties, continued to compete strongly with the best of the new generation of players and reached the semi-finals in 1969, 1974, and 1978. During this last match Joe Davis was taken ill; he died a few weeks later. Despite heart attacks in 1974 and 1977, Fred Davis continued on the professional circuit, and in 1980 he won the world billiards title, which he defended successfully later that year. He published <span class="italic">Snooker</span> (1977) and <span class="italic">Talking Snooker</span> (1979), which both had second editions. He retired from professional competition in 1992; at seventy-eight he was probably the oldest active professional sportsman in the world. He died in the Denbigh Infirmary, Denbigh, on 16 April 1998. His wife predeceased him.<br>
