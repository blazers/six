<span class="headword">Scheener,  Edward Schencker</span>  (1789&#150;1853), <span class="occ">civil servant and half-brother of Queen Victoria</span>, was born in Geneva, Switzerland, on 24 November 1789, the natural son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8526/', "Edward, duke of Kent")</script>, and Anne Gabrielle Alexandrine Mor&eacute;. Scheener passed his youth in Geneva in the family of his ostensible father, Thimoth&eacute;e Schencker. Kent undertook to find a place for Scheener in the civil service, and in 1809 he was appointed a supernumerary clerk in the Foreign Office, having previously occupied a position in the council office as an assistant examiner of public accounts. He was appointed to the regular establishment in 1814 and was promoted to the second class in 1823. After being ordered to absent himself permanently from the Foreign Office in September 1826 he was retired on a pension of &pound;272 10<i>s</i>. 0<i>d</i>. on 5 July 1830.<br>
<br>Royal patronage was at this time fairly common in the Foreign Office; Richard Mellish and Adolfus Kent Oom both had court connections, so Scheener was hardly exceptional. However, it has always been supposed that the duke of Kent, unlike his brothers who had many acknowledged natural children, had just one child, Queen Victoria. Whatever may be the real story of Kent's long liaison with Mme Julie St Laurent and their &#145;invisible&#146; children, there can be no doubt that Kent fathered two children in Geneva shortly before his sudden and unexplained departure in January 1790; one was Edward Scheener, and the other Adelaide Victoire Auguste Dubus, whose mother died in childbirth.<br>
<br>As soon as Scheener appeared in the Foreign Office in 1809, one of the clerks reported that before George Canning left office he had put Scheener on the establishment as an extra clerk and that &#145;he had the interest of the Duke of Kent to whom he bears a strong resemblance and whom report says to have a nearer relation to him than their being both sons of Adam&#146;  (FO, 95/8/14, fol. 900). The duke of Clarence, always the most solicitous of Kent's elder brothers, took Scheener on his staff as private secretary in 1814, in which capacity he accompanied Europe's royalties to and fro across the channel.<br>
<br>Scheener went abroad again in 1818 but was never able to recover to his satisfaction his expenses from Castlereagh's Foreign Office. After Canning returned to office in 1822, Scheener took up the cause again, but so completely lost his head that Canning declared that he &#145;would rather copy all the Foreign Office despatches himself than rely upon an individual so wrong-headed, of a nature so suspicious and of a temper so ungovernable&#146;  (Bourne, 447). The duke of Clarence was called upon to remind Canning that Scheener was the natural son of the duke of Kent, and that Clarence wished to save Scheener from utter ruin. Scheener was in consequence only suspended (1826), but in 1830, with his patron now king, Scheener succeeded, by dint of publicizing his case in two pamphlets, <span class="italic">Memoirs of an Employ&eacute;e</span> and <span class="italic">Statement of Facts to his Majesty's Ministers</span>, in getting his case reviewed by Lord Palmerston. Palmerston refused to take Scheener back and he was placed on the pension list.<br>
<br>It may not be entirely coincidental that Scheener returned to Geneva with his wife, Harriet (<i>b</i>. 1781), daughter of David Boyn of London, in 1837, the same year that Victoria ascended the throne. Harriet died on 20 January 1852; they had no children. Scheener died at his home, 280 rue Verdaine, Geneva, on 31 January 1853, a pall of official silence then falling over his very existence.<br>
