<span class="headword">Poole,  Jacob</span>  (1774&#150;1827), <span class="occ">antiquary</span>, was born at Growtown, co. Wexford, on 11 February 1774, the son of Joseph Poole (1731&#150;1800), farmer, and his wife, Sarah, daughter of Jacob Martin of Aghfad, co. Wexford. His parents were members of the Society of Friends, and he was seventh in descent from Thomas and Catherine Poole of Dortrope, Northamptonshire. Their son, Richard Poole, came to Ireland with the parliamentary army in 1649, became a Quaker, was imprisoned for his religion at Wexford and Waterford, and died in Wexford gaol, to which he was committed for refusing to pay tithe in 1665. Jacob Poole succeeded to the family estate of Growtown, in the parish of Taghmon, in 1800, and farmed his own land. On 13 May 1813 he married Mary, daughter of Thomas and Deborah Sparrow of Holmstown, co. Wexford; they had three sons and three daughters.<br>
<br>Poole studied the customs and language of the baronies of Bargy and Forth; his estate lay on the edge of the former. The inhabitants used to speak an old English dialect, dating from the Anglo-Norman invasion of the country, and he collected the words and phrases of this expiring language from his tenants and labourers. This collection was edited by the dialectologist William Barnes from the original manuscript obtained from R. D. Webb, and was published in 1867 as <span class="italic">A Glossary, with Some Pieces of Verse, of the Old Dialect of the English Colony in the Baronies of Forth and Bargy</span>. The glossary, amplified from other sources, contains about 1500 words, noted with great fidelity. The dialect was more or less extinct by 1840, and this glossary, with a few words in Holinshed and some fragments of verse, is its sole authentic memorial. Poole produced his glossary and a further vocabulary or gazetteer of the local proper names in the last five years of his life. He died on 20 November 1827, presumably at Growtown, and was buried in the graveyard of the Society of Friends at Forest, co. Wexford. Richard Davis Webb, his nephew, who had known and admired him, published a poem in Poole's memory, &#145;The Mountain of Forth&#146; (1867); it was owing to Webb's exertions that the glossary was published.<br>
