<span class="headword">Vaughan <span class="st"> [<em>married name </em>Morgan]</span>,  Hilda Campbell</span>  (1892&#150;1985), <span class="occ">novelist</span>, was born in a house known as The Castle in Builth Wells, Brecknockshire, on 12 June 1892, the youngest daughter of Hugh Vaughan Vaughan (1852&#150;1936) and his wife, Eva, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Campbell, of Dunoon, Argyll. Her father's surname had been assumed by royal licence in lieu of Thomas in 1885; the family traced its descent from the Vaughans of whom the poet Henry Vaughan, the Silurist, was the most illustrious member. Hilda Vaughan's father, a successful country solicitor, held various public appointments and offices in Radnorshire, becoming clerk of the peace and under sheriff and clerk of the county council and its education committee. It is with Radnorshire, where most of her novels are set, that Hilda Vaughan is generally associated.<br>
<br>Educated privately, though sketchily, by a succession of governesses, she remained at home until the outbreak of the First World War in 1914, during which she first came into contact with the harsher realities of life while serving in a Red Cross hospital and then, for three years, as organizing secretary of the Women's Land Army in Brecknockshire and Radnorshire. At the war's end she left home for London and, while taking a writing course at Bedford College, met the novelist <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35100/', "Charles Langbridge Morgan (1894&#150;1958)")</script>, who had just been appointed junior drama critic on the staff of <span class="italic">The Times</span>. They married on 6 June 1923, and took a flat in More's Garden, Chelsea, where they were to remain for nine years until their removal to a house in Campden Hill Square. Their shared ambition to become writers drew them together, as her husband's letters reveal, but her subsequent career was somewhat overshadowed by his reputation&#151;especially after publication of <span class="italic">The Fountain</span> in 1932&#151;as one of the foremost English novelists of his day. There were two children of the marriage: Roger Morgan, the former librarian of the House of Lords and previously of the House of Commons, and Shirley Morgan, who married the marquess of Anglesey.<br>
<br>Hilda Vaughan's first novel, <span class="italic">The Battle to the Weak</span> (1925), set near Builth Wells, is a didactic work which exploits her knowledge of the topography, speech, and atmosphere of Radnorshire, but also reflects her own struggle to achieve recognition in her own right. Her third novel, <span class="italic">The Invader</span> (1928), is a comedy and perhaps the most authentically Welsh of all her works, and in <span class="italic">Her Father's House</span> (1930) she again makes use of her native place. Her most successful novel, <span class="italic">The Soldier and the Gentlewoman</span> (1932), set in Carmarthenshire and published by Victor Gollancz, was a new departure into ironic tragedy; it was dramatized by Laurier Lister and Dorothy Massingham, and produced at the Vaudeville Theatre, London, in 1933. Her subsequent novels, <span class="italic">The Curtain Rises</span> (1935), <span class="italic">Harvest Home</span> (1936), <span class="italic">Pardon and Peace</span> (1945), <span class="italic">Iron and Gold</span> (1948), and <span class="italic">The Candle and the Light</span> (1954), are romantic in theme but realistic and unsentimental in their acute observation of human character, particularly in adversity; compassion is at their heart. The fourth of these was first published in the United States, to which Charles Morgan had sent his wife and children during the Second World War, under the title <span class="italic">The Fair Woman</span> (1942). She also wrote two plays in collaboration with Laurier Lister: <span class="italic">She Too was Young</span> (1938), performed at Wyndhams Theatre, London, concurrently with her husband's <span class="italic">The Flashing Stream</span>, and <span class="italic">Forsaking All Other</span>, which was never staged. Her most exquisite writing is found in the novella <span class="italic">A Thing of Nought</span> (1934; revised edition 1948), a tale of star-crossed love told with great economy and again set in the hills of Radnorshire.<br>
<br>In 1957 the Morgans visited the West Indies for the benefit of Charles's health, but the relief was only temporary and he died the following year, after which, her own health affected, Hilda Vaughan published no more novels. A statement about her religious faith, which bordered on the quasi-mystical, is to be found in her introduction to an edition of Thomas Traherne's <span class="italic">Centuries of Meditations</span>, published in 1960. Apart from the autobiographical essays &#145;A country childhood&#146; and &#145;Far away: not long ago&#146;, which first appeared in <span class="italic">Lovat Dickson's Magazine</span> in 1934 and 1935, this was the only occasion on which she wrote about herself. She was elected a fellow of the Royal Society of Literature in 1963.<br>
<br>Hilda Vaughan died on 4 November 1985 at Hazlewell Nursing Home, 29/31 Hazlewell Road, Putney, and was buried at Diserth, Radnorshire.<br>
