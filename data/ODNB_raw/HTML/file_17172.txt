<span class="headword">Lumby,  Joseph Rawson</span>  (1831&#150;1895), <span class="occ">author and Church of England clergyman</span>, the only son of John Lumby (1799/1800&#150;1864), a joiner, and his first wife, Sarah (<i>d</i>. 1844), was born at Stanningley, near Leeds, on 18 July 1831. On 2 August 1841 he was admitted to Leeds grammar school and in March 1848 he left to become master of a school at Meanwood, a village soon to be absorbed in Leeds, where his ability attracted attention. He was encouraged to attend university, and in October 1854 he entered Magdalene College, Cambridge; in the following year he was elected to a Milner close scholarship. In 1858 he graduated BA, being bracketed ninth in the first class of the classical tripos, and was ordained in the following year. He was awarded an MA in 1861, a BD in 1873, and a DD in 1879.<br>
<br>Within a few months of graduation Lumby was made Dennis fellow of his college, and began to take pupils. He forfeited his fellowship on his marriage on 11 April 1859 to Susanna Mary Parsons (<i>d</i>. 1873) of Darlington. In 1860 he gained the Crosse theological scholarship, the chaplaincy of Magdalene, and the curacy of Girton. In the following year he won the Tyrwhitt Hebrew scholarship, and was appointed classical lecturer at Queens' College. In 1873 his name was added to the list of the Old Testament Revision Company; when the <span class="roman">Old Testament</span> was completed, he worked with equal enthusiasm on the revision of the <span class="roman">Apocrypha</span>, just living to see the publication of the latter work. In 1874, then a widower after the death of his first wife in May 1873, he was chosen fellow and dean of St Catharine's College, Cambridge; having resigned his curacy at Girton he became curate of St Mark's, Newnham. In the following year he was appointed, on the nomination of Trinity Hall, to the non-stipendiary cure of St Edward's, Cambridge, where his sermons were much appreciated by undergraduates. In 1879 he was elected to the Norrisian professorship of divinity; he was also Lady Margaret preacher for that year. Having vacated his fellowship at St Catharine's because of his second marriage&#151;on 16 June 1880 to Luise Theodore Ernestine Albertine Dahlmann (1856/7&#150;1915), second daughter of a German lawyer&#151;he was appointed to a professorial fellowship in that college in 1886. In 1887 he was made prebendary of Wetwang in the cathedral church of York, and acted as examining chaplain to the archbishop of York and the bishop of Carlisle. On the death of F. J. A. Hort in 1892 he was unanimously chosen to succeed him as Lady Margaret professor of divinity. After an illness of several months he died at Merton House, Grantchester, near Cambridge, on 21 November 1895, leaving a large family. He was buried on 25 November in Grantchester parish church.<br>
<br>Lumby habitually rose early and worked diligently. H. J. Roby, who taught him, remembered him as &#145;of all my pupils the one who made the most evident progress from day to day&#146;, who winced at criticism but did not repeat mistakes  (<span class="italic">Cambridge Review</span>, 23 Jan 1896, 144). Anecdotes about him later entered the folklore of the university, where his omnivorous reading and capacious memory for recondite and often trivial information were a source of wonder and amusement. A large and powerful man, he was reputedly able to twist pokers. He was kindly but, some thought, deficient in humour. The famous observation (attached to more than one scholar, before and since) &#145;Lumby is omniscient and omnipotent but (thank Heaven!) not omnipresent&#146; and the verses &#145;I heard the voice of Lumby say&#146; (repeated in full in Venn's <span class="italic">Alumni Cantabrigienses</span>) are attributed to A. W. Spratt of St Catharine's.<br>
<br>Lumby's literary career, especially as editor and annotator, was unflagging and wide-ranging. He often had several works, large and small, in preparation and others at press, chiefly in the fields of biblical scholarship and medieval English literature and history. He was co-editor of the <span class="roman">Cambridge Bible for Schools</span> series and a contributor to the <span class="roman">Speaker's Commentary</span>, the <span class="roman">Expositor's Bible</span>, the <span class="italic">Cambridge Companion to the Bible</span>, and the ninth edition of the <span class="italic">Encyclopaedia Britannica</span>. Among his other works were editions of More's <span class="italic">Utopia</span> (1879) and <span class="italic">History of Richard III</span> (1883), Cowley's <span class="italic">Essays</span> (1887), a <span class="italic">History of the Creeds</span> (1873), <span class="italic">A Popular Introduction to the New Testament</span> (1883), sermons, and contributions to learned journals. A fairly full list of his publications is included in the <span class="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</span>.<br>
<br>But Lumby attempted too much: although he was active in the Early English Text Society from its beginning, his editions of Old and Middle English texts such as <span class="italic">Be domes daege</span> (1876) and <span class="italic">Ratis Raving</span> (1867) were indifferent and soon superseded. He stood unsuccessfully against Walter Skeat for the new professorship of Anglo-Saxon in 1878. Above all, the poor reputation of what could have been a worthy memorial, nine large (and to him lucrative) volumes for the <span class="roman">Rolls Series</span>, has most damaged his memory. He edited seven volumes of Ranulf Higden's <span class="italic">Polychronicon</span> (1871&#150;86), in which some errors and omissions misled scholars badly, and his edition of the <span class="italic">Chronicon</span> of Henry Knighton (1889&#150;95) was one of the worst of the whole enterprise, causing James Tait to remark that he &#145;lacked much of the elementary equipment of an editor of a medieval chronicle&#146;  (Tait, 569).<br>
