<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Savoy,  Boniface  of</span>  (1206/7&#150;1270), <span class="occ">archbishop of Canterbury</span>, was probably the seventh son of Thomas (I), count of Savoy (1178&#150;1233), and Marguerite (<i>d</i>. 1258), daughter of either Guillaume, count of Geneva (1137&#150;1195), or the lord of Faucigny.<h2>
<a name="Earlycareer"></a>Early career</h2>Described by Matthew Paris as a man &#145;of noble stature and elegant bearing&#146;  (Paris, <span class="italic">Chron</span>., 4.104), Boniface was intended, like four of his brothers, for an ecclesiastical career, but was the only one who appears to have had a religious vocation. By 1224 he was probably a novice in the Carthusian order at Portes, a daughter house of the Grande Chartreuse south of Chamb&eacute;ry, but he never took his monastic vows because, as part of his father's policy of consolidating his hold on strategic sees and providing for his sons, Boniface was elected bishop of Belley and prior of Nantua in 1232. In the following year these appointments were confirmed after he had taken subdeacon's orders, and he inherited, on the death of his father, a share of his family inheritance, including the castle of Ugine.<br>
<br>Boniface might have remained in Savoy had it not been for the marriage in 1236 of his niece, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8620/', "Eleanor of Provence")</script>, to Henry III, who strongly promoted his career, and that of his brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22016/', "Peter of Savoy")</script>, in England. After narrowly failing to secure for him the bishopric of Winchester (he had earlier tried to procure it for Boniface's elder brother William of Savoy), the king induced the cathedral chapter of Canterbury, which was labouring under a ban of excommunication imposed by the former archbishop Edmund of Abingdon (<i>d</i>. 1240), to elect him archbishop and primate of England on 1 February 1241. Anxious to win support in his dispute with Frederick II, and under Savoyard influence, Innocent IV (<i>r</i>. 1243&#150;54) confirmed the appointment on 16 September 1243. The temporalities were restored some time after 27 February 1244. Despite having promised to come as soon as he could, another seven months passed before Boniface travelled to England, probably because of a dispute with &Eacute;tienne (II) de Thoire-Villars about jurisdiction over the priory of Nantua. The delay was significant for the future: although Boniface had renounced his claim to the succession in 1238, his links with Savoy remained close, and he often returned to his homeland.<h2>
<a name="Retrenchmentandreform"></a>Retrenchment and reform</h2>When Boniface eventually arrived in England on 25 April 1244, he was warmly welcomed by the king, who had commissioned for him a mitre decorated with precious stones worth 300 marks, and thoughtfully restocked the archiepiscopal wine cellars. He was ordained into the priesthood by Walter de Cantilupe, bishop of Worcester (<i>d</i>. 1266), and lost no time in grappling with Canterbury's vast debts, in part the result of his predecessors' extravagance. After his suffragans refused to help, Boniface left England on 26 November 1244 for Lyons, where the exiled Innocent IV consecrated him on 15 January 1245, and later agreed that the first fruits of vacant benefices in the province of Canterbury for up to seven years, or to the value of 10,000 marks (later doubled), should be applied to paying off the debts, a decision the suffragans accepted only after Boniface suspended them. By also reorganizing the Canterbury administration, exacting all dues and services from his tenants, felling timber, and reclaiming part of Romney Marsh, Boniface had paid debts amounting to 22,000 marks by 1261, including those incurred by his predecessors in the construction of the great hall of the archbishop's palace. &#145;Thus it seems to me&#146;, he jested, &#145;that I have built it, for I have paid their debts&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works of Gervase of Canterbury</span>, 2.251). Boniface then embarked on his own building schemes, including a hospital at Maidstone, Kent.<br>
<br>Except for two brief visits to Savoy, Boniface stayed at the papal court in exile at Lyons from 1244 to 1249. While there he worked to secure the canonization of his predecessor, Edmund of Abingdon, and at the general council summoned by Innocent IV (June&#150;July 1245) was one of the four archbishops chosen to codify the privileges of the church previously acknowledged by emperors and kings. To the annoyance of Henry III he also helped to arrange the marriage of his niece B&eacute;atrice, sister of Queen Eleanor, to Charles of Anjou, the younger brother of Louis IX of France. Most important of all, his long stay at Lyons engendered in him a determination to defend the liberties of the church, resist secular control, and pursue ecclesiastical reform, not least by centralizing provincial administration in his own hands.<br>
<br>In September 1249 Boniface returned to England from Lyons bearing the first news of the fall of Damietta to Louis IX, and at Canterbury on 1 November he was enthroned as archbishop in the presence of the king and queen, and most of the prelates. Although Matthew Paris condemned him as &#145;a man &hellip; insufficient for such a dignity &hellip; in learning, manners and years&#146;  (Paris, <span class="italic">Chron</span>., 4.104), Robert Grosseteste, the eminent bishop of Lincoln (at whose funeral Boniface was to officiate in 1253), and the Franciscan scholar Adam Marsh (<i>d</i>. 1259) hoped to find in him a like-minded ecclesiastical reformer with the ear of the king. What his suffragans were determined to resist was any attempt to supervise their activities. Despite this, in the spring of 1250, while resentment at his financial demands was at its height, Boniface asserted his metropolitan rights by undertaking a visitation of the clergy of his province. Soon after, at the priory of St Bartholomew's, London, a brawl seems to have occurred about which Adam Marsh, who accompanied the archbishop, claimed &#145;extremely false accounts have been spread throughout the province both by the clergy and by the populace&#146;  (Brewer, 1.163). Matthew Paris's contribution was a damning account of the archbishop, who, he said, wore armour under his vestments and manhandled the sub-prior. After the disputants had appealed to Rome, Boniface left for the continent on 13 June 1250, where he stayed, except for a brief visit to his archiepiscopal see in the following summer, until the end of 1252. During his absence the bishops ignored Marsh's pleas not to disrupt the work of the archbishop, and assembled on several occasions to assert their liberties. The pope, for his part, eventually vindicated Boniface's right of visitation, but exempted parish churches from the payment of procurations in May 1252. That same year his elder brother, Count Amadeus (IV), assigned to him the castle of Tournon and the manor house of Ste H&eacute;l&egrave;ne-des-Milli&egrave;res in the Tarentaise.<br>
<br>After Boniface's return to England on 18 November 1252 he was more conciliatory, and even Matthew Paris raised no objection to his conduct during later visitations, which continued intermittently until 1262. Yet there was no weakening in his resolve to protect his rights and supervise his province with strictness. In 1258&#150;9 he successfully defended his jurisdictional liberties by arranging agreements with three of his most powerful vassals by knight service: the priory of Christ Church, Canterbury, the see of Rochester, and the earl of Gloucester. On 22 May 1261 he strengthened his <i>sede vacante</i> jurisdiction, and settled a long-running dispute with the diocese of Lincoln, by securing recognition of his authority to appoint members of his own household, rather than officials of the diocese, to take charge during an episcopal vacancy. This agreement became the model for others with the dioceses of London (21 August 1262) and Salisbury (18 January 1263). He also asserted his authority over his suffragans by sanctioning the development of a new &#145;court of Canterbury&#146; at London to hear appeals from their courts, and other business, and by insisting on receiving personally the profession of obedience of all but three of the thirty-seven bishops consecrated during his archiepiscopate. Consecrations usually took place at Canterbury, and whenever practicable his bishops were required to attend these ceremonial occasions.<h2>
<a name="RelationswithHenryIII"></a>Relations with Henry III</h2>Much to Henry III's anger and disappointment Boniface was equally vigorous in his defence of ecclesiastical privileges and resistance to the king's interference in episcopal elections, taking up a position he was to defend resolutely for the rest of his life. Even before his first visit to England, he had opposed the king's vindictive efforts to prevent William of Raleigh (<i>d</i>. 1250) from becoming bishop of Winchester, and later in 1244 he quashed Henry's attempt to make his clerk, Robert Passelewe (<i>d</i>. 1252), bishop of Chichester, after an examination by Grosseteste had found him unfit for office. Boniface was also offended by the arrogance and brutality of the Lusignan half-brothers of the king, who came to England in 1247 and competed for royal patronage with the Savoyard relatives of the queen. In 1252, after he had clashed with one of their number, Aymer de Lusignan (<i>d</i>. 1260), bishop-elect of Winchester, over the patronage of the hospital of St Thomas at Southwark, the archbishop's manor of Lambeth was ransacked and one of his officials was abducted. Those responsible were excommunicated, and Boniface and Aymer were not reconciled until 13 January 1253.<br>
<br>Henry took the cross at the hands of Boniface, who may himself have pledged to go, at Westminster on 6 March 1250. After he had persuaded the clergy to grant Henry III a crusading subsidy in return for the king's agreement to reissue <span class="roman">Magna Carta</span>, Boniface and thirteen bishops pronounced a sentence of excommunication on 13 May 1253 against those violating the charters and the liberties of the church, a decision confirmed by the pope on 28 September 1253. In Gascony in the following summer, and later in Savoy, he furthered papal policy and the interests of his family in Italy by taking part in the negotiations that resulted, to the dismay of his suffragans, in the diversion of the crusading tenth to the conquest of Sicily.<br>
<br>While again away, mainly in Savoy, between October 1254 and November 1256 Boniface joined his brothers Peter and Philip in an unsuccessful attempt in the summer of 1255 to rescue their brother Count Thomas from captivity at Turin. Meanwhile Henry III's financial exactions had continued. In May 1257 the clergy consented to extend the financial assistance granted to him provided he removed grievances, and did not use this agreement as a precedent for new taxes. The pope urged a compromise, but the king was incensed, and forbade the prelates and other clergy to attend a meeting that Boniface summoned to London in August 1257. Most prelates defied his prohibition and discussed a list of their grievances, as well as authorizing the use of spiritual sanctions against those infringing ecclesiastical liberties. In June 1258 Boniface summoned another meeting for Merton, Surrey, later moved to Westminster, at which the clergy approved a long list of provisions defining the rights of the church.<h2>
<a name="Bonifaceandthebaronialreformmovement"></a>Boniface and the baronial reform movement</h2>Although the clergy may have kept away from the reforming parliament held at Oxford later in the same month, Boniface participated in its work, and must have welcomed some features of the baronial takeover. Along with his brother Peter he was appointed to the new ruling council of fifteen, while Aymer de Lusignan and the king's other Lusignan half-brothers were forced into exile. The barons undertook to seek funds for the Sicilian war, and a promise to reform the church was included in the provisions of Oxford. The archbishop also conducted the impressive ceremony which proclaimed a sentence of excommunication against those who opposed the provisions.<br>
<br>Boniface became increasingly disenchanted with the baronial government when, despite his protests at the infringement of his jurisdiction, the castles of Canterbury and Rochester were given to baronial castellans, the barons failed to finance the papal wars in Sicily, his brother Peter was forced off the council, and no action was taken about the reform of the church. In March 1260 he opposed Simon de Montfort's attempt to hold a parliament in defiance of Henry's wishes, and later he helped Richard, earl of Cornwall (<i>d</i>. 1272), the king's brother, who was married to Sanchia, another of the archbishop's nieces, to reconcile the king and his son, the Lord Edward, after a dispute. In the spring of 1261 Alexander IV (<i>r</i>. 1254&#150;61) issued a bull absolving Henry from his oath to support the provisions, though he was careful to insist that the king was bound by any changes that were to the advantage of the church. Boniface headed the list of those authorized to absolve the prelates and magnates from their oaths. In August, Boniface published the papal absolution and threatened Hugh Bigod (<i>d</i>. 1266), the justiciar, with excommunication if he refused to surrender the castles granted to him under the terms of the provisions.<br>
<br>Responding to a papal request for financial assistance against the Tartar invasion of Hungary, Boniface summoned an ecclesiastical council to meet at Lambeth on 8 May 1261, at which he complained that neither the king nor the barons were prepared to improve the condition of the church. Although an angry Henry III sent a delegation headed by Peter of Savoy and the Lord Edward to press his objections, Boniface and the clergy issued the constitutions of Lambeth on 13 May 1261, a formal restatement of the decisions taken in June 1258, and sought papal confirmation of them. Henry responded by sending proctors to the court of Rome to urge the rejection of the constitutions, which he described as &#145;to the prejudice of the king's right and dignity and the liberties, law and customs of the realm&#146;  (<span class="italic">CPR</span>, <i>1258&#150;66</i>, 155). New proctors were appointed in the following January:<blockquote>to show the grievances done to the king and the realm by the archbishop of Canterbury and his suffragans, and to obtain the revocation of certain statutes issued by them to the great prejudice of the king and the crown. (<span class="italic">CPR</span>, <i>1258&#150;66</i>, 197)</blockquote>On 25 February 1262 Urban IV (<i>r</i>. 1261&#150;4) confirmed the decree of his predecessor, and instructed Boniface and others to absolve the king from any oaths he had taken. All promises made by the prelates and magnates contrary to the dignity of the crown and prejudicial to its rights were declared null and void.<h2>
<a name="Bonifaceandthecivilwar"></a>Boniface and the civil war</h2>After Boniface left England on 8 October 1262, presumably to secure papal confirmation of the constitutions of Lambeth and to attend to family affairs in Savoy, he found himself increasingly isolated and powerless. His tendency, at times, to exceed his canonical authority had long been a source of anxiety at Rome. Innocent IV had been obliged to use his plenitude of power to confirm Boniface's appointment of Richard of Wyche (<i>d</i>. 1253) as bishop of Chichester in 1244, while Alexander IV had overruled the archbishop when he tried to have Adam Marsh made bishop of Ely in preference to Hugh of Balsham (<i>d</i>. 1286) in 1256. The archbishop's encroachments on the jurisdiction of diocesan courts had also caused concern. Now the papacy could not allow Boniface's insistence on ecclesiastical reform to compromise its support for Henry III. In January 1263, out of deference to the king, Urban IV refused to approve the constitutions, even though he admitted that he could see nothing wrong in them, and by appointing Guy Foulquois, cardinal-bishop of Sabina, as legate to England in November he deprived Boniface of much of his authority. The increasing disorder in England, especially the ravaging of his lands in Kent, which made it impossible for him to return safely, further undermined Boniface's influence. With their archbishop in exile many of the reforming clergy rallied behind Walter de Cantilupe and other bishops sympathetic to Simon de Montfort, and the disruption in communications enabled a Canterbury monk, Adam of Chillenden, to trick Boniface into appointing him prior of Christ Church. After Henry III's defeat at Lewes on 14 May 1264 Boniface rejected the demands of the Montfortian government that he return to England, or delegate his authority, &#145;otherwise his emoluments will not be allowed to go out of the realm&#146;  (<span class="italic">CPR</span>, <i>1258&#150;66</i>, 328). Instead, using the power granted to him by the pope in the spring of 1264 to exercise jurisdiction while resident abroad, he refused in January 1265 to consecrate Walter Giffard (<i>d</i>. 1279) as bishop of Bath and Wells until he had appeared before him in France. Meantime, with his future uncertain, and perhaps already often bedridden with the stone, Boniface had made his will at Tournon on 11 October 1264. The experiences of twenty years of incessant travel no doubt explain why one of his many bequests was money to build a bridge over the Rh&ocirc;ne on the road between Savoy and France.<br>
<br>It was not until 29 May 1266, almost ten months after Montfort's defeat at Evesham, that Boniface returned to England and recovered possession of his plate and treasure, worth over 6000 marks, which had been safeguarded by his officials throughout the civil war. By then Ottobuono Fieschi, cardinal-deacon of St Adrian (<i>d</i>. 1276), who had been appointed legate on 4 May 1265, had already taken charge of ecclesiastical affairs and instituted proceedings against the Montfortian bishops. Although the two men were on friendly terms (the cardinal's sister B&eacute;atrice had been married to the archbishop's late brother Thomas), Boniface's authority was effectively in eclipse until Ottobuono's departure in July 1268, the same month in which the archbishop settled a <i>sede vacante</i> dispute with the cathedral chapter of Worcester. Despite being disheartened by the ravaging of his estates, he showed continued determination to defend his rights and privileges from whatever quarter they appeared to come under threat, as he demonstrated in April 1266, when he astonished the king by objecting to an appointment to a prebend in Herefordshire. Yet it says much for his weakened standing that Giffard, the official collector of a new crusading subsidy, was able to command him to submit on pain of excommunication.<br>
<br>Although Boniface probably attended the council summoned by Ottobuono to discuss church reform at St Paul's, London, in April 1268, there is no evidence that he played any part in drawing up the important canons it produced, which were in any case published under the name of the legate. When Boniface was too ill to attend the celebration of the feast of St Edward the Confessor at Westminster on 13 October 1268, Giffard, who had been appointed archbishop of York in the previous year, reopened an ancient dispute by having his cross carried before him in the southern province. If the angry Canterbury suffragans showed their feelings by sitting stony-faced in their stalls, Boniface demonstrated his by imposing an interdict on London. He left England for the last time on 14 November 1268, and after his death on 14 July 1270 at Ste H&eacute;l&egrave;ne, he was buried with other members of his family in the Cistercian abbey of Hautecombe.<h2>
<a name="Significanceandreputation"></a>Significance and reputation</h2>On the continent, where he spent the greater part of his career of twenty-nine years as archbishop of Canterbury, Boniface was held in high esteem. By the late fourteenth century, his grave, over which an impressive bronze effigy had been erected soon after his death, was the centre of a cult, and it was claimed that Boniface had performed miracles in England during his lifetime. When his tomb was opened in 1580, his body was found to be perfectly preserved. Although the effigy was melted down during the French Revolution, Boniface's remains were reburied under the high altar, and he was beatified by Gregory XVI (<i>r</i>. 1831&#150;46) in 1839, when a new stone tomb modelled on the original effigy was erected. In England, by contrast, despite the eulogies of the chroniclers after his death, and the provision in his will of 1000 marks for the poor of his estates, and 20 marks for impecunious scholars at Oxford, most later historians accepted uncritically Matthew Paris's initial vilification of him as a violent, greedy, and neglectful foreigner. Boniface was undoubtedly aggressive and high-handed, he failed to resolve the conflict between family loyalties, the needs of the crown, the interests of his suffragans, and his obligations to the papacy, and he was often absent from England on church and family business at critical times. The civil war, moreover, broke the unity of the ecclesiastical reformers, devastated the archiepiscopal lands, and severely curbed the archbishop's authority. Yet earlier, Boniface's stubborn defence of the prerogatives of the church and of his office had made him the unlikely champion of ecclesiastical liberties, won over many of his former critics, and helped persuade Matthew Paris to modify his first censorious verdict. With papal support Boniface established the rights of provincial visitation in the see of Canterbury, and by clarifying and settling the relationship between the archbishop and his cathedral chapter, largely removed a long-standing conflict between them. His constitutions of Lambeth of May 1261 &#145;became the focus of the continued conflict over the reform of the church up to the seventeenth century&#146;  (Wilshire, 65). Although none of his registers has survived, he was clearly also an able administrator who built up an unusually large household and administration, composed almost entirely of university men. So the continuator of Gervase of Canterbury's <span class="italic">Gesta regum</span> had justification for claiming that &#145;with great labour and at great expense he procured much good for his church and liberties for himself and his successors&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works of Gervase of Canterbury</span>, 2.250).<br>
