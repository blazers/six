<span class="headword">Dealtry,  Thomas</span>  (1796&#150;1861), <span class="occ">bishop of Madras</span>, was born at Knottingley near Pontefract on 19 October 1796, the son of James Dealtry, of the Dealtry family of Lofthouse Hall, Wakefield. He was largely self-taught and from the age of fifteen worked as an usher in a Doncaster school and as a tutor to a private family. In 1819 he married the sister of his pupil &#145;under romantic circumstances&#146;  (Venn, <span class="italic">Alum. Cant.</span>, pt 2, 1944, 2.263), with whom he had a daughter, Dorothy (1820&#150;1892), but his wife died young and on 22 April 1824 he married a woman whose given names were Jane Brannon (1804&#150;1892).<br>
<br>In 1826 Dealtry entered St Catharine's College, Cambridge, to study law, supporting himself by private tuition. He graduated LLB (first class) in 1828 and in June of the same year was ordained deacon and became officiating minister at St Mary-the-Less, Cambridge. An evangelical but nevertheless catholic in his sympathies, Dealtry was a good preacher and he soon attracted the attention of Cambridge's leading evangelical divine, Charles Simeon, who procured for him an East India Company chaplaincy in Bengal. Dealtry was ordained priest in November 1828 and arrived in Calcutta in early 1829 to take charge of the old mission church. There, as Simeon had hoped, he befriended the missionaries, and eventually he became secretary of the local branch of the Church Missionary Society.<br>
<br>In 1835 Bishop Daniel Wilson appointed Dealtry archdeacon of Calcutta, an administrative post well-suited to his legal abilities. In 1849, when on leave in England, he was appointed third bishop of Madras.<br>
<br>In Madras from January 1850, Dealtry again proved to be an excellent administrator and wisely treated his East India Company employers with courtesy and understanding. Despite his well-known missionary sympathies he managed to persuade the company to increase its clergy roll in Madras and during his episcopate he ordained forty-four deacons and sixty-one priests, many of whom were Indians. As in Calcutta, Dealtry was occasionally involved in bitter disputes with other churchmen, most notably a long-running feud with Alfred Radford Symonds, secretary of the Madras Society for the Propagation of the Gospel. In 1861 he earned more enemies by making his son Thomas (1825&#150;1882) archdeacon of Madras. Cries of nepotism were raised, though as a former president of the Cambridge Union the younger Thomas may genuinely have been the most able candidate. Dealtry's critics also accused him of lacking talent and intellect. Neither was true, though his long Indian service had cut him off from theological developments in Britain and his religious thinking often appeared na&iuml;ve to clerics newly arrived from Oxford or Cambridge. His one major publication, <span class="italic">The Divinity of our Lord Jesus Christ Proved from his Own Discourse</span>, had appeared in 1830. Unlike his critics, however, many of Dealtry's flock appreciated his simple, tolerant evangelicalism and his common-sense approach to church administration. One of his first acts in Madras&#151;to shorten the Sunday morning services&#151;remained one of his most popular.<br>
<br>Dealtry died in Madras from an infected foot on 4 March 1861 and was buried in the burial-ground of St George's Cathedral the following day. A sculpted memorial, funded by public subscription, was placed in the cathedral. He was survived by his wife, Jane; their son Thomas, afterwards rector of Swillington, Yorkshire (1872&#150;8), and vicar of Maidstone, Kent (1878&#150;82); and his daughter from his first marriage, Dorothy, widow of Henry Thomas, East India Company chaplain (1842&#150;59).<br>
