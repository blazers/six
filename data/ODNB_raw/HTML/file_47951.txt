<span class="headword">Llewellyn, Sir  David Richard</span>, first baronet  (1879&#150;1940), <span class="occ">coal owner and financier</span>, was born on 9 March 1879 at Bwllfa House, Aberd&acirc;r, the eldest son of Alderman Rees Llewellyn of Bwllfa House, and his wife, Elizabeth. The father was a renowned mining engineer, who had successfully reorganized the Bwllfa colliery; together with two other sons he later joined forces with David in a number of coal ventures. &#145;D. R.&#146;, as Llewellyn was often called, was educated at Aberd&acirc;r higher grade school and Llandovery College. In 1900 he enrolled in a course for mining engineers at University College, Cardiff, and qualified in 1903. After two years in the USA studying mechanical mining he started the Windber colliery in 1905, aiming to work its thin seams&#151;on which he became something of an expert&#151;with electrically driven cutters. Between 1914 and 1916 he acquired four additional collieries, all drift mines, around Aberd&acirc;r. These became the nucleus of the company of D. R. Llewellyn &amp; Sons Ltd, which was registered in 1920.<br>
<br>These initial business interests were small-scale and (relatively) mundane. What really launched Llewellyn and made him a major force in coal production in south Wales for nearly a quarter century was his involvement, especially between 1916 and the early 1920s, in a frenzy of mergers and acquisitions. Initially the central figure was D. A. Thomas, Lord Rhondda (1856&#150;1918), but his removal by war service and his subsequent death left control increasingly with his right-hand man, H. Seymour Berry (later Lord Buckland). It was the Aberd&acirc;r connection with Berry (one of the extraordinary Berry brothers: the two others became Lord Camborne and Lord Kemsley) which brought in Llewellyn. In 1916, after Berry negotiated the purchase of the Gwaun-Cae-Gurwen Colliery Company for D. A. Thomas, Llewellyn was made chairman of this subsidiary enterprise.<br>
<br>The two young men (assisted by H. H. Merrett) took over a range of companies across the south Wales coalfields. Llewellyn or Berry were frequently designated chairman. The companies they controlled included Bwllfa and Merthyr Dare; D. R. Llewellyn &amp; Sons; Graigola Merthyr Company; Gwaen-Cae-Gurwen; Cambrian Collieries; Celtic Collieries; North's Navigation; D. Davis &amp; Son; and Welsh Navigation. One of their most spectacular acquisitions took place in 1919, when they took a controlling interest, for &pound;4.5 million, of John Lysaght Ltd. A few months later the business was sold on to Guest, Keen and Nettlefolds (GKN) with Llewellyn becoming chairman of GKN's colliery committee.<br>
<br>In 1930 the most important of the south Wales coal companies, namely GKN, D. R. Llewellyn &amp; Sons, and Gueret, Llewellyn, and Merrett, collaborated to form Welsh Associated Collieries Ltd, and Llewellyn was elected chairman. In 1935 this group fused with the Powell Duffryn Steam Coal Company Ltd. The resulting group controlled some ninety pits, produced over 20 million tons of coal, and employed over 37,000 people. Llewellyn served as vice-chairman. If much of this was essentially financial engineering, the more constructive aspect of these amalgamations and rationalizations was seen in the marketing and distribution of the group's coal output. Thus when Llewellyn joined the board of Lord Melchett's Amalgamated Anthracite Company, he secured efficiencies by pooling wagons, centralizing purchases of stores, and introducing uniform systems of accounting. In much of this Llewellyn's main adviser and associate was H. H. Merrett, who in the early 1930s published a plan for the total co-ordination of selling and transport in the industry.<br>
<br>In 1905 Llewellyn married Magdalene Anne (<i>d</i>. 1966), the daughter of the Revd Henry Harries; they had four sons and four daughters. He and his family lived at The Court, St Fagans, Glamorgan; and there was also a London residence at 3 Whitehall Court. Despite his strong roots in south Wales, Llewellyn's involvement in local affairs was limited, especially during his last two decades. In 1920 he was (like his father before him, and his brother afterwards) chairman of Aberd&acirc;r district council and high constable of Miskin Higher. He was created a baronet in 1922. He became treasurer and, in 1924, president of University College, Cardiff, to which he had given &pound;30,000 in 1922. He was awarded an honorary LLD by the University of Wales in 1929. He was active in the Coalowners' Association (serving as chairman in 1929), but this was more to extend his business interests.<br>
<br>D. R. Llewellyn died on 15 December 1940 at T&#375; Newydd, Penderyn, Brecknockshire, the home of his brother, W. M. Llewellyn.<br>
