<span class="headword">Balfour,  Gerald William</span>, second earl of Balfour  (1853&#150;1945), <span class="occ">politician and psychical researcher</span>, was born on 9 April 1853, in Edinburgh, the seventh of eight children of James Maitland Balfour (1820&#150;1856), MP, sportsman, and country gentleman, and his wife, Lady Blanche Mary Harriet Gascoyne-Cecil (1825&#150;1872), daughter of the second marquess of Salisbury. Among his three sisters and four brothers were <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36086/', "Eleanor Sidgwick")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30553/', "Arthur James Balfour, first earl of Balfour")</script>. After their father's early death from tuberculosis, the children were raised by Lady Blanche, whose deep evangelical faith and sense of duty to humanity influenced them profoundly. In due course Balfour became a communicant in both the Church of England and the Church of Scotland. When not attending school, he spent most of his youth at the family estate of Whittingehame in East Lothian. During the Christmas holiday of 1863 he nearly died of diphtheria, but was nursed through the crisis by his mother and Sir James Simpson, summoned from Edinburgh for the purpose.<br>
<br>Balfour was educated at Eton College, where he came under the influence of Oscar Browning, and in 1871 entered Trinity College, Cambridge. His striking intelligence and attractive personality won him election to the Cambridge Conversazione Society, better known as the Apostles, and in 1875 he came fifth in the classical tripos. In 1872, on his mother's death from heart failure, he had inherited some &pound;21,000, which enabled him to postpone decisions about his future. Initially, an academic career at Cambridge attracted him. In 1878 he became a fellow of Trinity and lecturer in classics. Already, however, he was drawn to philosophical studies, and by autumn 1881, he had abandoned Cambridge for a life of metaphysical speculation in Florence. Settled at the Villa Capponi, Balfour pondered his &#145;system of ultimate categories of thought&#146;, as Walter Leaf recalled  (C. M. Leaf, <span class="italic">Walter Leaf, 1852&#150;1927</span>, 1932, 89). Another visitor, his brother-in-law Henry Sidgwick, reported in 1883 that Balfour's &#145;system is still in a germinal state&#146;, and it never advanced much further. Balfour's Florentine idyll was tragically interrupted in the summer of 1882 when he accompanied to England the body of his brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1186/', "Francis Maitland Balfour")</script>, killed in an alpine accident.<br>
<br>Back in England permanently by the mid-1880s, Balfour was drawn into the heady London social circle of the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/42005', "Souls")</script> and fell under the spell of the flirtatious Laura Tennant, who rejected his marriage proposal in 1884  (Jalland, 106&#150;7). In 1887 he embarked on a long and successful marriage to Lady Elizabeth Lytton [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/59381/', "Balfour, Elizabeth Edith, countess of Balfour (1867&#150;1942)")</script>], eldest daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17315/', "Edward Robert Bulwer-Lytton")</script>, the first earl of Lytton. By then Balfour had succumbed to the family penchant for politics, having been elected Conservative member for Central Leeds in 1885. He retained his seat through four subsequent general elections, until the Conservative d&eacute;b&acirc;cle of January 1906, when he was defeated and retired permanently from politics.<br>
<br>On first entering parliament Balfour briefly served as private secretary to his brother Arthur, president of the Local Government Board. Thereafter, from 1886 to 1895, he played no major part in the Commons, although he was a member of the royal commission on labour, appointed in 1891. In 1895 he was named chief secretary for Ireland in Lord Salisbury's third administration and pursued the goal of rendering Irish nationalism irrelevant: he shepherded through parliament the <span class="roman">Land Purchase Act</span> of 1896 and the <span class="roman">Local Government (Ireland) Act</span> of 1898, while also promoting progressive policies for Irish economic development. In 1900 he was sworn of the privy council and accepted the presidency of the Board of Trade. In that capacity he endorsed the export tax of 1<i>s</i>. per ton on coal and bore responsibility for the <span class="roman">Port of London Bill</span> as well as the <span class="roman">Sugar Convention Act</span>. He cautiously leant towards imperial preference in the great debate over tariff reform that rocked Arthur Balfour's premiership of 1902&#150;5. In March 1905, Gerald Balfour transferred to the presidency of the Local Government Board, where he remained until the Conservatives resigned from office in December.<br>
<br>Balfour's was a respectable, though hardly distinguished, parliamentary career, and historians have subsequently shown little interest in it. In politics he was always eclipsed by his brother, whose repertory of debating skills included an incisive wit which Gerald altogether lacked. Indeed, the latter's style on the floor of the house inclined to donnishness. His qualities of thoroughness, detachment, accuracy, and discernment made him, however, a valued colleague, and, as prime minister, Arthur Balfour often turned, in confidence, to &#145;Gerry&#146; for advice.<br>
<br>After leaving politics Balfour pursued a variety of public and private interests. He was chairman of the royal commission on lighthouse administration in 1906&#150;8 and, in 1919&#150;22, chaired the Cambridge committee of the Asquith royal commission on Oxford and Cambridge universities, for which service he received the honorary LLD. Together with Arthur Balfour he invested heavily in schemes to convert peat into commercial fuel, and by the 1920s had lost substantial sums of money on these unsuccessful ventures.<br>
<br>The interest that absorbed Balfour most from 1906 until the end of his life was psychical research. Although he had joined the Society for Psychical Research in 1883, shortly after its establishment, and became a council member in 1890, he was inactive until he became the society's president in 1906. Several members of his family were also involved in psychical research, but it was Eleanor Sidgwick who worked most closely with him in exploring the mental phenomena of mediumship. They both became convinced of the possibility of telepathy, and Balfour was eventually persuaded that discarnate intelligences could communicate telepathically with the living. He also suggested that the human organism is polypsychic&#151;that is, that each self is composed of numerous psychic centres that might be able to communicate with one another telepathically.<br>
<br>Balfour's main contribution to psychical research was the collation and interpretation of what became known as the &#145;Palm Sunday&#146; scripts, some 3000 pieces of automatic writing collected primarily from four automatists during the first thirty years of the twentieth century. Sifting through the documents, while comparing their terms of reference and classical allusions as these emerged over the decades, Balfour concluded that they demonstrated a coherent and sustained attempt to communicate with the living by numerous deceased relatives and friends, especially May Lyttelton, whose death on Palm Sunday 1875 had terminated her budding romance with Arthur Balfour. In &#145;The ear of Dionysius&#146; (1917) and &#145;A study of the psychological aspects of Mrs Willett's mediumship&#146; (1935)&#151;Gerald Balfour's major papers in the <span class="italic">Proceedings</span> of the Society for Psychical Research&#151;he focused on the work of one of the automatists, Mrs Winifred Coombe-Tennant, who used the pseudonym Mrs Willett. The long-sustained inquiry into these scripts, which prompted his only significant excursions into print, left Balfour confident that individual consciousness survives bodily death. The conviction afforded him personal reassurance and comfort, although it did not convert many sceptics.<br>
<br>In private life, Balfour and Lady Betty, an advocate of women's suffrage, enjoyed a close companionship that ended only with her death in 1942. They had six children, one son and five daughters, among them the first president of the Soil Association, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/48843/', "Lady Evelyn Barbara Balfour (1898&#150;1990)")</script>. Balfour's unworldly serenity, devotion to family, and high standards of integrity earned him deep personal esteem and affection from those who knew him well, although those who did not tended to find him aloof and humourless. Beatrice Webb described him as a &#145;medieval and saintly knight&#146;, while Lady Jebb recalled that his fellow Trinity undergraduates had dubbed him &#145;the BVM&#146; for his &#145;divinely beautiful face&#146;  (M. R. Bobbitt, ed., <span class="italic">With Dearest Love to All: the Life and Letters of Lady Jebb</span>, 1960, 175). Throughout his life, he retained his classical good looks, and, standing 6 feet tall, he cut a handsome figure even in extreme old age. While his children were young, he and Lady Betty spent half the year at Whittingehame, the site of extended family gatherings. After the First World War, however, their own home at Fisher's Hill, near Woking, Surrey, increasingly became the centre of Balfour reunions. Eleanor Sidgwick had become a permanent resident there during the war, as did Arthur Balfour in 1929, a year before his death.<br>
<br>In 1930, by special remainder, Gerald Balfour succeeded to the earldom bestowed on his brother in 1922, but the last years of the second earl's life were overshadowed by the family's reduced economic position. The main house at Whittingehame had to be vacated, and Balfour depended on his salary from various company directorships. At his death on 14 January 1945, aged ninety-one, he was living in Lady Eleanor's Cottage on the Whittingehame estate, where he was buried. His son, Robert Arthur Lytton, Viscount Traprain, succeeded him.<br>
