<span class="headword">Williams,  Denis Joseph Ivan <span class="st"> [Dennis]</span></span>  (1923&#150;1998), <span class="occ">artist, archaeologist, and novelist</span>, was born on 1 February 1923 in Georgetown, British Guiana, the son of Joseph Alexander Williams, a merchant, and his wife, Isabella, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Adonis, a seamstress and amateur painter, and lady's maid to an expatriate wife. He was originally named Joseph Ivan Denis Williams, but always gave his forenames in the order Denis Joseph Ivan. His visit in 1931 to the colony's first Arts and Crafts Exhibition was seminal to his early ambitions in art. He began to attend Saturday morning art classes taken by expatriate British amateur artists, and won first prizes in watercolours, oils, and drawing after his first year. He attended private schools in Georgetown, the Progressive High School, then the Tutorial High School where, in 1941, he passed the Cambridge senior school certificate. He was an early member of the newly formed Guianese Art Group and in 1945 won a British Council scholarship to study art in Britain.<br>
<br>Williams was a fine arts student at the Camberwell School of Art in south London from 1946 to 1948. His teachers included leading artists of the time: William Coldstream, Lawrence Gowing, and Victor Pasmore. His paintings exhibited at the Berkeley Galleries in 1949 were commended by the artist and critic Wyndham Lewis in <span class="italic">The Listener</span>. On 9 July the same year, in London, he married the Welsh-born Catherine Alice Hughes (1917&#150;2001), and together they raised their five daughters. A short return home to British Guiana, also in 1949, convinced Williams of the impossibility of making a living there as an artist/art teacher. Back in London the following year he produced new, powerful paintings, some based on those entitled <span class="italic">Plantation Studies</span>, <span class="italic">Origins</span>, and <span class="italic">Burden or Release</span> which he had recently made and exhibited in British Guiana. Thanks to Wyndham Lewis's acceptance of his invitation to view this work Williams was given a show, with Scottie Wilson, at Gimpel Fils, the Mayfair gallery, in December 1950. The show was dominated by Williams's four large paintings in tempera and oil, entitled <span class="italic">Four Dimensions of Anguish</span>, their centrepiece being <span class="italic">Human World</span>, a complex, arresting image of the post-war population of London's streets. The exhibition was reviewed most positively in <span class="italic">Time</span> magazine; in <span class="italic">The Listener</span>, under the heading &#145;A Negro artist&#146;, Lewis hailed Williams's &#145;very remarkable talent&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Listener</span>, 7 Dec 1959). <span class="italic">Human World</span> was purchased by public subscription in British Guiana and became the basis of its national collection.<br>
<br>Williams's work was shown in further exhibitions at Gimpel Fils, in London and in Paris, and in other prestigious galleries in London each year until 1956, including the landmark exhibition This is Tomorrow at the Whitechapel Art Gallery in the latter year. The titles of these exhibitions, and the artists showing alongside Williams, reflect his place in the British avant-garde of the time. He was meanwhile a visiting tutor at the Slade and teaching at the Central School of Art and Crafts; friendships developed with fellow artist-teachers, especially Roger Hilton&#151;with whom Williams shared several exhibitions&#151;and Keith Vaughan. <span class="italic">Painting in Six Related Rhythms</span>, Williams's entry to the Young Artists Exhibition at the New Burlington Galleries in 1955, was awarded a prize in the next band after a painting entered by Lucian Freud; the judges included Graham Sutherland, Herbert Read, and Anthony Blunt. Williams's painting exemplified yet another of the rapid changes in style and form which his work underwent during the 1950s.<br>
<br>Williams seemed assured of a successful career as an artist in Britain, yet he came to reject such a future and his self-perceived identity as a &#145;Black Englishman&#146;  (A. Walmsley, interview with D. Williams, 26&#150;27 Nov 1993). He began applying for teaching posts in Africa and in 1957 moved from London to Khartoum, with Catherine and their young children.<br>
<br>The Technical Institute of Khartoum's School of Art, Williams's first African posting, was a major centre for art in Africa. Williams found the local culture more Islamic than African and undertook independent travels in east and central Africa. The desert environment of northern Sudan did not prove conducive to art-making so he turned to writing, with his first novel <span class="italic">Other Leopards</span> (1963) set in the Sudan. Yet the desert remains of antique Napatan and Meroitic cultures, and newly excavated artefacts, provided his first direct experience of archaeology, and marked the start of his interest in local African technologies used in making art.<br>
<br>In 1962 Williams moved to Nigeria at the invitation of Ulli Beier, the German-born editor and promoter of African culture, then based at Ife. Williams's initial assignment was to direct two art workshops&#151;the second jointly with the celebrated African-American artist Jacob Lawrence&#151;at the Mbari Mbayo Club in the small town of &Ograve;sogbo, an important centre of Yoruba culture and hub of the ferment of the country's post-independence creativity. Jacob Afolabi and Twins Seven Seven were among the artists who attended these workshops. Williams was then offered a teaching post at the newly founded Institute of African Art at the University of Ife and, after four years, at the University of Ibadan's School of African and Asian Studies. In both posts he undertook rigorous archaeological and anthropological research, established museum collections of African artefacts, and edited journals. His writing on west African arts and their technologies included articles on Benin bronzes and Yoruba masquerade festivals, and culminated in his pioneering book <span class="italic">Icon and Image: a Study of Sacred and Secular Forms of African Classical Art</span> (1974). His second novel, <span class="italic">The Third Temptation</span> (1968), was written while he was on leave with his family in Wales, where it is set. Williams meanwhile held visiting posts at Makerere University in Uganda, where, in 1962, he had attended the first African Writers' Conference.<br>
<br>Williams left Nigeria for Guyana in 1967, the year after its independence, and spent the remaining thirty years of his life there. He first lived at Issano in the Upper Mazaruni area of the interior where, with Toni Dixon (<i>b</i>. 1940), who became his second wife in 1975, he established a farm and brought up their young family of five children. Artefacts unearthed there were his first encounter with Guyana's ancient Amerindian cultures. The rainforest featured in his large painting, <span class="italic">Majestas</span>, made as the centrepiece of a triptych for a nearby church, and was the setting of a novel long in progress, <span class="italic">The Sperm of God</span> (1972). He delivered the Edgar Mittelholzer lectures in Georgetown in 1969, entitled &#145;Image and idea in the arts of Guyana&#146;. In 1974 he moved to Georgetown as Guyana's first director of art. He quickly established key institutions: the Burrowes School of Art, of which he was first principal, the Walter Roth Museum, of which he was director, and the Museum of African Heritage. He co-ordinated the national art collection and pressed for a national gallery, opened at Castellani House in 1993, and curated art exhibitions in Guyana and elsewhere in the region, writing authoritative catalogue essays. His support for individual artists was legendary. Several national monuments were commissioned at his instigation, most notably Philip Moore's <span class="italic">1763 Monument</span>; his own contribution to public art was the vast mural <span class="italic">Memorabilia II</span>, in the National Cultural Centre in Georgetown.<br>
<br>Alongside his work in art, and with little financial help, Williams conducted archaeological surveys and excavations and published his findings, mainly in the journal <span class="italic">Archaeology and Anthropology</span>, which he founded and edited. Jennifer Wishart (<i>b</i>. 1947), his secretary as director of art, was his first field assistant, his companion for many years and mother of his youngest child. An MA in prehistory at the University of Guyana led to his appointment (in 1980) as visiting research scholar at the department of anthropology, Smithsonian Institution, Washington, DC; he was awarded an honorary DLitt by the University of the West Indies in 1989, and in Guyana the Cacique crown of honour. He was able to bring to completion his important book <span class="italic">Prehistoric Guiana</span> (2003) by the time of his death from cancer at his house in Thorns Drive, Durban Backlands, Georgetown, on 28 June 1998. He was buried at St Sidwell's churchyard, Georgetown, on 4 July.<br>
