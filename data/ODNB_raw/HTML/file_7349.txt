<span class="headword">Dawson,  James</span>  (1716/17&#150;1746), <span class="occ">Jacobite army officer</span>, was born at Salford, the eldest of the four children of William Dawson, apothecary of Manchester, and his first wife, Elizabeth, daughter of Richard Allen of Redivales in Bury, Lancashire, and a first cousin of the poet and stenographer John Byrom. Educated at Mr Clayton's school, Manchester, he was admitted to Lincoln's Inn on 23 January 1734. Dawson then entered St John's College, Cambridge, on 21 October 1737, at the age of twenty, with the intention of joining the church. He matriculated in the following December. However, his was not a lengthy undergraduate career for, having become &#145;acquainted with the rakes of the university, he run all manner of lengths with them&#146; until, facing expulsion, he left the college. Never the less, there is nothing to show that he had ever been subjected to any punishment for any offence in the university court held by the vice chancellor.<br>
<br>In November 1745, aware that the army of Charles Edward Stuart was approaching Manchester, Dawson joined the Jacobite forces, where he gained a captain's commission. He proved a willing recruit, being:<blockquote>so hearty in the cause, that he beat up for voluntiers himself, and took fellows in Manchester to enlist. In all their marches he appeared at the head of his company, and when the young Pretender made a general review of his army at Macclesfield, he passed before him with the usual formalities. He likewise at Carlisle, mounted guard there, and was called captain, and was among the rest of the officers at the surrender of the town [in December 1745]. (<span class="italic">State trials</span>, 18.374&#150;5)</blockquote>Dawson was tried and convicted of high treason on 17 July 1746 and was one of eight officers belonging to the Manchester regiment of volunteers who were hanged, drawn, and quartered on Kennington Common on 30 July 1746. According to a traditional story, had Dawson been pardoned, the day of his execution would have been the day of his marriage to Katherine Norton, &#145;a young lady of good family and handsome fortune&#146;. She is said to have followed him to the place of execution accompanied by friends and, seeing &#145;the fire kindled which was to consume the heart she knew so much devoted to her, and all the other dreadful preparations for his fate&#146;, drew her head back into the coach, and, crying out, &#145;My dear, I follow thee&#151;I follow thee! Sweet Jesus, receive both our souls together&#146;, expired in the very moment she was speaking  (<span class="italic">State trials</span>, 18.374&#150;5). This incident was made the subject of a popular ballad by William Shenstone.<br>
