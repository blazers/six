<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Walsingham,  Edward</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1663), <span class="occ">royalist author</span>, possibly came from the &#145;genteel&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>: <span class="italic">Fasti</span>, 2.60) family of Exhall, Warwickshire, distantly related to Elizabeth's secretary of state, Francis Walsingham. He came under the patronage of the Digby family of the earls of Bristol, a dominant aristocratic force in Warwickshire, and following the outbreak of the civil war became secretary to the secretary of state, George, Lord Digby, under whose favour, as high steward of Oxford, he was made MA (or possibly LLB) of the university in 1643. He went on to compose a series of elegiac tributes to cavalier commanding officers fallen in the civil war, writings which etched out royalist propaganda themes. One of the messages of these works was the equation between royalism and rank&#151;as in his tribute to Sir Henry Gage, <span class="italic">Alter Britanniae heros</span> (1645)&#151;and the obverse equation of parliamentarianism and base birth. As a royalist military obituarist, in his panegyric on Sir John Smith, <span class="italic">Britannicae virtutis imago</span> (1645), he was celebrating the disappearing chivalric world of a man said to have been the last banneret, knighted on the field, &#145;That noble, valiant, gallant knight renowned Smith&#146;  (Carlton, 193). The same hero, though, was the victim of some of Walsingham's less felicitous versifying:<blockquote>
<div>His name was Smith, who for his king fighting<br>
</div>
<div>Unto his foes seem'd a flash of Lightning.<br>
</div> (Walsingham, 143)</blockquote>However, the primary purpose of these elegies was not to make a social point about royalism but a religious one, and specifically a distinctively Catholic one: that Catholicism and self-sacrificial loyalty to the crown were entirely compatible, and that the Catholic faith formed the foundations for royalist martyrdoms. It was in his memorial to Sir John Digby, <span class="italic">Hector Britannicus</span>, unpublished until 1910, that Walsingham achieved the fullest &#145;subsuming of the Catholic gentleman with the Royalist cause&#146;  (Newman, 210). While all his heroic subjects in this series were Catholics by faith, Walsingham's Digby was the very perfect gentle Catholic knight, whose defiance of the Scots in the bishops' war&#151;&#145;Sr I am a Roman Catholique and so am resolved to live and dy&#146;  (Walsingham, 77)&#151;he lovingly recalled. Already by the mid-1640s, then, when his own sympathies were so clearly Catholic, he was showing that tendency that was to haunt the remainder of his life, that of subjugating the interests of political royalism to those of religious Catholicism.<br>
<br>Even so, Walsingham was deeply involved in royalist espionage work in the mid-1640s. From the personal tone of the intelligence-gathering correspondence that he sent to Digby from Oxford&#151;&#145;Sir John Digby's death affect me greatly&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1645&#150;7</i>, 51&#150;3)&#151;we may assume that the letters were his own. They provided broad, informed, and sharply written surveys of current affairs in Britain and the rest of Europe and, on the basis of these briefings alone, it would be possible to agree with the description of him as the &#145;young Catholic intellectual &hellip; brilliantly gifted&#146;  (Roy, 85) who served George Digby, feeding in particular his rivalry with Prince Rupert and his ambitions as a Catholic royalist leader: &#145;Now is the time for your Lordship to make this poor kingdom happy&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1645&#150;7</i>, 140).<br>
<br>Malice and meddling were the darker sides of Walsingham's high gifts. In February 1648 he could still be described, by the Anglican royalist secretary of state, Sir Edward Nicholas (whose protestant royalist circle detested Walsingham), as a &#145;pragmatical knave&#146;  (Roy, 86), &#145;busy instrument of the Jesuits&#146;  (Warner, 2.142), and &#145;great babbler of his most secret employments&#146; in the character of &#145;Lord Digby's intimate servant&#146;  (Walsingham, 63, 94 n. a). However, by late August, Digby was reported &#145;discarding Walsingham for giving offence&#146;  (ibid., 94).<br>
<br>Walsingham's capacity for disruptive conduct in the most delicate affairs was shown at its worst in 1648 in Ireland, where his busy aim of obtaining maximum religious gains for Irish Catholics ran counter to the marquess of Ormond's patient negotiations between September 1648 and January 1649 to achieve accord between protestant royalists and Catholic confederates based on Ormond's assent to &#145;the repeal of the penalties in any statutes which affected the free exercise of the <i>Roman</i> Catholick Religion&#146;  (Carte, 2.48). Part of Walsingham's fault line was, clearly, his tendency to present&#151;and distort&#151;material in line with his own passionately partisan commitment, so that, for example, when it was reported in March 1651 that he was to have charge of editing Ormond's papers, it was claimed (by Nicholas) that &#145;all honest men&#146; would disvalue the edition that had come &#145;through his hands&#146;  (Warner, 1.225). In the early 1650s he was a focus of the Catholic factionalism that threatened to disrupt the already divisive life of the English court in Paris (where he had already spent some time between 1646 and 1648). In April 1651 it was reported that the queen's favourite Lord Jermyn, in his bid to become &#145;first Minister of State&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1651</i>, 127) in the government in exile, had picked Walsingham for a secretary. More dangerously, in terms of a realistic Stuart hope of the family's return to a devotedly protestant country, between June and November 1655 he was hard at work attempting to convert Charles II's youngest brother Henry, duke of Gloucester, to Rome: Parisian <i>cur&eacute;s</i> were said to be offering prayers of gratitude for that outcome and rooms in the Jesuits' college were being prepared for the duke. Key features of Walsingham's character&#151;hero worship, especially for Lord Digby, combined with malice and innuendo, exaggeration of his own role in the world, excess religious partisanship, and hyperbole, are seen in the reports of his Paris conversation with Gloucester in November 1654: he<blockquote>spared none of you [the Nicholas cavalier circle] there or any loyall person elsewhere, [and] told <i>the</i> <i>Duke of Gloucester</i> that he was a confident of his blessed father even above his <i>Councell</i>, and that <i>Lo. Digby</i> was soe much the ablest <i>Councell</i> to the <i>King</i> &hellip; and that this <i>Lo. Digby</i>, as he had allwayes told him [Walsingham] he preferred the Romish before the English church, had now put himselfe into a <i>Jesuites'</i> colledge, where he had declared himselfe a <i>Papist</i>. (Warner, 2.134)</blockquote>Understandably, in December, Nicholas was hoping that Walsingham would soon be forbidden Gloucester's company.<br>
<br>In the following year, though, Walsingham did not devise but instead scotched, by disclosing it, a conspiracy&#151;one, or rather two, mooted by Catholic and presbyterian royalists to remove the indispensable Edward Hyde (later earl of Clarendon) from Charles II's counsels. Whatever Walsingham's motives were in this disclosure, Hyde seems to have been grateful to him for it, and in July 1659 had confidential correspondence entrusted to him, identifying him as a relative of the earl of Bristol. Yet Walsingham did not return with the royalist exiles in 1660; he was ordained a Catholic priest in the year of the Restoration and stayed in France as secretary to the confessor of an English <i>&eacute;migr&eacute;</i> convent. He returned to England in 1663 and died there on 9 October of that year. He was ardent, hyperactive, passionately sincere, and gifted, a victim and archetype of the sterility of Stuart royalism for much of the 1640s and 50s.<br>
