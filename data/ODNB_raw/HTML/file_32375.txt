<span class="headword">Charrington,  Frederick Nicholas</span>  (1850&#150;1936), <span class="occ">philanthropist and temperance reformer</span>, was born in London on 4 February 1850, the eldest son of Frederick Charrington, a brewer, and his wife, Louisa, the daughter of Huxley Griffith of Stepney. After two terms at Marlborough College, in 1864, he left and a year later was sent to Brighton College (1865&#150;7). On leaving school he travelled on the continent, and afterwards went into a brewery at Windsor to learn the details of the trade. A place was then found for him in his father's firm of Charrington &amp; Co., but in 1870 he relinquished it in order to take up the cause of Christianity and temperance in the district surrounding the brewery in the East End.<br>
<br>Charrington's action created a considerable impression: at a meeting of the Band of Hope over which he presided there was a crowded audience. The early meetings of the Tower Hamlets mission which he founded were held in a tent, but his efforts met with success: a conference hall was built, and later (in 1886) the great assembly hall in Mile End Road to hold 5000 people. Here every Sunday Charrington provided a free tea for 700 hungry men and women of the district, and in 1909 George V, then prince of Wales, gave the first of an annual series of free teas.<br>
<br>Charrington's ardent advocacy of the causes which he championed provoked considerable opposition. During his campaigns against the London music-halls in the 1870s and 1880s he was frequently assaulted and twice arrested for harassing music-hall patrons. In 1885 he was found guilty of slander and libel of a music-hall owner, and an injunction was issued to prevent him from distributing tracts outside Lusby's Music Hall. At times he allowed his fervent enthusiasm to carry him to fantastic lengths. On 18 May 1915, when the House of Commons was discussing the report of a select committee on pensions, Charrington, wearing evening dress, an overcoat, and a silk hat, dashed into the house from the members' lobby, seized the mace from the speaker's table, and began to protest against the drinking bar inside the lobby being used by members. He was arrested, but released after two hours' detention.<br>
<br>Charrington was one of the original members (1889&#150;95) of the London county council, a member of the old Mile End guardians and vestry, and later of the Stepney borough council. As a member of the LCC he opposed all applications for liquor licences. In the early twentieth century he purchased Osea Island (off the coast of Essex), which he made a temperance seaside and health resort. Charrington died, unmarried, at 3 Devonshire Terrace, Marylebone, on 2 January 1936. He left his body to the medical school of the London Hospital.<br>
