<span class="headword">Taylor <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Coles]</span>,  Elizabeth</span>  (1912&#150;1975), <span class="occ">writer</span>, was born on 3 July 1912 at Reading, Berkshire, the daughter of Oliver Coles, an insurance inspector, and his wife, Elsie May Fewtrell. She was educated at the Abbey School in Reading, where Jane Austen&#151;the writer Elizabeth Taylor most admired, and to whom she was often compared&#151;was a former pupil. After leaving school Elizabeth worked as a governess, and then in a library. She joined the Communist Party in her early twenties and delivered leaflets from door to door in various London boroughs. She later transferred her allegiance to the Labour Party, which she supported for the rest of her life. In 1936 she married John William Kendall Taylor (<i>b</i>. 1908/9), the owner of a confectionery business, and settled with him at Penn in Buckinghamshire. Their children&#151;a son, Ren&eacute;, and a daughter, Jo&#151;were born in the late 1930s.<br>
<br>Elizabeth Taylor's first novel, <span class="italic">At Mrs Lippincote's</span>, was published in 1945. It was followed a year later by <span class="italic">Palladian</span>, which&#151;more than any other of her works&#151;displays the influence of Jane Austen. There are several sly references to <span class="italic">Northanger Abbey</span> and <span class="italic">Mansfield Park</span>, and the principal female character is named Cassandra Dashwood. Despite her political sympathies, Taylor gives no indication in this curious novel of an England ravaged by war: the bombed sites, bread queues, and ration books are all notably absent. The man who woos Cassandra is an aesthete called Marion Vanbrugh, who lives in a decaying country house and reads the Greek classics in the original. <span class="italic">Palladian</span> is rescued from bookishness, from literary parody, by the vividly drawn people on the periphery of Cassandra's and Marion's courtship&#151;the vengeful nanny (encountered, perhaps, during Taylor's time as a governess) who &#145;feigned eccentricity as Hamlet feigned part of his madness&#146;, and the alcoholic Tom, who &#145;could not bear stoicism in those he hurt, could not bear the guilt of forcing them into such courage&#146;. This last observation is typical of the shrewd analyst of the human heart Elizabeth Taylor was to become in the fiction of her maturity.<br>
<br>The world Elizabeth Taylor describes in her twelve novels and four collections of short stories is confined, in the main, to the English home counties. The majority of her men and women have outwardly comfortable lives. They patronize tearooms and antique shops, attend gymkhanas and church f&ecirc;tes, and seldom discuss the burning issues of the day. Her prose is clear, almost to the point of transparency, and thus an immediate pleasure to read. This clarity of expression is the product of deep and careful consideration, for Taylor believed that the best art always gives the appearance of effortlessness. She is a stylist in the Evelyn Waugh mode, using the right word in the right place to maximum effect. In the late story &#145;Sisters&#146;, from <span class="italic">The Devastating Boys</span> (1972), the protagonist, Mrs Mason, is described as &#145;made for widowhood&#146; and the widow's complacency is conveyed in a few deft phrases: &#145;Mrs Mason pottered in her garden, played patience in the winter, or read historical romances from the library. &#147;Something light&#148;, she would tell the assistant, as if seeking suggestions from a waiter&#146;. Elizabeth Taylor is one of those writers who concern themselves with seeming domestic trivia, with the unimportant quotidian. When she creates a &#145;comic turn&#146;, usually in the form of a charwoman, she takes discreet pains to show that the performance is a form of self-protection, put on for the employer's amusement. In what is probably her finest novel, <span class="italic">Mrs Palfrey at the Claremont</span> (1971), which is set in a genteel Kensington hotel occupied entirely by the elderly, the sadness of Mrs Palfrey's plight is offset with many exquisite humorous touches. The other, more famous Elizabeth Taylor, the film actress, is alluded to when the &#145;blowsy Mrs Burton&#146; comes to stay, and an unpleasant old bigot, Lady Swayne, prefaces her most repellent pronouncements with &#145;I'm afraid&#146;: &#145;I'm afraid I'd like to see the Prime Minister hanged, drawn and quartered.&#146;<br>
<br>Elizabeth Taylor was much admired by Elizabeth Bowen and Angus Wilson, who were also distinguished practitioners of the short story. The short form was her m&eacute;tier, in which&#151;as Wilson once observed&#151;her &#145;warm heart, sharp claws and exceptional powers of formal balance&#146; were joined together in perfect artistic harmony. She is, essentially, a miniaturist, as her stories continue to demonstrate, never more persuasively than in the mordant &#145;A Dedicated Man&#146; in the collection with that title (1965). This is one of Taylor's masterpieces, and in it two frustrated, fraudulent lives&#151;lives replete with snobbery and duplicity&#151;are examined and exposed in satisfying detail.<br>
<br>Elizabeth Taylor was shy by nature and genuinely modest, given to blushing when praised to her face. She was also, as the poet and critic D. J. Enright noted in an obituary that appeared in <span class="italic">The Bookseller</span>, extremely pretty. Enright had been her editor at Chatto and Windus, but her work needed very little editing since she was scrupulous in matters of style and punctuation.<br>
<br>For many years Taylor maintained a correspondence with the novelist, critic, and biographer Robert Liddell. He lived in Greece and Italy and welcomed her news from England. They had one great friend in common, the novelist Ivy Compton-Burnett, and Elizabeth Taylor recounted every visit she made to Ivy's flat in Kensington. Very few of these letters survive, though to judge by the two or three quotations from them in Hilary Spurling's <span class="italic">Secrets of a Woman's Heart: the Later Life of I. Compton-Burnett, 1920&#150;1969</span> (1984), they must have been vivid and brilliantly detailed. Taylor describes this friendship by post in the story &#145;The Letter Writers&#146; (in the collection <span class="italic">The Blush</span>, published in 1951). She and Liddell made a pact that the letters would be destroyed at their deaths, and alas they kept that pact.<br>
<br>One of the reasons why Elizabeth Taylor's friendship with Ivy Compton-Burnett lasted so well was that the latter was fond of chocolates. Whenever she went to London, Elizabeth Taylor never forgot to bring a box of the most expensive chocolates from her husband's factory. These were accepted with gratitude, though Compton-Burnett deplored their cost, wondering why Mr Taylor could not manufacture cheaper sweets.<br>
<br>In 1974 Elizabeth Taylor was diagnosed as having an inoperable cancer. &#145;Try to keep me alive until I have finished my novel&#146;, she urged the doctors who examined her. That novel, <span class="italic">Blaming</span>, was published posthumously, in 1976. She died at her home, Grove's Barn, Penn, on 19 November 1975. A selection of her best stories, with the apposite title <span class="italic">Dangerous Calm</span>, appeared in 1995. It confirmed her steadily growing reputation as one of the most assured English short-story writers of the twentieth century.<br>
