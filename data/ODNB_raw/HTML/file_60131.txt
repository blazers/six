<span class="headword">Reeves,  John Morris</span> <span class="st"> [<em>pseud. </em>James Reeves]</span>  (1909&#150;1978), <span class="occ">poet and educationist</span>, was born on 1 July 1909 at 7 Hamilton Road, Wealdstone, Harrow on the Hill, Middlesex, the elder son of Albert John Reeves, company secretary, and his wife, Ethel Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Blench. He was educated at Nevill House, Eastbourne, and then from 1923 to 1928 at the recently founded Stowe School. His open scholarship at Jesus College, Cambridge, in 1928 was the first Oxbridge scholarship won by a pupil at Stowe. At Cambridge he read English, taking a second class (division one) in both parts of the tripos, and as an undergraduate he collaborated with Jacob Bronowski to found and edit the influential literary magazine <span class="italic">Experiment</span>, to which the poet William Empson contributed. Graduating in 1931, in 1933 he embarked on a teaching career. His first post, at Holloway School, was terminated in 1935 on grounds of poor eyesight, a progressive disability that finally compelled him to retire from teaching. On 4 April 1936 he married Mary (1909/10&#150;1966), the daughter of Edward Douglas Phillips, at the parish church of St Peter, Bayswater, in London. At that time Reeves was resident at 54 Lyndhurst Road, Chichester. The couple had one son and two daughters.<br>
<br>James Reeves was a prolific writer: in the course of his career he wrote or edited over a hundred books. After his retirement from teaching in schools and colleges of education in 1952, he turned to full-time freelance writing. His poetry for both adults and children, the first collected in <span class="italic">Collected Poems, 1929&#150;74</span>, and the second in <span class="italic">Complete Poems for Children</span> (1973), is generally regarded as his most important work. However, he also contributed significantly to new methods of teaching and presenting poetry to children, first during his own teaching career, and later, after his retirement, through such books as <span class="italic">Teaching Poetry</span> (1958), <span class="italic">Understanding Poetry</span> (1965), and (with Martin Seymour-Smith) <span class="italic">Inside Poetry</span> (1970). His work as teacher and creative writer was integrated in his study <span class="italic">How to Write Poems for Children</span> (1971). Reeves was a versatile and imaginative anthologist, and also produced many volumes of retold traditional stories for children. In 1951 he was appointed general editor of William Heinemann's <span class="roman">Poetry Bookshelf</span> series, and in 1960 general editor of Unicorn Books. His career as a children's poet, now regarded as perhaps the most important part of his achievement, began in 1950, relatively late in life and only a short time before his retirement from teaching, with the publication of <span class="italic">The Wandering Moon</span>. Much of his work for children was illustrated by Edward Ardizzone, with whom he developed a highly successful collaborative partnership. In 1958 he returned to Cambridge for a short time, in order to research his important book on English folk-songs, <span class="italic">The Idiom of the People</span>. He became a fellow of the Royal Society of Literature.<br>
<br>Reeves was a friendly and generous man, but intolerant of pretentiousness and falsity, at which he could direct a mordantly satiric intelligence. In some respects he felt out of tune with the modern world, distrusting what he believed to be the distancing effect on individual experience brought about by the media. He complained of the &#145;nightmare of sensationalism, violence, hysteria and threatened destruction&#146;  (&#145;Introduction&#146; to <span class="italic">Collected Poems, 1929&#150;1959</span>, 19) to which constant second-hand news subjected the individual sensibility, and felt that privacy was threatened in the modern world. Himself a private man, he was nevertheless a natural teacher, held in much admiration and affection by his students.<br>
<br>Having been resident for some time at Danesbury House, Chalfont St Giles, Buckinghamshire, Reeves moved in 1962 to Flints, Rotten Row, Lewes, Sussex, where he spent the rest of his life. Mary Reeves died in 1966. Reeves himself died suddenly of heart failure on 1 May 1978 at his home, and his funeral took place at St Anne's Church, Lewes, on 8 May.<br>
