<span class="headword">Landsborough,  William</span>  (1825&#150;1886), <span class="occ">explorer in Australia</span>, the third son of the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15981/', "Revd David Landsborough (1779&#150;1854)")</script> and his wife, Margaret (1797/8&#150;1834), the daughter of James McLeish of Port Glasgow, was born on 21 February 1825 at Stevenston, near Saltcoats, Ayrshire. He was one of four sons and three daughters. He was educated at Irvine Academy, Irvine. In 1841 he joined his older brothers, John and James, in Australia on their New England pastoral run. After a stint on the Bathurst goldfields from 1849, he went to Queensland in 1852 and took up Westholm in the Wide Bay district. From 1854 he explored a vast area of the Rockhampton hinterland with several fellow entrepreneurs; they surveyed and sold new pastoral runs, meanwhile retaining the choicest country, so that Landsborough held extensive leases by 1861.<br>
<br>That year Landsborough led an official party in an unsuccessful search for the lost explorers Robert O'Hara Burke and William Wills. After an initial foray to the south-west, Landsborough started in February 1862 from his depot on the lower Gulf of Carpentaria and crossed the continent from north to south. Some charged him with concentrating on pastoral discovery and neglecting his official duty, but Landsborough was honoured with vice-regal receptions in Melbourne, Sydney, and Brisbane. His journal (<span class="italic">Landsborough's Expedition from Carpentaria, in Search of Burke and Wills</span>) was published in 1862, and in London in 1863 he received the Royal Geographical Society's presentation gold watch.<br>
<br>Landsborough was appointed to the Queensland legislative council in 1862 and took his seat in 1864, but resigned the following year. He was now a senior partner in Bowen Downs, a large central Queensland property, which expanded northwards in 1864 to the newly occupied Burke district on the Gulf of Carpentaria; the next year Landsborough successfully applied for the position of police magistrate in the Burke district. Here he conducted further exploration and avidly championed the Burke region, but the initial settlement was beset by adversity; Landsborough's administrative task was inordinately difficult, while his critics decried his failure to provide strong leadership, the impropriety of his interests in local business, and his suppression of a charge against a Bowen Downs associate for the alleged lynching of a Chinese labourer. By the time he was removed from office in 1870 Landsborough was financially ruined through the failure of his Burke pastoral interests.<br>
<br>The following year Landsborough was summarily dismissed when supervising road works near St George; thereafter he served as inspector of brands in the Moreton district. For services to exploration the government awarded him &pound;2000 in 1881, with which he purchased Loch Lamerough near Caloundra. A devoted family man, he married Caroline Hollingsworth Raine on 30 December 1862; they had three daughters, Fanny, Janet, and Sweersena. Caroline died in 1869, and on 8 March 1873 Landsborough married a widow, Maria Theresa Carr (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Carter), with whom he had three sons, Sydney, Leslie, and Lionel. Landsborough died on 17 March 1886, probably of cancer, and was buried with Anglican rites at Loch Lamerough; in 1913 his remains were reinterred in Toowong cemetery, Brisbane.<br>
