<span class="headword">Bemrose,  William</span>  (1831&#150;1908), <span class="occ">writer on wood-carving and ceramics</span>, was born at Derby on 30 December 1831, the second son in a family of three sons and one daughter of William Bemrose of Derby, founder in 1827 of the printing and publishing firm of William Bemrose &amp; Sons of Derby and London. His mother was Elizabeth Ride of Lichfield. His elder brother, Henry Howe Bemrose (1827&#150;1912), was Conservative member of parliament for Derby from 1895 to 1900 and was knighted in 1897.<br>
<br>After education at King William's College in the Isle of Man, Bemrose, like his brother Henry, joined his father's business, which passed to the management of the two brothers on their father's retirement in 1857, and grew rapidly in all directions. In 1858 Bemrose married Margaret Romana (<i>d</i>. 1901), only daughter of Edward Lloyd Simpson of Spondon, with whom he had five sons and one daughter. Although always active in the printing business, Bemrose pursued many other interests. In middle life he became a director of the Royal Crown Derby porcelain works, and thus helped to revive an important local industry.<br>
<br>Bemrose travelled and studied varied forms of art, on which he wrote with much success. Practising in early life wood-carving, fret-cutting, and modelling in clay, he compiled useful manuals on these subjects for the instruction of amateurs, which were well illustrated and circulated widely. The chief of these was his <span class="italic">Manual of Wood-Carving</span> (1862), the first work of its kind in England, which reached a twenty-third edition in 1906. This was followed by several other instructional works on wood-carving, marquetry, and paper mosaic work. Meanwhile Bemrose's association with the local pottery led him to publish three authoritative works on china. The first, with A. Wallis, was <span class="italic">The Pottery and Porcelain of Derbyshire</span> (1870), followed by his own <span class="italic">Bow, Chelsea and Derby Porcelain</span> (1898) and <span class="italic">Longton Hall Porcelain</span> (1906).<br>
<br>Bemrose was also a clever amateur painter in oils and watercolour. He collected pictures, china, and objects of vertu, especially rare specimens of Egyptian art, which he acquired on visits to the East. In 1885 he published a sumptuously illustrated and finely printed <span class="italic">Life and Work of Joseph Wright</span>. <span class="italic">A Descriptive Catalogue of Porcelain and other Art Objects</span> in his own collection was published in 1898. He also wrote on technical education and archaeological and topographical subjects. In 1905 he was elected a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries. Bemrose played an active part in local affairs of Derby, and was for many years chairman of the Railway Servants' Orphanage. In 1903 Bemrose married as his second wife Lilian, daughter of William John Cumming MRCS of Matlock, and widow of Alderman William Hobson of Derby, proprietor of the <span class="italic">Derbyshire Advertiser</span>. He died on 6 August 1908 at Bridlington, Yorkshire, while on a short holiday, and was buried at the new cemetery, Derby.<br>
