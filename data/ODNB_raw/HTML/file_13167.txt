<span class="headword">Heydon, Sir  Henry</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1504), <span class="occ">lawyer</span>, was the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/52787/', "John Heydon (d. 1479)")</script> of Baconsthorpe, Norfolk, the well-known opponent of the Paston family, and of Eleanor, daughter of Edmund Winter (<i>d</i>. 1448) of Barningham in the same county. A Norfolk JP from 1473, he frequently acted as a feoffee, arbitrator, and adviser for other landowners. During his career he also served on various <i>ad hoc</i> commissions, mainly in Norfolk but sometimes elsewhere. He married, probably after 1463, Anne (<i>d</i>. 1509/10), the second daughter of Sir Geoffrey Boleyn, a wealthy London mercer of Norfolk origin and the great-grandfather of Henry VIII's queen Anne Boleyn. Heydon inherited at least sixteen manors from his father, but began buying land in Norfolk (sometimes in competition with the Pastons) and Kent during John's lifetime. As Kent landowners the Boleyns perhaps encouraged Heydon to buy manors at West Wickham and elsewhere in the county in 1469, and he served as a JP there in the late 1480s and 1490s. A trustee for the Kent purchase was Henry Stafford, duke of Buckingham, for whose widow Heydon was an estate steward in Norfolk by the 1490s. By this date Heydon had also become steward of the household and chief bailiff of the honour of Eye on behalf of Cecily, duchess of York, whose will of 1495 he supervised.<br>
<br>Although he was knighted at Henry VII's coronation, Heydon remained in Norfolk rather than obey the king's summons for help against Lambert Simnel in 1487. Later, however, he attended several court occasions, including the reception of Katherine of Aragon into England in 1501, but he was primarily a local servant of the crown, rather than a courtier. Heydon died at Baconsthorpe between 20 February and 22 May 1504 leaving eight children. He was buried beside his father in a family chapel, long since vanished, at Norwich Cathedral. John, the eldest of his three sons, became a leading Norfolk gentleman of Henry VIII's reign.<br>
<br>A wealthy sheep farmer, Sir Henry could afford considerable building projects. In Norfolk he completed the castle his father had begun at Baconsthorpe, restored the church at Kelling, and constructed a causeway between Thursford and Walsingham and a new church at Salthouse. In Kent he built a fortified manor house and rebuilt the parish church at West Wickham. The church has a window, said to be a memorial to him, depicting a kneeling human skeleton and the Heydon arms.<br>
