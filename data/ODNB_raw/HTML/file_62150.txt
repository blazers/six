<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Marshall,  Walter Charles</span>, Baron Marshall of Goring  (1932&#150;1996), <span class="occ">physicist and public servant</span>, was born on 5 March 1932 at 15 Tymawr Road, Rumney, Newport, Monmouthshire, the last of three children of Frank Marshall (<i>d</i>. 1939), a baker, and his wife, Amy, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Pearson. His father died when he was seven years old. There was no record of academic ability in his family; his exceptional mathematical gifts were recognized at his grammar school, St Illtyd's College, Cardiff, and he won a scholarship to study mathematical physics at the University of Birmingham. He also became Welsh junior chess champion. He graduated with first-class honours at Birmingham and was awarded a PhD degree at the early age of twenty-two for his thesis, &#145;Antiferromagnetism and neutron scattering from ferromagnets&#146;.<h2>
<a name="Earlycareerinphysics"></a>Early career in physics</h2>Marshall joined the theoretical physics division at the Atomic Energy Research Establishment, Harwell, Berkshire, in 1954. He first investigated the behaviour of shockwaves in magnetically confined plasmas, but soon returned to his interests in solid state physics and magnetism. On 12 April 1955 he married Ann Vivienne Sheppard (<i>b</i>. 1933/4), a schoolteacher, and daughter of Ernest Vivian Sheppard, a commercial traveller; they later had a son and a daughter. Marshall then had two periods of study leave in the USA, at Berkeley, California, in 1957&#150;8, and Harvard, in 1958&#150;9, where he made a great impression and formed many lifelong friendships. He remained strongly pro-American in outlook. On his return to Harwell he was promoted to group leader and then, at the age of twenty-eight, to be head of the theoretical physics division, a powerful group of forty outstanding scientists covering a range of subjects. It was a remarkable opportunity for an able, ambitious, and supremely confident young man, and Marshall exploited the situation brilliantly. The Harwell laboratory became known as a centre of excellence in materials physics and attracted a number of researchers from Britain, Europe, and the USA.<br>
<br>Marshall's major personal contributions were to the theory of the solid state related to magnetic properties, but his interests were wide and he developed, with many colleagues, experimental programmes to expand the theoretical understanding of materials. In particular he sought to expand and promote the use of the new technique of neutron diffraction for the study of the structures of solids and liquids, which had become possible with the generation of beams of neutrons from research reactors. He was the author or co-author of more than sixty papers between 1956 and 1969, and his book <span class="italic">The Theory of Thermal Neutron Scattering</span> (1971), written with Stephen Lovesey, remained the standard text on the subject for many years. In 1964 Marshall delivered the Kelvin lecture to the British Association for the Advancement of Science, entitled &#145;The study of solids and liquids using thermal neutrons&#146;. In the same year he was awarded the Maxwell medal for outstanding contributions to theoretical physics by the Institute of Physics, and in 1971 he was elected to the Royal Society, becoming the youngest fellow at that time. He continued to work on problems in magnetism and superconductivity for mental relaxation, recording the results in a series of handwritten notebooks, but he published no papers on theoretical physics after 1971.<h2>
<a name="TechnicaldirectiontheHarwellyears"></a>Technical direction: the Harwell years</h2>Marshall's demonstrated capacity for scientific leadership and his ability to inspire the work of others led to his appointment as deputy director of the Atomic Energy Research Establishment at Harwell in 1966 and director in 1968. At this time the laboratory was seeking new objectives. Many of the scientific questions that had been vitally important to the early development of nuclear power had been met, and some subjects pioneered at Harwell were being moved to independent organizations. Marshall first attempted to institute at Harwell a high field magnetic laboratory and a research reactor producing high-flux neutron beams, in order to further the scientific leadership he had won in these areas, but the proposals failed to win government support because of lack of funds and because they did not promise the early industrial applications sought by the Ministry of Technology (the responsible department). Marshall accepted that the days of academic freedom at Harwell were over, and that a large, multidisciplinary laboratory like Harwell had to be seen to contribute to the national welfare. He argued for and later implemented a policy of diversification aimed at assisting British industry in specific areas and meeting government objectives outside the nuclear-energy field.<br>
<br>There were formidable difficulties, both internal and external. Legal permission to pursue topics that were not covered by the original nuclear remit of the Atomic Energy Authority (AEA) had to be obtained from the Ministry of Technology, and any government funding through the requirement boards set up by that ministry. In addition, nuclear work for external organizations, mainly the exploitation of irradiation facilities and the provision of radioactive sources, now had to be charged for and the work given a commercial edge. Success depended on gaining funding from an initially uninterested and even hostile industry. The internal problems were also severe. Turning the Harwell of the early 1960s into an organization earning a large fraction of its income from sources outside the AEA involved a cultural revolution. Marshall introduced a project system, cutting across the traditional divisional structure, and gave the main responsibility for making industrial contacts and earning industrial money to the project managers themselves, supported by a contracts and marketing organization. This key decision forced a large number of Harwell staff into close contact with industrial firms and other potential customers, with the result that external hostility fell away as the quality of the scientific support on offer was appreciated.<br>
<br>By 1976 the new &#145;industrial programmes&#146; accounted for 50 per cent of the total effort at Harwell, and the laboratory had a new lease of life. The staff had been reduced by 25 per cent over the previous ten years, but numbers had stabilized by 1975. Marshall was awarded the Glazebrook medal of the Institute of Physics in 1975 for his outstanding administrative achievement. The pattern of work for external customers established at Harwell was followed by other national laboratories, and paved the way for later reorganizations of the AEA.<h2>
<a name="NuclearpoweradvocacyandtheDepartmentofEnergy"></a>Nuclear power advocacy and the Department of Energy</h2>Marshall was appointed to the board of the UK Atomic Energy Authority in 1972. He became deputy chairman in 1975 and chairman in 1981, and was knighted for distinguished public service in 1982. Over this period he became known in Britain and other countries as a consistent, strong supporter of nuclear power.<br>
<br>Paradoxically, a task which brought Marshall to wide public notice concerned energy policy but not nuclear power. He was appointed as part-time chief scientist to the Department of Energy in 1974, with a remit to reorient and expand the department's research programme in the light of the &#145;oil shocks&#146; of the early 1970s. To this end he chaired the Advisory Council on Research and Development for Fuel and Power, and the new Offshore Energy Technology Board. He organized studies of the potential value of new energy technologies against different scenarios of supply projections, and inaugurated the energy technology support unit at Harwell to encourage schemes of energy conservation and to evaluate the potential of renewable sources of energy. He also led a group of academics and members of the electricity supply industry in a study of the feasibility of introducing into Britain large-scale schemes of combined heat and power linked to district heating. The conclusions were that such schemes would not be viable unless gas prices in Britain increased substantially, though a majority favoured building a lead scheme. At the same time Marshall was vigorously pursuing nuclear interests, and he engaged in several attempts to sell British nuclear services in countries starting nuclear power programmes. A clash between him and Tony Benn, who as secretary of state for energy was increasingly suspicious of the nuclear lobby, was, perhaps, inevitable. In 1977 Marshall was asked abruptly to return to full-time duties at the AEA.<br>
<br>Marshall's work on energy policy and projections of fuel supply only strengthened his enthusiasm for nuclear power. He considered that a growing nuclear-power component backed by an efficient nuclear industry was essential both to the long-term stability of energy supplies in this country and to meeting the energy requirements of an expanding world population. He played an important part in the debate in the 1970s about reactor choice. He became convinced that the UK should follow most of the rest of the world and build pressurized water reactors (PWRs), because of the advantages of increased factory fabrication, international technical support, and possible entry to foreign markets. But there were doubts about the safety of high-pressure systems. The most serious criticism, voiced by the government's chief scientist (Sir Alan Cottrell), was that the steel pressure-vessel surrounding the reactor core might fracture under operational or accident conditions. Marshall saw that this concern could be addressed only by a comprehensive analysis of all relevant features of design, fabrication, fracture analysis, non-destructive testing, and quality assurance. He assembled a group of theoreticians and materials scientists, including many academic members, who reported finally that safety criteria could be met by rigorous attention to detail and, in particular, to non-destructive testing during commissioning and in service that was validated independently. This report marked a significant stage in the overall safety case for PWRs, and the exercise demonstrated again Marshall's intellectual ability and technical leadership. He later chaired a task force from the Central Electricity Generating Board (CEGB) and the nuclear industry, charged with determining how the design of a PWR based on that of an American reactor could be altered to accommodate the requirements of the safety regulators in Britain.<br>
<br>Marshall also took a leading role in the British involvement in the International Fuel Cycle Evaluation Exercise launched by President Jimmy Carter in 1977 to assess and reduce the danger of the proliferation of nuclear weapons arising from civilian nuclear power. President Carter had deferred indefinitely the reprocessing of spent fuel from nuclear power stations to recover uranium and plutonium for future use as fuel; he had also cancelled the development of fast (neutron) reactors in the USA, which were most efficient in using plutonium as fuel. Such a strategy was the core of the AEA's programme at the time, and the British, with others, mounted a vigorous defence. Marshall was thanked officially for the part he played. He remained convinced that the long-term future of nuclear power depended on the development of fast reactors which would enable a large proportion of the world's uranium to be used as nuclear fuel, and he considered that fast reactors could be used in ways that would minimize the threat of the proliferation of nuclear weapons. He summarized these arguments in the fifth Cockcroft lecture, published in <span class="italic">Nuclear Energy</span> in 1980. Later, as chairman of the CEGB, he agreed that the board would fund 30 per cent of the total AEA expenditure on fast-reactor development. However, he came to accept that fast reactors would not be economic commercially for many decades, and the British programme did not survive the later break-up of the CEGB.<h2>
<a name="TheCEGBandlateryears"></a>The CEGB and later years</h2>Marshall was appointed chairman of the Central Electricity Generating Board, at the time a state-owned monopoly responsible for electricity in England and Wales, in 1982. He and others believed that a major reason for his appointment was the government's wish to increase the contribution made by nuclear power through building a series of PWRs. However, he accepted that coal would remain the most important fuel for electricity generation for the foreseeable future&#151;gas was barely considered in 1983&#151;and that the board faced organizational problems owing to the increase in size (and hence the decrease in number) of individual power stations.<br>
<br>The first crisis that Marshall faced was linked to the dependence on coal as the main fuel&#151;the long miners' strike in 1984&#150;5. The CEGB had made plans to meet such a situation by building up coal stocks and planning to burn oil in both oil- and coal-fired stations. Marshall believed that the CEGB had an overriding responsibility to maintain electricity supply, and thought that the strike might be a long one. He therefore won board support to burn more oil, at greater cost, since the output from the nuclear stations could not be increased quickly. This strategy was successful in that electricity supplies were not interrupted and the extra cost of oil fuel was borne by the government. Marshall was rewarded with a life peerage, as Baron Marshall of Goring, in 1985. He later confessed that he had enjoyed the excitement of the struggle.<br>
<br>Marshall always insisted on basing policy on sound science, as in the position he took in the debate over acid rain. He was opposed at first to spending large sums on reducing emissions of acid gases from coal-fired stations, but he supported a joint research programme with Norway and Sweden into the effects of acid deposition, and later agreed that control was necessary. Similarly he was concerned that the language used in the debate about nuclear power was scientifically accurate and reflected properly the probability of future events; he disliked jargon and hated sound bites. He gave a series of lectures between 1980 and 1986 on those aspects of nuclear power that caused public unease, including the threat of large accidents and of the proliferation of nuclear weapons, and the problem of radioactive waste disposal, and he inspired and edited a comprehensive set of papers entitled <span class="italic">Nuclear Power Technology</span>, published in 1983.<br>
<br>All nuclear power plans suffered a serious set-back following the accident to a reactor at Chernobyl in the USSR in April 1986. Marshall led the British delegation to the meeting organized by the International Atomic Energy Agency to examine the reasons for and consequences of the accident. He also led a comparative study of design standards and of operating and regulatory practice. He became convinced that such an accident could not happen to a reactor under the conditions imposed in Western countries by the late 1980s, but he saw the danger to the world's nuclear industry posed by the public reaction to Chernobyl and played a leading role in the formation of a worldwide organization aimed at raising safety standards in all utilities operating nuclear power plants. The World Association of Nuclear Operators (WANO) was based on the Institution of Nuclear Power Operators in the USA. WANO provided a mechanism by which information on safety standards and practices could be exchanged directly between the organizations responsible for operating plants, thus encouraging comparison and emulation. Marshall was elected the executive chairman in 1989, and could report by 1991 that the organization included every nuclear utility in the world.<br>
<br>Privatization of electricity generation in 1989 finally ended Marshall's career in public service. He had argued for retaining a single national organization for the generation and transmission of electricity, but lost the argument. He regretted the demise of a public service company with an obligation to continuous supply in favour of energy companies whose priority would be to gain commercial contracts, but he accepted the government's decision to introduce competition into the industry and agreed to be chairman-designate of National Power, the company originally intended to run nuclear reactors as well as some other stations. However, this scheme foundered in 1989, when the government decided to withdraw nuclear stations from the planned privatization, and Marshall resigned. In a valedictory address to the British Nuclear Energy Society he described the industrial and financial difficulties which had led to the decisions to retain the nuclear stations in the public sector and to cancel the plan to build several PWRs after the Sizewell B reactor; the main reasons cited were the high capital charges and high return on investment expected in the private sector.<br>
<br>Marshall continued to work on nuclear projects in other countries after leaving the CEGB, and he also became a consultant to a syndicate insuring nuclear risks at Lloyds as well as a Lloyds name. He was chairman of WANO until 1993, and undertook a large number of visits to overseas utilities. He remained an ambassador for WANO after 1993 because of the close relations he had built with utilities in eastern European countries. He also became an adviser to the Kansai Electric Power Company of Japan.<br>
<br>Marshall dominated the nuclear power scene for two decades. He could be intimidating and very demanding, but he earned the respect of his close colleagues and of the technical community by his intellectual gifts, total commitment to his causes, and his willingness to lead from the front. He was not so successful in his dealings with politicians, who had different priorities. He collected many national and international honours, including being made a freeman of the City of London in 1984, and an honorary fellow of St Hugh's College, Oxford.<br>
<br>Marshall enjoyed a notably happy marriage with his wife, Ann, who entertained for him at their home, Bridleway House, near Goring, Oxfordshire, accompanied him on all his travels, and finally nursed him during a long terminal illness. He died of cancer at the Royal Marsden Hospital, Sutton, London, on 20 February 1996. He was survived by his wife, son, and daughter. He had become ill during the making of a television programme about his life, but he insisted on completing it and requested that the programme's producer give the address at his funeral. This took place on 1 March 1996 at St Andrew's, South Stoke, Goring, the church where Marshall and his wife had been members for many years, and the address was given again at his memorial service at St Margaret's, Westminster, London.<br>
