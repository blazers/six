<span class="headword">Warmestry,  Thomas</span>  (1609/10&#150;1665), <span class="occ">dean of Worcester</span>, was born in Worcester, the son of William Warmestry (<i>d</i>. 1640) and his wife, Cicell Smith (<i>d</i>. 1650). The Warmestry family was prominent in the town: William, as registrar of the diocese, occupied a position which members of the family had held since 1544. Thomas's elder brother was the minor poet <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28748/', "Gervase Warmestry")</script>. Thomas was educated at the King's School, Worcester, and at Oxford. He graduated BA from Brasenose College on 3 July 1628, matriculated from Christ Church, aged eighteen, the following day, and proceeded MA on 30 April 1631. In April 1635 he was instituted rector of Whitchurch, Warwickshire. In 1640 he was clerk for Worcester diocese in both of the convocations of the clergy. At the second convocation he delivered a speech against &#145;Images, Altars, Crosses, the New Canons, the Oaths&#146;, which was edited for publication by his friend Thomas Dugard in 1641. It is highly significant that a man who on his subsequent record may be called a moderate Anglican should be driven by dislike of Laudian ceremonialism to take up such a position.<br>
<br>In the crisis of 1641&#150;2 Warmestry, like many other moderates, turned increasingly to the idea of reconciliation, in both church and state, as in his <span class="italic">Pax vobis, or, A Charme for Tumultuous Spirits</span> and <span class="italic">Ramus olivae, or, An Humble Motion for Peace</span>. The former was published in London in 1641: its subtitle included &#145;an earnest and Christian advice to the people of London, to forbeare their disorderly meetings at Westminster&#146;. &#145;Though he had always been accounted a Puritan&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 3.713), Warmestry joined the king at Oxford in 1642. There the same year he published <span class="italic">Ramus olivae</span> and was created DD. In 1643 he resigned the living of Whitchurch and became rector of Minchinhampton, Gloucestershire, but, as he stated in a petition to the House of Lords in 1660, he was &#145;hindered by the warre then on foot in that County&#146;  (<span class="italic">Walker rev.</span>, 178).<br>
<br>By 1644 Warmestry was back in the royalist city of Worcester. On 17 June 1646, during a lull in the siege of the city, he challenged Richard Baxter, chaplain to one of the besieging regiments, to a disputation about the nature of a church. &#145;The result&#146;, according to the account that Warmestry gave to the Worcestershire gentleman and diarist Henry Townshend, &#145;was a confession of Mr Baxter's that he differed from me but in Terms. To which I replied that &#147;I would never quarrel with terms so they agreed in sense&#148;&#146;  (<span class="italic">Diary</span>, 1.124). Warmestry was also one of those chosen to negotiate about the surrender of the city.<br>
<br>In 1648 Warmestry published <span class="italic">Suspiria ecclesiae et reipublicae Anglicanae</span>, dedicated to Prince Charles; he describes it as &#145;An Exhortation to Humiliation&#146;. In the same year he wrote urging peace with the king (<span class="italic">The Preparative for London &hellip; An Hearty and Friendly Premonition to the City of London</span>) and a defence of the observance of Christmas. He may have been the author in 1649 of <span class="italic">A Hand-kirchife for Loyall Mourners, or, A Cordiall for Drooping Spirits, Groaning for the Bloody Murther, and Heavy Losse of our Gracious King</span>. For his failure to compound by 1650, his estate at Paxford, Worcestershire, was sold in 1653. By the latter year he seems to have acquired a church living in Shropshire (it is not clear which one). At any rate, in September 1653 Warmestry and another Shropshire conformist, Thomas Good, met Richard Baxter at Cleobury Mortimer in that county. They expressed their &#145;very good likeing&#146; of the new Worcestershire association. Baxter was delighted that &#145;some Men of great Learning and Piety that are of the Episcopal Way&#146; were in favour of the association and were prepared to promote it in Shropshire (Keeble and Nuttall, 1.109; <span class="italic">Reliquiae Baxterianae</span>, pt 2, 164&#150;6). However, Warmestry, after consulting his &#145;London Brethren&#146; (notably, Peter Gunning), changed his mind about the association, and sent Baxter a series of objections to his views (they were, in fact, written by Gunning). This does not mean that Warmestry's initial interest had been insincere: as in 1640&#150;42, his moderation and his Anglican loyalism pulled him in opposite directions.<br>
<br>In the interregnum Warmestry acted as confessor to ex-royalists and as an almoner to distressed cavaliers, living in London in the later 1650s. He waited, like other Anglicans, for the political and ecclesiastical climate to change; he regarded, for instance, the conversion of a Muslim effected by Gunning as a propitious sign to the Church of England &#145;in these evil times&#146;  (N. Matar, <span class="italic">Islam in Britain, 1558&#150;1685</span>, 1998, 145). That change came about with the Restoration of 1660. In June Warmestry became master of the Savoy; in July a prebendary of Gloucester Cathedral; and on 27 November 1661 he was installed as dean of Worcester Cathedral, where he remained until his death. As dean he had to steer the cathedral through a difficult period of recovery and refurbishment after the damage suffered in the civil wars. One difficulty concerned the installation of a new choir organ. The dean interfered with the work of the organ-builder. In a letter of 5 August 1665 to Archbishop Sheldon  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Tanner 45, fol. 19), Bishop Skinner commented on Warmestry's &#145;utter ignorance&#146; of music.<br>
<br>Having supported Bishop Morley in his opposition to Baxter in 1661, Dean Warmestry went at least twice to Kidderminster after Baxter's departure from the town and preached &#145;vehement, tedious Invectives&#146;  (<span class="italic">Reliquiae Baxterianae</span>, bk 1, pt 2, 149) from the pulpit against Baxter and his former flock &#145;to cure them of the Admiration of my Person&#146;  (ibid., bk 1, pt 2, 376). He was being forced by the polarities of the time to relinquish his former moderation. At an unknown date, Warmestry married Anne or Anna Wright (<i>d</i>. 1671), daughter of Richard Wright, clerk, but they had no children. He died at Worcester on 30 October 1665, and was buried in Worcester Cathedral two days later.<br>
