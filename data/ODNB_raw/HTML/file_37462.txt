<span class="headword">Glover,  John</span>  (1817&#150;1902), <span class="occ">chemical manufacturer</span>, was born in Newcastle upon Tyne on 2 February 1817, the son of Robert Glover, a cooper, and was brought up in humble circumstances. He was apprenticed to a plumber at thirteen and followed that trade for fourteen years, during which he acquired a taste for study and an interest in science. He studied chemistry at Newcastle Mechanics' Institute in the 1830s.<br>
<br>On 19 September 1837 Glover married Elizabeth, daughter of William Kelly, a gardener. They had three sons and one daughter. Two of the sons, William and Henry, assisted their father at the Carville works, designing towers for acid plants. In 1841 Glover went to work at the Felling chemical works, where he maintained the lead chambers of the sulphuric acid plant. Here he conceived the idea for his invention of a tower in which the oxides of nitrogen, the catalyst in the lead-chamber process, would be retained and returned to the process for reuse. In 1852 he was employed by H. L. Pattinson at the Washington chemical works, where large-scale trials of his tower were made about 1859. It was found to improve the efficiency of the process by extracting the oxides of nitrogen and facilitating the reaction before the hot gases reached the lead chambers. After eighteen months' successful operation at the Washington works, Glover set up his own chemical works at Carville, Wallsend, in 1861, with W. F. Clark and J. W. Mawson as partners. In 1868 the works became the Carville Chemical Company. He continued to develop his invention but took out no patent and freely explained its operation to visitors. Other chemical manufacturers were thus able to install the tower. Glover and his partners manufactured sulphuric acid, alkali by the Leblanc process, and bleaching powder, but competition from the Solvay process, introduced by Brunner, Mond &amp; Co. at Gateshead in 1873, led to the decline of the Leblanc process on Tyneside and the Carville works closed in 1882.<br>
<br>Glover was genial, modest, and always eager to improve himself. He read extensively in science, social economy, and religion, became involved in local charitable activities, and was especially interested in the <i>Wellesley</i> training ship for boys on the Tyne. He was a member of many local societies, including the Newcastle Literary and Philosophical Society and the Newcastle Historical Society. He was president of the Newcastle Chemical Society (1871&#150;2) and a vice-president until 1882, when it became the Newcastle section of the Society of Chemical Industry, in which he continued to take an active interest. He received the first gold medal awarded by the Society of Chemical Industry for &#145;conspicuous service to applied science&#146; at its fifteenth annual meeting in 1896. He died at his home, 20 Holly Avenue, Jesmond, Newcastle upon Tyne, on 30 April 1902.<br>
