<span class="headword">Wheler, Sir  George</span>  (1651&#150;1724), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and scholar</span>, was born at Breda in the Netherlands on 20 January 1651, the third child and eldest son of Charles Wheler, a colonel in the Life Guards, and his wife, Anne, daughter of John Hutchin of Egerton, Kent, who were royalists living in exile. The family had been originally from Tottenham High Cross, Middlesex, and had changed their name from Bradford to Wheler in order to inherit an estate. They were able to return to a house at Charing, Kent, in 1652. Wheler was educated at schools in Ashford and Wye, of which he retained an unfavourable memory. After the death of Sir William Wheler of Westminster, the family acquired his substantial property, so that a university education for George became feasible, and on 31 January 1668, aged seventeen and helped by a letter of introduction from the son of the rector, he matriculated at Lincoln College, Oxford. Within a week he caught smallpox, but although he had been a frail child, unable to indulge in sports or hunting, his health did not suffer further and in fact improved. While at Oxford he read widely, and took up an interest in heraldry, decorating his rooms with coats of arms. He was a man of many interests and practical skills. As a boy he had amused himself with woodwork, constructing a birdcage and a small harpsichord, and had taken an interest in plants; the latter he maintained in Oxford by frequent visits to the physic garden.<br>
<br>On 4 July 1671 Wheler was admitted to the Middle Temple, at least partly in order to facilitate his father's legal battle over the terms of Sir William Wheler's widow's will, but law did not appeal to him. By the summer of 1673 the lawsuit had reached a successful conclusion and Wheler, now financially secure, set out on a continental tour with George Hickes, one of his former tutors. On his travels he displayed keen curiosity and took the opportunity to collect plant specimens. While at Venice in 1675 he made the acquaintance of Jacques Spon, a doctor from Lyons, with whom he travelled in Greece in 1675&#150;6. Both travellers published an account of their adventures, Spon in 1678 and Wheler in 1682. The latter's <span class="italic">A Journey into Greece</span> is a large volume with illustrations of inscriptions, coins, plants, and buildings (one of the engravings shows the Parthenon before the fateful explosion of 1687), but much disfigured by misprints (which the author took the trouble to correct in a copy he presented to his college). A French translation appeared in 1689, with a reprint in 1723; in the preface Wheler is complimented for the fact that he had provided a much more accurate map of Greece than had previously been available.<br>
<br>On 3 September 1677 at St Martin-in-the-Fields, Westminster, Wheler married Grace (1662?&#150;1703), daughter of the diplomat <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13242/', "Sir Thomas Higgons (1623/4&#150;1691)")</script> and his second wife, Bridget Grenville. The same year he became a fellow of the Royal Society, but he devoted himself mainly to an ecclesiastical career, in which he doubtless owed much to his acquaintance with Nathaniel, Lord Crewe, who had been elected rector of Lincoln College while he was a student there and from 1674 was bishop of Durham. Wheler was knighted on 1 September 1682, was ordained about 1683 (in which year he was created MA of Oxford) and became a canon of Durham in 1684. From 1685 to 1702 he was vicar of Basingstoke, Hampshire.<br>
<br>In 1689 Wheler published a slim volume entitled <span class="italic">An Account of Churches and Places of Assembly of the Primitive Christians</span>. It is an attempt to use the evidence of Eusebius, combined with the author's own experience of archaeological sites, to reconstruct the plan of certain early churches in Tyre, Jerusalem, and Constantinople, and is illustrated with plans. The book appears to be one of the earliest studies of Christian archaeology. A sign of Wheler's continuing interest in the affairs of Greece is that in 1693 he was involved in an abortive project to endow places for Greek students at Gloucester Hall, Oxford.<br>
<br>In 1702 Wheler became DD by diploma. He subsequently enjoyed additional preferment in Durham, being appointed rector of Winston in 1706 and then of Houghton-le-Spring in 1709. At Houghton he founded a charity school for girls and enlarged the almshouse. He died in Durham on 15 January 1724 and was buried in Durham Cathedral. His will, begun on 3 May 1717 and completed, after several codicils, on 4 September 1723, reveals that he had extensive property in London, including a tenement called Skinners in the parish of St Margaret's, Westminster, &#145;where I lately lived&#146; (1717). He and his wife had had eighteen children, of whom two sons and six daughters were alive in 1723. The elder son, George, was his father's chief heir; the younger son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29194/', "Granville Wheler (1701&#150;1770)")</script>, &#145;being intended for the study of divinity&#146;, was left his books on theology and by Greek and Latin authors. Substantial and complicated charitable bequests included &pound;100 for the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel, a house for the minister of the new conformist French church at Spitalfields, and endowments for the poor of St Oswald, Houghton, for the school and almshouse there, and for Joanna, Lady Thornhill's poor school at Wye, Kent. He gave to his Oxford college more than thirty Greek manuscripts, acquired mainly in Athens and Constantinople; they included a priceless illuminated typicon, the foundation charter of a convent established in Constantinople about 1300. His plant specimens were given to the Oxford Physic Garden. Wheler occupies a significant position in the history of botany, since he introduced to Britain some plants hitherto unknown, including St John's wort.<br>
