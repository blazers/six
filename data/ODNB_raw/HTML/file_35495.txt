<span class="headword">Petrie,  William</span>  (1821&#150;1908), <span class="occ">electrical engineer</span>, was born on 21 January 1821 at Kings Langley, Hertfordshire, the eldest of four sons of William Petrie (<i>b</i>. 1784), a War Office official, and his wife, Margaret, daughter of Henry Mitton, banker, of The Chase, Enfield, Middlesex. From 1829 to 1837 the family lived at the Cape of Good Hope, where Petrie's father was deputy commissary-general. After an early education at home, Petrie and his brother Martin entered the South African College in Cape Town. He had early shown a liking for mechanics and chemistry, and his youthful studies were fostered by the friendly encouragement of their near neighbour, the astronomer Sir William Herschel.<br>
<br>In 1836 Petrie began studying for the medical profession at Cape Town Hospital, but abandoned that course when his family returned to London. He enrolled at King's College, London, taking chemistry under Professor Daniell, and also mathematics, and in 1840 went to study at Frankfurt am Main, devoting himself to magnetism and electricity. When he returned to England in 1841 he published <span class="italic"><span class="roman">&#145;Results of some experiments in electricity and magnetism&#146; in the</span> Philosophical Magazine</span>, the first of many scientific papers, and took out a patent for a magneto-electric generator.<br>
<br>From 1846 to 1853 Petrie worked assiduously on electric lighting problems in collaboration with William Edwards Staite. In the course of this work he studied the magnetic properties of varieties of steel, presenting his results to the British Association. He also considered the principle of the arc lamp, where an electric spark or &#145;arc&#146; is drawn between two pieces of carbon. The resulting heat produces light, but also burns up the carbon. A mechanism was needed to move the carbons together as they burnt, and Petrie was able to devise such a self-regulating arc lamp, supervising its manufacture at the works in Long Acre, in London, established by the mechanic Charles Holtzapffel. Under test, Petrie's lamp yielded a light of between 600 and 700 standard candle-power, with a consumption of one-third of a pound of zinc per 100 candle-power per hour. The lamp was displayed at the Hanover Square Rooms on 1 November 1848. Petrie gave a demonstration out of doors, on 28 November, with a lamp of 700 candle-power on the portico of the National Gallery, and on various nights in 1849 from the old Hungerford Bridge in London. These demonstrations were witnessed by Charles Wheatstone and other prominent scientists. On 6 February 1850 Petrie and Staite described their achievements to the Society of Arts. Unfortunately, however, their efforts to promote electric lighting brought financial disaster; indeed they could not have been successful until practical electrical generators became available in the 1870s.<br>
<br>Petrie married on 2 August 1851 Anne (1812&#150;1892), only child of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9750/', "Matthew Flinders")</script>, a naval hydrographer. She was a competent linguist and Egyptologist. Under the pseudonym &#145;Philomathes&#146; she published a work on the relation between mythology and scripture, and as &#145;X.Q.&#146; contributed essays to periodical literature. Their only child, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35496/', "(William Matthew) Flinders Petrie (1853&#150;1942)")</script>, achieved fame as an archaeologist and professor of Egyptology at University College, London.<br>
<br>In later years Petrie turned his attention to electro-chemistry, designing and equipping chemical works in France, Australia, and the United States. For many years he worked for Johnson, Matthey &amp; Co., for whom he designed and patented a platinum-iridium boiler for concentrating sulphuric acid. He died at his home, 30 Crescent Road, Bromley, Kent, on 16 March 1908, survived by a second wife, Cecilia. He was buried at Bromley.<br>
