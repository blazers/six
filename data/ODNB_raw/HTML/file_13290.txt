<span class="headword">Hill, Sir  Richard</span>, second baronet  (1733&#150;1808), <span class="occ">religious controversialist</span>, was born on 6 June 1733 at the family seat&#151;Hawkstone Park, near Shrewsbury&#151;the eldest son in the family of ten children of Sir Rowland Hill (1705&#150;1783), landowner, who had been created first baronet in 1727, and his first wife, Jane, the daughter of Sir Brian Broughton. The evangelical preacher <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13297/', "Rowland Hill (1744&#150;1833)")</script> was his younger brother, and his great-uncle was the diplomatist Richard Hill (<i>d</i>. 1727). He was educated at Shrewsbury grammar school (1743) and at Westminster School (1744&#150;8) before matriculating from Magdalen College, Oxford, on 8 December 1750. He was created MA on 2 July 1754. He went on the grand tour to Italy with Charles Bruce, fifth earl of Elgin, during 1756 and 1757, and from February to July recorded their travels in a notebook. Hill made a second trip to Italy in 1790&#150;91, this time in the company of his half-brother, the Revd Brian Hill; they travelled south to Naples and spent almost two months in Sicily.<br>
<br>Greatly troubled by an overwhelming conviction of his own sin, Hill returned to Oxford, where he experienced an evangelical conversion on Saturday 18 February 1758; he recorded that he felt a new sense of peace and assurance and took communion &#145;as never before&#146; the following day. His newly found faith strengthened by hearing the sermons of Thomas Haweis at St Mary Magdalene, he joined a small Methodist society that met regularly in Oxford. The expulsion of six students from St Edmund Hall in 1768, for having attended Methodist prayer meetings, sparked off a pamphlet war. Hill leaped to their defence with an anonymous pamphlet, <span class="italic">Pietas Oxoniensis</span> (1768), in which he scathingly denounced the college and the vice-chancellor for punishing the students for holding Calvinist beliefs that, he argued, were &#145;the ancient, undoubted, received tenets of the Church of <i>England</i>&#146;  (p. 57). Having acquired a taste for religious controversy, Hill vigorously participated in the often bitter debates in the Methodist movement between those who adhered to Arminian doctrines, led by John Wesley, and those who held Calvinist convictions, whose principal champion following George Whitefield's death was Augustus M. Toplady. Hill mainly sparred with Thomas Olivers and John William Fletcher but his <span class="italic">Review of All the Doctrines Taught by the Rev. Mr. John Wesley</span> (1772) drew a response from Wesley himself. He accused Wesley of teaching that a &#145;second justification&#146; by works was necessary for salvation, and ruthlessly listed the contradictory doctrinal statements made by Wesley. By the end of 1773 Hill sought a reconciliation with Wesley, and the two men met for the first time and shook hands after a service conducted by Thomas Pentycross.<br>
<br>In May 1780 Hill was elected to parliament as MP for Shropshire; he represented his constituency, without facing a contest, for twenty-six years. He adopted an independent and moral position on political issues; characteristically his maiden speech, on 19 May 1781, was delivered on a &#145;bill for better regulation of the Sabbath&#146;. Convinced that peace in America should be the primary concern of Lord North's ministry, he voted against the government in 1781&#150;2 and in favour of the peace preliminaries presented by Lord Shelburne in February 1783. He proved a steadfast supporter of William Pitt after he had come to power, late in 1783. His speeches were lengthy, pious, and full of misguided attempts to use humour to convey his moral and political arguments; his comparison of the coalition of North and Charles James Fox to an alliance of Herod and Pontius Pilate had the house in stitches&#151;at his expense. Despite his best efforts to bring religion into political debates his method of larding his speeches with scriptural quotations alienated rather than convinced his fellow MPs, in stark contrast to William Wilberforce, who successfully championed the evangelical cause in parliament.<br>
<br>Following his father's death, on 7 August 1783, Hill succeeded to the baronetcy and Shropshire estates, which brought him an income of over &pound;15,000. He became embroiled in controversy with the high-church Anglican apologist Charles Daubeny from 1798 to 1800, after Daubeny had attacked evangelical preaching for damaging the established church. Hill replied with three pamphlets: <span class="italic">An Apology for Brotherly Love and for the Doctrines of the Church of England</span> (1798), <span class="italic">Reformation Truth Restored</span> (1800), and <span class="italic">Daubenism Confronted and Martin Luther Vindicated</span> (1800). In 1803 the controversy continued, when George Pretyman Tomline, bishop of Lincoln, severely censured evangelical preaching in his charge; Hill warmly defended the evangelical clergy from Tomline's accusations.<br>
<br>Hill was a keen supporter of the British and Foreign Bible Society but failing health prevented him taking a more active role in its work. Soon after the dissolution of parliament in autumn 1806 ill health forced him to give up his seat, and he retired to Hawkstone. He died there on 28 November 1808, and was buried in a vault known as the Sepulchre of the Hills in the nearby parish church of Hodnet, Shropshire, where a monument was erected to his memory. He never married, and was succeeded as third baronet by his younger brother John, the father of Rowland Hill, first Viscount Hill, and of Sir Thomas Noel Hill.<br>
