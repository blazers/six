<span class="headword">Perryn, Sir  Richard</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1723, <em>d.</em> 1803), <span class="occ">judge</span>, was baptized in the parish church of Flint on 16 August 1723, the son of Benjamin Perryn (<i>d</i>. 1761), merchant, and his wife, Jane (<i>bap</i>. 1701, <i>d</i>. 1781), eldest daughter of Richard Adams, town clerk of Chester. He was educated at Ruthin grammar school and matriculated from Queen's College, Oxford, on 13 March 1741, but did not take a degree. He had been admitted to Lincoln's Inn on 6 November 1740 and migrated on 27 April 1746 to the Inner Temple, where he was called to the bar on 3 July 1747. On 30 November 1752 he married Mary (1721/2&#150;1795), daughter of Henry Browne of Skelbrooke, in the West Riding of Yorkshire; they had several children, including Richard, who became rector of Standish, Lincolnshire, and John and James, both of whom became army officers.<br>
<br>A character of Perryn published during his lifetime stated that &#145;it is well known that he was held <i>cheap</i> by the great Contemporaries with whom he practised&#146;  (Rede, 178), but in 1769 he was described by an attorney as &#145;one of the ablest Draftsmen attending the Chancery Barr&#146;  (Lemmings, 183n.) and in 1770 he was one of the busiest barristers in both the court of chancery and on the equity side of the exchequer. On 20 July 1770 he was appointed vice-chamberlain of Chester. He became a king's counsel on 28 January 1771, and also joined the bench of the Inner Temple in that year. He was made a baron of the exchequer in succession to Sir John Burland on 26 April 1776, and was knighted on the same day.<br>
<br>As a judge in criminal cases Perryn seems to have been inclined to ameliorate the law's harshness, although he could be severe when he felt normal process was evaded. When he was one of the judges at the trial of the hapless Dr William Dodd, for forgery, in February 1777 he complained of &#145;too great and an improper lenity to the prisoner at the bar in not putting him on the footing of other prisoners&#146; by permitting him to avoid transferral to Newgate prison until the day before, contrary to the rules of sessions  (<span class="italic">Old Bailey Proceedings</span>, 106). By July 1778 he was living in Twickenham, where Horace Walpole recorded that he was robbed at his own door; Walpole also said that one of Perryn's sons was imprisoned for debt in that month. In his charge to the grand jury of Sussex at the Lent assizes in 1785 he commented on Martin Madan's <span class="italic">Thoughts on Executive Justice with Respect to our Criminal Laws, Particularly on the Circuits</span> (1785), which had inveighed against the widespread practice of reprieving capital convicts from execution. Perryn was reported as saying that leaving them to hang &#145;would be making our laws like <i>Draco</i>, which, from their severity, were said to be written in blood&#146;  (Madan, 26), and made critical observations on the number of capital crimes in the statute book. He presided at the two trials of the Baptist preacher William Winterbotham for seditious words, held at Exeter in July 1793. The juries appear to have been strongly prejudiced against the defendant, and he was found guilty on both occasions, although at the second trial Perryn pointed out deficiencies in the evidence for the prosecution and stated that he was not convinced of Winterbotham's guilt. When the counsel for the defence argued in mitigation before the court of king's bench they reflected critically on Perryn's report of the trial for allegedly leaving out much of the evidence.<br>
<br>Perryn retired from the bench on 28 June 1799, and died at his home in Twickenham, Middlesex, on 2 January 1803. He was buried on 10 January in &#145;the new burial-ground&#146; in Twickenham. In private life he was said to have been &#145;very much the Gentleman, and Man of Fashion; perfectly easy in his deportment, and amiable in his manners&#146;  (Rede, 179).<br>
