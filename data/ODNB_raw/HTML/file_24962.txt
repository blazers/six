<span class="headword">Scrope,  John</span>  (<em>c.</em>1662&#150;1752), <span class="occ">judge and politician</span>, was the only son of Thomas Scrope (<i>d</i>. 1704), a merchant of Small Street, Bristol, and his wife, Mary, daughter of Thomas Hooke, also a Bristol merchant. He was the grandson of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/24952/', "Adrian Scrope")</script>, MP and regicide. Scrope's upbringing in Bristol took place against the background of radical whig activity in the city where his father was among the leaders of the &#145;exclusion&#146; campaign to debar the duke of York from succession to the throne; and Scrope himself participated in 1685 with other Bristolians in the Monmouth rebellion. In 1686, the year of his entry to the Middle Temple, he published at Utrecht a personal attack on the pro-Catholic policies of James II in the form of a tract against papal authority entitled <span class="italic">Exercitatio politica de cive in republica pontificia</span>. He appears to have continued his underground activities for a while longer, acting as an agent between the whigs and the prince of Orange, and on one journey to the Netherlands was supposed to have disguised himself as a woman. In 1693 Scrope received his call to the bar and in the course of the next decade established himself as a successful member of his profession. His wealth was augmented in 1704 on inheriting his father's estates at Wormsley, Buckinghamhire.<br>
<br>In May 1708 Scrope was appointed by the Godolphin ministry, probably on Lord Chancellor Cowper's recommendation, as one of the five barons of the newly reconstituted court of exchequer in Scotland. His duties as an exchequer baron at Edinburgh were primarily concerned with the judicial and administrative supervision of the Scottish revenue system and, largely because of his readiness to travel regularly, he soon became the chief, and most influential, instrument of liaison with the Treasury in London. The salary of &pound;500 a year was soon doubled to compensate for his having given up a lucrative barrister's practice, and was further increased in February 1710 to &pound;1500 to keep pace with the expense of journeying between London and Edinburgh. His administrative flair and a sharp nose for financial complexity made him one of the central figures in Scottish administration in the years that followed the union. It was fortunate that he had long been on terms of friendship with Robert Harley, and after coming to power in 1710 Harley treated Scrope as one of his chief Scottish advisers. Scrope acted briefly as a commissioner of the great seal during September and October 1710, and in December 1716 served as a judge at the trial of Jacobite rebels at Carlisle. He retained office at the Hanoverian accession in 1714, and in 1722 was elected to parliament for Ripon. When William Lowndes, the distinguished and long-serving secretary to the Treasury, died on 20 January 1724 Scrope was immediately appointed to succeed, and surrendered his Scottish post on 25 March. At some point, though it is not clear when, he was joint author, with his fellow baron Sir John Clerk of Penecuik, of <span class="italic">A Historical View of the Forms and Powers of the Court of Exchequer in Scotland</span>; however, this was not published until 1820.<br>
<br>Now past the age of sixty, Scrope took charge of the Treasury at Whitehall under the direction of its first lord, Robert Walpole, and was responsible for all detailed arrangements and transactions relating to the government's finances. With Walpole leading the government in the Commons, the demands on Scrope in presenting and defending the government's &#145;ways and means&#146; measures in parliament were not great, though he was noted for his mastery of factual detail. After his election for Bristol in 1727, in which he obtained a huge majority, he was prompted to give attention to matters of wider fiscal concern bearing on the city's economic interests. These included the Africa Company's attempt to monopolize the slave trade, which he helped to block, and the Bristol-led complaints about the illegal export of Irish wool, on which he chaired a major select committee in 1731. However, his espousal of Walpole's unpopular excise scheme in 1733, contrary to the corporation's instructions, cost him his Bristol seat in the election the following year, and in 1735 he was relieved of the city recordership, which he had held since 1728. He was returned instead for Lyme Regis, Dorset, which he continued to represent until his death.<br>
<br>Following Walpole's fall from power early in 1742 Scrope was summoned in June as a key witness to the committee of secrecy investigating the administration, but resolutely refused to divulge any information on Walpole's use of &#145;secret service money&#146; on the grounds that it was accounted for to the king only. Horace Walpole described him on this occasion as &#145;a most testy little old gentleman&#146;, reporting that Scrope had told the committee that:<blockquote>he was forescore years old and did not care if he spent the few months he has to live in the Tower or not; that the last thing he would do should be to betray the King and next to him the earl of Orford. (Walpole)</blockquote>A few weeks later William Pulteney, the former &#145;patriot&#146; whig leader now in office, was forced to admit the impracticality of dismissing Scrope from the Treasury as some had urged:<blockquote>Mr Scrope is the only man I know that thoroughly understands the business of the Treasury and is versed in drawing money bills. On this foundation he stands secure and is immovable as a rock; besides I really take him for an exceeding honest man. (<span class="italic">Correspondence of John, Fourth Duke of Bedford</span>)</blockquote>Thus Scrope remained in office until his death on 9 April 1752. To his nephew and heir Francis Fane, an MP and a lord commissioner of trade, he left a &#145;vast fortune&#146; comprising his &#145;mansion&#146; in Small Street, Bristol, and property in Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire. He was buried in Lewknor parish church, Oxfordshire.<br>
