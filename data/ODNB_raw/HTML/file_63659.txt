<span class="headword">Gore, Sir  Ralph</span>, fourth baronet  (<em>c.</em>1675&#150;1733), <span class="occ">speaker of the Irish House of Commons</span>, was born at Manorhamilton in co. Leitrim, the son of Sir William Gore, third baronet (<i>c</i>.1642&#150;<i>c</i>.1703), landowner, of Manor Gore, co. Donegal, and his wife, Hannah (<i>d</i>. 1733), daughter and coheir of James Hamilton of Manorhamilton. He was admitted to Trinity College, Dublin, in 1693 but did not stay long enough to take his degree. He married his first wife, Elizabeth, daughter of Sir Robert Colvill of Newtownards, co. Down, in 1705. They had two daughters, one of whom, Rose, married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17894/', "Anthony Malone (1700&#150;1776)")</script>, politician, in 1733. Having been elected to the Irish parliament for the first time in 1703 for Donegal borough, chiefly on his own family's interest but perhaps also in co-operation with William Conolly (the most important political figure in the north-west of Ireland, who controlled the nearby borough of Killybegs), Gore transferred to the county in the general election of 1713, and retained this seat in 1715.<br>
<br>After a lengthy and unspectacular parliamentary apprenticeship, distinguished only by a solidly whig voting record, Gore was appointed in 1717 to the lucrative office of chancellor of the Irish exchequer, on the recommendation of Conolly, now speaker of the Commons in Dublin. Gore's own standing among Irish whigs had not been high enough for him to share in the general redistribution of places that followed the Hanoverian succession and the downfall of the previous tory administration, and even now there were those who questioned his qualifications for such an important office. The lord chancellor of Ireland, Lord Brodrick, Conolly's main rival for the leadership of the government interest, observed that Gore relied on &#145;a certain person and party here&#146; who &#145;represent his merit and interest very much beyond the just size of either&#146;  (Midleton MS 1248/4, fols. 29&#150;30, Lord Brodrick to Thomas Brodrick, 23 May 1717). More brutally, Brodrick described Gore as Conolly's &#145;creature&#146;, one who &#145;hath a spirit low enough not to disdain being thought a dependant&#146;  (ibid., fols. 35&#150;6, 14 June 1717). Technically, Gore's lack of a legal education might have disqualified him from the post, but he was quickly admitted to the Irish bar and provided with a doctorate of laws by Trinity College. Over the next decade he proved himself a useful assistant to Conolly in parliamentary management, without making any mark as an orator. In 1719 he introduced on behalf of the speaker a bill to enable Protestant dissenters to hold some civil and military offices (a stratagem which Brodrick's faction was able to counter), and as chancellor of the exchequer he played an important role in supply legislation, taking the chair of the committees of supply and of ways and means. His involvement in the ill-fated attempt to establish a national bank in Ireland in 1720&#150;21 probably lost him money but not reputation. Nevertheless, he relinquished his county seat in the Irish general election of 1727, in favour of the episcopal pocket borough of Clogher, a see once held by <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/750/', "Bishop St George Ashe")</script>, the father of his second wife, Elizabeth Ashe (<i>d</i>. 1741). Gore and his second wife, who was heir to the St George estate in Dunmore, co. Galway, had four daughters and three sons.<br>
<br>In September 1729, when Conolly suffered the fit which destroyed his health, Gore was the first person thought of by colleagues in the court party to succeed. He was duly elected as speaker on 13 October 1729, and thus became the government's principal parliamentary &#145;undertaker&#146;, but refused Conolly's vacant place at the head of the revenue board, despite the influence it would have given him over patronage, preferring to retain the salary of &pound;800 p.a. and extensive fees of his own office. The chief commissionership went instead to his close ally, Marmaduke Coghill. Together the two men rallied Conolly's friends sufficiently to maintain a working majority for the court in the parliamentary session of 1729&#150;30, though they were unable to secure the long-term funding of the Irish national debt that the viceroy, Lord Carteret, had hoped for, since any proposal of this kind aroused the &#145;patriotic&#146; sensibilities of back-bench MPs. There were also difficulties in Gore's relationship with the Church of Ireland primate, Hugh Boulter, who assumed the responsibility of representing the &#145;English interest&#146; in Ireland, and checking the ambitions of the &#145;undertakers&#146;. During the 1729&#150;30 session Gore opposed Boulter's plan for a reform of the Irish coinage, and although the two men were both appointed as lords justices to govern Ireland after Carteret's departure, they were at odds again over the appointment of a new chief baron of the Irish exchequer, Gore recommending an Irish, and Boulter an English, candidate. During preparations for the next parliamentary session differences arose between Gore and Boulter on the issue of the supply, but these evaporated with the arrival of a new lord lieutenant, the duke of Dorset. Gore was an effective commons manager for Dorset in 1731&#150;2, though again potentially controversial issues had to be side-stepped, the long-term funding of the debt and (even more dangerous) a proposed repeal of the sacramental test, which Sir Robert Walpole endorsed but which Gore argued strongly and successfully against.<br>
<br>After having been reappointed with Boulter as a lord justice in the spring of 1732, Gore died, after a short illness, on 23 February 1733 and was buried at Christ Church in Dublin. His second son, Ralph (1725&#150;1802), who succeeded his brother Sir St George Gore as sixth baronet, enjoyed a successful army career and was raised to the Irish peerage as earl of Ross in 1772.<br>
