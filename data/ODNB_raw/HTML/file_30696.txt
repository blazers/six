<span class="headword">Bellew,  Harold Kyrle</span>  (1855&#150;1911), <span class="occ">actor</span>, the youngest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2053/', "John Chippendall Montesquieu Bellew (1823&#150;1874)")</script>, popular preacher and public reader, and his first wife, Eva Money, was born at Prescot, Lancashire, on 28 March 1855. He was educated at the Royal Grammar School, Lancaster, and, though originally intended for the army, he drifted into the navy, and for some time served on the training ship <i>Conway</i>. He left this for the merchant service, in which he remained intermittently for several years. He then spent four years in Australia, and on 26 October 1873 he married Eug&eacute;nie Legrand (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1854) in St Patrick's Cathedral, Melbourne. The following year he made his first appearance as an actor, at Solferino, New South Wales, playing Eglinton Roseleaf in T. J. Williams's farce <span class="italic">Turn Him Out</span>.<br>
<br>Bellew returned to England in August 1875, and almost immediately secured an engagement with Helen Barry. His English d&eacute;but was at the Theatre Royal, Brighton, on 30 August, as Lord Woodstock in Tom Taylor's <span class="italic">Lady Clancarty</span>, when he performed as Harold Kyrle, the name by which he was known until the end of 1878. After moving to London he made his first appearance in the capital at the Park Theatre, Camden Town, in October 1875, as Roseleaf in <span class="italic">Turn Him Out</span>, and was next engaged at the Haymarket Theatre, where he was seen in January 1876 as Paris in <span class="italic">Romeo and Juliet</span>, with Adelaide Neilson. He made his first notable success there in February 1877, when he played Belvawney in W. S. Gilbert's comedy <span class="italic">Engaged</span>. The following year he supported Adelaide Neilson as leading man in <span class="italic">Measure for Measure</span>, <span class="italic">Twelfth Night</span>, and other plays.<br>
<br>In December 1878 Bellew was engaged by Henry Irving for the opening of his Lyceum management, and in September 1879 he joined Marie Litton's company at the Imperial Theatre. In the next few years he achieved his greatest success in comedies, notably playing Jack Absolute in <span class="italic">The Rivals</span> and Charles Surface in <span class="italic">The School for Scandal</span>; his Orlando in <span class="italic">As You Like It</span> was widely regarded as one of his best efforts. He also toured the provinces with his own company before leaving for New York in 1885. His first appearance there was at Wallack's Theatre, as Hubert in <span class="italic">In his Power</span>, and he remained in America for the next two years, performing chiefly in old comedy parts.<br>
<br>After his return to London in 1887 Bellew began a long artistic association with Cora Urquhart Brown-Potter at the Gaiety Theatre. That autumn they formed a company, which toured for ten years through England, Australia, America, South Africa, and the Far East; their repertory included such plays as <span class="italic">Antony and Cleopatra</span>, <span class="italic">Romeo and Juliet</span>, <span class="italic">Camille</span>, <span class="italic">She Stoops to Conquer</span>, <span class="italic">As You Like It</span>, <span class="italic">La Tosca</span>, and <span class="italic">David Garrick</span>. Brief appearances in London during this period were made, among others, in three plays of his own composition: <span class="italic">Hero and Leander</span>, at the Shaftesbury (June 1902), <span class="italic">Francillon</span>, at the Duke of York's (September 1897), and <span class="italic">Charlotte Corday</span>.<br>
<br>At the termination of his partnership with Mrs Brown-Potter, Bellew performed at the Criterion (November 1898) with Charles Wyndham, in <span class="italic">The Jest</span> by Murray Carson and Louis N. Parker, but soon rejoined Irving at the Lyceum (April 1899), where he appeared as Olivier in Sardou's <span class="italic">Robespierre</span>. Later in the year he returned to Australia, and interested himself in mining ventures, which proved profitable. From January 1902, when he was once more at Wallack's Theatre, New York, until his death he was associated entirely with the American stage. His new parts, which were few, included Raffles, in the play of that name (1903), and Richard Voysin in <span class="italic">The Thief</span> (1907).<br>
<br>Bellew was an actor of ease and distinction, with a beautiful voice, handsome, clear-cut features, and a courtly bearing. He died of pneumonia while on tour at Salt Lake City, Utah, on 2 November 1911, and was buried in a cemetery on the Boston Post Road, New York.<br>
