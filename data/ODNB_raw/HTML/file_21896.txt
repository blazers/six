<span class="headword">Penton,  Stephen</span>  (1639&#150;1706), <span class="occ">college head</span>, the son of Stephen Penton, was born at Winchester on 30 March 1639 and baptized at St John's Church there on 9 April 1639. He was admitted as a scholar of Winchester College in 1653, matriculated from New College, Oxford, on 28 June 1659 and became a probationary fellow in the same year. From 1661 to 1672 he was a full fellow of the college. He graduated BA on 5 May 1663 and proceeded MA on 17 January 1667. From 1670 to 1676 he held the rectory of Tingewick in Buckinghamshire through the gift of his college. From at least 1671 he served as chaplain to Robert Bruce, earl of Ailesbury and Elgin, and as tutor to his son Thomas. On 15 February 1676 he was appointed principal of St Edmund Hall, Oxford, by the provost and fellows of Queen's College on the condition that he resign his living at Tingewick, to which his college, as part of this arrangement, later appointed a fellow of Queen's, Lancelot Bland.<br>
<br>Andrew Allum, Penton's vice-principal, considered him a less capable administrator than his predecessor, Thomas Tully. Certainly admissions declined during Penton's principalship from eleven in 1680 down to four in 1683. One reason for this downward trend, according to Allum, was Penton's marked preference for an &#145;inconsiderable set of gentlemen commoners, now his darling creatures&#146;  (Kelly, 46). As part of Penton's scheme to make the hall more attractive to the sons of the gentry he was responsible for building the college chapel and its adjoining library on a strip of land he obtained through his connections at New College. Money was raised out of Penton's own pocket and from the sale of plate given to the college by his predecessor. The chapel, built in the same Palladian style as neighbouring Queen's, was consecrated by John Fell, bishop of Oxford, on 7 April 1682. It was also a desire to attract more students from the gentry to Oxford that lay behind Penton's most famous literary work, <span class="italic">The Guardian's Instruction</span> (1688), which tried to demonstrate the value of an education at the university, particularly for those younger sons who would not inherit their father's estates. The aims of this work were expanded in Penton's <span class="italic">New Instructions to the Guardian</span> (1694), which covered the education of the sons of the gentry from the age of three to twenty-one and urged that the professions of law, medicine, and divinity were not beneath gentlemen. Aside from these works Penton also published, in 1682, a treatise asserting the lawfulness of bowing or kneeling at the altar.<br>
<br>The efforts to attract the gentry to St Edmund Hall were limited in their success. Penton resigned the principalship for reasons of health (he appears to have suffered from jaundice) on 7 March 1684 and on leaving made a present of twelve silver-handled knives and forks to the college. In 1684 he was nominated to the living of Glympton, Oxfordshire, by Frances Wheate, widow of Thomas Wheate, a position he held until 1693. Over the same period he was also lecturer in the neighbouring church at Churchill. On the nomination of his old pupil Thomas Bruce, now Lord Ailesbury, he was instituted on 27 September 1693 to the rectory of Wath by Ripon, in the North Riding of Yorkshire, and was collated on 28 May 1701 to the third prebendal stall at Ripon, holding both preferments until his death. He seems to have lived mainly in the north from 1693 onwards, though he still used his influence to get Robert Wood, the son of Thomas Wood, a fellowship at All Souls in 1694. A sermon given at Oxford in September 1705, praising the duke of Marlborough, is often attributed to Penton, as he had been a fellow of New College, but it was actually preached by his nephew Henry. Penton died a bachelor on 17 October 1706 at Wath by Ripon and was buried on 20 October in the chancel of Wath church, where an epitaph that he wrote himself was inscribed on a brass plate. This quaint inscription (it opened: &#145;Here lies what's left of Stephen Penton, Rector, who being dead, / Yet speaketh once for all: My beloved Parishioners. / Since any one of you may be the next, / Let every one prepare to do so&#146;) aroused some criticism from contemporaries  (Whitaker, 187). He left most of his estate to the poor of the parish, having already given most of his books to the Bodleian and St Edmund Hall libraries.<br>
