<span class="headword">Dawks,  Thomas</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1611, <em>d.</em> 1670), <span class="occ">printer</span>, was baptized on 16 June 1611 in Stratford upon Avon, the son of Richard Dawks (<i>d</i>. 1626/7), plumber, of Stratford upon Avon; his mother's names are unknown. He was bound on 16 June 1627 to Felix Kingston, printer, of London, and became a freeman of the Stationers' Company on 5 October 1635. In 1649, in his son's school register, he is described as printer, but where he was employed then and later is not known. His grandson Ichabod noted in his diary that his &#145;Dear Grand Father&#146; died on 11 May 1670 at Low Leyton, Essex, where he owned two houses and land  (Morison). Morison confuses Thomas senior with the Puritan divine Thomas Dawks (<i>b</i>. 1620, BA Oxford, 1641). Dawks married Frances (<i>d</i>. 1667) and their son <a name="cosubject_7341"></a><span class="headword">Thomas Dawks</span>  (1636&#150;1689), <span class="occ">printer</span>, was born at Kelmscott, Oxfordshire, on 8 October 1636. He was admitted on 2 April 1649 to Merchant Taylors' School, London. In 1651 he &#145;began to Work at Printing at Mr Du Gards&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 42101). William Dugard, headmaster of Merchant Taylors' School, was also printer to the council of state. Thomas was freed by patrimony on 6 August 1655. In 1660 he unsuccessfully petitioned to become overseer of the press responsible for suppressing seditious printing.<br>
<br>On 16 February 1661 Dawks married Anne Brooker (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1638/9), and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7339/', "Ichabod Dawks")</script>, first of eleven children, was baptized on 22 September 1661. Their daughter Dorothy married the London printer William Bowyer the elder. The family left London during the plague of 1665, and after the 1666 fire retreated temporarily to Low Leyton. On 2 April 1666 Thomas moved to Thomas Roycroft's, Bartholomew Close (too late to work on the polyglot <span class="roman">Bible</span>, despite contrary assertions). In 1672&#150;3 he worked successively for John Darby, Anne Maxwell, and Elizabeth Flesher, before setting up for himself in Blackfriars in 1674. He had four apprentices, sons Ichabod and Thomas, and two others bound in 1683.<br>
<br>Thomas the younger had shares in and printed a number of popular medical works, including William Salmon's <span class="italic">Pharmacopeia Londinensis</span> (3rd edn, 1685). In 1676, having printed in Welsh <span class="italic">The Practice of Piety</span> (1675), he was appointed king's printer for the British language. In 1679 he projected a short history of printing. Dawks died in August 1689, leaving his printing business to his wife and son Ichabod, and was buried at Low Leyton, where he had died. His wife married one William Ryland on 8 July 1693 in London.<br>
