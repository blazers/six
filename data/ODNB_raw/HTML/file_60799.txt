<span class="headword">Simson,  Frances Helen</span>  (1854&#150;1938), <span class="occ">promoter of women's higher education and suffragist</span>, was born at 13 Bruntsfield Place, Edinburgh, on 2 April 1854, the daughter of William Simson (1811&#150;1858), secretary of the Bank of Scotland, and his wife, Jane Christiana Aberdein (<i>b</i>. 1820). She was the seventh of nine children, seven girls and two boys. While she was an infant, the family moved to 9 Eton Terrace, a smart address in an area then being developed to the south-west of the New Town, where she would spend much of her life.<br>
<br>Frances Simson was one of the first eight women to graduate from the University of Edinburgh in 1893 (all MA), following the <span class="roman">Universities (Scotland) Act</span>, 1889, which made that possible. At thirty-eight she was the oldest of the group and had studied for her degree at the classes run by the Edinburgh Association for the University Education of Women (EAUEW; formerly the Edinburgh Ladies' Educational Association, ELEA, founded in 1867), in which she enrolled in 1877. Women were first admitted to lectures, examination, and graduation at Edinburgh in 1892, when seventy matriculated, but from 1868 the ELEA held lectures, conducted and examined by university staff, leading to certificates in literature, philosophy, and science; it was the first to do so in Scotland. A year before graduating she began a collaboration with Elizabeth Sanderson Haldane, translating and editing Hegel's <span class="italic">Lectures on the History of Philosophy</span> (1892&#150;6), first published in German in 1833&#150;6. It remains the standard English translation.<br>
<br>Simson belonged to the management committee of St George's Teacher Training College in Edinburgh and was later a member of the council of St George's School for Girls, both set up by the EAUEW. Once it had succeeded in its aim of entry for women to the Scottish universities, the EAUEW turned its attentions to the women students' well-being, seeing a need for a library, a place of meeting for rest or study, and residential accommodation. She was a member of the sub-committee, set up by Margaret Houldsworth and Louisa Stevenson, to raise subscriptions for the university's first hall of residence for women. When Masson Hall opened in autumn 1897, Frances Simson was deemed to be &#145;a superintendent of the right sort&#146;  (Mrs J. Balfour to Louisa Stevenson, EAUW MSS) and became its first warden, a salaried post which she held for twenty-one years. Working at a large desk in a corner of the library, she gained the respect and affection of many students. She later said that when she was offered the post she &#145;had never even managed a private house&#146;. Nevertheless she modelled the hall on the home in which she had been brought up, giving the hall &#145;a peculiar and individual charm&#146;  (H. S. Taylor, <span class="italic">Masson Association News Letter</span>, 1938, 27). The association donated valuable furniture and books to the hall.<br>
<br>Masson Hall remained the centre of the EAUEW's continuing activities and became a focus of women's suffrage activity. It offered a communal life to all women students, many of whom lived at home or more cheaply in lodgings. Isolation, shyness, and inarticulacy were seen as particular problems for Scottish women students. In a climate that was not uniformly welcoming to women&#151;they met with amused toleration and scepticism as to their ability&#151;a supportive centre for women students was needed. It was intended that the hall would develop as a women's college on the model of Girton College, Cambridge. Although its collegiate ambitions were not realized, the hall had a strong collective culture and old girls&#151;Massonians&#151;kept in touch through the Masson Association, of which Frances Simson was president after her retirement as warden in 1918.<br>
<br>Simson played a leading role in the attempt by five women graduates to vote for the university MP at the general election of 1906; the others were Margaret Nairn (also one of the first eight graduates), Dr Elsie Inglis, Chrystal Macmillan, and Frances Melville. The universities of Edinburgh and St Andrews together elected an MP and Glasgow and Aberdeen universities a second MP; the 1906 election was the first time that the joint Edinburgh and St Andrews seat had been contested since women had been permitted to graduate. The women argued that their membership of the general council of each university entitled them to vote, and that the university franchise was unique in both qualification and constituency since it was &#145;a franchise of education, of intellect&#146;  (<span class="italic">Glasgow Herald</span>, 11 Nov 1908). When the registrar refused to issue them with voting papers, they took the case to the Court of Session in June 1906. Their action failed when &#145;person&#146; in the relevant legislation was interpreted to mean &#145;male person&#146; rather than &#145;human&#146; as the women argued; the denial of the vote to women, Lord Salveson declared, was on the ground of decorum and did not underrate their worth or intellect. The appeal in November 1907 was also lost but the women graduates then took their case to the House of Lords, in November 1908, raising &pound;1000 to do so. Simson, Melville, and Macmillan attended, with Macmillan opening and acting as senior counsel. Simson spoke on the second day of the hearing, 12 November, making a more general argument and closing the case. The <span class="italic">Glasgow Herald</span> next day described hers as &#145;a well ordered argument upon the broad grounds&#146;; her main points were that women graduates exercised all privileges as members of the general council except the parliamentary franchise; that women's exclusion from the suffrage generally was by custom rather than a constitutional principle and that society and elections had changed considerably from when that custom had been established; and that male graduates were qualified to vote not as men but as graduates and that women now had identical qualifications. The appeal was dismissed, with costs against the appellants, but generated useful press coverage and sympathetic support.<br>
<br>That women could argue their case so well at the highest court of the land, in the Palace of Westminster where they were otherwise not admitted other than as visitors behind the grille, was in itself a powerful statement. Against expectations there was no accompanying demonstration and the serious and constitutional manner in which they sought the suffrage was emphasized. Although the imposing &#145;modern Portia&#146;, Macmillan, gained more media attention and Simson, dressed plainly in black, was somewhat in her shadow, she was judged &#145;sufficiently clear and impressive in her manner&#146;  (<span class="italic">Glasgow Herald</span>, 13 Nov 1908). Elizabeth Haldane wrote to her on 16 November 1908: &#145;Whatever the result this will do great things for the cause and makes me proud of my sex&#146;  (NL Scot., Haldane MSS). The case led to the formation of women's suffrage societies in the four Scottish universities and Simson became president of the Scottish University Women's Suffrage Union. She was also vice-president of the Edinburgh National Society for Women's Suffrage (NSWS) and active in the Scottish federation of the National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies; after 1918 she was president of the Edinburgh Equal Citizenship Society, the successor to the Edinburgh NSWS.<br>
<br>When Edinburgh University marked its 350th anniversary, in October 1933, Simson received the honorary degree of LLD, as the only woman graduand, for her role in the cause of the university education of women. The citation described her as &#145;a survivor of the plucky band of eight ladies&#146; who were first to graduate and referred to the &#145;useful and decorous&#146; part she played in &#145;the general struggle for the rights of her sex&#146;  (<span class="italic">University of Edinburgh Journal</span>, 6/2, Jan 1934, 163&#150;4). She saw herself as honoured on behalf of the many women who had worked for women's education&#151;&#145;they knew what they wanted and were determined to get it, and not to accept anything inferior&#146;&#151;and one of those who had been first to reap the fruits of those efforts  (<span class="italic">The Scotsman</span>, 2 Nov 1933). In retirement she spent her summers in highland Perthshire, usually with her sisters and members of their families, and was often visited by former Masson Hall residents. Contemporaries described her as avoiding the limelight but as working quietly and steadily for her ideals  (<span class="italic">Masson Association News Letter</span>, 1938, 27). She died at her home, 9 Eton Terrace, Edinburgh, on 4 September 1938.<br>
