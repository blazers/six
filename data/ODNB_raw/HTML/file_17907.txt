<span class="headword">Maltravers <span class="st"> [Mautravers]</span>,  John</span>, first Lord Maltravers  (<em>c.</em>1290&#150;1364), <span class="occ">baron</span>, was the son of <a name="cosubject_17906"></a><span class="headword">Sir John Maltravers</span>  (1266&#150;1341)<span class="occ"></span> of Lytchett Matravers, Dorset, and Alinore, his first wife. Maltravers the elder spent much time in Ireland as a young adult. He was knighted with the prince of Wales in 1306, was a conservator of the peace in Dorset in 1307, 1308, 1314, and 1329, and took part in the Dunstable tournament of 1308. He served the king in Scotland and Gascony, but does not ever seem to have been summoned to parliament. In 1325, however, he joined the anti-Despenser movement. In July that year he was accused of burglary and theft at the royal manor of Kingsbury in Somerset, and in October he caused a riot at a fair in Dorset. In 1326 his manors were confiscated on the grounds that he was a &#145;rebel&#146;. Besides his son, he also had a daughter called Matilda, who married, by 1313, John Lenham the younger. His second wife was Joan (<i>d</i>. 1348/9), daughter of Sir Walter Foliot, with whom he had three daughters: Alice, Joan, and Elizabeth. After his death, which occurred in 1341, she married Alexander Venables.<br>
<br>John Maltravers the younger, who was also knighted in 1306, probably fought at Bannockburn, and in 1319 he was returned as a knight of the shire for Dorset. In 1320 he accompanied Maurice Berkeley to Gascony on royal service. In the same year he was associated with Thomas Gournay in a case of false arrest, the beginning of a disastrous acquaintanceship. In 1321 Maltravers was pardoned for opposition to the Despensers, but, having sided with Thomas of Lancaster at the battle of Boroughbridge, his estates were confiscated. Throughout 1322 he was involved in attacks on the king's supporters, including one with Roger Mortimer on Despenser holdings in Newport. He probably then fled abroad, but by summer 1326 had joined Mortimer and Isabella to overthrow Edward II. In March 1327 he was granted some Despenser holdings&#151;the manor of Winterborne Houghton and land in Sutton Maudite &#145;for service to Queen Isabella and the king abroad and at home&#146;  (<span class="italic">CPR</span>, <i>1327&#150;30</i>, 5.9).<br>
<br>From the end of 1328 Maltravers became a key member of Mortimer's inner circle, and was heavily implicated in the murder of Edward II. In April 1327 he and Thomas Berkeley, his brother-in-law and a relative of Mortimer, were in attendance on the deposed king at Berkeley Castle, for which accounts still survive. Maltravers is accused by the chroniclers Murimuth and Baker both of treating the deposed king harshly and of ordering his murder on the night of 21 September. At the parliament that followed the coup of 1330 against Mortimer, Berkeley, who was absent on the night, gave a sworn statement that Edward had been murdered by William Ocle and Gournay, but the Bridlington chronicler, the St Paul's chronicler, and Adam Murimuth all write that Maltravers, too, had been responsible.<br>
<br>During the minority of Edward III Maltravers frequently served on commissions of oyer and terminer, and was made keeper of the forest south of the Trent on 5 April 1329. He opposed Henry of Lancaster's rebellion in 1328&#150;9 and then was commissioned to try the rebels, and in 1329 he became a household banneret, accompanying Edward III on his journey to do homage in France that year. By May 1330, still acting for Roger Mortimer, he was steward of the household, and received the forfeited manors of John Giffard of Brimsfield. During 1330 he twice received individual summonses to parliament, being consequently regarded as having become Lord Maltravers. In October 1330 he was made keeper of Clarendon Park. As keeper of Corfe Castle, a post he had occupied since at least September 1329, Maltravers was involved in the conspiracy to convince the earl of Kent early in 1330 that Edward II was still alive, thus leading to the earl's execution for treason. Although the Bridlington chronicler says that Maltravers was arrested in the coup that overthrew Mortimer at Nottingham on 19 October 1330, in fact he was not there. Instead he was indicted in his absence for plotting the murder of Kent, and a reward was placed on his head of 1000 marks. His confiscated lands went to Kent's widow and to William Montagu. In December 1330, along with Ocle, Gournay, and others, he tried to flee the realm, while in July 1331 men from Mousehole, Cornwall, were charged with having helped them to escape to the continent. Murimuth and Walsingham claim he spent many years in Germany, though other evidence suggests he may have been in the Low Countries.<br>
<br>In February 1331 Queen Philippa obtained an income for Maltravers's wife, Agnes (<i>d</i>. 1375), from the dowers of John Nerford (<i>d</i>. 1329) and John Argentine (<i>d</i>. 1318), her former husbands, in order to maintain her family, now destitute following the confiscation of Maltravers's lands. In August 1332 Agnes went abroad, ostensibly on pilgrimage, though this may have been a cover for a visit to her husband. In March 1334 William Montagu was appointed to get in touch with Maltravers, who was said to be &#145;desirous to reveal to him many things concerning his honour and the estate and well-being of the realm&#146;  (<span class="italic">CPR</span>, <i>1330&#150;34</i>, 59). Other unofficial contacts appear to have been taking place around this time, as pardons were issued in 1335 to Montagu, Edmund Bereford (Maltravers's brother-in-law), Maurice Berkeley, John Moleyns, and Nicholas Beche for receiving Maltravers on the continent. As a result in 1339 Maltravers was granted a life annuity of &pound;100. A further thawing of relations occurred in 1342 when Agnes was permitted to stay with Maltravers abroad for as long as she wished. Edward III's apparently incongruous attitude towards a condemned traitor is one of the factors regarded as giving weight to fourteenth-century rumours and present-day theories, that Edward II, far from being murdered in 1327, may have survived and fled to the continent in 1330. However, Maltravers's own part in the events surrounding the deposed king's supposed flight is less than clear. According to the letter from Manuel Fieschi to Edward III, composed between 1336 and 1343, the latter's father made his way from Berkeley to Corfe Castle, of which Maltravers was keeper. But although he then stayed at Corfe for eighteen months, he did so without Maltravers's knowledge. Hence it was by pure chance that Maltravers was correct in assuring the earl of Kent that Edward II was still alive, although he was on safer ground in claiming to be innocent of Edward's murder. Maltravers's extended exile from England, from 1330 to 1351, would thus have been intended to prevent the truth about the late king's survival coming to light, and thereby presenting a threat to the position of Edward III.<br>
<br>In 1345 Maltravers was refused permission to return to stand trial for the murder of Edward II, but he was active in Calais during the late 1340s, and appears to have become a self-appointed royal agent in an attempt to win the king's favour. In 1347 he was given permission to return to England to attempt to clear his name, following a meeting with the king at the mouth of the Swyn, which also resulted in his being granted an inn and house in Calais, along with the title of &#145;Regarder of the land of La Lewe&#146; in France. His restoration to royal favour continued over the next five years. In June 1348 he was sent in a delegation to Ghent, Bruges, and Ypres to negotiate on the king's behalf, and was appointed keeper of the Channel Islands, founding a hospital at Bowes in St Peter Port, Guernsey. Finally, on 20 June 1351, all his confiscated lands and his former position were restored in consideration of his faithfulness &#145;and of the great place which he afterwards held for [the king] in Flanders and elsewhere with great loss to himself and in spite of large offers from the king's adversaries to draw him from his allegiance&#146;  (<span class="italic">CPR</span>, <i>1330&#150;34</i>, 110), and he was summoned to parliament in November. His restoration was confirmed by parliament in February 1352. In the final years of his life he settled in England.<br>
<br>Maltravers married twice. With his first wife Ela (also recorded as Milicent), sister of Thomas Berkeley, he had a son, John, who died in 1350. Ela had died before about 1329, and it was probably at about that time that Maltravers married again; his new wife was Agnes, daughter of Sir William Bereford. He died on 16 February 1364 and was buried at Lytchett Matravers. A grandson, Henry, had also predeceased him, and his heirs were his two granddaughters, Joan, wife of Sir John Kaynis, and Eleanor, wife of Sir John Arundel, a son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9534/', "Richard (II) Fitzalan, earl of Arundel")</script>.<br>
