<span class="headword">Prys,  Edmwnd</span>  (1542/3&#150;1623), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and Welsh poet</span>, was the son of Si&ocirc;n ap Rhys ap Gruffudd ap Rhys and Si&acirc;n, daughter of Owain ap Llywelyn ab Ieuan. Long thought to have been a native of Merioneth, he is now known to have hailed from Llanrwst, Denbighshire: both his father and grandfather feature among Llanrwst taxpayers in a 1543&#150;4 subsidy roll, and genealogies place his mother's family also in the locality. His Llanrwst kinsmen included the humanist William Salesbury, a possible early influence. It is not certain where Prys received his early education, but an association with the Wynn family of Gwydir, Llanrwst, seems likely. Sir John Wynn of Gwydir claimed that William Morgan, translator of the <span class="roman">Bible</span> into Welsh, received his early education at Gwydir, where there is evidence that the family employed a tutor. In 1565 both Prys and Morgan enrolled in St John's College, Cambridge; significantly perhaps, John Gwynn, Sir John Wynn's uncle, had served as fellow there from 1548 to 1555.<br>
<br>Prys graduated BA from St John's in 1568, and MA in 1571. Elected fellow there in 1570, he was later elected college preacher (1574) and chaplain (1575); in 1575&#150;6 he served as university preacher. His prominence in university circles led to his inclusion in the &#145;Cockolds Kallender&#146;, a scurrilous Cambridge satire by Stephen Valenger. Prys's long stay at St John's familiarized him with humanist culture and provided him with a formidable linguistic armoury. He claimed to know eight languages: these would have included the three classical languages in addition to his native Welsh and acquired English, and probably also some of the modern continental vernaculars. His friend William Morgan is credited with a knowledge of French; it may be significant that the Frenchman Antoine Chevallier, said to have been Princess Elizabeth's French tutor, was Hebrew lecturer at St John's during the two Welshmen's time there.<br>
<br>Prys was ordained deacon in 1567 and priest in 1568 and was licensed to preach by John Whitgift in 1570. Having served a curacy at Harlton near Cambridge from 1568, he obtained his first living&#151;the rectory of Ffestiniog and Maentwrog in Merioneth&#151;in 1573, being at first an absentee incumbent. Appointed both rector of Ludlow and archdeacon of Merioneth in 1576, he probably still resided to some extent at Cambridge until 1577. He relinquished Ludlow in 1579, settling in Merioneth, at Tyddyn Du, Maentwrog (his popular association with Gerddi Bluog in nearby Llanfair is spurious). He served as archdeacon of Merioneth and rector of Ffestiniog and Maentwrog for the remainder of his life, serving also from 1580 as rector of Llanenddwyn and Llanddwywe. By virtue of his office as archdeacon he held the sinecure rectory of Llandudno. He also served as a canon and prebend at Bangor Cathedral, and in 1602 was appointed a canon at St Asaph's Cathedral by Bishop William Morgan, another indication of their close association.<br>
<br>Prys combined his clerical duties with the life of a country gentleman&#151;he acquired land in Ffestiniog and Maentwrog&#151;and he served as a justice of the peace for some thirty years. Charges of illegal acquisition of land, cattle stealing, assault, bribery, and perjury were brought against him in the court of Star Chamber (1594, 1607), but their outcome is unknown. It is credible, however, that Prys&#151;a man of very large physical stature who sometimes displayed an arrogant disposition in his poetry&#151;could have been capable of overbearing and aggressive behaviour. Prys married twice. His first wife, Elin, daughter of Si&ocirc;n (John) ap Lewis of Pengwern, Ffestiniog, bore him three children, John, Robert, and Jane. His second wife, whom he had married by 1588, was Elin's cousin Gwen, daughter of Morgan ap Lewis and widow of Rhys ap Robert of Llanfair Talhaearn. She bore him three sons, Ffowc, Morgan, and Edmwnd. Like their father, both John and Ffowc Prys wrote poetry.<br>
<br>Prys, the finest Welsh amateur poet of his day, produced a considerable body of strict-metre poetry (i.e. featuring <i>cynghanedd</i>). Much of it consisted of debates with other poets, Si&ocirc;n Phylip, Huw Machno, Thomas Prys, and Wiliam Cynwal. Of these, the debate with Cynwal, extending to some fifty-four poems (1581&#150;7), was easily the most significant. In this exchange Prys voiced a humanist critique of professional bards such as Cynwal, drawing on a wide range of reference derived from both classical and Welsh learning. Prys pursued a dual line of attack. First, he criticized Cynwal and his ilk for the mendacity of their eulogies&#151;the staple product of professional bardism&#151;echoing the criticism of the fifteenth-century poet Si&ocirc;n Cent. In Prys's view this mendacity was compounded by an attachment to discredited medieval lore, exemplified by Cynwal's references to Mandeville's travels and the story of Merlin. Second, he attacked Cynwal for his poetry's lack of substance, a fault Prys attributed to a lack of learning. Dismissing Cynwal's bardic degrees and training, he urged the bards to resort to the universities, asserting that a poet should be both a philosopher and a linguist. As alternatives to eulogy Prys championed both divine poetry based on the <span class="roman">Bible</span> and scientific poetry, genres popular in contemporary humanist circles; a passage advocating scientific poetry suggests that he knew the then much admired <span class="italic">La Sepmaine</span> (1578) of Guillaume Du Bartas.<br>
<br>Prys's other poetry included elegies to his friends Richard Vaughan, bishop of London (a contemporary at St John's), and the poet Si&ocirc;n Phylip, religious and moral poems such as &#145;An Ode on our Redemption&#146; and &#145;A Carol on Conscience&#146;, an allegorical poem of social criticism, &#145;The Misgovernment of the Mighty&#146;, and a satire on football. His poem employing the English song-metre &#145;About the Bank of Helicon&#146; anticipated the seventeenth-century vogue of deploying <i>cynghanedd</i> in metres other than the canonical ones of classical bardism. Prys wrote in Latin as well as Welsh. Latin quatrains by him occur in manuscripts, and a Latin hexameter poem he composed in praise of the author was prefaced to Dr John Davies's grammar, <span class="italic">Antiquae linguae Britannicae &hellip; rudimenta</span> (1621).<br>
<br>In a prefatory epistle to his 1588 <span class="roman">Bible</span> William Morgan cited Prys, with Dr David Powell and Richard Vaughan, as ones who had given him aid which was &#145;not to be discounted&#146;. The extent of this contribution is unknown, but modern scholars doubt if it amounted to actual translation. Interestingly, Prys, in an elegy to Cynwal which concluded their debate, claimed that he chose him as an adversary in order to become acquainted with bardic linguistic usage and thus facilitate the provision of scripture in Welsh. Morgan may have sought his advice concerning the classical literary language of the bards, the medium adopted for the translation.<br>
<br>Prys's masterpiece, his Welsh metrical psalms, was composed in old age. The London stationer Thomas Salisbury referred as early as 1610 to Prys's promise to produce them, but they did not appear until 1621 when they were published as a supplement to an edition of the Welsh <span class="roman">Book of Common Prayer</span>. In a preface Prys justified his decision to compose the work in free metre, citing the danger of distorting scripture had he used the restrictive medium of <i>cynghanedd</i>. Although Prys knew Hebrew, modern scholarship has demonstrated&#151;contrary to earlier claims&#151;that he was more indebted to the earlier Welsh translations of the psalms by William Salesbury and William Morgan than to the Hebrew originals. This does not diminish his achievement, however, for his work is noteworthy for its felicitous phrasing and copious Welsh and for its versatility in conveying the psalms' wide range of emotions. Prys's psalms were the staple of Welsh congregational praise until a more subjective hymnody evolved in the wake of the eighteenth-century evangelical revival. Over 100 editions of them have been published; some have continued to feature in Welsh hymn collections in the early twenty-first century.<br>
<br>Prys died aged eighty in September 1623 and was probably buried in Maentwrog parish church. His wife survived him, Ffowc Prys inheriting Tyddyn Du.<br>
