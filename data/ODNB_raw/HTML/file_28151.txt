<span class="headword">Vaughan, Sir  William</span> <span class="st"> [<em>pseud. </em>Orpheus junior]</span>  (<em>c.</em>1575&#150;1641), <span class="occ">writer and promoter of colonization in Newfoundland</span>, was the second son of Walter Vaughan (<i>d</i>. 1598), twice member of parliament, of Golden Grove, Llanfihangel Aberbythych, Carmarthenshire, and his first wife, Mary (<i>d</i>. before 1588), daughter of Sir Walter Rice of Newton, Dinefwr, Carmarthenshire. William matriculated, along with his elder brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28133/', "John Vaughan")</script> (created earl of Carbery in 1628), from Jesus College, Oxford, on 4 February 1592, and graduated BA on 1 March 1595 and MA on 16 November 1597. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28128/', "Sir Henry Vaughan")</script>, royalist army officer, was a younger brother. William supplicated for the degree of BCL on 3 December 1600. As a young man he travelled extensively in France and Italy, and also visited Vienna, where he received a doctorate in law, being incorporated DCL at Oxford on 23 June 1605.<br>
<br>Vaughan showed early his aptitude for writing accomplished poetry, especially of a religious nature, in Latin. While at Oxford he published <span class="italic"><i>Er&#333;topaignion</i> pium</span> (1597) and <span class="italic">Erotopainion pium</span>, part 2 (1598), containing verse paraphrases of the <span class="roman">Bible</span>. The contents of the two publications again appeared in the more widely known <span class="italic">Poematum libellus</span> (1598). This volume also contains an encomiastic ode addressed to Robert Devereux, earl of Essex (with whose family the Vaughans were closely connected); &#145;De sphaerarum ordine&#146;, a didactic cycle of verses on the sun, moon, and planets; and a section entitled &#145;Palaemonis amores philosophici&#146;, seventeen poems in which themes from classical poets like Catullus and Ovid are combined with sonnet-like effusions of a Petrarchan nature. Also included in <span class="italic">Poematum libellus</span> is a memorial poem on the death of Vaughan's father (&#145;Speculum humanae condicionis&#146;), which was also printed separately.<br>
<br>In 1600 Vaughan's most famous work appeared, <span class="italic">The Golden-Grove, Moralized in Three Bookes</span> (a second edition, &#145;now lately reviewed and enlarged by the Author&#146;, was published in 1608). The title recalls both the name of the Vaughan family home (the work is dedicated to William's brother John) and &#145;the golden grove of the ancient Hesperides&#146;. Among liminary Latin verses to greet the work are poems by notable Oxford contemporaries of the two brothers, among them John Williams and Griffith Powell (both Carmarthenshire men who became principal of Jesus College), and the Latin dramatist Matthew Gwinne. The prose text of <span class="italic">The Golden-Grove</span> is written in English, and presents a learned and elaborate treatise &#145;very necessary for all such as would know how to governe themselves, their houses or their countrey&#146;. The arrangement is in three books, dealing in Aristotelian fashion with the religious and moral (&#145;virtue&#146;), economic (&#145;family&#146;), and political (&#145;civility&#146; or &#145;commonwealth&#146;) aspects of human life. Vaughan is particularly sensitive to social relationships; he displays advanced views on farming and estate management, and his concern for the plight of yeomen (as in his native Carmarthenshire) foreshadows his later commitment to colonial enterprises: &#145;There is no life more pleasant than a Yeomans life &hellip; But now a dayes yeomanrie is decayed, hospitalitie gone to wracke, and husbandrie almost quite fallen&#146;  (1608 edition, sig. v4ii&#150;iii). Throughout <span class="italic">The Golden-Grove</span> quotations from classical authors abound, notably Persius, on whose satires Vaughan says in his preface that he had prepared an unpublished commentary. Other references to literary matters also give an indication of some of Vaughan's attitudes. In book 1 he delivers a diatribe against &#145;stage playes&#146;, but in book 3 the &#145;excellency&#146; of true poetry is extolled. From the time of Moses and Homer poets &#145;were the first that observed the sacred operations of nature&#146;  (sig. Z1<i>v</i>), and poetry the chief cause of the heathen's &#145;civility&#146;. &#145;Neither is our owne age altogether to be dispraysed&#146;  (sig. Z7<i>r</i>), and he singles out the earl of Surrey, Sir Philip Sidney, and James VI of Scotland for special mention.<br>
<br>Details of Vaughan's life in the years immediately after returning from his European tour are patchy. In the early 1600s he married Elizabeth, daughter and heir of David ap Robert of Llangyndeyrn. Her home, Tor-y-coed (which Vaughan sometimes quaintly spelt &#145;Terra-Coed&#146;), thereafter became his main residence. A son of the marriage, Francis, appears to have died young. Further tragedy came upon the family in January 1608, when the house was struck by lightning and Elizabeth Vaughan killed. Vaughan himself escaped, one of several preservations that he came to interpret as signs of divine calling to special service. His wife's death affected him deeply, and for a time he appears to have suffered from something close to religious mania. He was also the victim of insinuations about the circumstances of his wife's death. To refute these he wrote a strangely mystical work entitled <span class="italic">The spirit of detraction conjured and convicted in seven circles: a work both divine and morall, fit to be perused by the libertines of the age, who endeavour by their detracting and derogatory speeches to embezell the glory of God and the credit of their neighbours</span> (1611).<br>
<br>Another of Vaughan's early interests was medicine. In 1600, the same year as the first edition of <span class="italic">The Golden-Grove</span>, he published <span class="italic">Naturall and Artificiall Directions for Health</span>, a work that he was to revise and enlarge through several editions and under slightly different titles (<span class="italic">Approved Directions for Health</span>; <span class="italic">Directions for Health</span>) for the rest of his life. This work, like <span class="italic">The Golden-Grove</span>, was in part occasioned by his concern for the condition of ordinary people, and his directions, &#145;derived from the best Phisitians, as well as moderne as antient&#146;, come under six headings: &#145;air, fire and water&#146;; &#145;food and nourishment&#146;; &#145;evacuations, as purgations, Tobacco taking, etc.&#146;; &#145;infirmities, humours, and death&#146;; &#145;perturbations of the mind, and spiritual sicknesses&#146;; &#145;quarterly, monthly, and daily diet with Medicines to prolong life&#146;.<br>
<br>William Vaughan married as his second wife Anne (<i>d</i>. 1672), daughter of John Christmas of Colchester, and with her had one son, Edward, and five daughters, Margaret, Jane, Dorothy, Mary, and Anne. As became a member of his family, he was involved in the public affairs of Carmarthenshire and was sheriff of the county for 1616. His major concern, however, from 1616 onwards was with promoting colonization in the New World, in part as a hoped-for means of alleviating social and economic problems of the kind that he had described in <span class="italic">The Golden-Grove</span>. Various possibilities were considered, but in the end his choice fell on Newfoundland. In 1610 &#145;a company of adventurers&#146; had been granted, by James I, territory in Newfoundland for the purposes of colonial development. In 1616 Vaughan purchased from the company land south of a line extending from Placentia Bay to Caplin Bay on the Avalon peninsula, on the eastern part of the island. In token of its Welsh origin, the colony was named Cambriol. The first group of settlers was sent out in 1617, at Vaughan's expense, to the Aquafort area, and a governor, Captain Richard Whitbourne, was appointed in 1618. Whitbourne reorganized the colony, and made Renews its centre. The venture proved, however, extremely precarious, and by 1619 the colony had collapsed, although some of the settlers probably remained. According to the autobiographical material in <span class="italic">The Newlanders Cure</span>, Vaughan assigned part of his land to Henry Cary, Viscount Falkland, and another portion to Sir George Calvert. Nevertheless, his interest in Newfoundland remained unabated: &#145;my Zeale to Newfoundland is not frozen&#146;, he wrote in 1630  (<span class="italic">The Newlanders Cure</span>, sig. A5<i>v</i>). Although there is no hard evidence to support the claim, often made, that Vaughan himself visited the territory on the Avalon peninsula, his attempts to promote it continued throughout the 1620s. In 1625 he published a Latin poem, &#145;Cambrensium Caroleia&#146;, in honour of the marriage of Charles I, and included with it John Mason's map of Newfoundland. This shows names of many Welsh towns and counties, and also Vaughan's Cove and Golden Grove.<br>
<br>Mason's map was also included in the most extraordinary of all Vaughan's works, written under the pseudonym Orpheus junior: <span class="italic">The golden fleece divided into three parts, under which are discovered the errours of religion, the vices and decayes of the kingdome, and lastly the wayes to get wealth, and to restore trading so much complayned of: transported from Cambrioll Colchos, out of the southermost part of the iland, commonly called the Newfoundland, by Orpheus junior, for the generall and perpetuall good of Great Britaine</span> (1626). The work fancifully draws a parallel between the mission conducted by Jason and his fellow Argonauts to win the golden fleece and the opportunities offered to colonists, especially Orpheus junior's &#145;countreymen of Wales&#146;, in Newfoundland. The book abounds with classical allusions, many of them symbolically interpreted. The god Apollo is shown passing judgment in religious, political, economic, and moral matters. Leading historical figures are brought before him to plead the cause of their actions, and are approved or otherwise by the god. The &#145;Cambrioll Colchos&#146; of Newfoundland is finally shown to be the answer to all ills. Although <span class="italic">The Golden Fleece</span> is a rambling work, and bigoted in its hostility to Roman Catholicism, it remains a remarkable piece of colonial propaganda, and is one of the earliest books concerned with America.<br>
<br>In 1626 Vaughan's anti-Catholic passion found further expression in the publication of <span class="italic">The New-Found Politicke</span>, a translation by Vaughan, John Florio, and another, unnamed, author of selections from Traiano Boccalini's <span class="italic">Ragguagli di Parnaso</span>. Dedicated to Charles I, the work is an earnest, although indirect, warning against concluding any alliance with Spain. In 1630 a further medical work, <span class="italic">The Newlanders Cure</span>, came from Vaughan's pen. The book is primarily aimed at emigrants undertaking the voyage to the New World, and in particular discusses remedies for scurvy and other likely complaints. The knowledgeable discussion of colonists' ailments has sometimes been taken to signify that Vaughan did at last cross the Atlantic in the late 1620s, but the autobiographical material contained in the dedication strongly suggests that visiting Newfoundland was for him still only a dream rather than a realized fact.<br>
<br>In 1628 Vaughan was knighted, in Ireland. As far as is known, he lived for the rest of his life in Carmarthenshire, and &#145;consoled himself for the failure of his dreams with his meditations and writings upon religion&#146;  (Cell, <span class="italic">Newfoundland</span>, 26). At the end of his life he produced two bulky books of verse, <span class="italic">The church militant, historically continued from the yeare of our Saviours incarnation 33 untill this present 1640</span> (1640) and <span class="italic">The soules exercise in the daily contemplation of our Saviours birth, life, passion, and resurrection</span> (1641). &#145;Poor, Cambriol's Lord&#146;, to use Robert Hayman's appellation for Vaughan, died in August 1641, probably at Tor-y-coed, and was buried at Llangyndeyrn &#145;without vain pomp&#146;, as was enjoined in his will (dated 14 August and proved at Carmarthen on 27 August 1641).<br>
