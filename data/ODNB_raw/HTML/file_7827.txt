<span class="headword">Dopping,  Anthony</span>  (1643&#150;1697), <span class="occ">Church of Ireland bishop of Meath</span>, was born on 28 March 1643, the son of Anthony Dopping, originally from Frampton in Gloucestershire, who had bought an estate in co. Meath in 1636. His place of birth is given as Dublin by Harris  (<span class="italic">Whole Works of Sir James Ware</span>, 1.394) but as Gloucester in the registers of Trinity College, Dublin  (Burtchaell &amp; Sadleir, <span class="italic">Alum. Dubl.</span>, 238), which he entered on 28 September 1655, having previously attended St Patrick's Cathedral school. He graduated BA in 1660 and MA in 1662, and was elected a fellow in 1662. In November 1669 he became vicar of St Andrew's parish, Dublin. He was appointed to the bishopric of Kildare on 16 January 1679 and consecrated in Christ Church Cathedral on 2 February. On 11 February 1682 he was translated to the bishopric of Meath, and as was normal with this senior bishopric was admitted to the privy council (5 April 1682). In the same year he was also appointed vice-chancellor of Trinity College. In these appointments he had the support both of the duke of Ormond, whose chaplain he had been while at St Andrew's, and of Archbishop Michael Boyle of Armagh.<br>
<br>Dopping's sermons during 1682&#150;8 strongly upheld the traditional doctrines of divine right and passive resistance, although reports of a sermon on 31 January 1686 denouncing Catholic doctrine reached James II, who had the lord lieutenant, the earl of Clarendon, reprimand him. On 27 March 1689 Dopping led a delegation of clergy to meet James on his arrival in Dublin and assure him of their loyalty. Over the next sixteen months he acted as the principal spokesman for Irish protestants living under the Jacobite regime, repeatedly petitioning for the protection of churches, persons, and property, as well as joining William King in administering the diocese of Dublin in the absence of Archbishop Marsh. He took his seat in the House of Lords of the Jacobite parliament of May&#150;June 1689, where he opposed legislation on tithes, liberty of conscience, the repeal of the Restoration land settlement, and other measures. On 7 July 1690, after the battle of the Boyne and the Jacobite withdrawal from Dublin, he led a deputation of clergy to William's camp at Finglas to declare their allegiance. Thereafter his declared position, both in sermons and in private correspondence, was that James had forfeited his crown by consenting to the destruction of his protestant subjects and by abandoning his kingdom.<br>
<br>Although Dopping's rapid changes of allegiance exposed him to some criticism, the new Williamite administration initially gave him a prominent role in both civil and ecclesiastical affairs. On 26 November 1691, however, preaching at a service of thanksgiving for the completion of the war, he forcefully denounced the treaty of Limerick, arguing that the long series of rebellions that had taken place since 1172 demonstrated the futility of any compromise settlement negotiated with the Irish. For this direct attack on government policy he was suspended from the privy council on 5 January 1692 and restored only in August 1695. His indiscretion, along with continuing doubts regarding his collaboration with the Jacobite regime, probably contributed to his failure to be appointed to either of the two archbishoprics, Cashel and Dublin, that became vacant in 1693&#150;4.<br>
<br>In the early 1690s Dopping was one of the group of bishops, also including William King and Nathaniel Foy, who lobbied government for the reform of the Irish church. In March 1694 he and King, executing a royal commission to inquire into the mismanagement of the diocese of Down and Connor, deprived the bishop, Thomas Hackett, and several of his senior clergy. Dopping's own visitation records and instructions to his clergy reveal a strong commitment to high pastoral standards. In 1696 he published a treatise on episcopal visitation, <span class="italic">Tractatus de visitationibus episcopalibus</span>. William King, many years later, responded angrily to an unfavourable comparison between his own brusque treatment of his clergy and Dopping's &#145;mildness and gentle persuasion&#146;, insisting that he had accomplished more in five or six years in Derry than Dopping had in fifteen years in co. Meath  (King, 213).<br>
<br>Dopping was an intermittent supporter of proposals to evangelize the Catholic Irish through the Irish language. He solicited subscriptions for the edition of Bedell's Irish translation of the <span class="roman">Old Testament</span> printed in 1685, and also wrote a preface, although this was mislaid and never printed. However, Narcissus Marsh complained in 1686 that Dopping subsequently &#145;flew off from prosecuting what he designed and promised, and has ever since been wholly unconcerned and sat neuter&#146;  (Maddison, 86). He returned to the idea of sponsoring preaching through Irish in 1693, but by 1697 had again rejected the idea. His change of heart seems to have been due in each case to fears that such efforts would retard the spread of English language and culture. Where dissenters were concerned, his anonymous pamphlet <span class="italic">The Case of the Dissenters of Ireland</span> (1695) conceded their right to religious freedom while defending their exclusion from civic office.<br>
<br>About 1669 Dopping married Jane Molyneux. He assisted his brother-in-law, William Molyneux, by obtaining a detailed description of co. Westmeath for a projected atlas in 1682, and at his request contributed to the financial support of the Gaelic antiquary Roderick O'Flaherty. He also shared Molyneux's interest in constitutional issues, and in 1692 published <span class="italic">Modus tenendi parliamenta &amp; consilia in Hibernia</span>, from a manuscript left to him by Molyneux's father-in-law, William Domville. Dopping died in Dublin on 25 April 1697 and was buried in St Andrew's Church. His son Samuel was elected MP for Armagh in 1695, 1703, and 1714, and for Trinity College in 1715. Another son, Anthony, was bishop of Ossory from 1740 until his death in 1743.<br>
