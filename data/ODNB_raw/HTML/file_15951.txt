<span class="headword">Lamont,  John</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1636&#150;1671), <span class="occ">diarist</span>, was probably the son of Thomas Lamont (<i>c</i>.1586&#150;1636), minister of Scoonie, Fife, from 1614 onwards, and his wife, Margaret Cockburn, and grandson of Allan Lamont, also minister of Scoonie, and of Kennoway, whose ancestors came from Argyll. He is known chiefly because of his diary, which runs from March 1649 to April 1671 but is plainly incomplete both at the beginning and at the end. It covers a particularly significant period of Scottish history, which includes the proclamation of Charles II as king of Scotland, the Cromwellian invasion, the enforced union with England in the 1650s, and the Restoration, but such nationally important events are only briefly recorded. In addition the diary records births, marriages, and deaths in various Fife families, including Lamont's own, as well as in various Scottish noble families, making it of considerable genealogical interest. It is particularly informative about the affairs of the family of Lundin of Lundin, to which his brother Allan was factor and chaplain at Lundie. It is possible that Lamont may himself have been factor to this family at some time, but details of this are unknown.<br>
<br>Judging by the diary Lamont never married, and died some time after 1671. His most likely heir would have been his brother Allan's son John, born in 1661, who probably inherited the manuscript diary among Lamont's other papers. This John Lamont was, like his father, factor at Lundie, and was at some time a skipper in Over Largo. In 1695 he acquired the estate of Newton in the parish of Kennoway. This caused confusion when the diary was first published by Archibald Constable as <span class="italic">The Chronicle of Fife</span> in 1810. It was described as the diary of John Lamont &#145;of Newton&#146;, and attributed to the nephew rather than the uncle, who never owned the Newton estate. This mistaken identification was repeated when the diary was published a second time in 1830 by the Maitland Club. The confusion was resolved by Walter Wood in an appendix to his <span class="italic">East Neuk of Fife</span> (1887), which differentiated between uncle and nephew and identified the former as the diarist; the latter was the grandfather of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15949/', "David Lamont (1753&#150;1837)")</script>, the prominent Church of Scotland minister.<br>
