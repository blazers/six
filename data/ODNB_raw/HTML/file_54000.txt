<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Read,  James</span>  (1777&#150;1852), <span class="occ">missionary in Cape Colony and political activist</span>, was born on 3 December 1777, in Abridge, Essex, the son of Joseph and Susannah Read. A carpenter of little education, by early manhood he was a member of the Hackney church of the Anglican evangelical John Eyre. In November 1798 he set sail for the south seas under the aegis of the London Missionary Society (LMS). The LMS vessel was captured by the French off Brazil, and it was a year before Read could return to London, after vicissitudes which included stays in Montevideo and Lisbon. Undeterred, he next set sail for Cape Colony, and arrived in Cape Town in September 1800.<br>
<br>The then British governor, Dundas, feared that evangelicals would further destabilize the war-torn eastern frontier of this recently acquired colony. He therefore refused Read permission to join his elderly Dutch colleague, the strong-willed, unconventional Johannes Theodorus van der Kemp, in his mission to the Xhosa of Ngqika beyond the colony. Read evangelized British soldiers instead, until 1801, when van der Kemp abandoned the Xhosa mission and the two missionaries met in Graaff-Reinet, a small settlement in the north-east of the colony, plunged into conflict between Africans and white farmers. There Read began his lifelong work among the Khoi-Khoi, once semi-nomadic cattle herders but now devastated by colonialism.<br>
<br>Despite violent settler resistance Read and van der Kemp ministered to a group of about 700 Khoi-Khoi refugees who had fled from frontier warfare. In August 1801 the two briefly visited Ngqika. In 1802 they led a small group of Khoi-Khoi to Botha's Farm, Algoa Bay. After an attack by other Khoi-Khoi who saw this group as having sold out, the community moved to Fort Frederick during the 1802 British withdrawal. In 1803 the incoming Batavian regime allotted new land for what would become Bethelsdorp, the first permanent African mission station of the LMS. On 20 June 1803 Read married Elizabeth Valentyn (1779&#150;1849), a Khoi-Khoi convert. The couple had four surviving daughters and three sons, including James Read junior (1811&#150;1894). In 1805 van der Kemp ordained Read after the congregation &#145;called&#146; him as minister.<br>
<br>Emotional religious conversions occurred at Bethelsdorp at a time of great stress for the Khoi-Khoi and other groups, including former slaves. The station earned intense colonial opprobium in the 1800s and 1810s, in large part because landless labourers used residence there to escape <i>de facto</i> forced labour on white farms. Laziness and sexual debauchery were said to be rampant, and the missionaries were accused in colonial circles of living like the Khoi-Khoi instead of &#145;raising&#146; them up. There was also conflict over Khoi-Khoi obligations to carry out public work, and over conditions in the Khoi-Khoi regiment in Cape Town. In 1805 Read and van der Kemp were detained at the Cape by Governor Janssens, a Batavian. The incoming British permitted the pair to return in 1806. Read and van der Kemp continued to complain about settler violence against the Khoi-Khoi; in 1808 Read published a vivid account in the <span class="italic">Transactions of the London Missionary Society</span>. In the wake of high-level official comment, which may have pushed the government to establish district circuit courts in 1811, a series of court cases in 1812 lodged by Read and certain Khoi-Khoi plaintiffs threw the eastern Cape into turmoil; the judges' report may have concealed the truth, but the so-called &#145;black circuit&#146; remained a significant Afrikaner grievance against the British.<br>
<br>In 1811 van der Kemp died, and Read became the LMS African superintendent. In 1816 he helped to revive a mission to the Xhosa and then led a large team of men and women from Bethelsdorp to found a mission beyond the colony to the southern Tswana Tlhaping. In 1817, however, dissatisfied LMS missionaries at the Cape accused Read and several others of sexual immorality and political insubordination, revealing that Read had had an illegitimate son with Sabina Pretorius, a Khoi convert. LMS directors dispatched two investigators, one of whom, John Philip (1775&#150;1851), replaced Read as superintendent. Read was removed from Dithakong in 1820 and compelled to make a public confession at Bethelsdorp. He and his wife continued to work at Bethelsdorp, under James Kitchingman's headship.<br>
<br>Shortly after his return Read again earned official sanction after lodging accusations before the incoming acting governor, Sir Rufane Donkin, about maltreatment of the Khoi-Khoi. Although Donkin found the accusations malicious, in 1821 John Philip examined evidence which substantiated Read's claims and triggered his own campaign for race-blind legislation in southern Africa. The role of the work of Philip and Read in the 1828 passage of ordinance 50, which <i>inter alia</i> removed racial distinctions from Cape law, has been disputed; the LMS certainly took the credit, however, earning both loyalty and scorn as a result.<br>
<br>In 1829 a settlement of &#145;free&#146; Khoi-Khoi was established on recently conquered land at Kat River as a buffer between settlers and Xhosa. Members of this community called Read as their minister. Read helped relay Khoi-Khoi protests against Cape Colony's restoration of vagrancy legislation in 1834 after the abolition of slavery, and the authorities in London then overturned the legislation. When frontier warfare began again in 1834&#150;5, Read channelled Xhosa complaints to Philip, who, through Thomas Fowell Buxton, had indirect influence with the Colonial Office. Meanwhile, Governor D'Urban banished the Reads from Kat River; Read blamed the governor for the death of his seventeen-year-old daughter during the move. In 1836&#150;7 Read, Philip, James Read junior, Andries Stoffels, and Dyani Tshatshu travelled to London to testify before the House of Commons select committee on Aborigines&#151;a committee engineered by Fowell Buxton in part to publicize south African issues. D'Urban was recalled, and land was returned to the Xhosa, but Read returned to Africa in February 1838 to find himself one of the most hated men in the colony.<br>
<br>Kat River Khoi-Khoi ran important missions, co-ordinated by Read, among neighbouring African communities, including San and Thembu groups. Read argued throughout for an African clergy and for congregational autonomy in the choice of ministers, including the right to dismiss white missionaries. By the 1840s the majority of other LMS missionaries were infuriated by what they saw as Read's attempts to undermine their authority with local peoples. Tensions culminated in the mid-1840s when a large faction of the LMS, spearheaded by Henry Calderwood, tried unsuccessfully to oust Read, confirming the latter's growing isolation.<br>
<br>In 1846 frontier warfare erupted again. Kat River settlers, including Read and his sons, supported the colonial side, but the community was none the less subject to colonial abuse and was not recompensed for losses; thereafter it was maladministered, and harshly. It continued to bear the brunt of racially discriminatory economic policies as British settlers gained more political power. In 1851 many Khoi-Khoi, including a large minority of Kat River inhabitants, and other members of what was coming to be called the &#145;coloured&#146; community, joined the Xhosa side during further frontier warfare as a consequence of their treatment by the colonial administration and the settlers. Read and his son James desperately tried to prevent the rebellion but were told by rebels that Read's &#145;writing to London&#146; was no longer effective. In the disastrous aftermath of the failed rebellion, the government encouraged the purchase of much of Kat River by white land speculators. The elderly Khoi-Khoi <i>veldcornet</i> Andries Botha was condemned to death (though the sentence was later commuted) in a trial which was widely seen as a judgment on the entire Kat River Khoi-Khoi community, and particularly on James Read.<br>
<br>Read died at Eland's Post at the Kat River settlement, deeply depressed, on 8 May 1852, on the same day that Botha's death sentence was announced. He was buried locally, at Philipton. Caught between colonial ambiguities and convinced of his own failure, he probably had a greater impact in a variety of ways than most other missionaries of his generation.<br>
