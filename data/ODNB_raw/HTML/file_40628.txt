<span class="headword">Barriffe,  William</span>  (1599/1600&#150;1643), <span class="occ">military writer and parliamentarian army officer</span>, was probably born in London, the son of William Barriffe, cordwainer in the city, and his wife, Florence, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Pope. On 14 January 1621 at St Gregory by Paul, London, he married Anne Rundell, with whom he had seven children. In his early years Barriffe worked, like his father, as a cordwainer; he was a member of the livery company, and lived in Wood Street in the City of London.<br>
<br>After being admitted to the artillery company of London on 13 March 1627 Barriffe quickly gained a reputation for military expertise, while the fame of his notes on practice led to the publication of <span class="italic">Military Discipline, or, The Yong Artillery Man</span> (1635). The latter was not a student of gunnery but a habitu&eacute; of the artillery garden, where he learned how to become a competent infantry soldier. Barriffe's book, tailored to this clientele, eschewed &#145;<i>fine phrases</i>&#146; and historical and foreign examples; his prose was plain and clear, his diagrams numerous, and his instructions detailed as he &#145;set forth the <i>exact grounds</i> of this our <i>moderne discipline</i>, for the exercising of a <i>foot Company</i>&#146;  (Barriffe, <span class="italic">Military Discipline</span>, 1635, &#145;To &hellip; Sir Ralph Bosvile&#146;). His aim was to help the young officer to educate himself in the practicalities of war, and help him to educate others.<br>
<br>In 1639 a second edition of <span class="italic">Military Discipline</span> added a chapter on &#145;the Swedish brigade&#146;  (title-page) which incorporated contemporary European practice in handling larger bodies of men. With it Barriffe published <span class="italic">Mars, his Triumph</span> (1639), a stirring account of a mock battle between Christians and Saracens involving eighty members of the artillery company, in which Christianity and the latest military practice ultimately triumphed. Here, as in <span class="italic">Military Discipline</span>, Barriffe expressed his belief that &#145;<i>the</i> Souldier <i>and the</i> Citizen&#146; should &#145;<i>Make but</i> one man&#146;  (Barriffe, <span class="italic">Mars, his Triumph</span>, 7). Four more authorized editions of <span class="italic">Military Discipline</span> appeared between 1643 and 1661, as well as four pirated ones. A manual published in Boston in 1701 still saluted Barriffe as one of &#145;the Authors of best Note, upon this Subject &hellip; and &hellip; most in use among us&#146;  (N. Boone, <span class="italic">Military Discipline. The Compleat Souldier</span>).<br>
<br>Barriffe's military training, unlike that of many of his contemporaries, was entirely home grown. He was proudly the product of the artillery company, though he was also active from about 1628 in a secondary company at Cripplegate. With the outbreak of war he rose rapidly in the parliamentarian army. He was a major in Hampden's regiment in 1642, and by 1643 he was a lieutenant-colonel; he served with Hampden at the siege of Reading in April of that year, and in July received a sizeable payment for his military service. Barriffe died on 28 July 1643 and was buried at St Alban's, Wood Street, London. He was survived by his wife, who probably died in 1652, and by six of their children. His will was proved in February 1644.<br>
<br>Barriffe appears to have been gregarious, and the friendships represented by the laudatory verses prefacing <span class="italic">Military Discipline</span>, and the number of soldiers named in his work, reveal the degree of military interest in pre-civil war London. Later editions provide valuable evidence of the dispersal of these citizen officers into civil war armies. Above all he had, as the frontispiece to <span class="italic">Military Discipline</span> claimed, &#145;a Soldiers minde&#146;.<br>
