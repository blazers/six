<span class="headword">Cook,  Stanley Arthur</span>  (1873&#150;1949), <span class="occ">biblical scholar and Semitist</span>, was born on 12 April 1873 at St John's Terrace, King's Lynn, Norfolk, the son of John Thomas Cook, coal merchant, and his wife, Frances Sarah Else. He was educated at Wyggeston School, Leicester, and at Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, where he was a scholar. He was placed in the first class of the Semitic languages tripos in 1894, was Tyrwhitt Hebrew scholar and Mason Hebrew prizeman in 1895, and in 1896 won the Jeremie <span class="roman">Septuagint</span> prize. Cook married on 16 April 1898 Annette (1873/4&#150;1942), daughter of William Thomas Bell, lithographic printer's manager; they had no children. From 1904 to 1932 he was lecturer in Hebrew at his old college of which he became a fellow in 1900, and from 1912 to 1920 was also lecturer in comparative religion. In 1931 he was appointed university lecturer in Aramaic, and in 1932 he was the first layman to be elected to the regius professorship of Hebrew, a post he held until his retirement in 1938.<br>
<br>Cook grew up in the days of William Robertson Smith, T. K. Cheyne, A. B. Davidson, S. R. Driver, and other pioneers in <span class="roman">Old Testament</span> research, and he belongs with them to the history of biblical scholarship. His association as a young man (1896&#150;1903) with the <span class="italic">Encyclopaedia Biblica</span> was the beginning of a long period of editorial work, which included the editorship for thirty years (1902&#150;32) of the <span class="italic">Quarterly Statement</span> of the Palestine Exploration Fund. He was on the editorial staff of the eleventh and fourteenth editions of the <span class="italic">Encyclopaedia Britannica</span>. For more than fifty years he produced original work which in extent and variety was astonishing. Up to 1910 his interest was centred on Semitic languages, inscriptions, history, <span class="roman">Old Testament</span> analysis, and archaeology. After 1910 he was drawn to the study of psychology, philosophy, sociology, and religion in all its aspects. The publication of <span class="italic">The Study of Religions</span> (1914) marks the transition from his earlier to his later interests. Henceforward his life's work was directed towards the relating of his vast knowledge of Semitic antiquity to all problems of human existence. In the views he held he was bold but not rash, and his writings, although difficult to read, were always stimulating and often challenging. Some of his work was soon superseded, but his more solid contributions, such as his fine chapters in the <span class="italic">Cambridge Ancient History</span>, of which he was a joint editor, and his monumental Schweich lectures (1925, published 1930) had more lasting value. Cook was elected president of the Society for Old Testament Study in 1925, an honorary member of the Society of Biblical Literature (USA) in 1931, and FBA in 1933. He took the degree of LittD at Cambridge in 1920 and received the honorary degrees of DD from the University of Aberdeen (1937) and DLitt from Oxford (1938). In 1948, on the occasion of his seventy-fifth birthday, he was presented with a volume entitled <span class="italic">Essays and Studies</span> which contained a select bibliography of his writings. Cook died after a short illness at the Evelyn Nursing Home, Cambridge, on 26 September 1949.<br>
