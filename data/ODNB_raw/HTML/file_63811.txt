<span class="headword">Jackson, Sir  Percy Richard</span>  (1869&#150;1941), <span class="occ">educational administrator</span>, was born at Hebble Terrace, Huddersfield, Yorkshire, on 23 January 1869, the son of William Michael Jackson, tea merchant, and his wife, Anne Field. He attended Huddersfield collegiate school before entering business in the textile industry, where he became head of the firm of Field and Bottrill Ltd, plush manufacturers, of Skelmanthorpe, near Huddersfield. On 26 April 1893 he married Mary Elizabeth (1870/71&#150;1938), daughter of Thomas Blacker, a contractor, at Skelmanthorpe Wesleyan Methodist Church, near Huddersfield. They had three sons, the eldest of whom was killed in the First World War, and four daughters.<br>
<br>As Jackson was an active member of the Methodist church and of the Liberal Party, his career in public affairs in the West Riding of Yorkshire strongly reflected local traditions of nonconformity and Liberalism. He was first elected to the West Riding county council in 1904 and remained a member until his retirement in 1937. He joined the education committee in 1905 and was chairman from 1918 until 1937; he was thus closely involved in the principal educational initiatives of one of the largest authorities in England. A man of abundant energy and a perceptive grasp of affairs, his special gift was an ability to reconcile sharply opposing interests without a sacrifice of principle&#151;a gift that he had ample opportunity to exercise. Religious decisions over education were particularly contentious; so too were the problems thrown up by the relationships between the county and the part III elementary education authorities (medium-sized boroughs and urban districts which gained the right to become local education authorities for specified purposes) and county boroughs which lay within the boundaries of the West Riding.<br>
<br>The strong local nonconformist tradition led to more difficulties in this authority than anywhere else in England after 1902, when the <span class="roman">Education Act</span> of that year required local education authorities to maintain church schools. The initial refusal of the activists among the Liberal members fully to accept their new legal responsibilities produced difficult relationships with both Roman Catholic and Anglican schools. While the position gradually settled down in the existing schools, attempts between the wars to reorganize schooling to give pupils aged over eleven separate senior or modern schools again excited traditional attitudes, for the churches certainly did not want to lose their older pupils to council senior schools. In the face of considerable opposition from some of his more entrenched councillors, Jackson managed in 1930, after an earlier, unsuccessful agreement in 1926, to secure a concordat on religious education with the Church of England diocesan authorities. This enabled some reorganization to go forward in the 1930s. The full significance of Jackson's achievement became clear when his compromise was used as an essential element in the national settlement in the <span class="roman">Education Act</span> of 1944.<br>
<br>After the First World War conflicts between counties and larger boroughs assumed sufficient importance for the government to appoint a royal commission in 1923. The West Riding, with nine county boroughs by this time, most of which seemed intent on enlarging their boundaries at the expense of the county, strongly defended its position in evidence. Yet in practice there was need for co-operation if the interests of the area as a whole were not to suffer, and this was particularly urgent in technical and further education. Jackson succeeded in bringing the main local authorities together in the Yorkshire council for further education in 1928. This became an effective organization for regional planning and co-operation in the 1930s. It served as the model in the wartime Board of Education for the planners of post-war technological education. The subsequent regional advisory councils set up from 1946 to cover the whole country followed its pattern. Jackson also managed to hold together the county councils of the three ridings in the Yorkshire council for agricultural education, although this broke up a few years after he ceased to be chairman.<br>
<br>Jackson, who was knighted in 1925, became a leading figure in education at national level. He was a member of the executive of the Association of Education Committees, of which he became president in 1924, and was chairman of the education committee of the County Councils Association. This dual responsibility gave him a position of considerable significance on the Burnham committee on teachers' salaries, of which he was deputy leader. He was a member of the consultative committee of the Board of Education from 1922 to 1938 when it produced the two major reports on schools of the inter-war years, the Hadow report, <span class="italic">The Education of the Adolescent</span> (1927), which recommended ending the all-age elementary school and separate provision for pupils over eleven, and the Spens report (1938) on secondary and technical education. He was a member of the royal commission on the civil service (1930&#150;31).<br>
<br>In 1925 Jackson became a trustee of the United Kingdom Carnegie Trust, which supported many forms of social activity, and was appointed vice-chairman in 1934. He continued his work with the trust until his death. He gave up his membership of the county council in 1937 but remained a member of the executive of the Land Settlement Association, of which he had been a founder and the first chairman. Its purpose was to provide estates where unemployed men from depressed areas could learn how to run their own smallholdings. He took a particular personal interest in the work of the settlement at Carlton, Snaith, which was nearest to his home.<br>
<br>Following the death of his first wife in 1938 Jackson married Jessie Ewen Robertson (<i>b</i>. 1894/5), a schoolmistress, at Hove Presbyterian Church, Sussex, on 14 February 1939. He died of coronary thrombosis on 24 December 1941 at his home, Woodlands, Scissett, Skelmanthorpe, Yorkshire, and was buried on 28 December at Skelmanthorpe cemetery. He was survived by his second wife.<br>
