<span class="headword">Fairfax,  Thomas</span>, sixth Lord Fairfax of Cameron  (1693&#150;1781), <span class="occ">landowner</span>, was born on 22 October 1693 at Leeds Castle, Kent, the eldest son of Thomas, fifth Lord Fairfax (1657&#150;1710), landowner and politician, and Catherine Culpeper (<i>d</i>. 1719), heir of the great estates of Lord Culpeper, including Leeds Castle and the northern neck between the Rappahannock and Potomac rivers in Virginia. He was educated at Oriel College, Oxford, between 1710 and 1713. In 1710 he became sixth Lord Fairfax on the death of his father, whose legacy brought debts and required the sale of the Yorkshire estates in 1716. Three years later he inherited his mother's estates in Kent and Virginia.<br>
<br>Fairfax was a talented and ambitious man who included Viscount Bolingbroke, Joseph Addison, and Richard Steele among his friends. He was deputy treasurer of the king's household until 1721, when he was dismissed and commissioned in the Horse Guards. He resided at Leeds Castle on retiring from the army, and in 1735 he made his first visit to Virginia, where his cousin William Fairfax acted as proprietary agent and collector of customs.<br>
<br>In the following decade Fairfax was involved in negotiations to implement the recommendations of a survey ordered by the privy council to settle a dispute over territory on the western boundary of the northern neck. In 1745 the privy council upheld the survey's conclusions, enabling Fairfax to more than double his holding to 5 million acres. Two years later he moved permanently to Virginia, and for some time lived at his cousin's house at Belvoir. Here he made the acquaintance of the Washington family.<br>
<br>Fairfax moved to the Shenandoah valley, where he built two properties, Leeds Manor and Greenway Court, near Winchester. George Washington, then a young man of sixteen, was asked to survey and map his property. At Greenway Court Fairfax combined a lifestyle befitting a country gentleman (his passion was for fox-hunting) with an active interest in improving his estate. He also assisted in the development of Winchester and Alexandria, and supported the construction of a Potomac River canal.<br>
<br>Fairfax avoided having to take sides during the American War of Independence and was able to maintain his property intact when other estates were confiscated. At the time of his death he had amassed a considerable fortune (&pound;47,377 3<i>s</i>. 9<i>d</i>. in Virginia currency), which made him one of America's richest men. Despite his wealth, Fairfax favoured a simple life and was known for his generosity. He died at Greenway Court on 9 December 1781, and was buried at the parish church of Winchester, Virginia. On his death he was unmarried and had no children, and the title passed to Robert Fairfax, his only surviving brother.<br>
