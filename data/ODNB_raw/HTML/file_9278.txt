<span class="headword">Felton,  William</span>  (1715&#150;1769), <span class="occ">composer</span>, was born at Market Drayton, Shropshire, the son of George Felton, clerk in holy orders. He was educated at Manchester grammar school and St John's College, Cambridge (BA 1736; MA 1743). He was ordained at Hereford Cathedral on 11 August 1742 and admitted vicar-choral in 1743. He married, as her first husband, Anna, daughter of the Revd Egerton Leigh, and they had a daughter. Enjoying the patronage of Velters Cornewall MP, he became rector of Moccas in 1744. In 1749 he became rector of Norton Canon, in the gift of the dean and chapter of Hereford.<br>
<br>In 1744 and 1745 Felton served as a steward at the choir festivals at Hereford and Gloucester respectively. A gifted keyboard player, he published sets of concertos for organ or harpsichord in 1744 (dedicated to Velters Cornewall) and 1747, and further sets in 1752, 1755, and 1760. George Frideric Handel subscribed to the first set, though he suggested that a clergyman would be better employed writing sermons than concertos. Charles Burney acknowledged how, in youth, he was inspired both by Felton's concertos and by his performance. An andante with variations from op. 1 no. 3, performed at a subscription concert in Manchester on 23 July 1744, became popular and, supposedly, was played when the Young Pretender, Charles Edward Stuart, fled from Manchester in 1745.<br>
<br>In 1749 Felton revived the Musical Society in Hereford, which, founded in 1723, had ceased activity ten years later because of the decaying state of the college hall. Felton gave the society new life by establishing its meetings in &#145;Frank Woodward's Great Room&#146;. Partly amateur, partly professional, the concerts were so successful that in 1750 the custos (senior vicar) and vicars approved fund-raising for the restoration of the college hall. Entirely rebuilt, it was ready in 1753 for the evening concerts of the triennial festival meeting. Custos Phelps and the vicars expressed their gratitude to Felton for the restoration of their hall, &#145;which has since afforded great accomodation to the College &hellip; and to the general community on numberless public and private occasions&#146;  (Hereford Cathedral Library, MS R. 12. XIV). On the death of Custos Phelps in 1754 Felton's expectation of election to the office was disappointed because, he contested, of irregularities in the conduct of the election. The subsequent dispute, <i>Waring v. Felton</i>, ended with Felton's withdrawal of his case. Out of favour, Felton was given a minor canonry in 1756. On the death of Custos Waring in the summer of 1769, &#145;the Vicars offered the first-fruits of their freedom to Mr. Felton&#146;  (ibid.), and he at last became custos. In the same year he was appointed chaplain to the widowed princess of Wales. In November he was nominated to the vacant benefice of Preston and Blakemere. He died at Hereford on 6 December 1769. He was buried in the lady chapel at Hereford; there is a large stone to his memory in the bishop's cloister with the inscription &#145;Vir animose justus et rerum musicarum peritissimus&#146; (&#145;A just and courageous man, supreme in the art of music&#146;).<br>
