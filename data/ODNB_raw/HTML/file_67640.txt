<span class="headword">Gibbs,  Cecil Armstrong</span>  (1889&#150;1960), <span class="occ">composer</span>, was born at The Vineyards, Great Baddow, near Chelmsford, Essex, on 10 August 1889, the first child of the London businessman David Cecil Gibbs (1850&#150;1912) and his first wife, Ida (1865&#150;1891), daughter of the Revd James Thornely Whitehead, a Unitarian minister. Gibbs's mother died in 1891 after bearing a stillborn second son, and Gibbs was subsequently cared for by his five maiden aunts. He very early showed musical talent but was steered away from a career in music by his father, who inflicted substantial psychological damage on his sensitive son. Gibbs attended the Wick School, Hove (1899&#150;1902), Winchester College (classical scholarship 1902&#150;8), won an exhibition and sizarship for history at Trinity College, Cambridge (BA, 1911), and, his father having died in 1912, gained a MusB in 1913.<br>
<br>After a year teaching at Copthorne School, East Grinstead, and finding himself unable to join the army (he was refused on medical grounds) Gibbs taught classics, history, and English at his old school, the Wick. Adrian Boult funded a year's study at the Royal College of Music (1919&#150;20) where Gibbs studied theory with Charles Wood, score reading and conducting with Boult, and composition with Vaughan Williams, for which he won the Arthur Sullivan prize.<br>
<br>Gibbs taught at the Royal College of Music from 1921 to 1939; he was awarded a doctorate of music (composition) at Cambridge in 1931, and the Cobbett gold medal for chamber music in 1934; and he was vice-chairman of the British Federation of Music Festivals from 1937 to 1952. Gibbs married Honor Mary Mitchell (1892&#150;1958); they had a son, David (1919&#150;1943), and a daughter, Elizabeth (<i>b</i>. 1922). His spiritual home was in Danbury, Essex, where he founded the Danbury Choral Society and conducted it from 1921 to 1960. During the Second World War he temporarily moved his household to Cumberland, where he involved himself thoroughly in the county's musical affairs. In 1951 he chaired the selection committee for the British Federation of Music Societies' national competition festival and he continued to compose, conduct, adjudicate, and find willing publishers for his work until his death of pneumonia on 12 May 1960 in the Chelmsford and Essex Hospital. Gibbs was buried in Danbury churchyard on 16 May.<br>
<br>A large man with considerable public presence, booming voice, red hair, and a temper to match, inside Gibbs was insecure, agoraphobic, and frightened by the increasing speed of the world around him and what he saw as the destructive progress of &#145;science&#146;. A man of contradictions, consumed by fears and mighty joys, his ambition was to produce a top-rate light opera or a magnificent string quartet. He composed many grand works such as the choral symphony <span class="italic">Odysseus</span> (1937&#150;8) and wrote for film and stage, but few of these undertakings exhibit the quality of craftsmanship that is so evident in his some 160 songs. As a miniaturist he excelled; a constant source of inspiration was the poetry of his friend Walter de la Mare, and Gibbs's settings of &#145;Five Eyes&#146; (1917) and &#145;Silver&#146; (1920) have an enduring appeal. Gibbs found especial satisfaction in his music festival work and wrote generously for amateur performers, of whom he was a self-proclaimed champion.<br>
