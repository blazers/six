<span class="headword">Bayley, Sir  Steuart Colvin</span>  (1836&#150;1925), <span class="occ">administrator in India</span>, youngest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1758/', "(William) Butterworth Bayley (1781&#150;1860)")</script> of the Bengal civil service and his wife, Anne Augusta, daughter of William Jackson, registrar of the Calcutta supreme court, was born in London on 26 November 1836. He was educated at Eton College and the East India College, Haileybury, and arrived in India to take up a post in the Bengal civil service in March 1856. On 21 November 1860 he married, at Patna, Anna (<i>d</i>. 1924), daughter of Robert Nesham Farquharson of the Indian Civil Service; they had thirteen children.<br>
<br>Bayley spent most of his career in the provinces of Bengal and Bihar. From 1862 until 1867 he was attached to the secretariat of the government of Bengal, officiating while still relatively junior as chief secretary for short periods in 1865 and again in 1867. In January 1871 he was appointed commissioner of Chittagong and in March 1872 commissioner of Patna. For his efforts in coping with the famine of 1873&#150;4 in that division he was made CSI. In 1877 he accompanied the viceroy, Lord Lytton, on his tour of southern India as his private secretary for famine affairs. Promoted KCSI in 1878, he was appointed in the same year chief commissioner of Assam. In 1881 he was made CIE and transferred to Hyderabad as resident, and in the following year he was appointed home member of the executive council.<br>
<br>In April 1887 Bayley was appointed lieutenant-governor of Bengal. His administration was an unspectacular one in which he concentrated on damping down the racial animosity roused by the controversy over the <span class="roman">Ilbert Bill</span> in 1883&#150;4. He tried in a quiet, uninflammatory way to increase the participation of Indians in low-level public affairs by extending both the system of honorary magistrates and the application of the elective principle in local self-government. He also attempted to facilitate the advancement of Indians in government service, but again in a muted and gradual fashion. He was considered an accessible governor and a hard worker, but by his own admission he had aimed, internally at least, for a &#145;colourless&#146;, calming administration. Discontent on the margins of Bengal was not, however, treated in such a conciliatory fashion and in 1889&#150;90 Bayley sent a punitive expedition to the frontier hill tracts of Chittagong to suppress uprisings and raids by the indigenous peoples there. In December 1890 he resigned as lieutenant-governor, having been appointed political secretary to the India Office. A statue was subsequently erected by the citizens of Calcutta in his memory. In 1895 Bayley became a member of the Council of India. He retired finally from the service in 1905, on the eve of Curzon's partition of Bengal, a radical step which he viewed with considerable misgiving. In 1911 he was promoted GCSI.<br>
<br>Bayley served on the committee of the Athenaeum from 1900 to 1920 and was its chairman for five years. He was also chairman of the Royal Society of Arts from 1906 to 1908. He was a widely read man and an insightful and often humorous literary critic. By inclination a conservative, he was nevertheless realist enough to appreciate the growth of nationalist sentiment in India and to try to accommodate it, albeit in a limited and cautious way. He died at his home at 2 Cathcart Road, Kensington, London, on 3 June 1925 and was buried in Brompton cemetery. His wife had predeceased him, after sixty-four years of marriage, by only six months.<br>
