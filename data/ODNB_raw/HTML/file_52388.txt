<span class="headword">Sheavyn,  Phoebe Ann Beale</span>  (1865&#150;1968), <span class="occ">literary scholar and feminist</span>, was born on 16 September 1865 in Long Street, Atherstone, Warwickshire. Her birth was registered nearly six weeks later by her mother, Jane Elizabeth Sheavyn, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Farmer. Her father, William Sale Sheavyn, was a draper in Long Street and the family lived over the shop. As happens in folklore, a younger child was in the end the luckiest. In old age Phoebe (who was the fifth of eight children) would affirm angrily that the early death of an elder sister was due to the conditions she had suffered as a living-in assistant at another draper's shop.<br>
<br>Phoebe was to be a school teacher. After a male inspector had examined her needlework through a magnifying glass she was set on the lowest rung of the pedagogical ladder, as an uncertificated teacher in a board school. Soon she failed to satisfy another inspector: she was thrown out, to make what living she could, at first exploited in a series of private schools. At last she found a post as governess to the children of an architect. Noticing her talent for drawing, he gave her lessons and advised her how to sit for the Cambridge local examinations. A scholarship to the University College of Aberystwyth followed. At the age of twenty-four she had a London BA and was teaching English in Haberdashers' Aske's School for Girls, Hatcham, where she remained from 1889 to 1892, when she returned to Aberystwyth to study for an MA degree in English and French, which she obtained in 1894. She then crossed the Atlantic to become a fellow and reader in English at Bryn Mawr College, Pennsylvania, in 1894, returning to England in 1896. She briefly held a post in Oxford working with the philologist Joseph Wright on the <span class="italic">English Dialect Dictionary</span> before being appointed in 1897 as the first resident tutor in English at Somerville College, Oxford.<br>
<br>Miss Maitland, then principal of Somerville, had seen the necessity to appoint a body of resident women tutors in order to change Somerville from a hall of residence into a college. In appointing Phoebe Sheavyn the college for the first time ventured outside Oxford or Cambridge. Phoebe admitted in later life that she had been &#145;prickly&#146; at Oxford. At Aberystwyth she had learned that women could not only sit beside men as students but could also teach men. In the USA she had seen the generous provision for women's education. The position of women at Oxford dismayed her. There was compensation in the daily companionship of young, brilliant, forward-looking women, some of whom became lifelong friends. In 1905&#150;6 she took a year's sabbatical leave to complete the thesis, for which she gained a London University DLitt degree in 1906, which was the basis for her book <span class="italic">The Literary Profession in the Elizabethan Age</span>, published by Manchester University Press in 1909.<br>
<br>Miss Sheavyn stayed at Oxford for ten years before moving, in 1907, into the bracing academic air of Manchester University as university lecturer, tutor to women students, and warden of Ashburne Hall, the hall of residence for women students, opened by Miss Penrose, principal of Somerville. A few months before Phoebe arrived, a group of seventeen women had met in Manchester to form the Federation of University Women. By 1909 the federation was ready to widen its field: a conference was held in Manchester for delegates from universities and colleges in England and Wales. The two Manchester delegates were Ida Smedley DSc, the virtual founder, and Phoebe Sheavyn. When in 1922 the federation became international, Sheavyn was again a delegate to a conference in Paris. In the same year she produced a pamphlet for the International Federation of University Women (since reorganized in the UK as the British Federation of Women Graduates). After a rather sketchy history of women's education, she surveyed the educational provision and the career opportunities open to girls and women in 1922. Sheavyn regretted that the apparent opening of spheres of work for women in the 1914&#150;18 war had not proved permanent. She also observed that the recognition given to women as wardens of university hostels was &#145;not always entirely satisfactory&#146;  (P. Sheavyn, <span class="italic">Higher Education for Women in Great Britain</span>, 1922, 17), and reflected that the position of women university teachers was one of &#145;comparative subordination&#146;.<br>
<br>Phoebe Sheavyn had already, in April 1917, resigned her wardenship, though she remained tutor to women students. Although illness played a part in her decision not to continue in both posts, there was also an element of frustration at the obstacles to improving the position of women in the university. The promoters of Ashburne Hall had hoped that it would become a college but it had remained a hall of residence. Sheavyn had been made a member of the university senate in 1912 &#145;for administrative reasons&#146;  (Tylecote, 97): this position was not offered to her successor. Some feared that the fierceness of her feminism would not in the end benefit women  (ibid., 139), though it was admitted that she had charm, and her Somerville friend Margery Fry spoke of her &#145;endless kindness&#146;. In a paper, &#145;Professional women&#146;, which she contributed to a collection entitled <span class="italic">The Position of Woman: Actual and Real</span> (1911), Sheavyn argued the case for utilizing women's capacities in all areas of professional employment, and suggested the creation of residential halls where &#145;disengaged&#146; women (those without maternal responsibilities) could live together independently.<br>
<br>In 1925 Phoebe Sheavyn entered on what proved to be more than forty years of retirement. How she occupied this is something of a mystery. Margery Fry equipped her for oil painting and handed on techniques she had learned from her brother Roger. In her seventies Phoebe was exhibiting and selling landscapes and flower pieces. In later old age Margery introduced her to the new game of Scrabble. When Margery was in hospital in London in 1957, Phoebe, then ninety-two and nine years Margery's senior, was able to visit her. At that time Phoebe expressed something of her religious belief: she had never had a religious &#145;experience&#146; but was convinced that her being &#145;did not need her body&#146;. She could not, however, believe that old friends would meet again.<br>
<br>The great event of Phoebe's old age was the republication of her book by Manchester University Press in 1967. As its sensitive editor, J. S. Saunders, pointed out, she had, by excluding controversial writers, excluded the true professionals, the best-sellers of the Elizabethan age; but her book had been in 1909 one of the earliest works of contextual literary study. Phoebe Sheavyn's meticulous scholarship had not been superseded and her forthright, simple style was still readable. She herself conducted the correspondence about the publication. The proofs came to her in her retirement home, Bryony House, Selly Oak, Birmingham. She died there a few months after the publication, on 7 January 1968, in her 103rd year.<br>
