<span class="headword">O'Brien,  William</span>, second earl of Inchiquin  (<em>c.</em>1640&#150;1692), <span class="occ">colonial governor</span>, was the son of the soldier <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20463/', "Murrough O'Brien, known as Murchadh na dT&#243;ite&#225;n (&#145;Murrough of the Burnings&#146;), first earl of Inchiquin (c.1614&#150;1674)")</script>, and his wife, Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1685), daughter of Sir William St Leger, president of Munster. Brought up in London at the house of Sir Philip Percival, his father's friend, he was a companion to his guardian's son, afterwards Sir John Percival. In 1648 he was briefly confined in the Tower of London following his father's change of allegiance to the royalists and seizure of Lord Broghill's children as hostages. In 1658 Henry Cromwell reported that O'Brien had come to him in Ireland without pass or permission.<br>
<br>O'Brien's early manhood was spent with his father in the service of France, especially in Catalonia. In February 1660 he accompanied his father on his way to Lisbon with a French force intended to assist the Portuguese against Spain. Near Lisbon, their vessel was boarded by an Algerian corsair. In the fight that ensued he lost an eye by a shot, and with his father was brought prisoner to Algiers. At the request of Lady Inchiquin the English council of state sought their release. The earl at once returned to England, but his son remained a hostage until the following year when he was freed on payment of a hefty ransom. O'Brien married first, in December 1665, Lady Margaret (<i>d</i>. 1683), third daughter of Roger Boyle, first earl of Orrery, who bore him four children: William (1666&#150;1719), his successor, Henry (<i>d</i>. in infancy), James (<i>d</i>. 1693), and Margaret. His wife was a lady-in-waiting to Mary of Orange at The Hague in 1680, but died in December 1683 and was buried in London. His second wife was Elizabeth (1651&#150;1718), widow of the third Baron Herbert of Cherbury and a daughter and coheir of George Bryges, sixth Baron Chandos, but there were no children of this marriage.<br>
<br>O'Brien was appointed a member of the Irish privy council in 1671. In 1674 he was appointed governor and vice-admiral of Tangier and became colonel of the 2nd Tangier regiment of foot. However, in the clashes with the Moors he displayed little military capability, and in 1675 he was responsible for rashly committing part of the garrison to a cattle raid which cost 150 casualties. Thereafter he was frequently absent in England. In 1680, having failed to prevent the outer fortifications of Tangier from being overrun, he was recalled under something of a cloud, but mollified Charles II with a gift of a pair of ostriches. In 1674, on the death of his father, he succeeded to the earldom of Inchiquin and inherited an immense estate of 60,000 acres in Munster. This included the family home of Rostellan Castle overlooking Cork harbour, where he resided after his return from Tangier. Although his estate was valued at &pound;2500 per annum, he appears to have been in considerable debt, and unsuccessfully attempted to push his eldest son into marriage with the daughter of a wealthy London merchant who was prepared to pay a large dowry.<br>
<br>Inchiquin was omitted from the Irish privy council after the accession of James II in 1685. At the revolution of 1688 he took the side of William and Mary, and early in 1689, with his Boyle relatives, played a leading role in the armed resistance of the Munster protestants to Tyrconnell's Jacobite regime in Ireland. General Justin MacCarthy suppressed the Munster Williamites, but allowed Inchiquin to leave Cork for England with a considerable sum of money. This was against King James's wishes, but MacCarthy may have been influenced by the fact that his father, Lord Muskerry, and Inchiquin's father had been old comrades in arms. Soon afterwards Inchiquin and his eldest son were among the several thousand protestants attainted by James II's Irish parliament. In London he offered his services to William, and in September 1689 he was appointed governor and vice-admiral of Jamaica, where, accompanied by his wife and younger son, he landed on 31 May 1690. His salary was &pound;2000 per annum.<br>
<br>The nineteen months of Inchiquin's personal rule that followed were beset by difficulties, which he struggled to overcome. He re-established the law courts which had not functioned for two years and suppressed a revolt by 500 slaves on one of the inland plantations. Concerned that Jamaica would be prey to French attack, he asked for warships from England and in the meantime fitted out five sloops and a captured vessel to counter growing French strength on neighbouring Hispaniola. The treasury was empty, and he was soon at loggerheads with the &#145;turbulent and pernicious advisers&#146; who formed the executive council  (<span class="italic">CSP col.</span>, 13.295). In August 1691 he angrily dissolved the island's assembly after a six-week session, following clashes over what he claimed were its attempts to undermine his authority and deprive him of revenue. His proposal for a land tax was rejected, and he refused to countenance a tax on the lucrative slave trade which the assembly put forward as an alternative. It was afterwards alleged that Inchiquin benefited personally from the trade, amassing as much as &pound;15,000 during his time in Jamaica. His health deteriorated, and he sought leave to return to England. But on 16 January 1692, &#145;after a long indisposition through fever and ague which ended in a flux&#146;, he died at Santiago de la Vega, Jamaica, where he was buried the same day in the parish church  (ibid., 597).<br>
