<span class="headword">Pelham,  Henry</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1597, <em>d.</em> in or after 1660), <span class="occ">lawyer and politician</span>, was baptized on 9 June 1597, the third son of Sir William Pelham (1567&#150;1629) of Brocklesby, Lincolnshire, and Anne, daughter of Charles Willoughby, second Baron Willoughby of Parham. Pelham's family was a cadet branch of the Pelhams of Laughton, Sussex. His grandfather <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21800/', "Sir William Pelham (d. 1587)")</script> acquired a substantial estate in Lincolnshire, establishing his principal residence at Brocklesby, near Great Grimsby. By 1597, when Pelham's father was elected MP for Lincolnshire, the Brocklesby Pelhams were one of the county's leading families. Pelham was admitted to Trinity College, Cambridge, in Easter term 1615, and to Gray's Inn on 6 November 1616, and although never called to the bar became a lawyer of some renown. His failure to become a barrister was probably linked to his decision in 1620, while reading for the bar, to accompany his kinsman <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6120/', "Sir Edward Conway")</script> on his diplomatic mission to the continent. He was still abroad when he was returned for Great Grimsby to the parliament of 1621. Pelham represented Grimsby in the four succeeding parliaments, although it was only in that of 1628&#150;9 that he made any appreciable impact, speaking in support of establishing parliamentary control of taxation before granting supply. His contribution to a debate on religion in May 1628, in which he urged that the only test of clerical conformity should be the articles prescribed in the Elizabethan act of 1571, suggests that he favoured a latitudinarian protestant church, and that he may have sympathized with the plight of puritan ministers who had fallen foul of the church authorities. His kinswoman the godly <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/12334/', "Lady Brilliana Harley")</script>, whose sister Frances married Pelham's brother, was cautiously approving of Henry's piety, finding him &#145;to savour more of religion than his brother Herbert&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters</span>, 114).<br>
<br>Pelham seems never to have married&#151;reports that he wedded a daughter of Sir Thomas Pelham of Laughton are probably erroneous&#151;devoting himself entirely to his legal career. Before the civil war he apparently divided his time between his chambers at Gray's Inn and a residence at or near Belvoir Castle, the seat of his kinsman George Manners, seventh earl of Rutland. Pelham was legal adviser to Rutland, who secured his appointment as deputy recorder of the nearby borough of Grantham. Pelham was also legal or business agent for his friend and second cousin Sir Thomas Pelham, and for the Lincolnshire peers Robert Bertie, earl of Lindsey, and (Pelham's first cousin) <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29597/', "Francis Willoughby, fifth Baron Willoughby of Parham")</script>. In the elections to the Short Parliament in 1640 he was returned for Grantham on Rutland's interest. His most revealing contribution in debate was on 24 April, when he supported the godly Lincolnshire knight Sir Edward Ayscoghe in his unsuccessful attempt to unseat his rival for one of the county seats, the future royalist Sir Edward Hussey. Pelham was returned for Grantham again in the autumn, and although one of Lincolnshire's most active MPs, the failure of the clerk of the Commons to distinguish between Pelham and his second cousin <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/37842/', "Peregrine Pelham")</script> makes it difficult to form a precise picture of his career in the Long Parliament. But given his parliamentary experience and legal expertise it seems likely that the majority of references to &#145;Mr Pelham&#146; in the <span class="italic">Journals</span> and parliamentary diaries relate to him, particularly during the early 1640s. He clearly supported the Long Parliament's attack upon the ecclesiastical policies of Archbishop William Laud. When the impeachment of the bishops was debated on 8 August 1641, he declared that they had acted against the royal prerogative, the rights of parliament, and in manner &#145;tending to sedition&#146;, and were thus guilty of treason  (BL, Harley MS 479, fol. 133<i>v</i>). A month later, after the Westminster godly had suffered several set-backs in their efforts to purge the church of its &#145;popish&#146; accretions, Pelham reported that the Laudian bishop of Ely and dean of Peterborough had made a triumphalist return to their counties &#145;as if now all hope of reformation in the church were past&#146;  (BL, Harley MS 164, fol. 99). In 1644 he was one of the Commons' lawyers appointed to marshal the evidence against Laud at the archbishop's trial. Pelham's committee appointments suggest that he was also keen to reform the civil &#145;abuses&#146; of Charles I's personal rule; in debate he argued that those judges who had supported the imposition of ship money on inland counties were guilty of high treason.<br>
<br>Pelham remained at Westminster during the summer of 1642, pledging &pound;100 in June for the defence of parliament. In September he declared his willingness to assist Robert Devereux, third earl of Essex, with his life and fortune. From the autumn of 1642 he was named to a string of committees for advancing and regulating the parliamentarian war effort, and was rewarded in December with the recordership of Lincoln following parliament's removal of the previous &#145;ill-affected&#146; incumbent. His most important appointment during the first year of the civil war was his addition, probably on 2 June 1643, to the committee for sequestrations. Pelham emerged as a leading member of this committee and, according to one (hostile) commentator, he &#145;did usually for fees (or rather bribes) advise and assist delinquents in getting off their sequestrations; he drew their petitions and countenanced their causes for his own private lucre and advantage&#146;  (Wilbee, 4). He was also a key figure on the eastern association committee, and was active in promoting a godly preaching ministry within the association&#151;and indeed nationally, if his committee appointments are any guide.<br>
<br>Pelham's factional alignment at Westminster, if he had one, is impossible to determine until the summer of 1647. In the wake of the presbyterian &#145;coup&#146; of 26 July, and with William Lenthall and many political Independents of both houses having fled to the army, Pelham was chosen speaker of the Commons on 30 July. The next day he and the new speaker for the Lords, Lord John Hunsdon, signed letters to Sir Thomas Fairfax advising him of parliament's decision to invite the king to London for a personal treaty, and warning the army not to advance any nearer to the capital. Fairfax ignored this warning, and on 6 August the army entered London and restored Lenthall and the other fugitive members to their places. No reprisals were taken against Pelham for his part in the July coup, and he remained aligned with the presbyterians in desiring a settlement with the king. Thus on 6 November 1647 he was a teller with the political presbyterian Sir Walter Erle against including a clause in the Hampton Court peace propositions that the king was duty-bound to assent to parliament's terms. Most of Pelham's appointments in 1648 were of an unexceptional, non-partisan nature. However, his nomination to the 27 October committee for converting those of the Newport peace propositions to which the king had assented into bills suggests that he remained committed to a negotiated settlement with Charles. Pelham's acceptance of the speakership during Lenthall's absence in 1647 had evidently left him a marked man in the eyes of the army, and at Pride's Purge he was among those members who were arrested and held in custody. Fortunately for Pelham he was on close terms with the influential Sir Thomas Widdrington (a fellow Gray's Inn lawyer), who managed to secure his release on parole on 9 December.<br>
<br>Thereafter Pelham withdrew from public life, spending most of his time either at Gray's Inn or at Hollingbourne, Kent, where he had purchased an estate. His only known appointments after 1648 were to successive Lincolnshire sewers commissions during the 1650s. Following the readmission of the secluded members on 22 February 1660 he was listed among those who had returned to the house, but there is no evidence that he resumed his seat. Pelham disappears into obscurity after the Restoration, and his date of death and place of burial remain unknown.<br>
