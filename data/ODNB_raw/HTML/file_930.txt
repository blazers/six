<span class="headword">Aylesbury,  Thomas</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1597, <em>d.</em> 1660/61), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and religious writer</span>, was baptized at St Martin's, Birmingham, on 17 July 1597, the eldest of eight children of William Aylesbury (<i>d</i>. in or after 1641) and his wife, Dorothy Walton (<i>bap</i>. 1570, <i>d</i>. in or after 1611). He was educated at King Edward's School, Birmingham, before matriculating as a pensioner in the Easter term of 1613 from Christ's College, Cambridge. Having graduated BA early in 1616, from 4 May 1618 he was vicar of Curdworth, Warwickshire. He probably proceeded MA the following year, and was incorporated MA at Oxford in July 1622.<br>
<br>By this time Aylesbury had gained important patrons. His <span class="italic">A Sermon Preached at Paules-Crosse</span> (1623), delivered on 2 June 1622, was dedicated to John Williams, bishop of Lincoln, and to &#145;my most worthy friend&#146;. He was chosen to act as secretary to the conference held at Sir Humphrey Lynde's house on 27 June 1623 between the Jesuits led by John Fisher and the Church of England clergymen Daniel Featley and Francis White. His own anti-Catholicism was evident in <span class="italic">Paganisme and Papisme Parallel'd</span> (1624), an All Saints' day sermon delivered at the Temple Church in 1623 and dedicated to Henry Wriothesley, earl of Southampton. Critical alike of Roman Catholic eucharistic theology and of the separatist followers of men such as Robert Browne, Aylesbury affirmed in near Arminian tone in <span class="italic">Christus redivivus</span> (1624) that &#145;God tenders grace to all, if men joyne but to make it efficacious&#146;  (p. 17).<br>
<br>In June 1625 Aylesbury became rector of Berwick St Leonard, Wiltshire, although he was in London to deliver <span class="italic">The Passion Sermon at Pauls Crosse</span> (1626) on Good Friday, 1626. That year he proceeded BD. In 1631 he was granted the prebend of Horningsham and Tytherington in the diocese of Salisbury. By licence dated 11 September 1635 he married Joan Nosse or Moss, &#145;aged twenty-two&#146;, from Maiden Bradley. By 21 October 1639, when he wrote to Robert Long to ask him to insert fresh references in the text, Aylesbury had effectively completed his <span class="italic">A Treatise of the Confession of Sinne</span>, although it was not published until 1657. While denouncing the abuses associated with confession in the Catholic church, the work seeks to restore to its former integrity the practice of penitential confession, affirming the ministry of reconciliation, in confession and absolution, as integral to the role of a priest or minister.<br>
<br>In 1643 Aylesbury became rector of Kingston Deverill, Wiltshire; the combined value of his livings was about &pound;200 or &pound;300 a year, according to his son Thomas. In 1645 soldiers intruded on his conduct of a service at Horningsham and cut the prayer book to pieces with their swords. Aylesbury's conservative and royalist sympathies led to his involvement with the &#145;clubmen&#146;, a powerful, overtly neutralist movement in Somerset, Dorset, and Wiltshire. Despite his promises made before the county committee on 3 June 1645, witnesses related that on 25 July at Mere Beacon, Wiltshire, Aylesbury preached paralleling the rebellion of parliament with that of Absalom, and defending the use of the <span class="roman">Book of Common Prayer</span>. Taken to London, deprived of his livings, and imprisoned for some time, he eventually retired to a small property at Cloford, Somerset, worth less than &pound;12 a year according to John Walker. There he, his wife, and eight children depended on the generosity of Sir George Horner and others. Their patronage allowed him to become vicar of Castle Cary in 1650. Two years after the anonymous publication of <span class="italic">A Treatise of the Confession of Sinne</span>, there appeared Aylesbury's <span class="italic">Diatribi de aeterno divini beneplaciti</span> (1659), dedicated by a &#145;presbytero Anglo&#146; to his &#145;most holy mother Church&#146;. It characterized John Calvin as &#145;too precise and rigid&#146;  (p. 87) and, writing of confession, esteemed them &#145;poor Reformers, that shall weed up both tares and wheat together&#146;  (p. 112). His own annotations in a volume of Latin manuscript meditations on the life of Christ (Bodl. Oxf., MS Univ. 18), including &#145;Ave Maria, gratia plena&#146;, hint at his devotional life.<br>
<br>In poor health when his livings were restored to him in June 1660, Aylesbury died before 29 January 1661. His wife was still living in 1672. Of their sons, at least three survived to adulthood. Thomas (1647&#150;1725) became rector of Corsley, Wiltshire, while William (<i>c</i>.1640&#150;1698), already in 1672 the subject of court depositions on his scandalous behaviour, was ejected from his living of East Pennard, Somerset, in 1681.<br>
