<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Yorke,  Francis Reginald Stevens</span> <span class="st"> [Kay, K]</span>  (1906&#150;1962), <span class="occ">architect</span>, was born at 38 West Street, Stratford upon Avon, on 3 December 1906, the only son of Francis Walter Bagnall Yorke (1879&#150;1957) and his wife, Mary Ann Stevens. After attending Chipping Campden School, Yorke followed his father into the architectural profession and entered the Birmingham School of Architecture, where he completed his course in 1930. Among his fellow students were several other remarkable men, including Frederick Gibberd, Colin Penn, Richard Sheppard, and Robert Furneaux Jordan, at a time when awareness of modern architecture was beginning in England. He completed some agricultural workers' cottages at Webheath, near his home town of Redditch, Worcestershire, in a simple vernacular style, in 1930. That same year, on 13 September, he married Thelma Austin Jones (<i>b</i>. 1906/7), a fashion model; they had twin daughters. Although the couple never formally separated, it was an unhappy marriage because of Yorke's tendency to have simultaneous affairs with several women, often members of his office staff, during the week, while his wife took to drink and lived in the country. Her sister Margaret married Yorke's architectural assistant (and later partner) T. Randall Evans, who came from New Zealand.<br>
<br>Known as Kay or K, Yorke was able to attract and often inspire people of talent, and the warmth and charm of his personality endeared him to a huge circle of friends. A great beer drinker, he looked and dressed like a gentleman farmer, which he became when after the Second World War he kept and bred his own herd of dairy cattle. He had a powerful, chunky frame, a countryman's clear, ruddy skin, and mischievous, puckered eyes, attractive to men and women alike.<br>
<br>After entering the profession at a time of severe economic depression, Yorke set up practice in London about 1930 but concentrated on architectural journalism as a contributor to the <span class="italic">Architects' Journal</span> on technical matters and building products, travelling abroad and establishing contacts with European modernists, particularly in Czechoslovakia and Germany. These contacts were the basis for his book <span class="italic">The Modern House</span>, published by the Architectural Press in 1934 and reprinted several times. It is a well-informed international survey, in photographs and drawings, of the flat-roofed houses which were just beginning to be built in England, although the text is almost entirely technical in content. It includes the designs for Yorke's first significant modern building, the small concrete house Torilla at Nast Hyde, Hertfordshire (1934&#150;5). In other similar projects Yorke showed a matter-of-fact attitude to modernism. His partnership with the Hungarian-born architect Marcel Breuer, from 1935 to 1937, was formed partly to enable Breuer to practise in Britain as a refugee from Nazism. Projects were undertaken separately within the partnership, and a house in Sea Lane, Angmering, Sussex (1936), is one of several works attributable to Breuer. They worked together on a project for a &#145;city of the future&#146;, exhibited as a model at the Ideal Home Exhibition in 1936. Other clients included Eton College and Flower's Brewery of Stratford upon Avon, for whom Yorke, in collaboration with his father, designed a terrace of workers' cottages in Birmingham Road. These humble buildings, with walls of brick rather than concrete, and monopitch roofs, were more significant for Yorke's future direction than Torilla (for which he is better known), and indicative of a growing maturity in English modernism. In 1937 Yorke published <span class="italic">The Modern House in England</span>, similar in style to his earlier book, and prefaced by a long quotation from the arts and crafts architect W. R. Lethaby. He collaborated with Frederick Gibberd on <span class="italic">The Modern Flat</span> (1937) and with Colin Penn on <span class="italic">A Key to Modern Architecture</span> (1939). From 1935 he used his technical and organizational knowledge to edit the annual publication <span class="italic">Specification</span>, which listed building products.<br>
<br>Yorke spent the early part of the war in a team of architects building factories and hostels for the Ministry of Supply. Later he became a researcher for the Ministry of Works on technical matters, and became interested in models for prefabricated housing. In 1944 he proposed an architectural partnership (initially without any formal terms of agreement) with <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/101021/', "Eugene Rosenberg")</script>, a Czech Jewish refugee whom Yorke had helped after his arrival in Britain. They invited <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/55126/', "Cyril Sj&#246;str&#246;m (later Mardall) (1909&#150;1994)")</script>, an Anglo-Finnish architect with a specialism in prefabrication in timber, to join the practice. The Yorke, Rosenberg, and Mardall partnership was established in the years following the end of the war, and its first significant buildings were completed in 1947. Each partner tended to take charge of particular projects, but there was an intention to achieve a consistency of outlook, with emphasis on efficient production and use of new building products for industrial and transport buildings, hospitals, housing, and educational buildings, mostly in the public sector. All three partners shared an interest in contemporary art and gave commissions through their building projects to Henry Moore (the implementation of the <span class="italic">Family Group</span> at Barclay School, Stevenage, 1950), William Scott, F. E. McWilliam, Kenneth Rowntree, Michael Rothenstein, and Louis Le Brocquy. Yorke encouraged the designer and art teacher Peggy Angus to produce designs for repeating patterns on tiles, made by Carters of Poole. These he used effectively in school buildings, such as the Susan Lawrence School which formed part of the Lansbury Estate, Poplar, as a showpiece of &#145;live architecture&#146; in the 1951 Festival of Britain.<br>
<br>Virtually all Yorke's school buildings up to 1956 used the prefabricated system developed by Hills of West Bromwich, often enlivened with blank end-walls of rough local stone. In such blends of industrial methods and good natural materials Yorke reunited his arts and crafts home background (the family home at Redditch was said to be redolent of William Morris) with his commitment to modernism. In designing the Ladyshot housing area in Harlow New Town (1951&#150;5) Yorke virtually repeated his pre-war terrace at Stratford. His approach to design often seemed casual. He did not spend much time in the office, and delegated almost everything to office staff&#151;recruiting some talented young designers, who before long began to rebel against the lack of new ideas. Yorke was ready to encourage them, however, and the commission for Gatwick airport (1955&#150;8) became an important moment of transition. David Allford and Brian Henderson were responsible, under Yorke, for designing the terminal, with its glass walling, marble floor, and crisp detailing, integrating road and rail transport links. Gatwick showed English modern architecture catching up again with international standards, now dominated by America, but the building has now been so altered that this is difficult to appreciate.<br>
<br>Yorke designated Allford, Henderson, and Randall Evans as partners before his early death. In his last years he was personally involved in designing new offices for the firm at 1 Greystoke Place, London, completed in 1961, a cool infill building clad in white tiles beside a historic graveyard near Chancery Lane, with a rooftop penthouse flat to house his art collection and the rosettes won by his prize cattle and as a setting for office parties, from which wives were always excluded. Shortly after being appointed CBE he died of cancer of the throat on 10 June 1962 at St Thomas's Hospital, London, which his firm largely rebuilt during the next decade.<br>
