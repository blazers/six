<span class="headword">Gill,  Alfred Henry</span>  (1856&#150;1914), <span class="occ">trade union leader and politician</span>, was born on 3 December 1856 at 36 Oldham Road, Rochdale, the son of John Gill, a cotton spinner, and his wife, Mary Stott. He received an elementary education, curtailed from the age of ten when he was employed as a half-timer in a local cotton mill; full-time work began at thirteen. On 4 January 1876 he married Sarah Ellen (<i>b</i>. 1855/6), daughter of John Greenwood of Rochdale, painter. In 1879 he moved to Oldham, still as a cotton operative, and in 1887 to Pendlebury to take up a better position.<br>
<br>Gill's upbringing imbued him with a desire for self-improvement. He was raised as, and remained a Wesleyan Methodist. He joined the Band of Hope at the age of twelve, and stayed true to its temperance principles; he took part in the co-operative movement, becoming chairman of his local society; and in 1896, after attending evening classes in scientific and technical subjects, he was appointed assistant secretary of the Bolton and District Operative Spinners' Association. Eight months later he progressed to the post of secretary, which he held for the remainder of his life. As a full-time trade union official, Gill was known for his mastery of the complicated system of wage rates then operating in cotton mills, and for a conciliatory approach to industrial relations. His moderation made him acceptable as a member of the Bolton magistrates' bench, to which he was appointed in 1899, and as a representative on a number of other local bodies.<br>
<br>The Amalgamated Association of Operative Cotton Spinners, in which the Bolton district was prominent, sent Gill as one of its two delegates to the founding conference of the Labour Representation Committee in 1900. The long-established unions in the cotton industry occupied an influential, somewhat cautious, position within the labour movement, but the election of David Shackleton as a member of parliament in 1902 gave the impetus to independent political activity among the leaders of Lancashire's textile workers. Gill was already a member of the committee of the United Textile Factory Workers' Association (UTFWA), one purpose of which was to lobby on political issues of concern to the various trade unions in the textile industry. When in 1903 the UTFWA affiliated to the Labour Representation Committee it became the largest body in that organization. Gill was adopted in 1903 as a parliamentary candidate, sponsored by the textile workers, for the Bolton constituency, which returned two MPs and came within the pact made by Herbert Gladstone and Ramsay MacDonald to ensure electoral co-operation. At the general election of 1906 Gill and the Liberal George Harwood were returned. A similar arrangement ensured his success in the general elections of 1910.<br>
<br>In parliament, like other Labour MPs from the trade union wing of the party, he maintained a role in the affairs of his union. In 1903 he had been elected as one of the thirteen members of the parliamentary committee of the Trades Union Congress, a term of office that continued until 1907 when he presided over the congress of the TUC held that year in Bath. He again sat on the TUC's parliamentary committee in 1913&#150;14. In the House of Commons he called for better ventilation of factories, a more efficient system of inspection, and measures to reduce accidents. He made the practice of &#145;time-cribbing&#146;, by which employers added on a few minutes to the working day, the subject of regular questions. He was especially concerned to improve workmen's compensation, and it was on this issue that he spoke for the last time in the House of Commons, on 20 May 1914.<br>
<br>Gill suffered a heart attack in June 1913, and although he recovered sufficiently to resume his parliamentary duties, he never regained full health. He died on 27 August 1914 at his home, 61 Hampden Street, Bolton. After a funeral service at Halliwell Road Wesleyan Church, Bolton, on 31 August, he was buried in the nonconformist section of Heaton cemetery. He was survived by his wife and by a son and four daughters.<br>
