<span class="headword">Vittels <span class="st"> [Vitell]</span>,  Christopher</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1543&#150;1579), <span class="occ">religious separatist leader</span>, was thought by John Rogers, a later adversary, to have originated in Delft, Netherlands, where he was in 1543. At some point he joined the Family of Love, a mystical religious fellowship founded in Amsterdam and Emden by &#145;H. N.&#146; (Hendrick Niclaes) during the 1540s. He was resident in Southwark, London, as early as 1551, and his wife, of whom nothing is known, was still living there in 1579. He was a joiner by trade, though he is also listed in one source as a merchant who operated between England and the Low Countries. He was an elusive and charismatic figure, capable of remaining almost invisible to his enemies while generating and sustaining an enthusiastic English following. The sources available to the biographer are usually hostile in tone. <br>
<br>During the middle decades of the century Vittels belonged to the radical religious underworld. His theology appears, at this stage, to have been loosely defined, but it included the following beliefs: that the true godly did not sin; that infant baptism was invalid; that the pope was not Antichrist; and, last, that God and Christ were not equal. He also believed that spiritual dissenters could, with a clear conscience, attend officially prescribed church services of which they disapproved. Vittels participated in a heated debate on some of these points at a Colchester tavern in 1555. A witness later recalled that Vittels had, on this occasion, also spoken of his intention to promote &#145;the doctrine of a man, who lived &hellip; beyond the seas an holy life and an upright conversation&#146;  (Wilkinson, fols. 3<i>v</i>&#150;A1<i>r</i>). This was presumably a reference to Niclaes, whose teachings came to dominate the remainder of Vittels's shadowy life. Although in 1559 his opinions on the inequality of God and Christ led him to be called before the bishop of London, Edmund Grindal, at Paul's Cross, and to a possible public recantation, he was not silenced. <br>
<br>During the 1560s and 1570s Vittels emerged as the leading member in England of Niclaes's sect, travelling the country and building a dedicated and secretive discipleship for Niclaes that may have extended to a thousand men and women. In 1574&#150;5 Vittels put his bilingual skills to use in an ambitious scheme to translate, reprint, and distribute the works of his mentor. Eighteen of these were printed in Cologne, bearing titles such as <span class="italic">Terra pacis</span>, <span class="italic">Evangelium regni</span>, and <span class="italic">The prophetie of the spirit of love</span>. The books were soon on their way to England in an operation that Vittels almost certainly masterminded. It was at this point, not surprisingly, that members of the Family of Love began to attract hostile attention from English magistrates and authors. The group's devotion to a foreign, self-proclaimed messiah with an allegorical attitude to scripture caused considerable anxiety in England. Niclaes taught that individuals who committed themselves to him could become &#145;godded with god&#146;, or inwardly transformed to the point at which their sins ceased or became meaningless. Between 1574 and 1580, a number of &#145;confessions&#146; were extracted from Familists in Cambridgeshire, the Isle of Ely, and Devon, and at the court of Elizabeth I. Vittels proved typically slippery during these years, and does not seem to have been captured or examined. <br>
<br>The first known reference to Vittels in print appeared in Stephen Batman's <span class="italic">The golden booke of the leaden goddes</span> (1577), where he was described uncharitably as &#145;one altogether unlearned, savinge that he is somwhat erroniously, Bewitched&#146;. This was merely a foretaste of the invective that Vittels was to encounter in 1578&#150;9. John Rogers, about whom very little is known, was a particularly animated adversary, and deeply frustrated by Vittels's activities:<blockquote>What travell he hath taken, howe he hath trudged from countrie to countrie, and howe he will not once move his speech, if any learned or godly persons, that hath any true knowledge of the worde be present, is very wel known: but among the simple he is peerelesse, and in deede, the oldest Elder of our English Familie, amongst whome he hath his maintenance. (Rogers, <span class="italic">The Displaying</span>, fol. D3<i>r</i>&#150;<i>v</i>)</blockquote>Other prominent anti-familists included two Cambridge graduates, William Wilkinson, who later became chancellor of the diocese of Salisbury, and John Knewstub, a prominent puritan who was minister of Cockfield, Suffolk, in 1579. <br>
<br>Rogers, Wilkinson, and Knewstub led the assault on the Family of Love in these years. The fellowship became the subject of privy council discussions, parliamentary debates, several books, and a royal proclamation. Still Vittels remained at large, and secretly delivered to Rogers a robust written defence of his beliefs and behaviour. Rogers printed it, with his own angry responses, in <span class="italic">An answere unto a wicked and infamous libel</span> (1579). Pressure upon the Family was maintained into 1581, when it somewhat mysteriously eased. It appears that members of the Family at court successfully convinced some of the highest authorities that the danger was not as serious as had been suggested. By this date Vittels, who had evaded his enemies even when they were in the ascendancy, had disappeared and becomes virtually untraceable.<br>
