<span class="headword">Fergus</span>, lord of Galloway  (<em>d.</em> 1161), <span class="occ">prince</span>, has been described variously as king, kinglet, prince, or lord of Galloway. He was of unknown ancestry, but was probably descended from a native dynasty of south-west Scotland. When first recorded, at the consecration of Glasgow Cathedral in 1136, Fergus was accompanied by Uhtred (<i>d</i>. 1174), the son of his marriage (datable to <i>c</i>.1120) to an unnamed illegitimate daughter of Henry I of England. From the same marriage he had a daughter, Affreca, whom he married to Olaf Godredsson (<i>d</i>. 1153), king of Man. Fergus's second recorded son, Gilbert (<i>d</i>. 1185), occasionally described as elder brother of Uhtred, may have been the child of a previous, irregular, liaison.<br>
<br>The ruler of a strategically located territory on the periphery of the spheres of power of the kings of Scotland and England, Fergus is traditionally represented as an independent or semi-independent magnate of the Norse&#150;Celtic world of the Irish Sea and Hebridean regions. While the growing power of the Scottish crown may have curtailed his freedom of manoeuvre, he was largely successful in limiting foreign influence over his lands. The military manpower of his extensive domain led to his being courted by both kingdoms, but his co-operation may have extended only so far as the limits of mutual interest.<br>
<br>The southward expansion of Scottish royal authority saw Fergus drawn into the orbit of David I, king of Scots (<i>r</i>. 1124&#150;53), and the Galwegians played a prominent role in David's campaigns against King Stephen in England after 1136. There is no evidence for the basis of the relationship between Fergus and David, which probably stemmed from simple recognition of the growing power of the Scottish king in the lands around the head of the Solway Firth, but it led to the provision of substantial numbers of warriors for David's armies. Atrocities committed in 1138 are ascribed in contemporary accounts of the campaign to the Galwegians, and their undisciplined action in the battle of the Standard in that year contributed significantly to the Scottish defeat.<br>
<br>Fergus was not involved in David's English ventures after 1138, but his relationship with the Scottish crown continued. The marriage of his heir, Uhtred, to Gunnilda, daughter of Waltheof of Allerdale, a prominent Cumbrian nobleman related to David by descent from the latter's great-uncle, Maldred, strengthened that relationship, at the same time binding Waltheof's family into the political framework of David's extended realm. Likewise, the marriage of Affreca to Olaf of Man drew an important regional power into the enlarged sphere of influence of the Scottish crown.<br>
<br>David I's attempts to free the Scottish church from the claims to metropolitan authority made by the archbishops of York did not, apparently, extend to the Galwegian bishopric of Whithorn, which had close links with York extending back to the eighth century. No bishops are recorded at Whithorn from the early ninth century until the appearance <i>c</i>.1128 of Bishop Gilla-Aldan, whose appointment may represent the revival of the old see. Fergus is often credited with the revival of Whithorn and the appointment of Gilla-Aldan, but there is no evidence for this, and Archbishop Thurstan of York (<i>d</i>. 1140), who needed loyal suffragan bishops both to strengthen his claims in Scotland and to fend off challenges to his status from the archbishop of Canterbury, is a more likely candidate. As the ruler of Galloway, however, Fergus must have been involved in any physical process of revival. His foundation of the Cistercian abbey of Dundrennan in 1142, colonized from Rievaulx in Yorkshire rather than Scottish Melrose, emphasizes the York connection.<br>
<br>In the 1150s Fergus's involvement in Scottish affairs declined. From 1153 his attention focused on Man and the Hebrides, where the assassination of his son-in-law had been followed by an attack on Galloway. There is, however, no evidence that Fergus assisted his grandson, Godred II, to win the Manx throne, or that he supported him in the general war in the Hebrides against Somerled of Argyll after 1154. A lessening involvement in Scottish matters, however, need not imply a rift with the new government of Malcolm IV (<i>r</i>. 1153&#150;65). Indeed, the capture at Whithorn and delivery to the king in 1156 of Donald MacHeth, son of Malcolm MacHeth, pretender to the Scottish throne, indicates the contrary.<br>
<br>Restoration of English control over Carlisle in 1157 marked a turning point in Fergus's relationship with the Scots. Scottish influence in the Solway region diminished, and Fergus perhaps seized the freedom of action which this afforded in an effort to assert his authority over his unruly sons. Only a garbled account survives, but it appears that Fergus sought to capitalize on the unrest triggered by Malcolm IV's participation in Henry II of England's expedition to Toulouse in 1159 and raided Scottish territory in a move to silence domestic opposition from his sons.<br>
<br>Malcolm's return in 1160 led to speedy settlement of the disturbances over Toulouse, freeing him to deal with Fergus: three invasions of Galloway were mounted in the course of the year. Perhaps weakened by discord with Uhtred and Gilbert, Fergus came to terms, and was obliged to resign his lordship and to retire into Holyrood Abbey at Edinburgh, where he died on 12 May 1161. Fergus's fall resulted in the partition of his lands between his sons, the imposition of more rigorous supervision over Galloway, and the beginning of moves to draw the region more effectively under Scottish overlordship.<br>
