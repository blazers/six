<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Cullingworth,  Charles James</span>  (1841&#150;1908), <span class="occ">gynaecologist and obstetrician</span>, son of Griffith Cullingworth (<i>d</i>. 1860), bookseller, and his wife, Sarah Gledhill, was born on 3 June 1841 at 23 Commercial Street, Leeds. He was educated at Wesley College in Sheffield before joining the family business, but after his father's death he entered the Leeds school of medicine, qualifying as a member of the Royal College of Surgeons in 1865, and licentiate of the Society of Apothecaries in 1866.<br>
<br>After eighteen months in general practice at Bawtry, near Doncaster, Cullingworth joined the Manchester Royal Infirmary in 1867 as resident physician's assistant, and later as resident medical officer. In 1869 he set up in private practice in Manchester. From 1872 to 1882 he also acted as police surgeon; he had always had an interest in legal matters and published a number of papers on medico-legal topics, including &#145;Methods of judicial administration in the past&#146; (1884) and &#145;The criminal responsibility of the insane&#146; (1888).<br>
<br>In 1873 Cullingworth was appointed honorary surgeon to St Mary's Hospital for Women and Children, Manchester, and after gaining his MD from Durham University (1881) he specialized in gynaecology. Cullingworth's work was closely linked with the Victoria University in Manchester; he strongly supported the campaign, in 1880, to gain university status for Owens College, and for the right of the Manchester medical school, from 1883, to confer its own medical degrees. He was determined to ensure a high academic standard of clinical medicine within the newly enchartered Victoria University. Cullingworth was lecturer in medical jurisprudence from 1879 but gave this up in 1885, when he was elected by his colleagues at St Mary's to the chair of obstetrics and gynaecology at Owens College. During his professorship he acted as secretary to the board of studies for the medical school, a position that allowed him to monitor the standard of medical degrees. He worked hard for the Manchester Medical Society, first as honorary librarian (1872&#150;8) and later as honorary secretary (1879&#150;84); he devoted much of his time to cataloguing the medical library and to establishing, in 1884, the <span class="italic">Medical Chronicle</span>, a monthly medical journal which was based in Manchester. On 15 April 1882 Cullingworth married Emily Mary, daughter of Richard Freeman, a London outfitter; they had at least one daughter.<br>
<br>By 1888 Cullingworth's reputation as a surgeon and medical lecturer had grown so much that he was offered the post of obstetric physician at St Thomas's Hospital, London. He found it difficult to leave Manchester but, once established at St Thomas's, his work quickly expanded and he also acted as visiting physician to the General Lying-in Hospital, York Road. After his retirement in 1904 he was made a governor of St Thomas's. Although an accomplished gynaecological surgeon he preferred the title of physician; in 1879 he had become a member of the Royal College of Physicians, and in 1887 he was elected a fellow. In 1902 he was the first physician to read the Bradshawe lecture to the college on an obstetric topic, &#145;Intraperitoneal haemorrhage incident to ectopic gestation&#146;. Most of his work in London was presented to the Obstetric Society; he played an active role in the society's affairs and was its president in 1897&#150;9.<br>
<br>Cullingworth was a pioneer of gynaecology. His most important work was on the causes of inflammation of the female pelvic organs&#151;pelvic peritonitis and salpingitis, which he demonstrated was not a primary condition, but usually secondary to some gynaecological infection. He argued that such conditions should be treated surgically; although such treatment later became accepted practice his paper to the Obstetric Society in 1892, entitled &#145;Abdominal section in certain cases of recurrent peritonitis&#146;, provoked considerable comment and criticism from many of his colleagues. His views were fully discussed in his <span class="italic">Clinical Illustrations of the Diseases of the Fallopian Tubes and of Tubal Gestation</span> (1895), a book well known for its beautiful illustrations. His section on pelvic inflammation in the textbook <span class="italic">System of Gynaecology</span> (edited by Allbutt and Playfair, 1896) was described in <span class="italic">The Lancet</span> (23 May 1908) as &#145;one of the best essays on the subject ever written&#146;. He published widely and made numerous contributions to the <span class="italic">Transactions of the Obstetrical Society of London</span> and to the <span class="italic">Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology of the British Empire</span>, which he had helped to found, in 1903, and which he edited for the last two years of his life.<br>
<br>Although Cullingworth is mainly remembered as a great surgical teacher it is arguable that his work to improve the standard of midwifery and to prevent puerperal fever was of much greater long-term importance for British obstetrics and the health of women. He deplored the ignorance and poor standards of nurses and midwives that he encountered in his early career, and published a number of instruction books for nurses, such as <span class="italic">A Short Manual for Monthly Nurses</span> (1884), which ran to six editions. He was especially concerned to improve the training of midwives, and was the leader in the movement to secure their legal registration through the <span class="roman">Midwives Act</span> (1902); he was chief executive on the <span class="roman">Midwives Bill</span> committee, and advised the privy council and the General Medical Council on the drafting of the bill. He represented the Midwives Institute on the Central Midwives' Board, which was set up to ensure the proper training and practice of registered midwives under the act. In recognition of this work he received the honorary degrees of DCL, from Durham in 1893, and LLD, from Aberdeen in 1904.<br>
<br>In later years Cullingworth suffered from angina but he continued working until his death, at 14 Manchester Square, London, on 11 May 1908. He was buried in Marylebone cemetery. His wife and daughter survived him.<br>
