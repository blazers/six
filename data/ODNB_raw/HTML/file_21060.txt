<span class="headword">Oxley,  John Joseph William Molesworth</span>  (<em>c.</em>1785&#150;1828), <span class="occ">surveyor and explorer in Australia</span>, born at Kirkham Abbey, Yorkshire, was the son of John Oxley, a man of landed stock, and his wife, Isabella, said to have been a daughter of the fourth Viscount Molesworth in the peerage of Ireland. He joined the navy in 1799 and arrived in Australia on the <i>Buffalo</i> in 1802. His ship was involved in survey work, and his enthusiasm and efficiency impressed Governor King. After returning to England in 1807 Oxley obtained a lieutenancy, and in 1808 he was back in Sydney as first lieutenant on HMS <i>Porpoise</i>. However, the business opportunities in the colony had not escaped him; he brought &pound;800-worth of goods to sell and an order for a grant of 600 acres, which Lieutenant-Colonel Paterson, the acting governor, increased to 1000 acres.<br>
<br>Oxley began a life which mixed surveying, exploration, and business. Back in England in 1810 he twice sought the surveyor-generalship of New South Wales, allegedly paying the incumbent to resign before obtaining the position in February 1812, through the interest of the Farquhar family, patrons of John Macarthur, his one-time friend. Oxley reached Sydney in November, and during Macquarie's administration was more involved in exploration than in the technicalities of his profession. In March 1817, with the botanist Alan Cunningham, he led an expedition to follow the Lachlan River and to search for the fabled inland sea; after nineteen weeks he was stopped by impenetrable marshes on the Lachlan and returned to Bathurst, the praise of his governor, and a gift of &pound;200.<br>
<br>Convinced that the inland sea did exist, Oxley set out again in May 1818 and followed the Macquarie River from Bathurst until he met the reeds of the Macquarie marshes. Then he turned north-east and came across the Castlereagh River; to the east he traversed the rich Liverpool plains and the Peel River, and followed the Hastings River to its mouth at Port Macquarie. The six months' expedition had found valuable grazing land, and Oxley thought (wrongly) he was close to &#145;an inland sea, most probably a shoal one&#146;  (Oxley, entry for 3 July 1818). He explored Jervis Bay and the five islands in 1819 but was unimpressed, though in December 1820 he recommended Port Macquarie as the site of a new penal settlement. In 1823 he sailed up the Queensland coast as far as Port Curtis, and on his return surveyed Moreton Bay and the Brisbane River, recommending that a penal colony be established there&#151;as it was, at Redeliffe, in August 1824. The administration of his department came to occupy more of Oxley's time. He advised Commissioner Bigge on land sales, drew up regulations on the matter for Governor Brisbane (1824, 1825), and was involved in the first attempt to survey the colony on the orders of London, constantly complaining about the inadequacies of his staff and his fees.<br>
<br>Oxley failed as a merchant and businessman. He was constantly in debt, and in 1812 this cost him his hoped-for marriage to Elizabeth Macarthur; her father, John Macarthur, refused Oxley's offer for her hand, declaring, correctly, that Oxley would never survive among the &#145;sharks&#146; of the colony. Even his illegal deals to sell cattle to the government stores failed; his only success was as a grazier, although even here he was accused of selling crossbred sheep as pure merinos. He antagonized both Macquarie and Macarthur; indeed, many thought him unprincipled and factious, but he was a member of the legislative council in 1824&#150;5, a generous patron to the churches and to charity, and active in all aspects of public life in New South Wales.<br>
<br>Denied Elizabeth Macarthur's hand in 1812, on 31 October 1821 Oxley married an educated English gentlewoman, Emma (1798&#150;1885), the daughter of John Norton, a landowner of Mulgoa, New South Wales, with whom he had two sons, John and Henry. He already had three illegitimate daughters, two with Charlotte Thorpe and another with Elizabeth Marnon. He lived well, dividing his time between his town house in Sydney and his property at Kirkham, near Camden, where he had moved in 1817. He died on 26 May 1828, at Kirkham, from a kidney disease probably caused by the privations of exploring, and was buried in the Devonshire Street cemetery in Sydney. He was virtually penniless, but the British government awarded his sons 5000 acres in recognition of their father's explorations.<br>
<br>A brave, diligent explorer, Oxley was a complex man who craved social acceptance and economic success. The latter eluded him, but his travels through New South Wales were crucial to the great pastoral &#145;break-out&#146; of the 1830s. Australians remember him as a man who tried&#151;and failed&#151;to solve the problems of the western rivers, but his book, <span class="italic">Journals of Two Expeditions into the Interior of New South Wales</span> (1820), was the first detailed account of Australian exploration by land.<br>
