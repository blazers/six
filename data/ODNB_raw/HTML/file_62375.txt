<span class="headword">Swingler,  Randall Carline</span>  (1909&#150;1967), <span class="occ">writer</span>, was born on 27 May 1909 at Glebe House, Church Lane, Aldershot, Hampshire, the fourth of the seven children of Humphrey Thomas Carline Swingler (1877&#150;1938), assistant curate of Aldershot parish church, later vicar of Long Eaton in Nottinghamshire and Cranbrook in Kent, and his wife, Mabel Henrietta Davidson (1878&#150;1962). His grandfather, Henry Swingler, was an ironmaster, railway builder, coal owner, and deputy lieutenant of Derbyshire. His maternal grandfather was Colonel Charles Elliott of the Seaforth Highlanders and the Madras artillery. His uncle and godfather was the archbishop of Canterbury <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32733/', "Randall Thomas Davidson (1848&#150;1930)")</script>. Stephen Swingler (1915&#150;1969), his younger brother, became a junior minister in Harold Wilson's government.<br>
<br>Swingler was educated at home until he was ten, when he went to St Ronan's preparatory school in Worthing. He attended Winchester College from 1921 to 1928 and graduated from New College, Oxford, where he earned a reputation as a runner, flautist, and poet. In 1931 he met the concert pianist Geraldine Peppin (1913&#150;1980), for whom he wrote <span class="italic">Poems</span> (1932). They married on 17 April 1933 and moved to the Cotswolds, where their daughter Judith was born in 1935. Swingler was a schoolteacher for a few years after leaving Oxford.<br>
<br>Like many of his generation Swingler believed that the political and economic crises of the 1930s required revolutionary solutions, a conviction expressed in the poems of <span class="italic">Reconstruction</span> (1933) and the widely acclaimed <span class="italic">Difficult Morning</span> (1933). In 1934 the Swinglers joined the Communist Party and Randall gave away his inherited wealth to the party. With his Jean Gabin-like good looks and unworldly charm, Swingler was the best-known young writer then active in the party. He edited <span class="italic">Left Review</span> and published Nancy Cunard's <span class="italic">Authors Take Sides on the Spanish War</span> (1937). He wrote a new version of <span class="italic">Peer Gynt</span> for the Group Theatre (where he was assistant editor of the <span class="italic">Group Theatre Magazine</span>) and several plays for the Unity Theatre, including the mass declamation <span class="italic">Spain</span> (1936), and <span class="italic">Crisis</span>, about the Munich negotiations (1938). He wrote <span class="italic">Peace and Prosperity</span> (1937) for the London Choral Union, a new version of Handel's <span class="italic">Belshazzar</span> (1938) for the London Co-op Choirs, and the chorale finale of Alan Bush's <span class="italic">Piano Concerto</span> (1938). In 1938 he launched his own radical paperback publishing company, Fore Publications, selling half a million books in twelve months.<br>
<br>A flautist of professional standard (he played with the London Symphony Orchestra), he was active in the Workers' Music Association and in the Left Book Club, for whom he and Bush edited the <span class="italic">Left Song Book</span> (1938). Swingler and Bush also organized the 1939 Festival of Music and the People, which included an Albert Hall pageant written by Swingler and starring Paul Robeson, as well as the premier of Benjamin Britten's <span class="italic">Ballad of Heroes</span>, for whose libretto Swingler collaborated with W. H. Auden. Swingler published two well-received novels, <span class="italic">No Escape</span> (1937) and <span class="italic">To Town</span> (1939). In 1939 he was made literary editor of the <span class="italic">Daily Worker</span>.<br>
<br>During the first months of the Second World War Swingler worked as a staff reporter for the <span class="italic">Daily Worker</span>, writing anti-government blitz journalism until the paper was banned in 1941. He took over the journal <span class="italic">Poetry and the People</span>, relaunching it as <span class="italic">Our Time</span>, and brought the magazine <span class="italic">Seven</span> into the Fore Publications stable as a magazine of new writing from the forces. Called up at the end of 1941, he trained as a wireless operator before being posted overseas with the 56th divisional signals. Swingler took part in the Salerno landings in September 1943, and was in almost continuous action for the next twenty months. He was made a corporal at Anzio, and for his part in the battle of Lake Commachio (April 1945) was awarded the Military Medal for bravery.<br>
<br>Swingler returned to London in 1946 to edit <span class="italic">Our Time</span> with Edgell Rickword. He broadcast regularly for the BBC, taught adult education classes for the University of London, and collected his war poems in <span class="italic">The Years of Anger</span> (1946). A familiar figure in the London bars of Fitzrovia, he had a brief affair with the novelist Penelope Dimont [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/73075/', "Mortimer, Penelope Ruth (1918&#150;1999)")</script>]; their daughter, Deborah, was born in 1948 after the affair ended earlier that year.<br>
<br>In cold war London Swingler found himself attacked from both sides. His adult education classes were investigated and he was blacklisted at the BBC; inside the Communist Party he was attacked for liberal sympathies and forced to resign from <span class="italic">Our Time</span>. Its successors <span class="italic">Arena</span> and <span class="italic">Circus</span> both proved short-lived, too literary for the Communist Party and too political for the book trade. When in 1950 Fore Publications published a series of poetry books, including Swingler's <span class="italic">The God in the Cave</span>, they were ignored by literary London and denounced as &#145;bohemian&#146; by the Communist Party. Visits to Czechoslovakia in 1953 and Romania in 1954 did nothing to persuade Swingler that communism was not in crisis, and he resigned from the Communist Party early in 1956, just prior to the Hungarian rising. The following year he helped found the journal <span class="italic">New Reasoner</span>.<br>
<br>Swingler spent the last decade of his life in the village of Pebmarsh in Essex. While Geraldine taught at the Guildhall School of Music, he stayed at home to look after their son Dan, born in 1951. He wrote a book about the Lidice massacre, in Czechoslovakia during the Second World War (unpublished), and several librettos for his friends Bernard Stevens and Alan Rawsthorne. By 1965 writer's block, political despair, financial worries, heavy drinking, and medication for a serious heart condition combined to cause a breakdown. He died of a heart attack on 19 June 1967, outside the York Minster pub in Soho, and was cremated at Golders Green crematorium, London.<br>
<br>Although Randall Swingler published only five books of poetry, he was a prolific playwright, novelist, librettist, critic, editor, and lyric poet, and a unique and unflinching witness to his times, from the idealistic communism of the early 1930s to the grim defeats of the cold war.<br>
