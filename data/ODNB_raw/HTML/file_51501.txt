<span class="headword">Boyd,  Margaret <span class="st"> [Maggie]</span></span>  (1913&#150;1993), <span class="occ">schoolteacher and lacrosse player</span>, was born on 17 January 1913 in Strasbourg, Alsace, Germany, the daughter and fourth of five children of Dr Harold de Haven Boyd, manager of a Manchester oil company, and his wife, Charlotte Elisabeth, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Austin. She was educated at Berkhamsted Girls' School in Hertfordshire and Wycombe Abbey in Buckinghamshire, the latter a school to which lacrosse had been introduced in 1896 by Francis Jane Dove. At school Boyd excelled in games and was an able pianist.<br>
<br>After training as a physical education teacher at Bedford College, Boyd taught first at Roedean School and then at Berkhamsted until the beginning of the Second World War. During the war she motorcycled daily to Ashridge House, near Berkhamsted, where she worked as a physiotherapist. Finally she returned to Wycombe Abbey, first as a teacher in charge of physical education and subsequently also as a housemistress&#151;positions she held until her retirement in 1975, though even then she often helped out when there was a staff shortage. As with most of her activities she participated to the fullest and at Wycombe, in addition to her specified duties, she co-ordinated the school appeal, was in charge of careers advice, organized the sixth-form social work in High Wycombe, played a major role in the seniors (old girls') association, and generally became renowned as &#145;a superb crisis handler&#146;  (<span class="italic">Wycombe Abbey Gazette</span>).<br>
<br>Boyd played lacrosse for Bedford College and then for Boxmoor Ladies. A strong defence wing, she gained her first England selection in 1934 and captained the national side from 1937 until 1951, playing on the first official English tour to the United States in 1949.<br>
<br>During the war the annual home nations' tournament was interrupted for the first time since its inception in 1913. Women's club lacrosse came virtually to a standstill, but the schoolgirl game continued, thanks very much to the work of Boyd; she scavenged for balls and other essential gear, placing advertisements in the national press which produced large quantities of equipment. In 1946 she established the national schools' tournament, held annually at the close of each season. This became a five-day competition, one of the trophies competed for being the Boyd cup.<br>
<br>When she finished playing international lacrosse Boyd worked on the staff of Winsor School in Boston, Maine, for three years. She also began to coach lacrosse in Maine and returned there annually for over twenty years to coach in summer camps. As a coach she had the ability to spot the potential in players and nurse it to fruition. On her return to Britain she moved into administration of the game, becoming vice-president of the English Women's Lacrosse Association in 1955 and holding the presidency from 1967 to 1972. In 1969 she organized and managed a combined British and United States team&#151;the Pioneers&#151;which made the first overseas tour to Australia and played exhibition games there and also in New Zealand, Hong Kong, Japan, and Holland. Two years later she was awarded the OBE for services to lacrosse.<br>
<br>In April 1972 Boyd was elected foundation president of the International Federation of Women's Lacrosse Associations when it was established at Williamsburg, Virginia. Essentially a modest person who was easily embarrassed, she took little personal credit for the worldwide development of the sport and the establishment of a world cup. She simply said that she was &#145;thrilled that the small beginning had blossomed into such a thriving organisation due to the outstanding leadership of the presidents that followed me&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Independent</span>). Others thought differently, and only a few days before her death she was elected to the lacrosse hall of fame in Baltimore, the first woman to gain that honour.<br>
<br>Boyd had a great sense of fun, often interrupting other teachers' lessons with notes requesting the solution to a particular clue in the <span class="italic">Times</span> crossword, of which she was a devotee. She was also a good golfer and bridge player. Never married, she died of heart failure on 21 November 1993 at her home, 16 Crossways, Berkhamsted, which she had shared with her sister Etheldreda, leaving an estate of &pound;1,696,159. She gave &pound;1000 of this to Wycombe Abbey with the wish that it be used for any seniors who needed financial help.<br>
