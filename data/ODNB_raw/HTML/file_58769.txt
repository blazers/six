</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Deller,  Alfred George</span>  (1912&#150;1979), <span class="occ">singer</span>, was born on 31 May 1912 at 42 Clifton Terrace, Margate, Kent, the son of Thomas William Deller (1871&#150;1951), a physical training instructor, and his wife, Mary Ann Cave (1874&#150;1946). He was the sixth of seven children. He was educated at the Central School, Margate, before finding employment in 1927 as an apprentice in the furniture shop of Munro Cobb in Margate. When that job was discontinued he went to work in 1929 for the Hastings firm of Elijah Gray &amp; Sons Ltd, house furnishers and undertakers, as a furniture salesman. There he met the owner's daughter, Kathleen Margaret (Peggy) Lowe (1913&#150;2006), whom he married on 5 June 1937; they had two sons and a daughter. His wife became a firm supporter of his desire to sing and to give that precedence over his other employment.<br>
<br>Deller's earliest singing experience was as a boy chorister at St John's Church, Margate, where he sang the treble solos until he was sixteen. His first position as a counter-tenor was at Christ Church, St Leonards, where he sang from 1930; he moved to Canterbury Cathedral as a lay clerk in 1939. A firm pacifist, after appearing at a conscription tribunal in October 1940 he was registered as a conscientious objector. Deller was fortunate enough to find work on a farm within cycling distance of Canterbury which allowed him to continue with his cathedral duties.<br>
<br>Deller's solo career was launched in 1943 when Michael Tippett was in Canterbury prior to the first performance of his <span class="italic">Plebs angelica</span>. Tippett was encouraged to hear him sing Purcell's &#145;Music for a while&#146;, at which, Tippett wrote later, &#145;the centuries rolled back. For I recognised absolutely that this was the voice for which Purcell had written&#146;  (Tippett, Bergmann, and Spencer, 43). In a testimonial dated 15 July 1946 Tippett further wrote: &#145;It is the most remarkable male alto voice that I have ever heard, with an unrivalled purity of diction added&#151;I can only imagine by hard work&#146;  (private information). Tippett and Walter Bergmann together decided to take Deller's voice to London, where Deller made his d&eacute;but singing Purcell's &#145;'Tis nature's voice&#146; from the ode to St Cecilia of 1694 at the Friends' meeting-house in Euston Road on 31 December 1943, a concert promoted to raise funds for Morley College. Tippett then asked Deller to perform the &#145;Esurientes&#146; from J. S. Bach's <span class="roman">Magnificat</span> with the Morley College choir. Many engagements followed, including an invitation to sing Purcell's <span class="italic">Come ye Sons of Art</span> in the BBC Third Programme's inaugural concert in 1946. Deller soon moved to London after this, turning fully professional when he joined the choir of St Paul's Cathedral in 1947 as a vicar-choral, a post that he held until 1961. Although his career was to require him to live in London, and to travel all over the world, he never lost touch with Kent, eventually settling in Ashford.<br>
<br>Deller's reputation rests principally on his performances of English lute songs, most importantly those of Dowland, and as an unrivalled interpreter of Purcell: it was his artistry that caused both these repertories to be recognized for their full worth for the first time. In addition he had a limited but significant career as an opera singer, culminating in the role of Oberon in <span class="italic">A Midsummer Night's Dream</span>, which Benjamin Britten wrote for him. This received its first performance in 1960 at Aldeburgh: Deller sang both on this occasion and on the subsequent recording. He founded the Deller Consort in 1950, primarily to specialize in the English madrigal repertory, and the group toured widely in North America, Europe, Australasia, and the Far East. In addition, in 1963 he started the Stour Music Festival in Kent, where he directed performances of larger works. His regular accompanists included Walter Bergmann, Desmond Dupr&eacute;, and later Robert Spencer.<br>
<br>Deller's reputation also rests on the fact that he was the first falsetto singer to bring the counter-tenor voice to prominence. Indeed he did more than this, since when he started his career the counter-tenor sound was scarcely known outside cathedral circles and, when it became known, was treated with suspicion. Bergmann remembered that:<blockquote>audiences in the 1940s did not know what to make of a man who sang in a female voice's tessitura. At its best they held it for a gimmick, at its worst for &#145;unnatural&#146;, even for a castrato's voice. And was there any music composed for that strange voice, and if so was it not outdated? &hellip; At each concert [Deller] had first to overcome the antipathy of 75 per cent of his audience. (Tippett, Bergmann, and Spencer, 44)</blockquote>Deller himself liked to tell the story of an agent who, at the beginning of his career, broke out in indignation, &#145;What? A Purcell programme? A dead loss&#146;  (ibid.). Yet such was Deller's talent and tenacity of purpose that works which had once been bypassed because they contained complicated counter-tenor solo parts were eventually searched out and performed for the same reason.<br>
<br>As the first counter-tenor to become an international star, Deller created the platform on which many younger singers were able to perform; yet none of them made a sound to resemble his. The explanation is that Deller trained in cathedral choirs and retained the essentially vibrato-less, almost white tone of the ideal cathedral singer. Later it became customary for counter-tenor soloists to develop a fuller tone, even in lute songs, which by comparison gives Deller's performances&#151;described at various times as being &#145;sweet&#146;, &#145;flexible&#146;, &#145;agile&#146;, and with the sound &#145;focussed to a pin-point&#146;&#151;a rare quality. Unusual also was the intensity of his conviction that singing was nothing if not communication with an audience, in modern concert conditions. Unlike many later singers of the earlier repertories Deller had no interest in musicological knowledge or analysis, but relied on a vivid artistic imagination which left everything to the performance. Robert Spencer recalled:<blockquote>Alfred disliked rehearsal &hellip; The first time I accompanied him he reluctantly went through every song with me, and I was feeling reasonably confident. Fortunately his son Mark warned me that the performance might not be so predictable, but I was flabbergasted when the evening bore so little resemblance to the afternoon. (Tippett, Bergmann, and Spencer, 45)</blockquote>Deller has occasionally been criticized for vocal mannerisms&#151;the colouring of a high note, the drawing back of a rhythm&#151;yet the artlessness of his vocal sound conveys a straightforward sincerity. However involved the search for authenticity in early music becomes it will never find a way of replacing Deller's concern for the inspiration of the moment.<br>
<br>Despite suffering from angina, Deller continued to sing, &#145;albeit with diminishing range and power&#146;  (Steane). He was appointed OBE in 1970. He had a heart attack while in Bologna in Italy, and died there at the Ospedale S. Orsola on 16 July 1979; he was buried in the churchyard of All Saints', Boughton Aluph, Kent. His wife, Peggy, survived him. His son Mark Deller continued to perform with and direct the Deller Consort.<br>
