<span class="headword">Ermengarde</span> <span class="st"> [Ermengarde  de Beaumont]</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1233), <span class="occ">queen of Scots, consort of William I</span>, was a daughter of Richard, vicomte de Beaumont-sur-Sarthe, who was the son of Constance, an illegitimate daughter of King Henry I of England. She thus had (somewhat thin) royal blood to commend her when Henry II of England proposed her, in May 1186, as a bride for <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29452/', "William I (William the Lion), king of Scots")</script>. The bride's social rank meant that the king was disparaged by the match, but he and his advisers reluctantly accepted it. The marriage took place at Woodstock on 5 September 1186; Henry II paid for the four days of festivities and returned Edinburgh Castle (in his hands since 1174) to the king of Scots as part of the bride's tocher (dowry). King William was to provide &pound;100 of rents and forty knights feus in Scotland for Ermengarde; he probably honoured the first part of this, as she later had her own household, and dwellings and lands at Crail and Haddington.<br>
<br>At the time of her marriage Ermengarde, whose date of birth is unknown, was called &#145;a girl&#146; (<i>puella</i>) by a contemporary; possibly she was just at (or even below) the canonical age of twelve years for marriage and that this was another reason for the king's reluctance to accept her. After the wedding she was escorted back to Scotland by Jocelin, bishop of Glasgow, and other Scottish nobles; the two kings went off to Marlborough, perhaps for some hunting.<br>
<br>Whatever her age, the queen's duty was to bear a legitimate and preferably male heir. During the years between 1187 and 1195 her eldest child, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/49377/', "Margaret")</script>, was born, and probably also another daughter, Isabella. Then, on 24 August 1198, a boy, the future king <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/322/', "Alexander II")</script> was born at Haddington. He was the first surviving legitimate son born to a reigning king of Scots for some seventy years and, not surprisingly, a contemporary noted that &#145;many rejoiced at his birth&#146;  (Anderson, 2.348). Later, there was a third daughter, Marjorie.<br>
<br>In July&#150;August 1209 a diplomatic crisis between England and Scotland led to the treaty of Norham. By it the marriages of Ermengarde's two eldest daughters into the English royal house were proposed, and a few days later both girls were delivered at Carlisle, along with other hostages, to the justiciar of England. Whether their mother had art or part in the treaty is unknown; probably, she did not. But in further negotiations at Durham in early 1212, when her husband was absent, she mediated actively between the two sides. A contemporary observer calls her &#145;an extraordinary woman, gifted with a charming and witty eloquence&#146;  (Bower, 4.469). She may have charmed King John; no more Scottish hostages were handed over and Alexander was to be knighted and, later, married to an English princess. The Scottish representatives had ensured that he would succeed to a still separate kingdom of the Scots.<br>
<br>After her husband's death, on 4 December 1214, Ermengarde remained grieving at Stirling, while the inauguration of Alexander II took place at Scone. The royal Christmas feast for 1214 was held at Forfar and the king and his mother were back at Stirling in January 1215; afterwards they went together to Arbroath to see the tomb of King William. Ermengarde probably played a part in Scottish politics, especially with regard to relations with England in 1215 and later; with other Scottish leaders she was excommunicated and then absolved in 1217. In 1225 she and Alexander II began to assemble property for their foundation of the Cistercian abbey of Balmerino, and by 1229 the first members of the house were in place. Unusually for Scotland, it was dedicated to St Edward the Confessor, for whom the queen seems to have had a special veneration; her only other known religious gift was to the hospital of St Edward at Berwick. Ermengarde died on 11 February 1233 and was buried at Balmerino.<br>
<br>Ermengarde's eldest daughter, Margaret, was married at London on 3 October 1221 to <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/3991/', "Hubert de Burgh")</script>, justiciar of England and later earl of Kent. Her second daughter, Isabella, still single, returned to Scotland in 1223. In May 1225 she was married at Alnwick to <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2380/', "Roger (III) Bigod, earl of Norfolk")</script>, a minor and probably some twenty years her junior. Custody of Roger was given to Alexander II, but the earl probably returned to England after 1233. The couple were childless; Bigod repudiated his wife in 1245 but was compelled to take her back in 1253. She was still alive in October 1263, but her date of death is unknown. She was buried at Blackfriars in London. In 1227 Marjorie was sought as a bride by Henry III's brother, Richard of Cornwall, who came to Scotland to speak to Ermengarde about the match. But his proposals pleased neither the Scots nor Henry III, and negotiations were broken off. She was married on 1 August 1235 at Berwick to <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18121/', "Gilbert Marshal, earl of Pembroke")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18127/', "Marshal, William (II)")</script>], who died in 1241. They, too, were childless. Marjorie died on 17 November 1244 and was also buried at Blackfriars in London.<br>
