<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Bonomi,  Joseph <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em>Giuseppe]</span></span>  (1739&#150;1808), <span class="occ">architect</span>, was born on 19 January 1739 in Rome, the eldest of five children of Giovanni Giacomo Bonomi (<i>d</i>. 1750), agent to some of the Roman nobility, and his wife, Teresa Corbi. He studied at the Collegio Romano, and, according to his son Ignatius, writing in 1808, having as a child &#145;employed himself &hellip; in endeavouring to solve architectural problems&#146;  (I. Bonomi to Lord Buchan, May 1808, U. Glas. L., MS Murray, 502/41/3), he was placed under Antonio Asprucci (1723&#150;1808), architect to Prince Borghese. He studied also with Girolamo Teodoli (1677&#150;1766) and possibly received tuition in drawing from Charles-Louis Cl&eacute;risseau. About 1763 James Adam, then on his grand tour in Rome, saw some of Bonomi's work, including drawings in competition for a gold medal in architecture, and engaged him to work exclusively for the Adam brothers in drawing Roman antiquities.<br>
<br>In 1767 Robert and James Adam invited Bonomi to Britain, where he worked as a draughtsman in their London office until 1781. His skill as a perspectivist makes it highly probable that some of the finest architectural drawings of the Adam office, especially interior views for the Adam brothers' publication <span class="italic">The Works in Architecture</span> (1778&#150;9), were done by Bonomi. His only known independent design of this period, for the sacristy intended by Pope Pius VI for St Peter's, Rome (1776), must have been produced surreptitiously, since the Adams forbade their employees to engage in private work, under threat of a heavy financial penalty. In 1775 Bonomi married Rosa Florini (1755&#150;1812), cousin and ward of the artist Angelica Kauffman. Rosa Florini had come to Britain in 1767 with Angelica's father; Angelica herself married Bonomi's friend and erstwhile colleague in the Adam office, the artist Antonio Zucchi, in 1781. The Bonomis' first children, twins Angelica (<i>d</i>. 1792) and Luigi (<i>d</i>. 1784), were born in 1779.<br>
<br>Bonomi left the Adams in 1781 and set up as an independent architect. He prepared designs dated 1782, all apparently unexecuted, for several clients, including his later patrons the bluestocking Elizabeth Montagu and the fourth earl of Aylesford. In 1783 he was induced, probably by Angelica Kauffman, to return to Italy. His younger brother Giovanni Carlo Bonomi (1743&#150;1801), professor of theology at the <i>propaganda fide</i> in Rome, possibly also held out the prospect of work. Bonomi was elected a member of the Accademia di Belle Arti at Bologna, and the Accademia di San Luca at Rome, and made a tour of southern Italy, examining among other sites the Greek Doric temples of Paestum. Success in Italy eluded him, however, and in 1784 he returned to London, practising there until his death. In Britain he received commissions almost immediately, and with some of his patrons his relations were close and long-lasting, particularly with Heneage Finch, fourth earl of Aylesford, to whom he acted as tutor and drawing-master as well as architect.<br>
<br>Bonomi exhibited regularly at the Royal Academy from 1783. In 1789, after several attempts, he was elected an associate on the casting vote of the president, Sir Joshua Reynolds. Reynolds proposed Bonomi as a full academician and professor of perspective in 1790, but Henry Fuseli was elected instead; regular attempts to promote Bonomi were made until 1806, but he was consistently opposed by a group in the academy which included Joseph Farington. In 1800 Bonomi was appointed architect to the king of Naples, but was unable to take up the post because of political conditions in Italy. In 1804 he received the honorary title of architect to St Peter's, Rome. Bonomi's Royal Academy exhibits, many of which are now in the Royal Institute of British Architects drawings collection in London, showed a firm handling of perspective and a feeling for light and shade; there is an unsubstantiated family tradition that the young J. M. W. Turner painted the landscapes in some of Bonomi's exhibits. Bonomi's design for Elizabeth Montagu's Great Room in Portman Square, London (exhibited 1790), is especially fine. The Great Room excited much admiration when it was finished in 1791, and was inspected by Queen Charlotte, but it did not lead to any other commissions on so grand a scale.<br>
<br>In his designs Bonomi turned away from the Adam brothers' elaborate delicacy, producing stronger and more chaste designs which possibly reflect the influence of James Wyatt (with whom he occasionally collaborated) and Henry Holland. Bonomi's exteriors, however, were often blockish and severe, unless enlivened by a bold feature, such as a <i>porte-coch&egrave;re</i> (at Longford Hall, Shropshire, built in 1789&#150;92 for Ralph Leake, and Laverstoke Park, Hampshire, built in 1796 for Henry Portal) or an open colonnaded belvedere on the roof (as at Rosneath, Dunbartonshire, 1803&#150;8; dem. 1961, for the fifth duke of Argyll). Other forceful features used by Bonomi were a double, superimposed portico&#151;employed at Barrells House, Henley in Arden, Warwickshire (1792&#150;4), for Robert Knight, and Stansted House, Sussex (1786&#150;91), for Richard Barwell&#151;and ground-floor wings linked to the <i>piano nobile</i> of the main house by descending quadrant passages, at Eastwell Park, Kent (1793&#150;9), for George Finch Hatton.<br>
<br>Bonomi remodelled the interiors of Lord Aylesford's Packington Hall, Warwickshire, over many years. His work at Packington culminated in two extraordinary designs, the Pompeian Gallery (1787) and Packington church (1789&#150;90). The source for the gallery, Nicolas Ponce's <span class="italic">Description des bains de Titus</span> (1786), may have been suggested by Aylesford, a connoisseur of architecture. Aylesford possibly also inspired the design of Packington church, a remarkable neo-classical building with a Greek-cross plan, vaulting derived from the Roman baths of Diocletian, and Greek Doric columns; Bonomi translated this eclectic material into solid form, producing a startlingly original building without parallel in English church architecture. His sources were mainly Roman: the pyramid of Caius Cestius in Rome inspired his pyramidal mausoleum (1793) at Blickling Park, Norfolk, for the second earl of Buckinghamshire. As a Roman Catholic he was at that time excluded from public commissions, but he designed two Catholic embassy chapels in London, the Bavarian chapel in Warwick Street (1789&#150;90) and the Spanish chapel in Manchester Square (1793&#150;6). Bonomi had no affection for the Gothic style, which he felt had totally corrupted architecture, but he produced a few unexecuted Gothic designs, for a gateway and a castellated summer house.<br>
<br>Bonomi died at home at 76 Great Titchfield Street, London, on 9 March 1808, and was buried in Marylebone churchyard. His grave no longer exists, but the Latin inscription on his gravestone was published in the second volume of the second edition of Daniel Lysons's <span class="italic">Environs of London</span> (1811). A son, Peter, died in 1792, and another son, John James (1782&#150;1803), was killed at the battle of Assaye in India. His six surviving children were: <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/48420/', "Ignatius Bonomi (1787&#150;1870)")</script>, also an architect; Charles (1789&#150;1826), a soldier; Agnes (1792&#150;1874); <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2858/', "Joseph Bonomi (1796&#150;1878)")</script> and his twin sister, Mary Anne (1796&#150;1872), mother of George Goldie, another architect; and Justina (1801&#150;1890).<br>
