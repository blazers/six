<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Bourke,  Richard Southwell</span>, sixth earl of Mayo  (1822&#150;1872), <span class="occ">viceroy of India</span>, was the eldest son of Robert Bourke (1797&#150;1867), who succeeded his uncle as fifth earl of Mayo in 1849, and his wife, Anne (or Annie) Charlotte Jocelyn (<i>d</i>. 1867). Born in Dublin on 21 February 1822, the eldest of ten children, he grew up in an evangelical household at Hayes in co. Meath. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/31990/', "Robert Bourke")</script> was a younger brother. He was educated at home, and in 1841 entered Trinity College, Dublin, where, without going into residence, he took an ordinary degree. Bourke was not a highly educated man, but became an accomplished sportsman.<h2>
<a name="Earlycareerandmarriage"></a>Early career, and marriage</h2>In 1845 Bourke visited Russia, and on his return published an acutely observed account of his tour, <span class="italic">St Petersburg and Moscow: a Visit to the Court of the Czar</span> (2 vols., 1846). In 1847 he was active in famine relief in Ireland, and at the general election was returned as a protectionist for co. Kildare. On 31 October 1848 he married Blanche Julia Wyndham (1826&#150;1918), daughter of George, first Lord Leconfield. They were to have four sons and three daughters; the eldest daughter died an infant in 1851. In 1849 his father succeeded to the earldom of Mayo, and Bourke assumed the courtesy title Lord Naas. In 1852 he was appointed chief secretary for Ireland in Lord Derby's administration, and held the same office in subsequent Conservative administrations until his appointment as viceroy of India by Disraeli in 1868, having succeeded to the Irish earldom in 1867.<br>
<br>Mayo sat in the House of Commons as member for co. Kildare from 1847 to 1852, for Coleraine from 1852 to 1857, and for Cockermouth from 1857 to 1868. As chief secretary, he became the acknowledged manager of the Conservative Party in Ireland, and a significant factor in the relative electoral successes of his party in Ireland at the mid-century. In particular, he was largely responsible for the limited electoral agreement with the Independent Party between 1857 and 1859, which was of great advantage to the Conservatives in Ireland. He opposed the disestablishment of the Church of Ireland, but gradually became less sectarian in his opinions. He was resolute in his handling of the Fenian crisis of the 1860s, but in 1867 he encountered difficulties in dealing with the Orangeman William Johnstone of Ballykilbeg. Despite initially opposing it, he came to support compensating tenants for improvements made without the consent of their landlords. He has been described as one of those &#145;efficient, loyal and dedicated politicians of the second rank without whose constant hard work the tedious chores so necessary for success tend to remain undone&#146;  (Hoppen, 293).<h2>
<a name="GovernorgeneralofIndia"></a>Governor-general of India</h2>In 1868 Disraeli selected him for the governor-generalship of India, which Mayo had long coveted. The Conservative ministry had in fact resigned before the office became vacant, and, despite the fact that Mayo had already sailed for India, Gladstone seriously contemplated cancelling the appointment, believing that a viceroy should not be appointed by a government in its last agony. However, the recall was not issued. Energetic, buoyant, and self-assured, Mayo had no preconceived ideas about India and made his own policies based on the facts as he came to see them.<br>
<br>Sworn in as governor-general at Calcutta on 12 January 1869, the first question which engaged the new viceroy's attention was the relationship with the neighbouring state of Afghanistan. Mayo's predecessor, John Lawrence, advised him to meet the amir, Sher Ali, as the civil war of succession seemed to have ended after six years. Approving of the decision to aid the restoration of settled government in that country, Mayo arranged to meet the amir at Ambala in the Punjab in March 1869. As it had been widely reported that Sher Ali was under the control of Russia and Persia, the effect of such a meeting would be considerable throughout central Asia. Sher Ali, on his part, made no secret of his desire to meet the viceroy. As in March the government of India would be in transit from Delhi to the summer capital, Simla, no impression would be given of deviating from normal arrangements; and by making the venue Ambala and not Peshawar, which was nearer Afghanistan, it was implied that the meeting had been sought by the amir, rather than the viceroy. No approval for the meeting was sought from London, the government merely suggesting that Lawrence's policy of reserve and abstention from central Asian politics be maintained.<br>
<br>In matters of ceremonial Mayo, to the amir's satisfaction, treated him as an equal. The viceroy's main objectives were the creation of a strong and independent government in Afghanistan, total abstinence from interference in its internal affairs, the development and promotion of trade with central Asia, access to information about events in that region, and a frontier that was well policed. A middle path between interference and inaction, a policy of watchful friendly relations, was the safest course. The advance of Russia could be checked mainly by pushing British commerce northwards. The British would assist the amir&#151;without intervening in the domestic affairs of Afghanistan or pushing troops or residents into his country&#151;to form a strong and permanent government in return for increased facilities for trade, and measures to maintain order in those portions of the border over which the amir had any influence. Mayo resisted, on his own responsibility, Sher Ali's demands for British refusal to recognize anybody else as amir, for a fixed and increased subsidy, and for a treaty of mutual assistance. All that he would offer was an assurance of &#145;cordial countenance and some additional support as it may be advisable&#146;, a siege battery, 6000 muskets, and a letter of general support discouraging Sher Ali's foes and viewing with &#145;severe displeasure&#146; attempts to thwart his &#145;rightful rule&#146;. Neither side mentioned Russia or central Asia.<br>
<br>Both sides were satisfied with the results of the Ambala conference. The British government was concerned that Mayo might have gone too far in his support for the amir, but the viceroy stood his ground. In 1871 the amir's eldest son, Yakub, imperilled the peace and it was suggested that the government of India should dispatch troops to support Sher Ali. But Mayo preferred to watch and wait, and advised Sher Ali to seek a settlement. Father and son were reconciled, and Mayo had secured peace with dominance.<br>
<br>Mayo also sent his own emissary to St Petersburg, instead of relying on the British ambassador, and secured a statement from the tsar that his government had no intention of extending his empire. A party of Russian troops which had crossed the Oxus was withdrawn, and the Russian government also promised not to meddle in Afghan affairs, and requested the government of India to define the frontiers of Afghanistan. The ruler of Yarkand sent an envoy to Calcutta for support and advice and Mayo decided to send a British mission to Yarkand. Trade with central Asia was promoted and a treaty concluded with the maharaja of Kashmir which provided Britain with transit facilities through his state. A boundary dispute between Afghanistan and Persia, with the possibility of increased influence for Russia, was avoided by persuading Persia to submit the case to arbitration.<br>
<br>Mayo's general policy was to create outworks of the British empire in the border states, and, while assuring them that there was no danger of annexation, to encourage them to seek British support and to ward off interference by any other European power. He hoped thereby to form a cordon of friendly and independent states around the Indian frontier, and claimed that, without firing a shot or moving a soldier, he had made British influence paramount in regions which had been for years the &#145;hard nut&#146; of Anglo-Indian politics.<br>
<br>Similarly, Mayo's government entertained cordial relations with the princes within the borders of India. Abstaining from needless intervention but not tolerating misgovernment, he sought to convince these princes that the British government sincerely desired to enable them to govern their states in such a manner as to secure the prosperity of the people and to maintain their own just rights. He encouraged the establishment of the Mayo College at Ajmer and the Rajkumar College in Kathiawar for the education of the sons of the chiefs and nobles in the Indian states.<h2>
<a name="Faminepublicworkspublicfinance"></a>Famine, public works, public finance</h2>In India directly under British administration conditions were far from normal during Mayo's tenure of office. Scarcity of food developed in some areas, and, before it deepened into famine, Mayo sanctioned a programme of public works to relieve unemployment, and provided advances for the sinking of wells. To public works generally he devoted much attention and took charge personally of the public works department, as well as of the foreign department. He sought to provide adequate defences for the principal Indian ports and effected large savings in the construction of barracks. Though his aim was to secure an equilibrium in the finances by reducing expenditure and augmenting the revenue, he did not retrench essential public works and expanded the scope of administrative activity. He wished India to be self-sufficient as far as possible and prospected for coal and iron. As private enterprise had failed to locate good iron ore, he wanted the government to show the way and take advantage of the construction of the railways by the state to utilize vast quantities of iron ore. But he was careful not to waste public funds and by 1872 had reduced expenditure by nearly &pound;5 million.<br>
<br>Complementary was the development of sources of revenue. The introduction of an income tax in 1869 led to no great increase of revenue and the financial crisis was severe. By reductions in expenditure on civil and military administration, the increase of salt duties in Madras and Bombay, and raising income tax in the middle of the financial year, Mayo converted the anticipated deficit into a small surplus, and the three following years produced an aggregate surplus of nearly &pound;6 million. He also decided to place a larger proportion of the charges for local requirements onto local resources, which not only reduced central expenditure, but met the political objective of entrusting a large number of Indians with local responsibility and the management of district affairs. Decentralization of finance was resisted by officials both at the centre and in the provinces, but Mayo overruled the opposition.<br>
<br>Mayo also implemented a reform, proposed by John Lawrence, of constructing extensions of the railway system with funds borrowed by the government, rather than entrusting such work to private companies with interest guaranteed by the state. He also adopted the narrow gauge of 3 feet 3 inches for the new state railways. He passed a land improvement act and an act to facilitate by government loans works of public utility in towns.<h2>
<a name="GrowingdisaffectioninIndia"></a>Growing disaffection in India</h2>Mayo cautioned the local governments to effect economy in expenditure and to tax the districts no more than was necessary. Yet he was not sufficiently sensitive to the fact that articulate India was still in an irritable mood. The increase in income tax from 1 to 2.5 per cent and then, in 1870, to 3.225 per cent was severely criticized. The articulate middle-class opposition did not make his task easier. The foreign policy of peace and friendship, commendable in itself, had no healthy effect within the country. Uneasiness, especially among the Muslims, became clear, and Mayo discerned that the task of successfully governing the Indian empire was daily becoming more difficult. A Wahabi conspiracy, seeking to cleanse Islam of idolatry and superstition, had been spreading over the years across northern India. As it was believed that a war against an infidel government could not be carried on by their Muslim subjects, the Wahabis gathered across the frontier. Emissaries toured India, especially Bengal, urging Muslims to join what officials termed a &#145;crescentade&#146; and contribute funds liberally. Many Wahabi agents were arrested and the Calcutta high court rejected their habeas corpus petitions. This did not seem to deter the conspirators and Wahabi dissent and the discontent caused by novel taxation fed on each other. Mayo, shaken in nerve, decided to reduce the income tax as much as possible; but he was confident that British military strength had so increased that no fresh mutiny need be feared and he blamed a few non-official Europeans for objecting to the income tax. Increase of expenditure and taxation was to him the only real danger. When the income tax was reduced by two-thirds in the budget of 1871, agitation against it ceased.<br>
<br>Disaffection, however, now spread among the Sikhs. The Kukas, in a similar vein to the Wahabis, called on all true believers to abandon temples and mosques, disregard distinctions of caste, and lead lives of abstinence. From such iconoclasm the movement drifted to a zeal for cleansing the Sikh faith and then to a yearning for the revival of Sikh political supremacy. But a policy of firmness tempered with moderation, as in Mayo's foreign policy, seemed to be effective, and in May 1871 he reported to the queen that tranquillity generally prevailed in India. Soon after, in September, he was dismayed when the officiating chief justice of the Calcutta high court was stabbed to death by a Pathan.<h2>
<a name="Mayosassassinationanditsbackground"></a>Mayo's assassination and its background</h2>Though no evidence was discovered to suggest that the murder had been organized, the belief that this was the first political murder in India since 1857 revived an atmosphere of panic. Mayo reassured the public that there was not the least ground for apprehension; all that was required was quiet, though active, watchfulness. In January 1872, when the Kukas attacked Maler Kotla in the Punjab, the provincial authorities had sixty-five men blown away from guns (a form of military execution). Mayo's government condemned these summary executions in the belief that such actions could be justified only by immediate and urgent necessity, which he did not believe existed in this case. Then, on 8 February 1872, Mayo himself was assassinated by a Muslim Afghan convict at Port Blair in the Andaman Islands, where he was on a tour of inspection. His body was returned to Ireland, where he was buried in state at Johnstown church, near Naas, in co. Kildare. His widow was appointed a lady of the bedchamber to Queen Victoria (1872&#150;4), and received a parliamentary annuity of &pound;1000, and a similar pension from the Council of India, together with the sum of &pound;20,000.<h2>
<a name="Assessment"></a>Assessment</h2>India was to Mayo his destined ground of service and success. He shared the Conservative belief in imperialism, and that racial superiority ensured permanent rule: a self-governing India was not even a distant possibility in a remote future. He did not, therefore, fear the long-term consequences of the promotion of education and the association of Indians with the administration. Believing that such discontent as existed among educated Indians was due to unemployment, he was willing to declare Indians eligible for all posts in the legal and judicial branches of the government, and most posts in the police service. But it was the duty of the British to provide India with efficient administration. &#145;The days of conquest are past; the age of improvement has begun&#146;, he publicly declared. The maintenance of peace, the removal of disaffection, and the promotion of prosperity were the best ways of strengthening the imperial connection. Mayo's objectives were a strong executive, paternal administration with no pretence of promoting self-government, and the maintenance of the rule of law. He worked extremely hard, had an easy command of men, and gave full attention to every problem of administration. He invited even junior provincial officers to be his guests and acquaint him with their work; and he undertook long tours to secure first-hand knowledge of men and matters. He had seen more of India in his three years than most civil servants managed in a lifetime, and knew more about India than any other viceroy until George Curzon at the end of the century. He encouraged popular representations to the central government, instructed the home department to inquire into every allegation of injustice, and reserved the right to communicate directly with any official. It was such energy, drive, and curiosity which led to the occasion of his death.<br>
