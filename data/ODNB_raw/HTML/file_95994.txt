<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Fitt,  Gerard Martin <span class="st"> [Gerry]</span></span>, Baron Fitt  (1926&#150;2005), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born in the Union Workhouse, 51 Lisburn Road, Belfast, on 9 April 1926, the son of Rose Martin, a thirty-year-old unmarried servant, and an unidentified father. Only the birth of an unnamed male infant was civilly registered by the master of the workhouse but the day after his birth he was baptized a Catholic there and given the name Gerald (later he preferred Gerard) by his natural mother before being handed over for adoption by George Patrick Fitt (1899&#150;1935) and his wife, Mary Ann, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Murphy (1901&#150;1989), who brought him up as a member of their own family. At that time they already had a daughter and a son. Later another son and two daughters were born. He had no more contact with his natural mother.<h2>
<a name="Childhoodmerchantnavyandmarriage"></a>Childhood, merchant navy, and marriage</h2>The Fitt family lived in grinding poverty in a spartan end-of-terrace house at 1 Welbeck Street, in the New Lodge area of Belfast. After his adoptive father, a council labourer, lost a leg in a work accident and died in 1935, Gerry Fitt toiled before and after school earning money by delivering groceries and selling newspapers to help the family make ends meet. Although his teachers at St Patrick's Christian Brothers School identified his ability, especially the fact that he was highly articulate for his age, an uninterested Fitt persuaded his adoptive mother to let him leave school at the earliest opportunity, which he did, in 1940. He intended to follow his elder brother, George, to sea when he was old enough and in the meantime drifted through a number of menial jobs, ending up as a soap-boy in a barber-shop in Donegall Street, Belfast.<br>
<br>One morning, in March 1942, while Gerry Fitt was lathering a customer for shaving, George arrived to say he had found him a job as a fireman on a coaster carrying coal from Salford to Belfast. Fitt promptly abandoned the customer in the chair and headed for the docks, but after a couple of return voyages the captain discovered that his crewman was under age and sacked him. Fitt then overstated his age by a year and volunteered for the merchant navy and, over the remaining wartime years, as a fireman shovelling coal deep in the ships' boiler rooms, he made a number of hazardous transatlantic crossings and trips to Russia in convoys under constant threat of attack. One return from Murmansk was especially perilous, when his ship suffered engine trouble and was forced to limp home without escort. Fitt saw many friends perish in vessels torpedoed by U-boats or sunk from the air, and he lost his adopted brother, George, who had gone on to join the Irish Guards and was killed in northern France in July 1944, shortly after the D-day landings.<br>
<br>Fitt's first-hand experience of war and the austere years immediately afterwards, when he travelled by sea to every continent and saw at first hand the ravages of conflict and the destruction and poverty left in its wake, were defining influences. During the long voyages he read avidly, once fighting for access to the officers' library on board ship because he wanted to read Hemingway rather than the cowboy novels favoured by his crewmates. He also developed a deep interest in Irish history and adopted as his lifelong inspiration James Connolly, the Scottish-born trade unionist who was executed by the British administration for his part in the 1916 Easter rising in Dublin.<br>
<br>On 5 November 1947, at the Roman Catholic Church of the Immaculate Conception in Crossgar, Fitt married Susan Gertrude (Ann) Doherty (1922&#150;1996), daughter of William Doherty, a tailor from Castlederg, co. Tyrone. They had six daughters, affectionately known as the Miss Fitts. With his growing family to support, Fitt gave up the sea in 1953 and settled permanently in Belfast, where between voyages he had already been tentatively drawn into local politics.<h2>
<a name="BelfastcorporationStormontandWestminster"></a>Belfast corporation, Stormont, and Westminster</h2>In 1958 Fitt was elected to Belfast corporation as a councillor for Dock ward and four years later won the Dock seat in the Northern Ireland parliament at Stormont, which he retained until Stormont was prorogued in 1972. His energetic representational activities on behalf of Unionist as well as nationalist electors undoubtedly helped in creating for him a unique cross-community political power-base transcending the traditional sectarian and political divides. Although he was publicly committed to the eventual and peaceful reunification of Ireland, the cornerstone of Fitt's political philosophy, which he described as &#145;Republican Labour&#146;, was to champion working-class rights, and he enhanced his reputation by successfully fighting cases against bureaucrats and in tribunals for his constituents regardless of their political or religious allegiance. Such was his reputation as an advocate that once, after he had collapsed at Stormont, an ambulance-man conveying him to hospital lobbied him about a problem and thrust a note with his address into Fitt's breast-pocket for attention when he recovered.<br>
<br>Fitt's political success was also very much attributable to his mastery of the black arts of Irish electioneering. Outplaying his Unionist rivals at their own game, he built up a small but formidable team of &#145;markers&#146;, who monitored newspaper death notices, house moves in every street, and apathetic sympathizers, to identify voters on the electoral roll who could be impersonated by &#145;pluggers&#146; on election days. These were men and women, kitted out from jumble sales, who changed their clothing and travelled from polling station to polling station stealing often crucial votes in close-run contests. Fitt was privately embarrassed by such activities but felt compelled to participate to deny any advantage to his opponents.<br>
<br>Fitt's real political breakthrough came in 1966 when he was returned to Westminster as MP for West Belfast. Becoming an MP provided him with personal financial security for the first time. Beforehand he mainly existed on state benefits or the proceeds of casual work and had to rely on donations from sympathizers and even borrow from family members and moneylenders to raise the cash deposits necessary to stand for election.<br>
<br>Fitt's victory sundered the long-standing Unionist grip on the turbulent West Belfast constituency, where sectarian differences counted far more than conventional political issues despite appallingly poor housing and serious social deprivation. Fitt's political priority therefore was not to campaign for a united Ireland, but instead to persuade the British government of the need to overrule the unchanging Unionist administration at Stormont and introduce a wide-ranging reform programme to improve social and economic conditions for all in Northern Ireland, and to bring to an end general discrimination against Catholics, notably in housing and public service employment. An equally fundamental demand was for an end to the rigging of electoral boundaries to maintain Unionist political control and for a universal franchise, later encapsulated in the slogan &#145;one man, one vote&#146;. In a widely acclaimed maiden speech at Westminster on 25 April 1966 Fitt said: &#145;I am not asking for preferential treatment, or making an outlandish request on behalf of my constituency; I am asking for exactly what British constituents have&#146;  (<span class="italic">Hansard 5C</span>, 727.442, 25 April 1966).<br>
<br>Fitt quickly proved to be a skilled propagandist adept at using the newspapers, radio, and television to promote his causes and, as an epic drinker, he found it easy to forge influential alliances with other politicians in the bars at Westminster. This contributed to his most lasting achievement at this time, which was to lead sympathetic Labour MPs, with the firm but private encouragement of the prime minister, Harold Wilson, in breaking the long-standing convention that internal Northern Ireland affairs were never scrutinized by the London parliament. As a result, for the first time since the partitioning of Ireland in the early 1920s, Fitt succeeded in focusing national attention on the activities and shortcomings of the Unionist administration in Belfast. Back home, as his reputation as a formidable constituency worker grew, people seeking assistance queued in the rooms and even along the stairs of his Belfast house at 85 Antrim Road, often round the clock. In his frequent absence his wife and daughters patiently served endless cups of tea until he returned.<br>
<br>At this time Fitt was significantly inspired by the ongoing campaign for civil rights by the black community in the United States, and he soon emerged at the vanguard of similar groups dedicated to highlighting injustice and discrimination in Northern Ireland. He became an even more widely recognized political figurehead after he was batoned by officers of the Royal Ulster Constabulary while leading a banned civil rights march in Londonderry on 5 October 1968. His picture, with blood streaming from a head wound, symbolized the outbreak of what became known as &#145;the troubles&#146;. As the growing violence propelled the problems of Northern Ireland to the forefront of the international news agenda Fitt was a much sought after proponent of the case for long overdue reform.<br>
<br>As civil disorder escalated and widespread terrorism engulfed Northern Ireland in the early 1970s Fitt was a central figure in the valiant but vain efforts to head off bloodshed and create a durable political solution. In 1970 he joined with other nationalists elected to Stormont on a civil rights ticket to form the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP), becoming its founding leader, but it was always an uneasy coalition, not least because he was an instinctive political loner. At an earlier stage of his career, when he formed what proved to be a short-lived alliance with a like-minded contemporary, a supporter remarked that two one-man parties had become one two-man party.<br>
<br>In 1973 the SDLP entered into the Sunningdale agreement, with Fitt, as deputy chief minister, joining the moderate Unionist, Brian Faulkner, in forming an unprecedented power-sharing executive. He was the first Catholic politician to occupy such a senior office at Stormont. But in May 1974, after scarcely five months in power, hardline Ulster loyalists mounted a general strike in protest at plans for a council of all Ireland. Some of Fitt's colleagues, most notably the forceful John Hume, would not compromise on the timescale for achieving this and, with the newly elected British Labour government unwilling to confront the strikers, to Fitt's lasting dismay, the bold experiment in political co-operation promptly collapsed. At the height of the crisis Fitt refused to join Faulkner in resigning and later liked to boast that for the succeeding seventeen hours until he was sacked by the British government he was effectively prime minister of Northern Ireland.<br>
<br>The episode nourished the estrangement between Fitt and the SDLP and he eventually left the party in 1979, because of his distaste for its uncompromising Irish nationalism and the ambivalence on the part of many party members towards the violence of the Irish Republican Army (IRA), which he found repugnant. At a time when considerable courage was required to do so, Fitt unreservedly condemned all violence. He had much first-hand experience of it. The first rioter to be shot dead by the British army was killed close to the front door of his home, and the first soldier to be murdered by the IRA was also shot close by. In 1973 Paddy Wilson, then his closest political ally, was abducted and murdered by loyalist killers. One troubled night in 1976 Fitt was forced to spring from bed to defend his family at gunpoint when a mob of IRA sympathizers broke into his home. As a result bullet-proof windows, reinforced doors, and other security measures were built into his home, which thereafter was always known as Fortress Fitt.<br>
<br>Fitt never forgave the British Labour Party, which he had staunchly supported since 1966, for failing to confront the 1974 loyalist workers' strike and on 28 March 1979 this lingering resentment heavily contributed to his refusal to support James Callaghan's Labour government in a confidence motion, which it lost by a single vote, and which paved the way for the Conservatives, led by Margaret Thatcher, to come to power.<br>
<br>Towards the end of 1980 a group of Provisional IRA prisoners at the Maze prison, near Belfast, began a hunger strike to the death, escalating their campaign to be classified as prisoners of war. What they wanted was a recognition by the British government that their offences&#151;murder, bombing, and shooting, the most serious in the criminal law&#151;were politically, not criminally, motivated. With his acute understanding of Irish history Fitt recognized from the very outset the strong emotional impact a hunger strike would have on the Catholic community throughout Ireland. &#145;If I was a shrewd politician&#146;, he told his family, &#145;I would keep my head down and say nothing. If I was a dishonest politician, I would support the prisoners and lead the inevitable protest marches through my West Belfast constituency to ensure my permanent popularity&#146;  (Ryder, 353). But Fitt decided he could not live with his principles or his conscience by following either of these courses.<br>
<br>Fully conscious of the consequences, that it might provoke the IRA into trying to shoot him or could lead to his political defeat at the ballot box, Fitt decided to make a speech in the House of Commons in London on 10 November 1980 condemning the Provisional IRA and the hunger strike, and advising the British government to make no concessions whatever to the prisoners. &#145;I had walked behind the coffins of far too many victims of the Provisional IRA and other terrorists to do anything else&#146;, he later explained  (Ryder, 353). The speech provoked immediate hostility, and one evening soon afterwards there was an eerie demonstration outside Fitt's Belfast home. With stones glancing off the brickwork and paint tins squelching against the fortifications around the front door, he listened to the steady thump of tramping feet, shouts, and the intermittent beating of a drum.<blockquote>I put the room lights out and slipped open the curtain. Outside in the darkness there was a large crowd, some holding flaming torches. In the flickering torchlight I could pick out some familiar faces, people who had been among my staunchest political supporters, until then. That demonstration was a decisive turning point in my life as a politician and marked the beginning of the end of my career in the House of Commons. (Ryder, 354)</blockquote>Fitt continued to oppose the ongoing IRA hunger strikes at the Maze prison, and within a year he lost his seat on Belfast city council as Sinn F&eacute;in, the political front for the Provisional IRA, capitalized on the emotions raised by the deaths of ten hunger strikers and steadily emerged as a significant political force on the Catholic side. In June 1983, when a British general election was called, Fitt's uncompromising stand against the IRA, as he expected, cost him the West Belfast seat at Westminster. He was, though, especially embittered that the SDLP, now led by John Hume, helped to undermine his remaining support by running against him, and that so many of his erstwhile supporters voted to eject him from parliament in favour of Gerry Adams, the leader of Sinn F&eacute;in, whose methods and activities so revolted him that he had come to hate the word &#145;republican&#146;.<br>
<br>Altogether over three stormy decades Fitt had fought nineteen elections and lost only three: his first Belfast council poll in 1956; and his final contests, for the Belfast council in 1981 and Westminster in 1983. At one time he held an unparalleled triple mandate, simultaneously serving as a Belfast councillor and member of both the Stormont and Westminster parliaments. He was a uniquely colourful, unorthodox political character once described as having the back-slapping style of a minor American senator. Public or parliamentary speeches were always delivered off-the-cuff, reflecting his shrewd political instincts and highly retentive memory. He rarely wrote letters, usually conducting his business on the telephone or, more often, holding court in public houses where he was an unrivalled raconteur. He once said that his filing cabinets were the inside pockets of his jackets and his desk the nearest window ledge in Belfast city hall, Stormont, or Westminster.<h2>
<a name="HouseofLordsandfinalyears"></a>House of Lords, and final years</h2>Fitt's growing unpopularity had led to more sustained attacks on his house, and immediately after the election, while he and his wife were absent in London, Republican sympathizers succeeded in breaking in and setting it alight, this time causing destruction on such a scale that he had to move out permanently. Soon afterwards he bought a flat at 25 Vincent Square in London. Fitt then defied nationalist convention by accepting, in the same year, a life peerage. He really wanted to be known as Lord Fitt of Dock but because of the rules he was created Baron Fitt, of Bell's Hill, from the co. Down townland where his adopted mother had lived after being evacuated from Belfast during the Second World War.<br>
<br>In the House of Lords, as he had done throughout his political career, Fitt maintained a non-sectarian political stance and, from the crossbenches, earned widespread admiration for his courage in promoting reconciliation and speaking out trenchantly against the ongoing violence in Northern Ireland. As the 1990s &#145;peace process&#146; developed Fitt was appalled that so many former terrorists were being elected to public office, and he especially resented the very public emergence of John White, who had murdered Paddy Wilson, as a prominent advocate of the Ulster loyalist cause. Fitt doubted that the ascendant hardliners on both sides had any appetite for the great compromises that would be necessary to create lasting peace and stability, and feared that the long-standing political intransigence would prevail &#145;until God sees Fitt&#146; and beyond. Thus he remained cynical about the prospects for agreement in Northern Ireland until the end of his life.<br>
<br>In 2005 Fitt suffered declining health and when he developed serious heart trouble in July that year his daughters moved him to Ashford in Kent, where three of them lived. He died at 58 Lower Queens Road, Ashford, on 26 August 2005, of heart failure, and, after requiem masses at Westminster Cathedral and St Joseph's Church, Crossgar, on 31 August, was buried beside his wife in the churchyard of St Lawrence's at Godmersham, Kent. He was survived by five daughters, one daughter having predeceased him.<br>
