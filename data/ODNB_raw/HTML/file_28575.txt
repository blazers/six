<span class="headword">Wallis, Sir  Provo William Parry</span>  (1791&#150;1892), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, only son of Provo Featherstone Wallis, chief clerk to the naval commissioner at Halifax, Nova Scotia, was born at Halifax on 12 April 1791. His mother was a daughter of William Lawlor, major in the 1st battalion of the Halifax regiment. It has been suggested that he was related to <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28578/', "Captain Samuel Wallis")</script>, which is not improbable. It is more certain that he was the grandson of Provo Wallis, a carpenter in the navy, who, after serving through the Seven Years' War, was in 1776 carpenter of the <i>Eagle</i>, flagship of Lord Howe in North America, and appointed by him on 3 March 1778 master shipwright of the naval yard at New York. After the peace he was transferred to Halifax.<br>
<br>At an early age Wallis was sent to England, and while there at school his name was on the books of several different ships on the Halifax station. He actually entered the navy in October 1804 on the frigate <i>Cleopatra</i> (32 guns), commanded by Sir Robert Laurie. On her way out to the West Indies on 16 February 1805 the <i>Cleopatra</i>, after a gallant action, was captured by the French frigate <i>Ville de Milan</i> (40 guns), which was herself so much damaged that a week later (23 February) she surrendered without resistance to the <i>Leander</i> (50 guns). The <i>Cleopatra</i> was recaptured at the same time, and Laurie was reinstated in the command. Shortly afterwards Laurie was appointed to the <i>Ville de Milan</i>, commissioned as the <i>Milan</i>, and Wallis went with him.<br>
<br>In November 1806 Wallis was appointed acting lieutenant of the <i>Triumph</i>, with Sir Thomas Masterman Hardy, and on 30 November 1808 was officially promoted lieutenant of the brig <i>Curieux</i>, which on 3 November 1809 was wrecked on the coast of Guadeloupe. After one or two changes he was appointed in January 1812 to the <i>Shannon</i>, commanded by Captain Philip Bowes Vere Broke. He was her second lieutenant in the brilliant capture of the <i>Chesapeake</i> on 1 June 1813, and, being left&#151;by the death of the first lieutenant and Broke's dangerous wound&#151;commanding officer, took the <i>Shannon</i> and her prize to Halifax. The prisoners, being considerably more numerous than the crew of the <i>Shannon</i>, were secured in handcuffs, which they themselves had provided. On 9 July Wallis was promoted commander, and, returning to England in the <i>Shannon</i> in October, was appointed in January 1814 to the sloop <i>Snipe</i>. On 19 October 1817, Wallis married Juliana, second daughter of Archdeacon Roger Massey; they had two daughters. On 12 August 1819 he was advanced to post rank.<br>
<br>From 1824 to 1826 Wallis commanded the <i>Niemen</i> on the Halifax station; in 1838&#150;9 the <i>Madagascar</i> in the West Indies and off Vera Cruz; and from 1843 to 1846 the <i>Warspite</i> in the Mediterranean. He married, secondly, on 21 July 1849, Jemima Mary Gwyne, a daughter of General Sir Robert Thomas Wilson, governor of Gibraltar. On 27 August 1851 he was promoted rear-admiral, and in 1857 was appointed commander-in-chief on the south-east coast of South America, from where he was recalled on his promotion to vice-admiral on 10 September 1857. He had no further service, but was made a KCB on 18 May 1860 and promoted admiral on 2 March 1863, rear-admiral of the United Kingdom in 1869, and vice-admiral of the United Kingdom in 1870. He became GCB on 24 May 1873 and was made admiral of the fleet on 11 December 1877. By a special clause in Childers's retirement scheme of 1870 it was provided that the names of those old officers, who had commanded a ship during the French wars, should be retained on the active list, and the few days that Wallis was in command of the <i>Shannon</i> brought him within this rule. His name was thus retained on the active list until his death.<br>
<br>During the latter part of his life Wallis resided mainly at Funtington House, Funtington, near Chichester, in full enjoyment of his faculties, and reading or writing with ease until a few months before his death. On his 100th birthday (12 April 1891) he received congratulations from many, including the queen and the captain and officers of the <i>Shannon</i>. He died at home at Funtington House on 13 February 1892 and was buried with military honours at Funtington on 18 February. Wallis was an officer of great good fortune; he had no great merits but by the death of the <i>Shannon</i>'s first lieutenant and sheer longevity he became a celebrity.<br>
