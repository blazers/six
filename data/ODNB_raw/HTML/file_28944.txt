<span class="headword">Webster,  John</span>  (1611&#150;1682), <span class="occ">schoolmaster and polemicist</span>, was born on 3 February 1611 at Thornton on the Hill in the parish of Coxwold, Yorkshire, the son of Edward Webster. Claims that he was a student at Cambridge appear to be without foundation. In the early 1630s he studied chemistry under the Hungarian Johannes Banfi Hunyades (1576&#150;1646), chemist to the earl of Pembroke, living in Whitechapel. Chemistry and medicine, together with teaching, were to be his lifelong occupations. In 1632 he was ordained as a minister by Thomas Morton, bishop of Durham, and was appointed curate to the parish of Kildwick, near Skipton, in Yorkshire. In 1637 Webster was deprived of his living, possibly for his sympathies with the Grindletonians, a radical sect which originated in his part of the Yorkshire dales. As curate of Kildwick, he detected a case of imposture connected with accusations of witchcraft.<br>
<br>In 1643 Webster was appointed master of the grammar school of Clitheroe and from 1660 to 1662 served as governor in the same school. He left his post for two periods: in 1647, when he was intruded as minister in the village of Mitton, apparently with no income from the parish, and in 1648, when he served as surgeon in the parliamentary regiment of Colonel Shuttleworth. In 1649 he was admitted as a Clitheroe burgess and, with the exception of a short stay in London in 1653, he spent the rest of his life at Clitheroe.<h2>
<a name="ActivitiesduringtheCommonwealth"></a>Activities during the Commonwealth</h2>Webster's importance rests on his participation in the debates concerning the reconstruction of religious and social life during the Commonwealth. In sermons delivered in London at All Hallows, Lombard Street, and at Whitehall, in June 1653, he attacked the idea of a professional clergy, claiming that ministers were not created by the university or by the civil magistrate, whose powers in spiritual affairs he firmly opposed. A member of no sect, he advocated the right of free interpretation of the scriptures and unambiguously denied that human learning could have any role in ensuring grace and redemption. In his sermons he dealt with two themes which were to be developed in his subsequent works, the criticism of traditional learning and the view that the Devil is no physical agent. He maintained that the biblical references to the Devil are to be interpreted as a synonym of the depraved condition of the human soul.<br>
<br>In October 1653, together with William Erbery (whose works he edited in 1658), and John Cardell, who acted as moderator, Webster took part in a dispute at All Hallows on the question of who ordered ministers. The opposite side comprised a Presbyterian, an Independent, and a Baptist. According to the report published by the <span class="italic">Mercurius Politicus</span> of 13&#150;20 October 1653, the dispute was particularly lively, but Webster found this report false and somewhat offensive. The anonymous author of the report had stated that Webster and his associates wanted to &#145;knock down Learning and the Ministry&#146;. Webster replied that he was not &#145;an enemy to humane, or acquired learning, as it is considered in natural, civil, artificial, or moral respect, but as it is considered in a theological respect&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Picture of Mercurius Politicus</span>, 1653, 6). Religious toleration and opposition to an established state-supported church are reasserted in <span class="italic">The Saints Guide</span> and in <span class="italic">The Judgement Set, and the Bookes Opened</span> (1654), the latter being a collection of his sermons. His views were attacked in G. W[ither]., <span class="italic">The Modern States-Man</span> (1654), a work advocating the benefits of human learning for the understanding of the sacred text.<br>
<br>The reform of learning is the topic of Webster's controversial <span class="italic">Academiarum examen</span> (1654), which was dedicated to Major-General John Lambert, to whom he had sent a draft of the work a few years before its publication. In the dedicatory epistle (dated 21 October 1653) he attacked Episcopalians, Presbyterians, and Independents alike, and declared that he was no recipient of tithes or state payment. He went on to launch a fierce attack on the English universities, both for their claim to provide the training for the clergy and for their scholastic curricula. He put forward his own plan, which was generally Baconian in its inspiration and aims, but also relied on a wide spectrum of more recent philosophical writings.<br>
<br>The reformed universities, according to Webster, had to promote experimental and utilitarian learning, which should include alchemy and natural magic, which he vindicated against the impostors' misuse. His philosophical views, as expressed in his project of reform, are eclectic: besides Baconianism and Helmontian iatrochemistry, he also supported the theosophy of Fludd and Boehme, and the atomism of Digby and Gassendi. Along with Van Helmont, he attacked the Aristotelians' overestimate of human reason and stressed the role of divine illumination as the foundation of true learning. Although he himself knew and taught Hebrew and Greek, he dismissed the study of languages as useless to the understanding of the scriptures, which, he claimed, could only be achieved by the aid of the Spirit of God. On the other hand, he maintained that the search for natural languages and the study of the Paracelsian doctrine of signatures were to be included in the reformed curricula.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">Academiarum examen</span> aroused vehement reaction from the Oxford academics John Wilkins and Seth Ward, and from the Presbyterian writer Thomas Hall. Ward published his reply to Webster, <span class="italic">Vindiciae academiarum</span> (1654), anonymously, but the introduction was written by Wilkins. According to Wilkins and Ward, Webster was ignorant both of the sciences he wanted to promote, and of the actual state of the universities he wanted to reform. The universities, they maintained, were no longer dominated by Aristotelianism, but had already adopted the new experimental philosophy. In addition, they criticized Webster for having contaminated the &#145;sound&#146; experimental philosophy with alchemy, astrology, cabbala, Rosicrucianism, and magic. Wilkins also engaged himself in a defence of academic teaching for the training of ministers. Hall, in his <span class="italic">Histrio-Mastix: a Whip for Webster</span> (1654), denounced Webster (whom he mistook for the homonymous dramatist) as a leveller, a familist, and a magician.<br>
<br>Although he was licensed as a medical practitioner by the archbishop of York in 1661, Webster was already successfully practising medicine in the early 1650s. In 1654 he was paid the considerable sum of &pound;42 by a Henry Waite for a three-year medical apprenticeship to him. Webster's life at Clitheroe was rather prosperous. He had acquired substantial property, much of it land sequestered from royalists. He was able to purchase apparatus for his chemical investigations, and a substantial number of books, which, at the time of his death, reached approximately 1660 volumes. A somewhat litigious man, he was engaged in disputes and conflicts for many years. In 1654 he had a dispute with Thomas Jolly, an Independent minister. On 2 November 1657 Webster appealed to John Lambert for assistance in a suit brought against him by one Robert Inman, who was claiming compensation for the loss of an animal requisitioned by Webster during the second civil war. In 1658, as a result of a judicial inquiry, he was arrested and had his books and papers confiscated.<br>
<br>In 1657 Webster became in-bailiff of Clitheroe, a post he held from October 1657 to October 1659, then in 1665 and again in 1675. It is apparent that his appointment as a bailiff was opposed by, among others, Roger Keynon, Thomas Alston, and Edmund Robinson, on the grounds that Webster was guilty of political and legal abuses, heretic opinions, and lax morals.<br>
<br>Webster's attacks on the state church and its clergy, on ceremonies, and on the universities which trained the clergy, had much in common with the Quakers' views. An undated letter in Friends' House in London shows that Thomas Lowson tried to persuade Webster to join the Quakers. However, in the late 1650s disillusionment and disappointment over the fate of the English revolution seemed to prevail in Webster's mind. In his introduction to the <span class="italic">Testimony of William Erbery</span> (1658) he expressed his pessimistic view along these lines: &#145;the restitution of all things is yet afarr off; the Saints running from Mountain to Hill, is rather an exchange of one bondage for another then any reall redemption from the Ancient yoke&#146;.<h2>
<a name="LifeaftertheRestoration"></a>Life after the Restoration</h2>After the Restoration, Webster's behaviour seems to have been inspired by loyalty to the new regime. In 1661 he voted for Ambrose Pudsay, the royalist candidate to the Cavalier Parliament. His appointment as magistrate for Clitheroe in 1665 was possible because he conformed to the restored church. In the dedicatory epistle of his <span class="italic">Metallographia</span> (addressed to Prince Rupert) he referred to the Royal Society as &#145;one of the happy fruits of His Majesties blessed and miraculous Restoration&#146;  (<span class="italic">Metallographia</span>, 1671). In the <span class="italic">Displaying of Supposed Witchcraft</span> (1677) he styled the Quakers as fanatics and rebuked those who pretended to be guided by the Spirit in their own interpretations of the scriptures. It is apparent that in the 1670s his religious views underwent a substantial change and his previous radicalism was abandoned. None the less, he restated his opposition to the notion that human reason could be of some help in interpreting the scriptures.<br>
<br>Webster married, on 6 November 1667, Elizabeth (<i>b</i>. 1627), daughter of Roger Aspinall of Clitheroe. They had no children. His wife survived him and was married to the Revd William Bankes of Mitton for twenty years. Webster's life at Clitheroe was isolated, though not entirely separated from the world of learning. He was able to pursue his chemical and mineralogical studies and was aware of the latest news in science and philosophy both in England and on the continent. He corresponded with a number of natural philosophers and is very likely to have been responsible for <span class="italic">The Last Will and Testament of Basil Valentine</span>, an English translation which was published in 1670.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">The Metallographia, or, An History of Metals</span> is Webster's major scientific achievement. (The book was dated 1671, though it may have been published during the previous two years.) As attested by internal evidence, the work, containing references to a huge volume of alchemical, chemical, and mineralogical literature, was completed after 1666. Webster's professed end was that of stimulating metallurgical knowledge and the exploitation of mines in England. The work, however, deals with a wide range of topics, including a vindication of the ancient origins of alchemical knowledge, the generation of metals, their use in medicine and their transmutation. Helmontian chemical views are strictly linked with the corpuscular theory of matter, which is mainly based on the works of Robert Boyle. The <span class="italic">Metallographia</span> had a noticeable impact on the world of learning. It was reviewed in the <span class="italic">Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society</span> of 1670 and in the <span class="italic">Journal des S&ccedil;avans</span> of 1678. John Beale praised it in a letter to Henry Oldenburg of January 1671, while D. G. Morhof (<span class="italic">De metallorum transmutatione</span>, 1673) dismissed it as scarcely original . Webster's proficiency in chemistry was extolled by a Durham schoolmaster, Peter Nelson, in a letter to Oldenburg of 25 March 1671, where he spoke of him as &#145;a man of more than ordinary acuteness and very fit for your Correspondence&#146;  (<span class="italic">Correspondence of Henry Oldenburg</span>, 7.535). With a few exceptions, historians now recognize Webster's <span class="italic">Metallographia</span> as a valuable contribution to seventeenth-century science of metals.<br>
<br>Webster's last work was <span class="italic">The Displaying of Supposed Witchcraft</span> (1677), a criticism of the traditional demonology. It is apparent that material for it had been collected for several decades and the work was completed by 1674, but initially it failed to gain an imprimatur, apparently because of opposition from the ecclesiastical authorities. Webster had asked for the support of his friend and correspondent Martin Lister, to whom he sent a draft of the work in 1674. He also sent a copy to the Royal Society, which was forwarded by Oldenburg to Hooke, who read it on 19 March 1675. In the event, <span class="italic">The Displaying of Supposed Witchcraft</span> was published in 1677 with the imprimatur of the society's vice-president, Sir Jonas Moore, dated 29 June 1676, and was dedicated to the justices of the peace in the West Riding of Yorkshire. The work, which opens with a vindication of freedom in philosophical matters, is aimed at answering the arguments in favour of the existence of witchcraft held by Meric Casaubon and by Joseph Glanvill. Although he denied that demons have a pure spiritual nature, Webster stated that men can only have mental, not physical, contact with the Devil. He maintains that what is commonly taken as a sign of possession is to be imputed to melancholy, imposture, or ignorance. Having denied the Devil's capacity to intervene in the natural world, Webster engages in a vindication of natural magic, which is largely indebted to Van Helmont's arguments. <span class="italic">The Displaying of Supposed Witchcraft</span> was attacked by Glanvill and by Henry More (<span class="italic">Sadducismus triumphatus &hellip; with a Letter of Dr. H. More</span>, 1681), who asserted the real existence of witches. Webster's demonological views were also attacked by Benjamin Camfield, a Leicester cleric, who accused him of denying the existence of spiritual substances  (<span class="italic">A Theological Discourse &hellip; also an Appendix Containing some Reflexions upon Mr. Websters Displaying &hellip;</span>, 1678).<br>
<br>Webster died at Clitheroe on 18 June 1682 and was buried there on 21 June 1682. In his will, which he made in January 1680, he left his goods to his wife, Elizabeth, and after her death to his nephews Edward Webster, John Webster, and Richard Webster, and 40<i>s</i>. to the poor of Grindleton. His will mentions chirurgical and chemical instruments, as well as his library. An epitaph written by himself is in the parish church of Clitheroe.<br>
