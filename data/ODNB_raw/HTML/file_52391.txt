<span class="headword">Browning,  Louisa</span>  (1807&#150;1887), <span class="occ">school proprietor</span>, was born in London, the sixth child and fourth daughter of Robert Browning (1749&#150;1833), principal clerk of the bank-stock division at the Bank of England, and his second wife, Jane Smith (1771&#150;1848), whom he married in 1794. Robert's eldest son by his first marriage to Margaret Tittle (1754&#150;1789), also Robert, was the father of Robert Browning, the poet; thus Louisa was half-aunt to the poet, with whom she maintained cordial but not close relations.<br>
<br>Equipped by her father with an initial capital of &pound;200 Louisa set up a boarding-school for ladies at 4 Dartmouth Row, in Blackheath. She was assisted by her sister Sarah, and another sister, Jemima, also appears to have helped out before her marriage in 1845. Among the pupils were Sophie and Annie Crow, daughters of an alkali manufacturer from Gateshead, and five of the six daughters of Newson Garrett, corn and coal merchant of Aldeburgh, including the future Dr Elizabeth Garrett Anderson and Dame Millicent Garrett Fawcett. Elizabeth met Emily Davies for the first time when staying with the Crows in the school holidays.<br>
<br>The Browning establishment seems to have had more pretension and less rigour than some other successful schools of this period. Elizabeth Garrett recalled &#145;the stupidity of the teachers &hellip; with shudders&#146; and Miss Browning's insistence that French was the language of all school transactions meant that she became fluent in the language &#145;as spoken in Blackheath&#146;  (Anderson, 33). At least the experience did not destroy her appetite for learning. Millicent Garrett, on the other hand, recalled Louisa Browning as &#145;a born teacher&#146;, writing approvingly of her thoroughness and method. She noted also her refusal to be overawed by institutionalized religion and her distinct unconventionality in refusing to have needlework taught in her school. This, Louisa thought, should be taught at home, and if she saw a girl with a needle in her hand, &#145;would call out in her most commanding tones, &#147;A guinea a stitch, my dear, a guinea a stitch!&#148;&#146;  (Fawcett, 38). Both Elizabeth and Millicent agreed on Louisa's ample size, powerful presence, her passion for bright colours in dress, and her enthusiasm for fresh air. By the time Millicent left in 1862 the school had changed hands, and Louisa and her sister Sarah retired to live at 1 Maitland Park Crescent on Haverstock Hill in north London. Louisa died there on 6 September 1887.<br>
