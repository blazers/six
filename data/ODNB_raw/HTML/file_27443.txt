<span class="headword">Tighe <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Blachford]</span>,  Mary</span>  (1772&#150;1810), <span class="occ">poet</span>, was born on 9 October 1772 in Dublin, the daughter of William Blachford (<i>d</i>. 1773?), a Church of Ireland clergyman and librarian, and his wife, Theodosia Tighe (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1740, <i>d</i>. in or after 1810), a granddaughter of the first earl of Darnley. Theodosia Blachford, an acquaintance of John Wesley, was active in the Methodist movement in Ireland, and she gave her daughter a strict religious upbringing. On 6 October 1793 Mary Blachford married Henry Tighe (1768&#150;1836), who was her first cousin and a member of the Irish parliament for Inistioge, co. Kilkenny, until the union of the parliaments. Relatively little is known about the Tighes' marriage, which remained childless, but it is said to have been unhappy.<br>
<br>In the early years of the nineteenth century, the couple spent time in London, where Mary Tighe had some literary friends, most notably Thomas Moore, who was an early admirer of her writing. Although she began writing poetry before her marriage, Tighe published nothing until 1805, when her major work, <span class="italic">Psyche</span> (probably begun in 1801 and completed by 1803), was privately printed. A long allegorical poem in Spenserian stanzas, <span class="italic">Psyche</span> was admired by a number of Tighe's literary contemporaries, including Moore, who praised it in one of his own poems. Keats, even while claiming in 1818 to have outgrown his earlier admiration for Tighe's work, was influenced by <span class="italic">Psyche</span>.<br>
<br>In 1805 Tighe endured a dangerous attack of the consumption from which she had already been suffering for at least a year. According to Thomas Moore, she had &#145;a very serious struggle for life&#146; in February 1805 and was still so ill in August that she was &#145;ordered to the Madeiras&#146;. Moore himself was convinced that &#145;another <i>winter</i> will inevitably be her death&#146;  (<span class="italic">Memoirs</span>, 1.86, 90), but in fact Tighe lived for another five years, spending the last few months of her life as an invalid at her brother-in-law's estate at Woodstock, co. Wicklow, Ireland, where she died on 24 March 1810. She was buried in Inistioge church, co. Kilkenny.<br>
<br>Following Tighe's death, <span class="italic">Psyche</span> was republished in 1811 in an edition which included some previously unpublished poems, many of them laments for pleasures irretrievably lost because of illness, or poems expressing religious anxieties and fears of death. In her final poem, dated December 1809, Tighe writes that her<blockquote>
<div>soul &hellip; with agonizing grasp<br>
</div>
<div>Of terror and regret,<br>
</div>
<div>To all in life its love would clasp<br>
</div>
<div>Clings close and closer yet.<br>
</div> (<span class="italic">Psyche, with other Poems</span>, 308)</blockquote>(An editorial note in the 1811 volume reassures readers that Tighe's &#145;fears of death were perfectly removed before she quit this scene of trial and suffering&#146;  (ibid., 311)). It was this edition, which was probably the one read by Keats, which established Tighe's literary reputation. While Tighe's work had, according to the 1811 preface, already circulated fairly widely and won her the admiration of readers beyond her immediate friends, the first public response to <span class="italic">Psyche</span> appeared in the <span class="italic">Quarterly Review's</span> article on the 1811 edition. The review combined some high literary praise (it would not &#145;be difficult to extract from the poem many passages as flowing and as musical as the finest in the <span class="roman">Fairy Queen</span>&#146;) with tributes to the poet's feminine delicacy and sentimental reflections on her premature death  (<span class="italic">QR</span>, 5, 1811, 478). Despite the bleakness of many of the short poems in the 1811 volume, in much of the nineteenth-century writing on Tighe there is a tendency to turn her into an exemplar of patiently (and picturesquely) long-suffering femininity, a tendency exemplified most famously in Felicia Hemans's tribute to her, &#145;The Grave of a Poetess&#146;: Hemans concludes her meditation on her Inistioge church monument by wondering<blockquote>
<div>Where couldst thou fix on mortal ground<br>
</div>
<div>Thy tender thoughts and high?<br>
</div>
</blockquote>Besides this poem, Hemans wrote at least two other tributes to Tighe, &#145;Lines for the Album at Rosanna&#146; and &#145;Written after Visiting a Tomb&#146;. Another nineteenth-century admirer wrote that admiration for <span class="italic">Psyche</span> was increased by sympathetic identification with &#145;the young and beautiful poetess&#146; whose poem &#145;was not more tenderly beautiful to the imagination than herself&#146;  (Howitt, 282). Mary Tighe also wrote a novel, <span class="italic">Selena</span>, which is unpublished, and some other poems are included in the privately printed volume <span class="italic">Mary: a Series of Reflections during 20 Years</span> (1811), edited by William Tighe, the author's cousin and brother-in-law. <span class="italic">Psyche</span> went into numerous nineteenth-century editions, but like many other women poets of her generation, Tighe was almost entirely overlooked in literary criticism and histories for much of the twentieth century, until her work was republished and started to be anthologized again in the 1990s.<br>
