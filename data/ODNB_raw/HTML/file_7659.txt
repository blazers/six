<span class="headword">Dillon, Sir  Lucas</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1592), <span class="occ">judge</span>, was the eldest son and heir of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7661/', "Sir Robert Dillon (d. 1579?)")</script>, of Newtown Trim, co. Meath, chief justice of common pleas, and his wife, Elizabeth, daughter of Edward Barnewall of Crickstown. He was probably born after 1530 and entered the Middle Temple in 1551. On his return to Ireland he resided at Moymet Castle, which he built 3 miles north-west of Trim. His first wife was Jane, daughter of James Bathe, chief baron of the exchequer from 1535 to 1570.<br>
<br>Dillon took office as the queen's principal solicitor in 1565 and in 1566 became, like his father, attorney-general. In 1566 he was a commissioner to hear civil causes in Kilkenny, and he commended the lord deputy, Sir Henry Sidney, to Sir William Cecil in 1568 for expanding the judicial presence in Ireland beyond the pale, citing the &#145;marvellous&#146; resort of litigants to the council  (TNA: PRO, SP 63/26/68). He was sent to London in 1569 with bills for the parliament, and the following year he explained to the queen the need for a university in Dublin. Dillon returned to Ireland as the new chief baron of the exchequer in 1570 on the nomination of Sidney, succeeding his father-in-law. He was a constitutional moderate and maintained a long correspondence with Cecil, noting in 1570 &#145;that it stode better with good polecy to procede by degrees (as wherein stode safetie) then to take in hande so moche as we should not be hable to welde&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 63/30/130).<br>
<br>Dillon was the most loyal of the Old English privy councillors and Sidney knighted him in 1575 at Drogheda, calling him &#145;<i>meus fidelis</i> <i>Lucas</i>&#146;  (Ball, 212). Sir Lucas was a commissioner of the court of wards and his merit as a councillor was acknowledged in 1572 by Fitzwilliam, who recommended him to replace his father on the junior bench. Sidney sought the chief justiceship for him, whereas the lord chancellor, Gerard, proclaimed his honesty, &#145;though he dealeth and conveyeth conninglye&#146;  (LPL, Carew MS 628, fol. 312), and employed him in the hotly contested cess controversy in 1577 to examine legal precedents for purveyance. Dillon argued before the privy council in 1578 that the cess was traditionally authorized by the grand council and thus required the sanction of the leading palesmen. Yet he was lauded in 1577 by Sir Nicholas Malby for his support of the cess on a badly divided council, and by Sir Edward Waterhouse for his service to the crown and his willingness to afford &#145;a good table in town and campe&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 63/72/147). He attended Sidney on numerous expeditions to apprehend and punish Irish rebels, such as those who aided Rory Oge O'More in 1578.<br>
<br>Dillon joined Lord Justice Pelham in Philipstown in 1579 at the outset of the Desmond rebellion of 1579&#150;83, and in 1580 journeyed with him to Munster. In May 1581 he was proposed as a candidate for the vacant lord chancellorship, but his rival for the post, Archbishop Adam Loftus, denounced him as corrupt in 1582 and won the post for himself. Dillon was nominated chief justice of queen's bench in 1583, but his reputation was compromised by an Irish exile who informed that he kept a Catholic priest named Charles, and was &#145;catholick at hart&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 63/88/60). During the multiple crises of the Desmond rebellion the new chief justice of common pleas, Nicholas Nugent, was accused of supporting his cousin's insurrection in the pale, conspiring to take Dublin Castle, and planning to ambush Dillon on his way to hold sessions at Mullingar. At a special tribunal on 4 April 1582, convened out of term and held at Trim, Dillon and other councillors, including his cousin <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7662/', "Sir Robert Dillon (c.1540&#150;1597)")</script> of Riverston, sat as judges when the chief justice was tried for treason before a Meath jury. Nugent protested both the exceptional venue and the intervention of his adversaries, complaining that only one, tainted, witness gave testimony. Dillon was accused of bullying the jurors into reversing their verdict, and Nugent was hanged at Trim two days later.<br>
<br>After the departure of Lord Deputy Grey in 1582 Dillon helped to arrange the trial by battle in the yard of Dublin Castle between two O'Connor chieftains in 1583, a cynical attempt to kill off the leaders of a prominent Gaelic family. The appointment of Sir John Perrot as lord deputy on 4 January 1584 signalled a return to reform, and Dillon became one of Perrot's leading supporters on the faction-ridden Irish council. He joined Perrot on progresses to Ulster and Munster, and was sent to England for the required sanctioning of an Irish parliament, returning at the head of 400 troops on 6 March 1585 and bringing the parliamentary robes for the viceroy. Dillon and Nicholas White, master of the rolls, attempted to steer Perrot's ambitious reform of the cess through parliament, but the queen rebuked her intemperate chief governor for toleration of recusancy and she encouraged Loftus and his allies to exclude Old English councillors from most confidential business after 1586. Although named a commissioner for the plantation of Munster on 26 April 1587, Dillon was later implicated in the charges of coddling recusants brought against Perrot by the new lord deputy, Sir William Fitzwilliam, in 1590. In 1592 Sir Lucas and Sir Robert Dillon were accused of instigating Sir Brian O'Rourke's rebellion in Connaught, charges probably inspired by the Nugents. The crucial involvement of moderate voices in Irish government was effectively silenced on the departure of Perrot, and after Dillon's death, which took place in Dublin in 1592, he was replaced by Sir Robert Napier of Dorset, completing the practical exclusion of the Old English.<br>
<br>As a loyal privy councillor and a key member of its inner circle, Dillon enjoyed the patronage of several chief governors. He became steward of the royal manors near Dublin in 1574. After the death of his first wife, Jane, he married Marion (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Sharl), widow of Sir Christopher Barnewall of Turvey, in 1575. He succeeded his father as steward of Kilkenny West in 1578, and in 1580 inherited the profitable estates at Newtown, joining them with the dissolved priory of St Mary in Trim. He resided in St Nicholas Street when in Dublin, and he was buried in 1592 in the parish church at Newtown Trim, where his fine Renaissance altar tomb, with effigies of Lucas and Jane, may still be seen. In 1589 Dillon had also erected a marble monument at Lusk in honour of his second wife's first husband. He and his first wife had seven sons and five daughters, including their eldest son, James (<i>d</i>. 1642), who was granted livery of his father's lands on 8 April 1594. James was created Baron Dillon on 24 January 1620 and earl of Roscommon on 5 April 1622. Another son, John, married the daughter of Sir William Sarsfield of Lucan, co. Dublin.<br>
