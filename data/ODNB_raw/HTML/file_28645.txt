<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Waltham,  John</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1395), <span class="occ">administrator and bishop of Salisbury</span>, was born at Waltham near Grimsby, Lincolnshire, where his parents, John (an esquire) and Margaret, owned the principal manor. He was a younger son. Among many identifiable kin (for he was born into a tight clan) were two uncles, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/23173/', "Richard Ravenser (d. 1386)")</script> and John Ravenser, both prominent clerks in the royal chancery, while <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27333/', "John Thoresby (d. 1373)")</script>, archbishop of York (1352&#150;73), was a great-uncle. A favourite nephew and namesake was still alive in 1416.<h2>
<a name="Earlycareer"></a>Early career</h2>Waltham's career was predetermined by his family and he is said to have served in the royal chancery from boyhood, where his uncles were not his only kinsmen. He had his first preferment, by gift of the crown, in 1371 and was a clerk by 28 June 1375 when appointed to take custody of Welhowe Abbey near Grimsby, which was deep in debt. Likewise, on 28 November 1375 he was one of those appointed to amend the state of the important St Leonard's Hospital, York. He advanced to inclusion as a professional administrator in high-ranking embassies: to investigate breaches of the truce with Scotland (1 January 1378); to treat with France (22 October 1378); to receive money owed to the crown by the king of Scots (28 May 1380).<br>
<br>On 8 September 1381 Waltham was appointed keeper of the rolls of chancery, the senior position in the chancellor's department. As a corollary he acted as a receiver of petitions for England in every parliament between November 1381 and November 1386, and was frequently appointed as proctor there by many ecclesiastical corporations and absent prelates. He received attorneys in Ireland for principals staying in England on 24 June and 1 September 1382, and had custody of the great seal from 10 to 13 March 1383 after the discredited Bishop Reginald Braybrooke's abrupt resignation. He was included in several major commissions: to investigate Walsingham Priory (1 March 1384); to inspect, under John of Gaunt, duke of Lancaster, and a galaxy of great names, the Foss Dyke from the Trent to Lincoln (15 July 1384); to hear, with another battery of leading magnates, an unpleasant, long-running case in the court of chivalry between William Montagu, earl of Salisbury, and his brother John (12 February 1385). It is probable, of course, that his specialist contribution to all of these tasks was made among his rolls in Chancery Lane, rather than, for example, by conversing knowledgeably on site about the fauna of ditches or the finer points of drainage. Closer to home, on 28 March 1385 he was asked to act as deputy for the chancellor to inspect the king's hospital of St Giles beyond Holborn. He was given custody of the temporalities of the see of Bath and Wells before their restitution to the new bishop, Walter Skirlawe, on 3 November 1386; there is no evidence that he himself had been a candidate. He had, none the less, enjoyed a very profitable accretion of ecclesiastical preferment, as senior chancery clerks always did, and with his great-uncle helping too, culminating in his obtaining the powerful and lucrative archdeaconry of Richmond, in the York diocese, by exchange on 29 December 1384. He took a period of official leave from the chancery at once, no doubt to establish himself there.<h2>
<a name="Roleingovernment"></a>Role in government</h2>Waltham's career had not been political, but his reputation as an impeccable senior member of what would today be termed the civil service now led him into dangerous waters. On 24 October 1386 he was promoted to be keeper of the privy seal. This was not in itself an unusual progression, but his predecessor, Bishop Skirlawe, resigned on the same day that the chancellor, the earl of Suffolk, was dismissed to face impeachment, and the treasurer, Bishop John Fordham of Durham, went out of office too. Whatever veneer was attempted, this was all done as a direct assault on the personal authority of the king, who even had to face a threat to his own position. Waltham's promotion was certainly intended by the king's opponents to indicate a serious and mature policy towards the government of the realm, and he was, of course, placed on the broad-based commission to &#145;advise&#146; the king's reordering of his rule. Waltham may be credited with an important and contentious extension of the use of the writ, <i>sub poena</i>. His uncle, John Thoresby, had developed this while chancellor (1349&#150;56) as issued under the great seal and returnable to answer suits in chancery; Waltham deployed it under the privy seal to bring cases before the council. The king took himself off to the midlands in 1387 to organize legal and military opposition to this restraint. Waltham remained in Westminster at his desk. On 14 November 1387 he was at Waltham Cross, north of London, to witness formally the appeal of the lords appellant against the king's adherents.<br>
<br>When the crisis came to a head in 1388, Alexander Neville, archbishop of York, a detested associate of the king, lost his see and a complicated sequence of translations followed. Waltham was papally provided to the bishopric of Salisbury on 3 April 1388, received his temporalities on 13 September, and was consecrated at Barnwell, Cambridgeshire, on 20 September (during the time of a parliament at Cambridge). He was enthroned at Salisbury on 8 December. On 4 May 1389 Waltham left office as keeper of the privy seal, as did the chancellor, Archbishop Thomas Arundel, and the treasurer, Bishop John Gilbert. Richard II had declared his resumption of personal authority the previous day and, as a matter of principle, could not work with the three chief officers imposed on him so unwelcomely thirty months before.<br>
<br>An important perspective on that defining crisis of 1386&#150;8 comes from the relationship of Waltham and the king hereafter. The bishop naturally took to his diocese, but he attended a meeting of the king's council on 28 April 1390, and was then appointed as a supervisor of the recent parliamentary subsidy, and this duty, or perhaps a generally renewed involvement with the government, kept him in London over the following business year. On 2 May 1391 he was recalled to high office by Richard as treasurer, in succession, indeed, to Gilbert, whom the king had reappointed after the briefest of symbolic intervals and who even now remained on the council. Arundel was to return as chancellor on 27 September. This might indeed suggest that the king, now firmly in control, was willing to do anything to disarm, confuse, or divide his many recent critics. In Waltham's case, however, the king was to show a warmth that it is difficult to reduce to posturing. Obviously, Richard's use of a riot in London involving the bishop's servants as reason to estrange himself from the city and attack its privileges in 1392&#150;3 was opportunistic. On the other hand, his intervention on the bishop's death to apprehend the body from its destined tomb in Salisbury and have it buried not simply in Westminster Abbey, but in Edward the Confessor's chapel itself, which the king was building up for his personal mausoleum, was a very personal sign, given to only a few royal servants. The bishop reciprocated their special relationship in his will.<h2>
<a name="BishopofSalisbury"></a>Bishop of Salisbury</h2>Before then, Waltham had supervised the exchequer with excellent apolitical competence, which was entirely what the king wanted. Richard placed the utmost priority in these years on securing domestic respect alongside financial stability through a peaceful foreign policy, as the premise for why his opponents had been able to bring him low in the past, and the platform for wreaking violent justice on them in the future. As early as July 1389 Waltham had ordered his own diocesan clergy to lead their parishioners in twice-weekly processions in praise of recent peace agreements and in hopes of better weather, fewer earthquakes, better harvests, no more internal dissension, and the repentance of heretics and schismatics. It was a newsletter on English and world affairs that the king could have written himself. As even Henry IV had to admit, Richard's choice of administrators, as opposed to intimates, in his last decade was flawless. Waltham in these years also headed the attorneys for Henry Bolingbroke when he went on crusade to eastern Europe in 1393, and&#151;a diocesan gesture&#151;was supervisor of the will of Sir John Golafre in January 1393.<br>
<br>Waltham returned each summer to his diocese and moved about it actively. He took up the bitter long-standing dispute with the cathedral chapter about episcopal authority over them, locally, nationally, and in Rome. In 1392, largely through Richard II's unqualified support, a hand-picked committee of arbitration came down entirely in the bishop's favour. Waltham used the victory generously to turn the chapter into allies, and it became the most distinguished in the land under his successors, Richard Medford and Robert Hallum. Like other bishops, he opposed the attempt by Archbishop William Courtenay to conduct a vigorous programme of archiepiscopal visitations, indeed to the point of appealing to Rome and obliging the king himself to warn both parties against violence between their men. He was by career a conservative in principle but a constructive pragmatist. He freely tolerated exchanges of benefices by his clergy, a practice against which Courtenay promoted the other great campaign of his rule as archbishop. Likewise, he fully supported the value of indulgences in support of good causes. He dealt firmly with the several early Lollards brought to his notice, but also responded supportively to those parishioners who brought suits against their clergy for failing to fulfil their liturgical roles. He was, indeed, notably severe in punishing priests who fell short in any way. His triennial visitations of his diocese in 1391 and 1394 were demanding, and brought the authority of a bishop home to the least parishioner. Predictably, he brought old northern friends with him as his household familiars.<h2>
<a name="Deathandburial"></a>Death and burial</h2>Waltham did not see death coming. It has been suggested, reasonably, that he was still not much over fifty. He had been travelling and working as hard as ever, and was in London in mid-August 1395. But he then made a long and detailed will at Sonning, Berkshire, an episcopal manor, on 2 September 1395, declaring the Blessed Virgin and both St Johns as his special patrons. There are many signs that, unlike most other senior churchmen, he had not prepared a draft. He requested burial in Salisbury Cathedral in &#145;a fitting and convenient place&#146; which his executors should agree with the chapter; evidently he had not made the usual prearrangements, and likewise he had to leave it to his executors to decide his funeral rites. The cathedral was left a miscellany of vestments and artefacts, to pray for him and, interestingly, for Sir William Scrope, perhaps already Richard II's most detested adviser. The king was to have 1000 marks and some richly jewelled ornaments. Archbishops William Courtenay and Arundel were to have some valuable artefacts too. Indicative of the haste of it all, his executors were to use his manors for a major scheme of memorial to the king and himself which he sketched out only roughly. A torrent of bequests to his former benefices, to monasteries and friaries, to his servants, and to many other people and places followed, often backtracking and supplementing. Late on, &#145;If my father's bones can be found, they are to be taken to join my mother's bones, with a marble stone&#146;  (TNA: PRO, PROB 11/1/5). Why had he never done this before? There is enormous and anxious detail in the will, but no structure. William Scrope headed the executors. It is fascinating as a study of deathbed religion, but most uncharacteristic of the testator's own professional life. Perhaps it sheds more light on his private personality. In the event, Waltham lingered on at Sonning until 18 September. As has been said, he was buried at the king's behest in the chapel of St Edward the Confessor in Westminster Abbey, where a perpetual anniversary came to be observed. The monks' initial dismay was assuaged by Richard's magnificent gift of a vestment worth 1000 marks&#151;but, as has also been said, the bishop had left him enough money to buy it.<br>
