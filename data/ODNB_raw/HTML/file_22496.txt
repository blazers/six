<span class="headword">Ponsonby,  Henry</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1745), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was the second son of <a name="cosubject_74241"></a><span class="headword">William Ponsonby</span>, first Viscount Duncannon  (1658/9&#150;1724), and his wife, Mary Moore (1660/61&#150;1713). William Ponsonby was born in 1658 or 1659, second son of Sir John Ponsonby (1608/9&#150;1678) and his second wife, Elizabeth Folliott, widow of Edward Trevor. He matriculated from Trinity College, Dublin, aged eighteen, as a fellow-commoner on 14 November 1677. He married Mary, daughter of Randal Moore and granddaughter of Charles, second Viscount Moore of Drogheda, in or before 1679. Sir John Ponsonby, a minor Cumberland gentleman, had followed Cromwell to Ireland in 1649 as colonel of a regiment of horse. William followed his father's military precedent. He distinguished himself greatly as commander of the protestant garrison during the siege of Londonderry in 1689&#150;90. He inherited the Irish estates of the family from his brother Henry in the 1690s. He held a commission, as lieutenant-colonel in Lord Ikersin's regiment of horse, raised in Ireland in 1706. He left the regiment on 24 December 1710. The regiment was disbanded in 1713. He was a member of the Irish parliament for co. Kilkenny in 1692&#150;3, 1695&#150;9, and 1703&#150;21. His wife died on 26 May 1713, a little before his political career bore fruit. He was called to the privy council in 1715, and was raised to the peerage of Ireland as Baron Bessborough in 1721, the patent citing his conduct during the siege of Londonderry. He was made Viscount Duncannon in 1723, and died on 17 November 1724; he was buried in Fiddown church, co. Kilkenny. He was succeeded by his eldest son, Brabazon.<br>
<br>Henry Ponsonby was made a captain on 2 August 1705 in the 27th foot (later the Royal Irish Fusiliers) and served with the regiment in the West Indies. He was ordered home in 1706 to reform the regiment, which was placed on the Irish establishment. In 1709 he sailed with his regiment on the aborted expedition to Cadiz under Major-General Charles Wills and landed at Catalonia. The regiment remained at Alicante until December 1710, when it sailed to reinforce the garrison at Minorca, where it remained for eight years. Ponsonby was promoted to regimental major on 11 January 1711 and brevet lieutenant-colonel on 1 December 1712. He was made lieutenant-colonel of the 27th foot on 16 September 1715 and commanded the regiment in Ireland until his appointment as colonel of the 37th foot (the North Hampshire regiment) on 13 May 1735. He represented Fethard in the Irish parliament in November 1715, and afterwards sat for Clonmeen, Inistioge, and Newtown. In 1723 he inherited the estate of Ashgrove, co. Kilkenny, from his father. On 18 February 1742, when Great Britain was preparing to take part in the War of the Austrian Succession, he was made brigadier-general, and in April he embarked for Flanders with the force under John Dalrymple, second earl of Stair. He was present at Dettingen, and was promoted major-general on 2 July 1743. At the battle of Fontenoy on 11 May 1745, as one of the major-generals of the first line, he was at the head of the 1st battalion of the 1st foot guards, and therefore in the forefront of the famous charge made by the British and Hanoverian infantry. He was in the act of handing over his ring and watch to his son, Chambr&eacute; Brabazon (<i>d</i>. 1762), a lieutenant in his own regiment, when he was killed by a cannon shot. Ponsonby and his wife, Lady Frances (<i>d</i>. 4 Nov 1751), youngest daughter of Charles Brabazon, fifth earl of Meath, had one son and one daughter, Juliana; their son, Chambr&eacute; Brabazon Ponsonby, was the father of Sarah Ponsonby, one of the ladies of Llangollen.<br>
