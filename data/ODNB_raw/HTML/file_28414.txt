<span class="headword">Wakefield,  Edward</span>  (1774&#150;1854), <span class="occ">philanthropist, land agent, and writer on political economy</span>, was born in Tottenham, Middlesex. He was the elder son of Edward Wakefield (1750&#150;1826), merchant, and the writer <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28420/', "Priscilla Wakefield (1750&#150;1832)")</script>, daughter of Daniel Bell. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28413/', "Daniel Wakefield")</script> was his younger brother. Edward, described by his nurse as &#145;born to make hearts ache&#146;, always had many female admirers. His first marriage was to &#145;the most beautiful girl in Essex&#146;, Susanna Crash, a farmer's daughter of Felsted in Essex, on 3 October 1790. They had ten children, of whom seven were boys; their eldest son was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28415/', "Edward Gibbon Wakefield")</script>, and their fourth was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28421/', "William Hayward Wakefield")</script>. Susanna died in 1817 and six years later, under mysterious circumstances, Edward married Frances Davies, daughter of David Davies, headmaster of Macclesfield grammar school. The marriage, solemnized in Paris on 3 August 1823, was not announced to either family, and Frances remained in her father's house for four years.<br>
<br>Brought up a Quaker, Wakefield was privately educated and spent much of his youth at the farm of John Gurney, an uncle, in Earlham, near Norwich. Shortly after his first marriage, he decided to become a gentleman farmer: obtaining first by purchase, Romford Lodge, and secondly by lease, Burnham Wyck, Essex. Both enterprises failed badly and the latter was sold at a considerable loss. However, he had become friends with many of the innovating and influential farmers in the area, including Squire Coke, Lord Petre, the duke of Bedford, and C. C. Western. A short, financially unrewarding period at the naval arsenal, Northfleet, followed. He ceased attending Quaker meetings and became loosely affiliated to the Church of England in the hope of winning a more lucrative government post. For the next few years, while his family lived in Bury St Edmunds, he spent his time educating himself by visiting prisons (Elizabeth Fry was a cousin) and workhouses, and by travel, including an extended visit to Ireland. Despite a continuing lack of success in his business affairs, his friends considered him to be particularly knowledgeable about economics. He gave evidence to parliamentary committees on sugar imports (1808), bullion (1810), and agricultural depression (1821). There is some suggestion that he was consulted by William Pitt about Ireland and that he advised Henry Dundas, first Viscount Melville, when president of the Board of Trade. In 1808 John Foster, afterwards Lord Oriel, chancellor of the exchequer for Ireland, persuaded him to return to Ireland and write a book about that country's rural economy. The subsequent two-volume work, <span class="italic">Ireland, Statistical and Political</span>, published in 1812, was described by John Ramsay McCulloch as &#145;the best and most complete work on Ireland since Arthur Young's tour&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>). Although it does contain some inaccuracies and has a distinctly Malthusian tone, its candour, intelligent analysis, and relatively unbiased perspective have ensured that it remains a valuable source for Irish historians.<br>
<br>In 1814, on the strength of his newly acquired reputation and the contacts made some fifteen years earlier, Wakefield opened one of the first land agencies in the country at 42 Pall Mall. He was soon occupied traversing the country, from Cornwall to Yorkshire, acting as the agent for, among others, David Ricardo, and as manager/adviser for several large landowners. As an adjunct to his estate management activities he engaged in the sale and purchase of parliamentary rotten boroughs, and did well at this secretive trade. His Irish book also provided an introduction into Benthamite and whig/radical circles in London. He formed close friendships with Francis Place, John Mill, and Henry Brougham. Two philanthropic causes, education and the condition and ill-treatment of lunatic asylum patients, attracted most of his attention. In the former case Wakefield strongly supported Joseph Lancaster's educational theories, introducing him to a number of wealthy patrons among whom, he later claimed, was George III. He helped organize several Lancastrian schools in London and cleverly manipulated public opinion to raise funds. His use of large public meetings, set agendas, and planted questions from the audience to create the right atmosphere was particularly sophisticated. For the latter cause, several visits to the lunatic asylum of Bethlem in 1814 and orchestrated publicity led to some celebrated evidence to a parliamentary inquiry in 1816.<br>
<br>Wakefield stood as a tory candidate for Reading in the general election of June 1826, but a scandal involving his son's abduction escapade, in which his wife was involved, seems to have caused his retirement on the third day of the poll. In the 1830s and 1840s he became a warm advocate of Edward Gibbon Wakefield's colonization schemes, writing many letters to newspapers and lobbying the cabinet. Financial problems eventually resurfaced and, facing bankruptcy proceedings, he was forced to flee the country in the early 1840s. With the help of a loan from Lord Ashburton he lived comfortably for some years in Blois, France, where he managed a silk factory. Eventually the debts were paid and he returned to England. Wakefield died on 18 May 1854 in Knightsbridge and is buried in Kensal Green cemetery.<br>
