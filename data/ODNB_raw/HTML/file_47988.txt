<span class="headword">Bowes,  George</span>  (1701&#150;1760), <span class="occ">coal owner and landscape builder</span>, was born on 21 August 1701 at Streatlam Castle, near Barnard Castle, co. Durham, the third son of Sir William Bowes (<i>bap</i>. 1657, <i>d</i>. 1707), landowner, of Streatlam, and his wife, Elizabeth Blakiston (<i>d</i>. 1736), heir of Sir Francis Blakiston of Gibside House, near Rowlands Gill, 3 miles south-west of Newcastle. After the death of Sir Francis Blakiston in 1713, the mineral-rich estate of Gibside became the possession of the Bowes family and thereby transformed its fortunes. William Blakiston Bowes, the first son, who came of age in 1717, was the first of the brothers to enjoy this inheritance. However, he died in 1721, and the second brother, Thomas, died the following year. In 1722, then, at the age of twenty-one, George found himself unexpectedly possessor of both estates. He had been educated first in Newcastle and then at Mr Hill's school in London. As a younger son of a gentry family in need of a profession, he had chosen the army and had become a captain in General Wade's regiment of horse. On inheriting the estates in 1722 he disposed of his commission, and the following year he made an abortive attempt to enter the House of Commons as member for Berwick upon Tweed.<br>
<br>The Streatlam estate was the ancient seat of the Bowes family: their ownership can be traced to the fourteenth century. It was, however, the acquisition of Gibside and its coal that made the family rich. George Bowes was determined to exploit the ownership of coal to its greatest possible extent: he succeeded in becoming member of parliament for co. Durham in 1727 (which he represented until 1760). Membership of the House of Commons brought prestige in the county, but above all it helped to protect the interests of the producers of coal in the north-east of England, in their main market, London. In 1726 he was one of the founder members of the &#145;Grand Allies&#146;. This, the most important association of coal owners in the eighteenth century, was designed to regulate the production of coal in the north-east. In 1726 George Bowes joined forces with three other large colliery proprietors: the Hon. Sydney Wortley, of Wortley, Yorkshire, with Edward Wortley, his son and heir; Sir Henry Liddell bt, with George Liddell, his guardian, both of Ravensworth Castle; and William Cotesworth. They signed a 99-year agreement to drop suits against each other, to grant each other wayleaves over their land, to refrain from buying or leasing collieries without the consent of the others, and to work all collieries as a joint concern. One of the allies' early joint enterprises was the construction of the Causey Arch, the first railway bridge of a large single span in the world. This crossed the Beckley burn a few miles south-west of Gateshead and carried the wagonway leading the coals of the Grand Allies from Tanfield and Causey to the staithes on the Tyne.<br>
<br>Bowes was by 1731 a convinced advocate of the need for regulation: George Liddell noted in 1731, &#145;I am of Mr Bowes' opinion that nothing but a Regulation will heale the Coale Trade&#146;  (Hughes, 239). By 1739, it had succeeded so well that a pamphleteer, speaking on behalf of the consumers in London, accused the coal owners of &#145;locking up collieries&#146;  (ibid., 247).<br>
<br>All the surviving evidence suggests that Bowes was a dynamic and emphatic personality. The fortune he amassed was worth at least &pound;600,000 at his death, and he used his wealth to transform the grounds at Gibside House. In 1729 extensive plantations began and picturesque buildings of various kinds were erected in the grounds, including in 1736 a bath house in classical style and in 1742 a gothic banqueting house designed by Daniel Garrett&#151;one of the first in this style in the north of England. Among the more striking of the works was the column to British liberty (1750&#150;57) and the mausoleum chapel designed by James Paine. This remained unfinished at Bowes's death and was completed in 1812 by his grandson, the tenth earl of Strathmore. Spencer Cowper, dean of Durham, summed up both the work at Gibside and Bowes's character in a letter in September 1753:<blockquote>Last week I was at Glory Bowes' at Gibside, to do it justice, I think it will be one of the finest places in the North when he has finish'd his design. The whole of his works takes in a range of seven miles; which if ever compleated will be worthy his Magnificence and Immensity. (<span class="italic">Letters</span>, 165)</blockquote>Bowes was married twice: in October 1724 he married Eleanor Verney (1710&#150;1724), daughter of the Hon. Thomas Verney and heir to George, Lord Willoughby de Broke. She died on 14 December 1724 at the age of fourteen. He married secondly in June 1743 Mary Gilbert (<i>d</i>. 1781), heir to her father, Edward Gilbert of St Paul's Walden, Hertfordshire. Bowes's only child and heir, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/3056/', "Mary Eleanor Bowes")</script>, was born on 24 February 1749. It was rumoured in 1742 that he was to be offered the Order of the Bath, a prospect he treated with scorn in a letter of 30 December 1742  (Durham RO, D/LO/F743). Bowes died at Gibside in September 1760 and was buried on 26 September in Whickham parish church. In 1812 his body was moved to the mausoleum at Gibside.<br>
