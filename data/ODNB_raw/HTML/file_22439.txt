<span class="headword">Poingdestre,  Jean</span>  (1609&#150;1691), <span class="occ">lieutenant-bailiff of Jersey and historian</span>, was born in 1609 at Swan Farm near Grainville in the parish of St Saviour, Jersey, where he was baptized on 16 April, the second son of Edouard Poingdestre or Poindexter of the fief &egrave;s Poingdestre and his wife, Pauline Ahier. He entered Pembroke College, Cambridge, in 1626, graduated BA in 1629, and proceeded MA in 1633. He was a gentleman commoner of Exeter College, Oxford, from October 1635 until November 1636, and in August 1636 was admitted as a fellow on the Jersey foundation.<br>
<br>Poingdestre was ordained deacon at York in 1641, but on the outbreak of the civil war, returned to Jersey. A royalist, he was with Sir Philippe de Carteret in Elizabeth Castle during the siege in 1643. Expelled from his college fellowship in 1648, he was with Sir George Carteret in that same castle when the parliamentary forces reoccupied the island in 1651, after which occupation he helped to draw up the conditions of surrender. In the later 1650s he lived in Jersey under parliamentary rule, and married in 1659 Anne Hamptonne, daughter and coheir of Laurens Hamptonne, vicomte of Jersey. They had one son and one daughter.<br>
<br>At the Restoration, Poingdestre returned to Oxford for a time, but he was sworn in as a jurat of the royal court of Jersey on 27 May 1668, by virtue of a letter of the king prescribing that he should be elected. His election as jurat was necessary for his appointment as lieutenant-bailiff. He took the oath for this latter office on 21 January 1669 and served until his resignation on 15 June 1676.<br>
<br>Poingdestre was an accomplished classical scholar but his publications related to local law and history. His pioneering and original history of Jersey, <span class="italic">Caesarea, or, A Discourse of the Island of Jersey</span>, written in 1682 and presented by the author to James II, provided much material for Philip Falle's important work <span class="italic">An Account of the Isle of Jersey</span> (1694). Poingdestre's other notable works are three legal treatises written in French: <span class="italic">Les commentaires sur l'ancienne coutume de Normandie</span>, <span class="italic">Les lois et coutumes de l'&icirc;le de Jersey</span>, and <span class="italic">Remarques et animadversions sur la nouvelle coutume de Normandie</span>. They are considered by many to be superior to the works of Philippe Le Geyt (1635&#150;1716), Poingdestre's successor as lieutenant-bailiff who also wrote on local law, but have been less widely known and less influential because the first two were not published until the early twentieth century and the third remains unpublished. In 1685 Poingdestre was one of the committee that was commissioned to draw up an abstract of the charters granted by various monarchs to the people of Jersey, a work known as <span class="italic">Les privil&egrave;ges de l'&icirc;le</span>.<br>
<br>Poingdestre died on 2 September 1691 at St Saviour, Jersey, and was buried two days later in the church of St Saviour, where a monument to him was erected.<br>
