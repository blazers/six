<span class="headword">Wheeler,  David John</span>  (1927&#150;2004), <span class="occ">computer scientist</span>, was born at 172 Charles Road, Sparkbrook, Birmingham, on 9 February 1927, the second of three children of Arthur William Wheeler and his wife, (Agnes) Marjorie, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Gudgeon. Arthur Wheeler was a press tool maker and engineer, and the proprietor of a small shopfitting and repair firm. The family lived in Small Heath, Birmingham, where Wheeler attended the local primary school. In 1938 he won a scholarship to the King Edward VI Grammar School, Camp Hill, Birmingham. In 1940 the school was evacuated first to Warwick and then to Lichfield. In 1942 the family moved for the duration of the war to Tunstall, Stoke-on-Trent, where Wheeler's father made tools for aircraft production. Wheeler completed his sixth-form education at Hanley high school without further interruption. He shone at mathematics and physics, and in 1945 won a minor entrance scholarship and a state scholarship to Trinity College, Cambridge, where he studied mathematics and graduated BA in 1948 as a wrangler.<br>
<br>In November 1946, while still an undergraduate, Wheeler attended the inaugural lecture of Douglas Hartree, the newly appointed Plummer professor of mathematical physics. Hartree had recently returned from the United States where he had seen the latest electronic computing developments, and he was convinced that computers would revolutionize the way science was done. Fascinated by these developments, Wheeler found his way to the university mathematical laboratory, where one of the new computing machines, EDSAC (electronic delay storage automatic calculator), was being built under the direction of Maurice Wilkes. An enthusiastic Wheeler was put to use as a wireman for the new machine. In October 1948 he became a research student in the mathematical laboratory under the supervision of Wilkes and joined the team that was building EDSAC. Wheeler's research topic was computer programming methods and their application. His first major contribution was a simple programming system&#151;known as the &#145;initial orders&#146;&#151;that translated the symbolic programs written by mathematicians into the binary codes that the machine understood.<br>
<br>EDSAC sprang into life on 6 May 1949. The machine was soon pressed into regular operation, providing the world's first electronic computing service. As operational experience built up, it became clear that programmers would be much more productive if they were provided with a library of subroutines&#151;small, prewritten programs for mathematical functions and the tabulation of printed results. Subroutines saved programmers from having to write code and also reduced the incidence of errors in their programs. During the summer of 1949 Wheeler tinkered with the initial orders to allow the use of subroutines. Using just forty-one instructions he was able not only to support subroutines, but also to add many additional features. His most important innovation was a technique for implementing the &#145;closed&#146; subroutine, by which a single copy of a subroutine was placed in an arbitrary position in the computer memory, and could be invoked many times from other places in the program. The closed subroutine was one of the most significant inventions in computer science, for which Wheeler was inducted into the hall of fellows of the Computer History Museum, Mountain View, California, in 2003. In 1951 Wheeler, together with Wilkes and Stanley Gill, wrote the first textbook on programming, <span class="italic">The Preparation of Programs for an Electronic Digital Computer</span>. The book arrived on the scene just as the first American computers were coming into service, and the Cambridge programming techniques were widely adopted. Wheeler's programming brilliance was widely recognized, and the programming techniques he described in <span class="italic">The Preparation of Programs</span> were studied worldwide.<br>
<br>In 1951 Wheeler secured a research fellowship at Cambridge, and during 1951&#150;3 spent two years as a visiting assistant professor at Illinois University, where he contributed to the design of the ILLIAC computer. In 1956 he was appointed an assistant director of research in the mathematical laboratory at Cambridge. A successor machine, EDSAC 2, was under construction, and Wheeler again designed the programming system. Working with EDSAC brought him into contact with users, including an astrophysics research student, Joyce Margaret Blackler, who arrived at the mathematical laboratory in 1956. The daughter of Edward George Blackler, garage proprietor, she and Wheeler married on 24 August 1957, when she was twenty-six; they had one son and two daughters.<br>
<br>In 1966 Wheeler was appointed reader in computer science; he was elected a fellow of Darwin College the following year. The mathematical laboratory was at the centre of his whole professional life as teacher, scholar, and research supervisor. A gentle manner and humility belied his formidable analytical powers and problem-solving ability. His many research students, eventually scattered around the globe, often became lifelong friends. His academic career consisted of a string of further important contributions to computer science and practice, mostly conducted in the mathematical laboratory (renamed the computer laboratory in 1970). He played a major role in the operating system for the laboratory's TITAN computer, Britain's leading time-sharing computer project of the 1960s. In the 1970s he worked on the laboratory's CAP computer, an important experimental design, and on the Cambridge Ring, an early networked computer system.<br>
<br>Wheeler was appointed professor of computer science at Cambridge in 1978, and in 1981 was elected a fellow of the Royal Society. Beyond the laboratory, he was a consultant for Bell Laboratories and the Digital Equipment Corporation in the United States. At the latter he worked with Mike Burrows&#151;a former research student&#151;to devise the Burrows&#150;Wheeler compression algorithm, a technique for reducing the size of computer files that became widely used in computer programming. Close to retirement in 1994 he invented with Roger Needham&#151;another former research student and at that time head of the laboratory&#151;an elegant and widely used cryptography technique later called TEA (tiny encryption algorithm).<br>
<br>Wheeler retired in 1994, becoming professor emeritus. His later years were blighted by failing eyesight, but he still spent most days in the laboratory, often making the journey by cycle. On 13 December 2004, while cycling from his home to the laboratory on a cold day, he succumbed to a fatal heart attack. He was survived by his wife, Joyce, and their three children.<br>
