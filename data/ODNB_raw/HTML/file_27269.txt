<span class="headword">Thompson,  John</span>, first Baron Haversham  (1648&#150;1710), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born in October 1648 at Worcester House, Mile End Green, London, and baptized at William Greenhill's Independent Church in Stepney on the 31st, the second (but first surviving) son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/38061/', "Maurice Thomson (1604&#150;1676)")</script>, merchant, and his second wife, Dorothy (<i>d</i>. before 1674), daughter of John Vaux of Pembroke. He was educated by Mr Watkins at Lee, Kent, entered Lincoln's Inn in 1663, and was admitted to Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge, on 2 July 1664, the year his father purchased the Haversham estate in Buckinghamshire. He married, on 14 July 1668 at St James's, Clerkenwell, Lady Frances (<i>c</i>.1648&#150;1705), the widow of Sir John Windham of Felbrigg, Norfolk, and daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/562/', "Arthur Annesley, first earl of Anglesey")</script>. They had five sons, only one of whom, Maurice, survived. Of their eight daughters, Mary married her cousin Arthur, fifth earl of Anglesey, and her sister Martha married Sir John Every, baronet. Sheriff of Buckinghamshire in 1669&#150;70, Thompson travelled abroad about this time to further his education. On his father's death in 1676 he inherited Haversham and property in London, Ireland, the Americas, and the Caribbean. Created a baronet in 1673, he was admitted to the East India Company in 1676.<br>
<br>Thompson was short, stocky, and red-faced, and his actions and speeches were often controversial. He inherited radical whig principles from his father and in the first elections of 1679 may have unsuccessfully stood as MP for Upper Gatton in Surrey, which he had inherited from his Oldfield cousins. He purchased a house at Richmond, and was regarded by Sir Adam Browne MP as a dangerous neighbour during the Rye House plot of 1683. Although successful at Gatton in the general elections of 1685, Thompson went to the Netherlands in the recess, reportedly carrying jewels worth thousands of pounds. His chaplain, Walter Cross, spoke derogatorily of James II, and Thompson's house in Utrecht was described as &#145;a private receptacle to the devout brethren&#146;  (Greaves, 300) to which he brought those involved in both Monmouth's rebellion and the Argyll expedition. He went to Cleves to see the whig politician Thomas Wharton, his wife liaising with a member of the princess of Orange's entourage. On eighteen committees in the Convention, he made sixteen recorded speeches. He complained that the clergy continued to pray for King James, wanted equality on the <span class="roman">Indemnity Bill</span>, voted for the Sacheverell clause, defending the nonconformist clergy against charges of disaffection, and supported the disabling clause in the <span class="roman">Corporations' Bill</span>.<br>
<br>Thompson's gift for controversy continued. In 1690 he moved that all those who had advised the king to dissolve the previous parliament should be dismissed. He attacked corruption, defended William III as &#145;the best of Kings&#146;, but lambasted those ministers &#145;who do not understand their business&#146;  (<span class="italic">Parliamentary Diary of Narcissus Luttrell</span>, 58). He was against increasing the land forces for a French war, seeing it as a mere &#145;colour&#146; to allow a standing army. Critical of all place-holders and antagonistic to &#145;junto whigs&#146;, he was one of the &#145;Buff friends&#146; in the country party, who, when new men joined a mixed ministry in 1693, hoped they would not be &#145;so mollified with place as to betray their country&#146;  (Rubini, 49). In 1694 he was listed as a member of the opposition, and re-edited his father-in-law's 1682 political pamphlet. This defended Anglesey against bogus memoirs and also attacked &#145;the folly or design of false or weak ministers&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Earl of Anglesey's State of the Government of the Kingdom</span>, 1694, 1).<br>
<br>In 1695 Thompson changed sides, his heir, Maurice, having been badly wounded at the siege of Namur. Elected a public accounts commissioner to investigate bribery and corruption, on the other hand he supported the government estimates for the 1696 campaign and, following a royal assassination attempt, he moved that all those MPs who did not subscribe to a loyal association should be expelled and that the captured plotters be examined. Such support for the government probably led to his elevation to the peerage as first Baron Haversham on 2 May 1696. On the reduction of the size of the Admiralty board in 1699 to five, Haversham became a member of the commission of &#145;his Majesty's own framing&#146;. He then actively promoted measures to prohibit the export of wool, supply the victuallers of ships with sufficient cash, and analyse the state of the fleet. He also, through private bills, defended the interests of his relations when Katherine, countess of Anglesey, sought a separation from her wife-beating husband, the third earl. He was described as &#145;very eloquent, but very passionate and fiery, a Dissenter by principle, and always turbulent&#146;  (S. Macky, <span class="italic">Memoirs of the Secret Services of John Macky Esq.</span>, 1733, 78).<br>
<br>Haversham's support for the government continued for some time. He strongly opposed the French over the Spanish succession, and during the impeachment in 1701 of lords Somers and Orford, he made reflections on the Commons' conduct to the managers at a free conference. He supported Somers and claimed the Commons acted partially by accusing only some of those involved in the partition treaties. Subsequently his son Maurice moved the impeachment of the earl of Jersey, the lord chamberlain, in the Commons, where an attempt to have Haversham censured created a constitutional precedent over relationships between the houses. He said he had no desire to dishonour the Commons, and he and the impeached lords eventually escaped punishment. He resigned, or was removed, from the Admiralty board and the following year was ridiculed in a cartoon depicting Anglesey's death. He and Thomas Wharton introduced a bill to secure the king against the Pretender, who had recently been recognized as James III by the French. He opposed the <span class="roman">Occasional Conformity Bill</span> in 1703, using the occasion to attack the vast expense of the navy and the favouritism involved in appointments.<br>
<br>In 1703&#150;4, as chairman of a committee investigating the naval victualling department, Haversham exposed corruption and criticized the government over its failure to use the navy effectively the previous summer. Moving towards the tories, he stirred them up to attack Godolphin over the <span class="roman">Act of Union</span> with Scotland. From 1704 he gave an annual state of the nation speech, which in 1705 called for the Electress Sophia to be invited to England, ostensibly to strengthen the succession, but in fact to embarrass the government. Godolphin, however, was well prepared and defeated &#145;Lord Haversham's great guns&#146;  (<span class="italic">Portland MSS</span>, 2.191) through delays and the <span class="roman">Regency Bill</span>. His change of allegiance created enemies and whig criticism, while his speech-making and alleged whoring were satirized in a poem, <span class="italic">The Dog in the Wheel</span> (1705). He printed his speech attacking the government for its conduct of the war, but was criticized by Defoe in his <span class="italic">Review</span>. Hinting that the attack had been inspired by Robert Harley, and justifying his noble status in pompous language, Haversham referred to Defoe as &#145;a mean and mercenary prostitute&#146;  (<span class="italic">Some Memoirs</span>, xi). In reply Defoe assaulted his recent ennoblement, commenting that some were &#145;advanced without honour&#146; and others &#145;raised without merit&#146;  (J. Sutherland, <span class="italic">Defoe</span>, 2nd edn, 1950, 118). Haversham, in vindication, issued a further pamphlet that appeared to attack the king. Defoe then compared Haversham to a dog that bayed at the moon, commenting that he knew no more of William than those who had insulted him knew of his horse. The warfare between Defoe and Haversham, now identified with the high tories, continued, the former writing to Harley that &#145;My Lord Haversham's speech is laught at by everybody&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Letters of Daniel Defoe</span>, ed. G. H. Healey, 1955, 247&#150;8). However, Haversham's justification was &#145;The best way of preserving liberty of speech in parliament is to make use of it&#146;  (<span class="italic">Some Memoirs</span>, 12).<br>
<br>Although seen as a tory, Haversham remained a maverick MP. In the debates on the union with Scotland, he argued against an &#145;incorporating Union&#146; and for &#145;a federal union, an union of interests an union of succession&#146;  (<span class="italic">Some Memoirs</span>, 20) and the maintenance of the constitutional balance of power. Opposed to over-powerful politicians, in July 1708 he had an audience with the queen, against whom he suggested the whigs were plotting. In 1709 he stated that &#145;one of the greatest ends and uses of Parliament, [is] the redressing of grievances and keeping great men in awe&#146;  (ibid., 34). An occasional conformist, he resolved from 1707 to regularly attend the Anglican church, though later opposed &#145;a pretended divine right of the church&#146;  (ibid., 50).<br>
<br>Haversham became more controversial with age and remained an inveterate speech-maker. On 10 May 1709 he married his housekeeper, Martha Graham (1647&#150;1724), and was scurrilously identified as the &#145;old-out-of fashion-lord&#146;, father to the incestuous siblings in Mary Manley's <span class="italic">New Atlantis</span>. When 10,000 refugees arrived from the Palatinate, he proposed the erection of government subsidized workhouses, which would have competed with ordinary industry. During Dr Sacheverell's impeachment in 1710, he argued that the strength of the queen's constitutional position was through her hereditary title rather than the consent of parliament. He often turned a piece of political infighting into a personal confrontation, though the printing of his speeches opened the door to official publication of parliamentary proceedings. By late 1709 he was weary of debate, writing to Harley that he was &#145;contented after so long being in Parliament to come there very little&#146;  (<span class="italic">Portland MSS</span>, 6.524). However, he promised another speech on the state of the nation in 1710, but Lord Rochester reported he had had a fit of spitting blood. He sent a copy of another proposed speech to Harley in August, but died at Richmond on 1 November and was buried there on the 13th. His wife was buried on 13 March 1724.<br>
