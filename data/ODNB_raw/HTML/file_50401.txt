<span class="headword">McGregor,  William</span>  (1847&#150;1911), <span class="occ">football administrator</span>, was born in Braco, Perthshire. Little is known about him before he moved in 1870 to Birmingham, where he and his brother Peter opened a linen draper's shop at 306&#150;7 Summer Lane, Newtown, then about a mile from the city centre. He does not seem to have been much of a football player himself, although he had played the game with other boys in Braco after they had seen the local stonemasons kicking a ball about. His interest may have been revived by meeting other Scots in Birmingham who were keen on the sport: J. Campbell Orr founded the Calthorpe team in the early 1870s and George Ramsay was a leading member of Aston Villa. McGregor was enthusiastic enough about the growing popular pastime to arrange the half-day closing of his shop for Saturday afternoons so that he could watch the games. He was invited to join the committee of Aston Villa in the late 1870s, and umpired for the club. His shop meanwhile began to sell football shirts and shorts and to become a meeting-place for local followers of the sport. At this time McGregor lived with his wife, Jesse, their daughter and son in a terraced house on Witton Road not far from the Aston Lower Grounds. Later the family moved to 8 Salisbury Road, close to Cannon Hill Park. They worshipped at the Congregational church in Wheeler Street, and like many Congregationalists McGregor was also a Liberal in politics and a teetotaller.<br>
<br>About this time football was developing rapidly as a spectator sport, especially in Lancashire and the midlands. Local and regional cup competitions, together with the FA cup, encouraged clubs to widen their search for good players and some, including Aston Villa, began to pay them for playing. Professionalism was legalized in 1885 but the priority given to cup ties disrupted ordinary fixture lists and often led to other supposedly competitive matches becoming one-sided friendly games which proved unattractive to paying customers. What was required was a regular programme of fixtures between the strongest teams, along the same lines as the county cricket championship. This was what McGregor proposed when he wrote to five of the leading clubs on 2 March 1888. The Football League was born at a meeting in Manchester on 17 April with six clubs from Lancashire and six from the midlands.<br>
<br>McGregor subsequently became chairman of the league's management committee (1888&#150;92), president (1892&#150;4), and a life member (1895&#150;1911). He was also a Football Association councillor and something of a football celebrity, writing regularly on the sport in the press and giving his name to products such as the McGregor football. On 4 December 1911 he was presented with the FA's long service medal but shortly afterwards he became ill. He died at Miss Storer's Nursing Home, 70 Newhall Street, Birmingham, on 20 December 1911. Jesse had died in December 1908 and McGregor was buried next to her in St Mary's Church, Handsworth, Birmingham, on 23 December 1911.<br>
