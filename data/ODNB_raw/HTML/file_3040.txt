<span class="headword">Bowen,  John</span>  (1815&#150;1859), <span class="occ">bishop of Sierra Leone</span>, son of Thomas Bowen, captain in the 85th regiment, and his third wife, Mary, daughter of the Revd John Evans, chaplain to the garrison at Placentia, Newfoundland, was born at Court, near Fishguard, Pembrokeshire, on 21 November 1815. At twelve years of age he was sent to school at Merlin's Vale, near Haverfordwest, and in 1830 he continued his studies under the Revd David Adams. He emigrated to Canada in April 1835, and had a farm at Dunville, on the shores of Lake Erie. He served in the militia during the rebellion of 1837&#150;8. On Sunday 6 March 1842 he heard a sermon in the Lake Shore church which led him to prepare for the ministry. Disposing of his farm on favourable terms, he returned to England, and in January 1843 entered Trinity College, Dublin, where he graduated BA in 1847, and LLB and LLD ten years later.<br>
<br>Bowen was ordained deacon at Ripon Cathedral on 20 September 1846, and his first appointment was as assistant curate of Knaresborough, Yorkshire, in 1848. An uncle had left him an estate at Haverfordwest, and while at Knaresborough, Bowen asked the Church Missionary Society to allow him to visit its many foreign stations. The society suggested that he go to Jerusalem, confer there with Bishop Gobat, and then visit the missionary stations at Syros, Smyrna, and Cairo; then journey to Mount Lebanon, Nablus, and other places in Syria, and on to Mosul by Constantinople and Trebizond; and finally return by Baghdad and Damascus to Jerusalem. Bowen succeeded, despite many hardships and dangers, and returned to England in December 1851. In 1853 the marquess of Huntly named him rector of Orton-Longueville with Botolph Bridge in Huntingdonshire. With permission from his bishop Bowen again left England, in September 1854, and stayed in the East until July 1856. There he learned Arabic well enough to preach fluently in it.<br>
<br>On 10 August 1857 Bowen was consecrated the third bishop of Sierra Leone by the archbishop of Canterbury and the bishops of Peterborough and Victoria. On 24 November 1857 he married Catharine, daughter of George Butler, the dean of Peterborough. He sailed for his new diocese two days later, on 26 November. Both of his predecessors had died at their posts; Bowen's wife died after giving birth to a stillborn son on 4 August 1858 and Bowen himself died of yellow fever on 28 May 1859, at Freetown. In his short term Bowen served the Yoruba mission, Yorubaland (where Africans had been ordained in 1854), reached the delta of the Niger, and encouraged missionaries to learn the languages of the local people.<br>
