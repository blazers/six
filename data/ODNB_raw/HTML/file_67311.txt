<span class="headword">Burgin,  Edward Leslie</span>  (1887&#150;1945), <span class="occ">solicitor and politician</span>, was born on 13 July 1887 at Timberscombe, Dollis Road, Finchley, the elder son of Edward Lambert Burgin (1858&#150;1941), solicitor, and his wife, Marian Kate, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Showler (1862&#150;1933). He was educated at Christ's College, Finchley, and the University of London, where he gained first-class honours in law in 1908; he also studied in Lausanne and Paris. The following year he took top place in the Law Society's final examination and joined his father's firm, Denton, Hall and Burgin of Gray's Inn Place, London, and rue Sainte-Anne, Paris. The firm specialized in international commerce, and Burgin drew on his growing practical experience of probate to inform a London University doctoral (LLD) thesis, &#145;The Administration of Foreign Estates&#146;, which was published in 1913. On 30 May 1912 he married Dorothy Theresa (1888&#150;1975), third daughter of Charles Henry Cooper, a Finchley trimming manufacturer; they had one son and four daughters.<br>
<br>During the First World War Burgin put his considerable linguistic talents to use as an intelligence officer and was awarded the croce di guerra for his work on the Italian front. On his return to London he combined a successful legal practice with part-time teaching for the Law Society, and served for some years in the mid-1920s as its principal and director of studies. Burgin was also an active member of the International Law Association and the Grotius Society and took a particular interest in bankruptcy law, campaigning without success for the adoption of an international bankruptcy convention. In collaboration with his colleague Eric Fletcher&#151;later Lord Fletcher of Islington&#151;he published <span class="italic">The Student's Conflict of Laws</span> (1928), a textbook based on A. V. Dicey's classic study, which went through three editions. In 1929 he took over as senior partner.<br>
<br>Alongside these demanding professional commitments, Burgin became increasingly active in politics as a member of the Liberal Party and the League of Nations Union. His political sympathies lay with the former Liberal prime minister, H. H. Asquith, and in November 1921 he stood as Liberal candidate for Hornsey in a by-election on a traditionalist platform of free trade, retrenchment, and fewer armaments. Burgin lost out narrowly to the Conservative Viscount Ednam&#151;a highly creditable result in a historically Tory constituency&#151;and fought the seat again in the 1922, 1923, and 1924 general elections, but the hoped-for Liberal breakthrough never came. In 1926 he came third in another by-election in East Ham North. Burgin was finally rewarded for his tenacity when he was adopted for the more winnable seat of Luton, which he captured from the Conservatives in 1929 with a majority of more than 3000.<br>
<br>As one of fifty-nine Liberal MPs in the 1929 parliament, Burgin tolerated David Lloyd George's leadership and acquiesced in his strategy of keeping the second Labour government in power. In February 1931, however, he played an important role in scuttling the government's <span class="roman">Trade Disputes Bill</span> by moving an amendment which confirmed the illegality of a general strike. When the National Government took office in August 1931 to deal with the budget deficit, Burgin followed Sir John Simon into a new Liberal National group which promised to support protection. He explained to Luton Liberals that he still regarded tariffs as &#145;dangerous expedients&#146;, but believed that ministers needed a &#145;free hand&#146; at a time of national peril  (<span class="italic">Manchester Guardian</span>, 26 Sept 1931, 11). Though local tories were wary of Burgin, Conservative Central Office secured him a free run against Labour, and he was comfortably re-elected in both 1931 and 1935.<br>
<br>As a relatively young and talented Liberal National, Burgin was now well-placed to ascend the ministerial ladder. After ten months as a charity commissioner in 1931&#150;2, he became parliamentary secretary to the Board of Trade, where he helped Walter Runciman implement the government's tariff policy. Burgin spent much of his time overseeing bilateral trade negotiations, especially those leading up to the 1933 Anglo-Argentine agreement, and managing representations from cotton manufacturers and other affected industries: he also addressed a host of Chamber of Commerce dinners and luncheons. Burgin's five years at the Board of Trade (1932&#150;7) were generally considered successful, though his long-standing acquaintance Raymond Streat worried that he was becoming increasingly vain, unpopular with his officials, and &#145;notorious for his speeches, which aim at verbal brilliance so painstakingly, that the subject matter is often lost sight of&#146;  (<span class="italic">Lancashire and Whitehall</span>, 1.362).<br>
<br>Burgin finally entered the cabinet in May 1937, when the new prime minister, Neville Chamberlain, appointed him minister of transport in succession to Leslie Hore-Belisha. Hore-Belisha had raised the ministry's profile by launching a major road safety drive, including the introduction of the famous &#145;Belisha beacons&#146;, and taking responsibility for major trunk roads away from local authorities. Burgin was by nature less flamboyant than his predecessor, but he had the advantage of being a keen motorist at a time when car ownership was soaring. In January 1938 he visited Germany to examine the new autobahn network in the company of the Nazi engineer Fritz Todt, and on his return he announced his support for an experimental stretch of motorway between Carnforth and Warrington in Lancashire, though he was unable to secure Treasury funding for the project. Burgin also faced the more immediate task of preparing the road and rail networks for war, and showed himself sympathetic to the railway companies' &#145;Square Deal&#146; campaign for the deregulation of freight charges.<br>
<br>Throughout this period Burgin supported Chamberlain's policy of appeasement&#151;for instance, he backed the prime minister in cabinet in the run-up to Munich&#151;but he was in no sense central to the government's dealings with Germany. In April 1939, however, Burgin moved into the forefront of political controversy when Chamberlain made him minister of supply, with responsibility for equipping the enlarged army which a continental war would require. In many respects it was a poisoned chalice, not only because the army had been badly neglected in the initial rearmament programme but also because many MPs had hoped that Winston Churchill would be given the post; Harold Nicolson, for instance, thought &#145;the impression was deplorable&#146; because it demonstrated Chamberlain's continued reliance on &#145;yes-men&#146;  (<span class="italic">Diaries and Letters</span>, 1.399).<br>
<br>Burgin set to work with the aid of the veteran civil servant Sir Arthur Robinson, but after war broke out he faced growing criticism from Churchill and the service chiefs for deficiencies in munitions production. In discussions of military strategy he was generally a cautious influence, though he did promote an abortive plan to disrupt the Soviet economy by bombing the Caucasian oilfields. Burgin was never popular with the opposition parties, and when the coalition was formed in May 1940 Churchill replaced him with his leading Labour critic, Herbert Morrison, a decision which came as &#145;a disappointment and a shock&#146;  (Churchill and Gilbert, 6.356). Thereafter he represented Luton on the back benches until he retired at the 1945 election. By this stage he was already ailing from cancer, and he died at his home in Aplins Close, Townsend Lane, Harpenden, Hertfordshire, on 16 August 1945. After a funeral service at Harpenden Methodist church, he was cremated at Golders Green.<br>
<br>In his own way, Burgin was not only an intelligent but a charismatic man, &#145;dark, genial, and shrewd&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Observer</span>, 6 June 1937, 21), with an easy charm and remarkable linguistic dexterity. He was an enthusiastic mountaineer and cricketer, and in his younger days was considered one of the best athletes in the House of Commons; he was also an active Methodist and a lay preacher. Yet what he possessed in talent he sometimes lacked in dynamism and political purpose, and he was perhaps too reliant on the patronage of Neville Chamberlain and Sir John Simon to emerge as a major figure in his own right. As with Chamberlain and Simon, his earlier achievements came to be overshadowed by his association with appeasement and the military debacle of 1940. &#145;Cato&#146; cast him as one of the &#145;guilty men&#146; who had taken Britain to the brink of disaster, and his reputation never recovered.<br>
