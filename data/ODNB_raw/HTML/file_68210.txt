<span class="headword">Jenner,  Caryl</span> <span class="st"> [<em>real name </em>Pamela Penelope Ripman]</span>  (1917&#150;1973), <span class="occ">theatre director and manager</span>, was born on 19 May 1917 at 45 Ladbroke Grove, London, the daughter of Walter Ripman (1869&#150;1947), an inspector of schools and author of many school textbooks in French and German, and his wife, Constance Brockwill Grier. She was educated at Norland Place School and at St Paul's Girls' School. She studied for the theatre at the Central School of Speech Training and Dramatic Art in London, gaining the Central School and London University diplomas in dramatic art in 1935.<br>
<br>Caryl Jenner, to use the name she adopted, began her professional career as an actress and assistant stage manager at the Gate Theatre, London. From 1936 to 1938 she worked as a stage manager for various companies in London and the provinces. In December 1938 she became director of the Amersham Repertory Company, where until its closure in March 1949 she worked with the actress Sally Latimer on over 200 productions. During this time she showed a particular gift for creating theatre for young people, in 1948 becoming co-director of the Amersham Playhouse Schools Mobile Unit.<br>
<br>In November 1949 Caryl Jenner launched her first independent theatrical enterprise, Mobile Theatre Ltd, which was committed to bringing live performance to towns and villages otherwise denied the chance to see theatre. This proved so successful that by 1960 she was managing five touring companies, four of which, jointly named the English Theatre for Children, were exclusively devoted to children's theatre. She ran summer theatre seasons in Seaford, Southwold, Cornwall, and Ayr and toured tirelessly: she visited schools for over fifty education authorities in Britain, extending her tours to include Northern Ireland (January 1960) and Malta (May 1960). She also directed children's plays at various major venues: Sam Wanamaker's New Shakespeare Theatre, Liverpool; the Lyric, Hammersmith; the Yvonne Arnaud, Guildford; the Coventry, Belgrade; and the Toynbee, Questors, and Garrick in London.<br>
<br>Caryl Jenner's performances for children were distinguished by an appeal to the imagination (e.g. using a simple stepladder for a mountain). They did not involve any physical participation by the children nor post-show discussion, for she believed that this was the task of the teacher. She never avoided confronting difficult topics: one of her productions of this period, <span class="italic">The Tingalary Bird</span> by Mary Mellwood, was an absurdist piece, in which an old couple argue their lives away. Many adults thought it too advanced for a child audience, yet it was watched attentively by the children themselves.<br>
<br>In October 1962 Caryl Jenner renamed her organization Caryl Jenner Productions Ltd, and launched the Unicorn Theatre Club for Young People. It is for her pioneering work with the Unicorn Theatre that she is now best remembered. In October 1964 the Unicorn became a permanent London company of some eight to ten actors, but it almost failed two years later when it ran into serious financial difficulties. It was saved by support from the Gulbenkian Foundation, the Leche Trust, and members of the Unicorn itself. Most importantly, it began to receive grants from the Arts Council, establishing for the first time the principle of subsidizing children's theatre in Britain. The improved financial situation allowed her in July 1967 to take a six-year lease on the Arts Theatre in London. She would present plays and run workshops for children during the day, and let out the theatre for adult performances in the evening. By now she had abandoned touring and could rely on audiences' coming to her: from 1970 to 1973 her audiences at the Arts Theatre averaged 93 per cent, coming from 100 of London's 114 postal districts and from 308 towns outside London. In 1973 the annual audience was over 56,000, with 14,000 children from the inner London education authority attending forty term-time performances a year. In addition to her own productions she invited into the theatre puppet shows, dance pieces, films, and chamber music concerts.<br>
<br>From 1967 to 1969 Jenner served on the young people's theatre panel of the Arts Council, and in 1970 she became chairman of the young people's theatre executive of the Council of Repertory Theatres. She was also the British representative for the Association Internationale du Th&eacute;&acirc;tre pour l'Enfance et la Jeunesse, attending its five-week assembly in Canada and the United States shortly before her death. Gaunt and mannish in appearance, a chain-smoker and extremely active to the point of being domineering, she died, unmarried, of lung cancer at the Middlesex Hospital, London, on 29 January 1973.<br>
