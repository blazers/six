<span class="headword">Blizard, Sir  William</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1744, <em>d.</em> 1835), <span class="occ">surgeon</span>, the third of four sons and the fourth child of William Blizard and his wife, Elizabeth Robinson, was born in Barn Elms, Surrey, and baptized at St Mary's Church there on 26 February 1744. According to a biographical sketch in <span class="italic">The Lancet</span> written shortly before his death, Blizard &#145;was born in a little one-story, and now antique tenement, next door to the &#147;Sun&#148; public-house at Barnes, where his father carried on the business of a hair-dresser, bleeder, and tooth-drawer&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Lancet</span>, 18). A memoir written just after Blizard's death claimed that his father was an auctioneer  (Cooke). Blizard was articled to a Mr Besley, a surgeon-apothecary at Mortlake, Surrey, before studying under Henry Thompson, surgeon at the London Hospital. Blizard attended lectures given by Percivall Pott, John and William Hunter, and assisted a surgeon who practised in Crutched Friars. He may have also been the &#145;occupier of a little shop in the &#147;medical way&#148; at Lambeth Butts&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Lancet</span>, 18).<br>
<br>As a young man Blizard involved himself in radical politics and became a supporter of John Wilkes. Writing under the name of Curtius he contributed to the Wilkesite <span class="italic">Middlesex Journal, or, Chronicle of Liberty</span> and the <span class="italic">Freeholders' Magazine, or, Monthly Chronicle of Liberty</span>. The latter published a piece by him &#145;On the intent and end of government&#146; in October 1769  (pp. 73&#150;4). However, Blizard's radicalism did not endure and he became conservative in outlook and a strong supporter of Pitt. Blizard married Jane Blizard, sister of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2657/', "Thomas Blizard")</script>.<br>
<br>Blizard was elected surgeon to the Magdalene Hospital and by 1778 was lecturing on anatomy and surgery with Robert Maclaurin at Thames Street, and then at 12 Mark Lane, Fenchurch Street, London. He later lectured with Thomas Blizard. In 1780 Blizard was appointed surgeon to the London Hospital after defeating George Vaux and John Andree in the election. During the same year he joined the Honourable Artillery Company and took part in the suppression of the Gordon riots. In 1781 he became surgeon to the company with whom he served until 1790. He was also at one time a lieutenant-colonel with the 6th regiment of London Loyal volunteers.<br>
<br>Blizard's most notable achievement was establishing the London Hospital medical school which, together with Robert Maclaurin, he founded in 1785. Blizard considered himself something of a poet, and to celebrate the opening of the operating theatre he composed an ode, which was set to music by Samuel Arnold, telling of &#145;how providence befriends this seat of commerce and benevolence&#146;  (Cooke, 7). As a lecturer Blizard digressed too much &#145;and allowed too much liberty to a discursive fancy and warm imagination&#146;  (Cooke, 8); as a surgeon he was discriminating, decisive, energetic, and skilful. He was also scrupulous about professional etiquette, particularly in regard to the use of language. On one occasion he asked a student what was happening in the operating theatre and was told, &#145;Mr Headington is operating in a case of strangulated hernia, but the gut is quite rotten&#146;. Blizard replied, &#145;Pray sir, do not call it <i>gut</i>, or say that it is <i>rotten</i>, or you will be taken for a butcher; but call it <i>intestine</i>, and say that it is <i>gangrenous</i>&#146;  (Cooke, 11). In 1787 he was appointed professor of anatomy to the Company of Surgeons and elected a member of its court of assistants in 1796. Later he was master of the Royal College of Surgeons (1814), president in 1822&#150;3, and three times Hunterian orator. He was a member of the court of examiners from 1810 until 1835 and was &#145;dreaded by the students, from his austerity and testiness of manner&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Lancet</span>, 18). He was elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1787 and a fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1799. He was knighted in 1802.<br>
<br>Although his early radicalism dimmed, Blizard involved himself in philanthropic activities. He founded the Samaritan Society in 1791, he knew Jonas Hanway, having worked with him in the Marine Society, and had interests in prison reform, and in ensuring the respectful treatment of dead bodies. His interest in the latter, which may have stemmed from his religious beliefs and from the experience of assisting in grave robbing as an apprentice, caused him to appear in full court dress when, as president of the Royal College of Surgeons, he received the bodies of executed criminals from the hangman at the college's house in Cock Lane. Blizard's formality on these occasions was seen by some as a sign of his pomposity; it is more likely that it was adopted out of respect for the corpse.<br>
<br>In 1827, at the age of eighty-three, Blizard carried out his final operation in public. In the same year he made a journey to Edinburgh, the longest he had ever taken. The only objects that interested him on the four-day journey were the local hospitals encountered on the way. In September 1834 he underwent a successful cataract operation but went into gradual decline not long after; he began to experience difficulty breathing and developed heart problems. Blizard died at his home at Brixton Hill, Surrey, on 27 August 1835 and was buried in a vault beneath Brixton church on 4 September. He was survived by his wife.<br>
<br>Tall with strongly marked features, Blizard had been prone to joke about his prominent nose. In addition to the posts already mentioned he held appointments at the Deaf and Dumb Asylum, Marine Society, Clergy Orphan Asylum, and the London Orphan Asylum. He was an earnest Anglican and a keen supporter of Sunday schools. Among Blizard's writings were <span class="italic">Suggestions for the Improvement of Hospitals and other Charitable Institutions</span> (1796) and papers in the <span class="italic">London Medical Journal</span>, between 1789 and 1790.<br>
