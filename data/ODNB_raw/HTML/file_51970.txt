<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Brock, Dame  (Madeline) Dorothy</span>  (1886&#150;1969), <span class="occ">headmistress</span>, was born on 18 November 1886 at 496 Caledonian Road, Islington, London, second daughter and youngest of three children of George William Frederick Brock, commercial clerk, and his wife, Eliza Jane Wilkins. Sir Laurence George Brock (1879&#150;1949), chairman of the Board of Control (1928&#150;45), was her elder brother. The family moved about 1891 to the house at Bromley, Kent, which remained its base for more than half a century. The household she grew up in was happy and hospitable, prominent in the local Congregational church and liberal in outlook. The daughters attended Bromley high school, founded by the Girls' Public Day School Company, from which Dorothy, supported by a Kent county scholarship, entered Girton College, Cambridge, in 1904 to read classics. She spent six blissful years there, progressing via a first class in the tripos (1907) to a Pfeiffer research studentship (1909&#150;10) and a seat, albeit lowly, at the Girton high table. Cambridge degrees being closed to women she took her BA (1907) at Trinity College, Dublin. Her dissertation on the Latin author Fronto, which earned her a Dublin LittD, was subsequently published (1912). A brilliant pianist, she was the mainstay of college concerts, as also of more frivolous occasions, and made many lasting friendships. She remained deeply attached to Girton and later on represented the old students on its governing body.<br>
<br>In 1910, realizing perhaps that a life of pure scholarship would not satisfy her human interests, Dorothy Brock joined the staff of the King Edward VI High School for Girls, Birmingham, where she discovered her true vocation. In January 1918, just turned thirty-one (and the youngest of fifty applicants), she became headmistress of the Mary Datchelor, an endowed girls' grammar school supported and managed by the Clothworkers' Company which from its site at Camberwell in south London served a lively clientele consisting in roughly equal proportions of fee-payers, with at best moderate means, and scholarship-holders from the elementary schools. Here Dorothy Brock was content to stay, declining attractive invitations to move elsewhere, until she retired in 1950. She made the school famous: for its scholarly attainments, achieved in part by unconventional teaching methods; for the variety of careers it opened to its pupils, in industry, commerce, and social service, as well as more traditional occupations such as nursing (she was a member of two inquiries into nurse training, the Lancet commission, 1931, and the government-appointed Athlone committee, 1937); and most markedly for its all-pervasive music. She was alert to the ever-narrowing gap between schooldays and adulthood, signalized politically in 1928 by the lowering of the voting age for women to twenty-one, and in her benign conduct of the school she linked freedom with responsibility.<br>
<br>Dorothy Brock quickly made her mark in the Association of Headmistresses (AHM), of which she was chairman, 1927&#150;9, and president, 1933&#150;5, and was the first woman to chair the Joint Committee of Four Secondary Associations, 1935&#150;7. Her management of meetings was relaxed yet businesslike, allowing scope for disagreements which &#145;left no sting&#146;  (<span class="italic">M. Dorothy Brock</span>, 24). She made her d&eacute;but on the national educational scene in 1919 as a member of the committee appointed by the prime minister to inquire into the position of classics in the educational system; in 1930 she became the first woman vice-president of the Classical Association. She was a member from 1931 to 1940 of the Board of Education's consultative committee on secondary education and hence contributed to the Spens report (1939); she served a long stint on the Secondary Schools Examination Council (1937&#150;51); and she was a member of the committee on public schools which produced the Fleming report in 1944. Her presence on such bodies was made doubly valuable (and doubly onerous) by the general sparsity of women members and she seized every opportunity to promote awareness in government circles of girls' schools and their achievements.<br>
<br>Still at the height of her powers in 1939, Dorothy Brock grappled successfully with the many problems attendant on the evacuation of her school first to Kent and then to Llanelli in south Wales. During the post-war years before her retirement she played a leading part in the negotiations which secured voluntary aided status for the Mary Datchelor under the 1944 <span class="roman">Education Act</span> and in 1947 became nationally famous as the first serving headmistress to be advanced to DBE (she was appointed OBE in 1929). She frankly enjoyed her honours, which included the freedoms of the Clothworkers' Company and City of London (1936) and borough of Camberwell (1950) and an honorary LLM from London University (1947).<br>
<br>Dorothy Brock retired with her greatly beloved sister Elsie, who also never married, to Whitstable in Kent, where seabathing long formed part of their daily routine. As well as involving herself in local affairs, she was for many years a director of the University of London Press, overseeing in particular its output of school books. She died after a long illness on 31 December 1969, at Barham Nursing Home, Barham, eager to the last for news of the Mary Datchelor and perhaps unaware that its future within the evolving comprehensive system was precarious; it eventually closed in 1981. A memorial service was held on 20 February 1970 at St Martin-in-the-Fields, London.<br>
<br>Dorothy Brock was witty, eloquent, and handsome, dressing with a casual elegance which enhanced her feminine charm. Her interest in people of all sorts was unfeigned and she was an unfailing source of kindly, practical advice, backed by a moral authority made all the greater by the lightness of her touch. Normally high-spirited, she had her bleak moments, discernible only to the most observant. In good times and bad she was sustained, latterly as an Anglican, by a deeply held Christian faith.<br>
