<span class="headword">Sillett,  James</span>  (1764&#150;1840), <span class="occ">painter</span>, son of James Sillett of Eye, Suffolk, was born in Norwich, where he was apprenticed as a heraldic painter. He moved to London, possibly in 1781. Initially employed as a copyist for the Polygraphic Society, he later joined William Capon as a scene-painter at Drury Lane Theatre. Various sources, including Sillett himself  (<span class="italic">Norwich Mercury</span>, 4 July 1812), claim that he studied at the Royal Academy Schools. He is not, however, entered in the register, although his ticket for admission to the winter lectures for 1796 exists in the Reeve collection at the British Museum. In 1801 he married Ann Banyard of East Dereham, through whom he came into property. They had five children, three of whom died in infancy, the two surviving being his daughter <a href="#cosubject_71828">Emma [<i>see below</i>]</a>, baptized at St Stephen, Norwich, on 21 February 1802, and son Edwin James, born on 16 April 1803.<br>
<br>Sillett returned to Norwich in 1801, advertising private tuition, evening classes, and afternoon schools in the local press. He was swiftly established within the local artistic scene, associating with the leaders of the Norwich Society of Artists, founded in 1803. He remained there except for a four-year period between 1804 and 1808 when he relocated to Norfolk Street, King's Lynn, teaching drawing and, in January 1808, exhibiting examples of his own work at Mr Lockett's Coffee House in the Market Place. His association with King's Lynn endured, and he produced the illustrations for William Richard's <span class="italic">History of Lynn</span> of 1812.<br>
<br>Sillett exhibited forty-three works at the Royal Academy between 1796 and 1837, including miniatures, landscapes, and still lifes. It was for his paintings of game, fruit, and flowers that he was chiefly known. These are characterized by immaculate draughtsmanship, precise finishing, and by their debt to Dutch masters. In particular, Sillett's more academic style distinguishes his landscapes from those of Norwich contemporaries who painted local scenery with a more open mind to nature. Examples include <span class="italic">Flowers and Fruit</span> (1827) and <span class="italic">Thorpe Garden Public House</span> (1818; Norwich Castle Museum), <span class="italic">Garden Mallows</span> (BM), and <span class="italic">Hollyhocks</span> (1807; V&amp;A). Claims in 1812 that his own specialization in still life restricted his teaching practice led Sillett to state publicly &#145;that his mode of teaching is by no means confined to fruit, flowers &amp;c as has been insinuated, but extends to the practice of Drawing in general&#146; and at the same time to suggest: &#145;there is more beauty in the delineation of a pig-sty or cart than in the human figure or the beautiful of the flower garden&#146;  (<span class="italic">Norwich Mercury</span>, 4, 11 July 1812).<br>
<br>Between 1806 and 1833 Sillett exhibited 289 works at the Norwich Society of Artists at Sir Benjamin Wrench's Court, and was vice-president, then president in 1814&#150;15. In 1816 he was one of a group of artists who broke away from that organization and in that same year was involved in the formation of the short-lived Norfolk and Norwich Society of Arts. He exhibited with other members of this society, including Robert Ladbrooke and John Thirtle, at the Theatre Plain, Norwich, until the group disbanded in 1818 and Sillett resumed his contributions to the Norwich Society of Artists. From 1823 he exhibited in other provincial centres such as Newcastle. Ackermanns, the artists' colourmen, published his <span class="italic">Grammar of Flower Painting</span> (1820). In 1828 he published a set of fifty-nine views of public edifices in Norwich, and travelled to Holland, visiting Rotterdam and Leiden, of which he exhibited views at the Norwich Society of Artists. Sillett died at St Peter per Mountergate, Norwich, on 6 May 1840. His wife and children survived him.<br>

<a name="cosubject_71828"></a><span class="headword">Emma Sillett</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1802, <em>d.</em> 1880) was herself a highly competent <span class="occ">flower painter</span>. Taught by her father, she is said to have been his nearest rival and began to assist him with his teaching in 1817. She exhibited forty-eight paintings at the Norwich Society of Artists between 1813 and 1833. There is no record of her having married. She died in 1880.<br>
