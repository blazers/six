<span class="headword">Lazell,  (Henry George) Leslie</span>  (1903&#150;1982), <span class="occ">pharmaceutical industrialist</span>, was born at 9 Canal Terrace, Camden Town, London, on 23 May 1903, the elder son (there were no daughters) of Henry William Lazell, a wine merchant's manager, who died prematurely, and his wife, Ada Louisa King. Leslie Lazell (as he was known) was educated at a London county council elementary school until he was thirteen and a half, when he became an office boy in the solicitor's department of the Inland Revenue at Somerset House. After the end of the First World War Lazell sat and failed the examination for a permanent civil service post. For a time he worked as a bookmaker's clerk and then joined the wholesale druggists Allen and Hanburys as a ledger keeper. Determined to succeed in life, he attended evening classes for his professional examinations, including those of the Association of Certified and Corporate Accountants and the Chartered Institute of Secretaries, which bodies later gave him fellowships. On 17 November 1928 he married Doris Beatrice, daughter of Edwin Try, an engineer; they had one son.<br>
<br>Lazell's first opportunity to show his worth came in 1930 when he was recruited as an accountant by Alexander Maclean, an enthusiastic marketing man who had founded the Macleans toothpaste and stomach powder firm. Maclean needed an up-to-date budgeting system; Lazell, having set this up, was made company secretary, and a director in 1936. His managerial horizons were widened when he became Macleans' representative on certain trade associations. Contact with his opposite numbers in international corporations such as Colgate and Sterling Drug persuaded him that unless British companies paid more attention to research, they would fall badly behind these giants.<br>
<br>In 1938 Philip Ernest Hill, chairman of Beechams, acquired Macleans. Almost immediately he made Lazell secretary of Beechams, in 1940 promoting him to the board and to its inner committee. Lazell then went back to take charge of the profitable Macleans. In wartime conditions of shortages and disruptions, he quickly learned how to improvise within the framework of a clear business strategy. Before Hill died in 1944, Lazell secured the board's authority to create a central research organization for the parent company, and in the following year the Beecham Group&#151;as it had become&#151;set up the Beecham Research Laboratories. Lazell's ultimate goal was to achieve some major pharmaceutical discovery. However, Hill's successor at Beechams, Sir Stanley Holmes (later first Baron Dovercourt) planned to diversify into wholesale groceries, and had little time for pharmaceutical research. Lazell therefore volunteered to take control of research, and meet its running costs out of the buoyant profits of Lucozade, a Macleans' glucose drink. Group profits, however, remained disappointing: groceries proved to be poor earners, and a widespread corporate malaise was exacerbated by infighting among senior executives. As a result Beechams earned a mediocre reputation in investment circles. Finally, in 1951, institutional investors forced Lazell's appointment as group managing director, mandated to give the company once again a sense of direction.<br>
<br>Lazell's initial task was to reorganize the group along more logical, and hence more profitable, lines. This involved amalgamating and restructuring more than a hundred subsidiary companies and their shareholdings, thus allowing Beechams to raise money on more advantageous terms. Not until 1962 was he able finally to create an organization of three&#151;later four&#151;divisions in product, and later regional, groupings. That step both rationalized production and marketing and permitted more effective head office control. On the sales side, he made the group into one of the largest advertisers in Britain; he adopted American publicity methods and improved on them by requiring top management personally to lead marketing teams.<br>
<br>Once the first phase of Lazell's corporate plan was satisfactorily launched, he arranged in 1954 for his researchers to begin investigations of antibiotics. The group's consultant, Sir Charles Edward Dodds, worked closely with Ernst Chain, the leading scientist in the field. Existing types of penicillin needed improvement, which they hoped to achieve by a chemical rather than by the existing biological process. Eventually the basic penicillin molecule, 6-APA (amino-penicillanic acid), was isolated. By 1959 Beechams had developed its first semi-synthetic penicillin, Broxil, obtaining some help from the American company Bristol&#150;Myers, with which a licensing agreement was concluded.<br>
<br>According to Lazell, it was in the early 1960s that the balance of the group's affairs shifted from proprietary goods towards pharmaceuticals, that decade being probably the most hectic for the group as a whole as well as for his research activities. As managing director, and then as chairman from 1958 onwards, he was the driving force in the conversion of Beechams into an international science-based and marketing orientated enterprise. To become truly international, the group needed above all to build up a strong presence in both the United States and Europe. While some products had little success in the American market, Brylcreem, the hair preparation, and Macleans' toothpaste both did well after some years of intensive marketing effort.<br>
<br>The considerable financial and management resources required for development in the United States delayed the group's entry into Europe on a large scale. Even so, by the time Lazell stepped down as chairman in 1968, the western hemisphere&#151;which included Australia and New Zealand&#151;accounted for almost a quarter of Beechams' sales and nearly a third of its profits, while continental Europe contributed one-seventh of sales and over a fifth of profits. In 1951&#150;2, the year of his appointment as managing director, group turnover had been &pound;25 million and profits &pound;2&frac12; million; in 1968&#150;9 turnover was &pound;134 million and profits &pound;25 million, the ratio having nearly doubled. Lazell was then made president of the Beecham group, and until 1972 retained the chairmanship of Beecham Inc. in the United States.<br>
<br>Like the company's founder, Thomas Beecham (1820&#150;1907), Lazell was essentially a self-educated man, almost uniquely so among those then at the head of a major UK manufacturing enterprise. He had a healthy disrespect for snobbery and nepotism, and never became assimilated into the British establishment; Lord Dovercourt is said to have dubbed him &#145;not one of us&#146;  (Lazell, <span class="italic">Pills</span>, 2). Possessing an incisive and analytical mind, he was quick to learn from both mentors and trusted lieutenants. As a layman he was able to pick up a working knowledge of the scientific technicalities of pharmaceutical research. He was a great reader, especially of autobiographies; as a young man he played cricket and squash, and later enjoyed yachting.<br>
<br>Lazell's outside professional interests were necessarily limited, and chosen very much to harmonize with his philosophy of life. A tireless and uncompromising free-market advocate, he was one of the original subscribers to the Institute of Economic Affairs, founded in 1957. Although in his outlook he was ahead of his time, he was granted no honours from the state or any university. He was chairman of the board of governors of Ashridge Management College and a council member of the Institute of Directors. He also acted as appeal president of the British Heart Foundation. He was hostile to bureaucracy in all its forms; as a non-executive director of ICI from 1966 to 1968, he regularly voiced his criticism of that company's top-heavy structure. In retirement he spent much of each year in Bermuda, but he was in London when he died of heart failure at his home, 3 Whaddon House, Williams Mews, Westminster, on 17 November 1982. As no will seems to have been proved in England, the value of his estate is unknown.<br>
