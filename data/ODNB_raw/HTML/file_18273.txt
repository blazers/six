<span class="headword">Mason,  George Henry Monck</span>  (1824&#150;1857), <span class="occ">administrator in India</span>, was born at Southampton on 23 October 1824, the only son of Captain Thomas Monck Mason RN (<i>d</i>. 1838), of co. Wicklow, Ireland, and his second wife, Mary (<i>d</i>. 1863), eldest daughter of Sir George Grey, first baronet. His father was a brother of Henry Joseph Monck Mason, writer, and William Monck Mason, historian of Ireland, and a nephew of John Monck Mason, writer on Shakespeare.<br>
<br>Mason was educated at King William's College, Isle of Man. In 1842 he entered the Bengal army as an ensign and in June 1843 was attached to the 74th regiment of native infantry, first at Nowgong and afterwards at Hoshangabad and Mhow. He was promoted lieutenant in October 1845, and in March 1847 was made assistant to the governor-general's agent in Rajputana. In this post he acquired a reputation for energy and resourcefulness, undertaking several arduous expeditions to hunt down Sindhi robber chiefs who raided the border areas of Rajputana.<br>
<br>In October 1854 Mason was appointed political agent at Karauli. Dalhousie admired his political skills and in March 1857, at the relatively young age of thirty-two, Mason was promoted to resident at Jodhpur. He was popular with the maharaja, Takht Singh, who, grateful for British backing in his struggles against his unruly nobles, stuck to the British throughout the uprising of 1857. Jodhpur remained quiet during the early months of the rising, but towards the end of August the Jodhpur legion mutinied at Erinpura and sought protection at Awah, a stronghold which was controlled by one of Takht Singh's most recalcitrant chiefs, Thakur Kushal Singh. Kushal Singh had no quarrel with the British and approached Mason with assurances that the rebels would surrender if they were guaranteed safety and a resumption of their old employment. Mason rejected this offer out of hand; he had just received orders forbidding any deals with rebels who were still in arms and he was wary of alienating Takht Singh by treating with one of his enemies. Rebuffed, Kushal Singh threw his lot in with the rebels.<br>
<br>In September, Brigadier-General George Lawrence approached Awah with a small force, intending to reduce it quickly. Ignoring Takht Singh's warnings of danger, Mason insisted on leading a few of the maharaja's troops to Lawrence's assistance. However, by the time he arrived at Awah, on 18 September, the battle was already raging. He dismounted and set off alone through the jungle in search of Lawrence's camp, but was almost immediately shot and cut down by rebel sowars. Lawrence, meanwhile, was forced to retreat.<br>
<br>Mason was survived by his wife, Sarah Louisa, daughter of Dr John Cheyne, queen's physician in Ireland, whom he had married at Calcutta on 10 February 1850, and by three surviving small children&#151;a son, Gordon George Monck (<i>b</i>. 1850), who went on to join the Indian Civil Service, and two daughters, Secelia Mary Monck (<i>b</i>. 1850) and Alice Frances Monck (<i>b</i>. 1853). A second son, Leslie Arthur Cheyne Monck, had died in infancy.<br>
