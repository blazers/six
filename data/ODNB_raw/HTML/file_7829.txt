<span class="headword">Dorigny, Sir  Nicholas</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1658, <em>d.</em> 1746), <span class="occ">painter and engraver</span>, was baptized in Paris on 2 June 1658, the second son of Michel Dorigny (1617&#150;1665), a painter and engraver, and his wife, who was the daughter of the painter Simon Vouet. He may have had some training in art from his father, but was said by George Vertue to have been brought up to be a lawyer. In 1687, however, he joined his brother Louis Dorigny (1654&#150;1742) in Rome, where the latter was established as a painter. There Nicholas Dorigny took up etching, imitating the new style of G&eacute;rard Audran. At first he worked for the dominant publisher Giovanni Giacomo de Rossi, producing prints after Gianlorenzo Bernini and Carlo Maratta. Dorigny's etchings of the cupola of the church of Santa Agnese in piazza Navona, after Ciro Ferri, were published by de Rossi in 1690. His next project, <span class="italic">The Marriage of Cupid and Psyche</span>, in the entrance loggia of the Farnesina (1693), was the foundation of his reputation as an interpreter of Raphael.<br>
<br>About this time Dorigny learned to engrave because &#145;he found for want of haveing learnt the handling &amp; use of the Graver, he cou'd not arrive to the Perfection or harmony he aimed at&#146;  (Vertue, <span class="italic">Note Books</span>, 1.51). With the <span class="italic">Planetarium</span> (1695), which reproduced the ceiling of the Chigi chapel in Santa Maria del Popolo, Dorigny also began to publish his own plates. He published paintings in San Pietro, Rome, after Cigoli, Domenichino, Guercino, and Lanfranco (1697&#150;1700), and Domenichino's evangelists in Sant' Andrea (1707). He continued to work for de Rossi, engraving thirty-one statues for his <span class="italic">Raccolta di statue antiche e moderne</span> (1704). His large engraving of Raphael's <span class="italic">Transfiguration</span> (1705) &#145;got him justly the reputation of the first graver in Europe&#146;  (Vertue, <span class="italic">Note books</span>, 6.187). To this he published a companion, <span class="italic">The Descent from the Cross</span>, after Daniele da Volterra, in 1710.<br>
<br>In June 1711 Dorigny's pre-eminent reputation as an interpreter of Raphael secured him an invitation from Robert Harley and other virtuosi to travel to England to engrave the most important paintings in the country, Raphael's tapestry cartoons of <span class="italic">The Acts of the Apostles</span> at Hampton Court. This was the most significant commission for engravings ever yet placed in England: for this reason Vertue left detailed notes on its progress, remarking that Dorigny was enticed both by the challenge and by the prospect of making further sales of his prints in London, having already sold many to Englishmen in Rome. His arrival in England coincided with the establishment of an academy in Great Queen Street, of which, on 18 October 1711, he was elected a director.<br>
<br>Originally it had been intended that the cartoons would be engraved at the queen's expense in order to provide suitable presents for the nobility and for foreign ministers. However, Dorigny's demand for &pound;4000 to &pound;5000 &#145;put a full stop to that affair&#146;  (Vertue, <span class="italic">Note books</span>, 6.187), and instead the novel English method of raising a subscription was attempted. After the queen had agreed to allow Dorigny an apartment at Hampton Court &#145;during the time he should be doing them and fireing &amp; a bottle of Wine daily&#146;  (ibid.), this was launched on 25 October 1711 with advertisements in <span class="italic">The Spectator</span> and (repeatedly) in the <span class="italic">Daily Courant</span>. A month later Richard Steele devoted an issue of <span class="italic">The Spectator</span> to the moral value of history painting in general and of the cartoons in particular, in which he commended to his readers this initiative to engrave what the subscription described as &#145;the most valuable Set of portable Pictures in the World&#146;. Tactful efforts were made to disguise the Frenchness of an artist announced as &#145;Signior Nicola Dorigny (lately come from Rome)&#146;. The set was offered to subscribers for the &#145;modest&#146; price of 4 guineas. This was easily the highest price ever asked in England for a set of prints.<br>
<br>Dorigny began work on the cartoons at Easter 1712. The first year was employed in making accurate scaled-down drawings, and in 1713 he brought over from Paris Charles Dupuis and Claude Du Bosc to help with the engraving. In January 1714 he advertised that proofs of two of the prints might be inspected by potential subscribers. Eventually, in March 1719, the subscription was closed; the plates were printed and in April the prints were delivered to subscribers. On 1 April 1719 Dorigny presented the king with two sets of the prints and gave one set to the prince of Wales and another to the princess. In recognition of these gifts Dorigny was presented with a large gold medal from the prince and with 100 guineas from the king. He was knighted by the king in June 1720 at the instance of the duke of Devonshire. A collection of ninety heads from Dorigny's drawings of the tapestries dedicated to the princess of Wales was published in 1722.<br>
<br>According to Vertue, Dorigny was &#145;thick of hearing inclining to deafness&#146;  (Vertue, <span class="italic">Note books</span>, <span class="italic">Note Books</span>, 1.51) and did not understand English. His drawings, which Vertue admired, were sold by auction on 21 February 1723. Selling at from 6 to 12 guineas each, with 52 guineas for the cartoons, the total price realized was &pound;320. Dorigny gave up engraving around that time owing to the impairment of his eyesight. On 9 April 1724 he retired to Paris with the means to live without working, thanks to his savings, legacies from relations, and the income he continued to derive from his engraved plates. There he was elected an <i>academicien</i> on 28 September 1725. In retirement he took up painting again and exhibited at the salons of 1739 and 1743. He died in Paris on 1 December 1746. According to Vertue, &#145;The Number of Plates gravd by Mr Dorigny big &amp; small [came to] 153&#146;  (ibid., 1.56). His prints and drawings may be found in the Clarke collection at Worcester College, the Ashmolean Museum, and the Bodleian Library in Oxford, and also in the British Museum, London, the Biblioth&egrave;que Nationale, Paris, and the Nationalmuseum, Stockholm.<br>
