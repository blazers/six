<span class="headword">Owen,  Thankful</span>  (1620&#150;1681), <span class="occ">Independent divine</span>, was born in the City of London, the son of Philip Owen of Taplow, Buckinghamshire, gentleman, a member of the common council of the City of London, and Joane Smith. Owen attended St Paul's School, which granted him an exhibition to Oxford University. He matriculated from Exeter College on 1 June 1636, aged sixteen, and it was perhaps about this time that &#145;he was remarkably preserved in his youth as he was swimming near Oxford, after he had twice sunk under water&#146;  (Calamy, 1.181). He graduated BA on 16 January 1640 and was elected a fellow of Lincoln College in 1642. According to Wood, he then &#145;left the university, and so consequently did not bear arms for his majesty, as other scholars did, within the garrison of Oxford&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>: <span class="italic">Fasti</span>, 2.90). At the end of the civil war, on 1 July 1646, he proceeded MA. At a meeting of the court of assistants of St Paul's School on 5 November, Owen was &#145;restored to his Exhibition of &pound;10 per annum from Midsummer last and 20 nobles (&pound;6/13/4d) was granted to him towards the incouragement in his studies and his taking his degree&#146;  (McDonnell).<br>
<br>In 1647 Owen co-operated with the parliamentary commission set up to reform and regulate the university and on 30 September was appointed one of the Lincoln College delegates to the visitors. On 11 May 1648 he formally submitted to the authority of parliament vested in them and eight days later was appointed by the proctors one of the twenty delegates to be answerable for the affairs of the university. On 5 July Owen became one of the examiners of candidates for fellowships and scholarships. On 13 March 1649, in an irregular appointment, for it was not the turn of his college, he was named senior proctor for the university: &#145;Queen's seems to have had no one who could be trusted&#146; and Owen was &#145;more in the confidence of the Visitors than even Cheynell&#146;  (Burrows, 287). The moderate presbyterian Francis Cheynell was coming to the end of his reign at St John's. Following his resignation, on 6 September 1650, Thankful Owen, a &#145;pious man, of an unblameable conversation, and in regard of his good parts, learning and public spirit&#146;  (Costin, 111), was appointed president of St John's College by the committee for the reformation of the universities. The senior fellows of the college consented to the new appointment, but did not let Owen get all his own way. The following year the attempts of the college to fill only one vacancy were rejected by the fellows who elected three new members; in the conflict over this, Owen found it prudent to retreat. But, also in 1651, he was added to the list of preachers before the university, a move which reflected the shift towards the Independents.<br>
<br>On 3 August 1652 at St Andrew's, Plymouth, Owen married Loveday, daughter of Sir Francis Vivian of Trelowarren, Cornwall, but otherwise he remained in Oxford. On 15 June 1652 a new parliamentary committee was appointed, of which Owen was a member. Its first known meeting was on 20 June 1653, and Owen was a regular attender. He was one of the commission of triers or approvers under the ordinance of 20 March 1654. There is no doubt of Owen's puritan outlook or his religious independency, and many ministers sent their sons to St John's during the protectorate. Yet the pace of reform there was slow and there were complaints that the president assigned college property on favourable leases to friends and relations. In the university Owen became a member of the third interregnum body of visitors, appointed by Cromwell on 2 September 1654, and attended its meetings until 1657. On 24 September 1659, with John Owen (1616&#150;1683), he was ordered to preach at Whitehall during October and November or to provide another &#145;person of eminent Godliness and gifts for the work&#146;, and was ordered to be paid &pound;20 for his pains  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1659&#150;60</i>, 221).<br>
<br>Owen signed the college register for the last time on 19 July 1660, before his ejection by the commissioners. Not long after he was discovered by the militia at Stadhampton, the estate of his namesake, the extruded vice-chancellor and dean of Christ Church. He then moved to London, and before October 1665 was living in Tree Alley, Bunhill. On 22 July 1677 he married his second wife, Ann Vivian, at St Edmund's, Salisbury, Wiltshire. He published <span class="italic">A true and lively representation of popery, showing that popery is only new modell'd paganism and perfectly destructive of the great ends and purposes of God in the gospel</span> (1679), but gained greater fame as the joint editor, with John Barron, of the works of Thomas Goodwin. Following the death of Goodwin in February 1680, Owen was chosen to succeed him as pastor of the Independent congregation in Fetter Lane, London, but he died suddenly, on Good Friday, 1 April 1681, at his house in Hatton Garden. He was buried near Goodwin in Bunhill Fields. In his will Owen left freehold property at Llangofen in Monmouthshire, the county of his father's father, &#145;granted me by the bishop, archdeacon and chapter of Llandaff&#146;  (will, TNA: PRO, PROB 11/368, fol. 21<i>v</i>). He was reportedly a man &#145;of genteel learning and an excellent temper; admired for an uncommon fluency and easiness in his composures and for the peculiar purity of his Latin style&#146;  (Calamy, <span class="italic">Abridgement</span>, 2.181).<br>
