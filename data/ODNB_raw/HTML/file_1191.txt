<span class="headword">Balfour,  John</span>, third Lord Balfour of Burleigh  (<em>d.</em> 1696/7), <span class="occ">nobleman</span>, was the son and heir of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1195/', "Robert Balfour (formerly Arnot), second Lord Balfour of Burleigh (d. 1663)")</script>, and Margaret Balfour, Lady Balfour (<i>d</i>. 1639), who married in 1606. After being sent to France to complete his education and to avoid the dangers of civil war, he managed to embroil himself in a quarrel with another nobleman and subsequently fought a duel in defence of his honour, in which he was badly wounded. Whether on account of this affray, or as a response to the deteriorating political situation of the French crown, he determined to travel back home to Scotland early in 1649. His journey took him to London, where he met and hastily married his kinswoman Isabel, the daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1198/', "Sir William Balfour of Pitcullo (d. 1660)")</script>, lieutenant of the Tower of London. However, his father had not been informed of the match, and when the couple returned to his estates in March 1649 he attempted to have their union annulled, purely on the grounds that he had not given his permission for it. Greatly angered, Lord Balfour brought the case before the general assembly of the Church of Scotland, but received no answer to his petition. The matter was sidelined and quickly forgotten by the assembly, and John and his bride went on to raise a family of three sons and six daughters in quiet obscurity. John inherited the title of Lord Balfour of Burleigh from his father in August 1663, and died between 10 December 1696 and 27 February 1697. However, he gained a posthumous and entirely undeserved notoriety, as a covenanter rebel, through the confusion of his identity with that of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/67514/', "John Balfour of Kinloch (fl. 1663&#150;1683)")</script>, who had been nicknamed &#145;Burley&#146; purely on account of his appearance.<br>
