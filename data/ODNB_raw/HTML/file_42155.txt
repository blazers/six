<span class="headword">Fenston,  Felix Donovan</span>  (1915&#150;1970), <span class="occ">property developer</span>, was born on 21 April 1915 at 41 Cleveland Mansions, Paddington, London, the son of Joseph Fenston, a theatrical impresario and trader of Swiss-Jewish origin, and his wife, Mona Th&eacute;r&egrave;se Donovan, who was Irish. He went to school at the Regent Street Polytechnic, sharing a desk at the age of eleven with Jack Rose, who also went on to be a major property developer. Fenston's father wanted the boy to become a concert pianist; he never reached concert standard but was nevertheless a competent player. Instead Fenston became an estate agent, working at several firms including that of the well-known Hampstead-based agent Max Joseph. He also attended evening classes at the College of Estate Management though, according to Marriott, he was often asleep during them  (Marriott, 15).<br>
<br>During the Second World War Fenston, who was then a corporal in the intelligence corps, had a serious motorcycle accident in which his leg was crushed. However, despite its replacement with an aluminium limb, he later engaged in shooting, squash, and underwater diving. The accident nevertheless ended his military service and in 1944 he moved back to commercial property. Following the war he set up a property-dealing business, occupying one room in Egyptian House, Piccadilly. His first deal was the purchase of a shoe repair shop at Watford, which he refurbished and leased back to the cobbler. The expanding scope of his operations allowed him to move in 1952 to 19 Hill Street, Mayfair, to which he transferred his headquarters. Later additional residences and estates included a country house in Wiltshire, a manor house in Guildford, and a shooting lodge in Scotland.<br>
<br>Fenston foresaw the post-war office boom; he claimed that in 1945 he wrote a memo to his father suggesting that the largest possible fund should be assembled for investment in office property  (Marriott, 100&#150;101). During the immediate post-war years he cultivated close relationships with a number of commercial estate agents, including Dudley Witting of Jones Lang Wootton, and the brothers Jack and Philip Rose. Fenston was also associated with one of the best-known property developers of the time, Harry Hyams, who was later responsible for the notorious Centre Point building in London's Tottenham Court Road. Fenston offered such figures the opportunity to participate in the profits from his projects, in return for their valuable assistance in putting together deals; another frequent investor in his developments was the &eacute;migr&eacute; Polish aristocrat Prince Stanislas Radziwill. While taking in outside investors diluted Fenston's profits from each venture, the extra capital accelerated the growth of his business empire.<br>
<br>In 1956 Fenston and Hyams acquired the Baranquilla Railway and Pier Company, and used it as a vehicle for their property transactions. During 1957 Baranquilla announced a financing deal with Pearl Assurance, whereby the Pearl provided long-term debenture finance and obtained 10 per cent of Baranquilla's ordinary shares, with an option on a further 10 per cent. While such arrangements became common over the next few years, at the time this marked a pioneering innovation in property development finance.<br>
<br>Fenston's developments included the Empress State Building in Earls Court, the BP head-office building in the Barbican, and Kensington's Royal Garden Hotel. By 1959 he was involved in three separate quoted property companies (Eron, Barranquilla, and Alquife) and had made a fortune estimated at &pound;4 million. However, at about this time Fenston and Hyams had a shattering row, which resulted in the unravelling of most of their business alliances. Fenston became bored with his property activities and devoted the next couple of years to travelling and other leisure pursuits. When he resumed development he formed a larger team so that he did not have to play as great a role in day-to-day management. In 1963 he floated a new company, Metropolitan and Provincial, for &pound;3.75 million; this was taken over by Star (Great Britain) in 1968.<br>
<br>Marriott described Fenston as an atypical developer, &#145;more like an Edwardian dilettante, born to a cultivated life of pleasure, playing with a shrewd talent for property as a sideline&#146;  (Marriott, 101). His interests included playing the piano, shooting big game, and his estate in Wiltshire. An obituary in <span class="italic">The Times</span> commented on his zest and enthusiasm for life: &#145;Business, music, the arts, politics, boxing, shooting, the countryside, were all his life and he was totally absorbed in each and every one of them&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 16 Sept 1970). In a further tribute the Garter king of arms recalled his help in establishing a museum of heraldry adjacent to the College of Arms. Fenston became a trustee of the College of Arms Trust and was &#145;as magnanimous in his generosity as he was wise and discerning in his professional advice&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 18 Sept 1970).<br>
<br>While he enjoyed the pleasures of an affluent lifestyle and was less driven by business than most of his major contemporaries in the property world Fenston was, nevertheless, one of the most outstanding and successful developers of the post-war era. He died on 13 September 1970 of a coronary thrombosis while on a train journey from Inverness to London, leaving an estate worth over &pound;12 million. He was fifty-five. His will named his wife, Margaret Anne (Greta), and two sons and a daughter, but other details of his family life are unknown.<br>
