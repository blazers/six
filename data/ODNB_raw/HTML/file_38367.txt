<span class="headword">Pearson,  Charles</span>  (1793&#150;1862), <span class="occ">lawyer and urban reformer</span>, was born on 4 October 1793 at 25 Clement's Lane, London, son of Thomas Pearson, upholsterer and feather merchant, and his wife, Sarah. Educated at Eastbourne, Sussex, he was initially apprenticed to his father, but was admitted solicitor in 1816, and developed an extensive practice. He was made free of the Haberdashers' Company in 1817, and in the same year, on 20 March, married Mary Martha Dutton (<i>d</i>. 1871) of Brixton; their only child, Mary Dutton Pearson, was born in 1820.<br>
<br>Pearson began an active career in the City of London as common councilman for Bishopsgate ward, 1817&#150;20 and 1830&#150;36, becoming chairman of the City board of health in 1831&#150;3, and under-sheriff in 1834&#150;5. He was an active supporter of reform measures: the issues for which he campaigned included the freedom of Jews to hold public office, abolition of capital punishment, and reformatory treatment for juvenile offenders. He was opposed to the established church, and in favour of free trade, and similar &#145;progressive&#146; causes. He protested against the practice of packing juries in political cases, and he is credited with the City's decision, taken in 1831, to erase the words in the inscription on the Monument which attributed the Great Fire of 1666 to &#145;the Popish faction&#146;. He was a thorn in the flesh of the London gas companies. He &#145;felt passionately about whatever cause was for the moment uppermost in his mind&#146;  (Heap, 21&#150;2).<br>
<br>In 1839 Pearson was appointed City solicitor and held the office until his death. In this position, and as MP for Lambeth from 1847 to 1850, he campaigned, by speech, pamphlet, and influence, for London improvements of many kinds: the embankment of the Thames, a new meat market, a central railway terminus in the Fleet valley (which happily did not come to anything), and improved transport by an underground railway. In this last he was successful. Pearson was associated, with the City's consent, with early versions of this project, and in 1857 he joined forces with the promoters of the Metropolitan Railway from Paddington to Farringdon Street, which was in financial doldrums with no work started; the City took &pound;200,000 in shares in 1859 (which it later sold at a profit), and Pearson's skilful advice and lobbying were largely responsible for the work coming to fruition, four months after his death.<br>
<br>This was, however, only part of his vision, which also encompassed workers' housing in healthy suburban conditions away from the pent-up courts and alleys of the City, linked by railway communication with cheap workmen's fares. In this he was a visionary for his time; later generations took up the concept. Pearson died on 14 September 1862 at his home, Oxford Lodge, West Hill, Wandsworth, having suffered from dropsy, despite which he had continued to work up to a week before his death. He was buried in Norwood cemetery on 23 September. His wife survived him.<br>
<br>Without Pearson's constant advocacy&#151;his gadfly conduct, which he managed to combine with holding high office in the City of London&#151;the Metropolitan Railway, the first of its kind in the world, and the nucleus of London's underground system, could not have come into existence when it did.<br>
