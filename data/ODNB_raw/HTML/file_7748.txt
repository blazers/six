<span class="headword">Dodds,  James</span>  (1812&#150;1885), <span class="occ">Free Church of Scotland minister and author</span>, was born at Hitchell Yett, Cummertrees, near Annan, Dumfriesshire, on 13 August 1812, the eldest son of William Dodds and his wife, Helen Irving, a relative of Edward Irving. He was educated at parish schools in Annan and Ruthwell, before attending the University of Edinburgh, where he gained the highest distinction in the class of Professor John Wilson. For a brief time he was tutor in the family of Henry Duncan, the well-known minister of Ruthwell. After studying for the ministry in the Church of Scotland, Dodds was licensed to preach in 1839 and assisted at Inveresk, Musselburgh, before his appointment to Humbie, East Lothian, in 1841. In 1843, after he had joined the Free Church, he was called to Dunbar, where he remained for the rest of his life. On 3 February 1843 he married Duncan's only daughter, Barbara Anne.<br>
<br>Dodds devoted his leisure time to literary pursuits: he was a frequent contributor to various periodicals, including the <span class="italic">Christian Treasury</span>, <span class="italic">Sunday at Home</span>, and <span class="italic">Leisure Hour</span>, and was an early editor of the <span class="italic">Dumfries and Galloway Courier</span>, which belonged to his father-in-law. In 1846 he published <span class="italic">A Century of Scottish Church History</span>, an outline of Scottish religious history from the Secession of 1733 until the Disruption in 1843. He wrote a biographical sketch of his friend Patrick Fairbairn, which was published in the latter's <span class="italic">Pastoral Theology</span> in 1875, as well as a memoir of the Revd Thomas Rosie, entitled <span class="italic">Coast Missions</span> (1862). His taste for biography was further indulged in <span class="italic">Famous Men of Dumfriesshire</span> (n.d.), a collection of sketches of well-known figures from his native region. He also wrote a memoir of his cousin James Dodds, which was published with the latter's <span class="italic">Lays of the Covenanters</span> in 1880, and a novel about the Disruption, <span class="italic">Jeannie Wilson, the Lily of Lammermoor</span> (1876). The <span class="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</span> claimed that Dodds was a regular correspondent of Thomas Carlyle, another native of Dumfriesshire, but this contention is not borne out by the sole letter addressed to him in Carlyle's collected letters. Dodds died on 3 September 1885 at Dunbar.<br>
