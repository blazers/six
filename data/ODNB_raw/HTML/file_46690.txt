<span class="headword">Findlay,  Joseph John</span>  (1860&#150;1940), <span class="occ">educationist</span>, was born on 6 September 1860 at Wesley Place, Barton upon Humber, Lincolnshire, the younger son of James Findlay, a Wesleyan minister, and his wife, Mary (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Hare). He was educated at Kingswood School, Bath, at Wadham College, Oxford (where he gained firsts in mathematical moderations in 1881 and history in 1883), and at the universities of Jena and Leipzig, gaining his PhD at the latter in 1893. He was a teacher at Bath College (1884&#150;5) and headmaster of two Wesleyan proprietary schools (Queen's College, Taunton, and Wesley College, Sheffield) between 1885 and 1891, before undertaking a study of the educational philosophy of Herbart (1776&#150;1841) and methods of teacher training, at Jena and Leipzig under professors Rein and Ziller. Much of his later career in London and Manchester was spent disseminating Herbartian principles and methodology, and in integrating theory and practice in teacher training using the Ziller paradigm of the demonstration school.<br>
<br>Findlay returned briefly to England to teach at Rugby School in 1893&#150;4, which inspired his first book, <span class="italic">Arnold of Rugby</span> (1897). He then visited North America to witness the spread of Herbartian ideas and to report on American education for the royal commission on secondary education. His appointment to a lectureship (1895&#150;8) in the College of Preceptors, London, gave him the opportunity to lecture and to write about Herbatian methodology in the <span class="italic">Journal of Education</span>. Above all it involved him in the creation of the first rationalist demonstration school of the King Alfred School Society, Hampstead. Invited to draw up the curriculum of the flagship school, he based it upon the &#145;scientific application&#146; of the Herbartian aim of developing &#145;many-sided interests&#146; through a &#145;concentrated&#146; curriculum which integrated subjects. In 1898 he rejected the directorship of this co-educational day school (which excluded religion, preparation for examinations, and punishment) for the headship of Cardiff's first intermediate school for boys, although he remained associated with the venture as its president until 1937.<br>
<br>At Cardiff Intermediate School for Boys, from 1898 to 1903, Findlay was involved in a very different educational experiment, with the introduction of a new kind of wider access secondary school under the <span class="roman">Welsh Intermediate Education Act</span> of 1889. The curriculum, based upon rigid subject hierarchies with the classics at its apex, examination success, and formal discipline, was totally at variance with that of King Alfred's and with that which he devised for the Letchworth Garden City Association in 1903; its undue emphasis on the classics and examinations was criticized by Sir Philip Magnus. Nevertheless, the period was productive in that Findlay wrote <span class="italic">Laudate, a Hymn and Tune Book for Secondary Schools</span> (1901) and <span class="italic">Principles of Class Teaching</span> (1902), which broke new ground, being written from &#145;the workshop instead of the lecture room&#146;.<br>
<br>The integration of lecture room theory and classroom practice became Findlay's principal and controversial mission as Sarah Fielden professor of education at Manchester between 1903 and 1925, a post which he had been persuaded to accept rather than the more prestigious Bell professorship at Edinburgh. His use of the Sarah Fielden demonstration school to produce professionals able to analyse classroom processes rather than teachers versed in &#145;technical tricks of a dubious kind&#146; placed him at the forefront of contemporary educational debate and at odds with the university authorities and many within his own department. His radical approach, well illustrated in <span class="italic">The Demonstration Schools Record</span> (1908&#150;12), was also found in the books he published both before his retirement in 1925 (<span class="italic">The School</span>, 1912, <span class="italic">The Young Wage-Earner</span>, 1918), and afterwards (especially his celebrated two-volume <span class="italic">The Foundations of Education</span>, 1925, 1927), and in the active interest he had in the teaching of modern languages.<br>
<br>In 1923 and 1924 Findlay unsuccessfully stood as the Labour Party parliamentary candidate for the Combined English Universities. On 20 December 1890 he married Charlotte Anne (1859/60&#150;1938), daughter of Thomas James Denne, manufacturer, of Hemel Hempstead. Resident in Devon after his retirement, he died at Fulwood, Vansittart Road, Torquay, on 9 June 1940.<br>
