<span class="headword">Briggs,  Richard</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1788), <span class="occ">writer on cookery</span>, was for many years at the Globe tavern, Fleet Street; the White Hart, Holborn; and the Temple Coffee House, Fleet Street, London. His book, <span class="italic">The English Art of Cookery</span>, was first published in 1788 and by 1798 it had gone into several editions in England, Ireland, and America. Its name was changed to <span class="italic">The New Art of Cookery</span> for the subsequent American editions.<br>
<br>Briggs's book was aimed at housekeepers and has been described as &#145;largely a plagiarisation or, more charitably, a competent revision and enlargement&#146; of John Farley's <span class="italic">The London Art of Cookery</span> of 1783  (Mennell, 99). However, Briggs's work reveals considerable improvements over Farley's. Cooking times, methods, and quantities of ingredients are often clarified and Briggs includes a wider range of foods&#151;notably fish and vegetables. Interestingly he broke new ground by including recipes for fish rarely mentioned in eighteenth-century cookery books, such as &#145;To Boil John-a-Dore&#146;, a simple recipe remarkably similar to one favoured by James Quin, the actor renowned for his predilection for this fish  (Davidson, 81). Although the book was predominantly about English food there were none the less German, Spanish, West Indian, Italian, Dutch, French, and Jewish influences in the recipes. Some were adapted and others are identical with recipes found in Hannah Glasse's <span class="italic">The Art of Cookery</span> (1747) and Elizabeth Raffald's <span class="italic">The Experienced English Housekeeper</span> (1769). Both writers were major sources for <span class="italic">The London Art of Cookery</span>, and Briggs selected additional recipes not found in Farley's book.<br>
<br>Little is known of Briggs, but in the preface to his book he revealed that he was &#145;one whose Habits of Life have been active, and not studious&#146;. This may account for the unusual spelling of occasional words, for example &#145;Gou de Vou&#146; for Godiveau, &#145;Peregoe&#146; for Perigueux, and &#145;Hollybert&#146; for the now obsolete hollybut (halibut), as well as &#145;John-a-Dore&#146; already mentioned.<br>
