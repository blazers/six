<span class="headword">Ellis,  Thomas Edward <span class="st"> [Tom]</span></span>  (1859&#150;1899), <span class="occ">politician and Welsh nationalist</span>, was born at Cynlas Farm, Cefnddwysarn, near Bala, Merioneth, on 16 February 1859, the third of six surviving children and only son of Thomas Ellis, tenant farmer, and his wife, Elizabeth Williams. That same year one of Ellis's relatives was evicted from his holding by the local landlord for voting Liberal in the general election. A Calvinistic Methodist, Ellis was educated at the British School, Llandderfel, and then at the grammar school in Bala. In 1875 he entered the newly established University College of Wales, Aberystwyth, where his contemporaries included many other nationally minded young Welshmen. He left Aberystwyth in 1879 and spent a year in Oxford on a non-collegiate basis. Entering New College as an undergraduate in October 1880, he became deeply stirred by the social and imperialist ideas current in Oxford at the time. He graduated in 1884 with a second-class honours degree in modern history, taking his BA in 1885 and his MA in 1897. After a short period as a private tutor, he became private secretary to the Liberal industrialist MP Sir John Brunner. A political career was now inevitable and in the July 1886 general election he was elected MP for his native county of Merioneth.<br>
<br>In the next six years, he emerged as an ardent champion of the nonconformist causes of Welsh church disestablishment and tithe reform, the Welsh tenant farmers' campaign for land reform, and Irish home rule. He was also much involved in the passage of the <span class="roman">Welsh Intermediate Education Act</span> in 1889 and the movement for a national University of Wales. He became close to other young Welsh Liberal members, including David Lloyd George. In September 1890 Ellis's declaration at Bala on behalf of a Welsh legislative assembly made a strong, though transient, impression: he seemed the very embodiment of &#145;Young Wales&#146;. However, he suffered from indifferent health, and a visit to Egypt led to his becoming seriously ill from typhoid. To help himself recover, he travelled to South Africa in the winter of 1890&#150;91, where he met Cecil Rhodes, who greatly impressed him.<br>
<br>When the Liberals returned to power in 1892, it was generally assumed that Ellis would receive government office. But it was a surprise when Gladstone offered him the post of deputy whip, an offer which he decided to accept. This was to drive something of a wedge between him and Lloyd George and other former Welsh allies. Ellis could still work on behalf of Wales, notably in the appointment of a Welsh land commission, and the foundation of a University of Wales, both in 1893; but he disapproved of Lloyd George's efforts to turn Welsh Liberalism into a nationalist movement somewhat on the lines of the Irish one. Ellis became chief whip in March 1894 when Lord Rosebery succeeded Gladstone as prime minister, and found life exceptionally difficult since the Liberals had only the narrowest of majorities. He was blamed for being too lax a disciplinarian, and indeed for the defeat on the snap &#145;cordite&#146; vote on 21 June 1895, which saw the government resign. After his party's heavy defeat in the subsequent general election, Ellis stayed on as chief whip. In addition to his close involvement in Welsh affairs, he was active in trying to recruit more Labour candidates for the Liberals. He was broadly in the Liberal Imperialist camp, and played a somewhat curious role in the manoeuvres that followed the Jameson raid in South Africa.<br>
<br>Tom Ellis was a deeply cultured man, of much personal charm, with a strong interest in Welsh art and literature: he edited the works of the seventeenth-century puritan mystic Morgan Llwyd. He was active in the movement for a national library and became warden of the University Guild of Graduates in 1896. His politics and cultural interests combined to make him a nationalist of an unusually rounded kind. Some saw him as a prophet, a Welsh Kossuth or Mazzini, a &#145;lost leader&#146;. He would hardly have risen as high as his colleague Lloyd George but, had he lived, would surely have been a major figure in the Liberal government of 1905&#150;15.<br>
<br>In 1898 Ellis married Annie, the daughter of Robert Joseph Davies, freehold farmer and a leading Calvinistic Methodist, of Cwrt-Mawr, Llangeitho, Cardiganshire. They had one son, born after Ellis's death. His health continued to be uncertain and on 5 April 1899, aged only forty, he died at the H&ocirc;tel M&eacute;tropole, Cannes, during a brief holiday on the French riviera.<br>
