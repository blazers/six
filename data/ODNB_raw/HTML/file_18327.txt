<span class="headword">Mather,  William</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1657&#150;1708), <span class="occ">pamphleteer and schoolmaster</span>, was born in Bedford. Nothing is known about his family, other than that his grandfather was a mayor of Hull. Appointed a surveyor of highways, Mather trained as a schoolmaster, and kept a private school in Bedfordshire. The latter post inspired his chief literary work, an enhanced primer entitled, <span class="italic">A Very Useful Manual, or, The Young Man's Companion</span>, which was printed in London in 1681. Eclectic in range, the text contained advice on a diverse array of subjects from the traditional curriculum, and incorporated additional exercises in husbandry, housekeeping, and legal matters. Mather intended that his manual should be read in tandem with the <span class="roman">Bible</span>, and emphasized, in his address to the reader, the importance of self-awareness in achieving purity in religion  (sig. A2<i>v</i>). Popular and respected, the text ran to twenty-four editions, and Mather's son Samuel, who died at the age of twenty-two, added verses and fourteen further chapters to the fourth edition in 1695.<br>
<br>Initially a conformist within the Church of England, about 1661 Mather with his wife became a Quaker, a shift of commitment and loyalty which dominated Mather's later works. In November 1657 he was imprisoned for thirty-two weeks for non-payment of tithes and, later, in 1683, after a prosecution in the ecclesiastical court, he was subjected to a second period of imprisonment on a writ <i>de excommunicato capiendo</i>  (Besse, 1.3, 11). By this time the Quaker population of Bedford was estimated at thirty  (ibid., 1.xxxviii), and Mather resorted to writing pamphlets as a means of vindicating his own position and attracting support. In 1694 his two texts, <span class="italic">An Instrument from that Little Stone Cut out of the Mountain without Hands</span> and <span class="italic">A Novelty, or, A Government of Women Distinct from Men</span>, were distributed in order to promote Mather's own mistrust of segregated meetings (which could ultimately result in &#145;Unscriptural Government&#146;), and to justify his personal patronage of Margaret Everard, who had preached of God's grace to a crowd gathered in his own house in June 1694.<br>
<br>In the following year Mather offered chronological discussions of Quakerism from its semantic origins to the core of its creed (<span class="italic">A Brief Character of the Antient Christian Quakers</span>), but a simultaneous sense of disillusionment can also be detected from this date. This culminated in published attacks advertising the flawed nature of scripture (<span class="italic">Of the Quakers Despising the Holy Scriptures</span>, 1700), and denouncing the efforts of &#145;Lifeless Preachers &hellip; who are Taught to preach neither by Grace nor Holy Scriptures&#146;  (W. Mather, <span class="italic">An Answer to the Switch for the Snake</span>, 1700, 9). In 1701 this breach became permanent, and Mather, careful throughout to reassure that he entertained no quarrels with individual Quakers, articulated his public dissatisfaction with their spirit:<blockquote>That the Substance and Summ of the Religion of the Quakers, turns upon one Single Hinge, viz That the Spirit by which they are moved, and inspired, is really the Holy Ghost, or the Universal Spirit of God &hellip; we have clear evidence, and can make it appear to all, who are not wilfully blind, that their Spirit is not the Holy Ghost, but a Spirit of Error. (Mather)</blockquote>Consonant again with the teachings of the English church, Mather sought to stress that his absence had been in part due to his desire for martyrdom and his love of habit and harmony  (pp. 1&#150;5). His final work, <span class="italic">A letter from a Quaker-preacher to a church-man <span class="roman">[Mather]</span> (who had been a Quaker forty years.) With the church-man's answer</span> was printed in 1708. It is not known when Mather died.<br>
