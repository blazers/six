<span class="headword">Stone,  Jean Mary</span>  (1854<span class="mult">x</span>6&#150;1908), <span class="occ">historian</span>, was born at Brighton and was educated at a Calvinist school in Paris and at Aschaffenburg in Germany, where she learned French, German, and Italian. While in Germany, she became a Roman Catholic, and was received into the church by Bishop Kettler of Mainz. On her return to England, her historical studies were encouraged by the Society of Jesus. In 1892 she published <span class="italic">Faithful unto Death</span>, a study of the Franciscan order in England in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, which owed much to the encouragement of Father Joseph Stevenson, the archivist and historian; it carried a preface by Father John Morris, the ecclesiastical historian. Although unexciting to read, it was a clear improvement on Anne Hope's 1878 study of the same subject. In 1898 she published a memoir of Eleanor Leslie, a nineteenth-century Roman Catholic convert who contributed to the Scottish Catholic revival.<br>
<br>Stone's most significant works, however, appeared after the turn of the century. In 1901 <span class="italic">The History of Mary I, Queen of England</span> was published. In it, Stone succeeded in producing the first full-length biography to revise the &#145;old traditional, but generally spurious portraits&#146; of the queen. She used a wide range of sources, including chronicles, recently published state papers, and the dispatches of foreign ambassadors. As her successors have enjoyed the same access to these papers as she did, her achievement has gone unrecognized. The biography was favourably reviewed in <span class="italic">The Athenaeum</span>, although the critic felt that &#145;the whole truth is not in this book&#146;  (<span class="italic">Athenaeum</span>, 9), and accused Stone of Catholic bias. It was followed in 1904 by <span class="italic">Reformation and Renaissance</span>, an ambitious &#145;account of the two great revolutionary movements of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries from the standpoint of the old religion&#146;. It synthesized a wide range of contemporary research by British and continental scholars, both protestant and Catholic, and anticipated recent scholarship on the Catholic reformation. Other works included <span class="italic">The Church in English History</span> (1907), a manual for teachers and older students, and <span class="italic">Studies from the Court and Cloister</span> (1908), a collection of papers on topics including the marriage of Anne of Cleves to Henry VIII and Foxe's book of martyrs, which had been previously published in the <span class="italic">Dublin Review</span>, the <span class="italic">Scottish Review</span>, and other periodicals.<br>
<br>Jean Mary Stone appears to have spent her last years in Sussex, some of them in the village of Storrington; she died unmarried at her home, 77 High Street, Battle, Sussex, on 3 May 1908.<br>
