<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Butler, Sir  Richard Harte Keatinge</span>  (1870&#150;1935), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was born on 28 August 1870, the son of Colonel E. R. Butler, of the Army Medical Service. Having been educated at Harrow School and the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, Butler was commissioned second lieutenant in the Dorsetshire regiment on 29 October 1890; he became lieutenant on 29 October 1892 and captain on 6 April 1897. On 5 June 1894 he married Helen Frances, second daughter of Major William Benjamin Battiscombe, Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders; they had a son and a daughter. Butler had become adjutant of the 2nd Dorsets in March 1896 and continued in that capacity until September 1900, taking part in the battalion's operations for the relief of Ladysmith. He distinguished himself, rescuing a wounded man from the Tugela River during the retreat from Spion Kop, and again when the battalion stormed Alleman's Nek in June 1900. After being transferred to a mounted infantry unit Butler was severely wounded at Fort Itala in September 1901. For his services he had received a brevet majority on 29 November 1900.<br>
<br>After passing from the Staff College, Camberley, in 1906 Butler was brigade major at Aldershot from April 1906 to April 1910, receiving his regimental majority in February 1910; he returned to Aldershot in November 1911 as general staff officer, grade 2. Having received a brevet lieutenant-colonelcy in May 1913, Butler was selected to command the 2nd Lancashire Fusiliers on 24 June 1914 but was retained at Aldershot until the end of the training season. As a result he joined his new command only in September 1914; but he distinguished himself sufficiently during the first battle of Ypres to be given command of the 3rd brigade in 1st division on 13 November 1914, with the temporary rank of brigadier-general. On 21 February 1915, just three days after receiving his brevet colonelcy, he was appointed brigadier-general, general staff, to succeed the mortally wounded John Gough as Douglas Haig's chief of staff in the first army. On 23 June 1915 he was given the rank of temporary major-general.<br>
<br>Haig had commanded at Aldershot immediately before the war and clearly had confidence in the qualities of vigour, resolution, and drive which made Butler successful in fighting commands with battalion and brigade. Consequently when Haig succeeded Sir John French as commander-in-chief in December 1915, he wanted to appoint Butler as his chief of staff. However, Butler was considered too junior for the post and on 22 December 1915 he was appointed deputy chief of staff at general headquarters (GHQ); he received substantive rank as major-general on 3 June 1916. Butler was to remain at GHQ until February 1918 but he was ill-suited to staff work. His energy made him apt to be impatient and he was not always very helpful with or sympathetic towards subordinates. Indeed he was generally considered excessively rude and, as a result, he only added to the general isolation of GHQ from the army. Nor did Butler have any real understanding of the requirements of a more technologically advanced mode of warfare and he was noticeably lukewarm towards the development of tanks. He would have gladly relinquished his post but Haig declined to release him for an active command, and it was only on 27 February 1918 that he was given the 3rd corps with the rank of temporary lieutenant-general.<br>
<br>The 3rd corps formed part of Hubert Gough's Fifth Army, which was targeted by the major German offensive in March 1918. Butler had a different conception to his neighbouring corps commander, Ivor Maxse, of the kind of defences that should be prepared, favouring holding the front line in strength rather than developing a defence in depth. However, 3rd corps was short of manpower and was forced back towards Noyon, Butler commanding the Amiens sector when the German offensive was finally checked in April. Butler's corps then took part in Haig's counter-attack on 8 August but Butler himself suffered a nervous collapse and was removed at the request of Henry Rawlinson, who had superseded Gough. Butler returned to his command in time for the operations against the Hindenburg line in September but Rawlinson had little confidence in him and he was transferred to the Douai region that same month.<br>
<br>Having been created CB in 1917, KCMG in 1918, and KCB in 1919, Butler commanded a division in the army of occupation from March to October 1919, then a division at Aldershot from November 1919 to February 1923. He was promoted lieutenant-general on 3 January 1923 and was general officer commanding, western command, from June 1924 to June 1928, before retiring on 1 January 1929. Butler died at his home, Roden Lodge, Shrewsbury, on 22 April 1935. He was survived by his wife.<br>
