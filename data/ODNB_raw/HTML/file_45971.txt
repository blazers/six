<span class="headword">Worsdell family</span>  (<em>per. </em><em>c.</em>1800&#150;1910), <span class="occ">coach and carriage builders and engineers</span>, originated with <a name="cosubject_45967"></a><span class="headword">Thomas Clarke Worsdell</span>  (1788&#150;1862)<span class="occ"></span>, born on 3 December 1788 at Hayes, near Bromley in Kent. He was the son of Thomas Clarke Worsdell (1748&#150;1826), a market gardener in Kent, later an innkeeper, then agent for the Hand in Hand insurance company, and his wife, Elizabeth Carter (<i>b</i>. 1750). About 1800 the family moved to London where Thomas Clarke senior found employment at a coaching inn. On leaving school young Thomas was apprenticed to coach builders Howe and Shanks of Little Queen Street, Long Acre, London. In 1807 he married Elizabeth Taylor (1784&#150;1863) in London, but other details of his early life are scarce. About 1812 he moved to north Lancashire where he continued to work as a coach builder. By 1816 he had joined the Society of Friends, and in time all five Worsdells became Friends, and this had a marked effect on their private and public lives. In 1827 Thomas was able to establish a coach building business with his son Nathaniel in Liverpool, which soon achieved a high reputation for the quality of its work. Through Quaker influence he was introduced to George Stephenson and with him planned the first carriages for the Liverpool and Manchester Railway (L&amp;MR). In 1828 Thomas became superintendent of coaching for the L&amp;MR, and at his Crown Street works he built large numbers of coaches, as well as tenders for the <i>Rocket</i> and other locomotives, and a variety of goods wagons. Stephenson called him &#145;the best coach builder I ever knew&#146;. In January 1837 he left England to take up the post of locomotive, carriage, and wagon superintendent on the Leipzig and Dresden Railway, returning about four years later as carriage inspector successively at Manchester, Euston, and Hull, where he was joined by his son George. He retired from railway work in 1847 and settled at Nantwich near Crewe, where he developed his lifelong interest in homoeopathic medicine, treating both people and animals with, it was said, considerable success. He died on 18 April 1862 at his home, 7 Welch Row in Nantwich, his wife surviving him by less than a year. They were both buried at the Friends' meeting-house, Nantwich.<br>
<br>Thomas's eldest son, <a name="cosubject_45968"></a><span class="headword">Nathaniel Worsdell</span>  (1809&#150;1886)<span class="occ"></span>, was born on 10 October 1809 in London. He attended school in Knutsford, Cheshire, to the age of thirteen, and was apprenticed to Jonathan Dunn, coach builder in Lancaster, in 1823. On 3 October 1833 he married Mary Wilson (1811&#150;1869) of Bentham near Lancaster, and Nathaniel remained at the Crown Street works when the rest of the family moved to Leipzig in 1837. The carriage of mail on the railways began at a very early date, and Nathaniel built some mail vans in 1838 which incorporated his own patented device for the automatic picking up and setting down of mailbags in transit. The Post Office was very interested but would not agree to his asking price (&pound;3500, subsequently reduced to &pound;1500) for the right to use his patent, and it soon introduced a device of its own which was a clear infringement. As a Quaker, however, Nathaniel would not pursue the matter in the courts and he never received any compensation from the Post Office. In 1843 he moved as carriage and wagon superintendent to the new Grand Junction Railway works at Crewe where he remained until he retired in 1880. He was involved in many of the charitable and educational activities of the growing railway community and also served as a Liberal on the local council. He died on 24 July 1886 at his home, Southlea, 8 Chetwynd Road, Oxton, Birkenhead, Cheshire, a much respected man, strict but just, and ever mindful of his employees' welfare. His wife, Mary, had predeceased him; both were buried at the Quaker burial-ground at Briggflats near Sedbergh in Yorkshire.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_45969"></a><span class="headword">George Worsdell</span>  (1821&#150;1912)<span class="occ"></span> was Thomas's youngest child, born on 21 May 1821 at Preston, Lancashire, and on leaving school near Blackburn he trained under his father at the Crown Street works before moving with him in 1837 to Leipzig. He returned to England the following year and by 1845 had decided to set up his own business manufacturing railway equipment. Within six years his Dallam Forge at Warrington in Lancashire had been awarded a gold medal at the Great Exhibition of 1851 &#145;for excellence of iron and of railway plant&#146;. In the same year, on 27 March, he married Jane (1820/21&#150;1903), the youngest daughter of Edward Bolton, a prominent local Quaker. Within a few years, however, both he and the Dallam Forge suffered serious setbacks: his health broke down in 1857 when the business failed and he was declared bankrupt, but he made a good recovery until forced again by ill health to retire in 1872 at the age of fifty-one. Relieved of stress, he lived to the age of ninety-one, and died on 1 December 1912 at his home, 70 Brookfield Terrace, Lancaster. Under new management from 1865 the Dallam Forge again prospered, and eventually it became in 1930 part of the Lancashire Steel Company, remaining in production until July 1980.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_45970"></a><span class="headword">(Thomas) William Worsdell</span>  (1838&#150;1916)<span class="occ"></span>, Nathaniel's eldest son, was born on 14 January 1838 at 17 Laurel Street, Liverpool. He attended Quaker schools in Yorkshire and Hampshire, then about 1855 went as an apprentice to the Birmingham engineering works of his uncle Thomas Worsdell (1818&#150;1893), another of Thomas Clarke's sons. He became manager of the works in 1861 but fell out with his uncle and emigrated to the United States soon after his marriage, on 29 June 1865, to Mary Ann Batt (1844&#150;1918) at Yealand Conyers in Lancashire. He worked on the Pennsylvania railroad until 1871 when he returned to England as works manager under Francis William Webb at the London and North Western Railway's (L&amp;NWR) Crewe works. After ten years in that post he was appointed locomotive superintendent of the Great Eastern Railway, leaving after four years for the same position, at twice the salary, with the larger and more prosperous North Eastern Railway (NER) at Gateshead. A strong advocate of compound cylinder locomotives, six of the fifteen classes he designed for the NER were of this type. Like all the Quaker Worsdells he was held in awe by his workforce but in spite of his imposing physique he did not enjoy good health and he resigned in 1890, to be succeeded by his brother Wilson. He joined the Institution of Mechanical Engineers in 1864, serving as a member of council in 1886&#150;92. He had built a house, Stonycroft, at Arnside in Westmorland, as a holiday home and lived there during a very active retirement until his death there on 28 June 1916. His wife survived him by two years and they were both buried at the Friends' meeting-house in Yealand Conyers.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_45971"></a><span class="headword">Wilson Worsdell</span>  (1850&#150;1920)<span class="occ"></span>, the second youngest of Nathaniel's sons, was born on 7 September 1850 at Monks Coppenhall, near Crewe. He attended the Friends' school at Ackworth from 1860 to 1866, and the following year joined his brother William in the Pennsylvania Railway's workshops at Altoona. They both returned to Crewe in 1871, and Wilson worked with the L&amp;NWR there and later at Chester, where he was in charge of the locomotive sheds from 1877. On 1 June 1882 he married Mary Elizabeth (1856&#150;1945), daughter of George Bradford, a linen draper, at St John's Church, Hanley, Staffordshire. In 1883 he moved to the NER at Gateshead as assistant mechanical engineer, finding himself again under his elder brother when William was appointed locomotive superintendent in 1885. William's early retirement in 1890 allowed Wilson to step into his shoes much earlier than he could have anticipated, and for the next twenty years he was in charge of locomotive building for the NER at Gateshead and Darlington. During that time he produced more than twenty different types of steam locomotive, and rebuilt some of those designed by his brother William to improve their performance. The brothers' engines played a notable part in the celebrated railway races to Edinburgh and Aberdeen in the 1880s and 1890s, sustaining average speeds hardly bettered by steam locomotives since. Wilson was also responsible in 1903&#150;4 for the north Tyneside third rail suburban electrification scheme, one of the first in Britain. He served as a member of council of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers and as a JP. He took a keen interest in the welfare of his staff and workers, and was both liked and respected by all. He retired at the end of May 1910 and died suddenly on 13 April 1920 at his home, The Glebe, South Ascot, Sunninghill, Berkshire. He was buried at All Souls' churchyard, South Ascot.<br>
