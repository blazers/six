<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Jay,  Douglas Patrick Thomas</span>, Baron Jay  (1907&#150;1996), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born at the Tower House, Plum Lane, Woolwich, London, on 23 March 1907, the son of Edward Aubrey Hastings Jay, barrister, and his wife, Isobel Violet, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Craigie. His father represented Woolwich on the London county council as a Municipal Reformer (conservative), and was chairman of the education committee. He was educated at Winchester College and was a scholar of New College, Oxford, where he obtained first-class honours in <i>literae humaniores</i> in 1929. He was a fellow of All Souls College, Oxford, from 1930 to 1937 and from 1968 until his death. On 30 September 1933 he married <a href="#cosubject_99956">Margaret Christian (Peggy) Garnett [<i>see below</i>]</a>, his neighbour in Well Walk, Hampstead, and a student at Somerville College, Oxford; they had two sons and two daughters. The marriage was dissolved in 1972, in which year he married Mary Lavinia, daughter of Hugh Lewis Thomas.<br>
<br>After leaving Oxford Jay worked as a journalist successively on <span class="italic">The Times</span>, <span class="italic">The Economist</span>, and the <span class="italic">Daily Herald</span>, where he was City editor from 1937 to 1940. In the 1930s he was active, together with Hugh Dalton, Hugh Gaitskell, and Evan Durbin, in developing policies for the next Labour government. During the Second World War he was a temporary civil servant at the Ministry of Supply (1940&#150;43) and the Board of Trade (1943&#150;5). On the election of the Labour government in July 1945, he became personal assistant to the prime minister, Clement Attlee. He was elected MP for Battersea North in July 1946 and held the seat until his retirement from the House of Commons at the 1983 general election. He was economic secretary to the Treasury from 1947 to 1950 and financial secretary to the Treasury from 1950 to 1951. He was sworn of the privy council in 1951. He entered the cabinet as president of the Board of Trade in 1964, and held the post until 1967. A politician of unquestionable integrity, and of the highest intellectual calibre, though lacking in personal charisma, Jay was significant in the history of the Labour Party for three reasons. The first was his attempt to reconcile socialism with Keynesianism. Second, he exercised considerable influence on his close friend and fellow Wykehamist Hugh Gaitskell, chancellor of the exchequer from 1950 to 1951 and leader of the Labour Party from 1955 to 1963. Third, he was probably the most consistent socialist opponent of British participation in any form of European economic integration involving supranational institutions.<br>
<br>The high unemployment of the 1920s and 1930s was socialism's best recruiting sergeant. Keynes's <span class="italic">General Theory</span> (1936) was a threat to the Labour Party because it purported to demonstrate that full employment could be realized by managing capitalism, and without recourse to socialism. Some socialists, such as G. D. H. Cole and Aneurin Bevan, doubted that Keynes's demonstration was foolproof. Others, such as Evan Durbin, questioned whether Keynes's ideas could be implemented without serious inflationary side-effects. Jay, in his book <span class="italic">The Socialist Case</span>, first published in 1937, accepted Keynes's argument that full employment could be achieved by managing &#145;total effective demand&#146;. He therefore emphasized equality as the principal argument for socialism. &#145;In most modern societies one of the chief reasons why the poor are very poor is that the rich are very rich &hellip; poverty cannot be removed without some mitigation of inequality&#146;  (D. Jay, <span class="italic">The Socialist Case</span>, 1947, 3). While supporting the need for the nationalization of coal and the major utilities, he thought that socialists were in error in their obsession with nationalization:<blockquote>Socialists have been mistaken in making ownership of the means of production instead of ownership of inherited property the test of socialization. &hellip; It is not the ownership of the means of production as such, but ownership of large inherited incomes, which ought to be eliminated. (ibid., 195)</blockquote>Unlike most other contemporary socialists, he valued the activity of the individual entrepreneur. &#145;Great entrepreneurs &hellip; are of a value so great that it would be impossible to overpay them&#146;  (ibid., 116). Later Jay came to accept that he had underestimated the inflationary consequences of demand management. But in his rejection of nationalization as the core of socialism, he anticipated later socialist revisionists.<br>
<br>There were three young economists in the Attlee government who acquired great influence owing mainly to the declining health of Sir Stafford Cripps, who, in November 1947, had succeeded Dalton as chancellor of the exchequer. The three were Harold Wilson, Hugh Gaitskell, and Douglas Jay. They regarded full employment as the principal achievement of the Labour government but were sensitive to the threat constituted by the dollar shortage, by the liberalization of trade under American pressure, and by the 1948 American recession. Jay, together with Gaitskell, played a leading role in persuading the Attlee government, including a reluctant chancellor, to devalue sterling in September 1949. They had concluded that the UK's lack of competitiveness could prejudice full employment and that economic planning could not operate sufficiently rapidly to prevent it. Wilson, they both thought, played an equivocal role in pressing the case for devaluation, and this was one source of the distrust subsequently manifested towards Wilson by both Jay and Gaitskell. Gaitskell and Jay also attempted to devise a system of international economic relations that would defend full employment in Britain against the impact of external events. There would be two worlds, one based on the sterling area (which could for this purpose include western Europe) and the other based on the dollar area. The use of gold and dollars would be permitted only in relations with the dollar area. Unfortunately for their scheme, western Europe exhibited a higher tolerance of unemployment than was considered politically acceptable in the UK. The deflationary policies pursued by western European countries resulted in surpluses in their trade with the UK, which they wished discharged in gold and dollars, of which Britain was desperately short. This refusal to co-operate with Jay's plan was a source of his deep and lifelong hostility to economic integration with western Europe. Jay believed that, to guarantee full employment, the UK must retain control of its own economic destiny, including the right to limit the import of manufactured goods whenever the balance of payments required it.<br>
<br>On 2 June 1950 Jay represented the chancellor, Stafford Cripps, who was on holiday, at the cabinet meeting that finally decided to reject British participation in the Schuman plan for the creation of a European Coal and Steel Community. The previous day an ultimatum had been received from Paris demanding to know by the evening of 2 June whether or not the British would join the negotiations to establish the community. Jay's resentment at French impertinence emerges in his autobiography, published thirty years later:<blockquote>The ultimatum is not explicable except on the assumption that the French were determined to keep future moves for so-called &#145;European Unity&#146; under French control, and exclude the British at least until such time as the whole arrangement had been so devised as to promote French interests and where possible to damage this country. (Jay, 200)</blockquote>The French ultimatum followed two weeks of telegraphic exchanges during which they had attempted to persuade the British to take part and during which no British minister had thought it worthwhile to cross the channel to determine whether British anxieties could be assuaged. But, for Jay, the French objective had been to damage Britain. Jay's antipathy to European economic integration never softened. He was an influence in determining Gaitskell's opposition to Macmillan's 1961 application to join the EEC on the terms that appeared to be emerging. As president of the Board of Trade, he opposed the 1967 decision of the Wilson government to apply for membership. Wilson removed him from office, ostensibly on the grounds of age but probably even more because of his implacable opposition to the British application. Three months later General de Gaulle delivered his second &#145;Non&#146;. Jay had served three leaders of the Labour Party, Attlee, Gaitskell, and Wilson. For the first two he had nothing but admiration, for the third little but contempt. Thereafter, whether during the governments of Heath or of Wilson, Jay remained adamantly in the forefront of the opponents of British membership of the EEC; he was chairman of the Common Market Safeguards Campaign from 1970 to 1977. In his view the argument against membership had been reinforced by the community's adoption of the common agricultural policy, because it would cut Britain off from cheap sources of food, including from the Commonwealth, and thus make British manufacture less competitive.<br>
<br>Jay was one of the intellectual leaders of Labour's right wing. After Labour's defeat at the 1959 general election, he bravely, or perhaps insensitively, speculated publicly about the desirability of changing the party's name in order to transform its proletarian image. He thereby incurred deep left-wing hostility. It was one idea which did not command Gaitskell's assent, though Gaitskell was suspected of encouraging Jay to fly the kite. One effect of Jay's inflexible rejection of the EEC was to divide, and weaken, the right of the Labour Party. When, in 1981, many &#145;European&#146; Gaitskellites defected from the Labour Party to form the Social Democratic Party, Jay was not one of them: his own concerns about the direction of Labour Party policy in the early 1980s were submerged by the principal passion of his political life, to keep Britain free of European entanglements.<br>
<br>Jay was created a life peer in 1987. He died in Minster Lovell, Oxfordshire, where he lived, on 6 March 1996 and was buried in the churchyard there. He was survived by both wives.<br>
<br>Jay's first wife, <a name="cosubject_99956"></a><span class="headword">Margaret Christian <span class="st"> [Peggy]</span> Jay <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Garnett]</span></span>  (1913&#150;2008), <span class="occ">local government politician</span>, was born on 28 January 1913 at 2 Anson Road, Rusholme, Manchester, the eldest of three daughters of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/33333/', "(James Clerk) Maxwell Garnett (1880&#150;1958)")</script>, principal of the Municipal School of Technology, Manchester, later general secretary of the League of Nations Union, and his wife, Margaret Lucy, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Poulton (1887&#150;1965). When she was seven her parents moved to Hampstead, where she would live for the rest of her life. She was educated at Malvern Girls' College, St Paul's Girls' School, and Somerville College, Oxford, where she took a diploma in economics in 1933, before marrying Douglas Jay, who had tutored her for her Oxford entrance examinations. She married him despite his warning her that he regarded monogamy as a sin. She shared his political commitment, and served as a Labour member of London county council (LCC) for Hackney from 1938 to 1949, and then for Battersea from 1952 to 1964, continuing as a member of the Greater London council until 1967. She chaired the schools and arts and leisure committees, and was noted for her advocacy for the poor and marginalized. She and Audrey Callaghan formed a particularly effective partnership on the LCC children's committee. Among the causes she was associated with were the alleviation of homelessness, the welfare of children in homes and in hospitals, the provision of play facilities, and the rights of patients in psychiatric hospitals. She was devoted to Hampstead, and from 1968 to 1989 served as a singularly successful chairman of the Heath and Old Hampstead Society, campaigning against transport planners' and property developers' designs on Hampstead Heath, estate agents' signs in Old Hampstead, the encroachment of supermarket and fast food chains, and lap dancing clubs. She was dubbed &#145;the uncrowned Queen of Hampstead&#146; by the local paper  (<span class="italic">Camden New Journal</span>, 30 Jan 2003). She enjoyed passing on her campaigning skills to younger generations, and her position as matriarch of a talented and ever-expanding family. More pro-European than her former husband, she joined the Social Democratic Party in 1983, but rejoined the Labour Party when Gordon Brown became prime minister in 2007. She died in Hampstead on 21 January 2008, and was survived by her four children with Douglas Jay: Peter (<i>b</i>. 1937), an economist, diplomat, and broadcaster, Martin (<i>b</i>. 1939), a yacht designer, and Catherine and Helen (<i>b</i>. 1945), the celebrated &#145;Jay twins&#146; of the swinging sixties.<br>
