<span class="headword">Trevor,  John</span>  (1855&#150;1930), <span class="occ">founder of the Labour church</span>, was born on 7 October 1855 in Liverpool, the younger child and only son of Frederick Francis Trevor, linen draper, and his wife, Harriet, the daughter of John Cripps of Wisbech, a small grocer and linen draper. By the age of nine, he was an orphan; Trevor and his sister were brought up in Wisbech by their maternal grandmother, though eventually his sister went to live with her recently widowed paternal grandmother.<br>
<br>Trevor's grandparents were kindly, but the idiosyncratic and severe Baptist sect to which they belonged left a permanent scar on his mind. After a dame-school and a fly-by-night boarding-school, he entered a second boarding-school that was physically rigorous and educationally sufficient to allow him to pass the Cambridge local examination. In 1870 he was articled for five years to a Norwich architect. After an interlude in Liverpool and a return to Norwich he suffered a physical collapse and eventually a loss of faith, though not of religious impulse.<br>
<br>In 1877 Trevor travelled to Australia. He returned the next year by way of the United States, determined to be a minister, probably among the Unitarians, though he knew little about them. He had introductions to Brooke Herford and Robert Collyer (1823&#150;1912), English Unitarian ministers in Chicago, and they directed him to Meadville Seminary in western Pennsylvania, where he spent a year. In 1879 he returned to England. After a spell at Manchester New College, London, and some experience of preaching, he began practice as an architect in Folkestone. On 28 July 1881 he married his first cousin Eliza, daughter of Franklin Stanley Cripps, a Wisbech shopkeeper; they had four sons, two surviving to adulthood. The Folkestone experiment having failed, in 1884 they moved to Ballingdon, Essex, where he tried but failed to write a novel, and in 1887 they settled in London, where he undertook another year-long course at Manchester New College.<br>
<br>In 1888 Trevor became assistant minister to Philip Henry Wicksteed at the chapel in Little Portland Street. London gave him opportunities to study social problems (which also deeply engaged Wicksteed), and he began to see a relationship between politics and religion. In June 1890 he moved to Manchester to become minister at the fashionable chapel in Upper Brook Street. In April 1891, at a Unitarian conference in London, he heard Ben Tillett (1860&#150;1943) deliver a harsh attack on the alienation of existing churches from the working man. Taking up the challenge, which echoed his own growing feeling about the Unitarians and his sympathy with the Salvation Army, he determined to found a labour church. The initial meeting was held on 4 October 1891 at Chorlton town hall. The initiative was sternly criticized in the Unitarian press, and the difficulty of his position at Upper Brook Street as his commitment to socialism became apparent led to his resignation in the same year.<br>
<br>In 1892 Trevor founded a monthly publication, <span class="italic">Labour Prophet</span>, and began a series of tracts. In 1893 he became chairman of the Labour Church Union, and the movement spread with remarkable rapidity from Lancashire and Yorkshire to the midlands and south Wales and into Scotland, drawing primarily on upper levels of working men (and some women), with some representation from the lower middle class. There was considerable variation in practice from congregation to congregation: some had readings from secular sources and hymns; a few were licensed for marriages and there were even baptisms. But Trevor was unsuited to exert strong leadership, particularly as his life was darkened by illness and personal tragedy. By the end of the century the movement was in sharp decline.<br>
<br>The loss of a second son in June 1894 was followed by the death of Trevor's wife; in 1895 he married Annie Jones Higham (<i>d</i>. 1919), with whom he had two daughters. In 1897 he moved to a farm in Horsted Keynes, Sussex, where from 1899 to 1902 he encouraged young Labour church members to visit him for informal religious training in his &#145;school of natural religion&#146;. This project met with little success, and he soon severed his formal ties with the church. In 1902 he lived briefly in Clerkenwell, London, where he tried to establish the Labour Church Settlement as a centre of intellectual and cultural life for what remained of the movement.<br>
<br>In 1909 Trevor moved to Hampstead, working for several years as a professional photographer. In the same year he published a pamphlet, <span class="italic">The One Life</span>, which revealed his intense interest in questions of sexuality and his idea of forming an independent group modelled on the Oneida community, which he had visited on his American journey.<br>
<br>He never finally severed links with the Unitarians, serving as a supply minister at Newbury in the early 1920s, but he became a lonely and isolated figure, increasingly disillusioned with all churches and convinced that God was working outside such institutions. Trevor died in London on 7 January 1930 and was buried in Highgate cemetery.<br>
