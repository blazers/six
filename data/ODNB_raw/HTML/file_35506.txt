<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Philipps, Sir  Ivor</span>  (1861&#150;1940), <span class="occ">army officer and businessman</span>, was born on 9 September 1861 at the vicarage in Warminster, the second of six sons of James Erasmus Philipps, twelfth baronet (1824&#150;1912), vicar of Warminster, and his wife, Mary Margaret (<i>d</i>. 1913), eldest daughter of Samuel Best, rector of Abbots Ann, Hampshire. The Philippses had long been one of the great landowning families of west Wales, with an ancestral seat at Picton Castle in Pembrokeshire. James Philipps had inherited a baronetcy created in 1621; the estates passed to another branch of the family early in the nineteenth century. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35507/', "John W. Philipps, first Viscount St Davids")</script>, was Ivor's elder brother.<br>
<br>Ivor Philipps was educated at Felsted School from 1873 to 1876. He served in the Wiltshire militia from 1881 until 1883 when he was commissioned into the Manchester regiment, then serving in India. He qualified for the Bengal staff corps of the Indian army in 1884 and two years later joined the 1st battalion, the 5th Gurkha regiment, based at Abbottabad in the Punjab. He remained with the regiment for the rest of his time in India, with temporary detachments to other units. He was promoted captain in 1894 and major in 1901. He was attached to the Burma military police in the years immediately following the absorption of Burma into India in 1886 and subsequently saw active service in many campaigns against Afridi and Orakzais tribesmen on the north-west frontier of India&#151;notably at Miranzai (1891), Chitral (1895), and Tirah (1897). He was appointed to the staff of the commander-in-chief, India, in 1900 and was awarded the DSO later that year. After retiring from the regular army in 1903 he joined the Pembroke yeomanry, which he commanded from 1908 to 1912, and made a career in the City. On 9 September 1891 he had married Marian Isobel, daughter of James Buchanan Mirrlees, of Redlands, Glasgow. They had one daughter.<br>
<br>Philipps became Liberal MP for Southampton in 1906 and held the seat until 1922. On the outbreak of war in 1914 he was called to the War Office for staff duties and in November of that year he was given command of the 115th brigade with the temporary rank of brigadier-general. Within two months he was given further promotion to temporary major-general in command of the newly formed 38th Welsh division, part of Lloyd George's grandiose scheme to raise a Welsh army corps. The promotion owed much to Lloyd George, and was dependent upon Lloyd George's younger son becoming Philipps's aide-de-camp. &#145;I have seen Ivor Philipps and confirmed Gwilym's appointment with him if P. gets the generalship of the division&#146;, Lloyd George wrote to his wife. &#145;Have seen K[itchener] about that now and think it will be all right&#146;  (Morgan, 175). Philipps took the division to France in December 1915, in the meantime briefly holding the post of joint parliamentary secretary in the Ministry of Munitions.<br>
<br>On 7 July 1916, at the battle of the Somme, the 38th Welsh division, together with the 17th division under Major-General Pilcher, attacked Mametz Wood. The attack failed and higher command blamed Pilcher and Philipps, perhaps unfairly as the ill-fated plan was not of their making. Both were removed from their posts. On 12 July the Welsh division, under another commander, captured the wood. Lloyd George put his own gloss on the dismissal: &#145;Unfortunately&#146;, he wrote, &#145;the general has broken down in health and returned home&#146;  (W. George, 255). Philipps's reputation was not harmed and in 1917 he was appointed KCB for &#145;services during the war&#146;  (<span class="italic">London Gazette</span>, 1917, 5456).<br>
<br>Philipps continued his business activities and chaired many substantial companies including Ilford, the photographic manufacturers, Schweppes, makers of soft drinks, several rubber plantation companies, and investment and insurance businesses. He was also a director of several other companies. He played a prominent part in public life in Pembrokeshire and carried out restoration work at Pembroke Castle, for which he was given the freedom of the city of Pembroke. His country home was Cosheston Hall, Pembroke, and his London residence was 1 Lygon Place. Sir Ivor Philipps died of heart failure in the Empire Nursing Home, Vincent Square, Westminster, on 15 August 1940, survived by his wife and daughter.<br>
