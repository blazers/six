<span class="headword">Cavendish,  Louise Frederica Augusta</span>, duchess of Devonshire <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Countess Louise Friederike Auguste  von Alten; <em>other married name </em>Louise Frederica Augusta Montagu, duchess of Manchester]</span>  (1832&#150;1911), <span class="occ">society figure</span>, was born on 15 January 1832, the second of the three daughters of Karl Franz Victor, Count von Alten, of Hanover, and his wife, Hermine de Schminke. On 22 July 1852 she married, in the palace chapel at Hanover, and subsequently at the British embassy, William Drogo Montagu (1823&#150;1890), then Viscount Mandeville. They had two sons and three daughters.<br>
<br>Lady Mandeville, accounted one of the great beauties of the period, rapidly acquired a position of social pre-eminence and attracted admirers from across the political spectrum. Lord Granville wrote to her that &#145;you are irresistible for man, woman, and I should think beast. I can conceive, if it was not for your grande dame much-too-big-for-any-street-to-hold-me-look, being passionately in love with you&#146;  (Kennedy, 24). Duchess of Manchester from 1855, she served as mistress of the robes to Queen Victoria under Derby's ministry of 1858&#150;9. Victoria, who had initially been pleased to have a German in her household, rapidly came to disapprove of the duchess, and urged the princess of Wales to drop the acquaintance, as she had &#145;done more harm to Society from her <i>tone</i>, her love of admiration and &#147;fast&#148; style, than almost anyone&#146;  (Magnus, 110). The duchess, however, remained one of the principal members of the Marlborough House set, sharing with the prince of Wales a passion for gambling and racing, and a willingness to overlook discreet infidelity.<br>
<br>Her liaison with <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32331/', "Spencer Compton Cavendish, marquess of Hartington (1833&#150;1908)")</script>, began in the early 1860s, when she reclaimed him from the embraces of the courtesan Catherine (&#145;Skittles&#146;) Walters, and lasted until their marriage some thirty years later. The relationship was well-known in aristocratic society, but never drew public attention. The duchess was a convinced tory, though she cultivated politicians of differing opinions, including Lord Clarendon and Sir Charles Dilke, for the information they could provide. She devoted herself to inspiring political ambition in her notoriously indolent lover, and to fulfilling her own ambition of seeing him prime minister. Liberals regarded her with suspicion and Gladstone saw her influence as a barrier to Hartington's acceptance of his radical proposals. Of her intelligence, opinions differed: Dilke thought her lacking the &#145;clearness of head&#146; necessary to make her useful to Hartington, but Baron von Eckardstein regarded her as &#145;one of the cleverest and most capable women that I ever met&#146;  (Eckardstein, 123).<br>
<br>Manchester died in 1890, and, with no show of unseemly haste, on 16 August 1892 she married Hartington, who had become the eighth duke of Devonshire in the previous year. Widely referred to as &#145;the Double Duchess&#146;, she was one of the dominant figures of London society: awesome and formidable, she was admired and respected more than she was liked. Her entertainments at Chatsworth, at Devonshire House, and at the racecourses were lavish and spectacular, particularly the fancy-dress ball which was her contribution to the diamond jubilee celebrations of 1897. A passion for bridge in her later years earned her the unkind sobriquet &#145;Ponte Vecchio&#146;, though it is unlikely that anyone would have used it in her presence. Devonshire died in 1908; three years later Louise Devonshire had a seizure at the Sandown racecourse, and died the following day, 15 July 1911, at Sir Edgar Vincent's house, Esher Place, Esher, Surrey. She was buried on 18 July at Edensor, Derbyshire.<br>
