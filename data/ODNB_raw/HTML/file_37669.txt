<span class="headword">Leverson <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Moses]</span>,  Ada Esther</span>  (1862&#150;1933), <span class="occ">novelist</span>, was born in London on 10 October 1862, the eldest child in the family of four daughters and four sons of Samuel Henry Moses, later Beddington, a wool merchant resident in Hyde Park Square, London, and his wife, Zillah, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25576/', "Sir John Simon")</script>, Liberal MP. Her mother was an outstanding amateur pianist. Educated at home, Ada became well read in English, French, and German literature and the classics. On 6 December 1881 she married Ernest David Leverson, formerly Montague David Leverson (1852&#150;1921), son of George Bazett Colvin Leverson, a diamond merchant. Her parents had opposed the match; Leverson was ten years her senior and it later transpired that his young &#145;ward&#146;, being educated in France, was in fact his illegitimate daughter. The Leversons had a son, who survived only twenty-one weeks, and a daughter, Violet, later Violet Wyndham.<br>
<br>From 1892 Ada Leverson published numerous stories and sketches in <span class="italic">Punch</span> and other magazines. Her Kensington home became a meeting-place for writers and artists, particularly those associated with the <span class="italic">Yellow Book</span>. Her friends included Aubrey Beardsley, H. Max Beerbohm, George Moore, and, most notably, Oscar Wilde. It was Wilde who christened her the Sphinx, the name by which she was thereafter known to her friends. When the Wilde scandal broke in 1895, Ada Leverson stood out against public opinion and took him into her home when he was released on bail, an act of courage and loyalty for which she has become justly renowned. She was one of the few people who rose early in the morning to greet him on his release from prison in 1897.<br>
<br>About 1902 the Leversons lost money through an unsound investment. Never happy together, they now agreed to separate, Ernest emigrating to Canada and Ada remaining in London. The publisher Grant Richards encouraged her to turn to novel writing, and between 1907 and 1916 she produced six books: <span class="italic">The Twelfth Hour</span> (1907), <span class="italic">Love's Shadow</span> (1908), <span class="italic">The Limit</span> (1911), <span class="italic">Tenterhooks</span> (1912), <span class="italic">Bird of Paradise</span> (1914), and <span class="italic">Love at Second Sight</span> (1916). These lightly plotted love stories represent the perfect expression of her personality: frivolous and witty, but with an underlying sense of melancholy. They are also important for their closely detailed depictions of the fashions and tastes of the Edwardian age&#151;a picture made all the more vivid by Leverson's tendency towards playful exaggeration and the novels' inclusions of vignettes of eccentric personalities.<br>
<br>Ill health and the onset of deafness did little to diminish Ada Leverson's enjoyment of life. Shortly after the First World War she met F. Osbert Sitwell, Sacheverell Sitwell, and Edith Sitwell, who became close friends. During the 1920s she frequently stayed in Florence, where she befriended Harold Acton and Ronald Firbank. Though viewed by many as a relic of the 1890s, she never lost her enthusiasm for new artistic trends.<br>
<br>Ada Leverson was small but of striking appearance, with bright golden hair and a profile said to resemble that of Sarah Bernhardt. She was famous for her witty, outrageous remarks, which she delivered in a low, purring voice. When she heard, for instance, that Alfred Douglas's elder brother had produced a male heir, she is said to have remarked: &#145;For once I think Bosie would have preferred a girl&#146;  (<span class="italic">TLS</span>, 8 Oct 1993, 31). Her outwardly cynical manner concealed a warm heart, and she was devoted to those she loved. That her novels are not better known is due largely to her extreme modesty about her literary abilities; but there is no doubt that her concise, deceptively light prose style, reliance on dialogue to carry the plot, and delight in satirical exaggeration influenced both Firbank and Evelyn Waugh, and that she has thus left her mark on the development of the twentieth-century novel.<br>
<br>Ada Leverson died at her home, 8 Clarges Street, Mayfair, London, on 30 August 1933, having published her last book, <span class="italic">Letters to the Sphinx from Oscar Wilde, with Reminiscences of the Author</span>, in 1930.<br>
