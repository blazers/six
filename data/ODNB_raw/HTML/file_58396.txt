<span class="headword">Craik,  Kenneth James William</span>  (1914&#150;1945), <span class="occ">psychologist</span>, was born on 29 March 1914 at 10 Trinity Road, Leith, Scotland, the son of James Bowstead Craik, writer to the signet, and his wife, Marie Sylvia, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Robson. Having studied psychology under James Drever sen. (and philosophy under Norman Kemp-Smith) at the University of Edinburgh, Craik moved to St John's College, Cambridge, and joined Frederic Bartlett's Cambridge Psychological Laboratory (Drever having warned Bartlett: &#145;Next term I am going to send you a genius&#146;). Craik rapidly turned to research on hearing and perception, gaining a reputation for technical prowess in designing and making equipment as well as for intellectual liveliness and breadth of interest. After obtaining his PhD, with a thesis on visual adaptation (1940), he became a fellow of St John's (1941). With the onset of the Second World War the laboratory's work soon became oriented towards topics of military significance, particularly flying. Craik produced a steady stream of papers on such topics as visibility through fighter windscreens, instrument lighting, and differentiating muscular from mental fatigue, many involving an experimental cockpit he had designed. Most appeared as reports for the various official armed services committees on which he sat. Against this background of tackling practical problems of engineering and physiology Craik produced his only book, <span class="italic">The Nature of Explanation</span> (1943), a short but remarkably prescient work. After a brief, perspicuous, critique of traditional philosophical positions and an account of the modes of explanation emerging in such contemporary scientific developments as quantum physics, he turned to psychological explanation, and asked, &#145;What structure and process are required in a mechanical system to enable it to imitate correctly and to predict external processes or create new things?&#146; At this point calculating machines came to the fore as centrally important models for psychological processes and Craik proceeded, speculatively, to explore their possible bearing on perception. &#145;[T]he nervous system is viewed as a calculating machine capable of modelling or paralleling external events.&#146; Craik rejected the symbolic logic and abstraction of contemporary logical positivism, viewing logical positivism's formal exercises as the last trace of a doomed <i>a priorism</i> &#145;fated to yield to an experimental approach&#146;. Craik thus helped to initiate the information processing approach which was later to revolutionize post-war American psychology as &#145;cognitive psychology&#146;. The posthumously published two-part paper &#145;Theory of the human operator in control systems&#146;  (<span class="italic">British Journal of Psychology</span>, 1948) developed his ideas further in relation to the new communication and control theory (renamed &#145;cybernetics&#146; by Norbert Weiner in that year).<br>
<br>These two works aside, Craik's mature work remained largely inaccessible, much being officially restricted or for internal circulation in the applied psychology unit (of which he became the first director in 1944). Craik died in Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge, on 7 May 1945 after being involved in an accident while cycling.<br>
<br>While Craik's reputation was maintained by his close colleagues, there was little visible basis for it available to outsiders. This was rectified in 1966 with the publication of <span class="italic">The Nature of Psychology</span>, an edited selection of unpublished papers, essays, and other writings (including the first description of what was later called the Craik&#150;O'Brien&#150;Cornsweet illusion). Evidence for the long-rumoured breadth and originality of Craik's interests and thought was at last available. Besides psychological theory and experimental work it included a variety of philosophical essays and pieces&#151;some but fragments&#151;on topics such as claustrophobia, Marxism, and science, and &#145;War as a part of life&#146;, plus a full, 80-item bibliography which included his wartime research. The tantalizing glimpses of Craik's unrealized potential contained in this volume reproduced on a wider scale the sense of loss which his Cambridge colleagues had always felt. In 1976 the Kenneth Craik Laboratory, Cambridge, was named in his honour.<br>
