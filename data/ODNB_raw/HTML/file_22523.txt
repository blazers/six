<span class="headword">Poole,  Thomas</span>  (1766&#150;1837), <span class="occ">tanner and friend of Samuel Taylor Coleridge</span>, was born on 14 November 1766 in Nether Stowey, Somerset, and baptized there on 12 December, the second child of Thomas Poole (<i>d</i>. 1795) and Elizabeth Buller (<i>d</i>. 1801). Of six children born to his parents, only Tom Poole, his eldest sister Sarah (later the wife of Thomas King, a Bristol merchant), and his brother Richard survived to adult life. Tom Poole's father, a prosperous tanner and farmer, was one of four able brothers whose family had long been established in the area of Nether Stowey. He discouraged his son's intellectual ambitions and denied him the education that he longed for. Instead, Tom Poole was set to work at an early age as his father's apprentice, expressing his resentment by &#145;ostentatious inattention&#146; to the work of the tanyard  (Mrs H. Sandford, 1.9). As a young man he studied for four or five hours a day and became proficient in Latin and French. His strength of character and practical ability also ensured that, despite his early distaste for tanning, he was soon greatly respected in his trade.<br>
<br>In 1791 Poole was sent as a west country delegate to a meeting of tanners in London and by them was elected to speak to William Pitt concerning the distressed state of the tanning industry. Poole's London visit was important in shaping his radical sympathies, and on his return to Nether Stowey after an absence of several weeks his family were alarmed to find him filled with enthusiasm for the French Revolution. By 1794 the government was said to consider him &#145;the most dangerous person in the county of Somerset&#146;  (Mrs H. Sandford, 1.92). In reality, though he welcomed the &#145;glowing spirit of liberty&#146;  (ibid., 40) which the revolution seemed to represent, he was never an extreme political radical and deplored the execution of Louis XVI.<br>
<br>Coleridge's first meeting with Tom Poole took place at Poole's house in Castle Street, Nether Stowey, on 18 August 1794. Coleridge, on a walking tour in Somerset with Robert Southey, was introduced by Poole's kinsman, Henry Poole of Stogursey. Coleridge's chief theme on this occasion was Pantisocracy, the plan he had developed with Southey for founding an ideal community in America. Although Poole had recently considered emigration himself, he was not persuaded by Pantisocracy. The two men nevertheless quickly established a deep and trusting friendship which was to be formative for both of them.<br>
<br>Coleridge settled in Bristol early in 1795, and thereafter depended increasingly on Poole's forthright advice and practical support. Poole contributed an article on the slave trade to Coleridge's periodical <span class="italic">The Watchman</span>, and when publication ceased, with considerable losses, in May 1796, it was Poole who arranged for a group of friends to supply Coleridge with a generous annuity. At the end of the year Poole yielded reluctantly to Coleridge's persuasion by finding him a cottage in Lime Street, Nether Stowey, where Coleridge, with his wife Sara and infant son Hartley, took up residence on 1 January 1797. In July it was Poole as well who arranged for William and Dorothy Wordsworth to become tenants of Alfoxden, a mansion 3 miles west of Nether Stowey. By that means was achieved the conjunction of personalities which led to the publication in the following year of <span class="italic">Lyrical Ballads</span>.<br>
<br>Poole quickly became known to the wider circle associated with Coleridge and Wordsworth. The radical orator John Thelwall, visiting Alfoxden in July 1797, called him &#145;Arcadian Pool&#146;  (Thelwall, &#145;Lines written at Bridgewater, in Somersetshire&#146;), and others, including Charles Lamb and William Hazlitt, also met and admired him. It was probably in 1797 that both Poole and Coleridge came to know the Wedgwood brothers, Thomas and Josiah, and at some time in 1799 that Poole was first introduced to Humphry Davy, then newly appointed as superintendent of the Pneumatic Institution in Bristol. Poole's affectionate friendship with Davy continued until the latter's death in 1829.<br>
<br>Tom Poole's stories of Somerset life and customs contributed to the poetry of Wordsworth in particular. Poole's account of John Walford, a charcoal burner hanged in 1789 for murdering his wife, was the basis of Wordsworth's unfinished poem <span class="italic">A Somersetshire Tragedy</span> (destroyed in 1931). Poole was also a source for &#145;The Idiot Boy&#146; and, it seems likely, &#145;The Last of the Flock&#146;. His garden in Nether Stowey was the setting for Coleridge's poem &#145;This Lime-Tree Bower my Prison&#146;, and it was for Poole that Coleridge wrote his resonant autobiographical letters, completed during 1797&#150;8.<br>
<br>In August 1797, when fears of a French invasion were at their height, the activities in Somerset of Coleridge, Wordsworth, and Poole came under Home Office scrutiny. The government agent who was sent to investigate described Poole as &#145;a most Violent Member of the Corresponding Society and a strenuous supporter of Its friends&#146;, reporting also that Poole had the &#145;intire command&#146; of 150 poor men belonging to the Nether Stowey Benefit Club  (Roe, 260&#150;61). The report mixed exaggeration and inaccuracy (Poole never belonged to the London Corresponding Society) but demonstrated the degree of suspicion which he was now arousing.<br>
<br>During Coleridge's absence in Germany, from September 1798 to July 1799, Poole took responsibility for Coleridge's family and gave his sometimes inept support to Sara Coleridge when her second child, Berkeley, was taken ill and died. Poole bitterly regretted Coleridge's decision to settle at Keswick in July 1800, attributing it to Coleridge's uncritical subservience to Wordsworth. Thereafter the two men continued to correspond intermittently, though with something less than their former openness, and in October 1800 Coleridge used three essays by Poole, entitled &#145;Monopolists and farmers&#146;, in a series which appeared in the <span class="italic">Morning Post</span>  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, ed. Erdman, 1.243&#150;4; 3.40&#150;58).<br>
<br>Later meetings were few. Coleridge visited Poole at Nether Stowey in 1801&#150;2 and 1803, and stayed for three months during the summer of 1807. Other members of the family also visited, including, in 1817, Hartley Coleridge, of whom Poole was consistently supportive. Coleridge and Poole met for the last time in London during May 1834, a few weeks before Coleridge's death. By then any differences between them had been forgotten. As Coleridge wrote to Poole in 1813, following one in a series of minor disagreements, mostly about money, &#145;Love so deep &amp; so domesticated with the whole Being, as mine was to you, can never cease <i>to be</i>&#146;  (<span class="italic">Collected Letters</span>, ed. Griggs, 3.435).<br>
<br>Poole grew prosperous not only as a tanner but also as the farmer of &#145;195 Acres of good land &hellip; on which I endeavour to exhibit the best husbandry I can&#146;  (Mrs H. Sandford, 2.147). After his mother's death in 1801 Poole gave up management of his tanning business to his assistant Thomas Ward, and in 1802 travelled extensively in Europe, visiting Tom Paine in Paris. In the same year he met John Rickman for the first time, and at Rickman's suggestion took responsibility during 1804 for compiling the official abstract of returns made under 43 George III, c. 144, an act concerning the maintenance of the poor. Poole was an energetic justice of the peace for Somerset from 1814 until his death, and also took a lifelong interest in the welfare of local people. He established Nether Stowey's Book Society in 1793, its Female Friendly Society in 1807, and its elementary school in 1812&#150;13. Thomas De Quincey, who met Poole in 1807, wrote of him that he had &#145;so entirely dedicated himself to the service of his humble fellow countrymen &hellip; that for many miles around he was the general arbiter of their disputes, the guide and counsellor of their daily lives&#146;  (De Quincey, 35). His friends, while acknowledging his attractive personality and great generosity of heart, were not blind to his faults, which included a short temper and a sometimes bombastic manner. Southey, a frequent visitor to Nether Stowey, wrote that Poole &#145;would at times come clodhopping over one's feelings&#146; and that &#145;he was never content to be your friend, but he must be your saviour&#146;  (Crosse, 1.95).<br>
<br>Poole at the age of forty was, in De Quincey's description, &#145;a stout plain-looking farmer&#146;  (De Quincey, 35). His voice, ruined by excessive snuff-taking, remained proudly expressive of his Somerset origins throughout his life. There are three known portraits, of which one by Thomas Barber of Nottingham, showing a balding, thick-set man in middle age, was twice engraved.<br>
<br>Tom Poole died suddenly of pleurisy at Nether Stowey on 8 September 1837, never having completed the memoir of Coleridge he was being urged to write in his final years. Representatives of west Somerset's leading gentry families were pall bearers at his funeral on 15 September. He was buried next to his parents in the churchyard of St Mary's Church, Nether Stowey, and a memorial to him, recording his friendships and his great qualities, was erected in the church itself. He never married.<br>
