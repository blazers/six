<span class="headword">Hills,  Robert</span>  (1769&#150;1844), <span class="occ">landscape and animal painter</span>, was born at Islington, Middlesex, on 26 June 1769. He received lessons from the drawing master John Alexander Gresse, possibly at Mrs Broadbelt's school in Queen Square, Bloomsbury, and he entered the Royal Academy Schools in 1788. The artist made his d&eacute;but at the academy in 1791, showing a <span class="italic">Wood Scene with Gypsey Fortune Tellers</span>, but he exhibited few works in the following decade, concentrating, instead, on producing and publishing an extensive set of <span class="italic">Etchings of Quadropeds</span> (1798&#150;1815). This eventually comprised 780 images of domestic, farm, and wild animals, and, according to the title-page, was aimed at amateur and student artists &#145;for the embellishment of landscape&#146;. The etchings, covering a wide range of characteristic poses, were the outcome of a vast number of studies made from nature, as well as close anatomical study. The print room at the British Museum holds a collection of over 1200 of the finest impressions and proofs.<br>
<br>Hills's animal and landscape studies from the 1790s show a fluent draughtsmanship, but his use of watercolour&#151;his favourite medium&#151;was rather old-fashioned. From around 1800, however, he had begun to move in more advanced watercolour circles. Along with his friend James Ward, and neighbours Samuel Shelley and William Henry Pyne, Hills took a leading role in a sketching society which met from 1800 to 1806 in the winter months to sketch and talk about art, as well as undertaking expeditions to study from nature in the summer. The society encouraged the ambitions of watercolourists and the members, including Hills, Shelley, and Pyne, were prime movers in the foundation of the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/96320', "Society of Painters in Water Colours")</script> in 1804 as an independent exhibition. Hills was the society's first secretary and, during the period from 1805 to 1812, one of its staunchest supporters, showing 203 works. He resigned in 1812 when it was decided to allow oils into the exhibitions, though he continued to exhibit until 1818. Resuming his connection with the society in 1823, he acted as treasurer from 1827 to 1831, and as secretary again from 1832 until his death in 1844. In all, Hills showed almost 600 works at the society, including collaborations with artists such as George Fennel Robson, George Barret the younger, David Cox, and William Andrews Nesfield.<br>
<br>Hills's exhibited works ranged in scale and price. The simplest comprised small animal groups and were often described as sketches in exhibition catalogues. The artist also produced more complex farm scenes which featured picturesque buildings and rural activities. Hills's most ambitious works, however, were larger in scale, typically combining a highly detailed landscape setting, based on careful topographical studies, with skilfully composed animal groups. Hills was perhaps at his best in works such as <span class="italic">A Village Snow Scene</span> (1819; Yale U. CBA), which shows his characteristic stipple technique and an inventive use of blank areas of paper. However, many of his later finished works were spoilt by an overheated palette, and today it is the more immediate colour sketches made on the spot, often accompanied with notes in shorthand, that maintain his reputation as both a sensitive observer of the natural world and an accurate recorder of the early nineteenth-century agricultural landscape. The most important group of sketches is to be found in Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery. Hills occasionally produced oil paintings, and a number were among the forty-four works he showed at the Royal Academy from 1791 to 1824; he also modelled a number of animals in clay.<br>
<br>Hills's travels in Britain were primarily confined to the Lake District and to the south-eastern counties, particularly in Kent near the home of his main patron, John Garle. There is some evidence of a link with the group of artists surrounding Samuel Palmer at Shoreham known as the Ancients. In addition, Hills made a number of visits to the continent: in 1814 he went to Paris, and in July 1815 he travelled through Holland and Flanders to visit the battlefield of Waterloo, where he made a series of sketches. These formed the basis of fifty-three aquatints etched by himself which were published as <span class="italic">Sketches in Flanders and Holland with some account of a tour shortly after the battle of Waterloo</span> (1816). Although Hills emerges as a curiously dispassionate observer of the aftermath of war, the images also provide a compelling record of Flemish topography and its people. The artist also visited Jersey twice, the second time with G. F. Robson in 1833.<br>
<br>Hills died unmarried at 17 Golden Square, London, on 14 May 1844. He was buried at Kensal Green cemetery, Middlesex. The long list of bequests left in his will reinforces the impression of a man dedicated to the art of the watercolour who had a wide circle of friends. Among the benefactors was Isaac Mendez Belisario of Kingston, Jamaica, an exhibitor at the Society of Painters in Water Colours from 1815 to 1831 whose works were in a style close to that of Hills, his friend and teacher.<br>
