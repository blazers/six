<span class="headword">Long,  Edwin Longsden</span>  (1829&#150;1891), <span class="occ">painter</span>, was born at Bath on 16 July 1829, the son of James Long, of a family resident in Kelston in Somerset. He was educated at Dr Charles William Viner's academy at 15 Edward Street, Bath; he then moved to London in 1846 to pursue a career as a painter and enrolled as a student at James Matthew Leigh's School of Art, then at 18 Maddox Street. He began his professional life as a portrait painter in Bath, making his d&eacute;but at the Royal Academy in 1855 with three distinguished portraits. Other early portraits included likenesses of celebrated figures such as Lord Ellesmere (1856, National Portrait Gallery, London) and Charles Greville (exh. RA, 1856). On 19 March 1853 he married Margaret Jemima Aiton (1834&#150;1907).<br>
<br>In 1857 Long returned to London, where he was to settle the following year, and came under the influence of John Phillip with whom he visited Spain and was introduced to the work of the great Spanish masters Vel&aacute;zquez and Murillo, as well as to the country which was to dominate his painting for the next seventeen years. In this period his output was prolific, and he produced a large number of Spanish genre scenes. His Spanish work also includes his first history paintings such as <span class="italic">The Suppliants</span> (1872, Royal Holloway and Bedford New College, University of London, Egham, Surrey) and <span class="italic">The Moorish Proselytes</span> (1873, Russell-Cotes Art Gallery and Museum, Bournemouth) which were significant markers in establishing him as a serious artist. The rise in his reputation was dramatic and came with <span class="italic">Babylonian Marriage Market</span> (1875, Royal Holloway and Bedford New College, Egham), which was exhibited at the Royal Academy exhibition of 1875. He had made an extensive visit to Egypt and Syria the year before, and the work had been some time in conception. The enthusiastic critical reception was unprecedented for Long and the work ensured his associateship to the Royal Academy in January 1876.<br>
<br>Subsequently Long's work was characterized by highly detailed and researched depictions of the ancient world. Works such as <span class="italic">An Egyptian Feast</span> (1877, Cartwright Hall Art Gallery, Bradford), <span class="italic">The Gods and their Makers</span> (1878, Towneley Hall Art Gallery and Museum, Burnley), and <span class="italic">Alethe</span> (1888, Russell-Cotes Art Gallery and Museum, Bournemouth)&#151;all shown at the Royal Academy&#151;illustrate his major achievement within this area. His works often contain a strong religious sentiment reflected in scenes which contrasted the early church with ancient religions, as well as more conventional biblical scenes. His successes, evident at the Royal Academy (he was elected a full academician on 13 July 1881), were also visible in the commercial galleries in Bond Street. Several were devoted exclusively to his work: Fairless and Beeforth set up a gallery of his work to follow up the success of their Dor&eacute; Gallery and showed his ambitious <span class="italic">Anno Domini, or, The Flight into Egypt</span> (1883, Russell-Cotes Art Gallery and Museum, Bournemouth). Thomas Agnew &amp; Sons, meanwhile, commissioned many works from him, including a series of twenty paintings entitled <span class="roman">Daughters of Our Empire</span> to coincide with Queen Victoria's golden jubilee year of 1887.<br>
<br>Long's commercial success was reflected in his lifestyle: he commissioned two grand studio houses from the fashionable architect Richard Norman Shaw, built next to one another in Hampstead. He did not have the personality of a natural celebrity, being a small and quiet man with a gentle disposition. M. H. Spielmann in his article in <span class="italic">The Graphic</span> of 1888 described him as &#145;reticent and retiring&#146;  (Spielmann, 612), while Julian Hawthorne in <span class="italic">Shapes that Pass</span> (1928) remembered him as a &#145;thin, unobtrusive man, with a brown beard, gentle of speech&#146;  (Hawthorne, 251). Long died of pneumonia caused by influenza on 15 May 1891 at his home, Kelston, 42 Netherhall Gardens, Hampstead, London, and was buried at Hampstead cemetery on 22 May. He left three sons, a daughter, and a bitterly contested fortune of about &pound;120,000. His widow, Margaret Long, set up the Edwin Long Gallery at 25 Old Bond Street in 1893 to revitalize interest in his work. The principal public collection of his works is now in the Russell-Cotes Art Gallery and Museum in Bournemouth.<br>
