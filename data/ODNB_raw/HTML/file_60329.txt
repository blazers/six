<span class="headword">Williams,  Owen Tudor</span>  (1916&#150;1996), <span class="occ">civil engineer</span>, was born on 4 October 1916 at 22 Albert Mansions, Battersea, London, the older child and only son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/51931/', "Sir (Evan) Owen Williams (1890&#150;1969)")</script>, civil engineer and architect, and his first wife, Gwladys Clarissa, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Tustian (1888&#150;1947). Following his mother's death on 5 June 1947, his father married Doreen Elizabeth, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Baker (<i>b</i>. 1913/14), and Williams acquired a half-brother and a half-sister. O. T. (as he was always known, to distinguish him from his father) was educated at Shrewsbury School from 1929 until 1933 before going on to St Catharine's College, Cambridge, to read engineering. Immediately on graduation, in 1937, he joined his father's consultancy, which was started in 1919. At once he was involved in all aspects of the wide range of projects passing through the office at the time. These included the Boots &#145;drys&#146; factory at Nottingham, the <span class="italic">Daily Express</span> premises in Manchester and Glasgow, and the J. Sainsbury factory in London's Blackfriars. O. T.'s site experience, enabling him to gain his membership of the Institution of Civil Engineers, was obtained on the <span class="italic">Daily News</span> garage in Southwark.<br>
<br>After the outbreak of the Second World War Williams joined the engineering section of the Admiralty. He first served overseas in Sierra Leone, where he worked on the design of the wartime barracks. In late 1943 he returned to take up a posting in Scotland. There he worked on Admiralty establishments at Cromarty, Invergordon, and Inverness, and Royal Naval air stations at Macrihanish and Campbeltown. On 15 September 1943 he married Rosemary Louisa, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Mander (<i>b</i>. 1920), who worked for the government before her marriage; they had four sons. Williams completed his wartime service at the Admiralty with the equivalent rank of lieutenant-commander. He returned to Sir Owen Williams &amp; Partners with the wealth of experience gained from his service with the Admiralty; at the age of thirty he was appointed a partner. He was deeply involved with one of his father's last major projects, the maintenance hangars at London airport. The hangars, built to service British Overseas Airways Corporation aircraft, were completed in 1955 and were widely acknowledged to be spectacular examples of the use of reinforced concrete; they were a vital part of the early development of London Heathrow. However, in the 1950s the practice was developing its role in highway and motorway engineering and it was in this field that Williams was to forge his reputation. He was actively engaged in the government's plans for the country's strategic road network from the early 1950s until his retirement in 1987. It was thus that he moved from the shadow of his father's massive reputation to establish himself as one of the most distinguished and creative motorway designers of his time.<br>
<br>In 1951 Sir Owen Williams &amp; Partners had been appointed to carry out feasibility and design studies for a motorway from London to Yorkshire. In 1955 the government took the decision to proceed with its construction by building the first section of what became the M1. Williams and his father were both closely associated with the design and later the supervision of the road's construction. Their work on the project was described in a joint paper presented to the Institution of Civil Engineers in 1961, for which both were awarded the institution's highest award, the Telford gold medal. This was a rare instance of father and son achieving that distinction. Important as the M1 was in the history of the country's motorway development, no less so was Williams's considerable contribution to the extension of the motorway system into south Wales. The Port Talbot bypass and the Newport bypass, both important early sections of the M4 London to south Wales motorway, followed and, after delays due to national economic problems, were opened to traffic in 1967. However, the project for which Williams was best remembered was undoubtedly the lengths of the M5 and M6 motorways around Birmingham which formed the midland links, and which contained the instantly recognizable &#145;spaghetti junction&#146;. It was a rare achievement to engineer a project that became an instantly and universally recognized part of the nation's vocabulary, and its opening in 1972 was a landmark in Williams's career. His work continued unabated after 1972: there were extensions to the M4 in south Wales, the M54 Telford motorway in the midlands, parts of the M40 and M42, and, in the south, the Ashford to Sellindge section of the M20. Of the first 1000 miles of the British motorway system, the government's declared target, Williams and his firm were responsible for the design and supervision of construction of a fifth of that total.<br>
<br>In 1966, with his father's health failing, Williams took over the role of managing partner of the consultancy and assumed responsibility for managing the day-to-day activities of the practice. In 1969, shortly before his father's death, Williams was appointed CBE in recognition of his services in the engineering of the nation's motorway network. Motorway and highway work were always at the forefront of his activities, but he took a keen interest in other aspects of engineering. In 1974 he played a key role in establishing a consortium with European contractors to design concrete gravity platforms for use in offshore oil exploration. He was active in overseas ventures and built close links with both Japanese consultants and contractors following his firm's appointment as adviser to the Japanese Highways Corporation. He also undertook toll roads in Portugal, Turkey, and Kuwait. In spite of his involvement in the work of his own practice, Williams was an active member of a number of research committees established by the Transport and Road Research Laboratory. In this way he played a significant role in the development of modern techniques and specifications associated with road design and construction.<br>
<br>In 1987, having completed fifty years' service with his firm, Williams retired. In the same year, as a further acknowledgement of his work in highway engineering and his standing in the engineering profession, he was elected a fellow of the Royal Academy of Engineering. In retirement he never lost his lifelong interest in engineering. Happily, he found time to engage in his two favourite pastimes, woodwork and gardening. He had considerable skill and expertise in both. In 1992 his eldest son, Richard Williams, became the third member of the family to assume management of the consultancy firm. Williams died of a heart attack at his home, 18 Little Gaddesden, Berkhamsted, Hertfordshire, on 14 July 1996. He was buried at St Peter and St Paul's Church, Little Gaddesden, on 23 July. He was survived by his wife and four sons, each of whom was engaged in some aspect of engineering, which played such a dominant role in his own life.<br>
