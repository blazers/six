<span class="headword">Peard,  Shuldham</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1761, <em>d.</em> 1832), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, third son of Captain George Peard RN, was born at Penryn, Cornwall, and was baptized at the church of St Gluvias, Penryn, on 29 October 1761. At the age of ten he was entered on the books of the <i>Fly</i>, and afterwards on those of the <i>Racehorse</i>, as an able seaman. He probably first went afloat in 1776, in the <i>Worcester</i>, with Captain Mark Robinson; he was afterwards in the <i>Martin</i> with Captain (afterwards Sir William) Parker, and in the <i>Thetis</i> with Captain John Gell on the Newfoundland station. In 1779, having been sent away in command of a prize, he was taken prisoner and taken to Cadiz. After his return to England, he passed his examination on 6 April 1780, and on 26 April was promoted lieutenant. In June 1780 he was appointed to the <i>Edgar</i>, one of the Channel Fleet, and continued in her until February 1782, taking part in the relief of Gibraltar in April 1781. From 1785 to 1790 he was in the <i>Carnatic</i>, guardship at Plymouth; in 1790&#150;91, during the Spanish armament, he was in the <i>Princess Royal</i>, flagship of Rear-Admiral Hotham, at Portsmouth, and was again in the <i>Carnatic</i> in 1791&#150;2. In January 1793 he went on the <i>Britannia</i> to the Mediterranean with the flag of Hotham, and on 30 January 1795 was promoted to command the <i>Fl&egrave;che</i>.<br>
<br>On 5 May 1795 Peard was posted to the <i>Censeur</i>, and in July was appointed to the <i>Britannia</i> as second captain. From her, in January 1796, he was moved into the <i>St George</i> (98 guns), which he still commanded on 18 January 1797, when, as the fleet was leaving Lisbon, she got on shore, had to cut away her masts, and was left behind disabled, while the fleet went on to fight the battle of Cape St Vincent. The ship afterwards rejoined the flag off Cadiz, and was still there in the beginning of July, when a violent mutiny broke out on board. Peard, with his own hands, assisted by the first lieutenant, seized two of the ringleaders, dragged them out of the crowd, and had them put in irons. His daring and resolute conduct cowed the rest, and they returned to their duty; but the two men were promptly tried, convicted, and hanged on 8&#150;9 July. Of Peard's conduct on this occasion his commander-in-chief, St Vincent, thought very highly, and years afterwards wrote, &#145;his merit in facing the mutiny on board the St George ought never to be forgotten or unrewarded&#146;  (Tucker, 408).<br>
<br>In March 1799 Peard commissioned the frigate <i>Success</i> for the Mediterranean, and on his way out, when off Lisbon, met and was chased by the Brest fleet. He, however, escaped, and joined Lord Keith off Cadiz on 3 May, in time to warn him of the approaching danger. In the following February the <i>Success</i> formed part of the squadron blockading Malta, and on the 18th she had a large share in the capture of the <i>G&eacute;n&eacute;reux</i>, hampering her movements as she tried to escape, and raking her several times. On 9 February 1801 the <i>Success</i> was lying at Gibraltar, when a strong French squadron, under Rear-Admiral Ganteaume, passed through the straits. Peard conjectured&#151;correctly&#151;that they were bound for Egypt, and, thinking that Keith ought to be warned, he immediately followed, hoping to pass them on the way. He fell in with them off Cape Gata, but was prevented by calms and variable winds from passing, and, after a chase of three days, was overtaken and captured. From the prisoners Ganteaume learned that the route to Egypt might be full of danger to himself, and turned aside to Toulon, from where Peard and his men were at once sent to Port Mahon for an exchange of prisoners.<br>
<br>On Peard's return to England he was appointed, in June 1801, to the <i>Audacious</i> (74 guns), in which he joined the squadron at Gibraltar under Sir James Saumarez (afterwards Lord de Saumarez), and took part in the actions at Algeciras on 6 July, and in the straits on the night of the 12th. The <i>Audacious</i> was afterwards sent to the West Indies, and was paid off in October 1802. In 1803 and during the war Peard commanded the sea-fencibles on the coast of Cornwall. On 5 July 1814 he was superannuated as a rear-admiral, but was restored to the active list on 5 July 1827, and advanced to vice-admiral on 22 July 1830. He was twice married. His second wife was Matilda, daughter of William Fortescue of Penwarne, Cornwall; they had two sons. His elder son, Captain George Peard RN, died in 1837; the younger, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21695/', "John Whitehead Peard (1811&#150;1880)")</script> was &#145;Garibaldi's Englishman&#146;. Peard died at Barton Place, near Exeter, on 27 December 1832.<br>
