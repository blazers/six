<span class="headword">Taylor,  Joseph</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1586?, <em>d.</em> 1652), <span class="occ">actor</span>, was probably (although his name was far from uncommon) the child who was baptized under that name at the church of St Andrew by the Wardrobe, London, on 6 February 1586. He is first recorded as a player in 1610, when he became a founding member of the Duke of York's Men, a company formed under the patronage of the ten-year-old Prince Charles. A patent of 30 March 1610 names seven players, including &#145;John Garland Willyam Rowley&#146; and &#145;Joseph Taylor &hellip; already sworne servauntes to our deere sonne the Duke of york and Rothesay&#146;  (Chambers and Greg, 273). Garland was the leader of the group. Will Rowley was the playwright and comic actor who later collaborated with Thomas Middleton in his greatest plays.<br>
<br>The King's Men, the acting company that performed Shakespeare's plays in London up to 1642, acquired Joseph Taylor in 1619, when Richard Burbage died. Burbage had been the company's leading player for the first twenty-five years of its existence. He was the first player of Hamlet and all the other leading roles in Shakespeare, most of which Taylor inherited. Taylor must therefore have been a highly skilled and versatile player. Even before he joined the King's Men, who worked, and most of whom lived, in Southwark, parish records appear to locate Taylor as living in the parish of St Saviour's, Southwark. He married Elizabeth Ingle there in 1610, and between 1612 and 1623 eight of his children were baptized there, and one buried. Taylor must have known some of Shakespeare's company long before he began to work with them.<br>
<br>One of the King's Men whom Taylor knew was very likely John Heminges. In 1610 five of York's players in the new venture bought their company's first costumes from Heminges, a purchase which later gave Taylor some trouble. At Easter 1611 he left the company &#145;by the licence and leave of his said Master the Duke upon some speciall reason&#146;  (Chambers, 2.243). The reason was to help form the Lady Elizabeth's Men, who came into existence with a patent just after Easter 1611. Heminges brought a lawsuit for non-payment of the York's company's bill against Taylor, who alleged that the other four signatories had contrived to lay the blame on him. His 1611 departure was to join the last of the five companies formed in King James's time to be given royal patronage. James had made himself patron of the leading company in 1603, and given the next two best to his elder son and wife. In 1608 a new company was established for his younger son, Charles, then aged eight, and his daughter Elizabeth acquired hers in 1611. The Lady Elizabeth's Men was formed, like York's before it, with a core of six experienced adult players and several youths from a company of boy players, now grown into their early teens. Taylor led this group until 1615, a difficult time for players, when more playing companies were struggling to stay in London than there were playhouses to perform in. His company then amalgamated with the Prince Charles, the former Duke of York's, his original company. He was not a man to hold grudges, and was to prove a sturdy team player and leader. For the next three years the merged company divided its time between playing at the Curtain Theatre, the oldest and poorest in London, and the new dual-purpose theatre also used for bear-baiting, the Hope. Its leader player was a graduate of the Blackfriars boy company, Nathan Field, who led the company with Taylor for several years, until Field preceded him into the King's Men.<br>
<br>Under Field and Taylor the company did not lack ambitions. The King's Men were pre-eminent, abandoning their traditional open-air Globe each winter for the roofed hall playhouse, the Blackfriars. With Edward Alleyn's support the Taylor company tried to get themselves a hall too, the abortive Porter's Hall project. When the privy council banned it, they reverted to the new Hope, playing Jonson's <span class="italic">Bartholomew Fair</span> there in 1614. But that proved not to be a desirable venue. On 20 March 1616 Alleyn and Henslowe's old partner in the royal bear business, Jacob Meade, signed an agreement with a group of the leading Prince Charles's and Lady Elizabeth's players, one of whom was Taylor. An undated letter to Alleyn from Taylor, Rowley, and five others, which probably belongs to 1616, is an apology for leaving the Hope on Bankside, not because of the intemperate weather but because of the &#145;more intemperate Mr. Meade&#146;, the controller of the bears, who were also players at the Hope  (<span class="italic">Henslowe Papers</span>, 93). The letter asks Alleyn to find them another playhouse, and to give them a loan to tide them over. The last record of his work for the merged Lady Elizabeth's&#150;Prince's Men is when he performed in the Inner Temple masque of January or February 1619.<br>
<br>While in the Lady Elizabeth's, Taylor played in such hits as Jonson's play and two Beaumont and Fletcher plays, <span class="italic">The Coxcomb</span> and <span class="italic">The Honest Man's Fortune</span>. Once he joined the King's Men, about April 1619, he played Hamlet, and Iago in <span class="italic">Othello</span>, Truewit in <span class="italic">Epicene</span>, Face in <span class="italic">The Alchemist</span> and Mosca in <span class="italic">Volpone</span>, Philaster in the Beaumont and Fletcher play of that name, Amintor in their <span class="italic">Maid's Tragedy</span> and Arbaces in <span class="italic">A King and No King</span>, Ferdinand in Webster's <span class="italic">Duchess of Malfi</span>, Mathias in Massinger's <span class="italic">The Picture</span>, Paris in his <span class="italic">The Roman Actor</span>, and Rollo in <span class="italic">The Bloody Brother</span>. These were not all roles he inherited from Burbage, since Burbage played Othello and Subtle. On some evidence that has not survived, Edmond Malone also thought that he might have painted the Chandos portrait of Shakespeare.<br>
<br>Once John Heminges retired from working as a King's Men's player and their financial manager in the mid-1620s, a role he performed for thirty years, Taylor became one of the two leaders of the company. Traditionally at least two of the leading players, or &#145;sharers&#146; in a London-based company's costs and profits, had the authority to sign papers and collect payments on behalf of the whole company. From about 1625 until 1642, when all the companies were dissolved, Taylor served with John Lowin, and sometimes Eliart Swanston, as the King's Men's chief agent and co-leader. After Heminges died in 1629 Taylor acquired a share in the company's two playhouses, the Blackfriars and the Globe, a source of revenue at least equal to his income as an actor. His status as the King's Men's manager also gained him a royal appointment in 1639 as yeoman of the revels, a post which gave Taylor access to the wardrobe of costumes and properties used for court performances and paid him 6<i>d</i>. per day, about half the daily wage of a skilled artisan. Five years earlier, on twelfth night 1634, Taylor had presented a revival of Fletcher's <span class="italic">The Faithful Shepherdess</span> before the king and queen at Whitehall, with costumes given to Taylor by Henrietta Maria from &#145;the year before of her owne pastorall&#146;  (Bentley, 2.595).<br>
<br>After the theatres closed in September 1642 Taylor's occupation was gone, but he stayed loyal to it. He was one of the ten King's Men who signed the dedication to the 1647 Beaumont and Fletcher folio, and he was captured at the Cockpit in 1648 during an illegal performance of <span class="italic">Rollo, Duke of Normandy, or, The Bloody Brother</span>. He died in 1652 in Richmond, Surrey, and was buried there on 4 November. After the Restoration he was remembered nostalgically as the most distinguished player in the great company which kept the plays of Shakespeare and Jonson on stage up to 1642.<br>
