<span class="headword">Wilenski,  Reginald Howard</span>  (1887&#150;1975), <span class="occ">art critic and historian</span>, was born at 16 Upper Westbourne Terrace, Paddington, London, on 7 March 1887, the son of Abraham Arthur Wilenski, merchant, and his wife, Alice (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Simeon), of 16 Upper Westbourne Terrace, Paddington. The surnames suggest a Polish ancestry, and Jewish descent on both his father's and mother's sides. Elected a foundation scholar at St Paul's School, London, he won the John Watson art prizes three years running, in 1902&#150;5 (a fellow premiate in 1904 was Eric Kennington). He won the Smee science prize in 1903; and in 1904 both the Truro prize, for an essay on epic poetry, and the Butterworth prize for English literature. His headmaster observed in his final report that Wilenski was &#145;very rigorous and capable, has shown power in a great many directions&#146;, but added that &#145;if he were to read for Moderations with profit, he must apply himself to Classics&#146;  (private information). Wilenski left St Paul's in July 1905 and went up to Balliol College, Oxford, to read classics, but stayed only a year before leaving, without a degree, to study painting in Munich and Paris. He returned to London in 1909.<br>
<br>He exhibited at the International Society, the Royal Society of Portrait Painters, and the Salon d'Automne, Paris, but achieved no reputation as a painter, although he always described himself as &#145;artist and art critic&#146;. He presumably enjoyed financial support from his father, since on 5 August 1914 he married, at Kensington register office, Marjorie Isold Harland (1889&#150;1965), a university graduate and daughter of Robert Wilson Harland, civil engineer. By now Wilenski <i>p&egrave;re</i> described himself as of independent means, and lived at Maida Vale. Wilenski spent the years of the First World War in the War Office intelligence department.<br>
<br>After the war Wilenski devoted himself to art criticism and wrote exhibition reviews for the <span class="italic">Evening Standard</span> between 1923 and 1926. Encouraged by the publisher Geoffrey Faber, Wilenski wrote his first polemical book, <span class="italic">The Modern Movement in Art</span> (1927), in which he saw the modern movement as a return to the architectural or classical idea, especially in the work of the cubists and their followers (he ignored German expressionism, Dada, and surrealism). French critics had earlier made a similar claim. Wilenski considered the study of art history useful only in so far as it shed light on contemporary art, and all his books were aimed at the interested, educated layman. Perhaps his best didactic book is <span class="italic">The Meaning of Modern Sculpture</span> (1932), where he attacked those who thought the ancient Greek sculptors were the &#145;first and last to achieve perfection&#146;. He called this the &#145;finality-complex&#146; and was adept at inventing categories and catch-phrases, which, allied to a pithy style and short sentences, proclaimed his journalistic skills. He defended contemporary sculptors' search for fresh inspiration from non-classical sources.<br>
<br>Wilenski wrote substantial historical surveys of Dutch, French, and English painting in 1929, 1931, and 1933 respectively, to coincide with the large-scale Royal Academy winter exhibitions of those national schools held in 1929, 1932, and 1934. These all followed a similar pattern: the span covered by each exhibition was broken down into periods, and Wilenski wrote a general introduction, followed by a more detailed discussion of individual artists and their works. He adopted the same approach for <span class="italic">Modern French Painters</span> (1940), and for his two-volume <span class="italic">Flemish Painters, 1430&#150;1830</span> (1960), the last a carefully researched synthesis of known material presented in layman's language. These popular volumes ran to many revised editions. He ventured into psychological analysis in <span class="italic">John Ruskin: an Introduction to Further Study of his Life and Work</span> (1933), and suggested Ruskin's madness had begun, not in old age, but in early manhood.<br>
<br>Wilenski, if less influential and profound than Roger Fry, or less infectiously enthusiastic than Clive Bell or Herbert Read, nevertheless provided soundly based, well-illustrated accounts of subjects not catered for elsewhere at that time. In 1945 he began editing the <span class="roman">Faber Gallery</span> series of paperbound coloured picture albums, with eminently readable introductions by either himself or other notables, as in <span class="italic">Florentine Paintings</span>, by Kenneth Clark; some forty titles eventually appeared under his editorship.<br>
<br>Wilenski became a special lecturer in art at Bristol University (1929&#150;30), and a special lecturer in the history of art at Manchester University (1933&#150;45); Manchester University conferred an honorary MA on him in 1938. A press censor from 1939 to 1941, Wilenski also served in the BBC European Services in 1941&#150;4. He was appointed chevalier of the L&eacute;gion d'honneur in 1967.<br>
<br>Wilenski died of bronchopneumonia at Marlow Cottage Hospital, Buckinghamshire, on 19 April 1975, and was cremated.<br>
