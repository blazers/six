<span class="headword">Deutsch,  Emanuel Oscar Menahem</span>  (1829&#150;1873), <span class="occ">Semitic scholar and orientalist</span>, was born of Jewish parents in Neisse in Prussian Silesia on 28 October 1829, and at the age of six entered the local <i>Gymnasium</i>. Two years later he was sent to study with his uncle, Rabbi David Deutsch of Mislowitz (1810&#150;1873), a distinguished Talmudist and author of an annotated translation of the book of <span class="roman">Habakkuk</span> (1837). A strong opponent of Reform Judaism, Rabbi Deutsch held his nephew to a rigorous schedule. Winter and summer he had to rise at 5 a.m. and his whole day was devoted to the study of Hebrew and Aramaic literature, except for half an hour for exercise and recreation. At thirteen he returned to Neisse, where, since he had attained the necessary standard for his final examination at the <i>Gymnasium</i> before the prescribed period, the rules were relaxed in his favour, and he was allowed to matriculate at the University of Berlin at sixteen. Unable to secure a teaching position at a <i>Gymnasium</i> or university without conversion to Christianity, Deutsch supported himself by giving lessons and later by contributing Jewish tales and poems to German magazines.<br>
<br>In 1855 Deutsch was appointed, on the recommendation of the publishers Asher, first-class assistant in the library of the British Museum at a salary of &pound;295 per annum. Seldom has the department of printed books acquired the services of so variously accomplished a man. A Hebrew scholar of the first rank, he was also an excellent classicist. In Berlin he had studied ancient Greece with Boeckh, Latin with Meineke, history with Ranke, while Von Hagen had taught him folklore and German mythology. Despite his impressive credentials, for fifteen years he was largely confined to helot's work as a cataloguer of books. His major professional achievement as a consultant on oriental culture at the British Museum was his important assistance to W. S. W. Vaux (1818&#150;1885) in publishing in 1863 Phoenician inscriptions discovered on Carthaginian votive tablets in 1856&#150;8 by Nathan Davis (1812&#150;1882). Deciphering the Phoenician letters provided a standard of reference for determining inscriptions discovered thereafter.<br>
<br>Deutsch gradually perfected his grasp of colloquial English and achieved a unique prose style, an English version of Heine's ironic blending of satire and lyricism. In 1861 he published an anonymous piece on the purported literary plagiarisms of Robert Bulwer-Lytton (Owen Meredith) in the <span class="italic">Literary Gazette</span>  (165.180&#150;85). Throughout the early years of the decade his independent scholarship included learned articles in Smith's <span class="italic">Dictionary of the Bible</span> (&#145;Targums&#146;, &#145;Samaritan Pentateuch&#146;), Kitto's <span class="italic">Cyclopedia of Biblical Literature</span> (&#145;Lamentations&#146;, &#145;Phoenicia&#146;, &#145;Semitic languages&#146;), and a long series of unsigned contributions to Chambers's <span class="italic">Cyclopedia</span>.<br>
<br>By 1867 Deutsch's growing self-confidence as a popular writer and speaker of English joined with his erudition in religious and cultural history to produce a great success: the famous essay on the <span class="roman">Talmud</span>, in the <span class="italic">Quarterly Review</span> of October 1867  (123.246). This created an extraordinary sensation, as much by the vigour and richness of its language as by the novelty of its subject. It helped to correct the biased view of the <span class="roman">Talmud</span> that many English readers of the previous generation had imbibed from Isaac D'Israeli's dismissive approach in <span class="italic">The Genius of Judaism</span> (1833) and that was being promulgated even more strongly in the conversionist literature of the day. In the same year the British Museum was prepared to allow Deutsch to accompany the Abyssinian expedition, but he was discouraged from going by his friend the philologist Viscount Strangford (Percy Smythe), who thought this adventure would provide little if any archaeological results relevant to Deutsch's interest in the Middle East. His career at the British Museum, unsatisfactory in many ways, was coming into conflict with his reputation as a writer, lecturer, and epigraphist specializing in Semitic culture.<br>
<br>Throughout the rest of the decade Deutsch was besieged with applications for lectures and articles; he delivered courses of lectures at the Royal Institution (in 1868), the Midland Institute, and elsewhere, and his excessive labours, joined to habitual neglect of ordinary precautions of health, undermined a naturally robust constitution. Among those with whom he dined was the prime minister, Gladstone, who in February 1869 wrote that he &#145;had much interesting conversation with Mr Deutsch on Phoenicia&#146;  (Gladstone, <span class="italic">Diaries</span>, 7.29). Invited by Nubar Pasha to be present at the opening of the Suez Canal in the spring of 1869, he was unable to receive official leave from his cataloguing duties. He did, however, manage to arrange a two-month journey to Egypt, Lebanon, and Palestine in March and April that year, and explored antiquities near Sidon. At the request of George Grove (1820&#150;1900), founder of the Palestine Exploration Fund, he called on Charles Warren (1840&#150;1927), who was in charge of excavations in Jerusalem, and verified Phoenician stone-cutters' markings at the base of the outer wall of the Temple Mount. The distinguished archaeologist Charles Newton (1816&#150;1894) praised the report Deutsch filed with the trustees at the British Museum, but it was mysteriously misplaced. The &#145;Talmud Man&#146;, as he was now called by the press and public, chafed under what he felt was contempt by his superiors for his new status as a public figure and for his hopes of instituting a department of Semitic studies.<br>
<br>After Deutsch's return, renewed activity in lecturing and writing aggravated the stomach cancer which was slowly killing him. It was at this time that he wrote his article on Islam in the <span class="italic">Quarterly</span> for October 1869  (27.254), which, despite the epigrammatic brilliance of the style and the imaginative glow which were inseparable from his writings, struck many of his readers as less effective than his <span class="roman">Talmud</span> essay. Like too many &#145;sequels&#146; it failed to sustain the reputation which the earlier article had created. The main reason for the falling off from the <span class="roman">Talmud</span> essay was thought to be Deutsch's lack of sufficient expertise in Arabic matters, but the real &#145;fault&#146; of the essay was its relentless exposure of Islam's indebtedness to Judaism, a position that older readers who remembered Carlyle's &#145;The hero as prophet. Mahomet: Islam&#146; (1840) had difficulty in accepting. From September to November 1869 Deutsch contributed a series of striking articles on the Ecumenical Council to <span class="italic">The Times</span>. He wrote with the bitter memories of a Jew, and his retrospect of papal history at once startled and fascinated by its wealth of imagery and its unsparing irony. He championed the unsuccessful efforts of liberal delegates to block the campaign to establish papal infallibility.<br>
<br>In 1870 Deutsch's health visibly broke down. The dull routine of cataloguing in poorly ventilated rooms, and the close scrutiny of officious and hostile superiors augmented by private study at night, destroyed what little health remained. In this period many of the library staff were bitter and frustrated at their treatment, and after Deutsch's death a polemical pamphlet by Stephan Poles, <span class="italic">The Actual Condition of the British Museum</span> (1875), accused museum officials of causing the death of Deutsch, &#145;slowly murdered by the studied malice, and the petty jealousy of officials&#146;  (Miller, 287). Hugh Reginald Haweis (1838&#150;1901), perpetual curate of St James, Marylebone, London, and popular preacher and lecturer, and his wife, Mary, were Deutsch's neighbours; she took him into their home and nursed him until he was strong enough to undertake a last despairing journey to Egypt.<br>
<br>Deutsch died of stomach cancer at the Prussian Deaconesses' Hospital, Alexandria, on 12 May 1873, and was buried on 13 May in the Jewish cemetery, Alexandria. He had died still young, with the promise of his life unfulfilled. His true place in Hebrew scholarship was to have been decisively established by a great work, never completed, on the <span class="roman">Talmud</span>, of which the <span class="italic">Quarterly</span> article was but the foretaste. Nevertheless, his numerous articles and reviews on Semitic subjects reveal extensive reading and a wide grasp of oriental history, philosophy, and world literature. In whatever he wrote, his vividly poetic nature asserted itself. At the time of his death he was credited with having enlightened gentile attitudes toward Jewish culture. His executor, Emily Anne, Viscountess Strangford, published a representative collection of his work, <span class="italic">Literary Remains of Emanuel Deutsch, with a Brief Memoir</span> (1874).<br>
<br>Although Deutsch did not live to write a work which he hoped would allow the <span class="roman">Talmud</span> to enter the general discussion of antiquity in Western intellectual circles, his devotion to Jewish heritage greatly impressed George Eliot. She befriended him in the mid-1860s and encouraged his scholarship. In 1869 she went to Oxford primarily to hear his lecture on the Moabite stone. Deutsch gave her lessons in Hebrew and recommended important Jewish books. Gradually Eliot caught the fire of Deutsch's pre-Zionist vision and, shortly after he died, dedicated her last major novel, <span class="italic">Daniel Deronda</span> (1876), to the Jewish quest for a homeland. Her novel is his principal monument.<br>
