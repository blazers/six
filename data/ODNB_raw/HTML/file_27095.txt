<span class="headword">Taylor,  Wittewronge</span>  (<em>b. </em>before 1719, <em>d.</em> 1760), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, was the son of the Revd Thomas Taylor and his wife, Mary, daughter of James Wittewronge of Rothamsted, Hertfordshire, and Susanna Pedley. He entered the Royal Navy as a volunteer per order or king's letter-boy in the <i>Kingston</i> about 1727; he was subsequently listed as being on seven other ships in just seventeen months. His first seagoing experience appears to have been in 1736 on the <i>Windsor</i>. He remained in her, together with the <i>Ipswich</i> and <i>Anglesea</i> (in which he took part in the failed attack on Cartagena in April 1741), for five years. On 3 September 1741 he passed his lieutenant's examination, at which date he was judged more than twenty-two years old, having been at sea for more than ten years.<br>
<br>On 7 September Taylor was promoted lieutenant of the <i>Duke</i> on the home station. During 1743 and 1744 he held the same rank in the <i>St George</i> from which in October 1744 he was chosen to accompany Vice-Admiral Davers to the West Indies in the <i>Cornwall</i> in the rating of midshipman extra. In August of the following year Davers gave him a commission as fifth lieutenant of the <i>Cornwall</i> and in November he appointed him to command the <i>Vainqueur</i> tender. Taylor returned to the <i>Cornwall</i> eighteen months later, was present at the action off Havana on 1 October 1748, and was subsequently promoted by Sir Charles Knowles to command the sloop <i>Weasel</i>. Sent home, the ship was paid off in May 1749. In March 1755 he commanded the <i>Seaford</i> and afterwards the <i>Raven</i> in the channel and then with the western squadron until posted to the <i>Monarch</i> on 2 December. On 28 September of the following year he married Catherine Vincent (<i>d</i>. 1803), at Stoke Damerel parish church, Plymouth, while holding temporary command of the <i>Magnamine</i>.<br>
<br>Taylor held a number of commands over the next couple of years. In early 1758 he was appointed to the <i>Ramillies</i> (90 guns), the flagship of Sir Edward Hawke with whom he served continuously until the blockade of Brest in 1759. He remained in her when Hawke struck his flag and moved to the <i>Royal George</i> (14 November), taking command of the <i>Ramillies</i> on her return to Plymouth for refitting. In February 1760 she sailed as part of a squadron of three-deckers under the command of Admiral Edward Boscawen. On 15 February a severe westerly gale divided the ships and forced the <i>Ramillies</i> onto the rocks at Bolt Head with the death, including that of Taylor, of all but 26 of the 734 crew. Taylor was survived by his wife; shocked by the loss of the <i>Ramillies</i> and so many of his former crew, Admiral Hawke soon afterwards sought to guarantee Taylor's widow's security. She subsequently married Philip Durell (1707&#150;1766), port admiral of Plymouth, and after his death she married, in 1769, Sir Frederick Rogers, fourth baronet. Her will, written on 22 February 1803, was proved on 7 July of that year.<br>
