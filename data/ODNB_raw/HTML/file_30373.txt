<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Alexander,  William</span>  (1824&#150;1911), <span class="occ">archbishop of Armagh</span>, was born in Derry on 13 April 1824. His father, Robert Alexander, rector of Termoneeney, Derry, at the time, later to be prebendary of Aghadowey, Derry, was a nephew of Nathanael Alexander, bishop of Meath, and great-nephew of James Alexander, first earl of Caledon. His mother was Dorothea, daughter of Henry McClintock of Ballyarton, co. Londonderry. William was the eldest son in a family of three boys: Henry rose to the rank of rear-admiral and Robert, a soldier, was killed at the siege of Delhi.<br>
<br>William was educated at Tonbridge School, Kent, winning an exhibition to Exeter College, Oxford, where he matriculated on 19 November 1841, graduating (fourth class) in classical honours in 1847. He left Oxford for a time, returning to New Hall and thence to Brasenose College, from which he took the degree of BA in 1854. He distinguished himself by winning the Denyer prize for an essay on the divinity of Christ (1850), and in 1853 received an award for his congratulatory ode to Lord Derby, the new chancellor. His poem &#145;The Waters of Babylon&#146; received the university prize in 1860, and in 1867 he was a candidate for the professorship of poetry, being narrowly defeated by Sir Francis H. Doyle. In 1867, on his preferment to the episcopate, Oxford awarded him the degree of DD, followed by an honorary DLitt in 1907, the year in which he was elected an honorary fellow of Brasenose. He had already been conferred with an honorary LLD by Dublin.<br>
<br>Alexander was ordained deacon in 1847 for the curacy of Templemore, Derry Cathedral, where he served until 1850, having been ordained priest in 1848. From 1850 to 1855 he was rector of Termonamongan, co. Tyrone, becoming rector of Upper Fahan (then in the diocese of Derry) in 1850. From 1855 to 1860 he served as rector of Fahan and from 1860 as rector of Camus-juxta-Mourne until his appointment to the see of Derry in 1867. He held the sinecure of dean of Emly from 1864. In 1896 he was translated to the see of Armagh. On 15 October 1850 he married Cecil Frances, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Humphreys [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/328/', "Alexander, Cecil Frances")</script>], the hymn writer; they had two sons and two daughters. Mrs Alexander died on 12 October 1895.<br>
<br>Much in demand as preacher and lecturer, in both Britain and America (where he carried out a speaking tour in 1891 in aid of Derry Cathedral), Alexander was select preacher at Oxford on four occasions, twice at Cambridge and once at Dublin. His Bampton lectures appeared in a third edition in 1898, and his published works also included two books of verse: <span class="italic">Specimens</span> (1867), privately circulated as part of his canvass for the Oxford chair of poetry, and <span class="italic">St Augustine's Confessions and other Pieces</span> (1886). He was capable of some telling phrases, for instance attributing to Swift the capacity to &#145;carve out a tumour in alabaster&#146; and &#145;enshrine putrescence under a crystal case&#146;. Yet neither his poetry nor his theological writing has stood the test of time, though as an orator he made significant contributions to several important contemporary debates.<br>
<br>Alexander's Tractarian outlook, dating from his undergraduate years at Oxford, made him suspect in some Church of Ireland quarters. He took a minority position as a member of the court of the general synod when the court found against the vicar of St Bartholomew's, Dublin, in a case related to an alleged infringement of the canons of the Church of Ireland. His proposals for a diocesan conference in Derry in 1890, when the Revd R. R. Dolling was to be a speaker, caused such a furore that the occasion had to be cancelled.<br>
<br>Yet Alexander's churchmanship would in a later era be generally regarded as having stood the Church of Ireland in good stead. Forcefully, yet with tact, he argued for the integrity of Anglican formularies at a time when attempts were made from within the newly disestablished church radically to revise the <span class="roman">Book of Common Prayer</span>. A contemporary wrote of &#145;the impassioned rhetoric of the great poet-preacher, with the innate witchery of his superb voice&#146;.<br>
<br>Alexander was very much in tune with Church of Ireland opinion when he contributed with equal skill, but less success, to two other, and perhaps more important, debates. Disestablishment was abhorrent to him and he spoke vigorously against it in the House of Lords. &#145;You are condemning the Irish Church of the last century because it did not act upon principles not then recognised.&#146; He also pointed out, with some justification, that since the <span class="roman">Act of Union</span> had joined the established churches of England and Ireland &#145;for ever&#146;, the government disestablishment bill struck at a fundamental condition of the union of the two kingdoms. He made an impassioned speech against home rule for Ireland in the Albert Hall, London, in 1893, regarding the proposal with grave apprehension so far as the future of the Church of Ireland was concerned.<br>
<br>Though a high-churchman Alexander was not insensitive to the feelings of other churches. He deprecated it when terms such as &#145;apostolic succession&#146; were used in such a way as to cause offence, and he maintained cordial relations with Cardinal Logue, the Roman Catholic primate.<br>
<br>Archbishop Alexander resigned from his see on 30 January 1911, and lived in Torquay, Devon, until his death at his home, Belton Lodge, Torquay, on 12 September of that year. He was buried on 16 September 1911, beside his wife, in the churchyard of Derry Cathedral. The Synod Hall in Armagh is dedicated in his memory.<br>
