<span class="headword">Colville,  John</span>  (1542?&#150;1605), <span class="occ">conspirator and Church of Scotland minister</span>, was born in Scotland, the second son of Robert Colville of Cleish (<i>d</i>. 1560) and Francesca (<i>d</i>. 1591), daughter of Patrick Colquhoun of Drumskeath. He was educated at St Leonard's College, University of St Andrews, where he graduated MA, probably in 1561. He was probably then aged about nineteen. He entered the ministry and by 1567 held the parsonage and vicarage of Kilbride in Clydesdale. Two years later he was confirmed as chantor (precentor) of Glasgow, while in 1571, as representative of the archdeacon of Teviotdale, he took part in the election of a new archbishop there. In 1574 Colville was recorded as minister of the united parishes of Kilbride, Torrens, Carmunnock, and Eaglesham, where his stipend extended to &pound;200 (from which he had to pay for readers in each of his parishes). Frequent complaints were made about him in general assembly, and from 1575 to 1579 he was periodically exhibited for non-residence and neglect of his parishes. In 1580 it was stated that &#145;he was presently at the point of excommunication&#146;  (Thomson, <span class="italic">Acts and Proceedings</span>, 451) and by 1584 he had been removed from the chantory of Glasgow.<br>
<br>Colville simultaneously developed interests outside the church: in 1572 he married Janet Russell, with whom he had at least three sons and two daughters; he maintained a household at Stirling and lands (held of his cousin James Colville of Easter Wemyss) at Strathrudie in Fife; in November 1578 he was appointed master of requests for life with an annual pension of &pound;200 (his father had been master of the household for James Stewart, later Regent Moray); and in March 1581 he was described as &#145;pedagogue to the Earl of Mar&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP Scot.</span>, 5.649). Although he was frequently employed on royal business, he was one of the most consistent suppliers of information to Queen Elizabeth's government concerning the political affairs of Scotland during the last quarter of the sixteenth century.<br>
<br>Following the arrest of James Douglas, fourth earl of Morton, in December 1580, Colville attached himself to the discontented protestant faction. He was stripped of his office of requests in March 1581&#151;it was claimed he had obtained it &#145;sinisterlie and surreptitiouslie&#146;  (Livingstone and others, 8.31)&#151;and subsequently took part in the Ruthven raid in August 1582. A manifesto issued in vindication of that enterprise (published as <span class="italic">Ane declaration of the just and necessar caussis moving us of the nobilities of Scotland, and utheris, the kings majesties faithful subjectis to repair to his hienes presence and to remane with his etc, directit from Striviling, anno 1582</span>) is normally attributed to him. When James VI removed himself from the control of the Ruthven regime in July 1583, Colville obtained licence to pass overseas for three years (except to England or Ireland). Ignoring his licence, he retired to England and was consequently forfeited in parliament, whereupon his offices were again declared vacant. After the earl of Arran had been driven from court in November 1585, Colville returned to Scotland in the company of Lord John Hamilton and was pardoned. Restored to royal favour he resumed the style chantor of Glasgow, and instructions were issued for the payment of the arrears of his pension as master of requests; this was a relief to Colville, who constantly was short of funds (and was stated to have been owed 5400 merks by James and the state). On 2 June 1587 he was admitted as a senator of the college of justice in place of his uncle, Alexander Colville, commendator of Culross (fulfilling a royal promise made in November 1582). However, after less than three weeks he resigned his seat in Alexander's favour. Also in 1587 Colville attended parliament as commissioner for the burgh of Stirling and was employed as collector of the taxation granted to James for his forthcoming marriage. He also accepted a number of pension payments from England on behalf of James VI. Despite all these offices and responsibilities, Colville was still owed money by James in the early 1590s.<br>
<br>On 27 December 1591, in the company of Francis Stewart, first earl of Bothwell, Colville attacked Holyrood Palace with the intention of seizing Chancellor Maitland, whom he hated. Colville had been involved in the earl's affairs since at least 1584, and in June 1592 was forfeited in parliament for this association. Undeterred, he attended Bothwell on the latter's raid against Falkland Palace at the end of June, and at some point composed a sympathetic tract, <span class="italic">De causa Comitis Bothwellii</span> (now lost). On 24 July 1593, however, Colville accompanied Bothwell to Holyrood Palace where both fell on their knees and craved pardon for their offences before the king. Despite a brief return to favour, on 11 December in the same year the two men were declared outlaws. Colville led one of the earl's divisions of horse against royal forces at the so-called raid of Leith in early April 1594, but later in the year severed connections with the earl when Bothwell allied himself with the Catholic faction. On 13 September Mar purchased a pardon from the king for Colville, who by 4 December had &#145;laid open as much as he knows of the manner of the carriage of all matters with Bothwell&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP Scot.</span>, 11.492). Still trusted by his former allies, in February 1595 Colville assured Bothwell's natural brother, Hercules Stewart, of his life, but on meeting with him betrayed Hercules to the government authorities and to execution. This action secured him greater royal favour, but discredited him in the eyes of his countrymen, and he had to seek sanctuary in Holyrood Abbey after Bothwell threatened to kill him.<br>
<br>With his sponsor Mar, Colville looked to benefit from the death of Chancellor Maitland in 1595: it was hoped that he might become secretary (a position he had held briefly upon his recovery of favour in autumn 1593) or at least keeper of the great seal. These plans came to nothing, and in July 1597 Colville was in the Netherlands &#145;with his Majesties good liking, under his hand and Great Seall for his lawfull affairs&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP Scot.</span>, 13.54). James's pleasure cooled a year later, when he found out that Colville was still deep in correspondence with England and had even &#145;kissed hands&#146; with Elizabeth. An angry king alleged that any licence Colville possessed had been stolen. Whether Colville ever revisited Scotland is uncertain. In 1599 he was in London in a state of destitution, offering his services in vain to Robert Cecil. Leaving his wife in England, he withdrew to France and arrived at Paris in February 1600. During his continental exile Colville was reconciled to Bothwell and like him renounced protestantism. With a view to inducing his countrymen to follow his example, he wrote his <span class="italic">Paraenesis ad ministros Scotos super sua conversione</span> (1602). He also made a pilgrimage to Rome. Two years earlier he had published his <span class="italic">Palinode</span>, which he represented as a refutation of a former work of his own attacking James's title to the English crown. His previous argument that James was a bastard had much offended the king. He now caused a copy of his recantation to be forwarded to King James, who received it with great satisfaction. It was reissued in 1604. Spottiswoode, however, asserts that Colville was not the author. Colville wrote several other political works and has traditionally been cited as the most likely author of the <span class="italic">Historie of King James the Sext</span>. This attribution is now considered uncertain and open to doubt. There has also been some doubt over his death: although it was formerly claimed that he died while on pilgrimage to Rome in 1607, it is now accepted that he died in Paris in November 1605.<br>
