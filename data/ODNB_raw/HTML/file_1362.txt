<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Bardsley, Sir  James Lomax</span>  (1801&#150;1876), <span class="occ">physician</span>, the son of Edward and Elizabeth Bardsley, was born at George Street, Nottingham, on 7 July 1801. He studied medicine in Glasgow and Edinburgh, and at St Bartholomew's Hospital, London, where he was taught by the surgeon John Abernethy, who became a firm friend. He also spent some months studying in Paris. Bardsley graduated MD (Edinburgh) in 1823 with a thesis on rabies. Later that year he was elected honorary physician to the Manchester Royal Infirmary, following the resignation of his uncle, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1363/', "Samuel Argent Bardsley (1764&#150;1850)")</script>, who had been honorary physician there since 1790.<br>
<br>James Lomax Bardsley, then only twenty-two years old, became the youngest man ever appointed to the honorary staff of the Manchester Royal Infirmary. From 1824 he became associated with Thomas Turner, who established the Pine Street school of medicine in Manchester. He lectured there on the principles and practice of physic, materia medica, and medical botany. These lectures, together with his <span class="italic">Hospital Facts and Observations</span> (1830), demonstrated the breadth of Bardsley's professional expertise and sound common sense. He also wrote articles on diabetes and hydrophobia for the <span class="italic">Cyclopaedia of Practical Medicine</span> (1833).<br>
<br>Bardsley was essentially a practical man concerned particularly to advance the professional standing of rank-and-file doctors. He was active in establishing the Provincial Medical and Surgical Association (PMSA) in 1832, and five years later he gave a &#145;Retrospective address&#146; at its annual meeting in Cheltenham. He remained committed throughout his life to the PMSA, which later became the British Medical Association. He left a legacy of &pound;500 to its benevolent fund. He was president of the Manchester Medical Society in 1838, and from 1845 until 1848. He was also president of the Medico-Ethical Association in 1850, and president of the Manchester Institute for Diseases of the Ear.<br>
<br>In 1831 Bardsley married Elizabeth Shuttleworth, widow of R. H. Shuttleworth. Although he retained consulting rooms in his house in Chatham Street, which he had taken over from his uncle, the couple went to live in a large house at Greenheys, Manchester.<br>
<br>By the 1840s Bardsley had built up a large professional practice. In 1843 he resigned as honorary physician to the infirmary and was appointed consulting physician. He was deputy lieutenant for Lancashire and a justice of the peace. In 1853 his considerable reputation was recognized by the conferment of a knighthood. Bardsley was the first Manchester physician to receive such an honour.<br>
<br>Bardsley suffered from heart disease in the later years of his life, and he gradually reduced his professional work. He died on 10 July 1876 at his house, The Orchards, Greenheys, Manchester.<br>
