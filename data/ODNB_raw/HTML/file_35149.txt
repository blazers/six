<span class="headword">Munro,  Hector Hugh</span> <span class="st"> [<em>pseud. </em>Saki]</span>  (1870&#150;1916), <span class="occ">short-story writer</span>, was born on 18 December 1870 in Akyab, Burma, the youngest of the three children of Colonel Charles Augustus Munro (1844&#150;1907), inspector-general of police in Burma, and Mary Frances Mercer (<i>d</i>. 1872). He was proud to belong to the ancient clan Munro. Owing to the death of his mother and his father's absence abroad he was brought up with his brother and sister by two aunts in the village of Pilton, near Barnstaple, Devon. The aunts' stern, unsympathetic methods and the children's resentment are reflected in some of Munro's most memorable stories, in which dictatorial aunts are worsted by their charges. He was educated at a preparatory school in Exmouth and for four terms at Bedford grammar school (later known as Bedford School), until in 1887 Colonel Munro returned from Burma and took the children on extensive continental travels. In 1893 Munro joined the Burma police, but malaria brought him home fifteen months later. After recuperating in Devon he decided to earn his living as a writer in London.<br>
<br>Munro's first book, <span class="italic">The Rise of the Russian Empire</span> (1900), cost him much labour but it was a false start, although Russia always fascinated him. When Francis Carruthers Gould introduced him to the <span class="italic">Westminster Gazette</span> in 1900 Munro began contributing brief political satires, signing himself Saki, the name of the &#145;cypress-slender Minister of Wine&#146; in the <span class="italic">Rub&aacute;iy&aacute;t of Omar Khayy&aacute;m</span>. In 1901 the <span class="italic">Westminster</span> published the first of his short stories about an exquisite young man named Reginald; these were later published in book form as <span class="italic">Reginald</span> (1904).<br>
<br>Munro went to the Balkans as special correspondent for the <span class="italic">Morning Post</span> in 1902, then to Warsaw, St Petersburg (where he witnessed the 1905 massacre), and Paris. His dispatches show his right-wing convictions, criticizing inefficiency and unnecessary repression, but respecting strong government. He returned to London in 1908, taking a flat at 97 Mortimer Street, Cavendish Square. Handsome and impeccably dressed, with a slightly crooked smile that rarely became a laugh, he seems to have moved on the fringes of polite society with few, if any, intimate friends. Some people knew he was homosexual, with many young contacts, but that side of his life had to be secret.<br>
<br>By 1909 Munro had begun writing the short stories which were to make his reputation. Originally published in the <span class="italic">Westminster</span> and from 1911 in the <span class="italic">Morning Post</span> and elsewhere in the tory press, the stories were collected as <span class="italic">The Chronicles of Clovis</span> (1911), <span class="italic">Beasts and Super-Beasts</span> (1914), <span class="italic">The Toys of Peace</span> (1919), and <span class="italic">The Square Egg</span> (1924). Original though his best work is, its line of descent is clear: his epigrammatic style and witty, amoral young men such as Clovis Sangrail derive from Oscar Wilde, his fantastical humour owes much to Lewis Carroll, and some of his grimmer stories, like his politics, put him close to Kipling. In his turn he influenced comic writers of the next generation such as A. A. Milne, No&euml;l Coward, and P. G. Wodehouse.<br>
<br>His methods were simple but ingenious. Characters are defined with a bizarre name and a deft phrase or two, the wit depends on perfect wording and unexpected turns, and the action is often some kind of practical joke, aimed at deflating pretension or exposing cowardice. Many of the stories bring animals into formerly placid households: a leopard in the bedroom, a wolf at a dinner party, a boar in the orchard. Occasionally the forces of wild nature are embodied in what Munro may have thought of as their truest image, a naked boy, beautiful and cruel.<br>
<br>In some ways Munro remained a boy himself, delighting in practical jokes and exotic animals, and scornful of the regulated adult world. Religion struck him as absurd. With his knowledge of less orderly places, he saw respectable English life as fragile and anaemic. The compression demanded by a newspaper column exactly suited the ruthless precision of his satire and the limitations of his talent. In his few long works the lack of mature human sympathy which runs throughout his writing is revealed as a real deficiency, wonderfully funny though its effects can be when confined to a few pages. He wrote two novels, <span class="italic">The Unbearable Bassington</span> (1912), the story of a wayward young man whose eventual exile may be the author's comment on his own isolation, and <span class="italic">When William Came</span> (1913), a portrait of England shamefully giving way to a German invasion (William being the Kaiser).<br>
<br>Munro enlisted in the ranks in August 1914 despite his age, first joining King Edward's Horse but soon transferring to the 22nd Royal Fusiliers. The contempt for pacifists and shirkers expressed in his wartime articles has been seen, inaccurately, as a betrayal of his earlier self, as though he had turned against drones such as Clovis, but Clovis would surely have enlisted too, enjoying patrolling in no man's land just as his creator did, imagining himself to be a wolf hunting fat farmers' wives. Like many others Munro welcomed the war as the return of honour to a society which had become hypocritical and weak-willed. He refused a commission, preferring to serve as corporal and eventually lance sergeant, faultlessly courageous and efficient. His malaria recurred in November 1916, but he discharged himself from hospital on the 11th when he heard an offensive was due. The battle of the Ancre began on the 13th. Munro was killed by a sniper's bullet the next day during the final assault on Beaumont Hamel. He is listed on the Thiepval memorial as one of the many soldiers whose bodies were never found.<br>
