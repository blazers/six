<span class="headword">Hicks,  Henry</span>  (1837&#150;1899), <span class="occ">geologist and alienist</span>, was born at St David's, Pembrokeshire, on 26 May 1837, the son of Thomas Hicks (<i>b</i>. 1807), surgeon, and Anne (<i>d</i>. 1884), daughter of William Griffiths of Carmarthen. He was educated at the cathedral chapter school at St David's and at Guy's Hospital, where he became MRCS (in 1862) and an Apothecaries' licentiate. (He also took an MD from St Andrews in 1878.) He began practice at St David's and on 2 February 1864 married Mary, daughter of P. D. Richardson, vicar of St Dogwell's. In 1871 he moved to Hendon as a general practitioner, but subsequently began to specialize in psychiatric medicine and opened a clinic for female patients, eventually transferring to spacious premises at Hendon Grove.<br>
<br>In the 1860s Hicks undertook the care of the palaeontologist John Salter, who had resigned from the geological survey under a cloud with incipient mental illness. Hicks and his patient found a common interest in geology and collaborated in several investigations in Pembrokeshire. Important finds of Lower Palaeozoic fossils were made, and Hicks and Salter began to establish the idea of there also being Precambrian rocks at St David's which had once formed an island in a Cambrian sea and around which the Cambrian strata had been deposited. This idea was developed with claims of Precambrians in the Malvern hills, north Wales, and elsewhere.<br>
<br>Hicks was a follower to some extent of the ideas of &#145;chemical geology&#146; of the North American geologist T. S. Hunt, according to which one might, from chemical principles, deduce a series of chemical processes occurring in the earth's early oceans which had led to the formation of strata in a determinate sequence. Such ideas were poorly received in Britain, and Hicks found himself at odds with the scientific establishment in the persons of Andrew Ramsay and Archibald Geikie concerning the rocks of St David's, and specifically whether the crystalline rocks of Salter's Precambrian &#145;island&#146; were or were not intrusive. In this controversy, Hicks's opponents accused him of invoking faults too readily to account for his field observations, and he was also charged with making correlations between distant rocks on the basis of insufficient lithological resemblances.<br>
<br>Besides doing much work on the Lower Palaeozoic rocks of south Wales, with numerous fossil finds, especially near Llanfirn farm, Abereiddi Bay (today the type area for the &#145;Llanvirnian&#146; division of the Ordovician), Hicks divided the claimed Precambrian rocks of Pembrokeshire into three lithological units, &#145;Dimetian&#146;, &#145;Pebidian&#146;, and &#145;Arvonian&#146;, which could also be recognized in north Wales; however, this threefold division had few supporters. With his interest in Precambrian rocks, Hicks also participated in the so-called highlands controversy, concerned with the age and structure of the rocks of the north-west highlands of Scotland. It was Hicks who, in 1878, reopened the question, which had been settled in favour of the views of the survey officers Roderick Murchison and Archibald Geikie, developed in the 1860s. Though Hicks did not solve the structural problem successfully, his role in the debate was undoubtedly significant.<br>
<br>Hicks also wrote on Pleistocene geology, in which he became interested when mammalian remains were discovered in the valley below his house in Hendon. Following excavations in cave deposits in north Wales, he concluded that there was evidence of preglacial humans in that part of the world. This suggestion, like many of his other ideas, quickly involved him in controversy. His other main research interest had to do with the so-called &#145;Morte Slates&#146;, near Ilfracombe. He visited this area in 1890, discovering fragmentary fossils, which he took to be Silurian. His suggestion&#151;which has not been accepted subsequently, the rocks being regarded as Upper Devonian&#151;was that the rocks had been emplaced by thrusting into younger strata. However, his work on the area was incomplete at the time of his death.<br>
<br>One of the best-known amateur geologists of his day, Hicks was renowned for his skill at finding fossils and his forceful expression of controversial views. He was secretary of the Geological Society in 1890&#150;93 and president in 1896&#150;8, having been awarded the society's Bigsby medal in 1883. He was president of the Geologists' Association in 1883&#150;5 and was elected FRS in 1885. Besides his geological and medical work, Hicks involved himself in sanitary and educational matters, in church affairs, and in Conservative Party organization. He died unexpectedly of heart disease at Hatchcroft House, Hendon, on 18 November 1899, being survived by his widow and three daughters.<br>
