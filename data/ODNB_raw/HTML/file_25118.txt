<span class="headword">Seton, Sir  Christopher</span>  (<em>c.</em>1278&#150;1306), <span class="occ">landowner</span>, seems to have been of a family which took its name from Seton in Cleveland, North Riding of Yorkshire, and served the senior Brus family there until the male line failed in 1272. He was not related to the Setons of Lothian. His father, Sir John of Seton, died in 1299, before 7 July, when Christopher, said to be twenty-one, inherited Yorkshire lands and property in Cumberland bought by his father from a coheir of Richard Levington. Robert (V) de Brus (<i>d</i>. 1295) also acquired an active interest in Cumberland through his second marriage, to Christina of Ireby, between 1270 and 1275, and Sir John, who was described as Brus's knight in 1285, had demised lands there to Robert and Christina; these reverted to Christopher on Christina's death in 1305. Sir John was with Robert (VI) de Brus (<i>d</i>. 1304) in the king's service in Galloway in July 1296. Thus Seton had served Brus long before the marriage of Christopher to <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/60019/', "Christian Bruce (d. 1356)")</script>, daughter of Robert (VI) de Brus and sister of Robert Bruce, a marriage which had taken place by 1305. A simple explanation may be found in Christopher's service under John de Botetourt in the garrison of Lochmaben at least from April 1303 to March 1304, when he could have been thrown into the lady's company.<br>
<br>In February 1306 Seton faced a critical challenge. He and his younger brothers, Sir John Seton, who had served Edward I in Scotland in 1301, and Humphrey, were present at the murder of John Comyn in Dumfries after Robert Bruce had wounded him. The whole family was compromised and threw in its lot with Bruce, soon to be king. Christopher was left in charge of the Brus castle of Loch Doon, a modest stone octagon on a loch island in Ayrshire, while John was given command of Richard Siward's castle of Tibbers, which Bruce had seized; Christian stayed with her brother and was taken prisoner at Tain, Ross-shire, in 1306. Loch Doon and Tibbers held out even after that disastrous defeat. Loch Doon was besieged in early August and had fallen by the 16th, Tibbers perhaps a little later. Both brothers were quickly executed on Edward I's orders. Later Robert I endowed a chapel at Dumfries for Christopher's soul; evidently he was gibbeted there. He left no children.<br>
