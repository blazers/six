<span class="headword">McArthur, Sir  William</span>  (1809&#150;1887), <span class="occ">woollen merchant and politician</span>, was born at Malin, Donegal, Ireland, on 6 July 1809, the fifth child and second son of John McArthur (<i>d</i>. 1840) and Sarah, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Finlay (<i>d</i>. 1861). His father was a poor Scots-Irish farmer who had converted to Methodism in the 1790s and turned to itinerant preaching in the &#145;linen triangle&#146; of Ulster. William attended schools in Stranorlar and Newtownstewart, but at the age of twelve he was sent away from home to be apprenticed to a Methodist woollen draper in Enniskillen. Subsequently he worked as a clerk for a Methodist tobacco and spirit merchant in Lurgan, and briefly as a travelling agent for a Dublin woollen draper, before he and a partner of about his own age set up a woollens export business in Londonderry in 1831. The firm prospered and acquired new suppliers in the north of England, and when his partner, John Cather, emigrated to Canada in 1835 McArthur assumed control.<br>
<br>A modest if solid provincial enterprise was transformed into a major commercial house in consequence of a visit made to New South Wales in 1841 by one of McArthur's younger brothers. By the late 1840s Alexander McArthur (1814&#150;1909) had established branches of the firm in Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide, and Auckland, to deal in McArthur textiles and Australasian exports. When the &#145;gold rush&#146; happened in 1851 McArthur Brothers was well placed to profit enormously from both the great demand for durable woollens and from the high profits to be made in gold exporting. Australian success led the firm to open a London office in 1854. Three years later William McArthur himself moved to London and subsequently became a City figure of great wealth and some influence. By the mid-1860s the two brothers (Alexander moved to London in 1863) had extended their activity into banking and insurance, and they sat on the boards of a number of other firms dealing in colonial and foreign investments.<br>
<br>McArthur had deferred matrimony until his business was soundly established, and in 1843 he married Marianne (1819?&#150;1889), the only child of Archibald McElwaine, an Ulster businessman and a Methodist. They had no children and from the 1850s Marianne was a semi-invalid; for reasons of health she often lived apart from her husband.<br>
<br>McArthur was elected to the Londonderry town council in 1841 as a Conservative, though his politics were more Methodist Connexional than tory partisan. When he moved toward the Liberals in the 1850s, he was driven in large measure by the protestant issues of sectarian education and anti-Catholicism. It was not until 1865, however, that he became interested in a parliamentary seat. By this time he was well established in the City of London, had become a prominent benefactor of Methodist educational and charitable institutions, and lived in a south London suburb, Brixton Hill, among a community of wealthy nonconformist professionals and businessmen like himself. Following an invitation from the Methodists of the West Riding borough of Pontefract, McArthur contested the seat as a moderate Liberal but was narrowly defeated. He subsequently took a larger role in City affairs, served a term as sheriff for London and Middlesex in 1867, hired a political agent, and stood successfully in 1868 for the south London (Surrey) borough of Lambeth. He held this constituency, which included his own residence in Brixton Hill, until 1885, though with increasing challenge from the radical wing of metropolitan Liberalism.<br>
<br>Although many of McArthur's philanthropic and evangelical interests cut across partisan lines in the House of Commons, he was, like the other Methodist MPs, a generally loyal Gladstonian, and embraced most of the domestic reforms of the first and second Gladstone governments. As one of the most prominent (and wealthy) Methodist laymen of the time, he was not merely a spokesman for Connexion in parliament but played a considerable role in shaping the Methodist political agenda. For McArthur, the most compelling item on this agenda was the furtherance of Methodist missionary enterprise, especially in the south Pacific. Here he was strongly influenced by his brother Alexander and his Australian Methodist friends and relatives.<br>
<br>McArthur's persistent campaign in parliament and at Whitehall in the early 1870s for the annexation of the Fiji Islands, where there was a well-developed Methodist missionary presence, was vigorously resisted by Gladstone, but it ultimately triumphed when Disraeli's government accepted the sovereignty of the islands in 1874. Earlier McArthur had helped to promote, as did many nonconformist Liberals, causes which were often critical of colonial administration (the British and Foreign Anti-Slave Society, the Aborigines Protection Society, the Anglo-Oriental Society for Suppression of the Opium Trade, and J. S. Mill's Jamaica Committee to prosecute Governor Eyre). The Fiji success, however, and the alliances he made in achieving it, encouraged in McArthur an enthusiasm for the empire (in 1884 he was ardent in his support for W. E. Forster's Imperial Federation League), and helped to widen the rift between McArthur and Liberal radicalism in his later years.<br>
<br>McArthur was elected alderman for the Coleman Street ward of the City in 1872, and he served on committees concerned with sewerage, the police, gas and water, and various charities, and lent his name and resources to a number of civic and philanthropic organizations. He was a founding member of the London chamber of commerce in 1881, and he supported the campaigns of the Metropolitan Free Bridges Association and the Public Museums and Free Libraries Association. In his mind civic reform was inextricably tied to moral reform, a conviction reflected in his support for the Central Association for Stopping the Sale of Intoxicating Liquors on Sundays and the National Association for Repeal of the Contagious Diseases Acts. Primacy of place was, however, always reserved for explicitly Methodist demands on his time and money: the Wesleyan Methodist Missionary Society, the Methodist Chapel Building Fund, and the Methodist college at Belfast. From 1872 until his death he was a lay representative to both the English and Irish Wesleyan conferences.<br>
<br>McArthur's turn as lord mayor of London came in 1880, and the pious tone he set at Mansion House&#151;no wine, card playing, or dancing, and prayer meetings for the Evangelical Alliance&#151;drew sarcastic comment from some quarters about his parvenu religiosity and lack of sophistication. After the end of his year in office Gladstone created him KCMG (an award commonly associated with colonial service), rather than bestow the baronetcy which many former lord mayors received, an apparent slight which McArthur and his friends resented.<br>
<br>McArthur had relished the robes of office, which he wore to chapel services in Brixton, and the dignity of his position, feeling that they honoured, through him, both provincial nonconformity and self-made men of commerce. He added a considerable amount of aldermanic flesh to his large frame, and a growing sense of his importance in the City and in the Wesleyan community led him to take a large, elegant house at 79 Holland Park, appropriate to the style of the merchant prince he considered himself to be. However, his removal to west London, the grandness of his style, his foreign travel, his increasing absence from the House of Commons, and his lack of interest in the &#145;low&#146; radicalism of the left of the Liberal Party made McArthur vulnerable in Lambeth. Although he endorsed land reform and extension of the franchise, there were limits to his ability to accommodate the radical programme, and his failure in 1883 to vote for the <span class="roman">Affirmation Bill</span> which would have allowed the atheist Charles Bradlaugh to take his seat in the Commons resulted in a deputation from his constituents demanding that he resign his seat. McArthur&#151;heavy, elderly, and never a very confident orator&#151;saw a parliamentary seat as a reward rather than a battleground, and, rather than struggle against a coming generation in a large, demanding metropolitan constituency, he chose not to contest Lambeth in the general election of 1885. Nonconformists in the newly created east Kent district of Newington West invited him to stand, but here too there was a radical challenge which split the Liberal vote and gave the seat to a tory&#151;with McArthur trailing a distant third.<br>
<br>The humiliation of his loss embittered McArthur in his last years. Like his prot&eacute;g&eacute; Hugh Price Hughes he abandoned Gladstone over home rule, and he turned to the satisfying and complicated business of arranging and rearranging the many charitable legacies in his will. McArthur remained in robust health until his sudden death from heart failure on 16 November 1887, <i>en route</i> on the London Underground to a City board meeting. Survived by his wife and also by his brother Alexander, McArthur was buried at Norwood cemetery. He left a considerable fortune, amounting almost to &pound;0.5 million, more than &pound;150,000 of which was left to Methodist charities.<br>
<br>Rising from an obscure apprenticeship to dignity, honour, and a mercantile fortune, McArthur's life fitted the pattern described by Samuel Smiles. He attributed his success to simple virtues, inscribing his stationery with the motto <i>Fide et opera</i>. The recognized spokesman for the Wesleyan Methodist laity, an avid promoter of missionary imperialism, and a minor pillar of nonconformist support for Gladstonian Liberalism, McArthur remained a confirmed back-bencher, alternately useful and embarrassing to the Liberal leadership. He was a great man to many of his Methodist contemporaries, but in London, in the larger world, regard for his money was inevitably tempered by condescension. McArthur's girth and broad, coarse features belied his character, which was not particularly expansive or gregarious. His strict evangelical and sectarian approach to all aspects of his public and commercial life&#151;the very means by which he struggled out of a narrow Ulster poverty&#151;also worked to prevent him from developing larger sympathies with either the world of high politics or that of his working-class constituents, and so limited the influence which his wealth might have commanded.<br>
