<span class="headword">Massey,  William Nathaniel</span>  (1809&#150;1881), <span class="occ">politician and historian</span>, son of William Massey, was a distant member of the Clarina family. He was called to the bar in 1844, and became recorder of Portsmouth in 1852 and of Plymouth in 1855. In the same year he was returned to parliament in the Liberal interest as member for Newport in the Isle of Wight, which he represented until 1857, when the moderate Liberal Party in Manchester invited Robert Lowe to oppose T. Milner-Gibson and John Bright in that city and extended a similar invitation to Massey to contest Salford against Sir Elkanah Armitage. Massey, wiser than Lowe, responded to the summons, and won the seat with an ease astonishing to all who were not acquainted with the personal unpopularity of his opponent.<br>
<br>Massey was under-secretary in the Home Office from August 1855 to March 1858, and, though opposing Russell's <span class="roman">Reform Bill</span> in 1860, was chairman of ways and means and deputy speaker from 1859 to 1865. He continued to sit for Salford until 1863, when he succeeded Samuel Laing as financial member of the government of India, a position which he held until 1868, when he unsuccessfully contested Liverpool. Massey possessed high qualifications for this important post, but his efficiency in it, as well as in the chair of the house in committee, was thought to be impaired by his indolence. He was sworn a privy councillor on his return to England, was elected for Tiverton in 1872, and sat until his death, but took no prominent part in politics, and did not again hold office. He married first, in 1833, Frances Carleton (<i>d</i>. 1872), daughter of the Revd John Orde, and second, in 1880, Helen Henrietta, the youngest daughter of Patrick Grant, sheriff-clerk of Inverness-shire. Massey had at least one child, Charles Carleton, probably from his first marriage.<br>
<br>Massey was a devoted follower of Palmerston, and both by conviction and temperament averse to political innovation. He was personally popular both in the house and among his constituents; his abilities were considerable, his legal and financial knowledge extensive, but he lacked energy and ambition. He published an essay on legal reform, <span class="italic">Common Sense versus Common Law</span> (1850), but his only important literary performance is an unfinished history of the reign of George III until the Peace of Amiens (4 vols., 1855&#150;63). In writing this book he had the assistance of the extensive materials collected by E. H. Locker for his intended biography of George II; Massey's style is lucid, and his general treatment of the subject sensible and impartial, but his work is devoid of all distinctive characteristics, and exhibits the qualities neither of a picturesque nor of a philosophic historian.<br>
<br>Massey died at his home, 71 Chester Square, London, on 25 October 1881 and was buried at Kensal Green cemetery.<br>
