<span class="headword">Beatrice, Princess</span> <span class="st"> [<em>married name </em>Princess Henry of Battenberg]</span>  (1857&#150;1944), <span class="occ"></span>the fifth daughter and youngest child of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36652/', "Queen Victoria")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/274/', "Prince Albert")</script>, was born Beatrice Mary Victoria Feodore at Buckingham Palace on 14 April 1857. Unlike her elder brothers and sisters, she was treated with indulgence by her parents and in her infancy was a lively child. After Albert's death, Queen Victoria found solace in her daughter, being over-protective of her &#145;Baby&#146; until she was well into adult life. The princess was never the play-friend or confidante of any of her brothers or sisters, for the poor health of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/16475/', "Leopold")</script>, the closest to her in age, ruled out normal childish play and, deprived of the companionship of other children, she grew up shy and reserved. She was, at maturity, an attractive and well-educated young woman of some musical ability. It appeared, however, that her role was to be &#145;the prop, comfort and companion of her widowed mother to old age&#146;  (Rose, 30). Such was the queen's reliance on her daughter that it seemed unlikely that she would ever marry. Queen Victoria was, however, sympathetic to Beatrice's fondness for the prince imperial (killed in the Anglo-Zulu War in 1879) and promoted the idea of marriage to the grand duke of Hesse and by Rhine, the widower of Beatrice's sister, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/347/', "Alice")</script>. In 1884 Princess Beatrice attended the wedding of her niece, Victoria Alice of Hesse, to Prince Louis of Battenberg (later Mountbatten) and, on her return, told the queen that she wished to marry Prince Louis's brother.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_12965"></a><span class="headword">Prince Henry Maurice of Battenberg</span>  (1858&#150;1896)<span class="occ"></span>, born at Milan on 5 October 1858, was the third son of the morganatic marriage between Prince Alexander of Hesse (1823&#150;1888) and Countess Julie von Haucke (1825&#150;1895), who was granted, in 1858, the title of princess of Battenberg. Queen Victoria at first declared that the match &#145;would never do&#146;, but her main concern was to keep her daughter by her side and she did not share the general horror of continental royalty for a pedigree impaired by a morganatic marriage. She gave her consent on condition that Prince Henry (&#145;Liko&#146;) resigned his commission in the Prussian army and that the couple made their home with her. The marriage took place at Whippingham church, near Osborne, on the Isle of Wight, on 23 July 1885.<br>
<br>Queen Victoria was fond of Prince Henry and made him governor of the Isle of Wight but he grew restless in the quiet world of Osborne House. When he slipped away for a jaunt to Corsica with his brother Louis Alexander, the queen sent a warship to bring him back. In 1895 he volunteered for service in the Asante expedition and contracted fever from which he died, on the way home, on 20 January 1896. Princess Henry was given her husband's governorship and continued to be the queen's close companion and unofficial private secretary.<br>
<br>After Victoria's death, the princess lived in Osborne Cottage until 1912 when she moved into the governor's house at Carisbrooke Castle. The marriage of her daughter, Princess Ena (1887&#150;1969), to King Alfonso XIII of Spain in 1906 caused some controversy as it entailed her conversion to Catholicism, a step of which <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32975/', "Edward VII")</script> disapproved. This marriage was to transmit the haemophilia (of which Beatrice was a carrier and from which her second son, Leopold Henry (1889&#150;1922), suffered) to the Spanish dynasty. Prince Maurice (<i>b</i>. 1891), Beatrice's youngest son, was killed in action in 1914. In 1917, in accordance with George V's policy of divesting the royal family of its German associations, the family name of Battenberg was changed to Mountbatten, the princess resuming her former style of Princess Beatrice, and her eldest son, Alexander (1886&#150;1960), becoming marquess of Carisbrooke.<br>
<br>Princess Beatrice was bequeathed all the queen's private journals, with instructions to modify or destroy any passages which appeared unsuitable for posterity. Although she survived her mother by forty-three years, she continued to be her loyal assistant and fulfilled her instructions all too faithfully. She also translated extracts from the diary of Queen Victoria's maternal grandmother, Augusta, duchess of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld, published in 1941 as <span class="italic">In Napoleonic Days</span>.<br>
<br>Her life was saddened by untimely deaths but she lived, a stout and kindly person, until she was eighty-seven, dying at her last home, Brantridge Park, Balcombe, Sussex, on 26 October 1944. Her funeral was at St George's Chapel, Windsor, and she was buried beside her husband at Whippingham.<br>
