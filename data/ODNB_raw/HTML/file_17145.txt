<span class="headword">Lucius</span>  (<em>supp. </em><em>fl. </em>185), <span class="occ">supposed king in Britain</span>, was the fruit of simple unpremeditated error, which then gave rise to a story of considerable historical importance. The <span class="italic">Liber pontificalis</span>, in its biography of Pope Eleuther (<i>fl</i>. <i>c</i>.180), has the following brief sentence: &#145;He received a letter from Lucius, a British king, who wanted to become a Christian on his authority&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Book of Pontiffs</span>, 6). The names of the consuls imply a date of 185. It is very probable, as shown by Harnack, that this is the outcome of a confusion between Birtha (the castle of Edessa) and Britain; the ruler of Edessa, Abgar IX (Lucius Aelius Septimius Megas Abgarus), was thus transformed into a British king. It is highly unlikely that there was any propagandist intent behind the error, since the sixth-century author of the early part of the <span class="italic">Liber pontificalis</span> showed no interest in papal sponsorship of missions: the role of Celestine in authorizing the sending, as his representative, of Palladius as first bishop of the Irish is passed over.<br>
<br>The <span class="italic">Liber pontificalis</span>, however, was one of the most important historical texts of the early middle ages. The story thus passed to Bede, where it was repeated in his <span class="italic">Historia ecclesiastica</span>: for Bede, this papal mission to the Britons was rapidly successful and Christianity then remained &#145;unharmed and undiminished in serene peace up to the time of the emperor Diocletian&#146;  (Bede, <span class="italic">Hist. eccl.</span>, 1.4). Bede associated the end of this golden age of the British church&#151;a happy period before heresy, first Arianism and then Pelagianism, poisoned the island&#151;with the persecution of Diocletian; the persecution then accounted for the martyrdom of St Alban. The unstated implication, for Bede, appears to be that the Britons, many of whom currently refused to accept the Roman Easter and tonsure, should remember their papal origins and conform.<br>
<br>The <span class="italic">Historia Brittonum</span> (829&#150;30) also included the story: the embassy, however, was no longer from Lucius to the pope, but from the Roman emperors and the pope (named &#145;Eucharistus&#146;) to the Britons. The role of Lucius is also significantly glossed: he is still &#145;the British king&#146; but his baptism is followed by those of &#145;all the under-kings of the British people&#146;  (<span class="italic">Historia Brittonum</span>, chap. 22). The author has made Lucius part of a Britain ruled by British kings, but subject to Roman emperors; the role of the papacy has become secondary. The conversion, however, was seen to be just as complete as it was by Bede.<br>
<br>By the ninth century, therefore, the early papal origins of British Christianity were authoritatively established both among the Britons themselves and among the English. Although the story might later be overshadowed by mistier and more exciting tales of Joseph of Arimathea, it remained standard until, in modern times, ancient historians observed that there could hardly have been a second-century British king at all south of Hadrian's Wall, let alone one in a position to send an embassy to the pope.<br>
