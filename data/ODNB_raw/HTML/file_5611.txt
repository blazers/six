<span class="headword">Clephane,  John</span>  (1701/2&#150;1758), <span class="occ">physician</span>, was born in Scotland, probably the eldest of the three sons and two daughters of Colonel William Clephane (<i>d</i>. 1727), a Jacobite who escaped after the 1715 rebellion, and Elizabeth, daughter of James Cramond, priest of the Scottish Episcopal church. Between 1716 and 1724, suspected of being a Jacobite, he took a full arts and divinity course at St Andrews University. He then matriculated in the faculty of letters at Leiden in 1724 and studied medicine under Boerhaave, with whom he later corresponded. About 1725 he joined his father in Antwerp but returned to Scotland after his father's death. On 29 May 1729 he received an MD at St Andrews, with testimonials from Adam Murray MD, Thomas Carmichael, and James Blair.<br>
<br>In 1731 Clephane was in Groningen, supervising the studies of Lord Sherard Manners, and between 1731 and 1737 he travelled as tutor to the younger sons of the duke of Rutland, lords Robert and Charles Manners. In 1735, living in the Rutland house in Cavendish Square, London, he is said to have been engaged to Lady Diana Grey, but in 1736 she married George Middleton and Clephane remained a bachelor. In 1739 Clephane travelled with Lord Maunsel to Italy and set out in October 1740 on a similar journey as tutor to John Bouverie; their time in Florence was recorded in letters from Horace Mann to Horace Walpole. Clephane was again in Italy in 1744 with Lord Montrath.<br>
<br>By 1746 Clephane was practising medicine in London, and through Lord Sandwich he was appointed on 16 April as physician to the force, under General Sinclair, that failed to destroy the French East India Company stores at Port L'Orient, Brittany. He also met the philosopher and historian David Hume, Sinclair's secretary, who was to become a lifelong friend. On 8 January 1747 Clephane was elected FRS, and was described by Richard Mead as &#145;well skilled in Natural History, Chemistry and other branches of useful knowledge&#146;  (Royal Society, fellowship certificate). Four months later Lord Sandwich found him employment as physician to the army hospital at Osterhout, Flanders, after which in 1749 he was briefly superintendent of the army hospital at Ipswich.<br>
<br>Placed on half pay and back in London, on 8 May 1751 Clephane was appointed physician to St George's Hospital. By 1752 he was living in Golden Square, and on 25 June he became a licentiate of the Royal College of Physicians. He was soon involved in disputes between the licentiates and the college, and in July 1752 he took out a writ against the college to recover the fees that, possibly illegally, he had been forced to pay for his licence. The college, fearing to lose the case, repaid the fees in December and the case was withdrawn. As a doctor, Clephane was interested in the possible connection between weather and disease, but his records were never published. He was an original member of the Society of London Physicians, founded in 1754, and published articles in its <span class="italic">Medical Observations and Inquiries</span> (vol. 1, 1757) on the successful treatment of lockjaw and the history of gout powder.<br>
<br>Although unwell, Clephane was recalled to military service in 1758 as physician to a force assembled in the Isle of Wight to destroy French ports. At the beginning of August he was taken ill on his ship, which was lying off Cherbourg, and he returned to the Isle of Wight, where he died on 11 October; his place of burial is not known. A classical scholar with interests outside medicine, he had correspondents in Britain and on the continent. Far from wealthy, he helped his relations financially when he could. His sister Elizabeth, married to Hugh Rose of Kilravock, administered his estate and was residuary legatee, and a collection of Clephane's papers are among those of the Roses of Kilravock at Register House, Edinburgh. William Hunter sent Elizabeth a copy of <span class="italic">Medical Observations and Inquiries</span>, praising Clephane's &#145;knowledge both natural and acquired&#146; and &#145;his amiable and conciliating temper&#146; that preserved harmony in the society  (Innes, 462). Elizabeth may have given Clephane's medical papers to Hunter; they were later in the Hunterian Library, Glasgow University. Clephane is now mainly known as a correspondent of David Hume, through the publication of Hume's letters to him by J. H. Burton in his <span class="italic">Life of David Hume</span> (1846). No letters from Clephane to Hume are known.<br>
