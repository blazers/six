<span class="headword">Taylor,  Zachary</span>  (1653&#150;1705), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, the son of Zachary Taylor (1618/19&#150;1692) and Abigail Ward, was born at Bolton, Lancashire, on 20 April 1653 and was baptized at the parish church four days later. His father, a graduate of Trinity College, Dublin, served as a chaplain in the royalist army during the 1640s, but in the following decade he joined Lancashire's second presbyterian classis and served a number of cures in both Cheshire and Lancashire. At the time of the Restoration Taylor senior was acting as assistant to the vicar of Rochdale and parish schoolmaster, and although ejected from the first post under the terms of the 1662 <span class="roman">Act of Uniformity</span> he retained the second until 1666. In 1672 Taylor took out a licence, under the terms of Charles II's declaration of indulgence, for a presbyterian meeting at Rochdale, but following the revocation of this declaration he returned to teaching, assuming the post of schoolmaster of Kirkham, which he was to hold until his death, aged seventy-three, in 1692.<br>
<br>Zachary Taylor junior was admitted at Jesus College, Cambridge, in 1671, where his tutor was the Lancashire native Richard Wroe, and graduated BA in 1675 and MA three years later. On 13 July 1678 he was incorporated at Oxford. No doubt aided by the support of his former tutor Wroe, who had left Cambridge in 1674 to take up a position as chaplain to the bishop of Chester, Taylor chose to make his career in the restored Church of England to which his father had found it impossible fully to conform. In 1677 Taylor was appointed one of Lancashire's six king's preachers, an office established in 1599 with the intention of furthering the Reformation in those parts of the county most resistant to protestantism, and it seems likely that during the late 1670s he also served as curate of Wigan, before being appointed on 9 March 1680 vicar of Ormskirk. Five years later, on 12 July 1685, Taylor married Barbara Stanley (1666&#150;1689), the daughter of Sir Edward Stanley, third baronet, of Bickerstaffe, Lancashire. In 1692 Taylor resigned his cure at Ormskirk and returned to the post of curate of Wigan, in which he was to remain, apart from a brief spell between 1695 and 1696 as rector of Croston, Lancashire, until his death on 20 May 1705. He was survived by his second wife, Anne, and seven children.<br>
<br>Though he never reached the higher echelons of the Anglican church, Taylor attained some contemporary notoriety through a number of pamphlets. His first surviving work, published in 1682, was <span class="italic">A Dissuasive from Contention</span>, in which he argued that the breach between Anglicans and protestant dissenters had been occasioned by disagreements concerning ceremonies rather than the more serious matter of doctrine, but that having created this schism dissenters had been drawn into activities which threatened to undermine both the church and state. Taylor's prescription was not, however, an accommodation with dissenters but a demand that they subject themselves to the discipline of the national church. Such sentiments were in keeping with the prevailing political sentiments of the early 1680s, but his next published work contributed to, rather than merely followed, national political developments. In 1689 Archbishop Sancroft had published, in response to the events of the revolution of 1688, the Anglican canons which had been drawn up in 1606, Sancroft pointing to the canons' denial of the subject's right of resistance. However, in <span class="italic">Obedience and Submission to the Present Government</span>, published between April and October 1690, Taylor emphasized the twenty-eighth of the canons, which stated that once a usurper had achieved stable government then allegiance was due to a regime which governed <i>de facto</i> if not <i>de jure</i>. For those tories and Anglican clergymen suffering a crisis of conscience caused by the conflict between the requirement to take the oaths to William and Mary, and their belief in the binding nature of their oaths to James II, Taylor's argument offered a justification for acquiescing to the demands of the new regime. His interpretation prefigured that of William Sherlock, the dean of Christ Church, whose pamphlet <span class="italic">The Case of Allegiance due to Soveraigne Powers</span>, published in 1691, expanded Taylor's arguments and prompted a long and fierce pamphlet debate.<br>
<br>Taylor never again wrote on national matters, but he remained a controversial figure within the context of the political and religious divisions of Lancashire. In 1696 he published <span class="italic">The Devil Turn'd Casuist</span>, a critique of the claims made by local Catholics to have effected a successful exorcism, and two years later he attacked, in <span class="italic">The Surey Impostor</span>, the claims of a group of Lancashire's dissenting ministers to have exorcised Richard Dugdale. Taylor dismissed the episode as a fraud perpetrated upon the nonconformist ministers by local Catholics, and his attack upon Lancashire dissent led to his being criticized in two pamphlets for his hostility towards fellow protestants. Both were called <span class="italic">The Lancashire Levite Rebuk'd</span> (1698), drawing a comparison between the story of the Good Samaritan, where the Levite had bemoaned the protagonist's misfortune but failed to offer any assistance, and Taylor's alleged indifference to the fate of Richard Dugdale. Taylor responded, in two pieces entitled <span class="italic">Popery, Superstition, Ignorance and Knavery</span> (1698&#150;9), with a vituperative attack upon dissenters, labelling them as schismatics whose division from the established church was both unwarranted and damaging to the protestant cause. Though retiring from political and religious pamphleteering after producing the second of these pamphlets, Taylor remained a staunch tory until the end of his life.<br>
