<span class="headword">Archer, Sir  Geoffrey Francis</span>  (1882&#150;1964), <span class="occ">colonial governor</span>, was born on 4 July 1882 at 10 Somers Place, Paddington, London, the second son of Francis Bradley Archer, a banker, and his wife, Mary Elizabeth Jackson. With the assistance of his maternal uncle, Frederick Jackson, who was then acting commissioner there, Archer went in 1901 to Uganda in search of a career. The informal arrangements then possible are illustrated by his appointment to the east African administrative service; he took up his first post at Mombasa early in 1902 with the help of Sir Charles Eliot, the commissioner there. By his own account, Archer's apprenticeship was not taxing, and routine office work was eclipsed by travel, hunting, and the foundations of a lifelong interest in ornithology. At the end of 1902 he was appointed assistant collector, and in 1904 was transferred, at his request, to Baringo as assistant district commissioner.<br>
<br>In April 1907 Archer was promoted district commissioner and, after a surveying course in England, took up a new post at Mumias. Appointed to establish administration in the northern frontier district of Kenya, Archer organized a northern frontier constabulary with which, in 1909, he opened up the region, established a post in Masabit, and laid the basis for rudimentary administration. In 1911 he was promoted officer in charge of the district.<br>
<br>In May 1913 Archer was transferred to the Somaliland protectorate, where since the beginning of the century British rule had been opposed by the followers of Sayyid Muhammad Abdullah Hassan. As acting commissioner and acting commander-in-chief while H. A. Byatt went on leave, later as deputy to Byatt, and finally, from 1914, as his successor, Archer was fully occupied in various schemes to suppress the revolt of the man contemporary British sources call &#145;the Mad Mullah&#146; and whom to this day Somalis consider the father of independence. Successive military expeditions had ended in expensive failure, in a territory of little strategic and economic importance to the empire.<br>
<br>During the First World War, Somaliland was necessarily an imperial backwater. Operations against Sayyid Muhammad continued but remained inconclusive. As elsewhere in the British and French empires, in Somaliland European officials were aware of local sympathy for the Ottoman sultan-caliph, but in administered areas there was no serious eruption of trouble. Archer indeed spent considerable time in the later war years on ornithological observation and research. In February 1917 he was a member of the British delegation to the coronation of the Abyssinian empress. On 16 May 1916 he married Olive Mary (<i>b</i>. 1893/4), daughter of Charles Bulkeley Godman. There were no children from the marriage.<br>
<br>With the end of the war the British undertook decisive operations against Sayyid Muhammad. Greatly assisted by the Royal Air Force, these led in 1920 to capture of the rebel stronghold at Tali (Dali); the Sayyid died of illness in November. Among the British honours distributed was Archer's KCMG.<br>
<br>Archer's tenure in subsequent posts was so brief as to have made little impact. In 1923 he was appointed governor of Uganda, where he toured energetically and took a keen interest in the flora and fauna but left no mark on the administration. In November 1924 he was unexpectedly appointed governor-general of Sudan to succeed Sir Lee Stack, whose assassination in Cairo had precipitated a crisis in Anglo-Egyptian relations, not least in Sudan itself, where Egypt and Britain were nominal co-domini.<br>
<br>Archer's governor-generalship in Khartoum was unhappy and ended in failure. The first &#145;outsider&#146; appointed to a post that had been occupied by Sir Reginald Wingate, Field Marshal Kitchener, and, indeed, General Gordon, Archer failed from the outset to win the loyalty of the Sudan political service, an &eacute;lite administrative cadre. A crisis was not long in coming. In 1926, Archer's conciliatory and widely publicized visit to Sayyid &#145;Abd al-Rahman al-Mahdi, son of the famous Sudanese Mahdi, was used as a pretext by the governor-general's senior staff, who complained to Lord Lloyd, British high commissioner in Cairo. Lloyd took private advice, which indicated that the rupture between Archer and his leading subordinates was complete, and Archer had to resign. The circumstances of his resignation (about which there were rumours concerning his personal as well as professional conduct), and his subsequent ill health, brought an end to his active career at the early age of forty-four.<br>
<br>Archer's long retirement was spent first in business in India and later in the south of France. His east African experience resulted in two books: <span class="italic">The Birds of British Somaliland and the Gulf of Aden</span>, with E. A. Bodman (4 vols., 1938&#150;1960): and <span class="italic">Personal and Historical Memoirs of an East African Administrator</span> (1963). Archer died on 1 May 1964 at Palais des Dunes, La Croisette, Cannes, France.<br>
