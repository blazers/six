<span class="headword">Smith,  John</span>  (1825&#150;1910), <span class="occ">dental surgeon</span>, was born in Edinburgh on 24 February 1825, the son of John Smith (<i>d</i>. 1851), a dentist in Hyndford's Close, Edinburgh. He was educated at the Edinburgh Institution and then studied medicine at the University of Edinburgh, where he graduated MD and LRCS in 1847. After graduating he travelled to Paris, and was there during the 1848 rising. On his father's death in 1851 John took over his dental practice at 12 Dundas Street, Edinburgh; however, he did not entirely forgo his medical interests, since in 1859 he proposed the foundation of what was to become the Royal Edinburgh Hospital for Sick Children. In 1853 he married Elizabeth Marjory, daughter of Dr Peters of Arbroath; they had three sons and two daughters.<br>
<br>In 1856 Smith delivered a comprehensive course of lectures on the teeth at the Edinburgh medical school, the first such lectures to be held in Scotland. He was appointed surgeon dentist to the Royal Public Dispensary in 1857, but resigned two years later to establish an institution devoted to dental treatment, the Edinburgh Dental Dispensary, which opened in 1860. Following his representations the dispensary was recognized as a training centre for the diploma in dental surgery of the Royal College of Surgeons, London, in 1865. The dispensary was incorporated into the Edinburgh Dental Hospital and school in 1879, with Smith, who was regarded as the school's creator, as consulting surgeon dentist. In 1871 he was appointed surgeon dentist in Scotland to Queen Victoria, a post he held until her death in 1901.<br>
<br>An advocate of dental education and the advance of the profession, Smith was a member of the dental reform committee inaugurated in 1876 to promote the regulation and professional education of dentists in Britain. Elected in 1879 to the representative board, which was to be responsible for the foundation of the British Dental Association (BDA), he was subsequently appointed to the first editorial committee of the <span class="italic">Journal</span> of the BDA, and was BDA president in 1884. As well as numerous articles he published <span class="italic">A Handbook of Dental Anatomy and Surgery</span> in 1864 (revised 1871).<br>
<br>Smith was elected a fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh in 1861 and held the office of president in 1883&#150;4. For many years he was a member of the president's committee, and he was an examiner for the triple qualification and the fellowship. He was enrolled as a fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1871, and served as president of the Odontochirurgical Society of Scotland in 1881&#150;3. He was awarded an LLD degree by Edinburgh University in 1884.<br>
<br>Smith had an amiable, courteous, and considerate personality, and was gifted in various fields other than dentistry. He wrote numerous songs, many of a medical nature; dramatized <span class="italic">Waverley</span> by Walter Scott; and wrote three successful pantomimes, which were produced at the Edinburgh Theatre Royal. Smith was a talented painter, and he also enjoyed angling and shooting. He was a Conservative, and a staunch adherent of the Church of Scotland. Smith died in Edinburgh on 15 April 1910; he was survived by his wife.<br>
