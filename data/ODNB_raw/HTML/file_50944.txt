<span class="headword">Cheshire,  (Geoffrey) Leonard</span>, Baron Cheshire  (1917&#150;1992), <span class="occ">air force officer and charity founder</span>, was born on 7 September 1917 in the Egerton Nursing Home, 65 Hoole Road, Hoole, Chester, the elder of two sons of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30922/', "Geoffrey Chevalier Cheshire (1886&#150;1978)")</script>, an academic lawyer who became Vinerian professor of English law at Oxford, and his wife, (Burella) Primrose Eleanor Barstow (1889/90&#150;1962). There were two generations of lawyers on his father's side; and his mother's father and brothers were all army officers.<h2>
<a name="Education"></a>Education</h2>Cheshire's early life, described as &#145;secure, encouraging, disciplined&#146;  (Morris, 9), was spent at Cothill, a village outside Oxford, where his parents had built a house. He was sent to the Dragon School in Oxford, but learned to speak French after spending a year at Pau in the Pyrenees with his mother and her family. In 1931 he won a scholarship to Stowe School, where his teachers included the writer T. H. White. He demonstrated &#145;resolution and a competitive streak&#146; while there  (ibid., 20), but was curiously detached. The headmaster of Stowe described him as hard-working, but not very gifted; nevertheless in 1935 he won a place at Merton College, Oxford (his father's college), to study jurisprudence. He went up to Oxford in autumn 1936 after a spell in Germany learning the language.<br>
<br>At Oxford, Cheshire followed the usual pattern of extrovert young men of the time: he became noted for &#145;fast cars, reckless exploits, fantastic extravagance, mounting debts and shady associations&#146;  (Morris, 23). He apparently modelled himself on the Saint, the raffish hero of stories by Leslie Charteris. He was also known to go dog-racing with college servants; and at one time he held the undergraduate record for the fastest return from Hyde Park Corner to Magdalen Bridge, in an Alfa Romeo. Yet Cheshire also unobtrusively worked hard. His tutor, F. H. Lawson, described him as &#145;intelligent and competent&#146;, and he graduated in 1939 with a good second-class degree.<br>
<br>Cheshire had joined the Oxford University air squadron in 1936; and he coped with the elements of flying, effectively, if not brilliantly. He later recalled how, watching Hitler's progress, he had become aware &#145;that something evil and dangerous was abroad&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>), and decided that he must oppose it. He applied for and accepted a permanent commission in the RAF, taking it up after his graduation in June 1939. He was then sent to the flight training school at RAF Hullavington.<br>
<br>In June 1940 Cheshire was posted to 102 squadron, Bomber Command. The great majority of his contemporaries at Hullavington volunteered for Fighter Command, but not Cheshire. A contemporary recalled that, when commiserated with, his reply was, &#145;Nonsense. Look, there are nineteen of you and there is only one of me&#151;they will hear about me&#146;  (private information). He became a co-pilot on an Armstrong Whitworth Whitley, his pilot being a tall New Zealander, Frank Long. Cheshire later praised the way &#145;Lofty&#146; Long taught him not just the drills for flying at night by instruments, but also how to fly under heavy enemy fire. While in the RAF he was familiarly known as Chesh, even sometimes Cheese. With his &#145;slim athletic frame&#146;, his &#145;clean-cut, boyish good looks &hellip; made him a WAAF favourite&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Independent</span>).<h2>
<a name="Bomberpilot"></a>Bomber pilot</h2>Cheshire was soon captain of his own plane and carrying out raid after raid on the industrial cities of Germany. His dedication was such that he &#145;volunteered for missions when it was not his turn and even while he was assigned temporarily as a flying instructor&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>). His rapport with his air crew and with his ground crew became legendary: one later commented that &#145;He could get me to do anything&#146;  (Morris, 101). He was once criticized for drinking with his crew in a saloon bar reserved for officers, but replied: &#145;If I am good enough to fight and fly with these men I am certainly good enough to drink with them&#146;  (private information).<br>
<br>Within a year Cheshire was awarded the DSO for bringing home his holed and burning aircraft&#151;and its crew&#151;after an attack on Cologne: &#145;If ever an aircraft flew on faith and little else that one did&#146;  (Morris, 64), a colleague wrote. His commitment and dedication could not fail to impress his commanding officers, and led to rapid promotion: to flight commander and then squadron leader. In 1941, however, he had to go to Montreal to collect a plane; and while waiting for it to be prepared, had some leave in New York. While there he had a whirlwind romance with a stage and screen actress. According to his biographer, &#145;Constance Binney was extrovert, a little gaudy, wealthy and moved in a circle of world-famous friends&#146;  (Morris, 77); and they were married in Montreal on 15 July 1941. Constance arrived in England in October to be with him. His parents, unfortunately, took against her, dubbing her Jezebel.<br>
<br>Constance nevertheless recognized her husband was gifted, and she encouraged him to become a writer. In spare time during the day, and also between operations, he wrote a book about his experiences. This became <span class="italic">Bomber Pilot</span>, which sold out its first 10,000 copies soon after publication. It made Cheshire into a public figure and led to his writing other articles and giving lectures. He also gave one of the broadcasts in the BBC's <span class="italic">Postscript</span> series on radio in August 1942.<br>
<br>Cheshire was the first to admit that luck played a great part in his survival. He was constantly under enemy fire month after month without fatal damage&#151;although it was no doubt responsible for his breakdown and prolonged ill health after the war. His targets included some of the most heavily defended on the continent, but he attacked them successfully and with initiative. Any new plan for such attacks was thoroughly tested by Cheshire, and he constantly sought to improve the efficiency of his aircraft (especially the four-engined Halifax, deemed by many to be unsafe); and he pressed for the introduction of smaller, faster aircraft, such as the Mosquito.<h2>
<a name="Dambustersquadron"></a>Dambuster squadron</h2>Cheshire demonstrated outstanding leadership qualities and at twenty-five became the youngest group captain in the RAF, commanding the bomber station at Marston Moor. This pleased Constance as it took him away from operations, but he was desperate to return to a flying command. This caused his superiors some problems, as they did not wish to waste such a brilliant talent; but in due course the perfect post emerged. Although he had to revert to the rank of wing commander, Cheshire was given command of the legendary 617 squadron. Formed by Guy Gibson in 1943, and using new bombs designed by Barnes Wallis, the &#145;dambuster&#146; squadron had become famous through their low-level attacks on the Eder and M&ouml;hne dams.<br>
<br>Under Cheshire's command and commitment the squadron became responsible for further refining the art of precision bombing. Through intensive training and great technical skill 617 became adept at marking targets by diving and dropping marker flares from only a few hundred feet. A larger force was then able to drop their bombs from a safer altitude. The technique was first successfully tested early in 1944 on an aero-engine plant at Limoges (which was destroyed in a manner that gave the French workforce time to escape). Subsequent precision targets that were destroyed or put out of action included the submarine pens at Le Havre and the sites of V-weapons in northern France. The latter included the V3, &#145;a nest of long range guns, in a subterranean tunnel, protected by a thick concrete shelter and designed to be able to pour 600 tons of explosives a day on London&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>). Flying a new single-seater Mustang, Cheshire himself marked the site, and the weapon was destroyed by new deep-penetration bombs specially designed by Barnes Wallis.<br>
<br>One of the biggest operations Cheshire and 617 were involved in was a D-day deception operation, codenamed Taxable. It involved dropping metallic strips, known as<blockquote>window, in such a fashion as to imitate, on German radar, an invasion fleet approaching France in the Pas de Calais area. The operation worked wonderfully and successfully lured coastal and fighter defences away from the real invasion force heading for the beaches of Normandy 150 miles away. It has been described as &#145;the RAF's greatest spoof operation&#146;. (<span class="italic">The Times</span>)</blockquote>Cheshire was recommended for a bar to his DSO, but was told that he would instead receive the VC. The citation was published on 8 September 1944 and was unique. Rather than an individual act of courage on a particular day, it cited four years of sustained courage, and bombing sorties in the face of heavy ground reaction. Nevertheless, the citation discussed at length the great raid on heavily defended Munich on 24&#150;25 April 1944; and it went on to praise the &#145;careful planning, brilliant execution and contempt for danger which has established for Wing Commander Cheshire a reputation second to none in Bomber Command&#146;  (Morris, 181).<br>
<br>Shortly afterwards Cheshire flew his 100th mission, at which point he was grounded. After three months with air command, south-east Asia, he was attached to the joint staff mission in Washington at the end of 1944. The latter appointment may have been brought about because his wife had had a breakdown, and needed to return home; however, the strain was finally affecting Cheshire himself, and early in January 1945 he himself was briefly admitted to hospital in Pasadena.<br>
<br>Cheshire may have thought that his war was over but, as an obituarist later wrote, &#145;The culmination of his war could not have been more dramatic&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>). He was appointed one of two official British observers to the culmination of the Manhattan project, the dropping of the world's first atomic bombs. Due to American opposition Cheshire was unable to secure a place on the plane that dropped the bomb over Hiroshima; but after pressure from the British government, he did witness the attack on Nagasaki on 15 August 1945.<br>
<br>There is no doubt that the experience was overwhelming. His health continued to deteriorate and RAF doctors sent him to St Luke's psychiatric hospital at Muswell Hill, London. An &#145;affective disorder&#146; was diagnosed and he was invalided out of the RAF on 22 January 1946. His marriage was also over (a divorce being ratified in January 1951). The atom bomb did not make Cheshire an out-and-out pacifist, as he realized that such a campaign would not &#145;fit the real world in which we live&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>). However, it did initiate the reorientation of his life towards a search for real peace. His life became, as he later put it, &#145;an attempt to achieve the kind of peace to which the key exists only in men's hearts&#146;  (ibid.).<h2>
<a name="Careofthesick"></a>Care of the sick</h2>Cheshire first sought to achieve this through creating self-governing communities of ex-servicemen; but these experiments soon disintegrated. However, he was left with a property that had been acquired: this was Le Court, a large country house near Liss in Hampshire; and it was unclear what he should do with it. Then he heard that Arthur Dykes, an ex-serviceman who had belonged to one of those communities, was dying of cancer. Cheshire agreed to nurse him at Le Court and thus&#151;unknowingly at the time&#151;began not only his life's work, but a dedication to the sick and the needy that rapidly became characterized as saintly.<br>
<br>&#145;I began to wonder if there weren't others in his position, dying and unwanted,&#146; Cheshire later wrote. &#145;I also decided that I would not go out of my way to find them, but would merely leave things to take their course. If they came my way, I would accept them&#146;  (Morris, 250). After Dykes there was an old woman of ninety-five, and &#145;Le Court filled with the disabled, the unwanted, the helpless&#146;  (ibid., 254). The experience of nursing Dykes went hand-in-hand with a religious conversion and, four months after Dykes died, Cheshire became a Roman Catholic on Christmas eve 1948. Thereafter he dedicated his life to the betterment of humanity.<br>
<br>Given his war record, whatever Cheshire did was news; and there is no doubt that his initiative touched a post-war nerve. As word got around of what Cheshire was doing, nurses and helpers arrived to share the burden. An obituarist later noted,<blockquote>Financially the place lived from hand to mouth, though through the appeal of the Cheshire name donations kept trickling in and from week to week bills somehow got paid. From being a sort of doss house, gradually Le Court became transformed into a real home, where human wrecks discarded by society were able to regain their self-respect. (<span class="italic">The Times</span>)</blockquote>The helpers included Cheshire's parents, who moved from Oxford to a cottage close to Le Court. At the start they had misgivings: his mother referred to his &#145;mad, wild, schemes&#146;  (Morris, 284) and his father to Leonard's &#145;new Messiah complex&#146;  (ibid., 285); but they supported him to the hilt. His father, who survived his mother by seventeen years, played a key role in organizing what became the Cheshire Foundation Homes for the Sick.<br>
<br>In the late 1940s Cheshire continued to do some work with Barnes Wallis; and while testing a pilotless aircraft in Cornwall, found an abandoned building near the test site. In a process that was repeated hundreds of times in Britain and abroad, he decided that this would become a home for the disabled. The project was written up in the <span class="italic">Catholic Herald</span> and elsewhere and again attracted funds and helpers. Under the influence of his new faith, Cheshire dedicated it to St Teresa of Lisieux; and St Teresa received its first patients early in 1950. Shortly afterwards Cheshire was diagnosed with a cavity on the lung. Although hospitalized for over two years in a sanatorium in Midhurst, he continued to direct this work from his bed.<br>
<br>In the mid-1950s two biographies documenting Cheshire's war record&#151;and also his new work for the disabled and dying&#151;boosted his public prominence. The first was Russell Braddon's <span class="italic">Cheshire VC</span> (1954). Another, <span class="italic">No Passing Glory</span> (1955), was written by Andrew Boyle, then a journalist on the <span class="italic">Catholic Herald</span>; they first met in 1950 and became lifelong friends. As early as 1953 Boyle was writing to Professor Cheshire that his son was &#145;surely one of the exceptional spirits of any age&#146;  (Morris, 291).<br>
<br>By 1955 there was a &#145;family&#146; of six Cheshire homes in Britain; each was run as an independent entity with its own management, but responsible to the Cheshire foundation that acted as their guardian. Cheshire's own day-to-day involvement with them was no longer strictly necessary; but he remained an active presence. The central concept on which he based the whole Cheshire movement was not &#145;how disabled is he?&#146; but, &#145;with his disabilities what can he accomplish?&#146;; and the answer was always surprisingly encouraging. While in the Channel Islands in 1956 he enlisted the help of his old teacher T. H. White, in setting up a home on Alderney. White perceptively noted that he had &#145;all the characteristics necessary for a saint&#151;obstinacy, fanaticism, charm&#146;  (Morris, 343). During this period it has been estimated that &#145;a new Cheshire home opened somewhere on average every three months&#146;  (ibid., 346).<h2>
<a name="Marriageandmission"></a>Marriage and mission</h2>Many of these new homes were in the third world, where Cheshire increasingly spent a large part of his time. His international mission to alleviate suffering began in India with the establishment of Bethlehem House in Bombay; and, as ever, Cheshire operated through influential contacts at the highest level. He managed to secure the support of the prime minister, Nehru; and after a meeting with Cheshire, Nehru is quoted as saying to an aide: &#145;That is the greatest man I have met since Gandhi&#146;  (Morris, 366).<br>
<br>By 1956 Cheshire was working closely with <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/74905/', "(Margaret) Susan (Sue) Ryder, Baroness Ryder of Warsaw (1924&#150;2000)")</script>. Sue Ryder had already carried out similar charitable work among concentration camp survivors in Poland; and at this time they formed a joint mission for the relief of suffering, the Ryder&#150;Cheshire Foundation. One of their first projects was a large centre, including hospital facilities, at Dehra Dun at the foot of the Himalayas called Raphael, after the archangel of healing. Their joint foundation went on to establish similar missions in India, Nepal, Tanzania, Australia, and New Zealand to cater for victims of tuberculosis, mental handicap, and leprosy. In the UK they also initiated the Ryder&#150;Cheshire scheme to improve the quality of life of the housebound.<br>
<br>Cheshire and Ryder were married on 5 April 1959 in a private chapel in Bombay Cathedral. Their love for each other and their work were intermingled: before their wedding they had together composed a prayer about finding God &#145;In the sick the unwanted and the dying, And there we will serve Thee, unto death&#146;  (Morris, 373). Such was indeed their life of dedication. For much of their married life they lived in a few rooms in the Sue Ryder home at Cavendish in Suffolk; but a large part of their time was spent touring their homes and projects around the world. They had a son and a daughter. Cheshire later said that marriage had been his saving, having curbed his impulsiveness.<br>
<br>By 1959 the main elements of Cheshire's work were in place, and in subsequent decades his main concern was with development: &#145;From now on the ideas ripen, but they do not fundamentally change&#146;  (Morris, 376). His reach was extended to far-flung parts of the globe&#151;to Singapore, China, the Middle East, and West Africa&#151;but many of these later initiatives had to be carried out by others. By 1992 there were 270 homes in 49 countries. Cheshire's biographer has described them as like new flames spread from &#145;the single taper of Arthur Dykes's life&#146;  (ibid., 375). By no means all the homes were residential. In many countries they also served the purpose of maintaining and developing wider care services for the disabled. All were locally run and financed, according to the Cheshire ethos; and disabled people were themselves represented on every level of the foundation's organization.<h2>
<a name="Significance"></a>Significance</h2>It was not until the very end of his life that Cheshire accepted any form of official recognition for his work: in 1981 he became a member of the Order of Merit, and in 1991 accepted a peerage. Early in 1992 he was diagnosed with motor neurone disease, and he died on 31 July of that year in the Sue Ryder home at Cavendish, Sudbury, Suffolk. Cheshire was buried in the village cemetery, but there was a memorial mass at Westminster Cathedral on 25 September. &#145;He had allowed God into his life and this transformed him,&#146; declared Cardinal Basil Hume in a homily on that occasion. &#145;He had said &#147;yes&#148; to God, not half-heartedly, not with reluctance but, characteristically, in a manner that was total and even radical&#146;  (Morris, 434). In her Christmas message at the end of the year, the queen mentioned that she had met him at a reception for members of the Order of Merit shortly before his death. She recalled how Cheshire, despite his own illness, had spoken to her only of &#145;his hopes and plans to make life better for others&#146;  (ibid., 429).<br>
<br>Lord Cheshire was one of the most remarkable men of his generation. In his tribute, Lord Denning spoke for many when he said that &#145;He has done more good for more people than anyone else in the country&#146;  (Morris, 435). Another person, who had worked closely with him in the foundation, said that he was &#145;inspirational and never defeatist&#146;, recalling Cheshire's heartfelt declaration that &#145;If the cause is right, the means will be found somehow&#146;  (ibid., 434).<br>
