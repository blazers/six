<span class="headword">Walpole,  George</span>  (1758&#150;1835), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, born on 20 June 1758 at Wickmere, Norfolk, was the third son of Horatio Walpole, second Lord Walpole of Wolterton (1723&#150;1809), a politician, and his wife, Lady Rachel Cavendish (<i>d</i>. 1805), the third daughter of William, third duke of Devonshire. His father succeeded his cousin Horatio Walpole, fourth earl of Orford, as fourth Lord Walpole of Walpole in 1797, and was created earl of Orford in 1806. George Walpole was educated at Eton College between 1769 and 1776, was commissioned cornet in the 12th light dragoons on 12 May 1777, and became lieutenant in the 9th dragoons on 17 April 1780. He returned to the 12th light dragoons as captain lieutenant on 10 December 1781 and exchanged to the 8th light dragoons on 13 August 1782. On 25 June 1785 he was promoted major in the 13th light dragoons, and on 31 October 1792 he became lieutenant-colonel of that regiment.<br>
<br>In 1795 Walpole went with his regiment to Jamaica, and took a leading part in suppressing the insurrection of the Trelawny maroons. Descendants of fugitive slaves freed sixty years before, they numbered fewer than 700, but they had been joined by many runaway slaves, and the insurrection threatened to spread. Some feared the involvement of French revolutionaries. Jamaica's &#145;cockpit&#146; country (that is, characterized by eroded basins) was extremely difficult for regular troops; two of the detachments sent against the maroons fell into ambushes and their commanders were killed. At the beginning of October, Walpole was charged with the general conduct of the operations, and the governor&#151;Alexander Lindsay, sixth earl of Balcarres&#151;gave him the local and temporary rank of major-general. By skilful dispositions he captured several of the maroon cockpits. On 24 October the governor wrote to the secretary of state: &#145;General Walpole is going on vastly well. His figure and talents are well adapted for the service he is upon, and he has got the confidence of the militia and the country&#146;  (A. Lindsay, <span class="italic">Lives of the Lindsays</span>, 1858, 3.80). By 22 December he had come to terms with the insurgents. They were to ask pardon, to leave their fastnesses and settle in any district assigned to them, and to give up the runaway slaves. On these conditions Walpole promised that they should not be sent out of the island, and the terms were ratified by the governor.<br>
<br>Only a few of the insurgents came in, and in the middle of January, Walpole moved against them with a strong column, accompanied by hunting dogs which had been brought at his suggestion from Cuba. The maroons then surrendered and were taken to Montego Bay. In March the assembly and the governor decided to deport them to Nova Scotia. Walpole strongly remonstrated against what he regarded as a breach of faith. He argued that the treaty might have been cancelled when the maroons failed to fulfil its terms, but that the governor had deliberately abstained from cancelling it. He declined a gift of 500 guineas which the assembly voted for the purchase of a sword and obtained leave to return to England. His intemperate letter declining the sword was expunged from the minutes of the house, and the assembly even contemplated arresting him.<br>
<br>Walpole was made colonel in the army on 3 May 1796, but he retired from the service in 1797. In January of that year the Cavendish family interest returned him to parliament for Derby, which he represented until 1806. A follower of Fox, he voted for reform, but when, in May 1798, he spoke on behalf of the maroons, his motion was defeated. The same month he was George Tierney's second in his duel with William Pitt. When Fox came into office as foreign secretary Walpole was appointed under-secretary (20 February 1806), but he did not retain this office long after Fox's death. He was MP for Dungarvan from 1807 until 1820, when, chronically endebted, he resigned his seat. In 1833 he was made comptroller of cash in the Excise Office for the rest of his life. He died, unmarried, in May 1835.<br>
