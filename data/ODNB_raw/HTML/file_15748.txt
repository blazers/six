</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Knighton, Sir  William</span>, first baronet  (1776&#150;1836), <span class="occ">courtier and physician</span>, son of William Knighton, was born at Bere Ferrers, Devon. His family had an estate at Grenofen, Whitchurch, Devon, but his father was disinherited, and, dying very early, left his widow in poverty. Knighton, after a little schooling at Newton Bushell, Devon, was sent at an early age to study medicine under his uncle, Dr Bredall, a surgeon in Tavistock. He afterwards spent two years at Guy's Hospital, London, where he studied anatomy under Henry Cline and surgery under Sir Astley Cooper, in addition to attending lectures on midwifery and physic. At the age of twenty-one he returned to Devon and obtained an assistant surgeon's post at the Royal Naval Hospital in Plymouth. At the end of 1797 he settled in practice at Devonport.<br>
<br>In 1800 Knighton married Dorothea, youngest daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/12653/', "Captain James Hawker RN")</script>, and in 1803 he moved to London. He began practice as an accoucheur, but shortly moved to Edinburgh after learning that his medical education was not yet sufficient to meet the requirements of the Royal College of Physicians. After three years' additional study, he once more returned to London, received a degree from the archbishop of Canterbury, and the degree of MD from the University of Aberdeen (21 April 1806). He was admitted a licentiate of the Royal College of Physicians on 25 June 1806 and began practice in Hanover Square, primarily as an accoucheur. By that time Knighton had already made the acquaintance of the Marquess Wellesley, whom he attended as domestic physician on his embassy to Spain in 1809.<br>
<br>In 1810 Wellesley introduced his prot&eacute;g&eacute; to the prince of Wales, with the result that he became one of the prince's physicians, and was shortly afterwards created a baronet (1812). The prince told Sir Walter Farquhar, in explanation of this appointment, that Knighton was the best-mannered doctor he had ever met. Knighton had been a close friend of Sir John McMahon, and when the latter neared death in 1817 he visited McMahon, as McMahon's executor but with the knowledge and approval of the prince, and took possession of papers compromising to the prince, to remove any possibility of their falling into the hands of the prince's enemies. Shortly afterwards the prince appointed Knighton to the auditorship of the duchy of Cornwall and of the duchy of Lancaster, and soon began more and more to consult him on matters of business. &#145;I was now beginning to be made his Confidential Friend in all those secret concerns which a life of pleasure and sensuality had exposed him to&#146;, Knighton later recalled in his diary  (Lawrence MS 51256). By 1821 Knighton was regularly dining t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te with the regent, now George IV, and was discreetly and efficiently negotiating with the Rothschilds on behalf of the king and scattered members of the royal family.<br>
<br>Knighton's firmness of character appeared in his management of George IV's inextricably confused affairs. In spite of the king's extravagance, Knighton gradually reduced his finances to order, caused the debts to be steadily liquidated, and asserted over the king's weak mind an authority which few of the ministers enjoyed. The king wrote to him as &#145;dearest friend&#146;, signed himself &#145;most affectionately yours&#146;, and gave him written authority to notify the royal tradesmen that no goods were to be supplied or work done on account of the privy purse except upon Knighton's written orders.<br>
<br>In September 1822 Knighton gave up his lucrative medical practice to devote himself fully to the king's service, having been officially appointed keeper of the privy purse in succession to Sir Benjamin Bloomfield, who had fulfilled that office as well as that of private secretary. In securing the resignation of Bloomfield, the latter office had been abolished, and the Liverpool ministry, believing the position to be an unconstitutional one, was unwilling to revive it on Knighton's behalf, or to admit him to the privy council. Nevertheless, Knighton functioned as unofficial private secretary for the duration of the king's reign, a position which kept him in daily contact with the king's ministers.<br>
<br>Knighton was frequently employed on confidential missions for the king both at home and abroad for a variety of purposes, carrying private messages to his majesty's ambassadors, looking after the well-being of the younger members of the Conyngham family, and securing the financial interests of the royal family. He was sent to Paris in 1823, and in 1824 made three journeys in rapid succession to Paris, Spain, and Sardinia. These sudden and toilsome journeys, which continued yearly and often several times a year until 1825 and 1826, probably contributed to bring on the severe illness which overtook him in 1827. He was highly esteemed by the royal family and by the ministry, having taken to heart the duke of Wellington's advice to beware how he interfered in politics; but he became the object of considerable ill will, owing to his undoubted influence with the king who rarely attended to business without Knighton's urging and assistance. The prejudice which then existed against medical men also left Knighton vulnerable to criticism. Liverpool refused to make Knighton a privy councillor because he had been &#145;accoucheur to all the ladies in London&#146;. This refusal would remain a sore point with both Knighton and the king. &#145;It is really too bad to reflect that all this intriguing and ill-humour&#146;, Mrs Arbuthnot observed in 1823, &#145;is going on because Lord Liverpool refused to admit into the Privy Council a fellow who, fifteen years ago, carried phials and pill boxes about the town of Plymouth&#146;  (<span class="italic">Journal of Mrs Arbuthnot</span>, 1.186; 2.256). Knighton's profession, as well as the Rothschild connection, provided the basis for an attack upon him in the House of Commons on 18 February 1828; but Peel denied the existence of an invisible power behind the throne. According to Greville, the attack appears to have been got up as a joke by Henry de Ros and himself; but to Knighton, who was then abroad and unable to defend himself, it was very painful.<br>
<br>Knighton attended the king almost night and day during his last illness, was present even at political interviews in the royal closet, and appears to have been sincerely attached to the king. His vigilance prevented Lady Conyngham from profiting by the temporary disorder at Windsor during the king's illness to lay hands on any of the royal jewels, and after the king's death on 26 June 1830 Knighton was busily occupied for several months in winding up his affairs. He subsequently gave up his house in London and retired into the country, which suited his failing health better than town. He died, however, in Stratford Place, Oxford Street, London, on 11 October 1836 of an &#145;enlargement of the heart&#146;, and was buried at Kensal Green cemetery.<br>
<br>Knighton had considerable taste, especially in painting, being a friend of Lawrence and a patron of Wilkie. He also possessed very great social tact, a sound business capacity, and honestly fulfilled the duties of a very delicate position. Although he long held a position where his court interest might have commanded almost any favour, he proved himself greedy neither of money nor honours, and kept aloof from all intrigue. He left a widow, one son, and one daughter.<br>
