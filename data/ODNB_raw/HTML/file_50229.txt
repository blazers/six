<span class="headword">Willoughby,  Robert (III)</span>, sixth Baron Willoughby  (1385&#150;1452), <span class="occ">military commander</span>, was the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/61772/', "William Willoughby, fifth Baron Willoughby")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/52801/', "Willoughby family (per. c.1300&#150;1523)")</script>], and Lucy, daughter of Lord Strange, and succeeded his father in December 1409. The family had extensive lands in Lincolnshire, with their family seat at Eresby, near Spilsby. Robert's first military experience was probably with the duke of Clarence in Guyenne in 1412. He attended the great council in April 1415 which approved Henry V's campaign on which he served. He led a retinue of over 500 in the 1417 campaign, being present at the siege of Caen with Lord Talbot, and in December was granted an annuity of &pound;100, on his election as knight of the Garter. In May 1418 Henry V granted him the lordship of Beaumesnil, requiring his personal service in the army with a quota of men, and, having joined the siege of Rouen, he was made the duke of Exeter's lieutenant there after its capture in 1419. Following the siege of Melun between July and November 1420 he accompanied Henry V to England in 1421 for Queen Catherine's coronation. It is uncertain whether he was at the siege of Meaux, for in May 1422 he was indenting with the council in England to take reinforcements to France in July. He must have returned to England following Henry V's death, for he indented to serve in France with the earl marshal in May 1423 and fought with distinction at the battle of Cravant on 31 July. Again in the winter of 1423&#150;4 he was in England raising a fresh force which sailed under Richard Beauchamp, earl of Warwick, in May to join the advance into Maine of John, duke of Bedford. At the battle of Verneuil in August 1424 he and Sir John Fastolf were joint captors of the duke of Alen&ccedil;on and other valuable prisoners, and he was further rewarded with the grant of the <i>comt&eacute;</i> of Vend&ocirc;me confiscated from Louis de Bourbon. With Warwick he pressed forward to capture Le Mans in August 1425 and complete the conquest of Maine.<br>
<br>Willoughby was still in service with the duke of Bedford when Salisbury's expedition was assembled in 1428 but he did not join it and had returned to England by 1429 when he recruited men for the anti-Hussite crusade of Cardinal Beaufort. This force in fact was sent to Bedford's assistance following the English defeat at Patay in June 1429. He had a major role in the operations during Henry VI's coronation expedition, with Lord Scales and Sir John Fastolf at the siege of Louviers, and with Lord Beaumont and Matthew Gough in operations in Alen&ccedil;on and along the Sarthe. As the English lost ground to the south of Normandy he was granted the <i>comt&eacute;</i> of Beaumont-sur-Oise in compensation for that of Vend&ocirc;me. He was also made captain of Pontoise and subsequently of Pont de l'Arche. From 1432 to 1433 Willoughby held command as lieutenant in Lower Normandy and was engaged in strenuous defensive operations in 1434 resulting in the recovery of St Val&eacute;ry. In July 1435 he again raised and led a force of 2000 men from England to assist Talbot in capturing St Denis in October. When Talbot withdrew to Rouen he was left in command in Paris, remaining in the Bastille until forced to withdraw in April 1436.<br>
<br>Willoughby now returned to England, but his days of soldiering were not quite finished, for when Warwick assumed the lieutenancy of Normandy in 1437 Willoughby accompanied him at his request. In indenting for service for the last time Willoughby secured the remission of all royal claims against him for ransoms and jewels held in lieu of wages of war. He also placed all his lands in feoffment as a precaution against his death. He actively campaigned with lords Talbot and Latimer but finally returned to England by the end of 1438. He was present in council in February 1439, a commissioner to raise loans in May (when he contributed &pound;100), and in July had permission to go on pilgrimage to the Holy Land, perhaps following the death of his wife, Elizabeth Montagu, sister of Thomas Montagu, earl of Salisbury, which occurred after 1438. They had married some time before February 1421. He may well have made the journey, for he does not reappear in English records until May 1443 when he was again at the council and was appointed to a commission of oyer and terminer.<br>
<br>Willoughby took no part in central politics in the 1440s but in Lincolnshire he became embroiled in a quarrel with Sir William Tailboys who, backed by the duke of Suffolk, and John, Viscount Beaumont, challenged the rule of the shire by Willoughby, his son-in-law Lord Welles, and Ralph, Lord Cromwell, the uncle of his second wife, Maud Stanhope (<i>d</i>. 1497). Their attempts to prosecute Tailboys finally provoked him to assault Lord Cromwell in the parliament of 1449. Willoughby died on 25 July 1452, without male issue. The lands and title descended to his son-in-law Sir Richard Welles, later Lord Welles (<i>d</i>. 1470). His will, drawn up on 6 June 1452, directed his burial in the chantry college at Mettingham, Suffolk, rather than at Spilsby where his ancestors lay. Nothing now remains of his tomb. His widow afterwards married first Sir Thomas Neville (<i>d</i>. 1460) and second Sir Gervase Clifton (<i>d</i>. 1471). She died on 30 August 1497.<br>
<br>How profitable Lord Willoughby's long military career proved is difficult to say. Although he only received 1000 of the 5000 marks due to him for the ransom of the duke of Alen&ccedil;on he was well placed to reap the spoils of war and was never himself captured and ransomed. Besides the fiefs and <i>comt&eacute;s</i> received by royal grant he acquired properties in Paris second only in extent to those of the duke of Bedford, including the <i>h&ocirc;tel</i> of the dukes of Orl&eacute;ans and houses of the count of Vend&ocirc;me. Yet he accumulated considerable arrears of wages, and borrowed heavily to finance his expeditions. Already by January 1431 he had granted 120 marks annual income from his manors to his brother-in-law Sir William Oldhall to repay debts to him; and was also in debt to Sir John Fastolf in December 1428. He sold French lands to Bedford for 1000 saluts. Yet some of the lands he enfeoffed in 1437 had been purchased and in his will he directed his executors to sell the lands he had acquired to pay his debts. There is no record of his building on an extensive scale like other war captains.<br>
