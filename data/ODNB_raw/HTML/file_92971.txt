<span class="headword">Casson,  (Frederick) Michael <span class="st"> [Mick]</span></span>  (1925&#150;2003), <span class="occ">potter</span>, was born on 2 April 1925 at 43 Leaside Avenue, Muswell Hill, London, one of four children of William Casson, restaurant proprietor, and his wife, Dorothy Mabel, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Miller. He showed an early aptitude for art. Despite being born with several vertebrae welded together in his neck, he also became a proficient sportsman, swimmer, and diver, though a deep dive as a youth damaged an eardrum leaving him deafened in one ear, a disability which, like his neck, he rarely mentioned. During the Second World War, excused enlistment, he worked for Oxo and served in the fire service, helping to clear and evacuate damaged buildings.<br>
<br>With the war over Casson enrolled on an emergency teacher training course at Shoreditch Technical College, specializing in art but also making some pots. After a year teaching he studied for the national diploma in design at Hornsey College of Art in north London, intending to be a painter, but soon abandoned painting in favour of pottery, despite the basic equipment and the unenthusiastic teaching. Casson's innovative, Picasso-inspired jug submitted for the diploma examination was rejected, though a more conventional piece the following year was awarded a distinction. Regardless of the relatively minimal teaching, Casson had found his metier and with his brother took over his uncle's hardware business in Marchmont Street, London, where he not only served in the shop but made pots in the basement. With an eye on early unglazed wares made in Cyprus and Crete he produced lively red earthenware with a white tin glaze, iron speckling from the body adding an extra sparkle. Shapes included bookends, figures, bowls, salad serving dishes, and lidded containers, many of which had a knob in the form of a crisply modelled animal, pieces successfully sold through Liberty's and Heals.<br>
<br>In the early 1950s Sheila Wilmot (<i>b</i>. 1930), a fellow pottery student from Hornsey, came to share the studio; she and Casson married on 2 April 1955, living first in the basement and then above the shop. Together they made a range of tablewares, a collaboration that continued until they concentrated on more individual pieces in the late 1970s. In 1959 the family (which eventually included two daughters and a son) moved to Prestwood, Buckinghamshire, where they converted an old greengrocer's shop into a pottery, producing high-fired stoneware in an electric kiln. Eventually Casson built a gas kiln for reduction-fired tableware, exploring the interaction between body and glaze, covered with rich, but quiet, contemplative colours of pale green celadons, deep black brown temmokus, and matt browns. The well-designed range included teapots, mugs, and casseroles, many with restrained brushwork decoration.<br>
<br>Feeling that what had been a rural area was becoming increasingly urban, the family moved in 1976 to Wobage Farm, a part-Elizabethan, part-eighteenth-century structure with plenty of outbuildings, near Ross-on-Wye. There they concentrated on individual rather than repetition wares, with Casson devising various stoneware bodies, one of which fired a rich red brown. Helped by Andrew McGarva, he experimented with different kilns that included a 60 cubic foot oil kiln and a smaller one fired with wood&#151;a renewable resource that made use of off-cuts from the nearby Forest of Dean&#151;and which became Casson's favourite method of firing. A salt-glaze kiln allowed Casson to investigate the unity of glaze and form in a fresh way.<br>
<br>In developing his individual pieces Casson concentrated on jugs&#151;a shape that quickly became seen as his signature form. Derived from medieval pitchers and ewers, these could have a round, full bottom with a strong, flaring neck, or be more slender and architectural, with a subtle, gently swelling belly. A natural decorator, Casson developed a range of incised, wax, and paper resist designs using clay slips. Some were based on the abstracted body of a swimmer, others on more geometrical patterns, while others recall the rhythm of waves and the undulating patterns of landscape. Colours on his individual pots were invariably those of the earth, such as deep matt ochres, saturated dark browns, and creamy whites, or, on salt or soda glazed pieces, inky blues and greys. In Casson's hands shape and decoration formed a harmonious whole. Exhibitions in London at the Craft Potters' Shop and the British Crafts Centre and a retrospective at Rufford Craft Centre consolidated his reputation, as did shows abroad.<br>
<br>In addition to being a fine potter, Casson worked diligently to nurture the burgeoning studio pottery movement. He was a keen supporter of the Crafts Centre of Great Britain (where he showed work) and in the late 1950s was a founding member of the Craftsmen Potters' Association (later the Craft Potters' Association), a co-operative that acquired a shop and gallery in central London in 1958. Working with the honorary secretary, David Canter, Casson helped put the association on a sound, democratic footing, serving on its council as both member and chair. With the setting up of the Crafts Advisory Committee (later the Crafts Council) in the early 1970s Casson became involved in running committees, giving clear, sensible advice and helping steer the new body with insight and understanding.<br>
<br>As an educationist, Casson, with Victor Margrie, helped conceive and lead the Harrow studio pottery course (later part of Westminster University), in 1963, devising a practical programme intended to enable students to set up as professional potters. To this end Colin Pearson, a potter trained in workshops rather than art school, came to teach repetition throwing. Despite the often gruelling timetable, the course proved a huge success, graduating students including Janice Tchalenko and Jane Hamlyn. Casson confessed to learning much from the students and members of staff.<br>
<br>A natural communicator, Casson devised and presented <span class="italic">The Craft of the Potter</span> (1975) for the BBC, a ground-breaking series that involved practical demonstration and discussion on the art of the potter. To the BBC's amazement the programmes were a popular hit, the series being repeated many times; a book, issued in 1976 to coincide with the programmes, continued to be reprinted. This was Casson's second book; his first, <span class="italic">Pottery in Britain Today</span>, was published in 1967. Casson proved a gifted presenter, articulate, witty, and interested, his bearded face fulfilling the popular stereotype of a potter. He was appointed OBE in 1983.<br>
<br>With increasing age Casson suffered bouts of illness and one of his struggles was to refuse public commitments to allow him time to concentrate on making pots. These continued to be innovative, with subtle variations and earlier forms revisited with a fresh eye, examples of the potter's art that carry a powerful sense of the personality and generosity of their maker. He died on 12 December 2003 at his home, Wobage Farm, Upton Bishop, Herefordshire, of heart failure, and was survived by his wife, Sheila, and their three children.<br>
<br>Casson's career neatly mirrors the development of studio pottery in the post-war period, starting with red earthenware in the 1950s, then oxidized stoneware in the 1960s, reduction-fired stoneware in the 1970s, followed by wood-firing and finally salt- or soda-fired work in the 1980s and 1990s. Each process he made his own, bringing a sensitive understanding of material and form. Rejecting the orientalism espoused by Bernard Leach, he responded to the more eclectic &#145;coffee bar culture&#146; of the 1950s and 1960s with early earthenware pieces including shapes modelled in the form of fish or figures, though for his thrown ware he drew on early Mediterranean pots. Just as he pioneered different styles of pottery, so Casson brought to his teaching the same radical attitude, inspiring several generations of potters with his ideas. His progressive approach made him a central figure in nurturing and leading the post-war studio pottery &#145;movement&#146;.<br>
