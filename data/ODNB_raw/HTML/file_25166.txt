<span class="headword">Seymour,  Francis</span>, first Baron Seymour of Trowbridge  (1590?&#150;1664), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was the third son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25160/', "Edward Seymour, Viscount Beauchamp (1561&#150;1612)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25161/', "Seymour, Edward (1539?&#150;1621)")</script>] and of Honora Rogers. He was a younger brother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25182/', "William Seymour, first marquess of Hertford and later duke of Somerset")</script>. He was born about 1590 and knighted by James I at Royston on 23 October 1613. About 1620 Seymour married Frances Prynne. They had at least one son, Charles (1621?&#150;1665), but Frances died in childbirth on 6 September 1626. Seymour sat in all the parliaments of the 1620s except that of 1626, representing Wiltshire every time apart from 1624 when he was MP for Marlborough. Throughout this period he was one of Buckingham's most vociferous critics. He was deeply opposed to the Spanish war and thought it parliament's duty to protect the localities from exorbitant financial burdens. His hostility to Buckingham caused him to be pricked as a sheriff in February 1626 in order to exclude him from parliament, and then to be removed from the commission of the peace the following July. Seymour was also passionately committed to defending the rule of law against incursions from the royal prerogative, a stance which led him to refuse the forced loan and to support the petition of right. By contrast, Seymour did not get deeply involved in the protests against Arminianism, and his sympathy for puritan &#145;godliness&#146; appears to have been limited.<br>
<br>This concern for his locality and attachment to the rule of law continued to motivate Seymour's actions during Charles I's personal rule. In 1634 he led the opposition of Wiltshire justices against a royal commission for reforming the clothing industry, claiming that this was against the dignity of the office of a justice of the peace. He also became a prominent campaigner against ship money and in May 1639 was summoned before the privy council. He told the board that:<blockquote>he had against his conscience, and upon the importunity of his friends, paid that money twice, but now his conscience would suffer him no more to do a thing (as he thought) so contrary to law and to the liberty of the subject. (Bodl. Oxf., MS Clarendon 16, fols. 125<i>v</i>&#150;126<i>r</i>)</blockquote>The same wish to defend legal propriety and the &#145;liberty of the subject&#146; informed Seymour's speeches in the Short and Long parliaments, and ironically helps to explain his subsequent decision to join the king. On 16 April 1640 he denounced those &#145;who tell [the king] his prerogative is above all laws&#146;, and called the ship-money sheriffs &#145;as grievous a plague as the task masters of Egypt&#146;  (Cope, 142&#150;3). The following November he praised parliament as &#145;the great physician of the commonwealth&#146; which would remedy the problem of &#145;ill counsel&#146;  (<span class="italic">Journal</span>, ed. Notestein, 7). As before, Seymour's primary concern was with constitutional and legal propriety; he wished to preserve episcopacy and opposed root-and-branch reform. On 19 February 1641 he was elevated to the Lords as Baron Seymour of Trowbridge, and in May voted against Strafford's attainder. By the summer of 1641 he had become convinced that the king's leading critics now posed a greater threat to the rule of law and the liberty of the subject than did Charles I. In January 1642 John Coke described him as one of the king's &#145;chief counsellors&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 64922, fol. 88<i>r</i>), and the following March, Seymour protested against the militia ordinance. On 18 March he was granted leave to visit his Wiltshire estates and early in April he joined the king at York. He offered to raise twenty horse to support the king's cause, and in August went into Wiltshire to implement the commission of array.<br>
<br>During the first civil war Seymour combined active service in the royalist armies with a strong commitment to peace negotiations. He was appointed chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster in April 1644, and was one of the royalist commissioners at the treaty of Uxbridge. He was at Oxford when it surrendered in June 1646; he begged to compound under the Oxford articles, and his fine was set at &pound;3725. He was one of the peers whom Charles summoned to Hampton Court in October 1647 to advise him, but thereafter he seems to have withdrawn completely from public life. He steered clear of royalist conspiracy and, when Seymour requested exemption from the decimation tax, Cromwell personally intervened to ensure this. Throughout the interregnum Seymour lived in retirement, convinced that the monarchy would eventually be restored, and in a private book of meditations and prayers he hoped that his fellow royalists would rejoice that they were &#145;counted worthy to suffer in a good cause&#146;  (BL, Egerton MS 71, fols. 4<i>v</i>&#150;5<i>r</i>). At the Restoration, Seymour was sworn a privy councillor and reappointed chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster. He died on 12 July 1664 and was buried in the chancel of Bedwyn Magna church in Wiltshire. Seymour's second wife, Catherine Lee, whom he had married about 1636, lived on until 1701.<br>
