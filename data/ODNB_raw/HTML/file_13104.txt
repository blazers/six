<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Herschell,  Ridley Haim</span>  (1807&#150;1864), <span class="occ">missionary and Independent minister</span>, was the third son and fourth child of Judah Herschell, a brewer, and his wife, Ghetal, of Strzelno (about 30 miles north of Torun, Poland), where he was born on 7 April 1807. Before his birth his mother was in danger because of the French occupation of the town and this suggested the name Haim (&#145;life&#146;) for her son. His grandfather, Rabbi Hillel, lived with the boy's parents, who were pious Jews, and his simple but tolerant faith was a significant influence on the boy. From the age of eleven he attended two rabbinical schools, but owing to ill health he returned a few years later to work in his father's business. From about 1822 he studied in Berlin, supporting himself by teaching. He began to learn English as a visitor to England in 1825 and, having finished his studies, he again went to London and then to Paris. As a student he had begun to question some of his earlier beliefs, and exposure to the temptations of Paris now furthered the process of alienation. However, with the news of his mother's death, his religious feelings revived, and he began to study the <span class="roman">New Testament</span>, though his instincts were hostile to the rituals of French Catholicism.<br>
<br>About 1829 Herschell again came to England and on 14 April 1830 he was baptized in St James's, Westminster, by the bishop of London, one of his sponsors being the Revd Henry Colborne Ridley, whose name he adopted. Working as a lay evangelist to Jews in the London area Herschell felt restricted by the conservatism of the Anglican authorities in the London Society for Promoting Christianity amongst the Jews; he established an independent group, which gathered informally in Kensington for study and prayer, with encouragement from Edward Irving. At one of these house meetings Herschell met Helen Skirving Mowbray (1797&#150;1853). Her father, William, a merchant from Leith, strongly opposed the ensuing friendship, with support from influential church leaders such as Thomas Chalmers, who claimed that Herschell had a &#145;shady past, including several romantic liaisons&#146;  (Brown, 217). Nevertheless, on 29 September 1831 they were married, and Herschell continued to work among Jews in Woolwich and later in Camden Town. In 1835 Lady Olivia Sparrow, who, like Herschell, had become disillusioned with the charismatic developments in Irving's church, persuaded him to take responsibility for the schools and mission work which she had established in Leigh-on-Sea, and later, near her home in Brampton, Huntingdonshire. His preference for a non-liturgical form of evangelical Christianity is reflected in his request in 1835 and 1836, for birth-notes for his daughters from the Witham Quaker monthly meeting, in preference to having them baptized.<br>
<br>Returning to London in 1838 Herschell began to preach in Founders' Hall Chapel, Lothbury. The following year he gathered a non-sectarian congregation at Chadwell Street Chapel, Islington, and in 1844 he took charge of Trinity Chapel, which had been built for him in John Street, Edgware Road, with help from such friends as Sir Culling Eardley Eardley. His hearers included both Anglicans and nonconformists who appreciated his respect for Judaism and his refusal to interpret the <span class="roman">Old Testament</span> as merely a prelude to the <span class="roman">New Testament</span>. His eschatology was more fully expounded in several publications, including his popular <span class="italic">Brief Account of the Present State and Future Expectations of the Jews</span> (1833; 5th edn, 1841), and in <span class="italic">The Voice of Israel</span> which he edited from 1844 to 1847. He travelled widely, visiting synagogues and preaching in eastern Europe, France, Italy, America, and Palestine. Typical of his non-denominational evangelicalism was his involvement in the establishment of both the London Society for Promoting Christianity amongst the Jews (1844) and the Evangelical Alliance (1845). After the death of his first wife in 1853 he married Esther Fuller Maitland (<i>d</i>. 1882) on 3 July 1855. He died at 105 King's Road, Brighton, on 14 April 1864 and was buried in Kensal Green cemetery. His three surviving children were <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13103/', "Farrer Herschell, first Lord Herschell")</script>; Mary, who married John Cunliffe, the uncle of Walter Cunliffe; and Ghetal, who married John Scott Burdon Sanderson. His son Ridley had died unmarried in 1862.<br>
