<span class="headword">Drummond,  May</span>  (1709/10&#150;1772), <span class="occ">Quaker minister</span>, was born in Edinburgh, the daughter of John Drummond (<i>d</i>. 1709), a factor and merchant, and his wife, who died in 1736. Her brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8065/', "George Drummond (1687&#150;1766)")</script> was lord provost of Edinburgh six times and another brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8062/', "Alexander Drummond (d. 1769)")</script>, was consul in Aleppo. In 1731 May attended the Quaker yearly meeting in Edinburgh and was convinced by the travelling minister Thomas Story that she should become a Quaker. Her family, members of the Church of Scotland, were very much against her choice but she persevered and was soon recognized as a minister. She began to travel extensively in the ministry in Scotland and then, about 1735, she moved to England, where she created a stir among the general public.<br>
<br>May Drummond was a tall, handsome woman, who spoke very eloquently and drew large crowds, on much the same scale as John Wesley, from all social classes. She was even granted an audience by Queen Caroline, which increased her fame. She was particularly appealing to young women, for whom she held special, often very emotional meetings. A poem by &#145;a young lady&#146;, published in the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> in 1735, gives some idea of her impact:<blockquote>
<div>No more O Spain! thy saint Teresa boast,<br>
</div>
<div>There's one outshines her on the British coast &hellip;<br>
</div>
<div>Too long indeed, our sex has been deny'd,<br>
</div>
<div>And ridiculed by men's malignant pride &hellip;<br>
</div>
<div>That woman had no soul was their pretence,<br>
</div>
<div>And woman's spelling past for woman's sense<br>
</div>
<div>'Til you, most generous heroine, stood forth,<br>
</div>
<div>And shew'd your sex's aptitude and worth.<br>
</div> (<span class="italic">GM</span>)</blockquote>In 1736 May published, first in Reading and then in Bristol, a book of letters, <span class="italic">Internal Revelation the Source of Saving Knowledge</span>. She travelled widely in England, and visited Ireland in 1738 and again in 1753. Some Friends, however, distrusted her eloquence and her popularity, fearing that she was in danger of acting for her own glory rather than God's.<br>
<br>William Cookworthy (1705&#150;1780) of Plymouth met May in 1744 and was kinder in his estimation. Writing to a friend he said that she was:<blockquote>one of a surprising genius, her apprehension being quick, lively, penetrating &hellip; a great connoisseur of the human heart in all its emotions, passions and foibles, her own open, generous, tender and humane &hellip; I had forgotten her person which seems contrived to enforce and embellish truth, not excite desire. Her face and gesture are aimed at the mind. (Miller, 60&#150;61)</blockquote>He approved the religious content of her speech but was critical of her style: &#145;rather too learned; her epithets rather swell too much&#146;  (ibid.). &#145;But&#146;, he adds, &#145;I really believe all this to be owing to her education and not to any affectation or want of simplicity&#146;  (ibid.). May continued to travel but gradually more doubts were raised about her ministry. Her habit of often mentioning her noble relatives and acquaintances made Friends uneasy and there was a feeling that she demanded too much attention for herself.<br>
<br>In the late 1750s May Drummond returned to Scotland but she was not welcomed in her own country. Edinburgh Quakers felt that she spoke in meeting too often and refused to accept their discipline. Rumours circulated that May, having fallen upon hard times financially, had stooped to pilfering food from the houses of Friends whom she visited. It was also insinuated that she had become a drunkard. Eventually, in 1764, she was officially requested not to preach and her certificate as a minister was withdrawn. She returned to England and continued to travel, becoming a shadow of her former self. Friends treated her kindly but could not acknowledge her ministry. In May 1772 she was in London but later that year she made her way back to Edinburgh, where she died, unmarried, aged sixty-two. Her family forgave her sufficiently to allow her to be buried in the family vault.<br>
