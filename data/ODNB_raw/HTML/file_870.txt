<span class="headword">Atslowe,  Edward</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1594), <span class="occ">physician</span>, probably from Eversholt, Bedfordshire, was educated at Winchester College, and admitted BA at New College, Oxford, in 1555. After being elected to a fellowship at his college he was created MD at Oxford on 27 August 1566, and was one of the four doctors appointed by convocation to dispute before Queen Elizabeth I when she was entertained at the university in September of that year. Shortly afterwards Atslowe settled in London and was admitted a fellow of the College of Physicians; between 1569 and 1583 he was appointed censor and named elect and consiliarius. On 2 November 1573 Atslowe married Frances Wingfield (<i>d</i>. 1605) at Stoke Newington; they had six children. Among his patients were many of the nobility, and he was probably attached for some years as physician to the household of the earl of Sussex. In 1572 Edward's brother, Luke, had been appointed by Edward de Vere, seventeenth earl of Oxford, as one of his four commissioners to conduct courts of survey of his lands; the Atslowes were soon after related to Oxford through Edward's marriage to Frances Wingfield.<br>
<br>Edward Atslowe was an ardent Catholic and supporter of Mary, queen of Scots. As early as December 1570 he paid her a visit at Tutbury. For many years it was alleged that he aided the earls of Arundel, Northumberland, and others, in a conspiracy to obtain assistance on her behalf from the continent, and in 1579 he was arrested on that charge, but released. In 1585 he was again sent to the Tower; but on being privately examined by the lord chancellor and other officials as to his relations with the papists, he vehemently denied having had any treasonable &#145;intelligence&#146; with any of them. A spy of Mary's wrote to her, however, in July of the same year: &#145;I heare that Dr Atslowe was racked twice almost to the death in the Towre about the Earl of Arundell his matters and intentions to depart Englande, wherein he was betrayed&#146;  (Murdin, <span class="italic">State Papers</span>, 2.452). Atslowe was apparently released soon afterwards, as he attended to a son of the earl of Northumberland during a fatal illness in 1587.<br>
<br>Atslowe is described in a private letter as being &#145;newly deade&#146; on 2 May 1594 and was buried in the parish church of Clerkenwell, Middlesex. His estate, worth &pound;561 16<i>s</i>. 2<i>d</i>., was granted to his widow on 6 May 1594 and the earl of Arundel settled an annuity on her.<br>
