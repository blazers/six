<span class="headword">Pike,  John</span>  (<em>fl. </em><em>c.</em>1310&#150;<em>c.</em>1330), <span class="occ">annalist</span>, was probably born in the last quarter of the thirteenth century in southern England. Nothing is known of his education, career, or status, whether religious or secular, and his work survives only in a handful of manuscript fragments. Earlier historians believed him to have lived and worked at the end of the twelfth century, and associated him with Ralph de Diceto and other secular London chroniclers. This identification rested, however, on the mistaken association of Pike with one &#145;John Pyk, schoolmaster of St Martin le Grand&#146; in the city of London, who owned BL, Royal MS 13 C.xi, a late twelfth-century copy of the chronicle of Robert de Torigini. Although Pike made use of that chronicle in his own work, there is no evidence, save the coincidence of names, to connect the fourteenth-century annalist with this twelfth-century book.<br>
<br>Pike seems in fact to have been active in the second and third decades of the fourteenth century. His account of the Anglo-Scottish wars continues to the death of Thomas of Lancaster in 1322, and his annals of the English bishoprics include Walter Reynolds, archbishop of Canterbury between 1314 and 1327. The earliest surviving manuscripts of his works, BL, Arundel MS 220, and BL, Cotton MS Julius D.vi, date from the first quarter of the fourteenth century: the Cotton manuscript was probably copied <i>c</i>.1327. It is possible that Pike was a Londoner: his histories do reveal strong attachment to the St Paul's chronicler Ralph de Diceto. But his work draws on a wide range of sources, including the Bridlington chronicle, the St Albans chronicle, and the annals from the Cistercians at Kingswood near Bristol. This suggests that he was a secular priest, or perhaps even a friar, with both reason and opportunity to travel in search of material. In two manuscripts Pike's work appears together with very early copies of the chronicles of the Dominican Nicholas Trevet. Trevet completed his histories in retirement at the London Blackfriars in the late 1320s. That the two authors' histories should circulate together gives further grounds for thinking that Pike lived and worked in London. It may even suggest that, like Trevet, he was a member of the Dominican convent.<br>
<br>Pike was the author of at least four historical compilations. His best-known work, which survives in three manuscripts, was the <span class="italic">Suppletio historiae regum Anglie</span>, a history of the Anglo-Norman kings from William I to John. He also compiled annals of the English bishoprics, based on Diceto, and of the British kings, based on Geoffrey of Monmouth's <span class="italic">Historia regum Britanniae</span>. Like a number of other chroniclers at this time, Pike also wrote a short account of the Scottish campaigns of Edward I and Edward II. Intended as an examination of &#145;what kind of right our king of England sought to claim in the land of Scotland&#146;  (BL, Cotton MS Julius D.vi, fol. 67<i>r</i>), his narrative wove together several of the most detailed accounts of the Anglo-Scottish wars, including the Bridlington chronicle and the chronicle of William Rishanger, a monk of St Albans. Pike's annals were derivative and unimaginative works, but they do provide an important witness to a number of now lost histories, such as the Kingswood annals and the unidentifiable <span class="italic">Compendio Breom</span>. His annals can be placed alongside the work of a growing number of non-monastic historians (many of them working in London) active in the first quarter of the fourteenth century, such as Andrew Horn, the compiler of the <span class="italic">Annales Londonienses</span>, Adam Murimuth, and the author of the <span class="italic">Vita Edwardi secundi</span>.<br>
<br>Pike completed his histories between 1322 and 1327, and he probably died before the end of the 1320s.<br>
