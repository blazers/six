<span class="headword">Lambe,  William</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1580), <span class="occ">philanthropist</span>, was the son of a lesser gentleman of Sutton Valence in Kent. A man about whom, had it not been for his acts of philanthropy, little at all would have been known, his charity was celebrated in a posthumous life by Abraham Fleming, the compiler of Holinshed's chronicles, who in fashioning him as an exemplar of protestant piety made sure that his reputation endured. According to his biographer, Lambe<blockquote>hath bene seene and marked at Powles crosse to have continued from eight of the clock until eleven, attentively listening to the Preachers voice, and to have endured the ende, being weake and aged, when others both strong and lustie went away. (Fleming)</blockquote>It was also reported that during his last illness he was visited by Alexander Nowell, dean of St Paul's, and by John Foxe the martyrologist. Lambe was apparently the author of his own book of prayers, <span class="italic">The Conduit of Comfort</span> (1579), but it was probably ghost written by Fleming. The preamble to his will seems to breathe the spirit of the godly, as he looked forward to being accepted as &#145;one of the children of Abraham&#146;  (TNA: PRO, PROB 11/62, fol. 157). But Fleming felt it necessary to defend Lambe against &#145;privie whisperings&#146; that he was a papist sympathizer, and there is no doubt that he had moved in a much more conservative milieu in his early life.<br>
<br>Stow describes Lambe as a gentleman of the royal chapel under Henry VIII  (Stow, 1.316), but it would be more accurate to say that he had held a post in the chapel vestry, for which there is evidence from the chapel lists of 1520 and 1524. The men of the vestry were responsible for looking after the chapel accoutrements and plate. Lambe's friendships towards the end of his life, both with establishment figures such as Alderman Rowland Heyward and with the much more conservative master of the rolls, Sir William Cordell (the latter two being his executors), suggest that like many of his generation he stood precariously between two worlds. Although prosperous, he was never a tycoon&#151;his subsidy assessments of &pound;100 in 1541 and &pound;50 in 1577 placing him among the top 700 to 800 citizens, but at the bottom of that group. He had dabbled in monastic lands, and in 1543 bought a package of metropolitan properties formerly belonging to the foundations of Rowley, St John Jerusalem, and St Bartholomew, Smithfield. He resided from 1541 in a property in Mugwell (or Monkwell) Street, adjacent to the former hermitage chapel of St James at London Wall.<br>
<br>The acquisition of property brought its inevitable tensions with the principles of charity, so that even this paragon, who during his lifetime is supposed to have distributed moneys anonymously among the poor of St Giles Cripplegate, was cast as one of the social villains of the metropolis when required by the court of aldermen in February 1574 to enter a recognizance not to take more poor tenants into his &#145;pestered&#146; alley in Cripplegate. Lambe's close friendship with Heyward explains his entry to the Clothworkers' Company by redemption in 1568 at an unusually advanced age, and his evident willingness to vest the company with responsibility for the management of his charities perhaps explains the extraordinary step that they took in electing him to the mastership in 1569 after a very brief association with their guild. Lambe's willingness to participate in civic administration is confirmed by his service on the court of governors of Christ's Hospital from 1571 to 1579.<br>
<br>In spite of having married three times (the identity of his wives is unknown apart from their forenames, Joan, Alice, and Joan), Lambe was childless, and it was this circumstance which encouraged his philanthropy. Among the major projects he undertook during his lifetime was the foundation of almshouses at Sutton Valence in Kent in 1574, followed by a grammar school there in 1576, and the building of Holborn conduit (the latter at a cost of &pound;1500) in 1577. The Clothworkers, who administered the Sutton Valence charities, were also the recipients of properties in the parishes of St Stephen, Coleman Street, and St Olave, Silver Street, together with the chapel of St James on London Wall, the former hermitage of the abbey of Gerendon in Leicestershire. In return the company were instructed to see that sermons were preached in the chapel four times a year and that a chaplain say divine service three times a week, as well as providing clothing each year for twelve poor men and twelve poor women, and an annuity to the poor of the parish of St Faith. Lambe's charity had its sharp edge: while requiring that his servants be kept for up to six months after his death, he nevertheless insisted that they should be treated in this way only if &#145;they repair to church and sermons and spend their time in other godly exercises&#146;  (TNA: PRO, PROB 11/62, fol. 157). He died on 21 April 1580 and was buried in a vault under a tomb he had already constructed in the parish church of St Faith under St Paul's.<br>
