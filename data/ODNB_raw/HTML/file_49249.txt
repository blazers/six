<span class="headword">Morris,  Thomas <span class="st"> [Tom; </span></span> <span class="st"> <em>called </em>Old Tom Morris]</span>  (1821&#150;1908), <span class="occ">golfer</span>, second son of John Morris, a postman in St Andrews, Fife, who later became a caddie, and Jean Bruce, who came from Anstruther, was born in North Street, St Andrews, on 16 June 1821. After a sound elementary education at Madras College in the town he was expected to train as a general carpenter but was apprenticed instead to a St Andrews golf club maker, Allan Robertson, for whom he worked for nine years, the last four as a journeyman. Like most boys in his situation he also caddied and played golf intermittently and his involvement in the sport became more serious as he began to partner Robertson in local exhibition matches. These often attracted considerable prize and betting money from local gamblers, the most notable example being a stake of &pound;400 placed on them to defeat a similar pair.<br>
<br>The partnership ended in 1851 following Morris's marriage to a coachman's daughter, Nancy Bayne, with whom he had two sons and a daughter. He moved to Prestwick, Ayrshire, where he combined keeping the new golf links with making clubs and balls and playing exhibition matches for cash prizes. It is said that after he defeated Robertson in one such match in 1853 the latter refused to play him again because Morris had forsaken the old feather balls for the new &#145;gutties&#146;, stuffed with gutta-percha and offering a longer range. Morris's subsequent adversary was Willie Park of Musselburgh, whose flair and strength were matched by Morris's careful and unflustered skills. Over the next twenty years the two men dominated matches in Scotland, each winning as often as the other and together doing a great deal to popularize the game at home and among English holiday visitors.<br>
<br>From its institution in 1860 until 1896 Morris played the open championship every time it was staged. He won four times: in 1861, 1862, 1864, and 1866. In 1863 he was persuaded to return to St Andrews, as greenkeeper to the Royal and Ancient Golf Club, a job which he combined with running a flourishing manufacturing and retail business. His presence at the Royal and Ancient did much to extend the game; he provided advice on developing new links, supplied the implements of play, and, above all, became the epitome of the canny Scottish golfer. He was a key figure in the series of booms which transformed golf from &#145;Scottish croquet&#146; into a game played internationally. His personal style helped to ensure the continuation of Scottish moral hegemony through all the changes. Just as the club which employed him eventually became the official arbiter of golfing etiquette, so Morris's advice was frequently and urgently sought on many issues. By the 1890s he was regarded widely as &#145;the veritable Nestor&#146; of the game, a wise peacemaker in many disputes.<br>
<br>Although he owed much of his initial fame to playing in wagered matches, Morris held strong religious beliefs, deeply rooted in Scottish Presbyterianism. He took his turn as an elder in St Andrews parish church, served briefly on the general assembly of the Church of Scotland, and opposed Sunday play (on the grounds that the links needed a rest as much as did the players and staff). A sturdy, black-bearded figure&#151;in his later years gradually whitening  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>)&#151;he enjoyed robust good health, swam daily in the sea, and was an enthusiast for fresh air. His strength and skill into old age provided another reason for golf's growing popularity, as a life-extending activity for middle-aged businessmen.<br>
<br>Morris's longevity was tragically not matched by that of his eldest son, <a name="cosubject_49249"></a><span class="headword">Thomas <span class="st"> [Tom]</span> Morris</span> <span class="st"> [<em>called </em>Young Tom Morris]</span>  (1851&#150;1875). Born at St Andrews on 20 April 1851, Young Tom together with his younger brother, J. O. F. Morris (<i>d</i>. 1906), followed his father into the clubmaking business and into competitions. By the time he reached twenty Young Tom was an outstanding player. In 1868 he won the open and he went on to win the next three titles as well, becoming outright winner of the championship belt. He was clearly expected to be the greatest <span class="occ">golfer</span> of late Victorian Britain, with a style far more graceful than his father's and a capacity for consistent record scores; Old Tom claimed that his son was the one opponent he could not match. However, the younger man's ebullient career ended unexpectedly on Christmas day 1875, when he was found dead in his bed, following a lung haemorrhage, at his home, 6 Pilmour Links, St Andrews. He was buried in St Andrews Cathedral churchyard. Less than four months earlier, on 4 September 1875, his wife had died, together with their baby, in childbirth. The sense of loss throughout the game was considerable and members of some sixty golfing societies subscribed to buy a three-quarters life-size memorial, executed by John Rhind and placed in St Andrews Cathedral cemetery, which shows him playing.<br>
<br>Despite his son's death, Old Tom continued to play, and recovered some form in the later 1870s, when he won professional matches both in England and in Scotland. Although he was eventually given a handicap, to reflect the slow decline brought about by age, he still stayed among the leaders until he reached his seventies. At the age of seventy-two he won the annual St Andrews competition held between his own employees and those of his commercial rival, the club maker Robert Forgan; despite his handicap of five, he finished well ahead of the younger men.<br>
<br>By this time Morris was almost as much a tourist attraction in St Andrews as the old course itself, and he clearly enjoyed this and the deference shown by both visitors and fellow townsmen. The members of the Royal and Ancient commissioned a portrait of him from Sir George Reid in 1903 and he retired from their paid employment the following year, although he continued to occupy an emeritus position. Old Tom died after a fall on the stairs of the New Golf Club in St Andrews on 24 May 1908.<br>
<br>With Morris's death golf's first era of great expansion ended. A club and tournament professional and a successful businessman, Old Tom epitomized the uncertain social position of an outstanding &#145;artisan&#146; player who depended on amateurs for patronage and employment. He offered a model for many ambitious young Scotsmen who staffed the links of England and North America, usually with far less prestige. He became golf's greatest icon, and was represented subsequently in photographs, paintings, cigarette cards, Staffordshire ware pottery, and hundreds of different souvenirs. His death symbolized the apparent end of an age of supposed innocence for a game that he had done so much to popularize and which in the course of his career had become far more sophisticated.<br>
