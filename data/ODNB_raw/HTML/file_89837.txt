<span class="headword">Tait <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Wardropper; <em>other married name </em>Simpson]</span>,  Sylvia Agnes Sophia</span>  (1917&#150;2003), <span class="occ">biochemist and endocrinologist</span>, was born in Tumen, Siberia, on 8 January 1917, the daughter of James William Wardropper, a Scottish agronomist, and his wife, Ludmila, a Russian who had graduated in mathematics from the University of Moscow. The family returned to England in 1920 via Vladivostok. Thereafter Sylvia had a conventional English upbringing. She attended the local secondary school, Ealing County School for Girls, and in her more senior years studied mainly languages. She had considerable trouble in establishing her citizenship because of her birthplace in Russia but eventually was officially recognized as British. After leaving school she spent a short period at King's College, London, but soon transferred to University College, where she eventually took an honours degree in zoology in 1939. On 6 April 1940 she married Anthony James Carey Simpson, a 22-year-old fellow zoology student at University College, then serving as a pilot officer in RAF Coastal Command. Sadly, after winning a DFC (and promotion to flight lieutenant) he was killed in action near Bergen, Norway, in October 1941.<br>
<br>After the death of her first husband Sylvia Simpson joined John Zachary Young in Oxford and worked on nerve regeneration. A colleague at that time was Peter Medawar, just starting his work on transplantation immunity. After three years in Oxford she took up a more permanent post in the Courtauld Institute at the Middlesex Hospital Medical School as assistant to Peter Claringbould Williams, head of the biology unit. At first she was part of a team working on synthetic analgesics but she later worked on oestrogens. The animal house in the Courtauld was exceptional in that it was very well equipped with surgical and rat-breeding facilities and constant temperature rooms. This was largely due to the work of Charles Dodds on reliable oestrogen bioassays. She took no part in the original work on stilboestrol but the Courtauld animal house continued to carry out bioassays of oestrogen, usually under her supervision. This was the foundation of her expertise in bioassay, a critical skill of major importance for her subsequent work on aldosterone.<br>
<br>In 1948 a clinician, B. Lewis, in the department of medicine, read a paper by Ralph Dorfman and colleagues and afterwards decided to propose a bioassay for adrenal mineralocorticoids using the effects on Na<sup>24</sup> excretion in adrenalectomized rats. Lewis separately approached Sylvia Simpson and a medical physicist in the physics department, James Francis Tait (1925&#150;2014), to suggest that they collaborate. They both accepted Lewis's suggestion, thus founding the extremely successful collaboration which later resulted in their great achievement in 1953, the discovery, isolation, and characterization of aldosterone. That period was one of explosive activity in endocrinology, where the characterization of most adrenal steroids, culminating in the isolation and clinical study of cortisol by Philip Hench, Edward Kendall, and Tadeus Reichstein (for which they were jointly awarded the Nobel prize for physiology or medicine in 1950) was crowned by Sylvia Simpson and James Tait's achievement in isolating aldosterone. Sylvia Simpson's rigorous development of an adequate bioassay based on James Tait's isotopic expertise was crucial, and this was applied to the chromatographic analysis of adrenal extracts. It rapidly became apparent that a previously unrecognized but extremely potent adrenal steroid existed, responsible for sodium and potassium regulation. Simpson and Tait's success was not without considerable difficulties. Many of the techniques involved were still at a very early stage of development, and the Middlesex Hospital medical school, like most of the other London medical schools, suffered from the legacy of financial pressures from the Second World War. But despite these difficulties, Simpson and Tait were brilliantly successful and their major discovery established the existence of a specific salt-retaining, potassium-excreting hormone now known to be the main hormonal factor in controlling salt metabolism. They collaborated with Tadeus Reichstein in Basel in the final structural elucidation of the new hormone; they further proceeded to demonstrate its physiological importance and its secretion by the zona glomerulosa of the adrenal. Their discovery preceded that of their several intense competitors in the United States and was a seminal event recognized by their joint election to the Royal Society in 1959. By then Simpson and Tait (the son of Herbert Tait, marine engineer) had married, on 1 September 1956, at Ealing register office. Thereafter Sylvia used the surname Tait in her publications.<br>
<br>In 1958 the Taits were persuaded to join the Worcester Foundation for Experimental Biology in Shrewsbury, Massachusetts, by Gregory Pincus, who was then involved in the development of the contraceptive pill. The reason for their move to the United States was connected with the turbulence caused by the reorganization of the London medical schools under the pressure of financial stringency. During this period the Taits also spent several months at the Howard Florey Institute in Melbourne, collaborating with Derek Denton and John Coghlan. Denton had developed a unique and novel preparation involving the transplantation of the adrenal to the neck of sheep, which allowed the continued detailed study of hormonal secretion. This was a scientifically extremely productive period and the Taits both enjoyed the more relaxed social life of Melbourne. They returned to the Middlesex in 1970, without enthusiastic support from Dodds, as co-directors of the Biophysical Endocrinology Unit, until their retirement in 1982.<br>
<br>Sylvia Tait was universally popular among her colleagues in the scientific community because she managed to combine marked scientific rigour with charm and an ability to express disagreement without the faintest trace of antagonism. She and her husband richly deserve the high place they hold in the history of endocrinology. The Taits were both maritally and scientifically completely complementary and were one of the most successful examples of husband&#150;wife scientific collaboration. The joint recipients of many honours, they lived in retirement in East Boldre, near Brockenhurst, Hampshire, where they continued to write scientific papers until shortly before her death. She died at Lymington Hospital, Lymington, Hampshire, on 28 February 2003. She was survived by her husband. She had been invited to make a presentation at a major conference at the Royal Society in April 2003 to celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the isolation of aldosterone. In the event, her address was given by John Coghlan.<br>
