<span class="headword">Oldhall, Sir  William</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1460), <span class="occ">soldier and speaker of the House of Commons</span>, was the son of Sir Edmund Oldhall (<i>d</i>. 1417) of Narford, Bodney, East Dereham, and Little Fransham, Norfolk, and either his first wife, Mary, daughter and coheir of Henry English of Wood Ditton, Cambridgeshire, or his second, Alice, daughter of Geoffrey Fransham of Norfolk. As an esquire he indented on 1 May 1415 to serve with three archers under Thomas Beaufort, earl of Dorset (<i>d</i>. 1426), but his actual presence on the Agincourt campaign is not proven. In the following year he served as a mounted man-at-arms at Harfleur under Beaufort, and was present at the siege of Rouen in 1418&#150;19. Oldhall had to resist efforts to deprive him of part of his inheritance when his father died intestate in 1417, but achieved this through a petition to parliament in 1421.<br>
<br>Oldhall served in France with Beaufort in 1421 and 1423, and was present at the battle of Cravant, where he was knighted. He was probably also present at the battle of Verneuil in the following year. By Michaelmas 1424 he had been appointed seneschal of Normandy (although he seems to have held the office only for one year), and participated in campaigns into Anjou and Maine (1424&#150;8). He held a series of captaincies in Lower Normandy: Essay (September 1424 to about August 1429); Fresnay (December 1429 to September 1430); Alen&ccedil;on (March 1430 to early in 1431). He also served on an embassy to Burgundy in August 1426. Present at a great council in England in the late spring of 1434, he crossed again to France as captain of Essay and <i>bailli</i> of Alen&ccedil;on, posts he held from 9 September 1434 to 30 March 1438. By December 1436 he was member of the royal council in Normandy, and was lieutenant of Bayeux in 1438&#150;9.<br>
<br>When the duke of York began his second term as lieutenant-general in France in March 1441, Oldhall, as well as holding a number of further captaincies in Normandy (Regneville from 1442 to at least August 1444; Coutances from October 1441 to December 1443, when he was replaced by Sir Thibault Gorges; and briefly Pont-l'&Eacute;v&ecirc;que, Lisieux, and Orbec in 1445), became one of the duke's closest advisers; by 1445 he was his chamberlain as well as overseer of his lands in Normandy, helping to maintain York's interests in the duchy after the latter returned to England. But he became increasingly involved with York's English interests, and may have crossed with the duke to Ireland in July 1449. He sat as MP for Hertfordshire in the parliament of November 1450, and was elected speaker, clear proof of support for the duke in the Commons, but when York's fortunes began to wane Oldhall found himself vulnerable, and in November 1451 he was forced to take sanctuary in St Martin's-le-Grand, London, accused of stealing the duke of Somerset's goods. There he remained, twice indicted of treason in 1452, outlawed in March 1453 for not appearing for trial, and attainted by parliament on 22 June 1453. When York became protector in 1454 Oldhall obtained a writ of error, but the reversal of his attainder and his liberty were only achieved in July 1455, following York's victory at St Albans. His connection with York persisted. He was with the duke at Ludford Bridge on 12 October 1459, was attainted again in December 1459, and may then have gone to Ireland with York; both were back in London in October 1460, when Oldhall's attainder was again reversed.<br>
<br>Oldhall had married, probably by 1423, Margaret, daughter of William, Lord Willoughby of Eresby (<i>d</i>. 1410) and widow of Sir Thomas Skipwith (<i>d</i>. 1418). They had a daughter, Mary, who married Walter Gorges, son of Sir Thibault Gorges of Wraxall, Somerset. Margaret was still alive in 1450, but probably died within the next four years. John Paston failed to secure Oldhall's marriage to his sister Elizabeth. Oldhall had been granted several estates in France, in addition to the English lands inherited from his father. His wife brought him lands in the West Riding of Yorkshire and Lincolnshire which had been the property of her first husband, although some were held only until his stepson came of age, and he himself purchased estates in south-east Hertfordshire, including the manor of Hunsdon, which he bought from York in 1447 and where he built a fine house. He had further grants made to him by the duke of York of lands in Ireland, Hertfordshire, Kent, and Buckinghamshire. Oldhall died in London between 17 and 20 November 1460 and was buried in the church of St Michael Paternoster Royal.<br>
