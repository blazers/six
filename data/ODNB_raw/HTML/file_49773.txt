<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Heffer,  Eric Samuel</span>  (1922&#150;1991), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born on 12 January 1922 in Hertford, the son of William George Heffer, a poor bootmaker and shoe repairer, and his wife, Annie, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Nicholls, who, in Heffer's words, &#145;cooked for the gentry&#146;  (personal knowledge). Since he was the grandson of a brickmaker and a railway signalman, he could boast &#145;I am completely proletarian in background&#146;  (ibid.). His early life was heavily influenced by churchgoing, three times every Sunday. As a choirboy, at eight he led a strike for better pay. He remained a high-church Anglican, whether his politics were communist, syndicalist, or hard-left Labour. He was educated at the Bengeo junior school and, until fourteen, at the Longmore senior school in Hertford. He was then apprenticed as a carpenter. He later studied with the Workers' Educational Association and the National Council of Labour Colleges. He became a serious reader, glorying in his collection of 12,000 books crowding his large house in Liverpool.<br>
<br>Heffer joined the Labour Party at sixteen in 1938, but left it for the Communist Party in 1941, where he met and, on 15 December 1945, married Doris Murray, daughter of Herbert Murray of Liverpool. She was also at that stage a communist. He was expelled from the Communist Party in 1946 for leading an unauthorized strike of shipboard carpenters. The Communist Party even tried to persuade his wife to leave him. He rejoined Labour in 1949, but left it to form a semi-syndicalist Socialist Workers' Federation with Harry McShane in 1954. This failed, and Heffer rejoined Labour in 1956. His early progress was in trade unions. He became vice-president of the Liverpool Trades Council in 1958, and its president in 1959. He caught the attention of a local MP, Harold Wilson, in 1960, when he settled an unofficial seamen's strike. He was runner-up for assistant general secretary of the Woodworkers' Union (later embraced in the Union of Construction, Allied Trades, and Technicians) in 1962. In 1960 he was elected to Liverpool city council.<br>
<br>In October 1964 Heffer captured Walton constituency from its Conservative MP, Sir Kenneth Thompson. Walton was the northernmost working-class seat in Liverpool, and housed two football grounds, Anfield and Goodison Park. It was also the cradle of Militant Tendency, Liverpool's Trotskyist movement. From the beginning, warm-hearted but truculent Heffer backed all left-wing causes as an MP: in 1966 he demonstrated against the use of napalm in Vietnam before the American embassy, and against the &#145;wage freeze&#146; implicit in the <span class="roman">Prices and Incomes Bill</span>. In 1967 he urged the end of Polaris submarines. An animal lover, he repeatedly sought to ban hare coursing. His short fuse led him to threaten tories Nicholas Winterton and Norman Tebbit. He accurately warned against an impending Liverpool dockers' strike, but refused Harold Wilson's offer of a post as parliamentary secretary for technology in September 1967. He preferred opposition: voting against curbs on the entry of Kenyan Asians with British passports, urging reform or abolition of the Lords, and especially campaigning against Barbara Castle's 1969&#150;70 &#145;In Place of Strife&#146; effort to curb unions. Although initially pro-EEC, by 1971 he had voted against Edward Heath's entry effort. The joint runner-up with Barbara Castle in the elections to the shadow cabinet, when a vacancy occurred he insisted on an election, which he lost in March 1972. A deputy spokesman on employment from 1970, he quit in disagreement with spokesman Reg Prentice, who later became a Conservative.<br>
<br>When Labour unexpectedly became the government in March 1974, Heffer agreed to become minister of state for industry, but was sacked by Wilson when he insisted on making an anti-EEC speech during the 1975 referendum, a privilege the prime minister had limited to cabinet ministers. On his eighth attempt in October 1975 he was elected to Labour's national executive committee (NEC), squeezing off Denis Healey. As chairman of its organization committee, he invited those who did not accept clause 4 to leave the party. He always opposed any action against Militant. He urged Commons reforms, including a freedom of information act. He opposed Scottish devolution. In January 1980 he boasted: &#145;I was the only [Labour] Opposition Member who attacked the Soviet Union for going into Afghanistan&#146;  (personal knowledge). He was also prominent in support of the solidarity movement in Poland. Egged on by his ego and the Militants in his constituency&#151;who he feared might turn against him&#151;he aimed higher. In 1980 he wanted to contest Labour's leadership against James Callaghan, until Michael Foot became the left's accepted candidate. He came close to contesting the deputy leadership against Denis Healey in 1981, but did not want to cut into the vote of Tony Benn, who came close. That year Heffer came third in the constituency section of the NEC and was also elected to the shadow cabinet, becoming Michael Foot's spokesman on Europe. In 1983 he stood as the hard-left candidate for the leadership, winning 6.3 per cent of the vote, against 72.3 per cent for Neil Kinnock and 19.3 per cent for Roy Hattersley. His political decline began when, at Labour's 1985 annual conference, Kinnock launched his blitz against Liverpool's Militant Tendency. Heffer walked indignantly off the platform, prompting Kinnock to remark that &#145;he was looking for a walk-out part&#146;. Next year he lost his seat on the NEC. The following year, complaining Labour was being &#145;sold to the public like soap powder&#146;, he was the third runner-up. Next year he teamed up under Tony Benn to challenge Labour's Kinnock&#150;Hattersley leadership. Against Hattersley's 66.8 per cent and John Prescott's 23.7 per cent, he won 9.5 per cent.<br>
<br>In 1989 Heffer announced he would not stand again, letting friends know that he had terminal cancer. He made his peace with friends on the left he had alienated by becoming the puppet of Militant. But he died battling against Labour loyalists such as his successor as MP for Liverpool Walton, Peter Kilfoyle. In his last two years he wrote four books, including an autobiography, <span class="italic">Never a Yes Man</span> (1991). He died of cancer of the stomach at his London home, 704 Keyes House, Dolphin Square, Pimlico, on 27 May 1991. He was survived by his wife; there were no children of the marriage. A memorial service was held at St Margaret's Church, Westminster, on 10 July 1991.<br>
