<span class="headword">Macdonell <span class="st"> [Macdonnell]</span>, Sir  James</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1857), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, third son of Duncan Macdonell (<i>d</i>. 1788), chief of clan Macdonnell of Glengarry, and his wife, Marjorie Grant, and brother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17453/', "Colonel Alexander Ranaldson Macdonell")</script> of Glengarry, was born at Glengarry House, Inverness-shire. He entered the army as ensign in an independent company in 1793. He became lieutenant in the 78th Ross-shire Buffs on its formation in 1794, captain-lieutenant in the 101st (Colonel Fullarton's) the same year, and captain in the 17th light dragoons on 1 December 1795, in which regiment he commanded a troop for nine years. In 1804 a new second battalion was formed for the 78th Ross-shire Buffs at Fort George, near Inverness, of which Macdonell was appointed one of the majors. He was with the battalion under Sir John Moore at Hythe, and served with it in Naples and Sicily, including the campaign in Calabria in 1806 and the battle of Maida, and in the unsuccessful expedition to Egypt in 1807, where he distinguished himself by surprising a Turkish battery near Alexandria. He became lieutenant-colonel in the 78th on 7 September 1809, and was briefly appointed to the Portuguese army staff. On 21 February 1811 he was made lieutenant-colonel of 2nd garrison battalion, and on 8 August of the same year he exchanged, as captain and lieutenant-colonel, into the 2nd foot (Coldstream) Guards. He served with the 1st battalion Coldstream Guards in the Peninsula from May 1812 to the end of January 1814, including the battles of Salamanca, Vitoria, Nivelle, and Nive, and commanded the 2nd battalion in the Netherlands from May to September 1814. He was made CB on 4 June 1815.<br>
<br>The night before the battle of Waterloo Macdonell was sent with some companies of his regiment and the 3rd (Scots) guards to occupy the ch&acirc;teau of Hougoumont, the garden and orchard of which were defended by other companies under Alexander George Fraser, Lord Saltoun. Macdonell received the duke of Wellington's high praise for the determination with which he held that post&#151;the key of the duke's position&#151;during sustained attacks by the French in the early part of the battle. On one occasion, when the French were forcing their way into the courtyard, Macdonell, who was wounded, and a small party of officers and soldiers closed the gates on them by sheer physical strength. For these services he was made KCB (20 April 1838) and received the Waterloo medal.<br>
<br>Macdonell served in the Coldstream Guards, of which he became regimental lieutenant-colonel and colonel in 1825, until he was promoted to major-general in 1830. He commanded the Armagh district from 1831 to 1838. He commanded the brigade of guards sent out to Canada when Lord Durham was appointed governor-in-chief there during the troubles of 1838. Macdonell succeeded to the command of the troops in Canada, which he held until promoted to lieutenant-general's rank in 1841. He became a full general in 1854, and was made GCB in 1855. He was a KCH (1837), had Austrian and Russian decorations, and was colonel in succession of the 79th (Cameron Highlanders) and 71st (Highland) light infantry. Macdonell died at 15 Wilton Place, London, on 15 May 1857.<br>
