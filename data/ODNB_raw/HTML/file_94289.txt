<span class="headword">Booth, Sir  David Alwyn  Gore-</span>  (1943&#150;2004), <span class="occ">diplomatist</span>, was born on 15 May 1943 in Washington, DC, USA, the older of the twin sons of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/31162/', "Paul Henry Gore-Booth (1909&#150;1984)")</script>, diplomatist, and his wife, Patricia Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Ellerton (1921&#150;2012), daughter of Montague Ellerton, originally from Adelaide in South Australia. At the time of his birth his father was a first secretary in the British embassy, later rising to be permanent under-secretary at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office; he was knighted in 1957 and made a life peer as Baron Gore-Booth of Maltby in 1969. The Gore-Booth family were of Anglo-Irish origin and it is curious that this father and son, both prominent in the British establishment, should have had a relative, Countess Markievicz (Paul's aunt), who was active in the Dublin rising of 1916. The Irish connection faded but for a time Gore-Booth <i>fils</i> thought he was in danger of inheriting a run-down house in Yeats's Lissadell.<br>
<br>Gore-Booth was educated at Eton College and at Christ Church, Oxford, where he read history and graduated with a second-class degree in 1964. On 27 June the same year he married Jillian Sarah Valpy, a 21-year-old interior decorator, and daughter of James Wyatt Valpy, a farmer in South Africa. They had a son, Julian, in 1968. They divorced in 1970 and on 7 October 1977 he married Mary Elisabeth Janet Gambetta (<i>b</i>. 1949), an interpreter, the daughter of Sir David Muirhead, ambassador successively to Peru, Portugal, and Belgium, and the former wife of Enrico Gambetta de Patrantonio, of Lima, Peru. This was an ideally happy union.<br>
<br>Gore-Booth had himself joined the diplomatic service in 1964, and was sent almost immediately to learn Arabic at the Middle East Centre for Arab Studies in the Lebanon. Two years later he was posted to Baghdad but his stay there was cut short by the breach of diplomatic relations over the Arab&#150;Israeli war of June 1967. After brief spells in Zambia and Libya he took over the Arab&#150;Israeli desk at the Foreign Office in 1971, where during the Arab&#150;Israeli war of October 1973 his performance was outstanding. He was rewarded with a posting as first secretary to the busy UK mission to the European Economic Community in Brussels. Next he was assistant head of the financial relations department in London and then, with early promotion to counsellor, head of the commercial section in the embassy at Jiddah. By now he had been fully recognized as a quick and efficient worker, unflustered in a crisis, and he was sent to a &#145;flier's&#146; job: head of chancery at the mission to the United Nations in New York. From there his rise was swift&#151;head of the policy planning department from 1987 to 1989, assistant under-secretary for the Middle East and the United Nations from 1989 to 1993, ambassador to Saudi Arabia from 1993 to 1996, and high commissioner to India from 1996 to 1998. He was appointed CMG in 1990, promoted to KCMG in the 1997 new year's honours, and made KCVO during the royal visit later that year.<br>
<br>Gore-Booth was frequently in the limelight. As assistant under-secretary he was the focus of a BBC television series which followed him in his various activities and carried on into his first weeks as ambassador in Riyadh. There his earlier experience of commercial work gave him an understanding of business and industry which made him popular with the British expatriates, and his lively personality won over the Saudis, who recognized both his competence and his credibility back home. Along the way, however, there were a number of scrapes. He was always conspicuous, always accessible to journalists, and his outspokenness provided the media with frequent stories. His indiscretions arose usually from his conviction that the Palestinians had been unjustly treated, that Israeli policies were not helpful to the &#145;peace process&#146;, and that the British failure to criticize those policies was damaging to the national interest. The gradual swing in public and governmental opinion towards an understanding of the Palestinians' plight made his views more acceptable but he had already been classified as a member of the so-called Arabist mafia in the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. There was, too, another incident that put him in the spotlight: he was harshly interrogated and criticized by the Scott tribunal inquiring into the sale of arms to Iraq. He felt he was unjustly treated, and his sense of grievance was shared by Lord Howe, the former foreign secretary, who had received similar treatment. Moreover his self-confidence and his background of Eton and Oxford made him vulnerable to charges of arrogance and privilege from critics who disliked his views. In fact he was always kind and considerate, especially to his juniors. But the charges followed him and he was hurt.<br>
<br>Gore-Booth's transfer to New Delhi offered an escape from obloquy. His father had held the same post forty years before and was remembered with respect. There he might get away from association with what the press called the &#145;camel corps&#146;; and a trouble-free tour would leave him ready for the job on which he had set his sights and for which he was admirably fitted, that of permanent representative at the United Nations in New York, almost the top of the diplomatic tree. Alas for theory. After a good start the Indian press took against him. He was &#145;regularly described&#146;, he noted, &#145;as a hunting, shooting, fishing aristocrat&#146;, though he had never &#145;held a rein, a rod or a gun&#146; in his life  (private information). Worse, during the queen's visit in 1997 there was public friction between him and the new foreign secretary, Robin Cook, who rejected his advice on how to handle the sensitive question of Kashmir. Moreover, the prospect of New York was blocked by the appointment of a contemporary. Disenchanted, in 1998 he decided to take early retirement and recorded his feelings in a characteristically frank valedictory dispatch.<br>
<br>During his time in Saudi Arabia, Gore-Booth's talent had been spotted by the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation and in 1999 he was made a special adviser to the group chairman. He quickly mastered balance sheets and interest rates and was deployed on the boards of various affiliates, including HSBC Bank Middle East and the British Arab Commercial Bank. In one bank he even became chairman of the audit committee, a remarkable appointment for a layman. Based in London, he was prominent as a committee man, lecturer, and consultant in many organizations that valued his regional experience, among them the Middle East Association, <span class="italic">Middle East International</span> magazine, the Windsor Energy Group, and the British Syrian Society. All was now going well; but in 2003 cancer of the oesophagus was diagnosed and after a year of exhausting treatment he died at the Chelsea and Westminster Hospital on 31 October 2004. Thus a career which had always sparkled, had suffered a few hiccups and one serious setback, and had finally blossomed, came to a premature end. His memorial service at St Margaret's, Westminster, on 16 March 2005 attracted a host of mourners. He was survived by his wife, Mary, his son from his first marriage, and a stepson.<br>
