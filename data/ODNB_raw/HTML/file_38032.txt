<span class="headword">Sulivan,  Laurence</span>  (<em>c.</em>1713&#150;1786), <span class="occ">director of the East India Company and politician</span>, is thought to have been the illegitimate son of Philip O'Sullivan (<i>bap</i>. 1682, <i>d</i>. 1737) of co. Cork, Ireland. Nothing is known of his life until he went to India. By 1739 he is recorded as a private merchant in the East India Company's settlement of Bombay. He was appointed to the company's service in 1741. For the next twelve years he held various administrative posts in Bombay and became a member of the council for the settlement in 1752. Having accumulated a comfortable fortune, he returned to Britain in 1753 with his wife, Elizabeth Owen (<i>d</i>. 1782). Elizabeth is likely to have been the daughter of Edward Owen of the company's service; the couple had married in 1739, and had at least one surviving child, their son Stephen.<br>
<br>Although Sulivan bought an estate at Ponsbourne in Hertfordshire, he spent most of his time in London, living for many years in a house in Queen Square. In 1755 he was elected to the court of directors of the East India Company. From then until his death some thirty years later, except for an interval of six years between 1772 and 1778, Sulivan was more or less continuously a director. He had three spells as chairman and three as deputy chairman. At such times his domination of the company was virtually complete. He was accused of being &#145;dictator&#146; over it  (Bowen, 99). Even when he was not formally responsible for them, the company's affairs were the main interest of his life. His concern for the company led him to seek seats in parliament, first at Taunton (1762&#150;8) and then at Ashburton (1768&#150;74).<br>
<br>At any time in the eighteenth century management of the East India Company's complex concerns was a formidable task, but the years from the 1750s to the 1780s were a period of tumultuous upheavals. In addition to managing its trade, its directors had to sustain wars in Asia, to try to devise means of governing newly conquered Indian provinces, and to cope with the demands of the national government and of parliament for an ever greater measure of control over the company. The difficulties which the directors faced were greatly exacerbated by constantly recurring struggles for power within the company itself. To gain and maintain his hold over the company Sulivan had to become a formidable politician, and he inevitably made many enemies. These tended to portray him as being concerned with little more than his own power. There can, however, be no doubt that he was devoted to what he considered to be the company's interests and to finding appropriate solutions to the unprecedented problems facing it.<br>
<br>Sulivan later wrote that his power over the company had been &#145;absolute&#146; from 1757 to 1763  (letter to his son, 27 Feb 1778, Bodl. Oxf., MS Eng. hist. c 472, fol. 4). During that period he had co-operated closely with the government in the war against the French and in the subsequent peace. In 1763, however, his authority over the company was challenged by Robert, Baron Clive, the conqueror of Bengal. Their antagonism, which had much more to do with a clash of temperaments than with deep issues of principle, convulsed the company and drew national political factions into supporting one side or the other. In 1764 Sulivan was worsted. He staged a counter-attack, which brought him back into power in 1769, but at the price of a financial disaster from which he never recovered; money was borrowed to buy shares with which to create votes for the election of directors at a time when the value of the company's stock collapsed. In the early 1770s he promoted the career of Warren Hastings as a reforming governor of Bengal, but he was unable to prevent a major loss of the company's autonomy when the government took powers over it in the <span class="roman">Regulating Act</span> of 1773. The government of Lord North, which he had opposed in 1773, encouraged Sulivan to take on the management of the company yet again in 1780. He was engaged in a new round of organizing the company's war effort and parrying political threats to it virtually until the time of his death. By then his beloved company had survived and had even acquired an imperial role, which Sulivan had never envisaged. The price of survival had, however, involved a cession of power to the government, which he deplored.<br>
<br>In 1778 in a letter to his son Sulivan described himself as having once been &#145;wild, dissipated and favorite with both sexes&#146;. After his marriage he had reformed, filling the day with unremitting attention to business and spending &#145;almost every evening of my life with my family&#146;. In twenty-five years he had not been &#145;ten times in a tavern, eight times in a coffee house&#146;. The happiness he believed that he enjoyed he attributed to &#145;method, regularity and constantly measuring our whole time in habitual but commendable pursuits&#146;  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Eng. hist. c.269). He died, probably in London, on 21 February 1786, and was buried at St George the Martyr, Queen Square, London.<br>
