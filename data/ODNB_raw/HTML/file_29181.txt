<span class="headword">Wheatley,  Benjamin Robert</span>  (1819&#150;1884), <span class="occ">bibliographer</span>, born in London on 29 September 1819, was the eldest son of Benjamin Wheatley, an auctioneer in Piccadilly. His half-brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/38397/', "Henry Benjamin Wheatley")</script> was a well-known historian. Wheatley was educated at King's College School, London, and after leaving, at the age of just seventeen, he prepared a catalogue for his father of the twelfth part of the huge library of the bibliophile Richard Heber, which was published in 1841.<br>
<br>Wheatley became a professional cataloguer and indexer, highly productive, accurate, and organized. He was judicious in the classification and arrangement of works, modifying the essentially pragmatic Paris system of classification to suit the character of the library in which he was working: his principles were explained in a paper entitled &#145;Desultory thoughts on the arrangement of a private library&#146;, which appeared in 1878 in the <span class="italic">Library Journal</span>. In 1843 he catalogued a portion of the library of the Athenaeum, under the supervision of C. J. Stewart, the bookseller. In 1844 he catalogued the library of Charles Shaw-Lefevre (afterwards Viscount Eversley) at Heckfield in Hampshire, and in 1845 the remains of the library at Hafod in Cardiganshire collected by Thomas Johnes, the translator of Froissart. In the same year he catalogued the library of the Geological Society, and in 1846 that of the numismatist Charles Richard Fox in Addison Road, Kensington, and the collection of the Mancunian Jacobite John Byrom at Kersal Cell (published 1848). During his stay at Manchester he made the acquaintance of the lawyer and antiquary James Crossley and of other literary figures. Between 1847 and 1850 Wheatley catalogued, among others, the libraries of the marquess of Lansdowne at Bowood in Wiltshire, and in Lansdowne House, Berkeley Square, of the Royal College of Physicians, and of the Army and Navy Club.<br>
<br>From 1850 to 1851 Wheatley was engaged in compiling an index of subjects to supplement the catalogue of authors at the Athenaeum library; it was printed in 1851 and served as a model for several subsequent indexes. In 1852 he catalogued the libraries of the Travellers' and the Oxford and Cambridge clubs, and in 1853 that of the United Service Club and the Dugald Stewart collection, bequeathed to the club by his son Colonel Matthew Stewart. In subsequent years Wheatley catalogued various other libraries, including that of the privy council office and that of Lady Charlotte Guest at Canford Manor, Dorset. In 1854 he made an index to the first fifteen volumes of the Statistical Society's <span class="italic">Journal</span>; he continued to make the indexes of the annual volumes until his death.<br>
<br>In 1855 Wheatley was appointed resident librarian of the Royal Medical and Chirurgical Society, for whom he had worked as early as 1841. From this date he ceased to work on library catalogues, with the exception of one with bibliographical notes which he subsequently prepared for the Royal College of Physicians. In 1857 he completed an index to Thomas Tooke's <span class="italic">History of Prices</span> (1838&#150;57). He also made two printed catalogues of the Royal Medical and Chirurgical Society's library in 1856 and 1869, and two indexes of subjects in 1860 and 1879; the edition of 1879 was a useful guide to medical literature. In addition, he found time to make a manuscript catalogue of the collection of engraved portraits of medical people in the possession of the society, with short biographies of 900 of the individuals portrayed. He also compiled indexes to the <span class="italic">Transactions</span> of the Pathological and Clinical societies of London which were published in 1878 and 1880 respectively.<br>
<br>Wheatley was one of the organizing committee of the conference of librarians, and served on the first council. He occasionally acted as vice-president of the Library Association. Its Wheatley medal is awarded annually for the best British index. He also contributed articles on bibliographical subjects to the <span class="italic">Transactions and Proceedings of the Conference of Librarians</span>, the <span class="italic">Monthly Notes of the Library Association of the United Kingdom</span>, <span class="italic">The Bibliographer</span>, and the <span class="italic">Library Journal</span>. Wheatley was an amateur poet as well as a bibliographer, and printed several of his poems privately, including <span class="italic">Buds of Poesy</span> (1838). He died in London, unmarried, on 9 January 1884, in his rooms at 53 Berners Street, the premises of the Royal Medical and Chirurgical Society. His sister Maria, herself a spinster, had lived with him for many years.<br>
