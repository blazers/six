<span class="headword">Gilliam,  Laurence Duval</span>  (1907&#150;1964), <span class="occ">radio producer</span>, was born on 4 March 1907 in Fulham, London, the younger son of Ernest William Gilliam (<i>d</i>. 1943), a businessman, and his wife, Beatrice Bishop (<i>d</i>. 1946). Educated at the City of London School (1918&#150;25) and Peterhouse, Cambridge (1925&#150;8), Laurence Gilliam worked first with the Gramophone Company in various capacities, and later as a freelance journalist, actor, and producer before joining the editorial staff of the <span class="italic">Radio Times</span> in 1932. He transferred to the BBC drama department a year later, where he worked on the development of special feature programmes which wove sound, words, and music together to create an aural picture. From 1933 until the end of his life he was responsible for the world-wide Christmas day programmes which preceded the monarch's address. These programmes were the BBC's technically most complicated assignment, linking the Commonwealth outposts with Broadcasting House in London via elaborate world-wide link-ups. Another notable example of Gilliam's early technical ambition was <span class="italic">'Opping 'Oliday</span>&#151;a &#145;sound picture&#146; of hop picking in Kent&#151;which he produced in 1934 using the newly established mobile recording van.<br>
<br>Val Gielgud, head of drama, transferred responsibility for features to Gilliam in May 1936, though features really came into their own during the Second World War. While much of the BBC saw broadcasting as a means of escaping from the blitz, Gilliam saw the possibilities for the medium to reflect the reality of war. In his major topical series <span class="italic">The Shadow of the Swastika</span>, which documented the rise of Nazism, Gilliam demonstrated the power of the factual documentary for propaganda purposes and offered the first challenging piece of work from the BBC since the outbreak of war. Gilliam had a natural sympathy for the journalistic approach to broadcasting, and his war work reflected these instincts. As one of the two editors (with Donald Boyd) of <span class="italic">War Report</span>, he helped to create a revolutionary technique on which all news reporting has since been based, taking the microphone to the fighting line to report back to the people at home nightly, in record time. In recognition of this outstanding war record, features became a separate department at the end of the war, with Laurence Gilliam as its head, and Gilliam himself was appointed OBE.<br>
<br>Throughout the post-war period&#151;the &#145;golden age of radio&#146;&#151;Gilliam did more than anyone in the BBC to recruit and encourage poets and writers to contribute work for the BBC features department. He maintained proudly that the feature was the one unique form that radio had achieved in its short history; and it was largely due to him that features came to stand for so much that was vital, contemporary, experimental, and above all &#145;pure radio&#146;. He showed a gift for leadership which inspired devoted loyalty in a group of the most talented writers and producers in radio history, including Louis MacNeice, Douglas Cleverdon, Leonard Cottrell, Jennifer Wayne, Christopher Sykes, W. R. Rodgers, Francis Dillon, Nesta Pain, Wynford Vaughan Thomas, Alan Burgess, and D. G. Bridson. As Douglas Cleverdon discovered, Gilliam would always rather back a project that had a chance of success than reject one that might fail: &#145;He was also a <i>bon viveur</i>, unpunctual, extremely good company, and a tower of strength to his subordinates&#146;  (Cleverdon, &#145;The art of radio&#146;).<br>
<br>Large, ebullient, and generous-minded, with his wiry grey hair Gilliam was broad in every sense of the word, a man of inspiring integrity whose approach to programme making, as to all things, was larger than life. There was a flamboyance about Gilliam which impressed everyone who came into contact with him and quickly earned him the nickname Lorenzo the Magnificent. He combined a lack of respect for authority with a supreme confidence in the value of the work for which he was responsible. While his tastes were catholic and he enjoyed the good things of life, he was always more interested in people than in things.<br>
<br>In 1940 Gilliam married Marianne Helweg (1914&#150;1976), a Dane whose father, Jacob Helweg, had immigrated to Britain in the 1920s to take up a lecturing position at the University of London. The couple met at the BBC, where Marianne had been a plays reader. She and Laurence had three sons and one daughter; the eldest was found at the age of four to have a mental handicap and was committed to a mental home soon after the war. They lived in Highgate, Middlesex, until the marriage was dissolved in 1952, when Marianne moved in with Bertie (W. R.) Rodgers, who worked for Gilliam. Rodgers, the engaging poet-minister from Armagh who had become a features producer in 1946, resigned from the features department in 1952 as a result of the relationship.<br>
<br>By the early 1960s the features department was under threat from the BBC managers as television began to encroach upon radio and Gilliam was offered early retirement. For twenty years he had acted as the buffer between his team of idiosyncratic producers and the administrators, keeping his team on a very loose rein. Gilliam still maintained his faith in radio, but as the end of features department was being discussed, his health was deteriorating. Laurence Gilliam died of cancer of the kidneys on 15 November 1964 in St Andrew's Hospital, Dollis Hill, Middlesex, where he was convalescing after an operation.<br>
<br>The development of features by the BBC, if not actually the creation of Laurence Gilliam, owed more to him than to any other single individual. In the early days of broadcasting he was among those who championed the possibilities of the medium as new, exciting, almost limitless in its possibilities. And throughout his life he maintained his belief in radio and its importance in linking world-wide communities. The establishment and direction of BBC features were Gilliam's life's work&#151;and became very largely his life. Unfortunately, early in 1965, a few months after his death, the BBC's features department was disbanded.<br>
