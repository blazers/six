<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Ngakane,  Lionel</span>  (1928&#150;2003), <span class="occ">actor and film director</span>, was born in Pretoria, South Africa, on 17 July 1928. His parents worked as teachers and, after moving to Johannesburg in 1936, his father set up a hostel for young delinquents with Alan Paton. Politically active from an early age, Ngakane joined the ANC youth league with Oliver Tambo and Nelson Mandela. It was around this time that his passion for cinema began. One day his father came home with a 35 mm projector as a present for his son. Ngakane then collected small strips of film and projected them onto a wall at home, upsetting his family when the film burned in the projector. At Fort Hare University College and the University of the Witwatersrand he studied political philosophy, geography, and &#145;native administration&#146;, but these hardly prepared him for his job as head of wheels (maintenance) on the Johannesburg buses. From 1948 to 1950, as a freelance journalist, he contributed to <span class="italic">Zonk</span> and <span class="italic">Drum</span>, two of South Africa's most successful black journals, and it was as a journalist that he came to Britain, to interview the film director Zoltan Korda (brother of Sir Alexander Korda). It was Korda who offered Ngakane his first acting role, as Absalom Kumalo, the &#145;lost&#146; son of the village priest, in his film version of Alan Paton's novel <span class="italic">Cry, the Beloved Country</span> (1951).<br>
<br>Settling in Britain, and encouraged by Korda, Ngakane planned to become a film-maker; but he faced difficulties. The South African government refused to sponsor him. To earn a living he continued acting, but work was not regular. In the mid-1950s he acted in a few British films made on location in Africa with titles such as <span class="italic">Duel in the Jungle</span> (1954), <span class="italic">Safari</span> (1956), and <span class="italic">Odongo</span> (1956), but he felt that these exploited Africa and provided nothing more than exotic backdrops for visiting Hollywood stars. However, working on these films enabled him to learn something about the technical side of film-making. In 1962 Ngakane released his first film:<blockquote>The result of experimenting with my 16mm camera was a short film called <span class="italic">Sunday in London</span>, and this gave me the confidence to make a film by myself. I visited my home in South Africa and made a seventeen-minute documentary called <span class="italic">Vukani/Awake</span> [1962], the first film about the political situation in South Africa made from an African's point of view. Subsequently, it was shown all over the world during the anti-apartheid campaigns. (Bourne, 129&#150;30)</blockquote>For his second film Ngakane turned his attention to the situation of Britain's post-war African-Caribbean settlers. The result was <span class="italic">Jemima and Johnny</span> (1966), filmed in 35 mm in black and white, with no dialogue. Ngakane said that this short drama about the friendship between a black girl and a white boy was inspired by the French film classic <span class="italic">The Red Balloon</span> (1955):<blockquote>It was the official entry for Britain in the Venice Film Festival, and won first prize for Best Short Feature. I was thrilled that we had won first prize for Britain, and confident that I would make more films. I had high hopes, but I never had one offer, or enquiry. (Bourne, 130)</blockquote>By the 1970s <span class="italic">Jemima and Johnny</span> had disappeared from view but in the late 1980s it was given a new lease of life by June Givanni of the British Film Institute's African-Caribbean unit. Shown on Channel 4 television, and distributed on video, the film enjoyed new-found popularity and gave recognition to Ngakane as one of Britain's pioneer black film-makers.<br>
<br>After the 1960s Ngakane became a founder member of two important institutions in African cinema: the Pan-African Filmmakers Federation (FEPACI) and the Pan-African Film and Television Festival of Ouagadougou (FESPACO), both of which encouraged links between Africa and Europe. In 1986 his film biography of Nelson Mandela, <span class="italic">Mandela</span>, was screened by Channel 4 and in 1989 he worked as the technical adviser to the director Euzhan Palcy on her film <span class="italic">A Dry White Season</span>. He returned to South Africa in 1994 and continued to work hard to raise the international profile of African film-making in general and South African film-makers in particular; he was widely acclaimed as &#145;the father of South African film&#146;, and as June Givanni later said, &#145;his inspiration and support were always forthcoming and of immeasurable value&#146;  (<span class="italic">Black Filmmaker</span>). Until he died in Rustenburg, South Africa, on 26 November 2003, he divided his time between attending film festivals in an advisory role and serving on the board of directors of the Film Resource Unit in the University of Natal.<br>
