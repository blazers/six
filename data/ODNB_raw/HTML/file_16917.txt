<span class="headword">Loder,  George</span>  (1816&#150;1868), <span class="occ">conductor and composer</span>, was born in Bath, the son of George Loder, a flautist, and his wife, Fanny Philpot, a piano teacher and the sister of the pianist Lucy Anderson. His uncle was the violinist and publisher John David Loder. In 1836 he went to the USA. After residing for some years in Baltimore, in 1844 he became principal of the New York Vocal Institute; he was also a prominent member of the Philharmonic and Vocal societies, which he had helped to establish there. He played the double bass for the Philharmonic Society for five seasons, and occasionally conducted the society's orchestra, a notable occasion being the first American performance of Beethoven's ninth symphony (20 May 1846).<br>
<br>In 1855 Loder went to Australia with the soprano Anna Bishop, and settled in Adelaide as conductor of Lyster's opera troupe. In 1859 he was again active in London&#151;as organist, singer, conductor, and composer; on 11 June he conducted the revival of the opera <span class="italic">Raymond and Agnes</span> by his cousin Edward Loder. In 1861 he published <span class="italic">Pets of the Parterre</span>, a comic operetta, which had been produced at the Lyceum and Adelphi theatres, and in 1862 <span class="italic">The Old House at Home</span>, a musical entertainment staged also at the Adelphi.<br>
<br>Loder's music was perhaps more popular in America than in Britain. <span class="italic">The New York Glee Book</span> (1843), written for the New York Vocal Institute and reissued as <span class="italic">The Philadelphia and New York Glee Book</span> in 1864, contains many of his original partsongs. He also published <span class="italic">The Middle Voice</span>, <span class="italic">Twelve Solfeggi</span> (1860), and various individual songs and instrumental pieces both in England and America. Loder paid a second visit to Australia, and died, after a long illness, at Adelaide on 15 July 1868.<br>
<br>His sister <a name="cosubject_60936"></a><span class="headword">Kate Fanny Loder</span>  (1825&#150;1904), a successful <span class="occ">pianist and composer</span>, was born in Bath on 21 August 1825. In 1844 she became a professor of piano at the Royal Academy of Music, where she had previously studied. Among her compositions were works for the piano, notably the <span class="italic">Twelve Studies</span> of 1852, an orchestral overture (1844), a string quartet (1848), and songs. On 16 December 1851 she married the surgeon <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36490/', "Henry Thompson (1820&#150;1904)")</script>, with whom she had a son and two daughters. Her husband was knighted in 1867 and created a baronet in 1899. She became paralysed after 1871, in which year the first performance in England of Brahms's <span class="italic">German Requiem</span> was given at her house. She died at Headley, Surrey, on 30 August 1904.<br>
