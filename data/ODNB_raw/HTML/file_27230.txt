<span class="headword">Thomas,  John Wesley</span>  (1798&#150;1872), <span class="occ">Methodist minister, writer, and translator</span>, was born on 4 August 1798 in Exeter, the son of John Thomas, an Exeter tradesman and preacher, and younger brother of Elijah, who was also to enter the ministry. After a childhood revelation, at nineteen Thomas went to London, hoping to become a missionary, but instead he was selected for the itinerant ministry, and for the next half century passed between one and three years in twenty-six different British locations. Largely self-educated, Thomas acquired several languages, was a respected miniaturist, and wrote authoritatively on a wide variety of topics. His magpie mind acquired enormous general knowledge, exploited in frequent articles, notably for the <span class="italic">Wesleyan Methodist Magazine</span> and <span class="italic">Notes and Queries</span>, on subjects as diverse as William the Silent, Wesleyan hymns, and Cornish fairies. His first book was <span class="italic">An Apology for &#145;Don Juan&#146;</span>, really a satire against Byron's agnosticism, in a witty parody of his style. His major work, <span class="italic">The Trilogy, or, Dante's Three Visions</span>, was published by Bohn's from 1859, although extracts appeared as early as 1840. Retaining the original metre, with copious notes and even diagrammatic illustrations by Thomas himself, it is an impressive achievement. One of his aims was to prove that Dante's Christianity more resembled John Wesley's than Pius IX's; <span class="italic">Purgatorio</span> (1862) is dedicated &#145;To Garibaldi and the people of Italy&#146;.<br>
<br>Thomas was &#145;thin, and somewhat of a stooping form &hellip; His face, however, would at once fix attention&#146;  (Christophers, 345). This was certainly so in 1850 when he filled Dudley town hall to capacity, attacking the papacy. He also turned his satire against Mormonism; and against Bishop Phillpotts of Exeter in a poem, <span class="italic">The War of the Surplice</span> (2nd edn, 1871). An associate of Lord Brougham, he spent much time at Brougham Castle when minister at Penrith (1858&#150;61). John Wesley Thomas died at Dumfries on 7 February 1872, leaving his widow, Louisa, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Drayton, and a daughter and four sons, two of whom followed him into the ministry.<br>
