<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Dobbie, Sir  William George Shedden</span>  (1879&#150;1964), <span class="occ">army officer and colonial governor</span>, was born on 12 July 1879 in Madras, the younger child and only son of William Herbert Dobbie, of the Indian Civil Service, and his wife and first cousin, (Agatha) Margaret, only child of Colonel Robert Shedden Dobbie, of the Madras staff corps. He was a classical scholar at Charterhouse School, and was commissioned into the Royal Engineers in August 1899 from the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich.<br>
<br>At Woolwich, Dobbie joined the Plymouth Brethren and devoted much of his time to Sunday school and soldiers' welfare work. In 1904 he married Sybil (<i>d</i>. 1962), daughter of Captain Charles Orde-Browne of the Royal Artillery, a leading army evangelical. Her sister Mary was the mother of Major-General Orde Wingate. On marriage the Dobbies agreed to dedicate a tenth of their income to &#145;the Lord's work&#146;. Christian faith was the mainspring of Dobbie's life, and he personified the ideal of the officer as missionary propagated by Charles Kingsley. Dobbie and his wife had two sons, one of whom died on active service in 1944, and one daughter.<br>
<br>After training at the School of Military Engineering, Chatham, Dobbie served in the South African War (1901&#150;2) and then in Chatham (1904), Bermuda (1904&#150;7), Harwich (1907&#150;9), and Ireland (1909&#150;12), before passing top into the staff college at Camberley in 1912. At the outbreak of war in 1914 he went to France and took part in the campaigns of the Marne and Aisne. Thereafter his war service was entirely as a staff officer. Promoted lieutenant-colonel in 1916, he signed the order to the British expeditionary force ending hostilities on 11 November 1918.<br>
<br>The war had proved Dobbie's exceptional ability as a staff officer, and for nine of the ten following years he served in staff appointments in the Rhine army, Aldershot, the War Office, and western command. Promoted to command the Cairo brigade in 1928, he put down disturbances between Arabs and Jews in Palestine in 1929. From 1933 to 1935, as major-general, he commanded the Chatham area and the School of Military Engineering and was inspector, Royal Engineers. His last appointment before retiring in August 1939 was as general officer commanding Malaya and Singapore.<br>
<br>On the outbreak of the Second World War, Dobbie sought re-employment without success until in April 1940 he was asked by General W. E. Ironside to go to Malta as governor and commander-in-chief, in the rank of lieutenant-general. He arrived two months before the siege began in June. For two years the Italians and Germans launched air raids, blockaded the island to the verge of starvation, and kept it under constant threat of invasion. Dobbie shared the islanders' hardships and broadcast to and visited the people constantly. His belief in divine aid was evident to all.<br>
<br>By May 1942 Dobbie was worn out and was relieved by Viscount Gort, who brought with him the George Cross awarded to Malta by George VI. Dobbie was colonel-commandant, Royal Engineers, from 1940 to 1947, but was not actively re-employed and dedicated the remainder of his life to missionary work, serving on a number of Christian committees. In 1945 he published <span class="italic">A Very Present Help</span> and in 1948 <span class="italic">Active Service with Christ</span>.<br>
<br>Dobbie was appointed to the DSO in 1916, and was appointed CMG (1919), CB (1930), KCB (1941), and GCMG (1942). He received an LLD from the Royal University of Malta in 1942 and from Leeds University in 1944. Sir William Dobbie died at his home, 89 Coleherne Court, Kensington, on 3 October 1964.<br>
