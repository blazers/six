<span class="headword">Talbot,  George</span>  (1816&#150;1886), <span class="occ">papal official</span>, was born at Evercreech, near Wells, the third son in the family of five sons and four daughters of James Talbot, a lawyer and third Baron Talbot of Malahide (<i>c</i>.1768&#150;1850), and his wife, Anne Sarah (<i>d</i>. 1857), daughter of Samuel Rodbard of Evercreech in Somerset. After education at St Mary's Hall, Oxford (where he graduated BA in 1839 and MA in 1841), Talbot followed the familiar path of aristocratic younger sons to ordination in the Church of England, and in 1840 was appointed to a family living at Evercreech. He was received into the Roman Catholic church by Nicholas Wiseman in 1843 at St Mary's College, Oscott. He trained for the Catholic priesthood at Oscott alongside Edmund Stonor and Edward Howard. Both men were lifelong friends of his and also had influential careers in Rome. In June 1846 Talbot was ordained priest by Wiseman at Oscott. He applied to join the English Oratorian Congregation, newly formed by John Henry Newman, but was turned down in March 1847. Until 1849 he worked as a pastoral priest at the St George's Cathedral in Southwark, which he was reluctant to leave. However, through Wiseman's influence, he was appointed a canon of St Peter's, Rome, and a chamberlain to Pope Pius IX.<br>
<br>As a recent convert with only brief pastoral experience, Talbot's knowledge of the English Catholic scene was limited. Today he is best remembered for his view that the laity should be restricted to hunting, shooting, and entertaining  (Purcell, 2.318). However, he gained the confidence and friendship of Pope Pius IX and exercised considerable influence for the next twenty years. Despite the fact that the rector of the English College in Rome acted as agent for the English bishops, Talbot became a self-appointed and unofficial agent, working assiduously for Wiseman and Henry Edward Manning, and strongly supporting their ultramontane line.<br>
<br>Many other English bishops resented Talbot, and his frank letters to his close confidant Manning caused the latter to describe him in later years as &#145;the most imprudent man who ever lived&#146;. Manning's biographer, Edmund Sheridan Purcell, certainly made very free with Talbot's letters to Manning from Rome, thus providing Lytton Strachey with dubious ammunition for his hostile portrait of Manning in <span class="italic">Eminent Victorians</span> (1918). Talbot was implacably opposed to Newman, describing him as &#145;the most dangerous man in England&#146;. In the jurisdictional dispute between Wiseman and his coadjutor George Errington, Talbot sided against Errington and did all he could to bring about the coadjutor's eventual resignation.<br>
<br>Talbot's presence and his influence in Rome undermined that of successive rectors of the English College. He exercised increasing influence over the college, and in 1860 was appointed delegate protector. In 1852 he was mainly responsible for establishing within the walls of the English College the Collegio Pio, reorganized in 1898 and now known as the Beda College, for the training of convert and older clergy. In 1866 he launched an ambitious plan to rebuild the college chapel and began fund-raising with a donation of &pound;100 from the pope himself. By 1867 his influence was such that he was able to force the resignation of the rector in office and persuade the pope to accept his nominee.<br>
<br>However, Talbot's days close to the papal throne were by then limited. Worry over the funding of the rebuilding of the chapel, possibly combined with his capacity for intrigue, spilled over into a genuine mental instability, and in 1869 he was removed from Rome to an asylum for the insane in Bon Secours convent at Passy, a suburb of Paris. For many years the pope kept Talbot's apartments in the Vatican ready in case he should return. He died at Passy on 16 October 1886, and was buried quietly in the cemetery of P&egrave;re Lachaise.<br>
