<span class="headword">Byerley,  Maria</span>  (1787&#150;1843), <span class="occ">schoolmistress</span>, was the second daughter and fifth child of Thomas Byerley (1748&#150;1810), nephew, agent, and partner in the pottery works of Josiah Wedgwood, and his wife, Frances, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Bruckfield (1761&#150;1838). <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27319/', "Katherine Thomson")</script>, the writer, was her younger sister. For the first twenty years of Maria's life the family home was in London, first in Greek Street and then in Sloane Street. Tom and Frances Byerley, who had thirteen children altogether, were not good managers. While Tom's uncle Josiah was alive, he kept a tight grip on the finances of both the family and the firm; after his death in 1795 the fortunes of the Byerleys and of Wedgwood began to go downhill. In 1809 it was agreed that Maria and her elder sister, <a href="#cosubject_51764">Frances [<i>see below</i>]</a>, should try to support themselves by opening a school. A house was rented in Warwick High Street and the school opened its doors to five boarders and two day girls at the end of January 1810.<br>
<br>Despite leasing a second house the Warwick site was cramped and thought to be unhealthy. In 1817 the school moved to Barford House, 3 miles outside Warwick. In 1824 there was a final move to a house called Avonbank, 3 miles outside Stratford. There the school remained until the retirement of Maria and her sister Jane in 1841. It was taken on by the Misses Ainsworth and was still going strong in 1850.<br>
<br>Throughout all this, and the departure through marriage of four of her sisters, Maria was the anchorwoman, the constant presence. She was absent only for two spells of severe illness in 1813 and 1814. She managed the finances not only of the school but also of the family. Initial capital for the school had been raised against the security of legacies to the sisters under the wills of Josiah and Thomas Wedgwood. But pupils did not pay in advance, and until the move from Warwick there was a ceiling on expansion. Josiah Wedgwood the younger helped with loans and an allowance to Mrs Byerley. Maria wrote to him with quiet pride on 12 February 1823, &#145;I find after making a calculation of our profits this half-year that we are able to send the amount of our debt, I am sorry to say of so long standing, to you. I shall therefore feel very much obliged to you if you will permit your book-keeper to send me an account of all that is owing including interest, so that we may at length feel quite free&#146;  (Hicks, 70). She and her brother Samuel also took over the payment of an allowance to their mother.<br>
<br>On paper the school's curriculum was a conventional female one: &#145;Instruction in English Reading, Spelling, Grammar and Composition, in Geography &hellip; and in Ancient and Modern History&#146;  (Hicks, 14), with French, Italian, music, dancing, drawing, writing, and arithmetic as extras. However, it appears to have been taught to a standard sufficient to attract those enthusiasts for female education, the Unitarians. Although the Misses Byerley were Anglican, their pupils included Harriet Martineau's niece, Joseph Priestley's granddaughters Marianne and Sarah, sent over from America, Julia Leigh Smith, and from 1821 to 1826 Elizabeth Stevenson, the future novelist Mrs Gaskell.<br>
<br>Maria Byerley died of pneumonia at her sister Katherine's house, 30 Welbeck Street, London, on 2 April 1843. She bequeathed her property to her sisters &#145;for their separate use &amp; benefit independently &amp; exclusively of any present or future husband &amp; without being in any wise subject to his debts, control or management&#146;  (Hicks, 116). The character Maria Bouverie, the vicar's spinster sister in Katherine Thomson's novel <span class="italic">Constance</span> (1833), set in Warwick, is thought to be a portrait of her sister Maria.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_51764"></a><span class="headword">Frances Parkes <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Byerley; </span></span> <span class="st"> <em>known as </em>Mrs William Parkes]</span>  (1786&#150;1842), <span class="occ">writer</span>, was the first daughter and fourth child of Thomas and Frances Byerley. She opened the school in Warwick with Maria in 1810. On 21 June 1811 she married the Unitarian textile manufacturer William Parkes (1788&#150;1840). However his uncle's bankruptcy in 1817 brought William down too. They moved from Warwick first to Bloxham and then to Solihull. In 1825 Fanny published <span class="italic">Domestic duties, or, Instructions to young married ladies on the regulation of their conduct in the various relations and duties of married life</span>, which has generally been taken as reflecting the ethos of the Byerleys' school. It was a considerable success, going into five editions in fifteen years. In the later 1820s they moved to London, where William built up a solicitor's practice. Fanny died at Kilburn Priory, London, of heart disease on 13 September 1842. Two of her six children worked with Florence Nightingale in the Crimea, Maria as a nurse and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21352/', "Edmund Alexander Parkes")</script> as a doctor.<br>
