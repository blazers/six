<span class="headword">Peake,  Harold John Edward</span>  (1867&#150;1946), <span class="occ">archaeologist</span>, was born on 27 September 1867 at Ellesmere, Shropshire, the son of John Peake, vicar of Ellesmere, and his wife, Matilda Ann Marshall. Early training in estate management at Leicester gave him insight into the historical significance of changes of land tenure and land use and led to a valuable article on prehistoric roads in Alice Dryden, ed., <span class="italic">Memorials of Old Leicestershire</span> (1911).<br>
<br>In 1897 Peake married Charlotte Mary Augusta (<i>d</i>. 1934), daughter of Captain Richard Lane Bayliff, of the Royal Marine light infantry. There were no children. For their honeymoon the couple went round the world, spending some time on a ranch in British Columbia, where Peake gained an understanding of prehistoric pastoralism. They also studied art and ceramics in Japan and China.<br>
<br>On their return to England the Peakes kept an open house, on modest means, at their home at Boxford, Berkshire. From 1899 Westbrook House became a centre of leadership in archaeological and artistic efforts, the latter the special concern of Charlotte Peake, or Carli, as she was known. Francis Toye, a frequent visitor at Westbrook, remembered her as being &#145;interested in everything around her&#146;:<blockquote>she was a big woman in every sense, in stature, emotion, and sympathy, thus forming a perfect complement to her thin, very precise, and wholly cerebral husband. A more happy union of the arts and the sciences it would be difficult to conceive. (Toye, 44)</blockquote>Peake became the honorary curator of Newbury Museum, and developed a selected series of implements, pots, potsherds, and maps; in exhibiting these he allocated each century from 3000 <span class="smallcap">BC</span> equal space. The Newbury Museum became well known for its pottery and the series of exhibits were the basis of a published chronological work by Peake, issued soon after 1920.<br>
<br>In addition to serving on a number of local committees, Peake was the motive power behind the Newbury District Field Club and superintended its archaeological investigations. In a wider field he served as a member of the council, and from 1926 to 1928 as president, of the Royal Anthropological Institute, which awarded him its Huxley memorial medal in 1940. He also presided over the section on anthropology of the British Association in 1922, and from 1928 to 1930 he served as a member of the council of the Society of Antiquaries of London.<br>
<br>Peake studied intensely the distribution of evidences of the human past, always in relation to the environment of the place and the time, and the peoples concerned. In the opinion of O. G. S. Crawford, whose early career was strongly influenced by Peake, the latter had a &#145;rather too fertile&#146; imagination and was prone to &#145;theorizing and wild-cat schemes&#146;  (O. G. S. Crawford, <span class="italic">Said and Done</span>, 1955, 39, 64). But Peake's approach to the ancient past was essentially multidisciplinary, and he &#145;persistently upheld the need for emphasis on the unity of the various studies of man&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 24 Sept 1946). His catalogue of British prehistoric bronze implements, including some 17,000 entries, with measured drawings and data of location and so on, is in the care of the British Museum. His Gregynog lectures, published in 1922 as <span class="italic">The Bronze Age and the Celtic World</span>, attempted to relate archaeology and linguistics. In the same year he published <span class="italic">The English Village</span>, a stimulating study of social evolution. With Professor H. J. Fleure he collaborated in a series of books entitled <span class="italic">The Corridors of Time</span> (1927&#150;36, tenth and final volume, 1956), which attempted to synthesize approaches to the interpretation of archaeological data in terms of human evolution. In this study Peake pioneered research into the beginnings of cereal cultivation which, he held, occurred in Syria-Palestine and northern Mesopotamia. His papers in the <span class="italic">Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute</span> have lasting value. He also made an important contribution to the medieval section of the <span class="roman">Victoria county history</span> of Berkshire. He died at his home, Westbrook House, on 22 September 1946.<br>
