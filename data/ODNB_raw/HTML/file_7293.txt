<span class="headword">Davis,  Richard Barrett</span>  (1782&#150;1854), <span class="occ">landscape and animal painter</span>, was born at Watford, Hertfordshire, and baptized on 25 July 1782 at Hemel Hempstead, the eldest of the nine sons of Richard Davis (1750&#150;1825), who became huntsman to George III's private harriers in 1789, and his wife, Sarah. At the end of the eighteenth century the hunt moved to Windsor, and it was here that the king saw and admired some drawings by the young Davis. Sir Francis Bourgeois RA, landscapist to the king, did not take pupils but, when told it was the royal wish, he became Davis's tutor in 1804. It is also said that Davis studied under Sir William Beechey RA. Subsequently the young artist studied at the Royal Academy Schools, although he was not registered as a pupil. Davis had already exhibited a landscape at the Royal Academy in 1802, and two landscapes with cattle the following year. His progress and aptitude for animal painting was demonstrated by his picture <span class="italic">His Majesty in his Travelling Chariot Returning to Town from Windsor</span>, which was shown at the Royal Academy in 1805, and <span class="italic">Mares and Foals in his Majesty's Stud at Windsor</span> the following year. He started exhibiting at the British Institution in 1808 and at the Society (later Royal Society) of British Artists in 1827. At the last venue he regularly exhibited the maximum number of nine paintings allowed annually for the next ten years. He held various offices in the society, including briefly being president in 1832, ceasing to be a member in 1843. In 1828 he was made animal painter to George IV, and later held similar appointments to William IV and Queen Victoria. In 1831 he painted an enormous panoramic frieze (128 ft 4 in. long) of the coronation procession of William IV (Royal Collection).<br>
<br>William Henry Davis (<i>c</i>.1795&#150;1885), a younger brother of R. B. Davis, initially painted similar subjects to his brother, but later turned to scenes from Shakespeare. W. H. Davis exhibited paintings at the Royal Academy and British Institution between 1803 and 1849. He was appointed animal painter to William IV in 1837 and to Queen Victoria in 1839. R. B. Davis's daughter, Sara, painted portraits and six of her miniatures were shown at the Royal Academy between 1846 and 1854. The majority of R. B. Davis's paintings shown at the Royal Academy were of horses including, in 1840, <span class="italic">Portrait of the Hermit, Celebrated in the Royal Hunt, the Property of her Majesty</span>, followed in 1842 by <span class="italic">Portrait of Mr Davis, her Majesty's Huntsman, on the Hermit</span>. This was Charles Davis, another younger brother, who became huntsman to the royal buckhounds in 1822, and held that post for forty-four years until his death in 1866. Without doubt the royal patronage and associations with hunting brought many commissions to the industrious R. B. Davis. Despite exhibiting regularly at the Royal Academy for fifty years, he was never elected as an associate of the academy. His output was variable but his honest, if slightly dull, portraits of horses and riders set in recognizable landscapes and of other animals (his painting of hounds was particularly fine) afforded him a comfortable income at this stage of his life. In 1836, in conjunction with the print publishers A. H. Bailey &amp; Co., Davis started producing a series of prints of different hunts: <span class="italic">The Hunter's Annual</span>. This comprised pages of letterpress describing four contemporary packs of hounds, each with a hand-coloured lithographic equestrian portrait after paintings by the artist of their principal huntsman. These sets of four plates continued, in the series in 1838 and 1839, and in what was described as a second series, in 1841, <span class="italic">The Hunter's Annual</span> was in aquatint. A number of Davis's engagingly composed shooting scenes were also engraved, and he contributed thirty subjects for the <span class="italic">Sporting Magazine</span>. Towards the end of his life when Victorian morals led to hunting becoming less fashionable, commissions became fewer, as did the number of his paintings shown at the Royal Academy and the Society of British Artists. When he died on 13 March 1854, at his home, 9 Bedford Place, Kensington, London, as a result of a tetanus infection, he was a poor man, and left a widow, Lucy.<br>
