<span class="headword">Wood,  Thomas</span>  (1607&#150;1692), <span class="occ">bishop of Lichfield and Coventry</span>, was born in Hackney, Middlesex, on 22 July 1607, the third son of Thomas Wood (<i>d</i>. 1649), clerk of the spicery to James I, and his wife, Susan Cranmer (<i>d</i>. 1650). A scholar at Westminster School, he was a student at Christ Church, Oxford, from 1627, graduated BA on 27 April 1631, and proceeded MA on 24 April 1634. The following year he became rector of Whickham-on-Tyne, co. Durham, but he seems to have spent little time there, his only recorded activity as rector being the baptism of one Grace Clavering in 1636. A chaplain to the king, in 1641&#150;4 he was occupying the November turn. He proceeded BD at Oxford on 15 May 1641, and DD on 13 March 1642.<br>
<br>In 1645 the committee for compounding noted that neither Wood nor his curate, Pescote, had taken the covenant. Ejected from his rectory for scandal on 4 June 1651, he later claimed that the cause was his being a royal chaplain; the ejection was confirmed on 12 June 1655 and a successor, Cuthbert Stote, was admitted four months later. For at least some of this decade Wood lived abroad on family money.<br>
<br>After the Restoration, Wood regained Whickham by order of the House of Lords on 18 June 1660. He also became a canon of Durham that year and for a while was fairly assiduous in his residence in the area. In 1666 he married the same Grace Clavering he had previously baptized: the daughter of Sir James Clavering of Axwell Park, Newcastle, she belonged to one of the leading local families. Three years earlier, while retaining his prebend at Durham, he had become dean of Lichfield; there he was both neglectful of his duties and at odds with his bishop, John Hacket. The quarrel escalated to the point where Hacket deprived Wood of all say in the restoration of Lichfield Cathedral and, when he remained obdurate, excommunicated him publicly. Wood retaliated in 1668 by getting the court of arches to excommunicate the bishop. Archbishop Gilbert Sheldon privately sympathized with Hacket over his difficulties with his &#145;most untractable and filthy natured dean&#146;  (Spurr, 192), but concerned that public dissension would only provide ammunition for nonconformists and others disposed to criticize the church, intervened to effect a <i>modus vivendi</i>. In 1669 Wood became particularly assiduous in his Durham duties.<br>
<br>Following the death of Bishop Hacket on 28 October 1670 and after much backstairs negotiation, Wood's elder brother Sir Henry obtained the bishopric for him through the influence of Barbara Villiers, duchess of Cleveland, whose daughter Mary was about to marry Sir Henry's son. Wood was enthroned in 1671, but continued his previous behaviour. Scandalized by his neglect of duty, Sheldon was thinking of suspending him but died in 1677 before this could be effected. Archbishop William Sancroft finally suspended him in July 1684, but only after priming Bishop Francis Turner of Rochester to put the case tactfully at court and to establish that &#145;the King and Duke abandon the bishop as sordid and refractory&#146;  (Spurr, 191). The suspension remained in force until Wood was brought to submission in 1687. Wood had excused himself from residing in his diocese on the grounds that he had no house in which he could dispense episcopal hospitality: Sancroft handed the sequestrated income to the dean, Lancelot Addison, with a commission to erect such a house. The splendid result is the only episcopal residence in Europe known to have been built as a punishment of the resident, but though Wood was forced to accept it, he succeeded in avoiding residing there.<br>
<br>Wood died at Astrop Wells, Northamptonshire, on 18 April 1692 and was buried at Ufford, Suffolk, four days later. In his will he remembered only his college and his family homes, after making provision for his wife, there being no children. He left money to found an almshouse for ten old women in Hackney, and another for ten old men at Ufford, and a sum of &pound;200 for the poor of Hackney, as well as a sum of &pound;3000 for the use of the junior masters of Christ Church and a further estate of &pound;200 p.a. in Norfolk for their maintenance.<br>
