<span class="headword">Su&aacute;rez de Figueroa <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Dormer]</span>,  Jane</span>, duchess of Feria in the Spanish nobility  (1538&#150;1612), <span class="occ">noblewoman and courtier</span>, was born at Eythrope, near Waddesdon in Buckinghamshire, on 6 January 1538, one of the two daughters of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/95014/', "Sir William Dormer")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/95013/', "Pelham, Dorothy, Lady Pelham")</script>] and his first wife, Mary Sidney. She was brought up by her maternal grandparents after her mother's death in 1542. She then lived with her grandmother Jane, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Newdigate, Lady Dormer, until admitted into the household of Princess Mary some five years later. As a child she played frequently with Edward VI at the instigation of her grandfather Sir William Sidney, Edward's chamberlain and tutor, but it was Mary Tudor's favour that proved fundamental to her rise. She was one of the nine ladies and maids who attended the queen at her coronation in September 1553 and thereafter received a number of gifts as one of the queen's &#145;welbeloved women&#146;. Her kinship with some of the most important aristocratic families made her valuable, but it was her efficiency and trustworthiness that particularly appealed to the queen, who on her deathbed charged her to take her jewels to Elizabeth. There is also good evidence of her striking looks. According to a poet, &#145;Dormar is a darline and of suche lively hewe that who so fedes his eyes on her may sone her bewte vue&#146;  (BL, Cotton MS Titus A xxiv, fol. 83<i>v</i>). Her portrait was one of the examples of female beauty in Philip II's main picture gallery in Spain.<br>
<br>
<script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/70578/', "G&#243;mez Suarez de Figueroa, count (from 1567 duke) of Feria")</script>, met Jane in 1554 when he arrived with Philip II in England for the king's marriage to Queen Mary. Feria was the king's favourite at the time, and he remained a key political figure as well as a leading household official until his death in 1571. Despite strong opposition from his own family, but with the king's full support, Feria sued for Dormer's hand in 1558, lavishing jewels and gifts on Mary's courtiers. He remained committed to the match after Mary's death, although he knew that Elizabeth I would not favour her predecessor's servants any more than her faith. The wedding took place on 29 December 1558 and was the only high-ranking union between English and Spanish courtiers to result from the brief reign of Philip II in England.<br>
<br>The count of Feria left England in May 1559 and Jane followed in July, both taking a number of Catholic nobles and clergy with them. It was the beginning of a lifelong commitment to English and Irish Catholic exiles. They stayed briefly in the Low Countries, where she gave birth to their son Lorenzo on 28 September 1559. They departed in spring 1560, making a spectacular and princely progress through the Low Countries and France (where they met Mary Stewart) to Spain, where the monarchs officially welcomed them. Jane's grandmother, Lady Dormer, meanwhile established herself in Louvain, where her home became an important base for Elizabethan Catholic exiles. Once in Spain, the Feria household acted as a magnet for the English, Irish, and Scottish communities, whom they protected and aided. They devoted substantial personal resources to the endeavour, and were generous in hospitality and almsgiving. Feria put their political and military proposals at court, and promoted their suits for offices and pensions. Both spouses were ardent supporters of the Jesuits, whom Feria had tried to introduce into England in the 1550s, and were instrumental in helping to set up the Jesuit training colleges that were to change the face of English Catholicism. Owing to his long sojourn in England and the privileged information and contacts provided by his wife's kin, Feria became the most prominent adviser on English matters at the Spanish court. As a result, the activities of the Feria household were closely observed and discussed throughout Europe, especially by those eager to fathom Philip II's policy towards England.<br>
<br>It was the death in 1571 of both her husband (on 7 September) and her formidable grandmother that brought Jane, now duchess of Feria, into the limelight and made her the main object of attention for the increasingly divided Elizabethan exile community. Feria left her in a position of power as tutor to their sole surviving son and in control of his extensive estates during Lorenzo's minority. Philip II's favour to the family remained unshaken, and this enhanced her value within the Spanish court, where she was trusted to provide good information on Queen Elizabeth and was recognized as a leader of the exiles. Her importance at this juncture was increased by circumstance: clashes between Elizabeth and Philip II, reinforced by immense pressure from the papacy, persuaded the king on two occasions in 1570 and 1571 of the need for an aggressive campaign against England. But he encountered strong opposition from his advisers in the Low Countries and especially from the governor, the duke of Alba, who persuaded Philip II to pull back from the brink of war. Realizing the importance of neutralizing the opposition of the Low Countries, some English exiles petitioned Philip II to send Jane there. They belonged to the group most closely associated with Rome which had wanted an aggressive policy towards England since 1559. Some hoped she might even replace Alba as governor of the Low Countries. Philip II did not approve the plan. He wanted to come to an accord with Elizabeth, and for a time in 1576 he even ejected the exiles from the Low Countries. Yet he remained sympathetic and responsive to the petitions Jane and her longtime associate Sir Francis Englefield made for money and help for the exiles, and this made her a significant player in the patronage network of the Spanish court.<br>
<br>Although she had a firm character and above average intelligence, the duchess of Feria found herself at the centre of political intrigues whose complexity and international dimensions often eluded her. She remained closely associated with the &#145;Roman&#146; exile contingent despite being approached by other individuals and factions, and it was they who most benefited from her regular information from England and Ireland. Throughout the 1570s Gregory XIII worked hard to secure Philip II's backing for an attack against Elizabeth as proposed by the adventurers Thomas Stucley and James fitz Maurice, and he encouraged his nuncios in Spain to make use of Jane's influence. She too approved these plans and tried to advance them by all means possible. In 1578 she even sold two statues of the Virgin, which had been rescued from St Paul's, to help them purchase arms and munitions. The papal nuncio believed, wrongly, that she had a secret understanding with her uncle Sir Henry Sidney for him to defect from his command of Elizabeth's troops in Ireland and help fitz Maurice's invasion in 1579. A year later the remnants of the invasion force were trapped at Smerwick, surrounded by loyal and implacable Elizabethan troops. Jane forwarded their request for help to Philip II. This close association with papal policy towards England and the additional pressure she brought to bear on the king did not always endear her to the Spanish court, nor was her support of the various plots linked to Mary Stewart always approved of. While she remained a respected figure, she exerted no real influence over the king's policy. Nevertheless, to Elizabeth and her council she always appeared dangerous.<br>
<br>Significantly, we hear little of Jane in connection with the Armada campaign (1585&#150;8). Her political role had been reduced since 1579, when Sir Francis Englefield settled in Spain and took over the business relating to patronage and pensions for the exiles. Shortly afterwards William Allen established strong, if not unchallenged, leadership over the exiles. Once Philip II decided to act against Elizabeth after 1585, the exiles had a direct line to the king and council without need for her intervention. But as soon as they realized that Philip II was wavering from his commitment to fight Elizabeth in 1590, the exiles once again turned their attention to the duchess of Feria, particularly because Lorenzo had no desire to play the Englishman in Philip's court or take up his parents' role in this respect. In the 1590s, her prominence reasserted, she became involved with such shady characters as Francis Dacre, whose dubious activities at the Spanish court discredited her for a time. Her sister Anne, Lady Hungerford, who had taken refuge in the Low Countries in 1571, also came under the baneful influence of one of the many factions among the exiles, and notably of the adventurer Thomas Morgan. In 1593, and at their instigation, Anne took up the campaign to persuade Philip II to send Jane to the Low Countries so that she might lead the exile community and threaten Elizabeth. Jane was enthusiastic, failing to appreciate that this scheme was primarily intended to reduce the influence of her friends and collaborators Englefield and Allen, and to agitate for an aggressive policy towards England which would not meet with approval at the Spanish court. The duke of Feria successfully countered these proposals. Although by 1593 he too was under the influence of an English exile, Thomas Fitzherbert, Feria was a senior official of Philip II whose primary aim was not to risk the honour or finances of his house or threaten its future by undermining his own career. He believed the plan would be disastrous for his mother, who would become the butt of vicious attacks by dissident exile factions, as Allen and Englefield had been. He doubted whether it would have a significant impact on Elizabeth and was aware that the office would be a serious drain on the family's resources. He dismissed as shady intriguers those who had advanced the proposal, not sparing his aunt Lady Hungerford. The king and council of state agreed with him. Lady Hungerford nevertheless continued for over two years to argue for Jane's appointment, and the duchess remained eager to take it up. Her son opposed it with even greater force, and as a result their relations were tense and sour for years.<br>
<br>This disappointment did not deter Jane from making further attempts to influence Philip II's English policy, and she continued to act on behalf of the exiles. In 1596 she presented the king with a document which Persons, Englefield, and the Jesuit Joseph Creswell also signed, requesting that Philip II should make a public declaration to the effect that his eldest daughter, Isabel, was the rightful claimant to the throne of England. In a separate document that year, largely drawn up by Persons, the king was also urged to set up a special mixed council for English affairs in the Low Countries; but significantly there was no suggestion that Jane should be there. Unwilling to exacerbate relations with England while his forces were stretched by the wars against the Dutch and French, Philip II rejected both requests. Thereafter Jane continued with her pious benefactions and good works towards the exiles, but was either less active or more circumspect in political matters. Even after the death of Allen and Englefield, it was evident that she would not be able to take their place at the helm of the exile community. Evidence remains of further, fitful activity: in 1600, for example, she wrote to James VI urging him to embrace Catholicism. It was James's accession to the English throne in 1603 that once again focused attention on her, but now as the shining symbol of the Anglo-Spanish amity that both courts were eager to re-establish. The papacy, as ever, missed no chances. In 1603&#150;4 vague plans were hatched in Rome to send her as a lady-in-waiting to Queen Anne, and the question was raised by Lord Howard of Effingham on behalf of the queen when he visited Spain in May 1605. The duke of Feria vetoed the plan, believing that it would put his mother in an invidious position, since her presence at the English court would nurture the wildest expectations from the Catholics, and he did not believe that Philip III would help them. Although she outlived her son by five years, her failing health and the new alliance with England combined to keep her out of major international politics in the years before her death on 13 January 1612. She was buried on 26 January at the monastery of Santa Clara at Zafra.<br>
