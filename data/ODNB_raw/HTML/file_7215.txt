<span class="headword">Davidson,  James</span>  (1793&#150;1864), <span class="occ">antiquary and bibliographer</span>, was the eldest son of James Davidson (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1748, <i>d</i>. after 1802) of Tower Hill, London, a stationer and printer and deputy lieutenant of the Tower, and Ann, his wife, only daughter of William Sawyer of Ipswich. He was born at Postern Row, Tower Hill on 15 August 1793. On 6 March 1823 he married Mary, the only daughter of Thomas Bridge of Frome St Quentin, Dorset; they had two sons and three daughters.<br>
<br>When nearly thirty years old Davidson bought the estate of Secktor, near Axminster in Devon, and enlarged the small cottage there. Here he lived for the rest of his life, interesting himself in Devon antiquities in general, but concentrating especially on the topography and history of the parishes in and around the valley of the Axe. His works on this district were: <span class="italic">The British and Roman Remains in the Vicinity of Axminster</span> (1833); <span class="italic">History of Axminster Church</span> (1835); <span class="italic">History of Newenham Abbey, Devon</span> (1843), an abbey about a mile south of the town of Axminster; and <span class="italic">Axminster during the Civil War</span> (1851). Davidson's sole excursion into general literature consisted of <span class="italic">A glossary to the obsolete and unused words and phrases of the holy scriptures in the Authorised English Version</span> (1850), a valuable compilation in its time. He published in 1861 a selection of <span class="italic">Notes on the Antiquities of Devonshire, from before the Norman Conquest</span>, and he left behind in manuscript four volumes of notes on almost every church in Devon, the results of many country rambles. His most significant work was, however, the <span class="italic">Bibliotheca Devoniensis: a Catalogue of the Printed Books Relating to the County of Devon</span> (1852) and its supplement (1861). It did not include a bibliography of the works of Devon authors but within the limits of Davidson's scheme it was an accurate and complete catalogue. Davidson spared neither pains nor expense, and the libraries in London and the universities were fully checked. His extensively annotated copy of the bibliography is in the Westcountry Studies Library, Exeter. He was a regular contributor to <span class="italic">Notes and Queries</span>. In 1859 he published a series of antiquarian papers in <span class="italic">Pulman's Weekly News</span>, and an article by him entitled &#145;British antiquities at Winford Eagle, Dorset&#146; appeared in the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> in 1827. George Oliver acknowledged his assistance with the section on Newenham Abbey in his <span class="italic">Monasticon diocesis Exoniensis</span> (1846).<br>
<br>Davidson died at Secktor House, Axminster, on 29 February 1864, and was buried in the cemetery of that town; his wife survived him. Many of his manuscript compilations passed into the hands of Joshua Brooking Rowe, who bequeathed them to Exeter City Library. Davidson's eldest son, <a name="cosubject_7216"></a><span class="headword">James Bridge Davidson</span>  (1824&#150;1885), a <span class="occ">lawyer</span>, who shared his antiquarian interests, was called to the bar at Lincoln's Inn in 1850 and from 1865 worked as a law reporter for chancery and equity cases. He died unmarried at 1 Raymond's Buildings, Gray's Inn, London, on 8 October 1885, aged sixty-one. He was the author of many papers, but did not publish any work separately. Many of the books included in the Secktor House library, which was formed by the father and the son, were sold by William George of Bristol in 1887. The extensive collection of Devon pamphlets was bequeathed to the Plymouth Institution. A catalogue was published in 1894 but the collection was destroyed during the Second World War.<br>
