<span class="headword">Sherborn,  Charles Davies</span>  (1861&#150;1942), <span class="occ">geologist and scientific bibliographer</span>, was born on 30 June 1861 at 5 Gunter Grove, Chelsea, London, the eldest child of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36062/', "Charles William Sherborn (1831&#150;1912)")</script>, a metal-engraver and etcher, and his wife, Hannah Simpson Wait 
    (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Davies; <i>d</i>. 1922)
  . He was educated at local schools from the age of three, but left St Mark's College School, Chelsea, at fourteen in order to work in a fashionable stationers. (Sherborn always maintained that this experience of the book trade was invaluable for his later bibliographical work.) During 1884&#150;5, when on the continent, he availed himself of the opportunity to attend lectures and meet distinguished zoologists and geologists. Over the next decade, employed in various clerical positions throughout London, he pursued his interests in books, antiquities, and natural history. Access to the exhibits and libraries of London's museums enabled Sherborn to further his knowledge of many subjects.<br>
<br>As a young man, Sherborn accompanied many distinguished geologists on their excursions. In the 1880s he was engaged by T. Rupert Jones to assist in the preparation of material for monographs on Tertiary Entomostraca (1889) and Crag Foraminifera (1895&#150;7). This grounding in scientific methods, together with his interest in natural history, persuaded Sherborn to seek a career in science. His association with Rupert Jones had other benefits apart from their joint publications of 1887, 1888, and 1889; it resulted in further introductions to many geologists. He assisted William Topley in editing the <span class="italic">Geological Record</span> for 1884&#150;5 and then became editor himself for the 1885&#150;8 volume. In June 1888 Sherborn began his long association with the British Museum (Natural History) when Dr Henry Woodward engaged him to mount and prepare fossils in the collections of Sloane, K&ouml;nig, Sowerby, and Phillips. Between 1892 and 1899 he served on the editorial committee of the critical monthly journal <span class="italic">Natural Science</span>.<br>
<br>With limited resources for fieldwork, Sherborn devoted his spare time to producing indexes and reference works. <span class="italic">A Bibliography of the Foraminifera</span> (1888) was followed by <span class="italic">An Index to the Genera and Species of Foraminifera</span> (1890), both published in America. He then collaborated with Arthur Smith Woodward in compiling <span class="italic">A Catalogue of British Fossil Vertebrata</span> (1890), and he was asked to catalogue the collections and library of the Geological Society of London. He then became involved in sorting the papers of Sir Richard Owen for the eventual biography by Revd R. Owen (1894). Between 1894 and 1908 he undertook a survey of the zones of the White Chalk of the English coast with Arthur Walton Rowe and was largely responsible for their publication. Inspired by the <span class="italic">Index Kewensis</span> Sherborn undertook to provide a complete list of all generic and trivial names given to recent and fossil animals from the time of Linnaeus, together with references to the date and place of their publication. <span class="italic">The Index animalium, 1758&#150;1850</span> became the basis for zoological nomenclature and was compiled single-handed over forty-three years. The first volume (1758&#150;1800) was published in 1902 and the ten volumes 1800&#150;1850, published under the auspices of the British Museum (Natural History), were completed in 1933. During its preparation, Sherborn published numerous bibliographic papers that verified the dates and history of many works and periodicals. This information was incorporated by B. B. Woodward into his <span class="italic">Catalogue of Books &hellip; in B. M. (N. H.)</span> (1903&#150;15).<br>
<br>Sherborn joined the Geologists' Association in 1883, and became a fellow of the Geological Society (1887) and the Zoological Society (1890), and an associate of the Linnean Society (1912). He was made a life member of both the Zoological Society (1907) and the Geologists' Association (1924) for his services. In 1890 he was awarded the Geological Society's Lyell fund for his bibliographical work and received the Foulerton award from the Geologists' Association in 1922. In 1931 he received an honorary DSc from Oxford University. After helping to found the Society for the Bibliography of Natural History in 1936, he became its first president. Sherborn particularly enjoyed his membership of several select dining clubs of these professional societies for the regular opportunity they gave for scientific discussions.<br>
<br>By living a relatively spartan life, Sherborn was able to collect books, Byzantine bronze coins, and antiquities of all kinds. His deep concern that these objects should rest with &#145;those who could best appreciate them&#146;  (Norman, <span class="italic">Nature</span>, 150, 1942, 146) led to numerous donations to institutions. He also ensured that the library of the British Museum (Natural History) acquired many of the works it lacked. His encyclopaedic knowledge, wit, and generosity were widely acknowledged. Like his alleged antipathy to women (especially their attendance at society meetings), his later gruff and brusque manner was essentially a cloak that could be shed when its protection was unnecessary.<br>
<br>After his health declined in 1938, Sherborn's attendance at the British Museum (Natural History) lessened, but even in the 1940s he maintained a weekly visit. He collapsed in his bath following a heart attack on the morning of 22 June 1942 and died that afternoon at his home, 49 Peterborough Road, Fulham, London. His remains were cremated at Golders Green crematorium on 26 June. He was unmarried and was survived by two brothers.<br>
