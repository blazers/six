<span class="headword">Fuller,  John</span>  (1757&#150;1834), <span class="occ">politician and eccentric</span>, was born on 20 February 1757 at North Stoneham, Southampton, Hampshire, the only son of Revd Henry Fuller (1713&#150;1761), rector of North Stoneham, and his wife, Frances (1725/6&#150;1778), his cousin, and daughter of Thomas Fuller of Catsfield, Sussex. The <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/47494/', "Fuller family")</script>, originally cloth merchants in London, were Sussex landowners, ironmasters, and gun-founders, with sugar plantations in the West Indies. Their sources of wealth were reflected in the family motto <i>carbone et forcipibus</i> (&#145;By charcoal and tongs&#146;). John, who had lacked a steadying influence following the death of his father when he was still a young boy, was educated at Eton College (1767&#150;74). On reaching adulthood he inherited a vast fortune when, on the death of his uncle, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/42077/', "Rose Fuller")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/47494/', "Fuller family")</script>], in 1777, the family estate at Rose Hill, Brightling, near Burwash, Sussex, together with the property in Jamaica came into his possession. From this date he established himself as the local squire determined to make a name in the eyes of posterity.<br>
<br>Through family influence Fuller obtained the parliamentary seat of Southampton, which he held from 1780 to 1784 as a supporter of Lord North's administration. Mrs Thrale observed his rough and boisterous manner, though he rarely spoke in debates. From 1778 he was a captain in the Sussex militia, his chief interest, and he later led a troop of the Sussex yeomanry cavalry at the crucial period of the French invasion threat during the Napoleonic war. He was high sheriff of Sussex in 1796&#150;7. After a lapse of seventeen years he was returned to parliament in July 1801 as a county member for Sussex. By then Fuller's extravagant behaviour and blunt outspokenness had become pronounced, his wild, intemperate, and frequently absurd interventions in debates making him an object of mirth. A vocal representative of the sugar planters, he declared in reply to William Wilberforce in a debate on the slave trade (30 May 1804) that the living conditions of West Indian slaves were &#145;equal, nay, superior to the condition of the labouring poor of this country&#146;  (<span class="italic">Hansard 1</span>, 2, 1804, 459). He defended the duke of York in 1809 and attacked sinecures, proclaiming his own independence; legend had it that he declined an offer of a peerage from Pitt as a threat to his integrity, asserting &#145;I was born Jack Fuller, and Jack Fuller I will die!&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 106).<br>
<br>On 27 February 1810 Fuller achieved notoriety when, drunkenly entering the Commons while the inquiry into the Walcheren expedition was in progress, he interjected various absurd questions to the earl of Chatham. On being ignored he exclaimed, &#145;God d&#151;n me Sir, I have as much right to be heard as any man who is paid for filling the place he holds&#146;. It took the serjeant-at-arms and four messengers to overpower him and remove him from the chamber, on the orders of the speaker, whom he had addressed as &#145;the insignificant little fellow in the wig&#146;  (HoP, <span class="italic">Commons, 1790&#150;1820</span>, 4.848). After spending two days in custody he apologized to the house, and was reprimanded, an outcome regarded by some as excessively lenient.<br>
<br>Fuller retired from parliament at the dissolution in 1812 and settled on his Sussex estate. There he made the contributions to the age of folly building, then already on the wane, for which he is remembered. His first such effort, a Coadestone summer house with a &#145;Tudor&#146; archway, was built in 1803 (restored 1992). Seven years later, and in the churchyard at Brightling so that it was visible from his windows, he commissioned his own mausoleum, a 25 foot high pyramid with a wall tablet inside bearing Thomas Gray's lines, &#145;The boast of heraldry, the pomp of power&#146;. At the same time rose the rotunda garden temple which, together with its Doric columns and dome, now forms a backdrop to the matches played by the Brightling Park cricket club. A mystery surrounds the obelisk standing 646 feet above sea level at the north-west of Brightling Park, for which no record exists except that &#145;Mad Jack&#146; (as he came to be known) built it. The observatory, designed by Sir Robert Smirke, was built between 1810 and 1818 simply because the squire of Brightling was a keen amateur astronomer who previously had no adequate means for studying the heavens. About 1828 he built a tower at Brightling as an observation point from which to view the repairs to Bodiam Castle, 6 miles away, which he purchased in that year and saved from ruin. Finally he erected the Sugar Loaf, the epitome of folly building, which stands 35 feet high in a field on the Battle&#150;Heathfield road. Fashioned in the shape of a cone (the contemporary way of retailing sugar, linked with his Jamaican interests), it was said to have been built as a result of a wager.<br>
<br>Anything but mad, and only mildly eccentric, Fuller had a purpose in most of his follies, not least to provide local employment, the reason for the 4 miles of stone wall he had erected around Rose Hill. He also commissioned the building of the predecessor to the Beachy Head lighthouse and donated a lifeboat to the inhabitants of Eastbourne. His patronage of the arts included several commissions to J. M. W. Turner. He was a generous benefactor of the sciences, endowing before his death two professorships, in anatomy and physiology, and chemistry, at the Royal Institution (known as the Fullerian chairs). He never married, having been rejected at the age of thirty-three by Susanna Thrale, a daughter of Henry and Hester Thrale. Fuller died at his London residence, 36 Devonshire Place, on 11 April 1834. Twenty-four private carriages attended the funeral cort&egrave;ge from London to his burial in the pyramid tomb in Brightling churchyard on 18 April.<br>
