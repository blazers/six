<span class="headword">Ball,  Francis Elrington</span>  (1863&#150;1928), <span class="occ">author and historian</span>, born on 18 July 1863 at Portmarnock, co. Dublin, was the third son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1218/', "John Thomas Ball (1815&#150;1898)")</script>, lord chancellor of Ireland from 1875 to 1880, and his wife, Catherine (<i>d</i>. 1887), daughter of the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8756/', "Revd Charles Richard Elrington (1787&#150;1850)")</script>, regius professor of divinity in the University of Dublin. For health reasons, he was educated by a private tutor, and was not sent to Trinity College, Dublin, although his father was vice-chancellor of the university.<br>
<br>Ball began his career working for the Unionist cause in Ireland. His distaste for speaking on the platform kept him in the background; but it became generally recognized that the organization of the Unionist Party in Ireland and many of its successes at the polls were largely due to his efforts. In 1897 he married Florence Eglantine (<i>d</i>. 1913), daughter of the Revd William Arthur Hamilton DD, rector of Taney, Dundrum, and canon of Christ Church, Dublin. After his marriage his house became a leading Dublin social centre. The couple had no children.<br>
<br>At the general election of 1900 Ball stood for South County Dublin as an independent Unionist, in opposition to Sir Horace Plunkett, the official Unionist candidate. Ball polled a respectable number of votes, but the result of the split was that the seat was gained by the nationalists.<br>
<br>Ball then decided to abandon politics for letters, and it is as a writer, and scholar, rather than as a politician, that he is remembered. In 1902 he collaborated on <span class="italic">The Calendar of the Manuscripts of the Marquess of Ormonde</span> for the Royal Commission on Historical Manuscripts, and later that year published the first part of his <span class="italic">A History of the County Dublin</span> (six parts, 1902&#150;20). At the time it was the authoritative local history, and was republished in 1979 and 1993. In 1909 he edited C. Litton Falkiner's <span class="italic">Essays Relating to Ireland</span>, and wrote a memoir.<br>
<br>Ball had begun some preliminary work on Swift's letters with Falkiner before his death in 1908, and in 1910 he published volume one of <span class="italic">The Correspondence of Jonathan Swift, D.D.</span>, the sixth and last volume of which appeared in 1914. It was the first scholarly edition, painstakingly annotated, and it established his reputation as the greatest authority on Swift of his time, while also winning him respect as a historian. A new edition was published in 1971. As J. H. Bernard commented in his introduction to the first volume, &#145;a study of [the Correspondence] is indispensable to anyone who wishes to understand the intrigues of political parties during the first half of the eighteenth century&#146;  (Bernard, &#145;Introduction&#146;, xix). In recognition of Ball's achievement, the University of Dublin conferred upon him the honorary degree of LittD in 1911.<br>
<br>Ball's wife Florence died in 1913, and five years later, troubled by the advent of home rule, he left Dublin for London, where he divided his time between the British Museum and the Carlton Club. He became a member of the Royal Society of Antiquaries of Ireland, and turned from Swift to an entirely different subject, <span class="italic">The Judges in Ireland, 1221&#150;1921</span>. His historiography reflected his political convictions: for Ball, Irish history was the history of the &#145;civilising influence&#146; of the English on Ireland's native culture. He explains his Unionist project in his preface: his history of the Irish judges deals solely with &#145;the seven centuries during which the authority of England was absolute in their appointment&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>). Since much of Ball's information was gathered from documents which perished in the burning of the Irish Records Office in 1922, his work has become the primary authority. It was issued in the <span class="roman">Lawbooks Recommended for Libraries</span> series in 1927, and reprinted in 1993.<br>
<br>In the last two years of his life, Ball was working on a commentary on Swift's poetry. He returned to Dublin, where he died at the Fitzwilliam Nursing Home, Pembroke Street, on 7 January 1928. His work on Swift was in its final stages, and was published posthumously as <span class="italic">Swift's Verse: an Essay</span> in 1929, and reissued in 1977. <span class="italic">Notes and Queries</span> praised it as a &#145;solid and important work in the elucidation of Swift&#146;, adding that &#145;students of the period will know precisely what services Dr Ball's researches have rendered&#146;  (p. 125).<br>
