<span class="headword">Holt,  Emily Sarah</span>  (1836&#150;1893), <span class="occ">novelist and author of religious tracts</span>, was born at Stubbylee, Lancashire, and baptized on 25 June 1836 at Bacup, Lancashire, the second daughter and third child of John Holt (<i>d</i>. 1856) of Stubbylee Hall, landowner, and his wife, Judith, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Maden (<i>d</i>. 1843). She accompanied her widowed father and brother to Oxford, where they lived while her brother was pursuing his undergraduate studies. She was educated at home by a governess; her later writings indicate that she was well read, especially in history and literature, with a strong emphasis on the English past and the history of the Christian church.<br>
<br>Her brother James Maden Holt (1829&#150;1911) succeeded to the family estates on their father's death in 1856. For the rest of her life she lived in her brother's household, first in Kensington, London, and subsequently at Balham Hill, Surrey. Her first publication, <span class="italic">Memoirs of Royal Ladies</span> (2 vols.), appeared in 1861. It was one of many collective biographies of women published in the nineteenth century. Most of these works focused on great and famous figures; Holt, however, provided biographies of largely unknown or little-noticed women who were not always good role models. Several, such as Jeanne de Valois and Charlotte de Montmorency, were forced to marry for political or dynastic reasons; nearly all suffered from a loveless or a brief marriage. For an introduction to such women as Ela de Rosman, Alicia de Lacy, Joan of Kent, or Constance, second wife of John of Gaunt, this work is still probably a useful starting place. The essays are documented and show a wide knowledge of the sources.<br>
<br>Holt's next published work was <span class="italic">Mistress Margary: a Tale of the Lollards</span>, which appeared in 1868. This was the first of forty-five books which were published regularly until 1897. They were historical novels for girls aged about ten to sixteen. Published by John F. Shaw, these books were clearly successful. They move at a brisk pace and incorporate historical information while telling a story of everyday life, families, love, and marriage to which girls could relate. An indication of their long print life was given by the advertisements for variously priced editions included with each new publication. The more expensive editions were touted as gift books, the less expensive as Sunday school prizes.<br>
<br>These works were based on Holt's historical research; she usually acknowledged her sources in the preface and often pointed out which characters were entirely her own invention and which were based on fact. Girls and women were always leading characters in these books. Her message to her readers was consistent: what females do is important; marriage is not their only option. A forced or a mercenary marriage is not likely to be successful. Holt's other message, also stressed by her good female characters and their male counterparts, was a total commitment to evangelical Anglican Christianity. Heroes and heroines were persecuted, imprisoned, even killed for their beliefs, but in the end they were victorious either on earth or in heaven.<br>
<br>Holt was adamantly opposed not only to Roman Catholicism but also to the Puseyite movement in the Church of England. This outlook of low-church protestantism was shared by James Maden Holt, who held office in the Church Association and the Trinitarian Bible Society, and sat as Conservative MP for North-East Lancashire from 1868 to 1880, opposing the disestablishment of the established church in Ireland, while supporting legislation in 1874 to suppress ritualism in the Church of England. Her <span class="italic">Memoirs of Royal Ladies</span> hints at anti-Catholicism, although as a historian the author admitted that most of the women she included had no alternative to Rome. More strident was the preface to <span class="italic">Robin Tremayne of Bodmin: a Story of the Marian Persecution</span> (1872), in which she wrote, &#145;For 43 years [since the emancipation of Roman Catholics in 1829] England has been creeping gradually closer to the outstretched arms of the great enchantress&#146;. Given her religious opinions, it is not surprising that the fourteenth, fifteenth, and sixteenth centuries were the periods on which she most frequently focused. She wrote about the Lollards, several other medieval proto-reform movements, and the religious upheavals of the Tudor era. She also created books out of several medieval legends, such as that of Thomas Becket's mother, as well as such unlikely subjects as Piers Gaveston.<br>
<br>Holt published a book about medieval daily life as well as a biography of John Wyclif. In <span class="italic">Light in the Darkness</span> (1896) she returned to collective biography, in this case of King Alfred and other Englishmen. She died, unmarried, at 49 Balham Hill, Surrey, on 25 December 1893.<br>
<br>Holt is scarcely ever noticed in works about nineteenth-century children's literature. When she is mentioned it is only as a minor Sunday school writer. While there is certainly a didactic religious tone to her books, she was also telling a good and, so far as she could, historically accurate story. It is probable that she influenced at least as many girls as did Charlotte Yonge, and she may also have inspired in many girls an interest in history.<br>
