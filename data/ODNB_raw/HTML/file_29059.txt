<span class="headword">Wentworth,  Thomas</span>, first earl of Strafford  (1672&#150;1739), <span class="occ">diplomatist and army officer</span>, the second son and surviving heir of Sir William Wentworth (<i>d</i>. 1692) of Northgate Head, Wakefield, Yorkshire, and the grandnephew of Thomas Wentworth, the minister of Charles I, was born at Stanley Hall, near Wakefield, and baptized on 17 September 1672. His father was the son of William Wentworth of Ashby Puerorum, Lincolnshire, who died at Marston Moor, and his mother, Isabella (<i>c</i>.1653&#150;1733), the daughter of Sir Allen Apsley, the treasurer of the household of James, duke of York. Isabella, who gave birth to four girls and five boys, served as lady of the bedchamber to James II's queen, Mary of Modena.<br>
<br>His mother's position helped secure Wentworth's appointment as page of honour to the queen consort in 1687. The next year he switched allegiances and careers; he followed his brother into the military service of William III and served as cornet (31 December 1688) in the expedition against Lord Dundee. His bravery during the Nine Years' War, particularly at the battles of Steenkerke (1692) and Landen (1693) and at the siege of Namur (1695), secured his appointment as aide-de-camp to the king in August 1692, promotion to guidon and major in the first troop of Life Guards (4 October 1693), cornet, first major (20 January 1694), groom of the bedchamber (6 May 1695&#150;8 March 1702), and colonel of the Royal regiment of dragoons (30 May 1697 &#150; June 1715). After 1697 he served in the military only intermittently, although he was later promoted brigadier of the horse (7 January 1703), major-general (1 January 1704), and lieutenant-general (1 January 1707). He served under Marlborough in Flanders in 1702, and during one skirmish had his horse shot from under him. In 1706 he narrowly escaped being captured by the French while on a foray near Menin. The loss of three brothers in war did not diminish his enthusiasm; his elder brother, William, died in 1693 from a fever contracted while on guard duty, and his two younger brothers, Paul and Allen, were killed in action respectively at the siege of Namur in 1695 and in the storming of Li&egrave;ge in 1702.<br>
<br>Wentworth was always importuning the court for some honour or promotion. Upon hearing the news of his elder brother's death, he immediately rode to Breda to request his sibling's former position but arrived too late. The need to secure his fortune may partially account for his unabashed self-seeking. On 16 October 1695, on the death of his cousin William, earl of Strafford, Wentworth succeeded to the peerage as fourth baronet and third Baron Raby. Although he inherited the title, the earl had bequeathed most of his estates to his nephew Thomas Watson, the son of Lord Rockingham.<br>
<br>A courageous man, Raby enjoyed the challenge of battle and claimed to have &#145;often repented the hour I left the army&#146;  (Raby to Marlborough, 8 March 1710, BL, Blenheim MSS, M37, Berlin), and later regretted &#145;being in inaction when all the world is in arms&#146;  (Raby to Cadogan, 16 Feb 1709, BL, Add. MS 22196, fol. 181). His physical courage was unquestionable, as illustrated by his having singly attacked a wild boar while hunting which nearly killed him. Although he left the army to embark on a diplomatic career, at least one contemporary thought that he carried that spirit into the antechamber of the court and &#145;rushed an enterprize like a colonel of dragoons&#146;  (Roussel, 1.284).<br>
<br>Raby's diplomatic career began when he accompanied the duke of Portland to Paris in 1698. In March 1701 William III dispatched him to Berlin to convey his congratulations to the elector Frederick III of Brandenburg on the latter's becoming king in Prussia as Frederick I. The success of that mission led to his appointment in 1703 as envoy and in 1706 as ambassador-extraordinary to Brandenburg-Prussia, where he served until April 1711. His suspicions that John Churchill, duke of Marlborough, was circumventing him at Berlin, first through Friedrich Wilhelm von Grumbkow, who served as liaison officer to Marlborough and to Dutch officials during the War of the Spanish Succession (1702&#150;13), and later through special emissaries such as General Francis Palmes, were not unfounded. Raby became increasingly jealous of Marlborough's authority, and relations between the two men deteriorated. Their estrangement undermined Raby's position at court and aggravated the difficulties inherent in his position. Marlborough's remark that Raby was &#145;both impertinent and insignificant&#146;  (Marlborough to F. Godolphin, 31 May 1709, BL, Add. MS 9105, fol. 60) was coloured by that rivalry.<br>
<br>Despite Marlborough's assessment, Raby was shrewd enough to understand the political and personal maze of intrigues at the Berlin court and to exploit them in order to secure Prussian troops for the coalition against France. However, his alliance with the prime minister, Johann Kasimir Kolbe, Graf von Wartenberg, and his liaison with the countess of Wartenberg, the mistress <i>en titre</i> of the king, intertwined his fate with that faction. He must also have been a man of some charm, for he won over not only the countess but also Frederick and his queen, Sophie Charlotte. Raby was a tall, well built, good-looking man; both Kneller and D'Agar depicted him with large eyes, an aquiline nose, and full lips in an oval face. Punctilious in most things, he was well suited to the court of Berlin, where Frederick sought to endow his newly established kingship with the magnificence and etiquette found in Paris. Unkindly dubbed &#145;le singe de Louis XIV&#146;, the ape of Louis XIV, Frederick, a weak and indecisive man, was crippled by a sense of fatalism, an ingrained timidity, and a capacity for self-delusion. Enmeshed in the great power rivalry, he often found his options limited. In this environment Raby could play a key role. Certainly a man who sought to guide rather than be guided, he bombarded the secretary of state with long letters. He so fiercely defended Prussian interests that he laid himself open to the criticism that he was a &#145;Prussian because of the liberty I have several times taken of giving my poor advice of what is to be done&#146;  (Raby to Marlborough, 4 Feb 1710, BL, Add. MS 9108, fols. 41&#150;2).<br>
<br>Over time Raby's influence was threatened at court in part because of the king's increasing dissatisfaction with the allies, but also because of the ministerial intrigues, his equivocal relations with the countess of Wartenberg and her own unpopularity, and the enmity of powerful individuals. Raby's friendship with the king saved him from being recalled in 1706 and sent to Vienna as English envoy. This position would have meant a loss of station for Raby, who had been promoted to ambassador at Berlin. A fiscal crisis in Berlin coupled with overwhelming evidence of fraud and embezzlement led to the dismissal of Wartenberg in 1711. Uncomfortable with the changing power alignment at court, Raby welcomed his appointment in March of that year as ambassador-extraordinary and plenipotentiary to the states general of the United Provinces, where he served until 1714. Even St John, the secretary of state, felt constrained to apologize for the choice: &#145;You will find him to be the best we could at present send you&#146;, he confided to his agent John Drummond  (<span class="italic">Letters and Correspondence</span>, 1.52&#150;3). St John acknowledged Raby's weaknesses, especially his &#145;warmth&#146; but noted that the queen had promised him the appointment  (ibid.).<br>
<br>On 6 September 1711 Raby married Anne (<i>d</i>. 1754), the only daughter and heir of Sir Henry Johnson of Bradenham, Buckinghamshire, a wealthy shipbuilder with estates in Suffolk and Bedfordshire. She brought with her a substantial fortune, and the marriage produced three daughters, Anne, Lucy, and Henrietta, and a son, William (1722&#150;1791). In the same year as his marriage Raby was sworn of the privy council (14 June) and created Viscount Wentworth of Wentworth-Woodhouse and of Stainborough and earl of Strafford (29 June). He became elder brother of Trinity House on 3 September 1712 and master thereof on 1 June 1713. He served as first lord of the Admiralty (30 September 1713 until September 1714 for which he received a &pound;2000 bonus on his salary) and as one of the lords justices (1 August until 18 September 1714). On 25 October 1714 he was created a knight of the Garter. Strafford's seemingly unbridled ambition coupled with his hauteur antagonized many. Jonathan Swift described him as having &#145;some life and spirit; but &hellip; infinitely proud and wholly illiterate&#146;  (Swift, 2.489). These qualities did not serve him well at The Hague. He was instructed to maintain the illusion of Anglo-Dutch co-operation and at the same time to insist that the Dutch should fulfil their obligations to the coalition. A pretence of co-operation with the Dutch was necessary in order to allow the tories to extract the best possible terms from France and to ensure that the Dutch did not conclude a separate peace. By no means partial to the Dutch, Strafford often angered them by his hectoring and tactlessness. The Dutch in turn reviled him. On occasion his windows were smashed and the tories denounced as disguised papists. Undoubtedly he was not as popular as his predecessor, Charles, Viscount Townshend, because Strafford helped coerce the Dutch into signing a new barrier treaty (1713), which created an artificial military frontier in the Southern Netherlands. This agreement, however, represented a significant reduction from that of 1709. Strafford, who argued that &#145;We have been the dupes of the Warr and must take great Care that We are not so of the Peace &hellip;&#146;  (Strafford to St John, 2 June 1711, BL, Add. MS 31135, fol. 388), did not hesitate to threaten that the British would conclude a separate peace.<br>
<br>On 23 December 1711 Strafford was appointed ambassador-extraordinary and second plenipotentiary to the Utrecht peace congress jointly with John Robinson, bishop of Bristol, lord privy seal, the first plenipotentiary. Most of the important issues were handled in London or Paris rather than Utrecht. Strafford was often not told of certain concessions that had already been given; he was not informed of the secret Anglo-French negotiations or of all the details of the London preliminaries. Still, he could intermittently influence the negotiations; he ensured that Tournai was not ceded to France and that Upper Guelders went to Prussia.<br>
<br>In May 1712 Strafford was called back to London, and on his return to The Hague personally delivered the suspension of arms to James Butler, second duke of Ormond, captain-general of the British forces in Flanders. These orders enjoined Ormond not to co-operate in any siege or battle with Prince Eugene, commander of the imperial forces, and meant Britain's abandonment of her allies. Ormond's withdrawal of 12,000 British troops from the allied army left it vulnerable to the manoeuvres of the French. Although in July 1712 he referred to the allies as &#145;new enemies&#146;  (Herman, 117), Strafford, along with Robinson, ignored orders in March 1713 to sign separately with France. Because he wanted the peace to be a general one he delayed the signing until many of the allies' demands were met.<br>
<br>Although he always contended that he was &#145;of neither party called wig or Tory&#146;  (Strafford to W. Cadogan, 16 Feb 1709, BL, Add. MS 22196, fol. 184), Strafford's participation in the peace earned him the vilification of the whigs. After the death of Queen Anne in August 1714 and the accession of George I, he was criticized for abandoning Britain's allies and formally recalled from The Hague, although he did not leave his post until December. In January 1715 the privy council requested that he turn over his official papers on the Utrecht negotiations. The whig-dominated committee of secrecy examined them and voted to impeach not only Strafford but also Harley, St John, and James Butler, duke of Ormond. Ultimately the six articles of impeachment against Strafford charged that he had been instrumental in promoting &#145;separate, dishonorable, and destructive negotiations&#146; and that he had &#145;prostituted the honour of her majesty &hellip; and grossly violated her powers and instructions&#146;. Strafford professed his innocence and contended that he had always acted with &#145;the utmost integrity&#146; and claimed that he was &#145;totally ignorant of any treacherous correspondence with the emissaries of France&#146;  (<span class="italic">State trials</span>, 15.1014&#150;44). Although the House of Commons was not convinced by his defence, Strafford was never prosecuted. Still, many shared the view of Lord John Hervey that Strafford &#145;had the double honour of being a very dirty executor of a very dirty errand&#146;  (Herman, 201). He was specifically excluded from the <span class="roman">Act of Grace</span> granted by George in 1717 and never held another office.<br>
<br>Strafford then turned to the Jacobites and corresponded with the Pretender, who appointed him commander-in-chief of the Jacobite forces north of the Humber and bestowed on him the title duke of Strafford (5 June 1722). He still spoke in the House of Lords, alternately exasperating and amusing his colleagues. Lord Hervey described him in 1735 as a:<blockquote>loquacious, rich, illiterate, cold, tedious, constant haranguer in the House of Lords, who spoke neither sense nor English &hellip; in short there was nothing so low as his dialect except his understanding, nor anything so tiresome as his public harangues except his private conversation. (Hervey, 2.148&#150;9)</blockquote>In 1737 Strafford admitted that he &#145;was bad with the last ministry, worse with this, and he did not doubt but he should be worse with the next should he ever see another; therefore as an unbiased man, he gave his vote for the king&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>). After his retirement from public life Strafford devoted himself to his estates in Yorkshire and his family. His correspondence reveals a deep affection for his family and their myriad pets. He died &#145;of the stone&#146; at Wentworth Castle on 15 November 1739 and was buried on 2 December in Toddington, Bedfordshire. He was survived by his wife, who died on 19 September 1754. When his son, William, died without an heir, the titles passed by special remainder to Frederick Thomas Wentworth (1732&#150;1799), the second earl's cousin and the grandson of Peter Wentworth (<i>d</i>. 1739), brother of the first earl. When he died without an heir, the earldom was temporarily extinct.<br>
