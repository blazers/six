<span class="headword">Muir, Sir  Richard David</span>  (1857&#150;1924), <span class="occ">barrister</span>, was born at 16 Kelly Street, Greenock, Renfrewshire, on 8 March 1857, the son of Richard Muir, leather merchant, and his wife, Anne, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Burleigh. One of sixteen children, he did not proceed to university and was originally destined for one of the Glasgow merchant trading houses. Not finding that work congenial, he made his way to London where a brother, Burleigh, was a barrister. Obtaining employment on the parliamentary staff of <span class="italic">The Times</span>, he took classes in shorthand, attended law courses at King's College, London, read for the bar at the Middle Temple, and became a barrister in 1884. He entered the chambers of Forrest Fulton, predominantly a criminal practitioner. Like many a tyro, impecunious barrister, Muir struggled to make do between devilling in chambers and continuing late night parliamentary work, shedding the latter as his practice grew. Fulton's, and therefore Muir's, practice was mostly in the London sessions courts, and Muir himself first became a junior Treasury counsel at the north London sessions. By 1889 he was in a position to marry Mary Beatrice Leycester (1859&#150;1933), daughter of William Leycester, barrister and doyen of the <span class="italic">Times</span> parliamentary staff. They had a son and a daughter.<br>
<br>In 1892 Fulton became common serjeant, one of the judges at the central criminal court (Old Bailey). Muir took over Fulton's chambers and stayed until his death, becoming an expert on criminal law and procedure. Muir had few interests outside the law and his family. Like his younger contemporary Archibald Bodkin, Muir worked long hours, including at weekends, until towards the end of his life when, firmly established as the most senior court prosecutor, he relaxed somewhat, if short of actually retiring.<br>
<br>Muir's best-known cases were heard at the Old Bailey. He became a specialist in murder, though he undertook a wide range of prosecutions including complex financial frauds. He moved successively up the ranks of Treasury counsel, becoming a senior counsel in 1901 and senior Treasury counsel at the Old Bailey in 1908.<br>
<br>Muir's most famous case was the prosecution of Hawley Harvey Crippen in 1910. Muir was never, it was said, &#145;in all his long career as a criminal prosecutor more formidable and unflinching than in his masterly weaving together of the web which bound Crippen to his ultimate fate&#146;  (Young, 22). Almost equally well known was his prosecution in 1911 of Stinie Morrison for the murder of Leon Beron on Clapham Common. Procedurally at least as complex as the Crippen case because, although Morrison probably had an accomplice, that accomplice was never found, Muir was able through a misjudgement of defending counsel (Edward Abinger) to introduce evidence of Morrison's considerable criminal past. In addition there was a dramatic turn towards the end of the trial when a police constable's late testimony appeared to contradict some telling though not crucial detective evidence. Muir was able swiftly to discredit the evidence and secure a conviction. However, the home secretary, Winston Churchill, commuted the sentence of death to life imprisonment because, among other things, the court of criminal appeal had unintentionally cast doubt on the conviction. Muir's belief that the conviction was sound was later vindicated after Morrison's death in unusual circumstances.<br>
<br>Although appointed recorder at Colchester from 1911, Muir never otherwise attained the judicial office that might have been expected and for which it seems generally agreed he was fitted  (Biron, 121). It is also clear that when the post of director of public prosecutions became vacant in 1920 Muir was passed over in favour of Bodkin, when it was believed that Muir had been the retiring director's preferred successor. At the time members of the criminal bar did not usually take silk. By itself that would not have been an impediment: Fulton, for example, took silk only on becoming common serjeant in 1892. It may have been that timing was against him. In addition, though he was said to advise his juniors to take silk, he remained attached, some thought too attached, to his function as a Treasury prosecutor, which he would have had to give up on taking silk himself.<br>
<br>There were likely to have been other considerations in play. Since Muir was senior to Bodkin, there must have been a deliberate decision to reject him. Jackson has speculated that Muir was thought to &#145;lack humanity&#146; and that Bodkin was considered by Sir Gordon Hewart, the attorney-general, and Lloyd George, the prime minister, as &#145;the strong yet flexible&#146; director of public prosecutions that was needed  (Jackson, 169). Rufus Isaacs, the lord chief justice, a former attorney-general and a great confidant of the prime minister, had views on the appointment and it must be presumed that those views prevailed.<br>
<br>Isaacs would have known Muir well, having led him in the Seddon case in 1912 and encountered him on other occasions. Muir's court style was, though effective, not generally appreciated. Retaining throughout his life a Scottish accent and somewhat dour manner, he went to great, some thought excessive, lengths to prepare his cases. Operating a system of cards and coloured pencils, he left no stone unturned in a manner quite opposite, for example, to Horace Avory, who was said to read through the papers once and thereafter conduct proceedings without further reference to them  (Hastings, 96). Biron alleged that Muir's &#145;speeches made infinity intelligible&#146;  (Biron, 118) and that he was the only advocate who ever sent a witness to sleep. A long-serving Bow Street clerk claimed Muir was the only man to have sent him &#145;to sleep, actual heavy slumber, in court&#146; and, agreeing with Biron, that Muir pressed his cases too hard against the accused  (Lieck, 59&#150;60).<br>
<br>These are in the end questions of style and overlook the higher prosecutorial standards Muir espoused as distinct from the Old Bailey's former poor reputation for indifferent criminal practice, not to mention the louche social behaviour of Old Bailey practitioners. In the days before Muir a defence barrister characterized the trial as &#145;a formal preliminary to passing sentence upon the accused who had the effrontery to plead not guilty&#146;  (Purcell, 39). Muir played his part in raising practitioner standards and behaviour, especially in the rebuilt Old Bailey from 1908 when he succeeded Charles Mathews as chair of the bar mess. But his day passed and, with later generations itching to make their way, he was dismissed as out of touch. A young Norman Birkett defending against Muir in a complicated financial fraud prosecution described him as &#145;a silly, pompous, self-opinionated, vain, hard, emotionless, despicable ass!&#146;  (Hyde, 98). On the other hand, Humphreys, who knew Muir well, thought him &#145;as good a lawyer as any of the Treasury Counsel since the time of Poland &hellip; Judging from the references to him which I have read &hellip; I think Muir has been underrated and misunderstood&#146;  (Humphreys, 81). Muir became a bencher of the Middle Temple, and was for some years its treasurer.<br>
<br>Muir never made great riches. His biographer thought that &#145;if it had not been for a number of lucrative defences he undertook towards the end of his life&#151;mainly income-tax cases&#151;he would have died a poor man&#146;  (Felstead, 67). He was a useful workhorse to the authorities who never brought themselves to reward him with the judicial office to which he aspired. They did, however, award him a knighthood in 1918, the year of the death of his only son at the western front from influenza just seven days before the armistice. He was said never to have recovered from that blow, mellowing into a less unbending figure in his last years, even taking up golf. He died in harness at his home, 30 Campden House Court, Kensington, London, on 14 January 1924, from pneumonia&#151;his last two opinions unsigned. He was buried at West Norwood cemetery.<br>
