<span class="headword">Armitstead <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Cane; <em>married name </em>Fox]</span>,  Elizabeth Bridget</span>  (1750&#150;1842), <span class="occ">courtesan</span>, was, according to an entry in her journal, born on 11 July 1750. Her parentage, place of birth, and reason for changing her maiden name to Armitstead are unknown, as are the circumstances surrounding her emergence as a prominent courtesan. About 1774 she became the mistress of Frederick St John, second Viscount Bolingbroke (1734&#150;1787), who encouraged her to try the stage. She appeared four times at Covent Garden in 1774 and twice, in 1777, at the Haymarket. About 1776 she embarked on an affair with the United East India Company soldier and politician <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/63539/', "Richard Smith (bap. 1734, d. 1803)")</script>; in July of that year the couple were included in the <i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</i> series of profiles and caricatures in the <span class="italic">Town and Country Magazine</span>. Smith set her up in her own house in Bond Street, London, and apparently made her a settlement. Later that year she switched her affections to <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/24445/', "John Frederick Sackville, third duke of Dorset (1745&#150;1799)")</script>, and, possibly, to the whig man of fashion and army officer <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9624/', "Richard Fitzpatrick (1748&#150;1813)")</script>. Henceforth she was identified with <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/10024/', "Charles James Fox's")</script> whigs and his friends at Brooks's. Her own political convictions at this period are unknown, but it can be assumed that they reflected those of her patrons. In 1778 and 1779 she divided her attentions between <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/47080/', "Edward Smith Stanley, twelfth earl of Derby (1752&#150;1834)")</script>, and Lord George Cavendish (1727?&#150;1794); on 23 February 1778 Fox wrote to Fitzpatrick: &#145;I &hellip; dine at nine o'clock at Derby's who is become a great vagabond and is desperately in love with Mrs Armitstead&#146;  (Davis, 31). Once again she was profiled in the <span class="italic">Town and Country Magazine</span>, this time with Derby. &#145;They seem perfectly well pleased with each other, and his lordship has had so complete a surfeit of matrimony, that this probably may be a lasting alliance&#146;  (<span class="italic">Town and Country Magazine</span>, March 1779, 125). According to Charles Pigott's <span class="italic">The Jockey Club</span>, Cavendish supplied her with her second settlement. In January 1781 she succeeded Mary &#145;Perdita&#146; Robinson (1758?&#150;1800) as the mistress of the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/10541/', "prince of Wales (later George IV)")</script>:<blockquote>About this time a ridiculous affair happened &hellip; Ld George was returning one night to Mrs Armitstead's, rather drunk. In going into her room he perceiv'd some unaccustomed light in another, and much against her entreatys went in. The room seem'd empty, but willing to examine everywhere he soon found there was a man conceal'd behind the door. He stretched out his arm with the candle in his hand close to the person's face, and to his great surprise found it was the P. of Wales. (<span class="italic">Georgiana</span>, 291)</blockquote>The newspapers gave the relationship a political complexion, stigmatizing Mrs Armitstead as a tool of Fox's whigs: &#145;There cannot be a stronger proof of the miserable shifts to which opposition are driven, than the reports they so industriously circulate, of a connection between that <i>High Priestess of Patriotism</i>, Mrs A&#151;d and a certain heir apparent&#146;  (<span class="italic">Morning Herald</span>, 24 Jan 1781). The affair continued until the summer of 1781, when Mrs Armitstead left London for France, spending a further two months at Spa and two months in Italy. During her travels she shared her affections with George James Cholmondeley, fourth earl of Cholmondeley, and John Hanger, second Baron Coleraine.<br>
<br>After returning to London in May 1782 she resumed her affair with the prince, then, about September, turned exclusively to Fox. For a while Mrs Armitstead appears to have been uncertain about their relationship, and it was not until the late summer of 1783 that she committed herself to him irrevocably. Henceforth Fox spent most of his time away from politics at St Anne's Hill, Mrs Armitstead's rural retreat near Chertsey in Surrey, which he rented on her behalf and then bought from the duke of Marlborough. The couple's life at St Anne's Hill was reputedly idyllic. They read together, gardened together, explored the countryside together, and entertained Fox's friends and relatives, including his nephew Henry Richard Fox, third Baron Holland, a favourite of both. In 1788 they toured Europe and met Edward Gibbon in Lausanne; Mrs Armitstead, he told his friend John Baker Holroyd, first Baron Sheffield, somewhat misleadingly, was merely a &#145;cypher&#146;  (<span class="italic">Private Letters</span>, 2.180). In fact, she was an intelligent woman, dedicated to self-improvement, as demonstrated by her wide reading of classical and modern literature. Fox could meaningfully express not only his emotional needs to her, but also his political frustration, as his surviving letters to her show. Her taste and sense gradually moderated Fox's uncouth behaviour. Fox frequently professed his dependence on her, and on 28 September 1795 he married Mrs Armitstead at a private service at Wyton in Huntingdonshire. Seven years later he revealed the marriage to his family and friends, apologizing to his niece Caroline Fox for the secretive nature of the arrangement. She was never completely accepted as Fox's wife by his family, with the exception of Lord Holland, who welcomed and defended the marriage. Other members of Fox's circle were divided, Georgiana, duchess of Devonshire, writing to congratulate him, but Harriet Ponsonby, countess of Bessborough, noting &#145;all his friends are very angry with him&#146;  (Foreman, 357). The reason given for the announcement was Fox's wish that she be presented as his wife on their visit to Paris in October 1802. There they were received by Napoleon and Josephine Bonaparte, but Mrs Fox's presence in Parisian society caused consternation among other British visitors, ladies being reluctant to accept her as an equal but at the same time unwilling to be the first to snub her. In British society her status as Fox's wife could never be recognized at court, and this deterred potential visitors to St Anne's Hill; when she gave a ball in London in 1806 &#145;it was described in a <i>bon mot</i> &hellip; that &#147;there was all the world, but little of his wife&#148;&#146;  (Mitchell, 181). Fox remained devoted to her until his death on 13 September 1806, despite his scepticism allowing scriptural readings at his bedside to please his religious wife.<br>
<br>Mrs Fox outlived her husband by nearly thirty-six years, devoting the remainder of her life to her garden and friends; a companion Elizabeth Marston lived with her. She died at St Anne's Hill on 8 July 1842 and was buried a week later in All Saints (now St Peter's), Chertsey. During her days as a courtesan she was described as an attractive, tall, vivacious woman. Apparently she left no descendants, and St Anne's Hill was inherited by her husband's great-nephew <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/38898/', "Henry Edward Fox, fourth Baron Holland")</script>.<br>
