<span class="headword">Hill,  Albert Edwin <span class="st"> [Bertie]</span></span>  (1927&#150;2005), <span class="occ">equestrian and farmer</span>, was born on 7 February 1927 at Birch Farm, Swimbridge, Devon, the son of Hubert Hill, farmer, and his wife, Margery Evelyn, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Thorne. His involvement with horses began at an early age. He is said to have followed the Devon and Somerset staghounds as a four-year-old, ridden his pony to Swimbridge primary school from the age of five, and competed regularly in local gymkhanas and showjumping classes throughout his childhood. He attended secondary school at West Buckland. He left full-time education during the Second World War, at the age of fifteen, and thereafter helped his father on the family farm. Wartime conditions meant that all available land was under the plough and Bertie (as he was always known) took charge of the shire horse team. The war impinged on the young man in other ways: as a member of the Home Guard he undertook night patrols of Exmoor on horseback. An accomplished horseman, he became an amateur jockey when the war ended, riding successfully in local point-to-point races.<br>
<br>Hill's exploits on the race field brought him to the attention of Captain Tony Collings, owner of the Porlock Vale Riding School in north Devon and the man charged with assembling and training the British three-day event team for the Olympic games in Helsinki in 1952. Originally a discipline closely associated with the cavalry, eventing, or combined training as it was then known, had finally been opened to British civilian riders. Bertie Hill already had the riding skills to compete in the cross-country and showjumping phases and an intensive schooling in dressage enabled him to join the Olympic team, one of the first two civilians to do so (the other was Reg Hindley). Riding Sir John Miller's Stella, he finished seventh.<br>
<br>The next four years established Hill as one of the top equestrians in Europe. With Major Laurence Rook and Major Frank Weldon he formed the British team that won gold medals at the European championships in 1953 and 1954, picking up the individual gold at Basel on Crispin on the latter occasion. In the same year he began to compete in events on Countryman, the horse with which he became most closely associated. Purchased for &pound;90 in 1952 as an ostensibly unbreakable Irish-born colt, Countryman proved to be a good hunter and point-to-pointer under Hill's patient tuition, and made his international eventing d&eacute;but in 1955. Once again the British team of Hill, Weldon, and Rook won gold at the European championships held at Windsor, their third consecutive triumph: Hill and Countryman won individual bronze. The horse was then sold to a syndicate that included the queen, the queen mother, and the tenth duke of Beaufort, but Hill continued to partner him, gaining fourth place at the Badminton horse trials in spring 1956. The pair then became part of the British team that won gold at the Olympic games, the equestrian events of which took place in June at Stockholm.<br>
<br>During this period Hill began to farm in his own right at Great Rapscott, South Molton, less than 10 miles from his childhood home; he is said to have purchased half of his stock with the proceeds from the sale of Countryman. On 3 February 1954 he married (Clarice) Mary Holland, a 22-year-old farmer's daughter from the nearby parish of Fremington. They had a son, Antony, and a daughter, Sarah. In between major international events Hill continued to hunt, to exhibit horses at shows, and to compete in national horse trials. He never won at Badminton, a surprising omission from such a fine equestrian career.<br>
<br>In 1960, when the Olympics were held in Rome, Hill was again selected for the eventing team, the first British rider to compete in three Olympiads. Partnering Wild Venture, he rode a clear round in the showjumping but bad luck and misjudgements in the earlier cross-country phase left the British competitors 0.5 points outside the bronze medal position. Errors in the preparation and management of the British team in 1960 would provide valuable experience for Hill during a later stage of his life.<br>
<br>Following his retirement from international competition Hill, with his wife, set up the Rapscott School of Equitation at their farm. The first of its kind in north Devon, it became the training ground for countless British riders, sometimes to the detriment of his own equestrian success. Lying second after the cross-country in his final three-day event at Badminton in 1970, he was so concerned with supporting the ten students he had brought with him that he jumped the wrong fence and was eliminated. Among those who benefited from his tuition were Princess Anne, the princess royal, and Mark Phillips. In 1967 he was appointed official trainer to the British international eventing team, bringing to the post his experience gained through competition at the highest level. Major successes under his guidance included the European championships of 1967 and 1969, the world championships in 1970, and, most significantly, the Olympic games of 1968 in Mexico, where the British team of Derek Allhusen, Jane Bullen, Ben Jones, and Richard Meade won gold.<br>
<br>Bertie Hill&#151;a horseman, a racing enthusiast, and a countryman who was passionate about traditional rural pursuits&#151;lived his entire life on and around Exmoor. From 1975 to 1997 he was master of the Dulverton West foxhounds. A continued involvement with horses also led to judging classes at the same local shows in which he had competed as a young man. Having handed over the running of Great Rapscott to his son Antony, he died of heart disease on 5 August 2005 at Eastleigh, 91 East Street, South Molton, after a long battle with Parkinson's disease. He was survived by his wife and children. In June 2006 he was inducted into the British Horse Society's equestrian hall of fame.<br>
