<span class="headword">Holker,  John</span>  (1719&#150;1786), <span class="occ">Jacobite soldier and industrialist</span>, was born on 14 October 1719 at Stretford, near Manchester, the son of John Holker, probably a blacksmith, and Alice, daughter of John Morris. His father died early; his mother was still alive in 1760. He was a partner with Peter Moss in a calendering business in Manchester while still in his twenties, and around 1740 he married Elizabeth Hilton, a Manchester woman. When the army of Charles Edward Stuart entered Manchester in 1746, Holker and Moss purchased commissions in the regiment raised there. He clearly stated that he was captured at Carlisle, though others in France later said it was at Culloden. He and Moss made a most daring escape from Newgate prison, and Holker made his way to France via the Netherlands. Once in France he joined a Jacobite regiment in the French army and saw service in Flanders. In 1750 he again showed the greatest courage in returning to England as Charles Stuart's sole companion, when he vainly urged the English Jacobites to rebel. Though given a sword of honour by Charles, Holker never seems to have claimed any merit for this act.<br>
<br>At this point Holker became known to Marc Morel, a French inspector of industry, who had examined the industrial situation in England. Morel drew him to the attention of Daniel-Charles Trudaine, the brilliant head of the bureau of commerce, who had a wide administrative brief. He and the scientist Mignot de Montigny, an industrial adviser to government, interviewed Holker. They concluded that he had the ability to raise the Rouen cotton industry to English standards. He was found capital and partners to set up two enterprises, one for spinning and weaving, and one for finishing cloth, particularly by calendering. Holker went to England, and to his native Lancashire, where his mother helped him to gather a well-selected group of workers, including some relatives. He successfully organized their removal to France, together with some machine models, and in many cases their families joined them. The two Rouen enterprises were very successful, and Holker gained the high esteem of Trudaine.<br>
<br>Holker submitted a scheme to the French government, probably with its strong encouragement, for the creation of a post that would encourage the seduction of workers from England, together with equipment, and, in the long term, would employ agents to continue this activity, and would then spread the industrial espionage beyond cotton. He was well aware of the British anti-suborning legislation of 1719 and after. He proposed that emigrant workers be encouraged by tax concessions and pensions. He himself would embark on tours through France to examine the industrial situation, and advise where it could be improved by an infusion of English technology and workers. The scheme was approved, and he became inspector-general of foreign manufactures in 1756.<br>
<br>Holker's tour reports are penetrating, often brilliant, and amazing, given his youth and limited industrial experience when he left England. For over quarter of a century he was the favoured and respected adviser of Trudaine and his son Trudaine de Montigny, who succeeded his father in 1769. One of his hardest tasks was to advise, direct, and comment on three other Englishmen, who were establishing themselves in France: John Badger, calenderer and maker of watered silks; Michael Alcock, a Birmingham metal manufacturer; and John Kay of fly-shuttle fame. All were difficult men to deal with, and the last two almost unreasonably so. Holker was largely responsible for setting up two large proto-industrial colonies of workers, at Sens and Bourges, based on the skills, and partly on the management, of British textile workers, many of whom he had secured himself. With his only son, <a href="#cosubject_13508">John Holker [<i>see below</i>]</a>, he embarked on vitriol production after long preparations, which involved industrial espionage by his son in England. They established <i>c</i>.1768 the glass-globe process, and then <i>c</i>.1772 the lead-chamber process, the basis of much of the future heavy chemical industry.<br>
<br>In 1766 Holker and his wife took French nationality; in 1770 he received the cross of the military order of St Louis, and in 1774 he was granted letters of nobility because of his outstanding services to industry&#151;there being a small preliminary charade of his proving gentility in England. Widowed by 1776, he took as his second wife Marie-Marguerite Th&eacute;r&egrave;se Ribard, widow of Jean Testard, from a prominent Rouen business family claiming nobility.<br>
<br>During Holker's last years he was important in introducing English experts on the new textile machinery into France, particularly the Milnes of Stockport. Weeks before his death he gave greatly valued, and debated, advice on the potential terms of the Eden&#150;Rayneval treaty of 1786 for freer trade between Britain and France. The 1780s were saddened for him by a bitter pamphlet attack on his achievements by his former prot&eacute;g&eacute; Roland de la Plati&egrave;re, and by his guaranteeing the vast debts which his son ran up as an envoy and then merchant and speculator in the United States.<br>
<br>Given Holker's limited industrial experience in England, his very poor written English, and his limited spoken French even in the 1770s, his achievements were remarkable. He was largely responsible for giving Rouen a significant cotton industry and France the basis of a heavy chemical industry, while intervening helpfully in many branches of French industry over much of the country. Able to maintain a successful rapport with some of the greatest and best French statesmen of the old regime, and become the respected friend of Jefferson and particularly Franklin, Holker remained sympathetic to the problems of the lowest worker. He died at Rouen on 27 April 1786.<br>
<br>John Holker's only child was his son, <a name="cosubject_13508"></a><span class="headword">John Holker</span>  (1745&#150;1822)<span class="occ"></span>, born at Manchester. He had from 1764 received a specialized training to enable him to succeed his father, partly by studying science under Rouelle, Cadet, and others, partly by accompanying his father on industrial tours and inspections in France. In 1768 he was appointed <i>adjoint</i> to his father, and was deeply involved in obtaining the English technology of sulphuric acid (vitriol) manufacture; the Holkers started to produce the acid in Rouen by the globe process in 1769, and then by the lead-chamber process about 1772. The younger John Holker made major industrial espionage expeditions to Britain in 1767, 1770, and 1772; the 1770 visit brought the spinning jenny to France. He was made inspector-general of foreign manufactures in 1777. But in the same year he was sent on an ambitious but ill-defined diplomatic mission to the United States. He was appointed consul in Philadelphia and became concerned in the supply of the French fleet in America and that of the French and American land forces. He was also heavily involved with American finances and internal and external trade. He was unable to settle his accounts with the French navy, and unable to return to France until after his father's death, and then only very briefly. He became a land speculator in America on a large scale. His wife, Elizabeth Julie Quesnel, whom he had married in 1769, never joined him in America. He died there in 1822. His son, <a name="cosubject_13506"></a><span class="headword">Jean-Louis Holker</span>  (1770&#150;1844), seems not to have had any British connection. He was a major <span class="occ">French chemical industrialist</span>, largely responsible for the continuous production method in sulphuric acid, and extending into soda and chlorine bleach manufacture.<br>
