<span class="headword">Holder,  William</span>  (1615/16&#150;1698), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and natural philosopher</span>, was born in Southwell, Nottinghamshire, the third son of Clement Holder (<i>d</i>. 1638), prebendary of Southwell and rector of Kilvington and South Wheatley, and his wife, whose maiden name was Brudenell. William matriculated pensioner from Pembroke College, Cambridge, in 1633, aged seventeen; he graduated BA in 1637 and proceeded MA in 1640. He was a fellow of his college from 1640 to 1642. He was rector of Barnoldby-le-Beck in Lincolnshire in 1641&#150;2.<br>
<br>About the time war broke out Holder resigned his fellowship and moved to royalist Oxfordshire, becoming rector of Bletchingdon and tutor to the young Christopher Wren, the future architect. In 1643 he married Christopher's elder sister, Susanna Wren (1626/7&#150;1688). Their union was long and happy, but childless. Susanna had (says Aubrey) a &#145;strange sagacity as to curing wounds&#146;, ministering to rich and poor alike, and at one stage incurring the enmity of the court physicians by curing Charles II of a swollen hand  (<span class="italic">Brief Lives</span>, 1.405). Susanna's father, Dean Christopher Wren, joined them after the war at Bletchingdon, where he died in 1658. At Oxford Holder was incorporated MA in 1644, watched over the undergraduate Christopher Wren, helped obtain the Savilian chair of astronomy for Seth Ward in 1649 after the parliamentary visitation, and became a member of the circle of natural philosophers surrounding Ward and John Wilkins.<br>
<br>At the Restoration Holder was incorporated DD at Oxford in 1661, and was among the first institution of ordinary members of the Royal Society. Through the patronage of Susanna's uncle, the nepotistic Bishop Matthew Wren of Ely, he became prebendary of Ely (installed in 1660), rector of Northwold, Norfolk (1662&#150;87) and, in plurality, rector of Tydd St Giles in the Isle of Ely (1663). He was also a prebendary of Southwell from 1660 to 1664. In 1672 he succeeded to Bishop Stillingfleet's prebendal stall at St Paul's, and from 1674 to 1689 was subdean at the Chapel Royal, where for his haughty discipline and exacting musical standards he was called &#145;Mr Snub-dean&#146;  (Hawkins, 541&#150;4). In 1687 he took up the living of Therfield in Hertfordshire, where he retreated after the death of his wife in 1688. Latterly he overwintered at Alderman Keynton's home in Hertford, where, growing &#145;old and crazy&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 4275, fol. 294), he died on 24 January 1698. He left &pound;455 in his will, in addition to property, much of it in the form of gifts and legacies to his servants and the poor. He was buried, with his wife, in the undercroft of St Paul's Cathedral, their monument standing near to that of its architect.<br>
<br>Holder was, according to his friend and correspondent John Aubrey, &#145;a handsome, gracefull person, and of a delicate constitution, and of an even and smooth temper &hellip; a perfect good man&#146;  (<span class="italic">Brief Lives</span>, 1.404&#150;5). Wood acclaimed him &#145;a great virtuoso&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>: <span class="italic">Fasti</span>, 2.59). In 1660 at Bletchingdon he achieved considerable fame by teaching a deaf mute, Alexander Popham, to speak &#145;plainly and distinctly, and with a good and graceful tone&#146;. Afterwards regressing, Popham was retaught by the eminent mathematician John Wallis, author of a theoretical treatise on speech, who ostentatiously claimed the credit. In 1668 Holder presented a paper to the Royal Society on the workings of the ear, and followed it in 1669 with a treatise, <span class="italic">Elements of Speech</span>, in which he deplored the &#145;faulty alphabets&#146; of grammarians and named and analysed the physical parts of speech in pursuit of a basis for a universal language. Wilkins's treatise of 1668 on universal language had owed much to discussions with Holder. Holder's account in the <span class="italic">Elements</span> of his work with Popham provoked an exhaustive and unconvincing rebuttal from the disputatious Wallis (in his <span class="italic">A Defence of the Royal Society</span>, 1670, and in the <span class="italic">Philosophical Transactions</span> of July 1670). In a long-delayed reply Holder accused Wallis of &#145;rifling his Neighbours, and adorning himself with their spoyls&#146;  (Holder, <span class="italic">Supplement</span>, 10), supplying extensive details to support his charge. Senior fellows, including Hooke and Oldenburg, supported Holder; Wallis's eminence sheltered him. Holder was a moderately active member of the Royal Society, mainly between 1663 and 1683, although his practical contributions were disappointing, and also a member of Robert Hooke's informal &#145;clubb for Natural Philosophy and mechanicks&#146;  ('Espinasse, 109, 114&#150;15).<br>
<br>A competent composer of services and anthems, Holder in retirement wrote an influential and well-received treatise, <span class="italic">Principles of Harmony</span> (1694), the surviving correspondence concerning which illustrates the complexities of contemporary music publishing. It was still regarded as a standard work for long afterwards, both in England and abroad, and remains of interest for its account of mean-tone tuning.<br>
<br>Holder's subsequent <span class="italic">Discourse Concerning Time</span> (1694), written to explain the issue of calendar reform and reissued in 1701 after the renewed English rejection of the Gregorian calendar, was an elegant exposition of the concept of harmony on a cosmic scale. In it he developed the idea that rational human perception was required to give meaning to creation, for &#145;Time is always Transient, in a continual Flux, neither to be seen, nor felt, nor reserved; but only measured by an Act of the Mind&#146;  (Holder, <span class="italic">Discourse Concerning Time</span>, 1&#150;2, 13).<br>
<br>Holder's reputation was probably hampered in his day by his lack of intellectual competitiveness. His work was none the less of enduring value, memorable for his declaration of the value of the written word: &#145;Written language &hellip; is permanent, and it reacheth the absent, and posterity, and by it we speak after we are dead&#146;  (Holder, <span class="italic">Elements</span>, 8&#150;9).<br>
