<span class="headword">Dewes,  Garrat</span>  (<em>b. </em>in or before 1533, <em>d.</em> 1591), <span class="occ">bookseller and publisher</span>, was the eldest son of Adrian Dewes (<i>d</i>. 1551), descended from the ancient lords of Kessel in Guelderland, who during the reign of Henry VIII had moved from the Low Countries to England, where he married Alice Ravenscroft. In his will, Garrat and three other surviving sons are mentioned. Garrat Dewes, who had been apprenticed to London stationer Andrew Hester, was made free of the Stationers' Company on 4 October 1557, when he would have been at least twenty-four years of age. He was taken into the Stationers' Company livery in 1569, served as renter warden in 1572&#150;3 and as under-warden in 1581&#150;2. Between January and September 1568 he received five shipments from Antwerp, each of 20 reams of unbound books, valued at &pound;2. From 1578 to 1587 his bookshop was at the sign of the Swan in Paul's Cross churchyard. His device  (McKerrow, nos. 169, 171) was cited by William Camden as a &#145;most memorable&#146; example of a rebus: &#145;two in a Garret casting dews at dice&#146;  (W. Camden, <span class="italic">Remaines</span>, 1629, sig. K2<i>v</i>). From December 1573 he was one of the &#145;Assignes of Francis Flower&#146;, operating under Flower's lucrative patent as queen's printer for Latin, Greek, and Hebrew, which included the production of Lily's <span class="italic">Grammar</span>.<br>
<br>Dewes married at some date before 1563 Grace Hynde (<i>d</i>. 1583) of Cambridgeshire. They had a daughter, Alice, who married William Lathum of Upminster, Essex, and a son, <a name="cosubject_7576"></a><span class="headword">Paul Dewes</span>  (1567&#150;1631), <span class="occ">government official</span>, was one of the six clerks of the chancery. Born in London, Paul Dewes was twice married. Among the children of his first marriage, to Sissilia (<i>c</i>.1581&#150;1618), daughter of Richard Simonds, barrister, of Coxden, Chardstock, Dorset, were <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7577/', "Sir Simonds D'Ewes (1602&#150;1650)")</script>, diarist and antiquary, and Richard Dewes (<i>d</i>. 1643), royalist army officer. Paul Dewes (who lived during the latter part of his life at Stow Hall, Stowlangtoft, Suffolk) died on 14 March 1631.<br>
<br>Probably about 1589, when he was demoted from the governing court of assistants of the Stationers' Company for his &#145;Contynuall absence&#146;  (Greg and Boswell, 33), Garrat Dewes retired to South Ockendon, Essex, where he purchased the manor of Gaines and adopted the life of a country gentleman. He died on 12 April 1591 and was buried at Upminster church, &#145;very solemly and decently, with escutcheons of the coat-armour and other accountrements befitting his ancient and noble extraction&#146;  (<span class="italic">Autobiography</span>, 1.9).<br>
