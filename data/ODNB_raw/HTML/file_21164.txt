<span class="headword">Palliser,  Fanny  Bury</span> <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Fanny Marryat]</span>  (1805&#150;1878), <span class="occ">writer on art</span>, was born on 23 September 1805, the daughter of Joseph Marryat (1757&#150;1824) of Wimbledon House, Surrey, and Sydenham House, Kent&#151;a businessman and later MP for Horsham and Sandwich&#151;and his wife, Charlotte, daughter of Frederic Geyer of Boston, New England. She was one of fifteen children, many of whom later published; her siblings included <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18097/', "Frederick Marryat (1792&#150;1848)")</script>, the novelist, and Joseph Marryat (1790&#150;1878), the ceramics expert. On 8 August 1832 she married Captain Richard Bury Palliser (1796/7&#150;1852), the third son of John Palliser of Derrybuskan, co. Tipperary; they had four sons and two daughters.<br>
<br>Mrs Bury Palliser approached her career as a writer on artistic subjects in the oblique fashion common to nineteenth-century women art critics and art historians. In 1845 she published <span class="italic">The Modern Poetical Speaker</span>, a collection of modern verse suitable for recitation, and in 1855 <span class="italic">Handbook of the Arts in the Middle Ages</span>, a translation from the French of Jules Labarte. She also assisted her brother Joseph&#151;with whom she shared a long-standing interest in the history of ceramics&#151;to revise the second edition (1857) of his <span class="italic">History of Pottery and Porcelain</span>, and was a significant figure among the growing number of women collectors of ceramics led by Lady Charlotte Shreiber and Lady Dorothy Nevill. She showed an interest&#151;unusual among women collectors&#151;in Italian maiolica, and in July 1857 was proposed for membership of the newly founded Collectors' Club (soon the Fine Arts Club) by J. C. Robinson. In later life, she published <span class="italic">The China Collector's Pocket Companion</span> (1874), and <span class="italic">History of the Ceramic Art</span> (1878), a translation from the French work by Albert Jacquemart.<br>
<br>Fanny Bury Palliser's most significant publication dealt with an area of art history which, like ceramics, was considered eminently suitable for women writers. <span class="italic">The History of Lace</span>, published in 1865, established her as an expert on this subject; it reached a second edition in 1869 and a third in 1875. Her obituarist in <span class="italic">The Academy</span> rightly described it as &#145;a complete and valuable work, abounding in illustrations&#146;  (p. 73): if not a model of style, it is a comprehensive classification of varieties of lacework and a mine of information on its history. Its durability was confirmed by a full revision in 1902, by Margaret Jourdain and Alice Dryden: in the preface, they described it as &#145;still the classic work on the subject&#146;. It still features frequently in the footnotes of contemporary studies of lace and its history. Palliser was chosen to produce <span class="italic">A Descriptive Catalogue of the Lace and Embroidery in the South Kensington Museum</span> (1871); she produced a revised edition in 1873 and at the time of her death was preparing another revision (later completed and published by her fellow lace expert, Alan Summerley Cole, in 1881). She took a leading part in the organization of the International Lace Exhibition of 1874 at South Kensington, arranging and cataloguing the materials, and donated many examples of lacework to the museum. Thus she assisted in the formation of what is now one of the largest lace collections in the world; she may also have contributed indirectly to the revival of the lace industry which took place after her death, with the philanthropic foundation of lace associations in the 1870s and 1880s.<br>
<br>A contributor to the <span class="italic">Art Journal</span> and <span class="italic">The Academy</span>, Palliser also published <span class="italic">Historic Devices, Badges, and War Cries</span> (1870)&#151;a collection of papers which had earlier appeared in the <span class="italic">Art Journal</span>&#151;and <span class="italic">Mottoes for Monuments, or, Epitaphs Selected for Study and Application</span> (1872). An engaging travelogue, <span class="italic">Brittany and its Byways</span>, appeared in 1869. She died at her home, 33 Russell Road, Kensington, on 16 January 1878, and was buried in Brompton cemetery on 21 January. Her memorialist in <span class="italic">The Reliquary</span>, L. F. W. Jewitt, praised her as &#145;a discriminating, clear-headed and just critic&#146;, who was nevertheless &#145;a true woman in every thought, feeling, and impulse and action&#146;  (Jewitt, 227&#150;8). His opinion may not have been uninfluenced by her extremely favourable review of his <span class="italic">Ceramic Art in Great Britain</span> (1878) in the <span class="italic">Art Journal</span> for January 1878&#151;probably the last piece she wrote.<br>
