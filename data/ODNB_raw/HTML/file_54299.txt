<span class="headword">Murray <span class="st"> [Moray]</span>, Sir  Andrew, of Bothwell</span>  (1298&#150;1338), <span class="occ">soldier and administrator</span>, was the posthumous son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/50013/', "Andrew Murray")</script>, who died of wounds received at Stirling Bridge in 1297; his grandfather was then still alive. Nothing is known of his youth, save that in November 1300 he was thought to be living in Moray among the English king's enemies. He may well have been taken south in 1304 or 1306&#150;7, because a prisoner Andrew Murray was released with others by Edward II in the aftermath of Bannockburn. Otherwise he first appears, as witness to a royal charter, on 1 April 1320, five days before the date of the declaration of Arbroath. The draft of that document includes among the senders a &#145;panetar&#146; of Scotland (the &#145;panetar&#146;, or pantler, was the officer responsible for the royal household's bread supply); this was a family honour which Murray had probably inherited from his great-uncle (<i>d</i>. 1300), and its presence here suggests that his name preceded these words and had been deleted&#151;as were the same words in the final version. He was knighted by 1320. In July 1326, when he was already father of two sons and a widower, Murray married the king's sister <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/60019/', "Christian Bruce")</script>, widow of Sir Christopher Seton, and was given the Garioch as the dowry. But he was a rare witness to royal acts thereafter, and there is no evidence that he participated in the Weardale campaign of 1327.<br>
<br>At the invasion of the &#145;disinherited&#146; in 1332 the Scottish community looked to the extended Bruce family for leadership, and after the death of Donald, earl of Mar, at Dupplin Moor they chose Murray, who may have been keeper of Berwick at the time, to be guardian of the kingdom. With Sir Archibald Douglas he tracked Edward Balliol from Perth to Galloway and then to Roxburgh, where, during an attempt to break the bridge at Kelso, Murray risked his person to save a follower. He was taken prisoner and sent to Edward III, still officially at peace with David II.<br>
<br>By the time Murray was allowed to ransom himself, in the summer of 1334, Berwick was in English hands and the purpose of Edward III to annex the southern counties of Scotland was clear. David II was in France, Scotland had been briefly subdued by the two Edwards, but was once more in active &#145;rebellion&#146;, and Murray hastened north to besiege Sir Henry de Beaumont in Dundarg Castle on the north coast of Buchan. Although Edward III hoped to relieve it, after bombardment by a siege engine it capitulated on 23 December 1334.<br>
<br>Scotland was falling rapidly into disorder when John Randolph, earl of Moray and now guardian, held a parliament, attended by Murray, at Dairsie, near Cupar, Fife, in April 1335, for while the patriotic party was not strong enough to expel Edward III, Edward was unable to control Scotland. David Strathbogie, titular earl of Atholl, had deserted to the patriotic cause, but was scarcely popular at the parliament, which could resolve only on a policy of scorched earth. By August 1335 Edward III was installed in Perth with a large army, the guardian, Moray, was a prisoner in England, and Strathbogie had negotiated a submission which included many patriotic magnates. None the less enough remained faithful to meet at Dumbarton in September 1335 and once more choose Murray as guardian.<br>
<br>Despite the usual view that he was a stout patriot, Murray employed the next two months in short truces frequently extended, negotiating with Edward III for a settlement which would make some provision for David Bruce. During these talks he learned that his wife, Christian Bruce, was besieged in Kildrummy Castle by Strathbogie, acting as lieutenant for Edward Balliol. With a force of about 1000, and apparently with the agreement of the English negotiators, Murray marched north to the relief of his wife. Strathbogie broke off the siege and came south to the Dee near Ballater. There, at Culblean Hill on 30 November 1335, Murray, Sir William Douglas, and their forces came upon Strathbogie's men from the rear; Douglas's men broke their charge and Murray took them from the flank. They turned and fled, save Strathbogie and his retinue, who fought on to the death. The forces were small, but the importance of the victory great, for it gave Murray the heart to refuse the compromise terms negotiated; from that time, the chroniclers noted, the war turned in favour of the Scots.<br>
<br>During the winter of 1335&#150;6 Murray unsuccessfully besieged Cupar Castle, Fife, and held a council at Dunfermline at which he was confirmed as guardian, before marching north to besiege Strathbogie's widow in Lochindorb Castle. Edward III once more came to Perth, and set out with a small force to rescue the lady and if possible destroy Murray. He saved the lady and ravaged much of the country of Moray, but Murray eluded him and, in Edward's absence&#151;the English king returned to spend the end of 1336 in Bothwell&#151;took and destroyed the castles of Dunnottar, Kinneff, Lauriston, and Kinclaven. Cupar again held out in February 1337, but St Andrews Castle fell before a siege engine called Buster. Edward III had gone home, so Murray took his engine to Bothwell and battered down the castle (which was his own heritage) in March 1337. In August, as though the days of Robert I had returned, he was raiding Cumberland, in September Northumberland, taking much loot. Lothian remained nominally in English control, but in fact both sides destroyed its economy, as happened when Murray failed to take Edinburgh at the end of 1337. He had adopted scorched earth tactics and rendered untenable the castles which he took. In short, at a high cost to Scotland, he made it too expensive, too chancy, too time-consuming, for Edward III to hold, and in 1338 Edward turned his attention to France. Murray retired to his castle at Avoch on the Black Isle, where he died that year at an unknown date in Lent (25 February to 12 April). He was buried nearby at Rosemarkie, but his remains were afterwards removed to Dunfermline Abbey.<br>
<br>The nickname the Rich, sometimes attributed to Murray, is not well attested, though he did pay off a very large ransom. His second wife, Christian Bruce, lived on until 1356. He and his first wife, whose identity is unknown, had two sons, John and Thomas, who succeeded to the estates in turn. The second son, <a name="cosubject_54299"></a><span class="headword">Sir Thomas Murray <span class="st"> [Moray]</span> of Bothwell</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1361), <span class="occ">panetar of Scotland</span>, entered England about September 1351 as a hostage for David II, then on ticket-of-leave in Scotland, soon after succeeding his deceased brother, John. He would return home in 1352, and was apparently knighted by 1353; he participated in the negotiations for the release of David II in 1354 and was party to the treaty of Berwick of 5 October 1357. While he was not named as hostage for payment of David's ransom, he was among the eight prominent magnates from whom three special hostages were to be sent if David failed to keep up payment. Late in 1358 he delivered himself to Edward III as a prisoner, but was given leave to go home; if he went, he was back by July 1359 and remained thereafter in London, where he died, probably of plague, in 1361. He was certainly not held as a special hostage, and must have gone in place of one of the ordinary hostages named in the treaty. He and his wife, Joanna Murray (<i>d</i>. after 1401), daughter of Maurice Murray, earl of Strathearn, had no surviving children, and it is not clear how Bothwell and other lands passed to her second husband, Archibald, third earl of Douglas.<br>
