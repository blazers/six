<span class="headword">Poynton, Sir  (Arthur) Hilton</span>  (1905&#150;1996), <span class="occ">civil servant</span>, was born on 20 April 1905 at 3 Fyfield Road, Oxford, the younger son in the family of two sons and three daughters of Arthur Blackburne Poynton (1867&#150;1944), fellow of University College, Oxford, and his wife, Mary, daughter of J. Y. Sargent, fellow of Magdalen and Hertford colleges. His father was a distinguished classicist, curator of the Bodleian Library (1912&#150;37), and master of University College (1935&#150;7). Poynton's elder brother, John Blackburne Poynton (1900&#150;1995), was also a gifted classical scholar, but chose to be a schoolmaster at Winchester College in preference to an Oxford career.<br>
<br>Poynton was educated at Marlborough College and Brasenose College, Oxford, where he obtained a first in classical moderations (1925) and a second in <i>literae humaniores</i> (1927). He joined the civil service in 1927, spent two years at the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research, and moved to the Colonial Office in 1929, his professional home for most of the next three and half decades. He was seconded to Sierra Leone in 1933&#150;4 and to the Dominions Office for a short period in 1935. Between 1941 and 1943 he was on loan as a private secretary, first to Lord Beaverbrook, the minister of supply, and then to Oliver Lyttelton, the minister of production. On his return to the Colonial Office in 1943, he became an assistant secretary and head of its defence department. He was promoted assistant under-secretary of state in 1946. As deputy under-secretary of state between 1948 and 1959 he had overall responsibility for the economic division of the Colonial Office. In 1959 he became permanent under-secretary of state, a post that he held until his retirement in August 1966. He was appointed CMG in 1946, KCMG in 1949, and GCMG in 1964. On 12 July 1946 he married Elisabeth Joan (<i>b</i>. 1915/16), daughter of the Revd Edmund Williams, Congregational minister, of Exmouth; they had three children, John (<i>b</i>. 1947), Christopher (<i>b</i>. 1949), and Elisabeth (<i>b</i>. 1954).<br>
<br>Poynton was the last head of an independent Colonial Office, the latter merging with the Commonwealth Relations Office to form the Commonwealth Office in 1966, before this department in turn merged with the Foreign Office in 1968 to create the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. At the beginning of his career colonial administration from London was concerned with good government, law and order, and sound finance. During and after the war the promotion of colonial development and welfare became another priority. By the end of his career&#151;and especially during the &#145;wind of change&#146; era of the early 1960s, when no fewer than eighteen territories (all but eight of them African) became independent&#151;the work of the Colonial Office had become highly political. Poynton presided over this transition and indeed participated in it. He spent hours behind the scenes at Marlborough House conferences working on the details of independence constitutions. But it was not a climate that he particularly enjoyed: an old-fashioned and rather patrician administrator, he belonged to a different world.<br>
<br>Over the whole of his career Poynton left a mark in three areas. First, he was a dogged opponent of the notion that colonial powers should be internationally accountable. At San Francisco in 1945 he played a significant role in drafting those chapters of the United Nations (UN) charter that dealt with non-self-governing territories. His defence department at the Colonial Office had been assigned responsibility for post-war reconstruction in this area of policy, and the British intention at the time was to keep UN supervision at arm's length. As the international critics of colonialism gathered strength at the UN in the 1950s and 1960s, Britain found itself under attack. Poynton, however, stood firm. He observed in 1962 that what he objected to was not &#145;international scrutiny of affairs in our Colonies in all circumstances but international scrutiny prompted solely by the fact that the territories are Colonial&#146;  (Hyam and Louis, 2.347). His stand was not welcome to some on his own side. Sir Hugh Foot, the United Kingdom representative at the UN, complained that &#145;Poynton in particular seems obsessed by the need to resist any attempt by the people at the UN to interest themselves in British colonial affairs&#146;. According to Foot, Poynton saw no need to work closely on such matters with the Americans or Commonwealth countries, and he regarded the new countries of Africa and Asia as &#145;irritating busybodies&#146;  (ibid., 2.339).<br>
<br>Poynton's second legacy concerned the future of the Colonial Office itself. As the number of territories for which it was responsible shrank, he was determined that the Colonial Office should not be reduced to what he described in 1963 as a &#145;rocks and islands Department&#146;  (Hyam and Louis, 1.338). He fought the Colonial Office corner, insisting at the time of the 1966 merger that his officials would have much to offer through their specialist expertise and advisory services.<br>
<br>Finally, at the end of his career Poynton devoted considerable time to the future of those very small colonial territories for which independence was ruled out because they were either too small or too poor and very often both. He would not countenance any abdication of Britain's responsibilities. In 1959 the Treasury and the Commonwealth Relations Office wanted for financial reasons to transfer the Pacific colonies to Australia and New Zealand. Poynton responded:&#145;I don't mind &#147;giving up&#148; a territory in favour of another Commonwealth administration if that provides a more efficient administration &amp; is what the people want. I <i>do</i> object to being asked to &#147;give up&#148; territories just because they are thought to be a nuisance to the Treasury or others!&#146;  (Hyam and Louis, 2.721).<br>
<br>Upon retirement Poynton served between 1968 and 1977 as the director of the overseas branch of St John Ambulance. He was also a governor of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine from 1965 to 1977. Always somewhat donnish in manner, he was able to pursue his lifelong interest in classical literature. Between 1967 and 1976 he was treasurer of the Society for the Promotion of Roman Studies. He died of bronchopneumonia and heart failure at Mayday Hospital, Croydon, on 24 February 1996. He was survived by his wife and their three children.<br>
