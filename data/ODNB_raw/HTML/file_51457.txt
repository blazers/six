<span class="headword">Moss, Sir  Horace Edward</span>  (1852&#150;1912), <span class="occ">theatre and music-hall manager</span>, was born on 12 April 1852 in Ashton under Lyne, the son of James Moss, a theatre manager. He received some education in Manchester and Glasgow, musical tuition from Andrew Banks, and learned the music-hall business at his father's premises in Greenock. At the age of seventeen he became manager of a travelling company, then proprietor of a diorama of the Franco-Prussian War. In 1877 he leased the Gaiety Music Hall on Chambers Street, Edinburgh, and in 1880 purchased premises in Leith; artistes were booked to appear in both halls, thus establishing the first link in what eventually became a circuit of thirty-nine variety theatres operated by Moss throughout the British Isles. In 1884 Moss added Newcastle upon Tyne to the circuit, and, shortly after, Glasgow. His collaboration in 1890 with Richard Thornton to build the Empire Theatre in Newgate Street, Newcastle, initiated a long and prosperous partnership. &#145;Empires&#146; became his hallmark, with new premises in Edinburgh (1892, now the Festival Theatre), Sheffield (1895), Glasgow (1897), Leeds (1898), and Nottingham (1898) also bearing the name. The last-named marked the first amalgamation of Moss's interests with Oswald Stoll, whose own circuit was initially launched in Cardiff.<br>
<br>Although the music-hall industry emerged from similar types of enterprises in the major population centres of London, Glasgow, and Manchester in the 1830s and 1840s, with large halls a feature of each city by the 1850s, the lower cash input necessary in the provinces may have enabled Moss and his partners to form wider networks from which to expand than their London-based competitors. They booked the best-known artistes in the business at a time when music-hall was at its most profitable, helping to sanitize music-hall's reputation into the more benignly connotative &#145;variety&#146;, appealing to the middle classes, and being fully acceptable to audiences of both sexes. In December 1899 the multiple public limited liability companies under which Moss, Thornton, and Stoll operated merged into a single corporation, initially capitalized at &pound;1.4 million. Moss Empires Ltd was distinguished by an unusually large percentage of ordinary share capital (about 80 per cent) rather than relying on mortgage debentures and loans. Each new Moss venture floated on the Edinburgh and London stock exchanges in the 1890s, such as the amalgamated syndicate in 1899, was eagerly and fully taken up by a wide range of private investors, signifying great faith in the directors and the future of the industry. While artistes could not become true stars without garnering the praise of Londoners, as entrepreneurs Moss, his partners, and his co-investors profited from touring the London stars in growth economies all over the nation, further streamlining the booking system and reducing the friction of competition in this unified venture.<br>
<br>The Hippodrome (1900) at Charing Cross Road and Cranbourn Street, bordering on Leicester Square, was Moss's first central London property, and he managed it personally for the first five years. It offered large-scale circus, water spectacles, variety, and in the winter months extravagant pantomimes. In 1909 the circus arena was replaced by stalls and the property's distinctiveness was largely forfeited; thereafter it presented variety, opera, and ballet (including the first English performance of <span class="italic">Swan Lake</span>). While Moss took particular pride in the Hippodrome, the more typical focuses of Moss Empires Ltd immediately after the turn of the century were the expansions into the genteel residential suburbs of London, Manchester, and Birmingham (in contrast to the working-class halls of competitors such as Thomas Barrasford or Frank MacNaghten and the seaside circuit of Walter De Freece) and building replacements for the company's older or incommodious halls in city centres. The syndicate broke up in 1910, partly owing to shareholders' uneasiness with competition and conflicts of interest arising from Stoll's own independent circuit, including the London Coliseum Ltd (1904) in London, which was built up separately from Moss Empires Ltd.<br>
<br>By this time, however, Moss was increasingly withdrawn from business activities, and opted for the life of a country gentleman in Midlothian, where he was both a justice of the peace and deputy lieutenant. He married twice; first, on 19 January 1877, Ellen Alice (<i>d</i>. 1892), the daughter of Leonard Bramwell of Guernsey, and second, in 1902, Florence Nellie, the daughter of J. R. Craig of Peterborough. He had a daughter from his first marriage. He preferred to be a behind-the-scenes organizer, and seems to have been a consummate administrator. Unlike his music-hall contemporaries&#151;such as the gregarious George Edwardes, the personable Stoll, and the politically ambitious De Freece&#151;he did not generate publicity about himself, avoided the limelight, and, despite membership in Greenock and Edinburgh masonic lodges, showed little inclination for professional and fraternal conviviality. Even his choice of clubs was low-key: the Junior Constitutional, Royal Automobile, and Conservative Club (Edinburgh). His name was a virtual endorsement of business integrity, yet he took little part in the more flamboyant aspects of the theatrical and music-hall industries. Nevertheless, he was knighted in 1905, in recognition of his business success and probably also in acknowledgement for arranging several of Edward VII's dinners for the poor. He received the French government's distinction of officer of public instruction in 1912. Days before, on 23 April 1912, he underwent surgery at his home in Regent's Park, and despite an improvement in his health during the summer never resumed public life. He died at his home, Middleton Hall, Gorebridge, Midlothian, on 25 November 1912, and was buried in Portobello cemetery, Edinburgh, on 28 November.<br>
