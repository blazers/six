<span class="headword">Fellowes, Sir  Thomas</span>  (1778&#150;1853), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, was born at Minorca, the youngest son of William Fellowes MD, of Bath, physician-extraordinary to the prince regent, and his wife, the eldest daughter of Peregrine Butler of Dungarvon, co. Waterford. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9265/', "Sir James Fellowes")</script> was his brother, and his eldest sister was principal herb woman at the coronation of George IV. Fellowes served some years on East India Company ships and entered the Royal Navy in 1797, as master's mate, on the <i>Royal George</i>, with Captain Domett and Admiral Lord Bridport. He was afterwards in the frigate <i>Diana</i> with Captain Jonathan Faulknor, and then in the West Indies, serving in different ships until the peace.<br>
<br>On the renewal of the war, Fellowes was sent out to the East Indies with Sir Edward Pellew, and in 1807 was promoted lieutenant. He was then for some time in the <i>Northumberland</i>, flagship of Sir Alexander Cochrane in the West Indies. In 1808&#150;9 he commanded the brigs <i>Swinger</i> and <i>Unique</i>, in both of which he did good service against privateers and batteries; on one occasion, on 21 May 1809, he landed with twenty-four men at Basseterre of Guadeloupe, and spiked the guns of a battery in the presence of a large force of regular troops. He was the only man of the party who escaped unhurt. The <i>Unique</i> (14 guns) was afterwards expended as a fireship, and Fellowes's conduct was rewarded with a commission as commander on 16 September 1809. In August 1810 he was appointed to the command of the gunboats at Cadiz, which he held until the following June, though advanced to post rank in March. From February 1812 to November 1814 Fellowes commanded the <i>Fawn</i> (20 guns) in the West Indies, with some success against privateers; his &#145;zealous and active exertions&#146;  (O'Byrne, 352) were formally acknowledged by the governor of Cura&ccedil;ao and by the merchants, who presented him with a piece of plate. In June 1815 he was made a CB, and on 22 February 1822 he was created a knight of the Spanish order of King Charles III, in recognition of his services at Cadiz.<br>
<br>Fellowes married on 9 November 1813 Katherine Mary (<i>d</i>. October 1817), eldest daughter of Captain Sir William Abdy RN, bt: they had one son and two daughters. He married again on 24 August 1819; his second wife was Mary Anne Catharine, only child of Colonel Isaac Humphreys, Bengal artillery, military secretary to the Bengal government; they had children.<br>
<br>In 1827 Fellowes commanded the <i>Dartmouth</i> (42 guns) in the Mediterranean, and on 20 October was with the fleet at Navarino, where his action, in trying to remove a Turkish fireship, was the immediate cause of the battle. Fellowes, with the other captains, received the crosses of the L&eacute;gion d'honneur, the second class of St Anne of Russia, and the Redeemer of Greece. On his return to England he was knighted, on 13 February 1828, and was presented with a sword by the lord high admiral. He was made DCL at Oxford on 23 June 1830. He continued in command of the <i>Dartmouth</i> until 1830; in 1836 he commanded the <i>Pembroke</i> (74 guns) on the Lisbon station; and in 1837 was moved into the <i>Vanguard</i> (80 guns) in the Mediterranean, at that time considered the best ship in the service. From 1843 to 1846 he was superintendent of the hospital and victualling yard at Plymouth. After he was promoted rear-admiral on 26 July 1847, he resided mostly at Tamerton Foliot, near Plymouth. Fellowes, a tall, stout man, died at the vicarage, Great Bedwyn, Wiltshire, on 12 April 1853. His son by his second wife, Vice-Admiral Sir Charles Fellowes (1823&#150;1886), died while commanding the channel squadron.<br>
