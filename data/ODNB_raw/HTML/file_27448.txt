<span class="headword">Tilloch,  Alexander</span>  (1759&#150;1825), <span class="occ">journalist and inventor</span>, was born at Glasgow on 28 February 1759, the sixth of eleven children of John Tilloch or Tulloch, tobacco merchant and member of Glasgow town council, and Elizabeth Stivenson or Stevenson. He matriculated at Glasgow University in 1771, but did not graduate. He subsequently entered a tobacco warehouse.<br>
<br>Tilloch became interested in practical science and reinvented stereotyping in 1781&#150;2, in ignorance of the work done in the Netherlands at the beginning of the century and later by the Scot William Ged. In partnership with the stationer and printer Andrew Foulis the younger in 1783&#150;6, he published a number of stereotyped books in Glasgow, deliberately choosing cheap editions so that they did not attract the attention of other printers. Together they took out a British patent, no. 1431 of 1784, for &#145;Printing books by plates instead of moveable types, by which a greater degree of accuracy, correctness and elegance, will be obtained&#146;. Seventeen years later Tilloch was to summarize their process in the <span class="italic">Philosophical Magazine</span>. Foulis went to Chevening in Kent for eight months to show the process to Charles, third earl of Stanhope, and to the printer he employed, Andrew Wilson, for which he was said to have been paid &pound;800. Wilson developed the process and it was widely used by the time of Tilloch's death. While still in Glasgow, Tilloch married Elizabeth Simson (<i>d</i>. 1783) on 29 July 1780. They had one daughter, Elizabeth, who lived with her father until she married the novelist John Galt in 1812. Tilloch moved to London in 1787.<br>
<br>In 1789, with a number of others, Tilloch purchased a newspaper, <span class="italic">The Star</span>, which he edited until 1821. His obituary in the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> said: &#145;In this respectable paper his political opinions were mild and temperate, equally remote from the violence of party, the clamours of faction, and the unmanly servility of temporizing baseness&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 277). Tilloch was deeply religious, and like Michael Faraday was a member of the Sandemanian church in Goswell Street. As Biblicus, he published in <span class="italic">The Star</span> papers on the book of <span class="roman">Revelation</span>, which were collected as <span class="italic">Dissertation on the Opening of the Sealed Book</span>, published at Arbroath in 1819. He also wrote <span class="italic">Dissertations introductory to the study and right understanding of the language, structure and contents of the Apocalypse</span> (1823).<br>
<br>Much of the motivation for Tilloch's activities contained a philanthropic element which was of a part with his religious views. Struck by the number of executions for forgery, he invented a method for printing banknotes which he believed would make forgery impossible. Tilloch offered it to the British government about 1790, to the Bank of England in 1797, and to a royal commission in 1818: all rejected it. The French showed interest but were unable to make it work before the Napoleonic wars interrupted communication. Tilloch's process was similar to that of Augustus Applegath, which was adopted by the bank, and Tilloch unsuccessfully petitioned parliament in 1820 for some reward. He took out patents on mill machinery and a compound steam engine, but not on his method of printing banknotes.<br>
<br>In 1798 Tilloch began the <span class="italic">Philosophical Magazine</span>:<blockquote>the grand Object of it is to diffuse Philosophical knowledge among every Class of Society, and to give the Public as early an Account as possible of every thing new or curious in the scientific World, both at Home and on the Continent. (&#145;Preface&#146;, <span class="italic">Philosophical Magazine</span>, 1, 1798)</blockquote>At first the magazine competed with William Nicholson's <span class="italic">Journal of Natural Philosophy, Chemistry and the Arts</span>, founded a few months earlier, before taking it over at the end of 1813. The plan of the <span class="italic">Philosophical Magazine</span> owed much to the widely circulated <span class="italic">Observations sur la physique</span> which Abb&eacute; Fran&ccedil;ois Rozier had begun in Paris in 1771: both appeared monthly and covered physics, chemistry, natural history, and the practical arts. They printed translations of important papers from foreign journals and their frequency enabled them to announce discoveries far more quickly than the transactions of learned academies, the main pre-existing means of communication. In 1822 Tilloch took on Richard Taylor as joint editor. In Tilloch's lifetime the <span class="italic">Philosophical Magazine</span> was vital for the expansion of science at a time when new fields were being opened up rapidly. As the number of scientific journals grew the status of the magazine rose until by the middle of the century it was in Britain second in prestige only to the <span class="italic">Philosophical Transactions</span> of the Royal Society. Tilloch remained interested in technical education throughout his life and with the rise of the mechanics' institutes he started the monthly <span class="italic">Mechanic's Oracle</span> in 1824.<br>
<br>Tilloch was proposed as a fellow of the Royal Society but he withdrew his name because he believed that as the proprietor of two periodicals, one of them scientific, he would be blackballed. He was, however, a member of the Royal Irish Academy, the Geological Society, the Society of Antiquaries, and the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland.<br>
<br>After several months' illness Tilloch died on 26 January 1825 at the house he shared with one of his sisters in Barnsbury Street, Islington, London. &#145;In private life he was amiable; in conversation, acute, intelligent and communicative; few persons possessed a clearer understanding, or a warmer heart&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 281). The British Library has a catalogue of the sale of his collection of paintings, prints, coins, medals, and scientific instruments.<br>
