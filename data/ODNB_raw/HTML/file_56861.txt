<span class="headword">Tuvill <span class="st"> [Tuvell]</span>,  Daniel</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1660), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and author</span>, was perhaps a son of Michael Tuvell, Frenchman, described as a denizen, and Jone his wife, who were members of the French church in London in 1571. They lived in one of the sixteen hamlets within the precinct of St Katharine by the Tower, which included Grub Street, Shoreditch, and White Chapel. In September 1598 Daniel was admitted sizar, as born in London, to Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge, from where he graduated BA in 1601 and proceeded MA in 1607.<br>
<br>His first known published work, <span class="italic">Essaies, Politicke and Morall</span>, appeared in 1608, dedicated to Anne, Lady Harington, wife of the first Lord Harington of Exton. The dedications of other works at this time suggest that he had or sought the patronage of the Montagu family: James Montagu, who had been master of Sidney Sussex College when Tuvill was resident there, was the dedicatee of <span class="italic">Essayes Morall and Theologicall</span> (1609), and his brother Henry Montagu, first earl of Manchester, was the dedicatee of <span class="italic">The Dove, and the Serpent</span> (1614) and <span class="italic">Christian Purposes and Resolutions</span> (1622). <span class="italic">Asylum Veneris, or A Sanctuary for Ladies</span> (1616) was dedicated to Lady Alice Colville, a member of the Spencer family. All of these were conduct-book literature inspired by the works of Francis Bacon, Montaigne, and Stefano Guazzo, among others, and were heavily reliant on secondary reading for their citations of classical and patristic works, rarely acknowledged. All were signed D. T. apart from <span class="italic">Christian Purposes and Resolutions</span>, which, perhaps because its subject matter was theological, could be signed Dan. Touteville. He may also have contributed three commendatory poems to the later editions of Thomas Overbury's <span class="italic">A Wife</span>. Tuvill was vicar of St Bartholomew-the-Less, London, from 1620 to 1631, probably on the presentation of John King, diocesan bishop. He may have been a member of the English naval expedition to La Rochelle in 1627, perhaps as chaplain. He became preacher at Sutton's Hospital, Charterhouse, Clerkenwell, London, in 1630, perhaps through the patronage of John Buckeridge, who as bishop of Ely was a key governor. This post was open only to the unmarried. John Spencer of Sion College knew the Tuvill who preached at Sutton's Hospital to have been the author of the 1609 <span class="italic">Essays</span>. While there Tuvill published <span class="italic">St Pauls Threefold Cord</span> (1635), like <span class="italic">Christian Purposes and Resolutions</span> credited to Dan. Touteville; it reveals unqualified support for royal absolutism, which he saw as resisted only by Romanists. On 7 October 1643 he was sequestrated by parliament on charges of drunkenness, preaching favourably of the organs and new pictures in the chapel, neglecting fasts, and inviting royalist ministers to preach there. He was buried on 13 September 1660 at St Bartholomew-the-Less.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_75806"></a><span class="headword">Jean  l'Oiseau de Turval</span> <span class="st"> [John Byrde]</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1631), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and author</span>, was credited in the 2004 edition of this dictionary as the probable author of most of the works published by &#145;D. T.&#146;, as he signed several of his attested works D. T. &#916;. A third generation protestant, born in Paris of unknown parentage and learned in ancient and modern languages excluding English, Turval arrived in England in 1603, perhaps in the train of the marquis de Rosny, the French ambassador. He settled in London, retaining friends in the embassy. Turval was often employed by James I on secret errands to France. He translated the king's <span class="italic">Apologie for the Oath of Allegiance</span> into French, and hid for three months in Paris to get it printed there in 1609. The next year he translated extracts from Joseph Hall's works, and similarly arranged printing in Paris.<br>
<br>In 1618 Turval was still on official missions to France. The next year he was naturalized as Jean l'Oiseau. By 1623 he was a royal chaplain, a position which continued under Charles I. In 1625 he was presented by his friend John Donne, dean of St Paul's Cathedral, to St Martin Orgar in the City of London, which he resigned in 1628. Three years later, by which time he was sometimes known as Byrde, Philip Herbert, earl of Pembroke, presented him to Meppershall, Bedfordshire. However, within a short time he died, probably in London. He was buried at St Martin-in-the-Fields on 26 May 1631. He was apparently unmarried.<br>
