<span class="headword">Ashby,  Henry</span>  (1846&#150;1908), <span class="occ">paediatrician</span>, was born on 8 March 1846 at Carshalton, Surrey, the son of John Ashby, miller, and his wife, Charlotte Gibbard, both members of the Religious Society of Friends. Educated first at Ackworth School, near Pontefract, and from 1864 at the Flounder's Institute, Ackworth (which also belonged to the Society of Friends), Ashby worked for a short period as a private tutor before entering Guy's Hospital, London. Winning the gold medal for clinical medicine, he was assistant in the physiological laboratory for two years and also resident obstetric and house physician. He was admitted MRCS in 1873 and graduated MB in 1874 and MD in 1878 with a gold medal from the University of London.<br>
<br>In 1875 Ashby was appointed demonstrator of anatomy and physiology in the Liverpool school of medicine and assistant physician to the Liverpool Infirmary for Children. While in Liverpool he published the notes that he had originally compiled for his students as <span class="italic">Notes on Physiology</span> (1878), which went through several editions before his death.<br>
<br>In 1879 Ashby moved to Manchester to become honorary physician to the Manchester Hospital for Sick Children (known as Pendlebury Hospital). On 15 July that year he married Helen (<i>b</i>. 1859/60), daughter of the Revd Francis Edward Tuke of Borden, Kent. They had two sons and one daughter. One of their sons, Hugh, also entered the medical profession, following his father as physician to Pendlebury Hospital and editing Ashby's books on physiology and the diseases of children after his father's death.<br>
<br>From 1880 to 1882 Ashby was evening lecturer on animal physiology at Owens College, and from 1880 until his death he was lecturer on diseases of children, first at Owens College and then at the Victoria University. He became a member in 1883 and a fellow in 1890 of the Royal College of Physicians. An active member of the medical societies of Manchester, he promoted the transformation of the microscopical section of the Medical Society into the Pathological Society (1885), of which he was the first president (1885&#150;6). He was also president of the Medical Society and the Medico-Ethical Association. In 1902, when the British Medical Association visited Manchester, he was president of the section on children's diseases.<br>
<br>Ashby enjoyed a worldwide reputation as an expert on diseases of children. He rapidly acquired a large practice as a consultant and attracted visiting physicians from the continent and the United States to his wards at Pendlebury. He also published extensively. His major work, <span class="italic">The Diseases of Children, Medical and Surgical</span>, was written with George Wright, a surgeon at both Pendlebury and the Manchester Royal Infirmary. First published in 1889, and going through five editions before Ashby's death, <span class="italic">The Diseases of Children</span> became a leading textbook of paediatrics. Committed to preventing childhood diseases by improving the education of parents, Ashby also presented numerous public lectures and wrote a popular textbook, <span class="italic">Health in the Nursery</span> (1898). Besides these books Ashby published a large number of articles on various aspects of paediatrics in a variety of medical journals such as the <span class="italic">Medical Chronicle</span>, the <span class="italic">British Medical Journal</span>, and <span class="italic">The Practitioner</span>. In later life he became particularly interested in the psychology of the child and began a book on the subject, which he did not live to complete. In 1905 he delivered the Wightman lecture on &#145;Some neuroses of early life&#146;.<br>
<br>Ashby's commitment to the welfare of children was not confined to his hospital work. He also became closely involved in many local philanthropic and educational enterprises. In particular, in 1896 he assisted Mary Dendy in assessing the mental and physical health of nearly 40,000 Manchester school children. Their subsequent report convinced members of the Manchester school board to establish special classes and schools for mentally handicapped children in Manchester. His association with Dendy's movement to provide special institutions for mentally handicapped children and adults was extensive. He was honorary physician to the Sandlebridge boarding-schools and colony (run by the Lancashire and Cheshire Society for the Permanent Care of the Feeble-Minded, founded by Dendy in 1898), and he gave evidence before both the committee on physical deterioration (1904) and the royal commission on the care and control of the feeble-minded (1904&#150;8). In addition, he served as medical adviser to the Manchester education committee from 1904, and as consulting physician to Manchester schools for mentally handicapped, disabled, profoundly deaf, and epileptic children. In 1905 he was instrumental in encouraging the education committee to inaugurate a residential school for disabled children at Swinton, the only one of its kind then under municipal administration.<br>
<br>According to his contemporaries, Ashby's blunt and direct manner sometimes obscured his geniality and sincerity. His firm but kindly character was, however, particularly evident in his skilful examination and management of children. Although he retained his connections with the Religious Society of Friends for some years, his Quaker origins appear to have had little continuing impact on his life and work.<br>
<br>Ashby died on 6 July 1908 at his residence, New Home, 3 Lancaster Road, Didsbury, Manchester. He was cremated on 8 July at the Manchester crematorium and his ashes were interred in St James's Church, Rusholme. He was survived by his wife. Ashby's substantial contributions to paediatrics were recognized in a number of ways. A memorial scholarship was founded by Ashby's friends at the Victoria University of Manchester, to promote the study of diseases of children. A tablet was placed by his family at Pendlebury to commemorate his services to the hospital and when a hospital was built at Sandlebridge colony in 1913 it was named the Ashby Hospital.<br>
