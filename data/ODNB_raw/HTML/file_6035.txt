<span class="headword">Compton,  Spencer</span>, second earl of Northampton  (1601&#150;1643), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was born in May 1601 and baptized on 28 May at St Michael Bassishaw, London, the eldest son of Sir William Compton (<i>d</i>. 1630) of Compton Wynyates, Warwickshire, later first earl of Northampton, and his wife, Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1632), daughter and later heir of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26130/', "Sir John Spencer (d. 1610)")</script> of Canonbury, Middlesex. He was admitted to Queens' College, Cambridge, in 1614, created MA in 1615, and made knight of the Bath in November 1616. His father having become president of the council in the marches of Wales, he too was made a councillor (12 November 1617); and following his father's elevation to the peerage as earl of Northampton on 2 August 1618 he was styled Lord Compton. Granted a licence to travel in 1619, Compton was elected MP for Ludlow two years later, his path probably smoothed by his office in the marches. Soon after 20 October 1621 he married Mary (<i>d</i>. 1654), daughter of Sir Francis Beaumont of Coleorton, Leicestershire, and first cousin of the royal favourite George Villiers, marquess of Buckingham. They had two daughters and six sons, including <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/46937/', "James Compton (1622&#150;1681)")</script>, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6040/', "William Compton (1625&#150;1663)")</script>, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6032/', "Henry Compton (1631/2&#150;1713)")</script>.<br>
<br>Appointed in 1622 master of the robes to Prince Charles, Compton accompanied Charles and Buckingham to Madrid in 1623 on the mission to woo the Spanish infanta, but he became ill during the venture. On the accession of Charles as king he retained his court office and in April 1626 was summoned to the House of Lords as Baron Compton. Following his father's death on 24 June 1630, he succeeded as second earl of Northampton. Although the extravagant first earl left debts of over &pound;10,000, this made a relatively small dent in family fortunes (enhanced by the inheritance of Elizabeth Spencer), and the second earl's income in the 1630s from estates in Warwickshire, Northamptonshire, London, and six other counties was over &pound;6000 a year. He assumed his father's lord lieutenancy of Warwickshire and took on the same position in Gloucestershire, but was often absent from the midlands, leaving local administration to deputy lieutenants; this record was to tell against him later. A close friend of the king, he attended him in Scotland in 1633. He subsequently fought in the European wars, serving in George Goring's regiment at the siege of Breda in 1637, attending the prince palatine and Prince Rupert at The Hague that July, and joining the palatine's forces at the battle of Vlotho in 1638.<br>
<br>On his return to England, Northampton became master of the great wardrobe to the king. As a courtier personally loyal to the crown rather than a man of definite, discernible political views, he raised troops for the bishops' wars of 1639 and 1640. After the defeat of the royal army at Newburn in August 1640 Northampton supported the petition of the twelve peers for the summoning of parliament, but he never wavered in his opposition to the Scots, even opposing the raising of levies to pay their army of occupation. Against a background of opposition to royal policy in Warwickshire and campaigning by his political rival Robert Greville, Lord Brooke (who had a much higher profile locally), Northampton managed to get his son, James Compton, returned for one of the county seats at both elections of 1640. However, though he signed the parliamentary protestation of 1641, he was replaced as lord lieutenant of Warwickshire by Lord Brooke on 11 February 1642.<br>
<br>That summer Northampton was quick to side with the king. He joined the court at York and on 13 June 1642 signed the engagement in defence of the king; with eight other peers he was impeached for his absence from parliament. Charles appointed Northampton to the commissions of array for Warwickshire, Northamptonshire, Gloucestershire, and Gloucester. Concentrating his energies on the first, Northampton issued on 25 June 1642 the royal commission in Coventry, where he had been recorder since 1640, but he not only failed to raise any support but also prompted Brooke into holding five musters around the county for parliament. Northampton was at the centre of efforts to seize the Warwickshire magazine, and was able to assemble trained bands at four places between 28 July and 1 August. On 30 July he confronted Brooke and a convoy of artillery at Warmington Hill on the southern edge of the county.<br>
<br>A day of negotiations saw the artillery deposited at nearby Banbury, Oxfordshire, with each side promising three days' notice to the other of any attempt to remove it, but a week later, during Brooke's absence in London, Northampton secured it. Having marched on the king's orders to Warwick, he took the town and laid siege to the castle, Brooke's seat, but an unexpectedly energetic defence by Sir Edward Peyto, support for Brooke from below the ranks of the gentry, and eventually the arrival of a parliamentarian army meant that, notwithstanding a visit by Charles to the area on 20 August, Northampton was unable either to overwhelm the castle and keep Warwick or to take the other key local town, Coventry. On 22 August, the day that Charles raised his standard at Nottingham, Northampton's forces were defeated about 10 miles east of Warwick at Southam by John Hampden and Brooke. Northampton then joined the king's field army, fighting at Powick Bridge on 23 September and at Edgehill a month later. By the end of November the earl and three of his sons had captured Banbury, where they survived a siege at the end of December.<br>
<br>Commissioned lieutenant-general of royalist forces in Warwickshire and Northamptonshire in February 1643, Northampton took advantage of Brooke's absence on campaign in Staffordshire to establish garrisons throughout Warwickshire. While Brooke was killed in an attack on Lichfield, its fall to the parliamentarians placed the rest of Staffordshire under threat, and Northampton was ordered to assist his counterpart Henry Hastings. The two joined forces at Coleshill and marched to Stafford, the next target for parliamentarian commanders Sir John Gell and Sir William Brereton. Early on Sunday 19 March the royalist generals dashed out of Stafford with their horse while their foot followed behind. On Hopton Heath they found Gell and Brereton's army and launched an immediate attack. After several charges the parliamentarians were driven from their positions and their artillery captured. During the fighting Northampton had been unhorsed and surrounded by the enemy. Offered quarter, he reportedly &#145;scorned to take quarter from such base rogues and rebels as they were&#146;  (Clarendon, <span class="italic">Hist. rebellion</span>, 2.476), and was killed by a blow to the head from a halberd. The retreating parliamentarians carried his body from the field and Gell later used it as a bargaining counter in an attempt to retrieve the lost artillery. When the offer was refused, Northampton was buried at All Hallows Church, Derby; he was subsequently reburied at Compton Wynyates. His wife, Mary, who survived him, died in London on 18 March 1654 and was also buried at Compton. Their son James succeeded as third earl of Northampton.<br>
