<span class="headword">MacCodrum,  Iain <span class="st"> [John]</span></span>  (1693?&#150;1779), <span class="occ">Scottish Gaelic poet</span>, was born at Aird an Runnair in North Uist, the son of Farquhar MacCodrum (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1740), a crofter. MacCodrum lived in various locations in North Uist throughout his life. Apart from a youthful satirical piece, there are no dated poems ascribed to him until the late 1740s. Two of his poems appeared, without acknowledgement, in Alasdair Mac Mhaighstir Alasdair's collection of 1751. He had apparently been visited by his famous contemporary, who came again about 1755, when the two poets recited scurrilous songs at a local gathering attended by the Revd Donald MacQueen, and remembered in local tradition.<br>
<br>In 1760 James Macpherson, on one of his tours collecting Ossianic balladry, visited MacCodrum, who had a large fund of traditional verse and story, but Macpherson's companion took umbrage at MacCodrum's humorous slighting of his brand of Gaelic, and they left without milking this rich source of lore. In 1763 Sir James MacDonald of Sleat, baronet, met MacCodrum in Uist, and appointed him as his family bard, giving him a rent-free holding of land, and annual quantities of meal and cheese, and a small annual payment. MacDonald listened regularly to MacCodrum's recitations of Ossianic verse, and tried to improve his own knowledge of Gaelic. No doubt this sequence of events was triggered by the public prominence of James Macpherson's work at that time.<br>
<br>After his appointment MacCodrum composed a series of songs in praise of Sir James MacDonald and other chiefs and lairds, and an elegy for Sir James in 1766. Sir James's successor continued to pay the bard's emoluments, and MacCodrum travelled to neighbouring islands, and to Skye, meeting the descendants of the famous MacMhuirich poets in South Uist, and Captain Allan MacDonald, husband of the famous Flora, in Skye. MacCodrum died in 1779 and was buried in North Uist. He had been married three times, and was survived by his third wife, Mary Robertson, and by a daughter.<br>
<br>MacCodrum's poetry was widely known in his home island, and his twentieth-century editor, William Matheson, reported that in the early 1930s there was a man in North Uist who knew seventeen of his poems, from traditional sources. Matheson's edition, published in 1938, is compiled from oral tradition and from a long list of books and manuscripts dating from 1751 to 1933, including Alasdair Mac Mhaighstir Alasdair's 1751 collection, the McLagan Manuscripts, the Eigg collection of 1776, John Mackenzie's <span class="italic">Beauties of Gaelic Poetry</span> of 1841, and the collection of work by Uist bards (1894).<br>
<br>MacCodrum's songs in praise of the chiefs and lairds tend to be extended, and fairly conventional, using many of the stereotypes common in such verse, and referring to a succession of clans and their military prowess, but showing a good knowledge of Gaelic legend and history. He uses a variety of metrical forms, three-line, seven-line, and eight-line stanzas, and some more extended ones. In a poem composed during the Seven Years' War (1756&#150;63) he comments quite knowledgeably on the participants in that struggle, but then concentrates on a local altercation.<br>
<br>The songs concerning local events and personalities are the most successful part of MacCodrum's output, combining wit, observation, and satire, and making what can probably be regarded as an early and major contribution to the corpus of so-called &#145;village verse&#146; which was to retain its popularity into the late twentieth century. He has songs about old age, a dispute between the Friend and the Enemy of Whisky, satires on individuals, a satire on Uist tailors, a light-hearted complaint about his wife, a song about a bout of fever, and so on.<br>
<br>MacCodrum's verse has been authoritatively edited by William Matheson, in the edition published by the Scottish Gaelic Texts Society in 1938, and Matheson draws on tradition and manuscripts to establish the main pattern of his life. Donald Archie MacDonald, a fellow North Uist man, added his own perspective to MacCodrum's work in an article in <span class="italic">Gairm</span>, 129 (1985).<br>
