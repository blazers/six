<span class="headword">Wright, Sir  Martin</span>  (1692/3&#150;1767), <span class="occ">judge</span>, was the eldest son of William Wright, a barrister, and his second wife, Dorothy Finch. He was born into a legal family: his father was recorder of Oxford, a judge in Wales, and a bencher of the Inner Temple, serving as treasurer of the inn in 1719; his brother John also became a barrister of the Inner Temple. In 1709, at the age of sixteen, he matriculated from Exeter College, Oxford, and in November of the same year was admitted to his father's inn, where he was called to the bar in 1718. Wright married Elizabeth, daughter and coheir of Hugh Willoughby MD, of Barton Stacy, Hampshire; and they had two sons and two daughters. Their marriage settlement was dated 2 December 1719.<br>
<br>Wright achieved public notice in 1730 by the publication of his <span class="italic">Introduction to the Law of Tenures</span>, and three years later he was created serjeant-at-law. In 1738 he obtained an appointment as one of the king's serjeants, and the following year became a baron of the exchequer. Hardwicke had recommended Giles Eyre, a fellow king's serjeant, whom Walpole rejected as a tory, but had also suggested Wright as &#145;a very thorough Whig and a good lawyer&#146;  (Lemmings, 277). Mr Baron Abney wrote in his notebook that the appointment so disappointed Eyre that it hastened his death  (Abney's reports, MS IHR 976). Wright remained in the court of exchequer for but one year, from November 1739 until November 1740, when he was translated to the king's bench. In company with other judges he was knighted in 1745, on the occasion of the loyal address after the Jacobite rising. He reported cases throughout his judgeship of the king's bench; the manuscript was bequeathed to the Inner Temple, where it remains, in fourteen volumes; there are also some of his exchequer reports in manuscript, preserved in a copy taken by Thomas Parker (and now in the Lilly Library, Bloomington, Indiana). On 6 February 1755 he surrendered his patent on grounds of ill health, and was granted a pension which was renewed by George III in 1761. He nevertheless lived another twelve years after retirement, dying at Fulham on 26 September 1767.<br>
