</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Kell, Sir  Vernon George Waldegrave</span>  (1873&#150;1942), <span class="occ">intelligence officer</span>, was born on 21 November 1873 at the barracks, South Town, Matford, Suffolk, the only son of Major Waldegrave Charles Vernon Kell of the South Staffordshire regiment and his wife, Georgiana Augusta Konarska. Kell's skill as a linguist led at first to thoughts of the diplomatic service, but in 1892 he entered the Royal Military College at Sandhurst and two years later joined his father's old regiment. Here he continued his study of languages, qualifying as an interpreter in French and German and, after studying in Moscow in 1898, in Russian. In 1900 he married Constance Rawdon Scott, whose drive and ambition were in marked contrast to his natural reserve. He was afterwards posted to Shanghai to learn Chinese, but he became caught up in the Boxer uprising and was unable to qualify as a Chinese interpreter until 1903. He then returned to London to a post in the German intelligence section of the War Office, but in 1905 he transferred to the Far Eastern section, and in 1907 moved to the committee of imperial defence (CID), where he was involved in writing the official history of the Russo-Japanese War.<br>
<br>In 1909 the CID was asked to investigate the danger of German espionage and, influenced by widespread fears of invasion, recommended the establishment of a new Secret Service Bureau. Kell agreed to retire from the army to become its military representative, although, as his wife recalled, he was warned by his friends &#145;that he would find himself thrown over, if he were to make the slightest slip&#146;  (Kell). His chronic asthma and limited budget kept him from active enquiries, but he began the methodical collection of suspicious reports, and gradually gained the confidence of a select group of chief constables and government officials. Kell was convinced that the German army was already planning invasion, and arranged for the secret registration of more than 30,000 resident aliens, who he was convinced formed the basis of a network of military agents and saboteurs. He also detected a small group of German naval agents who were seeking technical information about the Royal Navy, and marked them down for arrest on the outbreak of war. This was the total extent of German espionage in Britain, but the efficient destruction of this network in August 1914 was overshadowed by Kell's redoubled efforts to locate the non-existent army of German saboteurs who he was convinced were still at large.<br>
<br>During the war Kell's counter-espionage department, rechristened MI5, brought thirty-one German agents to trial, but its principal work remained the hunt for wider and more subtle conspiracies. When full conscription was introduced in May 1916 Kell accepted that the British peace movement had now to be &#145;classed as pro-German&#146; and MI5 began the intensive surveillance of more than 5000 individuals  (memo by Major V. Ferguson, 14 June 1916, TNA: PRO, HO 45/10801/307402, file 75). By October 1917 its registry contained almost 40,000 personal files, and 1 million cross-index cards, and its principal work had become the collection and analysis of information on a vast range of innocent individuals and organizations. Kell was appointed CB in 1917 and KBE in 1919.<br>
<br>By the end of the war in November 1918 Kell had a staff of 850 and an annual budget of &pound;100,000 devoted to this work, but the intelligence reorganization of 1919 saw many of MI5's responsibilities transferred to the special branch of Scotland Yard. Kell's budget was cut to &pound;35,000, his staff was reduced to just thirty, and his duties were confined to counter-espionage and the combating of communism within the armed forces. Over the next six years he fought a running battle with the special branch and MI6, the foreign intelligence service, simply to preserve the existence of his unit.<br>
<br>The post-war &#145;red scare&#146; seemed ideal for MI5, as it demanded the cross-checking of vast numbers of suspects, and apparently confirmed that democracy required strengthening from outside by determined men such as Kell. However, financial constraints prevented MI5 from recruiting young staff and forced Kell to rely heavily on personal links with business and political organizations, often on the far right. Yet he continued to inspire loyalty in his hand-picked staff, and with their help managed to double the size of his bizarre &#145;precautionary index&#146;, which by February 1925 included more than 25,000 supposedly dangerous individuals, carefully classified by blood, by racial interests, and by sympathy and friendship. MI5's official historian considered it &#145;a tribute to Sir Vernon Kell's personality that the organisation was kept in being under such conditions&#146;, and gradually his obsessive search for disloyalty gained official backing  (Curry, 66). In October 1931 MI5, now known as the &#145;security service&#146;, was given responsibility for investigating communism throughout the United Kingdom, using staff transferred from the special branch and MI6, and in 1934 it also gained the task of investigating fascism. This produced a rapid increase in MI5's resources and, although in 1935 Kell's staff numbered just over ninety, within four years it had grown to 330, with an annual budget of more than &pound;90,000 and a secret registry containing some 250,000 personal files.<br>
<br>Unfortunately MI5's obsessive indexing of possible suspects revealed almost nothing about actual secret service operations in Britain, and on the outbreak of war in September 1939 its ramshackle registry was overwhelmed by requests for security clearance. Kell, whose health had begun to fail, no longer enjoyed the confidence of senior officials, and when Winston Churchill became prime minister in May 1940 he dismissed both Kell and his deputy, Eric Holt-Wilson. Constance Kell informed MI5 staff that &#145;your precious Winston has sacked the General&#146;  (West, 153), and insult was added to injury through the granting of an ungenerous pension.<br>
<br>According to Sir Dick White, Kell was &#145;a calm, modest and patient man, which made it seem obvious that fly-fishing was his chosen hobby&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>). He retired to a small rented cottage, Stonepits, Emberton, Olney, in Buckinghamshire, where he died on 27 March 1942; he was survived by his wife.<br>
