<span class="headword">Katherine</span> <span class="st"> [Catalina, Katherine of Lancaster]</span>  (1372&#150;1418), <span class="occ">queen of Castile, consort of Enrique III</span>, was the youngest of the three daughters of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/14843/', "John of Gaunt, duke of Lancaster (1340&#150;1399)")</script>, and his second wife, Constanza (1354&#150;1394), daughter and heir of Pedro I of Castile, whose death at the hands of his half-brother Enrique of Trast&aacute;mara (Enrique II) in 1369 gave John a claim to the Castilian throne in his wife's right. Probably born at Hertford, as an infant, in January 1375, Katherine had her own household at Melbourne, Derbyshire, but from mid-April 1380 until at least 1382 she lived with Joan Burghersh, Lady Mohun, a widowed kinswoman of her father. In 1381 she was recorded as Katerine d'Espaigne, suggesting that a role in Iberian affairs was foreseen for her, and in 1386 she and her sisters accompanied their parents on an expedition to Castile to press John's claims to its throne. He occupied Santiago with ease, but in 1387 withdrew to Portugal after an unsuccessful invasion of Le&oacute;n, and subsequently accepted the proposal of King Juan, Enrique's son, that Katherine should marry his son, another Enrique, and that he and his wife should renounce their claims. A final treaty was ratified at Bayonne in Gascony on 8 July 1388.<br>
<br>On 5 August 1388 Katherine declared that she entered freely into the marriage and accepted the treaty arrangements. These included a dower of the towns of Soria, Almaz&aacute;n, Atienza, Deza, and Molina, and licence to adhere in her private worship to the Urbanist papal obedience (in September 1390 she succumbed to pressure to accept the authority of the Avignon papacy, of which she became a staunch supporter). On 17 September 1388 she was married to the nine-year-old Enrique in Palencia Cathedral. Her husband succeeded to the throne in 1390, and began to rule in 1393. Katherine&#151;in Spanish Catalina&#151;was of minor political importance during Enrique's reign, except in bearing three children, Maria (1401), Catalina (1402), and the future Juan II (1405). Her remaining energies seem to have been devoted to religious patronage, especially of the Dominicans. All this changed when Enrique died in 1406. According to the terms of his will, his brother Fernando and his widow were to be joint regents during Juan's minority, but the custody of his son was to be entrusted to two nobles, Diego L&oacute;pez de St&uacute;&ntilde;iga and Juan Fern&aacute;ndez de Velasco. Rather than hand over her son, in 1407 Catalina prepared to defend herself and her household in the Alc&aacute;zar at Segovia, but Fernando eventually brokered a deal that enabled her to keep her son. Nevertheless, distrust between the regents was exacerbated by Fernando's plans to lead his brother's planned campaign against the kingdom of Granada, separating the two regents and consequently, under Enrique's will, necessitating a division of rule. The royal council awarded Catalina control of the northern kingdoms of Castile and Le&oacute;n. Tensions between the regents persisted, not least over Catalina's favours to Velasco and St&uacute;&ntilde;iga, and in 1409 Fernando insisted on their expulsion from her court. Thereafter she became co-operative in providing financial support for his costly Granadan campaigns.<br>
<br>In consequence of her increasing involvement in wars in the south, Castile's alliance with France languished, and Catalina was able to cultivate better relations with Portugal (where her half-sister <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22111/', "Philippa")</script> was queen) and with England, along lines her father would have approved. She was on good terms with Richard II, while her dealings with her half-brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/12951/', "Henry IV")</script>, infused with personal warmth, had beneficial effects. Although there was no peace treaty, the two rulers fostered Anglo-Castilian trade by granting numerous safe conducts, while Catalina, who herself bought costly fabrics in London, sponsored a series of unilateral truces between 1410 and 1416. Her international policies boosted the prosperity of Castilian communities, whereas her co-regent's were a drain on it. However, although as a result of Fernando's pursuit of the throne of Aragon, Seville, C&oacute;rdoba, and Ja&eacute;n were brought within her sphere of control, his attainment of his ambition in 1412, and his death in 1416, had the effect of reducing Catalina's authority, by depriving his rivals of incentives to support her. Government became increasingly conciliar, and Catalina&#151;who may have been partially incapacitated by a stroke&#151;relinquished the custody of her son.<br>
<br>A vivid account of Catalina towards the end of her life was later recorded by Fern&aacute;n P&eacute;rez de Guzm&aacute;n. It suggests that she may have inherited physical characteristics from her father, and also that she was a sick woman:<blockquote>The queen was tall of body and very fat. She was pink and white in her complexion and fair. In her figure and her movements she seemed as much like a man as a woman. She was very virtuous and reserved in her person and in her reputation; generous and magnificent in her ways but very much devoted to favourites and greatly ruled by them&#151;a thing which, in general, is a vice common to royal personages. She was not very well ordered in her body and had a serious affliction of the palsy which did not leave her tongue properly loose or her bodily movements free. (Guzm&aacute;n, 19&#150;20)</blockquote>Whatever the effects of her favouritism&#151;she was twice obliged to banish ladies from her household&#151;they should not be allowed to obscure either the constructive effects of her initiatives in foreign policy, or the concern to protect the interests of Juan II which infused her domestic statecraft. Catalina died at Valladolid on 2 June 1418, and was buried with her husband in the capilla de los reyes nuevos in Toledo Cathedral. Her monumental effigy portrays her with a long face and highly arched forehead.<br>
