<span class="headword">Love,  John</span>  (1695&#150;1750), <span class="occ">literary scholar</span>, was born at Dumbarton in July 1695, the son of John Love, bookseller and stationer; he was probably the John Love presented for baptism there on 11 July 1695 by John Love and Elizabeth Thomsone. From about 1700 he was educated at Dumbarton grammar school and then at Glasgow University; later he became assistant, and in 1721 successor, to his old schoolteacher. The school was inspected in 1729 by a presbytery committee which found it to be in a flourishing condition and expressed full satisfaction with the master. Smollett was among his pupils and later showed his regard by seeking help for one of Love's sons. Love married Elizabeth, daughter of Archibald Campbell, a Glasgow surgeon, in 1722, and they had thirteen children. He also had two children from his second marriage, to Gelis Elphinston, a minister's daughter. At Dumbarton, Love was also clerk to the presbytery from 1717 to 1735; his minister, Archibald Sydserf, was forced to apologize following an accusation of brewing on a Sunday. In 1735 Love was appointed a master of the high school in Edinburgh and in 1739, at the request of the duke of Buccleuch, he moved to his final post as rector of Dalkeith grammar school.<br>
<br>Love's publications centred on three controversies. First, he produced in 1733 two treatises on Latin grammar, criticizing a grammar by Robert Trotter, schoolmaster at Dumfries, and defending Thomas Ruddiman's <span class="italic">Grammar</span> respectively. The second controversy concerned the Latin paraphrase of the <span class="roman">Psalms</span> by George Buchanan. With Robert Hunter, later professor of Greek at Edinburgh University, Love prepared an edition of this work in 1737 that made considerable use of Nathan Chytraeus's commentary to earlier editions and emphasized the work's educational as well as religious value. In 1740, writing as &#145;Philo-Buchananus&#146;, Love defended Buchanan against William Lauder and William Benson who had asserted the superiority of the version of the <span class="roman">Psalms</span> by Arthur Johnston. Thus far Love had the support of Thomas Ruddiman. Third, in his <span class="italic">Vindication of Mr. George Buchanan</span> published in 1749, Love discussed other aspects of the author's life, refuting the accusation of ingratitude to Mary, queen of Scots, and William Camden's suggestion that at the end of his life Buchanan had repented of his treatment of her. By this time, however, Ruddiman's estimation of Buchanan had fallen for political reasons and he wrote a critical reply to Love.<br>
<br>Love also corresponded with Sir John Clerk on literary matters and he appointed John Traill, bookseller in Edinburgh, as factor and curator to his children. He died at Dalkeith on 20 September 1750, survived by his second wife.<br>
