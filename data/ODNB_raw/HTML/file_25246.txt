<span class="headword">Shaw,  Cuthbert</span>  (1738/9&#150;1771), <span class="occ">poet</span>, was born at Ravensworth, near Richmond, Yorkshire, the son of Cuthbert Shaw (<i>bap</i>. 1711), shoemaker, and his wife, Ann, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Neeson. After schooling at Kirby Hill and Scorton, both near Richmond, he became a school usher, first at Scorton, then at Darlington grammar school. At Scorton he was befriended by George Allan (1736&#150;1800), the antiquary; at Darlington he published his first poem, <span class="italic">Liberty</span> (1756), inscribed to Henry Vane, first earl of Darlington. The poem was thoroughly damned in the <span class="italic">Monthly Review</span>, 14 (1756), 575&#150;6.<br>
<br>Obliged to leave Darlington on account of some unspecified imprudence, Shaw found irregular work as an actor between 1758 and 1762 in Norwich, Ireland, and London. He also published <span class="italic">Odes on the Four Seasons</span> under the pen-name W. Seymour at Bury St Edmunds (1760). His only stage success was a run of thirty-five performances as Sir George Wealthy in Samuel Foote's comedy <span class="italic">The Minor</span> at the Haymarket from June 1760. His last appearance was at Covent Garden, as Pierre in Otway's <span class="italic">Venice Preserv'd</span> on 14 May 1762 for his own benefit. Then, &#145;partly losing his nose [from syphilis], he withdrew from the world, and employed himself wholly in a literary capacity&#146;  (Highfill, Burnim &amp; Langhans, <span class="italic">BDA</span>, 13.290).<br>
<br>Shaw settled in Marylebone, Middlesex, and subsisted by writing paragraphs for newspapers and verse satires, the first of which, <span class="italic">The Four Farthing-Candles</span> (1762), attacks Charles Churchill, Robert Lloyd, George Colman, and the dramatist William Shirley. His <span class="italic">The Race</span> (1765), by &#145;Mercurius Spur&#146;, with mock pedantic notes by &#145;Faustinus Scriblerus&#146;, is a more substantial work; it is modelled on the booksellers' race in Pope's <span class="italic">Dunciad</span> and attacks Smollett, Mallet, Murphy, and many lesser figures, though Churchill is now praised. Of Shaw's portrait of Johnson, quoted in Boswell's <span class="italic">Life</span>, Johnson reportedly said, &#145;the Author bore no ill-will, he has paid me a great compliment and I am obliged to him&#146;  (Boswell, <span class="italic">Life</span>, 2.480). A revised, enlarged edition of <span class="italic">The Race</span> appeared in 1766.<br>
<br>In May 1765 Shaw's neighbour in Marylebone, who kept a boarding-school attended by the fourth earl of Chesterfield's nine-year-old godson and heir, recommended Shaw as a man of sound classical learning who had been &#145;head-master to a great school&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters</span>, ed. Dobr&eacute;, 2652). Consequently the boy was sent to Shaw for tuition: two hours each morning and evening for four months until William Dodd (another master of misrepresentation) became his tutor. On 5 November 1765 at St Mary's Church, Marylebone, Shaw married Ann Rivers, of a good family, against the wishes of her friends. Her early death in childbirth prompted Shaw's best-known poem, <span class="italic">A Monody to the Memory of a Young Lady</span> (1768). This work brought him to the attention of George Lyttelton (author of a similarly affecting poem on the death of his own wife) and John Wilkes; the second edition (1769) was dedicated to Lyttelton. To the third edition (1770) was added <span class="italic">An Evening Address to a Nightingale</span>, Shaw's elegy on the three-year-old daughter whose birth had cost her mother's life.<br>
<br>Meanwhile Shaw had involved himself in opposition politics. His verse satire <span class="italic">Corruption</span>, inscribed to Richard Grenville, Earl Temple, appeared in December 1768. In August 1769 he became editor of <span class="italic">The Middlesex Journal, or, The Chronicle of Liberty</span>, and asked Wilkes, who was then in prison, and other friends of freedom to write in its support  (BL, Add. MS 30870, fol. 186). Later that year he was writing caustic political pieces in the pro-Wilkes <span class="italic">Freeholder's Magazine, or, Monthly Chronicle of Liberty</span>, where, in April and May 1770, also appeared long extracts from his unpublished poem &#145;Resignation&#146;. He wrote an elegy on Charles Yorke, lord chancellor, who died on 20 January 1770, but Yorke's family paid to have it suppressed, perhaps because of Shaw's politics or bad character.<br>
<br>Shaw suffered from poor health, dissipation, and poverty. Mention of the &#145;Theban drug&#146; in the <span class="italic">Monody</span> refers to his opium habit, and a letter to George Allan in 1769 tells of pawned property and &#145;the vast expense of physic and asses' milk which I am obliged constantly to use&#146;  (Longstaffe, 256n.). Near the end of his life his uncertain literary income was augmented by profits from his part-ownership, with Francis Newbery (1743&#150;1818), of some patent medicines, including the once celebrated &#145;Beaume de vie&#146;, on the virtues of which he wrote an untraced <span class="italic">Account</span>. This nostrum may be identical with one of the same name on sale a decade earlier in Paris and composed of aloes, gentian, rhubarb, myrrh, agaric, saffron, and zedoary, helped down by treacle, sugar, and proof spirit; it was said to restore and fortify the stomach. At least it was effective in making Shaw &#145;able to set up his equipage, house, servants, &amp;c.&#146;  (ibid.). He had already distanced himself from his one-time acquaintance, and perhaps drinking companion, the poet Christopher Smart.<br>
<br>Shaw died intestate, in debt, and, it was said, &#145;overwhelmed with complicated distress&#146;, on 1 September 1771 at his house in Titchfield Street, Oxford Market, London  (<span class="italic">London Magazine</span>, 1771, 472). In view of the profitability of patent medicines his own distress was probably due to mismanagement, but, as his patents had another fifty years to run, they perhaps enriched his next of kin (two uncles in Yorkshire) and their descendants.<br>
