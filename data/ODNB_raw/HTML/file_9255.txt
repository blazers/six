<span class="headword">Umfreville <span class="st"> [<em>alias </em>Fell]</span>,  Charles</span>  (1687&#150;1763), <span class="occ">Roman Catholic priest</span>, born in England, the son of Charles Umfreville, was of French descent; he used the alias of Fell in England. After studying philosophy and divinity at the <i>communaut&eacute;</i> of Monsieur Duvieux he was sent to St Gregory's seminary at Paris in 1707. Later in the year he went to Douai to learn English and to complete his course of scholastic theology, although his later opponents spoke of his poor English. In 1709 he returned to Paris, and in 1713 was ordained priest. He was created DD in 1716. Shortly afterwards he went on the English mission and resided principally in London, where he devoted his leisure time to the compilation of <span class="italic">The lives of saints, collected from authentick records of church history, with a full account of the other festivals throughout the year, to which is prefixed a treatise on the moveable feasts and fasts of the church</span>, published anonymously in four volumes in 1729. A second edition appeared in 1750. Robert Witham, the president of Douai, wrote observations on this work and denounced it at Rome, his principal complaint being that Umfreville had taken his <span class="italic">Lives</span> chiefly from Bachlet, and had recorded few miracles. The publication of the <span class="italic">Lives</span> involved Umfreville in such pecuniary difficulties that when he was required to give a statement of his accounts of the London clergy funds, for which he was a deputy during the period 1728&#150;57, he was found to owe &pound;1272. Of this sum he was unable to pay more than 10<i>d</i>. in the pound in 1731. In the following year his irregular election as a member of the chapter gave rise to much contention, and to some publications. The case was decided against him on appeal. In 1755 he was named superior of St Gregory's, Paris, but declined the office on account of health and age. He died in Gray's Inn on 22 October 1763, and was buried five days later in St Pancras churchyard.<br>
