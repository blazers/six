<span class="headword">Davey,  Horace</span>, Baron Davey  (1833&#150;1907), <span class="occ">judge</span>, was born in Camberwell, Surrey, on 29 August 1833, the third son of Peter Davey (<i>d</i>. 1879), a prosperous wholesale coal and coke merchant in London, and his wife, Caroline Emma, daughter of William Pace, rector of Rampisham-cum-Wraxall, Dorset. He entered Rugby School in August 1848, being placed in Mayor's house, and won an open scholarship to University College, Oxford, in 1852. Davey matriculated on 20 March of that year, and went on to enjoy a highly distinguished academic career. Having gained a double first class in classics and mathematics, in both moderations (1854) and the final schools (1855&#150;6), Davey was elected Johnson's mathematical scholar in 1857, senior mathematical scholar in 1858, and Eldon law scholar in 1859. He graduated BA in 1856 and proceeded MA in 1859. He was a fellow of University College from 1856 to 1864.<h2>
<a name="Earlyyearsatthebar"></a>Early years at the bar</h2>Davey had been admitted a student of Lincoln's Inn on 19 January 1857 and was called to the bar on 26 January 1861. On 5 August 1862, at St George's, Camberwell, he married Louisa Hawes, daughter of John Donkin of Ormond House, Old Kent Road, London, a civil engineer; they had two sons and four daughters. In his first few years of practice, Davey served on the staff of a short-lived series of law reports&#151;the <span class="italic">New Reports</span>. He was an equity reporter from November 1862 to August 1863 and a House of Lords reporter from November 1863 to August 1864. His colleagues at the <span class="italic">New Reports</span> included Farrer Herschell (subsequently lord chancellor) and Roland Vaughan Williams and James Stirling (both subsequently lord justice of appeal). Davey joined the chambers of John (later Sir John) Wickens at 8 New Square, Lincoln's Inn, regarded at the time as the most distinguished school of equity pleading, and subsequently devilled for Wickens himself, who was junior counsel to the Treasury in Chancery matters. Ashton recounts in his memoirs that during this time Davey would slave over the numerous briefs which had been assigned to Wickens, while the latter &#145;lay on his stomach before the fire and read novels of every kind in various languages&#146;. Wickens was clearly impressed with his devil's work, confiding in Edward (later Lord) Macnaghten that in Davey he had at last found a pupil of whose success he felt assured. Davey acquired a substantial junior practice in the Chancery courts, and when Wickens was raised to the bench in 1871 Davey succeeded to a considerable portion of his practice. He was appointed secretary to his old master, Vice-Chancellor Wickens, in 1871, and was later secretary to Vice-Chancellor Hall from 1873 to 1874.<h2>
<a name="Leadingthechancerybar"></a>Leading the chancery bar</h2>Davey took silk, &#145;with strange misgiving and much hesitation&#146; according to Lord Macnaghten, on 23 June 1875, electing to practise in the court of Sir George Jessel MR, where his main opponent was Joseph Chitty. He elected to &#145;go special&#146; in 1881. Davey's reputation as a senior is generally regarded to have been unrivalled. He was the acknowledged leader of the chancery bar for well over a decade&#151;Lord Macnaghten said that from about the time of Davey's speech in the Lord St Leonards will case until his promotion to the bench, &#145;there was no case of importance in the Court of Chancery in which he was not retained.&#146; He also had a strong House of Lords practice, Viscount Alverstone later recalling that, &#145;of all the men who were largely engaged in appeal cases before the House of Lords, I think Sir Horace Davey &hellip; was among the most brilliant.&#146; Further, given his wide knowledge of numerous foreign legal systems, he was much in demand as counsel before the judicial committee of the privy council. The cases of note&#151;many of them still good law&#151;in which Davey appeared as senior counsel are simply too numerous to list, although it might give some indication of his great versatility and importance as counsel to note that <i>Speight v. Gaunt</i> (1883), <i>Learoyd v. Whiteley</i> (1887), and <i>Derry v. Peek</i> (1889) were all argued by him.<br>
<br>Davey's outstanding success at the bar was due to the classic combination of remarkable intelligence, great versatility, and sheer hard work: Viscount Haldane, one of Davey's pupils, thought him &#145;the finest advocate on pure points of law that I have ever seen &hellip; [i]n legal matters he had a mind like a razor, and was accurate to the last degree&#146;  (Haldane, 35); Lord Macnaghten said that he seemed &#145;as much at home in arguing a point of practice as he was in explaining a complicated invention or illustrating and applying one of the great principles of equity or dealing with the mysteries of ecclesiastical law or some constitutional question before the Privy Council&#146;; and he would usually begin work at four or five in the morning, and thought nothing of working solidly through the weekend. Perhaps his success before the privy council was further attributable to his belief that cases before that tribunal &#145;should be drawn in such a form that old gentlemen could read them in their libraries after dinner without referring to anything else&#146;  (Ashton). His success did not, however, stem from gifts of oratory or forensic advocacy. The anonymous author of <span class="italic">Pie Powder</span> wrote that &#145;the intellectual effort necessary to follow his utterances was always considerable; and the absence of anything like animation in his voice and delivery was so ostentatious, that one sometimes wondered how he had forced himself into prominence at all&#146;&#151;even his former pupil Haldane accepted that &#145;he could not cross-examine well, nor could he address a jury.&#146; But these were not the characteristics necessary to achieve success at the chancery bar or before the highest appeal courts&#151;what mattered there was detailed knowledge of the law and clarity of argument, and in those fields Davey excelled. Haldane writes of his being retained in an &#145;almost overwhelming&#146; number of cases, and at the peak of his success he earned in excess of &pound;25,000 per annum  (Haldane, 36).<h2>
<a name="Politics"></a>Politics</h2>Davey also harboured political aspirations, but here success largely eluded him. He was elected MP for Christchurch, in the Liberal interest, in April 1880, but lost his seat in the general election of November 1885. In spite of his poor parliamentary performances, and indeed despite his not at the time having a seat in the Commons, he was appointed solicitor-general by Gladstone on 16 February 1886. He received the customary knighthood on 8 March of that year. His tenure of this office was again undistinguished, and he was obliged to relinquish it when the Gladstone administration fell in August 1886. In that same year, Davey sought re-election to the Commons, unsuccessfully contesting both Ipswich and Stockport. Eventually, he won a seat in Stockton-on-Tees in a by-election of December 1888, but despite his large majority he failed to retain the seat in the July 1892 general election. Davey soon afterwards acquired judicial office, and the 1892 election marked the end of an undistinguished political career. Davey's lack of political success is widely acknowledged. Haldane wrote of his &#145;deficiencies in the House of Commons&#146;, and the <span class="italic">Law Journal</span> noted that &#145;Sir Horace Davey was &hellip; not of the stuff of which successful politicians are made&#146;. One obvious reason for this lack of success was Davey's inability to court the electorate. His public manner was somewhat austere, and just as he lacked the urbanity to succeed at <i>nisi prius</i> work in the lawcourts, so he was unsuited to the showmanship of the hustings. His poor powers of oratory must also have impeded his political advancement&#151;someone of Davey's oratorical shortcomings could simply not have hoped to make a name for himself as a parliamentarian. Haldane recalls, for instance, his old master's speech on the <span class="roman">Irish Crimes Bill</span>&#151;although he set aside all other work to prepare for it, on the day &#145;it went off&#146;, according to John Morley, &#145;like a magnum of soda water that has stood for two days with the cork out&#146;. There is no doubt that Davey very much desired political success, but it was not to be. He had to be content with making his mark on legal, rather than political history.<h2>
<a name="Onthebench"></a>On the bench</h2>Given his almost unrivalled reputation at the bar, it should have occasioned little surprise when Davey was raised to the bench. He was appointed directly to the Court of Appeal on 23 September 1893, in place of his friend Sir Charles Bowen who had been created a lord of appeal-in-ordinary. He was sworn of the privy council one month later, on 23 November. Davey spent less than a year sitting as a lord justice of appeal, although in that time he heard some notable cases, such as <i>Monson v. Tussauds Ltd</i> (1894), and acquired a reputation for both patience and urbanity in the execution of his judicial role. His intellectual abilities, never in doubt at the bar, he applied with similar success on the bench.<br>
<br>Davey was appointed a lord of appeal-in-ordinary on 13 August 1894, taking the place of Lord Russell of Killowen who had accepted an invitation to become lord chief justice. On the same day he was created a baron for life by the style of Baron Davey of Fernhurst, in Sussex. Davey was to sit in the appellate committee of the House of Lords and in the judicial committee of the privy council from 1894 until his death some thirteen years later. His judicial output was consequently prolific, and involved matters ranging from legal technicalities to some of the great <i>causes c&eacute;l&egrave;bres</i> of the day. Among the latter were <i>Russell v. Russell</i> (1897), where Davey formed part of a bare majority of law lords who refused to grant Lord Russell a judicial separation on the grounds of Lady Russell's cruelty (she having made certain allegations, which she continued to make after she no longer believed them to be true, to the effect that Lord Russell had engaged in homosexual activity), and <i>General Assembly of the Free Church of Scotland v. Lord Overtoun</i> (1904), a major case concerning the fundamental doctrines of the Free Church and some &pound;2 m. worth of its property.<br>
<br>Davey was also involved in a number of legal, rather than social, <i>causes c&eacute;l&egrave;bres</i>, cases which continue to be recognized instantly by modern legal practitioners. Examples of such cases include <i>Salomon v. Salomon</i> (1896), the seminal authority on the nature of incorporation; and <i>Allen v. Flood</i> (1898), a landmark decision on the propriety of the activities of trade unions (and one that led to considerable infighting between the Liberal and Conservative factions of the law lords, not the first or last time that the Liberal Davey would clash with staunchly Conservative colleagues like the lord chancellor, Halsbury).<br>
<br>But perhaps the finest testament to Davey's judicial abilities is the considerable number of his judgments which, despite their being a century old, remain good law. Cases like <i>Walter v. Lane</i> (1900) (the major ruling on reporters' copyright); <i>Burland v. Earle</i> (1901) (concerning the fraud on the minority exception to the rule in <i>Foss v. Harbottle</i>, 1843); <i>Noakes &amp; Co Ltd v. Rice</i> (1901) and <i>Bradley v. Carritt</i> (1903) (both concerning the rules governing collateral benefits in mortgage law); and <i>Ruben v. Great Fingall Consolidated</i> (1906) (establishing the effect of a forged share certificate on a company) continue to be studied and cited by legal students and practitioners, guaranteeing Davey a degree of immortality among successive generations of lawyers.<br>
<br>In 1905, towards the end of his life, Davey pressed a claim to the woolsack in the Campbell-Bannerman administration, although nothing came of this. Edmund Gosse (the librarian of the House of Lords) attributed this lack of success at least partly to Davey's long absence from active party politics and to the cold personality which had earlier worked against him in his efforts to forge a reputation in parliament. He cannot have been helped by the fact that his ally Lord Spencer was prevented by ill health from advising on the appointment of the Campbell-Bannerman cabinet.<h2>
<a name="Assessmentanddeath"></a>Assessment and death</h2>Davey the judge was, like Davey the barrister, almost peerless in his time. Atlay considered him and his colleague Lord Lindley to be &#145;two of the very greatest judicial intellects of [their] generation&#146;, while Lord Macnaghten wrote of &#145;how much he added to the strength of the House of Lords and the Privy Council&#146;, referring to his &#145;weight of authority&#146; and &#145;wealth of learning&#146;, and adjudging him &#145;the most accomplished lawyer of his day&#146;. Davey sat alongside some very strong and very eminent judges, not the least of whom were Lindley, Macnaghten, and Herschell, but it is fair to say that his immense knowledge, carefully weighed judgments, and incisive legal mind fully entitle him to be ranked alongside those and other great names of the Victorian and Edwardian bench. Arguably the very greatest barrister of his day, Davey was certainly also one of the greatest judges.<br>
<br>Davey's cold public persona has already been highlighted&#151;it cost him dear in his efforts to establish a political career. This reputation is not ameliorated by Edmund Gosse's diary entries, the author noting, in reference to Davey, that &#145;[h]is long, melancholy nose is drawn up in a perpetual sneer&#146;, while &#145;his parchment cheeks and stealthy hyena-like tread freeze conversation whenever he makes an appearance&#146;. Davey was, nevertheless, a member of the Athenaeum, Oxford and Cambridge, and National Liberal clubs, and was apparently a fine companion to those of his intimate acquaintance, and greatly loved by his family. Harrison also refers to the &#145;inexhaustible culture&#146; of Horace Davey&#151;he had always a particularly keen interest in classical and modern European literature, and also formed a small collection of contemporary paintings.<br>
<br>Davey received many accolades in addition to those already mentioned. He was made an honorary fellow of University College, Oxford, in 1884, and was awarded an honorary doctorate of civil law ten years later (he had been standing counsel to the University of Oxford from 1877 to 1893). He was elected a fellow of the Royal Society on 24 January 1895, was chairman of the Incorporated Council for Law Reporting for England and Wales, and was elected treasurer of Lincoln's Inn in 1897. The following year he chaired the royal commission appointed to make statutes for the reconstituted University of London, and in 1905 he was elected a fellow of the British Academy.<br>
<br>Lord Davey died of acute bronchitis at his London residence, 86 Brook Street, on Wednesday 20 February 1907. He was survived by his wife, and was buried on 23 February at Forest Row, East Grinstead. His position on the appellate committee of the House of Lords was taken by Lord Collins, the former master of the rolls.<br>
