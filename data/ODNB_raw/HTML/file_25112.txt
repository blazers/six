<span class="headword">Seton,  Alexander</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1542), <span class="occ">Dominican friar and evangelical reformer</span>, was unusual among Scottish Dominicans in having noble parentage, being the son of Sir Alexander Seton of Touch and Tullibody and Elizabeth Erskine, daughter of Thomas, earl of Mar. He was not so unusual in his education, being recorded in the university rolls of St Andrews as becoming bachelor and licentiate in 1516 and 1518 respectively. He may also be identified with the &#145;Alexander de Scotia&#146;, who was given permission to study in Paris by the Dominican chapter-general in 1525. From 1530 to 1533 he was mainly in residence at St Andrews, acting as the prior of the Dominican convent there. Books survive which were in his use in the convent, some with his subscription. His next recorded appearance was in 1536, when he gave a series of Lenten sermons in St Andrews. In these he argued that it was not possible for man to satisfy for his sins and that redemption lay in faith alone. His teaching has been likened to that of John Macalpine (Maccabeus) with whom he was familiar. Once the series of sermons was over and Seton had left the town, another preacher denounced his teachings and his omissions, since he had not mentioned purgatory, pardons, pilgrimages, or prayers to saints, all of which were presumably counted by Seton as futile &#145;works&#146;. The latter speedily returned, rang the church bell, and preached a sermon in his own defence.<br>
<br>Even at this point there is no suggestion that Seton felt his beliefs were in sufficient conflict with the church for him to need to leave his order. Indeed, he signed, with his name, order, and house, a copy of the works of Origen in 1536, and so was presumably in the convent in St Andrews at that time. In his sermon in reply, however, he attacked the bishops of Scotland, especially for failing to preach, which he argued was essential to their office. This was a point to be raised in the provincial councils of the Scottish church in the years after Seton's death, but it was not an issue to which Archbishop James Beaton warmed. Calderwood's claims of Seton's popularity with the people may have a tint of exaggeration, but it does seem fairly certain that he was liked by the king and had an accustomed place as royal confessor at court. This post was more normally held by a Franciscan, however, and so it is not surprising that the archbishop stirred up the traditional rivalries between the orders, thereby making life so uncomfortable for Seton that he left Scotland. From Berwick he wrote a letter to James V which is a curious mixture of self-defence, bitter recrimination, and accusations that his enemies were blinding the king's judgement.<br>
<br>Once in England, Seton became a trouble to the Henrician church authorities. By July 1539, when he was presented to the rectory of Fulbeck, Lincolnshire, he enjoyed the patronage of Charles Brandon, duke of Suffolk, who obtained denization for him and whose chaplain he became. In November 1539 he was reported to have preached in London that &#145;faith only did justify and that works were not helping nor profitable to any man but only to declare and testify our faith&#146;  (<span class="italic">LP Henry VIII</span>, Addenda, 1/2 no. 1463 (18)). At this moment he may have been hoping for Thomas Cromwell's support, but on 20 April following Cromwell dissociated himself from Seton, who nevertheless continued to receive support from Suffolk, or perhaps from the duke's evangelically minded wife, for in September 1542 he was presented to a second rectory in Lincolnshire. A sermon he delivered in St Antholin's, London, on 13 November 1541 led to his becoming embroiled in a dispute concerning free will and justification, although the charge that he had preached without episcopal licence may have seemed to the authorities just as serious an issue. His recantation on 18 December cannot have been brought about simply by the illness which caused his death late in 1542, in Suffolk's London house, for it seems that Seton had always had a strong regard for self-preservation. Despite his refusal to stand trial in Scotland and his recantation at Paul's Cross, he was remembered and revered by the reformers as a good preacher, and an account of his travails in 1541 was included by Foxe in the <span class="italic">Acts and Monuments</span>.<br>
