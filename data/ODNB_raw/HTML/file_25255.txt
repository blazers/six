<span class="headword">Shaw,  John</span>  (1612/13&#150;1689), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, was born at Bedlington, co. Durham, the son of a clergyman, probably of John Shaw (<i>d</i>. 1637), curate of St John's, Newcastle upon Tyne, and his wife, Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1621). Shaw was educated by Thomas Ingmethorp, the rector of Great Stainton, Durham, before he matriculated at Queen's College, Oxford, on 21 November 1628, aged fifteen. He moved to Brasenose College on 2 April 1629, where he graduated BA on 24 March 1632. Returning to the north he was vicar of Alnham, Northumberland, from 1636, and appointed afternoon lecturer at All Saints, Newcastle, in December 1643. Ejected from both these posts by the Scots he was instituted rector of Whalton, Northumberland, in 1645. Unlike his parliamentarian namesake the vicar of Rotherham (with whom he has been confused), John Shaw was a royalist sympathizer, for which he was prevented from taking up his living at Whalton, and was allegedly imprisoned for four years. In the 1650s he settled in the poorer living of Bolton in Craven, in the West Riding of Yorkshire, which yielded him &pound;50 per annum. In 1652 he wrote <span class="italic">The pourtraicture of the primitive saints in their actings and sufferings, according to St Paul's canon</span>.<br>
<br>In 1661 Shaw recovered the rectory of Whalton and he replaced the ejected presbyterian, Henry Lever, as lecturer at St John's Church, Newcastle, on 27 August 1662. Appointed to preach forenoon and afternoon sermons at St John's for &pound;60 per annum he was also paid &pound;10 per annum for his Thursday lecture at St Nicholas's Church, Newcastle. He was active suppressing Newcastle's dissenters, and personally broke open the doors of the conventicle at Richard Gilpin's house on 22 July 1669. About 1661, and again in 1679, he was chosen as a member of convocation for Yorkshire, and he also served as <i>procurator cleri</i> for the archdeaconry of Northumberland. In 1677 he wrote <span class="italic">Origo protestantium, or, An answer to a popish manuscript &hellip; wherein protestancy is demonstrated to be elder than popery</span>.<br>
<br>The corporation of Newcastle published some of Shaw's writings against popery at its own expense, but his work of 1685, entitled &#145;No reformation of the established Reformation&#146;, condemned Roman Catholics and dissenters alike with equal vehemence for undermining the church. He was &#145;a strict observer of the orders of the church&#146; and &#145;somewhat warm in his temper&#146;  (<span class="italic">Ambrose Barnes</span>, 436). After suffering for several years with gout he died on 22 May 1689, &#145;a loyal, religious and learned Person&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 2.832), and was buried just before the altar in St John's Church, Newcastle. His monumental inscription, written by his son, reads &#145;Deo, ecclesiae, patriae, regi, pie fidelis&#146; (&#145;religiously loyal to God, church, country, king&#146;; <span class="italic">Ambrose Barnes</span>, 436).<br>
