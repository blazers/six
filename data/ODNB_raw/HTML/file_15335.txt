<span class="headword">Kemp <span class="st"> [Kempe]</span>,  William</span>  (1554/5&#150;1628), <span class="occ">landowner and sufferer from melancholia</span>, was the eldest son of Robert Kemp of Spain's Hall, Finchingfield, Essex, and his wife, Elizabeth Heigham. He had at least two younger brothers and two sisters. Under a contract dated 10 October 1588 he married Philippa Gunter of London and Aldbury, Hertfordshire. They had one daughter, Jane, who married John Burgoyne of Sutton, Bedfordshire. In December 1604 Kemp was among the Essex gentry who pleaded poverty as an excuse for not contributing to a loan to James I. Although in 1615 his brother Robert bequeathed him money and hawks, which suggests that he was then taking part in country sports, at some point William suffered the psychological trauma which precipitated his sole claim to fame: a retreat into silence which lasted for seven years, &#145;so swallowed up with a melancholy phrensie, that he neither went to Church nor spake to any person for several years, but always signified his mind by Writing&#146;  (Firmin, 2). Seventeenth-century sources, the earliest of them Kemp's own monument in the family chapel in Finchingfield church, offer no reason for his affliction, but family legend attributed his silence to remorse after he had drunkenly insulted his wife, and added that he occupied the years which followed by making fishponds, each one bigger than the last. Local myth-makers elaborated the story with tales of additional misfortunes, including the drowning in the fishponds of three of his servants.<br>
<br>If Kemp's lengthy abstinence from speech was indeed caused by an altercation with his wife, it none the less continued after her death, since Philippa's burial is recorded in Finchingfield church as 21 August 1623. His depression may well have been religious in origin, since it was spiritual counselling that released him from it, at least two years after Philippa died. In September 1625 the vicarage of Finchingfield, worth &pound;200 per annum, fell vacant by the death of Thomas Pickering. Kemp was the patron, and though he received several applications he showed his puritan sympathies by insisting&#151;always in writing&#151;on presenting Stephen Marshall, a leading figure among the godly of Essex, to the living. Marshall was instituted on 25 October 1625, and soon persuaded Kemp to re-enter society by engaging in conversation and by going to church. Thereafter Kemp took part in local government and ecclesiastical business, the latter in co-operation with Marshall. He administered funds for the repair of the church and relief of the poor, and at the time of his death was acting as a surveyor of the highway. His monumental inscription records his burial on 10 June 1628 at the age of seventy-three. He left no will, and since his daughter declined to act the administration of his goods was entrusted to his nephew Robert Kemp, who also inherited Spain's Hall.<br>
