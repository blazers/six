<span class="headword">Lomax,  Alan</span>  (1915&#150;2002), <span class="occ">musicologist</span>, was born on 31 January 1915 in Austin, Texas, USA, the second son and youngest of three children of John Avery Lomax (1867&#150;1948), folklorist and musicologist, and his first wife, Bess Baumann, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Brown (1881&#150;1931). His contributions to folk music scholarship were extensive and varied. He followed in the footsteps of his father, a new breed of folklorist and the first to treat cattle-trail songs as worthy of academic research; John Lomax's life was given definitive treatment in Nolan Porterfield's <span class="italic">Last Cavalier: the Life and Times of John A. Lomax</span> (1996). Both father and son were committed to an honest portrayal of North America's folkways before it was usual; the folk-singer Pete Seeger called them &#145;the greatest American folk song collectors&#146;. The father-and-son team captured the changing dynamics of folk music collecting at a time when notebook and fountain pen gave way to portable recording equipment. Alan Lomax never forgot the lessons he learned on the collecting forays for the archive of American folksong at the Library of Congress with his father from the summer of 1933 onwards.<br>
<br>Lomax attended Choate School in Wallingford, Connecticut, and spent a year at Harvard before enrolling at the University of Texas. He graduated with a degree in philosophy in 1936 and then did graduate work in anthropology at Columbia University. In 1940 he admitted, perhaps curiously, that he &#145;was never much interested in folk music until my late teens&#146;  (<span class="italic">Selected Writings</span>, 49). Nevertheless his field trips accompanying his father instilled in him an appreciation of the essential worth and value of what their informants were supplying. Both accorded their subjects dignity irrespective of colour, class, or creed. Despite living in a society riddled with racist attitudes, Lomax championed &#145;cultural equity&#146;. He worked with the black American folklorist and writer Zora Neale Hurston, for example. In 1935 he experienced a cultural manumission in the Bahamas, then a British colony: &#145;It was the greatest summer of my life because there I could live freely and speak freely with blacks in a way I could never do in the South. It was like heaven&#146;  (Droussart). In his memoirs, D. G. Bridson reported that Lomax used his fist to silence a &#145;casual racist&#146; slur against the black singer Josh White during the war years in New York  (Bridson, 103). Lomax's writings were often rich in telling anecdote and eidetic detail. Describing the response of the 75-year-old black preacher &#145;Sin Killer&#146; Griffen, whose sung sermon he had just played back, he quoted Griffen. &#145;&#147;People been tellin' me I was a good preacher for nigh onto sixty years,&#148; he said, &#147;But I never knew I was that good&#148;&#146;  (<span class="italic">Selected Writings</span>, 51). Balancing that, as Vic Gammon choicely observed, was &#145;his exuberance and hyperbole, his purple prose and sometimes strange ideas&#146;  (Gammon, 388). In the foreword to <span class="italic">The People's Song Book</span> (1948) Lomax wrote:<blockquote>Slowly I began to realize that here was an emerging tradition that represented a new kind of human being, a new folk community composed of progressives and anti-fascists and union members. These folk, heritors of the democratic tradition of folklore, were creating for themselves a folk-culture of high moral and political content. (p. 3)</blockquote>During the 1948 presidential race, like the writer&#150;broadcaster Studs Terkel, Lomax backed the loser, the Democrat Henry A. Wallace. The increasing influence of McCarthyism and McCarranism convinced him to move to England. He arrived in October 1950, having, as Shirley Collins wrote, &#145;fled the States to escape the witch-hunt&#146;  (Collins, 31). He arrived with a commission to put together volumes for the <span class="italic">Columbia World Library of Folk and Primitive Music</span> series. He did not make all the recordings himself, bartering material from the BBC archives in exchange for some of his material, and drawing on specialists such as Diego Carpitella in Italy and Hamish Henderson in Scotland; nevertheless he made many, both in the UK and elsewhere in Europe.<br>
<br>During his London-based, European domicile, aside from his collecting and editorial roles for the <span class="italic">Columbia World Library</span>, Lomax worked as a freelance broadcaster and film-maker (directing, for example, the documentary <span class="italic">Oss Oss Wee Oss</span> (1953), about the Padstow hobby horse celebrations, with Peter Kennedy). He arrived with credentials, building on his American broadcasting repute, and by 1951 had established himself as the authority on folk music with the BBC. He mainly broadcast for the Home Service and Third Programme. David Attenborough, then a junior television director, wrote that he was &#145;a large heavy man &hellip; with a relaxed easy-going manner, a wide smile and a Texan drawl&#146;  (Attenborough, 27). Lomax, however, was used to the more advanced technology and facilities in US broadcasting. This, combined with his sometimes insensitive attitudes and professional unreliability in the studio (such as overrunning or impromptu departures from the schedule) caused friction. These were days of live studio transmissions. &#145;He wasn't the easiest of contributors&#151;even then!&#146; Attenborough observed diplomatically  (private information).<br>
<br>It was later erroneously claimed that Lomax persuaded the BBC to start collecting folk music. That work was under way before his arrival in Britain. For example, building on pre-war activities, Brian George, the head of the BBC's central programme operations, had undertaken pilot field recordings in Ireland during 1947 and 1949. What Lomax did was to galvanize the corporation and a coterie of like-minded individuals such as Peter Kennedy and S&eacute;amus Ennis. He proved to be a cultural lightning-rod. Lomax and Shirley Collins, twenty years his junior, set up home in Hampstead. Still more unconventionally for the day, Lomax's first wife, Elizabeth Lyttleton Harold (whom he had married in 1937; his second marriage was to Antoinette Marchand in 1962), lived in the same household with her boyfriend. Lomax's daughter, Anna Lyttleton Lomax, also lived there.<br>
<br>Although Pan did not publish Lomax's oral history-based biography of the New Orleans jazz legend Jelly Roll Morton, <span class="italic">Mister Jelly Roll</span>, until 1958 in the UK, British jazz, blues, and folk admirers knew about Lomax and the music that he had collected and disseminated, including his part in informing the world about the blues singer Huddie &#145;Leadbelly&#146; Ledbetter. Leadbelly's songs, for instance &#145;Bourgeois Blues&#146; and &#145;Midnight Special&#146;, were often published with a co-credit for Lomax&#151;a common, &#145;sharpie&#146; practice in the sheet music and record business. In London Lomax forged alliances with a variety of people in broadcasting and the arts. Oddly, he connected the two main architects of the post-war British folk revival, Ewan MacColl and A. L. Lloyd, for the first time. As an American, he was well placed to lead the &#145;authentic&#146; skiffle group, Alan Lomax and the Ramblers. The group drew on a pool of musicians which included MacColl, Peggy Seeger, Collins, and Bryan Daly, recorded for Decca, and appeared on Granada television&#151;evidence of disloyalty that did not go unnoticed in BBC circles.<br>
<br>By his own admission, the pinnacle of Lomax's radio career occurred on Christmas day 1957. <span class="italic">Sing Christmas and the Turn of the Year</span>, produced by Charles Parker, was a live broadcast, with some gramophone interludes, that gathered together contributors such as Charlie Bate, the Marshfield Paper Boys, the McPeakes of Belfast, the Bryan Newey Skiffle Group, and Cyril Tawney. The following year <span class="italic">Punch</span> published a cartoon about him, William Hewison's &#145;I've got those Alan-Lomax-ain't-been-round-to-record-me blues&#146;. By 1956, however, the BBC had memos about &#145;potted Marxism&#146; and &#145;sexual permissiveness&#146;, and other unsubstantiated &#145;theories and generalizations&#146; on file  (private information). He returned to the United States in July 1958, though he continued to visit the UK.<br>
<br>In 1959 Lomax rekindled his relationship with Collins by inviting her to act as his assistant for what became the <span class="roman">Southern Folk Heritage Series</span>, released in the early 1960s. When the set was reissued as <span class="roman">Sounds of the South</span> (1993) he wrote: &#145;In a two-month tour, which took me from Virginia through the Middle South to the Ozarks, into the Mississippi Delta and back to the Georgia Sea Islands, I found proof that the South still held a rich heritage of musical traditions.&#146; Ungraciously his me-me-me-ism overlooked the woman who had held the microphone, charmed the bashful with her Sussex accent, and taken notes and photographs on the trip. Another significant anthology for Britain in which he had a hand was <span class="roman">Folk Songs of Britain</span> (1968&#150;71), issued by Topic in the UK.<br>
<br>In 1965, a pivotal year for folk music, Lomax showed himself to be a hero with blinkers and blind spots. At that year's Newport folk festival, in the USA, he of all people overlooked the non-segregationist gauntlet that the era's finest mixed-race electric blues band, the Paul Butterfield Blues Band, flung down. For them Lomax's recordings of Memphis Slim, Big Bill Broonzy, Muddy Waters, and Sonny Boy Williamson had been inspirational, but he questioned whether white musicians could sing the blues, prompting a fight with Bob Dylan's manager, Albert Grossman, and a later riposte from Dylan, &#145;Nobody can sing the blues like Blind Willie McTell&#146;. As an individual, Lomax could be overbearing. He had a habit of dismissing other people's opinions, if contrary to his own. On the other hand, and more importantly, he proved himself exceptionally sensitive and resourceful when it came to documenting the world's music&#151;even if, at times, he downplayed or skipped the stalwart contributions of Mary Elizabeth Barnicle, Shirley Collins, and Zora Neale Hurston. Moreover, he catalysed developments in popular music. Without &#145;Rock Island Line&#146;, Lonnie Donegan's career would have been different. Without Lomax's recordings of Muddy Waters and Fred McDowell, the Rolling Stones would have lacked bite.<br>
<br>While his father's focus had been on American demotic music, Lomax made significant contributions to the understanding and preservation of folk music beyond the USA. Rounder Records began a multi-volume archival release programme in 1997 that rejuvenated his reputation. He was fallible, especially in his theorizing, and notably in his reductivist projects, Cantometrics, Choreometrics, and the Global Jukebox, hapless attempts to stitch together world folk music, and dance. Nevertheless his impact on popular culture was massive, and not only through his recordings. His written contributions also changed the course of music, with his and his father's <span class="italic">American Ballads and Folk Songs</span> (1934) and his own <span class="italic">The Folk Songs of North America</span> (1959), <span class="italic">The Penguin Book of American Folk Songs</span> (1964), and <span class="italic">The Land where the Blues Began</span> (1993). The world of music would have been a dramatically poorer place without his interventions. He died on 19 July 2002 in Mease Countryside Hospital, Safety Harbor, Pinellas county, Florida. He was survived by his daughter.<br>
