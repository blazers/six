<span class="headword">Bancroft,  Edward</span>  (1744&#150;1821), <span class="occ">chemist and spy</span>, was born at Westfield, Massachusetts, on 9 January 1744. His tutor was Silas Deane, later a member of the American congress. After a brief apprenticeship to a physician in Connecticut, Bancroft went to sea at the age of eighteen. In 1763 he was in Dutch Guiana, where he extended his education and practised medicine.<br>
<br>Bancroft moved to England in 1767 and studied at St Bartholomew's Hospital in London. He began his literary career with <span class="italic">An essay on the natural history of Guiana &hellip; with an account of the religion, manners, and customs of several tribes of its Indian inhabitants</span> (1769), and in the same year he published <span class="italic">Remarks on the Review of the Controversy between Great Britain and her Colonies</span>, a critical response to William Knox (1732&#150;1810) and George Grenville, in which Bancroft defended the rights of British colonies. In 1770 he published the novel <span class="italic">Charles Wentworth</span>, through which he expressed his ideas as a freethinker. He befriended Benjamin Franklin and Joseph Priestley, and through them began working for the journal <span class="italic">Monthly Review</span>.<br>
<br>Bancroft was elected a fellow of the Royal Society on 20 May 1773, and at that time was described as MB. Subsequently he was awarded his MD by Aberdeen University.<br>
<br>At the outbreak of war with the American colonies, Bancroft acted as a spy for Franklin. He was accused of conspiring with others in an attempt to burn Portsmouth Dockyard. (James Aitken was later arrested and executed for his part in the conspiracy.) Bancroft avoided arrest by escaping to France, where, in 1776, he turned king's evidence, and provided the British government with information acquired from Silas Deane, then an American commissioner based in Europe. From December 1776 Bancroft received regular payments from the British for his spying activities, and the American government continued to pay him for similar services until 1783. Bancroft sometimes used the alias Edwards during the colonial wars.<br>
<br>About two years after arriving in England, Bancroft began to study dyeing and calico printing. He made a number of trips to the Americas to study native woods for use as dyestuffs, and around 1771 discovered a yellow colourant present in the inner bark of the American black oak (<i>Quercus velutina</i>). In 1775 the British parliament passed an act providing Bancroft with patent rights for its importation and use. In 1785 Bancroft gained extended patent rights for the dye, which in the relevant act was called quercitron, a name that has been in use ever since. Bancroft's monopoly over control of the dye in England expired in 1799, when an application to extend his rights by a further seven years failed to pass the House of Lords due to opposition from northern calico printers. Ironically, the price of the bark trebled within a year.<br>
<br>In 1794 Bancroft published in London his <span class="italic">Experimental Researches Concerning the Philosophy of Permanent Colours</span>. It was a blend of practice and theory in which he demonstrated his ability to apply chemical knowledge to dyeing and printing. In the introduction he defined terms that entered the industry's vocabulary, namely, substantive dyes (those that do not require mordants) and adjective dyes (those that do). He also adopted the new nomenclature of chemistry introduced by French chemists a few years earlier. His writings on chemistry and dyeing were influential. His theories of colours and of attachment of dyes to fabrics appealed to leading chemists, including Claude-Louis Berthollet and Jean-Henri Hassenfratz, and contributed towards the downfall of Newton's mechanical theory of light. The theoretical discussion and polemics, however, were not appreciated by most practising dyers and printers during the first half of the nineteenth century.<br>
<br>After 1800 Bancroft made further journeys to North and South America, but without great success, in part due to his ill health. His loss of income from the quercitron monopoly probably prevented publication of a revised edition of his book, and of a second volume (as promised in the 1794 edition), until 1813. A United States edition was published in 1814. The German translation of 1817&#150;18 was reprinted as late as 1834. Bancroft lived in reduced circumstances, probably even before the second edition of his book was published. However, he continued with the study of chemistry and dyeing.<br>
<br>Bancroft was married to Penelope Fellows; <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1268/', "Edward Nathaniel Bancroft")</script> was their son. He died at his home in Margate on 8 September 1821. His quercitron was used as a colourant in the dyeing industry until the early 1900s.<br>
