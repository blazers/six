<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Hotham, Sir  Richard</span>  (1722&#150;1799), <span class="occ">merchant and founder of the resort of Bognor</span>, was born in York on 5 October 1722, the youngest of five children (of whom only he and his sister survived infancy) of Joseph Hotham, gentleman, and his wife, Sarah Bradley. In 1791 Sir Richard erected a memorial to his parents at Skelton church, near York.<br>
<br>Nothing is known of Hotham's early years, but at some time he established himself as a hatter and hosier in Serle Street, Lincoln's Inn, London, and later, about 1750, in the Strand, advertising his wares by circulating copper tokens in London and the provinces. About 1760 his interests extended to chartered shipping with the East India Company and he was the author of two pamphlets, <span class="italic">Reflections upon East India Shipping</span> (1773) and <span class="italic">A Candid State of Affairs Relative to the East India Shipping</span> (1774), which sharply criticized the company's bad management.<br>
<br>In 1764 Hotham purchased Moat House Farm, Merton, which he rebuilt as Merton Place, later the home of Lord Nelson. He sold this in 1792 but retained one field of the enlarged estate, on which he built his own house, Merton Grove, at Wimbledon. He was knighted on 12 April 1769, allegedly for expressing the loyalty of Surrey to King George III during the agitation by John Wilkes, and appointed sheriff of Surrey, 1770&#150;71. He conducted a prolonged dispute with Wimbledon vestry committee over developing a public highway to Wandsworth.<br>
<br>In 1780 Hotham was elected MP for Southwark, defeating Henry Thrale and thereby provoking the contempt of Dr Samuel Johnson. He was a member of the Whig opposition and of the St Alban's tavern group, which attempted a union of parties. After narrowly losing the 1784 by-election, Hotham visited Sussex, where he embarked upon the ambitious scheme of transforming the fishing hamlet of Bognor into the select watering place of &#145;Hothamton&#146;. Some 1600 acres of land were purchased and the building of several mansions and terraces commenced in January 1787. The licensing of his own private chapel was the subject of an acrimonious dispute with the vicar of South Bersted. Having created his sea-bathing resort, this enterprising and sometimes contentious individual achieved the recognition he sought: the patronage of the upper classes. Substantial debts led to the dispersal of his estates after his death, but Bognor's reputation for health and respectability continued to attract royalty and nobility.<br>
<br>Hotham married on 3 December 1743, by licence at Chelsea Hospital Chapel, Frances Atkinson, of Stockton-on-Tees, with whom he had a son John, who died in 1751. She was buried on 14 August 1760 in St Martin-in-the-Fields, Westminster, where on 7 April 1761 he married Barbara (<i>b</i>. 1733), daughter of Joseph Huddart, tradesman, and his wife Patience, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Rash. She died without issue at Brompton on 1 February 1777 and was buried a week later. Hotham had adopted, unofficially, arms similar to those of the Hotham baronetcy, to which he was not connected. George Romney painted his portrait in 1793. Romney at first declined the commission, but &#145;he was pleased with the cheerful adventurous disposition of that commercial Knight, whom he afterwards painted at full length in London&#146;  (Hayley, 175). Hotham died in Bognor on 13 March 1799 and was buried in the local parish churchyard of South Bersted.<br>
