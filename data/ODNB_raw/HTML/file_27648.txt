<span class="headword">Tozer,  Aaron</span>  (1788&#150;1854), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, entered the navy in June 1801 on the <i>Phoebe</i>, with Captain Thomas Baker, on the Irish station. He afterwards served in the East Indies and on the home station, and, again with Baker, in the <i>Phoenix</i>, in which on 10 August 1805 he was present at the capture of the French frigate <i>Didon</i>, which was carrying important dispatches from Villeneuve at Ferrol to Rochefort. Tozer was dangerously wounded in the shoulder, and, after passing his examination, was specially promoted lieutenant on 11 August 1807. After serving in the <i>York</i> (74 guns) at the capture of Madeira and in the West Indies, he was appointed, in December 1808, to the <i>Victorious</i>, in which he took part in the Walcheren expedition in July and August 1809. The <i>Victorious</i> was in the Mediterranean, in the defence of Sicily, from June to September 1810, during which time Tozer was repeatedly engaged in actions between the boats and the vessels of Murat's flotilla, and on 22 February 1812 was at the capture of the <i>Rivoli</i>. In February 1813 Tozer was appointed to the <i>Undaunted</i>, and during the following months repeatedly commanded her boats in storming the enemy's batteries or cutting out trading and armed vessels from under their protection. On 18 August 1813, in an attack, in force, on the batteries of Cassis, when the citadel battery was carried by escalade and three gunboats and twenty-four merchant vessels were brought out, Tozer was severely wounded by a canister shot in the groin and by a musket shot in the left hand, in consequence of which he was invalided out. On 15 July 1814 he was promoted commander, and in December 1815 was awarded a pension of &pound;150 a year. From 1818 to 1822 he commanded the <i>Cyrene</i> (20 guns) in the West Indies and in 1829 the yacht <i>William and Mary</i>. He married, on 5 June 1827, Mary, the eldest daughter of Henry Hutton of Lincoln; they had one son, the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/38073/', "Revd Henry Fanshawe Tozer")</script>, fellow of Exeter College, Oxford. On 14 January 1830 Tozer was promoted to post rank, but had no further employment, and died at Plymouth, where he was living, on 21 February 1854.<br>
<br>Tozer had an amphibious career, distinguished by bravery and exceptional in intensity, but not untypical of a period of unquestioned British supremacy at sea.<br>
