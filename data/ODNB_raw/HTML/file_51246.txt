<span class="headword">Guinness,  Bryan Walter</span>, second Baron Moyne  (1905&#150;1992), <span class="occ">poet and novelist</span>, was born on 27 October 1905 at 11 Grosvenor Place, London, the eldest of three children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/33605/', "Walter Edward Guinness (1880&#150;1944)")</script>, MP, later first Baron Moyne of Bury St Edmunds, and his wife, Lady Evelyn Hilda Stuart, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Erskine (1883&#150;1939), daughter of the fourteenth earl of Buchan.<br>
<br>A sensitive boy, Guinness loathed his preparatory school. Perhaps the most effective scene in his novels is the passage in <span class="italic">Landscape with Figures</span> (1934) which describes the torments of his dormitory. At Eton, one morning at chapel, he suddenly found he was unable to get off his knees; this was the start of an attack of polio which set him back academically and made participation in games impossible. The late diagnosis of the disease&#151;the fault of his Eton dame who thought he was malingering&#151;meant that he never grew to his full height. His father, who was tiny, good-looking, and perfectly proportioned, was known as &#145;the pocket Adonis&#146;. Bryan Guinness inherited his father's piercing blue eyes and handsome features but not his proportions: his feet and hands were too big and he should have been a few inches taller. He was nevertheless a graceful dancer, and when he waltzed with his mother the whole ballroom would stop to watch. Oxford he enjoyed; he belonged to the &#145;Brideshead generation&#146; with Evelyn Waugh, Brian Howard, and Harold Acton. However, he worried his mother because he underspent his allowance, a worry uncommon for most parents of an undergraduate. It was an early sign of his shrinking dread of ostentation.<br>
<br>After leaving Christ Church with a degree in French and German, Guinness read for the bar. He also went to dances, at one of which, in 1928, he met the eighteen-year-old Diana Freeman-Mitford [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/92691/', "Mosley, Diana (1910&#150;2003)")</script>], daughter of David Bertram Ogilvy Freeman-Mitford, second Baron Redesdale (1878&#150;1958). They married on 30 January 1929 and had two sons. Diana, freed from the countrified parents that her sister Nancy was to immortalize in her novels, longed for society. Guinness, it became clear, wanted to settle down to enjoy just such a quiet rural life as she had escaped. His poem &#145;The Cocktail Party&#146; starts:<blockquote>
<div>Here friendship founders in a sea of &#145;friends&#146;,<br>
</div>
<div>And harsh-lipp'd <i>bubbly</i> cannot make amends.<br>
</div>
</blockquote>In 1931, discouraged by a colleague who told him that he was unlikely to be given briefs because of his wealth, he left the bar and bought Biddesden House in Wiltshire. In 1932 Diana fell in love with Sir Oswald Mosley, soon to become leader of the British Union of Fascists. She divorced Guinness in 1934. On 21 September 1936, Guinness married Elisabeth Nelson (1912&#150;1999) from Argyll. Her tastes, unlike Diana's, corresponded with his and together they built up the farm and Arabian horse stud at Biddesden. Their happy marriage produced four sons and five daughters.<br>
<br>Guinness had already published his first novel, <span class="italic">Singing out of Tune</span> (1933), and followed it with <span class="italic">A Week by the Sea</span> (1936). <span class="italic">Lady Crushwell's Companion</span> (1938) reflected his increasing interest in farming. The style was graceful and the reviewers were polite, but the novels did not really catch on. Where he did receive some recognition was as a poet, particularly for his collection <span class="italic">Under the Eyelid</span> (1935). He produced a further six volumes of poetry.<br>
<br>The first of several children's books, <span class="italic">The Story of Johnny and Jemima</span>, appeared in 1936. Some regard this as Guinness's best work, in which good triumphs over evil with just enough violence to please a child. Illustrated by Roland Pym, it was the start of a fruitful collaboration. Guinness's play, <span class="italic">The Fragrant Concubine</span>, was performed in the West End in 1938. During the war Guinness was part of the Spears mission and served as liaison officer with the French in Syria. He was in the region when his father, as minister resident in the Middle East, was assassinated by Jewish terrorists. He inherited Knockmaroon, a house overlooking the Liffey near Dublin, and from then on divided his time between Ireland and England, with many journeys abroad. He became vice-chairman of Arthur Guinness, Son &amp; Co. in 1949.<br>
<br>After the war Guinness also produced six more children's books, including <span class="italic">The Children in the Desert</span> (1946), five novels, and five plays. <span class="italic">A Riverside Charade</span> was performed at the Abbey Theatre, Dublin, in 1954. His novella, <span class="italic">A Fugue of Cinderellas</span> (1956), records the gently competing sensibilities of a group of well-meaning people. His <span class="italic">Collected Poems, 1927&#150;1955</span> was published in 1956. There were also two collections of short stories and three volumes of autobiography, <span class="italic">Dairy not Kept</span> (1975), <span class="italic">Potpourri from the Thirties</span> (1982), and <span class="italic">Personal Patchwork</span> (1986).<br>
<br>One of Guinness's salient characteristics was a real reverence for the arts. He was a governor of the National Gallery of Ireland from 1955 and a member of the Irish Academy of Letters. As Lord Moyne, he was quite assiduous in the House of Lords, although making speeches did not come easily to him. He would be better known as a writer, perhaps, had he managed to suppress his natural kindliness and delicacy and admitted more of the ruthlessness of life into his writing.<br>
<br>Bryan Guinness died at Biddesden House on 6 July 1992; his ashes were buried in Ludgershall churchyard, Wiltshire, on 30 July. <span class="italic">On a Ledge</span>, his final collection of poems, was published posthumously in 1992.<br>
