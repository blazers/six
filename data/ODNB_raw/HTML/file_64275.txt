<span class="headword">Joy,  Henry</span>  (1719/20&#150;1789), <span class="occ">newspaper proprietor and benefactor</span>, was born in Belfast, the first of three children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15146/', "Francis Joy (1697&#150;1790)")</script>, printer and paper maker, and his wife, Margaret (1690&#150;1745), daughter of Robert Martin of Belfast. The family was descended from Calvinist stock who moved to Ireland in the early seventeenth century. Nothing of Henry's early life is known except that he trained as a lawyer. The family's fortunes changed when in 1737 Francis Joy founded the <span class="italic">Belfast News-Letter</span> (Ireland's second oldest provincial newspaper) after apparently receiving the printing press in lieu of a bad debt. Faced with a shortage of paper, Francis Joy developed the family business to include papermaking, first in Ballymena and then in 1745 at Randalstown, where he installed a larger mill.<br>
<br>Henry Joy and his brother, <a name="cosubject_75165"></a><span class="headword">Robert Joy</span>  (1722&#150;1785)<span class="occ"></span>, took charge of the <span class="italic">Belfast News-Letter</span> from their father in the same year, and gained full control several years later. In 1767 the brothers acquired a site at Cromac for a new paper mill (Joy's paper mill, now commemorated by Joy Street, Belfast). In the following decade the newspaper became a mouthpiece for Henry Joy's support of the pro-Fox whig cause, and carried articles defending the American revolutionaries. In addition to the <span class="italic">Newsletter</span> the firm of Henry and Robert Joy also printed and published books, with Henry acting as the company's notary. Paper printed by the firm bore a watermark with their name, the initials in the form of a ligature.<br>
<br>Over the following decade the Joys emerged as one of Belfast's most notable entrepreneurial families. In 1777 Robert Joy conceived a scheme to introduce cotton manufacture into Ireland, and, together with Thomas McCabe, he installed the machinery necessary to teach poorhouse children to spin and weave cotton. Two years later the first cotton spinning mill was built in Whitehouse by Nicholas Grimshaw, followed by that of Messrs Joy, McCabe, and McCracken (the Joys' brother-in-law and father of the radical politician <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17404/', "Henry Joy McCracken")</script>). This mill, opened in Belfast, was the first in Ireland powered by water.<br>
<br>Alongside entrepreneurship the Joys combined public duty and charity. In 1745 Henry Joy was one of the volunteers who garrisoned Carrickfergus Castle when it was rumoured that the Young Pretender (Charles Edward Stuart) was attempting an invasion of the Antrim coast from Scotland. Henry was also a leading member of the Belfast Charitable Society (founded in 1752), acting as one of three &#145;key carriers&#146; of the society's chest, kept at his house in High Street, Belfast; his press also printed the lottery tickets by which the society raised funds. In addition the Joys were involved in building the north Belfast poorhouse, for which Henry signed the lease and Robert drew the architectural plans in 1771; both brothers provided money and materials for the building. Between 1759 and 1772 Henry Joy served as Belfast's deputy town clerk. In 1778 he and Robert were among the first members of the 1st Belfast volunteer company, a local defence force established after the declaration of war with France; both brothers remained members after the volunteers became a political force campaigning for the legislative independence of Ireland. In 1781 Henry was elected a burgess of the town and two years later a founding member of the Belfast chamber of commerce. Heavily involved in providing facilities for marketing white linens in Belfast, he contributed in the same year (1783) to the building of the town's White Linen Hall.<br>
<br>Henry Joy was married to Barbara Dunbar (<i>d</i>. 1777?), daughter of George Dunbar of Belfast; they had ten children, six daughters and four sons, including Henry Joy (1766&#150;1838), who, after a period as attorney-general for Ireland, became chief baron of the Irish exchequer in 1831  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 2nd ser., 10, 1838, 210). Joy died, aged sixty-nine, on 20 January 1789, in Belfast, where he was buried. Just before his death the citizens of Belfast honoured him with a cup, expressing to him their &#145;gratitude for the innumerable services rendered by him in a long series of years to his fellow citizens&#146;. His obituary in the January edition of <span class="italic">Walker's Hibernian Magazine</span> likewise emphasized his philanthropy, describing him as a man of &#145;correct, amiable, and engaging&#146; manners, &#145;an invaluable friend of all &hellip; [who] died without the enmity of any&#146;. On his death the proprietorship of the <span class="italic">Belfast News-Letter</span> passed to Henry, the son of Robert Joy, who had died in 1785.<br>
