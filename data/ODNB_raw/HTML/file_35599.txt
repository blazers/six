<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Poynder,  John Poynder  Dickson-</span>, Baron Islington  (1866&#150;1936), <span class="occ">politician and colonial administrator</span>, was born at Ryde, Isle of Wight, on 31 October 1866, the only son of the four children of Rear-Admiral John Bourmaster Dickson (1815&#150;1876), and his first wife, Sarah Matilda (who died in childbirth with John), third daughter of Thomas Poynder of Hilmarton Manor, Calne, Wiltshire. On his father's side John Dickson came of a family which had distinguished itself in the fighting services, the most notable member being his great-uncle Major-General Sir Alexander Dickson. He succeeded to his uncle's baronetcy in 1884. His mother's family had made its mark in commerce and had attained considerable wealth in the East India trade. From his uncle, Thomas Poynder, of Hilmarton, Wiltshire, whom he succeeded in 1887, he inherited a large fortune, and in 1888 he assumed by royal licence the additional surname Poynder. He was educated at Harrow School and then entered Christ Church, Oxford, in 1885, but did not take a degree. He settled down at Hartham Park, near Chippenham, Wiltshire, where the Poynder lands were extensive. It was said to be characteristic of him that when he came of age he remitted a year's rent to all his tenant farmers. On 30 September 1892 he was elected as the Conservative member for the Chippenham division. He retained this seat until his resignation in 1910. On 30 September 1896 he married Ann Beauclerk (<i>d</i>. 1958), third daughter of Robert Henry Duncan Dundas, of Glenesk, Midlothian, and granddaughter of Robert Cornelis Napier, first Baron Napier of Magdala. They had one daughter, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/76425/', "Joan Alice Katherine Grigg")</script>, organizer of maternity services in Africa.<br>
<br>After leaving Oxford, Dickson-Poynder had been commissioned in the 3rd Royal Scots regiment and afterwards joined the Wiltshire yeomanry, serving from 1900 to 1901 as aide-de-camp to P. S. Methuen, third Lord Methuen, in the South African War. For his services during the campaign, which involved a good deal of dispatch riding in enemy country, he was appointed DSO. He was elected for the third time at Chippenham while at the front in 1900.<br>
<br>Having chosen politics, rather than the military or business, as a career, Dickson-Poynder had selected to enter parliament as a Conservative in an area where his family influence was strong. But he &#145;had rather a cross-bench mind which prevented him from fitting comfortably into either the Conservative or the Liberal Party&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 8 Dec 1936, 11). In 1905 he crossed the floor of the house on the tariff reform issue and joined the Liberal Party. But he showed his independence again by opposing the land taxation clauses of the Liberal 1907 budget. He was a moderate (Conservative) member of the London county council from 1898 to 1904, representing St George's, Hanover Square. There he showed a deep concern for social issues. He was chairman of the housing committee and was also a member of the committee on the feeding of schoolchildren. The report of that committee formed the basis for parliamentary legislation in 1906. He was also a member in 1903&#150;4 of the royal commission on London traffic.<br>
<br>Having not achieved government office in the House of Commons, Dickson-Poynder in 1910 accepted the offer of appointment as governor-general of New Zealand, and, on 27 April 1910, was created Baron Islington of Islington. In 1911 he was sworn of the privy council and appointed KCMG. But in 1912 he resigned his governorship in order to become chairman of the royal commission on the public services in India. He was appointed GCMG in 1913 and in 1914&#150;15 was under-secretary of state for the colonies. From 1915 to 1918 he was under-secretary of state for India.<br>
<br>In 1915 Islington was promoting himself as a possible new viceroy for India, with the support of the secretary of state, Austen Chamberlain. But the prime minister, Asquith, wrote to Venetia Stanley: &#145;What folly! They wd never do&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters to Venetia Stanley</span>, 406). This perhaps reflected agitation over what was described as Islington's tendency to be &#145;changeable in some things&#151;he could be a vigorous champion to-day and a vehement opponent tomorrow&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 12 Dec 1936, 19) as well as concerns about his wife. Asquith was not the only one to have this opinion. Hearing the news that the Islingtons were being considered, the Australian governor-general, Munro-Ferguson, commented that: &#145;It is hard to imagine anything worse&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters to Venetia Stanley</span>, 407).<br>
<br>In 1920 Islington became chairman of the National Savings Committee, touring the country on its behalf until his resignation in 1926, when he was appointed GBE. He had acquired a position of some authority in the House of Lords. He obtained the house's approval in June 1922, against the opposition of the ex-prime minister, Lord Balfour, for a motion against acceptance of the British mandate for Palestine &#145;until such modifications had been effected as would comply with British pledges to the Arabs&#146;. As <span class="italic">The Times</span> noted, Islington was notable for his &#145;devotion to the cause of Palestine Arabs&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 12 Dec 1936, 19).<br>
<br>Islington also served for twenty-one years (1891&#150;1912) as chairman of the board of management of the Royal Northern Hospital in Islington. He died at his home, 18 Hyde Park Gardens, London, on 6 December 1936, and was buried at Hilmarton church, Calne, Wiltshire, on 10 December.<br>
