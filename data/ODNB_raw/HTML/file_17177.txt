<span class="headword">Lumley,  Henry</span>  (<em>c.</em>1658&#150;1722), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was the second son of John Lumley, whose burial is recorded for 10 October 1658. Henry Lumley, however, was described as in his sixty-third year at the time of his death, on 18 October 1722. His mother was Mary, daughter of Sir Henry Compton, and his elder brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17182/', "Richard Lumley, first earl of Scarbrough")</script>. He was probably raised a Roman Catholic, and may have converted to protestantism in 1687. On 13 June 1685 he had attained the rank of captain in the Queen's regiment of horse (later 1st dragoon guards), and served with it throughout the wars of William III and Anne, gaining a high reputation for courage. When Sir John Lanier, the colonel of the Queen's Horse, was killed at Steenkerke in 1692, Lumley was made colonel (10 August) in his stead, and in February 1693 he was promoted brigadier-general. He was at Neerwinden and Landen in 1693, covering the retreat on 19 July, and saving William III from capture by the enemy. In 1695 he was at the siege of Namur. On 1 January 1696 he became major-general. After the treaty of Ryswick (1697) he returned to England, and his regiment, though reduced, was one of those which were not disbanded in February 1699. Lumley married, first, Elizabeth Thimbleby of Lincolnshire, and, second, Anne, daughter of Sir William Wiseman of Great Canfield Hall, Essex. A daughter, Frances, by his second marriage, died in 1719.<br>
<br>Lumley was elected MP for Sussex in 1701 and 1702, and for Arundel in 1715 in his brother's interest. On 27 February 1702 he embarked at Woolwich for the campaign in Flanders, and was promoted lieutenant-general on 11 February 1703. He became governor of Jersey in 1703, and in 1710 he was given the office for life, on the recommendation of Marlborough; he never visited the island, although he was very attentive to the interests of the inhabitants in London. In July 1704 he took part in the bloody assault on the Schellenberg and with the horse prevented some of the young recruits from running away. At Blenheim he was on the left wing, and he afterwards fought at Ramillies, Oudenarde, and Malplaquet. On 30 January 1711 he was promoted full general. In 1717 he resigned the command of his regiment, and died on 18 October 1722. He was buried in the church at Sawbridgeworth in Hertfordshire, where there is an inscription to his memory.<br>
