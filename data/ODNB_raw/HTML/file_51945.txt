<span class="headword">Morton,  Savile</span>  (1811&#150;1852), <span class="occ">journalist and philanderer</span>, was born on 1 August 1811, the fourth of the five sons who survived infancy of Charles Carr Morton, landed gentleman, of Kilnacrott House, Drumrora, co. Cavan, and his wife, Charlotte (<i>d</i>. 1854), second daughter of John Tatlow, of Crover, co. Cavan. He also had three sisters. Morton entered Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1830, as a scholar, and graduated BA and twenty-second wrangler in 1834. An &#145;Apostle&#146;, and close friend of Edward FitzGerald (who called him &#145;my wild Irishman&#146;), Thackeray, Tennyson, Frederick Tennyson, and Richard Monckton Milnes, he was interested in the classics, literature, architecture, and medicine.<br>
<br>Brilliant but spendthrift, unstable and restless, in the 1830s Morton travelled in Europe, particularly in Italy, with Frederick Tennyson. He was apparently of independent means, but the death of his father revealed that the family estates were deeply in debt. In 1838 he entered the Inner Temple, but was not called to the bar. More and more dependent on concerned but increasingly despairing friends, from 1841 to 1844 he lived in Rome as an artist. Letters to his friends revealed fine descriptive skills and penetrating insights, an ability which enabled him in 1846 to become the foreign correspondent in Constantinople for the <span class="italic">Daily News</span>, through Thackeray's good offices. He later served in the same capacity in Athens, Madrid, Vienna, Berlin, and Paris, also becoming Paris correspondent of the <span class="italic">Morning Advertiser</span> in 1852. During his time working as a journalist, Morton travelled in Turkey, Persia, and, with Henry Rawlinson, in Babylonia. His Berlin friends included Varnhagen von Ense, the historian, and Bettina von Arnim, the biographer and reformer. He supported liberal political causes there and in Paris, where he opposed Louis Napoleon's attempts to censor English journalists' reports after the coup of 2 December 1851.<br>
<br>Morton's fair hair, blond beard, genial countenance, and friendly bearing made him attractive to women, and the attraction was mutual. Fickle, heartless, and not quite in touch with reality, he took full advantage of this. From Rome in 1843, his artist friend Augustus Brotherton reported (without malice) that Morton had stolen &#145;his whore&#146;  (F. Tennyson MSS, Lilly Library, University of Indiana, Bloomington), and Edward FitzGerald's letters expressed concern for the misfortunes of the otherwise unidentified &#145;Poor Elizabeth&#146; whom Morton had seduced and with whom he may have fathered a child, since both Thackeray and FitzGerald later gave her financial assistance (<span class="italic">Letters of Edward FitzGerald</span>, 1.514, 528, 555; <span class="italic">Letters and Private Papers of &hellip; Thackeray</span>, 2.227; supplement, 1.174). This affair may have been a factor in Thackeray's finding Morton his foreign posting. After Morton fought a duel in Paris in December 1850 Thackeray commented:<blockquote>Morton has a genius for scrapes such as no man out of Ireland can ever hope for: and the wonder is that he has lasted up to 40 years of age with a whole skin&#151;Why he is always in some feminine mischief. (<span class="italic">Letters and Private Papers</span>, 2.726)</blockquote>He later wrote:<blockquote>he is <i>shocking</i> about women. Directly I hear of his being fond of one I feel sorry for her. He lusts after her and leaves her &hellip; Women think of <i>reclaiming</i> a libertine &amp; then, &amp; then all the fat is in the fire. (ibid., 3.24)</blockquote>By 1851 Morton was involved with the actress Lola Montez (1818&#150;1861), who incited him to fight another duel. Most seriously, in December 1851, he met Harold Elyot Bower (1815&#150;1884), a journalist and Cambridge acquaintance, who was apparently conducting an extra-marital affair. Morton became friendly with Mrs Bower, maintaining that he was helping her to obtain a divorce. In September 1852 she gave birth to her fifth child, claiming Morton as the father. Morton denied it, but Bower became jealous, and fatally stabbed Morton in the neck when he was visiting the Bower household at 2 rue de S&egrave;ze on 1 October 1852. Morton died almost immediately.<br>
<br>Thackeray wrote to Milnes that Morton had &#145;rushed upon his fate. Haven't I often said to you he would come to a violent death?&#146;, and he supplemented this, in a letter to Dr John Brown, with:<blockquote>He did not care for the woman&#151;at least she was one of a dozen the poor headlong fellow pursued &hellip; all the family were crazy, and my poor Savile the maddest wildest and gentlest of creatures&#151;scarce answerable for his actions or his passions. (<span class="italic">Letters and Private Papers of &hellip; Thackeray</span>, supplement, 1.485, 486&#150;7)</blockquote>Fitzgerald asked &#145;Didn't he die in character?&#146; and writing to Thackeray reported Frederick Tennyson's comment, &#145;Morton, he thinks, could only grow a more gigantic Rebel against Good Morals if he grew immortal, and he wishes him Eternal Rest!&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters of Edward FitzGerald</span>, 2. 71, 75). Morton was buried in Montmartre cemetery, and Bower was acquitted of his murder in December 1852. In 1844 FitzGerald had put together extracts from Morton's letters, hoping publication might provide Morton with some income, but they were rejected by both <span class="italic">Fraser's</span> and <span class="italic">Blackwood's</span>. In 1866 he made a fresh selection, &#145;Fragments of some letters from an ill-starred man of genius&#146;, before destroying the originals, but these remain unpublished. Thackeray used the young Morton as his model for Philip Firmin in <span class="italic">The Adventures of Philip</span> (1861&#150;2) and freely drew on his later life in the Saverne episode in <span class="italic">Denis Duval</span> (1864).<br>
