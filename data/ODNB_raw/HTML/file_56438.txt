<span class="headword">Hall,  Ronald Owen</span>  (1895&#150;1975), <span class="occ">bishop of Hong Kong</span>, was born on 22 July 1895 at 7 St Thomas Square, Newcastle upon Tyne, the second of nine children of Cecil Gallopine Hall (1868&#150;1938), curate of St Andrew's, Newcastle, and his wife, Constance Gertrude (1868&#150;1936), daughter of the Revd Henry Berners Upcher and his wife, Lucy. Three of his brothers became priests or missionaries; another, Sir Noel Hall, was principal of Brasenose College, Oxford, and his sister Faith was headmistress of St Hilda's School, Ootacamund, India.<br>
<br>Hall was educated at the Royal Grammar School, Newcastle upon Tyne, and at Bromsgrove School before serving in the First World War in the Northumberland Fusiliers, becoming the youngest brigade major in the army with an MC and bar. He then took a shortened degree course as a scholar of Brasenose College, Oxford, and studied at Cuddesdon College before being ordained deacon in 1920 and priest in 1922. On 24 April 1923 he married a distant relative, Nora Kathleen Suckling-Baron (1897&#150;1982); they had two sons and one daughter. After serving as missionary secretary of the Student Christian Movement from 1921 to 1925, he spent a year with the Young Men's Christian Association in China, working under T. Z. Koo, who became one of his heroes. From 1926 to 1932 he was vicar of St Luke's, Newcastle, where he felt a burning sympathy with the unemployed and their families in the depression of 1931, in which he initiated housing and food distribution schemes.<br>
<br>In 1932 Hall was appointed bishop of Hong Kong and until 1951 of southern China also. He early made clear his attitude that foreigners exercised too much authority and that in differences of opinion between European and Chinese he would back the Chinese. In a remarkable book, <span class="italic">The Art of the Missionary</span> (1942), he advised anyone who aspired to be a missionary in China to sell his books on religion and make friends with Chinese artists to learn the secrets of the saints  (pp. 9&#150;12). His criticisms of the administration from the cathedral pulpit caused the governor to describe him as the Pink Bishop.<br>
<br>When the Japanese took Hong Kong in December 1941, Hall happened to be attending a conference in the USA. On his return he lived in parts of his diocese still under Chinese control. It was then that the incident occurred which made him notorious. In 1944, after informing William Temple, archbishop of Canterbury, he ordained as priest a deaconess, Florence Li Tim Oi, in order that the congregation of Macau, which was cut off from the mainland, should be able to continue to receive the sacrament. Temple seems not to have been wholly unsympathetic  (Paton, 130&#150;35), but on his sudden death his successor, Fisher, accused Hall of obstinately refusing the advice of his friends to suspend the woman, and successfully called on the Chinese house of bishops, who were heavily dependent on outside aid after the war, to repudiate his action. Hall's own diocesan synod supported him and appealed to the Lambeth conference of 1948 to allow the experiment. The conference refused: Florence Li Tim Oi gave up her priestly function but not her indelible holy orders. The precedent was to be of great importance in the long battle within the Anglican church on the ordination of women. Ironically, Hall was not primarily interested in feminism; coming from a Tractarian background his motivation had been the supreme importance of enabling his flock to receive the sacrament from a priest, not a layman.<br>
<br>After the war Hall, who was always a disciple of F. D. Maurice, worked ceaselessly for social justice in his diocese, particularly through voluntary agencies. In partnership with the government he established church schools on the new housing estates and was a principal architect of the Chinese University which, unlike the existing Hong Kong University, used Cantonese, not English, as the medium of instruction. He encouraged trade unions and looked forward to a situation in which his diocese would be entirely staffed by Chinese priests, many of them self-supporting.<br>
<br>Hall's expressed views on politics appeared to some impetuous. In 1943 he described the Chinese nationalist leader Chiang Kai-shek in a pamphlet as &#145;a man of God whose achievements are tremendous&#146;  (<span class="italic">China's Fight</span>, 20). When however the Kuomintang's corruption and defeat became evident he referred in a further pamphlet to &#145;the splendid efforts of the People's Republic of China&#146;  (<span class="italic">Hong Kong: what of the Church?</span>, 11). Strong sympathy for the aspirations of Asia and its poor was not altogether unusual in a contemporary colonial ecclesiastic, but Hall's writing on other questions was also striking. He maintained that international commerce was the handmaid of the kingdom of God, and that there was no better school of charity than the bar of a public house. In a fashionably ecumenical age he declared that a divided church helped rather than hindered the spread of Christianity. He delighted that politicians no longer felt easy in claiming that God was on their side, and said that God preferred enjoying people to improving them (Hall, <span class="italic">Hong Kong: what of the Church?</span>, 11; <span class="italic">Family</span>, 25; <span class="italic">Art</span>, 49). His principal hobby was to breed Anglo-Nubian goats whose milk, unlike that of cows, could be digested by the Chinese. Some admirers felt that his charismatic qualities might very profitably have been exercised in an English diocese, but his alienation of the establishment in ordaining a woman precluded such a move. In 1966, on retirement, he became CMG.<br>
<br>A handsome, attractive, but somewhat shy man with a keen sense of humour, Hall preferred to work through an inspired choice of assistants rather than by setting up committees. Occasionally peremptory, he was quick and humble in apologizing. Deeply, though informally, devout, he was widely revered as a saint. He retired in 1966 to Lewknor, Oxfordshire, where he played a modest but helpful part in church and village life until his final illness, dying on 22 April 1975 at the Radcliffe Infirmary, Oxford. He was cremated at St Margaret's, Lewknor, Oxfordshire, three days later. His wife survived him.<br>
