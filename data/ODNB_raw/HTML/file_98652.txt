<span class="headword">Philp,  Hugh</span>  (1786&#150;1856), <span class="occ">golf club maker</span>, was born in the Fife village of Cameron, some four miles from St Andrews, on 19 March 1786, the son of Thomas Philp, an agricultural labourer, and his wife, Helen Shaw, also from a local labouring family. He moved to St Andrews, where he trained as a wright and worked as a home carpenter from premises in Argyle Street. On 23 November 1810 he married Agnes Berwick (<i>d</i>. 1860), three years his junior and sister of James Berwick, the local harbour master. They had five daughters and two sons, all of whom were educated at the town's Madras College.<br>
<br>The links of St Andrews were accessible to all townsfolk and Philp was reported as occasionally playing golf, but his name came to be associated with helping others play rather than any personal prowess. Around 1812 he began to repair golf clubs and, as he gained experience, he moved into making them, using his knowledge of wood and meticulous craftsmanship to change the nature of the product. Golf clubs, like all recreational equipment of the time, were hand-produced, often admired as much for their craftsmanship as for their functionality. Those of Philp combined both beauty and utility.<br>
<br>Philp is often credited with the development, if not the introduction, of hickory imported from Tennessee for the shafts, which gave much greater flexibility than the old ash ones. But his real claim to fame lay in his long-nose club heads, especially the putters, which were items of craftsmanship, always made out of blackthorn, varnished and polished thirty to forty times to get a gleaming finish. The concave faces were long and narrow with graceful lines and curves but they were also designed for their task as they had perfect balance. Unlike other club makers he fastened the horn on to the club face with pins set at a slightly forward angle so that when the club hit the ground the force of the blow would drive the pegs further in. He also devised a stronger method of fastening the head to the shaft, a combination of a scored and tenon joint.<br>
<br>In 1819 Philp was appointed club maker to the Society of Golfers at St Andrews, the organization later to become the Royal and Ancient Golf Club. However, golf was not yet popular enough to provide his only income and in the census of 1831 he was listed as a wright. In fact his appointment with the Society of Golfers had lapsed in the late 1820s when his retainer of 2 guineas a year fell victim to the cost-cutting of the financially strapped organization. From then on his official dealings with the society were limited to payments for joinery work when the society's premises were refurbished in the 1830s and for supplying a wheelbarrow for use on the links in 1848. Indeed his main occupation in St Andrews was internal woodworking on local building projects, including Strathtyrum House, the Union Parlour (a clubhouse in St Andrews), and other large building developments. He is also credited with the internal work on the Free Church at St Andrews, of which he was a staunch member.<br>
<br>Nevertheless the society's members continued to purchase Philp's clubs and his shop at Pilmour Links became a meeting place for golfers who stored their clubs there and for adult caddies awaiting an engagement, both perhaps listening to the golfing stories told with a dry humour by the bespectacled proprietor. His club making business expanded during the 1840s and he employed at least six men to assist him. Among those who learned the art of club making with Philp as mentor was James Wilson, who went on to establish a name in the trade himself. Such was the reputation of Philp's clubs that they were counterfeited even during his lifetime.<br>
<br>Phil's club making career was ended by the coming of the gutta-percha ball. Throughout his life golf had been played with a ball made from leather stuffed with feathers, which his slim, elegant clubs had been designed for hitting. However in the 1840s a new ball was invented using gutta-percha gum. It was much cheaper than the feathery ball and became the ball of choice for the rest of the nineteenth century. The gutta-percha balls were also harder and Philp's clubs were not robust enough to withstand the impact of striking them. Nearing his seventies, Philp was too set in his ways to change, although Robert Forgan, a relative by marriage whom he took into the business in 1852, was less conservative and experimented with new woods and even metal.<br>
<br>Philp died from cancer of the oesophagus at Pilmour Links, St Andrews, on 2 April 1856, and was buried in the burial ground at St Andrews. By the time of his death his children had left St Andrews and Forgan took over the business, which he ran until the death of Philp's widow in 1860. Forgan then branched out on his own but continued to make use of the Philp name. Under his innovative leadership the firm developed and by 1895 employed forty men, perhaps the world's largest golf club manufacturer of the time. Many of its products, particularly the putters, were still based on Philp's design, albeit using different materials, and carried the Philp imprint. Philp's traditional clubs continued to be admired&#151;if not played with&#151;by connoisseurs, who were said to regard them with the same appreciation as of the work of Stradivarius or the Amati. They were sufficiently collectible items by 1901 to be featured in a special display on golf at the Glasgow International Exhibition.<br>
