<span class="headword">Leoba</span> <span class="st"> [St Leoba, Lioba, Leofgyth]</span>  (<em>d.</em> 782), <span class="occ">abbess of Tauberbischofsheim</span>, was the leading female contributor to her kinsman <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2843/', "Boniface's")</script> mission to pagan Germany. Her full name was Leofgyth. Leoba was the only child of elderly parents, Dynne and &AElig;bbe, and entered the monastery of Wimborne as an oblate in the time of Abbess Tetta. She was educated there by Eadburh (<i>fl</i>. 716&#150;746), who knew Boniface and was in correspondence with him. Four lines of verse composed by Leoba in the style of Aldhelm have been preserved in a letter she sent to Boniface in the period after 732 when Boniface began attracting religious from England to work with him. Leoba reminds him of his kinship with her mother and friendship with her father. Subsequently Boniface invited her to join him in Germany, but her move there cannot be dated securely. A passage in her life by Rudolf of Fulda has been interpreted as linking her arrival to the time of the dispatch of Boniface's follower Sturm to Rome in 748, but it is not certain that Rudolf intended such chronological precision, and a letter from Boniface to Leoba and other Anglo-Saxon women known to have worked in Germany provides some support for the idea that she had settled in Germany before 748. Boniface founded a nunnery at Tauberbischofsheim, near W&uuml;rzburg, for Leoba, but according to Rudolf she had a wider authority over all the nuns working with Boniface, comparable to that which Sturm exercised over the monks. Before his departure to Saxony and martyrdom in 754, Boniface reinforced Leoba's position, symbolized by his gift to her of his cowl, and instructed her to continue the work she had begun under his direction.<br>
<br>Leoba's kinship with Boniface must have been of key importance for the authority she continued to enjoy after 754, but that should not detract from her own innate abilities as a spiritual leader. Tauberbischofsheim became a major training centre for Anglo-Saxon religious women working in Germany and several of Leoba's nuns became abbesses themselves, including Thecla, a kinswoman, who became abbess of Kitzingen and of Ochsenfurt, and another West Saxon, Walburg, who succeeded her brother Winnebald as head of the monastery of Heidenheim. According to her biographer, Leoba was an inspirational monastic leader and renowned for her learning in the scriptures, the fathers, and ecclesiastical law. Tauberbischofsheim also had an important role to play in the evangelization of its locality and as abbess Leoba had a difficult and sometimes dangerous position; her hagiography is notable for miraculous events which show her in an active role. One incident reported by Rudolf concerns a false accusation that one of the nuns was the mother of a dead baby found in a millpond, which caused considerable ill feeling against the nunnery. Leoba organized an impressive round of church services and processions and caused the real culprit to confess. On another occasion local panic about a severe storm obliged Leoba to validate the power of God by confronting the storm directly.<br>
<br>Leoba's influence went beyond her immediate locality and the work of the men and women she trained. She was also influential at the courts of Pippin III and his son Charlemagne, and was particularly close to Charlemagne's wife, Hildegard, though, according to Rudolf, Leoba &#145;detested the life at court like poison&#146;  (Rudolf of Fulda, &#145;Vita Leobae&#146;, 129). She was also apparently consulted by bishops on spiritual matters and on ecclesiastical discipline. After Boniface's death Leoba visited Fulda regularly to pray at his tomb and to speak with the monks; as Rudolf stresses, she was an exception to the rules which otherwise prevented women from entering the male preserve. In her old age, having been abbess for twenty-eight years, Leoba gave up her abbacy and retired with a few nuns to Schornsheim, near Mainz, a royal estate which, according to a surviving charter, was made available to her by the gift of Charlemagne.<br>
<br>Leoba died at Schornsheim on 28 September 782 attended by her Anglo-Saxon chaplain Torhthat, who seems to have been a member of the community at Tauberbischofsheim for many years. Her death is recorded in the necrology of Fulda. Boniface had requested that she be buried in his own tomb, but although she was buried at Fulda it was not considered appropriate to reopen Boniface's grave and she was at first buried near him in the crypt of the main church. Abbot Eigil subsequently translated her remains to the west porch and a number of miracles are reported at her tomb from this time, including the healing of a Spaniard who came to Fulda after a fruitless tour of the shrines of Italy and France and was cured through the joint intervention of Boniface and Leoba. Following an extensive programme of rebuilding at Fulda during the abbacy of Hrabanus Maurus (822 to 841 or 842), Leoba's remains were translated again in 836 or 838 and placed in a reliquary behind an altar, dedicated to Mary and the female virgins of Christ, in the crypt of a new church on the nearby hill of Petersburg, where her remains can still be visited. It may have been in preparation for this translation that Hrabanus commissioned Rudolf, a monk of Fulda, to compose his life of St Leoba, which was completed before the body was transferred. The work is dedicated to a nun called Hadamout and drew upon the recorded remembrances of female disciples of Leoba, including her kinswoman Thecla, who may also have been formerly a nun at Wimborne; they evidently recalled her with affection and respect.<br>
