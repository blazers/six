<span class="headword">Poynings <span class="st"> [Ponyngs]</span>,  Michael</span>, first Lord Poynings  (<em>c.</em>1318&#150;1369), <span class="occ">soldier</span>, of Poynings and Slaugham, Sussex, was the eldest son of Sir Thomas Poynings and his wife, Agnes, daughter and coheir of Richard Rokesley of Preston and Ruxley, Kent. Michael Poynings served in Flanders from 1338 to 1340. Thomas Poynings having died at the siege of Honnecourt in the Vermandois on 10 October 1339, the king gave Michael his marriage and livery of his lands, although he was still under age, in consideration of his father's good service. Poynings was summoned to campaign in Scotland in December 1341, and to attend council meetings in February 1342, July 1352, July 1353, and June 1358. He went on the expedition to Brittany of 1342, and on the Cr&eacute;cy&#150;Calais campaign of 1346&#150;7, where he served with forty-five men, including his uncle Michael Poynings. From August 1347 to September 1351 he had the keeping of the property of Margery, widow of Nicholas Beche, forfeited by her husband, Sir John Dalton, following their unlicensed marriage. The Daltons had abducted Margery from a manor house near Reading in March 1347, in the process slaying Michael, the uncle of Lord Poynings; a number of the latter's men were charged with the killing until he personally vouched for them.<br>
<br>From November 1348 Poynings was summoned to parliament as Lord Poynings. By the end of that year he had married Joan, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Ruxley (<i>d</i>. 1369), the childless widow of John Moleyns; she brought with her properties in Wiltshire and Buckinghamshire. Their eldest son, <a href="#cosubject_65098">Thomas [<i>see below</i>]</a>, was born at Slaugham in the following year. A frequent commissioner in Sussex, Kent, and the Cinque Ports from 1351, in that and the following year Poynings was a guardian of the Sussex coast. He campaigned in France in 1355 and 1356, fighting at Poitiers, and with his brothers Richard and Luke among his company, took part in Edward III's invasion of France of 1359&#150;60. He was a signatory to the treaty with Castile in June 1362. In the last seven years of his life Poynings made preparations for the future: in November 1362 his plans to found a chantry at Mottenden, Kent, laid as far back as 1347, at last came to fruition. In February 1366 he paid &pound;1000 to Queen Philippa for the wardship of William, son and heir of Lord Bardolf, in order to marry him to his daughter Agnes. Poynings died on 7 March 1369 and was buried in Poynings church, having left 200 marks in his will to finance its rebuilding. He had acquired considerable property in Norfolk, Sussex, and Kent.<br>
<br>Michael Poynings's nineteen-year-old son <a name="cosubject_65098"></a><span class="headword">Thomas Poynings</span>, second Lord Poynings  (1349&#150;1375)<span class="occ"></span>, who was heir to his father's properties in Kent and Sussex, became a royal ward; he was coheir with his twelve-year-old brother, <a href="#cosubject_65099">Richard [<i>see below</i>]</a>, to the property held by Kentish gavelkind tenure. Their mother Joan died on 16 May 1369, when her estates in Wiltshire and Buckinghamshire reverted to the Moleyns family. Thomas Poynings succeeded to his father's title, as second Lord Poynings, but died in June 1375 at the age of twenty-six, possibly in consequence of being immured for two years in a Castilian prison after he was captured in the sea battle of La Rochelle in 1372. There were no children of his marriage to Blanche, daughter of John (II) Mowbray, Lord Mowbray. Thomas was succeeded by his brother <a name="cosubject_65099"></a><span class="headword">Richard Poynings</span>, third Baron Poynings  (<em>c.</em>1355&#150;1387)<span class="occ"></span>, who went to Spain with John of Gaunt, duke of Lancaster, in 1386 (making a will at Plymouth, as the army prepared to sail, in which he made careful provision both for the payment of his debts and the future of his younger children), and died there on 25 May 1387. His wife was Isabel, daughter and heir of Robert Grey (Robert Fitzpayn), a younger son of Richard, Lord Grey of Codnor.<br>
<br>Richard's son and heir <a name="cosubject_22685"></a><span class="headword">Robert Poynings</span>, fourth Baron Poynings  (1382&#150;1446)<span class="occ"></span>, was summoned to parliament in 1404, and is several times recorded as attending council meetings under Henry IV. He served regularly in France, taking custody of the duke of Bourbon in 1420, and fighting at Cravant in 1420, and at the recovery of Crotoy and the battle of Verneuil in 1424. He married twice. With his first wife, whose name is unknown, he had two sons, Richard, who was killed in France in 1429, and <a name="cosubject_65100"></a><span class="headword">Robert Poynings</span>  (<em>c.</em>1419&#150;1461)<span class="occ"></span>. The second Robert's life was dominated by his struggle to acquire the Kentish manors of Tirlingham, Newington, Eastwell, and Westwood, which his father had settled on Eleanor (1428&#150;1484), daughter of Robert's elder brother, Richard, and wife of Henry Percy, third earl of Northumberland and, by right of his wife, fifth Baron Poynings. Robert claimed these manors as heir by gavelkind. He also claimed Great Perching in Sussex. In the summer of 1450 he was one of a handful of gentry to join the Cade rebellion, apparently acting as Cade's carver and sword-bearer. He may have been motivated by another feud, this time with his stepbrother, William Crowmer (whose mother had been the fourth Lord Poynings's second wife), over the fourth Lord Poynings's moveables (Crowmer was a particular target of the rebels). Robert did not take out a pardon until 1457, in the meantime suffering outlawry and imprisonment, but this did not prevent him from sitting as MP for Sussex from October 1450 to May 1451. In 1458 he married Elizabeth (1429?&#150;1487/8), daughter of Judge William Paston, with whom he had a son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22683/', "Edward Poynings")</script>, the future lord deputy of Ireland. Robert was killed fighting for the Yorkists at the battle of St Albans on 17 February 1461.<br>
