<span class="headword">Boultbee,  Thomas Pownall</span>  (1818&#150;1884), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, was born in Hope Street, Liverpool, on 7 August 1818. He was the eldest son of a family of four boys and three girls of the Revd Thomas Boultbee (1793&#150;1883), vicar of Bidford-on-Avon and Salford Priors, Warwickshire, and his wife, Eliza Pownall (1790&#150;1858).<br>
<br>Boultbee was educated privately and then at Uppingham School (1833&#150;7), before proceeding to St John's College, Cambridge, where he was admitted as a sizar in 1837. He graduated BA in 1841 (fifth wrangler), MA in 1844, and LLD in 1871. He was elected to a fellowship of his college in 1841, and was ordained deacon in 1844 and priest in 1845, assisting in the parishes of Wolverton and Bearley in the same area as his father. Between 1846 and 1849 he served a curacy at Oldberrow and Morton Bagot, near Henley in Arden, and tutored private pupils. On 22 December 1846 he married Caroline Frances (1825&#150;1906), daughter of Robert Lawrance (<i>d</i>. 1871), rector of Bleadon, Somerset. They had a family of four daughters and three sons (two of whom were ordained).<br>
<br>In 1849 Boultbee became curate to the Revd Francis Close at Cheltenham parish church. They became firm friends and Boultbee was the most able of Close's numerous curates. Between 1853 and 1863 Boultbee was one of the theological tutors (and later housemaster and chaplain) of Cheltenham College. The evangelical outlook of the school was maintained with Close as the chairman of the directors, and by the presence and influence of the theological tutors.<br>
<br>In 1863 Boultbee became the first principal of the London College of Divinity, founded by the Revd Alfred Peache and his sister Kezia, which opened in a former school in Kilburn, London. In 1866 the college was relocated to a former college in Highbury (where it remained until 1940). During Boultbee's principalship 300 men were trained for ordained ministry at home and overseas, and the college buildings were considerably enlarged by the architect Ewan Christian. There were two notable staff appointments, Revd C. H. Waller (who succeeded Boultbee as principal) and Revd H. Gee (who later became master of University College, Durham, and dean of Gloucester).<br>
<br>Islington was the leading evangelical parish in London, and the London College of Divinity became an important centre of learning there, alongside the Church Missionary College (opened in 1825). Boultbee was an evangelical by conviction, and gave strong leadership to the college and within the evangelical party. Committed to the principles of the Reformation, he was judicious, &#145;soundly and calmly wise&#146;, with little &#145;polemical bitterness&#146; about him  (Calthrop, 27&#150;8). His <span class="italic">Commentary on the Thirty-Nine Articles</span> (1871), based on his theological lectures, was widely approved and used as a textbook in other evangelical theological colleges. He published a number of sermons, gave papers on theological education at church congresses and to lay and clerical associations, and regularly spoke at the Islington clerical meeting.<br>
<br>Boultbee was an examining chaplain to J. C. Ryle, bishop of Liverpool, and in October 1883 was made a prebendary of St Paul's Cathedral by John Jackson, bishop of London. He suffered from gout, and died while convalescing at Bournemouth on 30 January 1884. He was buried at Chesham, Buckinghamshire, where his youngest son was the vicar. Ryle spoke at his memorial service in Christ Church, Highbury, in February 1884.<br>
