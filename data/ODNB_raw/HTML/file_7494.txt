<span class="headword">Denman,  Thomas</span>  (1733&#150;1815), <span class="occ">man-midwife</span>, was born at Bakewell, Derbyshire, on 27 June 1733, the second son and third child of John Denman, apothecary, and his wife, Elizabeth. After early education at the free school in Bakewell, Denman became assistant to his elder brother, who had succeeded to their father's business. In 1753 Denman went to London and began to study medicine at St George's Hospital, but within six months his savings had run out. He then decided to apply for the post of surgeon's mate in the navy. During the next nine years Denman led an adventurous life as surgeon's mate and surgeon. On leaving service in 1763, he returned to Bakewell, but he soon decided to move to London and resume his medical studies. Midwifery in particular attracted him. The male practice of midwifery had been steadily increasing since the first quarter of the eighteenth century, and many were the medical men who had made their fame and fortune in this field. Once in London, Denman continued his study of anatomy, and attended William Smellie's midwifery lectures. On 13 July 1764 Denman gained an MD from Aberdeen University. After a short but unsuccessful attempt to set up practice in Winchester, Denman returned to London, where he lodged at first with Mr Norton, apothecary in the Strand. Denman took on any job, however small, but progress was so slow that he tried to resume his previous position in the navy.<br>
<br>Denman was unable to procure a warrant, but he had the luck to be granted &pound;70 a year for occasional duties as a surgeon on one of the royal yachts. This enabled him to rent a small house in Oxenden Street, off the Haymarket, which helped increase his professional visibility. His practice began to grow rapidly, boosted also by two publications that were well received in medical circles. The collection of <span class="italic">Essays on the Puerperal Fever, and on Puerperal convulsion</span> (1768) was followed in the same year by a short publication on the <span class="italic">Construction and Use of Vapour Baths</span>, which appeared in the form of a letter to Dr Huck. Denman recommended the use of an apparatus in which steam from the spout of a kettle was introduced within the envelope of blankets enclosing the patient.<br>
<br>As a man-midwife Denman faced strong competition in London. William Hunter enjoyed the most extensive and lucrative practice in the West End of town, and it was not until his death in 1783 that Denman was able to make rapid progress. Denman was appointed physician&#150;accoucheur to the Middlesex Hospital in 1769. About this time Dr Cooper, a teacher of midwifery of no great reputation, died, and Denman agreed to give lectures in conjunction with William Osborn, a fellow student at St George's Hospital. Denman and Osborn purchased Cooper's apparatus for &pound;120 and in 1770 they began to lecture. The lectures flourished, as did Denman's business. Denman married at St James, Westminster, on 1 November 1770, Elizabeth (1747&#150;1833), younger daughter of Alexander Brodie, an army linen draper; they had one son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7495/', "Thomas Denman (1779&#150;1854)")</script>, who became lord chief justice of England, and twin daughters; one married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1066/', "Matthew Baillie")</script>, the other <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6722/', "Sir Richard Croft")</script>. In 1772 Denman moved to Queen Street, Golden Square, where he lectured and practised. By 1778 he was making &pound;600 a year from his practice and &pound;150 from the lectures, but as he found that his income was not increasing as rapidly as he hoped, he took six pupils. In 1781 the house in Queen Street burnt down and Denman then moved to Old Burlington Street, where he lived for many years.<br>
<br>By the mid-1780s Denman had established his reputation as one of the leading man-midwives in London. In 1783, when the Royal College of Physicians resolved to grant a licence in midwifery, Denman was one of three practitioners who successfully applied for it. By now his practice was so extensive that he was forced to resign his post at the Middlesex Hospital. In 1791 he purchased a house at Feltham, Middlesex, and began to limit himself to consultations, while his son-in-law Richard Croft carried out the more laborious part of the practice. When Croft was established Denman moved to a smaller house in Old Burlington Street, and afterwards to Mount Street.<br>
<br>Denman's reputation rests on two works: <span class="italic">Aphorisms on the application and use of the forceps, and vectis; on preternatural labours, on labours attended with haemorrhage, and with convulsions</span> (1783); and <span class="italic">An Introduction to the Practice of Midwifery</span> (2 vols., 1794, 1795). The latter ran through seven editions. Denman advocated the induction of premature labour in cases of contracted pelvis. It was chiefly due to his adoption of the procedure that the practice became established in Britain long before it was accepted abroad. In cases requiring the use of instruments, Denman favoured the vectis over the forceps. This suggests that he may have been connected with John Bamber, a London man-midwife who had acquired the vectis from the Chamberlen family and kept its use a secret for a long time. Denman's use of instruments was limited, however. Like Smellie and Hunter he trusted and admired nature, arguing that too much confidence in one's dexterity and too little dependence on the natural resources of the organism caused more errors in the practice of midwifery than ignorance of the art.<br>
<br>Denman had a cheerful and amiable disposition. He was a well-cultivated and entertaining man, of remarkably simple habits and unassuming manners. He had a firm belief in religion and took an active interest in public charities, especially the Society for the Relief of Widows and Orphans of Medical Men. Denman died suddenly at Mount Street on 25 November 1815 and was buried in London at St James's Church, Piccadilly.<br>
