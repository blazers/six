<span class="headword">Douglas,  Archibald</span>, second earl of Forfar  (1692&#150;1715), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7871/', "Archibald Douglas, first earl of Forfar (1653&#150;1712)")</script>, soldier and politician, and his second wife, Robina Lockhart (<i>d</i>. 1741), was born on 25 May 1692. In his early years he bore the courtesy title of Lord Wandell, and Queen Anne about 1704 granted him a yearly pension of &pound;200 to assist his education. In 1712, on the death of his father, he succeeded as second earl. In the following year, though only twenty years of age, he was appointed colonel of the 3rd, or Buff, regiment of infantry. In 1714 he petitioned Anne for payment of arrears, both of his father's pension and his own, amounting together to &pound;1400; he pointed out at the same time that in her majesty's service he had incurred a debt of about &pound;3000. He was appointed envoy-extraordinary to Prussia in 1715 (credentials dated 14 July) but never took up his post.<br>
<br>In 1715 Forfar served as a brigadier-general in the army raised by the duke of Argyll for quelling the Jacobite rising in Scotland, and was present on 13 November at the indecisive combat at Sheriffmuir, where he fought bravely, but sustained wounds that were to prove fatal. He was taken prisoner to Stirling, and died there on 8 December. He was buried in Bothwell church, where a monument was erected to his memory. As he died unmarried the title of earl of Forfar became extinct, and his estates passed to Archibald, first duke of Douglas.<br>
