<span class="headword">Lundy,  Robert</span>  (<em>d.</em> before 1717), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was a Scot, probably from Fife. He was commissioned in Lord Dumbarton's regiment (later the Royal Scots), which served on the continent in the French service until 1678, by which time he was a captain. He served in England and Ireland until 1680, when the regiment was sent to Tangier. He was seriously wounded while leading an attack on the trenches in the victory over the Moors on 27 October 1680. He received &pound;80 bounty in compensation for his wounds in 1683.<br>
<br>Lundy married Martha, a daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7261/', "Rowland Davies")</script>, later dean of Cork, and with her had at least one son and one daughter who survived him. Through his wife's connections he was able to get the duke of Ormond to secure him a commission as lieutenant-colonel in the regiment of William Stewart, Viscount Mountjoy, in Ireland in 1685. Under Lundy's command the regiment formed the garrison of Londonderry until November 1688, when it was recalled to Dublin so as to make way for a newly raised Catholic regiment. Mountjoy's regiment was sent straight back to Londonderry after the citizens rebelled and shut the gates on the replacement garrison. Mountjoy signed articles promising that he would seek a pardon for this act of rebellion and left Lundy as the governor of Londonderry and the commander of the troops in the north-west.<br>
<br>In March 1689, when civil war was inevitable, Lundy ordered Lord Kingston to evacuate Sligo, and advised Gustavus Hamilton to abandon Coleraine. On 21 March he swore, albeit in private, an oath of allegiance to William and Mary and received his new commission as governor of Londonderry. When the Irish army crossed the River Bann in early April 1689, Lundy consolidated his position by ordering his outlying garrisons back to the city. He burnt the Waterside to deny the enemy shelter, and in a hurried council of war on 13 April he ordered all his troops to assemble at the fords on the rivers Finn and Foyle, which he hoped to be able to hold against King James's army. The plan resulted in a precipitate flight back to Londonderry on 15 April. Lundy was criticized for his handling of the affair and for failing to get those troops commanded by Lord Kingston to join him. This criticism grew after he held a council of war on 16 April with the officers from two English regiments who had been sent by sea to join the garrison. It was concluded that, as there were not enough provisions in Londonderry and as the city was untenable in any event, the reinforcements should not disembark. As soon as it was realized that Lundy had sent the reinforcements away, it was rumoured that he was planning to surrender. He was forced to take refuge in his house from a violent mob led by Adam Murray who had let in to the city all those fugitives whom Lundy had locked out. He called a further council in which he was asked to resume his governorship. Having no control over the mob, he refused, and on 19 April Henry Baker and George Walker were elected joint governors in his place. On the evening of 20 April Lundy disguised himself as a common soldier and with Walker's connivance he slipped out of the city with four others and managed to cross in an open boat to Islay where he was arrested. He was released by the governor of Dumbarton, a relation of his, and made his way to London where he was placed in the Tower. He was in the meantime attainted by King James's Dublin parliament.<br>
<br>There has over the centuries been an unresolved debate as to whether Lundy was a Jacobite agent intent on preventing resistance or a Williamite who honestly thought that Londonderry would not be able to withstand the Irish army. The fact that Lundy chose to make a hazardous escape to avoid falling into Jacobite hands makes his being a traitor unlikely. In August 1689 he was brought before a House of Commons committee appointed &#145;to inquire into the miscarriages relating to Ireland and Londonderry&#146;. It was initially recommended that he be sent back to Londonderry to face trial for treason, but this never happened since George Walker let it be known that Lundy still had his supporters there. Lundy remained in the Tower until February 1690, when he was produced on a writ of habeas corpus and bailed in the sum of &pound;12,000, &pound;2000 of which was put up by the earl of Clarendon, the erstwhile lord lieutenant of Ireland. He was never brought to trial but left military life until after the death of King William in 1702. In 1704 he travelled to Lisbon with Queen Anne's letter of recommendation for employment and was appointed the adjutant-general of the king of Portugal's forces in the queen of England's pay, a post he held until 1712. He brought reinforcements to Gibraltar in December 1704 and served there until the siege was raised in the following March. He was later captured by the French at sea in April 1707 and taken to France. He was exchanged for twenty men in June 1709. He died some time before 1717. Since 1788 he has been remembered in Londonderry by the annual burning of his effigy bearing the sign &#145;Lundy the traitor&#146;.<br>
