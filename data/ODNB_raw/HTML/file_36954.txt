<span class="headword">Wilson,  George Fergusson</span>  (1822&#150;1902), <span class="occ">industrial chemist</span>, was born on 25 March 1822 in Wandsworth, Surrey, the sixth son in a family of thirteen children of William Wilson (1772&#150;1860) and his wife, Margaret Nimmo Dickson, both of Scottish extraction. William Wilson had gone to London in 1812 after the failure of the ironworks of his own father in Lanarkshire. Building on previous experience in Russia, he and his partner, Benjamin Lancaster, started a brokering business for the Russia trade, which within ten years became extremely profitable. One of the principal Russian exports was tallow, and it is likely that their familiarity with its uses led them in 1830 to buy a patent granted to James Soames in 1829 for the processing of coconut oil, to yield a solid fat which would substitute for tallow in candle manufacture, and an oil for burning in lamps. The partners did not wish to engage in industry under their own names, so called their venture E. Price &amp; Co., apparently because Lancaster had an aunt named Price, albeit she was not connected with the business in any way. They built a factory at Battersea to process the coconut oil, and soon discovered that they could adopt a French method to obtain a superior product from tallow. By 1840 their &#145;composite&#146; candles, made from a blend of tallow and coconut fats moulded on plaited wicks, found a ready market.<br>
<br>George Wilson, meanwhile, was educated in Wandsworth and placed in a solicitor's office. He joined Prices in 1840, in place of his elder brother James, who had gone to Ceylon to assist his brother David in managing the firm's recently acquired coconut plantations. George soon showed a flair for developing the technical side of the business. He bought or licensed many domestic and foreign patents, and hired experts to investigate the chemistry of fats and oils, so that the quality and range of products was continually improved and expanded. A key discovery was the benefit of treating fatty materials by steam distillation, one stage in the process whereby a range of industrial wastes could be rendered into colourless, odourless material for candles. In 1847, needing to raise more capital, Price's Patent Candle Company was registered as a joint-stock company with a capital of &pound;500,000. It was still very much a family affair; William Wilson remained as chairman of the directors, with his sons as managers: David in Ceylon, James looking after the commercial side, George the technical side, and Robert as company solicitor.<br>
<br>In 1854 a process was devised for the commercial manufacture of pure glycerine, a product with important medicinal and industrial uses. This encouraged the company to build a new factory at Bromborough Pool, near Liverpool, the port where its tropical oils were unloaded. The company was always concerned with the welfare of its workforce, and provided educational, cultural, and sporting facilities both there and at Battersea. George Wilson, in a search for less expensive raw materials, asked Sir William Hooker, director of the Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew, to assist in identifying suitable vegetables fats, but without success. However, in 1857 the company took out a licence to process Burmese petroleum, obtaining burning oil, lubricating oil, and paraffin wax, which turned out to be the sought-after cheap candle-making material. Candles and lamp oil were then only part of a range of domestic, medical, and industrial products, including toilet and industrial soaps, textile and other industrial oils and lubricants, petroleum jelly, and glycerine.<br>
<br>In 1845 Wilson was made a member of the Society of Arts. He contributed frequently to its <span class="italic">Journal</span>, was a member of its council from 1854 to 1859 and again from 1864 to 1867, and its treasurer from 1861 to 1863. In 1855 he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society and a fellow of the Chemical Society, and he read at the meeting of the British Association at Glasgow a paper on &#145;A new mode of obtaining pure glycerine&#146;.<br>
<br>On 13 August 1862 Wilson married Ellen, eldest daughter of Robert Wildman Barchard, a merchant of Wandsworth; they had two sons and a daughter. In 1863 he retired, but continued to act as a manufacturing adviser to Prices for five years; he was then elected as one of the directors and served as such until his death. In his retirement he was an enthusiastic and scientific gardener, and the insecticide Gishurst Compound and the leather preservative Gishurstine derived their names from his residence, Gishurst Cottage, Weybridge.<br>
<br>In later life Wilson lived at Heatherbank, Weybridge Heath, Surrey, where he devoted himself to experimental gardening on a wide scale, which he carried on at another, larger site, Oakwood, near Wisley, which he acquired in 1878. There he experimented with a range of plants in a variety of soil conditions, but was best known for creating a wild garden, which included a miniature bog garden. He was particularly successful as a cultivator of lilies, gaining between 1867 and 1883 twenty-five first-class certificates for species exhibited. Elected a fellow of the Royal Horticultural Society, he served on various of its committees, and was at one time vice-president. At his suggestion the society introduced guinea subscriptions, and in the controversies within the society between the so-called Chiswick and Kensington factions he published a pamphlet entitled <span class="italic">The Royal Horticultural Society: as it Is and as it Might Be</span> (1874). The society awarded him its Victoria medal of honour in 1897. In 1875 he was elected a fellow of the Linnean Society. He died at Heatherbank, on 28 March 1902. His wife survived him. In 1903 his garden at Wisley was purchased by Sir Thomas Hanbury and presented to the Royal Horticultural Society.<br>
