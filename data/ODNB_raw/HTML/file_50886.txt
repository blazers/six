<span class="headword">Grierson,  George</span>  (<em>c.</em>1680&#150;1753), <span class="occ">bookseller and printer</span>, was born in Edinburgh, the son of George Grierson, merchant, and his wife, Margaret Allane. His father's family had held estates in Dumfriesshire and Kirkcudbrightshire since the early fifteenth century. His elder brother James became minister of religion at Tingwall, Shetland. Nothing is known of George's early life and training except that he moved to Dublin in 1703 as a bookseller and printer. He purchased a house in Essex Street in Dublin for &pound;533 and was admitted in 1709 as freeman of the city. In 1720 he set up his own printing house and was made a churchwarden of St John the Evangelist, Drumcondra, on the outskirts of Dublin. It seems that his printing office and his house were situated at Drumcondra.<br>
<br>Grierson's first wife, Mary, was buried at St John's on 19 May 1726, and in the same year he married the talented classical scholar Constantia Crawley (1704/5&#150;1732) of co. Kilkenny [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/11575/', "Grierson, Constantia")</script>]. As she was a good friend of Jonathan Swift, Grierson's reputation as a printer was considerably enhanced. With her help he was appointed printer-general to the king in Ireland, and the post was confirmed by a patent dated 1 December 1727. Lord Carteret praised the work of both Grierson and his wife in a letter of 20 December 1730 to the duke of Newcastle, in which he claimed that they had made printing into an art and recommended that Grierson should succeed Andrew Crooke as the king's printer. Grierson was appointed to the office of king's printer after Cooke's death in July 1732, and received a final grant of the office to himself and his heirs on 1 December 1744. Constantia died on 2 December 1732 at the age of twenty-seven and was buried at St John's on 4 December, mourned by her only surviving son, George Abraham, and her husband, who depended so much on her scholarship and contacts. Grierson none the less married for a third time on 20 August 1734 at Belfast. His bride was a widow, Jane Cromie (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Blow); they had seven children, three of whom died young.<br>
<br>Grierson was a successful businessman, and besides his own books he published for the government and for institutions such as Dr Steevens's hospital; between 1735 and 1748 he earned &pound;650 from printing for the Incorporated Society for Promoting English Protestant Schools. His publishing output was certainly large by Irish standards. His wife's editions of Virgil, Terence, Justinian, Juvenal, and Tacitus, which were published between 1724 and 1730, became known as <span class="roman">Grierson's Classics</span>, and his reprints included <span class="italic">Pope's Miscellany Poems</span> (1736), which sold nearly 1500 copies. Grierson also had the sole rights to reprinting Bibles, the <span class="roman">Book of Common Prayer</span>, and <span class="roman">Psalms</span> in Dublin; in 1749 he published 20,000 copies of the <span class="roman">New Testament</span> to &#145;open the eyes of the poor Papists&#146;. His fine editions of Sir William Petty's <span class="italic">Maps of Ireland</span> and Dupin's <span class="italic">Ecclesiastical History</span>, in three folio volumes (1722&#150;4), added to his reputation.<br>
<br>Grierson died in Dublin on 27 October 1753, and left the king's printer's patent and a quarter of his estate to his son George Abraham, on condition that his half-brother Hugh Boulter should receive a quarter of the benefits when aged twenty-one. Grierson's brothers-in-law George Ewing, a bookseller in Dublin who married Jane Grierson in 1718, and James Blow (1676&#150;1759), a Belfast printer, were his executors. In 1759 his widow moved to Castle Street, Dublin, where she carried on the bookselling business.<br>
