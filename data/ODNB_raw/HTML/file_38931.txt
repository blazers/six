<span class="headword">Richard,  Timothy</span>  (1845&#150;1919), <span class="occ">missionary</span>, was born on 10 October 1845 in Ffaldybrenin, Carmarthenshire, the ninth and last child of Timothy Richard, blacksmith and farmer, and his wife, Eleanor Lewis, who were devout Baptists. The family moved permanently to Tan-yr-esgair farm soon after his birth. Richard left the local Congregational school at the age of fourteen, and briefly attended a private school at Cross Inn near Llanelli and a grammar school at Llanybydder. He taught in the mining village of Pen-y-groes while completing a short course at the Swansea normal school, and at eighteen he became master of the 120 pupil endowed school at Cynwyl Elfed, where he remained for two years.<br>
<br>Richard had experienced spiritual rejuvenation during the great revival that swept over northern Europe and the British Isles between 1858 and 1860, and as a twelve-year-old was baptized&#151;along with fifty others&#151;by the Revd John Davies in the River Caeo near his home, joining the Caeo Baptist Church. In 1865 he enrolled in Haverfordwest Theological College (Baptist) in Pembrokeshire; he distinguished himself academically and played a prominent role in the student-led reformation of the curriculum. An address in 1868 by Mrs Grattan Guinness on the work of the China Inland Mission moved Richard to pursue a missionary vocation.<br>
<br>After graduating at Haverfordwest in 1869 Richard was accepted by the Baptist Missionary Society (BMS); he departed for China in November of the same year and arrived in Chefoo (Yantai) on 27 February 1870. He then commenced a missionary career of forty-five years which was remarkable enough to make <i>Li T'i-mo-tai</i> a household name throughout China in his day; he also earned Chinese honours rarely, if ever, bestowed upon foreigners (&#145;Mandarin with a red button&#146;, the highest grade, in 1903; member of the order of the Double Dragon&#151;second order, second grade&#151;in 1907), which ensured him a place in both contemporary Chinese and mission history.<br>
<br>Disenchanted by traditional mission stratagems, Richard's role in combating the effects and discerning the causes of the great famine of 1876&#150;9 convinced him of the need for a radical transformation of China's social and political infrastructures&#151;reform that could be best achieved by providing the Chinese &#145;thinking classes&#146; with a modern education. Accordingly he began to concentrate on reaching Chinese literati and governing officials, reasoning that in their re-education lay the key to the transformation of China. &#145;Conversion by the Million&#146; would, according to Richard, be accomplished by &#145;three radical reforms in mission methods&#146;: first by presenting Christianity &#145;as the kingdom of God to be established, not only in the hearts of men, but also in all institutions on earth&#146;; second by preaching not merely or even primarily to the millions of poor and needy, but &#145;to the leaders of the millions (who made the law of the land and held the poor in bondage)&#146;; and third by &#145;preaching to devout souls, the worthy &hellip; the born ambassadors of God&#146;&#151;pious Confucianists, Buddhists, Taoists, and secret sect members&#151;&#145;the natural messengers of peace and salvation in all lands, [whom] the multitudes follow &hellip; as certainly as the swarming bees follow the queen bee&#146;  (Richard, <span class="italic">Conversion by the Million</span>, 13&#150;15).<br>
<br>Richard's scheme was regarded by the Baptist Missionary Society as rather larger than either their means or vision could accommodate. His more evangelical peers viewed his association with non-Christian religions with marked suspicion, and his dream of a Christian college for every Chinese province never materialized. Deeply disappointed he parted company with the BMS (though he continued to receive financial support from the society) and became editor of a Chinese daily newspaper, the <span class="italic">Shibao</span> (&#145;The Times&#146;) in 1890, before moving in 1891 to Shanghai to serve as secretary of the Society for the Diffusion of Christian and General Knowledge, later known as the Christian Literature Society, an association that continued until his retirement from active missionary service in 1915.<br>
<br>Writing and translating numerous books and pamphlets, Richard gained a reputation among reform-minded Chinese leaders and intellectuals; this reached its apogee in 1898 when he was invited to become adviser to the emperor. While the empress dowager's bloody ascent to power, precipitating the Boxer uprising of 1900, brought a temporary halt to reform, Richard played a vital role in the establishment in 1901 of Shansi (Shanxi) University. The institution was modelled on Western lines, funded with indemnity moneys, and widely emulated throughout China, and Richard served as the school's chancellor, with jurisdiction over the curriculum.<br>
<br>Internationally Richard exerted considerable influence as a consultant to statesmen, educators, and missionaries, and he is credited with creating and fostering seminal ideals that would eventually take form as the League of Nations. During the Russo-Japanese War of 1904&#150;5 he was made secretary of the International Red Cross Society in Shanghai.<br>
<br>Richard's marriage to Mary Martin (<i>b</i>. 1843) in October 1878 produced four daughters, Eleanor, Mary Celia, Florence, and Margaret, and lasted until his wife's death from cancer on 10 July 1903. Born in Edinburgh, Mary Martin was a person of marked musical and intellectual ability; she served the six years prior to her departure for China (where she arrived to work with the United Presbyterian Mission in Chefoo in 1877) as a teaching governess on the staff of the Merchant Company's College School in Edinburgh. After their marriage she made notable use of her gifts in publishing a considerable body of Chinese literature&#151;in some instances translations of existing works&#151;and in the training and supervision of &#145;Biblewomen&#146;.<br>
<br>Richard's second marriage, in August 1914, was to Dr Ethel Newton Tribe of the London Missionary Society (LMS). Ethel Tribe was born on 5 July 1860 at Bristol. She studied medicine at the London School of Medicine for Women, and at University College Hospital, London. From 1895 to 1912 she served as a medical missionary of the LMS&#151;in Amoy (Xiamen) until 1909, then in Shanghai, where she was director of the women's hospital and instrumental in founding the children's ward. She retired from active service with the LMS in 1912.<br>
<br>In addition to his Chinese honours Richard received an honorary DD degree from Emory University in 1895, an honorary LittD degree from Brown University in 1901, and the LLD degree of the University of Wales in Aberystwyth in 1916. Having returned to Britain in 1915 because of illness, he died unexpectedly in London at Hendon Cottage Hospital on 17 April 1919, following surgery. He was cremated and his remains interred in Golders Green cemetery; he was survived by his second wife.<br>
