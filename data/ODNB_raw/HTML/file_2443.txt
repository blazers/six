<span class="headword">Bird,  Edward</span>  (1772&#150;1819), <span class="occ">genre and history painter</span>, was born in Cat Yard, Berry Street, Wolverhampton, on 12 April 1772 and baptized there the same day, one of the many children of a local carpenter (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1810). After attending the free grammar school he was apprenticed at the age of thirteen as a japanning artist to the firm of Jones and Taylor at the Old Hall Works, Wolverhampton. On completion of his term he first set up as an independent artist in the town, before moving to Bristol about 1794. He later married Martha (1779/80&#150;1846), youngest daughter of John Dodrell, a Bristol engraver. In 1797 he advertised his services, offering drawing lessons as a historical and landscape painter, but there is strong evidence that he had first been obliged to continue his trade as a painter of tea trays at the Japan and Pontypool manufactory at Temple Back, Bristol.<br>
<br>A painted cartouche within a self-portrait of about 1805 (City Museum and Art Gallery, Bristol) proclaims Bird to be a portrait painter. He also undertook book illustrations which included topographical views of Bristol and, together with the Bristol marine artist Nicholas Pocock, the illustrations for William Williams's <span class="italic">The Journal of Penrose, Seaman</span> (drawings, Lilly Library, Indiana University, Bloomington, Indiana). One of his earliest securely dated oil paintings, <span class="italic">Falstaff</span> (1807; City Museum and Art Gallery, Bristol), reflects a long-standing interest in the theatre which had begun in Wolverhampton. At Wolverhampton also, Bird's first commission is said to have been a painting for a Roman Catholic chapel, and in Bristol he undertook the large altarpiece for St Paul's, Portman Square, the building of which was completed in 1794. This variety reflects both his versatility and the difficulties of working in a provincial city in the first decade of the nineteenth century. His coming success was to be of crucial encouragement to the artists, amateurs, and patrons of Bristol and to lay the foundations for the emergence of the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/95531', "Bristol school of artists")</script> about 1820.<br>
<br>Bird himself also benefited greatly from the connections and contacts of his Bristol friends such as George Cumberland, with whom he was certainly well acquainted by 1806. Cumberland wrote of Bird that &#145;for some years he was the centre of a society assembled to make drawings in the evening before supper, where the greater number of members were amateurs&#146;  (<span class="italic">Catalogue</span>, 16). In 1809 Bird first exhibited at the Royal Academy, showing an interior scene with an old soldier entitled <span class="italic">Good News</span>. Hung next to David Wilkie's <span class="italic">The Cut Finger</span> (priv. coll.), it immediately attracted attention and Bird found himself championed as the reluctant rival of an artist whom he admired. The following year the prince regent bought Bird's <span class="italic">The Country Choristers</span> (Royal Collection) at the Royal Academy and then, with the advice of Benjamin West, commissioned Wilkie to paint a pendant which was to be <span class="italic">Blind Man's Buff</span> (1813; Royal Collection). In 1811 Bird showed <span class="italic">The Reading of the Will Concluded</span> (City Museum and Art Gallery, Bristol), which has much sensitive observation of human nature. He was elected an associate of the academy the following year and a full member in 1815 only six years after his first appearance. It was in 1815 that he exhibited <span class="italic">The Departure to London</span> (ex Christies, South Kensington, 9 March 2000, lot 259), a moving and charming account of a young man's farewell to his family which is full of the incidental detail of a modest country home. More strongly coloured and subtly, if self-consciously, composed than many of his paintings, it shows that Bird's earlier debt to seventeenth-century Dutch interior scenes had been succeeded by a quotation from Jean-Baptiste Greuze (1725&#150;1805).<br>
<br>Bird's own ambitions and the circle of sophisticated amateurs that gathered around him encouraged him to attempt more elevated scenes, higher in the hierarchy of genres. The Revd John Eagles was to admit his part:<blockquote>his best scenes were those of the simple, honest dealings and ways of more humble and common life, where there was some sentiment, some moral good, &hellip; never man loved innocence for its own sake more than he. That he left this style, and attempted the grand and scriptural, was much to be regretted &hellip; And I will not refuse to take myself my portion of the blame; for I did constantly instigate him to the attempts. (Eagles, 138)</blockquote>Both Eagles and his father, who corresponded with Sir Walter Scott concerning appropriate costume for the scene, were involved with <span class="italic">Chevy Chase</span>, shown at the British Institution in 1812 and purchased by the marquess of Stafford for 300 guineas. Bird was appointed historical painter to Princess Charlotte in 1813 when he also won the annual premium of 300 guineas at the British Institution for <span class="italic">The Death of Eli</span>. Other substantial historical and religious scenes followed, culminating in an ambitious project, initiated in 1814, to paint the restoration of the Bourbon monarchy. Both <span class="italic">The Embarkation of Louis XVIII at Dover</span> (City Museum and Art Gallery, Bristol) and <span class="italic">The Landing of Louis XVIII at Calais</span> (Wolverhampton Art Gallery) were over-crowded with portraits, which demanded frequent and often unrewarding journeys to London.<br>
<br>Bird was already plagued with ill health and in 1818 he was unable to believe in the prince regent's endlessly delayed decision not to acquire <span class="italic">The Embarkation</span>. The earl of Bridgewater, who had already purchased <span class="italic">The Landing</span> for 1000 guineas, could only acquire it after Bird's death on 2 November 1819. Bird had been too ill to paint throughout the year and left his wife and three surviving children heavily in debt. His friends and patrons and the Royal Academy responded promptly, contrary to the inaccurate account in <span class="italic">Lives of the British Artists</span> by Allan Cunningham, whom Eagles justly called a &#145;careless slanderer&#146;  (Revd J. Eagles to Richard Smith, 6 March 1830, Bristol Reference Library, SR50 B28436). A grand funeral was held and 300 persons are said to have followed the hearse from Bird's home at 8 Kings Parade to Bristol Cathedral, where he was buried in the cloister at the foot of the steps into the transept.<br>
<br>The following year a large and financially successful exhibition of Bird's work was held at the Bristol Fire Office, the first substantial retrospective exhibition to be devoted to a single artist outside London. Within Bristol Edward Villiers Rippingille (1798&#150;1859), Rolinda Sharples (1793&#150;1838), Samuel Colman (1780&#150;1845), and William West (1801&#150;1861) were all to be directly influenced by Bird's genre paintings. His importance to Bristol was broader still. His friend Dr John King (1766&#150;1846), whose portrait Bird painted (City Museum and Art Gallery, Bristol), recalled in 1839:<blockquote>about 40 years ago the late Edw. Bird was the only artist of talent in this city. It was here that his genius developed with rapid strides; his society soon became the centre of attraction to all those who had enough of good taste &hellip; Thus was spontaneously framed a small society of art-loving friends, from which all that Bristol can now boast of artists and amateurs has descended.
