<span class="headword">Westwood,  Thomas</span>  (1814&#150;1888), <span class="occ">poet and bibliographer of angling</span>, was born on 26 November 1814 at Westwood Cottage, The Chase, Enfield, and was baptized at St Andrew's, Enfield, on 1 January 1815, the youngest son of Thomas Westwood of Enfield and his wife, Mary. Westwood senior was an unusual character with a hump and reportedly stood 4 feet and &#145;a nail high&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works of Charles and Mary Lamb</span>, 833). He was vividly described by Charles Lamb in several letters to William Wordsworth between 1829 and 1830. The Lambs moved in next door to the Westwoods' cottage in September 1827, when Thomas Westwood senior was employed as an agent of the Phoenix Insurance Company. In October 1829 the Lambs were forced to give up their house and became lodgers with the Westwoods. This arrangement lasted until May 1833. Originally complimentary of Westwood senior's company and manners Lamb soon began to tire of his &#145;one anecdote&#146;  (ibid.) and miserly behaviour.<br>
<br>As a youth Thomas Westwood made the acquaintance of Lamb and was deeply impressed by his illustrious neighbour, becoming a regular visitor, though he was not yet thirteen. Not surprisingly he was a shy youth and was somewhat in awe of Lamb but Lamb warmed to him and granted the teenager free access to his library, even flinging presentation copies over the fence into the Westwoods' garden for Thomas to pick up. Mary Lamb also influenced the youngster, teaching him Latin and giving him a taste for popular fiction. Many years later in <span class="italic">Notes and Queries</span> Westwood contributed an interesting and personal article on Lamb giving a generous appraisal of his talents, stating that he was &#145;a seventeenth-century man mislaid&#146;  (<span class="italic">N&amp;Q</span>, 3rd ser., 10, 222).<br>
<br>Westwood became acquainted with and was greatly influenced by Izaak Walton through reading Lamb's copy of the <span class="italic">Compleat Angler</span>. Reading Hawkins's 1760 edition Westwood regarded it, in biblical allegory, as &#145;my chief treasure, pearl of price&#146;  (Lucas, 727).<br>
<br>With the introduction to many of Lamb's literary friends, including the regular visits of William Wordsworth&#151;whom Westwood senior disliked for taking too much sugar in his tea&#151;Westwood developed an interest in writing. A small volume entitled <span class="italic">Poems</span> was published in 1840. Critical reviews were favourable, and the reviewer for <span class="italic">The Athenaeum</span> in 1841 commented that Westwood had &#145;a poetical eye, a poetical heart, and a musical ear&#146;. In 1842 he began a literary correspondence with Elizabeth Barrett Browning that continued until 1854. He also published <span class="italic">Beads from a Rosary</span> (1843) and <span class="italic">Burden of the Bell and other Lyrics</span> (1850), after many of the poems had appeared in the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span>. His most ambitious work is <span class="italic">The Quest of Sancgreall</span> (1868). Westwood produced many poems and published a number of collections but was conscious that they lacked something. In a humorous sonnet entitled &#145;Small Poets&#146; he wrote &#145;Oh for a wizard's sleight to turn this swarm of mites into one mighty!&#146;. However, W. S. Landor remarked that he would have liked to have written Westwood's &#145;Love in the Alpuxaras&#146;.<br>
<br>After working for Lamb's friend Ader the merchant in 1844, Westwood was posted to Belgium, where he became the Brussels director and secretary of the Tournai and Jurbise Railway. Most of his later life was spent in west Flanders. He married, about 1855, a Belgian woman, Rosa. Here he continued with his interest in angling, building up an impressive library on the subject (now partly in the New York Public Library). In 1861 he published, through <span class="italic">The Field</span> office, <span class="italic">A new bibliotheca piscatoria, or, General catalogue of angling and fishing literature, with bibliographical notes and data</span>. Westwood became the acknowledged authority on the subject and three years later issued his <span class="italic">Chronicle of the Compleat Angler</span>. This book was an elaborate bibliography of Izaak Walton's work and was later printed as a supplement to Marston's 1888 edition of <span class="italic">The Compleat Angler</span>, with a new preface.<br>
<br>The <span class="italic">Bibliotheca piscatoria: a Catalogue of Books on Angling, the Fisheries and Fish-Culture</span> (1883) was a supplement to Westwood's <i>magnum opus</i> of 1861 but was practically rewritten. With the collaboration of Thomas Satchell, Westwood produced a handsome quarto edition containing well over 5000 separate entries. In the same year, with his own expert introduction to accompany it, Westwood reprinted John Denny's 1613 <span class="italic">The Secrets of Angling</span>. <span class="italic">Twelve Sonnets and an Epilogue (in Memoriam I. Walton)</span> appeared in 1884. Westwood died at boulevard Waterloo, Brussels, Belgium, on 13 March 1888. His widow contributed an introductory memoir to an edition of his letters to Florence, Lady Alwyne Compton.<br>
