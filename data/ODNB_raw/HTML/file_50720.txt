<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Luard,  (David) Evan Trant</span>  (1926&#150;1991), <span class="occ">politician and writer on international affairs</span>, was born on 31 October 1926 at Park Cottage, Addington, Kent. He was the third child and second son of Colonel Trant Bramston Luard (1873&#150;1976) of the Royal Marines, and his wife, Helen Anne Frances (1893&#150;1981), <i>n&eacute;e</i> Evans. His father served in many countries and was awarded the DSO for service in the Middle East in the First World War; after his retirement he published a number of philosophical articles, in the <span class="italic">Hibbert Journal</span> and elsewhere. Luard grew up in Kent, and from 1934 in Cambridgeshire. In 1934&#150;40 he attended (not as a chorister) King's College choir school, Cambridge, and in 1940&#150;45 Felsted School, which had been evacuated from Essex to near Ross-on-Wye, Herefordshire. Towards the end of the Second World War, while still at school, he volunteered for the Fleet Air Arm, serving in it for a few days before the war ended, when his services were no longer needed. He arranged to take up, in 1946, a scholarship he had been awarded at King's College, Cambridge. In the meantime he worked at Miller's music shop in Cambridge, and learned to play the piano, remaining an enthusiastic pianist thereafter. In 1947 he achieved a first in part one in modern languages (doing French and German). He then switched to music, doing another part one examination in 1949, in which he got a disappointing third. Passing two part one examinations allowed the candidate to graduate with an ordinary BA, that is a pass degree, without honours. An active sportsman, he was president of the King's College Athletics Club in 1948&#150;9.<br>
<br>When he left Cambridge in 1949, Luard expected to do national service&#151;only to be told that his three days' service in 1945 sufficed. He applied to the Foreign Office, but had to wait a year before he could take an entry examination. In the meantime, to broaden his outlook, he worked in a factory in Shepherd's Bush, London. In October 1950 he entered the foreign service, learned Chinese in London and Hong Kong, and was then posted to Beijing (Peking), from September 1952 to August 1954. During the Suez crisis he was serving in London. On 5 November 1956, when the Anglo-French military action against Egypt was running into heavy criticism inside the Foreign Office as well as at the United Nations and elsewhere, he submitted a letter of resignation, stating<blockquote>I belong to a generation which was brought up in the belief that for one nation to undertake the use of armed force against another in order to promote its own interests is morally wrong. I grew up during a war which, I understood, was fought for the establishment of that principle. When I joined the Foreign Service I was conscious that this country was a member of the United Nations and had entered into a solemn undertaking to act in accordance with the Charter of that Organisation. &hellip; Here it is a question of an action of the Government that I serve which in my eyes seems to have betrayed everything for which I had believed that this country stood &hellip; (Luard to Henniker-Major, 5 Nov 1956)</blockquote>Luard was one of a very few members of the diplomatic service who resigned over Suez. Others were persuaded not to do so by, among others, Anthony Nutting, the junior minister at the Foreign Office whose own resignation was announced on 3 November.<br>
<br>Having left the foreign service at the age of thirty, Luard turned to research and writing on international relations. In 1957 he was appointed to a research fellowship at St Antony's College, Oxford. He was to retain an association with the college, and to live in Oxford, for the rest of his life. His research on China was funded for two years by the Eastern Metals and Mining Company, and then by a grant from the Leverhulme Trust for a book, <span class="italic">Britain and China</span> (1962). St Antony's was not always able to find funding for him thereafter, but it provided accommodation for him until 1980, when he bought his own small terraced house nearby in Observatory Street. He did occasional teaching at Oxford, mainly in the earlier years, but never held a university post. It was at Oxford that he wrote his books, embarked on a political career first on the city council (1958&#150;61) and then in parliament, and performed many services for Oxfam (for which he worked from 1980 to 1983).<br>
<br>In 1966&#150;70 and 1974&#150;9 Luard served as the first (and, as it transpired, only) Labour MP for the Oxford constituency, subsequently dissolved in boundary revisions. Characteristically active and conscientious as an MP, at the same time he continued writing and took on other responsibilities. He was a member of the UK delegation to the UN general assembly in 1967 and 1968; and in 1975 he was appointed by the UN secretary-general to the ad hoc committee on the restructuring of the economic and social sectors of the UN system. In violation of the unwritten rule that ministers should be lay figures unburdened by professional expertise, he had two spells (from October 1969 to June 1970 and from April 1976 to May 1979) as under-secretary of state at the Foreign Office. In this situation, where irritation or offence might easily have been caused&#151;both on account of his knowledge, and on account of his earlier resignation&#151;he earned the affection and respect of both the diplomats and the ministers with whom he worked. David Owen, foreign secretary from February 1977 to May 1979, later wrote:<blockquote>He was an unassuming, quiet person but of firm determination and tenacious will &hellip; I found Evan's specialised knowledge immensely valuable when we both served together in the FCO. He brought to United Nations matters and all aspects of international law an attractive mix of enthusiasm and calculation. (<span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span>)</blockquote>Luard's political position, reflected in all his work, can be crudely summarized as right-wing Labour, but with an exceptionally strong admixture of belief in the centrality of moral principle, international organization, and overseas aid. In the early 1980s he joined the newly formed Social Democratic Party, which was at that time the party that most closely reflected his political philosophy. His last parliamentary campaign was fought unsuccessfully in June 1983 under its colours for the new Oxford West and Abingdon constituency.<br>
<br>Between 1959 and his death Luard wrote no fewer than eighteen books, co-authored one, and edited seven. Of these twenty-six books, five were reissued in revised editions. All these works, as well as numerous articles and pamphlets, were in the field of international relations broadly conceived. Following the concentration on China in the first two works, his <span class="italic">Peace and Opinion</span> (1962) staked out a number of themes which were to remain central to his world vision: man is more adaptable than other species, though not perhaps enough for the dangers he now faces; it is of limited use to set up systems of authority called states, if between them there is still murderous anarchy; nuclear weapons, horrific as they are, may have reduced the likelihood of war; general and complete disarmament is not going to be achieved; a more peaceful world must be sought by reforming the behaviour of states; and international society is slowly becoming more law-abiding. Of his subsequent works, <span class="italic">The Control of the Sea-Bed</span> (1974; rev. 1977) was a notably well-timed call for international regulation of under-sea resources, appearing as it did early in the negotiations (1973&#150;82) which led to the adoption of the UN convention on the law of the sea. One book sold particularly well: the comparatively short <span class="italic">The United Nations: How it Works and What it Does</span> (1979). Luard also embarked on a multi-volume <span class="italic">History of the United Nations</span>, and by the time of his death had published the first two volumes (1982, 1989), covering the years 1945&#150;65.<br>
<br>In his substantial writings Luard did not claim to be an academic historian working on original documents. He was not a discoverer of new facts, or an inventor of new theories. He covered a vast canvas, the world; and a huge time span, centuries past, present, and future. He often wrote prescriptively, especially in calling for redistribution between richer and poorer countries. In the age of the specialist it was impossible to do these things without risking criticism. Yet his works had solid merits. He was knowledgeable on all the subjects he tackled. Eschewing rhetoric, he wrote elegantly and clearly. He was less interested in addressing topical issues of the day, whether Vietnam or nuclear weapons deployments, than deeper and longer-term questions. His books tackled subjects&#151;including human rights and the internationalization of civil wars&#151;which were often neglected during the cold war, but which later proved to be of enduring importance. The fact that certain themes were repeated was a reflection of his moral concern about them. Above all, he sought to make sense of the times through which he lived. Towards the end of his life the crumbling of communist regimes and the growing role of the UN suggested that his cautious belief in progress was not misplaced.<br>
<br>A slim, wiry figure of medium height, Luard's manner was unassuming. His performance at public meetings, including political ones, was judicious, reasonable, and understated. Generous with his time in helping others, he combined friendliness, charm, and clarity of mind. He lived unostentatiously in Oxford, often on a modest income. The disciplined austerity of his life was tempered by a love of gardening as well as of the piano. He never married, but had many friends. Although he cut down on public speaking when (about five years before his death) he lost his larynx, he worked hard to recover a natural articulation, and was proud that he could still give the occasional talk. He died of lung cancer on 8 February 1991 at his sister's home, 1 St Mary's Grove, Putney, London, and was cremated at Mortlake crematorium. A memorial meeting was held at St Antony's College, Oxford, on 1 June 1991.<br>
