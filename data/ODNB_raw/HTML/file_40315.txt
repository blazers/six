<span class="headword">Sutherland,  Robert Garioch</span> <span class="st"> [<em>pseud. </em>Robert Garioch]</span>  (1909&#150;1981), <span class="occ">poet and translator</span>, was born on 9 May 1909 at 109 Bellevue Road, Edinburgh, the son of Robert Garioch Sutherland, a house painter, and his wife, Catherine (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Mathewson), a music teacher. He attended Edinburgh high school and then Edinburgh University (1927&#150;31). On 26 January 1942 he married Margaret Lillie (1914/15&#150;<i>c</i>.1979), a schoolteacher, in Edinburgh. They had at least one child, Ian. Conscripted in 1941, Sutherland served in the north African campaign with the Royal Signals, and was a prisoner of war in Italy and Germany from 1942 to 1945. Between 1946 and his retirement in 1964 he was a schoolteacher, first in London and Kent (until 1959) and thereafter in Edinburgh. With fellow poet Edwin Morgan he served as literary adviser to the cultural review <span class="italic">Scottish International</span> (1968&#150;74). From 1971 to 1973 he was writer in residence at the University of Edinburgh, and was also employed as a &#145;lexicographer's orraman [odd-job man]&#146;  (Royle, 305)&#151;his own description&#151;on the <span class="italic">Dictionary of the Older Scottish Tongue</span>. He was a popular performer of his own poetry&#151;written mainly in Scots&#151;and participated in the readings circuit right up to his final months.<br>
<br>Sutherland based his idiom on the speech of his native city, but augmented his working vocabulary from his constant study of Scots language and literature; a particular mentor was the major poet Robert Fergusson (1750&#150;1774), tragic in his life, comic (even caustic) in his work. In such poems as &#145;In Princes Street Gairdens&#146; and &#145;A Wee Local Scandal&#146; Sutherland deployed the reductive possibilities of Scots to puncture the pretensions of city councillors, academics, political dogmatists, and their like. Together with an often deadpan satirical wit, his adoption of the faux-na&iuml;f &#145;wee man&#146; persona accounts for much of his popularity.<br>
<br>Sutherland found a kindred spirit in the nineteenth-century Italian poet Giuseppe Belli, who wrote scurrilous sonnets in the working-class dialect of Rome. In his Scots versions of Belli, always preserving the strict sonnet form, Sutherland was able to transpose this mockery of church and state to the Edinburgh streets. Indeed, it is in his consummate craftsmanship as a poet (&#145;makar&#146;&#151;&#145;maker&#146; in Scots) that it can be discovered where his sympathies lie&#151;with the skilled tradesman and his unassuming, necessary, but increasingly redundant labours. In &#145;Perfect&#146; Sutherland adopted the persona of a french polisher, drily lamenting how his craftsmanly standards are giving way to mass production.<br>
<br>Sutherland's most ambitious poetic projects were his 1959 translations from Latin into Scots of two tragedies, <span class="italic">Jephthah</span> and <span class="italic">The Baptist</span>, by the great Scottish humanist George Buchanan (1506&#150;1582). Although he valued these translations above everything else he had attempted, they remain neglected in spite of their organ-voiced sonorities:<blockquote>
<div>I come frae the Thunderer's throne in Hevin,<br>
</div>
<div>his airborne herald, til Israel's hame<br>
</div>
<div>promised to Jacob's seed as the centre o pouer &hellip;<br>
</div> (<span class="italic">&#145;Jephthah&#146; and &#145;The Baptist&#146;</span>, 1959)</blockquote>
<span class="italic">The Masque of Edinburgh</span> (1954) and <span class="italic">The Laird o Dreepdaily</span> (1983) are worthy of note as his two other forays into verse drama in Scots.<br>
<br>Buchanan also served as a sounding board for Sutherland's complaints against the realities of the teaching profession, and the disillusionment of the would-be writer and new university graduate who is forced to teach for a living:<blockquote>
<div>A kep and goun&#151;what dae they maitter?<br>
</div>
<div>a kep and bells wad suit him better.<br>
</div> (<span class="italic">Complete Poetical Works</span>, 1983)</blockquote>In a letter to a fellow makar J. K. Annand, Garioch simultaneously offers a <i>cri de coeur</i> and administers a gentle dig at the Scottish obsession with &#145;doubles&#146;, the Jekyll-and-Hyde co-existence of opposing qualities:<blockquote>But it is an awful strain, this Deacon Brodie sort of life, Sutherland by day and Garioch by night, school-mastering and making poetry being such different things, and yet both tiring you out in the same way, that's the damn thing about it.</blockquote>(Deacon Brodie was an eighteenth-century figure who alternated between the roles of respectable citizen and elusive burglar.)<br>
<br>Sutherland's friends and fellow poets Hamish Henderson and Sorley MacLean were also veterans of north Africa. Sutherland typically eschewed the elegiac sweep of their war poetry in favour of a hard-headed prose account of his experiences as a prisoner of war. <span class="italic">Two Men and a Blanket</span> (1975), his only venture into sustained autobiography, records without self-pity or heroics the boring, basic level of existence in captivity. Prisoner-of-war camp was its own way of life:<blockquote>Where we had all started off equal, we began to have relatively rich and poor. The most successful businessman would run a gambling outfit of some kind and would combine this with their knowledge of the market to live pretty well. At the other end of the scale, somebody must have been going short, but nobody was going to worry about him. (Garioch, <span class="italic">Two Men and a Blanket</span>, 51)</blockquote>Such mordant commentary does not mean that Sutherland was a confirmed misanthrope. During his writer's residency at Edinburgh University he gained a reputation for going out of his way to help aspiring poets, even advising them on where to place their work. He gave space to younger and little-known poets in his 1974 anthology, <span class="italic">Made in Scotland</span>. Towards the end of his life he expressed warm sympathy with the aims of the fledgeling Scottish Poetry Library Association. Sadly he did not live to see the library as an up-and-running reality.<br>
<br>Sutherland was much more than an &#145;Edinburgh&#146; poet, but it is likely that his home-based work will continue to be his most read. In harking back to his childhood he does not allow his wit to give way to sentimentality. His &#145;Fi'baw in the Street&#146; concerns any group of boys whose game is interrupted by the polis (police). The mellower &#145;Lesson&#146; evokes the changes, both during and before Sutherland's lifetime, to the character of Edinburgh's port of Leith. Returning to the docks after many years, the poet is nostalgic but realistic; Leith is not better or worse, it is just different.<br>
<br>Sutherland died on 26 April 1981 at the Western General Hospital in Edinburgh. He had been predeceased by his wife, and was survived by at least one son, Ian.<br>
