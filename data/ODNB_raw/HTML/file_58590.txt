<span class="headword">Fraser,  Catherine</span>  (1786&#150;1868), <span class="occ">penal reformer</span>, was born on 26 June 1786 at the High Street, Wapping, the only surviving child of James Fraser (1749&#150;1825), merchant, and his wife, Ann, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Thatcher. James Fraser had premises in Wapping and later became a biscuit baker. In August 1794 Ann died and James remarried, having another eight children. Not long after moving his family to North Terrace, Camberwell (1823), James Fraser died, on 11 September 1825, leaving trust funds for all his children to finance good education and comfortable lifestyles. Catherine Fraser and her half-sisters, Harriet and Elizabeth, remained spinsters and continued to live in North Terrace.<br>
<br>On 19 March 1832 Catherine Fraser joined Elizabeth Fry's British Ladies Society for promoting the reformation of female prisoners, although she was not a Quaker, but a member of the Church of England. By September of that year she was an active member; a frequent visitor to Newgate prison, she was appointed with three other women to confer with Robert Fowler on the ignorant and neglected state of female prisoners awaiting trial in Newgate. In 1834 she was appointed, with four others, to visit all the convict ships and to distribute useful articles, including sewing materials and reading matter, to the women prisoners. Later that year she was asked to visit Tothill Fields prison as well as Newgate. From 16 September 1838 until October 1854 she kept a diary of her prison visiting.<br>
<br>In 1836 a prison inspectors' report argued that the lady visitors were well-meaning but easily exploited and inclined to regard themselves as being in charge of the women's side of Newgate prison. Catherine Fraser was part of the subcommittee called to look at several material points which had been raised. The British Ladies took the report seriously and tried very hard to remedy the situation so they could continue visiting the prison. Newgate was never lost to them, but from then on Elizabeth Fry transferred her attentions to crusades abroad, especially in France.<br>
<br>After Elizabeth Fry's death in 1845 Catherine Fraser became one of the most prominent members of the British Ladies Society. Her main interest was in the convict ships, which she continued to visit until transportation was abolished in the 1850s. Subsequently she became a member of her local emigration society and was keen to help any of the convicts emigrate after their sentences. She also visited several women who were sentenced to death, the most notorious being Maria Manning, who with her husband, Frederick Manning, was convicted of, and executed for, the murder of Patrick O'Connor in 1849.<br>
<br>After her diaries end in October 1854 it is known that Catherine Fraser continued her work with the British Ladies, encouraging her half-sister Elizabeth to join the society. By October 1856 one side of Newgate had been closed to female prisoners so Catherine Fraser began to visit Millbank prison. In 1857 she brought up the subject of individual patronage to discharged prisoners, as Sir Joshua Jebb, surveyor-general of convict-prisons, and Lady Jebb had brought it to her attention that not enough was being done to assist women with employment or accommodation on their discharge from prison. In 1859, at the age of seventy-two, Catherine Fraser was still visiting Newgate, and in 1861 she was appointed to visit Horsemonger Lane prison. By December 1867 she had ceased the monthly meetings of the British Ladies, although they were still in contact with her, relying on her expertise.<br>
<br>Catherine Fraser died at her home, 6 North Terrace, Camberwell, London, on 3 December 1868, following a stroke. She asked for her remains to be placed in the family vault in St Giles, Camberwell. At their meeting on 21 December the British Ladies Society recorded her passing, praising her &#145;indefatigable labours of love&#146; and &#145;her ready pen, her clear head, her good judgement and her Christian piety&#146;  (British Ladies Society meeting minutes, 21 Dec 1868).<br>
