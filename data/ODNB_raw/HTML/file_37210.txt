<span class="headword">Bourne,  John</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1620, <em>d.</em> 1667), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, was baptized on 14 November 1620 at St John-at-Wapping, the younger son of Robert Bourne (<i>d</i>. 1625), shipwright, who owned a dockyard at Wapping, and his wife, Mary (<i>d</i>. 1630). His elder brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/3007/', "Nehemiah Bourne")</script> emigrated to New England in 1638, and John may have followed him there. During the 1640s he commanded ships on trading voyages to Massachusetts in association with his brother, who had returned home in 1643.<br>
<br>Parliament drew Nehemiah into naval service in 1650, and John accompanied him. He served in the hired ship <i>Merchant</i> in the North Sea squadron under his brother in the summer of 1650, and commanded the newly built <i>Assistance</i> (thirty-six guns) from the autumn of that year. Bourne served throughout the first Anglo-Dutch War, and fought in the Kentish Knock in December 1652. He was rear-admiral in the squadron of William Penn at the battle off Portland in February 1653; the <i>Assistance</i> was boarded by the enemy, and Bourne was wounded in the head with a poleaxe in the course of fierce hand-to-hand fighting. Though still suffering from his wounds, he was persuaded by General Richard Deane, his patron, to return quickly to sea as flag captain to him and George Monck in the <i>Resolution</i>. He took part in the major actions off the Gabbard in June and the Texel in July.<br>
<br>During the winter of 1653&#150;4 Bourne served in the channel, and in July 1654 he was named to the <i>Essex</i> as commander of a squadron to Newfoundland. The <i>Essex</i> lost her mainmast in a storm on the outward voyage and was forced to return, and Bourne thereupon resumed his service in the channel. Early in 1656 he was appointed rear-admiral of the fleet being sent against Spain under generals Robert Blake and Edward Mountagu (later first earl of Sandwich), and took part in the long blockade of Cadiz. When news arrived early in 1657 that a Spanish plate fleet was on its way to the Canaries, Bourne (now vice-admiral) and Richard Stayner, the new rear-admiral, pressed Blake to intercept it. He took part in the ensuing operation at Santa Cruz in April, in which the entire plate fleet was destroyed. He returned to England with Blake later in the year, and was one of the witnesses to the dying admiral's will.<br>
<br>Bourne served as rear-admiral in the <i>Swiftsure</i> in 1658 in the channel, and again in 1659 in the <i>Richard</i>, commanding the Home Fleet with Mountagu and Lawson away in the sound. Though he was willing to serve under the protectorate, his loyalties were essentially republican, and he welcomed the restoration of the Rump Parliament early in 1659. As Mountagu was a known Cromwellian, the support of Bourne, commanding in the Downs, was of considerable political significance. The <i>Richard</i> was paid off in October 1659, however, and was to prove Bourne's last naval command. When the army ousted the Rump in October 1659 he and a group of other naval officers then ashore wrote to Monck in Scotland, urging him to accept the coup, arguing that divisions would only play into the hands of the cavaliers. The Rump, probably resentful, did not employ him again when it was reinstalled in December, and Mountagu had no wish to recall him. Bourne therefore played no part in the Restoration, returning instead to his earlier career in maritime trade. He became an elder brother of Trinity House in March 1660. He was away at sea for much of the following year, but took the oaths of allegiance and supremacy on 8 June 1661, when he was back in London. There is no record of any further political involvement, and he was often away thereafter, on voyages to the Mediterranean and North America.<br>
<br>As a puritan, Bourne had devoted himself to God's cause, as he saw it. When a storm disabled his ship in 1654 he was dismayed by the thought that God might have judged him unworthy to be an instrument. In 1655 he responded to news of the persecution of the Waldenses by arranging a day of fasting in the Channel Fleet and a collection for the victims.<br>
<br>Bourne died in 1667, probably in July or August and probably in his home parish, St Mary Magdalene, Bermondsey; a successor was elected to his place at Trinity House on 4 September. In a will drawn up two years earlier he bequeathed his estate in Bermondsey to his wife, Mary, and their two sons, Robert and John.<br>
