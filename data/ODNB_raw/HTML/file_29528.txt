<span class="headword">Williams,  Joshua</span>  (1813&#150;1881), <span class="occ">legal writer</span>, was born at Kensington, London, on 23 May 1813, the fifth son and seventh child of Thomas Williams (1773&#150;1852) of Cote, Bampton, Oxfordshire, and Cowley Grove, Middlesex, and his wife, Violetta, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Williams said to be a remote descendant of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29492/', "Sir David Williams (1550&#150;1613)")</script>, judge. He was educated at a private school, and afterwards at University College, London (then London University). He was admitted as a student of Lincoln's Inn on 31 January 1833. After practising for three years under the bar as a certificated conveyancer, he was called to the bar on 4 May 1838. In 1845 he published his <span class="italic">Principles of the Law of Real Property</span> (which first appeared as <span class="italic">Williams on Conveyancing</span>), a work which reached a twenty-fourth edition in 1926. This was followed in 1848 by his <span class="italic">Principles of the Law of Personal Property</span>, of which the fourteenth edition appeared in 1894.<br>
<br>The publication of these books brought Williams an extensive practice as a conveyancer and real property lawyer, and in March 1862 he was appointed by Lord Chancellor Westbury one of the four conveyancing counsel to the court of chancery. His health suffered from the strain of increasing work. He was made QC on 30 March 1865, and on 20 April 1865 was elected a bencher of Lincoln's Inn. As a QC he was especially noted for cases defending rights of common, in Epping Forest, Plumstead Common, Berkhamsted, Wimbledon, and elsewhere.<br>
<br>In 1875 Williams was appointed professor of the law of real and personal property to the inns of court by the Council of Legal Education. He was annually re-elected to this office until his resignation in 1880. Among his publications were a series of lectures on property law, an edition of a contemporary text on succession, and a text on law reform. He died at his home, 49 Queensborough Terrace, London, on 25 October 1881. He married four times: first, to Lucy, daughter of William Strange, of Upton, Essex; second, to Elvira Anna, daughter of Pownoll Phipps of Oaklands, Tipperary; third, to Martha, daughter of the Revd Cyprian Thompson; and fourth, to Mary Webb of Hereford. His son with his third wife, Thomas Cyprian Williams, was a barrister and edited many editions of his father's works.<br>
<br>Exceptionally tall, at 6 feet 4&frac12; inches, Williams was one of the most popular barristers of his day.<br>
