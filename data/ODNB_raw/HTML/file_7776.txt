<span class="headword">Dolben,  John</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1662, <em>d.</em> 1710), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was baptized in Christ Church Cathedral, Oxford, on 1 July 1662. He was the younger son in the family of two sons and one daughter (who died in infancy) of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7775/', "John Dolben (1625&#150;1686)")</script>, canon of Christ Church, Oxford, later archbishop of York, and his wife, Catherine (1626&#150;1706), daughter of Ralph Sheldon of Stanton, Derbyshire, and niece of Gilbert Sheldon, archbishop of Canterbury from 1663 to 1677. Dolben's elder brother was Sir Gilbert Dolben, judge of the court of common pleas in Ireland. John Dolben matriculated from Christ Church, Oxford, on 23 March 1678, but his name does not appear in the printed list of graduates.<br>
<br>Dolben entered the Inner Temple, and was called to the bar in 1684, but having gambled away most of the money inherited from his father in 1686, he went to the West Indies, where he married Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1736), daughter of Tanfield Mulso, of Finedon, Northamptonshire. They had two sons and three daughters.<br>
<br>Dolben came back to England, and was returned to parliament at a by-election on 21 November 1707 as MP for the borough of Liskeard in Cornwall. In the House of Commons he worked hard as chairman of several committees until, in 1709, Godolphin put him in charge of the case against Dr Henry Sacheverell, who had preached two inflammatory sermons in Derby and in St Paul's Cathedral, directed against Godolphin and the government. On 13 December 1709 Dolben called the attention of the house to these sermons, with the result that the house decided to impeach Sacheverell in the House of Lords. The articles of impeachment against Sacheverell, drawn up by a committee of the House of Commons, were reported to the house by Dolben on 10 January 1710, and two days later he took the articles to the House of Lords. Although he was one of the managers of the impeachment, he was prevented by ill health from attending Sacheverell's trial. He died in Epsom on 29 May 1710, the day of the trial; he was buried in Finedon church.<br>
<br>Dolben's involvement in the case was the subject of several pamphlets, including <span class="italic">A Letter Written by Mr. J. Dolbin to Dr. Henry Sacheverell</span> (1710), composed as a letter of repentance, <span class="italic">An Elegy on the Lamented Death of John Dolben</span> (1710), and <span class="italic">The Life and Adventures of John Dolben</span> (1710). Verses were written about him, including the epitaph:<blockquote>
<div>Under this marble lies the dust<br>
</div>
<div>Of Dolben John, the chaste and just.<br>
</div>
<div>Reader, read softly, I beseech ye,<br>
</div>
<div>For if he wakes he'll straight impeach ye.<br>
</div> (Wilkins, 2.84)</blockquote>
