<span class="headword">Brock,  John</span>  (1834&#150;1916), <span class="occ">chemical manufacturer</span>, was born on 25 August 1834 in Manchester, the younger of two children of William Brock of Nantwich, Cheshire. He was educated privately and later sent to Chorlton Hall School. Brock's career started with Crosfield and Shanks, chemical manufacturers, in St Helens, where after ten years he had risen to be manager. He left this firm in 1867, to enter into partnership with Edward Sullivan, James Sievwright, and John Crossley. On 1 September 1867 the partnership (Sullivan &amp; Co.) acquired a 24 acre site. The British Alkali Works, or Brock's Works as it became known, with Brock as managing partner, was soon erected. It was the last sizeable chemical concern established in the canal region of Widnes, and its main product was soda ash from the Leblanc cycle. In conjunction with the works manager, Brock devised several improvements for the manufacture of bleaching powder.<br>
<br>Brock married twice, both marriages being childless. His first wife was Elizabeth Wilson (1835&#150;1877); his second was Sarah Mowle (1855&#150;1929), whom he married after the death of Elizabeth. In 1875&#150;6 Brock gave evidence to a royal commission investigating the working of the 1863 and 1874 <span class="roman">Alkali Acts</span>. He was appointed a justice of the peace for Lancashire in 1881. His greatest influence came in 1883 when he was instrumental in establishing the Lancashire Bleaching Powder Manufacturers' Association. Under Brock's chairmanship this organization unsuccessfully attempted to regulate the market in bleaching powder by establishing quotas for its members and a fixed price for the sale of their products, and by intervening directly in the market to maintain that fixed price.<br>
<br>Problems within the Leblanc industry were patently clear by the end of the 1880s, and Brock strongly supported calls made by Sullivan for a closer union of the alkali manufacturers and more defensive measures to protect the Leblanc manufacturers from competitors using the more efficient Solvay process. Brock was influential in the brief negotiations that led to the formation of the United Alkali Company (UAC), which was the first industrial amalgamation of its kind, save perhaps the Salt Union formed in 1888. The UAC was incorporated in February 1891 with Brock as chairman, and pioneering rationalization brought brief initial success. Profits peaked in 1892 and thereafter declined rapidly, due in part to American tariff barriers. The UAC fought back by establishing a factory in Michigan (1897) which was run by the North American Chemical Company, of which Brock was president, but this venture failed to improve the fortunes of the company. He retired as chairman of the UAC in 1913. Thirteen years later the company was amalgamated with three others to form Imperial Chemical Industries. Brock was also vice-chairman of the Power and Gas Corporation Ltd (established 1901) and a director of Holywell&#150;Halkyn Mining and Tunnel Company Ltd.<br>
<br>Brock was a man of few words and fixed opinions, a strict but effective disciplinarian, handsome in appearance, dignified, and always well groomed. He retired to Colwyn Bay, moving to The Cedars, Hoole Road, Hoole, Chester, eighteen months before his death on 20 February 1916, which followed a short illness. His funeral was on 24 February at All Saints' Church, Hoole, followed by his interment at Christ Church, Colwyn Bay. Brock's sole beneficiary was his wife, Sarah.<br>
