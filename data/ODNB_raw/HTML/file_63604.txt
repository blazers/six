<span class="headword">Watt,  Robert</span>  (1761<span class="mult">x</span>8&#150;1794), <span class="occ">wine merchant and conspirator</span>, was the illegitimate son of a &#145;respectable gentleman&#146;, and was brought up by a succession of guardians. He was educated at the Perth Academy, and moved about 1785 to Edinburgh to seek his fortune. Following a period as a clerk, and a failed attempt to forge a literary career, Watt settled on the wine trade as his source of income. It was probably the failure of his hopes for this business which led him to offer his services as a political informer in April 1792 to the lord advocate, Robert Dundas. July 1792 saw the establishment in Edinburgh of the first society of the Friends of the People in Scotland.<br>
<br>Watt's motives for informing appear to have been principally financial. His reports concerned radical activities not just in the capital but in Perth, Dundee, and Glasgow. Written in a small, spidery hand, they tended to the alarmism typical of opportunist informers of this period. In the spring of 1793 Watt offered Dundas information from two unnamed individuals who supposedly wanted payment of at least &pound;100. Watt was reimbursed the sum of &pound;30, which he claimed he had given to his sources. No helpful information was forthcoming, and from the late summer of 1793 contact between Watt and the authorities in Edinburgh lapsed.<br>
<br>Watt resurfaced in the following year as one of two men&#151;the other was David Downie, an Edinburgh goldsmith&#151;prosecuted for high treason for involvement in a murky plot to seize Edinburgh Castle, the post office, and banks, raise the manufacturing districts in Scotland, and establish a provisional government in Edinburgh. Watt appears to have been the main architect of the plan; in fact, it probably fully existed only in his imagination. He was one of seven individuals who comprised the permanent secret Committee of Ways and Means, formed in March 1794, following the suppression of the famous convention of British radicals in Edinburgh in the previous December and the subsequent crackdown on radical activities, from delegates of the remaining radical societies in Edinburgh and the neighbourhood. The plot had come to light only because of an unconnected search of Watt's house on 15 May for property belonging to a bankrupt. This unearthed a small number of pikes and the type for a handbill which was designed to suborn the loyalties of the soldiery. A subsequent search of a blacksmith's, a certain Orrock, produced further pikes.<br>
<br>The extent of support for the plot, as well as Watt's motivation&#151;and indeed the motivations and degree of understanding of others involved&#151;remain unclear. The period from late 1793 to early 1794 was one of ambiguity and confusion with respect to radical intentions as they struggled to formulate a response to government repression and the imposition of restraints on &#145;liberty&#146;. Watt's counsel at his trial claimed that he was acting as an unofficial <i>agent provocateur</i>, although Watt also declared in a confession composed when his execution was certain that he had become a convert to the radical cause through attendance at their meetings. At the trial, at which he pleaded not guilty, his fellow conspirators turned king's evidence, with the exception of Downie. Although Lord Braxfield, whose extreme hostility to the radicals had been manifest in earlier political trials, did not preside&#151;Watt was tried under a special commission of oyer and terminer under the terms of the 1709 <span class="roman">Treason Act</span>&#151;a guilty verdict was a foregone conclusion. The jury did, nevertheless, recommend mercy.<br>
<br>Downie was to receive a pardon; Watt was not so fortunate. His execution, on 15 October 1794, was used by the authorities to demonstrate the supposedly bloody and revolutionary intent of popular radicals and the heavy penalty to be paid for such activity. Watt was drawn, backwards, from the castle in Edinburgh to the Tolbooth, his place of execution, in a procession composed of the sheriff depute and his substitutes attired in black and wearing white gloves, constables, and 200 Argyllshire fencibles, all walking at a dead pace. At Watt's feet were placed several of the pikes found in his house. After being hanged for fifteen minutes, his body was cut down and beheaded, and the severed head presented to the reportedly silent crowd who witnessed his grisly end. One account of his life, published shortly after his execution, claimed that the roots of his misfortune and villainy were a secretive, unstable, and corrupt personality, which for much of his life he had struggled against, to no avail, through excessive religious devotion.<br>
<br>The trials of Watt and Downie have wider significance in that they foreshadowed the treason trials of leading English radicals in the same year in the emphasis which was placed by the authorities on the supposedly sinister intent of the plans for an emergency convention under discussion among British radicals in late 1793 and early 1794. The &#145;Watt plot&#146; also furnished a crucial element in the Pitt ministry's efforts, by means of two reports by a Commons committee of secrecy appointed in 1794, to demonstrate the supposed revolutionary goals of the radicals, goals which it was claimed had been deliberately disguised by the radicals' continual professions of a preference for parliamentary reform achieved through peaceful, constitutional means.<br>
