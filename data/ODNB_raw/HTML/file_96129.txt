<span class="headword">Gill,  (George) Michael</span>  (1923&#150;2005), <span class="occ">television producer</span>, was born on 10 December 1923 at a maternity home, The Firs, Weeke Hill, Winchester, Hampshire, the only child of (George) Arnold Gill, a bank cashier, and later manager with the Midland Bank, and his wife, Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Taylor. His mother's family were Yorkshire mill owners, and his father's mill workers. He was educated at Wootton Court preparatory school, Kent, and St Edmund's School, Canterbury. His childhood was blighted by tuberculosis, which forced him to spend most of five years on his back, and by bullying: he described his school years as &#145;the most unhappy of my life&#146;  (<span class="italic">Growing into War</span>, 46). Early ambitions to become a doctor were set aside when the outbreak of the Second World War prompted him to join the intelligence branch of the RAF. Having seen service in Holland and, at the end of the war, Germany, he returned to England, decided against a career in medicine, and went to Edinburgh University to read philosophy and psychology. There he met Yvonne Janette Gilan, an actress, and daughter of Louis Gabriel Gilan, dentist. They married at the (Episcopalian) church of St John the Evangelist, Edinburgh, on 21 January 1952, when she was twenty. They had two sons, Adrian and Nicholas.<br>
<br>In 1954, after a couple of years as a journalist on <span class="italic">The Scotsman</span>, Gill joined BBC radio, switching in 1958 to television to work in schools programmes, then on <span class="italic">Monitor</span>, the arts series edited by Huw Wheldon that trained a remarkable band of programme makers including Ken Russell, John Schlesinger, Melvyn Bragg, and Jonathan Miller. Gill brought in the writer, critic, and sociologist John Berger (who later made the seminal art series <span class="italic">Ways of Seeing</span>) as a presenter, and for five years the two of them rode around on Berger's motorcycle, arguing the toss and using the dialogue between writer and presenter to construct their programmes.<br>
<br>In 1967, with BBC2 about to launch colour television, the network controller David Attenborough decided that snooker and art were prime candidates to exploit the new technology, thinking that led to <span class="italic">Pot Black</span> (1969&#150;86) and <span class="italic">Civilisation</span> (1969). Attenborough asked Sir Kenneth Clark, the former director of the National Gallery and the author of several art books, to present the arts series, and Gill was chosen to produce and direct it. Although Gill began by distrusting Clark, the patrician aesthete, finding him &#145;glittering, self possessed, armed with precise certainties&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Independent</span>), the very antithesis of the attitudes adopted by Gill and Berger, in the end Gill and Clark achieved a remarkably successful working relationship, and Gill came to have a high regard for Clark's erudition and quiet passion. They ended up firm friends. It was not unusual for Gill to discover in this way qualities in an individual that clashed with his political or philosophical attitudes. Though he described himself as &#145;a doctrinaire socialist&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>) and distrusted the very idea of an aristocracy, he developed a great admiration for the queen when he produced <span class="italic">Royal Heritage</span> in 1976 to mark the silver jubilee.<br>
<br>The making of <span class="italic">Civilisation</span> proved to be an important milestone in television history. Clark had assumed that he would give studio lectures for which Gill would find suitable colour slides or clips of library film as illustrations, but Gill's ambitions went far beyond that. In the end Gill persuaded Clark to travel for two years all over Europe and beyond, to stand in front of paintings, sculptures, and buildings using a portable autocue to deliver terse but articulate descriptions and opinions which, with Gill's beautifully shot and edited sequences of pictures, conveyed a vivid impression of the history of western civilisation. Between them Gill and Clark had invented the authored documentary series, which became a staple first of BBC television in the 1970s and then of television everywhere in the 1980s and 1990s. <span class="italic">Civilisation</span> became a <i>succ&egrave;s d'estime</i> in Britain, eventually winning enormous prestige and worldwide sales for the corporation. Selling to America initially proved tricky, but when lunchtime screenings of the series with seats for 300 were arranged at Washington's National Gallery of Art 24,000 people turned up on the first day, including Jackie Onassis and half of President Nixon's cabinet.<br>
<br>Gill went on to work with the veteran radio broadcaster Alistair Cooke to make the thirteen-part series <span class="italic">America</span> (1972&#150;3), which some critics regarded as even better than <span class="italic">Civilisation</span>, while Adrian Malone produced <span class="italic">The Ascent of Man</span> (1973) for the BBC as a scientific counterpart to <span class="italic">Civilisation</span>, with Jacob Bronowski as presenter. Later Gill and Malone formed their own company to make programmes in the UK and the USA. After he left the BBC, Gill's series included <span class="italic">The Commanding Sea</span> (1981), on the history of seafaring, <span class="italic">Vintage: a History of Wine</span> (1991), <span class="italic">The Buried Mirror: Reflections on Spain and the New World</span> (1992), and <span class="italic">Highlanders</span> (1995), on the Scottish clans. His last series, in 1997, was <span class="italic">The Face of Russia</span>.<br>
<br>Gill's first marriage was dissolved and on 12 July 1978 he married Georgina Jane Denison, a publisher twenty-four years his junior, and daughter of Colonel William Maxwell Evelyn Denison, army officer. They had one daughter, Chloe. In his final years Gill wrote an account of his early life up to the end of the Second World War, <span class="italic">Growing into War</span> (2005). It reveals him as a quintessential example of one particular type of middle-class Englishman: the product of brutal private schools yet gentle, diffident, a lover of poetry and the English countryside. &#145;Only the look of the countryside, though&#146;, according to his son Adrian, &#145;not the reality. Picnics were okay but not nature red in tooth and claw or even vaguely pink. He was terrified of heifers&#146;  (private information). The last years of his life were clouded by the disappearance in 1998 of his son Nicholas, a Michelin-starred chef, and by Alzheimer's disease, diagnosed in 2000. He died at the Chelsea and Westminster Hospital, London, on 20 October 2005, of septicaemia and bronchopneumonia. He was survived by his wife, Georgina, their daughter Chloe, and his son Adrian, the journalist and author known as A. A. Gill.<br>
