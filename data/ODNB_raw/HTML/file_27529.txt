<span class="headword">Toms,  Peter</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1726, <em>d.</em> 1777), <span class="occ">painter and herald</span>, was baptized on 3 July 1726 at St Andrew, Holborn, London, the son of the engraver <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/50872/', "William Henry Toms (d. 1765)")</script> of Union Court, Holborn, and his wife, Rachael (<i>d. c</i>.1736). Toms's father took on several apprentices, including John Boydell, who later noted that he was &#145;a very passionate man &amp; committed many extravagances while his phrenzy lasted&#146;  (Farington, <span class="italic">Diary</span>, 4.1415). As a young man Peter Toms was apprenticed to the portrait painter Thomas Hudson, and in 1746 was appointed Portcullis pursuivant by the College of Arms. In November 1748 he appeared in a list of London's leading artists, being described by the <span class="italic">Universal Magazine</span> (vol. 2) as an &#145;eminent painter&#146;. Toms was by now presumably employed as a portraitist, although no works by him are known. From 1749 he worked in London as a specialist painter of costume in other artists' portraits (&#145;drapery painter&#146;), following the death that year of the leading practitioner Joseph van Aken. It has plausibly been suggested that he was the unnamed artist mentioned by Lord Bath as working for Thomas Hudson, Allan Ramsay, and Joshua Reynolds in 1761  (Hudson, 53). Ramsay was certainly employing him in 1754  (Smart, 62). It was at one time also claimed that Toms worked for Gainsborough, although this would appear unlikely  (Whitley, 2.279), especially as he was then based in Bath. From about 1755 Toms was employed as a drapery painter by Joshua Reynolds, for whom he worked until the early 1760s. In return for painting the draperies on a full-length portrait Toms received 15 guineas from Reynolds  (Farington, <span class="italic">Diary</span>, 4.3238). According to Edwards, although he does not say when, Toms's price for painting &#145;the draperies, hands, &amp;c.&#146; of a whole-length portrait was 20 guineas; for a small &#145;three-quarter&#146; length (30 &times; 25 in.), 3 guineas  (Edwards, 55). Among other works Toms has been credited with painting the draperies in Reynolds's <span class="italic">Lady Elizabeth Keppel</span> (1761&#150;2; priv. coll.) and <span class="italic">Master Thomas Lister</span> (<i>c</i>.1764&#150;5; Bradford City Art Galleries and Museum). In the opinion of Reynolds's pupil James Northcote, Toms was a very good drapery painter, although his painting method<blockquote>did not exactly harmonise with the style of Sir Joshua's heads, as it was heavy and wanted freedom, so that his work had too much the appearance of having been done with a stamp, as the paper-hangings for rooms are executed. (Northcote, 2.28)</blockquote>Their relationship was at times strained, as when Toms refused to replace the formal dress he had painted in a female portrait with the &#145;rural habit&#146; required by Reynolds, telling him, &#145;you ought to be more explicit when you give the picture into my hands&#146;  (ibid., 2.29). Toms was evidently eccentric, Boydell recalling how he &#145;would strip himself &amp; rub his body furiously from a notion that the circulation of the blood was stopping: at other times would lay in bed many days together believing himself to be much disordered&#146;  (Farington, <span class="italic">Diary</span>, 4.1415). About 1763 Toms travelled to Dublin with the earl of Northumberland, lord lieutenant of Ireland, in an attempt to revive his own portrait career. However, he returned shortly afterwards, working intensively from 1763, or possibly 1764, as a drapery painter for Francis Cotes. It was during this time that he presumably also worked for Benjamin West  (Edwards, 54). In 1768 Toms was elected a founder member of the Royal Academy, possibly because of his close professional relationship with Reynolds, Cotes, and West [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/94593', "Founders of the Royal Academy of Arts")</script>]. He exhibited three works there between 1769 and 1771, an &#145;allegorical picture&#146;, an unidentified portrait, and a painting of wild plants. At this time he was living in Wimpole Street, around the corner from Francis Cotes, who had a grand residence in Cavendish Square. In June 1769 Toms witnessed Cotes's will. The death of Cotes, the following summer, apparently affected Toms deeply; he became increasingly depressed and turned to drink for solace. In 1772 Toms offered to sell his position at the College of Arms for &pound;500, noting that he then earned between &pound;30 and &pound;40 per annum from the post, which he treated as a sinecure, plus &pound;15 from the rental of his college apartments  (Wagner, 409). In the event he retained the post until his death. Some time during the 1770s, while intoxicated, Toms attempted to commit suicide by cutting his throat. He survived for several years, dying on new year's day 1777 at his lodgings in Rathbone Place. His studio materials, prints, and drawings were auctioned by Gerrard later the same month. It is not known whether he married, although he was survived by a daughter, who was eighteen years old at his death  (Whitley, 1.279).<br>
