<span class="headword">Manley,  Thomas</span>  (<em>c.</em>1628&#150;1676), <span class="occ">legal and political writer</span>, was the son of Thomas Manley (<i>d</i>. 1656) of Westminster, clerk of the kitchen in the household of Charles I, and his wife, Cassandra Button (<i>d</i>. 1633), daughter of Henry Lyde, and can probably be identified with the author of certain juvenilia published about 1650, in which case he was born about 1628. He may have been the Thomas Manley baptized at St Margaret's, Westminster, on 8 November 1627. Thomas Manley senior was at Oxford with the court and may have been responsible for an account of the king's travels called <span class="italic">Iter Carolinum</span>, published in 1660. He was fined &pound;250 for his delinquency, but paid less than half the sum and placed the rest of his estate in trust for his daughter. Thomas junior, who had displeased his father by marrying without his permission, received only a small monetary bequest. By 1656 he and his wife, Anne, had a son and a daughter.<br>
<br>Manley was admitted a student of the Middle Temple on 6 February 1655, and on 25 May following was appointed librarian of the society. So unsatisfactory was he in the post, however, that the library doors were padlocked against him and he was eventually dismissed in June 1658. Despite this he was called to the bar at the Middle Temple on 24 January 1673 without having to perform the usual formalities and ceremonies, in accordance with letters from the king dated 18 September 1672. This has been misinterpreted as an appointment as king's counsel (and Manley accordingly appears as such in library catalogues), but there is no evidence that he ever took silk.<br>
<br>Manley's first legal work was <span class="italic">The Sollicitor</span> (2nd edn, 1663), a handbook stated in the title to be based on the experience of twelve years' practice. In 1670 he brought out an abridgement of Coke's reports, volumes 12 and 13, as a supplement to the work of Edward Trotman who had abridged the earlier volumes. Then in 1672 he produced both an annotated book of forms entitled <span class="italic">The Clerk's Guide</span>, and a revised and updated edition of John Cowell's well-known law dictionary, the <span class="italic">Interpreter of Words and Terms</span> of 1607. His additions were not numerous or substantial, largely consisting of a few lines at the end of the longer entries. Cowell's controversial essays on titles such as &#145;king&#146; and &#145;royal prerogative&#146; were cut down, while other, more technical entries were criticized by Thomas Blount in <span class="italic">World of Errors</span> (1673). A second &#145;corrected&#146; edition appeared after Manley's death in 1684. His name remains, with his preface, in the 1701 revision by White Kennet, but disappears in later editions of Cowell although all continue to include his material. In 1676 Manley produced an appendix to the seventh edition of Thomas Wentworth's <span class="italic">Office and Duty of Executors</span>; this reappeared with later editions of the same work.<br>
<br>Contemporaneously with these legal works, Manley published several books of a political character. The first was a translation of Grotius's <span class="italic">De rebus Belgicis</span>, published as <span class="italic">Annals and History of the Low-Country-Warrs</span> in 1665, with a subtitle claiming that the book illustrates the extent of the Dutch debt to English valour. In two later pamphlets (<span class="italic">Usury at Six per cent</span>, 1669, directed against Sir Thomas Culpepper, and <span class="italic">A Discourse Shewing that the Export of Wooll is Destructive</span>, 1676) he aired isolationist views of economics that were clearly political and social in inspiration. Less certainly his is an earlier work, <span class="italic">A Short View of the Lives of &hellip; Henry, Duke of Gloucester, and Mary Princess of Orange</span> (1660); the author is identified only as T. M., esq.<br>
<br>Manley apparently died soon after writing his appendix to Wentworth, for Middle Temple records disclose the payment of &pound;5 to the widow of T. Manley on 24 November 1676. This means that the book usually identified as his last work, <span class="italic">The Present State of Europe Briefly Examined and Found Languishing</span>, published in 1689, must have been seen through the press by someone other than the author. A note prefaced to this polemical tract, which advocates immediate war against France to save Europe from the despotic designs of Louis XIV, states that it was written in 1671, on the occasion of a parliamentary vote of &pound;800,000 to equip a fleet.<br>
<br>It seems likely, though it cannot be proved, that the legal and political writer described above was the Thomas Manley junior responsible for three rather earlier and rather different works. The first, <span class="italic">Temporis angustiae: Stollen Houres Recreations</span>, a collection of almost unreadable adolescent <i>pens&eacute;es</i>, is dated 1649, the author being in his twenty-first year at the time of writing. In 1651 there appeared the same author's <span class="italic">Affliction and Deliverance of the Saints</span>, a verse paraphrase of the book of <span class="roman">Job</span>, the preface of which is dated at Westminster. A manuscript of this work survives in Cambridge University Library. The following year saw his translation of Payne Fisher's <span class="italic">Veni, vidi, vici</span>, a Latin poem in honour of Cromwell, with in addition an elegy by himself on Ireton, the regicide, and verses in Manley's own honour by Samuel Sheppard. By this time Manley's father was attempting to make amends with the Commonwealth authorities, so his son's encomiastic offerings would not be unexpected; certainly no more so than the verses by Sheppard, himself chiefly known for royalist sympathies.<br>
