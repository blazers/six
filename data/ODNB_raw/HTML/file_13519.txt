<span class="headword">Holland,  George Calvert</span>  (1801&#150;1865), <span class="occ">physician</span>, was born at Pitsmoor, Sheffield, on 28 February 1801, the second son of a respectable artisan who arranged for him to have a &#145;fair&#146; elementary education. Originally intended for a trade he was apprenticed to a wig maker at the age of twelve. At sixteen he discovered an ability to write verse and contributed several poems to the <span class="italic">Sheffield and Rotherham Independent</span>, a local journal. As a result he developed a desire to educate himself. He read the classics and taught himself Latin, French, and Italian.<br>
<br>When Holland was twenty his ability was recognized by his elder brother and others, and he was placed under the tutelage of a Unitarian minister in Derby to study for the ministry of that church. However, after a year he turned to medicine and went to study in Edinburgh. A brilliant student, he graduated MD in 1827. He also studied for a year under R. T. H. La&euml;nnec in Paris and took the degree of bachelor of letters. Holland went into practice in Manchester but after a year his enthusiasm for phrenology, possibly spurred by the examination of heads undertaken during his time as a wig maker, led to friction with his colleagues. He returned to Edinburgh where he undertook a year's research. It appears that it was at this time that he became president of the Royal Physical Society and of the Hunterian Society of Edinburgh. In 1828 he published <span class="italic">An Essay on Education, Founded on Phrenological Principles</span>, which was followed in 1829 by <span class="italic">An Experimental Inquiry into the Laws of Life</span>. In 1830 he returned to Sheffield and began to play an important part in the life of the town.<br>
<br>Holland next opened a dispensary for the poor, with Dr C. F. Flavell. He became lecturer in physiology and jurisprudence at the Sheffield Medical Institute but resigned the post in 1843. He also lectured regularly on phrenology and was enthusiastic about the revived science of mesmerism. In 1832 he was elected physician to the General Infirmary. In addition he became a member of the council of the Literary and Philosophical Society and lectured in aid of the formation of a mechanics' institute. He founded the Sheffield Physiological Society in 1837.<br>
<br>The next years were the most important of Holland's medical career. His <span class="italic">Inquiry into the Moral, Social and Intellectual Condition of the Industrious Classes of Sheffield</span> (1839) was followed by the publication in 1843 of his greatest work, <span class="italic">The Vital Statistics of Sheffield</span>, which won him recognition as a pioneer of industrial medicine. That same year saw the publication of the important but neglected <span class="italic">Diseases of the Lungs</span>, in which Holland described silicosis and silico-tuberculosis, and their cause by the silica dust raised in dry grinding. He described a system of dust extraction, which he correctly believed would prevent it.<br>
<br>Holland had a very successful practice but gave up medicine almost completely as he became increasingly involved in politics. Surprisingly, being a Liberal, he defended the corn laws, publishing <span class="italic">An Exposition of Corn-Law Repealing Fallacies and Inconsistencies</span> (1840) and <span class="italic">Suggestions towards Improving the Present System of Corn-Laws</span> (1841). This brought him a purse of 500 guineas from his new friends, but his actions probably cost him ten times that amount. He became a director of several railway companies at a time when there was a mania for such projects. He also became a director of the Leeds and West Riding Bank and the Sheffield and Retford Bank. Their failure led to his ruin. A writ against him for &pound;54,000 resulted in his bankruptcy and he retired to Worksop until his affairs were settled. Here in 1848 Holland wrote what he regarded as his best work, <span class="italic">The Philosophy of Animated Nature</span>.<br>
<br>After an unsuccessful effort to establish himself in London, Holland returned to Sheffield in 1851. By this time he had been converted to homoeopathy, which destroyed his previously high reputation with the medical profession. He edited the <span class="italic">Sheffield Homoeopathic Lancet</span> in 1853. He was elected a member of the town council but lost his seat in 1858, as did all members of his party, due to their advocacy of the highly unpopular <span class="roman">Local Improvement Act</span>. However, in 1862 he was made alderman of the borough.<br>
<br>Holland was described as a man of courtly figure with full grey eyes and a thin intellectual face. A man of kindness and courtesy, his popularity was such that a public subscription was raised for him during his last illness, though at the time he was probably moderately well-to-do. He developed bronchitis, which according to his obituary &#145;supervened upon disease of the base of the brain brought on by close study and severe mental exertion&#146;  (<span class="italic">Sheffield and Rotherham Independent</span>, 8 March 1865). He died in Broomhall Lodge, Broomhall Road, Sheffield, on 7 March 1865 and was buried on 13 March at Sheffield general cemetery. He was survived by his wife, Anne Martha, and a son and a daughter. In 1873, his wife having died, a petition was finally accepted for his daughter to receive a pension from the queen's bounty, in recognition of her father's work for industrial medicine.<br>
