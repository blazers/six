<span class="headword">Robinson,  Frederick Arthur  Cayley</span>  (1862&#150;1927), <span class="occ">painter and book illustrator</span>, was born on 18 August 1862 at Brentford-on-Thames, Middlesex, the son of Frederic Robinson, an engineer. Educated at Dr Head's school in Cliftonville and at the Lyc&eacute;e de Pau in France, by 1883 he was studying at the St John's Wood School of Art, London, and from 1885 to 1888 at the Royal Academy Schools. By 1888 he was exhibiting at the Royal Society of British Artists in the fashionable impressionistic style of the Newlyn school. From 1889 to 1891 he plied the coasts of Britain in a sailing-boat. Scenes of boats, departures to sea, and coastlines symbolizing the transition from a pastoral present to a distant unknown persist throughout his <i>&#339;uvre</i>.<br>
<br>For most of 1891 until 1894 Cayley Robinson was studying at the Acad&eacute;mie Julian in Paris under academicians such as Bouguereau. European symbolism, the rise of the Nabis, and the lingering influence of Burne-Jones led him to alter his style drastically to a visionary neo-medievalism, apparent in such oil paintings as <span class="italic">In a Wood so Green</span> (Leamington Spa Art Gallery and Museum) and <span class="italic">The Close of the Day</span> (Art Gallery of South Australia, Adelaide). By 1896 he was sufficiently established as an artist to warrant A. S. Baldry writing an article on him, &#145;An original painter&#146;, in the <span class="italic">Magazine of Art</span>. On 6 December 1898 he married the painter Winifred Lucy Dalley (<i>b</i>. 1860/61), daughter of John Lambert Dalley, a stockbroker; they had one daughter. In that year he also became a member of the Royal Society of British Artists. In 1894 he had begun to exhibit spasmodically at the Royal Academy, finally becoming an ARA in 1921. Other memberships followed: the Institute of Oil Painters in 1906, the New English Art Club in 1912, and the Royal Society of Painters in Water Colours in 1919. By 1901 the influence of a three-year <i>s&eacute;jour</i> in Florence, during which he studied both the old masters and the technique of painting in tempera, resulted in the discovery of classicism. Masterpieces such as <span class="italic">The Depth of Winter</span> (priv. coll.) and the various versions of <span class="italic">The Winter Evening</span> (1906 version, Galleria Nazionale d'Arte Moderna, Rome) followed. The chosen images are of beautiful young women assembled in domestic surroundings around a table or desk. The figures are lost in contemplation and lit by a pale winter light emanating from a closed window, itself an exit to an unknown outside world. The paintings convey a stillness redolent with melancholy, a recurring mood in his work which combines with an allusive symbolism stemming from Puvis de Chavannes and the Belgian symbolists. After the birth of his daughter the shy and reclusive Cayley Robinson turned his brush to the painting of childhood; his paintings dwell on children in repose, often sleeping, when they are employed as images of innocence and the object of the love and care of attendant womenfolk. Examples include <span class="italic">The Word</span> (National Gallery of Canada, Ottawa), <span class="italic">Childhood</span> (Walker Art Gallery, Liverpool), and <span class="italic">Pastoral</span> (Tate collection), all painted in the early 1920s. <span class="italic">The Call of the Sea</span> and <span class="italic">The Farewell</span> focus on the poignancy of parting and the loss of childhood.<br>
<br>In 1904, the year in which Cayley Robinson became a founder member of the Society of Painters in Tempera, he held his first one-man show at the Baillie Gallery in London, followed by another in 1908 at the Carfax Gallery. In 1907 he painted his first stage sets for Gilbert Murray's translation of Euripides' <span class="italic">Medea</span>, but his triumph in this field of endeavour came with the Haymarket Theatre production in London of Maurice Maeterlinck's <span class="italic">The Blue Bird</span> in 1910. Stage design soon gave way to book illustration; his drawings, so full of fantasy, accompanied the 1911 edition of <span class="italic">The Blue Bird</span>, and the originals were then sold at the Leicester Galleries.<br>
<br>Cayley Robinson's depiction of the nude began with the title-drawing for <span class="italic">The Blue Bird</span>. This was followed by the first version of <span class="italic">Youth</span> (South African National Gallery, Cape Town), with a second version painted in 1923 (priv. coll.). However, the finest work in this genre is <span class="italic">The Death of Abel</span> (Mus&eacute;e d'Orsay, Paris), which depicts the naked figures of Cain and the dead Abel in the horrific moment after the fratricide&#151;the &#145;frozen moment&#146; held for eternity. This work was the source of an illustration for <span class="italic">The Book of Genesis</span>, published by the Riccardi Press in 1914; together with another masterpiece, <span class="italic">The Death of Rachel</span>, it constitutes his finest achievement as a book illustrator. Four further illustrated books followed.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">The Coming of St Patrick to Ireland, 430 <span class="smallcap">AD</span></span>, commissioned by Hugh Lane in 1914 for his Museum of Modern Art in Dublin, was the first of Cayley Robinson's murals. Earlier, in 1910 or 1911, the South African millionaire Sir Edmund Davis had commissioned four panels for the Middlesex Hospital in London on the themes of &#145;Orphans&#146; and &#145;The Doctor&#146;. The first <span class="italic">Orphan</span> was completed in 1915 and this brilliant ensemble far outshines his 1923 commission of a war memorial for Heanor grammar school (which later became the South East Derbyshire College). Both compositions are still <i>in situ</i>. In 1914, under Davis's patronage, Cayley Robinson moved with his family into 1 Lansdowne House, Lansdowne Road, Kensington, London, a custom-built studio apartment block inhabited solely by artists. In the same year he took up his only teaching professorship, at the Glasgow School of Art, which he held for ten years. After the First World War he executed lithographic posters for various railway companies.<br>
<br>Cayley Robinson died of influenza on 3 January 1927 in a nursing home at 1 Ladbroke Square, Kensington; he was survived by his wife. Subsequent retrospective exhibitions were held at the Leicester Galleries in 1929 and the Fine Art Society in 1977. <span class="italic">The Death of Abel</span> and <span class="italic">Youth</span> drew attention when shown at the &#145;Symbolism in Britain, 1860&#150;1910&#146; exhibition at the Tate Gallery in 1997.<br>
