<span class="headword">Sinclair,  John</span>  (<em>c.</em>1510&#150;1566), <span class="occ">lawyer and jurist</span>, was the fourth son of Sir Oliver Sinclair of Roslin (<i>d</i>. 1513) and Isabella Livingstone, his wife. He was a younger brother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25621/', "Henry Sinclair (1507/8&#150;1565)")</script>, bishop of Ross: &#145;Sik tua honest and cunning letterit men as thir wes will be seindill or rather never seen to come of ane hous and familie of this realme&#146;  (Thomson, 98). He is probably identifiable with the person of the same name who graduated at St Andrews in 1527, and was certainly at the University of Paris, where he graduated in arts in 1531 and was proctor of the German nation the following year. He returned to Scotland, and was incorporated at St Andrews as licentiate in civil law in 1537. He lectured in canon law at King's College, Aberdeen, holding the parsonage of Snow (St Mary <i>ad nives</i>), the prebend of the canonist, as well as the vicarage of Alford.<br>
<br>Sinclair was admitted as a senator of the college of justice and ordinary lord of session on 23 April 1540, but retained his Aberdeen prebend until 1542, when he was presented by James V to the deanery of the collegiate church of Restalrig. Despite resigning the benefice in the curia in favour of James Lauder in April 1547, he retained possession of it for the rest of his life. He began to preach at Restalrig in 1558 when, according to John Knox, many thought him &#145;not far from the Kingdom of God&#146;, but, as the friars and other Catholics began to whisper against him, not only &#145;gainsaid he the doctrine of justification and of prayer which before he had taught, but also he set up and maintained the Papistry to the utmost prick&#146;  (<span class="italic">Knox's History</span>, 1.131). Knox includes him among those instigating the French to send an army against the Scottish protestants, who in December 1560 ordered the kirk of Restalrig to be cast down as a monument of idolatry.<br>
<br>Depositions sent to Rome in 1565 in support of his becoming a bishop declared that Sinclair had suffered for his defence of the Catholic church, had been impoverished by the heretics, and obliged to flee to France. There he resumed his connection with the University of Paris, acquiring a doctorate in civil and canon law. Although granted a safe conduct to pass through England in September 1564, he remained in France until after his brother's death on 1 or 2 January 1565, when he took back to Scotland the materials which Henry had gathered for a continuation of Boece's history. He officiated at the marriage of Mary and Darnley at Holyrood on 29 July 1565 and was nominated by the queen to the bishopric of Brechin. Although he received papal provision on 7 September 1565, it is doubtful whether he was ever consecrated. Having resumed his judicial duties on 10 April 1565, he sat as president of the college of justice in succession to his brother from November onwards. He died at the house of James Mosman in Forrester's Wynd, Edinburgh, on 9 April 1566, following an attack of fever. Knox, who dismissed him as &#145;blind of one eye in the body but of both in his soul&#146;, nevertheless acknowledged that he and Henry were &#145;learned in the laws&#146;  (<span class="italic">Knox's History</span>, 1.112&#150;13, 2.185).<br>
<br>Another contemporary noted Sinclair's &#145;singulare intelligence had in theologie, and in lykwis the laws&#146;  (Thomson, 98). Authorship of &#145;Sinclair's Practicks&#146; is attributed by some manuscripts to Henry Sinclair but internal evidence points strongly towards John. The earliest collection of decisions of the court of session (1540&#150;49), it is written in an idiosyncratic mixture of Scots and Latin, with some personal comments by the author. His main concern is the relationship between Scots law and the <i>jus commune</i>, for which he draws upon a wide range of civilian and canonist authorities. The work is said to resemble similar contemporary European collections. The text survives in a number of defective late sixteenth- and seventeenth-century copies but remains unpublished.<br>
