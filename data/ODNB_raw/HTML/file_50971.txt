<span class="headword">Cook,  Robert Percival</span>  (1906&#150;1989), <span class="occ">biochemist</span>, was born on 14 April 1906 in Melbourne, Australia, the fourth in the family of three sons and two daughters of Francis Percival Cook (1867&#150;1933), stationer and printer, and his wife, Alice May Margaret, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Robertson (1870&#150;1950). His grandfather John Cook had emigrated to Australia from Appledore, Devon. He was educated at Trinity grammar school (1912&#150;14) and then (1914&#150;22) at Scotch College, Melbourne, which, in his words, &#145;gave a good didactic education in the old Scots tradition&#146;. During studies for his BSc (1925) at the University of Melbourne his interest in biochemistry was encouraged by William J. Young, who with A. Harden had discovered the important role of phosphates in alcoholic fermentation.<br>
<br>In April 1926, Cook travelled to London to work with A. J. Clark in the department of pharmacology at University College. Three months' work resulted in his first published paper, in the <span class="italic">Journal of Physiology</span>&#151;a token of future productivity. In the same year he enrolled at Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, and gained his PhD in 1930 for work on bacterial metabolism; he was also a member of the renowned research school led by Sir Frederick Gowland Hopkins. In 1928&#150;9 Cook spent six months' study leave at the Pasteur Institute in Paris, where he met Milada Anastasia Novakova (<i>b</i>. 1903/4). They were married in Cambridge on 8 November 1929, and had two sons and one daughter. Robert and Milada published a translation of Claude Bernard's <span class="italic">Le&ccedil;ons sur les ph&eacute;nom&egrave;nes de la vie: communs aux animaux et v&eacute;g&eacute;taux</span>. The award of a Beit memorial fellowship supported Cook's further research, including collaboration with J. B. S. Haldane, which demonstrated the multiplicity of oxygenases concerned in bacterial cell respiration. Between 1932 and 1935 Cook was engaged in the citric acid industry, returning to Cambridge, again as a Beit fellow, in 1935.<br>
<br>With characteristic enterprise, Cook began medical studies in 1938, qualifying as MB, BChir (Cambridge) in 1943. In 1940 he was appointed lecturer in biochemistry in the physiology department, University College, Dundee. His expertise was utilized in wartime studies of topics such as the nutritional value of school meals. In 1942, he was awarded a DSc by the University of Melbourne. Much of his subsequent career was enthusiastically dedicated to research and teaching in biochemistry. After years of determined effort, in 1965 he achieved designation of the biochemistry laboratories as a separate department, and when the University of Dundee came into being, a chair of biochemistry was inaugurated (1967). Cook, who had been a senior lecturer since 1945, recommended that a younger biochemist should be appointed. He was given a personal chair (1971), and retired as emeritus professor in 1973. He had been elected fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1946.<br>
<br>Cook's most influential and wide-ranging scientific contributions were concerned with the biochemistry and metabolism of cholesterol. A series of papers initiated in 1938, entitled &#145;Cholesterol metabolism&#146;, explored the effects of dietary cholesterol on tissues and organs of various animals. Metabolites of cholesterol were also isolated and analysed. These extensive studies indicated, for example, marked differences in the susceptibility of rats and rabbits to high levels of cholesterol: the rabbits readily developed the severe lesions of the aortal intima (that is, inner wall) that constitute atheroma&#151;broadly, the result of deposits such as fats, cholesterol, and calcified matter. Atheroma is a significant factor in human heart disease, and Cook's work helped to stimulate the subsequent expansion of research in this field. He skilfully applied chromatographic techniques to the analysis of sterols that are minor constituents of commercial cholesterol (from wool wax). The possible participation of such &#145;companions&#146; of cholesterol in atheroma was also being investigated by the distinguished chemist Louis Fieser, in whose Harvard laboratory Cook spent a fruitful period in 1952. Publication of the book <span class="italic">Cholesterol</span> in 1958 established Cook's international reputation. In addition to devising and editing the work, with chapters by world authorities, he was the author of several chapters. The book has retained its unique value: the massive proliferation of research now precludes the compilation of a comparable survey in a single volume. Great attention is now devoted to the role of &#145;minor&#146; sterols, present at low levels but potentially of high potency, both in physiology, and in the pathology of human arterial disease.<br>
<br>Cook's tall, animated figure and attractively outgoing character&#151;warm, humorous, knowledgeable, and strongly opinionated&#151;enlivened many scientific meetings. He was active in the Biochemical Society, the Scottish Society for Experimental Medicine, and the Nutrition Society. Cook died at Dundee on 26 August 1989, and was survived by his wife.<br>
