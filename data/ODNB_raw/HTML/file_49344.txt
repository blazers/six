<span class="headword">Young,  James</span>  (1810&#150;1891), <span class="occ">railway contractor</span>, was born on 10 February 1810 at Littlemill, near Kilmacolm, Renfrewshire, Scotland, the son of James Young, farmer and local contractor, and his wife, Margaret Glover. He had at least one brother. He was educated at the parish school, and then worked as an overseer on the building of the Glasgow and Garnkirk Railway, the first major railway contract in Scotland. He returned home to run his father's contracting business, which concentrated on road mending and dyke building. In 1836 he married Janet, daughter of Archibald Bulloch, coalmaster, of Glasgow. They had five sons and five daughters. In 1854 he won his first important contract, to build the Calderbank section of the Monklands Railway. For some years he was in partnership with Robert Ward, and their work included sections of the Caledonian, Milngavie, and Wemyss Bay railways.<br>
<br>In the mid-1870s Young formed two family businesses, in partnership with his brother and his eldest son: they were James Young &amp; Sons, a coalmining and lime-quarrying business, which managed a mine at Baljaffray, Duntocher, and a contracting firm, James Young &amp; Co. The latter built the western section of the Greenock and Ayrshire Railway, which ran underneath the town to the harbour. This was followed by contracts to build sections of the Glasgow, Bothwell, Hamilton, and Coatbridge Railway in 1875: Young dealt with the problem of cutting through heavy boulder clay in the Bellshill section by using a steam excavator based on an American machine, the first to be used in railway construction in the United Kingdom, thus saving on time and labour costs. Other important contracts included work on the Yoker and Clydebank Railway in 1881, and the St Andrews and Anstruther Railway. In 1882 he successfully tendered to build the western section of the first underground railway to be built in Glasgow, the Glasgow City and District Railway, running west&#150;east across the city. Although Young's contract was for a section of only just over a mile, he had to solve the technical problem of how to tunnel through sand without disturbing the existing buildings. This contract earned the firm over &pound;200,000.<br>
<br>Young retired in 1886, and moved to the sea, to Dunholme, Skelmorlie, Ayrshire. His eldest son took over the management of the business, which continued to win major railway contracts, including one for the Glasgow Central Railway, but the firm was wound up within twenty years. James Young died on 18 June 1891 at Skelmorlie, and was buried at the Glasgow necropolis.<br>
