<span class="headword">May,  John</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1598), <span class="occ">bishop of Carlisle</span>, was allegedly a native of Suffolk. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18425/', "William May")</script>, who died in 1560 as archbishop-elect of York, is commonly described as John's elder brother, but in the light of his bequest of divinity books &#145;to Mr John Meye my nephew&#146;  (Searle, 293) seems more likely to have been his uncle. John May was educated at Cambridge, matriculating in 1544 at Queens' College, where he was a scholar from 1545 until 1550, when he graduated BA. He subsequently proceeded MA in 1553, BTh in 1560, and DTh in 1564. Elected a fellow of Queens' in 1550, he was college bursar in 1554&#150;5. He is also recorded as staging plays in the college, where in the late 1550s he was accused of being overfond of cards and dice. That he remained in Cambridge during Mary's reign does not seem to have been held against him afterwards, for in 1559 he was appointed master of St Catharine's College. He was remembered there a century later as a model of prudence and integrity, probably thanks to his efforts to improve the management of the college finances. He was vice-chancellor of the university in 1569&#150;70, a time of great theological controversy in Cambridge. His firm stand against Thomas Cartwright earned him the wrath of the godly, but doubtless stood him in good stead with their opponents, led by John Whitgift.<br>
<br>May was ordained deacon and priest in the diocese of Norwich in 1557. Shortly afterwards he became rector of Aston Sandford, Buckinghamshire, adding the rectories of Long Stanton St Michael, Cambridgeshire, in 1560, North Creake, Norfolk, in 1562, and St Dunstan-in-the-East, London, in 1565. At an unknown date he became a prebendary in Ely Cathedral. In 1565 he preached at court on 22 March and at Paul's Cross on 26 August; notes taken from the latter address suggest a lucid and effective preacher, proclaiming a straightforward scriptural divinity&#151;&#145;the gospel oure certen salvation&#146;  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Tanner 50, 33). In 1569 he became archdeacon of the East Riding in the diocese of York on the queen's presentation, and in 1570 rector of Darfield in the West Riding. There is no evidence for his being active in Yorkshire, however; rather he appears to have continued to reside in Cambridge.<br>
<br>Elevation to the episcopate came in 1577. Following the death of James Pilkington of Durham on 23 January 1576, Richard Barnes of Carlisle was moved east across the Pennines, and May was promoted to replace him. His patron in this was George Talbot, sixth earl of Shrewsbury, who lobbied the earls of Leicester and Sussex on May's behalf. The queen's <i>cong&eacute; d'&eacute;lire</i> was granted on 17 May 1577, he was formally elected by the Carlisle chapter on 12 June 1577, the royal assent was given on 9 August, and he was consecrated at Fulham by the bishop of London on 29 September. Enthroned by proxy in his cathedral on 2 January 1578, he resigned his Cambridge mastership.<br>
<br>May was not personally rich. He was allowed five years to pay his first fruits, estimated at &pound;478 2<i>s</i>. 5&frac34;<i>d</i>., but his hopes of having them remitted altogether were disappointed, and they helped to create a burden of debt and financial anxiety which dogged his entire episcopate. The diocese was poor, and, when he arrived in it, afflicted by famine, so that he faced great demands on his charity&#151;in May 1578 he told Walsingham of &#145;the extraordinary charge he has been at by the miserable and lamentable scarcity in this country&#146;  (<span class="italic">Salisbury MSS</span>, 2.179). He seems to have made some effort to exploit his episcopal estates, for instance by raising entry fines. He also held his Ely prebend until 1582, his Yorkshire archdeaconry until 1588, and Darfield rectory until he died; these helped to keep him afloat financially, but always in low water.<br>
<br>May involved himself in local government as convention required, as JP and member of the council of the north, and sometimes worked with the warden of the west march to keep the peace on the borders. Occasionally he received news of Scottish affairs which he passed on to Shrewsbury. He seems to have been a conscientious bishop who resided at his episcopal residence of Rose Castle almost without interruption; occasionally recorded at York or Durham, he never attended parliament. His primary visitation of his chapter was conducted with notable thoroughness, and he dealt effectively with routine matters like dilapidated buildings and disputes over stalls in parish churches. His greatest problem, the low quality of the resident ministry, arose from the poverty of his see, its distance from centres of learning, and the great size of many of the parishes, which were often subdivided into poorly endowed chapelries. In 1580 May himself granted parochial rights to the chapel of Matterdale in Greystoke parish. His successor, Henry Robinson, criticized &#145;the great facility of my predecessor in committing the charge of souls to such as were presented by those who care not how silly the clerk be, so themselves may enjoy the fat of the living&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1598&#150;1601</i>, 362&#150;3). The charge of carelessness seems to have been less than fair. Although graduate ministers remained a minority, and would long do so, the number of university-trained incumbents (including some from the bishop's own former college of St Catharine's) certainly increased during May's episcopate, and their distribution was not limited to the wealthier livings.<br>
<br>May waged a continuous campaign against recusancy. He was examining die-hard Catholics early in 1584, while in 1590 he revived the constableship of Rose Castle and employed its holder to pursue seminaries. A year later he is recorded as examining the Douai-trained priest James Clayton, who subsequently died in prison under sentence of death. Early in 1597 it was May himself who feared death. About to set out to arrest another seminary, Christopher Robinson, he completed his will on 5 March in terms giving vivid expression to his fears&#151;<blockquote>purposing tomorrow &hellip; to take a journey to Johnbie with god's favour there to apprehend a notorious Jesuite or seminarie lodged there as I am crediblie advertised and fearing that thorough the malicious dealing of such traitors I maie be wounded to death or slaine by a gunne unles by god's mightie providence I shalbe defended. (Borth. Inst., reg. 31, fol. 136<i>v</i>)</blockquote>Robinson was captured and executed, after rejecting May's efforts to convert him to protestantism. The number of reported recusants in his diocese was always low, suggesting that the danger from Catholicism was less than May feared.<br>
<br>May's episcopate was not ended suddenly by gunshot but petered out in misery amid famine and pestilence. For four consecutive years (1594&#150;7) the harvest failed, and in 1597&#150;8 Carlisle diocese was also visited by plague. On 21 November 1597 Bishop Tobie Matthew of Durham wrote on May's behalf to Archbishop Whitgift telling of the distress caused by extreme dearth, exacerbated in the bishop's case by Scottish raids which robbed him of all his oxen and most of his sheep and horses; under such pressure &#145;the good olde fathers merrie hearte is quite kilde &amp; starke dead&#146; unless Whitgift helped him  (LPL, MS 3470, fol. 198<i>v</i>). No effective relief was forthcoming. None the less May toiled on despite failing health&#151;he was doing business in his bedchamber on 5 December 1597 and again on 4 February 1598. He died at Rose Castle at 8 a.m. on 15 February following, and was buried at 8 p.m. the same day in Carlisle Cathedral.<br>
<br>No monument to May survives, and it seems unlikely that one was commissioned. The inventory of his goods taken at Rose Castle immediately after his death suggests that he may not have been quite as impoverished as his will implies, but its record of mostly old and shabby clothes and furnishings hardly points to riches either. Probably about 1560 he married Amy, widow of John Cowel of Lancashire and daughter of William Vowel of North Creake, Norfolk; they had a son, John, and three daughters. His daughters were left &#145;an ould Edward&#146; apiece &#145;for a remembraunce&#146;, his wife his last new year's gift from the queen. His residuary legatee was his son, who seems to have inherited little but debts. His successor at Carlisle, Henry Robinson, found both Rose Castle and the diocese generally in a poor condition, but the extent of May's responsibility should not be exaggerated, some shortcomings notwithstanding. A stranger to his diocese, he was inclined to make up for his lack of local allies by advancing the interests of his son and sons-in-law. His epistolary style suggests a man overapt to stand on his dignity, a trait commented on (along with the bishop's small stature) by the litigant who referred to him as &#145;Litle divine providence&#146;  (TNA: PRO, E 134/10 JAS I/MICH 17 m6). But he was diligent and hospitable&#151;<i>vere hospitalis</i> according to Matthew&#151;and in a letter to Burghley of 1594 denied that he was ambitious for a wealthier diocese, describing himself as &#145;well content to end my dayes here, where (I thanke God) I have served with credyt these xvii yeres&#146;  (BL, Lansdowne MS 76, fol. 197<i>v</i>). His record suggests that the claim was not without substance.<br>
