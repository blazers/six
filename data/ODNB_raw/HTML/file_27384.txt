<span class="headword">Thorpe,  Thomas</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1461), <span class="occ">administrator and speaker of the House of Commons</span>, was of unknown parentage, but was almost certainly a native of Northamptonshire, where he later acquired the manor of Barnwell All Saints. He obtained employment in the exchequer, where by about 20 July 1437 he was a summoner. He probably owed his subsequent advancement to the patronage of the Beauforts, perhaps mediated through John Somerset, physician to the king and also chancellor of the exchequer, with whom Thorpe was associated in the grant of a wardship in 1443. On 4 February 1444 he became lord treasurer's remembrancer, at first during good behaviour, but on 16 September for life. On 8 January 1446 he was granted an annuity of 50 marks for life. Promotion brought riches, and Thorpe was able to buy estates at Great Ilford in Essex, and a house in the parish of St John Zachary in London. In 1448 he became a JP in Essex and Northamptonshire, and was appointed to an important commission to inquire into concealments of royal revenues in Middlesex. In October 1449 he was elected a knight of the shire for Northamptonshire, and a year later was MP for Ludgershall, Wiltshire.<br>
<br>His associations with government did not bring Thorpe popularity and good repute. In 1450 he was denounced by Kentish rebels as a supporter of the duke of Suffolk, and was nearly dislodged from his post in the exchequer by the new treasurer, Lord Tiptoft. But he held on, and on 2 December 1452 was made third baron. He was returned for Essex to the parliament that met at Reading on 6 March 1453, and on 8 March was elected speaker of the Commons. The first two sessions were easily managed on the government's behalf; a grant of taxation was made for the recovery of Gascony, and Thorpe was rewarded by the king with a gift of &pound;200. He also became a royal councillor during the summer, no doubt on the strength of his understanding of finance and his parliamentary experience.<br>
<br>In November 1453, however, Thorpe's career was threatened in a way that had lasting repercussions for him. Reportedly acting on the king's orders, he attached chattels belonging to the duke of York, who promptly sued Thorpe in the exchequer, securing damages of &pound;1000 and the defendant's imprisonment in the Fleet. When parliament reassembled for a second session in February 1454, the Commons petitioned for their speaker's release. But notwithstanding their claim of privilege, the Lords ruled against them, and a new speaker was chosen. Thorpe himself came to terms with York in July, but was hardly reconciled with him, and was thereafter consistently associated with the duke's enemies. Resuming his administrative career, on 24 March 1455 he became chancellor of the exchequer, but shortly afterwards was again embroiled in politics. In attendance on the king when the court confronted York at St Albans on 22 May, he was later charged, along with the duke of Somerset and one William Joseph, with having twice intercepted messages from York to King Henry which might have prevented the battle. Somerset was killed there, and Thorpe was among those subsequently accused of having fled &#145;and left her harneys behynde hem cowardly&#146;  (<span class="italic">Paston Letters</span>, 1.331).<br>
<br>York, who was now clearly set upon ruining him, proceeded to blame Thorpe in parliament for causing the battle, and secured his dismissal from all his offices. An attempt to have him imprisoned was thwarted by the king, but York was able to secure payment of all the damages awarded against Thorpe in 1454. However, as the court recovered control of government from 1456, Thorpe returned to favour. On 16 November 1457 he was made keeper of the privy wardrobe in the Tower of London for life, and on 12 September 1458 he was appointed second baron of the exchequer. At the Coventry parliament of November&#150;December 1459 he secured revenge upon York, by helping to draw up the bill of attainder declaring York and his leading followers to be traitors.<br>
<br>On 9 April 1460 Thorpe secured a life grant of &pound;40 per annum, charged upon the estates of the duke of York and the earl of Salisbury. But he did not enjoy it for long. In July he was captured after the battle of Northampton, and brought back to London a prisoner. Once more deprived of his offices, he escaped from prison, but was recaptured and sent to the Tower. Yet again he escaped, and on 17 February 1461 tried to make his way out of London, presumably to join the Lancastrian army which had just won the second battle of St Albans. But he was caught at Harringay by a party of Londoners, and beheaded forthwith. His estates were subsequently forfeited. Not until 1485 did Roger Thorpe, the son of Thomas's marriage to a woman named Joan (who had died in 1453), achieve a partial restitution.<br>
