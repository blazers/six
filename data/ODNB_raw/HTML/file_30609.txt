<span class="headword">Barnes,  William Emery</span>  (1859&#150;1939), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and biblical scholar</span>, was born in London on 26 May 1859, the younger son of Samuel Emery Barnes, wine merchant, of London, and his wife, Charlotte Ann Noss. He was educated at Islington proprietary school and in 1877 went to Peterhouse, Cambridge; he gained a first class in the 1881 theological tripos, as well as the Jeremie prize (<span class="roman">Septuagint</span>), the Crosse scholarship (divinity), and the Tyrwhitt scholarship (Hebrew); he became BD (1891), and DD (1897). In 1883 he was ordained to a curacy at St John's Church, Waterloo Road, Lambeth, in London, and he returned to Cambridge in 1885 as lecturer in Hebrew at Clare College. Afterwards he was lecturer in Hebrew and divinity at Peterhouse, as well as a fellow, from 1889; he was college chaplain from 1885 to 1904, Hulsean professor of divinity at Cambridge from 1901 to 1934, and dean of Peterhouse from 1920 to 1921. In 1934 he retired to live at Canterbury, continuing, however, as warden of the Central Society of Sacred Study for the diocese of Canterbury, taking classes and giving occasional lectures. He married on 27 March 1890 Georgina de Horne (1847/8&#150;1917), daughter of Alexander Bevington, underwriter of Lloyd's. They had no children.<br>
<br>Barnes was a fine scholar in Hebrew, rabbinic, and Syriac, and he had a working knowledge of several other languages. When pressed in his latter years to begin the study of Persian, he replied that he already kept seven languages going and could not add another. His most substantial contributions were in Syriac. After the death of R. L. Bensly, Barnes edited his unfinished <span class="italic">Fourth Book of Maccabees and Kindred Documents in Syriac</span> (1895), writing the general introduction and translating four of the six documents included. He published an <i>apparatus criticus</i> to the Peshitta text of <span class="roman">Chronicles</span> (in 1897); an edition of Samuel Lee's Syriac <span class="roman">Pentateuch</span> (in collaboration, in 1914); and an edition of the Peshitta text of the <span class="roman">Psalms</span> (1904). For younger students he produced editions of <span class="roman">Chronicles</span> (1899), <span class="roman">Kings</span> (1908), and <span class="roman">Haggai</span>, <span class="roman">Zechariah</span>, and <span class="roman">Malachi</span> (1917) in the Cambridge <span class="roman">Bible</span>.<br>
<br>As joint editor with C. H. Turner of the <span class="italic">Journal of Theological Studies</span> at its inception in 1899, Barnes set a high standard and thereafter contributed to it various articles, notes, and reviews. He remained joint editor (from 1902 with Henry Austin Wilson) until 1903.<br>
<br>Always averse to controversy and unwilling to commit himself, Barnes accepted the new learning of his time and the new approach to the literary and historical study of the <span class="roman">Old Testament</span>, but used it very cautiously. Much of the new literature he regarded as &#145;wild&#146; and he disliked intensely the way some scholars cut texts about; but he evaluated their arguments before rejecting them. With his strong conservative and devotional tendencies and his respect for tradition he was happiest in drawing out the moral and spiritual values of the books on which he commented, as he did in his edition of the <span class="roman">Psalms</span> for the <span class="roman">Westminster Commentaries</span> (1931).<br>
<br>Bishop Arthur Mesac Knight, a younger contemporary of Barnes at school, remembered him then as &#145;a trim and somewhat prim little figure, precise, careful, but with strength of character &hellip; and he had his own opinions&#146;. This remained true of Barnes all through his later life. Gentle, quiet, sincere, kindly, and mildly humorous, he was a good friend to many different people and enjoyed gathering with them at luxurious lunches in Peterhouse. As a teacher he was painstaking and straightforward, anxious not to be above the heads of his pupils.<br>
<br>Of small stature and slight physique, Barnes was keenly interested in warfare. In his early days he joined the university rifle volunteers (later the officer training corps), when it had little support, and almost to the end of his time in Cambridge he went to the butts to fire. Military history, strategy, and tactics were his hobby, and in discussions of them in the combination room he sometimes corrected the master of his college, Field Marshal Lord Birdwood. He also favoured the revision of English spelling, on which he wrote to <span class="italic">The Times</span> and other papers, and he liked to make excursions into other fields of study, with something of his own to illustrate the subject. While visiting Exeter to lecture, he died there, at Mowbray House, on 17 August 1939.<br>
