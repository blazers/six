<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Browne,  Stanley George</span>  (1907&#150;1986), <span class="occ">leprologist and medical missionary</span>, was born on 8 December 1907 at 77 Bousefield Road, New Cross, London, the second of the five children of Arthur Browne (1874&#150;1967), Post Office clerk, and his wife, Edith Lillywhite (1887&#150;1927). His formal instruction started when, after much pleading, he entered Waller Road elementary school, New Cross, at the age of three. In 1919 Browne left to continue his education at Brockley central school, but, because of the prolonged illness of his father, he left here in 1923 and obtained the post of junior clerk in the town clerk's department at Deptford town hall. He studied at night school and passed matriculation in the first division in June 1926. Browne was awarded one of the first London county council (LCC) non-vocational scholarships in 1927 and entered King's College, London, the following autumn. His two-year scholarship was extended to three, which enabled him to follow a medical course, and he obtained a further LCC scholarship which enabled him to complete his medical studies, qualifying MB, BS, at London University in 1933. Browne won many prizes during his medical education and also took the theology course available to students who were not studying divinity; he passed as an associate of King's College with first-class honours. He became a member of the Royal College of Physicians in 1934 and a fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons in 1935.<br>
<br>Browne spoke fluent French and, in 1936, after obtaining the diploma in tropical medicine from the Institut de M&eacute;decine Tropicale Prince L&eacute;opold, Antwerp, he joined the staff of the Baptist Missionary Society hospital at Yakusu in the Belgian Congo. As well as his duties in the hospital he undertook the training of the African <i>infirmiers</i>, or medical auxiliaries, and carried out disease surveys in outlying areas, where he discovered that the incidence of leprosy was extremely high. He also undertook missionary duties. Browne returned to Britain on leave in 1939 and, just before his return to Africa in 1940, he met his future wife, Ethel Marion Williamson (<i>b</i>. 1912), known to her family as Mali, a teacher, and the daughter of the general foreign secretary of the Baptist Missionary Society. Browne returned to Yakusu in April 1940 where he was joined by Ethel; they married on 15 November 1940 and their three sons were all born in Africa.<br>
<br>When he was in England on furlough Browne continued preaching in chapels all over the country. Soon after his return to Yakusu a leprosarium was opened nearby at Yalisombo. Because of the painful and unreliable treatment with chaulmoogra oil, along with food shortages in the settlement, the leprosarium had an uncertain beginning; but the American Mission to Lepers sent out a new drug, diasone, for Browne to try, which proved more effective. In 1954 he also worked on the increasing rate of onchocerciasis, or river blindness, and the control of its vector, the blackfly <i>Simulium damnosum</i>, whose larval stage he discovered. The leprosarium at Yalisombo became internationally known and Browne was urged to concentrate on leprosy by the distinguished leprologist Robert Cochrane, a suggestion which was opposed by some who interpreted medical and missionary policy differently, and by others out of professional jealousy.<br>
<br>After his return on leave to England in 1958 Browne resigned from the Baptist Missionary Society and the following year he was invited by the Nigerian government to become senior leprologist at the Leprosy Research Unit, Uzuakoli in eastern Nigeria. There he continued his work with trials of new drugs, in particular B663 (subsequently called clofazimine), and maintained his lecturing and preaching. During 1963 sponsorship by the World Health Organization enabled him to visit leprosy research centres throughout the world. He was invited to be chairman of the working group on the treatment of leprosy at the International Congress on Leprosy at Rio de Janeiro in 1963, and was asked to advise on the establishment of the All Africa Leprosy Training and Rehabilitation Centre. He recommended its placement at Addis Ababa.<br>
<br>During these years Browne published extensively in both English and French on leprosy, onchocerciasis, and other tropical diseases, as well as on medical ethics. At the beginning of 1966, in succession to Robert Cochrane, he took up the appointment of director of the Leprosy Study Centre, London, and remained in the post until the centre's closure in 1980. Browne campaigned against the stigma attached to the disease, and it was in part as a result of his efforts that the Mission to Lepers changed its name to the Leprosy Mission. He was awarded many international prizes and honours both for his work on leprosy and for his missionary activities, and was visiting lecturer on leprosy to hospitals throughout the world. He was appointed OBE in 1965 and the CMG in 1976, as well as receiving Belgian honours. He was president of the Royal Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene from 1977 to 1979, and president of the Baptist Union from 1980 to 1981. Browne's manner demonstrated great warmth and friendliness to all and he had the gift of making others feel that what they did was of great value.<br>
<br>Browne made a visit to China soon after receiving treatment for cancer of the larynx. He died suddenly at his home, 16 Bridgefield Road, Sutton, Surrey, on 29 January 1986, from a ruptured aorta; his funeral took place at Sutton Baptist Church on 11 February 1986, and he was cremated. He was survived by his wife.<br>
