<span class="headword">Thatcher <span class="st"> [Thacher]</span>,  Peter</span>  (1587/8&#150;1641), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, was the eldest of at least three sons of Peter Thatcher of Queen Camel, Somerset. He matriculated from Queen's College, Oxford, in May 1603 aged fifteen, graduated BA from Corpus Christi College in 1608, and proceeded MA in 1611. In 1616 he became vicar of Milton Clevedon, Somerset, sufficiently close to Queen Camel for it to be possible that he retained family connections there, and about the same time he married Anne Allwood, perhaps of a Somerset family; their second son was <a name="cosubject_75103"></a><span class="headword">Thomas Thacher</span>  (1620&#150;1678)<span class="occ"></span>. By 1621 he was one of a circle of &#145;much respected friends and brethren in the ministry&#146; in Somerset  (Bernard, sig. A5<i>r</i>), some at least of whom were Calvinists looking for further reformation in the ceremonies of the established church. In 1623 he moved to Salisbury as rector of St Edmund's, and he found there an opportunity to promote a much wider reformation.<br>
<br>Thatcher had been invited by a determined group in the St Edmund's vestry who gradually acquired authority in the town and pushed through a programme of social and civic reform. He voiced his support for their campaign &#145;to reform the drunkenness, idleness, running to the alehouse and other such courses, which have been and are the bane of our poor in Sarum&#146;. He found &#145;God's providence&#146; at work in the plague epidemic of 1627 which scattered the opponents of the godly and so facilitated action for &#145;the public good&#146; of the city (TNA: PRO, SP 16/527/4; Hants. RO, 44M69, L37/38). His aspirations were shared by other clergy in the west country, notably John White of Dorchester, with whom Thatcher had close contact, but he never acquired White's civic dominance in his own town. He appears readily to have yielded first place to the ambitious lawyer, Henry Sherfield, Salisbury's recorder, and to John Ivie, a Salisbury councillor.<br>
<br>Sherfield's disgrace before Star Chamber in 1633, following his iconoclastic attack on a painted window in St Edmund's Church, brought a check to local reform and to Thatcher's prospects. Archbishop William Laud had criticized him in Star Chamber as one who &#145;hath not read all the divine service in a whole year together&#146;  (Emlyn, <span class="italic">State-Trials</span>, 1.404). Within a month of Sherfield's death, in January 1634, Thatcher was writing to Sir Robert Harley in search of a safer berth, but he turned down what must have been the tempting offer of the living of Brampton Bryan, Herefordshire, perhaps because his wife died on 23 March. According to Cotton Mather, Thatcher also contemplated following his second son, Thomas, and brother Anthony, whose emigration to New England he helped to finance in 1635; but that similarly came to nothing. He married Alice Batt (1604/5&#150;1669), daughter of a parishioner, on 14 April 1635 and apparently lived quietly with his family in St Edmund's, where he died between 1 February 1641, when he made his will, and 28 February, when the vestry elected his successor. On 19 October the same year his widow married Francis Dove, another member of the St Edmund's reforming caucus and brother of a Long Parliament MP for the city.<br>
<br>Thatcher left no publications, and the fate of any manuscripts is unknown. He left &pound;50 each to his nine surviving children (six sons, three of them young and perhaps children of Alice, and three daughters), but his chief legacy was his library: more than a hundred volumes in Latin and English of biblical and devotional writings, ranging from Calvin and Beza through Thomas Cartwright to John Davenant and Nicholas Byfield, all carefully listed in a schedule to his will and bequeathed to Thomas in New England. The inheritance perhaps helped Thomas Thacher achieve greater prominence in urban reformation than his father: from 2 January 1644 as cleric&#150;physician at Weymouth, Massachusetts, and from 1669 as pastor of the Third (Old South) Church in Boston, also in Massachusetts. He was the author of <span class="italic">A Brief Rule</span>, one of the first medical tracts published in New England, giving advice against smallpox, which was published in 1678. With his first wife, whom he married on 11 May 1643, Thomas had five children; he married in 1664 Margaret Sheafe, widow, of Boston. He died in 1678.<br>
