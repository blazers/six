<span class="headword">Pellew, Sir  Isaac Israel</span>  (1758&#150;1832), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, was born on 25 August 1758 either at Flushing, near Falmouth, or at Dover, the third of the six children of Samuel Pellew (1713&#150;1765), commander of a Dover Post Office packet, and his wife, Constance (<i>d</i>. 1812), daughter of Edward Langford of Penzance and his wife, Catherine. His elder brother was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21808/', "Edward Pellew (later Viscount Exmouth)")</script>. First going to sea in the sloop <i>Falcon</i> in 1771, he served for three years in the West Indies. After a short time on the <i>Albion</i> in 1775 he went to the North American station on the frigate <i>Flora</i> a year later. When she was scuttled to prevent her capture in 1778 he briefly served ashore and was commended for his conduct. On his return home Pellew was made lieutenant into the <i>Royal George</i> in April 1779 and then served on the frigates <i>Dana&euml;</i> and <i>Apollo</i>. He was placed in command of the armed cutter <i>Resolution</i> in the North Sea in 1782, distinguishing himself on 20 January 1783 when she captured a Dutch privateer, and he retained command of her on the Irish station until 1787. In March 1789 he joined the <i>Salisbury</i>, and he was promoted commander on 22 November 1790, not being employed again during the peace.<br>
<br>In 1792 Pellew married Mary Helen Gilmore (1758&#150;1844), and for a while they lived in Larne, co. Antrim, near her family: they had one son, Edward, an officer in the Life Guards who was killed in a duel in 1819. On the outbreak of war in 1793 Pellew served as a volunteer in his brother's frigate the <i>Nymphe</i>, being in charge of her aft guns when she captured the <i>Cl&eacute;op&acirc;tre</i> on 18 June. For this he was presented to George III and made post captain into the <i>Squirrel</i>, being praised for his command of her off the Dutch coast. In April 1795 he was made captain of a larger frigate, the <i>Amphion</i>, commanding her off Newfoundland and in the North Sea. In September 1796, sailing to join his brother's squadron in the channel, Pellew took <i>Amphion</i> into Plymouth for repairs. At 4.30 p.m. on 22 September she suddenly exploded. The ship was packed with people, about 300 of whom were killed. Pellew, stunned and badly cut about the face&#151;lacerations that scarred him for life&#151;survived by throwing himself through an open stern gallery window on to the deck of an adjacent sheer hulk. An inquiry blamed the disaster on the <i>Amphion</i>'s gunner, who was suspected of stealing gunpowder and carelessly leaving a trail that caught fire and led back to the fore magazine. However, it may also be significant that Pellew had already complained that the magazine was poorly constructed and unsafe.<br>
<br>In February 1797 Pellew was appointed to the <i>Greyhound</i> but, having been put ashore when her crew mutinied, and under pressure from his commander-in-chief, he resigned the command, being moved in July to the <i>Cleopatra</i>. He commanded her first in the channel, until November 1798, and then on the Halifax and Jamaica stations. He suffered a defeat in 1800 when sending boats from the <i>Cleopatra</i> and the <i>Andromache</i> to seize some Spanish vessels in Levita Bay, Cuba. The assault was anticipated and, though they captured a small galley, the attackers were driven off, suffering twelve dead and seventeen wounded. Later on Pellew also had the embarrassment of the <i>Cleopatra</i>'s running aground on Abaco, one of the Bahamas. She was stuck for three days and only escaped when her guns and part of her ballast had been thrown overboard. The <i>Cleopatra</i> returned to Britain in December 1801 and was paid off.<br>
<br>Pellew next went to sea in April 1804, commanding the ship of the line <i>Conqueror</i> in the channel before going to the Mediterranean in September. She fought at Trafalgar, being fourth ship in the van or weather column, and it was to her that the <i>Bucentaure</i>, Villeneuve's flagship, surrendered. She also engaged the <i>Santisima Trinidad</i> and attempted to block the escape of Dumanoir's squadron. Although <i>Conqueror</i>'s sails and rigging suffered considerable damage, she lost only three dead and nine wounded. One prize, however, was denied Pellew. He sent a marine captain and five men to secure the <i>Bucentaure</i>, that officer refusing to accept Villeneuve's sword and that of the commandant of her soldiers with the remark that the swords should go to Captain Pellew. In the heat of the action, though, they never reached him, ending up with Vice-Admiral Cuthbert Collingwood who, much to Pellew's disgust, kept them.<br>
<br>After Trafalgar the <i>Conqueror</i> helped blockade Cadiz and then, in 1807, was in the squadron sent to secure the Portuguese fleet and royal family. She remained off the Portuguese coast during much of 1808, eventually returning home after the surrender of Siniavin's Russian squadron in the Tagus. Pellew then left her and was appointed to superintend the payment of ships in the Medway.<br>
<br>On 31 July 1810 Pellew was promoted to the rank of rear-admiral and in the following year his brother, on receiving the command in the Mediterranean, made him captain of the fleet, a sort of naval chief of staff. He retained this position until 1816, taking a prominent part in the negotiations with the Barbary powers that year. This marked the end of his active service. Pellew, who had been made a KCB on 2 January 1815, advanced to the rank of vice-admiral on 12 August 1819 and admiral on 22 July 1830. He had moved to Plymouth and died there, after a long and painful illness, on 19 July 1832; he is buried at the town's Charles Church. He was survived by his wife, who died on 2 November 1844.<br>
