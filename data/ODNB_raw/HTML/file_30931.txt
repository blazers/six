<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Citrine,  Walter McLennan</span>, first Baron Citrine  (1887&#150;1983), <span class="occ">trade unionist and public servant</span>, was born on 22 August 1887 in Liverpool, the second of three sons and third of five children of Alfred Citrine (1852&#150;1937), seaman, of Liverpool, and his wife, Isabella (<i>b</i>. 1847), hospital nurse, daughter of George McLennan, of Arbroath. Citrine believed the family, originally called Cirtini, to have come from Italy. The name had been changed by the time of his father's marriage. Citrine left elementary school at twelve, and thereafter educated himself in subjects such as economics, accountancy, and socialism. His mastery of Gregg shorthand while a young trade union official served him particularly well in his later administrative career.<h2>
<a name="Meteoricrise"></a>Meteoric rise</h2>Citrine was apprenticed as an electrician and worked on a number of sites in the Merseyside area. In 1914 he was elected as the first full-time district secretary of the Electrical Trades Union (ETU), and in 1918 he was appointed president (and from 1919 secretary) of the local Federation of Engineering and Shipbuilding Trades. In 1920 he moved to work in the ETU's Manchester headquarters, and in January 1924 became the assistant general secretary of the Trades Union Congress (TUC). In October 1925 Citrine was recalled from his first visit to Russia to become acting TUC general secretary following the death of Fred Bramley. It was in that capacity that he played a prominent role in the organization, and eventual calling off, of the general strike in May 1926. Writing notes during the meeting of the general council on 11 May 1926, Citrine recorded: &#145;I try to analyse my feelings, and find myself swinging first to one view and then to another&#146;  (Citrine, <span class="italic">Men and Work</span>, 196). He saw the strike as a struggle between unions, as well as for the cause of the unions and concluded that its chief result was that &#145;authority must be invested exclusively and entirely in the directing body&#146; (that is, the general council)  (ibid., 205). In September 1926 Citrine was confirmed in office, and remained TUC general secretary until he joined the National Coal Board in 1946. From 1947 to 1957 he was the chairman of the British Electricity Authority (from 1955 the Central Electricity Authority), and after retiring from that post he continued to serve as a part-time member of the Electricity Council and the Atomic Energy Authority (1958&#150;62).<br>
<br>Citrine's meteoric rise through the trade union movement was a tribute to both his administrative ability and his strong sense of the direction in which he wished the movement to develop. In his youth Citrine had been interested in socialist ideas, and had joined the Independent Labour Party in 1906. He was familiar with the writings of Karl Marx and the Webbs' <span class="italic">Industrial Democracy</span> (1897). Beatrice Webb discerned Citrine's overweening ambition, but also his very real ability, noting in her diary &#145;He is loquacious, naively vain and very disputatious. Susan [Lawrence] says he is a goose. I think he is very ambitious&#146;  (<span class="italic">Diary</span>, 4.127).<br>
<br>While never wholly abandoning socialism, Citrine later came to believe that workers' interests could best be protected and improved within a capitalist system by the strength of their institutions: above all, the trade unions. As general secretary he distanced the unions from the Labour Party and worked for the centralization of trade union power in the TUC. His intention was not, as during the general strike, to coerce the government, but rather to make the unions reliable partners in negotiation with employers and the government of the day. Whereas the TUC general council had once been viewed as a &#145;general staff&#146; for a labour movement engaged in conflict with government, Citrine presided over the TUC's transformation into an effective &#145;civil service&#146; for its affiliated unions.<h2>
<a name="Masteryofthetradeunionmovement"></a>Mastery of the trade union movement</h2>Citrine saw the general strike as a turning point in the development of British trade unionism. His subsequent attempt to promote constructive relations with fair-minded employers resulted in the controversial Mond&#150;Turner talks in 1928. The talks were inconclusive and Citrine's innovative ideas were not to be welcomed by government until the 1940s. In 1931 he played an important role in the break-up of the second Labour government, opposing the cabinet's plans for restoring financial confidence through cuts in welfare benefits. The ensuing Conservative-dominated National Government was unwilling to grant the TUC the independent role that Citrine sought. He was also at odds with its &#145;appeasement&#146; of Nazi Germany, chairing the World Anti-Nazi Council and in December 1936 sharing a pro-rearmament platform with Winston Churchill at the Albert Hall.<br>
<br>In the 1930s Citrine, alongside Ernest Bevin, gained a rare degree of mastery over the British trade union movement. Although the two men differed profoundly in character, and their personal relationship lacked warmth, they were in agreement on the major issues of the day such as rearmament and the need to exclude communist influence from the labour movement. Citrine's success rested not only on his own abilities, but also on the hard work of his loyal and professional staff at the TUC who ensured that he was always immaculately prepared for debates. Under Citrine the role of the TUC was defined for decades to come as a centre for policy formation and negotiation within the trade union movement. A major achievement was the drafting in 1939 of the &#145;Bridlington Rules&#146; that prevented unions poaching members from their rivals. However, the confederal basis of the TUC, with power still resting with the individual unions, precluded the degree of centralization to which Citrine aspired. No subsequent general secretary matched Citrine's longevity of service, breadth of vision, or authority both as a trade union leader and public figure.<br>
<br>Citrine hoped that, by acting responsibly, the trade unions would come to be perceived not merely as a sectional force in society, but as a valued member of the national community. On these grounds he accepted a knighthood in 1935 from the National Government, braving outraged condemnation from left-wing trade unionists. As far as was possible Citrine eschewed party politics throughout his career. While a loyal member of the Labour Party he was far from sectarian in his outlook and proud of his friendly relations with politicians such as Lord Beaverbrook and, even after the events of 1931, Ramsay MacDonald. Although he once stood unsuccessfully as Labour candidate for Wallasey in 1918, he saw his duty as lying with the TUC and refused to embark on a political career. In 1930 he declined an offer of a peerage from Ramsay MacDonald and, according to his memoirs, turned down an offer to serve in Churchill's wartime coalition government. Citrine's main political adversaries were on the left, for whom he was a dogged and dangerous enemy. He saw the communists as politically motivated and a threat to trade union interests: the intellectuals on the Labour left wing, meanwhile, were in his eyes impractical and dangerous idealists. He was quick to turn to litigation in defence of his own reputation and that of the TUC, and won a series of court cases against the communists.<br>
<br>Citrine saw the development of the TUC's international activity as an important aspect of his work, and his presidency of the International Federation of Trade Unions (1928&#150;45) made him travel frequently to meetings at its offices in Berlin, and subsequently Paris. He was always an acute observer of politics and social conditions on his travels. He made numerous visits to the Soviet Union and the United States, and in 1940 was sent on a delegation to Finland during the &#145;winter war&#146; with the Soviet Union. In 1938&#150;39 he served on a royal commission investigating social and economic conditions in the West Indies following the recent disturbances there. His internationalism was a logical extension of his ideas on the domestic role of trade unions. He believed that unions could improve workers' conditions through international co-operation, but did not share the communists' conception of internationalism as a vehicle for political ideas and influence. This essentially syndical view resulted in the short-lived Anglo-French trade union committee in 1939&#150;40, and the Anglo-Soviet committee of 1941&#150;5 which was later expanded to include the American Confederation of Labour Organisations. In 1945 he became the founding president of the World Federation of Trade Unions which broke up, however, under the impact of the cold war soon after his departure from the TUC.<h2>
<a name="Coalandelectricitysupremo"></a>Coal and electricity supremo</h2>Citrine's moment as a trade unionist came in the Second World War when, with Ernest Bevin at the Ministry of Labour, the TUC attained an unparalleled degree of influence and consultation. Following the war Citrine was seconded in 1946 to join the new National Coal Board where he had special responsibility for training, recruitment, and education, and was chairman of the welfare commission. Both this and his subsequent chairmanship of the British Electricity Authority (BEA) were political appointments by a Labour government eager to place nationalized industries in capable and sympathetic hands. The moves allowed him to extend his career and brought a substantially higher salary than he had been paid at the TUC. Above all, however, the BEA post allowed Citrine full range for his creative instincts with great powers at his disposal. His memoirs leave no doubt that this second career in public service was the happiest part of his working life.<br>
<br>At the BEA Citrine successfully managed the transfer of 553 municipal and privately owned units to the new authority and its area boards, and rode out the difficult post-war period of power shortages. He identified with the electricity industry as closely as he had previously done with the TUC and ably used his accumulated political wisdom and contacts to win greater investment. As at the TUC he was well supported by a dedicated staff, especially his two deputy chairmen Sir Henry Self (former permanent secretary at the Ministry of Civil Aviation) and Sir John Hacking (who had had a long career in electricity production). By his retirement in 1957 British electrical output was two and a half times higher than its pre-war levels, electrification had been extended to many rural areas, and (with Citrine's enthusiastic support) work had started on power stations to produce atomic energy. Citrine also saw the chance to apply principles of enlightened management, and even &#145;industrial democracy&#146;, to the industry. He created an impressive system of consultation for the workforce, and presided over a general increase in pay and conditions. At the same time he could be a tough manager, in 1949 allowing the army to be used by the Labour government to crush an unofficial strike in London.<h2>
<a name="Personalityandotheractivities"></a>Personality and other activities</h2>Citrine was an inveterate note-taker and diarist, and these records formed the material for numerous published accounts of his foreign travels. The most significant of these was <span class="italic">I Search for Truth in Russia</span> (1936). Here, Citrine's critical eye for the realities of life in the Soviet Union served to intensify the personal attacks made on him by his communist opponents. Within the labour movement, however, his most important publication was the <span class="italic">ABC of Chairmanship</span> (1939) which formalized the lessons that Citrine had learned from a lifetime of bureaucratic practice. He published two volumes of autobiography. <span class="italic">Men and Work</span> (1964) was a vital document on the inter-war labour movement and far more readable that its plodding sequel <span class="italic">Two Careers</span> (1967). For the <span class="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</span> he wrote the notices on Dame Caroline Haslett and Sir Arthur Pugh who, like himself, was a trade unionist knighted in 1935.<br>
<br>Citrine was appointed KBE in 1935 and GBE in 1958. He became Baron Citrine, of Wembley, Middlesex, in July 1946. In 1940 he was admitted to the privy council. From 1939 to 1947 he was a visiting fellow at Nuffield College, Oxford, and in 1955 Manchester University awarded him an honorary LLD. In 1947 the ETU awarded him its gold badge, and in 1975 he received a similar award from the subsequently enlarged Electrical Electronic Telecommunication and Plumbing Union. On 28 March 1914 he married Dorothy Helen 
    (Doris; 1892&#150;1973)
  , daughter of Edgar Slade, commercial traveller, of Pendleton, Manchester. They had two sons, the elder of whom, Norman Arthur (<i>b</i>. 1914), a solicitor, was the author of <span class="italic">Trade Union Law</span> (1950).<br>
<br>The best-known description of Citrine remains Beatrice Webb's somewhat patronizing account in her published <span class="italic">Diary</span>, in which she records meeting him soon after he had joined the TUC: &#145;Under forty years of age, tall, broad-shouldered, with the manners and clothes and way of speaking of a superior bank clerk &hellip; He is a non-smoker, non-drinker, small, slow eater, takes a daily cold bath, sleeps with his windows open&#151;altogether a hygienic puritan in daily life&#146;  (4.126&#150;7). Although something of a martinet, Citrine could also display considerable personal charm. Surprisingly, given his upright personality and conventional views, he was interested in palmistry and claimed to have heeded such advice at critical moments in his career. He also enjoyed playing the cornet, reading and memorizing poetry, and collecting books.<br>
<br>Citrine died on 22 January 1983 at Brixham Hospital, Devon.<br>
