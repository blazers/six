<span class="headword">Erskine family</span>  (<em>per. </em><em>c.</em>1350&#150;<em>c.</em>1450), <span class="occ">administrators and noblemen</span>, became important in the court politics and government of Scotland in the second half of the fourteenth century. Established in Renfrewshire by the thirteenth century, the Erskines were followers of the Stewarts, and it was after the capture of David II at the battle of Nevilles Cross in 1346, when the king's nephew Robert the Steward (the future Robert II) was governor of Scotland, that <a name="cosubject_54182"></a><span class="headword">Sir Robert Erskine</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1385)<span class="occ"></span> assumed a leading role in administration. Already a knight in 1343, by 15 May 1350 he was acting as chamberlain, the crown's chief financial officer, in the name of the absent king. He was involved in the negotiations leading to David's release from captivity in 1357. Although David replaced him as chamberlain with Thomas, earl of Mar, in 1358, Erskine continued to serve as a royal envoy to the English, French, and papal courts, and in 1359 he cited David's unwillingness to release him from his service in justification of a bid to obtain discharge from crusading vows. No later than 12 May 1363, when David II faced a major baronial rebellion sparked partly by his alleged misuse of sums raised to pay for his English ransom, Erskine was reappointed to the chamberlainship, perhaps as a man trusted by both the king and his opponents to control the royal finances. He retained the office until late the following year, and thereafter remained an important royal envoy and administrator, being particularly active in David's negotiations with the English crown during the 1360s. Besides his ambassadorial duties, Erskine also acted as justiciar of Lothian and as custodian at various times of the royal castles of Stirling and Dumbarton. His rewards included Alloa and other lands in the sheriffdom of Clackmannan, granted in regality in 1364, and the barony of Dun, Forfarshire, probably given in 1368 when the grant of Alloa was confirmed.<br>
<br>Towards the end of David's reign Erskine's influence increased because of his association with the king's new mistress, Agnes Dunbar. She was in Erskine's care in 1369, as a result of which more royal patronage was diverted to him and his family. Most notably, in April 1370 he received a lifetime grant of the keepership of Stirling Castle. His place in government was threatened by the unexpected death of David II on 22 February 1371, and he played a significant though rather enigmatic part in the events which occurred between David's death and the accession of Robert II, when William, earl of Douglas, led an armed demonstration at Linlithgow. Douglas's aim has been variously interpreted as either to contest the Steward's claim to the throne or to challenge Erskine's hold on royal offices and his influence in government. Erskine and his allies John and George Dunbar, the brothers of Agnes, were said by Wyntoun to have ended Douglas's demonstration by assembling their own forces and confronting the earl at Linlithgow. Erskine remained as a regular witness to the new king's great seal charters, but in the two years after 1371 he and his son Thomas lost most of their prestigious offices to the earl of Douglas (who became justiciar south of the Forth) and the sons of Robert II (who became custodians of Edinburgh and Stirling castles). Nevertheless Robert received substantial financial compensation for these losses in the form of large one-off payments and annuities from the royal customs, and he continued to witness great seal charters until his death between 21 May and 11 November 1385.<br>
<br>Erskine married twice. His first wife was Beatrice, widow of Sir Archibald Douglas (<i>d</i>. 1333) and daughter of Alexander Lindsay of Crawford. She had died by about 1352, when he married Christian Keith 
    (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Menteith; <i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1387)
  , widow of Sir Edward Keith of Sinton, allegedly as a means of settling a quarrel between himself and the Menteiths. A number of grants and confirmations were made jointly to Erskine and his second wife. His heir, however, was <a name="cosubject_54183"></a><span class="headword">Sir Thomas Erskine</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1403/4)<span class="occ"></span>, the eldest son of his first marriage. Thomas too had been high in the favour of David II, receiving the lucrative ward of the heiress to the lordship of Brechin and also perhaps the keepership of Edinburgh Castle during 1370. Both the wardship and the constableship were handed over to sons of Robert II after 1371. Despite these setbacks Sir Thomas (he was knighted some time between 1365 and 1370) remained a regular witness to the new king's great seal charters. Like many of the men associated with David II, he found his way into the service of Robert II's eldest son and heir, John Stewart, earl of Carrick (later Robert III); he was paid an 80 merk pension for his service to Carrick and the king throughout the 1380s. Erskine was notably active in the Anglo-Scottish warfare promoted by Carrick in the 1380s and was one of three Scottish knights responsible for the distribution of a French war subsidy in 1385. On 5 August 1388 he was severely wounded at the battle of Otterburn, in which James, second earl of Douglas and eleventh earl of Mar, was killed. Douglas died childless, and his earldom of Mar passed to his sister Isabella and her husband, Malcolm Drummond, who, however, also had no children. Erskine had an interest in Mar through his second wife, Janet Barclay 
    (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Keith; <i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1413)
  , apparently a great-granddaughter of Gartnait, earl of Mar (<i>d</i>. before 1305), and a claim to be considered as one of the heirs to the earldom should Malcolm and Isabella Drummond remain childless. In 1391 and 1393 he sought and received assurances from the crown that there would be no royal confirmation of any deals made by Countess Isabella that would adversely affect the rights of his own wife in Mar.<br>
<br>Erskine remained active in public life, and on 14 September 1402 he and his son Sir Robert (a knight by 1400) were among the many Scottish lords captured by the English at the battle of Homildon Hill. It is not known whether he had been released before his death between 11 November 1403 and 18 May 1404. His first wife, Mary Douglas, died in childbirth in or before 1370, and his heir, <a name="cosubject_54184"></a><span class="headword">Robert Erskine</span>, first Lord Erskine  (<em>d.</em> 1451/2)<span class="occ"></span>, was the son of his marriage to Janet Barclay. Robert's career was dominated by his ultimately unsuccessful efforts to obtain title to the earldom of Mar. His claim was badly affected in August 1404, when the recently widowed Isabella, countess of Mar, married Alexander Stewart, the illegitimate son of Alexander Stewart, earl of Buchan. The couple attempted to arrange for Isabella's earldom to pass to Alexander and his male descendants in heritage. Kinsmen and allies of the Erskines, including Robert Stewart, duke of Albany, then guardian of the kingdom, intervened to ensure that royal approval for this scheme was withheld, and eventually Alexander Stewart had to settle for the right to hold the earldom for his own lifetime. However, in 1426 James I regranted the earldom to Alexander with a descent to Alexander's illegitimate son Thomas and his male heirs. In the event Thomas Stewart predeceased his father and produced no heirs, so that the issue of the succession to Mar was revived again when Earl Alexander eventually died in 1435. Meanwhile Robert Erskine continued his family's tradition of royal service. He was one of the hostages for the release of James I from English captivity in 1424, spending three years in England before attaining his own freedom in 1427, and after his release he served as a royal envoy to England and as custodian of Dumbarton Castle, as well as holding a number of other minor offices. The death of Alexander Stewart, earl of Mar, on 1 August 1435 reopened the debate over the possession of Mar. Erskine attempted to build up local support for his claims to the earldom, but James I took it into his own hands on the grounds that the 1426 grant had stipulated that it should revert to the crown if Earl Alexander's male line failed. But after James's death in 1437 Erskine succeeded in having himself served as the legal heir to Mar in 1438, and from that year onwards he employed the title earl of Mar and Garioch.<br>
<br>Erskine's claims to Mar were not acknowledged by the leaders of James II's minority regime, although about the time he assumed the comital title his standing was acknowledged by his being created a peer of parliament as Lord Erskine. In the 1440s he came to a series of agreements with James II's administration over possession of Kildrummy Castle and the revenues of the earldom. None of these agreements proved binding, and by 1449 it was clear that royal officers had effective control of the earldom. Complaints about the crown's unjust detention of Erskine's rightful inheritance were delivered to meetings of the three estates in April 1449 and January 1450 by his son Thomas, and the dispute was still in progress when Robert died some time between 7 September 1451 and 6 November 1452. The identity of his wife is uncertain, although arrangements were made in 1400 for his marriage to an unnamed daughter of David Lindsay, first earl of Crawford. Robert was succeeded as Lord Erskine by his eldest son, Thomas, whose great-great-grandson John finally became earl of Mar in 1565.<br>
