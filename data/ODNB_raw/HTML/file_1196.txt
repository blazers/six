<span class="headword">Balfour,  Robert</span>, fifth Lord Balfour of Burleigh  (<em>d.</em> 1757), <span class="occ">murderer and Jacobite sympathizer</span>, was the son of Robert Balfour, fourth Lord Balfour of Burleigh (<i>d</i>. 1713), and Lady Margaret Melville, daughter of the first earl of Melville. Robert's attraction to a young woman of lesser social rank prompted his parents to send him on the grand tour in the hopes of breaking their attachment. Before leaving, however, Robert threatened the young woman that if she married in his absence, he would return and kill her husband. During his tour she married Henry Stenhouse, the schoolmaster at Inverkeithing, after acquainting him with the threat. Balfour returned in 1707, immediately enquiring after his lady-love. On 9 April 1707, at the news of her marriage, he and two attendants rode directly to the schoolhouse at Inverkeithing, where he called Stenhouse out and wounded him in the shoulder. Balfour returned quietly to the family home at Burleigh. On 21 April the schoolmaster died from his wound. Balfour was arrested, tried for murder before the high court of the judiciary in August 1709, and found guilty. Under sentence of death by beheading, Balfour escaped from prison (&#145;the heart of Midlothian&#146;) by exchanging clothes with his sister, to whom he bore a strong resemblance. He lay low on family lands around Burleigh, perhaps hiding for a period in a large hollow ash tree associated with him in local legend.<br>
<br>Balfour became the fifth Lord Balfour of Burleigh on his father's death in 1713. He resurfaced in May 1714, drinking to the health of the Pretender (James Stuart) at a meeting of Jacobites at Lochmaben, and damning all those who would not participate. For his participation in the 1715 rising, he was attainted by act of parliament and his estates forfeited to the crown. When he died, without issue, in 1757, his claims passed to his sisters, Mary and Margaret, one of whose descendants, Alexander Bruce, succeeded in reversing the act of attainder in 1868.<br>
