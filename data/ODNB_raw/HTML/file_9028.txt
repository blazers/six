<span class="headword">Exton, Sir  Thomas</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1631, <em>d.</em> 1688), <span class="occ">lawyer and politician</span>, was baptized at St Andrew's, Holborn, on 2 June 1631, the first surviving son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9027/', "John Exton (c.1600&#150;1668)")</script>, admiralty judge, and his wife, Thomasina (<i>d</i>. in or before 1667), daughter of Ralph Brooke, York herald. He was educated at Merchant Taylors' School, London, from 1637 to 1643 before matriculating from Trinity Hall, Cambridge, in 1647. He entered Gray's Inn on 28 December 1649. He became a fellow of Trinity in 1651, graduating LLB in 1652. In 1659 he was called to the bar at Gray's Inn and in 1662 received his LLD. In 1663 Exton resigned his fellowship and was named chancellor of the diocese of London. He married on 19 January 1664 Isabella (1625/6&#150;1673), daughter of Robert Hore, apothecary, of London, the widow of Thomas Prujean of Hornchurch, Essex. They had a son and a daughter. On 22 June 1664 he became an advocate at Doctors' Commons. He succeeded his father in 1668 and received two-thirds of his estate, the remaining third going to his brother Everard, a proctor.<br>
<br>Exton was knighted on 23 November 1675, and on the following day took office as advocate-general. On 10 November 1676 he was admitted master of Trinity Hall. He was elected to all three Exclusion Parliaments for the University of Cambridge, being noted as &#145;vile&#146; by the first earl of Shaftesbury. In his first parliament he made several recorded speeches and voted against the <span class="roman">Exclusion Bill</span>. In 1680, together with Sir Richard Lloyd, he printed <span class="italic">The Case of the Merchants Concerned in the Loss of the Ship Virgin</span>. Exton was reappointed advocate-general on the accession of James II and re-elected to parliament for Cambridge University. On 6 July 1686 he was promoted to judge of the Admiralty, and he also succeeded Sir Richard Lloyd as dean of arches. No sooner had he become a judge than he became embroiled in the controversy over the suspension of Dr Sharp for preaching sermons against Catholicism. He reputedly advised King James in favour of suspending the divine, and then advised Bishop Compton that he could safely refuse to comply with the order from the ecclesiastical commission. As a result Exton himself was hauled before the ecclesiastical commissioners in November to justify his conduct, and he lost his Admiralty judgeship in December. In 1688 he gave evidence that the handwriting on the petition of the seven bishops was that of Archbishop Sancroft.<br>
<br>Exton died on 5 November 1688: &#145;his heart was broke through cowardice, for he never looked up after he was put forth of the Admiralty and reprimanded by the commissioners&#146;  (<span class="italic">Downshire MSS</span>, 1.305). He was buried on 8 November in St Benet Paul's Wharf, London. His will, made on 20 March 1688, reflected on his &#145;several losses in my estate&#146;, and thus his inability to add to the portion of his daughter Bridget following her recent marriage to Sir John Sudbury. Most of his estate went to his son, John, who followed the same profession as his father.<br>
