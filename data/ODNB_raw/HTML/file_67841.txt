<span class="headword">Wood,  N&ouml;el Charles Victor  Mewton-</span>  (1922&#150;1953), <span class="occ">concert pianist and composer</span>, was born in the suburb of Hawthorn, Melbourne, Australia, on 20 November 1922, the only child of Frederick William Myles Wood (<i>b</i>. 1882/3), secretary, born in England, and his Australian-born wife, Dulcie Maie, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Mewton (1888&#150;1973). His father, imprisoned for embezzlement when his son was young, appears to have been quickly and quietly forgotten by a mother who was initially dominating, certainly &#145;crafty [and] bossy&#146; according to John Amis, with ambitions for her son  (Amis, <span class="italic">Amiscellany</span>, 210).<br>
<br>Mewton-Wood (as he was always known) received piano lessons from his mother, the fourth generation of musician in the family, then studied at the University Conservatorium of Music in Melbourne from the age of nine, making his first public appearance at twelve. He received his formal education at Carey Baptist Grammar School, Kew, but sailed for England in July 1937 with his mother and funds raised from a public appeal, to study at the Royal Academy of Music. There his tutor for performance was Harold Craxton, and for composition he had Frank Bridge, who had also tutored Benjamin Britten. Connections led to advancement: Mewton-Wood's cousin W. J. R. Turner, critic for the <span class="italic">New Statesman</span> and <span class="italic">Spectator</span>, provided an introduction to Artur Schnabel, and lessons followed with Schnabel in Italy in 1938. After his successful London d&eacute;but playing Beethoven's third piano concerto with Sir Thomas Beecham in the Queen's Hall in March 1940, Beecham reported: &#145;The best talent I've discovered in the British Empire for years: he is exceptional and his technique superb&#146;  (<span class="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</span>, 25 Jan 1941).<br>
<br>After Mewton-Wood was launched into the musical world with such an endorsement his career steadily advanced, despite the range of his other interests. During the war he lived with Nancy and Roger Eckersley (a former BBC controller) in Sussex, helping Nancy to breed geese and Alsatian dogs, memorizing scores, and studying medicine and physics. Turner's earlier daily tutoring had widened Mewton-Wood's grasp of literature, equipping him to recite from memory large amounts of text and poetry. He was interested in clocks and antique furniture, built a marionette theatre, repaired strings in a piano, played tennis, and was a good cook. The conductor Walter Goehr, collaborator in recordings, observed that he spent a great proportion of his later income on modern paintings, adding to the collection bequeathed by Turner. Meanwhile Mewton-Wood spent two years in the Ministry of Information, gave BBC broadcast recitals, and scored two films by his friend Bernard Miles, <span class="italic">Tawny Pipit</span> (1944) and <span class="italic">Chance of a Lifetime</span> (1950). Mother and son sailed to Australia in April 1945 for his only tour there, where he gave the Australian premi&egrave;res of Bartok's sonata for two pianos and percussion and Stravinsky's concerto for two pianos. By the time he was in his early twenties the Australian boy had been transformed into an inquisitive and cultured European man, with little of his native accent intact.<br>
<br>Although the war somewhat restricted his career advancement Mewton-Wood toured throughout Britain, performing as a soloist and accompanist, in chamber groups and with orchestras, and playing at nineteen Proms between 1942 and 1953. Myra Hess and Howard Ferguson invited him to participate in the lunchtime National Gallery concerts, Hess observing that &#145;his versatility was staggering. He could dazzle one with sheer brilliance and move one deeply by his sensitive poetical qualities&#146;  (<span class="italic">Yorkshire Post and Leeds Mercury</span>, 7 Dec 1953). His performing repertoire was wide, including championing then unfashionable works (Weber, Schubert, Tchaikovsky) and&#151;to a greater extent than most of his contemporaries&#151;&#145;modern&#146; composers, from Europe (Prokofiev, Hindemith, Hans Werner Henze) and Britain (Walton, Rawthorne, Lambert, Gerhard, Searle), with many works performed as premi&egrave;res. He formed close creative relationships with Arthur Bliss and Michael Tippett. Britten entrusted him with performing the revised version of his own piano concerto at the 1946 Cheltenham Festival; and first performances of works by Tippett and Alan Bush featured outstanding collaborations with Dennis Brain and Peter Pears. In 1952&#150;3, when Britten's focus was on composing <span class="italic">Gloriana</span>, Mewton-Wood became Pears's &#145;second accompanist&#146; after Britten: his sensitivity and interpretative powers were given a further stamp of approval by inclusion in Britten's Aldeburgh &#145;court&#146; and participation in the Aldeburgh Festivals of 1948 and 1951 to 1953.<br>
<br>Approval and inclusion in these social circles were also facilitated by Mewton-Wood's homosexuality. Amis saw little flamboyance in his manner, apart from a later trait of wearing medallions on chains. He was tall, &#145;godlike&#146;, with an &#145;energetic aplomb [that] distinguished everything he said or did&#146;  (Sackville-West). George Harwood thought him kind and sympathetic, with a driving ambition and an enthusiasm and instinct to bring people to the music he loved. But &#145;the jokes, the friendliness, the high spirits&#146; masked a &#145;profound melancholy he was too unselfish to inflict on his friends&#146;  (ibid.). The reasons for these feelings of inadequacy were complex: partly innate self-doubt, and partly not being selected more frequently for high-profile concerts, and not having a significant recording contract. Amis believed that performing &#145;modern&#146; works perhaps lessened Mewton-Wood's appeal as a performer. Perhaps he was psychologically affected&#151;or felt socially compromised&#151;by the anti-homosexual climate in Britain: he was certainly known to the police for his public sexual improprieties. By the early 1950s, however, he had set up a London home with William Lang Fedrick, his partner from approximately 1946, an exhibitions officer at the British Council.<br>
<br>Self-doubt and a highly strung emotional nature were aspects of Mewton-Wood's personality that influenced his actions: self-harm was clearly a feature of his psychological make-up. In Germany after the war, believing he had lost the ability to memorize scores, he cut his wrists. In November 1953 Fedrick, who might have had traits of hypochondria, developed appendicitis, was hospitalized too late, and died on Mewton-Wood's thirty-first birthday. Mewton-Wood, blaming himself for not acting quickly enough to prevent his partner's death, took an overdose of aspirin&#151;then appealed for help to his doctor, Patrick Trevor-Roper. In spite of care and monitoring by Trevor-Roper and others, including psychiatric treatment in hospital, on 5 December 1953 Mewton-Wood ingested alcohol and prussic acid and died immediately. Strewn around the music room where he lay were forty or so notes to friends. A coroner's inquest and a funeral at Golders Green crematorium were both held on 11 December 1953.<br>
<br>With his death Mewton-Wood provided an important catalyst: composers wrote in his memory, and unusually for a classical musician a novel (Sonia Orchard's <span class="italic">The Virtuoso</span>, 2009) was based closely on his life. Amis requested compositions for a concert marking the first anniversary of the death: Bliss's <span class="italic">Elegiac Sonnet</span> (with Cecil Day Lewis's specially written words) and works by Bush were played, together with a song by Mewton-Wood; but the most significant piece dedicated and performed was from Britten, the <span class="italic">Canticle III: Still Falls the Rain</span>, with a text by Edith Sitwell, elegiac and subdued in mood, for tenor voice (Pears), French horn (Brain), and piano (Britten). Thereafter works written for or dedicated to Mewton-Wood followed from Tippett, Werner Henze, Anthony Hopkins, and others, and Amis consistently kept alive Mewton-Wood's art, in writings and in BBC radio programmes in the 1980s and 1990s.<br>
