<span class="headword">Fitzthomas,  Thomas</span>  (<em>d.</em> in or before 1276), <span class="occ">mayor of London</span>, was a draper with considerable property in the city, whose family had been part of its aldermanic ruling class since at least the 1220s. That class, composed largely of drapers, pepperers, goldsmiths, mercers, and vintners, controlled the city through its hold over the offices of mayor, sheriff, and alderman. Fitzthomas was appointed alderman in the late 1240s, and in 1257&#150;8 served as sheriff. During this period the city's rulers enjoyed mixed relations with Henry III. Some were closely linked to him through the goods and provisions that they supplied to the royal household. Others resented and resisted his attempts to tax the city and bestow market privileges on Westminster Abbey. Early in 1258, when the king attacked his enemies among the city's rulers, Fitzthomas escaped unscathed.<br>
<br>Fitzthomas held the office of mayor for the first time in October 1261 and was reappointed in October 1262, the years in which the king dominated London, having thrown off the restrictions imposed on him by the provisions of Oxford in 1258. In June 1263, however, when Simon de Montfort (<i>d</i>. 1265) resurrected the cause of the provisions and advanced on the capital, Fitzthomas placed himself at the head of &#145;the people&#146; who had taken to the streets in Montfort's support. Thereafter, until the battle of Evesham in August 1265, he helped to make London a bulwark of the Montfortian regime. Fitzthomas based his power on a militia and a revived folkmoot, the traditional assembly of all the citizens, whose vitality had been sapped under the aldermanic regime. Now the aldermen and magnates of the city were ignored as the folkmoot elected Fitzthomas mayor in October 1263 and again in October 1264. It also ratified ordinances that allowed various crafts for the first time to organize their activities. It was these crafts&#151;cordwainers, girdlers, fishmongers, wool-packers, for example&#151;that formed the heart of the popular movement, having greatly expanded in numbers during the previous hundred years yet been excluded from political power and forbidden to organize by the aldermen.<br>
<br>There was nothing lukewarm in Fitzthomas's role in the revolutionary regime. In March 1265, when he renewed his oath of fealty to the king (then in effect a captive in Montfort's power), he made clear &#145;before the people&#146; that his loyalty was highly conditional: &#145;For as long as you will be a good lord and king to us&#146;, he told Henry III, &#145;we will be faithful and devoted to you&#146;  (<span class="italic">De antiquis legibus liber</span>, 72&#150;3). After the battle of Evesham, Fitzthomas and his leading colleagues were imprisoned by Prince Edward (later Edward I). The people of the city did not forget him, however. In April 1266, when the leading citizens were allowed to choose the staunch royalist and former mayor William Fitzrichard as custodian of London, the people called instead for Thomas Fitzthomas. He was finally released from prison two years later, on payment to Edward of a fine of &pound;500.<br>
<br>Just why Fitzthomas threw in his lot so completely with Montfort and the popular movement in the city is unclear. He had links with the rulers purged by the king in 1258, some of whom likewise emerged as Montfortians in 1263. On the other hand, he himself had escaped the purge; he was also a nephew of William Fitzrichard, and was clearly considered completely reliable by the king until 1263. Whatever the reasons, Fitzthomas played a central part in committing London to the cause of Simon de Montfort between 1263 and 1265. He died in or shortly before 1276, leaving one son heavily in debt and another living outside London.<br>
