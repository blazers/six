<span class="headword">Coleman <span class="st"> [Colman]</span>,  Walter</span>  (1600&#150;1645), <span class="occ">Franciscan friar, missionary, and writer</span>, was born in 1600 in Cannock, Staffordshire, the son of Walter Coleman (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1620) and his second wife, Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1618), daughter of Humphrey Whitgreave; his mother's family later sheltered Charles II at Mosley Hall near Wolverhampton in 1651. He had a brother named John and a sister, Dorothy. In September 1616 he was sent to the English College at Douai, where he was known as Walter Whitgreave; it seems that the boys there often used their mothers' names. A companion of his was Christopher Davenport, who joined the Franciscans the following year, and would later welcome Walter into the order. In 1617 Walter was said to have been sent to Louvain to escape the plague. He returned to England, but was later back on the continent to continue his education, and after the deaths of his parents he became a Franciscan at Douai in 1625, taking the name Christopher.<br>
<br>After his religious profession, probably in 1626, and his ordination to the priesthood he was sent back to England about 1630. On landing he was stopped and searched. His unusual clothing aroused suspicion, and his refusal to take the oath of allegiance got him thrown into prison; but he was bailed out by friends and was able to proceed to London. During his ministry there he took up again the writing of verse and, completing a work he had already begun, he published about 1632 <span class="italic">La dance machabre, or, Death's Duel</span>, which he dedicated to Queen Henrietta Maria. In it he was concerned with the need to prepare well for death and descanted on vices and virtues, as St Francis had told his friars to do. He prefixed the poem with the commendations of James Shirley and others.<br>
<br>After labouring as a missioner for some years Coleman returned to Douai for rest and recollection, and while there he prepared for the press a book in verse on the religious controversies of the time and also translated into English a life of St Angela; however, copies of these works were not found by Richard Mason, his contemporary biographer. Having spent some more years at Douai, Coleman went back to England about 1640 in disguise. An affable man, he mingled easily with others. However, he was eventually picked up by the priest hunters, and on 8 December 1641, on trial with six other priests, he was condemned on the testimony of one Wadsworth to be hanged, drawn, and quartered on 13 December. The French ambassador intervened on their behalf, and King Charles I asked parliament to pardon them; parliament wanted them condemned, but the king put the responsibility for this on parliament's shoulders, and nothing was done. One of the priests died that December. The civil war was disastrous for the others in prison. Coleman remained in Newgate, where he died in 1645.<br>
