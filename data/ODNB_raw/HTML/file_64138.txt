<span class="headword">Stuart,  John</span>, first marquess of Bute  (1744&#150;1814), <span class="occ">diplomatist</span>, was born at Mount Stuart on the Isle of Bute, Scotland, on 30 June 1744, the eldest of the eight surviving children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26716/', "John Stuart, third earl of Bute (1713&#150;1792)")</script>, prime minister, and his wife, Mary Wortley Montagu (1718&#150;1794), who was created Baroness Mount Stuart in 1761. His siblings included <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26697/', "Sir Charles Stuart (1753&#150;1801)")</script>, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26727/', "William Stuart, archbishop of Armagh")</script>, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/42015/', "Lady Louisa Stuart")</script>. He was educated at Harrow School and Winchester College and was privately tutored by the Revd James Bladen at Oxford; he was later an honorary DCL of Oxford University in 1793. His grand tour (1761&#150;5), from which he returned tall and handsome, included studies in the Netherlands and Geneva and travels in Italy together with James Boswell. He successfully courted a wealthy heiress, Charlotte Jane (1746&#150;1800), daughter of Herbert Hickman Windsor, second Viscount Windsor and Baron Mountjoy (<i>bap</i>. 1707, <i>d</i>. 1758), and Alice Clavering (<i>bap</i>. 1705, <i>d</i>. 1776). They married at St John's Chapel, Hanover Square, London, on 12 November 1766; four of their seven sons and one of two daughters survived infancy.<br>
<br>Following the deaths of his wife's parents the Windsor estates in south Wales passed to Stuart, who restored Cardiff Castle and was created Baron Cardiff on 20 May 1776. He vacated his seat in the Commons for Bossiney, which he had held on his mother's interest since 1766. Following his father politically he supported successive ministries after Rockingham's, but was miffed by Lord North's indifference towards him. Even North's support did not avail him to carry the <span class="roman">Scottish Militia Bill</span> in 1776. In the Lords he was a firm supporter of war with the American colonies, but he was critical of civil list provisions, and his speeches in support of the ministry tailed off after 1778. He served as lord lieutenant of Glamorgan from 1772 to 1793, and again from 1794, together with the lord lieutenancy of Bute, until his death, and raised a company for the war in America. Sworn of the privy council on 4 August 1779, he proceeded to Turin as envoy, styled Lord Mountstuart, for three years. Appointed auditor of the imprest in 1781, he received &pound;7000 a year compensation for its abolition in 1785. He was named ambassador to Spain in 1783, but did not take up his post until 1795&#150;6, by which time he had succeeded his parents to their titles, in 1792 and 1794, and changed his politics when he joined Portland in defecting to Pitt in 1794. He had previously supported the coalition ministry of 1783 as a Portland whig and continued in opposition after Pitt came to power, a position which alienated the king's favour. A mortgage on Luton Park prejudiced his inheritance and he attempted to regain the king's favour in 1792&#150;3. His diplomatic service in Spain and support of the ministry from 1794 onwards led to his creation as first marquess of Bute on 27 February 1796, before Spain's alliance with France brought him home.<br>
<br>In 1798 Bute renounced diplomacy and petitioned unsuccessfully for the position of lord steward. He failed to receive the Garter in 1799. A fellow of the Society of Antiquaries from 1776 he became a fellow of the Royal Society in 1799 and, in 1800, a trustee of the British Museum. His wife died suddenly of apoplexy on 28 January 1800 and Bute married, on 17 September 1800, Frances (1772/3&#150;1832), daughter and coheir of Thomas Coutts, banker, and his first wife, Susan Starkie; they had a son and a daughter. Bute reverted to political opposition and joined the prince of Wales, who made him one of his councillors of state in 1800. He died at Geneva on 16 November 1814, and was buried on 20 December in the Bute vault at Roath, Cardiff.<br>
