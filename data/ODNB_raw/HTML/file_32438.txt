</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Clay, Sir  Henry</span>  (1883&#150;1954), <span class="occ">economist</span>, was the third son and fourth child of James Henry Clay and his wife, Elizabeth Bulmer, of Bradford. He was born on 9 May 1883 in Germany, near M&uuml;nchen-Gladbach. His father, a woollen manufacturer, had formed the firm of Goetz, Clay &amp; Co., a partnership that lasted for eight years before the Clays returned to Yorkshire with their two girls and four boys. Henry Clay went to Bradford grammar school, which he left as head boy to go as a scholar to University College, Oxford, in 1902.<br>
<br>Disappointed of his immediate hopes of an academic career because of his second class in <i>literae humaniores</i> (1906), Clay became, first, secretary to a London charity organization, then, for two years, warden of the neighbourhood guild settlement in Sheffield. Between 1909 and 1917 he lectured for the Workers' Educational Association under the university extension scheme, an experience that led to the writing of <span class="italic">Economics: an Introduction for the General Reader</span> (1916; 2nd edn, 1942). The book had great success, especially in Great Britain and the United States, and, by reason of its clarity and real-world examples, broadened public interest in economic matters.<br>
<br>Clay was a temporary civil servant between 1917 and 1919 in the newly established Ministry of Labour, where he worked closely on industrial relations and other labour problems with H. D. Butler, later director of the International Labour Office. From 1919 to 1921 he was a fellow of New College, Oxford, and a special correspondent on industrial questions to the New York <span class="italic">Evening Post</span>. During his first visit to America in 1921 he made close friendships with some outstanding young economists, especially Lewis Douglas and Walter Stewart, which he maintained throughout his life.<br>
<br>In 1922 Clay became the Stanley Jevons professor of political economy at Manchester, and the following eight years there were academically very productive for him. They marked something of a golden age for the economics department, which both developed its links to the local community and became a centre of excellence in applied economics. In 1925 he went to South Africa as a member of the Economic and Wage Commission, and was largely responsible for the subsequent report. This was to be the first of many commissions, at home and abroad, to act as an arbitrator and adviser.<br>
<br>In 1927 Clay asked to exchange his chair for the new professorship of social economics established through the generosity of E. D. Simon, a post that would relieve him of administrative duties, which did not interest him. He was never happy with large groups or in the public lecture. He perceived that applied economics could be strengthened by closer regular contacts between economists and business people, and he instituted his Manchester Thursday lunches as a successful pioneering effort. It was the influence of such business networks, together with his close observation of local industries (especially the Lancashire cotton industry), much more than his subscribing to any particular school of theoretical economics, that made Clay pre-eminently a man of affairs and a very practical economist. He was thus more at home writing balanced treatments of contemporary economic issues for the <span class="italic">Manchester Guardian</span>&#151;where his swift and polished productions were something of a marvel even to its seasoned staff&#151;than reviews and articles in the learned journals, though (when public duties permitted) he was a frequent contributor to the <span class="italic">Manchester School of Economic and Social Studies</span> and to the <span class="italic">Economic Journal</span>, the journal of the Royal Economic Society, upon whose council he served for a quarter of a century.<br>
<br>Clay was not a foremost economic theorist. Indeed, he often expressed doubts about the value of much of the theorizing then in fashion. As he told Edwin Cannan, another leading economist who shared his structural diagnosis of Britain's industrial problems, he<blockquote>always felt that as a Professor of Economics I was a fraud &hellip; My reading of English economics has been scrappy &hellip; I don't know enough mathematics to follow our Cambridge friends, however suspicious I may be of their results; and I cannot suppress my interest in current political and social questions sufficiently to stick to any one part of the field of economics and so do some serious work on it. (Casson, 18&#150;19)</blockquote>He was a tool-user rather than a tool-designer&#151;and frequently impatient of the tools provided. Representative of this phase are <span class="italic">The Post-War Unemployment Problem</span> (1929) and <span class="italic">The Problem of Industrial Relations</span> (1929).<br>
<br>In 1930 Clay resigned his chair to join the Bank of England, in the first instance as adviser to the newly established Securities Management Trust, a bank subsidiary charged with financing and promoting the rationalization of the depressed staple industries, problems upon which Clay was now especially qualified to advise. In 1930&#150;31 he was a member of the royal commission on unemployment insurance. In 1933 he went with Sir Otto Niemeyer to Argentina to advise on the organization of its banking system. Clay's shrewd advice and his knack of getting on with people, especially with Montagu Norman, led to his appointment in the same year as economic adviser to the governor of the Bank of England. In practice he had been discharging this broader advisory role since the financial crisis of the summer of 1931, which had led, much to his consternation, to Britain's forced abandonment of the gold standard. Temperamentally Clay and Norman were poles apart: the governor a prima donna, Clay gentle, scholarly, sensitive, and undogmatic. Yet in many ways their views ran parallel, and Clay's pragmatic capacity for swift and clear draftsmanship must have been a godsend to Norman, whose inadequacy in expression was in sharp contrast to his considerable powers of thought and decision.<br>
<br>Clay and Norman shared the opinion that, necessary as was a proper budgetary and monetary framework, financial ingenuity by governments in the form of large-scale loan-financed public works did not offer a long-term solution to the problems of British industry. They believed that the solution lay more on the supply side, where widespread inefficiencies in the use of capital and labour resulted in high costs and low productivity, problems that were being addressed by the bank in its promotion of industrial rationalization. Ostensibly both men were antipathetic towards the solution for unemployment being developed by J. M. Keynes, but, as we now know from the Per Jacobsson diaries and from Sayers's official history of the bank, through Clay, Norman came to favour a controlled demand expansion by Keynesian means, while by 1936 Clay had &#145;made himself a monetary economist of a stature that went unrecognised by the academic world from which he had been so completely withdrawn&#146;  (Sayers, <span class="italic">Bank of England</span>, 2.462, 489). Clay's, as Norman's, openness to new economic ideas is confirmed by their later joint support for Keynes's influential plan, <span class="italic">How to Pay for the War</span> (1940).<br>
<br>With Lord Stamp, Clay was one of the most active in the establishment in 1938 of the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, and he guided its research as chairman of its council (1940&#150;49) and later president (1949&#150;52). Shortly before the outbreak of war Stamp was called upon by the government to produce a broad survey of national economic resources, and Clay and Hubert Henderson were his chief assistants in an organization that became the forerunner of the economic section and the central statistical office in the cabinet secretariat. Many of Clay's former Manchester colleagues and students were recruited: their applied economics skills were exactly those required for administering the war economy. After Stamp was killed in an air raid in 1941, Clay went to the Board of Trade as economic adviser and later to the Ministry of War Transport.<br>
<br>In 1944 Clay left Whitehall to become the second warden of Nuffield College, Oxford, in succession to his former colleague H. D. Butler. He took particular pleasure in the appointment of visiting fellows chosen for their practical experience in the professions, industry, or commerce. He was successful in gaining the confidence of Lord Nuffield, who was not at that stage entirely happy about the development of his benefaction. The foundation-stone of the permanent building was not laid until 1949, just before Clay retired; his success as warden, especially with those small groups with which he was always happiest, was despite the temporary and limited premises in which the college was forced to operate.<br>
<br>Clay was knighted in 1946, and after his early retirement from the wardenship of Nuffield he continued to enjoy a busy life. He became part-time economic adviser to Unilever; he was actively engaged in the collection and editing of Sir Hubert Henderson's papers (published posthumously as <span class="italic">The Interwar Years and other Papers</span>, 1955); and he pursued his work on a biography of Lord Norman (published posthumously in 1957 and described by Sayers as Clay's best and most important book).<br>
<br>Clay's writings from his first and famous book in 1916 to the papers unfinished at his death show the main lines of his thinking unbroken. He was in many ways a Gladstonian Liberal, believing that private enterprise was the most efficient form of organizing production, that the liberty of the individual would be endangered by the continued growth of government, and that Britain should maintain its historic internationalism in its economic policies. However, his friendliness and complete absence of stridency in whatever he said or wrote tended to conceal the strength of his convictions, while his pragmatism and inventiveness made him open to policy experimentation in times of national emergency. His views diverged from the main stream of contemporary Liberal economic thought in at least two ways: in his doubts about the practical results of the Keynesian solution to unemployment or more especially of the views of some of Keynes's disciples; secondly, concerning industrial monopoly. Clay was not prepared to agree that a competitive system would inevitably degenerate into monopoly unless safeguarded by the state: anti-monopoly legislation in his view was unnecessary, inexpedient, and inequitable.<br>
<br>Clay's greatest joys were found in his family circle. In 1910 he married Gladys (<i>d</i>. 1941), the eldest daughter of Arthur Priestman, a worsted manufacturer, of Bradford; they had three sons and a daughter. Clay had a passion for sailing and the whole family would be taken, first on the broads, later on more venturesome journeys on the high seas. Outside this intimate family group was a vast circle of friends drawn by the charm of his wife and by Henry Clay's own kindness, modesty, and most entertaining conversational gifts. Although in later years he became something of a man of affairs, he retained the habits and enthusiasms of the scholar; nor might he be mistaken for anything else. Outside economics he was especially interested in architecture, painting, and music. He could never resist a second-hand bookshelf and he collected a large library, which included many bargains. His personal needs reflected his solid Yorkshire upbringing and he was the most economical of men. His first wife died in 1941, and in 1951 he married Rosalind, widow of E. Murray Wrong (the son of G. M. Wrong) and daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36129/', "A. L. Smith")</script>, sometime master of Balliol. They spent three extremely happy years together before Clay's death, on 30 July 1954, as a result of a street accident in Middelburg, the Netherlands, where he had gone to join his children for a North Sea trip in the family yacht.<br>
