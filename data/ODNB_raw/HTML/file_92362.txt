<span class="headword">Cuffe <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Bischoffsheim]</span>,  Ellen Odette</span>, countess of Desart  (1857&#150;1933), <span class="occ">philanthropist and politician</span>, was born at 18 Cornwall Terrace, Marylebone, London, on 1 September 1857, the eldest of two daughters of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/38343/', "Henry Louis Bischoffsheim (1829&#150;1908)")</script>, banker and philanthropist, and his wife, Clara (or Clarissa) Biedermann (1837&#150;1922) of Vienna. The Bischoffsheim sisters were tutored at home and their education was supplemented by foreign travel. They were also exposed to a lively and stimulating social life at their London home whose soir&eacute;es attracted many of the prominent political and artistic figures of the day. Well-known benefactors, their parents also instilled in their daughters a dedication to good works and a particular commitment to Jewish charities.<br>
<br>On 27 April 1881 Ellen Bischoffsheim became the second wife of the divorced William Ulick O'Connor Cuffe, fourth earl of Desart (1845&#150;1898), an Irish peer and novelist. After their fashionable wedding at Christ Church, Mayfair, the couple went to live at Desart Court in co. Kilkenny, a large estate of almost 9000 acres and a considerable tenantry. Lady Desart was warmly welcomed by local citizens; it was rumoured that she had brought with her a dowry of &pound;150,000, with the promise of a similar sum on her father's death. During the first few years of their married life, the couple (who had no children) enjoyed a lively social life in Kilkenny, becoming involved in local sporting and agricultural events. They appeared, however, to spend much of their time in England until the earl's death in September 1898.<br>
<br>Lady Desart threw herself into philanthropic work, dividing her energies between Jewish and general charities. She lived at the family's country seat in Berkshire, but retained her links with Ireland of which she had become very fond. With her brother-in-law, Captain Otway Cuffe (1853&#150;1912), she worked on a number of civic and cultural projects in Kilkenny. The first was the erection in 1902 of a theatre, the entire cost of which was born by Lady Desart; in 1910 she purchased a site and paid for the furnishings for a new public library.<br>
<br>Lady Desart also became a patron of the Gaelic League and the Irish revival more generally, funding the teaching of the Irish language locally and supplying prizes for competence in it. Though she herself never mastered the language, she saw a parallel with Hebrew, another almost obsolete language which had been successfully resurrected. She and Otway Cuffe persuaded the novelist and cultural activist Standish O'Grady to assume the editorship of the <span class="italic">Kilkenny Moderator</span>, a lively publication which supported the Irish language revival. O'Grady became embroiled in what became known as the &#145;county scandal&#146; during which he publicly defended the reputation of Lady Desart's late husband who had been accused of financial impropriety. The arrival of writs eventually forced him to give up the <span class="italic">Moderator</span>, but not without strengthening Lady Desart's determination to contribute to the enrichment of local life. Her own literary career was limited to the publication of <span class="italic">A Guide for Secretaries, Public and Private</span>, co-written in 1924, and articles in various magazines, but she remained a patron of many Kilkenny authors, including Francis Hackett, who dedicated his <span class="italic">Ireland: a Study in Nationalism</span> (1918) to her.<br>
<br>Lady Desart's most important contribution to the Irish revival was her funding of local industries. She promoted the establishment of the Kilkenny Woollen Mills and the Kilkenny Woodworkers. Under her sponsorship and supervision, an estate of 300 thatched houses which became known as the &#145;garden village&#146; was built to house mill workers. By 1912 she had bought much of the surrounding property, adding a bridge, a road, a water reservoir, and a social club for workers. Her generosity to her local community was recognized in 1911 when the freedom of the city of Kilkenny was conferred on her. Deeply moved by this tribute, she claimed that she was the first woman and the only Jewess to have been so honoured.<br>
<br>Desart returned permanently to Aut Even, Kilkenny, in 1912, taking up residence at her newly built estate which was situated close to the garden village and about 10 miles from Desart Court. She took on an even more prominent role in local affairs after the death of her brother-in-law, assuming many of his public roles and responsibilities including the chairmanship of the woollen mills and the presidency of the local branch of the Gaelic League. In 1915 she built a hospital near her private residence which was dedicated to the memory of her brother-in-law, visiting it at least once a day until she died. Her interest in dairy farming was recognized by her presidency of the Irish Dairy Shorthorn Breeders' Association.<br>
<br>Ellen Desart became more widely known as a leading and vocal opponent of the <span class="roman">Insurance Acts</span> introduced in 1911 and 1912. She became president of the Insurance Tax Resisters' Defence Association, and refused to collect the tax from the Kilkenny Woodworkers. As a result, one of her horses was seized and sold at the insistence of the insurance commissioners. She was particularly opposed to the taxation of domestic servants, writing to Lloyd George about the issue. Her next public political stand revolved around women's suffrage to which she was firmly opposed. In May 1913 she presided over the annual general meeting of the National League for Opposing Woman Suffrage held in Dublin. She was particularly horrified at the exploits of militant suffragists, lamenting that the age of chivalry was lost.<br>
<br>A dedicated unionist, Desart was alarmed by the political events which led to Irish independence, but adjusted to the new disposition with little protest. She took less interest in the Gaelic League and other revivalist projects after independence, dedicating more time instead to her garden village and establishing there a private school and a spacious recreation hall. Her former home, Desart Court, was vandalized and torched, one of many homes of prominent Anglo-Irish families to suffer this fate at the hands of republicans during the Irish civil war. It may have been targeted because Lady Desart had in 1922 accepted a position in the senate of the Irish Free State, having been nominated by the president, W. T. Cosgrave, in recognition of her cultural and economic work for Ireland. She was not a frequent speaker in the senate, but she did famously protest against the proposed ban on divorce in 1925.<br>
<br>Lady Desart remained true to her Jewish upbringing, maintaining her attachment to the West London Synagogue. In 1930 she wrote an impassioned letter to the <span class="italic">Jewish Guardian</span>, objecting to the implication that she had deserted her faith, and claiming that she remained a &#145;committed and practising Jew&#146;. She served on the committees of a number of Jewish charities including the Jewish Association for the Protection of Women and Girls and the Jews' Temporary Shelter, as well as serving as vice-president of both the Montefiore Home School for Jewish Girls and the Union of Jewish Women (UK).<br>
<br>Described by one commentator as &#145;plump and plain&#146; in her old age, Lady Desart apparently had a guttural voice and poor eyesight, forcing her to wear very strong pince-nez. She nevertheless maintained a high public profile, mainly through her philanthropic work. After suffering from a serious illness for some time, Lady Desart died at 1 Waterloo Road, Dublin, on 29 June 1933. She was buried next to her husband at Falmouth cemetery. The funeral service, at her request, was conducted according to Jewish rites.<br>
