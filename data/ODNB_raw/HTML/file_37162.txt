<span class="headword">Bate,  Robert Brettell</span>  (1782&#150;1847), <span class="occ">maker of scientific instruments</span>, was born in Old Swinford, Worcestershire, on 27 February 1782, the third of four sons of Overs Bate, mercer and banker of Old Swinford, and his wife, Susannah Brettell. Both his parents came from prosperous merchant and landowning families. No record of his schooling or any apprenticeship has been found, but by 1804 he was in London, living with his uncle, a haberdasher. On 11 February 1804 he married his cousin Anna Maria, daughter of Benjamin Sikes, a collector of excise living in Clerkenwell. They had five children: Mary, Bartholomew (apprenticed to his father in 1822), Anna Maria, John, and Ann, who in 1843 married Richard Thomas Staples-Brown. Shortly before Sikes's death in 1803 his improved hydrometer had been adopted by the government excise department for revenue purposes. The right to supply this instrument passed to his family, and thus Bate, as nephew and son-in-law, was appointed mathematical instrument maker to HM excise, a privilege later extended to his widow.<br>
<br>In 1813 the Clockmakers' Company, having observed that Bate had opened a shop where he was selling sundials and other mathematical instruments, summoned him to take up his freedom within that company. Bate's response was to enrol in the Spectaclemakers' Company, an action which became the subject of the test case in the notorious dispute between these two companies, as to which should control the makers and the retailers of mathematical instruments. When judgment was finally delivered in November 1817, Bate was described as a maker of spectacles, but a retailer of other mathematical instruments. He continued this profitable line of business and examples of virtually all types of optical, mathematical, and philosophical instruments bearing his signature are known.<br>
<br>Bate was admitted to the Spectaclemakers' livery in 1822, moving up through the ranks to become master in 1828&#150;30, thereafter sitting in the court of assistants. He was appointed optician in ordinary to King George IV, this post being renewed on the accessions of William IV and Queen Victoria. Helped by eminent scientists, Bate worked continually to improve the hydrometers and his skills were acknowledged when he was asked to make the models for the new standard weights and measures of capacity enacted by parliament in 1825 to replace existing ancient local measures. Bate and Henry Kater worked on these models in 1825&#150;6, and subsequently Bate supplied hundreds of sets of standards to government and municipal offices throughout the United Kingdom and overseas. He also made bullion balances for the Bank of England, the East India Company, and other establishments. John Bate stood in for his father during his frequent absences&#151;he suffered from chronic bronchitis&#151;giving evidence to several parliamentary commissions on weights and measures before his own early death from consumption in 1840.<br>
<br>Appointed sole Admiralty chart agent in 1830, Bate was co-publisher of the <span class="italic">Nautical Magazine</span> during its early years, and he wrote and/or published navigation books and some dozen handbooks concerning apparatus which he sold. He retailed mathematical, scientific, and optical instruments, collaborating with David Brewster on the kaleidoscope (1816), and took out patents for hydrometers and spectacle frames. The firm traded from 17 Poultry, in the City of London, from 1807, moving to larger premises at 20&#150;21 in 1820 where a workforce of some twenty people was employed. In later years Bate also rented a house in Hampstead, where he died on 27 December 1847. His widow ran the firm until 1850, closing it down shortly before her own death in 1851. Bate and his wife were buried at St John, Clerkenwell, as were several members of their families.<br>
<br>Bate and his family had various properties and business interests in the west midlands. He was a partner in his brother John Henzey Bate's unsuccessful Eagle Furnace Company of Dudley, and he maintained an interest in the family bank, which traded as Hill, Hill, Bate and Robins, later as Bate and Robins. It was purchased by Midland Bank in 1851.<br>
