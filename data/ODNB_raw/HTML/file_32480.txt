</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Cohen,  Harriet Pearl Alice</span>  (1895&#150;1967), <span class="occ">pianist</span>, was born on 2 December 1895 at 58 Angell Road, Brixton, London, the eldest daughter of Joseph Woolf Cohen, company secretary, and his wife, Florence White. The soprano (Kathleen Irene) Myra Verney (1905&#150;1993) was her younger sister. An amateur cellist and composer, her father was of Lithuanian extraction. Her mother, a gifted pianist herself, taught Harriet the piano until the child was thirteen.<br>
<br>Harriet Cohen entered the Royal Academy of Music in 1909, the youngest student to win the Ada Lewis scholarship. She studied with Felix Swinstead and Tobias Matthay for the piano and Frederick Corder for theory and composition. She remained at the academy, and also at the Matthay School, until 1915; during that time she became associated with her piano professor, Tobias Matthay, as a teacher of other students. While at the academy her string of awards included the Sterndale Bennett, Edward Nicholls, and Hine prizes. She was part of a group based on current and former students of the academy&#151;which included the composer <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30645/', "Arnold Edward Trevor Bax (1883&#150;1953)")</script>&#151;who responded to the craze for things Russian when the Diaghilev ballet visited London between 1911 and 1914, and she became known as Tania to her friends.<br>
<br>During the First World War, Cohen and Bax carried on a love affair. In March 1918, in consequence of the developing relationship, Bax left his wife and children, though he and Cohen never lived together, and she never married. Harriet Cohen's London d&eacute;but was in a joint recital with the soprano Raymonde Collignon at the Aeolian Hall in June 1919, <span class="italic">The Times</span> writing: &#145;&hellip; lightest of light sopranos&#151;delicate and rarified perfection. Miss Harriet Cohen is a pianist something after the same style&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 7 June 1919). However, Cohen's pianism was constrained by her small hands and the webbing of her fingers. She was launched on the concert scene in 1920, appearing in the repertory that coloured her career: a combination of the revival of Bach and the keyboard music of the Elizabethans played on the piano, as well as the new music of the day. In Arthur Bliss's &#145;Storm&#146; for Shakespeare's <span class="italic">The Tempest</span>, scored for piano, percussion, trumpet, and trombone, in 1921, her part proved so vigorous that she smashed a thumbnail.<br>
<br>Harriet Cohen appeared at the Queen's Hall, London, in a solo recital in June 1920 with Bax's newly revised piano sonata no. 2, and in November that year reappeared with his enormous <span class="italic">Symphonic Variations</span> for piano and orchestra. Arnold Bennett, one of many admirers, noted in his diary, &#145;Such an ovation I have never before seen at a Prom&#146;  (<span class="italic">Journals</span>, 2). She was soon associated with other similar modern works, notably Manuel de Falla's <span class="italic">Noches en los jardines de Espa&ntilde;a</span> (&#145;Nights in the Gardens of Spain&#146;), and later music by Shostakovich and Kabalevsky.<br>
<br>Her striking good looks also contributed to Cohen's early success, which placed her at the focus of the London artistic life of the early 1920s. She proved a celebrated organizer of musical parties. Here she integrated the literary and musical worlds, her guests including Bennett and George Bernard Shaw. She promoted the revival of Tudor church music and integrated the world of the Russian ballet into the London scene, particularly being associated with the ballerina Tamara Karsavina, for whom she first played in 1920. In 1924 Harriet Cohen appeared at the Salzburg chamber music festival of the International Society for Contemporary Music.<br>
<br>Harriet Cohen's early success was interrupted by illness, and in 1925 she spent some time at a TB clinic in Switzerland. By the time of her return to England in 1926 the relationship between her and Bax had somewhat cooled, though they appeared in public together until his death. She toured extensively and tended to be the chosen artist when new British works were played, appearing for example in Germany in July 1930 in an all-British programme playing William Walton's <span class="italic">Sinfonia concertante</span>, conducted by Constant Lambert.<br>
<br>Harriet Cohen recorded for Columbia and became well known in the 1930s for her pioneering recordings of Bach's preludes and fugues. Her other recordings included Mozart, Brahms, and Chopin. However, many of the surviving recordings of her playing, including the Bach keyboard concerto in D minor for which she was celebrated in her day, were made in the years immediately after the Second World War and possibly do not find her at her peak. In 1931 a dozen British composers were persuaded to contribute arrangements of various works of Bach for <span class="italic">A Bach Book for Harriet Cohen</span>, which was published in 1932; the pieces were first heard at the Queen's Hall in October 1932.<br>
<br>In 1932 Harriet Cohen gave the first performance of Bax's second major work for piano and orchestra, <span class="italic">Winter Legends</span>, though it was seldom played thereafter. In February 1933 she gave the first performance of the Vaughan Williams piano concerto. This work, too, was little played, and in 1942 Sir Adrian Boult noted in a BBC internal memo:<blockquote>It is surely common knowledge that Harriet Cohen's performance of the &hellip; Concerto caused it to be completely dropped &hellip; the work &hellip; was laid out for a pianist of the Busoni calibre, and although she made a very valiant effort, she could get nowhere near the spirit of it, or even the notes in many passages. (facsimile in Foreman, pl. 7)</blockquote>Harriet Cohen had been associated with Sir Edward Elgar from the time when they both had lived in Hampstead; and in May 1933 she organized a Wigmore Hall concert in which all three of his mature chamber works (the violin sonata, the string quartet, and the piano quintet) were presented. This resulted in her recording the quintet with the Stratton Quartet. In 1936 Cohen published <span class="italic">Music's Handmaid</span>, in which she discussed the performance of the repertory with which she was principally associated. Two years later she was appointed CBE &#145;for services to British music&#146;. This was one of many awards from countries as varied as Finland, Belgium, and Brazil.<br>
<br>At the beginning of the Second World War Harriet Cohen was on tour in the USA, and she did not return until the summer of 1940. She was untiring in what she felt to be positive artistic diplomacy, though the authorities did not always take her at her own valuation. A major shock came with the blitz when her house was bombed and burnt out, causing the loss of not only her piano but also her music. In the UK she undertook extensive provincial tours, but was no longer well thought of by the BBC music staff. Despite extensive lobbying, a succession of accidents and illnesses frustrated her success when dates were offered. In 1944 Bax bought her the flat in Gloucester Place Mews, Portman Square, London, where she lived until her death.<br>
<br>In 1946 Bax wrote <span class="italic">Morning Song</span>, a short piece for piano and orchestra to mark the twenty-first birthday of Princess Elizabeth in 1947. Cohen recorded it in February 1947, and it was first performed at a Promenade Concert in August and in the princess's presence in October.<br>
<br>In 1946 Bax's wife died, but Harriet learned of this only when the will was published in 1948. She imagined Bax would marry her, but on being pressed, he had to disclose the existence of another mistress, Mary Gleaves, whom he had known since 1926. This was in May 1948, when Bax's music for the film <span class="italic">Oliver Twist</span> was being recorded.<br>
<br>Subsequently Harriet suffered a serious accident and cut her right wrist, which stopped her from playing, an incident later marked in a BBC radio feature. Bax wrote a left-hand concerto (he called it <span class="italic">Concertante</span>) for her, in which she reappeared at Cheltenham in July 1950 and at the Promenade Concerts three weeks later. Her wrist made such a good recovery that in 1954 she was able to broadcast Bax's <span class="italic">Winter Legends</span> and also championed Peter Racine Fricker's piano concerto, op. 19, which was written for her. She gave the first performance in March 1954.<br>
<br>Harriet Cohen formally retired in 1960 and thereafter devoted her time to the Harriet Cohen international awards, which she had started in the early 1950s. She wrote her autobiography, <span class="italic">A Bundle of Time</span>, though it was unpublished at her unexpected death in the University College Hospital, London, from pneumonia on 13 November 1967.<br>
