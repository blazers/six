<span class="headword">Dunn,  James Churchill</span>  (1871&#150;1955), <span class="occ">medical doctor and army officer</span>, was born at Churchill, near Auckland, New Zealand, on 24 February 1871, the only known child of Richard Dunn (1839&#150;1871), from a family of coal-masters in Rutherglen, Lanarkshire, and his young Irish wife. Within three or four months of Dunn's birth, his parents were killed in a conflict between settlers and Maoris, Te Kooti's War (1868&#150;72), but he survived and was discovered by a neighbouring sheep farmer. Sent back to Scotland, Dunn was brought up by two spinster aunts: he later wrote, &#145;what I am is largely (how largely?) the finished whole of &#147;Aunt&#148;&#146;  (Simpson, introduction, xxii). He was educated at Hamilton Academy, Glasgow Academy, and Clifton Bank School, St Andrews. In 1888 he began medical studies at Edinburgh University and, after further study in 1892 at Leipzig and Vienna, in 1893 was awarded MB, CM. He was a research assistant Glasgow, and in 1897 gained an Edinburgh MD. He moved to London and worked in several hospitals, including as a house physician and later as a resident medical officer at the St Pancras and Northern Dispensary, Euston Road.<br>
<br>During &#145;Black Week&#146;, December 1899, Dunn was among the many middle-class men who volunteered for the Second South African War. He enlisted as a trooper in a Montgomeryshire yeomanry company of the imperial yeomanry. He served for over a year and was awarded the DCM for bravery. He later served for a few months at the end of the war as a civil surgeon with the army in South Africa. By 1903 he had returned to London and was a physician in the Lying-In Hospital, Lambeth. In 1908 he was awarded a Cambridge University diploma in public health. In 1913 he was in practice at 29 George Street, Portman Square, London.<br>
<br>Following the outbreak of war in August 1914 Dunn, then aged forty-three, again volunteered. In January 1915 he was commissioned temporary lieutenant in the RAMC, and in July was posted to the 19th field ambulance (not a vehicle but a mobile medical unit) in the 19th brigade in France. The brigade was with the 27th division from May 1915, the 2nd division from August 1915, and the 33rd division from November 1915. Also in the brigade was the 2nd battalion, Royal Welch Fusiliers (RWF), to which in November 1915 Dunn was appointed regimental medical officer. He continued as such, promoted to temporary captain, enduring depression and influenza, until temporarily invalided by gas in May 1918, his only wounding during the war: an officer saw &#145;pitiful rows of gas-blinded men lying in the shade &hellip; and Dr. Dunn, with tinted glasses and a parasol, striving to convince himself that it was nothing and would soon pass!&#146;  (Dudley Ward, 467). In June 1918 he requested a transfer as he disliked working with the new acting commanding officer. He served less happily in a service battalion of the East Yorkshire regiment in the 31st division until the end of the war.<br>
<br>The Royal Welch Fusiliers was an old and distinguished regiment with twenty-nine battle honours, and idiosyncrasies including the goat, the &#145;flash&#146; (black ribbons at the back of the collar), and the spelling Welch. Ostensibly Welsh, the regiment before the war recruited largely from Birmingham and was nicknamed the &#145;Birmingham Fusiliers&#146;, but during the war the Welsh intake increased. Although very aware he was an &#145;attached&#146; officer, Dunn became devoted to the regiment and especially its 2nd battalion. His contemporaries there included Siegfried Sassoon, Robert Graves, and Frank Richards (later author of <span class="italic">Old Soldiers Never Die</span>), who all praised him in their memoirs.<br>
<br>Described as &#145;hard-bitten&#146;, reserved, reticent, difficult to know, and averse to publicity, Dunn was a brave and active medical officer, often in the front trenches and always present during raids, bombardments, and attacks. He went out with the orderlies and stretcher-bearers, tending the wounded under fire. During his thirty months with 2nd RWF he was mentioned in dispatches in 1916 and 1917, and awarded the MC and clasp and the DSO. The citations were for outstanding bravery in tending the wounded under fire. The DSO, cynically known as &#145;Dukes' Sons Only&#146; from its award to aristocratic staff officers, was well deserved by Dunn in 1917. His citation stated that he &#145;set a magnificent example to all of courage and devotion to duty under continuous heavy fire&#146;  (Creagh and Humphris, pt 2, 84), and Graves wrote that Dunn &#145;earned his D.S.O. many times over&#146;  (Graves, 173). Though officially non-combatant, in an emergency he took temporary command and fired a machine gun. Respected by all ranks, he was influential within the battalion. Sassoon described him &#145;sauntering up the trench with the detached demeanour of a gentle botanist&#146;  (Sassoon, 168) and Richards wrote that he was &#145;the bravest and coolest man under fire I ever saw in France&#146;  (Richards, 154).<br>
<br>After the war Dunn returned to civilian practice, living in Glasgow with his aunts; for the rest of his life his address was 62 Sardinia Terrace, Cecil Street, Hillhead, Glasgow. He described himself as &#145;a solitary by nature&#146;  (Simpson, introduction, xxii) and never married. He was a member of the Glasgow pensions appeal tribunal on claims for war disability. In 1922 he was one of fifty-nine witnesses&#151;officers, doctors, neurologists and psychologists&#151;who gave evidence to the War Office committee of inquiry into &#145;shell-shock&#146;, initiated and chaired by Lord Southborough. &#145;Shell-shock&#146;, a term both invented and officially rejected in the First World War, was a contentious and emotive issue. Dunn, well aware of &#145;&#147;wind-up&#148; cases&#146; and malingerers, showed ambivalence towards war neuroses, and emphasized the importance of training, discipline, the death penalty, and morale. He also claimed of Sassoon's 1917 protest that &#145;he said in public at home what &#147;everyone&#148; in the infantry said in France&#146; (quoted in Simpson, &#145;Dr James Dunn and shell-shock&#146;, 512).<br>
<br>First World War commemoration took many forms, including unit histories. In 1925 a regimental committee started preparing a history of the RWF in the war. Dunn wrote to former members and gathered material on the 2nd battalion. He advocated the acquisition of recollections from all ranks, to show &#145;ordinary trench life&#146;. He wanted to ensure his battalion's record was not overshadowed by that of the 1st battalion. He compiled a 70,000-word manuscript and sent it to the regimental history editor. Although it incorporated material he had written, Dunn was bitterly disappointed by the regimental history, published in 1928, which he believed inaccurate and omitting the best contributions. Urged by Sassoon and Edmund Blunden, and wanting to correct what he considered the distortions of Graves's <span class="italic">Goodbye to All That</span> (1929) and other &#145;catchpenny&#146; publications on the war, Dunn decided to publish his manuscript. After rejection by several publishers, in 1938 his <span class="italic">The War the Infantry Knew</span> was published by P. S. King, a small London firm, in an edition of only 500 copies.<br>
<br>Dunn did not name himself as author: the title-page stated the book was &#145;edited and partly written by one of their Medical Officers&#146;. The book was based on Dunn's diaries and letters, regimental records, and contributions from sixty-three veterans, mostly RWF officers, but also other ranks. They included Sassoon and Richards, but not Graves, whose offered material Dunn declined. The book was a chronicle of the 2nd battalion from July 1914 to June 1919, including not only combat and suffering, but also other aspects of wartime experience (though not venereal disease). It expressed Dunn's views: favouring the old regular army and critical of Territorials and New Army troops, and also of generals and their staffs. It was favourably reviewed and became considered a classic, though scarce because of its limited print run. An invalid in his later years, he died in Glasgow on 30 March 1955, and was cremated. He had apparently destroyed his diaries and letters. The &#145;elusive&#146; Dunn was researched by Keith Simpson, who initiated the republication in 1987 of <span class="italic">The War the Infantry Knew</span>. It remains an outstanding record of the western front.<br>
