<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Slack,  John</span>  (<em>c.</em>1721&#150;1768), <span class="occ">pugilist</span>, was born in Norfolk of unknown parents. His trade was that of a butcher and he probably served the usual apprenticeship under one John Browne at Norwich, where he first came to prize-fighting prominence, forging a formidable provincial reputation there.<br>
<br>Prior to the pinnacle of his boxing career, his unexpected win over the seemingly invincible John Broughton, Slack was advertised in journals of the day as meeting such first-rate fistic exponents as George Taylor, Thomas Smallwood, James Field, Benjamin Boswell, and John James. It appears he made his London d&eacute;but when he defeated James on 12 October 1743 at the Great Booth, Tottenham Court. Slack at this stage claimed to be unbeaten  (<span class="italic">Daily Advertiser</span>, 12 and 14 Oct 1743). Shortly afterwards he again overcame James but was twice vanquished by Smallwood; in line with the general trend of the era, he certainly fought several of his opponents on more than one occasion. However, it was Taylor the Barber, then considered second only to Broughton, who proved to be Slack's most difficult adversary. On 4 November 1747, at Broughton's Amphitheatre, Oxford Road, Taylor survived a burst blood vessel before recording a thirty-six minute victory and on the 16th of the following month he won again at the same venue, this time in thirty-two minutes. Any lost reputation, though, was completely redeemed by Slack in his confrontation with Field the Sailor on 9 February 1749. The battle lasted about ninety-two minutes and was the &#145;severest and longest ever seen upon the Stage&#146;  (<span class="italic">London Evening-Post</span>, 9&#150;11 Feb 1749). Before again losing to Taylor, in a desperately hard encounter on 31 January 1750, Slack had also beaten Boswell and the massive Thomas Hawksley (Hawksly). It is clear, therefore, that he was far more experienced and highly regarded prior to meeting Broughton than has been generally accepted.<br>
<br>The Broughton match occurred on 11 April 1750  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 1st ser., 20, 1750, 184). It developed after both claimed to have been physically abused by the other, the previous month, at the election at Brentford of a knight of the shire for the county of Middlesex. Broughton, fighting at his amphitheatre, was the early favourite but Slack surprisingly gained a victory in just over fourteen minutes by temporarily blinding his antagonist. It was thought at the time that as a result of his success Slack became richer by at least &pound;600. Historians since the nineteenth century have credited him with championship (of England) status between this success and his defeat ten years afterwards by William Stevens (Stephens) the Nailer, but there is no evidence of this in contemporary journals. Moreover, in February of the year following the Broughton contest Slack suffered yet another loss at the hands of George Taylor. On that occasion a leg injury sustained in the last fall forced a dominant Slack to concede after approximately sixteen minutes  (<span class="italic">Read's Weekly Journal</span>, 9 Feb 1751). Although he easily subdued George Lea (Lee) on 10 February 1752, he had great difficulty beating the cricketer Thomas Faulkner (Falkner) some three months later and, on 15 November of that year, sustained a further defeat when bested by Elias Goddard.<br>
<br>Apart from the Broughton conquest, Slack's other most notable performance was probably against the remarkably strong Pettit on 29 July 1754 at Harlston, Norfolk. Despite throwing Slack off the stage three times, Pettit became so cowed by his indomitable opponent that he walked away after twenty-five minutes, leaving Slack to be awarded the victory the next morning. Also fought out of London were Slack's triumphs over John and Cornelius Harris on 6 February and 6 March 1755 respectively. Both took place in Bristol; the former lasted about six minutes  (<span class="italic">Felix Farley's Bristol Journal</span>, 25 Jan &#150; 8 Feb 1755) and the latter upwards of twenty  (<span class="italic">Felix Farley's Bristol Journal</span>, 1&#150;8 March 1755). Slack's last win appears to have been over one Morton (Moreton) before his final contest in which he lost to Stevens in less than four minutes on 2 June 1760 at the Tennis Court, James Street, Haymarket, London  (<span class="italic">Public Advertiser</span>, 3 June 1760).<br>
<br>Slack was a powerfully built man, standing about 5 ft 8&frac12; in. tall and weighing, in his prime, somewhere between 13 and 14 stone. His physique and fistic attributes were ideally suited to the prevailing style of fighting of the period. He possessed considerable strength and, despite lacking science, when resolved on victory his courage and determination made him a redoubtable adversary. He so abhorred &#145;shifting&#146; that it is said he &#145;optionally received a knock-down blow sooner than relinquish his original situation&#146;  (Fewtrell, 52). Although later generations of bareknuckle pugilists generally scorned its use, Slack was noted for his success with the &#145;chopper&#146;, a back-handed blow to the face.<br>
<br>It is probable that the John Slack, butcher, sworn in as a freeman of the city of Norwich (1744) and the butcher John Slack who later became a burgess of the city of Bristol (1759) were both the celebrated prize-fighter. At some time between these dates he certainly plied his trade in London, first at Chandos Street, Covent Garden, and then at the now defunct Brooks Market, Holborn. He died at Bristol on 17 July 1768  (<span class="italic">Felix Farley's Bristol Journal</span>, 23 July 1768).<br>
<br>Slack was the grandfather of the renowned Belcher brothers, James (1781&#150;1811) and Thomas (1783&#150;1854), the former a champion of England and the latter one of the most scientific boxers of his day.<br>
