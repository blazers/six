<span class="headword">Bacon <span class="st"> [Bacun]</span>,  John</span>  (<em>c.</em>1250&#150;<em>c.</em>1323), <span class="occ">justice</span>, was probably born in north-east Suffolk, near Great Yarmouth. He began his career as a junior clerk of the Westminster bench, <i>c</i>.1273. By 1280 he had entered the service of the more senior royal clerk, John Berewyk, and during the following decade assisted him in his duties both as keeper of writs and rolls on the southern eyre circuit and as treasurer to Queen Eleanor. In 1292, two years after the queen's death, Bacon was himself appointed keeper of writs and rolls of the common bench, with responsibility for the compilation of one of the court's subsidiary plea rolls, and for the interim custody of all original and judicial writs returned into the court, all final concords levied there, and all deeds produced in court whose authenticity was challenged. Contemporary law reports also show him playing a role in the adjudication of litigation. He was accused of serious official wrongdoing at the Lent parliament of 1305, but the two accusations against him were later withdrawn and he retained his post until 1313, when he was appointed one of the justices of the common bench. Bacon does not appear in any of the cases reported in the year-books during his period of office as a justice (1313&#150;20). This is probably because the reporters recorded only cases heard in one of the two divisions of the court and he was sitting in the other division, dealing with more routine procedural matters. John Bacon probably died not long after his last known judicial appointment in October 1323.<br>
<br>John had at least four brothers. Adam, who was also a clerk, was in the service of John Salmon, bishop of Norwich, between 1309 and 1315 and was pardoned in 1318 for past adherence to the earl of Lancaster. Edmund, a knight, was in the king's service in Gascony from 1293 to 1297 and in Scotland in 1298 and 1303. He was constable of Wallingford during the first half of the reign of Edward II, and in the service of the king's half-brother Edmund of Kent from 1320. He was in Gascony again from 1324 and was captured near Bordeaux on his return from an embassy to Aragon in 1325. In 1330 he was a king's knight. A third brother, Henry, was also a knight; and a fourth, Robert, was a clerk. The Thomas Bacun who became a serjeant of the common bench in 1311, was a justice of the king's bench from 1332 to 1335, and died in 1336, was probably also a relative, possibly a brother.<br>
<br>John Bacon's earliest traceable property holdings were at Gorleston and Reston in north-east Suffolk, some held jointly with his mother, Sabina. He acquired further properties in the same area and had permission in 1293 to divert a highway to extend his house at Reston. By 1301 his mother had given him her holding at Ludham in south-east Norfolk, and he subsequently acquired other holdings in a number of neighbouring villages. He also made a series of property acquisitions at Widford and Mountnessing and surrounding villages in Essex, and at Ewelme in Oxfordshire. A clerk in major orders, John Bacon held a number of ecclesiastical livings, including those of Reston and Ewelme, and is known to have travelled to Rome on unspecified private business in 1306.<br>
