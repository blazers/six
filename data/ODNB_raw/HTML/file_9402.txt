<span class="headword">Fielding, Sir  John</span>  (1721&#150;1780), <span class="occ">magistrate</span>, was born on 16 September 1721, probably in Blenheim Street, St James's, London, the third of the six children of General Edmund Fielding (1680&#150;1741), an army officer, and his second wife, Anne Blanchfield (<i>d</i>. 1727), who may have owned a London eating-house and was the widow of an Italian called Rapha. Fielding was half-brother to the novelists <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9400/', "Henry Fielding (1707&#150;1754)")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9405/', "Sarah Fielding (1710&#150;1768)")</script>, children of Edmund's first marriage. He enjoyed a close relationship with Henry, and after the latter's death edited <span class="italic">Journal of a Voyage to Lisbon</span> (1755), administered his estate, and supported his widow and children. He also gave financial support to Sarah, although they quarrelled when Fielding gave information to Henry's biographer, Arthur Murphy, which, she thought, cast him in a bad light.<br>
<br>Nothing is known of Fielding's education and little of his life before 1749, although he may have served in the navy. He had poor eyesight and was blinded in 1740 by what he called &#145;an accident&#146;  (J. Fielding, <span class="italic">The Universal Mentor</span>, 1768, iii), but which was, in fact, negligent treatment by James Wilkie, a surgeon, against whom damages of &pound;500 were awarded in 1741. Fielding married Elizabeth Whittingham (<i>d</i>. 1774) of Lichfield, the niece of the Revd Dr Whittingham, on 21 November 1751 at Duke Street Chapel, Westminster. They had no children, but his wife's niece, Mary Ann Whittingham (<i>c</i>.1745&#150;1820), lived with them; she adopted the name of Fielding and married Henry's son Allen. After his wife died, Fielding married Mary Sedgley (<i>d</i>. 1794), the daughter of a Mr Sedgley of Brompton, on 6 August 1774 at Kensington parish church; they had no children.<br>
<br>In February 1750, along with Henry Fielding and others, Fielding opened the Universal Register Office opposite Cecil Street in the Strand, London. The business, which was probably Henry's idea, aimed &#145;to bring the World &hellip; together into one Place&#146; by acting as an intermediary in various business transactions, although it became mainly an employment exchange and a retailer of &#145;Glastonbury water&#146;, a famous restorative  (J. Fielding, <span class="italic">A Plan of the Universal Register-Office</span>, 1752, 9). The office moved along the Strand to the corner of Castle Court in the early 1750s. Fielding lived at both of these locations and under his management the business prospered. Following in Henry's footsteps, he became a justice of the peace for Westminster on 29 August 1751 and for Middlesex on 14 January 1754. In January 1754 he succeeded Henry as court justice, an adviser to government on law and order, and by June 1754 he had moved into the house and office at Bow Street vacated by Henry. He lived there for most of the rest of his life, although in 1768 he bought Brompton Place, at the junction of Cromwell Lane and Brompton Park Lane.<br>
<br>Fielding was criticized by a committee of the House of Lords for a lack of vigour in quelling riots by silk weavers and by supporters of John Wilkes in the 1760s. His major achievement lay in the general preventative plan of 1772 which aimed to deter potential offenders by &#145;the Certainty of speedy Detection&#146; through &#145;the drawing of all Informations of Fraud and Felony into one point [Bow Street], registering Offenders of all Kinds, quick Notice and sudden Pursuit, and keeping up a Correspondence with all the active Magistrates in England&#146;  (J. Fielding, <span class="italic">Extracts from such of the Penal Laws</span>, 1768, v&#150;vi). With government finance, Henry had initiated such a plan in London in 1753, but Fielding extended it to collate information, initially, from the area around London and, then, in 1772, from the whole country. He advertised crimes and suspects in newspapers which were distributed to magistrates, gaolers, and other officials, and kept records at Bow Street of the information gathered. The plan attracted widespread support because of fears about crime prompted by demobilization following the peace treaty in 1763, and because of general recognition that co-operation was essential to deal with those professional criminals who moved about the country. Fielding also believed magistrates needed to be active in solving cases through lengthy interviews of suspects and witnesses. He continued Henry's practice of using a small group of thief-takers to pursue serious offenders in London and beyond, and he defended them against allegations of corruption. The government funded a horse patrol in London on his advice during the crime panic of 1763&#150;4.<br>
<br>Fielding's involvement in charities was informed by his belief that vice was the root of crime. Concerned at the number of &#145;distressed friendless boys&#146; driven by circumstance into petty crime, and believing them to be the &#145;black fountain&#146; from which robbers came  (J. Fielding, <span class="italic">An Account of the Receipts and Disbursements Relating to Sir John Fielding's Plan</span>, 1769, v), he arranged for thirty boys to enter naval service in 1756. This blossomed into the Marine Society (established 1756), of which Fielding was a committee member. In 1769 he formed the modestly titled Fielding's Seminary for Sailors to equip boys for the merchant navy. Such initiatives were well received by parish officials, who were able to divest themselves of their responsibility for pauper boys. Fielding was a governor of the Magdalen Hospital (founded 1758), which sought to reform prostitutes, and a life governor of the Female Orphans Asylum (1758; later the Royal Female Orphanage), which, initially, aimed to divert orphans from prostitution, and of the British Lying-In Hospital (1749). He was a member of the Society for the Encouragement of Arts, Manufactures, and Commerce.<br>
<br>While not an original thinker, Fielding was an able and determined administrator who built the reputation of Bow Street. Its example was followed in establishing other police offices under the <span class="roman">Middlesex Justices Act</span> of 1792, and, although Robert Peel did not adopt this model for the Metropolitan Police in 1829, Fielding's view that crime could be prevented by an efficient detective system became a guiding principle of modern police work. He boasted of his achievements in print and before two parliamentary committees, in 1768 and 1770. Good publicity was, of course, crucial to his plans and to continued government support, but he tended towards pomposity and self-aggrandizement. Jealous of his status, he was quick to take and give offence. His single-minded and sometimes rather unimaginative pursuit of his objectives led him to persuade David Garrick and George Colman not to produce John Gay's <span class="italic">The Beggar's Opera</span> on the ground that it induced young men to imitate Macheath. This was not an uncommon view at the time, but his attitude angered Garrick, and prompted an attack by W. A. Miles in <span class="italic">A Letter to Sir John Fielding</span> (1773). Contemporaries questioned his integrity, claiming he was paid by newspaper proprietors and, according to William Hickey, by the brothel keepers who flourished in the area around Bow Street. Yet, in an age of widespread corruption among public officials, he does not appear to have acquired great wealth from his work.<br>
<br>In 1757 Fielding canvassed the government for a knighthood, which was conferred on 1 October 1761. He became ill, probably in early 1780, and died at Brompton Place on 4 September 1780, a few months after the Gordon rioters had destroyed the records he had gathered at Bow Street. He was buried on 13 September at All Saints' Church, Chelsea.<br>
