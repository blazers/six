<span class="headword">Bird,  John</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1558), <span class="occ">bishop of Chester</span>, is said by John Bale to have come from an old Chester family, and to have been born in Coventry, where he joined the Carmelite friars. He incepted as doctor of theology at Oxford on 20 February 1514 and preached the university sermon on the feast of the Ascension following. In August 1516 he was elected provincial at the Carmelite chapter held in Bishop's Lynn. Afterwards, as vicar-general, he made a visitation of the province; letters of confraternity that he issued survive (Bodl. Oxf., MS Rawl. D.366). In May 1517 he attended the order's general chapter in Siena. He left office in 1519 owing to a new statute limiting provincials to a three-year term, but was re-elected in 1522 and held office until the dissolution. In 1531 he attended the trial for heresy of Thomas Bilney in Norwich. A supporter of Henry VIII's divorce, he wrote a treatise in its favour which survives. In 1535 he accompanied Bishop Edward Fox and Thomas Bedyll on their mission to Katherine of Aragon to persuade her to relinquish the title of queen. At Easter 1537 he preached before the king.<br>
<br>On 11 June 1537 Bird was named as suffragan to the bishop of Llandaff, with the new title of bishop of &#145;Penreth&#146; (not Penrith in Cumberland but more likely Pen-tyrch near Llandaff), and was consecrated at Lambeth Palace on 24 June. He was translated to the diocese of Bangor on 24 July 1539. Bird was involved in the negotiations for Henry VIII's marriage to Anne of Cleves, and in 1539 he accompanied Nicholas Wotton to Germany, with instructions from Thomas Cromwell to obtain her picture for the king. The following year, on 9 July 1540, he was a member of the royal commission which met in the chapter house in Westminster and declared the marriage between the king and Anne null and void.<br>
<br>On 4 August 1541 Bird was translated to the newly formed diocese of Chester. In addition to facing the problem of creating a new diocesan administration, he received less from his see than any other English bishop except that of Rochester. To save money, he appointed no archdeacon but devolved some of his authority to the rural deans. He appointed a chancellor to reside at Chester and a commissary for Richmond; the men he chose had local connections, which may have helped make the new episcopal administration more acceptable to the gentry of the diocese, but they were also apt to be inefficient and unreliable. To augment his income Bird negotiated an exchange of property with the crown, but the scheme misfired, and the diocese lost the valuable Derbyshire manor of Weston while receiving in return five rectories and eight advowsons whose real value was considerably less than their nominal one. Unwisely he granted annuities to influential local people and favoured others with generous long leases of episcopal property, thereby worsening his financial position. In 1552 he was admitted to Wistaston church, Chester, doubtless to augment his income, but in the following year he still owed the crown nearly &pound;1100 for tenths and subsidies.<br>
<br>Bird had married while a bishop and so, following the accession of Mary, he was deprived of his see on 16 March 1554. He put aside his wife, and on 6 November 1554 was collated as vicar of Great Dunmow, Essex. Burnet describes an occasion in July 1555 when:<blockquote>Bird, that had been bishop of Chester, and was deprived for his marriage, did now think fit to repent, and engaged so far that Bonner made him his suffragan. He was blind of an eye; and being appointed to preach before the bishop, he chose those words for his text, &#145;Thou art Peter&#146;; but whether his conscience smote him, or his memory failed, he could go no further. So, instead of matter of triumph upon the apostacy of such a man, the shame of such a dumb action turned the triumph to the other side. (Burnet, 2.789)</blockquote>Bird's partial blindness seems to have been an affliction acquired in old age. In the autumn of 1555 he visited Bishop Bonner in Fulham bearing some apples and a bottle of wine as gifts. Thomas Haukes, imprisoned for refusing to have his child baptized, remembered being called into the orchard to face the two bishops, where Bird exhorted him: &#145;Alas, good young man! you must be taught by the church, and by your ancients; and do as your forefathers have done before you&#146;  (Foxe, 7.104). Bird died at Great Dunmow on 25 October 1558 and was buried in his parish church.<br>
<br>Apart from his treatise in favour of the king's divorce, Bird's other compositions are lost: they included a homily preached at the funeral of Edmund Bury, prior of Calais, in 1523, a collection of sermons, lectures on St Paul, and a tract on justification by faith. Bale, who knew him well, commented that Bird was: &#145;a man of modest abilities, with a honeyed tongue, a keen disputant and not ineffective preacher&#146; and &#145;a particularly handsome man, &hellip; but (to be deplored in such a man) he was rather remiss in correcting the faults of others, being swayed by his own good nature&#146;  (BL, Harley MS 3838, fols. 110<i>v</i>, 41). Bird's ability to charm served him well and he was willing to adapt his views to suit successive regimes before apparently returning to Catholic belief on the accession of Mary.<br>
