<span class="headword">Kerans,  John Simon</span>  (1915&#150;1985), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, was born on 30 June 1915 at Birr, King's county, Ireland, the son of Major Edward Thomas John Kerans DSO, of the Royal Tank Corps and his wife, Eva Wills Hale.<h2>
<a name="Educationandearlycareer"></a>Education and early career</h2>Kerans began his formal education in a preparatory school in Gloucester and went on from there to the Royal Naval College at Dartmouth, where he excelled in individual sports, winning caps for both fencing and sprinting and being notable for his exploits at the shooting range, in the swimming pool, and on both the squash and tennis courts. At 5 feet 11 inches in height, fit and blessed with explosive speed, Kerans was an ideal rugby wing three-quarter and represented his college in that position in its competitive fixtures. A lover of classical music and country pursuits, he was a maverick who possessed a strong streak of independence and self-assurance that led him, on occasion, to go to excess socially and bring him almost inevitably into collision with authority. His periodic brushes with the conservative establishment of the Royal Navy hindered his career. There was some consternation in Admiralty circles about how best to exploit his undoubted talents within the service.<br>
<br>After passing out of Dartmouth, Kerans served as both cadet and midshipman on board the battleship HMS <i>Rodney</i> in the Home Fleet (1932&#150;3). His next post was as midshipman on the Kent class cruiser HMS <i>Cornwall</i> (1933&#150;5), on which he was promoted sub-lieutenant. This led to his spending the next two years at the Royal Naval College, Greenwich, where he did not cover himself with glory in the classroom. Denied promotion and a seagoing appointment, he was sent to serve on the intelligence staff of the China station in Hong Kong and Singapore at a time of increasing Japanese belligerence in the Far East (1937&#150;9). Once the Second World War had begun, however, he was sent as sub-lieutenant to the cruiser HMS <i>Naiad</i>, which was being used in the Home Fleet for trade protection duties. In May 1941 <i>Naiad</i> was deployed to join force H and become the flagship of 15th cruiser squadron on Malta convoy operations. On 11 March 1942, on return passage to Alexandria from an abortive attempt to intercept a supposedly damaged Italian cruiser in the eastern Mediterranean, <i>Naiad</i> was torpedoed and sunk off Mersa Matruh by <i>U-565</i>. Kerans was rescued and was rewarded with a shore appointment as staff officer (intelligence) on the staff of the tough, authoritative commander-in-chief Mediterranean and Levant, Admiral Sir John Henry Dacres Cunningham. After being belatedly promoted Kerans was sent to the destroyer minelayer HMS <i>Icarus</i> to act as its first lieutenant while it served on the Atlantic convoy route (1943&#150;4).<br>
<br>Brought ashore before operation Overlord to serve on the staff of the commander-in-chief, Portsmouth, Kerans chanced to meet Stephanie Campbell Shires (<i>b</i>. 1917/18), at that time a member of the WRNS serving on the staff of combined operations headquarters and someone who helped to plot the D-day invasion. They met once again in Ceylon in 1945 while both were still in the service and decided to get married shortly afterwards, which they did in the parish of Charles, Plymouth, on 7 January 1946. They were married for thirty-nine years and had two daughters.<h2>
<a name="TransfertoNanking"></a>Transfer to Nanking</h2>Making up for lost time Kerans was promoted lieutenant-commander in 1944 and placed in charge of the Hunt type 2 class destroyer HMS <i>Blackmore</i>. Remaining with this ship until 1947, he was then transferred by the Admiralty to Hong Kong to serve on the staff of security intelligence. Once the drama of the Malayan emergency began to unfold in the following year, Kerans embarked on a three-month attachment to the Selangor police in Kuala Lumpur. At this point his naval career appeared to be going nowhere and Sir Patrick Brind, the commander-in-chief of the Far East station in Singapore, was evidently almost at a loss to know what to do with him. None the less, just when it appeared that the Royal Navy was giving up on Kerans, an unlikely opportunity presented itself for the mercurial lieutenant-commander to redeem himself. It came in the shape of an appeal for a competent assistant requested by Captain Vernon Donaldson, the naval attach&eacute; at the British embassy in China; he needed help in dealing with the extra workload generated after the British had stationed a warship on the Yangtze (Yangzi) River at Nanking (Nanjing) in November 1948. Brind indicated that Kerans was almost immediately available but that he would be &#145;under report&#146; status for an indefinite period. Donaldson&#151;a sound, hard-working individual from the Scottish borders&#151;decided to risk having the occasionally disruptive Kerans on his staff. On 3 February 1949 the newly appointed assistant naval attach&eacute; arrived in the Chinese nationalist capital to take up his duties just as the government was preparing to withdraw further south to Canton (Guangzhou) in Kwangtung (Guangdong) province. In these tense and fluid circumstances, when a studied calmness was at a premium and much work remained to be done, Kerans's rather brash personality and undisciplined work methods grated on Donaldson's nerves and made him inclined to regret giving his assistant a last chance to save his naval career.<br>
<br>If the Admiralty's policy was to keep Kerans out of harm's way while it decided what to do with him, transferring him from Malaya to China singularly failed to serve this purpose. Instead he was pitched into an extraordinarily controversial situation. Churchill's wartime coalition government had already signed a treaty with the Chinese government of Chiang Kai-shek on 11 January 1943 renouncing all British extraterritorial rights in the country, and Attlee's Labour administration had consolidated this policy by joining with the other major world powers gathered in Moscow in December 1945 in adopting a policy of non-intervention in the civil war that had broken out in China between forces of the nationalist Kuomintang (KMT) and the communist People's Liberation Army (PLA). Yet, contrary to both the spirit and the letter of these two crucial diplomatic accords, the British business community in China and a few leading members of the Commonwealth diplomatic corps in Nanking sought to preserve their economic interests in the country by reviving a British naval presence on the Yangtze. It was a shallow and absurd decision that managed to alienate both communists and nationalists alike and suggests that the British had scant regard for either the tenets of international law or Chinese sovereignty and independence. By February 1949 the Yangtze had become a no man's land between the front lines of the ebullient PLA troops drawn up on the northern bank of the river and the battered KMT forces whose grip on the territory south of the river looked anything but secure. A temporary ceasefire was in place but few expected it to last indefinitely. In the circumstances, therefore, one might have hoped for a suspension of the British guardship scheme until the highly charged political and military situation had settled down. No such enlightened decision was reached in Whitehall and British warships continued to make their scheduled journeys up and down the 200-mile stretch of the lower Yangtze from Shanghai to Nanking as the two armed factions in the Chinese civil war looked on from opposite sides of the river. By mid-April the PLA high command, frustrated by the inconclusive peace negotiations with the KMT, dramatically gave the nationalists a four-day deadline to accept its extremely harsh ultimatum or face the consequences of a resumption of the war.<h2>
<a name="Amethystunderfire"></a>Amethyst under fire</h2>Three days later on 19 April 1949 the frigate HMS <i>Amethyst</i> began her latest journey upriver from Shanghai. She was planned to arrive in Nanking to relieve the destroyer HMS <i>Consort</i> nine hours before the expiry of the PLA ultimatum at midnight on 20 April. She did not make it. At 9.30 a.m. on 20 April, at a point in the river some 60 miles north-east of Nanking, <i>Amethyst</i> came under accurate and withering fire from a communist battery situated at the mouth of the tributary leading to the Kao-yu lakes at San-chiang-ying (Sanjiangying). Within five minutes the frigate had sustained a number of grievous hits that wrecked her bridge, wheelhouse, and low power room, rendered her gyrocompass useless, damaged her electrical, gunnery, lighting, and navigational circuits, and jammed her steering hard to port so that she had driven herself up onto a mudbank just off the western shore of Rose Island. She was stuck, unable to extricate herself and virtually defenceless against the persistent shelling and small arms fire that rained down on her for roughly 90 minutes. Apart from her captain, Lieutenant-Commander B. M. Skinner, who was mortally wounded, the <i>Amethyst</i> suffered twenty-two other losses and had thirty-one of its crew wounded in the attack and its immediate aftermath.<br>
<br>When the news of the <i>Amethyst</i>'s plight reached the British naval authorities on the Far East station, arrangements were swiftly made for HMS <i>Consort</i> to leave Nanking and come to the frigate's assistance. Unfortunately, the British destroyer's arrival on the scene in the early afternoon and her willingness to bombard the shoreline did not overawe the PLA battery crews operating from well-hidden nests of guns along the northern bank of the river. <i>Consort</i> was engaged and struck by a number of shells&#151;killing ten of her company and wounding twenty-three others&#151;as she steamed past the forlorn and trapped figure of the <i>Amethyst</i>. Later that evening, after a series of running repairs to her engines and steering equipment, the <i>Amethyst</i> managed to extricate herself from the mudbank and move to a more sheltered location a short distance upstream of Rose Island. Another abortive attempt to rescue her was mounted on the following day when the 10,000 ton cruiser HMS <i>London</i> and the frigate HMS <i>Black Swan</i> tried to go to her assistance. Further mayhem resulted with thirteen killed and thirty-two wounded on board the leading ship <i>London</i> and seven wounded on her supporting vessel <i>Black Swan</i>. In the light of these further incidents no other rescue bids were made or planned by the British naval authorities. As direct action was now ruled out, a resolution of the <i>Amethyst</i> crisis would have to be through some form of negotiation with the PLA, but even this possibility was fraught with serious problems since the British government did not have any contact&#151;official or otherwise&#151;with the communist hierarchy and the <i>Amethyst</i> had lost her captain and two of her senior officers were known to be seriously wounded and in urgent need of hospitalization.<br>
<br>In these unfavourable circumstances, Donaldson sent Kerans off to try and establish personal contact with the stricken frigate and her crew. This was easier said than done but eventually, after a number of mishaps, he was able to get on board the <i>Amethyst</i> in the mid-afternoon of 22 April. Once he did so he received a call from Vice-Admiral Sir Alexander Madden, the flag officer and second in charge of the Far East station, ordering him to assume acting command of the ship. From then onwards over the next ninety-nine days Kerans became, <i>de facto</i>, the Royal Navy's leading figure on the Yangtze and therefore, by extension, the one official seen by the PLA as representing the British government in this crisis. Within a day the communists had crossed the river in force and had established themselves on both banks of the Yangtze. Kerans and the <i>Amethyst</i> were trapped. They had become hostages to fortune.<br>
<br>While a political inquest into the background of this crisis opened in the United Kingdom and the British press devoted many column inches to the initial attack on the <i>Amethyst</i> and the subsequent rescue attempts, those on board the frigate at the centre of the controversy could only wait with growing impatience upon future developments. Well aware that it might take some time to arrange the release of the <i>Amethyst</i> and her crew, Kerans knew that time was not on his side. Every day spent in the fetid heat and humidity of the Yangtze used up precious fuel in the <i>Amethyst</i>'s tanks. While shutting down the generators for lengthy periods of the day certainly saved some fuel, it made the business of living on board the frigate more uncomfortable by the hour. In an effort to combat lethargy and restlessness he ensured that everyone on board had a set routine of daily duties to conduct.<h2>
<a name="Heroicdefiance"></a>Heroic defiance</h2>Whatever his past misdemeanours may have been, Kerans was a most resourceful and dashing figure and one who brought an air of self-confidence and individual flair to these proceedings. In fact, the old adage&#151;&#145;cometh the hour, cometh the man&#146;&#151;definitely applies in this instance. Kerans was to perform quite superbly in his new role of acting captain: working closely with the remaining officers and specialists on board and becoming well liked and trusted by the crew who much appreciated both his charismatic personality and his common touch.<br>
<br>Once the PLA had eventually established contact with the <i>Amethyst</i> it became obvious that negotiations between the two sides were going to be long and arduous. Clearly, the PLA's case was based on the fact that the British frigate had flagrantly violated Chinese sovereignty by entering the Yangtze in the first place and that it had compounded this grave error by opening fire on the communist battery positions drawn up on the northern bank of the river in the early morning of 20 April. According to the communists' version of the events, the <i>Amethyst</i> was engaged by the PLA only in self-defence and that further damage to Chinese property and considerable loss of life on shore among the civilian population was caused by the actions of <i>Consort</i>, <i>London</i>, and <i>Black Swan</i> in their unsuccessful attempts to rescue the beleaguered frigate which had created the incident initially. Kerans's defence tactics rested on saying little about the sovereignty issue and vigorously rejecting the charge that the British warship had been responsible for her own demise by opening fire on the Chinese. Instead he counter-accused the PLA of unleashing a completely unprovoked attack on the <i>Amethyst</i>.<br>
<br>Despite the occasional sign of optimism that a breakthrough was imminent, the dreary and contentious negotiations careered on for another three months without resolution. Kerans was instructed by the British government to make some concession on the violation of sovereignty charge, but he had little difficulty in steadfastly refusing to admit any complicity on the question of who fired first on 20 April. Kerans was to demonstrate uncommon tact, patience, and discipline (qualities that he was not especially known for previously) in his role as the Royal Navy's personal intermediary with the PLA in the months to come. His fortitude in adversity and his adroit handling of the often tortuous series of negotiations that ensued could hardly be faulted and were to prove deeply inspirational to the men of the <i>Amethyst</i> as the days of their confinement on the Yangtze grew.<h2>
<a name="Escape"></a>Escape</h2>By 30 July 1949, however, despairing of an early release of his ship and crew and acutely conscious that the <i>Amethyst</i>'s fuel stocks were barely sufficient for her to reach Shanghai under her own steam, Kerans decided to try and escape down the fortified Yangtze at night, without the use of either lights or river pilots, on one of the most difficult stretches of water in the world. After reaching his decision, he informed the officers and crew of the dangers they faced in pursuing this option but the ship's company, cooped up for more than a hundred days in foul conditions, were prepared for anything and enthusiastically supported their captain's bold plan of action. Kerans did not need reminding that if anything went wrong and the <i>Amethyst</i> was further disabled and / or sunk by the PLA defence forces on the passage downriver, the Admiralty in London was hardly likely to view his escape bid in a favourable light. None the less, he had sailed metaphorically close to the wind before and he felt he had little choice but to do so again. It was an inspired decision.<br>
<br>Luck was also on Kerans's side. As he debated when to launch his ship's bid for freedom, a fully lit merchant ship, the <i>Kiang Ling Liberation</i>, appeared on the scene at 10 p.m. steaming downriver in the direction of Shanghai. Kerans seized the opportunity, gave the order to cut the <i>Amethyst</i>'s heavily lagged anchor cable and execute a 180 degree turn in the middle of the river and follow close behind the Chinese ship for as long as possible. Shortly afterwards the ruse was discovered by a PLA battery crew and an intense shelling of the ships began. Unfortunately for the <i>Kiang Ling Liberation</i> the PLA inexplicably concentrated its fire on her, reducing the Chinese vessel to a smoking hulk in a few minutes and the <i>Amethyst</i>, bearing a charmed life and with only one inconsequential hit, steamed on past the luckless passenger cargo ship downstream as fast as she could go. In the course of the next seven and a half hours <i>Amethyst</i> defied the odds&#151;passing PLA forts and gun posts, going successfully through a defensive boom&#151;and emerged triumphantly to meet the destroyer HMS <i>Concord</i> at the mouth of the river estuary. Kerans signalled Brind at the Far East station with a message that would soon be emblazoned across much of the world's press. It read simply: &#145;Have rejoined the fleet south of Woosung, no damage or casualties. God save the king.&#146; Kerans and the crew of the <i>Amethyst</i> now became the toast of a United Kingdom starved of success in the immediate post-war world. Their exploits on the Yangtze made them into instant celebrities at every port of call on their homeward voyage to Plymouth, but no one was accorded more praise than the quintessential <span class="italic">Boy's Own</span> hero John Simon Kerans.<br>
<br>Awarded the DSO by George VI in a special ceremony at Buckingham Palace on 17 November 1949 and promoted commander in December, Kerans's fame presented the Board of Admiralty with a problem: what was it to do with the new folk hero? Had Kerans really changed or was he still the anti-establishment rebel he had been in the past? In the interim period while the Admiralty waited to see whether Kerans had matured and become totally reliable, he was invited to go on the Royal Navy staff course at Greenwich in the new year. Later in 1950 he was appointed head of the Far East section of the naval intelligence division at the Admiralty in London. He remained in this position for two years before he was sent to take charge of the minesweeper HMS <i>Rinaldo</i>, which was serving with NATO forces in Europe (1953&#150;4). Thereafter, he became British naval attach&eacute; to Burma, Cambodia, Laos, Thailand, and Vietnam in 1954. This posting ended abruptly in the following year, when he was recalled to London, putting paid to any faint hopes he may have entertained of achieving flag rank before his retirement. Once again the Admiralty was bereft of ideas about what to do with him and so after a year spent essentially marking time he was enlisted on the sea officers' technical course at Portsmouth in 1957. This served as a prelude to his retirement from the service later in the same year at the comparatively young age of forty-two.<h2>
<a name="Significance"></a>Significance</h2>Whatever the scale of his misdeeds may have been, Kerans remained a swashbuckling hero for many British people&#151;an individual who had shown great skill, resourcefulness, and tremendous courage in defying both the Yangtze and the communists in order to regain freedom for the <i>Amethyst</i> and her crew. A popular version of events was filmed as <span class="italic">Yangtse Incident</span> (1957), starring Richard Todd. As such, he remained much in demand in the public arena for some years to come. Approached by the Conservative Party, he was adopted as its candidate for the north-eastern constituency of the Hartlepools, which he unexpectedly won for the tories by 182 votes in the general election of 1959. Kerans's tenuous hold over this highly marginal constituency faltered as the Conservatives weakened in the early 1960s, and this contributed to his decision not to stand for re-election to parliament in October 1964. Only forty-nine, Kerans still had something to offer the country, but some of the lustre attached to his name had by then worn off&#151;the Yangtze incident had become but a pale memory for many, and the world had moved on. He eventually joined the civil service and served for eleven years on the Pensions Appeal Tribunal until he retired at sixty-five in 1980. He and his wife, Stephanie, continued to live at Oxted, Surrey, but his health steadily deteriorated and he died in the local hospital of cancer on 12 September 1985.<br>
<br>Although John Simon Kerans was a reckless character with an unfortunate tendency to undermine his true potential, he was also an individual who turned his undoubted gifts to great advantage in the most perilous of circumstances. In doing so he achieved a heroic status and gave the British people something to cheer about amid the unrelieved dreariness and austerity of the cold war.<br>
