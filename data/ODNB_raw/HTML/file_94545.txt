<span class="headword">Charleton, Sir  Robert</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1395/6), <span class="occ">justice</span>, was the son of Wibert Charleton (<i>d</i>. in or before 1362), a member of a minor landowning family which took its name from Charlton in Wiltshire, a few miles north-east of Malmesbury. Robert, who had at least one brother, named Richard, is first recorded in July 1375, when he was appointed a peace commissioner for Wiltshire and Somerset, and thereafter his judicial activities were fairly widely scattered across the west of England and the counties of the Welsh marches. In September 1377 he was commissioned to investigate confederations in Wiltshire of men who claimed, on the authority of &#145;exemplifications&#146; taken from <span class="roman">Domesday Book</span>, to be exempt from labour services. This commission was one of three (the others were appointed in Devon and Surrey) to be created in response to a surge of peasant unrest in these regions&#151;the so-called &#145;great rumour&#146;. When the peasants' revolt broke out four years later Charleton was one of the justices who in June 1381, immediately after the rebellion, were entrusted with the task of &#145;resisting and punishing&#146; the insurgents in Wiltshire and Gloucestershire. Then in March 1382 he was a member of a second commission, for Gloucestershire only, which was charged by parliament with arresting rebels and leading the county posse against any overlarge gatherings within the county. In other commissions Charleton seems to have been particularly closely associated with the town of Gloucester: one commission, in May 1381, required that he and his colleagues should investigate whether the men of Gloucester had the right to throw filth on a plot of land in the town near the castle gate, a practice which was reported to be causing a horrible stench and great annoyance to people living in the vicinity; another, in March 1382, involved the reformation of abuses in the town's hospital of St Bartholomew.<br>
<br>In January 1383 Charleton was made a serjeant-at-law, and from this point he regularly served on commissions of assize or gaol delivery, while continuing to receive appointments to <i>ad hoc</i> commissions in Wiltshire, Gloucestershire, and Shropshire, and to peace commissions. In November 1385 he was appointed a JP in Herefordshire, Oxfordshire, Bristol, and Wiltshire, and in August 1386 he served on the peace commission for Staffordshire. He was also appointed to a commission for embankments covering the Thames region in Essex in June 1384. Charleton's career to this point had followed a steady if rather unspectacular upward trajectory. On 30 January 1388, however, his position was transformed by his appointment as chief justice of the common bench. An annuity of &pound;40 and a grant of two tuns of Gascon wine accompanied his new office. Since he had no previous experience on the bench this represented a remarkable elevation. Nothing is known of any direct connection between Charleton and the lords appellant, who had control of government at this point and who were no doubt responsible for his appointment, but he was evidently close to William Wykeham, bishop of Winchester, for whom he several times acted as a feoffee in the early 1380s. This provides the likeliest explanation for Charleton's extraordinary promotion, for Wykeham was sympathetic to the appellant cause and had benefited directly from the downfall of Richard's favoured courtiers and ministers (including, significantly, that of Charleton's predecessor on the bench, Sir Robert Bealknap).<br>
<br>Just as remarkable as Charleton's promotion was his ability to steer what appears to have been an uncontentious path through the difficult months of 1388. A man in his position would have found it difficult to avoid active involvement in the dubious proceedings of the Merciless Parliament of February 1388, when many of Richard II's courtiers were tried and executed; and yet in May 1389, soon after Richard II had reasserted his authority, Charleton was granted 80 marks and two robes a year, in addition to the largess he had received from the appellants. It was also at this point that he was made a knight-banneret. He attended at least seven of the eight parliaments that met between February 1388 and January 1395 (records do not survive for the assembly of September 1388), and served as a trier of petitions on each occasion. Charleton remained both chief justice of the common bench and an active commissioner until Michaelmas 1395. A fine of 12 November 1395 indicates that he was still alive then, but his subsequent disappearance from the records suggests that he died soon afterwards; his successor on the bench was appointed on 15 January 1396. He appears to have married twice. A fine of 1379 records him with a wife named Katherine, who seems likely to have been the mother of his son and heir, Walter. She died at an unknown date, and Sir Robert married Elizabeth, sister of John Huntercombe (<i>d</i>. 1382), lord of the Buckinghamshire manor of Eton. She died childless in 1391.<br>
