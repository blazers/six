<span class="headword">Mewtas <span class="st"> [Mewtis]</span>, Sir  Peter</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1562), <span class="occ">soldier and courtier</span>, was the son of Philip Mewtas and Elisabeth Foxley, and grandson of Frenchman John Mewtas, French secretary to Henry VII and Henry VIII between 1491 and 1522. He was a man of action: tall, thickset, with a long fair beard, and expert in small arms, first coming to notice in Thomas Cromwell's circle. He was active in the suppression of the Pilgrimage of Grace in 1536 and was said in 1538 to have been to France in order to shoot Cardinal Pole, though this may have misinterpreted missions of 1537&#150;8, when Henry sent him to explore the king's marrying Marie de Guise.<br>
<br>Mewtas was appointed gentleman of the privy chamber (1536), master of Bethlem Hospital (1536), comptroller of the mint (1537), overseer of artillery (1537), keeper of Wanstead Park (1540), governor of Guernsey (1545), and chancellor of the tenths of the household (by 1546). He married Jane Astley, a lady of the queen's privy chamber, in 1537; and, by 1552, another Jane, perhaps surnamed Angersley, about whom little is known. In 1539 he and the first Jane were granted lands at West Ham, Essex, to which was added the adjacent manor of Bretts in 1540. A child was baptized in February 1539, probably Henry, or perhaps Frances, later gentlewoman of the chamber to Elizabeth I and wife of Henry, Viscount Howard of Bindon. There were other sons, Thomas and Hercules, the youngest. Mewtas's widow and Frances were given a new lease of Bretts in 1565 and, in 1567, enjoyment of it for Jane's life; she died in 1577.<br>
<br>Mewtas was one of the English dignitaries greeting Anne of Cleves at Calais in 1540. It was probably about this time that he received from Duke Philip of Bavaria, who was of the same party and a suitor to the Princess Mary, that &#145;best diamonte&#146; bequeathed in his will to Frances. Mewtas resigned the comptrollership of the mint in 1542. The following year he furnished 200 men for service at Gu&icirc;nes. He was knighted on 18 May 1544 on campaign at Butterden, leading 500 hackbutters. In Guernsey he oversaw works at Castle Cornet, including the construction of the Mewtas Bulwark, employing the engineer John Rogers. In 1546 he appears to have gone undercover in France: an English agent matching his appearance was sighted in Normandy that October.<br>
<br>Henry VIII willed 200 marks to Mewtas, as one deserving a token of special affection. In February 1547 he conveyed to France notice of Edward VI's accession. At Rye on 6 July 1551 he was deputed to greet Jean d'Albon, Mar&eacute;chal de St Andr&eacute;, on the latter's embassy to invest Edward with the order of St Michel, apparently receiving from the <i>mar&eacute;chal</i> a brooch and chain which Frances also came to inherit. Under Edward, Mewtas continued to supervise the defences of Guernsey and represent royal interests in the island, where he was ordered to see that reformed church services were observed and ecclesiastical goods protected from misappropriation.<br>
<br>At the king's death Mewtas joined Northumberland's attempt to subvert the Tudor succession, reputedly contributing a significant contingent of followers. This led to his imprisonment and loss of office by September 1553. He was also implicated in an attack with a knife upon a resident of a village near London who favoured the mass. He was committed to close prison in the Fleet in March 1555, but the following month was permitted to enter a &pound;500 recognizance.<br>
<br>Elizabeth's accession saw Mewtas's return to favour. In August 1559 he visited Fran&ccedil;ois II with the queen's condolences on the death of Henri II. Throckmorton, impressed by Mewtas's protestantism, repeatedly recommended he should succeed him as ambassador in France. In 1561 Mewtas was in Scotland, pursuing ratification of the treaty of Edinburgh. Back in France in July 1562, on a somewhat ill-defined mission to the prince de Cond&eacute;, he fell sick at Dieppe, dying there in August or September 1562, and was buried there in September, in the course of activities representative of his career and ancestry: on French business, employing diplomatic and martial experience in the interests of protestantism and the English crown.<br>
