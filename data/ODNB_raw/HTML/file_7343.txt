<span class="headword">Dawson,  Ambrose</span>  (1705/6&#150;1794), <span class="occ">physician</span>, son of William Dawson (<i>c</i>.1677&#150;1762), of Langcliff Hall, Yorkshire, and his wife, Jane, daughter of Ambrose Pudsay, was born at Settle, Yorkshire. William Dawson was an able mathematician and a friend of Isaac Newton. After attending Giggleswick School, Dawson entered Christ's College, Cambridge, in 1724, and he graduated MB in 1730 and MD in 1735. In 1737 he was elected a fellow of the Royal College of Physicians; he was censor four times, and he delivered the Harveian oration in 1744. His oration was printed the following year. He was elected physician to St George's Hospital on 27 April 1745 and held the office until 1760. Dawson lived in Grosvenor Street, London, and was known for his kindness to the poor. When he gave up practice in 1776, the parish of St George's, Hanover Square, presented him with a magnificent tea urn in recognition of his services to the poor of the parish.<br>
<br>Dawson retired to his father's estate at Langcliff Hall, but he did not entirely lose interest in medicine. In 1778 he published <span class="italic">Thoughts on the Hydrocephalus internus</span> and <span class="italic">Observations on Hydatids in the Heads of Cattle</span>. Little was known at the time about the anatomical changes which accompany effusion into the cavities of the brain and nothing was known of the natural history of the entozoa. The publications aroused little interest either at the time or in later years. Dawson regretted giving up practising medicine, and the inactivity affected his health. A little later he moved to Liverpool, where he died on 23 December 1794. He was ill for only a few days, and at the time of his death he was the oldest fellow of the Royal College of Physicians. He was buried at Bolton, Craven, Yorkshire, the home of his mother's family.<br>
