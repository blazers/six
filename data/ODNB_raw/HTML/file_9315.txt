</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Ferguson,  Adam</span>  (1723&#150;1816), <span class="occ">philosopher and historian</span>, was born on 20 June 1723 in the village of Logierait, Perthshire, the youngest of nine children born to Adam Fergusson (1672&#150;1754), the parish minister, and his wife, Mary (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1680), daughter of Patrick Gordon, ninth laird of Hallhead in Aberdeenshire. On his mother's side Ferguson was descended from the dukes of Argyll. Ferguson's father was the son of a smith, distantly related to the Fergusson family of Dunfallady. Ferguson chose to omit what he considered a superfluous &#145;s&#146; in his father's surname, &#145;on the ground that it was unnecessary, and therefore unworthy of a philosopher&#146;  (Fagg, c).<h2>
<a name="Earlyyearseducationandmilitaryservice"></a>Early years, education, and military service</h2>Ferguson's &#145;singularly complete, and, for a man of letters, exceptionally eventful life&#146;  (<span class="italic">EdinR</span>, 48&#150;9) was moulded by his birthplace on the boundary between the Scottish lowlands and highlands. His upbringing introduced him to local, as well as British and European, cultural legacies. In childhood Ferguson acquired some knowledge of Gaelic alongside the Greek and Roman authors, and a taste for military glory counterbalancing a clerical bent. In later years his cosmopolitan disposition was always spiced by a keen awareness of the tension between the integrous community of the highland clans and the urban, polite, and commercial sensitivities of a modern age.<br>
<br>The young Ferguson was tutored at home by his father, and then attended parish school at Logierait. It was a good start. &#145;We are ever discovering the traces of the influence of the parish schools of Scotland in producing its great men&#146;, a biographer wrote over a century later  (McCosh, 255). Proceeding at the age of nine to grammar school in Perth, the young Adam excelled in Latin and wrote exceptionally good essays. His father intended him for the church.<br>
<br>In 1738 Ferguson was sent to St Leonard's College at St Andrews, having won a bursary that provided free board at the college table. He studied Greek, and by the first summer recess read the <span class="italic">Iliad</span> at a pace of 100 lines per day. His performance in mathematics was equally brilliant. He studied natural philosophy and attended courses in logic and moral philosophy. On 4 May 1742 Ferguson was awarded the degree of master of arts, and in November he enrolled in Divinity Hall.<br>
<br>Early in 1743, however, Ferguson left St Andrews for the University of Edinburgh. There, in the city that was to become his intellectual home, he began his divinity studies under professors John Gowdie and Patrick Cumming, and possibly attended William Cleghorn's lectures in moral philosophy. Ferguson avidly read and discussed philosophy with his peers. His circle of young divinity students included William Robertson, Alexander Carlyle, Hugh Blair, and John Home, the future leading lights of the Scottish Enlightenment. A fond acquaintance with the family of the architect William Adam, whose son Robert was Ferguson's friend, expanded his social horizons to include David Hume, Adam Smith, Alexander Wedderburn, and other noted Edinburgh scholars. According to an unconfirmed report by his eldest son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9316/', "Adam Ferguson")</script>, Ferguson acted during this period as private secretary to Andrew Fletcher, Lord Milton.<br>
<br>The military turn in Ferguson's career took place in summer 1745. His knowledge of Gaelic, family connections with the dowager duchess of Atholl, and an urgent need in the army for loyal whigs with a highlander background, all paved his way to an appointment as the deputy chaplain of the newly formed 43rd regiment of highlanders (renumbered 42nd in 1749), famous as the Black Watch. Ferguson was to serve under Lord John Murray, son of the duchess and half-brother to James, second duke of Atholl, patron of the Highland regiment. Ferguson had completed only two out of six years of divinity studies when he was speedily examined and ordained by the presbytery of Dunkeld on 2 July 1745.<br>
<br>Ferguson's alleged participation in the battle of Fontenoy (11 May 1745) was probably, as a recent biographer persuasively demonstrates, an unfounded story  (Fagg, xxiii&#150;xxiv). He joined the Black Watch during the time between his ordination on 2 July and his first sermon, preached on 11 September. Yet an anecdote told by Walter Scott and fondly repeated by Ferguson's biographers describes the young chaplain, sword in hand, leading the column of men at the battle of Fontenoy. Upon hearing his colonel's rebuke to the effect that such behaviour was incompatible with his church commission, he allegedly replied &#145;D&#151;n my commission!&#146; and threw it towards the speaker  (Scott, 19.313). Historical facts aside, the story is central to the way in which Ferguson was remembered in Scotland. It suggested that his martial spirit and love of valour typified his personality to a greater extent than his clerical calling. Judging by contemporary evidence on Ferguson's character, the story makes psychological sense.<br>
<br>Ferguson's political affinities were firmly Hanoverian. As the <span class="italic">Scots Magazine</span> was careful to point out in its obituary seventy years later, Ferguson &#145;is said <i>even then</i> to have prided himself on being a &#147;constitutional Whig&#148;&#146;; his classical erudition, and his family's Presbyterian &#145;ideas of political right&#146;, enhanced his &#145;love of freedom&#146; and &#145;endeared the House of Brunswick&#146;  (<span class="italic">Scots Magazine</span>, 418). These views echoed in his <span class="italic">Sermon preached, in the Ersh language, to his majesty's first highland regiment of foot, commanded by Lord John Murray, at their cantonment at Camberwell, on the 18th day of December 1745</span>. The sermon was translated into English and published in 1746 at the request of the duchess of Atholl. It was, pure and simple, &#145;a vigorous denunciation of the Pretender, of popery, and of France&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>).<br>
<br>In 1746 Ferguson was raised to the rank of principal chaplain to the Black Watch. In September 1747 he reportedly took part in the battle of Bergen-op-Zoom. He continued his service in the Black Watch until 1754, including two sojourns in Ireland. He remained in the British army for some nine years, and was proud of his military experience for the rest of his life. Not only did it help him to write a history of ancient Rome, it also touched a deep chord in his self-image as a man and a Scot. More than any other thinker of the Scottish Enlightenment, Ferguson was to insist on military valour as a corner-stone of civic virtue.<br>
<br>Ferguson left the active service of both army and church in 1754. Writing to Adam Smith from Groningen in October 1754, he asked to be henceforward addressed &#145;without any clerical titles, for I am a downright layman&#146;  (Small, 5). Yet he retained both his military commission (until 1757) and his ordination; he acted as an elder of the Church of Scotland during the 1760s, and possibly later. David Hume was therefore justified in speaking, in 1758, of &#145;The still Rev. Adam Ferguson&#146;  (Mossner, 392).<br>
<br>Ferguson remained on the continent for over a year longer as tutor to a Scottish law student, identified only as &#145;Mr Gordon&#146;, who studied first at the Dutch University of Groningen and then, from November 1754, at the University of Leipzig in Saxony. They lodged at the Leipzig home of the Frenchman El&eacute;azar de Mauvillon, a protestant convert who had translated Hume's <span class="italic">Political Discourses</span> into French. Ferguson complained in a letter to Adam Smith of having &#145;not met with any Glimmering of Taste, or very elegant Reflexions&#146;  (Ferguson to Smith, 1 Dec 1754; <span class="italic">Correspondence</span>, 1.11). Instead, he amused himself with anecdotes on Fontenelle and Voltaire purveyed by his landlord's French-speaking visitors. Mauvillon's cosmopolitan home thus allowed his young Scottish lodgers a glimpse into the witty world of the European Enlightenment.<h2>
<a name="Earlyintellectualandacademiccareer17561767"></a>Early intellectual and academic career, 1756&#150;1767</h2>Late in 1756 Ferguson returned to Edinburgh, where he was to reside for almost forty years. David Hume took an instant liking to him&#151;&#145;a Man of Sense, knowledge, Taste, Elegance, &amp; Morals&#146;  (Mossner, 254&#150;5). Ferguson joined the Select Society, a debating club founded in 1754 by a group of literati that included his old friends William Robertson, Hugh Blair, and Alexander Carlyle. He quickly made himself part of an influential Edinburgh circle of kirk moderates and lively men of letters.<br>
<br>Ferguson's activities during the late 1750s and early 1760s reflect both his own pursuit of public and academic standing, and his avid participation in the central issues of the day. Along with his friends from the Select Society he defied Presbyterian traditionalists by supporting the theatre production of <span class="italic">Douglas</span>, a play written by the moderate clergyman John Home. In an amateur staging of the play in 1756, Ferguson played the role of Lady Randolph. He proceeded to write a pamphlet in defence of the theatrical entertainment, deftly opposing Presbyterian obscurantism by evoking his countrymen's fear of cultural inferiority. The theatre, he argued, can teach virtue better than any other public diversion. Besides, it has existed &#145;in every civilized and polished nation&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Morality of Stage Plays Seriously Considered</span>, 1757, 22).<br>
<br>Literary ambition next focused on the tidings of a Scottish Homer, brought to Edinburgh by the young poet James Macpherson with his alleged translation of the poetry of a mythical Celtic bard, Ossian. In this affair, too, Ferguson was a key figure: his Gaelic background lent credibility to the project, and he was later forced into an awkward and defensive exchange with the English collector of ancient poetry, Bishop Thomas Percy, one of the most formidable critics who accused Macpherson of fraud.<br>
<br>These cultural skirmishes accentuated Ferguson's most cherished cause, the Scottish militia. For many Scots the creation of a citizen militia was a symbol of national pride, which by forbidding highlanders to carry arms, parliament made impossible after the Jacobite rising of 1745. Ferguson was a central figure in the spirited, yet unsuccessful, militia agitation. His pamphlet <span class="italic">Reflections Previous to the Establishment of a Militia</span> (1756) focused on the problems which occupied his Scottish contemporaries and challenged his own later works: is economic strength compatible with traditional public virtue? Can a nation, in his words, &#145;mix military spirit; and commercial policy&#146;  (ibid., 3)?<br>
<br>A second pamphlet on the militia issue, targeting the haughty mistrust that typified English views of Scotland, appeared in 1761 under the title <span class="italic">The history of the proceedings in the case of Margaret, commonly called Peg, only lawful sister to John Bull esq.</span> The title was a satirical allusion to John Arbuthnot's <span class="italic">History of John Bull</span> (1712), with Scotland poised as Bull's hapless sister. Despite several attempts to attribute the anonymous pamphlet to David Hume (including an edition by David Raynor in 1982), it has been substantiated, and widely agreed, that Ferguson was its author. Here in his discussion of military prowess as an aspect of civic vivacity, Ferguson turned the militia campaign from a failed political cause to a fruitful opportunity for cultural reflection. He co-founded, and probably also named, the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/73613/', "Poker Club")</script>, established in 1762 to stir up the militia issue. Outlasting its initial aim, the club remained a social and intellectual caucus of Edinburgh luminaries for over twenty years.<br>
<br>During the same period Ferguson's friends helped launch his professional career. David Hume was instrumental in securing the election of Ferguson, in January 1757, as his own successor to the keepership of the Advocates' Library in Edinburgh. In October of the same year Ferguson resigned his military commission. In January 1758 he left the librarian's post, having been appointed tutor to the sons of the earl of Bute. &#145;Notwithstanding the Scotch are suspected by the English of possessing the gift of second sight&#146;, quips the <span class="italic">Scots Magazine</span> obituary, &#145;&hellip; yet it is probable that Mr Ferguson, with all his wisdom, did not foresee that the representative of this noble family would soon become the favourite of the king, and even prime minister of Great Britain&#146; (<span class="italic">Scots Magazine</span>, 420; Bisset, 431&#150;2). By leaving his post in 1759, Ferguson may have missed an easy opportunity to enter political life. He made up for this by becoming a prominent scholar.<br>
<br>In July 1759, again helped by Hume, Ferguson was called at short notice to the chair of natural philosophy at the University of Edinburgh. Ferguson cleverly managed, as Hume noted with mildly ironic admiration, to keep just abreast of his students during the first year of course work. Ferguson's prized post, which he obtained in 1764, was the Edinburgh chair of pneumatics (philosophy of the mind) and moral philosophy. As a teacher, Ferguson now came into his own. The popularity of his lectures, with both students and high-ranking free listeners, eventually increased his &pound;100 annual salary to about &pound;300 from fees  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>). An honorary degree of LLD followed in December 1766.<br>
<br>In 1766 Ferguson courted and married Katharine Burnet (1746&#150;1795), the favourite niece of his relative, the chemist Joseph Black. It was, the sources tell us, a happy union. Four sons and three daughters were born, and Ferguson was a kind paterfamilias, if not always an easy one. Despite several prolonged journeys away from home, he evidently enjoyed life with his family. He also spent energy and expense on a farm, Bankhead, rented in 1765, where he delighted in experimenting with modern agricultural techniques. Settled, successful, and sociable, Ferguson now kept company with some of Scotland's most illustrious men. &#145;Amicable in his life, character, and temper&#146; a contemporary recalled, &#145;he never was swayed by any difference of opinion, either religious or political &hellip; and David Hume and Henry Dundas, by turns, were entertained and visited by him&#146;  (<span class="italic">Scots Magazine</span>, 420).<h2>
<a name="AnEssayontheHistoryofCivilSociety1767"></a>An Essay on the History of Civil Society (1767)</h2>In 1767 Ferguson published his masterpiece, <span class="italic">An Essay on the History of Civil Society</span>. The book was possibly an expanded version of an earlier <span class="italic">Essay on Refinement</span> written in 1759, but subsequently lost. Hume, who thought that the early version &#145;will make an admirable Book, and discovers [<i>sic</i>] an elegant and a singular Genius&#146;  (Hume to Smith, 12 April 1759, <span class="italic">Correspondence of Adam Smith</span>, 34), was somewhat disappointed with the <span class="italic">Essay</span>, perhaps because of the crucial role of civic virtue in Ferguson's theory of government. Yet the <span class="italic">Essay</span> quickly attracted prominent admirers and numerous readers in Edinburgh, London, and abroad.<br>
<br>The <span class="italic">Essay</span> touched a chord in its British readers because it offered a detailed, colourful, non-deterministic historical account of the way nations advance morally and materially towards the state of commerce, refinement, and liberty associated with eighteenth-century Britain. A psychological introduction, &#145;Of the general characteristics of human nature&#146;, is followed by two historical discussions, &#145;Of the history of rude nations&#146; and &#145;Of the history of policy and arts&#146;. The final three parts, &#145;Of consequences that result from the advancement of civil and commercial arts&#146;, &#145;Of the decline of nations&#146;, and &#145;Of corruption and political slavery&#146;, present a historical-cum-moral analysis of the inherent evils that modern society must confront.<br>
<br>Ferguson's diagnosis of the problems of advanced commercial society was an assertive civic version of the Scottish attempt to work out the coexistence of wealth and virtue. His &#145;virtue&#146; strongly echoed the Aristotelian political virtue and the Machiavellian <i>virt&ugrave;</i>; but his economic analysis of morality was distinctly modern. The real danger in modern times, he said, was not luxury, but political laziness. Riches and material well-being did not in themselves cause or imply moral degeneration. Modern commercial success, however, encouraged the well-to-do to stay out of politics, hence away from virtuous life. What matters, then, is not the wealth amassed by members of society, but the retaining of their political personae: a trader, a craftsman, or a &#145;man of the world&#146; must never cease to be a citizen. This reworking of the civic creed was Ferguson's distinct philosophical voice in the Scottish Enlightenment.<br>
<br>Ferguson's <span class="italic">Essay</span> was an important book for another reason. Like Hume's philosophical works and Smith's <span class="italic">Theory of Moral Sentiments</span>, it conveyed to a broad readership the wide-ranging insights of the Scottish Enlightenment. The Edinburgh literati, as their readers in London and Paris appreciated, were able to derive universal significance from the questions of post-Union Scottish identity. Informed by Charles-Louis Montesquieu's <span class="italic">De l'esprit des lois</span> (1748), Ferguson rejected the legalistic accounts of the rise of states in terms of social contracts, and cast doubt on the simplistic economic and moral evolutionalism associated with theories of natural law. Instead, he followed Montesquieu by acknowledging a great variety of factors, climatic and geographic, as well as cultural and moral, affecting the rise and fortunes of polities in Europe and beyond. Ferguson's <span class="italic">Essay</span> was a book about universal history and progress. It discussed primitive nations without naming the highlands, modern economic change without dwelling on the lowlands, and forms of government without directly referring to Scotland's recent constitutional change. Yet Scotland was clearly on the author's mind as he considered the essence of political liberty, and readers were implicitly invited to ponder the British state and its new empire when other states and empires were discussed.<br>
<br>The <span class="italic">Essay</span> established Ferguson's reputation as a British and a European historian with a Scottish edge. It enabled him to deal with questions which concerned Enlightenment thinkers throughout Europe: the nature of political society, differences between nations reflecting temporal and geographical variations, patterns of progress and decline, types of government, and the tension between the &#145;private&#146; man, involved in commerce and polite conversation, and &#145;public&#146; man, the politically active citizen.<br>
<br>The <span class="italic">Essay</span> made its author famous throughout Europe. It was hailed by men of letters as diverse as James Boswell, Baron d'Holbach, and Friedrich Heinrich Jacobi. Of special significance was the <span class="italic">Essay</span>'s impact on the early attempts at creating the disciplines of social sciences by Ferguson's contemporaries at the University of G&ouml;ttingen. They were impressed by his comparative attitude to societies ancient and modern, and by his attack on Rousseau's concept of the state of nature. Ferguson's approach inspired a comparative ethnography that went beyond the traditional dichotomy between &#145;primitive&#146; and &#145;civilized&#146;, and tried to map the varieties of social mores without grading them on a strict ladder of historical progress. At the same time, most of his sociologically minded readers were taken aback by his preference for classical republics over modern monarchies  (Oz-Salzberger, chap. 10).<br>
<br>The <span class="italic">Essay</span> paved the way for Ferguson's subsequent works, eagerly awaited by his continental readers. His books were admired by Herder and Hamann and stirred the soul of the Romantic poet Novalis. Yet for British readers the <span class="italic">Essay</span> remained his masterpiece: seven editions appeared in Britain prior to Ferguson's death. None were to follow until 1966. Elsewhere, English-language editions came out in Dublin, Boston, and Basel. A German translation appeared in Leipzig in 1768, and a French one in Paris in 1783.<h2>
<a name="Writingstravelsandpolitics17681784"></a>Writings, travels, and politics, 1768&#150;1784</h2>In 1769 Ferguson published a textbook based on his classroom lectures, <span class="italic">The Institutes of Moral Philosophy for the Use of Students in the College of Edinburgh</span>. It offered a compact outline of philosophical issues such as human nature, the mind, the knowledge of God, moral laws, jurisprudence, and politics. Despite its terse and sometimes shorthand style, the book was successful in Britain, where it ran to three editions, and very successful in Germany and in Russia, where it became a favoured university text. Significantly, Ferguson's fame on the continent rested not on the <span class="italic">Essay</span> but on the <span class="italic">Institutes</span>, although he and his British readers clearly saw the earlier book as his <i>magnum opus</i>.<br>
<br>By 1772 Ferguson's reputation as a political thinker attracted the attention of government circles in London. He was considered for a commission &#145;to regulate the disorderly state of our affairs in India&#146;. The Scottish member of parliament George Dempster wrote that if Ferguson were elected to the commission, &#145;notwithstanding prejudices to our country&#146;, then &#145;I shall almost fancy the days of Solon and Licurgus [<i>sic</i>] are return'd. <i>Redeunt Saturnia regna</i>&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters</span>, 75&#150;6).<br>
<br>In 1773 Ferguson was invited to act as tutor to the young earl of Chesterfield on his grand tour of Europe. The proposed annuity of &pound;400 during the earl's minority and &pound;200 for life was too tempting to refuse, although Ferguson's prompt departure caused an unsavoury conflict with the university authorities. For a year Ferguson and his charge travelled through France and Switzerland. At home, the ever-generous Hume successfully plotted with Adam Smith to save their friend from the town council's threat of imposing resignation from his professorship.<br>
<br>One of the highlights of the journey was Geneva, where Ferguson was able to get in touch, simultaneously, with two extremities of his intellectual world. While lodging in the house of Jean Calvin and reading the manuscripts of the founder of his creed, Ferguson also paid several visits to Ferney and respectfully laughed at the blasphemous jokes of the ageing Voltaire, &#145;till I began to be considered&#146;, he wrote to Alexander Carlyle, &#145;as a person who, tho' true to my own faith, had no ill humour to the freedom of fancy in others&#146;  (Ferguson to Carlyle, 29 April 1775, <span class="italic">Correspondence</span>, 1.124).<br>
<br>A timely return to Britain launched Ferguson into the American crisis, first as a writer and then as a diplomatic envoy. In response to Richard Price's <span class="italic">Observations on the Nature of Civil Liberty, the Principles of Government, and the Justice and Policy of the War with America</span>, Ferguson wrote a counter-pamphlet that was published at government expense in 1776. Ferguson's piece, <span class="italic">Remarks on a Pamphlet Lately Published by Dr. Price</span>, was a balanced and uncommonly courteous reply to Price's defence of the rebels. Ferguson, who had befriended Benjamin Franklin when the latter visited Edinburgh a few years before, endorsed the colonists' complaints against parliament's narrow-minded mercantilism. Yet he strongly denounced their use of violence. Furthermore, their war against Britain was a bad historical wager.<blockquote>Is Great Britain then to be sacrificed to America &hellip; and a state which has attained high measures of national felicity, for one that is yet only in expectation, and which, by attempting such extravagant plans of Continental Republic, is probably laying the seeds of anarchy, of civil wars, and at last of a military government &hellip;? (<span class="italic">Remarks on a Pamphlet</span>, 59)</blockquote>The pamphlet was well received in London. In spring 1778 Ferguson was invited, probably at the suggestion of Sir William Pulteney, to accompany the Carlisle commission sent to negotiate an agreement with George Washington and the American congress. On 6 June 1778, upon their arrival in Philadelphia, Ferguson was made official secretary to the commission. He was dispatched to the rebels' pickets with a letter to congress, and flatly denied passage. The commission spent the summer in Philadelphia and New York, rejected and then ignored by congress. Ferguson may have been the chief or sole author of the maligned <span class="italic">Manifesto and Proclamation</span>, calling American individuals or states to meet the commission on separate terms  (Sher, 273&#150;4). Several months after the commission's return to Britain in December 1778, Ferguson went back to his Edinburgh professorship. He was to be remembered in America primarily as a respected author. A Philadelphia reprint of the <span class="italic">Institutes of Moral Philosophy</span>, announced in 1771, was followed by reprints of all his major works.<br>
<br>Ferguson now favoured a strong military response to any act of rebellion. In 1782 he rejected an appeal from Christopher Wyvill, the leader of the Yorkshire Association, to support the cause of parliamentary reform. He cautiously distanced his own belief in civil rights and active citizenship from electoral radicalism: &#145;I sincerely believe that to preserve the rights of the people the Vigour of the Crown is not less necessary than their own&#146;, he wrote to Wyvill  (2 Dec 1782, <span class="italic">Correspondence</span>, 2.292).<br>
<br>In 1780 Ferguson suffered a major attack of paralysis, and, under the care of his relative Joseph Black, made a full recovery apart from extreme susceptibility to cold, and became a vegetarian. &#145;His hair was silky and white&#146;, wrote Lord Cockburn, &#145;his eyes animated and light blue; his cheeks sprinkled with broken red, like autumnal apples, but fresh and healthy; his lips thin, and the under one curled&#146;; with his many layers of warm clothes, &#145;He looked like a philosopher from Lapland&#146;  (<span class="italic">EdinR</span>, 48).<br>
<br>Ferguson's regained vigour served him well during a sour exchange, in 1781, with Thomas Percy over the authenticity of the poems of Ossian. Ferguson claimed that he had seen no reason to doubt Macpherson. Cleverly shifting the argument to hint at Percy's anti-Scottish chagrin, Ferguson retorted that the Ossianic epic &#145;appeared to me matter of some curiosity in the history of mankind, but very little as matter of vanity to one corner of this island, much less of jealousy to any other corner of it&#146;  (Ferguson to H. Blair, 15 Sept 1781, <span class="italic">Correspondence</span>, 2.276). Like Herder, the German admirer of Ossian, Ferguson acknowledged the literary value of &#145;pure&#146; primitive poems; but unlike Herder, he did not cling to them as a vehicle of modern cultural self-assertion.<br>
<br>During 1782 and 1783 Ferguson helped found the Royal Society of Scotland. His three-volume <span class="italic">History of the Progress and Termination of the Roman Republic</span>, narrating the rise and fall of the republic as a story of civic virtue and its corruption, appeared in 1783. The book was warmly received in Scotland, where excerpts were published in the <span class="italic">Caledonian Mercury</span> and the <span class="italic">Scots Magazine</span>. It won praise from Edward Gibbon, and went through two more English-language editions in 1799 and 1813. In the mid-nineteenth century it was still favourably mentioned by John Stuart Mill and reissued in the United States, where Ferguson's spirited discussion of Rome's republican heyday appealed to two generations of readers. Two French translations appeared in Paris, in 1784&#150;91 and in 1803&#150;10. A German translation appeared in Leipzig in 1784&#150;6.<br>
<br>Although the fame of Ferguson's <span class="italic">Roman Republic</span> was short-lived and eventually wholly eclipsed, it did more than any of Ferguson's books to determine its author's image as latter-day Roman, a worthy, if somewhat quaint, lover of virtue and liberty in their classical republican sense. Contemporaries and posterity came to view him as a moralist of stout but old-fashioned Stoic convictions. This image did little to keep his scholarship and political philosophy alive, but it lent the final three decades of his long life a glow of spirited integrity, not just as &#145;a man of the world and a high-bred gentleman&#146;, in the words of his friend Alexander Carlyle  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>) but as the fiery &#145;Scottish Cato&#146; that friends and biographers fondly recalled.<h2>
<a name="Retirementwritingsandtravels17851794"></a>Retirement, writings, and travels, 1785&#150;1794</h2>In 1785 Ferguson resigned his chair of moral philosophy and pneumatics, to be succeeded by his brilliant student Dugald Stewart. In order to ensure a continued income he was nominally appointed to the mathematics chair, together with John Playfair who performed the professorial tasks. The university payment, along with pensions from the government and from the earl of Chesterfield, added up to a fixed annual income of &pound;613  (Fagg, lxxiv). In 1787 he moved to Sciennes House, on the outskirts of Edinburgh. His friends dubbed the house Kamchatka. Ferguson remained remarkably active for three more decades. He hailed the French Revolution and followed its career with great curiosity and enthusiasm which exceeded that of a detached academic onlooker.<br>
<br>In 1792 appeared <span class="italic">The principles of moral and political science, being chiefly a retrospect of lectures delivered in the College of Edinburgh</span>, a two-volume philosophical work which brought together Ferguson's long years of teaching. A German translation appeared in Z&uuml;rich in 1796, and a French translation followed as late as 1821. The book was treated with respect in one of the most important retrospective discussions of Scottish philosophy, Victor Cousin's <span class="italic">Cours d'histoire de la philosophie morale</span> (1839&#150;40). As the <span class="italic">Principles</span> reveal, Ferguson's republican zeal had been toned down, though not abandoned, as a result of the American and the French upheavals. He strongly felt that Britain's present government, and its social and political <i>status quo</i>, were beneficial enough to override any advantages promised by hasty or violent innovations. Yet the French Revolution presented Ferguson&#151;to a greater extent than his fellow Scottish thinkers&#151;with a heady blend of national invigoration and social arousal, which his own civic beliefs could not allow him to brush aside.<br>
<br>Ferguson's attitude toward the revolution, as revealed in letters and in an unpublished essay, was exceptionally favourable. He immediately hailed it as a republican outburst, and subsequently felt that both his choice of historical focus on classical republicanism and his modern analysis of national spirit were being put to the test and magnificently vindicated. With a great measure of sympathy for the revolution's spirit, if not for its style, he followed the civic, imperial, and martial drama to its apex and end. The downfall of the French &#145;frivolous corrupted pretenders to Aristocracy&#146;  (Ferguson to Sir John Macpherson, 15 July 1799; <span class="italic">Correspondence</span>, 2.455) hardly alarmed him. The fervour of the French people and the effect of egalitarianism on the French army greatly thrilled him. Later, however, he acknowledged that the French republic could only live by its sword, and that Napoleonic France, though still a marvel of national spirit, must be opposed. At that point Ferguson was especially keen for British patriotism to live up to the French model.<br>
<br>These conclusions were not drawn from armchair reading alone. In 1793, planning a second edition of the <span class="italic">Roman Republic</span>, the septuagenarian Ferguson travelled via Germany to Rome, where he stayed for a while. On 26 September of the same year he was elected external member of the Royal Prussian Academy of Sciences and Arts. He subsequently corresponded with the academy on a topic both scientific and Scottish: the properties of strontium, the metallic element discovered in the village of Strontian. Possibly during the same journey, Ferguson was also made a member of the Royal Academy of Florence, the Arcadia at Rome, and the Etruscan Society of Antiquaries in Cortona. His last European tour was cut short by Britain's entrance into the war. He was back by May 1794.<h2>
<a name="Finalyears"></a>Final years</h2>On 23 March 1795 Ferguson's wife, Katharine, died. He thereafter moved to Neidpath Castle, near Peebles, intending to spend his last years in rural seclusion. A cold winter prompted a further move to Hallyards, a neighbouring mansion. Walter Scott visited Ferguson there in the autumn of 1797, and Ferguson took his guest to see David Ritchie, the &#145;black dwarf&#146;, who was to figure in Scott's tale of that name. In the autumn of 1809 Ferguson made his final change of residence, moving to St Andrews.<br>
<br>Despite his deteriorating eyesight, Ferguson continued writing and led a life of social exchange and political awareness to his last day. Around his neck, a neighbour reported, he wore a miniature of Madame de Sta&euml;l  (<span class="italic">EdinR</span>, 84n.). In 1801 he published <span class="italic">Minutes of the Life and Character of Joseph Black, M.D.</span>, in memory of his relative and friend who had died two years earlier. He continued writing essays, which remained unpublished until the late twentieth century, and letters to many correspondents.<br>
<br>Ferguson's four sons all served in the British army or navy. In November 1799 he lost his second son, Joseph, who had served as captain in Bengal. Another son, James, also served in India. The youngest, John Macpherson Ferguson, was a seaman and survived the wreckage of the vessel he commanded in February 1811. When a student reading the newspaper to Ferguson unexpectedly came upon a report of the wreckage, &#145;Old Adam simply said, &#147;Go on: read that again&#148;&#146;  (<span class="italic">EdinR</span>, 84n.). Ferguson's eldest son, the future Sir Adam, was in French captivity from 1812 to 1814.<br>
<br>Ferguson lived to rejoice at the news from the battle of Waterloo, read to him from the newspapers. &#145;The news of Waterloo&#146;, Walter Scott wrote, &#145;acted on the aged patriot as a Nunc Dimittis&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>). Ferguson died in St Andrews on 22 February 1816. His three daughters, Isabel, Mary, and Margaret, all unmarried, were at his bedside. His last words, &#145;amongst the most remarkable on record&#146;, were reportedly &#145;There <i>is</i> another world!&#146;  (<span class="italic">EdinR</span>, 85). He was buried in the grounds of the Old Cathedral at St Andrews. His epitaph, written by Scott, recorded the &#145;classic elegance, strength of reasoning, and clearness of detail&#146; in Ferguson's works, his &#145;unostentatious and steady perseverance in acquiring and diffusing knowledge&#146;, and his &#145;practice of public and domestic virtue&#146;  (<span class="italic">Correspondence</span>, 2.589).<h2>
<a name="Historicalsignificance"></a>Historical significance</h2>Ferguson's posthumous significance is no simple story. There is a telling difference between the figure he cut in his lifetime and his changing fortunes in the history of ideas. He should also be considered, from rather different angles, in terms of his Scottish, British, and European reputations.<br>
<br>As one of his biographers observed with a typical Victorian slant, Ferguson's life was not &#145;remarkable&#146;, because he &#145;lived and died in the social position in which he was born&#146;  (<span class="italic">EdinR</span>, 48&#150;9). In another sense, however, Ferguson's life story was remarkable enough: as contemporaries were well aware, his doctrine and his life blended better than most. He was a thoroughly political man&#151;a participant in political affairs, a teacher of political virtue, and an analyst of the history of polities.<br>
<br>Ferguson's immediate posterity remembered him as a highly esteemed &#145;character&#146;. He was seen as a man of classical moral stature, a dignified, though &#145;stormy&#146;, archetype of a Scotsman, and a memorable educator. George Dempster was in the habit of calling him &#145;my modern Epictetus&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters</span>, 342). For an <span class="italic">Edinburgh Review</span> biographer writing a century later, Ferguson epitomized a model character &#145;of the manliest type&#146;, who, although &#145;scarcely a man of genius &hellip; <i>was</i> more than he <i>did</i>&#146;, and was &#145;typical of the whole [Scottish] race in appearance, character, tastes, and fortunes&#146;. He was, in sum, &#145;the Scottish Cato&#146;  (<span class="italic">EdinR</span>, 48&#150;9).<br>
<br>Ferguson's significance in the history of ideas is a tale with several twists. In his own lifetime his reputation spanned the Scottish and English enlightenments, reached discerning readers and literary periodicals in France, Germany, and Italy, as well as university classrooms in Germany, Russia, and America. Admired by Samuel Johnson and d'Holbach, complimented by Gibbon and Voltaire, and esteemed by Hume and Smith, he was an important interlocutor in the complex web of Enlightenment discourse.<br>
<br>In the English-speaking countries, Ferguson's importance waned during the nineteenth century. He was still mentioned with approbation by John Stuart Mill, but Leslie Stephen doomed him off-handedly to oblivion as &#145;a facile and dexterous declaimer&#146;, a third-rate eclectic and a bad stylist  (Stephen, 2.182). The <span class="italic">Essay</span>, which eighteenth-century readers saw as Ferguson's masterpiece, became for Henry Gray Graham &#145;a superficial book&#146;  (Graham, 113, 118).<br>
<br>Yet on the continent Ferguson's works made a lasting impression. In France his work inspired Victor Cousin and August Comte. For over a century after the publication of the <span class="italic">Essay</span>, German scholars made distinct and creative uses of some of his ideas. Friedrich Schiller was enthralled by his ethics and possibly by his concept of play. Ferguson's ideas of civil society and economic needs made a profound, but convoluted and not easily traceable, impact on the thought of Georg Friedrich Hegel. Karl Marx made an explicit, though ruthlessly selective, use of his notion of division of labour, considering him Adam Smith's teacher on this matter. The German sociologist Werner Sombart and his Polish colleague Ludvik Gumplowicz applauded Ferguson as a pioneer of their discipline, the latter hailing him as the father of sociology  (Oz-Salzberger, 90). The amiable Enlightenment moralist thus assumed a new persona as a pioneer of comparative ethnography, an early theorist of structural social change, the first theorist of alienation, and the inventor of conflict sociology.<br>
<br>It was not before the mid-twentieth century that an awakened interest in the political thought of the Scottish Enlightenment attracted attention to Ferguson's Scottish context, and&#151;by extension&#151;to his political thought (Kettler; Forbes). More recent scholarship shed light on Ferguson's place in the classical republican tradition, his fundamental debate with Hume and Smith, and the ways in which his works reflected the tensions between the competing political languages of civic humanism, natural jurisprudence, commerce, and politeness. During the last two decades of the twentieth century Ferguson was taken up by intellectual and political discussants of civic activism. His idea of civil society has a novel appeal to those seeking a &#145;third way&#146;, combining market economy with conscientious public commitment. Conversely, Ferguson also triggered spirited defences of the freedom to lead a wholly private life. His multi-layered intellectual persona, and his particular blend of Scottish, British, and European concerns, were thus freshly relevant to political sensibilities on the threshold of the twenty-first century.<br>
