<span class="headword">Dilke, Sir  (Charles) Wentworth</span>, first baronet  (1810&#150;1869), <span class="occ">art patron</span>, was born in London on 18 February 1810, the only son of the civil servant, art critic, and <span class="italic">Daily News</span> editor <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7645/', "Charles Wentworth Dilke (1789&#150;1864)")</script> and his wife, Maria Walker (1790&#150;1850). He was known as Wentworth Dilke in order to distinguish him from his father. His eminent family included ancestors who had sat in the parliament of Elizabeth I and in the Long Parliament. By the seventeenth century they were known as &#145;sturdy reformers of the Puritan type&#146;  (Pearce, 8), and the family seat was Maxstoke Castle, in Warwickshire. Dilke was educated at Westminster School, and at sixteen, following his father's educational principles, he was sent to Florence to live with the painter Seymour Kirkup; thereafter he studied at Trinity Hall, Cambridge, and graduated LLB in 1834. In his early years in London, Dilke &#145;was principally known to his friends for never missing a night at the Opera&#146;  (Gwynn and Tuckwell, 6). After his marriage, on 30 March 1840 to Mary (<i>d</i>. 1853), daughter of William Chatfield, a captain in the Madras cavalry, Dilke began to follow his father's editorial and entrepreneurial example by founding the <span class="italic">Gardeners' Chronicle</span>, with John Lindley and Sir Joseph Paxton, and the <span class="italic">Agricultural Gazette</span>. His wide cultural and aesthetic interests, coupled with his horticultural and editorial work, led to his involvement in efforts to improve national education in design and technology.<br>
<br>From 1845 Dilke was party to the Society of Arts's discussions regarding the Great Exhibition; this brought him into close personal contact with John Scott Russell, Henry Cole, and Prince Albert. He served as both council member and chairman of the society. As one of the society's group who promoted the Great Exhibition, and then a member of the royal commission's executive committee for the exhibition from 1849 to 1851, he proved himself one of its most assiduous, organized, and hard-working members; he was one of the representatives appointed by Prince Albert to travel the country and sound out the public's views on the proposed exhibition. The executive committee, which also included Henry Cole, William Reid, Matthew Digby Wyatt, and Francis Fuller, co-ordinated and corresponded with local and international commissions formed to organize the exhibition, and oversaw the setting up and layout of the event. The exhibition itself would prove to be highly complex, vast in scale, and hugely successful. Dilke's role included investigating the best means of producing an exhibition catalogue; dealing with the press and publicity; strategically managing the often fractious local and international commissions; and overseeing the arrival and installation of exhibits. He also acted as Queen Victoria's trusted purchaser of goods at the exhibition. His deep involvement in the project is demonstrated by his massive bequest of exhibition material now held at the Victoria and Albert Museum. A reliable executor of the royal commission's directives, he was afterwards called on repeatedly to report on other such exhibitions (Dublin, 1852; New York, 1853; Paris, 1855; St Petersburg, 1868); he was also one of the five royal commissioners for the 1862 International Exhibition in London. Dilke was created baronet on 22 January 1862.<br>
<br>The Great Exhibition brought Dilke into contact with influential people, notably Lord Granville, who worked to bring him into parliament. In 1865 he was elected Liberal MP for Wallingford, although he lost his seat at the general election of 1868. The absorbing nature of his work in promoting and reporting on exhibitions, together with his meticulous, unostentatious nature, set him apart from his family. They lived at 76 Sloane Street, London, and at Alice Holt, a small country property near Farnham, Surrey. Mary Dilke, having given birth to two sons, was &#145;almost certainly unhappy in her marriage&#146;  (Jenkins, 13), and died in 1853. The first son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32824/', "Sir Charles Wentworth Dilke, second baronet (1843&#150;1911)")</script>, formed a close temperamental bond with his grandfather and disparaged his father's work on exhibitions as pen-pushing. Charles eventually overshadowed his father as a well-known travel writer and Liberal MP. The younger son was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7644/', "Ashton Wentworth Dilke")</script>, traveller and politician.<br>
<br>Dilke died at the Hotel de France, St Petersburg, on 10 May 1869, while reporting there on the horticultural exhibition. The importance of mid-nineteenth-century exhibitions as agents of modernization and opportunities for the formation of complex economic and commercial links is only now being recognized. Dilke's role in this development was significant; Prince Albert awarded him a commemorative medal for his work on the Great Exhibition &#145;as one of those who stood by its cradle, helped in its education and served it truly and zealously after it had been brought to maturity&#146;  (Prince Albert to Dilke, 15 Oct 1851, F25, the Great Exhibition of 1851, 1851&#150;3, Royal Archives, Windsor).<br>
