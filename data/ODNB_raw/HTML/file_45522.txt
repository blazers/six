<span class="headword">Crawford <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Johnstone]</span>,  Emily</span>  (1831?&#150;1915), <span class="occ">journalist</span>, was born, possibly on 31 May 1831, at Corboy, co. Longford, Ireland, one of four daughters and seven sons of Andrew Johnstone (1798&#150;1863) and his wife, Grace-Anne Martin (<i>d</i>. 1883); the family were Church of Ireland. Educated at home, mainly by her mother who taught her to read, by the age of eight she was reading a <span class="italic">Dictionary of the Lives of Illustrious Women</span> and, while still a child, she devoured Sir Walter Scott's poetry and novels, as well as Shakespeare and biographies of European kings. On Andrew Johnstone's death in 1863 his widow and her two daughters moved to Paris.<br>
<br>Emily remedied her lack of formal education by attending lectures at the Sorbonne and studying painting. Her initiation into journalism was prompted by another Emily, the sister of Dr Elizabeth Blackwell, showing some of her letters to a friend who then recommended her to write a Paris letter for a San Francisco newspaper, and she also sent one to the London <span class="italic">Morning Star</span>. Since Emily Johnstone counted four American newspapermen among her relatives and one, Melville E. Stone, who founded the Chicago <span class="italic">Daily News</span>, later employed her, her choice of profession might not have seemed unusual, except for the fact that she was a woman.<br>
<br>Writing in 1864, her future sister-in-law, Mary Eleanor Crawford, described Emily as &#145;a literary lady and wonderfully clever making &pound;400 a year with her pen!! She writes articles in the <span class="roman">Scotch Quarterly</span>&#146;  (family archive). A friend described Emily around this time as &#145;a small, exquisitely-poised figure, brilliant complexion, true blue Irish eyes, and brown hair making up a striking personality&#146;  (<span class="italic">Young Woman</span>).<br>
<br>In 1864 Emily married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/52770/', "George Morland Crawford (1812&#150;1885)")</script>, whose friendship with William Makepeace Thackeray had earned him the post as assistant to the Paris correspondent of the <span class="italic">Daily News</span> in 1850. During her childhood Emily had become deeply conscious of her mother's legal inferiority to her father, so in her marriage contract Emily Crawford stipulated that if any serious disagreement should arise, both parties were free to leave and lead separate lives. Yet this never occurred in their twenty-one years of happy marriage, which produced three sons and a daughter.<br>
<br>When Henry Labouchere arrived in Paris in 1870, as one of the new proprietors of the <span class="italic">Daily News</span>, the couple were recognized as a journalistic team&#151;so much so that Labouchere dispatched them, with their family, to the safety of Tours on the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War. They returned to report on the events of the commune and Emily gained a great scoop by interviewing Communard leaders as they sat in council on 23 March 1871. Regarded by fellow journalists as the equal of Henri de Blowitz as an interviewer, Emily frustrated Blowitz's attempt to usurp George Crawford's prestigious position in the press gallery of the national assembly, where, despite advancing years, George continued to devil for her until his sudden death in 1885.<br>
<br>Having inherited her husband's position on the <span class="italic">Daily News</span>, Emily also contributed to the New York <span class="italic">Tribune</span> as well as to <span class="italic">Truth</span>, a weekly started in 1877 by Labouchere, where he told her to &#145;spread her wings&#146; and where, she thought, her best writings appeared. She was also a correspondent for the <span class="italic">Weekly Dispatch</span>, the <span class="italic">Calcutta Englishman</span>, and the Chicago <span class="italic">Daily News</span>, as well as a contributor to the <span class="italic">Contemporary Review</span>, <span class="italic">Macmillan's</span>, and the New York <span class="italic">Century</span>. Her contributions reflected her wide reading, on a daily basis, on politics and literature, of more than a score of newspapers. &#145;Observe, reflect, and be genuine&#146;  (<span class="italic">Young Woman</span>, 184) was her journalistic motto. She kept herself informed, developed an expertise on the works of Emile Zola, and maintained close friendships with George Sand, Victor Hugo, and George Meredith (to whom she was also related). But Emily Crawford also reported on, and explained, great political events in France such as the Panama Canal scandal, the Boulanger crisis, and the Dreyfus affair, which she played down in her <span class="italic">Daily News</span> articles, despite the efforts of her son Robert to support the Dreyfusards in the same paper.<br>
<br>Emily's articles were enhanced by the background knowledge the Crawfords had gathered from their friendship with many leading French politicians, such as Adolphe Thiers, Leon Gambetta, Sadi Carnot, and Georges Clemenceau. Gambetta was even godfather to Emily's only daughter, who tragically drowned in her late teens. As president of France, Sadi Carnot, the son of one of her earliest Parisian friends, Hippolyte Carnot, offered the L&eacute;gion d'honneur to Emily Crawford, which she declined, asking that it be awarded to her son Robert.<br>
<br>Politicians' views of Emily Crawford varied. Gladstone, after meeting her in Paris during 1883, described her as a somewhat careless and inaccurate journalist  (Gladstone, <span class="italic">Diaries</span>). To the American-schooled Clemenceau, however, Emily was &#145;a ripper. Most men [journalists] in tackling questions look merely at their frontage, [but she] gets behind, beneath, inside and through and through. I have never seen anyone like her&#146;  (R. Crawford, 61).<br>
<br>Emily's fellow journalists in England elected her a life fellow of the Institute of Journalists in 1890, and in 1901 she was president of the Society of Women Journalists. One of her last articles, for the <span class="italic">Fortnightly Review</span>, &#145;United States of Europe&#146;, reveals her longing for &#145;the emancipation of Europe from the military machine [which] would free her genius and enable it to soar to heights yet undreamt of&#146;  (<span class="italic">Fortnightly Review</span>, 74, 1903, 992&#150;1001).<br>
<br>After retiring from the <span class="italic">Daily News</span> in 1907, Emily continued her weekly letters to <span class="italic">Truth</span> until her death. Although she was disabled, requiring a wheelchair, her son Robert effected her evacuation to England before the advancing German army in 1915. She died from apoplexy on 30 December 1915 at 5 Vyvyan Terrace, Clifton, Bristol, aged eighty-four.<br>
