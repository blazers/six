<span class="headword">Allen,  Francis</span>  (<em>c.</em>1583&#150;1658), <span class="occ">politician and regicide</span>, was probably born in London, though nothing is as yet known of his early life or parentage. He first appears in the mid-1630s as a liveryman of the Goldsmiths' Company living on Fleet Street. He was one of those goldsmiths living in &#145;remote&#146; places who opposed attempts to force them back into the City by crown and company and to settle them in Goldsmiths' Row in Cheapside. Allen, a successful banker and financier with business interests in the Atlantic trade (he was an active member of the Bermuda Company), no doubt had good material reasons to resist. Suspended from the livery, when he refused the offer to rejoin in 1638 he explained that he was &#145;ready to doe the company&#146; service but &#145;desired to be excused if it were so that he must leave his dwellinge which he could no wayes consent unto without his undoing&#146;  (Griffiths, 189). However, his objection was also ideological. His original withdrawal, he maintained in 1644 (by when the company was more than happy to welcome back a man upon whom &#145;Parliament hath cast an eye of favour&#146;), had been because he conceived the order to return to the City &#145;to be altogether illegal and againste the right and liberty of the subject&#146;  (Griffiths, 190).<br>
<br>Allen was elected &#145;recruiter&#146; MP to the Long Parliament for Cockermouth in April 1642, and certified as such in April 1646. He became a commissioner of customs for parliament from 1643 to 1645 and was appointed one of the treasurers-at-war in March 1645, when the civil war was at a critical point, taking an active part in the financial administration of the war and in liaison with the Scottish army. In politics he was a radical figure, best labelled as a political Independent by the late 1640s. During the wardmote elections of 1642 he was active in the attempt to broaden the franchise in his ward of Farringdon Without upon which officers were elected. In January 1644 he was part of a hostile demonstration against the earl of Essex. In February 1646 he fell victim to the increasing tensions between parliament and the City when he was attacked for reporting to the Commons the details of a meeting between the Scottish commissioners and the presbyterian-dominated London common council (of which he was a member). The Scots had in barely coded terms denounced (and received a sympathetic hearing from their City allies) political and religious Independents for seeking to disturb the unity between the two kingdoms. At the end of the year, when the presbyterians triumphed in the wardmote elections, Allen lost his seat as councillor. He was from 1646 a presbyterian elder of St Dunstan-in-the-West, Fleet Street, the church of the prominent Independent William Strong. It has been suggested that in these years Allen is best thought of as a &#145;parochial Independent&#146;, one happy to maintain the parochial structure of the church, but Erastian in outlook and tolerant of gathered congregations  (Lindley, 278). In the later stages of his life he could well be described as an Independent.<br>
<br>Allen was nominated as one of the 135 commissioners (MPs and others) to form the high court of justice to conduct the trial of Charles I. The meetings of the court started on 8 January 1649 but Allen did not attend at the painted chamber in Whitehall until 17 January. Thereafter, however, he was in regular attendance, being recorded as present at nine out of twelve private meetings in the painted chamber and at all four sessions of the actual trial in Westminster Hall, including the final session on Saturday 27 January, in which the sentence of death was passed by all present (though he did not sign the death warrant). On 30 January (the day of the king's execution) he was appointed a member of the committee of the high court to arrange payments for the court and prepare its accounts [<i>see also </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/70599/', "Regicides")</script>].<br>
<br>Allen became one of the most active members of the Rump Parliament, often in alliance with his fellow London merchant, Richard Salwey. With Salwey he sat on the committee for establishing the Commonwealth's council of trade. He was by this time a very rich financier; he was elected alderman in 1649 and sheriff in 1651 and 1652. Throughout most of the history of the Rump he was a close political supporter of Oliver Cromwell, but in 1653 he fell out with him in the complicated debates about the dissolution of the house. When the parliament was dissolved by military force, Allen was one of the opponents bitterly attacked by Cromwell, and he was arrested by the army for a short time. Thereafter he dropped out of active politics. He died on 6 September 1658: an unnamed wife but no children are mentioned in his will. In the <span class="roman">Act of Indemnity</span> passed in August 1660 after the Restoration the name of Francis Allen appears with those of other deceased regicides exempted from indemnity in respect of &#145;all rights and properties&#146;.<br>
