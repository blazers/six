<span class="headword">Lewcock <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Ellis]</span>,  Constance Mary <span class="st"> [Connie]</span></span>  (1894&#150;1980), <span class="occ">suffragette and socialist</span>, was born at 7 West Street, Horncastle, Lincolnshire, on 11 April 1894, the only child of Thomas Henry Ellis (<i>d</i>. 1898), who owned a draper's shop in the town, and his wife, Emily Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Lessware. A precocious and, on her own admission, slightly spoilt girl, she read widely and joined a circulating library. However, her father's death when Connie was four affected her deeply. She regarded her mother's remarriage to a Methodist minister as a betrayal and loathed her stepfather who, she considered, thought about nothing but money and power. When they moved to Slough, she stayed with her aunt who ran the shop in Horncastle. There Connie developed into a lonely and wilful adolescent who was a natural rebel; she took up smoking but gave it up once the sight of a woman smoking in public had ceased to be shocking. After attending a dame school Connie won a scholarship to the grammar school in Horncastle where she remained until seventeen. Disappointed at her failure to win a place at university, she obtained employment as an uncertificated teacher at &pound;50 per annum at Esh Winning in co. Durham. There she taught a class of seventy-eight children from 1912 to 1914.<br>
<br>Connie Ellis had become an ardent women's suffragist at fourteen when she heard a speaker on the promenade at Dunoon: &#145;it was like St Paul; it was conversion &hellip; she made me feel that equality and freedom were the most important things in life&#146;, she recalled  (Lewcock and Harrison, interview, 15 April 1976). Towards the end of 1913 she visited the Women's Social and Political Union shop in Newcastle to offer her services: &#145;you're <i>not</i> to get arrested&#146;, she was promptly told  (ibid.). She served her apprenticeship as speaker and chairman at suffrage meetings throughout co. Durham, using the techniques she subsequently employed as a trade union and Labour Party organizer. At an Independent Labour Party (ILP) meeting at Cornsay colliery she met a sympathetic miner, Joss Craddock, who noticed the bruises she had acquired through being thrown out of meetings. Subsequently he accompanied her, placing himself behind her to keep the stewards at bay, saying: &#145;gan on hinney, ah can keep these buggers here all night&#146;  (Lewcock and Harrison, interview, 15 April 1977). Her work for the WSPU coincided with the climax of militancy in 1912&#150;14. She was involved in an unsuccessful attempt to set fire to a pier of Durham Cathedral, but the most notorious episode in her career occurred in the summer of 1914 when, aged twenty, she was responsible for burning a wooden railway building at Esh Winning, an action she later described as &#145;the perfect crime&#146;. She instructed the loyal Joss Craddock to set an inch of lighted candle in the centre of a tin lid containing flammable bicycle solution and to leave behind him some hairpins and a handkerchief bearing a &#145;C&#146;. Meanwhile she attended a meeting several miles away observed by at least thirty people. Though the police felt unable to prosecute, she was summoned by the education secretary for Durham who insisted that she gave up her political work: &#145;we don't think it's good for the image of teachers&#146;  (Lewcock and Harrison, interview, 15 April 1976). On refusing, she received one month's notice, which expired at the end of July 1914.<br>
<br>The outbreak of the First World War accelerated Ellis's transition from militant suffragist to Labour Party activist. Although she had previously accepted the leadership of Emmeline Pankhurst without criticism, Ellis rejected her increasingly right-wing, pro-war stance and felt that the suffrage campaign had effectively ended. On a visit to Newcastle she found herself drawn into a meeting for women munitions workers, and as a result was invited to undergo training with the Federation of Women Workers in London. On her return she went to Middlesbrough to organize munitions workers, and in 1917 she was employed by the ILP in its anti-war campaign in Cleveland at a weekly wage of &pound;2. In August 1918 she was charged with making seditious speeches because she had accused meat suppliers to the troops of making excessive profits. Tried at Guisborough, she was given the option of a &pound;5 fine or one month in prison; to her regret the ILP paid the fine.<br>
<br>Connie Ellis first met her husband, William Best Lewcock (1891&#150;1960), at an ILP meeting at Chopwell on May day 1914. The son of Thomas Lewcock, a coalminer, he also became a miner; educated at Ruskin College, Oxford, he was a conscientious objector during the war. He and Connie were engaged for four years before marrying at Horncastle Congregational Church on 6 August 1918; they had three children, Sheila, Peter, and Cynthia. &#145;If you marry Will, you'll always be second to the Cause&#146;, a friend had warned her. &#145;I should hope so&#146;, was Connie's characteristic reply  (Lewcock and Harrison, interview, 15 April 1976). After the war Will who, as a conscientious objector, found it impossible to gain employment, became a Labour Party agent. This led the family to move to Stroud and thence to Newport, Monmouthshire, where Connie served as a councillor from 1927. In this period she had no paid employment but worked as an unpaid secretary and speaker for Will. In 1934 Will was promoted to regional organizer for the Labour Party, first in York and then in the north-east from 1941 to 1955. After retiring, he served on Newcastle city council from 1956 until his death in 1960.<br>
<br>From 1960 until 1971 Connie Lewcock represented the Benwell ward on Newcastle city council, acting as chairman of the housing management committee and the parliamentary and general purposes committee and vice-chairman of the finance committee. Her lifetime of public service was recognized by the award of an OBE in 1966. She died at Newcastle upon Tyne General Hospital on 11 November 1980 after suffering an accidental fall outside the front door of her home in West Denton. Sir Jeremy Beecham, the former council leader, paid tribute to her as a remarkable character, an inspiration to the Labour movement, and as a humanizing element in local government  (<span class="italic">Newcastle Evening Chronicle</span>, 11 November 1980).<br>
