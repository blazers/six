<span class="headword">Strickland, Sir  Roger</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1640, <em>d.</em> 1717), <span class="occ">naval officer and Jacobite sympathizer</span>, was baptized on 2 February 1640 at Kendal, the second son of Walter Strickland (<i>d</i>. 1670&times;77) of Nateby Hall, Garstang, Lancashire, and his wife, Anne Croft (<i>d</i>. 1665&times;80). Walter Strickland was a member of a junior line of the Stricklands of Sizergh Castle, Westmorland, and fought for the king in the civil wars, compounding for delinquency in 1652. Roger entered the navy after the Restoration, becoming lieutenant of the <i>Sapphire</i> on 27 November 1661 and serving aboard her until the following July. He was then successively lieutenant of the <i>Crown</i> and the <i>Providence</i> prior to the outbreak of the Second Anglo-Dutch War, serving in the same post aboard the <i>Rainbow</i> from April to September 1665. He fought in her in the admiral's division of the White squadron (commanded by Prince Rupert) at the battle of Lowestoft on 3 June 1665. Strickland was lieutenant of the hired ship <i>Hamburg Merchant</i> late in 1665 before gaining his first command, the former Spanish prize <i>Santa Maria</i>, on 16 March 1666. Although his ship missed the Four Days' Battle in June, Strickland commanded her at the St James's day fight on 25 July, forming part of the Blue squadron, and remained aboard her until 5 December. He held no command in 1667, but commanded the <i>Success</i> in 1668&#150;9, the <i>Kent</i> in 1670&#150;71, and the <i>Antelope</i> briefly in January and February 1672. He took command of the <i>Plymouth</i>, of 58 guns, on 11 March 1672. At the battle of Sole Bay on 28 May, Strickland's ship formed part of the rear-admiral of the blue's division, and gained distinction by retaking the second-rate <i>Henry</i>, which had been captured by the Dutch; because of the death in the battle of the <i>Henry</i>'s captain, Francis Digby, Strickland was moved into her on 8 June. Later in the year Strickland was knighted for his gallantry at Sole Bay. He took command of the <i>Mary</i> on 19 September 1672 and continued in her until March 1674. He fought in all three battles of the 1673 campaign, being singled out by Rupert for his conduct at the first battle of Schooneveld (28 May) and the Texel (11 August). Following the end of the war, he went to the Mediterranean to join the campaigns under Sir John Narbrough against the north African corsairs, commanding successively the <i>Dragon</i> (September 1674 to November 1677), the <i>Centurion</i> (November to December 1677), the <i>Mary</i> again (December 1677 to January 1679), and the <i>Bristol</i> (January to September 1679). Strickland took part in a number of actions against the corsairs, notably the capture of a 40-gun Algerine vessel on 1 April 1678. He was appointed rear-admiral of the Mediterranean Fleet on 19 February 1678, but after his return to England in 1679 he retired from the service&#151;albeit reluctantly, as he regularly but unsuccessfully solicited for plum commands during the years 1680&#150;84.<br>
<br>Strickland bought an estate at Thornton Bridge, Yorkshire, from his cousin Sir Thomas Strickland MP in 1680, and in the following year inherited an estate at Catterick from his aunt Mary, widow of Richard Brathwaite. In 1681 he was also appointed deputy governor of Southsea Castle, thereby continuing his parallel career in the army which had begun when he became a captain in Prince Rupert's regiment in 1672, subsequently joining Lord Widdrington's regiment in 1673. In 1682 Strickland took over Sir Thomas's farm of the salt duties, and in 1684 leased the estates of a number of Lancashire recusants. This action was at best ironic, at worst distinctly suspicious, as Strickland's own religious beliefs had already been called into question during the Popish Plot, and many of his close relations remained openly Catholic. His brother was a member of the household of James, duke of York, becoming vice-chamberlain to Queen Mary of Modena when James became king, and James himself had been active in promoting Strickland's interests during the early 1680s. Within four days of his accession, James recalled Sir Roger to the navy, giving him command of the <i>Bristol</i> to convey the new ambassador to Constantinople&#151;duty which precluded his active attendance in parliament, to which he was elected as MP for Aldborough in March 1685. Although Strickland's career was also being promoted at this time by his friend George Legge, Lord Dartmouth, it owed little to one of Dartmouth's other close associates, the Admiralty secretary Samuel Pepys, who clashed often and bitterly with Strickland during 1685&#150;6, most notably over the latter's insistence on flying a special flag of distinction at all times and on other points of precedence, which Sir Roger always guarded jealously. Strickland's public conversion to Catholicism in the winter of 1686&#150;7 greatly strengthened his position: he became vice-admiral of the fleet going to the Mediterranean in July 1687, rising to the prestigious post of rear-admiral of England on 30 December. He used his new position to advance the careers of his co-religionists in the navy, and in the summer of 1688 was appointed to command the fleet guarding against Dutch naval preparations. His tactless introduction of Catholic priests onto the ships inspired a mutiny which James II had to quell in person, and when the fleet was expanded in September, Strickland was effectively demoted to rear-admiral, albeit under his friend Dartmouth. The fleet's failure to prevent William of Orange's invasion effectively ended Strickland's career. He resigned his commission on 13 December 1688, writing shortly afterwards that &#145;his heart and eyes are &hellip; full of grief and tears&#146;  (<span class="italic">Dartmouth MSS</span>, 1.238). Strickland soon followed James to France, serving in the Irish campaign of 1689 and aboard the French fleet in 1690; his name was included in a bill of attainder in 1689, but was struck out through lack of evidence, although his estates were subsequently confiscated in any case. He lived in exile at St Germain, where he died on 8 August 1717, having never married. He was buried in St Germain church the following day. The sequestration of his estates almost thirty years before, and the disputed legality of that action, led to prolonged litigation between and among his heirs and those who claimed various reversions on his lands.<br>
