<span class="headword">Garnett <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Hart]</span>,  Elizabeth</span>  (1839&#150;1921), <span class="occ">missionary to navvies and author</span>, was born on 23 September 1839 in Otley, Yorkshire. The first and apparently only child of Joshua Hart, vicar of Otley from 1837 until his death in 1867, and his wife, Hannah, she was educated at home. A strong Anglican as a result, she claimed that her interest in the navvies began when her father consecrated a memorial to those killed while building the nearby Bramhope railway tunnel. She married an Anglican clergyman, Charles Garnett (1834&#150;1862), the son of Peter Garnett, paper manufacturer in Otley, on 13 November 1861, but he died within a year of the marriage, on 13 October 1862, apparently while the couple were still on their honeymoon.<br>
<br>Nearly ten years later Garnett found a &#145;new vista of interest in a lonely life&#146;  (Garnett, &#145;Navvy Mission Society&#146;, 94) after a friend took her to see the navvy settlement at Lindley Wood, in Wharfedale, a few miles above Otley, where a reservoir was being built for the city of Leeds. After running a Sunday school for navvy lads there for nearly a year, Garnett moved to the settlement, despite family opposition. In 1874 Lewis Moule Evans, newly appointed vicar of nearby Leathley, also began missionary work at Lindley Wood. The Christian Excavators' Union (popularly known as the Navvies' Mission) was established in November 1877 after Evans, along with the eight teachers of the Navvy Sunday School, including Garnett, sent out some 400 letters of appeal to high-placed Anglicans throughout the nation. As a result Evans is recorded on his grave in Leathley parish churchyard as being the union's founder, but Garnett must be considered its co-founder, both because of her earlier work and because it was the royalties from her first publication, a &#145;navvy novel&#146; entitled <span class="italic">Little Rainbow</span> (1877), that provided the financial support for this appeal. Through her missionary work, a further eight navvy novels, and her lively reports on the mission in <span class="italic">Our Navvies</span>, <span class="italic">Women's Mission</span>, and the <span class="italic">Quarterly Letter to the Navvies</span>, which she edited from 1878 until 1917, Elizabeth Garnett was the spirit of the union from Evans's premature death in 1878 until her own in 1921.<br>
<br>While Garnett held no official role within the union save that of a lady section head, her zeal brought much support to it. Commencing with a membership of thirty-seven, including seven navvies, in 1877, the union boasted a total of 700 supporters by 1917. Of course its first aim was that of evangelizing the navvies and their families. This was accomplished not just through the provision of some thirty-nine mission rooms and missionaries, these often being navvies who had come to faith through the union, but in the day and night schools and libraries which the union established in these isolated settlements. It also introduced various welfare measures such as sick clubs and savings banks, while harsh winters prompted it to provide soup kitchens, first for navvy children, then for the families, and, during one outbreak of smallpox, a hospital and attendant nurse. Few navvies may have become Christians through all this work, but the union did make a significant improvement in navvies' working and living conditions and in their moral outlook.<br>
<br>It was in the union's subsidiary but highly necessary role of gaining publicity and support for its work that Garnett proved most successful. Through her writings she gained a huge audience, some 155,000 copies of the <span class="italic">Letter</span> being distributed during every quarter of 1904 when the publication was at its height. More significantly, her readers gained a sympathy for the navvies, and a &#145;strong-jawed and strong-willed little woman&#146;  (Sullivan, 204) accused of possessing a &#145;mingy sanctity&#146; by Sullivan found a great deal of love among &#145;her navvy family&#146;. Garnett died at 6 Canning Road, Croydon, Surrey, on 22 March 1921. A memorial was erected in her honour in Ripon Cathedral in 1926.<br>
