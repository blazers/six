<span class="headword">McFarlane,  (Kenneth) Bruce</span>  (1903&#150;1966), <span class="occ">historian</span>, was born on 18 October 1903 at 191 Amesbury Avenue, Streatham, London, the only child of Andrew McFarlane OBE, a civil servant in the Admiralty, and his first wife, Elizabeth Annie Stancombe. His mother died after a long illness while he was still a schoolboy, and his father remarried. After education at local preparatory schools and Dulwich College (1917&#150;22) he won a scholarship to Exeter College, Oxford, which he entered in Michaelmas term 1922. He won the Stanhope historical essay prize in 1924, obtained a first class in modern history in 1925, and was elected to a senior demyship at Magdalen College in 1926. He became a fellow by examination in 1927 and a tutorial fellow in 1928, and remained at the college until his death in 1966. His chosen field of research was England in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, a period which William Stubbs had seen as constitutionally retrograde, with parliament's precocious development stifled by factional politics. More recently T. F. Tout had argued that the crown and the magnates were locked in a struggle for the control of government through the administrative offices of exchequer, chancery, and household. Tout's work extended no further than 1399, and the fifteenth century remained <i>terra incognita</i>.<br>
<br>McFarlane's initial impulse was to carry forward the study of the institutions of government, the council, and the exchequer with a thesis on Cardinal Beaufort. But he rejected both Stubbs's whig constitutionalism and Tout's belief in the opposition of crown and magnates. Adopting a Marxist approach he at first interpreted the period as the clash of a new moneyed and mercantile class with the old feudal order. He soon saw this to be too crude a formulation, for what impressed him was the survival, adaptability, and inclusiveness of the ruling class throughout English history. It was this that gave direction and coherence to the evolution of the English state. Having arrived at this position he set himself to investigate all aspects of this &eacute;lite in his chosen period: its members and families; their lands and finances; their consumption and culture; their education and beliefs; and their service in war and politics. In this last he was much influenced by L. B. Namier's recent study of eighteenth-century English politics in terms of patronage and &#145;interests&#146;. He could see a similar structure in the political society of the later middle ages, and this he delineated in two brilliant and seminal articles, &#145;Bastard feudalism&#146; (1945) and &#145;Parliament and bastard feudalism&#146; (1944), reprinted among his collected essays in <span class="italic">England in the Fifteenth Century</span> (1981). These introduced historians to a world of magnate retinues and affinities; service and patronage; indentures, annuities, and &#145;good lordship&#146;; of shamelessly competitive ambition and floating loyalties. He thereby not only changed historians' views on the period but set a new direction for future research.<br>
<br>McFarlane now intensified his own investigations into the archives of the medieval aristocracy, some of them in the public records but many still remaining in stately homes (like Longleat) or on deposit in county record offices (as at Stafford and Lancaster). Hitherto none of this material had been explored, and all of it required laborious transcription before it could be interpreted and a synthesis made. A provisional exposition of his findings was presented in the Ford lectures at Oxford in 1953, a landmark in the historical study of the period. These gave a portrait of the late medieval nobility both as individuals of varying temperaments and abilities and as a class with a mentality fashioned by war and chivalric convention, financial acumen, dynastic pride, and political service. But he saw the lectures as provisional, refusing to publish them and continuing to accumulate evidence for a deeper synthesis. The text of 1953, with subsequent additions, was published posthumously as <span class="italic">The Nobility of Later Medieval England</span> (1973) and his transcriptions from the archives, comparable in value to those of Dodsworth and Dugdale, were deposited in Magdalen College.<br>
<br>McFarlane's short study <span class="italic">John Wycliffe and the Beginnings of English Nonconformity</span> (1952) was written, at the invitation of A. L. Rowse, for a wider audience. Though incredulous and dismissive about Wycliffe's beliefs McFarlane found the conflict between authority and heresy a valuable key to the mentality and power of the establishment; and in similar terms he went on to investigate how Wycliffite ideas penetrated the inner circles of the court of Richard II. The recovery of the covert beliefs of a group of chamber knights, a skilled piece of historical detective work, was posthumously published in <span class="italic">Lancastrian King and Lollard Knights</span> (1972). He returned to political history with the delivery of the Raleigh lecture at the British Academy (to which he had been elected in 1964) on the Wars of the Roses, a masterly analysis of the causes and nature of the collapse of political society. Alongside this historical research he had been led to re-examine the canon of Memling's paintings, prompted by perceiving the inaccurate dating of the &#145;Donne triptych&#146;, on exhibition in 1948. This occupied him intermittently over many years, leading him into an intensive study of the iconographical elements in Memling's paintings and the inspection of most of those in European galleries. His conclusions were published posthumously in a distilled form by Edgar Wind in <span class="italic">Hans Memling</span> (1971).<br>
<br>McFarlane preferred to write lectures and papers rather than books. Some were of seminal importance and all touched major problems and raised new lines of enquiry. Everything he wrote had the stamp of authority, based as it was on first-hand investigation and an instinctive distrust of received opinion. Nor did he conceal the provisional nature of some of his conclusions. His intellectual integrity and historical craftsmanship inspired the generation whose research he supervised, and their lineal successors, so that the study of late medieval England became part of the curriculum in most British universities. Partly because of his shyness and inner melancholy, and partly because of his charismatic personality, the pupils to whom he tentatively offered friendship became lifelong intimates. A volume of his letters to some of these  (<span class="italic">Letters to Friends, 1940&#150;1966</span>, ed. G. L. Harriss, 1999) reveals something of the inner man and much about his daily preoccupations and diversions. They show him as widely read, with a sharp visual sense, an intense interest in people, and a belief in the pre-eminent importance of human relationships. He had a long-standing association with <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/31859/', "Dr Helena Wright")</script>, to whom he often turned for advice.<br>
<br>McFarlane never married. He died, of a stroke, while walking at Great Hampden in Buckinghamshire on 16 July 1966 and was cremated at Oxford. He had no religious beliefs and had given instructions that no memorial service was to be held.<br>
