<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Jenkins,  Roy Harris</span>, Baron Jenkins of Hillhead  (1920&#150;2003), <span class="occ">politician and author</span>, was born at Greenlands, Snatchwood Road, Abersychan, Monmouthshire, on 11 November 1920, the only child of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/75629/', "Arthur Jenkins (1882&#150;1946)")</script>, assistant miners' agent, and his wife, Harriet (Hattie), <i>n&eacute;e</i> Harris (1886&#150;1953), music shop assistant and subsequently magistrate and county councillor.<h2>
<a name="Familyandeducation"></a>Family and education</h2>In his old age Jenkins, with characteristic detachment, described his mother as &#145;a little plump but no more&#146;  (Jenkins, <span class="italic">A Life at the Centre</span>, 8), and there was no doubt which of his two parents had the greater influence upon him. The young Jenkins worshipped his father, an unusually cultivated man who&#151;despite going to prison at the time of the general strike in 1926&#151;went on to be MP for Pontypool (1935&#150;46), parliamentary private secretary to the leader of the Labour Party, and finally a junior minister in the post-war Attlee government.<br>
<br>Typical of Jenkins's mother's desire for middle-class respectability was the fact that news of his father's sentence of imprisonment for nine months (of which he served only three) on charges of riotous assault and incitement to riot was carefully kept from Roy until he was in his mid-teens. Other Welsh mining valley families of the time might well have taken pride in such an example of political martyrdom but that had never been Hattie Jenkins's way. She merely informed her son that his father had gone on &#145;an extended tour of inspection of the coalmines of Germany&#146;  (<span class="italic">A Life at the Centre</span>, 17) and the young Jenkins knew no better until he eventually learned the truth from contemporaries at school. It was not so much that his parents were ashamed of what had occurred; rather was it that neither of them wanted their son&#151;the apple of their eyes who had been born after nine years of marriage, a number of miscarriages, and one stillbirth&#151;to grow up an embittered class warrior.<br>
<br>All the evidence suggests that Jenkins enjoyed a happy childhood. As a fully fledged miners' agent employed from 1921 by the South Wales Miners' Federation his father held an assured place in the community, something tacitly acknowledged when in November 1935 he succeeded a local former steelworker as Labour MP for his native constituency. Arthur Jenkins's election to parliament for Pontypool at the age of fifty-three may have come too late for him to have any realistic prospect of a dazzling political career. But as an alumnus of Ruskin College, Oxford, to which trade union seminary he had won a mature scholarship in 1908, and as in addition someone who had spent time in Paris (where he acquired a French accent that was always to elude his son), he soon made sufficient impression at Westminster to be invited by the leader of his party, Clement Attlee, to become his parliamentary private secretary and join him working in his private office. It was the foundation of a bond between the two families that was to survive even Arthur Jenkins's death in 1946.<br>
<br>But if his father's removal from home necessarily had its downside for the young Jenkins&#151;Arthur Jenkins followed the usual practice among Labour MPs of the time of spending three or four nights a week at a modest hotel in London and only coming back to the constituency at weekends&#151;it also had its compensations. The necessary abandonment of the post of miners' agent meant that the family had to move house, and their new rented home in Pontypool proved far more spacious, having no fewer than twelve rooms, to say nothing of half an acre of garden. The new MP and his wife frequently invited visiting politicians to stay&#151;and it was thus at this early stage of his life that the young Jenkins first met such Labour luminaries as Attlee himself, his deputy Herbert Morrison, the future chancellor Hugh Dalton, and Arthur's own boss later at the Ministry of Education, Ellen Wilkinson. Insofar as a member of &#145;the people's party&#146; can be born to the purple, Roy Jenkins could plausibly claim that something very like it had happened to him. It remained, however, a measure of the wry amusement he brought to the cult of celebrity that he always afterwards maintained that the figure who had easily the greatest impact upon him was not any distinguished member of the opposition front bench but rather a wandering Workers' Educational Association lecturer recently banished from Oxford and just beginning to be known&#151;at least to <span class="italic">New Statesman</span> readers&#151;under the byline of R. H. S. Crossman  (<span class="italic">A Life at the Centre</span>, 23).<br>
<br>By 1937 the young Jenkins's eyes began to turn to Oxford. Curiously his father had sent him not to the best school in the area&#151;West Monmouth School in Pontypool&#151;but rather to the Abersychan county school, perhaps on the ground that it was nearer the family's original Abersychan home. The young Jenkins had done reasonably well at Pentuin primary school but at Abersychan county school any academic promise tended rather to fall away. On his own admission his higher school certificate results were &#145;undistinguished&#146;  (<span class="italic">A Life at the Centre</span>, 24).<br>
<br>Possibly as a result, his father came under some pressure from a friend who was a schools inspector to move him to a private boarding school; but, luckily for Jenkins's political prospects, this plan withered on the vine and instead the seventeen-year-old found himself going daily by bus to attend University College, Cardiff. Some hostile comment was caused many years later by his failure to include any reference to this educational interlude in his <span class="italic">Who's Who</span> entry&#151;but the truth seems to have been that he always saw it in the light of an &#145;interlude&#146; and as a mere six-month preparation for tuition at Oxford, and it did not seem to him to merit a mention of its own.<br>
<br>Ever since his own brief days at Ruskin College before the First World War Arthur Jenkins had been determined that any son of his would go to Oxford and attend the university proper. But this meant a considerable financial sacrifice. An MP then earned only &pound;600 a year and, although Jenkins's father received an additional &pound;90 per annum from the mineworkers' union, putting a child through university clearly represented a strain on such slender resources. (The young Jenkins had sat the Balliol College scholarship exam in March 1938 but had not won any award.) It was nevertheless to Balliol, as a commoner and at his father's expense, that he went in October 1938, soon finding himself in the thick of the Oxford &#145;Munich&#146; by-election of that month&#151;in which the master of his college, A. D. Lindsay, stood as an &#145;Independent Progressive&#146; critic of the Munich agreement, only to be defeated by the Neville Chamberlain loyalist and Conservative candidate, Quintin Hogg.<br>
<br>Balliol at that time was very much at the political hub of the university, and the young grammar school boy from south Wales was fortunate in the wide range of future parliamentarians assembled among his contemporaries. Remarkably, within a single college the list included the future Conservative prime minister Edward Heath, the high tory Hugh Fraser, who sat opposite Jenkins in the Commons for almost thirty years, and Julian Amery, who served as minister of aviation immediately preceding Jenkins&#151;to say nothing of future Commons Labour colleagues such as Denis Healey and David Ginsburg. His own closest political ally and personal friend was, however, drawn from the college next door&#151;Trinity&#151;to which Anthony (Tony) Crosland had gone the year before Jenkins arrived at Balliol. Together they fought battles both in the Oxford Union and within the University Labour Club, which latter they were responsible for splitting by jointly founding the Oxford University Democratic Socialist Club in the spring of 1940. With the old Labour Club full of hard-line communists (of whom Healey at the time was one) the new organization prospered, soon attracting 400 members and electing Jenkins as its chairman in succession to Crosland at the end of 1940. In the Oxford Union, though, he had less luck, failing to become its president by a mere five votes in June 1940, and being defeated rather more emphatically at his second attempt in November 1940. Even fifteen years later, when dining with a group of Labour Club undergraduates, he would recall these twin defeats as &#145;the two greatest disappointments of my Oxford career&#146;.<br>
<br>That career had, however, its compensations&#151;not least the first-class degree in philosophy, politics, and economics that he attained in the summer of 1941. (He took justifiable pride, too, in his presidency of the Balliol junior common room, to which he was elected for a year in December 1940.) But, once 1941 had opened, it was towards the achievement of his first in &#145;schools&#146; that most of his efforts were bent. As he recalled many years later, &#145;It was obvious that my only hope of doing well was to change my habits completely &hellip; I accordingly started to work eight hours a day, seven days a week and kept up this average for the next eighty days&#146;  (<span class="italic">A Life at the Centre</span>, 43). It was a valiant effort and it secured the desired result. In July 1941 Jenkins discovered that he had won one of just four firsts in philosophy, politics, and economics awarded that year&#151;and the fact that his own success had been managed only after a forty-minute viva strongly suggested, as he always had the grace to admit, that his was very much a borderline case. (He was also fond of recalling that his economics tutor at Balliol, Thomas Balogh, later as a peer a ministerial colleague in the final Wilson government, was so taken aback when the results came out that he had to pour himself a stiff whisky in order to cope with the shock.)<br>
<br>How much difference did getting to Oxford make to Jenkins's life? The obvious answer is that it was decisive&#151;it was, after all, a Balliol don who famously spoke of him as &#145;one of nature's Old Etonians&#146;. Certainly, all trace of Welsh inflection or intonation (with rare exceptions such as his continued enunciation of the word &#145;situation&#146;, which invariably came out as something like &#145;<i>sidooazhun</i>&#146;) miraculously disappeared from his speech once he became an Oxonian, leaving his voice with only one distinctive characteristic: his inability to pronounce the letter <i>r</i> (which always emerged as <i>w</i>).<h2>
<a name="Marriagewarserviceandbeginningsinpolitics"></a>Marriage, war service, and beginnings in politics</h2>There were other things, too, that Oxford did not change. If Jenkins arrived at Balliol in the autumn of 1938 as almost a tribal Labour supporter, he departed from it in the summer of 1941 in exactly the same unreconstructed political state. But by then his personality had certainly blossomed&#151;not least through his encountering at a Fabian summer school held at Dartington Hall in Devon in August 1940 his future wife, (Mary) Jennifer Morris (<i>b</i>. 1921), the daughter of the renowned town clerk of Westminster, Sir (George) Parker Morris. The attraction, despite some attempted competition from Tony Crosland, appears to have been mutual and immediate. Although they had never encountered one another before, the two of them left Dartington Hall together at the end of the summer school and, through all the demands and exigencies of war, managed to keep in regular touch before being married towards the end of the war at the Savoy Chapel in London on 20 January 1945 (with Clement Attlee as a witness).<br>
<br>Although interesting and fulfilling enough, Jenkins's Second World War service was hardly heroic. Commissioned in the summer of 1942 into the West Somerset yeomanry&#151;which, together with the Leicestershire yeomanry, supplied artillery support for the guards armoured division&#151;he served as a lieutenant with a domestic battery for a little under two years before being summoned at War Office direction to join the code-breakers working at Bletchley Park. (The responsibility for this change of activity seems to have lain with A. D. Lindsay, the master of Balliol, who prided himself on his capacity to get Balliol men into military jobs that suited their talents.) But not being a mathematician, or even a dedicated crossword-solver, the 23-year-old Jenkins lacked the obvious talents attached to his more cerebral colleagues working at Bletchley, something that at first tended to intimidate him. Nevertheless, with the exception of one period in the autumn of 1944 when, as he put it, he &#145;went seriously off form for several weeks&#146;  (<span class="italic">A Life at the Centre</span>, 53), he acquitted himself well, more than justifying the faith placed in his mental ingenuity by his former college head.<br>
<br>Yet Jenkins never allowed codes, or the keys to them, totally to dominate his mind. He kept up his general reading and maintained his keen interest in politics, attending at least two annual conferences of the Labour Party, held at Methodist Central Hall, Westminster, during the war. The son of a Labour MP who had come to his true vocation only relatively late in life, Jenkins made up his mind while still in his twenties that a politician was what he would like to be. By the last part of the war he was already actively seeking a parliamentary seat&#151;and the best prospect looked like the Aston division of Birmingham, which had already been won for Labour by John Strachey in 1929, only to revert to the Conservatives in both 1931 and 1935.<br>
<br>In the event the youthful Captain Jenkins lost at the selection conference to Major Woodrow Wyatt, two years his senior&#151;supposedly, according to his successful rival, because, when offered accommodation overnight by the constituency secretary, he had responded that while the invitation was very kind he preferred on balance to stay in a hotel. This, Wyatt implied in his mid-term autobiography, <span class="italic">Confessions of an Optimist</span> (1985), had made his opponent sound somewhat less than a man of the people, though the truth was both more complex and more compromising. The one thing that his shyness prevented Jenkins from explaining was that his fianc&eacute;e, as Jennifer Morris had now become, planned to spend the night with him in Birmingham and that in those circumstances it seemed tactful to enjoy the anonymity of a hotel rather than risk embarrassing the <i>en famille</i> ambience of a party member's home. Disappointed again in at least one other Birmingham seat&#151;Leo Amery's Sparkbrook constituency, which went to a local Labour alderman who proceeded comfortably to win it at the general election&#151;the young parliamentary aspirant was still not prepared to give up, eventually agreeing to fight the safe tory seat of Solihull on the outskirts of Birmingham, where he found himself facing a Conservative majority of 34,649.<br>
<br>It amused Jenkins in his later years to comment that at his first election in 1945 he &#145;achieved the not inconsiderable feat of standing for Labour and still failing to win&#146;  (private information). But that was a grossly unfair piece of self-mockery: even in the annus mirabilis for Labour of 1945 there was no way that solid suburban seats like Solihull would forsake their traditional tory allegiance. Jenkins had done remarkably well to cut the Conservative majority in the way that he had&#151;he got it down to barely more than 5000. It was a thoroughly creditable result and one that had the useful effect of reinforcing the high opinion that the party's regional office already held of him. Yet it still meant that the young soldier&#151;allowed leave to fight the election but not formally released from the army until January 1946&#151;would have to find a job once he returned to civilian life.<br>
<br>That problem, though, was soon solved for him. One of the earliest decisions of the just elected Labour government had been to set up a body somewhat portentously called the Industrial and Commercial Finance Corporation (ICFC), established to make it easier for small- to medium-sized businesses to raise long-term capital. The ICFC's chairman was the then freshly ennobled Labour peer William Piercy whom the young Jenkins had got to know when this former lecturer at the London School of Economics worked alongside his father in Attlee's private office during the war. The invitation thus duly came for the about-to-be-demobbed Captain Jenkins to take on the role of an apprentice amateur merchant banker in the public sector&#151;and not least because it afforded the opportunity of a priority release from the forces it was accepted with alacrity.<br>
<br>Jenkins himself always afterwards maintained that he was not really cut out to be a merchant banker. His one triumph at the ICFC was to arrange for the grant of a loan of &pound;163,000 to Charles Forte, a significant step along the road to fame and fortune for Forte who, then a mere milk-bar owner, went on to become one of the most successful hoteliers and restaurateurs in Britain. Yet the melancholy truth was that the majority of his work bored the young, aspiring politician who, whether prudently or not, found it hard to disguise from his colleagues his impatience to join other junior Labour lions, such as Harold Wilson and James Callaghan, in the House of Commons.<br>
<br>Jenkins's first chance to do so surfaced in distinctly sad circumstances. In April 1946 Arthur Jenkins, always the hero and mentor to his son in his growing years, died. He was only sixty-four but his hard work as Attlee's parliamentary private secretary, starting in 1937, had plainly exhausted him. He was already suffering from a neglected prostate condition when, after he had served for a few weeks as under-secretary at the Ministry of Town and Country Planning during the last phase of Churchill's wartime coalition, Attlee chose him to join Ellen Wilkinson at the Ministry of Education in August 1945. According to his own account, the 25-year-old Jenkins was &#145;shattered by his death&#146;  (<span class="italic">A Life at the Centre</span>, 66).<br>
<br>The vacancy his father's loss created in the Commons inevitably posed the question as to whether Jenkins, defeated at Solihull only nine months previously, should apply to fill it. Perhaps rashly, and very much at the urging of his strong-minded mother, he decided to do so, only to find himself vanquished at the final hurdle. In the run-off ballot at an adjourned selection conference&#151;there had been some voting paper irregularities on the first day&#151;the son of the former member gained seventy-six votes against the 134 won by his equally local rival (a solicitor practising in the town's courts). At the time it was clearly a massive disappointment, in no way mitigated by his mother's regarding it also as a personal insult, but in retrospect Jenkins came to see it as something more akin to a deliverance. Had he been chosen to succeed his father while not yet even twenty-six not only would he have been constantly compared to him; even more dangerously, with the example of Arthur Jenkins in mind, he would have found it very hard to avoid being categorized as primarily a Welsh politician who happened to go up to London once a week in order to vote in the Commons.<br>
<br>Not all mercies are, however, immediately perceived as such&#151;and the depth of the young Jenkins's disappointment was perhaps best reflected in the restiveness that immediately began to affect his professional life, still necessarily outside parliament. In the months following the Pontypool debacle he continued working at the ICFC but did not seem able to stop himself from feeling increasingly unsettled. He applied for academic jobs (both at Oxford and at Manchester), put in an application to become a BBC talks producer, and even thought about reading for the bar&#151;something he had originally planned to do on leaving Oxford and probably would have done but for the war. If the string tying him to politics survived at all, it was largely thanks to his father's old boss, Clem Attlee&#151;who, as prime minister, not only arranged for the son of his former faithful parliamentary private secretary to edit his speeches but also (much more surprisingly in so modest a man) authorized him to write the first official biography to be published of him. The result, <span class="italic">Mr Attlee: an Interim Biography</span>, did not come out until 1948 and, apart from representing its author's d&eacute;but in this particular literary form, has little to commend it (although Jenkins himself remained strangely proud of it to the end of his life and especially of having written it, mainly at odd moments, within the space of a calendar year). Having published it, he did, though, candidly admit that he would never again attempt a &#145;living&#146; subject, a rule he adhered to in the course of the seven subsequent political biographies that he produced.<h2>
<a name="MPforSouthwarkCentral"></a>MP for Southwark Central</h2>By the time his first biography was published Jenkins was in fact already within striking distance of achieving his primary ambition of becoming a member of parliament. In March 1948 John Martin, the somewhat obscure Labour MP for Southwark Central, announced that ill health left him with no option but to retire&#151;he nevertheless managed to live for another thirty-five years&#151;and, proof perhaps that his loyalist book had done him no harm, the prime minister's young biographer found himself encouraged by party officials to apply for the vacancy. It was not, to be blunt, a particularly attractive opening: the constituency was due to be amalgamated with its neighbour, Southwark East, in time for the next general election&#151;and the sitting member for the latter constituency had already secured the agreement of officials of the London Labour Party that whoever gained the nomination for Southwark Central would not be allowed to enter the lists for the new combined seat of Southwark at the expected 1950 general election.<br>
<br>The competition for, at best, a two-year ticket of admission to the House of Commons, therefore, was not strong, and at the selection conference held on 23 March 1948 the now 27-year-old Jenkins found himself facing a single opponent, a local Southwark alderman who, as Jenkins pithily put it in his memoirs, &#145;had some friends but more enemies&#146;  (<span class="italic">A Life at the Centre</span>, 71). Whether because of that or not, he was fortunate enough to sail through, gaining the support of twenty of the twenty-eight delegates present (the contrast in numbers providing striking evidence of the relative strengths of Labour membership in inner city seats such as Southwark Central as compared with the party's then industrial fortresses like Pontypool in south Wales). At least his slightly &#145;rotten borough&#146; success at Southwark meant that the youthful potential politician had achieved his life's ambition, and in fairly creditable circumstances (becoming &#145;baby&#146; of the house when he arrived there on 4 May 1948, and retaining that position until another by-election victor, the future Conservative minister Sir Edward Boyle, was elected for Birmingham, Handsworth, in November 1950).<br>
<br>At Westminster, despite all the struggle and anxiety to get there, Jenkins, like most new MPs, failed to make any immediate impact. It cannot have helped, at least with his colleagues, that he was inevitably regarded very much as the prime minister's prot&eacute;g&eacute;&#151;an impression Attlee did little to dispel by, highly unusually for a head of government, acting as one of the new member's two sponsors on the afternoon he was introduced into the chamber. Subsequently Jenkins was at pains to insist that his real heroes in that first post-war Labour government had been Stafford Cripps and Aneurin Bevan, but at the time he was close to neither of them in the same way that he and his family were to Attlee. The prime minister even became godfather to Jenkins's first son, Charles, when he was born in March 1949, Jennifer's pregnancy providing the cue for the new MP and his wife to move&#151;inconveniently, as it turned out&#151;away from their small flat above a snack bar in Marsham Street, Westminster, to a much larger two-floor apartment at the top of a Victorian mansion in Cornwall Gardens, Kensington.<br>
<br>It may well be that in those early years the not yet thirty-year-old Jenkins, who already possessed a strong competitive streak, fell victim to his own anxieties. His decision to go for the doomed Southwark Central seat meant after all that he had secured himself only a temporary pass into the Commons, not any form of season ticket. This worry appears for a period to have preyed upon his mind. Certainly it was at this time that he took himself off to see a psychiatrist, who pronounced that while he took the young politician's anxieties seriously he saw no reason why he should not survive for a normal lifespan provided he was content to lead a quiet life and spared himself any unnecessary psychological strain or nervous pressure. It was perhaps typical of the amused candour with which he tended to regard his various vicissitudes that Jenkins himself should have gone out of his way to record this faintly bizarre advice in the autobiography that he wrote some forty years later.<br>
<br>In fact, the anxiety about the immediate future apart, the young politician&#151;having at last entered the promised land&#151;found his new life thoroughly agreeable. Within a few months of being elected an MP he had been invited by Philip Noel-Baker, the secretary of state for Commonwealth relations, to become his parliamentary private secretary&#151;an offer he eagerly accepted not so much on the ground that he had any special interest in the area of policy covered by that particular cabinet department but rather because, as he put it frankly, &#145;I was keen to have a foot even on the lowest rung of the ladder of office&#146;  (<span class="italic">A Life at the Centre</span>, 76). He did not, though, manage to maintain that foothold for long. When, in February 1950, Noel-Baker was shunted out of the cabinet to become minister of fuel and power, the demoted former secretary of state prudently resolved that in his new domestic role he would need to have a miners' MP as his parliamentary private secretary and consequently asked Jenkins to step down. Having attained his objective of getting some inkling of how a government department worked, the youthful MP for Southwark Central appears to have agreed to do so without rancour or regret (and maybe even with a measure of relief). When, a month or two later, the minister of supply, George Strauss, asked Jenkins to take up a similar position with him, the invitation to serve as a dogsbody for the second time round was politely declined.<br>
<br>Another explanation could have been that the young political apprentice&#151;however ambitious&#151;already had a second string to his bow, and one that increasingly was taking up a good deal of his time and attention. Once <span class="italic">Mr Attlee: an Interim Biography</span> had been published in the spring of 1948, Jenkins had almost immediately started work on a more ambitious project that, under the title of <span class="italic">Mr Balfour's Poodle</span>, aimed to tell the story of the legendary struggle between H. H. Asquith's Liberal government and the House of Lords over David Lloyd George's &#145;people's budget&#146; of 1909 (it was, in fact, a phrase of Lloyd George's that provided the title for Jenkins's second work). The book did not come out until February 1954 but that was partly because its author had taken up more contemporary political themes in the meantime. In 1951&#151;demonstrating, incidentally, that his moorings were not exclusively on the right wing of the Labour Party&#151;Jenkins produced a 7000 word <span class="italic">Tribune</span> pamphlet advocating a programme of stringent taxation of capital (to which Michael Foot, <span class="italic">Tribune</span>'s editor, gave the ironic title <span class="italic">Fair Shares for the Rich</span>). A few months later Jenkins followed that initiative up with a more considered article, &#145;Equality&#146;, in the 1952 volume of <span class="italic">New Fabian Essays</span>, and a year after that produced a frankly propagandist work entitled <span class="italic">Pursuit of Progress</span>, in which he sought to reconcile the spirit of impatient utopianism within the Labour Party with the rival ethos of practical reformism. If it scarcely ranks as one of Jenkins's more solid works, it at least demonstrated that even when his head began to turn towards the right the romantic left still operated a sufficient hold upon his heart for him not to want to provoke any unnecessary conflict between the two.<h2>
<a name="MPforStechford"></a>MP for Stechford</h2>When, if only at the eleventh hour&#151;in October 1949, just four months before the February 1950 general election&#151;Jenkins secured his parliamentary future by obtaining the Labour nomination in the newly constituted seat of Stechford in his old stamping ground of Birmingham&#151;he continued to maintain a surprisingly independent position in the internal politics of the Parliamentary Labour Party (PLP). This was partly because he found the company of left-wingers much more invigorating than that of their more stolid right-wing colleagues. For a time at the beginning of the 1950s he even formed part of a canasta school, meeting illicitly in the vaults of the Palace of Westminster, where his card-playing companions included such future prominent followers of Aneurin Bevan as John Freeman, Tom Driberg, and Hugh Delargy. It was only Bevan's dramatic resignation from the second Attlee government in April 1951 that persuaded Jenkins that he would have to decide on which side of the great divide he stood&#151;and even then he took his time, waiting for Bevan's increasingly strident attacks on Gaitskell, who had succeeded Stafford Cripps as chancellor in October 1950, before formally identifying himself with the Gaitskellite cause. But the conversion when it came was complete&#151;although, as he admitted in his memoirs, he was full of envy for those few Labour MPs who managed to maintain convivial relations with Bevan while disagreeing with his politics profoundly.<br>
<br>The unequivocal stand that Jenkins took from the early days of the Bevanite revolt required some courage. In most of the party's great disputes of the time, such as the running battle over German rearmament, he found himself at odds with his new constituency party, even if the leading figures in Stechford showed sufficient forbearance never to press their disagreements with their MP to the point of divorce. This restraint was all the more creditable since Jenkins, although he was to hold the seat for twenty-six years, hardly enjoyed the reputation of being a notably conscientious MP. More a once-a-month than a once-a-week visitor, he maintained no home in the constituency, preferring to stay with two party activists (suggesting perhaps that he had learned something from his early experience at Aston) and, although always energetic enough at election times (including those for Birmingham city council), somehow consistently contrived to wear his responsibilities as the senior Labour member for Birmingham, as he ultimately became, pretty lightly. Perhaps unfairly, one of his younger former colleagues in parliament later recalled how, as the train on which they were both travelling drew out of New Street station, he once remarked with unmistakable feeling: &#145;Don't you always feel an enormous sense of relief when you leave this place?&#146;  (A. Watkins, <span class="italic">Brief Lives</span>, 1982, 75); the MP, though unnamed, was Brian Walden.<br>
<br>The truth, of course, was that in sharp contrast to his father Jenkins did not take long to establish himself as a predominantly metropolitan figure. The job he took to supplement his parliamentary salary (from 1946 to 1954 only &pound;1000 per annum) was as a consultant to the John Lewis Partnership, which meant spending one to one-and-a-half days a week in the company's headquarters above its Oxford Street store. (Jenkins was to remain a John Lewis adviser for longer than any other post he ever held, apart from the chancellorship of Oxford University, being associated with the partnership, latterly as director of financial operations, for eleven years until he joined the Wilson government in October 1964.)<br>
<br>Necessarily, especially after the death in 1953 of his mother, who never moved away from Pontypool, Jenkins's interests became focused more and more upon London. The births of a daughter, Cynthia, in 1951 and a second son, Edward, in 1954 persuaded both Jenkins and his wife to leave Cornwall Gardens and buy a substantial house on the south side of Ladbroke Square, just down the hill from Notting Hill Gate. Encouraged by the faded grandeur of their new surroundings (which included access to one of the largest communal gardens in London, complete with a tennis court) the young and always gregarious politician embarked on a fairly extensive programme of entertaining, with the new Labour Party leader, Hugh Gaitskell, and his wife, Dora, being among the most frequent guests. Politically Jenkins was now firmly marked down as a Gaitskellite and&#151;although he rather competed with his old friend Tony Crosland for the position of court favourite&#151;his enjoyment of the approval of the new management that took over the Labour Party from Attlee in 1955 was never in any doubt.<br>
<br>Paradoxically, however, this did Jenkins's career prospects little good. Gaitskell, rather like President John F. Kennedy, always liked to separate his genuine friends from his working colleagues, and Jenkins, who had to wait until November 1959 even to be appointed to a junior role on the opposition front bench (he resigned from being part of the Treasury team only seven months later), proved no exception to that rule. As he ruefully commented, throughout most of the years of the Gaitskell leadership &#145;my position in the political hierarchy hardly advanced at all&#146;  (A. Watkins, &#145;Backbencher&#146;, <span class="italic">Jenkins</span>, ed. Adonis and Thomas, 47). But for that he was at least partly to blame. Politics is a jealous taskmistress and colleagues tend to look askance if they detect a member of their own fraternity dispersing his energies too widely. During the 1950s Jenkins would certainly have had to plead guilty to that charge. In addition to his responsibilities at the John Lewis Partnership he produced a highly praised and commercially successful follow-up to <span class="italic">Mr Balfour's Poodle</span> in <span class="italic">Sir Charkes Dilke: a Victorian Tragedy</span> in 1959 and started writing his classic <span class="italic">Asquith</span> (which came out in 1964) in the same year. As if that were not enough, he had taken naturally to the life of higher journalism, writing regularly for Ian Gilmour's <span class="italic">Spectator</span> in 1957&#150;60 and contributing after that to David Astor's <span class="italic">Observer</span>, for which he wrote long, distinguished &#145;review fronts&#146; (including a notable one on the papal election of 1963), to say nothing of becoming one of the star book reviewers on that newspaper's then illustrious literary pages. Perhaps not surprisingly, the impression began to take root among his more serious-minded colleagues that he was, at best, a dilettante politician, either unwilling or unable to bring to the pursuit of his calling the exclusive dedication that it demanded of them.<br>
<br>If anything, that reputation was underlined by what he actually chose to do within the House of Commons. There also he contrived to appear as somehow a peripheral politician&#151;more interested, say, in piloting on behalf of the Society of Authors an <span class="roman">Obscene Publications Bill</span> (designed to curb censorship and increase literary freedom) through its various legislative stages than in taking part in the daily hurly-burly of inter-party combat. He did, though, some hard work each summer under Gaitskell's leadership on the committee stage of the <span class="roman">Finance Bill</span> and no one denied that he was both an eloquent and elegant Commons performer: what remained in doubt, since promotion and preferment had been denied to him, was the extent of his partisan commitment. Moreover, within the ranks of his own party, there were darker suspicions in play. When, for example, on the eve of the 1959 general election he wrote in <span class="italic">The Spectator</span>&#151;uncannily foreshadowing the formation of the Alliance in the early 1980s&#151;that &#145;on a whole range of foreign, colonial and libertarian issues the best and most dominant Liberals now see completely eye-to-eye with the Labour Party &hellip; the overwhelming need is to channel the anti-Tory vote into the most effective channels&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Spectator</span>, 25 Sept 1959), it must be doubted whether he was commending himself even to Hugh Gaitskell.<br>
<br>Yet his admiration for Gaitskell remained the most constant factor in Jenkins's political outlook&#151;even their eventual disagreement over the desirability of Britain entering the European Economic Community (EEC) only threatened and did not rupture their friendship, which remained for Jenkins the most important relationship he had in politics. It was this that made Gaitskell's death at the age of only fifty-six in January 1963 so devastating a blow. Jenkins was away at the time in the United States, writing a piece for <span class="italic">The Observer</span> looking back on the Cuban missile crisis of a year earlier, but, having stoutly defended Gaitskell against the leadership challenge made to him by Harold Wilson in 1960, his advice to the rump of forlorn Gaitskellites gathered in London was firm and unequivocal: they might all separately have their own ideas about who should be his successor&#151;for his part, he would certainly be voting for Gaitskell's deputy, George Brown&#151;but the one option not open to any of them was to support the man who had sought to be the dead leader's usurper. The second part of his advice was heeded by the other Gaitskellite MPs but the first was not: many of them felt such apprehension about electing the volatile deputy leader that they saw themselves as compelled to look elsewhere for a third candidate (who eventually materialized in the shape of the shadow chancellor, James Callaghan). Jenkins, though, was right to suspect that all Callaghan's intervention would achieve would be to prevent any momentum building up behind Brown as the only man capable of defeating Wilson within the PLP. On the first ballot Brown got only 88 votes to Wilson's 115 with Callaghan trailing the field on 41, while on the second, and decisive, run-off Wilson beat Brown by 144 votes to 103. There followed perhaps the bleakest period in Jenkins's political life.<br>
<br>Wilson certainly had little reason to do anything to help Jenkins, being only too aware (everything else apart) that there had in 1960 been a half-baked scheme on Gaitskell's part to evict Wilson from the shadow chancellorship and install Jenkins in his place. The plot, if that was what it was (Jenkins always claimed not even to know about it), did not work, and the following year Gaitskell was reduced to making Wilson shadow foreign secretary and appointing the relatively untried Callaghan to head the opposition Treasury team.<br>
<br>Yet in politics it is often the unexpected event that determines the future&#151;and so it proved in this case. To his genuine surprise, Jenkins found himself in July 1963 being sounded out as to whether he would be prepared to accept the position of being the next editor of <span class="italic">The Economist</span>. The approach came primarily from the editorial staff and it is not certain that it had been sanctioned by the paper's controlling company, the Financial Times. But it certainly had all the appearance of being a genuine invitation and it was in that spirit that a depressed Jenkins, by now thoroughly disillusioned with party politics, entertained it. He did not, though, rush his fences, telling both the chairman of <span class="italic">The Economist</span>, Geoffrey Crowther, and the intermediary who had first approached him, Norman Macrae, the paper's assistant editor, that he would like a month or so to reflect upon the offer.<br>
<br>That proved to be a prudent precaution for, on the advice of a long-standing friend, Marie-Alice de Beaumarchais (whom Jennifer and he were later to get to know even better as the wife of the French ambassador in London), Jenkins took the decision to place his dilemma before the party leader, Harold Wilson. There were to be many ups and downs in their relationship but it is possible to believe that the seeds of what eventually became a wary mutual respect were planted in this unusual confrontation between the two of them. Certainly, to Jenkins's surprise, Wilson reacted &#145;with immense consideration&#146;  (<span class="italic">A Life at the Centre</span>, 150) to what he was told, letting his erstwhile dedicated opponent know that he would quite understand if he accepted the <span class="italic">Economist</span> offer but at the same time insisting that he would &#145;deeply regret it&#146;  (ibid., 151). He also said with complete candour and some courage that, while he could not see there being an immediate place for Jenkins in any cabinet that he formed, there would certainly be a middle-rank job within such a government and that from there &#145;the road to promotion would be wide open&#146;  (ibid., 151).<br>
<br>By any judgement it was a generous response, and it had the effect of stopping Jenkins from abandoning the life of politics for that of political commentary. (It probably helped that <span class="italic">The Economist</span> was just the type of <i>bien pensant</i> publication for which Wilson tended to have an exaggerated respect.) But, even after his conversation with his party leader, Jenkins did not rejoin the opposition front bench&#151;which he had left just two years earlier while Gaitskell was still leader&#151;and the 1964 general election was the last one in which he found himself fighting as a purely local candidate defending his own constituency. In a straight fight with the Conservatives, as the contest had also been in 1959, he put up the Labour majority from 2923 to 5388 and, despite the narrowness of Labour's overall victory (in the Commons the new government had a majority of just four seats), drove back to London in a confidently expectant mood.<h2>
<a name="ThefirstandsecondWilsongovernments19641970"></a>The first and second Wilson governments, 1964&#150;1970</h2>At first, however, there was simply silence&#151;Wilson, understandably, was preoccupied with the choice of his first cabinet and he had already warned Jenkins that his name would not feature in it. Eventually the aspiring young minister learned of his destiny not from the prime minister but from his deputy, George Brown, who, in recognition perhaps of the way Jenkins had stood by him in the leadership election twenty-one months earlier, summoned him round to his flat near Marble Arch and told him that the next morning he would be offered the post of minister of aviation.<br>
<br>To Jenkins this was good news since it meant he would be in charge of his own department (if one outside the cabinet) and that he would not be directly subordinate to a senior minister. He was also shrewd enough to realize that his was a department in which a number of key decisions, such as over the future of the Concorde supersonic project, would need to be made and that he would come to such questions not entirely without background knowledge&#151;by good fortune, his last commission for <span class="italic">The Observer</span> only three months earlier had been to write a long article on the problems of the British aircraft industry (it was, indeed, this review front piece that had first placed in Wilson's mind the notion of appointing Jenkins to aviation).<br>
<br>Having been sworn of the privy council on 24 October 1964, three days after his ministerial appointment, Jenkins in no time began to emerge as a firm and determined minister who knew his own mind and did not shrink from taking tough decisions, even when they involved entering the kind of bilateral minefield that, under a formal treaty, governed the Anglo-French development of Concorde. The original plan, reached by incoming cabinet ministers in the new government, had been to cancel the project but, given the punitive nature of the penalty clauses involved, the freshly appointed aviation minister felt he had no choice but to fight a long-drawn-out delaying action which eventually granted the world's much-vaunted first supersonic airliner a reprieve. The subsequent sad history of Concorde, and in particular the failure to sell it to other airlines around the world, was not such as to suggest that this decision was indubitably right. But, after one bad, initial wobble in December 1964, in which he allowed himself to be quoted in <span class="italic">The Observer</span> as saying that the whole supersonic project was &#145;a dead duck&#146;, Jenkins, helped materially by at least two debating triumphs in the Commons, ensured both that the plane survived and that his own reputation flourished. There had consequently to be savings elsewhere&#151;the bulk of the cuts falling on the manufacture of military aircraft such as the P-1154, the HS-681, and even ultimately the TSR-2&#151;but that did not alter the fact that within a year the <i>ing&eacute;nu</i> minister of aviation had emerged as one of the most determined departmental warriors in Whitehall.<br>
<br>Jenkins had also demonstrated that he was a politician with the long view. When Patrick Gordon Walker, an old Gaitskellite whom Wilson had defiantly appointed as foreign secretary in the face of his defeat in his west midland constituency of Smethwick at the October 1964 general election, failed again to win a seat in parliament at a by-election at Leyton in January 1965, a cabinet reshuffle became inevitable. Jenkins had no reason to believe he would be involved in it until, on the morning after Gordon Walker's second defeat at the polls, he got a phone call. The chairman of the PLP, Emanuel Shinwell, merely wanted to pass on the intelligence that he had that morning been consulted by the prime minister as to who should be the next foreign secretary and that he had recommended Jenkins for the job. He, therefore, asked for an assurance that, if the post were offered, Jenkins would not refuse it&#151;an undertaking that, hardly surprisingly, was immediately forthcoming.<br>
<br>Fighting a losing battle with his initial disbelief, Jenkins was due that morning to attend a meeting of the overseas and defence committee of the cabinet at number 10. All seemed depressingly normal and, although the prime minister presided, he betrayed no sign of wanting to speak privately to the only non-cabinet member present. Jenkins thus returned to his own department no longer merely mystified but marginally mortified as well. Any mood of depression was, though, immediately banished by his private secretary announcing that number 10 had been on the phone and that the prime minister urgently needed to talk to him. As Jenkins wrote in his memoirs twenty-five years later: &#145;For the first time I took Shinwell's telephone call wholly seriously and ingested the thought, unbelievable though it seemed on any previous basis, that Wilson was going to make me Foreign Secretary&#146;  (<span class="italic">A Life at the Centre</span>, 168&#150;9).<br>
<br>It proved, of course, a false assumption. When Jenkins arrived at number 10 it was only to be asked to wait and then to learn casually from Jim Callaghan&#151;who happened to be passing as the aspiring successor to Curzon and Balfour was still loitering in the little hall outside the cabinet room&#151;that Michael Stewart, the minister of education, was already inside. That could mean only one thing: it was the reversion to Stewart's job at education, and not the foreign secretaryship, that was going to be offered to him. Of course, that was a disappointment but even the latter offer would mean immediate promotion to the cabinet&#151;with engaging honesty Jenkins was later to admit that, if at their eventual cabinet room interview later that morning, the prime minister had required an answer there and then, he would in all probability have said &#145;yes&#146;  (<span class="italic">A Life at the Centre</span>, 170). But Wilson never made that demand and Jenkins was therefore able to get away with a request for time to consider the matter over lunch&#151;something that Wilson a little grudgingly conceded, saying that he would need an answer by 2 p.m. Jenkins's instinctive reaction was revealing: it was to call home and ask his wife, Jennifer, to come from Ladbroke Square and join him for a sandwich lunch in his office. There she urged acceptance of the prime minister's invitation&#151;but the more Jenkins himself thought about it, the less inclined to make the suggested move he became. The clincher for him seems to have been projecting his mind forward to Monday morning, wondering how he would feel if he found himself walking up the steps of the Ministry of Education in Curzon Street rather than returning to his old office overlooking the Thames Embankment and concluding that he would feel &#145;more regret for Aviation than enthusiasm for Education&#146;  (ibid.).<br>
<br>In the prime minister's room in the House of Commons Jenkins therefore explained to Wilson why he was not disposed to make the suggested move, even though that was bound to mean staying outside the cabinet and seeing someone else enter it. When that &#145;someone else&#146; proved to be his own old friend Tony Crosland he could not stop himself from giving way to second thoughts. Yet he did not just harbour these: characteristically, he did something about them. The next day all the newspapers carried the announcement of Crosland's appointment to education but their information did not stop there. Almost without exception, they reported that the former economic secretary to the Treasury had been promoted only after Roy Jenkins, the two-years-younger minister of aviation, had turned the cabinet post down. It was a vivid illustration of just how strong the competitive element was in Jenkins's make-up&#151;for that information had not come from number 10 but rather from the new public relations adviser, John Harris, whom Jenkins had that weekend appointed to join the staff of his private office. (Harris had previously been serving the unfortunate Gordon Walker at the Foreign Office.)<br>
<br>In one sense that was not an episode from which Jenkins emerged with much credit, as he himself in later years was always the first to admit. But, viewed in the round, it could equally be said to illustrate one of his strengths as a politician: his acceptance that the long-distance runner always starts with something of an advantage over the sprinter in politics. That was certainly what this incident showed. For within fifteen months of being appointed to the Ministry of Aviation&#151;and less than a year after turning down the move to education&#151;the figure who had started out as just about the most irreconcilable of all the old Gaitskellites was installed in one of the great, historic offices of Whitehall, that of secretary of state for the Home Department.<br>
<br>This time it did not come about by mishap or chance. Discovering from a government colleague that Wilson took the view that the Home Office was not a job that Jenkins would ever want, the latter took his courage in his hands and went to see the prime minister in order to point out how profoundly mistaken and even ill informed he was. (A Penguin paperback that Jenkins had brought out just before the 1964 election, <span class="italic">The Labour Case</span>, had been substantially concerned with what in those days were known as &#145;Home Office issues&#146;.) Relieved to hear what his visitor told him, the prime minister let the unguarded words &#145;Well, that makes it all much easier&#146; slip from his lips, leading Jenkins to assume that he could confidently look forward to taking over from the already frail Sir Frank Soskice at the Home Office in fairly short order. But prime ministers do not like to be hurried and a few unhelpful &#145;leaks&#146; suggesting Jenkins already had the job in the bag ensured that it was not until just before Christmas that the biographer of Asquith took over responsibility for the department that his subject had once run.<br>
<br>Already there were those eager to draw comparisons between the two men's careers, and these were not always designed to be helpful. Nor was it at all the case that with his arrival as her majesty's &#145;principal secretary of state&#146; (as Rab Butler, relying on history, always took pains to describe himself) the highway to number 10 lay open before Jenkins. Neither of his immediate predecessors, Henry Brooke for the Conservatives and Sir Frank Soskice for Labour, had qualified as a great success, and to find a home secretary who had gone on to be prime minister it was then necessary to go all the way back to Winston Churchill. The Home Office had in fact acquired a reputation of being a graveyard for politicians&#151;and it is against that somewhat gloomy background that Jenkins's astonishing performance presiding over it for just under two years needs to be measured.<br>
<br>It was certainly not a case of Jenkins avoiding troubles or ducking out of difficulties: crises, ranging from the escape of the Soviet master spy George Blake from Wormwood Scrubs in October 1966 to the sinking of the American oil tanker the <span class="italic">Torrey Canyon</span> off the Scilly Isles at Easter 1967, crowded in upon him almost from the moment he took up office. What distinguished Jenkins from his immediate predecessors, though, was his determination actually to achieve reforms. He managed to persuade himself that he had heard &#145;a liberal hour&#146; strike and was determined to make use of it to introduce a whole range of enabling, empowering legislation. It thus came about that the years 1965&#150;7&#151;admittedly, largely through private member's bills facilitated by Jenkins&#151;witnessed an almost complete overhaul of Britain's social mores. The divorce laws were reformed, the legal treatment of homosexuals was made much less oppressive, abortion on demand accepted within legal and medical limits, and even the traditional theatrical censorship exercised by the lord chamberlain abolished. As a result Jenkins was later sometimes reproached for having created &#145;the permissive society&#146;; but what he had, in effect, done was to introduce altogether more civilized standards into British life.<br>
<br>Jenkins's first spell as home secretary was undeniably the high point of his career until that date, and some might be tempted to say that nothing he did later (certainly not his second reluctant spell at the Home Office in 1974&#150;6) surpassed it. He enjoyed regular debating triumphs in the House of Commons&#151;a particularly notable one being against Quintin Hogg in the debate on the George Blake escape from prison&#151;and became in addition the government's principal plenipotentiary on social legislation to the enlightened part of the electorate. It helped too that he started to assume some of the trappings of a great man, even following the example of his hero Asquith in buying a country home in Berkshire, the old vicarage, St Amand's House, at East Hendred (from 1974 in Oxfordshire), with its croquet lawn and tennis court, soon becoming almost a rival to Asquith's former Thames Valley home, The Wharf at Sutton Courtenay, in the amount of political entertaining that it witnessed. And, fittingly, it was the money he made from the publication of <span class="italic">Asquith</span> that had made this spreading of the Jenkins family's wings to the countryside possible.<br>
<br>Against this background of a neo-Edwardian lifestyle, it was perhaps surprising that Jenkins should have got on with Wilson as easily as he did. True, they shared some interests in common&#151;a passionate appetite for railway timetables being one of them. But their tastes remained markedly different, the prime minister being, for example, essentially a high-tea man while Jenkins always preferred a proper dinner. This was one of the differences that came out once they started living next door to one another in Downing Street towards the end of 1967&#151;Jenkins growing increasingly to dread a summons for &#145;an evening chat&#146; in the study of number 10 since it invariably ended with too much whisky having been drunk and no food of any kind being in sight. But in Jenkins's mind none of this mattered as compared with the debt that he came to realize he owed to Wilson&#151;something that he became especially aware of after the prime minister offered him his great opportunity by appointing him chancellor of the exchequer in succession to Callaghan in the wake of the sterling devaluation of November 1967. In taking that step Wilson must have known that he was gambling with his own future: the very qualities that led the prime minister to prefer Jenkins to Callaghan's candidate, Tony Crosland&#151;his command of the Commons, his proven ability to turn the tables on his critics in debate, the natural authority that he brought to the delivery of broadcasts&#151;were precisely the same ones that could be seen as constituting a threat to Wilson. In fact, as neighbours in numbers 10 and 11 the two men rubbed along pretty well&#151;most of the mischief being made by the more devoted acolytes of each rather than by the two principals themselves. (There were, though, exceptions even to that rule: Marcia Williams, the prime minister's dedicated political secretary, was always a doughty defender of Jenkins and the chancellor's Man Friday, John Harris, reciprocated in kind with his own high regard for Williams, though not for Wilson himself.)<br>
<br>When he became chancellor in November 1967 Jenkins would have been less than human if he had failed to wonder whether he might not have been handed a poisoned chalice. But, as his sense of realism probably told him, there are worse places to come in than at the bottom of the market. After devaluation there was only one obvious way for Britain's economic prospects to go&#151;and that was up. The new chancellor did, however, have to wait a long time for any break in the clouds to appear, and it was at least a year before he could be confident that the worst was behind him. From the spring of 1969 onwards, though, it became fairly clear that the economic corner had been turned and Jenkins's own position within the government became measurably stronger as a result. In his old age he himself became convinced that he had probably been nearer to the premiership in 1968&#150;9 than he would be at any other stage of his career&#151;but as he expressively wrote in the penultimate paragraph of his autobiography: &#145;I may have avoided doing too much stooping but I also missed conquering&#146;  (<span class="italic">A Life at the Centre</span>, 622). That was partly due to his own temperament, much closer to that of Asquith than to anyone else who had since got to number 10. As he put it slightly more ruefully in that same volume of memoirs: &#145;People who effectively seize the prime ministership&#151;Lloyd George, Macmillan, Mrs Thatcher&#151;do not let such moments slip&#146;  (ibid., 260).<br>
<br>But there was never any doubt from 1968 onwards, especially after the resignation of George Brown, the party's deputy leader, from the Foreign Office in March of that year, that Jenkins was the acknowledged second figure within the government. His tough budgets of 1968 and 1969 if anything reinforced his authority, which began to be somewhat equivalent to that of Stafford Cripps in 1947&#150;50. Only one external development undermined his position, and that was the dispute which arose with the trade unions over Barbara Castle's proposals for union reform contained in her white paper of January 1969, <span class="italic">In Place of Strife</span>. A strong supporter of this initiative&#151;if only because it promised to get him and the Treasury off the hook of trying to maintain a prices and incomes policy for a third successive year&#151;Jenkins was undeniably bruised by being forced to withdraw his endorsement from it once it became clear that opposition to it within the parliamentary party was such that it could not be got through the Commons division lobbies. Once again Jenkins never sought to disguise his own sense of shame, writing twenty years later: &#145;It was a sad episode from which he [Wilson] and Barbara Castle emerged with more credit than the rest of us&#146;  (<span class="italic">A Life at the Centre</span>, 290).<br>
<br>If one thing adversely affected Jenkins's long-term prospects after his less than heroic behaviour over <span class="italic">In Place of Strife</span> it was the resurgence in the fortunes of the home secretary, Jim Callaghan. He had led the charge both within the parliamentary party and on the national executive against the prime minister's and the first secretary's trade union proposals, and their defeat was necessarily his victory. The restoration of Callaghan's reputation was a bad blow to Jenkins, since it meant that there was no longer just a single viable alternative to Wilson but rather two rival contenders. For the last months of the 1966&#150;70 Labour government the prime minister played off the claims of his two rival potential challengers with consummate skill.<br>
<br>In his final weeks at the Treasury the chancellor also came under some criticism for not following the traditionally cynical strategy of a &#145;giveaway&#146; budget just before an election. Although Jenkins's April 1970 budget was easily the most lenient of the three he produced, it released only some &pound;150 million into the economy and was thought by some even of his cabinet colleagues to reflect far more the chancellor's own desire to preserve his reputation for probity than to enhance the party's prospects at the general election. Jenkins himself displayed little patience with this criticism, arguing that his 1970 budget &#145;caught the political mood better than a more generous Budget would have done&#146;  (<span class="italic">A Life at the Centre</span>, 292). And in that he was almost certainly right. The factors that undermined Labour at the 1970 general election&#151;the sharp turndown in the balance of trade figures, thanks to the purchase by British Airways of two jumbo jets, which only surfaced on the last weekend of the campaign, to say nothing of the deep despondency caused by England's defeat at the hands of West Germany in the quarter-final of the world cup held on the Sunday before polling day&#151;took some time to come into play. Indeed, if any one factor defeated Labour, it was probably its own overwhelming sense of complacency (as only too vividly reflected in the prime minister's almost monarchical national tour).<br>
<br>For his part Jenkins fought an energetic national campaign, delivering speeches in places as far apart as Plymouth, Glasgow, and Manchester, as well as giving one of the Labour Party's five TV election broadcasts, and he appears to have been convinced until the end that victory was well within grasp. (He had, in fact, already accepted the post of foreign secretary in any post-election Labour government, calculating that in any eventual leadership race, if he could cite experience at the Home Office, the Treasury, and the Foreign Office, he would hold a virtually unbeatable hand.) The actual election result, in which Edward Heath achieved a Conservative majority of thirty-one, thus came as a profound shock and removed arguably the best chance Jenkins had of becoming prime minister in any conventional way. (Wilson had already told him that, if the government were re-elected, he would not want to remain in number 10 indefinitely.)<h2>
<a name="OppositionandEurope"></a>Opposition and Europe</h2>Nevertheless, the first signs were that Jenkins's personal fortunes had hardly foundered. In July 1970, as a result of George Brown losing his seat of Belper at the general election, Jenkins was comfortably elected to be Labour's next deputy leader, easily defeating both Michael Foot and the new leader of the house, Fred Peart, on the first ballot. (Jim Callaghan, who already held the post of party treasurer, the gift of the annual conference, cannily stayed out of the contest.) It did not take long, however, for the threat to emerge that would eventually overturn the entire Jenkins dream of his political future.<br>
<br>In 1967 the Labour government, with Jenkins's enthusiastic support, had applied to join the EEC, only to see its application vetoed by President de Gaulle of France. After the election Wilson had planned to revive the application&#151;de Gaulle having meanwhile departed from the French presidency&#151;but now that option necessarily fell to Heath, who lost no time in announcing that Britain would once more apply to join. This faced Wilson and the Labour Party with a dilemma: given the split within the tories' own ranks on the issue, should Labour make things easy for Heath by supporting his application (just as he had backed the Labour one three years earlier) or did the imperatives of opposition politics demand that they try to put every obstacle in his way (if not over the principle, then at least over the terms that a Conservative government managed to secure)?<br>
<br>Perhaps predictably, Wilson came down in favour of the latter course, leaving Labour's &#145;pro-Europeans&#146; (who numerically were stronger than the Conservative &#145;antis&#146;) with a conflict of loyalties. Two successive Labour conferences were held at which a certain amount of blood was spilt but the issue had still not been resolved when the time came in October 1971 for Heath to put his bill authorizing signature to the treaty of accession before the House of Commons. The government whips then did a rather shrewd thing, letting it be known that a free vote would be granted to all tory MPs on what was essentially a debate culminating in a decision on principle. Labour, however, refused to follow suit, issuing a three-line whip to all Labour MPs requiring them to vote against the government. As a tactic, this totally misfired. Refusing to be bludgeoned into abandoning their convictions, no fewer than sixty-nine Labour MPs, led by Jenkins, joined the bulk of the government supporters in the &#145;aye&#146; lobby, while another twenty abstained, yielding the tory prime minister a comfortable majority of 112 in favour of the United Kingdom throwing in its lot with Europe.<br>
<br>As deputy leader, Jenkins immediately became the target of most of the loyalists' fury. For a back-bench MP to vote against the party line was one thing; for someone holding the number two position within the party's hierarchy to do the same was quite another. It was therefore a tribute to the hold his talents still exercised over his colleagues' minds that just one month later Jenkins should have been re-elected deputy leader&#151;even if this time it did require a run-off to secure a result. On the first ballot, declared on 10 November 1971, Jenkins had 140 votes to Michael Foot's 96 and Tony Benn's 46, thus being three votes short of a clearcut majority. But the second ballot, held a week later, revealed a less convincing victory: 140 votes again (for Jenkins) to 126 (for Foot), Benn having meanwhile been eliminated.<br>
<br>At the time even that slightly ambivalent result was received with great relief by what were now being openly called &#145;the Jenkinsites&#146;. But there can really be no doubt that the decision to stand again for the deputy leadership in the wake of the great European rebellion was a mistake. Having made the one symbolic gesture open to him, Jenkins, as deputy leader, found himself held virtually in protective custody, required night after night to vote against individual clauses in a government bill that he actually supported. He resigned from the shadow cabinet and as deputy leader in April 1972, ostensibly in a protest against the party coming out in favour of holding a referendum designed to accept or reject whatever terms were finally obtained, but in reality because he was sick at heart at all the humiliations he had already been put through. Although he took two other members of the shadow cabinet with him&#151;George Thomson and Harold Lever&#151;it was something of a botched d&eacute;marche, removing any last frail chance Jenkins retained of succeeding to the Labour leadership through an orderly process.<br>
<br>If the truth is that politicians can be divided into two categories&#151;those who operate riskily on the outside rails and those who can only prosper by hugging the inside track&#151;then there was never any question as to which classification, despite his occasional penchant for recklessness, Jenkins belonged to. The next eighteen months&#151;until, with his tail rather between his legs, he rejoined Wilson's shadow cabinet, no longer as shadow chancellor but rather as shadow home secretary in November 1973&#151;provided a stark proof of that. He treated the whole process rather as if it were a game of grandmother's footsteps in which he would take a couple of steps forward towards confrontation with Wilson and then rapidly (and clumsily) retreat by at least two further steps in the opposite direction whenever someone threatened to spot what he was up to. He was probably not helped either by some of his minions (both in the media and in parliament) being much more eager for combat than he was; but they were right in that the logic of his position was certainly that he should have stood against Wilson for the leadership in November 1973 and, when he failed to do so (and crawled back to the shadow cabinet instead), both his prestige and his standing were necessarily diminished.<h2>
<a name="ThethirdWilsongovernment19741976"></a>The third Wilson government, 1974&#150;1976</h2>When Heath made his great blunder of calling &#145;the miners' election&#146; of February 1974 it was Jenkins's view that not only would Labour not win it but that it did not even deserve to. Wilson's success on polling day in gaining four more seats than the Conservatives in the Commons (though fewer votes in the country) therefore brought his former deputy little joy. Jenkins's gloomy mood was, if anything, accentuated by the fact that it was by no means certain whether an appropriate niche could be found for him in the new government. He still nursed his young man's ambition to be foreign secretary but that, at least in Wilson's eyes, was clearly out of the question in light of Jenkins's passionate pro-European commitment. There remained the Treasury&#151;and there were some in the prime minister's entourage (including Marcia Williams) who felt strongly that Jenkins should be allowed to go back there. The potential candidate himself, however, refused to make any overt bid for the job, being content that it should go to Denis Healey, who had succeeded him as shadow chancellor after his departure from the opposition front bench in April 1972. Thus, as much by a process of elimination as by anything else, he found himself confronted with the offer of returning to the Home Office where he had last been eight years earlier. It was not a prospect that he approached with much relish&#151;witness the chapter heading (&#145;A recidivist home secretary&#146;) he gave to this portion of his career in his memoirs. Nor, even for the progressive section of the public, was this second coming anything like as exciting or exhilarating as his first arrival in 1965.<br>
<br>Inevitably, in this third Wilson government, Jenkins could not help looking like a spare wheel on the coach, someone whose undoubted talents were not being used constructively. When he managed to shine, it was most often in unorthodox initiatives, like his personal drafting of the Home Office statement on Northern Ireland's Price sisters, rejecting the hunger strike pressure they were trying to bring to bear in order to get themselves repatriated to Ireland. But what was certainly true was that he seldom, if ever, looked like a minister functioning at maximum capacity. Instead he was someone who tended to attract attention only when he stepped out of line&#151;as he did, for example, at Haverfordwest in July 1974 when, in a much reported speech, he drew attention to what he took to be the lurch to the left that the Labour Party was then undergoing. One year later, in defiance of his original reservations about the whole constitutional concept, he was also to lead the cross-party campaign for a &#145;yes&#146; vote in the June 1975 European referendum.<br>
<br>Conceivably it was recognition of the kind of danger he represented while on such a free rein that caused the prime minister to cast about and see if he could not discover some more fulfilling role for so able but awkward a colleague. When Wilson established that both Val&eacute;ry Giscard d'Estaing (president of France) and Helmut Schmidt (chancellor of West Germany) would be prepared to back the man who had once seemed his own natural successor to be the next (and first British) president of the European Commission in Brussels, he understandably thought that he had cracked the problem.<br>
<br>At first the implicit invitation to start a new life in Brussels does not appear greatly to have excited Jenkins. For one thing, he knew that it was by no means certain that Wilson would be in any position to deliver&#151;for he had already learned from the number 10 intimate Lord Goodman (though not from the prime minister himself) that Wilson was planning to retire in March 1976. In time gone by the imparting of such a secret would have galvanized Jenkins into high activity. But it did not do so on this occasion. Indeed, according to his own account, it failed to &#145;destroy my political lethargy&#146;. This he himself ascribed to a &#145;debilitating low flu&#146; which he suffered from throughout the latter part of January and well into February  (<span class="italic">A Life at the Centre</span>, 430), but it seems possible that a basic disengagement with British politics was already at work as well. In any event, having at first shown little interest in the prime minister's overture, he subsequently wrote to him intending to keep the door at least ajar (not an easy exercise since the one thing he could not own up to was his own knowledge, acquired from Lord Goodman, that when the time came Wilson might not be in any position to formalize the offer).<h2>
<a name="LeadershipcontestandpresidencyoftheEuropeanCommission"></a>Leadership contest, and presidency of the European Commission</h2>In fact, that was precisely how things worked out. When Wilson announced his surprise resignation on 16 March 1976, Jenkins immediately threw his hat into the ring to succeed him. He does not appear to have told any of his supporters of the half-offer to go to Brussels he already had in his back-pocket and&#151;among six candidates (Callaghan, Foot, himself, Healey, Benn, and Crosland)&#151;he fought a tenacious campaign to assert his right to the succession. From the beginning the general view was that Callaghan would emerge as the eventual victor with Jenkins possibly as his main rival but when the result of the first ballot was announced on 24 March it was sufficiently crushing for the home secretary to feel compelled to withdraw from the contest. He received a mere fifty-six votes&#151;at least ten fewer than his campaign manager had led him to expect&#151;to Callaghan's eighty-four and Foot's unpredicted ninety. (In the last, and conclusive, round of voting Callaghan comfortably defeated Foot by 176 votes to 137.)<br>
<br>The distribution of government jobs now rested with the new prime minister and, while Jenkins did not seek to hide from the outgoing foreign secretary his ambition to succeed him at the Foreign Office, it did him little good. Callaghan regarded him as altogether too committed and divisive a figure on Europe to hold the post&#151;Jenkins's successful leading of the pro-Europe forces in the previous summer's referendum campaign was no help here&#151;and proceeded instead to appoint Jenkins's old friend, and increasingly his rival, Tony Crosland. More perplexing was the new prime minister's decision to make no change at the Treasury, where Denis Healey was beginning to run into the troubles which finally led to the negotiations over the International Monetary Fund loan of the last months of 1976. It was, in fact, at that latter point that Callaghan relented and made an abortive attempt to persuade Jenkins to return as chancellor to Great George Street, but by then the EEC president-designate had become committed to going to Brussels, and it was too late.<br>
<br>The new prime minister proved, however, very accommodating over how long his departing home secretary should remain in the government, and Jenkins did not finally resign from the Home Office until September. He then embarked on a crash course to prepare himself for his new responsibilities, learning French and studying the whole complex internal structure of the Brussels commission. If he learned one early lesson, it was that a president of the European Commission was not at all in the same position as a British prime minister. When it came to the allocation of responsibilities it was not up to him to say who did what. All sorts of other factors (including the sensitivities of member states) had to be taken into account, and the task of distributing the various portfolios took up most of Jenkins's time and energy before he actually arrived in Brussels on 6 January 1977. What had been an untidy and messy business was more or less settled at a conference held at Ditchley Park in Oxfordshire&#151;with all potential commissioners and their wives present&#151;on the weekend before Christmas. The result may not have been everything the new president had wanted, but at least he had the consolation of knowing that it was the best he could obtain.<br>
<br>As a politician Jenkins brought to the post of president of the European Commission a greater sense of personal style than did most of his predecessors, who had tended to be bureaucrats. The economic recession of the post-1973 oil price rise meant, however, that the 1970s were not a promising decade in which to introduce further integrationist reforms. It was all the more credit to him, therefore, that he managed to secure the agreement of the community (except the United Kingdom) to set up the European monetary system, a first but necessary step towards the introduction of the common currency (whose long-delayed arrival did not take place until the beginning of the twenty-first century).<br>
<br>At first Jenkins was not particularly happy in Brussels, confessing in his early days that not a single night ever passed without his dreaming of the House of Commons. But once he had won his right of direct representation at Western summits&#151;a particularly tense battle in which he got no help from Giscard, Schmidt, or (more predictably) Callaghan&#151;he settled into his new role with greater confidence. What, however, he could not manage to do was to banish Westminster entirely from his mind. His renowned Dimbleby lecture, &#145;Home thoughts from abroad&#146;, arguing, if obliquely, for a realignment of British politics, was delivered on BBC1 on 22 November 1979, before he had even completed three years in the presidency, and from that moment European issues enjoyed no monopoly of interest in his mind.<br>
<br>Yet Jenkins still contrived to exercise self-discipline. This, paradoxically, was a quality that, contrary to the various legends that clung around him&#151;his interest in women, which was fully reciprocated, his consumption of drink, particularly claret, his Churchillian fondness until 1983, when he gave up smoking, for Havana cigars&#151;he much admired and even occasionally practised. Twice Callaghan offered him a peerage but twice he refused it, even though on the second occasion it was accompanied by a query as to whether he could make himself available to become governor of Hong Kong. Jenkins may not have found Brussels life particularly stimulating&#151;the regular stream of British visitors that came to his door in the rue de Praet&egrave;re was one proof of that&#151;but, having set his hand to the plough, he was determined to follow the furrow through to the end. On the other hand, the one idea that he does not seem seriously to have contemplated was renewing his presidency after the first four-year term. The notion of extending his term may have been floated by some members of the commission but the inflexible line displayed on European issues by the new British prime minister, Margaret Thatcher, soon put paid to that&#151;and, in any event, there is considerable doubt whether Jenkins himself would even have entertained it.<h2>
<a name="TheSocialDemocraticPartyandtheAlliance"></a>The Social Democratic Party and the Alliance</h2>Long before the hour of release came with the end of his tour in January 1981, Jenkins's mind had already begun to swing back firmly to British politics. Significantly, from January 1980 onwards, mention of discussions over what was always cautiously referred to as &#145;the new party&#146; began to surface in his &#145;European diary&#146;, a record of his period at the commission that he kept throughout his four years there but which had to wait for publication until 1989. What emerges clearly is that, from the beginning, Jenkins was the prime mover behind the formation of the Social Democratic Party (SDP). Perhaps, however, that was not altogether surprising. Unlike the other three Labour politicians usually credited with founding the SDP&#151;David Owen, Bill Rodgers, and Shirley Williams&#151;Jenkins was already footloose in terms of party affiliation (although entitled to a postal vote in the 1979 general election he had not even bothered to exercise it, a discovery that caused some consternation within the Labour Party when it leaked out some time after polling day). The truth was that Jenkins had gradually grown estranged from his political roots&#151;and the initial period in Brussels wrestling with the basically anti-European position of the Callaghan government had inevitably increased the pace of that estrangement. By contrast he had while still at the European Commission forged particularly close links with David Steel, the leader of the Liberal Party (and for whose party his wife, Jennifer, had actually voted on election day in May 1979). In fact, Steel possesses a claim to being the true founding father of the SDP, since it was at his insistent advice that Jenkins drew back from joining the Liberals (as had been his original intention) and instead chose to gamble everything on the formation of a new centre party.<br>
<br>Even at the time of Jenkins's Dimbleby lecture in November 1979 this had not been an embryonic project that commanded universal enthusiasm even among potential supporters&#151;Jo Grimond, the former Liberal leader, being particularly scathing about it. And as the preparations for launching the new party grew more overt&#151;as reflected, for example, in Jenkins's follow-up speech to the parliamentary press gallery on 9 June 1980&#151;the chorus of discouragement grew, if anything, in strength. If there was a single moment of breakthrough, it probably arrived when Owen, Rodgers, and Williams (or the &#145;gang of three&#146; as they had now begun to be called) published a collective manifesto as an &#145;open letter&#146; in both the <span class="italic">Daily Mirror</span> and <span class="italic">The Guardian</span> on 1 August 1980. It was a development that took place without reference to Jenkins, but he, perhaps more than anyone else, realized its significance.<br>
<br>That autumn&#151;occasionally in Brussels but mainly at his Oxfordshire home&#151;Jenkins became involved in a succession of meetings with the three leading potential defectors (all three of whom, like him, had once been Labour cabinet ministers). At first his addition to the group does not appear to have been given a universal welcome&#151;with David Owen, in particular, warning him that there could be no future for &#145;a centre party&#146; along the lines he was suggesting and that anyway the leader of any new political grouping that was formed would, on grounds of her public popularity alone, have to be Shirley Williams. Nevertheless, somehow or other, through the last months of 1980, the &#145;<script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/101205', "gang of four")</script>&#146; (as it had now inevitably come to be known) hung together&#151;though it was the Labour Party that ultimately cemented their alliance. After Labour's special conference at Wembley in January 1981 (at which the rules were changed for the election of a party leader, removing that right from Labour MPs and giving it instead to a new electoral college) it was widely assumed to be only a matter of time before the breakaway took place. In fact, the time needed proved to be very short. The very next day, speaking from outside David Owen's house in Limehouse, the gang of four announced the formation of a Council for Social Democracy, immediately recognized as merely a staging post towards the formation of a new political party.<br>
<br>The Social Democratic Party was formally launched at the Connaught Rooms in London on 26 March 1981 and started off with fourteen former Labour MPs and just one former Conservative member (Christopher Brocklebank-Fowler, the tory MP for Norfolk North-West). Yet, despite the fact that he was not in parliament, and had not sat in the Commons since the end of 1976, Jenkins was recognized from the beginning as the new movement's pivotal figure. This popular perception was not, however, an unmixed blessing. It meant that Jenkins immediately came under pressure to get himself back to Westminster&#151;something that he first attempted at a by-election in the safe Labour seat of Warrington in July 1981 and then achieved at Glasgow Hillhead in March 1982. Three months later the membership of the party in a postal ballot voted for him rather than David Owen (Shirley Williams having meanwhile been steered towards the party presidency) to be its first leader.<br>
<br>No one will ever know how different the history of the SDP might have been had the 43-year-old Owen rather than the 62-year-old Jenkins been chosen in the party's first (and only) leadership ballot. But by the time of the general election of 1983 (which the SDP fought as the Alliance with the Liberal Party), it had already become clear that among some of his leading colleagues Jenkins was coming to be viewed as a bit of a liability&#151;hence the somewhat clumsy attempt at the Ettrick Bridge &#145;summit&#146;, presided over by the Liberal leader David Steel and held in the middle of the campaign, to remove him from his already announced but faintly presumptuous position of &#145;Prime Minister-designate&#146;. Jenkins survived that abortive <i>putsch</i> only to find himself, once the distinctly gloomy election results for the SDP had been announced, confronting a fresh leadership challenge from David Owen. Rather than face him in open combat&#151;he had won their previous engagement in the summer of 1982 only by the fairly slender margin of 26,256 votes to 20,864&#151;Jenkins chose to retire from the party leadership, allowing his rival to be elected unopposed. It was a sad ending to an attempt at a second coming in British politics which had started propitiously enough but which then, thanks to a number of extraneous factors (including Margaret Thatcher's success in the Falklands War), had signally failed to fulfil its early promise.<br>
<br>Although Jenkins retained his seat at Glasgow Hillhead in the 1983 election&#151;just about the one cheerful result for the SDP, which despite gaining 11.6 per cent of the national vote saw its representation in the Commons decrease from twenty-nine to six, alongside seventeen seats for Steel's Liberals, on 13.7 per cent of the vote&#151;the years after the general election effectively marked Jenkins's withdrawal from front-line politics. This was partly due to ill health. Towards the end of 1984 he underwent a prostate operation, with complications that did not really clear up for more than two years. But it also owed something to his disillusionment with the contemporary House of Commons. Although, when fit, he continued to appear there, his inability to cope with insults and interjections from a group of left-wing Labour back-benchers sitting alongside him below the gangway made him lose all relish for the chamber he had once dominated. His relations, too, with his new party leader David Owen remained edgy and, as the rump of the SDP groped its way towards merger with the Liberals&#151;a prospect favoured by Jenkins but fiercely opposed by Owen&#151;the gulf between them perceptibly widened. The final detonation of this fundamental difference did not, however, take place until after the 1987 election when Jenkins, having lost his own Glasgow seat to George Galloway (then standing for the Labour Party), took the majority of what was left of the SDP into an arranged marriage with the Liberal Party (initially as the Social and Liberal Democrats, then from 1989 as the Liberal Democrats) while Owen defiantly placed himself at the head of a body called &#145;the continuing SDP&#146; which survived barely three years before receiving its quietus by running behind even Screaming Lord Sutch's Monster Raving Loony Cavern Rock Party at a by-election held at Bootle in May 1990.<h2>
<a name="Laterlife"></a>Later life</h2>Superficially Jenkins's career could be said to vindicate Enoch Powell's dictum that &#145;all political lives end in failure&#146;. Yet any such judgement is singularly inapposite. For his life story affords a rare example of a case in which the best was kept to the last. Had Jenkins retired in 1983, when he lost the leadership of the SDP, or, indeed, in 1987 when he was defeated in the third constituency he had represented in parliament, his various achievements both as a politician and as a writer would certainly have commanded recognition. What lends his career, though, its unique distinction is the purpose to which he put the final fifteen years of his life. His three best-known books&#151;his own autobiography, <span class="italic">A Life at the Centre</span> (1991), his life of Gladstone (1995), and his one-volume biography of Churchill (2001)&#151;were all written when he was in his seventies. Similarly, the elective office which probably brought him the most pleasure&#151;his chancellorship of Oxford University, won in a first-past-the-post contest against two distinguished Conservatives, the political historian Lord Blake and his own old Balliol contemporary Edward Heath&#151;only just predated his forced departure from the Commons. In this role, for fifteen years he officiated at degree ceremonies and other formal functions, welcomed visiting dignitaries, and presided over the university during a period marked by defence of its independence and transformation of its finances. And, even in politics, he could probably claim to have wielded as much influence in the final phase of his career as he had at any other stage, with the possible exception of the latter half of the 1960s.<br>
<br>Not only, on leaving the Commons, did Jenkins accept a life peerage (as Baron Jenkins of Hillhead) and almost instantly become the leader of, and the highly eloquent spokesman for, the sixty-odd Liberal Democrat peers. He also, even more significantly, became a personal guide and political mentor to, first, the youthful leader of the opposition and then, from 1997, the young prime minister, Tony Blair, who openly saw him (through his founding of the SDP) as the godfather of &#145;new&#146; Labour&#151;though Blair contrived to ignore the recommendations of the commission on electoral systems which he appointed Jenkins to chair in 1997, and which reported in 1998. By the end of his life when, among many other honours, he held the presidency of the Royal Society of Literature, Jenkins had become very much the grand old man of British public life, a portly but always lively presence somehow contriving to evoke memories of another, more civilized age, when politics and literature often walked together. His critics sometimes charged him with &#145;seeing politics very much like Trollope&#146;  (Healey, 329), and there may have been a sense in which he was born out of his time&#151;witness the label often affixed to him of being the last of the whigs. But that he had a considerable impact (more than many prime ministers) on the actual age in which he lived is beyond argument. It was fitting that, exceptionally for a politician who never reached number 10, he was in 1993 singled out for recognition by the queen with the award of the Order of Merit.<br>
<br>Jenkins died of heart failure at his home, St Amand's House, East Hendred, Oxfordshire, on 5 January 2003 (he had undergone a heart bypass operation at the Wellington Hospital in St John's Wood in the autumn of 2000). His funeral, attended by Tony Blair and his wife, took place in the village church that same week, and he was buried in the village churchyard. A memorial service was subsequently held in Westminster Abbey. His wife and three children survived him.<br>
