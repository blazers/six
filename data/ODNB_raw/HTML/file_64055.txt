<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Hall,  Peter Andrew</span>  (1936&#150;1996), <span class="occ">folklorist and musicologist</span>, was born on 28 June 1936 at 285 Harrow Road, Paddington, London, the son of Thomas Temple Hall, corporal in the Coldstream Guards, and Marion Coghill Smith. His parents married shortly after his birth. After an upbringing in Aberdeen and Newcastle, Hall entered Aberdeen University in 1955 to read first medicine and then, after national service, science. He after entered the teaching profession, first as an uncertified teacher, though he graduated BEd from Aberdeen University in 1972. He spent a professional lifetime in the region as a dedicated, stimulating, and popular teacher of physics, standing down only weeks before his death. On 17 February 1959 he married a fellow student, Marion Harvey Maclennan (<i>b</i>. 1939); they had a daughter and a son. She was later to become an obstetrician and gynaecologist of international repute.<br>
<br>Hall and his wife shared a love of music, and with the advent of the folk-song revival in the early 1960s his obsession with playing in jazz bands was transmuted into a consuming interest in folk-song and folklore. The north-east of Scotland had been known to scholars for hundreds of years as one of the richest areas in the world for its vibrant tradition of folk-song. Francis Child of Harvard searched there successfully for the great balladry of Britain in the nineteenth century; at the beginning of the twentieth the region produced the 3100 songs of the <span class="italic">Greig&#150;Duncan Folk Song Collection</span>. In the 1960s the area was still rich in song and performers, including the travellers, of whom Jeannie Robertson became a famous example. Hall rapidly became an expert on folk-song and traditional culture and an experienced collector. A founder member of the influential Aberdeen Folk Song Club in 1962, he established a group, the Gaugers, to perform the rich north-east material in 1967, bringing out <span class="italic">Beware of the Aberdonian</span> in 1976; they were in the process of completing a series of commercial recordings for Aberdeen City Library at the time of his death.<br>
<br>Hall tape-recorded more than 600 items of folk-song and folk-tale from tramps and travellers, farmworkers, and folk in general in Aberdeen, Aberdeenshire, Banffshire, and the west of Ireland. Many of these were later used in commercial recordings and in radio and television broadcasts. He was a spirited singer and able musician (having exchanged the jazz trumpet for the concertina and melodeon), and performed on radio and television and at concerts and festivals throughout Britain, France, Germany, and Belgium. He was as much in demand as a superb musicologist (who could also wear his scholarship lightly) to write record notes, produce broadcasts, and judge in competitions, especially of the Traditional Music and Song Association of Scotland. He wrote articles, both scholarly and popular, and was the first editor (later musical editor) of the folk revival magazine <span class="italic">Chapbook</span>, from 1964 to 1969. Supervised by the eminent sociologist Ian Carter, he gained an MLitt degree from Aberdeen University in 1985 for his thesis &#145;Folk songs of north east farm servants in the nineteenth century&#146;, the &#145;bothy ballads&#146;. It remains the classic work on the subject, but he was too modest to publish, preferring to distil much of its content into an authoritative introduction to volume three of the <span class="italic">Greig&#150;Duncan Folk Song Collection</span>, which he co-edited in 1987. He collaborated with Norman Buchan MP to produce the thoroughly researched and influential <span class="italic">The Scottish Folksinger</span> in 1973 (reprinted in 1986). In 1995 he was invited to be consultant to the Edinburgh International Festival for a unique and highly acclaimed series of twenty-one concerts of songs from the north-east of Scotland, based on the <span class="italic">Greig&#150;Duncan</span> collection.<br>
<br>Bearded and stockily built, this deeply modest man was a committed socialist and humanist. An <i>uomo universale</i>, Hall was a scientist who loved the arts, a scholar who loved hill walking, a devotee of both classical and folk music, and a talented photographer whose work was exhibited in Aberdeen Art Gallery. A sympathetic and loyal friend, he was kindly and generous (especially with his research findings), and a humorous and fascinating conversationalist who gave very careful thought to any question asked of him. He was as much in demand for talks to local associations and continuing education groups as for international conferences, where he was renowned for his clarity, humour, musical illustrations, and startling originality. Having committed all too little of his encyclopaedic knowledge and extensive findings to print in his lifetime, he worked on his researches until the very end, concerned that he was leaving so much unfinished by nature of the sudden onset and rapidity of his illness. He died of cancer of the stomach in Aberdeen Royal Infirmary on 5 December 1996 and was cremated following a humanist service at Aberdeen crematorium on 10 December. He was survived by his wife and two children.<br>
