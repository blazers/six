<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Canal,  Giovanni Antonio</span> <span class="st"> [<em>known as </em>Canaletto]</span>  (1697&#150;1768), <span class="occ">painter</span>, was born on 17 October 1697 in the district of San Lio, Venice, and was baptized on 30 October in the church of San Lio, the eldest of four children of Bernardo Canal (1674&#150;1744), painter, and his wife, Artemisia Barbieri (<i>fl</i>. 1694&#150;1739). The Canal family, whose lineage is traceable in Venice from the mid-sixteenth century, were &#145;cittadini originari&#146;, a class immediately below the patrician, which permitted them to use a coat of arms.<br>
<br>Canaletto, as the artist came to be known at an early stage in his career, was presumably trained by his father, who seems to have been employed primarily in the production of stage scenery. It is as an assistant to his father in this activity that Canaletto is first recorded, in Venice and also subsequently, in 1719&#150;20, in Rome. The statements of Orlandi and Zanetti that it was on this&#151;his only&#151;visit to Rome that he was first inspired to paint and draw his surroundings are borne out by the earliest works attributable to him. An album, later broken up, of twenty-three drawings of views of Rome (of which one sheet is in the Hessischen Landesmuseum, Darmstadt, and the remainder in the British Museum) and a group of a dozen views of Rome and <i>capricci</i> (imaginary assemblages of buildings, often incorporating real elements) reflect Canaletto's training in scenography. Their authenticity has, until recently, often been questioned (but see the catalogue of Christies, London, sale 16 December 1998, lot 76, for a documented example).<br>
<br>Canaletto probably returned to Venice in 1720, when he was inscribed in the Venetian painters' guild, and after a modest start his work shows a remarkably rapid development during the 1720s. His first dated painting, a very large <span class="italic">Capriccio of Classical Ruins and a Pyramid</span>, signed and dated 1723 (priv. coll., Italy), and its pendant (priv. coll., Switzerland), painted for the Giovanelli family's villa at Noventa Padovana, already surpass in technical skill, inventiveness (and size) anything in this genre produced by contemporaries. They were closely followed by two allegorical paintings to which Canaletto contributed architectural elements: <span class="italic">Capriccio: Tomb of Lord Somers, with Ruins and Landscape</span> (priv. coll., England) and <span class="italic">Capriccio: Tomb of Archbishop Tillotson</span> (priv. coll.). These were executed in collaboration with G. B. Cimaroli and G. B. Piazzetta (in the former) and G. B. Cimaroli and G. B. Pittoni (in the latter). By this time, however, he had begun to appreciate, as had his predecessor Luca Carlevarijs (1663&#150;1730), the first of the great Venetian view painters, now nearing the end of a long career, that the demand for views of Venice among foreign visitors to the city offered far greater market potential than did any local interest in <i>capricci</i>. The two allegorical tombs had been painted for the Irish impresario and agent Owen McSwiny, and were preceded by six large views of the piazza and piazzetta San Marco (Royal Collection) executed <i>c</i>.1723 for the English merchant banker Joseph Smith (for some years British consul there) and by a set of four Venetian views of <i>c</i>.1724 presumably painted for Prince Josef Wenzel von Liechtenstein (Museo Thyssen-Bornemisza, Madrid, and Ca' Rezzonico, Venice). His earliest documented Venetian views, a set of four supplied for Stefano Conti of Lucca in 1725&#150;6 (priv. coll.), are the last major commission he was to execute for an Italian. These and the roughly contemporary <span class="italic">Venice: Santa Maria della Carit&agrave; from the Campo San Vidal</span> (&#145;The Stonemason's Yard&#146;, National Gallery, London) display a mastery of perspective and skill at defining form and texture, combined with an acute sensitivity to atmospheric effects of light, rendered with a vivacity of brushwork completely new to Italian view painting. These qualities, and the small, bustling figures, show why contemporaries were already praising Canaletto's work as truer to nature than Carlevarijs's. All, however, include distortions intended to &#145;improve&#146; reality for pictorial effect, a feature of the artist's approach at all stages of his career, and one which would seem to refute the often-repeated assertion that he relied heavily on the use of the camera obscura.<br>
<br>By the end of the 1720s Canaletto had demonstrated his ability to paint with equal success on a small scale, in nine views executed, exceptionally, on copper. There are pairs at Goodwood, Sussex, Chatsworth, Derbyshire, Holkham Hall, Norfolk, and in a Belgian private collection; and a single plate in the Mus&eacute;e de Strasbourg. These show his native city bathed in sunshine, delineated with considerable attention to detail and populated by townsfolk going about their everyday business, all characteristics of his mature style which was crystallizing in these years. In 1729&#150;30 Canaletto added to his repertory the depiction, pioneered by Carlevarijs, of ceremonial events and festivals, in two pairs of large canvases celebrating the visits to Venice of the French comte de Gergy (Hermitage Museum, St Petersburg, and Pushkin Museum, Moscow) and the Spanish conde de Bolagnos (priv. coll., Milan). He had also gained a reputation for being complicated. Owen McSwiny, writing to the duke of Richmond in 1727, noted that:<blockquote>The fellow is whimsical and varys his prices every day: and he that has a mind to have any of his work, must not seem to be too fond of it, for he'l be the worse treated for it, both in the price and the painting too. (MS letter, 28 Nov 1727, W. Sussex RO, Chichester)</blockquote>One of the few people who seems not to have found him difficult to deal with was Joseph Smith, with whom Canaletto's fortunes are inextricably bound up from the late 1720s to the early 1750s. Consul Smith, himself one of the foremost collectors in Venice, acquired over three decades no fewer than fifty paintings by the artist, which he housed in his palace on the Grand Canal and eventually sold <i>en bloc</i> to George III in 1762, along with 142 drawings, over a quarter of Canaletto's surviving work in that medium. He was a superb draughtsman, whether making rough sketches on the spot or executing finished compositions intended for the use of engravers or as finished works. It was the more finished type of drawing which appealed to Smith and the sale fortunately ensured the preservation of Smith's collection intact to the present day as the single most important group of Canaletto's works (Royal Collection). Another large collection of his drawings is in the British Museum. An album of engravings by Antonio Visentini of fourteen of Consul Smith's collection of paintings was published in 1735. This served to disseminate Canaletto's compositions widely and to enhance his fame, as well as providing, on the frontispiece, the only reliable record of the artist's appearance. A second edition followed in 1742, augmented by engravings of a further twenty-four paintings which had been handled but not retained by Smith. Smith was already acting as an agent and intermediary in the sale of Canaletto's work to English collectors by 1730, when he supplied pairs of canvases to Hugh Howard and Samuel Hill (Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, and Tatton Park, Cheshire). These were followed by a constant flow of commissions throughout the 1730s, the decade which marks the peak of Canaletto's career, including the two large series of (relatively small) Venetian views now at Woburn Abbey and formerly in the Harvey collection. The masterpiece of these years, <span class="italic">Venice: the Riva degli Schiavoni Looking West</span> (Sir John Soane's Museum, London), was, however, painted not for Consul Smith but for the other great foreign collector resident in Venice, Marshal von der Schulenburg. With the demand for Canaletto's work came a need to delegate to assistants, who included in the late 1730s and early 1740s his nephew Bernardo Bellotto, the only artist to rival him as the greatest Italian view painter of the eighteenth century. The involvement of assistants contributes to an increasing hardening of the delineation of the architectural elements of his views, while the treatment of the figures is increasingly calligraphic.<br>
<br>The outbreak of the War of the Austrian Succession in 1741 restricted travel to Venice and helped to diminish the number of commissions for paintings of Venetian views. Canaletto had, however, shown an appetite for new challenges from the onset of the decade, making a tour of the Brenta Canal in 1740&#150;41 to gather fresh subject matter and working on a series of thirty-one etchings. He also turned back to ancient Rome and to <i>capricci</i> for the subjects of series of paintings executed for Consul Smith in 1742&#150;4, years in which many pictures are, exceptionally, signed and dated. His style shows a new coldness of light, similar to that characteristic of Bellotto's paintings from the outset, above all in the masterpiece of these years, <span class="italic">Venice: the Upper Reaches of the Grand Canal with San Simeone Piccolo</span> (National Gallery, London).<br>
<br>The greatest challenge was provided by Canaletto's move to London in May 1746. There he was to remain for ten years, resident at 16 Silver Street (now 41 Beak Street), north of Golden Square, except for an eight-month return to Venice in 1750&#150;51. Although his English paintings, for which he adopted a lighter tonality, vary in quality, they amount to a definitive depiction of eighteenth-century London (as in <span class="italic">London: the Thames from Somerset House Terrace towards the City</span> and <span class="italic">London: the Thames from Somerset House Terrace towards Westminster</span>, both Royal Collection), and many country seats, and Canaletto soon found himself as busy as he had been in the 1730s. Groups or pairs of pictures executed for the dukes of Richmond, Northumberland, and Beaufort and Prince Lobkowicz are still in the possession of their descendants, while groups painted for Lord Brooke, later earl of Warwick (five views of Warwick Castle), Baron King, and Thomas Hollis (views of London including Westminster Bridge, St Paul's Cathedral, and a <i>capriccio</i> of buildings in Whitehall), have been dispersed. Large views of St James's Park (presumably the painting owned by the Sir Andrew Lloyd Webber Art Foundation) and of Chelsea College (its canvas divided at an early date into two parts; one now in the Museo Nacional de Bellas Artes, Havana, Cuba, and the other at Blickling Hall, Norfolk), were apparently executed as speculations in 1749 and 1751 respectively. Canaletto's activity in England had a stimulating effect on local topographical painters, most notably Samuel Scott and William Marlow.<br>
<br>Four large Venetian views executed shortly after his return to Italy for the German businessman Sigmund Streit (Gem&auml;ldegalerie, Berlin) show Canaletto's powers undiminished, but many works of his later years are small, dark in tone, and populated by exaggeratedly calligraphic figures. One of the very few recorded personal encounters between the artist and English clients took place in 1761 or 1762, when John Crewe, later first Baron Crewe, and the Revd John Hinchliffe encountered him in the piazza San Marco &#145;making a sketch of the Campanile&#146;, according to Hinchliffe's grandson  (Links, <span class="italic">Canaletto</span>, 195&#150;7). Only in 1763 did he receive official recognition, being elected to the Venetian Academy and appointed prior of the Collegio dei Pittori. Canaletto died in Venice, of fever, on 19 April 1768, possibly in the house in which he had been born. He was unmarried. Despite his modest lifestyle he left his three sisters almost nothing except for a small investment in property made on his return visit to Venice in 1750. Canaletto was buried in the communal tomb of the confraternity of the Santissimo Spirito in the church of San Lio, Venice.<br>
