<span class="headword">Cade,  William</span>  (<em>d.</em> in or before 1166), <span class="occ">financier</span>, is first noted in the early 1150s and was dead by 1166, when a note of his debts came to the exchequer. It shows that he was owed approximately &pound;5000 by about 200 individuals. In just a few cases the bonds that lie behind these transactions have survived, and they show how his loans were arranged and secured. Cade occurs frequently in the early pipe rolls of Henry II's reign, where payments to him of about &pound;5600 are recorded, in settlement of various loans that he had made to the crown. These records establish his importance (his operations were crucial to the establishment of the Angevin dynasty in England) but supply little by way of biographical information.<br>
<br>It is clear that Cade was a Fleming from St Omer: he had a house there, close connections with local monasteries, and members of his family have Flemish names. The names of his parents are not known, nor is that of his wife, but he had brothers Baldwin and Eustace, and sons Eustace and Ernulf. The latter gave to the hospitallers land in Stalisfield and Oare close to Faversham in Kent; and a descendant of the same name held a manor at Ospring, which was known as Cade's manor as late as the eighteenth century. Faversham was one of the main centres in England of the honour of Boulogne, which county lay against the border of western Flanders, whose mercantile centre was at St Omer. The supply of wool from England to Flanders provided the main economic link between the two areas; and it is not surprising to find a merchant financier with a base at each end of this trade.<br>
<br>The Flemings who surrounded King Stephen and sustained his cause were not popular in England, and the peace settlements of 1153 provided that they be sent home. William Cade, however, was clearly indispensable to the financial operations of the crown. The exchequer was still functioning, but in a limited and <i>ad hoc</i> way. Cade could provide for both the crown and its debtors credit and financial expertise. He was one of a select group, which included the justiciars Robert, earl of Leicester (<i>d</i>. 1168), and Richard de Lucy (<i>d</i>. 1179), and the treasurer Nigel, bishop of Ely (<i>d</i>. 1169), who provided continuity between the old and the new regimes. Cade was the man behind the men behind the scenes.<br>
<br>The evidence for Cade's operations suggests that they shared many of the characteristics of the better-known Italian merchant bankers of the late middle ages. It was a family firm. Cade was in partnership with his brother and son, and debts were repayable to any partner, in London or in St Omer. Careful arrangements were made to secure loans. The crown's credit was good, but still it needed to assign some regular revenue: thus Cade had the farm of Dover from 1154 (and presumably earlier) until 1161. Individuals might assign the income from specified lands to pay off their debts, pledge their own faith, and produce guarantors. The position of churchmen in such transactions caused some debate, and their giving security was forbidden in the constitutions of Clarendon of 1164. This was because of the element of usury involved. At times it was blatant, as when the sheriff of Hampshire, presumably in order to enable him to settle a debt at the exchequer, borrowed &pound;61 12<i>s</i>. 8<i>d</i>., paying &#145;for each pound 2<i>d</i>. in interest a week&#146;  (Jenkinson, &#145;A money-lender's bonds&#146;, no. 2). More often Cade exacted a bond for a sum larger than the amount of cash advanced.<br>
<br>Towards the end of his life Cade was being superseded by Jewish moneylenders, and as a Christian usurer he would come to appear as something of an anomaly after his death. He was, however, long remembered. About 1202 the canonist Robert de Courson (<i>d</i>. 1219) cited him as a man &#145;who became immensely rich through lending money to innumerable merchants throughout the world&#146;  (Haskins, 730), objecting that in his partnerships he shared the profits but kept the capital safe. Cade founded no dynasty, but in his day he was a major operator in what R. H. Tawney in 1958 called &#145;the ambiguous <i>demi-monde</i> between politics and business&#146;  (Tawney, 81).<br>
