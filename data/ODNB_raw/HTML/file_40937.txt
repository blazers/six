<span class="headword">Dando,  Joseph Haydon Bourne</span>  (1806&#150;1894), <span class="occ">violinist</span>, was born on 11 May 1806 at Somers Town in London. Nothing is known of his parents. He began to study the violin with his uncle Gaetano Brandi and was then a pupil of Nicolas Mori for seven years (1819&#150;26). He was page to his teacher at the coronation of George IV, and later performed at the coronations of William IV and Queen Victoria.<br>
<br>After leading some concerts in London, Dando joined the Philharmonic Orchestra (1831&#150;55) and subsequently became a well-known orchestral leader in the capital and the provinces, appearing with orchestras such as those of the Classical Harmonists' and Choral Harmonists' societies. In 1832 he played in the first English performance of Beethoven's <span class="italic">Fidelio</span> in the Haymarket Theatre. Dando did perform as a soloist, but it was as a chamber musician that he achieved his reputation. He is best known for organizing the first public concert in England with a programme consisting exclusively of string quartets. This benefit concert, with Dando leading, took place on 23 September 1835 at the Horn tavern, Doctors' Commons, and was followed by two more, on 12 and 26 October. The success of these performances led to the establishment of a regular series of quartet concerts involving Dando, at first at the same place, then at the London tavern, and finally at the Hanover Square Rooms. A group for the performance of chamber music was then formed, with Henry Blagrove, Henry Gattie (violins), Charles Lucas (cello), and Dando (viola), which performed together for seven seasons from 17 March 1836 to 29 April 1842, when Blagrove left the group. Dando then became leader and John Fawcett Loder played viola. The newly restored throne room of Crosby Hall in Bishopsgate Street became the venue for the concerts, in place of Hanover Square, until the deaths of Gattie and Loder in 1853. Dando and his colleagues gave first English performances of Haydn's <span class="italic">The Seven Last Words</span> (15 April 1843), Mendelssohn's quartet in E[flat] (op. 44, no. 3), and Schumann's quartet in A minor. He was a friend of Spohr and of Mendelssohn, who played at one of the Crosby Hall concerts (8 June 1844). As a result of a stiffening of the third finger of his left hand, Dando was forced to give up the violin in the early 1870s and in 1875 became music master at Charterhouse School, Godalming, where he worked until a short time before he died, on 9 May 1894, at his home, Attwell Cottage, Peper-Harrow Road, Godalming.<br>
<br>Dando was characterized by Dubourg, who considered him to be a leading contemporary violinist, as a man of &#145;agreeable manners&#146; and &#145;professional merits&#146;  (Dubourg, 295); his playing was described as combining elegance of expression, neatness, and vigour when required. He was a popular teacher, a conductor of amateur orchestras, and also composed and arranged a small number of pieces.<br>
