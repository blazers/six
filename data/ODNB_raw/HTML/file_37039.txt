<span class="headword">Wright, Sir  Robert Samuel</span>  (1839&#150;1904), <span class="occ">judge and jurist</span>, born at Litton rectory, Litton, Somerset, on 20 January 1839, was the eldest son of the Revd Henry Edward Wright, rector of Litton, and his wife, a daughter of the Revd Edward Edgell. He was educated at King's School, Bruton, Somerset, before matriculating in 1856 at Balliol College, Oxford, where he was awarded a scholarship in 1857. One of Benjamin Jowett's favourite pupils (and subsequently his close and lifelong friend) he had a brilliant university career. He gained first classes in classical moderations (1859) and in <i>literae humaniores</i> (1860). He won university prizes for his Latin verse (1859), English essay (1861), and historical essay (1862). In 1861 he was Craven scholar. He was a fellow of Oriel from 1861 to 1880 and an honorary fellow there in 1882. The influence of Balliol and Balliol graduates may be detected at almost every stage of Wright's life, and there was a certain appropriateness in death having come to the college's most famous master while staying with his former pupil.<br>
<br>Wright's sights were set on the law. He became a student of the Inner Temple in London in November 1861 and, after proceeding BCL in 1863, he was called to the bar in June 1865. But he did not immediately abandon the classics: he remained in Oxford until 1865, teaching privately and examining for the university. He edited <span class="italic">A Golden Treasury of Ancient Greek Poetry</span> (1866) and, with J. E. L. Shadwell, <span class="italic">A Golden Treasury of Greek Prose</span> (1870). During this period he also helped with Colonial Office inquiries into hospitals and lunatic asylums, in 1863&#150;4, and prisons, in 1864&#150;7, and with the Taunton commission's inquiry in 1864&#150;6 into the need for secondary schools in towns without endowed grammar schools.<br>
<br>Wright's work (and his Balliol connections) led in 1870 to his appointment as secretary to the royal commission on the truck system, whose report (1871, C.326) he had a large hand in writing. It also led to the Colonial Office inviting him to draft a criminal code for Jamaica (1877, C.1893) that might also serve as a model for other colonies. His on-the-spot investigations into evasions of the 1833 <span class="roman">Truck Act</span> by colliery owners and other employers reinforced his radical instincts (which revealed themselves also in his support for university education for women), making him a strong supporter of the trades union and land nationalization movements, while his code work led him to think hard about the principles underlying the criminal law. His elegant, lucid, and concise essay, <span class="italic">The Law of Criminal Conspiracies and Agreements</span> (1873), for a century the classical text, reflects both concerns: it was this branch of the law that was then chiefly being deployed against organized labour.<br>
<br>Although well-regarded and formally approved, the code&#151;and its accompanying code of criminal procedure, also drafted by Wright&#151;was never brought into force in Jamaica. Indeed, despite its status in the 1880s and 1890s as a model code for the colonies, it was brought into force in only four other Caribbean colonies and, across the Atlantic, in the Gold Coast (in 1892). After all the controversy surrounding the contemporary English scheme for codification based on Sir James Fitzjames Stephen's draft code of 1878, it seems to have been thought inadvisable that a colony with so blemished a recent legal history should get too far ahead of the mother country. Yet Wright's code was, in several respects, rather better than Stephen's. It was more detailed, leaving less to &#145;the common law&#146;, providing more definitions (especially of fault terms), and dealing more fully with the general principles governing all the individual offences. It was also more liberal in such matters as murder, attempted suicide, abortion, and sedition, and it gave wider discretion to the jury in cases of insanity. The procedure code included forward-looking provisions for a public prosecutor, for the defendant to be examined by the court, and for majority verdicts by juries, and it gave rights of appeal to both prosecution and defence.<br>
<br>Wright's attention was next directed, by Earl Cairns and the newly established statute law committee, to English criminal law, but his &#145;Report on the consolidation [and simplification] of the criminal statutes&#146;  (<span class="italic">Parl. papers</span>, 1877&#150;8, HL, 178) was, like the Jamaican codes, lost in the codification debacle. Wright had, meanwhile, been building up a substantial practice, as much advisory as forensic, in London and on the northern circuit, and had attained sufficient standing to conduct the official inquiries into several colliery disasters. Appointment (by Sir Henry James) as junior counsel to the Treasury (&#145;the attorney-general's devil&#146;) followed in 1883, and Wright prosecuted in that year's Fenian trials. He also appeared in the Dilke divorce case of 1886.<br>
<br>An attorney-general's &#145;devil&#146; himself needs a &#145;devil's&#146; services. They were initially provided for Wright by H. H. Asquith, the future prime minister (and a Balliol graduate), who remembered Wright's eccentric but regular habits as a bachelor living and working in the Temple, rising early, walking to the Reform Club for his breakfast and his dinner, and, when not in court, spending all day in chambers &#145;with a tall hat on his head and a briar pipe in his mouth. He was an indefatigable worker and smoker&#146;, little interested in social life, though &#145;fond of country sports, especially shooting&#146;  (Asquith, 1.82&#150;3). His interest in the theory of the law continued, and with Sir Frederick Pollock he published <span class="italic">An Essay on Possession in the Common Law</span> (1883), &#145;a composite, not a joint, work&#146;, Wright dealing with the concept in the criminal law. Like his essay <span class="italic">Conspiracies</span> it remains authoritative. <span class="italic">An Outline of Local Government and Local Taxation</span>, written with Henry Hobhouse, followed in 1884 and reached an eighth edition in 1937.<br>
<br>Wright stood for parliament as a Liberal, unsuccessfully, for Norwich in 1884 and for Stepney in 1886. Lord Coleridge, the chief justice, and Mr Justice Bowen (both Balliol graduates), were nevertheless able to persuade the Conservative Lord Chancellor Halsbury to appoint him (on 11 December 1890) a judge in the Queen's Bench Division where there was, they said, &#145;a great need for a strong man &hellip; not only a lawyer, but a man of force of mind and character&#146;. They considered Wright &#145;probably the ablest man at the Bar, except four or five men at the very head who do not practically count for this place, a scholar, a man of distinction&#146;  (Heuston, 44). Their expectations may not have been wholly fulfilled. Wright discomforted counsel by his &#145;abrupt speech and angular and peppery manner&#146;  (Asquith, 1.82&#150;3), to which, as well as great kindness and generosity, Asquith also attested (and <span class="italic">Vanity Fair</span>, on 27 June 1891, added the charge of &#145;being as full of superciliousness as a good Radical should be&#146;); however, Wright's summings-up in criminal cases were famously favourable to defendants and his sentences notably lenient. (Poachers of his own game were always proceeded against civilly, in the county court, not criminally.) Yet his reputation as a lawyer is such that his best-known decision, in the case of <i>Wilkinson v. Downton</i> (1897), concerning liability in tort for the consequences of a practical joke that went disastrously, but unforeseeably, wrong, has always been taken to be correct, irreconcilable though it is with any known legal principle. And the House of Lords twice preferred his views to those of the Court of Appeal: in the case of <i>Compania de Mocambique v. B.S.A. Co.</i> (1893) and in the significant case of <i>Allen v. Flood</i> (1898), in which the legality of trade combination was at issue and where he was also in a minority among the Queen's Bench judges. He would have been better suited to the Court of Appeal, but there were few vacancies before his early death.<br>
<br>Wright married in 1891, only after reaching the bench. His wife, Merriel Mabel Emily Chermside, was the daughter of a clergyman, Richard Seymour Conway Chermside, prebendary of Salisbury, and sister of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32390/', "Herbert Charles Chermside")</script>. Of their two sons, one died in infancy; the other, Michael Robert (1901&#150;1976), followed his father to Balliol, and fulfilled a diplomatic career as British ambassador to Norway. Wright had bought a country estate, Headley Park, Hampshire, in the year of his marriage. The home farm at Headley was said to have been run as &#145;a small republic with [Wright] as permanent president. Seated under a tree, he would invite the opinion of his labourers, and decide upon the course to be pursued in greater or less accordance with the sentiments of the meeting&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>, 1912). On one occasion an employee who was guilty of dishonesty accepted a short term of imprisonment in an outhouse, as an alternative to prosecution.<br>
<br>Wright's radicalism made him resist knighthood for a long time, but he was finally knighted in 1891. He died on 13 August 1904 after surgery and several months' illness. He had asked that there should be no memorial, and was buried at Headley in a plain coffin which, at his request, was brought into the church in a luggage cart.<br>
