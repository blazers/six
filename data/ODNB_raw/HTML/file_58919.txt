<span class="headword">Howlett,  Robert</span>  (1830&#150;1858), <span class="occ">photographer</span>, was the son of the Revd Robert Howlett, Church of England clergyman, of Longham, Norfolk. He only comes to notice three years before his premature death in 1858; nothing is known of his mother, early life, education, or training. During his brief career he produced some of the most significant photographs of the period, most notably his portrait, <span class="italic">Isambard Kingdom Brunel and the Launching Chains of the Great Eastern</span>, made during the closing months of 1857.<br>
<br>Although he is known to have taken photographs as early as 1852, Howlett first came to notice working as a photographer for the Photographic Institution in New Bond Street, London. Established by Joseph Cundall and Phillip Delamotte in 1853, the Photographic Institution quickly became the leading establishment for the commercial promotion of photography through exhibitions, publications, and commissions. It may be presumed that Howlett joined the company after Delamotte left to take up his appointment as professor of drawing at King's College, London.<br>
<br>1856&#151;the year in which Howlett is first mentioned in the photographic press&#151;was extremely busy for him: during the course of the year he sent prints to the annual exhibitions of photographic societies in London, Manchester, and Norwich. Among the work he submitted were two landscape studies, <span class="italic">In the Valley of the Mole, Mickleham</span> and <span class="italic">Box Hill, Surrey</span>, which are likely to have been taken the previous year. In the same year he undertook the first of a number of commissions for Queen Victoria and Prince Albert, who regularly called upon the services of the Photographic Institution. Apart from copying the works of Raphael for Prince Albert's comprehensive art historical study, Howlett also made a series of notable portraits of soldiers who had distinguished themselves during the Crimean War. These were exhibited the following year at the Photographic Society of London's annual exhibition under the title <span class="italic">Crimean Heroes</span> and are now frequently confused with the series taken by Joseph Cundall. Despite the ascendancy of photography there were growing fears about the stability and permanence of prints, many of which were showing signs of premature fading. It is within this context that Howlett published <span class="italic">On the various methods of printing photographic pictures upon paper with suggestions for their preservation</span> (1856).<br>
<br>In common with many other London establishments the Photographic Institution also operated a studio where Howlett made a significant number of portraits. Doubtless through Cundall's intimate connections within the world of publishing and fine art, a number of the most eminent artists of the day came to be photographed. Howlett's portraits of W. P. Frith, F. R. Pickersgill, J. C. Horsley, and Thomas Webster were among a larger group exhibited at the Art Treasures Exhibition in Manchester in 1857. It was Frith who commissioned Howlett to photograph crowd scenes at the 1856 Derby from the roof of a cab for use as preliminary studies for his 1858 painting <span class="italic">Derby Day</span>.<br>
<br>Howlett's most memorable series of photographs, and ones which are now regarded as epitomizing the spirit of Victorian engineering and endeavour, are those he made of the steamship the <i>Great Eastern</i>. The vessel was designed by Isambard Kingdom Brunel and built by Messrs Scott, Russell &amp; Co. at Millwall, on the banks of the Thames. The single largest engineering enterprise of the period, its protracted launch nearly defeated everyone involved, including Brunel, whose posture, gaze, and muddied clothes transmit the sense of difficulty and impending failure in Howlett's portrait. Paradoxically, this portrait has since assumed iconic status, standing as it now does for all that was heroic and noble during the Victorian period.<br>
<br>Robert Howlett died, unmarried, of a fever on 2 December 1858 at his lodgings at 10 Bedford Place, Campden Hill, Kensington, London. It was thought by colleagues that his untimely death had been brought about by the fatal combination of overwork and his imprudent use of poisonous photographical chemicals.<br>
