<span class="headword">Blagden, Sir  Charles</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1748, <em>d.</em> 1820), <span class="occ">physician and secretary of the Royal Society</span>, was born at Wotton under Edge in Gloucestershire, where he was baptized on 19 April 1748, a younger son of John Blagden (1715&#150;1750) and Elizabeth Phelps (1716&#150;1784). His family was involved in various ways in the local textile industry. His early education is obscure but he studied medicine at the University of Edinburgh, and graduated MD in 1768.<br>
<br>Blagden was elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1772, entering a circle of young fellows that included Joseph Banks. In 1776 Blagden was appointed a surgeon in the army and served on the hospital ship HMS <i>Pigot</i> in the American War of Independence. Returning to England in 1780, he briefly held an army medical position in Plymouth but longed for the London scientific life. In late 1782 or early 1783 he became an assistant and amanuensis to Henry Cavendish (1731&#150;1810). This association lasted until 1789, coinciding with the most active phase of Blagden's own scientific career. Cavendish provided for Blagden's financial security with an annuity, and a bequest of &pound;15,000 in his will.<br>
<br>On 5 May 1784 Blagden was elected one of the secretaries of the Royal Society amid the dissensions which gripped that institution over the conduct of its autocratic president, Joseph Banks. Blagden was Banks's right-hand man and remained so until he relinquished the secretaryship in 1797. He finally abandoned the pursuit of a medical position in the early 1780s, on assurances that his career would be advanced in other ways. Dissatisfaction with the rate of that advancement created tension with Banks, but it seems to have been dispelled by the knighthood Blagden received in 1792.<br>
<br>Blagden's centrality in the scientific community was ensured by his closeness to Cavendish and to Banks, but also by his day-to-day control of the <span class="italic">Philosophical Transactions</span> and by his thorough knowledge of the European scientific scene, a knowledge made possible by his command of languages and extensive travel. Blagden visited the continent annually until the outbreak of the French Revolution and travelled in Germany, Italy, Switzerland, and France. He was elected a corresponding member of the Acad&eacute;mie des Sciences in 1789 and counted Antoine Lavoisier, P. S. de Laplace, Georges Cuvier, and especially Claude Louis Berthollet among his friends. When travel to the continent was again possible, Blagden spent considerable time in France with the distinguished scientific coterie known as the &#145;Soci&eacute;t&eacute; d'Arcueil&#146;, centred on Berthollet's residence outside Paris.<br>
<br>Most of Blagden's modest scientific output consisted of a dozen contributions to the <span class="italic">Philosophical Transactions</span> between 1775 and 1813. He also published papers in the <span class="italic">Annales de Chimie</span>. His first papers for the Royal Society reported experiments, conducted on himself, Banks, and other colleagues, in the tolerance of extreme air temperatures by humans. His most famous work, published in 1788, was his determination that salt lowers the freezing point of water in a simple inverse ratio, subsequently dubbed Blagden's law, even though his finding had been anticipated by Richard Watson in 1771.<br>
<br>Blagden's best known scientific involvement was in the &#145;water controversy&#146;, beginning in 1783, a contest involving the rival claims of Lavoisier, Cavendish, and James Watt to priority in the discovery of the compound nature of water. Ironically this controversy became more heated in the 1830s and 1840s, after the protagonists were dead, than it was at the time. Subsequent interpretations of Blagden's role have shaped his reputation. His involvement in the controversy was manifold: as Cavendish's assistant; as secretary of the Royal Society, with oversight of the publication of some of the papers in question; and as a scientific traveller, who carried news to Lavoisier and his circle in Paris. The most extreme charges suggest that Blagden falsified documents and otherwise tried to ensure his employer Cavendish's priority. These seem unwarranted, though Blagden was cavalier and presumptuous in his behaviour.<br>
<br>Dr Johnson found the gossipy Blagden a &#145;delightful fellow&#146;. Hannah More regarded him as modest, sensible, and knowing. Benjamin Thompson, Count Rumford, who successfully rivalled Blagden for the hand of the widowed Madame Lavoisier, and whose daughter, Sarah, Blagden once sought in marriage, had less flattering things to say about him. Blagden remained unmarried and childless. He died suddenly of apoplexy on 26 March 1820 at Arcueil, near Paris, the home of his friend Berthollet, and was buried in the cemetery of P&egrave;re Lachaise in Paris. His will (the estate was less than &pound;50,000) included bequests to his younger brother Richard, a nephew, nieces, and friends. The residuary legatee was his nephew Robert Hale Blagden Hale.<br>
