<span class="headword">Bowles,  Phineas</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1722), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was the only son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/66594/', "Phineas Bowles (1647&#150;1714)")</script> of the Chatham branch of the Bowles family. His father was a long-serving official at the Navy Board who briefly held the post of secretary to the navy (1689&#150;90); little is known of his mother, Katherine, or of his three sisters. He was commissioned an ensign in the Queen Dowager's regiment, later the 2nd (Queen's Royal) regiment, on 3 October 1688, in Captain Charles Wingfield's company, and was raised to lieutenant on 21 March 1689. In May 1689 the regiment was sent as part of the expedition to raise the siege of Londonderry under the command of its colonel, Major-General Kirke. Later that year it was charged with the defence of the entrenchments at Dundalk. George Story, in his <span class="italic">A True and Impartial History</span>, relates that, in December 1689, Bowles, along with two other lieutenants from Kirke's regiment, was court-martialled and shot for killing two ship's masters. However, there must have been some misapprehension, for Bowles was promoted captain-lieutenant on 12 February 1692. By then the regiment was in Flanders, having served through the wars in Ireland until shortly after the second siege of Limerick (1691). In 1693 Bowles's regiment was part of the reserve at Landen, where it suffered slight losses, and in 1695 it was present at the siege of Namur. In March 1696 it was ordered home for duty at the Tower of London following the discovery of a plot against King William, but it returned to Flanders in May before the conclusion of the war by the treaty of Ryswick (1697).<br>
<br>In the general reduction of regimental establishments which followed the peace it is likely that Bowles was himself disbanded&#151;for there is no record of him until 5 February 1705, when he was commissioned colonel of a regiment of foot (the late Colonel Caulfeild's regiment). Originally raised in Ireland in 1703, Bowles's regiment was embarked for Spain in 1705 with the expedition to Catalonia under the command of the earls of Peterborough and Galway; it took part in the siege and capture of Barcelona that September. In October 1706 Bowles was placed in command of a small force at the town of Elche, while the main column retired towards Alicante. On 21 October the French commander, Freville, appeared before the town with a force of 5500 men. Without artillery, Bowles held out for two days, but he was compelled to yield on the 23rd and was taken prisoner. However, his exchange must have been arranged speedily, for he is reported to have been present and in command of his regiment the following April (1707), when he was again forced to surrender at the bloody battle of Almanza.<br>
<br>Narcissus Luttrell reports that Bowles returned to England on parole on 18 September 1707. In December 1708 his regiment was in receipt of a large draft of prisoners to restore it to full strength. Luttrell also relates that, in April 1709, having rebuilt his regiment, Bowles was ordered to Plymouth to join Admiral Baker's squadron, &#145;supposed to recover our settlements in Newfoundland&#146;  (Luttrell, 6.427). This was more than likely a ruse, since Bowles's regiment returned to Spain and distinguished itself at the victory of Saragossa (August 1710).<br>
<br>Bowles was sent home with the captured French colours, and returned via Italy. However, he was left to pay his own expenses and memorialized the Treasury for recompense. In his absence his regiment was one of those British units surprised, surrounded, and eventually captured by superior French forces at Brihuega in December 1710. The regiment was finally disbanded in Ireland after the treaty of Utrecht in 1713.<br>
<br>On 12 February 1711 Bowles was raised to the rank of brigadier-general, a non-regimental commission. He remained unemployed until the Jacobite rising in 1715, when he was commissioned in July to raise a corps of cavalry, which became the 12th lancers (later the Prince of Wales's Royal regiment of lancers). Bowles was the regiment's first colonel. Quartered in Berkshire, Bowles's new regiment played little part in the suppression of the rebellion, although in October it escorted some Scottish prisoners to the Tower. Between 1716 and October 1718 it was stationed in the west country, after which it was embarked for Ireland and placed on the Irish establishment.<br>
<br>Bowles married Elizabeth Robinson in 1718. They had one daughter, Elizabeth, who was reported to be living, unmarried, in 1750. In March 1719 Bowles was transferred to the colonelcy of the 8th hussars and on 30 May 1720 was appointed quartermaster-general of Ireland. In May 1722 he was made controller of army accounts. He died intestate on 15 November 1722; administration was granted to his widow in May 1723.<br>
<br>Bowles was described as &#145;a warm hearted loyalist distinguished for his attachment to the House of Hanover, who had acquired a reputation at the head of a regiment of foot in the Wars of the Spanish Succession&#146;  (Cannon, 9&#150;10), but it is as the founder of the 12th lancers that he is chiefly remembered.<br>
<br>Bowles's cousin and namesake, <a name="cosubject_3071"></a><span class="headword">Phineas Bowles</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1690, <em>d.</em> 1749), <span class="occ">army officer and politician</span>, was the third son of Phineas Bowles (1664&#150;1718) of Loughbrough House, a partner in the family glass works at Southwark, and his wife, Margaret Dockwra (1665&#150;1740), whose family were London merchants&#151;another branch owned the Putteridge estate in Hertfordshire. Phineas was baptized at St Michael, Crooked Lane, London, on 24 January 1690. In March 1710 he was commissioned a captain in the 27th (Inniskilling) regiment of foot, which between October 1709 and November 1710 was quartered at Alicante before being sent to Minorca for garrison duty. The regiment remained there until 1717, but in 1713 Bowles transferred to the 3rd foot guards (later the Scots Guards), as captain and lieutenant-colonel. In 1715 he was reported to be employed in suppressing the Jacobite rising, and in March 1719 he succeeded his cousin as colonel of the 12th lancers, stationed in Ireland.<br>
<br>Bowles settled in Ireland for the remainder of his life. His marriage in 1724 to Alethea Maria (<i>d</i>. 1771), the daughter and heir of Samuel Hill, recently deceased, of Kilmainham, Dublin, brought with it a large Irish estate. Upon Alethea's marriage, portions of the estate were settled absolutely on Bowles and the rest was entailed strictly on the male issue of the marriage, an arrangement which was to cause much family argument and a long-running lawsuit after Bowles's death.<br>
<br>Between 1735 and 1741 Bowles was MP for Bewdly. He had been put in by his elder brother, William, who held a controlling interest. At a time when the Hanoverian succession was being relentlessly buttressed, Bowles's loyalty to the whig administration ensured rapid military promotion. In December 1735 he was raised to brigadier-general, and in 1739 he was promoted major-general and appointed governor of Limerick. In 1740 he was transferred to the colonelcy of the Carabiniers (later the 6th dragoon guards), and in 1745 he was raised to the rank of lieutenant-general and appointed governor of Londonderry and the Culmore forts.<br>
<br>Bowles lived at his town house in Dublin and his county seat, Beaulieu, near Drogheda, where he was falsely reported to have died in 1746. In fact he lived a further three years, and died in his sixtieth year at Bath on 22 October 1749. By his will of 11 September 1749 he left an estate valued at &pound;200,000.<br>
<br>Phineas and Alethea Maria Bowles had two sons, William Phineas and Richard, and a daughter, Anna Maria, who married Lieutenant-Colonel Nathaniel Haywood of the Coldstream Guards. William, the eldest, died unmarried a few years after his father, in 1760, leaving an illegitimate son. The younger son, Richard, then a captain in the Horse Guards, inherited the Irish estates but soon moved to Sayes Court, near Chertsey. For the rest of his life Richard was involved in litigation with his brother's son, a residuary legatee under the father's will, who claimed a portion of the Irish estate and only succeeded in establishing his claim after Richard's death in 1798.<br>
