<span class="headword">Bonville,  William</span>, first Baron Bonville  (1392&#150;1461), <span class="occ">administrator and landowner</span>, was probably born at Shute, near Axminster, Devon, the son of John Bonville (<i>d</i>. 1396) and his wife, Elizabeth Fitzroger (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1370, <i>d</i>. in or before 1421), and heir to both his father and grandfather, Sir William Bonville (<i>d</i>. 1408). He was married twice, first in 1414 to Margaret, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/11553/', "Reynold Grey, third Baron Grey of Ruthin")</script>, and second, by 1430, to Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1471), daughter of Edward Courtenay, eleventh earl of Devon, and widow of John, Lord Harington (<i>d</i>. 1418). Her tomb at Porlock, Somerset, survives. William Bonville's son and grandson were both killed in 1460, and his estates passed on his death to his infant granddaughter, Cicely, who later married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/11560/', "Thomas Grey, marquess of Dorset (d. 1501)")</script>.<br>
<br>Bonville's grandfather and namesake had been among the most prominent west-country gentry in the late fourteenth century, serving as MP for Devon and Somerset on ten and seven occasions respectively, and receiving a large number of local offices and commissions. He was a liveried retainer of the leading regional magnate, Edward Courtenay, earl of Devon, a close political and family bond that was destined to be violently sundered in the mid-fifteenth century.<br>
<br>The elder Sir William's two marriages, and that of his son, John, brought substantial property with them, and this, together with many purchases and inheritances, ensured that William, Lord Bonville, enjoyed one of the most valuable estates in the south-west, valued in 1435 at about &pound;900 net per annum&#151;a figure not far short of that enjoyed by the fifteenth-century earls of Devon themselves. Bonville's estates included outliers in many counties, but were concentrated in south-east Devon (where Shute was his principal seat) and mid-Somerset (including Chewton Mendip).<br>
<br>Bonville entered most of his estates in 1414 (their keeping during his minority having been entrusted to Edward, duke of York) and cut his teeth in military service in 1415 under Henry V's brother, Thomas, duke of Clarence, one of whose executors he became. He was active in west-country administration from the early 1420s. While his extensive and complex inheritances led to some violent disputes with neighbours during these years, these were on nothing like the scale of disorder that was to characterize Bonville's notorious conflict with the Courtenays during the 1440s and 1450s.<br>
<br>This power struggle was triggered by the appointment of Bonville in 1437 as royal steward in Cornwall for life. This was seen by the young <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/50218/', "Thomas Courtenay, thirteenth earl of Devon")</script>, recently come of age and in possession of a severely reduced inheritance, as a serious challenge to his own regional authority. The bitterness of the strife that grew from this was symptomatic of a change in the local balance of power and wealth that had over a generation tilted against the Courtenay earls (the traditional leaders of west-country society) in favour of a small group of powerful gentry among whom Bonville was pre-eminent.<br>
<br>Violence reached an alarming level during the summers of 1439 and 1440, and the situation was worsened by a serious blunder on the part of the government&#151;the appointment of the earl to the stewardship of the duchy of Cornwall, a post so similar to that held by Bonville as to be hardly distinguishable from it. Urgent attempts at even-handedness and arbitration failed, and the dispute was only temporarily resolved by the appointment of Bonville as seneschal of Gascony in December 1442, thereby removing him temporarily from the scene (he sailed from Plymouth in March 1443 but was back in Devon by April 1445). Even though the government, coming increasingly under the influence of the duke of Suffolk, was careful not to antagonize the earl of Devon, the latter was clearly seen to be the principal culprit. Bonville's connection with Suffolk grew stronger. He was a member of Suffolk's entourage at Margaret of Anjou's betrothal ceremonies at Rouen in May 1444, and married his daughter Elizabeth to one of Suffolk's henchmen, Sir William Tailboys. This development culminated in the parliament of 1449, when Bonville was raised to the peerage as Baron Bonville of Chewton.<br>
<br>Antagonisms hardened after the fall of Suffolk in 1450. The earl of Devon attached himself to the duke of York, and felt confident enough in the summer of 1451 to risk an encounter in the field with Bonville (and his ally, James Butler, earl of Wiltshire). Despite much plunder and violence, a major showdown was avoided when York's unexpected arrival in the west country persuaded the earl of Devon to lift the siege of Taunton Castle, which Bonville had made his headquarters. Although temporarily imprisoned (as were Devon and the other principal malcontents), Bonville was soon able to exploit the dramatically changed political situation that followed the humiliating submission of York and Devon to the king at Dartford on 3 March 1452.<br>
<br>Between 1452 and 1455 Bonville became the dominant force in west-country politics. It was he who was made responsible for bringing Devon and his adherents to justice, and the king personally reinforced his position by staying at Bonville's house at Shute on his progress through the west country in the summer of 1452. Bonville was confirmed as steward of the duchy of Cornwall in 1452 (the post that had triggered the violence in 1439), and appointed constable of Exeter Castle in 1453, both posts to be held for life. He was active at sea as well as on land&#151;he had been appointed again as seneschal of Gascony in September 1453 but did not take up the post&#151;and his maritime activities were energetic enough to bring forth complaints of piracy from the duke of Burgundy.<br>
<br>These partisan appointments of Bonville to positions within the earl of Devon's traditional zone of influence forced the earl to take increasingly desperate measures, especially as the marriage of Bonville's grandson about 1455 to Katherine, a daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/19954/', "Richard Neville, earl of Salisbury")</script>, further entrenched him within the dominant Yorkist circle. On 23 October 1455 Devon's son and other retainers murdered Nicholas Radford, one of Bonville's senior councillors, and embarked on a campaign of violence which this time did culminate in battle, at Clyst on 13 December. Bonville fared the worse but escaped; after a short period of incarceration Courtenay resumed his campaign of violence against Bonville which lasted well into 1456.<br>
<br>While the level of local violence appears to have abated thereafter, the enmities that had grown over more than twenty years proved irresolvable. The death in 1458 of Bonville's old adversary afforded him little comfort. The new earl of Devon&#151;another Thomas Courtenay, the killer of Radford&#151;quickly gained favour with Queen Margaret, and this presented enormous risks for Bonville and his family. Bonville was probably present at the parliament of 1460 that recognized York's right of succession to the throne, and both his son and grandson were caught up with York's ill-judged march north and perished at the battle of Wakefield on 31 December 1460. Bonville himself, while consolidating his west-country alliances, remained about the court. Aged nearly seventy, he, with Sir Thomas Kyriell, was given custody of the king's person when the Yorkist forces under the earl of Warwick met those of the Lancastrians at the second battle of St Albans on 17 February 1461. The Yorkists were defeated and the king's guardians were captured. The earl of Devon had been present, too, and at his and the queen's instigation, two days after the battle, a mock trial was held before the young prince of Wales, and on 19 February 1461 Bonville and Kyriell were executed.<br>
