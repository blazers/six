<span class="headword">Young, Sir  George</span>, third baronet  (1837&#150;1930), <span class="occ">civil servant</span>, was born at Formosa Place, Cookham, Berkshire, on 15 September 1837, the eldest of the five sons of Sir George Young, second baronet (1797&#150;1848), and his wife, Susan (1804/5&#150;1895), daughter of William Mackworth Praed, serjeant-at-law. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/37081/', "William Mackworth Young")</script> was his younger brother. The family had a strong naval tradition. His great-grandfather Sir George Young was an admiral; his grandfather Sir Samuel Young FRS, the first baronet, began his career in the navy, and his father rose to the rank of captain before his retirement from the service.<br>
<br>Young, who succeeded his father to the baronetcy in February 1848 at the age of ten, was educated at Eton College, where he won the Newcastle medal in 1855. In the following year he entered Trinity College, Cambridge, where he regarded the second classes which he obtained in the classical and mathematical triposes (1859) as a setback to his fellowship ambitions. After a period of intense self-analysis, he set about a course of reading in preparation for the fellowship examinations. He remained at Cambridge for a further three years, being elected president of the Cambridge Union in 1860, studying classics and philosophy. In 1861 he gained the Le Bas prize for an essay on the history of Greek literature in England, which was published in 1862, the year of his third and successful attempt at a Trinity fellowship, an outcome which illustrated his remarkable tenacity of purpose. At Eton and Cambridge, A. C. Swinburne, G. O. Trevelyan, Henry Jackson, Henry Sidgwick, Richard Jebb, Edward Bowen, and Leslie Stephen were among his friends. His enthusiasms and outlook were those of the Liberal intelligentsia of the 1860s. With the Sidgwick brothers he was one of the founders in 1864 of the Ad Eundem Club, which brought together reform-minded graduates of Oxford and Cambridge, was later a member of the Radical Club, and, in 1876, was organizer with James Bryce of the Eastern Question Association, which attacked the Disraeli government's handling of the Bulgarian crisis. He supported the campaign for repealing religious tests at the ancient universities, writing a pamphlet on the question in 1868, and contributed an article, &#145;The House of Commons in 1833&#146;, to the academic reformers' manifesto, <span class="italic">Essays on Reform</span> (1867). He shared Stephen's strenuous athleticism and was an intrepid alpinist until, in 1866, he and two of his brothers attempted to climb Mont Blanc without a guide. One of his brothers was killed and Young never climbed there again.<br>
<br>Young was called to the bar by Lincoln's Inn in 1864 but never practised at the law. He unsuccessfully stood for parliament as Liberal candidate for Chippenham in November 1868. Like many of his university contemporaries he was given official employment by the Gladstone administration. In April 1870 he was named, along with Charles Mitchell and W. E. Frere, one of three royal commissioners to inquire into the conditions of indentured Chinese and Indian labourers, who had been brought in to work the sugar plantations of British Guiana after the abolition of slavery. During the commission's investigations Young took part in an exploratory expedition to the recently discovered Kaieteur Falls on the Potaro River. The commission's report of February 1871 recommended changes to the system of indentured labour, and Young was given the task of drafting a new immigration ordinance, which marked the beginning of a series of reforms.<br>
<br>On his return to England, Young married (10 October 1871) Alice Eacy (1840&#150;1922), &#145;a beautiful, witty, and most lovable woman&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>), the daughter of Evory Kennedy, a distinguished Dublin physician, and widow of Sir Alexander Hutchinson Lawrence, bt. They had three sons and a daughter, Eacy, who died in childhood. In the summer of 1871 he became one of six assistant commissioners employed by the royal commission on friendly societies, and two years later completed a survey of voluntary self-help institutions in the southern and eastern counties of England. After another unsuccessful attempt to enter parliament, standing for Plymouth in February 1874 (he was defeated twice more in that constituency, in April and June 1880), he was secretary to the royal commission on the Factory and Workshops acts (1875&#150;6), a prelude to his major work as secretary to the Bessborough commission on the working of the 1870 <span class="roman">Irish Land Act</span>, set up by the second Gladstone administration in June 1880. He was responsible for drafting the commission's report, published in 1881, which made radical proposals for increasing the rights of tenants in Ireland. In 1882 Lord Frederick Cavendish, the chief secretary for Ireland, invited him to become his private secretary; Young's telegram of acceptance was in Cavendish's pocket when he and T. H. Burke were murdered in Phoenix Park, Dublin.<br>
<br>Later in 1882 Young was appointed by Gladstone, initially on a temporary basis, as a charity commissioner responsible for carrying out the reorganization of educational charities provided for under the <span class="roman">Endowed Schools Acts</span>. After careful investigation, the commissioners set about redistributing the endowments in each area of the country to provide for different grades of secondary schools. Some radicals attacked the commissioners for diverting endowments away from the education of the poor. After Joseph Chamberlain and Jesse Collings denounced the commissioners' scheme for Alderman Dauntsey's charity in West Lavington, Wiltshire, as a misappropriation of funds intended for the benefit of agricultural labourers, Young defended their policy before a parliamentary select committee in 1886. He later claimed that none of the schemes for which he had charge was ever overturned or altered on a point of law; but his belief in his own integrity and the rightness of his decisions, combined with a certain patrician confidence, &#145;made him a difficult colleague and an uncompromising adversary&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>). He has, however, been shown in a more favourable light for his effective work in ensuring that a portion of charitable endowments was used for the benefit of girls' schools. He was also a supporter of the movement for women's higher education in Cambridge, favouring the admission of women to degrees. From 1875 he was a member of the council of University College, London (and president, 1881&#150;6), taking a prominent part in the Association for Promoting a Teaching University for London.<br>
<br>Young's position on the Charity Commission was made permanent, and in 1903 he was made chief charity commissioner for England and Wales. He retired in 1906. During his civil service career he found recreation in literature. In 1888 he published an edition of the poetry of his uncle, Winthrop Mackworth Praed. He was admired for his skill as a translator of verse; he produced <span class="italic">The Dramas of Sophocles Rendered in English Verse, Dramatic and Lyric</span> (1888) and <span class="italic">Poems from Victor Hugo in English Verse</span> (1901). He enjoyed a vigorous retirement, remaining active in local government in Berkshire, where he promoted the charter for Reading University. In his nineties he published <span class="italic">An English Prosody</span> (1928) and <span class="italic">Homer and the Greek Accents</span> (1930). A tall, bearded figure, with an impressive appearance and &#145;a somewhat formidable manner&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 5 July 1930), given to making his strong opinions known, he was the last survivor of the mid-Victorian academic Liberals. In his ninety-second year he wrote to <span class="italic">The Times</span> to correct a premature announcement of his death. Young died at Formosa Fishery, Cookham, Berkshire, on 4 July 1930. He was succeeded as baronet by his eldest son, George (1872&#150;1952), who held diplomatic and other government positions, and was a Labour parliamentary candidate; the younger sons were <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/37073/', "Geoffrey Winthrop Young")</script>, the educationist, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/37071/', "(Edward) Hilton Young, first Baron Kennet")</script>, the politician and writer.<br>
