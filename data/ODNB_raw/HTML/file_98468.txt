<span class="headword">Fraser,  Patrick  Allan-</span>  (1813&#150;1890), <span class="occ">artist and architect</span>, was born at Arbroath, Forfarshire, the third and youngest son of Robert Allan, a stocking manufacturer, and his wife, Isabel Macdonald. Both his parents were from established trade families in the town. After education at Arbroath Academy, Allan eschewed his father's wish that he enter the legal practice of his uncle, John Macdonald, and declared that he would become an artist. He was promptly apprenticed to another uncle, Alexander Macdonald, a high-class painter and interior decorator. Encouraged by his uncle, Allan began to paint portraits of local figures and dignitaries in the area. On completing his apprenticeship Allan enrolled as a student at the Trustees' Academy, Edinburgh. Here he began a friendship with the painter Robert Scott Lauder, which continued when Allan joined Lauder at the British Academy of Art in Rome in 1836 to continue his studies. The contrast between the two artists soon began to show. Lauder, newly married and with greater financial responsibilities, did not have the freedom or ability to exploit the social opportunities provided by the city's expatriate community. While Lauder painted a number of portraits and worked on his epic painting <span class="italic">The Trial of Effie Deans</span>, Allan painted views of Rome to support himself and took advantage of the city's visitors and patrons, notably the naturalist Walter Trevelyan of Wallington, Northumberland, then resident with his wife, Paulina, for a three-year honeymoon.<br>
<br>After returning to Britain in 1840, Allan set up a studio at 11 Seymour Street, Euston Square, London, and travelled frequently to Paris to study at the Louvre and to undertake a lucrative series of paintings for tourists and collectors. He also began to show his historical paintings&#151;largely depicting scenes from the novels of Sir Walter Scott&#151;in London and Edinburgh. It was during this period that the artist William Powell Frith encountered Allan in the Louvre. Writing of the meeting in his autobiography, Frith told of how he introduced Allan to his fellow students at the Royal Academy Schools, and invited him to become part of their recently formed sketching club, the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/64214', "Clique")</script>, then one of the country's first informal artists' groups. Through his participation with the Clique, Allan extended his contacts&#151;notably via the painter Augustus Egg&#151;with those proposing the creation of a philanthropic society for needy artists and writers, which led in 1850 to the founding of the Guild of Literature and Art by Charles Dickens and Sir Edward Bulwer-Lytton.<br>
<br>In 1841 Cadell, the Edinburgh publishers of Scott's <span class="roman">Waverley</span> novels, offered Allan a text of his choice to illustrate for the planned deluxe edition of 1843. Allan chose <span class="italic">The Antiquary</span> and, though the commission was not completed, he returned to Arbroath and to Hospitalfield House&#151;the model for Monkbarns, the home of Jonathan Oldbuck, the antiquary of the novel. It is not known whether Allan had previously met Elizabeth Fraser-Baker (1805&#150;1873), heir to the Hospitalfield estate, but the development of a strong relationship resulted in their marriage on 13 September 1843 at Arbroath. Elizabeth had previously been married to Lieutenant Arthur Baker of the 3rd light dragoons, who had disappeared after failing to inherit the Fraser family estates, and who later died at Dover in mysterious circumstances. As a result of evident irregularities in the management of the Hospitalfield estate&#151;notably the erosion of shoreland following the removal of rocks for the construction of a railway track&#151;Allan sued for damages, settling out of court for several thousand pounds against the Dundee and Arbroath Railway Company; the company's secretary was John Macdonald, clerk to the Fraser family trustees and Allan's uncle. In 1851 Patrick added the name Fraser, by royal licence, and was known thereafter as Patrick Allan-Fraser; he also assumed the arms of the Frasers of Hospitalfield.<br>
<br>After this hard-won beginning came the task of reviving the family's fortunes, which had fallen into neglect after the death of Elizabeth's father, Major John Fraser. Land was added to the Hospitalfield estate and new properties were acquired in Perthshire at Blackcraig (1847), Glenkilrie (1853), and Coldrach (1854). The poverty and living conditions in this area drew Allan-Fraser's attention to the possibility of land improvement and he attempted a sustainable economic model for the uplands consisting of small crofts or holdings interspersed by large areas of stone and heather moor. A programme of trenching, draining, and the creation of up to 20 miles of dykes converted 150 acres of land to arable farming and 200 acres to forest. The home estates of Hospitalfield and Kirkton were also extensively reworked and the county farmers were rallied to form an &#145;analytical association&#146;, of which Allan-Fraser was the first president, to research and report on the improvement of farm yields.<br>
<br>Plans for remodelling the house at Hospitalfield began in 1849 and focused initially on the old barn (dating from 1325) which now became the picture gallery. Allan-Fraser intended the gallery to contain works personally commissioned from friends and acquaintances, including (in 1858) a series of self-portraits by former Clique painters&#151;among them Frith, Egg, John Phillip, Matthew Ward, Henry Nelson O'Neil, and Henry Lejeune&#151;as well as works by a younger generation of artists including John Pettie and John MacWhirter. Over the next four decades, and almost entirely with his own workforce, Allan-Fraser undertook a programme of building at Hospitalfield and Blackcraig Castle on his highland shooting estate at Strathardle. During this time he developed a system and approach to construction that prefigured the Scottish arts and crafts movement, especially in its use of local materials (notably gathered fieldstone for Blackcraig Castle and his own estate-quarried sandstone for Hospitalfield) and the involvement of craftsmen in the designs for wood and stone carving. A succession of wood carvers at Hospitalfield, beginning with John Hutchison (1833&#150;1910), kept the trade alive between its mid-century decline and re-emergence with the revival of craft practices in the 1890s. The remodelling of the drawing room included David Maver's remarkable ceiling decoration (1883&#150;8) which, comprising 197 highly detailed wood carvings set into a coffered cedar framework, provided an inventory of the estate's flora and fauna. The room itself was designed around two newly acquired arboreal Flemish tapestries that echoed Lovell's green room dream sequence in <span class="italic">The Antiquary</span>. As a whole, Allan-Fraser's gradual reworking of Hospitalfield between 1850 and 1890 provides a survey of changing taste: from the heavier historical prototypes of Scott's romanticism to a freer, lighter expression of materials and imagery relating to the site's natural history.<br>
<br>Alongside his redesigning of Hospitalfield, Allan-Fraser spoke publicly about his views on good and bad building practices. In his lecture &#145;Architecture, with special reference to local buildings&#146; (summarized in the <span class="italic">Building Chronicle</span>, 4 May 1854) he identified &#145;usefulness&#146; as the &#145;one great principle&#146; of &#145;ancient&#146; buildings and lamented its absence in such modern buildings as the Arbroath and Dundee infirmaries. With his emphasis on the need for function over style, and his awareness that form changes according to society's needs and technology develops to serve utility, Allan-Fraser provided an early formulation of the view&#151;subsequently proposed by pioneering modernists like Charles Rennie Mackintosh&#151;that structural function was central to a building's plan and design. Allan-Fraser's support for struggling artists also drew him to criticize perceived social inequalities, and other published lectures at Arbroath included a consideration of factors that &#145;retard the moral and intellectual progress of the working class&#146;. In 1861 he published his voluminous <span class="italic">An Unpopular View of Our Times, being the result of a free enquiry into the existing sources of demoralisation</span>&#151;a rambling survey of current values and a call for a return to &#145;individual obedience and individual responsibility&#146;. He returned to this theme with <span class="italic">Christianity and Churchism</span> (2nd edn, 1884) in which he denigrated formal religious worship and leadership as hypocritical and advocated a strict personal observance of the gospels as the guiding principle for a moral and healthy society. Despite these unorthodox opinions Allan-Fraser was not ignored by the artistic establishment. In 1871 he was elected an honorary member of the Royal Scottish Academy in recognition of his encouragement of the visual arts in Scotland. The Allan-Frasers also supported the training and career of the operatic tenor Durward Lely (1852&#150;1944; born James Dorward Lyall), the son of Allan-Fraser's stonemason, who became a celebrity as Gilbert and Sullivan's leading tenor, and later the touring partner of the Spanish-born singer Adelina Patti.<br>
<br>In 1853 the death of Allan-Fraser's mother-in-law had brought him further property in and around her family's residence at Hawkesbury Hall, Warwickshire. The burden of management fell heavily on Allan-Fraser who sought to spend more of his time on architectural projects. His attempt to donate Hawkesbury to the Guild of Literature and Art&#151;an idea encouraged by Augustus Egg from 1854&#151;failed when Dickens refused to give assurances not to sell the house. Egg's contribution to the paintings for Hospitalfield by Clique members, <span class="italic">Self Portrait as a Poor Author</span> (1858), depicted the artist's performance as the destitute author, David Fallen, in Bulwer-Lytton's play, <span class="italic">Not So Bad as We Seem</span>, which had first been performed in 1851 to raise funds for the guild.<br>
<br>The death of his wife on 24 November 1873 led Allan-Fraser to plan and direct construction of the remarkable Fraser of Hospitalfield memorial chapel in Arbroath's western cemetery. Intended as a monument to his wife's family, and as a mausoleum, Allan-Fraser's neo-Gothic structure was gifted by him to Arbroath town council as a non-denominational mortuary chapel. Despite undertaking this celebrated work, Allan-Fraser was deeply affected by Elizabeth's death and his friends noticed a withdrawal from society. In 1874 he was elected president of the British Academy of Art in Rome, and set a new challenge of reviving the fortunes of the academy he had attended with Robert Scott Lauder in the 1830s. He remained president until his death, during which time he oversaw the academy's move to new, more practical, premises and provided a &pound;3000 endowment for its security. Since 1869 Allan-Fraser had been planning his own institute at Hospitalfield for talented, impecunious young artists, and in 1873 he established a trust for &#145;the advancement of Art and the support and benefit of Professional men&#146;  (Hay, 1). In the following year Allan-Fraser persuaded the dying American sculptor William Rinehart to follow his example and establish a school for artists; this became the Rinehart School for Sculpture, now part of the Maryland Institute College of Art, Baltimore.<br>
<br>On 13 October 1886, shortly after the completion of the memorial chapel, Allan-Fraser was honoured with the freedom of Arbroath. In failing health, and with no direct heirs from his marriage, he began to plan for his own art school, ordering casts to be sent from Rome, and making provision for the new studio building on his estate. Allan-Fraser died at Hospitalfield on 17 September 1890, and was interred beside his wife on 22 September. The Patrick Allan-Fraser of Hospitalfield Trust was activated on his death and continues into the twenty-first century at Hospitalfield House. Since 1890 it has played a major role in nurturing successive generations of Scottish visual artists, counting among its alumni members of national academies, lecturers, and teachers who have helped create the reputation of Scottish art that is enjoyed today, and for which the trust acts as an ambassador for an increasingly international programme.<br>
