<span class="headword">Fairfield,  (Josephine) Letitia Denny</span>  (1885&#150;1978), <span class="occ">public health physician and campaigner for social reform</span>, was born on 10 March 1885 at 26 Acland Street, St Kilda, Melbourne, Australia, the eldest of three daughters of Charles Fairfield (<i>c</i>.1842&#150;1906), journalist, and his wife, Isabella Campbell Mackenzie (<i>c</i>.1853&#150;1921), daughter of Alexander Mackenzie and his wife, Jessie Watson Campbell. Her father was of Irish descent and her mother's parents both came from Edinburgh families, but they married in Australia where Charles Fairfield worked as a journalist on the Melbourne <span class="italic">Argus</span>. Letitia Fairfield's family moved to Britain when she was about three years old, living first in Glasgow and then, later, in various parts, including in and around London. In 1892 her younger sister, Cicily Isabel (1892&#150;1983), was born: the sister who was to become well known as the journalist and novelist Rebecca West [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/31819/', "Andrews, Dame Cicily Isabel")</script>].<br>
<br>Faced with deteriorating financial circumstances related to Charles Fairfield's frequent changes of job, the family then moved to Richmond, Surrey, where from 1896 Letitia Fairfield attended Richmond High School for Girls. When her father left permanently in 1901, her mother took her three daughters to live in Edinburgh. After a year at George Watson's Ladies' College she entered the Edinburgh Medical College for Women, then an extramural school for the University of Edinburgh; this was a step made possible only by the award of one of the first Carnegie scholarships and the gift of &pound;100 from an aunt.<br>
<br>Fairfield graduated MB ChB from the University of Edinburgh in 1907, with honours in all subjects and with several medals. Over the next four years she gained clinical experience through a series of temporary hospital posts as house officer or equivalent, including seven months at Birmingham City Asylum and, in 1908, nine months at the Manchester Victoria Memorial Jewish Hospital, where she learned enough Yiddish to talk to her patients. Fairfield was awarded her MD degree from the University of Edinburgh in 1911. In that year she returned to London with her mother and her two sisters, and took a house in Hampstead Garden Suburb.<br>
<br>Fairfield now began her work in public health for the London county council (LCC) which was to continue, apart from wartime interruptions, until 1948. After several part-time posts in the LCC's newly reorganized school medical service, she was appointed, in 1912, as a full-time medical assistant in the public health department, the same year that she passed her diploma in public health from the University of London. She was to become the first woman senior medical officer at the LCC. Before the First World War, her main responsibilities there were concerned with the health and welfare of schoolchildren, including the inspection of schools for those with physical or mental handicaps and of teacher training colleges. She retained a particular involvement with the care and education of children with epilepsy throughout her career.<br>
<br>At the outbreak of war in 1914 Fairfield was one of a group of women doctors who offered their services to the War Office, only to be told that the war could be won without them. However, in 1917 she became a medical officer to the new Women's Army Auxiliary Corps, serving as medical controller for southern command. She was then appointed, in June 1918, as chief medical officer to the new Women's Royal Air Force with responsibility for the medical care of 8000 women in military quarters and a further 22,000 living at home. Fairfield was active in the internal battle that medical women in the armed services waged, with only limited success, with the War Office to be appointed on comparable terms to men, including full rather than honorary commissions. In 1919 she was created CBE in recognition of her war service.<br>
<br>In 1920 Fairfield returned to the LCC. Although involved in a broad range of public health activities, her work in relation to children and women's health was to be particularly important. When, following the 1929 <span class="roman">Local Government Act</span>, the LCC took responsibility for London's poor-law board hospitals, improving them especially in relation to maternity and obstetric care was one of her major concerns. Medico-legal matters were another professional interest, Fairfield having been called to the bar at the Middle Temple, London, in 1923. She was co-editor of the <span class="italic">Medico-Legal and Criminological Review</span> for some years, and president of the Medico-Legal Society in 1957 and 1958. In 1940 her administrative expertise was again sought by the War Office, where she became the senior woman doctor (with the now fully commissioned rank of lieutenant-colonel) and assistant director-general for medical services. In 1942, having reached the compulsory retirement age for the army, she returned to the LCC, where she continued to work until the inception of the National Health Service in July 1948. She published a number of professional articles on public health matters, and short books, including one on epilepsy in 1954.<br>
<br>Before, during, and after her distinguished career as a medical administrator, Fairfield was actively involved in many contemporary social controversies. As a medical student and young doctor she threw herself wholeheartedly into the campaign for women's suffrage, including addressing many public meetings. Her blonde good looks caught the attention of her audiences and, with her confident voice, she could dominate the roughest open-air meetings. She joined the militant suffragette Women's Social and Political Union for a time but soon became critical of Christabel Pankhurst's authoritarianism. After moving to London she joined the Fabian Society, and spoke in public and wrote regularly on women's and health issues. She also developed a strong commitment to the cause of Irish independence. In 1922 Fairfield became a Roman Catholic. During the 1920s she was a prominent opponent of birth control, though she later modified her views following a visit to Malta, where problems ensuing from a high birth-rate and poverty were all too apparent. For many years she was a regular contributor to the Catholic press on matters such as medical evidence for miracle cures, the supernatural, and exorcism. In later life she became an expert on witchcraft. In 1965 she was awarded the papal medal, <i>Pro ecclesia et pontifice</i>. Before and during the Second World War she helped many refugees from the Nazi regime in Germany settle in Britain.<br>
<br>&#145;A delightful, vigorous, dogmatic, and at times infuriating companion&#146;  (<span class="italic">BMJ</span>, 873), Fairfield was much loved by colleagues and family. Her interest in children was not just professional and she spent much time entertaining her nieces and nephews. As eldest sister and with respect to appearance, she was the model for the character of Cordelia in Rebecca West's loosely autobiographical, best-selling novel <span class="italic">The Fountain Overflows</span> (1957), but the unsympathetic personality portrayed there was fictional. The relationship between the two sisters, however, was sometimes strained, particularly in later life.<br>
<br>Fairfield died on 1 February 1978 at St Mary Abbots Hospital, London, having been ill for fifteen months following a stroke.<br>
