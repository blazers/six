<span class="headword">Thorne, Sir  Richard Thorne</span>  (1841&#150;1899), <span class="occ">physician and public health officer</span>, was the second son of Thomas Henry Thorne, banker, and his wife, Joanna Hughes, of Bath Street, Leamington Spa, Warwickshire, where he was born on 13 October 1841. He was sent to school first at Nieuwied in Rhenish Prussia and then moved to France at the age of fourteen, to attend, after a year's schooling there, the <i>cours de troisi&egrave;me</i> at the Lyc&eacute;e St Louis, Paris, where he gained two first prizes. He then returned to England and became a pupil at Mill Hill School, from which he matriculated at London University. He began his medical studies as an apprentice to a medical practitioner in Leamington Spa, and afterwards entered as a student at St Bartholomew's Hospital, London. In 1863 he was admitted a member of the Royal College of Surgeons, London, and served as a midwifery assistant at St Bartholomew's Hospital. In 1865 he became a licentiate of the Royal College of Physicians of London, and in the following year he graduated MB at London University, with first-class honours in medicine and obstetric medicine. He married on 5 April 1866 Martha, daughter of Joseph Rylands, a merchant of Sutton Grange, Hull; they were to have three sons and a daughter.<br>
<br>From 1864 to 1866 Thorne worked as junior resident medical officer at the Sussex House Asylum, Hammersmith, London, and in 1867 he was elected assistant physician to the general dispensary in Bartholomew Close in the City, a post he resigned in the following year, when he was appointed physician to the Hospital for Diseases of the Chest in the City Road. From 1869 to 1871 he was assistant physician to the London Fever Hospital. He was chosen to be demonstrator of microscopic anatomy in the medical school of St Bartholomew's Hospital in 1869, and from April 1870 he was casualty physician to the hospital.<br>
<br>Thorne entered the field in which he was to become known best, on being employed as a supernumerary inspector in the medical department of the privy council in 1868. In this capacity he conducted several investigations into outbreaks of typhoid fever, helping to establish that the fever could be spread by an infected water supply, and demonstrating the value of isolation hospitals. Thorne showed such marked ability that in February 1871 he was appointed a permanent inspector. After the privy council department was merged with the London government board, he rose gradually from this position until in 1892 he succeeded to the post of principal medical officer to the Local Government Board on the retirement of Sir George Buchanan. As medical officer Thorne persuaded the board to institute a national cholera survey in 1892, which awakened local authorities to the threat of the disease and which became a valuable index of the sanitary state of the country. He continually emphasized the need for higher standards of cleanliness and secured some important sanitary measures. Under his direction the board was highly successful in preventing a cholera outbreak in Britain during the continental epidemic of 1894&#150;5. Thorne was a major influence in the decision to abandon quarantine in Britain, and to replace it with port inspections.<br>
<br>Thorne's knowledge of French and German, no less than his polished manners and courtly address, and his experience in collating information from foreign sources, soon made him especially acceptable to his political chiefs. He was repeatedly selected to represent Britain in matters of international hygiene. He was the British delegate at the International Conference on Cholera Prevention held at Rome in 1885, at Venice (Paris sitting) in 1892, at Dresden in 1893, at Paris in 1894, and at Venice in 1897; and he signed the conventions of Dresden in 1893, Paris in 1894, and Venice in 1897, the last being largely drawn up under his guidance. He had a difficult role in persuading other countries of the effectiveness of the British system of inspection, which replaced the quarantines imposed in other countries. His services were recognized by the government, which increased his salary on the recommendation of a special committee in 1898.<br>
<br>At the Royal College of Physicians of London Thorne was admitted a member in 1867, and was elected a fellow in 1875; he acted as an examiner from 1885 to 1889, and was a member of council from 1894 to 1896. In 1891 he delivered the Milroy lectures, &#145;Diphtheria: its natural history and prevention&#146;. These lectures, later published, utilized board data to show that diphtheria mortality was unaffected by sanitary improvements. Thorne began to lecture on hygiene at the medical school of St Bartholomew's Hospital in 1879, and he was formally appointed there as the first permanent lecturer on public health in 1891. He was elected FRS on 5 June 1890 and was awarded the Stewart prize of the British Medical Association in 1893. In 1895 he succeeded Sir John Simon as crown nominee at the General Medical Council, and in 1898 honorary degrees were conferred upon him by the University of Edinburgh, the Royal University of Ireland, and the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland. His services to public health were recognized by his selection as an honorary member of the Royal Academy of Medicine at Rome, a corresponding member of the Royal Italian Society of Hygiene, and a foreign associate of the Society of Hygiene of France. He was president of the Epidemiological Society from 1887 to 1889, and in 1898 he delivered the Harben lectures, &#145;On the administrative control of tuberculosis&#146;. He was a member of the royal commissions on tuberculosis in 1896, and on sewage disposal in 1898. He was made CB in 1892, and KCB in 1897. He died at his home at 45 Inverness Terrace, Hyde Park, London, on 18 December 1899, and was buried at St John's, Woking.<br>
<br>Thorne ranked as one of the foremost exponents of the science of public health, both in Britain and elsewhere, and he worthily filled the position occupied in succession by Sir Edwin Chadwick, Sir John Simon, and Sir George Buchanan. He became well known for his research on sanitary issues, particularly concerning diphtheria and typhoid fever. He showed a remarkable ability in integrating such knowledge into practical sanitary administration, as seen in the board's &#145;model&#146; by-laws. Throughout Europe his name became inseparably connected with attempts to abolish the expensive and tedious methods of quarantine in favour of a higher standard of cleanliness combined with the early and efficient notification of individual cases of epidemic disease. Almost the whole of Thorne's work is recorded in the form of reports in the blue books of the medical department of the privy council and the Local Government Board. Munk considered that &#145;He represented the ideal type of official&#151;painstaking, firm, progressive, and open-minded&#146;  (Munk, <span class="italic">Roll</span>).<br>
