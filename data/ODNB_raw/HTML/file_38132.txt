<span class="headword">Williams,  (Owen) Alfred</span>  (1877&#150;1930), <span class="occ">poet and writer on rural and industrial life</span>, was born in South Marston, near Swindon, Wiltshire, the fifth of eight surviving children and the youngest of four sons of Elias Lloyd Williams (1849&#150;1899), a decorative woodworker from Conwy, Wales, and his wife, Elizabeth (1850&#150;1917), daughter of Joshua Hughes, tanner and smallholder of South Marston, and his wife, Ann. Alfred Williams's birth certificate gives his date of birth as 6 February 1877, but his mother always insisted that 7 February was in fact the correct date. His father left home when Williams was three, and his mother took on additional jobs, enabling her children to attend the village school. At eight he began working part-time on a local farm, and three years later left school to go there full-time. In 1892 he went to work in the Great Western Railway works in Swindon, principally as a hammer-man, and remained there until 1914.<br>
<br>Williams began studying in his spare time in 1897 and taught himself Latin and Greek, enrolling in a correspondence course in English literature at Ruskin Hall, Oxford, in 1900. He married his childhood friend Mary Maria Peck (1880&#150;1930), daughter of William Peck, moulder, on 21 October 1903. They had no children. In 1903&#150;4 he started writing, and by 1907 his poems were appearing in anthologies. He received the patronage of Lord Edmond Fitzmaurice (E. G. Petty-Fitzmaurice) and published several volumes of poetry, notably <span class="italic">Songs in Wiltshire</span> (1909), <span class="italic">Poems in Wiltshire</span> (1911), <span class="italic">Nature and other Poems</span> (1912), and <span class="italic">Cor cordium</span> (1913). His best poetry is in his <span class="italic">Selected Poems</span> (1926).<br>
<br>In 1914 ill health forced Williams to leave the railway works, and he took up market gardening. He volunteered for army service in 1916, and served from 1917 to 1919 in India, where he taught himself Sanskrit. In 1920&#150;21 he and his wife built their own house, Ranikhet, in South Marston, and the last decade of his life was spent writing and market gardening. Several awards from the Royal Literary Fund and the Royal Bounty Fund did a little to alleviate their poverty.<br>
<br>Williams's most enduring work, his account <span class="italic">Life in a Railway Factory</span> (1915), is informed by a keen sense of the cruel, alienating regime of the factory. In his books on folk life&#151;<span class="italic">A Wiltshire Village</span> (1912), <span class="italic">Villages of the White Horse</span> (1913), <span class="italic">Round about the Upper Thames</span> (1922), <span class="italic">Folk-Songs of the Upper Thames</span> (1923), and <span class="italic">The Banks of Isis</span>, serialized in the <span class="italic">North Berkshire Herald</span> in 1925&#151;he left, as he had hoped to do, &#145;a permanent record of the language and activities of the district in which I find myself&#146;. They show an intense awareness of a fast disappearing way of life. His translation of <span class="italic">Tales from the Panchatantra</span>&#151;illustrated by the future novelist Margiad Evans&#151;was published posthumously in 1930.<br>
<br>A shy, self-effacing man, Williams was self-taught, and he showed an independent and determined intellectual curiosity. He had a good ear for language, and was a talented scholar, translator, and lyric poet. He received a civil-list pension in March 1930. Alfred Williams died of heart failure in the early hours of 10 April 1930, at his home in South Marston, after visiting his dying wife in hospital the previous day. He was buried in the South Marston churchyard on 15 April, as was his wife less than two months later. Memorials to him were raised on Liddington Hill in 1938 and on Barbury Hill in 1939.<br>
