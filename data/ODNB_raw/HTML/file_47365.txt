<span class="headword">Hicks,  Amelia Jane <span class="st"> [Amie]</span></span>  (1839&#150;1917), <span class="occ">socialist and trade unionist</span>, was born at 49 Little Surrey Street, Southwark, London, on 26 February 1839, daughter of Richard George Cox, bootmaker and Chartist, and his wife, Harriet, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Ford. Little is known of her early life. On 4 June 1860 she married William John Hicks, a pianoforte maker, the son of William Hicks, carpenter and joiner; they had six children. In 1865 they emigrated to Auckland, New Zealand, where Amie was employed in rope making.<br>
<br>The family returned to England about 1880, and set up home in West Hampstead; this marked the beginning of Amie's involvement in socialist politics. By the spring of 1883 Amie, William, and their daughter, Margaretta, had joined H. M. Hyndman's Democratic Federation, renamed the Social Democratic Federation (SDF) in the following year. Amie, along with two other women (Eleanor Marx and Mrs Hyndman), was elected onto the SDF executive committee in 1884 and 1885. She played an active role in socialist affairs as an open-air speaker and lecturer. In the free-speech campaign of 1885 she was fined &pound;20 for a breach of the peace while addressing a crowd in Dod Street, and she also took part with her son Alfred, a compositor, in the unemployed agitation of 1885&#150;6. She stood unsuccessfully as an SDF candidate for the London school board in 1885 and 1888, giving her occupation as &#145;accoucheuse&#146; (midwife).<br>
<br>In 1888 Amie Hicks moved to Kentish Town and for the next two decades lived in a variety of homes in nearby Camden Town. She became involved in the labour unrest in London between 1888 and 1890, which led to a shift in the focus of her activities away from socialist politics towards women's labour issues. None the less, she continued to attend SDF meetings, and her links with the party were maintained through Margaretta Hicks, who stood as an SDF candidate for the board of guardians in St Pancras in 1904, set up the women's paper <span class="italic">The Link</span> in 1911, and became the first woman organizer of the British Socialist Party (successor to the SDF) in 1914.<br>
<br>In 1889 Amie Hicks became involved in a new organization, the Women's Trade Union Association (WTUA), which aimed to help female workers in the East End to form trade unions. She worked closely with Clementina Black, who had been secretary of the Women's Trade Union League, and Clara James, assistant secretary of the association, who was already a close friend and a member of the Hicks household. After convening a meeting of rope makers in 1889 Amie was elected secretary of a newly formed East London Ropemakers' Union, a position she held for ten years. Along with Clara James she pressurized the royal commission on labour to hear female witnesses, and in 1891 the two women were invited to give evidence about the work conditions for rope makers and confectionery workers. Amie noted that conditions for women were so bad in east London that an employer had only to say he wanted some work done, fix his own rate of pay, and he would always find women glad to take it. She appealed, therefore, for the appointment of women factory inspectors, for the medical inspection of women's work, government regulation of profit and wages, and amendments to the <span class="roman">Employers' Liability Act</span>.<br>
<br>The difficulties of organizing &#145;sweated&#146; workers convinced the leaders of the WTUA that they should redirect their energies into a new organization, the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/96080', "Women's Industrial Council")</script> (WIC), established in 1894. The new group sought to undertake systematic enquiry into the conditions of working women, to influence public opinion, and to lobby for government policies which would improve women's employment position. Amie Hicks served on the executive of the WIC from its foundation until 1908. She was president of the Clubs' Industrial Association (CIA), which represented forty-five working girls' clubs and was intended to strengthen links between a predominantly middle-class leadership and working women. With her &#145;hands on&#146; industrial experience and working-class background Amie Hicks had a better understanding of factory girls and what would appeal to them than many more philanthropically minded club workers. The association aimed to encourage leadership among working-class girls, to develop domestic ideals, and to improve physical conditions. Clara James, for example, ran classes in physical drill. The organizers hoped that working girls would take an active interest in civic life and Amie Hicks arranged lectures on industrial, social, and educational topics. She believed that this would enable working women to understand industrial law which might encourage them to assist factory inspectors. She also emphasized the need for training and education since she argued that this would enable women workers to demand better pay and to understand the benefits of trade unionism.<br>
<br>Amie Hicks was joined in her work for the WIC by her daughter Frances Amelia Hicks, sometimes called Amy (<i>b</i>. 1861), who was secretary of the London Tailoresses' Society. Frances was elected to the London Trades Council executive in 1893, joined the technical education board of the London County Council in February 1894, and was appointed the first secretary of the WIC on &pound;100 a year in 1895. She held this post for only six months, resigning on her marriage to Henry James, a mariner, in September 1895. She continued, however, as secretary of the organizations committee of the WIC, of which her mother was chair, and gave lectures on technical education and the <span class="roman">Factory Acts</span>. She wrote two essays, &#145;Dressmakers and tailoresses&#146;  (in F. Galton, ed., <span class="italic">Workers on their Industries</span>, 1896) and &#145;Factory girls&#146;  (in A. Reid, ed., <span class="italic">The New Party</span>, 1895). She later joined the Women's Labour League and was secretary of the St Pancras branch in 1907.<br>
<br>Amie Hicks's work for the WTUA and WIC brought her into contact with women from varied social backgrounds who were interested in improving women's work conditions. She opened her home to trade unionists and socialists such as Margaret Bondfield who later acknowledged her influence and support. In an account of the life of Clara James, Mrs Gilchrist Thompson, a member of the WIC, claimed that Clara &#145;came under the influence of a heroic Labour leader, Mrs Amie Hicks, who, when I came to know her, typified to me what must have been the aspect of one of the minor prophets&#151;denouncing the greed and cruelty of the society of his day&#146;  (Bondfield, 32&#150;3). It was in Amie Hicks's garden that Mrs Thompson found out from the young Margaret Gladstone that she was to marry Ramsay MacDonald, who later claimed that Amie was one of the two women who most inspired his wife. He described her as &#145;a woman of some note as a socialist worker, with a strong motherly face, a firm independent character, a great store of good simple common sense, and above all the mother of children who doated [<i>sic</i>] upon her and admired her&#146;  (MacDonald, 137).<br>
<br>During the 1890s Amie Hicks had a considerable reputation as a speaker on subjects relating to working women. She was appointed a delegate with John Burns and David Holmes (of the Weavers' Union) to the American Convention of Labour in 1894. A serious illness on arrival in America prevented her from attending the convention, but she addressed a strike meeting in Boston and lectured to the Twentieth Century Club on women and the labour movement.<br>
<br>She attended the Socialist and Trade Union International Congress in London in 1896, where she presented a resolution calling for the prohibition of women working in factories for six weeks before and after confinement and for a maternity grant. She attended the 1897 Conference on Home Work and read a paper on &#145;child-bearing women&#146; at the International Conference of Women held in London in June 1899. She was also a member of the London Reform Union, a non-party-political organization which was concerned with moral and social reforms, better housing, and improvements in the municipal government of London.<br>
<br>Amie Hicks continued her association with the WIC until 1910, after which she became vice-president of the National Association of Girls' Clubs, which was formed in 1911 from an amalgamation of the girls' clubs and rest rooms committees of the National Union of Women Workers and the CIA. Amie Hicks appears to have spent her last years living with her daughter, Margaretta, at 21 Rochester Square, St Pancras. She died, after a long illness, in the Middlesex Hospital on 5 February 1917. There was an &#145;In memoriam&#146; tribute to her in the WIC journal, <span class="italic">Women's Industrial News</span>, which recorded her &#145;personal note of sympathy for the particular case &hellip; her passionate sense of justice and &hellip; her eager, youthful spirit&#146;  (<span class="italic">WIN</span>, April 1917), but there were no obituaries in the general press. And yet Amie Hicks was a well-known figure in the trade union and socialist movements and one of the few working-class women to achieve prominence as an organizer and speaker.<br>
