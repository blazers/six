<span class="headword">Webb,  Arthur</span>  (1868&#150;1952), <span class="occ">building society manager</span>, was born on 8 July 1868 at Battersea, London, the son of Thomas Burgess Webb and his wife, Christine, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Young. Thomas Webb had worked at Price's candle factory, Battersea, and was a founder of the Battersea Co-operative Society, a director of the Co-operative Wholesale Society, and president from its foundation in 1884 of the Southern Co-operative Building Society. When Arthur Webb left the local Sir Walter St John School, he became a clerk with the Battersea Co-operative Society and a collector for the Southern Co-operative Building Society. In 1892 he was appointed secretary of the building society, which then had assets of &pound;24,000, at a salary of &pound;120 per year. He married Mabel Elizabeth, daughter of George Benjamin Edwards, an auctioneer, in 1898. She was a journalist, broadcaster, and author of works on domestic economy. They had two sons and two daughters.<br>
<br>Webb proved to be an able and vigorous leader who took full advantage of the building society's co-operative connections to give it wide publicity. His insistence, in 1894, that &#145;Southern&#146; be eliminated from the title showed his ambitions. He tirelessly addressed co-operative gatherings, especially meetings of local retail societies. Innovation and awareness of members' needs characterized Webb's administration. A triplicate slip was devised so that mortgage instalments or investments could be made at the branches of many retail societies. &#145;Home safes&#146; in a variety of styles were soon made available. Mortgages backed by endowment assurance policies were introduced. Retail societies could borrow to finance new shops. An insurance policy was negotiated covering all the properties mortgaged to the society, giving savings both to the members and to the society. The need for appropriate office space both for mechanization and the expansion of business was promptly dealt with. Webb encouraged his staff with an independent superannuation scheme, professional education and sports facilities. He supported attempts to create a professional staff organization and, when the Building Societies Institute was formed in 1934, Webb was a foundation council member, president (1939&#150;41), and one of its first fellows. He was also a fellow of the Chartered Institute of Secretaries. The assets of the Co-operative Building Society grew steadily until 1914, and spectacularly after 1918. Webb joined the board in 1927, and in 1928 became the society's first managing director. He resigned that post in 1939 to serve as president (1939&#150;41) and continued as a director until 1951. When he resigned in 1939 the society had a network of thirty-five branches and 576 agencies; it was the country's sixth largest society.<br>
<br>Webb was elected to the executive committee of the National Association of Building Societies in 1903, holding office continuously until increasing deafness led him to resign in 1945; he then became a vice-president. He served as chairman both of the parliamentary and of the finance committees. In 1916 he sought direct involvement for societies in the post-war design of houses and the development of estates, but gained little support. In the 1930s he correctly judged that collective voluntary action by societies could not successfully restrain their cut-throat competition to lend, which threatened their financial stability. For Webb the solution lay in legislation, and he welcomed the 1939 <span class="roman">Building Societies Act</span>. In 1943 he published <span class="italic">Signposts of Building Finance</span>, where he questioned the long-run viability of the large number of small societies, and they were offered a merger with the Cooperative Society. His view met general resistance and the offer was withdrawn, although there were fifteen such mergers between 1943 and 1947. However, subsequent events confirmed his judgement.<br>
<br>Webb lived in Wimbledon, and was elected to the local urban district council, and later to the Surrey county council. Education was his strong interest, particularly the establishment of secondary schools under the 1902 <span class="roman">Education Act</span>. He served as chairman of the Wimbledon Higher Education Committee, of the School of Art, and of the Technical College, and was a governor of Wimbledon Girls' High School. Appointed a magistrate in 1915, he was vice-chairman of the Wimbledon bench and chairman of the juvenile court; he retired in 1941. Webb died at his home, 6 Blenheim Road, Grand Drive, Wimbledon, on 16 October 1952, and was cremated five days later at the South London crematorium, Streatham Vale. He was survived by his wife and four children.<br>
