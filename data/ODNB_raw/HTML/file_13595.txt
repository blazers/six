<span class="headword">Holmes,  John</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1629), <span class="occ">musician</span>, is of unknown parentage. Although the archival sources are fragmentary, it is certain that Holmes spent the early part of his adult working life at Winchester Cathedral. He is first mentioned on 18 December 1599, in circumstances which suggest that he may have served from the outset as organist, when he was admitted a lay vicar. Holmes served as organist at installation ceremonies in January 1611, June 1613, and August 1621; and further confirmation is found in an indenture dated 20 January 1616, relating to the lease of a house in Kingsgate parish, Winchester.<br>
<br>Holmes's association with Salisbury Cathedral is first attested in August 1613, when he took two of his Winchester choristers to augment the choir during James I's visit there; but in 1621 Holmes accepted a probationary lay vicar's place at Salisbury, and was also appointed instructor of the choristers, a post in which he was shortly afterwards confirmed. He is first styled &#145;M[aste]r of the Choristers&#146; on 25 July 1622, in the baptismal record of one of his sons, James. His wife's name was Dussabella.<br>
<br>Probably an able teacher as well as an accomplished composer, Holmes had as his most famous pupil the composer Adrian Batten, once a chorister of Winchester. A manuscript known as the Batten organ book states that its copies of Holmes's anthems, some of which are dated between 1602 and 1610, were &#145;prict [i.e. copied] from his owne hand prickinge [that is, Holmes's autograph] in the yeare: 1635&#146;  (Tenbury MS 791, fol. 400<i>r</i>). His second prot&eacute;g&eacute; was the Salisbury chorister Edward Lowe, subsequently organist of Christ Church, Oxford, and professor of music there.<br>
<br>Sadly, Holmes's church music (comprising full-choir settings of the preces and <span class="roman">Psalm 89</span> and two evening services, and seventeen verse anthems) is now incomplete; but the surviving fragments reveal a competent technique and a love of rich sonorities, and his verse compositions are some of the earliest provincial examples of the type. Holmes's other works (which include an untexted five-part anthem, perhaps intended for viols, a madrigal, and a short keyboard pavan) are less significant.<br>
<br>Holmes made his will on 27 January 1629 and died soon afterwards, probably at his home (thought to have been the choristers' house) in the close, Salisbury. His burial at Salisbury Cathedral on 30 January 1629 was followed by a bitter dispute as to whether he should be succeeded as the choristers' instructor by his son Thomas or by Giles Tomkins; the latter triumphed, and on 5 November an order of the court of chancery had to be produced to secure possession of the choristers' house from Holmes's widow.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_13603"></a><span class="headword">Thomas Holmes</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1606, <em>d.</em> 1638), <span class="occ">organist, singer, and composer</span>, was baptized in St Swithun's parish, Winchester, on 11 April 1606, a son of John and Dussabella Holmes. While it is reasonable to assume that he was a chorister at Winchester under his father, there is no proof of this, and he first appears in the records relating to the dispute over his father's successor at Salisbury Cathedral in 1629, which Thomas Holmes appears to have lost. He was admitted lay vicar and organist at Winchester on 5 April 1631, at the dean's special request, and on 17 September 1633 was appointed a gentleman of the Chapel Royal. His royal duties may by the following month have made him the subject of a dispute, when they were apparently causing him to be absent from Winchester, much to the chapter's annoyance. Apparently the archbishop of Canterbury had taken Holmes's side in the matter, and the chapter would have written &#145;to his Grace and to represent the necessity our church had of his presence&#146;  (Shaw, 296) had not the king intervened to prevent such a petition. The situation was probably rectified, for two years later one visitor to the cathedral praised Holmes as &#145;one of the rarest Organists &hellip; that this Land affoords&#146;  (Hammond, 46). Meanwhile, his court connections probably qualified him to take part, as a bass singer, in James Shirley's masque <span class="italic">The Triumph of Peace</span> on 13 February 1634. Perhaps this was the occasion of his meeting with the composer John Jenkins, who reported a story about his having &#145;one false Eye of Glasse&#146; and his bizarre sense of humour in accommodating it  (Ashbee and Lasocki, 582). Holmes died in Salisbury on 25 March 1638 and was buried in the close there later that month.<br>
<br>Holmes's extant compositions include five verse anthems, music for three viols, and a single song; but it is for his three-part catches and canons, published between 1651 and 1680, that he is best known.<br>
<br>His most unusual work, however, is the solo bass song &#145;Oberon, or, The Madmans Songe, sung in a comedy at Cambridge before the king &amp; queene by the author&#146;. Preserved in British Library Add. MS 11608, fol. 18<i>r</i>, and beginning &#145;Newly from a Poatcht Toad &amp; a broyl'd Viper&#146;, it begins with strikingly athletic vocal leaps, seasoned with florid ornamentation, and concludes in a smooth and melodious triple metre.<br>
