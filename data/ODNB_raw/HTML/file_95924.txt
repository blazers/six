<span class="headword">Fry,  Jeremy Joseph</span>  (1924&#150;2005), <span class="occ">inventor and businessman</span>, was born on 19 May 1924 at Grove House, Frenchay, Winterbourne, Gloucestershire, the youngest child in the family of two sons and one daughter of Cecil Roderick Fry (1890&#150;1952), chairman of J. S. Fry &amp; Sons Ltd, chocolate manufacturers, and his wife, Olave Kate (<i>d</i>. 1949), daughter of W. C. Anderson of Keston, Kent. He was educated at Gordonstoun School in north-east Scotland, which was evacuated to Llandinam in Montgomeryshire in 1940: before the evacuation he overlapped briefly with Prince Philip of Greece, later duke of Edinburgh. Already interested in cars, he managed to avoid playing games at school in return for keeping the headmaster's car running, and was captain of the engineering guild.<br>
<br>After leaving school in 1942 Fry joined the RAF, serving as air crew, and later trained as a pilot in North America. When the Second World War ended he studied at the Architectural Association School of Architecture, but left without qualifying to join his brother at the Frenchay Products Company, which they set up to manufacture components for the aviation industry. He also founded the Parsenn Car Company, and designed, built, and raced the Parsenn car (named after his favourite ski-run). On 20 March 1954 he married Camilla (<i>d</i>. 2000), the twenty-year-old daughter of Geoffrey Norman Grinling, landscape painter; their family consisted of two sons and two daughters. After his marriage he bought Widcombe Manor, a Georgian manor house near Bath. In 1960 Antony Armstrong-Jones (later earl of Snowdon), one of his closest friends, asked him to be best man at his wedding to Princess Margaret, but a month before the wedding Fry stood down, ostensibly on the grounds of ill health. Rumours abounded at the time and later as to the real reason for his withdrawal (later it emerged not only that he had in 1952 been found guilty of importuning men for sex, but also that Armstrong-Jones was the biological father of Camilla's daughter, Polly Fry), but he remained a close friend of the Snowdons.<br>
<br>Frenchay Products had acquired Rotork, a small electrical and mechanical engineering company in Frenchay, after the war, and Fry re-formed it as a separate company. He began work on the design of motorized valve actuators for pipelines, and in 1957 the Rotork Engineering Co. Ltd workshop moved to Widcombe Manor. A major innovation was the flameproof actuator, and by 1958 Rotork was supplying actuators for the BP, Esso, and Shell oil refineries in Britain, Europe, and the Middle East. In 1960 Fry introduced O ring sealing, which made the electrical actuator waterproof as well as explosion-proof. While the manufacture of the actuators had originally been contracted out, in 1960 Fry converted an old mill into a factory, and in 1962 built a new factory in Brassmill Lane, Bath, which became the company's headquarters. One of Rotork's main customers in these early years was the French atomic energy authority, which placed an order in 1962 for more than 1000 actuators for a new uranium enrichment plant. In 1968 Rotork became a public company, Rotork Controls Ltd, with Fry as majority shareholder. He opened a manufacturing plant in Maryland in the United States in 1970, to supply American oil companies and the American nuclear power industry, and continued to expand and innovate throughout the 1970s. By the time Fry retired in 1984 Rotork was the leading valve actuation company in the world, with subsidiaries in nine countries and revenues of &pound;21 million a year.<br>
<br>Fry was an inventor, not a trained engineer, teaching himself what he needed to know as he went along, and trying different methods until he found one that worked, rather than sitting at a desk making calculations. According to his prot&eacute;g&eacute; James Dyson &#145;he had no regard for experts from other fields &hellip; and he was an engineer interested in building things that derived not only excellence from their design, but elegance as well&#146;  (Dyson, 49). He also liked to nurture talented young people with ideas, and this had led Dyson, a student at the Royal College of Art, to approach Fry in 1968 with an idea for an aluminium, mushroom-shaped theatre. Although Fry did not offer to finance this project, he offered him a different one, to help him to design the auditorium for the Roundhouse theatre in London, which was being converted from a former locomotive turning house. Then Fry asked Dyson to help with the design of the Sea Truck, a high-speed, flat-bottomed landing craft: in 1970 Fry set up Rotork Marine to make and sell it, with Dyson in charge. When Bangladesh was devastated by floods in 1972 Fry sold 100 Sea Trucks to the Bangladeshi government to help in landing supplies for the victims, and spent several months there managing the service depot. Fry and Dyson set up Prototypes Ltd to develop new products and produce working prototypes which would then be manufactured elsewhere: joint projects included the Squirrel, an outdoor wheelchair with four-wheel drive and power steering, manufactured in collaboration with Lord Snowdon, which was never a commercial success, and a bagless vacuum cleaner. Dyson later bought Fry out of Prototypes Ltd and set up his own company, the Air Power Vacuum Cleaner Company (later Dyson Ltd), which very successfully developed the upright dual cyclone vacuum cleaner.<br>
<br>In 1958 Fry bought Le Grand Banc, an uninhabited hamlet on the northern slopes of the Luberon valley in Provence, and restored the derelict houses, intending it as a holiday home and a base for engineers and artists to work together. He also bought a seventeenth-century castle in Malta. He loved travel, and went on expeditions to India, Sri Lanka, Japan, and Guatemala, often in the company of his friend the film director Tony Richardson. He travelled across the &#145;empty quarter&#146; of Saudi Arabia with his disabled friend the writer Quentin Crewe (whom he housed in Le Grand Banc for a decade). After his divorce in 1967, and the sale of Widcombe Manor, he moved to the Royal Crescent, Bath, and later to The Brewery, Freshford. After restoring the brewery, he financed a number of other restoration projects: in 1979 he bought the dilapidated Theatre Royal in Bath, restored it, and formed a charitable trust, endowing it in perpetuity for the people of Bath. It reopened in 1982. In 1985 he became chairman of the Arnolfini gallery, an arts centre in Bristol, and engaged the architect David Chipperfield to restore it. A ballet lover, Fry became chairman of the Northern Ballet Company in 1989, and with Christopher Gable as artistic director it became one of the most successful ballet companies in the country. He was also the first chairman of the Michael Clark Dance Company, formed in 1984. Always willing to give young and inexperienced people a chance, he was an important figure in the Eaton Hall Design Workshops, started by Sally, duchess of Westminster, to help young engineering designers. He met the young Canadian Robert Carsen (<i>b</i>. 1955), later a well-known opera director, in 1975, and they were devoted companions for the rest of Fry's life.<br>
<br>In 1994 Fry moved to Kerala in southern India. He bought the wooden former palace of the raja of Travancore, dismantled it, moved it up the mountain to a tea and cardamom plantation, restored it, and then, after years of difficulties with officials and neighbours, dismantled it again and moved it over the mountains to Tamil Nadu, where he spent the rest of his life. Described by his close friends as charismatic, magnetic, original, unconventional, charming, clever, and good-looking, Jeremy Fry died on 18 July 2005 in Madurai, Tamil Nadu, and his body was cremated there on a funeral pyre. The Jeremy Fry memorial scholarship at the University of Bath was set up after his death by the James Dyson Foundation, to be awarded annually to the engineering student who demonstrated the most inventive flair. As Dyson said when announcing the award:<blockquote>Jeremy was the most charismatic and inventive of engineering designers &hellip; He was such a great inventor, and was very keen to encourage invention and creativity. His real brilliance was to nurture and help young engineers, to whom he showed huge generosity. (<span class="italic">Bath Chronicle</span>, 17 Nov 2005)</blockquote>
