<span class="headword">Dockwray <span class="st"> [Docwra]</span>,  Thomas</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1559), <span class="occ">master of the Stationers' Company and ecclesiastical lawyer</span>, about whose origins and parentage nothing is known, does not seem to have been related to his namesake and near contemporary <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7726/', "Sir Thomas Docwra (d. 1527)")</script>, prior of the knights of St John of Jerusalem at Clerkenwell. Although a member of the Stationers' Company from at least 1519, Dockwray's name appears in no surviving book imprints. However, he was associated with both the printer and bookseller Henry Pepwell and the bookseller John Reynes. In 1533 Dockwray was in Antwerp on behalf of the bishop of London, John Stokesley, on unknown business, to the nature of which Pepwell was said to be privy. Dockwray's early relationship with the Stationers' Company is difficult to assess as no company records survive before 1554; however, he served as master from 1554 to 1558&#151;a crucial period that saw the company incorporated by Queen Mary in 1557.<br>
<br>Dockwray had a lifelong association with the London parish of St Faith which included the main bookselling areas of St Paul's Churchyard and Paternoster Row, both as a resident&#151;he occupied premises on the north side of the churchyard&#151;and as a property developer. He seems, at least for a time, to have been a wealthy man, and in 1536 he and Pepwell, another St Faith's resident, were described as substantial inhabitants of the parish in their appointment as petty collectors of the king's subsidy. However, in 1539 Dockwray was listed as one of many churchyard tenants in arrears. In 1552 he built tenements in Paternoster Row, and at his death he held property in both Paternoster Row and Warwick Lane.<br>
<br>Dockwray also had a long legal career. From at least 1527 he was a proctor in the court of arches&#151;that is, one of a dozen or so lawyers in the highest ecclesiastical court in the Canterbury province based in St Mary-le-Bow Church, London. At some point between 1542 and 1550 he was suspended, as in the latter year he was reinstated by the archbishop; eight months later Dockwray was one of the defending lawyers at the trial of Stephen Gardiner, bishop of Winchester.<br>
<br>In 1532, despite having been successfully sued two months earlier for armed assault, Dockwray was appointed the city's proctor for &#145;speciall matters &amp; Causes&#146;  (CLRO, repertory, 8, fol. 242<i>r</i>); he was still drawing a fee for this in 1536, and in 1541 he was consulted by the city recorder, Roger Cholmley, regarding a conflict of rights between the lord admiral and the Thames conservators. Earlier in 1541, he seems to have been a common councilman as he was among a list of &#145;Commoners&#146; appointed by the court of aldermen to view the former London friaries.<br>
<br>Dockwray died on 23 June 1559 and was buried in the church of St Faith's under St Paul's two days later, attended by &#145;mony morners&#146;  (<span class="italic">Diary of Henry Machyn</span>, 201). An epitaph was recorded by William Dugdale. He was survived by a widow, Anne, and had held property in London, Middlesex, and Hertfordshire.<br>
<br>Dockwray did not mention the Stationers' Company in his will, although a bequest of 20<i>s</i>. and a gilt-silver spoon was made on his behalf by his widow; however, he left a tenement in Paternoster Row to the Jesus Guild, a religious fraternity re-established in St Faith's in 1556 but dissolved very early in Elizabeth's reign.<br>
<br>Of Anne, nothing is known although she may have been the &#145;mistress Dockwra&#146; buried in April 1561  (<span class="italic">Diary of Henry Machyn</span>, 254).<br>
