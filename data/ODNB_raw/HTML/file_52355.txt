<span class="headword">Tovi the Proud</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1018&#150;1042), <span class="occ">nobleman and administrator</span>, was probably of Danish descent. He is remembered as the founder of the college of secular canons at Holy Cross, Waltham, in Essex. The Waltham chronicle, composed between 1177 and 1189, describes the miraculous discovery of the &#145;Black Rood&#146;, a life-sized figure of the crucified Christ, at Tovi's manor of Lutgaresberi (Montacute), Somerset, and its removal to Waltham, described as Tovi's hunting-lodge. The foundations of three earlier churches have, however, been found beneath the present building, and the settlement may date back to the ninth century. Tovi established the rood, girded with his own sword, in the church of Waltham, endowed the church with land and treasures, and established livings for two priests.<br>
<br>The Waltham chronicle exaggerates in describing Tovi as &#145;the first man in England after the king&#146;  (<span class="italic">Waltham Chronicle</span>, 13), but there is no reason to doubt its assertion that he was a staller (someone with special functions in the royal administration), for in the reign of Cnut (<i>r</i>. 1016&#150;35) he attended a shire-court at Aylton, Herefordshire, &#145;on the king's business&#146;  (<span class="italic">AS chart.</span>, S 1462). He attests Cnut's charters between 1018 and 1035, often alongside <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20890/', "Osgod Clapa (d. 1054)")</script>, another man known to be a staller; in 1033 they are actually distinguished by their bynames  (<span class="italic">AS chart.</span>, S 968). In 1042 Tovi married Osgod's daughter Gytha, almost certainly as his second wife; it was at their wedding feast, held at Lambeth, that King Harthacnut collapsed and died &#145;as he stood at his drink&#146;  (<span class="italic">ASC</span>, s.a. 1042, Texts C, D).<br>
<br>In 1042&#150;3 Tovi was among the executors of the will of &AElig;lfric Modercope, an east midlands thegn  (<span class="italic">AS chart.</span>, S 1490), but it is not certain that he is the Tovi who attests charters of Harthacnut and Edward between 1042 and 1044, in every case in a rather lowly position  (<span class="italic">AS chart.</span>, S 993, 998&#150;9, 1003); his name is not uncommon and two men bearing it, Tovi the White and Tovi the Red, attest a charter in 1034  (<span class="italic">AS chart.</span>, S 961). Tovi the Proud probably died soon after 1042 and may well have been buried at Holy Cross, Waltham. He is commemorated in the <span class="italic">Liber vitae</span> of Thorney Abbey, as well as at Waltham itself.<br>
<br>Apart from Montacute, Tovi's recorded lands (about 140 hides on the <span class="roman">Domesday</span> figures) lay in Essex (Waltham, Loughton, and Alderton), Hertfordshire (Cheshunt, Hitchin), and Middlesex (Edmonton and Enfield); he also had property at Reading, Berkshire. Lambeth, which he gave to Waltham, was probably his wife's marriage portion. Gytha herself provided the rood with a golden crown and gem-encrusted girdle, as well as plate commissioned from the king's goldsmith, Theodoric of London. Tovi left a son &AElig;thelstan&#151;possibly &AElig;lfstan the Staller, recorded <i>c</i>.1045  (<span class="italic">AS chart.</span>, S 1471), for the names were sometimes confused&#151;who lost much of his father's estate through incompetence. The beneficiary was Harold Godwineson (<i>d</i>. 1066), who also took on Tovi's role as patron of Waltham: he increased the number of canons, greatly augmented the endowment, and rebuilt the church in the German style. Tovi's grandson <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/52346/', "Asgar the Staller")</script> was still a wealthy and powerful man around the time of the conquest.<br>
