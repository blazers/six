<span class="headword">Spiers,  Walter Lewis</span>  (1848&#150;1917), <span class="occ">museum curator and architect</span>, was born on 27 July 1848 in Headington, Oxford, and baptized on 1 October at St Giles', Oxford, the fourth son in the family of seven sons and six daughters of Richard James Spiers (1806&#150;1877), stationer and mayor of Oxford in 1853&#150;4, and his wife, Elizabeth Phen&eacute; Joy (1818&#150;1858). In 1858 he won a choristership at Magdalen College, Oxford, and entered the college's school. In 1864 he entered the engineering department of King's College, London. He was articled to his brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36216/', "Richard Phen&#233; Spiers")</script>, in 1866, when he also joined the Architectural Association, later gaining first prize in the class of design. He became a student at the Royal Academy in 1868.<br>
<br>From 1870 to 1880 Spiers was at the office of the architect Thomas Henry Wyatt and later went into partnership with the latter's son Matthew. In 1875 he was elected an associate of the Royal Institute of British Architects. In 1887 he was appointed district surveyor for Charlton, Lee, and Kidbrooke under the Metropolitan Board of Works and continued in this post under the London county council. In 1888&#150;9 he was involved with the building of the headquarters of the Artists' volunteer corps (the Artists' Rifles), of which he was an enthusiastic member for many years, retiring with the honorary rank of major.<br>
<br>Spiers's appointment as curator of Sir John Soane's Museum at a salary of &pound;300 per annum was announced on 16 July 1904; he had been acting curator while his predecessor George H. Birch had been on sick leave. His successor as curator, Arthur T. Bolton, claimed that &#145;it is no disrespect to his distinguished predecessors in that office to assert that he was the best curator that ever held that position of trust&#146;, an opinion that was shared by John Summerson, who succeeded Bolton. Spiers did much to make the museum's collections more accessible to students and placed his wide-ranging knowledge ungrudgingly at the service of enquirers. The inventory of the museum's contents that he drew up with such meticulous care, accompanying his sections for each room with an admirable sketch showing the location of each item, remained in use and he also took an invaluable series of photographs recording the interiors of the museum and some of the objects. Spiers also catalogued the museum's large collection of drawings by Robert Adam and did preliminary work on the arrangement and classification of Soane's archive, laying the foundations on which Arthur Bolton was to build.<br>
<br>Spiers enjoyed the ardours of research. While at the Soane he edited and wrote a commentary on two small books in the museum, <span class="italic">The Notebook and Account Book of Nicholas Stone, Master Mason to James I and Charles I</span> (<span class="italic">Walpole Society</span>, 7, 1919), which he illustrated with photographs of that sculptor's monuments taken during numerous journeys devoted to studying Stone's work. He also contributed several important articles to the <span class="italic">Journal of the London Topographical Society</span>, of which he was one of the earliest members and to the council of which he was elected in 1902. As a result of this special interest he made a topographical index to the drawings in the Soane museum. His own large personal collection of prints and maps, some of them annotated by him and much consulted in his lifetime, was sold at auction by his family after his death. He was elected fellow of the Society of Antiquaries in 1916. Spiers was trained in the Gothic school, but Bolton, who knew him well, insists that he never referred to any buildings of his own and little is apparently known about his work as an architect. The announcement of his appointment as curator in the <span class="italic">Builders' Journal and Architectural Record</span> for 13 June 1904 included the information that he would relinquish his private practice. He did, however, carry out some repairs to the fabric of the Soane museum. Bolton stated that Spiers &#145;disliked his name being quoted in any way&#146; and that it was &#145;difficult for his services to be adequately acknowledged&#146;. Spiers was an unassuming and kindly man, whose painstaking scholarship was greatly admired by those who knew him.<br>
<br>Spiers refused to take a holiday of even a single day during the German air attack on London in 1916&#150;17, wishing to be present should any emergency arise. This confinement apparently affected his health and, after a short illness, he died suddenly at the museum on 28 May 1917. He was unmarried. He was buried at Brookwood cemetery, Surrey, on 31 May.<br>
