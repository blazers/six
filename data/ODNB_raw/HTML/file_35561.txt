<span class="headword">Pollock,  Bertram</span>  (1863&#150;1943), <span class="occ">headmaster and bishop of Norwich</span>, was born at Hanworth, Middlesex, on 6 December 1863, the youngest of seven children of George Frederick Pollock (1821&#150;1915), senior master of the Supreme Court and later queen's remembrancer, and his wife, Frances Diana Herbert (<i>d</i>. 1891). His was a distinguished legal family; his elder brother E. M. Pollock, Viscount Hanworth, became master of the rolls, and his first cousin was the jurist, Sir Frederick Pollock. But from youth Bertram Pollock knew that he wanted to be a priest. He won scholarships to Charterhouse, and Trinity College, Cambridge, and took a first in the classical tripos in 1885. (He was made DD in 1903.) He also represented Cambridge at athletics.<br>
<br>Pollock was prepared for ordination in 1891 by Brooke Foss Westcott, whom he revered. He taught at Marlborough from 1886 to 1893, when he was appointed master of Wellington College. He was not yet thirty. He inherited a school whose standards, finances, and prestige had all declined since the days of its founding headmaster, E. W. Benson. He energetically set about restoring all three, reforming the scholarship system, increasing pupil numbers, and erecting new buildings. A shy and aloof man, he found it easier to make friends with pupils than with his staff, from whom he was distant. But he found that teaching offered an outlet for his innate flamboyance. His former pupil Harold Nicolson later described the exhilaration of being taught Greek poetry by Pollock as he sprawled on a lawn or in front of a fire.<br>
<br>Another aspect of his mastership which gave Pollock intense pleasure was the school's close association with the royal family. He loved to choreograph royal visits to Wellington, and devoted six chapters of his memoirs, <span class="italic">A Twentieth-Century Bishop</span> (1944), to recounting them in exhaustive, and rather Pooterish, detail. The visit of Edward VII to the college for its silver jubilee in 1909 symbolized both the recovery of its fortunes and the crowning glory of Pollock's mastership. The king appointed him CVO the same year; he was made KCVO by George V in 1921.<br>
<br>In 1910 Pollock became bishop of Norwich. He was concerned that he lacked any experience in parochial ministry, but was assured by Archbishop Randall Davidson that this did not matter. He was in any case an adept administrator, and developed a scheme to endow poor benefices. But Pollock's reforming zeal did not extend to liturgy and church government, and in 1927&#150;8 he led opposition to the revised prayer book in the House of Lords. His identification with this predominantly evangelical campaign led many people to conclude that he was an evangelical, but he denied this, saying that he owed his churchmanship to Westcott. Pollock objected to prayer book revision because he believed that it would undermine the comprehensiveness of the national church. His attachment to establishment, and to parliamentary control of the church, had also led him to oppose the creation of the church assembly in 1919. Pollock's opposition to the revised prayer book made him an isolated figure on the bench, and his chief episcopal antagonist, Hensley Henson, waspishly likened him to the hermit Simeon Stylites, sitting on his pillar. He remained a bishop until his resignation in 1942. In addition to his memoirs, Pollock published several volumes of sermons, as well as a number of books attacking prayer book revision and defending the national church.<br>
<br>Pollock's character was an awkward amalgam of austerity and flamboyance, hauteur and warmth. In his memoirs he recounted how, as a boy, he had become a teetotaller after an incident in which he drank a glass of ale and hit a policeman in Regent's Park. He remained a lonely bachelor for much of his episcopate, missing the companionship which he had enjoyed at Wellington, but in 1928 he married Joan Florence Helena, daughter of the Revd Algernon Charles Dudley Ryder, with whom he had one daughter, Rosalind. His wife outlived him. He died at Gissing, Norfolk, where he was living, on 17 October 1943, and was buried at Blyford, Suffolk.<br>
