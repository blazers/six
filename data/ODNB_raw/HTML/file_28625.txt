<span class="headword">Walsingham,  Francis</span> <span class="st"> [<em>alias </em>John Fennell]</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1577, <em>d.</em> 1647), <span class="occ">Jesuit</span>, was born in Berwick and was baptized on 7 February 1577, the son of Edward Walsingham (<i>d</i>. 1576) of Exhall, near Alcester, Warwickshire, a kinsman to the secretary of state, Sir Francis Walsingham. His father having died before his birth, his mother, who was a Catholic, brought him to London and entrusted his education to his guardian, Humphrey Walsingham, a citizen of London, who sent him to St Paul's School. He appears to have studied theology at All Souls College, Oxford, and then spent some time as a soldier in the Low Countries under Sir Robert Sidney, governor of Flushing. Then, after returning to London, he took up the study of civil and common law. He also taught for a time at Kingsbury in Middlesex and was ordained deacon by the bishop of Ely in 1603.<br>
<br>About this time he began to have misgivings about his position in the Church of England, after reading Robert Persons's book <span class="italic">A Defence of the Censure</span> (1585). So deep were his misgivings that he decided to set them forth in a memorial which he presented to James I at Greenwich on 6 April 1604; he was told by the king to discuss the matter with his new archbishop of Canterbury, Richard Bancroft. Under the latter's direction he had further discussions with two Anglican divines, William Covell and George Downame, as well as the former Jesuit diplomat Christopher Perkins&#151;but to no avail. Finally, on meeting an imprisoned priest, Edward Tempest, he made a spiritual retreat and was reconciled to the Roman Catholic church.<br>
<br>In 1606 Walsingham was one of forty-seven priests banished from England after the Gunpowder Plot. Entering the English College, Rome, on 27 October 1606 he was ordained priest on 12 April 1608 and was sent back to England the following April. However, on reaching Douai in June 1609 he retraced his steps to Rome and entered the Society of Jesus there. Now with the assistance and encouragement of Robert Persons, rector of the English College, he set forth an account of his spiritual pilgrimage in <span class="italic">A Search Made into Matters of Religion</span> (1609), with a dedication to James I. This work, by which he is said to have &#145;immortalized his name&#146;  (Foley, 6.241), went into a second edition in 1615 and was reprinted in 1843. He went on in 1618 to publish <span class="italic">Reasons for Embracing the Catholick Faith</span>, but no copy of it seems to have survived.<br>
<br>Walsingham was sent on the English mission in 1616 under the alias of John Fennell, and there he laboured, as Foley says, &#145;with indefatigable zeal and abundant fruit&#146;  (Foley, 2.382), first in the Leicestershire district until 1633, then in the Derbyshire district until his death on 1 July 1647 there at the age of seventy-one. It is said of him that he engaged in &#145;many conferences with Protestant ministers, in which he displayed great learning and talent&#146;, but that for the most part &#145;his mission lay amongst the poor, for it was his delight to instruct the ignorant and needy&#146;, especially the children  (ibid., 2.382). All the time he was never far from danger, especially from pursuivants; but he eluded their searches in ways that often seemed miraculous. He is praised as a man of prayer, &#145;possessed of the sweetest manners and a dovelike simplicity&#146; and &#145;athirst for the glory of God&#146;  (ibid., 2.383).<br>
