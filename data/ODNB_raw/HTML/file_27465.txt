<span class="headword">Tindal,  William</span>  (1756&#150;1804), <span class="occ">antiquary</span>, was born at Chelmsford on 14 May 1756, the son of James Tindal (<i>d</i>. 1760), captain in the 4th regiment of dragoons, who was the youngest son of the historian <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27463/', "Nicholas Tindal (1687&#150;1774)")</script>. His mother was Lucy Shenton, who, after James Tindal's death in 1760, married Dr Smith, a physician at Cheltenham and Oxford. At four years of age William Tindal and his mother went to live with her brother, a minor canon of Chichester, and six years later they moved to Richmond. On 19 May 1772 Tindal matriculated from Trinity College, Oxford, and he was elected a scholar in the same year. He graduated BA in 1776 and proceeded MA in 1778. In 1778 he was ordained deacon and obtained a fellowship, which he held until his marriage.<br>
<br>After serving as curate at Fladbury, Worcestershire, Tindal became rector of Wallingford in Norfolk in 1789. In 1792 he also became rector of Kington, Worcestershire. In 1799 he exchanged the living at Wallingford for the chaplainship of the Tower of London. In the same year he was elected a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries.<br>
<br>Besides writing several political pamphlets, Tindal published a work on Dr Johnson's life and the works of Gray (1782). In 1794 he published <span class="italic">The History and Antiquities of the Abbey and Borough of Evesham</span>. This was well reviewed by the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span>, which commented, &#145;this history is executed just as such works should be, and in an agreeable and correct style&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 1st ser., 64/2, 1794, 836). It was also said to have won high praise from Horace Walpole.<br>
<br>Tindal committed suicide by shooting himself with a musket in his residence at the Tower on 16 September 1804 while suffering from mental depression. He was to have joined his wife on the day of his suicide, when she was staying with an aunt in Exeter. A verdict of lunacy was returned by the coroner's court, amid scurrilous rumours regarding his wife's conduct, which were vehemently denied by Tindal's friends.<br>
