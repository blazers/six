<span class="headword">Whittington,  Robert</span>  (<em>c.</em>1480&#150;1553?), <span class="occ">schoolmaster and grammarian</span>, described himself as a man of Lichfield, Staffordshire, and was probably born in or near the city; his surname is that of an adjoining village. He was a pupil of the grammarian John Stanbridge, perhaps at Lichfield Cathedral school, and is plausibly identical with the Robert Whittington ordained acolyte in Lichfield Cathedral in 1496, and subdeacon there in 1503, to an ordination title provided by Ranton Priory, Staffordshire. He probably became a priest in 1504. Meanwhile, about 1499 he began to study rhetoric and in 1501 to teach as a schoolmaster. These facts emerged when, in 1513, he petitioned the University of Oxford to allow him to be laureated as a rhetorician and to wear silk in his hood, a request granted on condition that he composed one hundred verses of poetry. As Whittington adduced only his rhetorical study and teaching to support his application, it looks as if he had not undertaken significant studies at a university, and there are no grounds for Anthony Wood's assertion that he was taught by Stanbridge at Magdalen College School, Oxford, in the early 1490s.<br>
<br>During the 1510s Whittington appears to have taught in London, while striving to gain the attention of important people. About 1519 he presented Cardinal Wolsey with a manuscript (Bodl. Oxf., MS Bodley 523) containing a treatise in verse, &#145;De difficultate justiciae servandae in reipublicae administratione&#146;, and a prose &#145;Panegyricus de quattuor virtutibus cardineis&#146;, with a dedication requesting Wolsey's patronage. In the same year he published <span class="italic">Libellus epigrammaton</span>, an anthology of poems addressed to Henry VIII, Wolsey, Thomas More, and John Skelton. His <span class="italic">Vulgaria</span>, published in 1520, pays compliments to the late king, Henry VII, to Thomas Linacre, and to More himself, who is famously referred to as &#145;a man for all seasons&#146;. Whittington's efforts succeeded by 1523, at the latest, when he enjoyed the favour of Henry VIII. It is likely that he succeeded Francis Philip in that year as schoolmaster to the henchmen, the noble youths of the royal household, and he certainly held this appointment from Michaelmas 1528 until Christmas 1538. He also occupied a succession of benefices, including the vicarage of Mancetter, Warwickshire, from 1514 until about the 1520s; the rectory of Bedhampton, Hampshire, from an unknown date to 1523; and the rectory of Drayton Parslow, Buckinghamshire, from 1523. The latter two were both in the gift of the king. He was a canon and prebendary of the collegiate church of Warwick from at least 1535 until its dissolution in 1544, and in 1538 Henry VIII presented him to the valuable rectory of Stoke-on-Trent, enabling him to relinquish his household post. His career was a prosperous one by the standards of most early Tudor schoolmasters. In the 1520s his annual gross income was over &pound;30, including &pound;20 as schoolmaster of the henchmen, and this rose to more than &pound;60 after 1538, Stoke-on-Trent being worth some &pound;40.<br>
<br>Whittington was famous in his day as the author of elementary Latin school books. The list (with first known dates of printing) includes <span class="italic">De nominum generibus</span> (1511), <span class="italic">Declinationes nominum</span> (<i>c</i>.1511), <span class="italic">De heteroclitis nominibus</span> (<i>c</i>.1511), <span class="italic">Syntaxis</span> (2nd edn, 1512), <span class="italic">De syllabarum quantitate</span> (2nd edn, <i>c</i>.1512), <span class="italic">De octo partibus orationis</span> (<i>c</i>.1514), <span class="italic">De synonymis</span> together with <span class="italic">De magistratibus veterum Romanorum</span> (1515), <span class="italic">Vulgaria</span> (English and Latin sentences for translation, 1520), and <span class="italic">Verborum preterita et supina</span> (1521). He also edited John Stanbridge's <span class="italic">Accidence</span> (<i>c</i>.1515). The earliest of these works seems to go back to at least 1510, since <span class="italic">Syntaxis</span> includes a dedication to Stanbridge (who died in that year) and a complimentary Latin poem by him. Each title dealt with a different aspect of grammar, and they could be bought individually and cheaply; as such they were widely sold and frequently republished up to the early 1530s. Their author seems to have had a high opinion of his own abilities. When William Horman published another large <span class="italic">Vulgaria</span> in 1519, with commendatory verses by his friend William Lily, high master of St Paul's School, London, Whittington posted verses on the door of Lily's school, ridiculing the size and price of Horman's volume and Lily's judgement in endorsing it. This led to the so-called &#145;grammarians' war&#146;, in which Lily and Horman published a two-part attack on Whittington, called <span class="italic">Antibossicon</span> (1521), so named because it identified him with the bear-shaped water-tap in Billingsgate, London, built by his namesake Sir Richard Whittington. They criticized Whittington's abilities as a poet and grammarian, and mocked his descriptions of himself, in his books, as &#145;of Lichfield, master of grammar, and chief poet of England (<i>prothovates Anglie</i>), laureated in the most flourishing academy of Oxford&#146;. Whittington rejoined with a tract of his own against Lily, called <span class="italic">Antilycon</span> (&#145;Against the wolf&#146;), and the 1521 edition of his <span class="italic">De nominum generibus</span> contains further attacks and a motto promising that &#145;he will humiliate the slanderer&#146;.<br>
<br>Whittington's grammars continued to be printed during the 1520s, usually by Wynkyn de Worde but briefly also by Richard Pynson. About 1529, however, Whittington seems to have moved his custom to Peter Treveris, who issued his works for the next two years. This arrangement was not satisfactory, and by 1533 Whittington had returned to Worde, his school books now including Latin verses attacking Treveris. Worde, however, ceased to issue Whittington's works after 1534, because of difficulty with the author or falling demand, and Whittington turned his attention to translation from Latin into English. He brought out versions of Erasmus's <span class="italic">De civilitate morum puerilium</span> (1532), three works by Cicero (<span class="italic">De officinis</span>, 1534; <span class="italic">Paradoxa</span>, <i>c</i>.1534; and <span class="italic">De senectute</span>, <i>c</i>.1535), and three allegedly by Seneca (<span class="italic">The Forme and Rule of Honest Lyvynge</span>, 1546; <span class="italic">The Myrrour or Glasse of Maners</span>, 1547; and <span class="italic">De remediis fortuitorum</span>, 1547), the <span class="italic">Forme</span> and <span class="italic">Myrrour</span> being correctly by Martin of Braga. His two remaining benefices of Drayton Parslow and Stoke-on-Trent were both filled by new incumbents in the autumn of 1553, and, though the appointments do not mention his previous tenure, it is likely that he died in possession of them in the summer of that year.<br>
