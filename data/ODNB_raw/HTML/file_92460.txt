<span class="headword">Hentzner,  Paul</span>  (1558&#150;1623), <span class="occ">writer and traveller</span>, was born on 29 January 1558 in Krossen, Silesia, now part of southern Poland. His personal life is obscure, but he is said to have trained as a lawyer, and this is in keeping with the title page of his <span class="italic">Itinerarium Germaniae, Galliae, Angliae, Italiae</span>, which styles him jurisconsult, and a counsellor to Duke Karl of Munsterberg-Ols. This book constitutes his principal claim to fame. A journal of his travels in Germany, France, England, and Italy between 1596 and 1600, it was first published at Nuremberg in 1612; at least two more Latin editions followed, one printed at Wroc&#322;aw in 1617 and the other at Nuremberg in 1629. The English portion of his travels was first translated into English by the younger Richard Bentley and published by Horace Walpole from his Strawberry Hill press in October 1757 as <span class="italic">A Journey into England by Paul Hentzner, in the Year M.D.XC.VIII</span>. Walpole printed only 220 copies, but the <span class="italic">London Magazine</span> and <span class="italic">Monthly Review</span> published extracts from it in November and December of the same year, to Walpole's displeasure. It was also reprinted at least four times between 1761 and 1771 in the volume <span class="italic">Fugitive Pieces on Various Subjects</span>, edited by Robert Dodsley, issued in a combined edition with Robert Naunton's <span class="italic">Fragmenta regalia</span> in 1797, and enjoyed several nineteenth- and twentieth-century editions and reprints.<br>
<br>Hentzner's tour of Europe has been described as his &#145;journeyman's travels&#146; following the completion of his legal training, and his book as a &#145;scholarly report&#146;; he is also said to have been the first writer to publish a book detailing a European tour. In his own epistle dedicatory to the <span class="italic">Itinerarium</span> Hentzner recommends travel as an excellent way of expanding one's knowledge through personal observation of the world. He set out on his journeys from Wroc&#322;aw on 5 May 1596, apparently as a &#145;travelling tutor&#146; to Christopher Rehdiger, the son of a noble family of Striesa. In 1596 and 1597 they travelled in parts of Germany and Switzerland, wintering first at Strasbourg and then at Geneva, while at the end of 1598 they stayed in Basel. Their choice of these three cities strongly suggests that like many of his compatriots Hentzner was protestant in religion, though he makes no declaration on the point in his book. In May 1598 he and his pupil left Geneva for France. Their companions during the journeys that followed included David Stzrela, described by Hentzner as &#145;the noble Bohemian&#146;, and his tutor, Tobias Salander, a &#145;doctor of physic&#146;  (Hentzner, <span class="italic">Journey</span>, 36, 97). At the end of their stay in England Stzrela fell ill at Gravesend, and subsequently died &#145;of a violent fever in London&#146;, as Salander informed Hentzner  (ibid., 97).<br>
<br>Hentzner and his company made an extended tour through France that lasted for over three months, and it was only on 28 August that they crossed the channel from Dieppe to Rye; Hentzner was seasick during the voyage. At some point after their landing they met up with Vil&eacute;m Slavata, a member of an ancient Bohemian family, who later made a more lasting mark on the historical record as one of the imperial ministers thrown from a window in the &#145;defenestration of Prague&#146; of 1618. He was carrying letters for Queen Elizabeth which he presented to her at Greenwich, and Hentzner noted that she removed her glove and gave Slavata her bejewelled right hand to kiss, &#145;a mark of particular favour&#146;  (Hentzner, <span class="italic">Journey</span>, 50). Hentzner's description of the ageing Elizabeth has become famous:<blockquote>very majestic; her face oblong, fair, but wrinkled; her eyes small, yet black and pleasant; her nose a little hooked; her lips narrow, and her teeth black; &hellip; her hands were small, her fingers long, and her stature neither tall nor low; her air was stately, her manner of speaking mild and obliging. (ibid., 48&#150;9)</blockquote>He also details the ceremony surrounding the queen, for instance the retinue accompanying her to prayers, the ritual preparation of her table, and the obeisance given to her chair by her attendants even when it was empty. Like other foreign visitors to England, he was struck by the reverence shown to Elizabeth, observing that &#145;wherever she turned her face, as she was going along, every body fell down on their knees&#146;, and says that people spoke to her from their knees, unless she raised them with her hand  (ibid., 50). Horace Walpole was enchanted by Hentzner's account of the queen, declaring that &#145;her best portraits scarcely exhibit a more lively image&#146;  (ibid., i).<br>
<br>Hentzner's account of his English travels during August and September 1598 combines several features, being in part a history lesson, in part a geographical and topographical sketch, and in part a guidebook. His section on London includes information about the founding and naming of the city, the course and tidal nature of the Thames, and descriptions of sights like London Bridge, where he and his companions counted the heads displayed on iron spikes&#151;there were more than thirty&#151;and the wooden theatres just outside the city walls. He devotes considerable space to the tombs in St Paul's Cathedral and Westminster Abbey, though his faulty transcriptions of their inscriptions make him in this respect an unreliable source. He carefully catalogues the items of interest in the royal residences of Whitehall, Hampton Court, Windsor, and the Tower, but also comments on social customs, like the ceremonies associated with the lord mayor's office, and the revels that accompanied the bringing in of the harvest near Windsor. Hentzner names each city through which his party travelled, adding commentary for notable towns like Oxford and Cambridge, where he recorded the founders and dates of foundation of each college, and the style of student life&#151;almost monastic, he thought. He commented that they could not see the private apartments at Theobalds, Lord Burghley's great mansion, &#145;as the family was in town attending the funeral of their lord&#146; (he had died on 4 August), but they were given a tour of the elegant gardens, which included a summer house containing statues of &#145;the twelve Roman emperors in white marble&#146;  (Hentzner, <span class="italic">Journey</span>, 54&#150;5). Hentzner was also interested in the smaller details of English life: it was in the Hertfordshire town of Puckeridge that he and his companions first &#145;observed that the beds at inns were made by the waiters&#146;  (ibid., 55), while at Ampthill he was impressed by the enormous number of rabbits to be seen. Overall Hentzner's descriptions of the English are idiosynscratic, but intriguing:<blockquote>they are good sailors and better pirates &hellip; more polite in eating than the French, devouring less bread, but more meat, which they roast in perfection &hellip; powerful in the field, successful against their enemies, impatient of anything like slavery; vastly fond of great noises that fill the ear. (ibid., 88&#150;9)</blockquote>.Hentzner consulted, and borrowed from, several sources to compose his travelogue, sometimes without acknowledgement. Clearly well read in classical authors, both Latin and Greek, he also makes direct reference to the writings of Paulus Jovius, Polydore Vergil, and Abraham Ortelius, and regularly directs the reader to Camden's <span class="italic">Britannia</span>, first published in 1586. Some later commentators have made fun of his renderings of English place names, Puckeridge as &#145;Bockritsch&#146; for instance, or Ampthill as &#145;Amtheil&#146;, and have drawn attention to his factual errors, like his dating the death of Lady Margaret Beaufort to 1463 instead of 1509. But despite these failings, Hentzner's simple commentary on the manners, pastimes, and rituals he observed at first hand remains a popular source for commentary on everything from the trumpets and kettledrums used to accompany the setting of Queen Elizabeth's table, to the smoking habits of Londoners, the strength of English beer, and even the hairstyles of late sixteenth-century Englishmen.<br>
<br>Hentzner's evident enjoyment of his experiences abroad gives charm and colour to his writing, and makes his travel book an interesting counterbalance to the more acerbic commentary provided by some other writers. Horace Walpole, who did so much to draw attention to the interest and value of Hentzner's <span class="italic">Itinerarium</span>, engagingly described him as a man with a &#145;laborious, and indiscriminate passion for SEEING&#146;, as well as one who &#145;enjoyed as much the doubtful head, of a more doubtful saint in pickle, as any upon the shoulders of the best Grecian statue&#146;  (Hentzner, <span class="italic">Journey</span>, iii&#150;iv).<br>
<br>Hentzner died on 1 January 1623.<br>
