<span class="headword">Ord,  Robert</span>  (1700&#150;1778), <span class="occ">politician</span>, baptized on 27 March 1701 at Newcastle upon Tyne, was one of the three sons and a daughter to survive from the thirteen children born to John Ord (<i>d</i>. 1721), solicitor, and his second wife, Anne Hutchinson. John Ord was under-sheriff for Newcastle from 1685 to 1703; his second wife brought a considerable fortune, with which he purchased Fenham, Newminster Abbey, and Hunstanworth. He also founded St John's School, Newcastle, for forty boys.<br>
<br>Robert Ord was educated at Lincoln's Inn in 1718, and called to the bar in 1724, having been elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1723. He inherited Hunstanworth at his father's death. He married in October 1727 Mary, daughter of Sir John Darnell, with whom he raised a son, <a href="#cosubject_20807">John Ord [<i>see below</i>]</a>, and five daughters.<br>
<br>In the election of 1734 Ord secured the Cornish seat of Mitchell, which he held until 1745, after which he sat for Morpeth, Northumberland, representing the interests of Henry Howard, fourth earl of Carlisle. He held, successively, the offices of secretary to the chancellor of the exchequer and deputy cofferer of the household. In 1755, supported by Carlisle and Hardwicke, he vacated his seat in the house to become chief baron of the Scottish exchequer. He thereupon moved north, where Boswell remarked on him: &#145;This respectable English judge will be long remembered in Scotland, where he built an elegant house, and lived in it magnificently. His own ample fortune, with the addition of his salary, enabled him to be splendidly hospitable&#146;  (<span class="italic">Boswell's Life of Johnson</span>, 5.28). Ord retired in 1775 and died in Edinburgh on 12 February 1778.<br>
<br>His son <a name="cosubject_20807"></a><span class="headword">John Ord</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1729, <em>d.</em> 1814), also a <span class="occ">politician</span>, was baptized on 11 October 1729. He went to school at Hackney and entered Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1746, graduating BA in 1751, holding a fellowship from 1752, proceeding MA in 1755, and meanwhile enrolling at Lincoln's Inn in 1747. In 1761 his father arranged for him to stand for parliament at Morpeth as the second candidate in Carlisle's interest, but he was rejected, the electorate preferring a second candidate unconnected with the Carlisle interests. He married, on 30 October 1762, Eleanor (1741&#150;1818), daughter of John Simpson of Bradley, co. Durham; there were no children of the marriage.<br>
<br>Ord next stood for parliament in 1774 when he was returned unopposed for Midhurst in Sussex. He supported the administration until the fall of Lord North. He transferred to the Hastings seat from 1780 to 1784, and served as chairman of the ways and means committee until the dismissal of the coalition. In 1783 he had voted for the second earl of Shelburne's peace preliminaries, and for Charles James Fox's <span class="roman">East India Bill</span>; by 1874 he was being classed as &#145;opposition&#146;. In the general election of 1784 he stood for Wendover, voting with the opposition, and he retired from parliament in 1790.<br>
<br>For many years Ord lived at Purser's Cross, near Fulham, where, according to the gardener John Loudon, his garden in 1756 &#145;contains a greater number of fine specimens in a very limited space than any garden we know of in the neighbourhood of London&#146;  (Loudon, 1.72&#150;3). This interest in horticulture led to his election as a member of the Horticultural Society, and in 1780 as a fellow of the Royal Society. He died at Purser's Cross on 6 June 1814 and was buried in Fulham churchyard.<br>
