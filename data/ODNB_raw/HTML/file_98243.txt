<span class="headword">Staples,  Robert Ponsonby</span>  (1784/5&#150;1852), <span class="occ">consul and merchant in Buenos Aires and Mexico</span>, was born Robert Staples in Ireland, probably at Lissan, co. Tyrone, the fourth son of John Staples (1736&#150;1820) and his second wife, Henrietta, daughter of the third Viscount Molesworth (1745&#150;1813). His father sat as a member of the Irish parliament from 1765 to 1800, and briefly in the United Kingdom parliament in 1801&#150;2, was a commissioner of customs and of excise, and was examinator of the Dublin customs from 1794 until his death.<br>
<br>In his early twenties Staples sought his fortune in the recently opened South American republics. He was resident in Rio de Janeiro in 1809, representing the Belfast trading firm of Montgomery, Staples &amp; Co. After establishing himself in Buenos Aires in 1810 he became associated with another British merchant, John McNeile, with whom he set up a jerked beef company, Staples, McNeile &amp; Co. In March 1811 he was appointed &#145;His Majesty's Consul at Buenos Ayres and its Dependencies&#146;  (<span class="italic">London Gazette</span>, 19 March 1811), the first British consul to be appointed to one of the new South American republics after the collapse of the Spanish American empire. His position was never officially recognized in Buenos Aires, whose new government received no response to letters addressed to the British government, which until 1823 had a policy of neutrality towards the Latin American republics, over which Spain still claimed sovereignty.<br>
<br>In April 1812 Staples returned to Britain, where he tried unsuccessfully to persuade the Foreign Office to appoint him confidential agent to the River Plate. The only concessions he received from the Foreign Office were the granting of &pound;1200 as compensation for the failure of his appointment as consul and a contract to procure bullion for the Treasury. In November 1813 he was back in Buenos Aires, where he resumed his commercial activities and in 1815 married Eliza Leonora Russell (1787/8&#150;1871). At a public meeting on 15 July 1816 the British merchants in Buenos Aires asked him to represent them in an official capacity. In return, they undertook to remunerate him on the basis of the invoice value and tonnage of goods imported in British vessels at Buenos Aires. Although having no official authority to do so, he acted as British consul in Buenos Aires until 1819, when the Foreign Office ordered him to cease doing so.<br>
<br>By 1820 Staples was back in London where he remained until at least 1822. In September 1822 a delegation sent by the Peruvian government, headed by the envoys and ministers plenipotentiary Don Juan Garcia del Rio and General James Paroissien, arrived in London on a mission to raise a loan of &pound;1.2 million. Staples entered partnership with the contractor for the loan, Thomas Kinder, and they sent an agent, Robert Proctor, to Peru to organize the transfer of funds between London and Lima, Proctor publishing an account of his travels there. Political change in Peru led to Kinder and Staples losing the loan contract to John Parish Robertson.<br>
<br>When the Foreign Office finally appointed consuls to Latin America, in October 1823, Staples received the minor posting of Acapulco and not Buenos Aires as he had hoped. Contrary to Foreign Office instructions that consuls should not enter into commercial transactions, Staples offered to lend money to the Mexican government, in association with Thomas Kinder, and was removed from his position in 1824, thus ending his diplomatic career. He became involved in a Mexican mining company, the Real del Monte Co., with his friend and partner Thomas Kinder, along with a new partner, Philip Chabot. The Real del Monte Co. was located some 30 miles from Mexico City and was launched on the market with shares each worth &pound;100. Within a few months their value had increased to &pound;240 but fell away and in 1831 the house of Robert Staples &amp; Co. collapsed. By early 1834 Staples was back in London, where he was declared insolvent. From that point Staples disappeared from the public and commercial arenas, though Mexican property transactions in which he was involved with Kinder were the subject of litigation in 1844. He died, aged sixty-seven, at his home, 10 Chesterfield Street, Mayfair, London, on 2 June 1852.<br>
