<span class="headword">Pine,  Catherine Emily</span>  (1864&#150;1941), <span class="occ">nurse and women's rights worker</span>, was born at 10 Ashford Road, Maidstone, on 7 May 1864, the daughter of Robert Pine, a corn merchant, and his wife, Anne Brett. Despite prolonged absences at various times, she seems to have maintained a Kentish connection throughout her life. Nothing is known of her childhood and youth. At the age of twenty-nine she undertook nursing training, registering as a probationer at St Bartholomew's, London. Although she failed her first-year examinations in May 1895, she retook them successfully in October 1895, and was awarded her certificate a year later. In February 1897 she was appointed staff nurse, being promoted to house sister in 1900, and later sister in charge of the nurses' home. She remained at St Bartholomew's until June 1907, when she left to start a clinic in Pembridge Gardens, Notting Hill, London, in partnership with Gertrude Townend, who had also gained her nursing qualifications at St Bartholomew's before moving to the Great Ormond Street Hospital for Sick Children.<br>
<br>The clinic had immediate connections with the women's suffrage movement. With the increase in suffrage militancy, it became a recuperation centre for suffragettes recovering from hunger striking and forcible feeding. Sister Pine's increasingly close relationship with Emmeline Pankhurst led to Emmeline's son Harry being sent to the clinic, where he died of poliomyelitis in 1910. By this time sisters Pine and Townend were becoming deeply implicated in the lawbreaking aspect of the militant action of the Women's Social and Political Union; for example, in March 1912, they helped Christabel Pankhurst escape from arrest by providing her with a nurse's uniform and access to a friend's house, and similarly aided Sylvia Pankhurst when she was secretly setting out to visit Christabel in Paris. Above all, together with Dr Flora Murray, they cared for Emmeline Pankhurst when she was out of prison recovering from the effects of hunger striking. Sister Pine in particular virtually became part of the Pankhurst household.<br>
<br>In the First World War, Emmeline Pankhurst attempted to set an example of care by adopting four female &#145;war babies&#146;, who were in fact placed in the care of Sister Pine at a house in London rented by Emmeline Pankhurst, first in Mecklenburgh Square, then at 50 Clarendon Road, Holland Park: their names were Kathleen King, Mary Gordon, Joan Pembridge, and Elizabeth (Betty) Tudor; Betty was later adopted by Christabel and given the name of Aurea Pankhurst. At this time the eminent physician Chetham Strode became a friend of the household, although (according to Dame Ethel Smyth) Sister Pine's down-to-earth remedies proved more efficacious than his sophisticated ones on at least one occasion.<br>
<br>In 1917 the household moved to Tower Cressy, a large house on Campden Hill, not far from Holland Park. Emmeline Pankhurst, possibly on the advice of Christabel, introduced the Montessori system for educating the girls, a programme for which the traditionally minded Sister Pine, charged with implementing it, seems to have had little sympathy. The girls certainly appeared to find &#145;Aunt Kate&#146; very strict. In 1919 the household moved to a cottage in Peaslake, Surrey, and later in the year Emmeline travelled to North America taking Sister Pine with her. They were later joined by Kathleen, Mary, and Joan, and in 1921 by Christabel and Aurea. While Emmeline toured Canada and the United States lecturing, Sister Pine and the girls lived in Canada, first in Victoria, British Columbia, then in Toronto.<br>
<br>In 1923 Sister Pine returned to Britain for good. She had kept up her professional training, and when the state register of nurses was introduced in 1922, she was among the earliest to join. She was registered as holding a post at the Cottage Hospital, Herne Bay, Kent.<br>
<br>From this time again nothing seems to be known of Sister Pine's life; she attended Emmeline Pankhurst's funeral in July 1928, and then dropped out of sight. She died of a stroke at St Neot's, Finsbury Extra, Rochester, Kent, on 14 August 1941.<br>
