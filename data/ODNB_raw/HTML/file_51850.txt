<span class="headword">Collin,  Mary</span>  (1860&#150;1955), <span class="occ">headmistress</span>, was born in Cambridge on 1 April 1860, the daughter of William Collin. Educated at a private school in Cambridge and at Notting Hill High School for Girls, London, she graduated in honours French and German at Bedford College, London. She taught for a time on the staff of her former school and of Jersey Ladies' College, and in 1884 went as second mistress to Nottingham high school, another of the schools founded by the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/94164', "Girls' Public Day School Company")</script>. In 1892 she became principal of St Catherine's School in Park Place, Cardiff.<br>
<br>Miss Collin's experience both as a pupil and as a teacher had been until that point within the private sector of girls' education. When, under the far-reaching and visionary <span class="roman">Welsh Intermediate Education Act</span> of 1889, it was decided to set up a municipal secondary school for girls in Cardiff, Miss Collin was appointed as its first head in 1895.<br>
<br>Miss Collin was a dignified figure, a fine-looking, attractive woman with sparkling blue eyes, which twinkled with merriment or bore down on wrongdoers as the occasion demanded. Contemporaries invariably commented on her sharp intellect, her integrity, and delightful sense of humour. The girls of Cardiff high school regarded her with awe, respect, and affection. Her achievement as headmistress is impressive. Drawing her inspiration from the public and high schools of England, she turned what had originally been designated as Cardiff Intermediate and Technical School for Girls into a first class girls' high school. She promoted high standards and an academic ethos within the school. She extended the curriculum to include the sciences, not then usually considered appropriate for girls, and she devoted much time to encouraging extra-curricular activities. Although criticized by some contemporaries as &eacute;litist because she was reluctant to accept girls from elementary schools, under her autocratic but benign regime the numbers rose from ninety-four girls in 1895 to more than 400 on her retirement in 1924, making Cardiff high the largest girls' school in Wales.<br>
<br>Influenced by Harriet Morant Jones, headmistress at Notting Hill, an early pioneer of girls' secondary education and third president of the Association of Headmistresses, following Miss Buss and Miss Beale, Mary Collin was a committed feminist. The education of girls in Wales profited from the wealth of experience she brought with her and which she had gained in the formative years of its development in England. She assisted many Welsh educational organizations, always promoting the cause of girls and women, including the Association of Welsh Head Teachers, the University of Wales, and the Central Welsh Board. The University of Wales awarded her the degree of MA for services to Welsh education in 1925.<br>
<br>A &#145;new woman&#146; in the 1890s, who shocked the Cardiff tradespeople by riding a bicycle, and a dedicated and tireless suffrage campaigner, Mary Collin worked throughout her life to promote the cause of women. An admirer of Mrs Fawcett, whom she recalled from her Cambridge childhood, she aligned herself with the moderate wing of the suffrage campaign and became the acknowledged leader of the women's suffrage movement in Cardiff. She was for many years the &#145;chairman [<i>sic</i>] of executive&#146; of Cardiff and District Women's Suffrage Society. During the First World War the Cardiff society, under her guidance, suspended its activities and threw itself into the war effort and into helping the local community to cope with the difficulties created by the war. She played an active part in assisting unemployed women and women war workers, and enthusiastically engaged in the recruitment of women to the women's auxiliary services: she held recruiting meetings at the school and, to set an example to others, released her own two domestic servants to join the Women's Army Auxiliary Corps. At the end of the war, she resumed her suffrage activities and continued to play a leading role in the newly reconstituted Cardiff Women's Citizens' Association, which in 1921 replaced the suffrage society. In the inter-war years she campaigned vigorously on such issues as widows' pensions and women police, and throughout her life pressed for the involvement of more women on public bodies.<br>
<br>Mary Collin died on 22 July 1955 at St David's Hospital, Cardiff. She retained close contacts with the school until the end and, mindful of the continuity of Cardiff high, bequeathed in her will the treasured album bearing the names of old girls which she had received on her retirement in 1924. She died in the school's diamond jubilee year.<br>
