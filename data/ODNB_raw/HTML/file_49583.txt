<span class="headword">Blaxter, Sir  Kenneth Lyon</span>  (1919&#150;1991), <span class="occ">animal nutritionist</span>, was born at Egbert House, Wroxham Road, Sprowston, Norfolk, on 19 June 1919, the son of Gaspard Culling Blaxter, a handicraft teacher who ran a smallholding, and his wife, Charlotte Ellen, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Lyon. He was educated at the City of Norwich School and left at the age of fifteen to take up an appointment as a clerk with the Norwich Union Life Assurance Society. Drawn to agricultural science as a career, K. B. (as he was universally known) undertook an honours course in agricultural science at Reading University from 1936 to 1939. After graduation he was appointed as an assistant to Professor H. D. Kay, then director of the National Institute for Research in Dairying in Shinfield, Reading, and under Kay's direction he became closely involved in the national policy for feeding high yield dairy cows, investigating the use of iodinated casein for this purpose. After service in the Royal Artillery (1940&#150;41) he returned to the institute and was then seconded to the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries' Veterinary Research Institute, Weybridge, and joined the team of Green and Alcroft in studies on the significance of trace elements such as copper and cobalt. His own studies on the toxicity of lead in feed for ruminant livestock were many years later still recognized as the outstanding papers on that subject. He obtained his PhD from Reading University in 1944 for a thesis, &#145;The maintenance of the winter milk supply in wartime&#146;. On 23 February 1946 he married Edith Klara Goeritz (<i>b</i>. 1917/18), a scientific assistant at the Imperial Bureau of Dairy Science, and daughter of Siegfried Goeritz, a leather goods manufacturer. There were no children of the marriage, which ended in divorce in 1952.<br>
<br>In August 1946 Blaxter was awarded a Commonwealth fellowship to study under Professor H. H. Mitchell at Illinois University, USA. Mitchell was recognized throughout the world as one of the outstanding animal nutritionists of his time, with a particular interest in establishing the nutrient requirements of farm livestock on a scientific basis. It was at the Illinois campus at Urbana that Blaxter developed his subsequent interest in the dominant role played by energy in ruminant animals' metabolism, and its role in determining protein and other nutrient requirements in general. Mitchell's postgraduate taught courses in nutrition were immensely stimulating and Blaxter took an active part in these.<br>
<br>On returning to the UK in 1947 Blaxter was appointed to the headship of the nutrition department of the Hannah Dairy Research Institute, Ayr, and thus began his hands on research interest in energy metabolism of ruminant livestock. The wide range of related studies bore testimony to his tireless energy, his inquiring mind, and his ability to direct the research work of his nutrition department staff. Subjects for study ranged from nutritional disorders of calves, with particular reference to magnesium deficiency, to vitamin E and selenium and their significance in relation to muscular dystrophy of calves. These were additional to his major interest in the utilization of feed energy by ruminants, the environmental effects upon their energy requirements and feed energy utilization, and studies affecting feed intake by ruminants. For his energy studies Blaxter designed, constructed, and used four 24 hour respiration chambers for sheep and goats, and one for steers. Although Blaxter had had no formal training in mathematics he recognized the powerful contribution that appreciation of mathematical studies could make to the analysis of biological data, and was soon recognized as a world authority in its application to the data obtained at the Hannah Institute. In this he was greatly encouraged by Lord Rothschild, who was at that time chairman of the UK's Agricultural Research Council. Dr H. Ruben, a mathematician, was seconded to work at the Hannah Institute in the early days of Blaxter's headship.<br>
<br>On 12 October 1957 Blaxter married Mildred Lillington Hall (1925&#150;2010) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/102533/', "Blaxter, Mildred Lillington")</script>], daughter of Robert Charlton Hall, a bank manager. She had a degree in English literature from Oxford and subsequently took a first-class honours degree in sociology at Aberdeen University. They had three children, all of whom entered the field of biology: Alison (the eldest) trained as a veterinary surgeon, Mark became a molecular biologist working in the field of medicine, and Piers a conservation officer in the outer islands of Scotland. Mildred was appointed to the Sociology Research Institute at Aberdeen University and became one of the most respected and active workers in the field of sociology research, a fact of which Blaxter was immensely proud.<br>
<br>At the Hannah, largely on the basis of work carried out by himself and his colleagues, Blaxter formulated the early developments of a feed evaluation system for ruminants which he greatly extended during his later work at the Rowett Research Institute, Bucksburn, Aberdeen, where he was appointed director in 1965 in succession to Sir David Cuthbertson. At that time the principal objective of the institute was to establish research aimed at providing the Scottish farmer with knowledge of direct assistance to him, with particular reference to the Scottish livestock industry. With great enthusiasm Blaxter took aboard this continuing objective of the Rowett. In this regard it is relevant to note that in addition to academic degrees he held national diplomas in agriculture (NDA) and in dairying (NDD); at the same time he realized the importance of maintaining and expanding basic research. Thus the programme under Blaxter was a wide-ranging one, including subjects as varied as branched chain fatty acids, interactions of trace elements, muscle protein and collagen syntheses, the biochemistry of cell walls, and (of major interest to Blaxter) continuing work on energy utilization by ruminants and feed evaluation. From the vastly increased knowledge concerning feed energy utilization Blaxter made further advances in his feed evaluation system. From a practical point of view he was also a great exponent of the red deer project&#151;the farming for venison of red deer&#151;which he considered was the first large ungulate of temperate regions to be domesticated for thousands of years. In conjunction with the Hill Farming Research Organisation he published a monograph on the progress made in this field.<br>
<br>Blaxter retired from the directorship of the Rowett Research Institute in 1982 (becoming an honorary research associate) and he and his wife moved from Aberdeen, taking up residence at Stradbroke Hall, Stradbroke, near Eye, Suffolk. In 1982 he was appointed member and then chairman of the Individual Merit Promotion Panel responsible to the cabinet office, a post he held until the panel was disbanded in the early 1990s. During his retirement he became increasingly involved in the question of world food supply, and was very much in demand as a speaker. His immensely busy career is well reflected in the following facts: he published more than 300 original research papers, gave sixteen nominated lectures, published four textbooks, and was given eleven honours and awards in addition to being knighted in 1977. He was elected a fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1965 (president from 1979 to 1982) and fellow of the Royal Society in 1967. He will always be remembered as one of the foremost world authorities in the field of animal nutrition. His influence extended far beyond the nutrition of man and animals, although underlying the ability to be so farsighted was his love of agriculture and the practical aspects of farming in the UK&#151;a characteristic rare in so many agricultural scientists of his time. He died at his home, Stradbroke Hall, of a brain tumour on 18 April 1991, and was buried three days later. He was survived by his second wife and his three children. A memorial service was held in King's College chapel, Aberdeen University, on 30 September 1991.<br>
