<span class="headword">Avory, Sir  Horace Edmund</span>  (1851&#150;1935), <span class="occ">judge</span>, was born at 3 Pitts Place, Southwark, London, on 31 August 1851, the second son of Henry Avory (1826&#150;1881), a solicitor who was clerk of the court at the central criminal court from 1860 until his death, and his wife, Margaret Kemp. He was educated at Gothic House College in Clapham, then at King's College, London, and Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, where he was a scholar. Captain of the college boat club in 1872, he was awarded a third class in the law and history tripos the following year. He was called to the bar (Inner Temple) in 1875 and joined the chambers of Edward Thomas Edmonds Besley, a leader of the criminal bar. On 18 April 1877 he married Maria Louisa (<i>d</i>. 1937), daughter of Henry Castle, a timber merchant, of Kingston, Surrey. They had two children, a son and a daughter.<br>
<br>Avory practised on the south-eastern circuit and regularly appeared, both as prosecutor and as defending counsel, at the Old Bailey, not at that time acknowledged as a training ground for aspiring judges. It none the less gave him the opportunity to &#145;devil&#146; for leading practitioners such as Sir Harry Bodkin Poland, Montagu Williams, and Sir Edward Clarke. Though not the most eloquent of advocates, he was a sound, even bold, lawyer whose practice grew rapidly. In 1889 he became a Treasury counsel (from 1899 the senior prosecuting counsel) at the central criminal court, and for the next twelve years he was engaged in most of the important criminal trials in London. He advised the director of public prosecutions on the Cleveland Street male brothel scandal, the notorious case (1889&#150;90) involving telegraph boys which implicated Lord Arthur Somerset. He also prosecuted in many notable trials, including that of Oscar Wilde in 1895, the Jameson raid plotters in 1896, and those of Adolph Beck the same year and Horatio Bottomley in 1909. He also gave evidence to the committee of inquiry in 1904 into Beck's wrongful conviction and was exonerated from any blame. His objection, upheld by the judge, to a certain line of cross-examination was later said to have been partly responsible for the miscarriage of justice.<br>
<br>Appointed king's counsel in 1901, Avory was an immediate success as a leader. He appeared in many of the major fraud trials of his generation, including the Liverpool Bank case (1902) and the prosecution of Whitaker Wright (1904). Judges listened attentively to his precise arguments and juries appreciated the clarity with which he put his clients' cases to them. Apart from crime, he also handled running down, defamation, licensing, and other judicial review cases. As junior to William Robson, later lord of appeal in ordinary, he also appeared for Earl Russell at the latter's House of Lords trial for bigamy (1901).<br>
<br>Before his elevation to the judicial bench, Avory was appointed recorder of Kingston (1902; an unpaid post), a bencher of the Inner Temple from 1908, and commissioner of assize for the south-east and northern circuits in 1909 and 1910, respectively. He was appointed to the King's Bench and knighted in October 1910. Indeed it is as a trial judge that Avory will be best remembered. Many of his cases became <i>causes c&eacute;l&egrave;bres</i>, such as the &#145;trial at bar&#146; (the fiction that all King's Bench judges were sitting) of Sir Roger Casement, when he sat with Lord Chief Justice Reading and Mr Justice Horridge. Described as a dignified and courteous judge who discouraged levity, prolixity, and irrelevance and who preferred to limit his judicial interventions with counsel and witnesses, he was none the less subsequently criticized, in a libel case linked to the Oscar Wilde controversy, for taking &#145;every opportunity of telling F. E. Smith [whom he disliked], who of course could not retaliate, that he was straying from the point, or was out of order&#146;  (Buckmaster, 96). His legal directions are entitled to respect, though an early direction in 1911 on corroborative evidence was overturned by the court of criminal appeal. In 1928 his refusal to allow separate trials for the accused murderers Frederick Guy Browne and William Henry Kennedy, after the latter had denied any active part in the shooting of PC Gutteridge, was strongly contested by Kennedy's counsel but his ruling was upheld at the men's unsuccessful appeal. When, as in the Patrick Mahon murder trial in 1924, he exercised his discretion under the <span class="roman">Sex Disqualification (Removal) Act</span> 1919 to remove women from the jury, his motive was no doubt his misplaced sense of chivalry. The pathologist Sir Bernard Spilsbury had described the murder scene as the most gruesome he had ever experienced.<br>
<br>Avory's summing up to juries was usually a model of lucidity and accuracy and he was invariably unsympathetic to sentimental appeals. Although both Browne and Kennedy, before being sentenced to death, declared from the dock that they had received a fair trial, Avory was the recipient of more threatening letters than any other judge. Such missives did not disconcert him. He treated them as a joke and even preserved them in a scrapbook. His manner in court was certainly cold and at times stern and he was not averse to imposing heavy sentences, for example, the maximum of fourteen years' penal servitude (upheld, indeed effectively increased by a few weeks, on appeal) on a City fraudster, Clarence Hatry, in 1930. As a member of the divisional court, his knowledge of magistrates' law was invaluable while in the court of criminal appeal his opinion often influenced the other members of the court, for example, his round condemnation of Mr Justice McCardie's eccentric outburst at the Griffiths trial in 1931.<br>
<br>On the retirement in 1923 of Sir Charles Darling, with whose courtroom theatricals and sense of humour Avory's restrained manner can be contrasted, the latter became senior judge of King's Bench. During the absence through ill health of Lord Hewart, the lord chief justice, he discharged the official duties of that office. In 1929 he became treasurer of the Inner Temple and in 1932 he was sworn of the privy council. He continued to sit in court regularly until his death, sixty years after his call to the bar.<br>
<br>Avory chaired a committee whose deliberations led to the codification of the perjury, forgery, and larceny laws in legislation of 1911, 1913, and 1916, respectively. He also influenced the shaping of other criminal law statutes, including the <span class="roman">Indictments Act</span> 1915, and the <span class="roman">Criminal Justice Act</span> 1925. The <span class="roman">Law of Evidence Act</span> 1938, passed after his death, owed much to his earlier involvement in a judicial committee whose establishment, on the initiative of Mr Justice Maugham, was agreed in 1931.<br>
<br>Awarded an honorary LLD by Cambridge University (1911), Avory became an honorary fellow of Corpus Christi College in 1912 and a fellow of King's College, London, the same year. His great sporting love was golf, though to his regret his devotion to the game did not extend to stretching the licensing laws to permit golfers to buy intoxicating liquor after their round of golf but before the permitted licensing hours (see <i>Brown v. Joyce</i>, 1931). While fellow members of the Pegasus, Garrick, and United University clubs found him a pleasant and amusing companion, he did not go out of his way to cultivate friendships and preferred a limited circle of friends. Small in physical stature, &#145;it was said of him that he was spare of flesh and sparing of compliments, but never spared criminals&#146;  (Browne and Tullett, 277). Yet although he was widely perceived as austere, stern, unbending, &#145;almost insignificant in appearance&#146;  (Hastings, 95)&#151;indeed he has even been described as being &#145;desiccated in appearance&#146;  (Jackson, 288)&#151;those who knew him well (and few did) insisted that appearances were deceptive and that he could be kindly and generous. Sir Patrick Hastings, attorney-general in the Labour government of 1924, and who had joined Avory's chambers at the start of his career, was one of these. Apart from valuing his kindness, he considered Avory both &#145;one of the great figures of the English Bar&#146; and a &#145;great Judge&#146;  (Hastings, 94, 124). It is indisputable that he was one of the more memorable judges of the twentieth century. However, a judge who, according to Travers Humphreys, saw the law both as his hobby (apart from golf) and as his profession perhaps enjoyed a more cloistered existence than others of his calling. He died in harness on 13 June 1935, of heart failure, at the Dormy House Club, Rye, Sussex, while on a golfing holiday, and was buried at Golders Green five days later.<br>
