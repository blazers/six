<span class="headword">Mills, Sir  John Lewis Ernest Watts</span>  (1908&#150;2005), <span class="occ">actor</span>, was born at Watts Naval Training School for Boys (a branch of Dr Barnardo's Homes) in Bintree, North Elmham, Norfolk, on 22 February 1908, the son of Lewis Mills (1867&#150;1953), schoolmaster, and later headmaster of the village school at Belton, Suffolk, and his wife, Edith Catherine, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Baker (1868&#150;1935). He had one sister, Edith Mabel, who later changed her name to Annette [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/65429/', "Mills, Annette (1894&#150;1955)")</script>]. Fourteen years older than John, Annette was a dancer and it was she who first encouraged his desire to be an actor. He was educated first at his father's school in Belton, then at Balham grammar school, London, followed by Sir John Leman High School, Beccles, Suffolk, and finally Norwich High School for Boys, where at first, being small for his age, he was bullied. On leaving school, where he had distinguished himself more on the playing field than in the classroom, he was forced to supplement family finances by taking a job as a clerk in Ipswich. During this time he joined both the Felixstowe Players and the local amateur dramatic society. With limited support from his father, now separated from his mother (who, like Annette, was enthusiastic about his chances in the theatre), he set off for London and what eventually became one of the longest careers in British show business; not, however, before a brief, unsuccessful stint as a door-to-door salesman for Sanitas Company, toiletry suppliers.<br>
<br>Mills began his stage career as a dancer, first appearing at the New Cross Empire with Frances Day, then in the chorus of <span class="italic">The Five O'Clock Girl</span> at the London Hippodrome in 1929. (Over forty years later, in 1973, he delighted theatre audiences with a complicated tap routine in a production of <span class="italic">The Good Companions</span>.) Joining a travelling company called The Quaints, he embarked in the same year on a tour of the Far East that would introduce two very influential people into his life. In Tientsin, China, he met <a href="#cosubject_96214">Mary Hayley Bell [<i>see below</i>]</a>, his doubles partner at tennis and, twelve years later, his second wife. The other meeting was professionally crucial: in Singapore, No&euml;l Coward saw the company's performance of <span class="italic">Journey's End</span>, and was impressed enough with the young actor playing Raleigh to have him in mind for roles in <span class="italic">Cavalcade</span> (1931) and the musical revue <span class="italic">Words and Music</span> (1932).<br>
<br>Mills retained a lifelong love of the theatre and returned to it throughout his career, but it is as a film actor that he made a greater mark. It is scarcely an exaggeration to say that he became the quintessential British film star. In the 1930s he appeared in twenty films, starting with the Jessie Matthews musical <span class="italic">The Midshipmaid</span> (1932), and perhaps most notably including <span class="italic">Brown on Resolution</span> (1935; reissued as <span class="italic">Forever England</span>), a naval adventure derived from C. S. Forester, and Mills's first major starring role in films. Most of his other films of the decade were unmemorable, though he was a likeable hero in <span class="italic">The Ghost Camera</span> (1933), drew engagingly on his song-and-dance skills in <span class="italic">Car of Dreams</span> (1935), and touchingly partnered Nova Pilbeam in the historical drama <span class="italic">Tudor Rose</span> (1936). On 12 March 1932 he had married the actress Aileen Cynthia Raymond (1910&#150;2005), with whom he had acted on the Far East tour. She was the daughter of George Raymond, medical practitioner. By the late 1930s the marriage had failed, and Mills re-met Mary Hayley Bell, now in England and recovering from a broken romance. They eventually married on 16 January 1941, after Mills and his first wife had divorced.<br>
<br>The Second World War made Mills a star. He had been coming along quite agreeably in the 1930s without making a great impression: pleasant-looking rather than handsome, shorter (at about 5 feet 6 inches) than most leading men, adept across several genres rather than a compelling hero in any particular one. Invalided out of the Monmouthshire regiment with an ulcer in 1941, he was lucky enough to be in a series of popular, prestigious films in which he established a new sort of Everyman hero in British cinema. He may have lacked the dash of Robert Donat or the suavity of David Niven or the sensual menace of James Mason, but what he did convey was an essential decency and loyalty, a reliability in crisis that was especially reassuring in the early 1940s, a modesty of bearing (making his slight frame work for him), and a courage that was the more impressive for being so understated. There was a chap-next-door ordinariness about his persona that struck some very responsive chords.<br>
<br>No&euml;l Coward, whom Mills claimed to have dubbed the Master, wrote the role of Shorty Blake with Mills in mind when he was preparing <span class="italic">In Which We Serve</span> (1942), a tribute to Lord Mountbatten's ship the <i>Kelly</i>, which had been sunk in the eastern Mediterranean. Mills's working-class boy who becomes a hero struck a true note in a film whose restraint later came to seem somewhat theatrical, and this was also true of his Billy Mitchell, who becomes a naval officer in the film of Coward's <span class="italic">This Happy Breed</span> (1944). Mills co-starred to convincing effect in both with Kay Walsh, then the wife of David Lean, who directed both and who would be a continuing influence in Mills's career. There were several other wartime films for Mills, including the submarine adventure <span class="italic">We Dive at Dawn</span> (1943) and the air force drama <span class="italic">The Way to the Stars</span> (1945), both for the director Anthony Asquith. The latter film, in production during the last months of the war but not released until after its end, was one of the most affecting films of the period, with Mills's reading of John Pudney's poem &#145;For Johnny&#146; to a comrade's widow (Rosamund John) a quietly emotional highlight. In <span class="italic">Waterloo Road</span> (1945), he played a soldier who goes absent without leave to protect his wife from the unwelcome attentions of a spiv-like lothario and cemented his reputation as the ordinary man who can rise to the occasion. In a very cleverly staged fight, short, slight Mills convincingly dealt with the much taller and heavier Stewart Granger.<br>
<br>It was as though these wartime roles had been preparing Mills for the post-war British cinema in which a new realism would predominate, at least in those films that brought most prestige to the industry. Mason and Granger would shortly defect to Hollywood but Mills remained a British star, only rarely venturing into American films. In his first post-war role, he was a definitive Pip in Lean's classic version of <span class="italic">Great Expectations</span> (1946). When, at the film's end, he rips down the curtains in Miss Havisham's decaying mansion, this can be seen as symbolic of shedding new light on ossified traditions&#151;and announcing a new sort of hero, not merely one who has risen in society but also one who will not be satisfied merely to perpetuate the past. In his next (and contrasting) post-war role, in <span class="italic">The October Man</span> (1947), Mills played Jim Ackland, a brain-damaged man who fears he may have killed someone: the murder inquiry is secondary to the &#145;internalised battle involving Jim's psychological problem&#146;  (Mayer, 102). Mills's versatility was being subtly confirmed in such roles, which allowed mutations on the Everyman persona without obliterating it. He might have made <span class="italic">Scott of the Antarctic</span> (1948) a less ponderous paean if he had been allowed to explore Scott's character in more human detail, but it was a high-profile film of its day and chosen for the royal film performance of the year. He was more interesting as Bassett, the groom, in <span class="italic">The Rocking Horse Winner</span> (1950), and as the meek little protagonist in <span class="italic">The History of Mr Polly</span> (1949), both of which he produced. Years later he said, &#145;I wasn't a very good producer because I was always trying to get on the floor and I didn't really like the office work&#146;  (McFarlane, <span class="italic">British Cinema</span>, 415).<br>
<br>The 1950s are often regarded, perhaps unfairly, as a dullish decade in British cinema, with too many films dealing in <span class="italic">Boy's Own</span> fashion with the war. Certainly Mills came in for his share of these, but he nevertheless brought his effortless-seeming authority to bear in such wartime adventures as <span class="italic">The Colditz Story</span> (1955), <span class="italic">Above Us the Waves</span> (1955), <span class="italic">I Was Monty's Double</span> (1958), and <span class="italic">Dunkirk</span> (1958). During this period he was unobtrusively shading into character roles, in such films as <span class="italic">The Long Memory</span> (1952), as a man released after twelve years in prison for a murder he didn't commit; <span class="italic">The End of the Affair</span> (1955), as a shabby private detective; <span class="italic">Tiger Bay</span> (1959), the film that made an instant star of his younger daughter, Hayley, and in which he played the police superintendent; and, best of all the war-based adventures, <span class="italic">Ice Cold in Alex</span> (1958), as the captain battling alcoholism and north African minefields. Earlier in the decade his association with David Lean reached another peak with his perfect incarnation of the bootmaker Willie Mossop in <span class="italic">Hobson's Choice</span> (1954): in this Mills most effectively married the twin aspects of his screen image, as both little man and hero of a kind.<br>
<br>The British &#145;new wave&#146; of the late 1950s and early 1960s passed Mills by, but he managed to give some of his most subtly honed performances in the character roles that prolifically did come his way. Two studies in resentful military types further attested to his protean abilities: his twitchy by-the-book lieutenant-colonel who clashes with the boisterous extrovert played by Alec Guinness in <span class="italic">Tunes of Glory</span> (1960) was a masterly study of neurotic repression; and two years later he mined some of this neurosis for social comedy in <span class="italic">Tiara Tahiti</span> (1962). His daughter Hayley's career was burgeoning rapidly and he directed her, though not with much success, in <span class="italic">Sky West and Crooked</span> (1966), from a screenplay by Mary Hayley Bell. Much more successful was <span class="italic">The Family Way</span> (1966), in which he played Hayley's father-in-law, and most movingly suggested that no relationship in his life had meant as much to him as that with his long-lost friend Billy.<br>
<br>Mills was in some poor films (with appearances in more than 100 films this was inevitable) and was sometimes miscast, as he was in <span class="italic">War and Peace</span> (1956), as a Russian peasant, or as an Australian cane-cutter in <span class="italic">Summer of the Seventeenth Doll</span> (1959). Some would also say that his Oscar-winning turn as the village idiot in Lean's Irish-set romance, the tedious <span class="italic">Ryan's Daughter</span> (1970), was a triumph that owed more to cosmetic than to histrionic art. Nevertheless, he could give stature to such modest films as <span class="italic">The Vicious Circle</span> (1957) and could imbue cameo roles in &#145;big&#146; films with a momentary presence, as he did in Kenneth Branagh's <span class="italic">Hamlet</span> (1996), as Old Norway, for whom Shakespeare had carelessly failed to provide dialogue. In his last film, <span class="italic">Bright Young Things</span> (2003), at the age of ninety-five, he was briefly vivid as a coke-snorting socialite. Throughout his long career in the British film industry he also continued to act on stage. Most memorably he and John Gielgud caused both outrage and hilarity with the profanities of their roles in Charles Wood's <span class="italic">Veterans</span> in 1972, the reactions to which he amusingly described in the television talk shows in which he frequently appeared in the 1990s and 2000s. No physical infirmity, including near-blindness towards the end, was allowed to stand in his way.<br>
<br>&#145;The family way&#146; might well describe the other path by which John Mills came to occupy such a secure place in filmgoers' affections and esteem. Both daughters, Juliet (<i>b</i>. 1941) and Hayley (<i>b</i>. 1946), went on to notable acting careers; his son Jonathan (<i>b</i>. 1949) was a screenwriter; while <a name="cosubject_96214"></a><span class="headword">Mary Hayley Bell</span>  (1911&#150;2005) continued to write, though she largely subordinated her aspirations to those of her husband and children. Born in Shanghai on 22 January 1911, the daughter of Francis Hayley Bell, an army officer and commissioner for maritime customs in China, and his American wife, Agnes (1878&#150;1960), she was educated first by a governess, then at Malvern Girls' College and the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art. She first appeared on stage in Shanghai in <span class="italic">The Barretts of Wimpole Street</span> (1932) and subsequently in several roles on Broadway and in the West End. She stopped acting following her marriage to Mills and turned her attention to writing. Her first performed play, <span class="italic">Men in Shadow</span> (1942), with Mills starring, had a substantial success at London's Vaudeville Theatre, as did her most famous play, <span class="italic">Duet for Two Hands</span> (1945, at the Lyric), in which Mills played a maimed poet on whom a surgeon unwittingly grafts a murderer's hands. She gradually lost interest in writing plays when they proved difficult to place, and turned her attention to other forms. Her most acclaimed work was the novel <span class="italic">Whistle Down the Wind</span> (1958), which was attractively filmed in 1961 by Bryan Forbes, with Hayley as one of the children who mistakes an escaped convict for Jesus Christ. She also wrote an autobiography, <span class="italic">What Shall We Do Tomorrow?</span> (1968), and a book about the family dog in 1981. Above all she concentrated her attention on domestic matters, raising three children and maintaining a marriage of legendary happiness and longevity. She suffered from vascular dementia in later years, and like Mills she also lost her sight, but they managed to walk down the aisle in a renewal of their marriage vows in 2001. She died on 1 December 2005 at their home, Four Gables, Village Road, Denham, Buckinghamshire, of heart failure.<br>
<br>Mills had predeceased his wife on 23 April 2005, also at Four Gables, following a stroke. He had been made a CBE in 1960 and knighted in 1976; his memoir, <span class="italic">Up in the Clouds, Gentlemen Please</span>, was published in 1980, followed by <span class="italic">Still Memories</span> in 2000; but his greatest achievements are fortunately preserved in the films in which he made his name and on which he conferred such distinction.<br>
