<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Rubens,  Bernice</span> <span class="st"> [<em>real name </em>Bernice Ruth Reuben]</span>  (1923&#150;2004), <span class="occ">author</span>, was born on 26 July 1923 at 9 Glossop Terrace in the poor Splott district of Cardiff, the third of the four children of Eli Reuben, a travelling tallyman (a seller of clothes on credit), and his wife, Dorothy, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Cohen. Her maternal grandfather, Wolf Cohen, a master tailor, had left Poland with only his sewing machine. Eli Reuben fled from Latvia carrying only two violins, one full-sized and one half-sized. He arrived in Cardiff thinking it was New York, for which he had purchased a passage from Hamburg. The Reubens were practising Orthodox and Zionist Jews, tightly embedded in Cardiff's close-knit Orthodox cousinhood. Never not conscious of being <i>Ostjuden</i> exiles from antisemitic terror, they were active in helping refugees from Hitler's Germany (they took in Hugo Gross, a boy from Hamburg, whose parents perished in Auschwitz, as an honorary son). Like their father, the children were very musical. Bernice's older brother Harold was a child piano prodigy; her older sister Beryl and younger brother Cecil became professional musicians (she played viola in the Welsh National Orchestra, he played first violin in the Liverpool Philharmonic and after that in the London Symphony Orchestra). The family &#145;listener&#146;, Bernice took up piano and cello&#151;refusing the small violin. She often said she would rather have been a professional musician than a writer. When writing she was wont to reward herself for good sentences with a short session on the cello.<br>
<br>Bernice Reuben attended local schools: Tredegarville and Roath Park infants' schools and, having passed the eleven-plus &#145;early&#146;, Cardiff High School for Girls. She went on to read English at University College, Cardiff. Her choice of subject was a mistake, she came to think: it was hampering to a would-be novelist to have Jane Austen and George Eliot looking over her shoulder. She graduated in July 1944, towards the end of the Second World War, during which the family narrowly escaped being bombed out. She taught briefly at Handsworth Grammar School for Boys (from which she was sacked for protesting at the head's use of corporal punishment); moved to London; and did bits of acting (her dance of the seven veils in a Peter Zadek production of <span class="italic">Salom&eacute;</span> stayed on as a favourite party piece). She taught briefly at a progressive school in Hampstead. On 29 December 1947 she married, at Cardiff's Windsor Place Synagogue, Frankfurt-born (Hans) Rudolf Nassauer (1924&#150;1996), a tutor, and son of Franz Leo Nassauer, wine merchant. His family were prosperous, assimilated <i>Ostjuden</i>-despising Jews, refugees from Hitler's Germany. A budding poet, Nassauer produced eight novels between 1960 and 1986. They settled in London, and had two daughters, Sharon and Rebecca, born in 1949 and 1951. Bernice Nassauer kept a kosher house, and would go on for a long time keeping the Friday night Sabbath meal. She never lost a sense of the need to remember the long history of Jewish exile.<br>
<br>In the early 1950s Bernice Nassauer taught English, turning to novel writing later in that decade. The first of her twenty-five published novels, <span class="italic">Set on Edge</span>&#151;a tone-setting black comedy about a noisy Welsh Jewish family obsessed with marriage and death, densely peopled with caricature versions of her own family&#151;appeared in 1960 in the name of Bernice Rubens, by which she was known thereafter. In the 1960s she got into the documentary film business, specializing in childhood issues. Her prizewinning feature <span class="italic">Stress</span> (1968), about handicapped children, led to her being hired by Granada Television. On the strength of <span class="italic">Dear Mum and Dad</span>, a Granada film about a children's home, she went to work for the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, filming in Java and other parts of Asia, Africa, and South America, making documentaries especially about women in rural development. For some years she alternated documentary film making with writing novels. Perennially forgiving of her philandering husband, who kept a long-term mistress with whom he had a son, Rubens finally divorced him in 1969&#151;though they became close again before his death in 1996.<br>
<br>Bernice Rubens's novels were almost immediately successful. Her fourth, <span class="italic">The Elected Member</span> (1969), about a rabbi's son of intense promise turned drug addict and paranoid hallucinator, stuck in a lunatic asylum (a terrifying take on the breakdown of her brother Harold's promising musical career), won the second Booker prize (1970). <span class="italic">A Five Year Sentence</span> (1978), featuring a suicidal spinster, jilted by a cruel lothario, who strangles the heartless old matron of her childhood orphanage, was shortlisted for the Booker. <span class="italic">Our Father</span> (1987), the story of a God-bothered explorer who smothered her half-brother&#151;the child of her father's adultery&#151;in his pram and who loses her own son, the outcome of a visiting plumber's rape, in an act of divine eye-for-an-eye punishment, netted the Welsh Arts Council prize. Other novels became successful movies. <span class="italic">I Sent a Letter to My Love</span> (1975), in which an unmarried Welsh woman finds herself in a lonely hearts correspondence with her own crippled brother, became <span class="italic">Ma ch&egrave;re inconnue</span> starring Simone Signoret (1980). The film version of <span class="italic">Madame Sousatska</span>, Rubens's second novel (1962), about a Welsh boy prodigy's zany London piano teacher (based on her brother Harold's own teacher), was directed in 1988 by John Schlesinger and starred Shirley MacLaine. <span class="italic">Mr Wakefield's Crusade</span> (1985), a story of mistaken identities and gender-crossing sparked by papers lifted from a man who drops dead in a post office queue, became a TV mini-series.<br>
<br>Rubens began making a living by writing after her Booker prize, on the basis of the home sales, foreign rights, and film rights. She soon became a well-known London woman of letters, a classic Camden Town intellectual. She was great friends with other London novelists, especially Paul Bailey and Beryl Bainbridge. These friendships were cemented not least when teaching creative writing courses for the Arvon Foundation and representing British writing on overseas tours for the British Council. (Rubens first met Beryl Bainbridge on one such trip to Israel.) She became a serial judge of literary prizes&#151;the Booker, the Whitbread, the Orange, the Commonwealth writers'. She was active in International PEN, becoming one of its vice-presidents. In 1982 she was deported from Moscow after illicit meetings with refusenik writers. In that year she was made a fellow of University College, Cardiff. The University of Wales made her an honorary DLitt in 1991, and she became a fellow of the Royal Society of Literature in 2001.<br>
<br>Rubens's novels are macabre, mordant, gothic, bleak, and black even when they essay comedy. <span class="italic">A Solitary Grief</span> (1991), for instance, in which a father strangles the Downs syndrome daughter whose face he cannot bear to look at and then hangs himself, or <span class="italic">Autobiopsy</span> (1993), in which a blocked writer trepans his dead mentor and siphons off his brain for inspiring drinks, are only par for the Rubens course. Her people are terribly troubled, full of hatred of self and others, especially their own kin; they are suicidal, killers, or utterly confused about gender&#151;there are several notable transvestites, as in <span class="italic">Sunday Best</span> (1971) and <span class="italic">Mr Wakefield's Crusade</span>. Several of her unhappy old ladies actually enjoy being raped by strong young men of the lower classes&#151;as in her gothic cruise-ship novel <span class="italic">Birds of Passage</span> (1981). The pervasive troubledness of these selves is often manifestly fired by immediate particular personal experience, not least in the extremely angry novels about unfaithful husbands and &#145;parasitic&#146; women who &#145;batten off married backs&#146;&#151;as in <span class="italic">Mate in Three</span> (1966), <span class="italic">Autobiopsy</span>, and Rubens's bitter post-divorce novel <span class="italic">Go Tell the Lemming</span> (1973). But it is the pains of a traditional Jewish selfhood and of bad Jewish history that most haunt and condition these sufferings&#151;ancient, biblically inspired distresses, the teeth of the children perpetually <span class="italic">Set on Edge</span> by the fathers' doings (as that novel's epigraph from <span class="roman">Ezekiel</span> has it), the dementedness of being chosen as God's elected people, the curse of being prodigiously blessed, which entails, for Rubens, being doomed as history's perennial scapegoats, picked out for pain as the subjects of diaspora, exile, pogrom, and holocaust. This grand theme of <span class="italic">Brothers</span> (1983), the multigenerational <i>Ostjuden</i> saga that Rubens valued most of all her fictions, pervades everything she wrote. Antisemitism, the acme of racism for Rubens, is a universal. <span class="italic">I, Dreyfus</span> (1999) finds the Dreyfus case being replayed in the framing of a Jewish headmaster for murder. Typically for Rubens, the evil machinators are led by an old Nazi settled in an English village. Unrepentant Nazis live sturdily on in her novels. They work for the United Nations in her Java novel <span class="italic">The Ponsonby Post</span> (1977). Nice old Mrs Green in the Hollyhocks old people's home in <span class="italic">The Waiting Game</span> (1997) has to be winkled out as Heidi Schoss, responsible for the deaths of thousands of Jewish women and children at Auschwitz&#150;Birkenau. These antisemites and their ilk must be exposed. There must be no forgetting of what Germans have done to Jews&#151;and (a keynote of <span class="italic">Brothers</span>) no forgiving either.<br>
<br>What gives Rubens's fictions so much of their power is indeed their repeated acts of remembering, of bearing witness, especially to the terrors inflicted again and again on Jews. What gives her testimonials their special edge is their uncompromising refusal to have truck with anything like forgiveness. One of the most memorable recallings of <span class="italic">When I Grow Up</span> (2005), the memoir Rubens managed to complete before she died in 2004, is of reading the Auschwitz section of <span class="italic">Brothers</span> at the annual British Council shop-window for British writers at Walberberg, near Cologne. &#145;The very word Germany stuck in my throat.&#146; &#145;Enraged&#146;, overwhelmed emotionally, instantly regretting her choice of passage, she none the less read on in a very awkward silence. Auschwitz and its like &#145;must not be forgotten or myth-translated&#146;, especially not by Germans  (<span class="italic">When I Grow Up</span>, 175&#150;6). Truth-telling like this was for Rubens a lifelong compulsion, however personally hurtful&#151;even when it came to painful revisionism of long-held promised land hopes, as the state of Israel's treatment of Arabs worsened through the 1980s and 1990s. The Israeli &#145;God that failed&#146; was one of her latterday themes, not least in <span class="italic">When I Grow Up</span>. The emotional demon-facing intensities of her last novel, <span class="italic">The Sergeants' Tale</span> (2003), which told the terrible story of two kidnapped British sergeants executed by the Jewish terror group Irgun amid the 1947 birthpangs of the state of Israel, make it arguably one of her finest. This father- and fathers-haunted writer was glad, she said, that her father had not lived to witness Israel's invasion of Lebanon.<br>
<br>Rubens died on 13 October 2004 at the Royal Free Hospital, Camden, London, of a stroke combined with chronic bronchitis&#151;a classic illness of smokers. This was the final price perhaps for all the years of pleasurably gossipy smoking with Beryl Bainbridge at the Caf&eacute; Delancey in Camden Town&#151;both of them having pretended to give up on doctors' orders, peering, as Bainbridge put it, &#145;anxiously out of the window through a mist of smoke&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Independent</span>, 15 Oct 2004).<br>
