<span class="headword">B&eacute;gin,  Louis-Nazaire</span>  (1840&#150;1925), <span class="occ">cardinal and archbishop of Quebec</span>, born at La Pointe-L&eacute;vis in French Canada on 10 January 1840, was the son of Charles B&eacute;gin, farmer, and his wife, Luce Paradis. His parents came of farming stock of French descent. He began his education at the L&eacute;vis model school, whence he proceeded to the commercial college, St Michel, and entered the archdiocesan seminary at Quebec in 1857. After graduating BA from Laval University, Quebec, he was sent to Rome in 1863 in order to complete his theological studies at the French College and at the Gregorian University. He was ordained priest at Rome in 1865, and received the degree of DD from the University of Innsbruck two years later. On returning to Canada in 1868 B&eacute;gin was appointed professor of theology and church history at Laval University, and he held the chair until 1884 when he was appointed principal of the Laval normal school.<br>
<br>B&eacute;gin was raised to the episcopate as bishop of Chicoutimi, one of the suffragan sees of the province of Quebec, in 1888, and three years later he returned to the city of Quebec as coadjutor to Cardinal Taschereau and titular archbishop of Cyrene. Owing to the state of the cardinal's health B&eacute;gin was appointed administrator of the archdiocese in 1894, and he succeeded Taschereau as archbishop of Quebec in 1898. While teaching at Laval, B&eacute;gin had published papers on the primacy and infallibility of the sovereign pontiffs and on scripture and the rule of faith. During his episcopate he published <span class="italic">La chronologie de l'histoire des &Eacute;tats Unis d'Am&eacute;rique</span> (1895) and a <span class="italic">Cat&eacute;chisme de controverse</span> (1902). His tenure of the see of Quebec was marked by the formation of many new parishes, the introduction of fresh religious communities, and, above all, by a campaign of social action. As bishop of Chicoutimi he had joined the other members of the Canadian hierarchy in their protests against the Manitoba school law of 1890. In 1907 he founded the organization known as L'Action Sociale Catholique, with its publication <span class="italic">L'Action Sociale</span>. He was greatly assisted in this work by Monseigneur Paul Eug&egrave;ne Roy who, at B&eacute;gin's request, was appointed titular bishop of Eleutheropolis in 1908. During the archbishop's later years much of the administrative work of the archdiocese of Quebec was undertaken by Monseigneur Roy, who became titular archbishop of Seleucia in 1914 and coadjutor with right of succession in 1920. Meanwhile, in May 1914, Archbishop B&eacute;gin had been created cardinal priest by Pope Pius X, with the titular church of San Vitale. He lived to the age of eighty-five, and was survived by only a few months by his coadjutor, who was already suffering from an incurable disease at his succession. Cardinal B&eacute;gin died at Quebec on 18 July 1925 and was buried in the crypt of his cathedral.<br>
