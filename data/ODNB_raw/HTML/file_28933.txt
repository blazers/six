<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Webbe,  Samuel, the elder</span>  (1740&#150;1816), <span class="occ">church musician and composer</span>, was born in London on 7 October 1740, the son of well-to-do parents. Before he was a year old his father took up a government appointment in Minorca, but he died before his wife and family could join him there. Thereafter the family's financial situation was straitened, and Webbe's mother was obliged to curtail his education and apprentice him at the age of eleven to a cabinet-maker for a period of seven years. Within a year of the expiry of his articles Webbe turned his attention to music, at the same time also embarking on a vigorous programme of self-education. He successively applied himself to Latin, French, and Italian, and later also acquired a competent knowledge of German, Greek, and Hebrew; he is said also to have excelled in fencing and dancing. When later asked by Charles Butler how he managed to acquire so much additional knowledge in an already busy life, he replied that it was by &#145;a rigid observance of two rules: never to let a bit or scrap of time, pass unemployed, and, whatever, he did, to fix his whole mind upon it&#146;  (Butler, 2.356). Through the music publisher Peter Welcker, for whom he undertook work as a copyist, he met Charles Barbandt, the organist of the Bavarian embassy chapel, and became his pupil, and it may have been at this time that he converted to Roman Catholicism. By the time he was twenty-five he had become a teacher of music. On 30 May 1763 he married Anne Plumb; of the eight children of the marriage, born between 1764 and 1775, his eldest son <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28934/', "Samuel Webbe")</script> also became a musician. He became a member of the Royal Society of Musicians in 1770.<br>
<br>In addition to teaching Webbe was also becoming established as a bass singer in London's pleasure gardens and theatres. By the summer of 1767 he was appearing at Marylebone Gardens, and later in the same year also sang in the chorus at Covent Garden. He is included as a chorus member in the account books for Drury Lane in 1776 and 1778, and can probably be identified as the &#145;Webb&#146; who was director of the chorus at the King's Theatre in 1785. He also composed for and sang at Vauxhall Gardens.<br>
<br>Early in his career Webbe established a reputation as a composer of glees, and rapidly became the leading exponent of his age in this genre. His first collection of vocal part music appeared about 1764. In 1776 he won his first prize medal from the Catch Club for his canon &#145;O that I had wings&#146;, and won a further twenty-six medals between then and 1793. He became a member of the Catch Club in 1771, and became its secretary in 1794 on the death of Edmund Thomas Warren, resigning in 1812. On the foundation of the Glee Club in 1787 he was appointed its librarian; his most celebrated glee, &#145;Glorious Apollo&#146;, was performed at the beginning of every meeting during the club's history. He was also a member of the Anacreontic Society and the Concentores Sodales, two other glee clubs. Seventy-three of his glees appeared in nine volumes he published himself, a further twenty-five were included in Warren's collection, and many more were published in his lifetime and afterwards in other collections.<br>
<br>Webbe was also the most important and influential English Roman Catholic church composer of his generation. At one time or another he was involved with the music of all the principal foreign embassy chapels, which were at this time the main centres for Roman Catholic worship in London. In the late 1760s he was at the Bavarian embassy chapel, probably initially as Barbandt's assistant and later as his successor. In October 1775, following the death of George Paxton, he became organist of the Sardinian embassy chapel, and from 1776 was simultaneously organist of the Portuguese embassy chapel. At the Sardinian chapel he offered free instruction on Friday evenings &#145;to such young gentlemen as present themselves to learn church music&#146;  (<span class="italic">Laity's Directory</span>, 1793), and numbered among his pupils John Danby, Charles Knyvett the younger, Vincent Novello, and probably Samuel Wesley. His masses and other church music compositions, written in a predominantly simple and straightforward style, were an important part of the repertory of the embassy chapels from the early 1770s. Many of them were subsequently published in <span class="italic">A Collection of Sacred Music, as used in the Chapel of the King of Sardinia</span> (<i>c</i>.1785), <span class="italic">A Collection of Masses</span> (1792), and <span class="italic">A Collection of Motets and Antiphons</span> (1792), and continued in widespread use in Roman Catholic churches until well into the nineteenth century. He is best-known to present-day congregations for his hymn tune &#145;Melcombe&#146;, originally composed as a setting of <span class="italic">O salutaris hostia</span>, but now usually sung to the words of John Keble's hymn &#145;New every morning is the love&#146;.<br>
<br>Little is known of Webbe's activities in the last years of his life. By 1808 he appears to have been in reduced circumstances, probably as a result of declining health. In March of that year R. J. S. Stevens recorded that he had organized a subscription among Webbe's friends and had collected &pound;115. A benefit concert consisting entirely of his own music was organized for him on 30 May of that year under the patronage of the prince of Wales, the dukes of Cumberland and Cambridge, and the other members of the Catch Club, and raised &pound;450. Two further benefits were held on 13 April 1809 and 18 April 1814.<br>
<br>During his last years Webbe was confined to his apartments in 1 Great Square, Gray's Inn; by this time he had given up composition and chiefly amused himself by playing chess with a friend. He died at home on 25 May 1816 and was buried in the churchyard of St Pancras Old Church. His extensive library of books and music was sold at White's on 4 July 1816 and on two successive days.<br>
<br>Webbe was widely respected by his friends and professional colleagues. His obituary notice stressed the affection in which he was held, the wide range of his learning and accomplishments, and his unaffected manner. Although little is known of his life outside music, it is clear that he had an extensive range of interests, including an involvement in radical politics and membership of the London Corresponding Society.<br>
