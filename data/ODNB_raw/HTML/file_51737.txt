<span class="headword">Buttle,  Gladwin Albert Hurst</span>  (1899&#150;1983), <span class="occ">physician and pharmacologist</span>, was born on 11 April 1899 at Park View, Godstone, Surrey, the son of William Buttle, a solicitor, and his wife, Mary Wilby, daughter of William Henry Ward, a builder. He attended Miss Brown's school in Warlingham and went on to the Whitgift Grammar School in Croydon. In 1917 he enlisted in the regular army, trained at the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, and was commissioned second lieutenant in the Royal Engineers in 1918. A year later he left the army to study medicine at St John's College, Cambridge. His teachers included the physiologists John Newport Langley and Joseph Barcroft, the neurophysiologist Edgar Douglas Adrian, and the biochemist Frederick Gowland Hopkins. In later life he admitted missing lectures in his subjects in order to attend lectures on physics by Ernest Rutherford and on English literature by Arthur Quiller Couch. After graduating BA he entered University College Hospital, London, in 1922, and qualified MB, MRCS, LRCP in 1924. He was awarded the MA in 1927, MD (Louvain) in 1945, and BCh in 1967, and was elected FRCP in 1970.<br>
<br>In 1925, at the suggestion of John Henry Gaddum, a fellow student at Cambridge, Buttle joined the staff of the Wellcome Physiological Laboratories. He was appointed assistant pharmacologist to John William Trevan, with whom he studied the effects of bacterial toxins, the pharmacology of digitalis, and the action of local anaesthetics. He developed a test for scarlet fever anti-serum, then coming into production, and this work led him to the study of the control of streptococcal infection using anti-sera and drugs. In 1935 his attention was drawn to a paper by Gerhard Domagk of the research laboratories of IG Farbenindustrie which showed that the diazo dye known as Prontosil protected mice against virulent strains of streptococci. Buttle experimented with a sample of Prontosil supplied by Domagk but was unable to confirm the observations using the strain of streptococci available to him. After being informed by Dr Leonard Colebrook of Queen Charlotte's Hospital of difficulties in treating puerperal fever in women with streptococcal infection and of the very high mortality rate of the disease he obtained a sample of the virulent strain from the hospital and with this succeeded in reproducing Domagk's results. After December 1935, when workers at the Institut Pasteur in Paris showed that sulphanilamide was the active moiety of the Prontosil molecule, Buttle and his co-workers began research on the chemotherapy of sulphanilamide and its derivatives. They showed that sulphanilamide protected mice against meningococci and gonococci, and revealed the potential of some derivatives in the treatment of pneumococcal and staphylococcal infections.<br>
<br>In 1939 Buttle went to New York to lecture on the research into sulphonamide drugs but had to return to Britain on the outbreak of war as a member of the regular army reserve. He was transferred from the Royal Engineers to the Royal Army Medical Corps, and was appointed to the blood transfusion service, becoming an adviser on blood transfusion to the army. He left the service with the rank of lieutenant-colonel. Early in the war, when serving with the base transfusion unit in Cairo, he recognized that whole blood was essential if battle casualties with excessive blood loss were to benefit from early surgery under anaesthesia. Blood plasma was being sent out from Britain, but not the equipment necessary to collect and store whole blood, and it was necessary to manufacture the apparatus from materials available locally. It was largely due to Buttle's engineering skills that the unit was able to overcome the practical difficulties arising from necessary improvisation. His team of transfusion officers transformed the surgery of the battlefield from El Alamein onwards. He was appointed OBE (military division) in 1942 for his contribution to war medicine.<br>
<br>In 1943 Buttle was sent as an expert in the therapeutic use of sulphonamide drugs to Carthage to assist Lord Moran in treating Winston Churchill for a bronchial infection. On this occasion the prime minister questioned Buttle closely on the new antibiotic penicillin and its potential use in forthcoming military operations.<br>
<br>After the war Buttle and his family settled in London. On 8 November 1936 he had married Eva Karolina Korella (<i>b</i>. 1904/5), a talented painter, the daughter of Friedrich Wilhelm Saloman Korella, a retired professor of botany at Danzig University. They had one son, Richard. In 1946 Buttle became the first Wellcome professor of pharmacology at the school of pharmacy, University of London, and held the post to 1966. He was professor of pharmacology at St Bartholomew's Hospital, London, from 1948 to 1966. During this time he researched the chemotherapy of bacterial diseases and cancer. He served on the Medical Research Council's drugs safety committee, the Colonial Office leprosy committee, and the Ministry of Agriculture food additives committee. He was a medical consultant to the Ministry of Defence and president of the therapeutics and experimental medicine section of the Royal Society of Medicine. After his retirement in 1966 he held research posts in Mexico City, 1967&#150;9, Addis Ababa, 1972&#150;4, and Riyadh, 1974&#150;8. On his return to the United Kingdom he became a consultant to the Wellcome laboratories.<br>
<br>Buttle was a short, sturdy, robust man with an original mind that did not run on conventional lines. This latter characteristic was shared by his brother Frank, an Anglican clergyman who combined personal poverty with an interest in the stock market. With the money he made the two brothers set up the Buttle Trust devoted to the education and welfare of deprived children, with Gladwin Buttle acting as chairman of the trust from 1953 to 1974. He died on 3 May 1983 at Charing Cross Hospital (Fulham), London, and a memorial service was held at the church of Christ the King, London. He was survived by his wife.<br>
