<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Malthus,  (Thomas) Robert</span>  (1766&#150;1834), <span class="occ">political economist</span>, was born on 13 February 1766 and baptized on 14 February at his parents' home, The Rookery, near Wotton, Surrey. In formal situations he used his full name, but in less formal correspondence referred to himself as T. Robert Malthus or Robert Malthus, and among family and close friends was always called Robert or Bob.<h2>
<a name="Familyandearlylife"></a>Family and early life</h2>Malthus's great-grandfather Daniel Malthus (1651&#150;1717) was apothecary to Queen Anne and George I. His grandfather Sydenham Malthus (<i>d</i>. 1757) was a barrister of Lincoln's Inn. His father, Daniel Malthus (1730&#150;1800), being an only son, appears to have inherited considerable wealth and property, and these independent means enabled him to travel and to cultivate his literary, artistic, theatrical, and scientific interests. He entered Queen's College, Oxford, in 1747 but did not graduate. He was an admirer of Rousseau, who once visited The Rookery when Malthus was an infant. He was said to have published some literary pieces anonymously, but the statement by an obituarist that he had translated works from French and German was firmly contradicted by Malthus. He supported the views of the marquis de Condorcet and William Godwin on the perfectibility of mankind, but also encouraged his son's publication of opposing views. Aspects of his behaviour&#151;for example, the unconventional education he chose for Malthus, and his refusal to allow his wife to wear her wedding ring&#151;were regarded as eccentric, and perhaps show the influence of Rousseau. He married (on 6 May 1752) Henrietta Catherine Graham (1733&#150;1800), his second cousin, the daughter of Daniel Graham (1695&#150;1778), apothecary to George II and George III. She can be seen as a young girl with her brother and two sisters, in Hogarth's painting <span class="italic">The Graham Children</span> (1742), now in the National Gallery, London. Malthus was the sixth of their seven children (two boys and five girls).<br>
<br>Malthus's elder brother, Sydenham (1754&#150;1821), was the grandfather of Colonel Sydenham Malthus (1831&#150;1916) and the great-grandfather of Robert Malthus (1881&#150;1972), whose family papers have provided much valuable information about the life and career of Malthus. Other descendants of Sydenham emigrated to New Zealand, where there are now many Malthus families. Malthus's youngest sister, Mary Anne Catherine (1771&#150;1852), married Edward Bray, of Shere, Surrey. Their daughter Louisa, in her unpublished &#145;Recollections&#146;, provides further insights into the lives of the Malthus and Bray families.<br>
<br>Little is known of Malthus's schooling before the age of twelve. One source (Payne) says that he was educated in private at High Wycombe &#145;by men well qualified as tutors&#146;  (Payne, 101), but no further details are given. It is possible that Malthus's father undertook at least some of his early education at home. Malthus's five sisters were brought up at home without a governess.<br>
<br>For at least three school years, from 1778/9 to 1780/81, Malthus attended a school conducted by Revd Richard Graves at his home, Claverton rectory, near Bath. In letters to Daniel Malthus, Graves commented on the rapid progress made by Malthus in his classical studies and on his precociousness in appreciating the humorous passages. He also reported that the young Malthus loved &#145;fighting for fighting's sake&#146;, but that he and his antagonist were &#145;the best of friends in the world&#146;&#151;a situation that William Empson later saw as prefiguring Malthus's relationship with Ricardo.<br>
<br>During the academic year 1782/3 (and perhaps earlier) Malthus was sent by his father to the dissenting academy at Warrington, near Liverpool. The dissenting academies of Warrington and elsewhere had been established to provide an education for the sons of dissenters, who at that time, because they refused to subscribe to the <span class="roman">Thirty-Nine Articles</span> of the Church of England, were not admitted to the universities of Oxford and Cambridge and were therefore debarred from professions requiring university degrees. It is not clear why Daniel Malthus chose to send his son to a dissenting academy, rather than to a public school, or why he chose one at such a distance from Surrey. There is no evidence that either Daniel Malthus or Malthus was ever a dissenter. Malthus himself later became a clergyman of the Church of England. It is possible that the concept of a dissenting academy appealed to a radical trait in Daniel's character, or that he was impressed by the scholarly reputation and independence of spirit of the tutors at the academy. According to Gilbert Wakefield, the classical tutor at the Warrington academy from 1779 to 1783, at least one third of the students at that time were members of the &#145;establishment&#146;, who preferred an education at the academy to the &#145;restrictions and licentiousness&#146; of the universities  (Wakefield, 199).<br>
<br>When the academy at Warrington closed down in 1783, Malthus became a private pupil of Gilbert Wakefield for the year 1783/4 at his home in Bramcote, near Nottingham, where he pursued a rigorous and regular programme of study in classics and mathematics, interspersed with walking and shooting in the company of Wakefield, who treated him more as a companion. Wakefield was later to become famous for his radical political views, notably his argument that the poor and labouring classes of England would lose nothing if Napoleon conquered England and imposed on England the egalitarianism of the French Revolution. For these seditious remarks he was imprisoned in Dorchester gaol for two years, 1799&#150;1801.<br>
<br>With the advice and help of Wakefield, Malthus on 8 June 1784 was entered as a pensioner at Jesus College, Cambridge, where Wakefield had been a fellow; he took up residence in October that year. His father supported his desire for a university education, although his mother, it seems, was originally opposed to the idea. Malthus graduated BA and ninth wrangler early in 1788. His studies were mainly in mathematics and classics, although later, after graduation, he was reading books on mineralogy, chemistry, geography, and history. He obtained a prize for a Latin declamation on the ironical topic that knowledge of classical texts would be facilitated if they were studied in translation. He proceeded MA in 1791 and became a fellow of Jesus College on 10 June 1793. He held his fellowship until his marriage in 1804. As an undergraduate he was taught by yet another radical tutor, William Frend (1757&#150;1841), who was later expelled from the university for opposing the policy requiring subscription to the <span class="roman">Thirty-Nine Articles</span>.<br>
<br>As early as 1783 Malthus had expressed a desire to enter the church. The only difficulty seems to have been a speech defect resulting from a congenital cleft lip and palate. He was advised that it would prohibit his rising to an eminent position in the church, but, although it proved troublesome to some acquaintances, it did not prevent the successful performance of his preaching and teaching duties. He was ordained deacon by the bishop of Winchester on 7 June 1789 and licensed to the curacy of Oakwood (or Okewood) Chapel in the parish of Wotton, at a stipend of &pound;40 a year. The appointment at Oakwood appears to have been negotiated by his father. He held his stipendiary curacy of Oakwood until about 1805, when he was appointed to the East India College. During this time he probably lived mainly with his parents in the village of Albury, about 9 miles north of Oakwood, where they had moved in 1787, although he also spent time in a &#145;garret in Town&#146; and resided occasionally at Jesus College. He was ordained priest on 20 March 1791, and on 5 April 1824 he was licensed perpetual curate of Oakwood Chapel. On 21 November 1803 he had been appointed rector of Walesby, in Lincolnshire, a living in the gift of a distant relative, Henry Dalton. He visited Walesby occasionally, but the parish duties were carried out mainly by a succession of curates. William Otter and William Empson attest that Malthus was imbued with the spirit of the gospel and with the doctrines of Christianity; and that in the performance of his clerical duties he was conscientious, devout, and pious. In turn with the other professors, he read prayers and preached regularly in the chapel of the East India College. His sermons, some of which have survived, were said by Otter to have become more earnest and edifying over the years. In his publications Malthus nearly always described himself as Rev. According to Payne, Malthus changed the family motto from <i>Honor justitiae praemium</i> to <i>Honor virtutis praemium</i> (&#145;Honour is the reward of virtue&#146;).<br>
<br>Malthus's first known publication venture occurred in 1796, when he unsuccessfully submitted to the publisher Debrett a paper entitled &#145;The Crisis&#146;, a criticism of the administration of William Pitt. His father urged him to persist in trying to find a publisher, even though it might have jeopardized his clerical career (&#145;might not get you a Deanery&#146;). Extracts were quoted by Otter and Empson, but the paper has not subsequently been found.<h2>
<a name="Theprincipleofpopulation"></a>The principle of population</h2>In 1798 Malthus published (anonymously) his first and most famous book, <span class="italic">An Essay on the Principle of Population</span>. It arose from discussions with his father on the utopian hopes of Condorcet and Godwin, and argued that they had overlooked the difficulties arising from the tendency of population to increase more rapidly than the food supply. Population, he argued, increases in a &#145;geometric ratio&#146; (1, 2, 4, 8, 16 &hellip; ), doubling every twenty-five years, but the food supply can increase at the utmost only in an &#145;arithmetic ratio&#146; (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, &hellip; ). Consequently, population is kept in balance with the food supply by various &#145;checks&#146;. These checks were classified as either &#145;vice&#146; or &#145;misery&#146;, and included wars, famines, plagues, delayed marriages (later called &#145;prudential restraint&#146;), prostitution (&#145;vicious customs with respect to women&#146;), and contraception (&#145;unnatural&#146; practices; <span class="italic">Essay on the Principle of Population</span>, 1798, 100, 154). He also classified the checks as either &#145;positive&#146; (those that increase the death rate) or &#145;preventive&#146; (those that reduce the birth rate).<br>
<br>In 1803 Malthus published a greatly expanded second edition of the <span class="italic">Essay</span>, incorporating details of the population checks that had been in operation in many different countries and periods. Although nominally a second edition, it was regarded by Malthus as a substantially new work. He did not claim originality for the idea that population tends to outrun the food supply. In the preface to the second edition he stated that in writing the first edition he had deduced the principle of population from the writings of David Hume, Robert Wallace, Adam Smith, and Richard Price, but that in the intervening period he had become aware that much more had been published on the subject. He nevertheless believed that even more remained to be done, especially in describing the means by which populations are checked and in drawing out the practical implications of the principle of population.<br>
<br>In the second edition, he made clear what was only implicit in the first, that prudential restraint should, if humanly possible, be &#145;moral restraint&#146;&#151;that is, delayed marriage accompanied by strictly moral pre-marital behaviour, although he admitted that moral restraint would not be easy and that there would be occasional failures. Whereas in the first edition he had said that all the checks to population would involve either misery or vice, in the second edition he attempted to lighten this &#145;melancholy hue&#146;  (<span class="italic">Essay on the Principle of Population</span>, 1st edn, 1798, iv) and &#145;to soften some of the harshest conclusions of the first essay&#146;  (2nd edn, 1803, vii) by arguing that moral restraint, if supported by an education emphasizing the immorality of bringing children into the world without the means of supporting them, would tend to increase rather than diminish individual happiness.<br>
<br>In the concluding two chapters of the first edition of the <span class="italic">Essay</span> Malthus had argued that the pressure of population on the food supply was providentially ordained by God as a stimulus to human development (&#145;the growth of mind&#146;) and was consistent with the notion of divine benevolence. These two chapters, which also contained some radical opinions on other theological questions, were omitted from the second and later editions of the <span class="italic">Essay</span>, but whether Malthus ever relinquished the views they contain is debatable.<br>
<br>Malthus was despised by some famous contemporaries. Samuel Taylor Coleridge referred to &#145;the stupid Ignorance of the Man&#146;  (MS note in Coleridge's copy of the <span class="italic">Essay</span>, BL, 6), Robert Southey described him as a &#145;mischievous booby&#146;  (<span class="italic">New Letters of Robert Southey</span>, ed. Kenneth Curry, 1.357) and a &#145;precious philosophicide&#146;  (ibid., 1.551), and William Cobbett wrote of &#145;the barbarous and impious Malthus&#146;  (<span class="italic">Rural Rides</span>, ed. G. D. H. Cole and M. Cole, 1930, 1.26). But Charles Darwin acknowledged Malthus's influence in the development of his theory of natural selection  (<span class="italic">The Life and Letters of Charles Darwin</span>, ed. F. Darwin, 1898, 68, 465), and the principle of population became accepted as a central tenet of classical political economy.<br>
<br>Further editions of the <span class="italic">Essay</span> appeared in 1806, 1807, 1817, and 1826, with important alterations and additions, particularly the appendices added to the third and the fifth editions, in which Malthus replied to some of his many critics. He was accused of advocating wars and immoral practices as ways of controlling population growth, but he insisted that this was a gross misinterpretation and that the only check he advocated was prudential restraint, or preferably moral restraint. Critics also argued that the latter would not be feasible as a general method of controlling population and that in advocating it Malthus was guilty of the very perfectibilism he had condemned in Godwin, but he remained cautiously optimistic about the success of his preferred check. He rejected contraception as a means of population control, partly on moral grounds and partly because he believed that, by providing an easy means of control, it would remove the desirable stimulus to work and self-improvement arising from the need to provide for one's children. He would therefore have been strongly opposed to the later usurpation of his name by organizations such as the Neo-Malthusian League, which advocated contraception. He would also have objected to those who link his name with zero population growth. He insisted that he was not &#145;an enemy to population&#146;  (<span class="italic">Essay</span>, 3rd edn, 1806, 2.508). He regarded the growth of population as a desirable end in itself, and even as a necessary cause of economic growth, provided that it did not exceed the growth of the food supply. Variorum editions of the <span class="italic">Essay</span> were published in 1986 and 1989.<br>
<br>For today's readers, living in a post-Malthus era, the world's population problems are well known and serious, but no longer sensational. It is difficult therefore to appreciate the radical and controversial impact made by the <span class="italic">Essay</span> at the time of publication. It challenged the conventional notion that population growth is an unmixed blessing. It discussed prostitution, contraception, and other sexual matters. And it gave vivid descriptions of the horrendous consequences of overpopulation and of the brutal means by which populations are checked. But perhaps most controversial of all was Malthus's argument against the poor laws, and his denial that the poor have a right to be supported&#151;arguments that were continued through all editions of the <span class="italic">Essay</span> and in other writings. The arguments were based on a variety of economic, psychological, and political considerations. The poor laws tended to increase the price of food, to undermine the spirit of independence of the people, to encourage early and improvident marriages, and thus to create the poor they sought to maintain&#151;although this last tendency would be offset to some extent by the exercise of prudential restraint. For these and other reasons Malthus hoped for and advocated as a long-term goal the gradual abolition of the poor laws, but in later years, acknowledging that under the current state of public opinion abolition would not be politically practicable, he placed greater emphasis on an amelioration of the existing system through administrative improvements.<br>
<br>In the summer of 1799 Malthus travelled with Otter, E. D. Clarke, and J. M. Cripps to northern Europe. Malthus and Otter travelled through Sweden and Finland to St Petersburg, and returned to Britain at the end of the summer. Clarke and Cripps travelled further north, and then extensively throughout Europe. Malthus kept a diary of his journey, part of which has survived and been published. It shows him busily recording local details of the pressure of population on food supplies, and of the various local customs and institutions by means of which populations were held in check. The other part was lent to Clarke and lost.<h2>
<a name="TheEastIndiaCompanyCollege"></a>The East India Company College</h2>In the summer of 1802 Malthus had a five-month holiday with relatives in France and Switzerland. The party included Harriet Eckersall (1776&#150;1864), his first cousin once removed, whom he later married, on 12 April 1804. Her parents were John Eckersall (1748&#150;1837) and Catherine Eckersall (1755&#150;1837), both of whom were first cousins of Malthus, as well as first cousins of one another. Malthus and his wife had three children: Henry (1804&#150;1882), who became vicar of Effingham and of Donnington, and who married Sophia Otter, daughter of William Otter; Emily (1806&#150;1885), who married John Watson Pringle; and Lucy (1807&#150;1825). There were no grandchildren.<br>
<br>In 1805 Malthus was appointed professor of history and political economy at the newly founded East India College, set up by the East India Company to educate young men for service in India. The college was initially situated in Hertford, but new buildings including accommodation for the professors and their families were soon after constructed at Haileybury, about 2 miles south-east of Hertford. Malthus taught and lived at Haileybury for the rest of his life, apart from short holidays to Ireland, Scotland, and Europe, and visits to his relatives and friends.<br>
<br>At times, life at the college was disturbed by the unruly behaviour of the students. Their commotions and riots, resulting in damage to property and on one occasion injury to a college servant, received much adverse publicity, and the college was threatened with closure. Malthus was asked to act as spokesperson for the college, and wrote two pamphlets in its defence: <span class="italic">A Letter to the Rt. Hon. Lord Grenville</span> (1813), and <span class="italic">Statements Respecting the East India College</span> (1817). Malthus was apparently well liked by the students. His nickname was Pop, or Old Pop, an abbreviation of Population Malthus, and according to one student he was &#145;both the favourite and the hero&#146; of the college. Brief records of some lectures he delivered at the college have survived. They include notes written in 1828 by a student, J. D. Inverarity, in an interleaved copy of Adam Smith's <span class="italic">Wealth of Nations</span>, which Malthus was apparently using as a text. Examination papers on political economy and on history set by Malthus in 1808 have also survived.<h2>
<a name="Latereconomicwritings"></a>Later economic writings</h2>The population question was not Malthus's only concern. He became increasingly involved in other aspects of political economy, both theoretical and applied. In 1800 he published <span class="italic">An Investigation of the Cause of the Present High Price of Provisions</span>, in which he argued that food prices were increasing because of the large amount of money being spent to support the poor. In 1807 he published <span class="italic">A Letter to Samuel Whitbread</span>, which dealt with Whitbread's proposed amendments to the poor laws. In 1808 and 1809 he published in the <span class="italic">Edinburgh Review</span> two articles on the problems of Ireland, and a third on &#145;[William] Spence on commerce&#146;, although his authorship of the last has been disputed. In 1811 two further articles in the <span class="italic">Edinburgh Review</span>, on currency and bullion matters, initiated a friendship with David Ricardo. Their extensive correspondence provides a unique insight into the characters, ideas, and mental processes of the two most important economists of this formative period in the history of political economy in England. Although they differed on some essential points&#151;notably, on the theory of value, the nature of rent, and the role of effective demand&#151;their friendship remained close. Eleven days before his death, Ricardo concluded his last letter to Malthus:<blockquote>And now my dear Malthus I have done. Like other disputants after much discussion we each retain our own opinions. These discussions however never influence our friendship; I should not like you more than I do if you agreed in opinion with me. (<span class="italic">Works and Correspondence</span>, 9.382)</blockquote>And later Malthus said of Ricardo: &#145;I never loved any body out of my own family so much&#146;  (Empson, 499).<br>
<br>In 1815 Malthus published a pamphlet on rent (he is credited with being one of the discoverers of the classical theory of rent). In 1814 and 1815 he wrote two pamphlets on the corn laws, in the second of which he astonished his whig friends by departing from absolute adherence to Adam Smith's doctrine of free trade, and arguing in favour of some restrictions on the importation of foreign corn. Some commentators have argued that in later life he abandoned his policy of agricultural protection; but whether he did or not, his departure from <i>laissez-faire</i> in this instance was clearly reluctant, and motivated by considerations of national security, by a desire to maintain a balance between agriculture and manufacturing, and (particularly in his earlier writings) by a fear of the unwholesome and destabilizing effects of an excessive development of manufacturing.<br>
<br>In 1820 Malthus published his <span class="italic">Principles of Political Economy</span>. The title was something of a misnomer, as the book was conceived as a series of tracts rather than a comprehensive and systematic treatise. For the rest of his life he assembled copious notes in preparation for a second edition of the <span class="italic">Principles</span>, but he died before completing it. A second edition was published in 1836 by an anonymous editor, probably John Cazenove, with a considerable number of additions and deletions, and including a &#145;Memoir of Robert Malthus&#146; by Otter. However, it is not clear to what extent the second edition reflects Malthus's final thoughts. The editor did not incorporate all of Malthus's manuscript revisions, and states that he made other editorial variations, omissions, and additions. Variorum editions of the <span class="italic">Principles</span> were published in 1986 and 1989.<br>
<br>The <span class="italic">Principles</span> had only a limited impact at the time, and was severely criticized by J. R. McCulloch and Ricardo; the latter prepared extensive critical notes. But more recently it has received greater recognition, largely as a result of the comments by J. M. Keynes in the 1930s. Keynes argued that Malthus's theory of effective demand provided a scientific explanation of unemployment, and that the hundred-year domination of Ricardo over Malthus had been a disaster for the progress of economics. Keynes believed that if economics had followed Malthus instead of being constrained by Ricardo in an artificial groove, the world would be a much wiser and richer place. When Karl Marx referred to Malthus as &#145;the contemptible Malthus&#146;  (Meek, 121) and as &#145;a shameless sycophant of the ruling classes&#146;  (ibid., 123), he obviously overlooked the passages in the <span class="italic">Principles</span> dealing with the importance of distribution and effective demand as causes of economic growth.<br>
<br>Between the publication of his <span class="italic">Principles</span> in 1820 and his death in 1834, Parson Malthus (as he was sometimes referred to) published a further ten works, and appeared as a witness before two select committees of the House of Commons. In 1821, in an <span class="italic">Edinburgh Review</span> article, he replied to Godwin's <span class="italic">Of Population</span> (1820). In 1823, in a small work entitled <span class="italic">The Measure of Value Stated and Illustrated</span>, he thought he had proved that the quantity of labour commanded in exchange is the only, and an invariable, measure of value&#151;an argument that commentators have not found convincing. Also in 1823 he wrote an article for the <span class="italic">Quarterly Review</span> on Thomas Tooke's <span class="italic">Thoughts and Details</span>, and another on &#145;Population&#146; for the <span class="italic">Supplement &hellip; to the Encyclopaedia Britannica</span>. In 1824 in the <span class="italic">Quarterly Review</span> he criticized the article by McCulloch on &#145;Political economy&#146; in the supplement, declaring that Ricardo, McCulloch, and James Mill were representatives of a &#145;new school of political economy&#146; which had departed from the school represented by Adam Smith and himself. The fact (noted above) that Malthus in 1828 was using Smith's <span class="italic">Wealth of Nations</span> as a text rather than his own <span class="italic">Principles of Political Economy</span> indicates his great esteem for Smith. In 1825 he was elected one of the ten royal associates of the Royal Society of Literature and in 1825 and 1827 he presented two papers on the subject of value, neither of which appears to have had any impact on the subsequent development of the theory of value. In 1826 he published the sixth edition of the <span class="italic">Essay</span>. His <span class="italic">Definitions in Political Economy</span> (1827) was a valiant attempt to resolve differences of opinion in political economy by codifying its terminology and establishing rules for the definition of terms. It could be regarded as one of the earliest works on the methodology of economics. Finally, in 1830 he published <span class="italic">A Summary View of the Principle of Population</span>, which was a shorter version, with a few small additions, of his 1823 <span class="italic">Encyclopaedia Britannica</span> article, motivated by a desire to respond to criticisms being levied at that time by Michael T. Sadler. In addition to these ten post-1820 publications, he gave evidence in 1824 before the select committee on artisans and machinery, and in 1827 before the select committee on emigration. His replies to questions provide an important insight into his views on matters not dealt with explicitly in his published works.<br>
<br>While engaged in these extensive literary activities, Malthus carried out his normal teaching duties at the East India College, often under great pressure to meet examination deadlines, and conducted an extensive correspondence. More than 230 letters to or from more than fifty correspondents are known to have survived, in addition to the Ricardo&#150;Malthus letters. His correspondents included Charles Babbage, Bewick Bridge, Thomas Chalmers, Francis Horner, Robert Wilmot-Horton, John Murray, Macvey Napier, Henry Parnell, Jean-Baptiste Say, Nassau William Senior, William Whewell, Samuel Whitbread, Arthur Young, and his close family.<br>
<br>Malthus became a fellow of the Royal Society in 1818 and, as already noted, a fellow of the Royal Society of Literature in 1825. He was one of the initial members of the Political Economy Club, founded in 1821, and regularly attended the monthly meetings. He proposed questions for discussion and participated in the debates, where with the support of Cazenove he was often opposed to Ricardo and James Mill. In 1834, with Richard Jones, Charles Babbage, and others, he inaugurated the Statistical Society of London (later the Royal Statistical Society).<h2>
<a name="Personalityanddeath"></a>Personality and death</h2>In appearance Malthus was described as tall, slender, elegantly formed, and handsome, with dark eyes and naturally curled hair. When he was an undergraduate his hair was fair and he let it hang in ringlets on his neck&#151;which was unusual at the time, when the fashion was pigtails and powder&#151;but in later life (as in the 1833 portrait by J. Linnell in Haileybury College) his curled hair was auburn and cut short. In character he was said by Maria Edgeworth to be &#145;a perfectly unaffected, amiable, gentlemanlike man, who really <i>converses</i>; that is, listens, as well as talks&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters from England</span>, 64), and she declared him to be &#145;of strict truth, perfect integrity and rational benevolence&#146;  (ibid., 331). Her views are corroborated by Otter, who believed that the most remarkable feature of Malthus's mind was his love of truth. Otter and other friends also paid tribute to his steadiness and moderation&#151;characteristics that reflected in his own person the &#145;doctrine of proportions&#146; (or the concept of the optimum), which played such a key role in his political economy.<br>
<br>Malthus's seriousness of purpose and moderation co-existed with a keen sense of humour and an enjoyment of physical recreation. Especially in his younger days he was said to be habitually cheerful and playful, and a source of amusement to his companions. He once acknowledged that, even as a boy, he had always been of a remarkably mischievous disposition. His recreational activities, encouraged by his father, included skating, boating, cricket, swimming, and shooting, but were interrupted at Cambridge by severe bouts of rheumatism. His correspondence with his father shows that they shared a great interest in the theatre and in botany.<br>
<br>Alongside this mildness and humour there was a combative side to Malthus's character. He insisted that he preferred discussion in private to controversy in public, and he stated that he wished for nothing more than a quiet living in the country, but when the occasion arose he was prepared to debate vigorously in the public arena, and was eager to exert an influence on the course of political events. Empson remarked that Malthus, unlike the storm petrel, did not relish storms, but &#145;usually turned out in one&#146;  (Empson, 496).<br>
<br>Malthus died on 29 December 1834 at Bath while on a family visit to his wife's parents. He died after a few days' illness, the cause being described as a &#145;disorder of the heart, of which it was believed that he was never conscious&#146;  (Otter, xlii). He was buried on 6 January 1835 in Bath Abbey. A memorial tablet, probably written by Otter, reads &#145;one of the best men and truest philosophers of any age or country &hellip; He lived a serene and happy life devoted to the pursuit and communication of truth&#146;  (James, <span class="italic">Travel Diaries</span>, 302). He bequeathed all his personal property to his wife, and recommended that she in turn divide her property equally between their two surviving children, a request that she duly carried out. In 1949 a great-great-nephew of Malthus, Reginald Arthur Bray, of the Manor House, Shere, presented the <span class="roman">Malthus Library</span> (containing items collected by Daniel Malthus, by Malthus, and by other members of the family) to Jesus College, Cambridge, and donated Malthus's working copy of his <span class="italic">Principles of Political Economy</span>, with extensive manuscript revisions, to the Marshall Library of Economics at Cambridge.<br>
