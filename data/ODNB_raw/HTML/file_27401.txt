<span class="headword">Thirkleby <span class="st"> [Thurkilbi]</span>,  Roger  of</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1260), <span class="occ">justice</span>, was the son and heir of Thomas of Thirkleby, a man of no great importance who took his name from a hamlet of that name, in the parish of Kirby Grindalythe in the East Riding of Yorkshire. It is not clear how Roger came to work in the courts, only that by Michaelmas term 1230 he was a clerk of the bench, and by the end of 1231 he was the clerk of the bench to justice William of Raleigh. A clerk called Roger who worked for William of York was probably Roger of Whitchester rather than Roger of Thirkleby, but it is nevertheless a possibility that Thirkleby owed his introduction to the royal service to William, a fellow Yorkshireman. In 1235 or 1236 he renounced his clerical orders and married Letice, daughter of Peter of Edgefield of Norfolk, and widow of William de Roscelin.<br>
<br>Thirkleby apparently remained as a clerk until Trinity term 1242, when he was promoted to justice. However, he was mentioned as a justice in a single final concord of the previous term, and had already served as an eyre justice, on the circuit of William of York, and as a puisne justice on eyres held between January 1240 and November 1241, after which he undertook gaol deliveries in Norfolk and Suffolk before receiving his promotion. He continued as a puisne bench justice until 1249, although he spent much of his time away on eyre in the counties. He was chief justice on three eyres in the south-west in 1243 and 1244, and then from 1245 to 1252 he and his colleague Henry of Bath were the leading eyre justices. He led groups of justices on the brief circuit of 1245, the major country-wide visitation of 1246 to 1249, and a brief circuit of 1251 to 1252, before withdrawing from eyres to concentrate on work at the bench. He had succeeded Bath as senior justice there early in Michaelmas term 1249, remaining until Trinity 1251, except for a visit to the continent with Richard, earl of Cornwall, and others in Hilary term 1250, after which he went on eyre. He returned to the bench, again as senior justice, in Michaelmas term 1252, receiving a salary of 100 marks p.a. In Hilary 1256, however, he again returned to eyres to complete work on a lengthy country-wide circuit which had been begun in 1252, taking over a group of justices earlier led by Simon of Wauton. The eyres were brought to an end in 1258, first by famine and then by political uncertainty. Thirkleby returned as senior justice of the bench in Michaelmas term 1258, remaining in that office until his death, which occurred shortly before 13 June 1260, when his name suddenly disappeared from the feet of fines (though the <span class="italic">Flores historiarum</span> incorrectly says that he lived until about 24 August). In all he took part in fifty-one eyres, in thirty-eight of them as chief justice. Many of his eyre rolls have survived, including thirteen from the eyres of 1246 to 1249, the most impressive group of eyre rolls to survive for any justice up to that time. His service as a justice of assize is also reflected in two assize rolls of his, covering the years from 1249 to 1260, which have likewise survived, as have a number of his bench rolls. His clerk, by 1257, was Robert of Beverley, from his native East Riding of Yorkshire.<br>
<br>It is difficult to assess the work and influence of a justice living at a time from which no law reports survive, but it is clear from contemporary opinions and the length of his career that Thirkleby was a great judge. The death of Matthew Paris a year earlier than Thirkleby has denied us his obituary of a man with whom he was personally acquainted, but the author of the <span class="italic">Flores historiarum</span> considered him to be second to none in the kingdom in justice and the laws of the land. His judgements are mentioned in a number of thirteenth-century treatises, including the <span class="italic">Summa magna</span> attributed to Ralph Hengham. Paris records Thirkleby's disapproval of the introduction of a particular legal principle from the church courts into the lay civil courts, likening it to the pollution of a stream with a poison. He is not known to have taken a significant part in politics, although in 1252 a speech reported by Paris shows his resentment of the power of the Poitevin faction at court, and he was able to work with the reformers who were in power after 1258, since in 1259 he was one of those appointed to sell the king's wardships and choose sheriffs.<br>
<br>As a man of property Thirkleby's first recorded action was in 1233, when he secured exemption from suit of local courts and service on juries in respect of his lands in Thirkleby, Kirby Grindalythe, Newton, and Swaythorpe in the East Riding of Yorkshire. In the course of his career he added to his ancestral estates in the county, mainly in the area of the upper Derwent valley and the wolds, in such places as Wintringham, North Duffield, Knapton, East Heslerton, Gilling, Helperthorpe, Rudston, Weaverthorpe, Lowthorpe, East Lutton, and Sledmere, and also at Paull, Ottringham, and Keyingham in Holderness. In 1247 and 1250 he received grants of free warren over his demesnes in Thirkleby, Helperthorpe, and Duffield, and in 1253 the grant of a weekly market in Driffield. Thirkleby's marriage gave him life interests in Norfolk to which he added by lease and purchase, acquiring property in Erpingham, Pulham St Mary, Caister St Edmunds, Tuttington, Mattishall, Bodham, and Heckingham. Like his close colleague Henry of Bath, he also came to have interests in the Holland area of Lincolnshire, then being reclaimed from the fens, at Gedney, Fleet, Whaplode, Sutton, and Holbeach; his holdings included much marsh land. Among minor interests was property in Leicestershire, at Hallaton, and he had town houses in Bury St Edmunds and Westminster. The heir of Thirkleby's wife was Thomas de Roscelin, the son of her first marriage; she and Roger seem to have had no surviving children, since his ultimate heir was his brother Thomas who, although he held no administrative office, often witnessed royal charters and was therefore probably a royal counsellor. As his executors Thirkleby appointed Simon, abbot of Langley, Thomas of Heslerton, and Master Roger of Heslerton.<br>
