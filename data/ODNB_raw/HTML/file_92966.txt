<span class="headword">Bean,  Hugh Cecil</span>  (1929&#150;2003), <span class="occ">violinist</span>, was born on 22 September 1929 at 80 Croydon Road, Beckenham, Kent, the son of Cecil Walter Claude Bean, naval engineer, and his wife, Gertrude Alice, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Chapman. At the time of his birth his parents were living at 31 Hampden Road, Beckenham. As the son of an enthusiastic amateur violinist he soon became interested in the instrument that would dominate his life. He was given his first lessons by his father at the age of five. With the advantage of perfect pitch, he progressed quickly and was taken to the renowned British violinist Albert Sammons when he was nine. Bean remained a pupil of Sammons for twenty years and was influenced profoundly by his teacher's approach as a performer and as a pedagogue. Aged fourteen, and still a student at Beckenham grammar school, he won a scholarship to the Royal College of Music. There he was awarded the principal's prize at the age of seventeen and, later, the queen's prize. With the exception of some short periods as a teacher at the Royal Academy of Music, he was connected with the college throughout much of his career and was a professor of violin there between 1954 and 1992.<br>
<br>In 1949 Bean was the first national serviceman to be admitted to the Grenadier Guards. With the guards he led a string group, continued to study at the Royal College of Music, and was nicknamed the Catgut Grenadier. From 1950 he was engaged as leader of the Harvey Phillips String Orchestra and as leader of a chamber orchestra conducted by the horn-player Dennis Brain. That year he won second prize in the International Carl Flesch competition, and in 1952 he was awarded the Boise Foundation travelling award, which enabled him to study with Andr&eacute; Gertler at the Brussels Conservatoire, where he won first prize for both solo and chamber playing.<br>
<br>In 1951 Bean had joined the Philharmonia Orchestra as a member of the second violins. His talent was immediately apparent and he was promoted to co-leader of the orchestra in 1955 and leader in 1957. Having replaced Manoug Parikian at the front desk, he was able to observe many of the world's leading conductors at work. Although he could be cynical about them, he readily acknowledged talent and was prepared to work tirelessly for those he admired. He was particularly impressed by Leopold Stokowski and was concerned that with the death of figures such as Herbert von Karajan, Otto Klemperer, and Sir John Barbirolli the era of the great conductor was nearing its end. After two years with the BBC Symphony Orchestra (1967&#150;9), where he shared the leadership with Eli Goren, and a short period as leader of the London Symphony Orchestra, he embarked on a freelance career, but returned to the front desk of the Philharmonia in 1990, and was appointed leader emeritus of the orchestra in 1994. He went on more than ninety overseas tours with the Philharmonia Orchestra and remarked laconically in 1992 that touring had much in common with army life: &#145;I play, I travel, and I sleep. That's it. I don't go sightseeing. And I eat when I can&#146;  (<span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span>). His dry wit was much admired by his colleagues and his authority was always exercised with discretion.<br>
<br>Although remembered primarily as an orchestral leader, Bean was also a distinguished chamber musician. Having gained some early performing experience by playing at Kenneth Golightley's teatime series for the Overseas League with Alexander Gibson (piano) and Dorothy Browning (cello), he later founded the Boise Trio with the pianist David Parkhouse and the cellist Eileen Croxford. He then went on to establish the Music Group of London in 1966 with Parkhouse, Croxford, the horn-player Alan Civil, and the clarinettist Bernard Walton. With that ensemble he toured regularly for the British Council and performed in both east and west Beirut during the Lebanese civil war, a time when many refused to travel between the two sectors of the city. In the 1980s he visited Denmark each summer, where he taught and took part in a chamber music course with the Music Group of London and, later, the London Music Phoenix, which he founded with Keith Puddy (clarinet), Shelagh Sutherland (piano), and Lionel Handy (cello).<br>
<br>Blessed with an outstanding technique, Bean seemed destined for a career as a soloist. But from his vantage point at the front desk, he was able to observe the demands placed on touring virtuosi and quickly dismissed the idea of becoming a soloist. Nevertheless he was engaged to play Elgar's violin concerto with Sir Adrian Boult at the Three Choirs festival in 1969, and in 1972 made an acclaimed recording of the work with Charles Groves. Consequently Bean was bombarded with requests to perform as a soloist, and later made a well-received recording of Vaughan Williams's <span class="italic">The Lark Ascending</span> with Boult. Although more comfortable as a leader than as a soloist, he made his final public appearance in 2002 as a soloist. That year, he played Bach's concerto for two violins in D minor with his student Jonathan Josephs, in memory of another former student.<br>
<br>Bean had married Mary Dorothy Harrow, a 29-year-old secretary and daughter of Henry Unwin Harrow, brewer, at St Luke's Catholic Church, Love Lane, Pinner, on 16 April 1963. They had met in the 1950s when she worked for the Philharmonia Orchestra as a string fixer. They had one daughter, Fiona. At their home in Beckenham, Bean pursued his interest in model aeroplanes and model steam engines. He built a 4.5 inch gauge model railway at the end of his garden, and could be regularly found operating it wearing his engine driver's cap. He was made an Hon. ARCM in 1961, FRCM in 1968, and CBE in 1970. He died of heart failure at the Princess Royal University Hospital, Farnborough, on 26 December 2003, and was survived by his wife and daughter.<br>
