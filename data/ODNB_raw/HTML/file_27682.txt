<span class="headword">Tregian,  Francis</span>  (1548&#150;1608), <span class="occ">recusant gentleman</span>, was born in 1548 at Golden Manor, near Probus, Cornwall, the son of John Tregian (1520&#150;1575) and his wife, Katherine (<i>c</i>.1520&#150;<i>c</i>.1580), eldest daughter of Sir John Arundell of Lanherne and his wife, Elizabeth. He received his early education at home before spending the years 1560&#150;72 on the continent. About 1570 he married Mary (<i>c</i>.1550&#150;<i>c</i>.1620), eldest daughter of Charles, seventh Lord Stourton, and Anne, daughter of Edward, earl of Derby.<br>
<br>At the age of twenty-four Tregian returned from the continent to serve at the court of Elizabeth I. His zeal for the Catholic faith and his refusal to accept awards and advances from the queen led to his dismissal from court. On his return to Golden Manor he sought to strengthen the faith of his fellow Catholics by engaging a seminary priest, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18440/', "Cuthbert Mayne")</script>. Mayne had been recently ordained at the English College in Douai founded by William Allen. The queen summoned Sir George Carey, the knight marshal, to proceed against Tregian. Orders were sent to Richard Grenville, sheriff of Cornwall, who surrounded Golden with more than one hundred armed men on the feast of Corpus Christi, 8 June 1577. Tregian, Mayne, and thirty-one other Cornish recusants were arrested. The grateful queen bestowed a knighthood on Grenville for the way he had dealt with this &#145;matter of religion&#146;  (Bushnell, 121). Cuthbert Mayne was put to death on 30 November 1577 as a &#145;terror to the papists&#146;  (Anstruther, 226). Initially charged at Launceston on 16 September 1577 Tregian suffered many trials and was eventually found guilty in 1579 of aiding and abetting Cuthbert Mayne. By a sentence of <i>praemunire</i> he became the first Catholic under Elizabeth to forfeit all his lands and goods and was ordered to remain in prison for life. From Launceston he was taken to London, and was held at Marshalsea prison in Southwark, the queen's bench, and lastly in the Fleet prison, Ludgate. His wife was able to visit him in prison and altogether there were twelve children of the marriage. After appeals Tregian was given leave to go on parole in Chelsea in 1601.<br>
<br>In 1603, on the accession of James I, Tregian left once again for the continent, visiting the college at Douai in 1603. In Brussels he saw his son Francis again, and on his arrival in Madrid the king of Spain, Philip III, arranged a triumphant procession for him in the royal coach. He lived on a pension of sixty cruzados a month. He died in the Jesuit hospital at St Roque, Lisbon, on 25 September 1608, and was buried in the floor of St Roque church. On 25 April 1625 his grave was opened. According to Ignatius Stafford his body was found perfect and he was re-buried one year later, by English Catholics, standing up in the marble pulpit of the same church to honour the way he had stood up to Elizabeth. The inscription on the tomb describes &#145;Dom Francisco Tregian&#146;, an &#145;illustrious English gentleman who died in the city of Lisbon with great fame and saintliness&#146;.<br>
<br>Francis Tregian (1574&#150;1617), his eldest son, was born at Golden Manor, and was educated at Eu, Douai, and Rome, where he was described as &#145;very noble, twenty years old, a happy and natural genius extremely proficient in philosophy, music and the Latin language&#146;  (Knox, 356). He worked for Cardinal Allen in Rome and delivered his funeral address there in 1594. He also worked for Albert, archduke of the Spanish Netherlands, and these facts were held against him when he returned to England. When his attempt to regain Golden Manor failed he was imprisoned in the Fleet in 1614. While there he was known to have been working on an important book for two years. Scholars are agreed that he was transcribing and arranging the music for the collection known as the Fitzwilliam virginal book, now kept in the Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge. This important document contains works by William Byrd, who wrote the work <span class="italic">Tregian's Ground</span> for the family. Tregian was buried in St Bride's Church, Fleet Street, on 11 August 1617.<br>
