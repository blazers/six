<span class="headword">Blenkinsop,  John</span>  (1783&#150;1831), <span class="occ">developer of the steam locomotive</span>, was born near Leeds and became the principal agent of the Brandling family, who owned the extensive Middleton collieries in that district. On 10 April 1811 he obtained a patent for a new type of locomotive, developing some of the ideas embodied in the engine constructed by Richard Trevithick in 1803, but combining with them a new plan to overcome the presumed lack of adhesion between the engine wheels and smooth rails. This was effected by means of a racked or toothed rail, laid along one side of the road, into which the toothed wheel of the locomotive worked as pinions work into a rack. The boiler of Blenkinsop's locomotive was a plain cylinder of cast iron, with one flue&#151;the fire being at one end and the chimney at the other. It was supported on a carriage resting without springs directly on two pairs of wheels and axles, which were unconnected with the working parts, and served merely to support the weight of the engine on the rails, traction being achieved by the cogwheel working into the toothed rack. The engine had two cylinders instead of one as in Trevithick's engine. The invention of the double cylinder was due to Matthew Murray, of the firm of Fenton, Murray, and Wood, one of the best mechanical engineers of his time; Blenkinsop, who was not himself a mechanic, consulted him about all the practical details. The connecting rods gave the motion to two pinions by cranks at right angles to each other. These pinions communicated the motion to the wheel which worked into the cogged rail.<br>
<br>The first experiment with Blenkinsop's engine was made on the afternoon of Wednesday 24 June 1812 when, according to a report in the <span class="italic">Leeds Mercury</span> (27 June 1812), the machine ran from the coal staithe to the top of Hunslet Moor, where six and afterwards eight wagons of coal, each weighing 3&frac14; tons, were hooked to the rear. This immense weight was subsequently augmented by about fifty spectators mounted on the wagons. The return journey, a distance of about a mile and a half, was performed in twenty-three minutes, without incident. The machine was stated to be capable, when lightly loaded, of moving at a speed of 10 miles per hour. A drawing and description of it with the official specification were given in the <span class="italic">Leeds Mercury</span> (18 July 1812).<br>
<br>Blenkinsop's locomotive has an undoubted claim to be considered the first commercially successful engine employed on any railway. By the end of 1813 three engines were at work at the Middleton collieries and it is a tribute to Blenkinsop's reputation that others were to be found at Orell colliery in Lancashire and at the Coxlodge and Fawdon wagon-ways near the Tyne. According to contemporary accounts these locomotives proved reliable and economical in service, at least as employed on the Middleton line where they operated until the early 1830s. Despite this evident commercial success, Blenkinsop's locomotives represented an engineering cul-de-sac and it was left to George Stephenson to prove the superiority of the smooth edge-rail over the rack-rail transmission.<br>
<br>Stephenson had observed one of the &#145;Leeds engines&#146; at Coxlodge on 2 September 1813, and his first locomotive, <i>Blucher</i>, constructed at Killingworth, near Newcastle upon Tyne, was built to a large extent after the Blenkinsop pattern. Thereafter, however, Stephenson focused on the vital links between the weight of locomotives, their tractive effort, and the quality of the permanent way. The result, by 1820, was the practical demonstration of locomotive power reliant on the adhesion of flanged wheels running on smooth edge-rails.<br>
<br>Blenkinsop died at Leeds on 22 January 1831, after a long illness, aged forty-eight. A beautiful model of his engine of 1812 was exhibited at a <i>conversazione</i> of the Leeds Philosophical Society in December 1863, and a photograph of this model with explanatory notes was placed in the Leeds Philosophical Hall.<br>
