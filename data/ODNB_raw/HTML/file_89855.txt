<span class="headword">Jenner,  Henry</span>  (1848&#150;1934), <span class="occ">librarian and promoter of the Cornish language</span>, was born on 8 August 1848 at Union Hill, St Columb Major, Cornwall, the elder son and eldest of the six children of Henry Lascelles Jenner (1820&#150;1898), curate of St Columb, and his wife, Mary Isabel (1819&#150;1900), daughter of Captain William Finlaison RN, of Thurso, and his wife, Marion. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/10255/', "Sir Herbert Jenner-Fust (1778&#150;1852)")</script> was his paternal grandfather. From 1852 the family was settled in Kent, where Jenner's father held a living (in 1866 he was consecrated bishop of Dunedin, New Zealand, but the diocese rejected him because of his high-church views). Between 1858 and 1865 Jenner attended St Mary's College, Harlow, Essex, a school for sons of more extreme Anglo-Catholics, where &#145;the discipline was &hellip; irregular, the scholarship inaccurate, and everything &hellip; ramshackle&#146;  (Jenner, <span class="italic">George Knottesford Fortescue</span>, 15). It was none the less here that he first discovered specimens of written Cornish and determined to learn all he found.<br>
<br>Jenner returned to Cornwall in 1867, during a break from work as a schoolteacher. One of his excursions was to Paul churchyard, where he studied the Cornish wording on the monument to Dolly Pentreath, widely supposed to have been the last Cornish monoglot. On 4 January 1869 he became a clerk in the court of probate in London, and soon began studying Cornish material in the British Museum library. On 5 July 1870 he was appointed as assistant in the British Museum's department of manuscripts. Through his work and his active social life he became acquainted with major society figures, including Dickens, Ruskin, and Gladstone. He joined the Philological Society in 1871 and read his first paper (&#145;The Cornish language&#146;) on 21 March 1873. In 1875 he visited west Cornwall to research the remains of Cornish still used by some local people.<br>
<br>On 12 July 1877 Jenner married Kitty Lee Rawlings [<i>see below</i>]. He had consulted her father during fieldwork on Cornish and in 1873 had begun a correspondence with her. Their honeymoon was the first of many tours together on the mainland of Europe, where they made several eminent contacts. Also in 1877 Jenner discovered lines from an unknown play in Cornish of <i>c</i>.1400, the &#145;Charter Fragment&#146; (on the back of what is now BL, Add. Ch. 19491). On 27 December 1877 he attended the commemoration at Paul of the centenary of Dolly Pentreath's death. The Jenners' only child, Cecily Katharine Ysolt (later Sister Mary Beatrix Jenner of the order of the Visitation) was born on 21 June 1878.<br>
<br>Helped by his wife in the field of sacred art, Jenner collaborated with Walter de Gray Birch on <span class="italic">Early Drawings and Illuminations</span> (1879). In the same year, he secured a transfer to the British Museum's department of printed books. On 1 March 1883 he was elected a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries and later served on its council. His adaptation of space-saving moveable shelving at the museum library in 1887 earned him a &pound;100 gratuity from the relieved trustees. His final promotion was to the post of assistant keeper in 1900, and his last major professional task was to help reorganize the reading room reference books in 1907.<br>
<br>A tory and a committed Jacobite, Jenner and his wife were involved with the Order of the White Rose (OWR), a society of Stuart sympathizers of which he was chancellor, conducting the order's rituals. (The Jenners first visited Scotland in 1892, and Scots Gaelic was one of his many languages.) He also actively supported <span class="italic">The Royalist</span>, a journal which ran from 1890 to 1905, and organized several exhibitions at the New Gallery, Regent Street, including the Stuart exhibition in 1889: it was said that Queen Victoria snubbed him because of the legitimist views promoted by these exhibitions. He withdrew from active involvement with the OWR before the First World War but remained fervently royalist and right-wing.<br>
<br>At the turn of the twentieth century, at the instigation of Louis C. R. Duncombe Jewell (later known as Ludovick C. R. D. J. Cameron), Jenner resumed his Cornish studies after a gap of over twenty years. On 15 August 1901 the short-lived Cowethas Kelto-Kernuak (Celtic-Cornish Society) was formed, with Jenner as vice-president responsible for the language. In 1903 he joined the Celtic Association and was made a bard of the Breton gorsedd (bardic assembly), taking Gwaz Mikael (Servant of Michael) as his bardic name. Both the Jenners felt a great affinity for Brittany, acknowledging Breton as the language closest to Cornish. His address to a Breton audience was, he thought, fairly well understood and probably the first set speech in Cornish for two centuries. His principal achievement, however, was <span class="italic">A Handbook of the Cornish Language</span> (1904), which is widely seen as the beginning of the Cornish revival. The book's preface contains Jenner's most often quoted dictum: &#145;Why should Cornishmen learn Cornish? &hellip; The question is a fair one, the answer is simple. Because they are Cornishmen&#146;  (p. xi). Shortly after publication Jenner delivered the address &#145;Cornwall: a Celtic nation&#146; before the Pan-Celtic Congress at Caernarfon, and Cornwall was accorded membership of the congress.<br>
<br>Jenner retired from the British Museum in May 1909, and he and his wife went to live in her home town of Hayle, Cornwall, in a house that they renamed Bospowes (&#145;The dwelling of rest&#146; in his own translation). He now focused on Cornish affairs, acting as Cornwall's main representative to the wider Celtic world. Bospowes became a cultural and social centre for the Cornish revival movement, and Jenner became known as the foremost authority on Cornish matters. Much of his scholarly work was channelled through the Royal Cornwall Polytechnic Society (president, 1916&#150;21) and the Royal Institution of Cornwall (president, 1921&#150;3). He also encouraged younger workers in the field, notably Robert Morton Nance, who revered Jenner as his mentor and successfully carried on his mission. Even at this period, however, Jenner maintained that &#145;Cornish will not be revived as a spoken language, nor will there ever again be a Cornish literature&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Celtic Conference, 1917</span>, 1918, 97), a prediction amply invalidated by events. On 15 July 1920 he was made an honorary MA by the University of Wales.<br>
<br>Nance, backed by Jenner, formed the first Old Cornwall Society (OCS) at St Ives in 1920, with Jenner as president. He became founder and president of the Hayle OCS on 10 February 1923 and president of the Federation of Old Cornwall Societies at its foundation in 1924. The first issue of the OCS journal <span class="italic">Old Cornwall</span> appeared in April 1925. In 1927 he was appointed honorary St Petrock lecturer in Celtic studies at the University College of the South-West. On 7 August 1928 eight Cornish people were initiated as bards of the Welsh gorsedd. They and the Jenners formed the nucleus of the modern Cornish gorsedd (Gorseth Kernow), first held on 21 September 1928 at Boscawen-Un near St Buryan (probable site of one of the ancient British gorsedds). Jenner, who had composed the Cornish gorsedd ceremony in 1907, was installed as first grand bard, taking the Cornish equivalent (now usually written Gwas Myghal) of his Breton bardic name.<br>
<br>Even as Jenner's health began to fail seriously, his activities included climbing Trencrom to light the annual midsummer bonfire (1931), presiding over the first Celtic congress to be held in Cornwall, in Truro (1932), and attending the first church service in Cornish for 250 years, at Towednack (1933). He had lived as a devout Anglo-Catholic but late in 1933 was formally received into the Roman Catholic Church. On his deathbed he intimated that the whole object of his life had been to inculcate in the Cornish people a consciousness of their Cornish identity. He died from uraemia on 8 May 1934 at Bospowes and was buried in the cemetery of the church of St Uny, Lelant, on 12 May. His memory is honoured by the award of the Jenner medal for Cornish scholarship, first conferred in 1936.<br>
<br>Jenner's extensive writings included scholarly articles across the whole range of Cornish themes, Celtic and Arthurian research, liturgiology, manuscript and royalist studies, and poems, songs, and hymns in various languages. While highly cultured, he possessed a humorous and convivial side, was interested in music and amateur dramatics, and was familiarly known as Harry or Hal. Physically he was tall and well-built, an imposing, patriarchal figure (particularly in full beard and bardic robes), reflecting his strong personality and intellect as well as his enormous influence over the Cornish movement and iconic status within it. It has been observed that much of the ethos of the movement's early period constituted a middle-class, apolitical harking back to a semi-mystical, pre-industrial, Catholic Cornwall. None the less, without the vision and prodigious work rate of the pioneers, notably Jenner himself, the platform from which the movement has expanded and matured would not have existed. Jenner was able to combine his romantic vision of Cornwall with genuine scholarship, while his conviction of separate Cornish nationhood and his local patriotism went along with loyalty to Great Britain and the empire. He retains a unique position within the history of the Cornish revival.<br>

<a name="cosubject_89855"></a><span class="headword">Kitty Lee Jenner <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Rawlings]</span></span>  (1853&#150;1936), <span class="occ">author and artist</span>, was born on 12 September 1853 at Hayle Foundry, Cornwall, the elder daughter of William John Rawlings (1815&#150;1890), engineering agent, and his wife, Catherine (1822?&#150;1879), daughter of John Hambly, engineer and ironmonger, and his wife, Catherine. W. J. Rawlings, the father of two sons by a second marriage in 1882, was highly cultured and financially successful. In 1867 he commissioned a large family house named The Downes, on the outskirts of Hayle. His daughter received a home education and from 1873 studied art in London, at the National Art Training School, South Kensington, and the Slade School of Fine Art. By this time she had apparently converted from Anglicanism to Roman Catholicism, though her marriage to Henry Jenner took place in St Erth parish church.<br>
<br>Kitty Lee Jenner's artwork included European sketches and domestic watercolours, but greater recognition came as a writer. The first of her six novels (published under the name Katharine Lee) was <span class="italic">A Western Wildflower</span> (1882), and perhaps the most interesting was her last, <span class="italic">When Fortune Frowns: being the Life &hellip; of Gilbert Coswarth, a Gentleman of Cornwall, how he Fought for Prince Charles in &hellip; 1745 and 1746</span> (1895). Other publications included <span class="italic">In the Alsatian Mountains</span> (1883; a description of a tour with her husband in 1882), three books on Christian art and symbolism published in the first decade of the twentieth century, and the poems in <span class="italic">Songs of the Stars and the Sea</span> (1926). She was made a bard of the Welsh gorsedd in 1904; her bardic name was Morvoren. Her work was initially more widely known than her husband's, a position that was reversed with the progressive enhancement of his status. The couple functioned as a devoted partnership of interests and priorities. She died from myocarditis on 21 October 1936 at Bospowes and was buried with her husband at Lelant on 24 October.<br>
