<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Carden, Sir  Sackville Hamilton</span>  (1857&#150;1930), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, the third son of Captain Andrew Carden, 60th rifles, and his first wife, Anne, eldest daughter of Lieutenant-General Sackville Hamilton Berkeley, was born at Templemore, co. Tipperary, on 3 May 1857. He entered the navy in 1870. He took part in the Egyptian and Sudan campaigns of 1882&#150;4, and, under Admiral Sir Harry Holdsworth Rawson, one of the most efficient officers of his time, served in the 1897 Benin expedition. Carden was promoted captain in 1899, and rear-admiral in 1908. He was for two years on half pay, then hoisted his flag in the battleship <i>London</i> as rear-admiral in the Atlantic Fleet, an appointment tenable for only one year. This was followed by special service at the Admiralty.<br>
<br>In August 1912, Carden was selected to be admiral superintendent of Malta Dockyard, an appointment usually regarded as a precursor to retirement. However, upon the outbreak of war in August 1914, Carden was forced into a crucial role by the circumstances following the escape of the German warships <i>Goeben</i> and <i>Breslau</i> from the Mediterranean into Turkish waters. Although Admiral Sir Berkeley Milne, commander-in-chief in the Mediterranean, was officially held blameless for the incident, his continued presence in southern waters was incompatible, owing to his seniority, with the assumption by the French of the command of allied naval forces in the Mediterranean, in accordance with a naval convention concluded soon after the outbreak of the war. Carden, who had just attained the rank of vice-admiral, was chosen (20 September 1914) to command the British battle squadron associated with the French forces.<br>
<br>Following the closing of the Dardanelles by the Turks (27 September), war was declared between Great Britain and Turkey on 5 November, and simultaneously French and British warships, under Carden's command, carried out a preliminary bombardment of the outer forts of the straits. When, in January 1915, definite proposals to occupy the Gallipoli peninsula were being debated in the war council on Churchill's initiative, Churchill asked Carden (by cable) whether, in his opinion, the Dardanelles could be forced by ships alone. Carden replied that the straits could not be &#145;rushed&#146;, but that they &#145;might be forced by extended operations with large numbers of ships&#146;  (Higgins, 80)&#151;a reply contrary to orthodox naval theory and repeated staff studies. On Churchill's orders he drew up a detailed plan (submitted 11 January), involving the systematic destruction of the fortifications by naval bombardment and a subsequent invasion of the Peninsula, but insufficiently considering crucial questions concerning both the bombardment and minefields. There were strong differences of opinion in the war council when Churchill proposed Carden's plan; but pushed by Churchill, preparations for carrying it out were nevertheless begun, with the concurrence of the French and Russian governments. This diversion of forces was subsequently strongly opposed by Fisher; but approval of the Dardanelles operations was given by the war council on 28 January. Arrangements were made for the assembly of warships, and the 29th division was eventually chosen (10 March) to co-operate with the naval forces.<br>
<br>The first phase of the operations against the Dardanelles, the systematic bombardment of the outer forts, was begun on 19 February with the support of a large Anglo-French force of varied ships under the supreme command of Carden. It became known later in the war that successive bombardments of both the outer and intermediate defences (25 February &#150; 8 March) had proved ineffective as the Turks, warned by the preliminary attacks, had under German guidance greatly strengthened the defences on the Peninsula, besides developing the minefields to an effectiveness exceeding the expectations of British naval officers. The attacks were undertaken under conditions of great controversy, owing to the differences within the war council; and the full responsibility of command rested with Carden, who had failed to prepare adequately for the operations, to use his aircraft efficiently, and to improve his minesweeping. Faced with an admittedly very difficult situation, he failed to rise to the challenge. The strain on an officer who had not been employed at sea for several years and who was nearly sixty years old rapidly undermined his health. He was forced, on 16 March, to relinquish command to one of his flag officers, Rear-Admiral J. M. de Robeck, and return home.<br>
<br>From April until June 1915 Carden was appointed to the Admiralty on special service, and in October 1917, after being on half pay, he retired with the rank of admiral. Though controversy continued about his advice on the practicability of forcing the Dardanelles, he took no part in it.<br>
<br>Carden, who was created KCMG in 1916, was married twice: first, in 1879, to Maria Louisa, daughter of Captain Loftus J. Nunn (99th foot); second, in 1909, to Henrietta, daughter of William English Harrison KC of Hitchin, Hertfordshire, who survived her husband. He had one daughter, by his first marriage. He died on 6 May 1930 at his home, Highfield End, Lymington, Hampshire.<br>
<br>Contemporaries' opinions of Carden differed, but were largely critical. Fisher long distrusted his capabilities; Churchill&#151;though later willing to use Carden to advance his own Dardanelles initiative&#151;wrote in 1914 that Carden had done nothing remarkable; and General W. R. Birdwood, investigating for Kitchener in 1915, considered Carden &#145;very second-rate&#146;, lacking initiative, and over-optimistic. Naval historians have also criticized him. Roskill wrote that he had &#145;never been up to the heavy responsibility which had fortuitously fallen to his lot&#146;  (Roskill, 1.156), while Marder concluded that &#145;Carden was a charming man and an ideal peacetime admiral, but he had none of the qualities needed for an admiral at war in the technical age&#146;  (Marder, 15).<br>
