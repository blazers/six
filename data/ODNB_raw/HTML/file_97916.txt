<span class="headword">Popkess,  Athelstan Horn</span>  (1893&#150;1967), <span class="occ">police officer</span>, was born in Knysna, Cape Colony, on 23 November 1893, the third son in the family of three sons and two daughters of Edward Peter Popkess, a civil engineer, and his wife, Lilian, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Thorpe. His early years were spent in the small rural communities of the Cape before the family moved to Bulawayo, Southern Rhodesia. There was a &#145;boy's own&#146; quality attached to his life in southern Africa, which he later recounted in his autobiographical <span class="italic">Sweat in My Eyes</span> (1952), which covered his childhood adventures and war years in southern Africa, and thereafter retold in a series of articles and radio broadcasts.<br>
<br>Popkess was educated at Queen's College, Queenstown, Cape Colony, and subsequently at St George's College, Salisbury, Southern Rhodesia. A keen sportsman, he was a champion miler for Rhodesia, for whom he also played rugby against England in 1913. He spoke Afrikaans, Arabic, and Swahili, and later took a Russian language course at King's College, London. At the outbreak of the First World War he joined the Rhodesia regiment, serving in German South-West Africa before going to Britain, where in 1916 he was commissioned into the North Staffordshire regiment (1916). Returning to German South-West Africa, he shortly thereafter was seconded to 25th battalion, Royal Fusiliers (legion of frontiersmen), an irregular unit, and when this was disbanded, to the King's African rifles (1916&#150;18).<br>
<br>After contracting blackwater fever Popkess was invalided to England, where he worked briefly at the Ministry of Munitions. When the First World War ended he rejoined the 1st battalion, the North Staffordshire regiment, and was based at the Curragh, working as an &#145;Intelligence Officer in Ireland, in close co-operation with the Royal Irish Constabulary&#146;  (TNA: PRO, HO 45/24711) during the Anglo-Irish War of 1919&#150;21. After Irish independence he was seconded in 1922 to the Palestine gendarmerie. On 11 June 1923 he married, at Long Ditton, Surrey, Gilberta Lilian (1897&#150;1969), daughter of Richard Popkiss, civil engineer; they had two sons and two daughters. He returned to the 2nd battalion, North Staffordshires, in 1924, and in 1928 was seconded to be assistant provost marshal at Aldershot.<br>
<br>Towards the end of 1929 Popkess was appointed chief constable of Nottingham. His appointment was controversial, as he lacked a civilian police background, while three serving chief constables who had formed an original shortlist had been passed over in his favour. In December 1929 a majority of Labour members of Nottingham city council moved a resolution that the Nottingham watch committee should reconsider Popkess's appointment, as &#145;his experience and outlook&#146; was &#145;purely Military in character, and differing fundamentally from those demanded in the Civil Police&#146;. Moreover, they contended that it was &#145;asking too much of the Nottingham citizen to accept as Chief Constable one of the Black and Tans&#146;  (TNA: PRO, HO 45/24711). The <span class="italic">Police Review</span>, the Superintendents' Association, and the Police Federation similarly and unsuccessfully protested to the Home Office that &#145;such appointments as these are causing great dissatisfaction in the Police Forces of the Country&#146;  (ibid.). On 16 November 1929 Nottingham city council, largely along party lines, voted to support the appointment and J. R. Clynes, the home secretary in Ramsay MacDonald's Labour government, declined to intervene, arguing that such matters remained the prerogative of the watch committee.<br>
<br>Once in post Popkess proved an energetic leader, locally and nationally. He carried his enthusiasm for sport into his police career, and made an immediate impact; his Nottingham boxing team, coached by a former professional, came to prominence at the national police championships in 1932; controversially, he took the team on tours of Nazi Germany in 1935 and 1936. In 1931 a sports ground was acquired for the Nottingham force, which recruited several county cricketers. His influence was most considerable in the fields of road safety, and scientific and technological improvements in policing. By 1933 Nottingham had its own dedicated police forensic laboratory, which was contracting work for other forces. Perhaps his most visible contribution was the introduction of police patrol vehicles onto the streets of Nottingham. In <span class="italic">Mechanised Police Patrol</span> (1954), which amounted to a handbook for other police forces, he argued that &#145;mechanizing&#146; police patrolling enhanced significantly the capacity for surprise, mobility, concentration, and offensive action. Operational methods included the employment of &#145;special mission patrols&#146;, or Q-cars (vehicles camouflaged as tradesmen's vans, and the like). Roving mobility made two-way radio communication essential and Popkess was in the forefront of the introduction of this technology, which he described in &#145;Wireless communications and the mechanised crime patrol&#146; (in W. B. R. Morren, ed., <span class="italic">Advanced Lectures to Senior Police Officers in Scotland</span>, 1936, 183&#150;204). Personal radios for officers on the beat were successfully tested in Nottingham in 1958.<br>
<br>Popkess was a strong advocate of measures to improve traffic management, particularly as this related to accident prevention, where losses, he thought, were comparable to numbers of wartime casualties. His ideas were set out in his comprehensive manual <span class="italic">Traffic Control and Road Accident Prevention</span> (1951), where he pointed to evidence that where police were employed on accident prevention duty road casualties were reduced. He advocated the use of scientific testing of drivers to detect those driving under the influence of alcohol, believing that those who had consumed moderate amounts were more dangerous than those obviously unfit to drive, and deplored the acceptance of drink and driving, citing the provision of beer mats in public houses with the slogan &#145;Be a better driver&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 7 Oct 1959). He also criticized the simultaneous end of the working day, which poured impatient homeward drivers onto city roads between 5 p.m. and 6 p.m., the peak period for accidents.<br>
<br>Popkess had a gift for publicity, and his radio broadcasts brought the innovations of the Nottingham police to wider notice. He was awarded the king's police medal in 1935, and was appointed OBE in 1942 and CBE in 1956. Having obtained a divorce from his first wife, he married, on 27 January 1939, Dorothy Rosebudd (or Rosemary) Walsh (1905/6&#150;1956), daughter of Patrick Walsh; she died suddenly from an overdose of sleeping pills  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 28 Feb 1956).<br>
<br>During the late 1950s Popkess became involved in an escalating conflict with the watch committee, Nottingham's town clerk (Tom Owen), and the ruling Labour group of Nottingham city council, sparked, in part at least, by his preoccupation with traffic management. Tensions rose because of the refusal by the council to fund Popkess's requests for a new traffic warden corps, and more police housing. In the spring of 1959 he instigated a series of inquiries into alleged corrupt practices within the Labour group, having received anonymous information that three members of the Labour group who had visited the Zeiss optical factory in East Germany in connection with a council scheme to purchase a planetarium for Nottingham had received gifts of cameras valued at &pound;10 each from their hosts. There was a further allegation that Nottingham corporation workmen had undertaken building work to the value of &pound;25 at the home of a Labour councillor. Popkess brought in detectives from the special branch of Scotland Yard, who visited Nottingham in May 1959, but found no case to answer. The chief constable's opponents raised strong objections to the very public manner in which the initial investigations were conducted (including the leaking of confidential information about the police inquiries on the eve of local elections).<br>
<br>In June 1959 the Nottingham watch committee instructed Popkess to submit reports on his inquiries into local corruption. Following his repeated refusal to comply the committee suspended him on 8 July 1959. R. A. Butler, the home secretary, asserted the independence of chief constables from local political control or interference in enforcing the criminal law, and stated that Popkess would have been in breach of duty had he complied with the instruction of the watch committee. Demanding the reinstatement of Popkess, Butler threatened to withhold grants to Nottingham unless this was done (claiming tenuously that any force was deemed inefficient without its chief constable). In the interim the Labour group in Nottingham turned in on itself, prevaricating and refusing publicly to debate the issues, much to the disquiet of the party nationally. Amid allegations of socialist intolerance, a petition for the reinstatement of Popkess gained 6000 signatures, and a public meeting in his support held in the Old Market Square, Nottingham, attracted a crowd of several thousand. On 30 July the watch committee &#145;reluctantly&#146; agreed to reinstate Popkess, with effect from 9 August, but recorded its continuing lack of confidence in his impartiality  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 31 July 1959).<br>
<br>Popkess was due to retire at the end of 1959, and he left Nottingham in November that year. An article by him (<span class="italic">Criminal Law Review</span>, Oct 1960, 673&#150;7) reflecting on the racial disturbances that had broken out in the St Ann's Well Road area of Nottingham in August 1958 attracted renewed controversy. He also wrote and broadcast children's stories. In retirement he lived in Babbacombe, Devon, and died at the St John of God Nursing Home, Torquay, Devon, on 29 April 1967. After a funeral at Babbacombe he was cremated at Torquay.<br>
<br>The &#145;Popkess affair&#146; was successfully deployed by the Home Office as an example of the dangers of direct control of the police by elected representatives, and led to the appointment in January 1960 of a royal commission on the police, chaired by Sir John Willink. The resulting <span class="roman">Police Act</span> of 1964 significantly diminished the powers of watch committees and reduced the political representation on them, centralizing authority still further in the hands of Westminster and chief constables.<br>
