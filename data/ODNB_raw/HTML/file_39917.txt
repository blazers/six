</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Turner, Dame  Eva</span>  (1892&#150;1990), <span class="occ">singer</span>, was born on 10 March 1892 in Oldham, Lancashire, the elder child and only daughter of Charles Turner, chief engineer of a cotton mill, and his wife, Elizabeth Park. She was educated at Werneth council school, Oldham, until she was ten, when her father moved to Bristol to take up an appointment as manager of another mill in the south-west of England. There she heard her first opera, performed by the Royal Carl Rosa Opera Company, and so struck was she by this that she was determined to become a singer herself. Her parents were musical and gave her every encouragement, sending her for lessons to Daniel Rootham, who taught Clara Butt. Her studies were continued at the Royal Academy of Music in London from 1911 to 1915, during which time she was briefly betrothed. In 1915 she joined the chorus of the Royal Carl Rosa Opera Company: she entered her new life with enthusiasm and with the serious determination and commitment that were to characterize her life. When not singing in the chorus she never lost an opportunity to observe other performers from the wings, studying the action and learning the soprano repertory. Anxious for progress, she badgered the management to find her roles and she soon made her solo d&eacute;but as the page in <span class="italic">Tannh&auml;user</span>.<br>
<br>But Turner was still not satisfied, and on the advice of the company's principal tenor she began to work with an Australian singer, Richard Broad, who had recently joined the management of the Carl Rosa. He had sung as a bass under Hans Richter at Covent Garden, but it was as an authority on voice production that he was better known. This proved to be a most successful relationship, and Broad continued as her coach, adviser, and friend until his death some twenty-five years later.<br>
<br>The small parts became larger and by 1920 Eva Turner was assuming dramatic roles as her voice increased in power and weight. In that year the company gave a four-week season at Covent Garden, in which she sang Santuzza (<span class="italic">Cavalleria rusticana</span>), Musetta (<span class="italic">La Boh&egrave;me</span>), Leonora (<span class="italic">Il trovatore</span>), Butterfly (<span class="italic">Madama Butterfly</span>), Antonia (<span class="italic">The Tales of Hoffmann</span>), and Venus (<span class="italic">Tannh&auml;user</span>). The <span class="italic">Times</span> critic described her Leonora as promising. Another Covent Garden season followed a provincial tour in 1921. <span class="italic">Tosca</span> and <span class="italic">Lohengrin</span> were two operas added to her repertory that year. In 1922 she appeared as Eva in <span class="italic">The Mastersingers</span> with the Carl Rosa at Covent Garden, and won a favourable review from <span class="italic">The Times</span>.<br>
<br>In 1924 the Carl Rosa was at the Scala Theatre, London, for a four-week season, which was to be a turning point in Turner's career. Among other roles she sang Butterfly on 3 June, a performance with which <span class="italic">The Times</span> did not find entire favour but which so impressed Ettore Panizza, Arturo Toscanini's assistant at La Scala, Milan, that he asked her to sing to the maestro. She auditioned successfully and was offered Freia and Sieglinde in the 1924/5 La Scala season. Her characteristic loyalty persuaded her to tell La Scala that she was not free to accept because of her Carl Rosa contract. However, she was released from that and she spent the intervening period learning Italian and her roles in that language in preparation for her d&eacute;but, as Freia in <span class="italic">Das Rheingold</span>, conducted by Vittorio Gui.<br>
<br>Thus began the most important part of Turner's career and a love affair with Italy, one of the outcomes of which was the Italianate colouring, with strongly enunciated consonants, that she applied to her speaking voice. She was then to sing in many Italian cities, including Brescia, where she first sang Turandot with conspicuous success. This became the role with which she was most identified, though from all accounts her portrayal of Aida was equally outstanding. She built and settled in a villa on Lake Lugano.<br>
<br>By now Eva Turner's international career was developing rapidly, with appearances in Europe and in North and South America. She returned to Covent Garden in 1928 in a season managed by the Covent Garden Syndicate, and scored a major triumph with the press and public with Turandot. Nobody was prepared for such a magnificent performance. Nothing could then hold her back, and with her glorious voice she took a leading place in the seasons at Covent Garden and abroad until the outbreak of war in 1939. Small of stature, Eva Turner had a vocal command that was astonishing, with a voice of extraordinary sumptuousness and steadiness that could project through the loudest orchestral sound without any loss of quality. She surmounted all the technical challenges of the German and Italian repertoire and left her audiences spellbound. Turner's colossal success did much to encourage British opera singers, who at that time were probably more noted for dependability than brilliance and rarely given chances to prove anything else. An English name was a handicap and Eva Turner was urged to change hers. Proud of her Lancastrian roots, she refused.<br>
<br>Undoubtedly the war deprived Turner of the final climax to her career, including the conquering of audiences at the Metropolitan in New York. After a performance of Turandot in Brescia in 1940 she returned to England, where she spent the war singing in concerts for the armed forces and the radio, and in the Proms. A staunch patriot, this was what she believed she needed to do and she declined invitations to work in America.<br>
<br>In the 1947 and the 1948/9 seasons at Covent Garden Turner joined the newly formed company for Turandot, in which once again she astonished and thrilled the public and press. Then, in 1949, she accepted an invitation to teach at the University of Oklahoma for one year, and stayed for ten. After that she returned to London to teach at the Royal Academy of Music. Teaching occupied her for several more years and she passed on to many singers, established and young alike, her wealth of experience, with her inimitable generosity but also with a ferocious expectation of hard work and high standards in return. For her it was serious work that produced the results, however talented the individual. President of the Wagner Society from 1971 to 1985, she was appointed DBE in 1962. She was FRAM (1928), FRCM (1974), an honorary citizen of the state of Oklahoma (1982), and a first freeman of Oldham (1982). She was awarded honorary DMus degrees from Manchester (1979) and Oxford (1984) and became an honorary fellow of St Hilda's College, Oxford (1984).<br>
<br>Well into her nineties and still immaculately groomed and handsome, Turner maintained her enthusiasm and capacity for work, serving on committees and lecturing endlessly to music clubs and societies. She was constantly to be seen at opera performances and concerts, travelling and coaching with an eagerness and display of energy that left many breathless. She never married, probably because she believed she could not find the time for the kind of relationship that marriage demanded. She led an intensely busy life, ably assisted by Ann Ridyard, her companion and secretary for thirty-five years, whose descent into senile dementia caused Eva Turner's last years to be burdensome. Eva Turner died on 16 June 1990 in the Devonshire Hospital, Marylebone, London. A memorial service was held in Westminster Abbey on 5 February 1991.<br>
