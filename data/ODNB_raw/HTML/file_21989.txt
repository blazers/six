<span class="headword">Perrott, Sir  Richard</span>, second baronet  (1716&#150;1796), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was reportedly born in Shrewsbury, Shropshire, the eldest son of Richard Perrott of Broseley, Shropshire, and his wife, Rebecca, the daughter of J. Wyke of Wacton Court, Herefordshire, and was probably a descendant of the church musician and land speculator Robert Perrot (<i>c</i>.1478&#150;1550). Reliable information on Richard Perrott is sparse: the few sources provide the following account. He succeeded his uncle Sir Robert Perrott, first baronet (created 1 July 1716), diplomatist, in 1759. He was present at the battle of Culloden (16 April 1746) in personal attendance on William Augustus, duke of Cumberland. Later he entered the service of Frederick II of Prussia, served in the Seven Years' War (1756&#150;63), and was awarded the order of the Red Eagle. In October 1758 Frederick appointed Perrott lord high admiral with authority to establish a fleet, but the British government vetoed the appointment. Frederick used him in secret negotiations and awarded him the order of the Black Eagle, and Louis XIV created him a baron. In 1770, during the Wilkite disturbances, Perrott brought up the loyal Flint address and was thanked by the king. His support for the latter led to a mob demolishing his house at Gloucester View, Park Lane, London, and burning its costly contents in front of it. He was awarded a medal, a grant of the manor of Cheslemore, and other marks of royal approbation. On 3 March 1782 he married Margaret Jemima, the daughter of Captain William Fordyce, gentleman of the bedchamber to George III, and the great-grandniece of Archibald Campbell, first duke of Argyll. Their son Edward Bindloss Perrott succeeded as third baronet at Perrott's death in 1796. The baronetcy became extinct on the death of the sixth baronet, Sir Herbert Charles Perrott, on 15 February 1922.<br>
<br>In 1770 the scandalous and polemical <span class="italic">The Life, Adventures, and Amours of Sir R&#151; P&#151;</span> was published anonymously in London. It criticized the duke of Grafton for making &#145;such a wretch&#146; as Perrott his &#145;newly created favourite&#146; and alleged that Perrott was an adventurer of obscure origin, a thief, confidence trickster, and heartless reprobate, who was briefly in the slave trade. It also said that he befriended a rich widow, cheated her, and seduced and left pregnant both her and her daughter; the former went mad and the latter died in a workhouse. Attempting an elopement, he took &#145;some rather alarming liberties&#146; with his victim, so she rejected him. Exploiting his baronetcy and Prussian knighthood to impress the gullible, after further cheating, attempts to marry heiresses, and &#145;breaches of honour and hospitality&#146;, he became Grafton's prot&eacute;g&eacute; through a mistress, a Sadler's Wells rope dancer. The biography of 1770 may have been &#145;an ebullition of private malice&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>).<br>
