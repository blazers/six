<span class="headword">Douglas,  William</span>, first marquess of Douglas  (1589&#150;1660), <span class="occ">magnate and scholar</span>, was the eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7931/', "William Douglas, tenth earl of Angus (c.1554&#150;1611)")</script>, and his wife, Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. in or after 1611), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20709/', "Laurence Oliphant, fourth Lord Oliphant")</script>. From early childhood, the master of Angus was affected by the repercussions of his father's involvement in Catholic conspiracies. Taken into custody as a royal hostage, in 1596 he received by special arrangement the Douglas estates, which had been granted temporarily to the duke of Lennox, and in the following year he was released after suffering an accident. However, the conditions of his father's reinstatement stipulated that the Angus heir be handed over to his kinsman William Douglas, sixth earl of Morton (<i>d</i>. 1606), for education as a protestant. At the exceptionally young age of twelve he was contracted on 11 July 1601 to marry Margaret (1584/5&#150;1623), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/12057/', "Claud Hamilton, Lord Paisley (1546?&#150;1621)")</script>, and sister of James Hamilton, later first earl of Abercorn (1575&#150;1618). Although Lord Claud was a Catholic, his son, who had inherited the estates following the former's insanity, was a prominent protestant privy councillor. Meanwhile, the tenth earl of Angus had been reconciled to the kirk, but his allegiance became increasingly suspect and in 1608 he left Scotland, dying in exile in Paris on 3 March 1611.<br>
<br>In May 1612 William Douglas, now eleventh earl of Angus, appeared before the privy council as a result of altercations with the Kerrs of Ferniehirst over their respective rights to hold bailie courts in Jedburgh Forest. Angus's case was upheld by conciliar decision on the understanding that he could not hold a court with a gathering of more than sixty retainers. However, his more hotheaded brother Lord James Douglas was imprisoned at Blackness Castle for his part in antagonizing the Kerr family. On 8 August 1616 Angus obtained a royal licence to travel on the continent&#151;officially to relieve &#145;his disease and seikness&#146;  (Fraser, 2.416)&#151;a journey in which he was joined by William Douglas, seventh earl of Morton (1582&#150;1648), grandson of his former guardian. In August 1617 the earl of Mar's European agent, Schau, reported from Bourges that this Douglas party had &#145;concludit to begin thair travelling upon the 4 of September&#146;  (<span class="italic">Supplementary Mar and Kellie MSS</span>, 78), in a journey that was to encompass Lyons, Geneva, Marseilles, Bordeaux, La Rochelle, and Orl&eacute;ans. On his return to Scotland in 1619 Angus assumed a greater interest in the political affairs of the nation, attending the special conference of the council and nobility in November 1620, when he served on the committee to recommend fund-raising possibilities for the war effort in the Palatinate. Controversially, he insisted (unsuccessfully) on claiming, as traditional crown-bearer to the Scottish king, precedence over the marquess of Huntly in the procession which opened the ensuing parliament in January 1621. Angus very early demonstrated his loyalty to the Anglicizing policies of James VI and I, openly supporting the parliamentary ratification of the controversial five articles of Perth.<br>
<br>However, Angus's political activities soon gave way to his lifelong fascination with travel and genealogical research, both of which led him on 26 May 1623 back to the continent, leaving his wife, who died on 11 September, and the earl of Morton to assume responsibility for his financial affairs and the administration of his estates. He travelled throughout France and Italy, probably drawn to the latter mainly through his correspondence with the Italian nobleman Marc Antonio Scoto d'Agazano, who claimed kinship with the Douglases, albeit &#145;on somewhat mythical grounds&#146;  (<span class="italic">Scots peerage</span>, 1.203), but divided his time mainly between Paris (where he is known to have been based in November 1623) and Rome, where he paid a controversial visit to St Peter's in early 1625. The apparent lure of continental Catholicism alarmed his home presbytery of Lanark, whose elders interrogated him upon his return to Scotland that September, exhorting him to reassure his parishioners by attending services at his local parish kirk. Their concern over his religious integrity and annoyance at his sporadic church attendance continued to be expressed until his death.<br>
<br>Angus appears to have been favoured by Charles I, possibly owing to his careful political inactivity as a suspected Catholic and consistent covert loyalty to the king's manifestly episcopalian policies. On 10 March 1631 the king officially regranted him the earldom of Angus, restoring in addition his heritable rights to carry the crown during parliamentary processions and to cast the first vote. On 15 September 1632 at the Gordon stronghold of &#145;the Bog&#146; he married Lady Mary Gordon (1610/11&#150;1674), third daughter of the ageing marquess of Huntly. After spending a fortnight in Aberdeenshire, during which they visited the earl of Moray, Angus and Mary returned to a comparatively quiet life divided between Douglas Castle in Lanarkshire and Tantallon on the Lothian coast. In the following year Angus resumed his political career at Edinburgh in preparation for the king's state visit, having been personally selected by the king as commissioner of articles for parliament alongside the Catholic noble Winton. After bearing the crown in the coronation ceremony on 17 June 1633, Angus was made marquess of Douglas, earl of Angus, and lord of Abernethy and Jedburgh Forest. Yet he never exploited royal favour to gain national prominence, choosing this time to retreat from the increasingly complex political problems and ecclesiastical issues developing between Whitehall and Edinburgh and concentrate on his studies and expanding family, which eventually numbered six sons and ten daughters. He also began to strengthen his administrative control over his territories in Lanarkshire and Roxburghshire, an authority enhanced by his commission of justiciary for Walston parish, Lanark (1 August 1634), and appointment as justice of the peace for Lanark (18 September). Following the apparent increase in frontier lawlessness throughout the western border, Douglas was also enlisted in 1635 to appear on the new conjunct commission, an Anglo-Scottish collective originally instituted by King James thirty years earlier. In the following year the presbytery of Lanarkshire again registered its annoyance with the truant marquess, alleging that he had refused to permit his daughter to attend local church services.<br>
<br>After the renewal of his place on the border commission in September 1636 little was heard of Douglas until the signing of the national covenant in February 1638 and the subsequent outbreak of war. Douglas himself escaped to England before the troops of John Fleming, Lord Fleming began besieging Douglas Castle. Expecting a harsh reception and resistance, Fleming was surprised at how easily he was able to take the stronghold, which was occupied by the marchioness; she was permitted to remain in the castle due to her &#145;delicate health&#146;  (Baillie, 1.420). After the imposition of an uneasy peace in Scotland, on 27 March 1640 Charles forewarned both Douglas and his border kinsman Robert Maxwell, earl of Nithsdale, to re-garrison their castles in the light of his impending breach with the covenanters. In the context of further destabilization, the marquess shied away from active involvement in politics, and conspicuously absented himself from parliament on 17 November 1641, when his place as crown-bearer was assumed by the earl of Argyll.<br>
<br>By the time civil war broke out in England in 1642 Douglas was firmly established as a border magnate and scholar who only rarely participated in national events. His half-hearted commitment to the covenant can be observed in his refusal to assist Lanark presbytery in disciplining the &#145;braincracked&#146; young James Baillie of Todholes for regularly assaulting the minister of Dunsyre throughout 1642  (Fraser, 2.421 n. 4), and it was only under some pressure that he eventually signed the covenant in his parish kirk in Lanark in July 1644. His true interests lay in his genealogical work and in the preparation for publication of David Home of Godscroft's <span class="italic">History of the House of Douglas</span>, which was ultimately published by Evan Tyler in 1644. Encouraged by the marquess of Montrose's military success at Kilsyth in August 1645 Douglas was inspired to side with the royalist movement, which was then gaining new momentum in Scotland. After being awarded the lieutenancy of Clydesdale by Montrose, Douglas led a march on Hawick but found himself obliged to escape the defeat suffered by Montrose's forces at Philiphaugh on 13 September. This humiliation was followed by the death on 21 October of Douglas's third son, Colonel James Douglas, while serving in the French army at Douai. In April 1646 Douglas was himself imprisoned in Edinburgh Castle by the committee of estates, but later freed after admitting his breach of the terms outlined in the covenant and upon the payment of a fine.<br>
<br>In 1647 and 1648 Douglas maintained contact with the French diplomatic agent Montereul, with whom he discussed the plight of Catholic Scots and the breakdown of his relationship with his eldest son, Archibald Douglas (<i>c</i>.1609&#150;1655), styled since 1633 earl of Angus, who was initially a covenanter sympathizer and considered by his father as &#145;the principal author of the hardships that he has been made to endure&#146;  (Fotheringham, 225). However, both Douglas and his son Angus attended the coronation of Charles II on 1 January 1651, and the marquess took part in the Scottish parliaments at Perth and Stirling in 1651, when he served on the committees for the army and estates. His allegiance to the royalist effort earned him the distrust of Cromwell, who had him (and his son) charged with a fine of &pound;1000 under the 1654 <span class="roman">Act of Grace</span>, though this was later reduced to &pound;333 6<i>s</i>. 8<i>d</i>. on 6 April 1655 in recognition of his good faith and disempowerment. Despite this reduction, Cromwell's fiscal penalty symbolized the nullification of his powers as head of the house of Douglas and led him to reduce permanently his political activity, including any outward support for the exiled Stuart court. On 19 July 1654 the presbyterian Robert Baillie&#151;an erstwhile polemicist for the covenanters&#151;lamented that &#145;Dowglass and his sonne Angus are quyet men, of no respect&#146;  (Baillie, 3.249), a glaring indication of the deleterious social upheavals endured by the Scottish nobility over the previous decade. By 30 October eighteen Lanarkshire landholders certified the conformity and continuing good behaviour of the marquess, a sign that the presbytery of Lanark had won its long struggle with its patron, or that Douglas himself had given up the fight in favour of the quiet scholastic life. Angus died in Edinburgh on 16 April 1655, and Douglas's virtual disappearance from the political and ecclesiastical affairs of Scotland after this date made his own death at Douglas Castle on 19 February 1660 and subsequent burial in Douglas church something of a non-event, and one considerably overshadowed by the ensuing Restoration. He was succeeded as second marquess of Douglas by his grandson <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7896/', "James Douglas (c.1646&#150;1700)")</script>.<br>
