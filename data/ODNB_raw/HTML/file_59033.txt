<span class="headword">Jackson,  Georgina Frederica</span>  (1823/4&#150;1895), <span class="occ">writer on dialect</span>, was born in Everton, Liverpool, daughter of William Jackson, a Liverpool wine merchant; her only other relative known by name was a married sister, mentioned in her will. Of Shropshire parentage, she lived in rural mid-Shropshire in childhood from the age of nine or ten. Evidently well educated, by 1871 she was running a school for young ladies at 13 White Friars, Chester, offering a &#145;sound English education&#146; to boarders and day pupils. A photograph of her, probably taken in the 1870s, shows regular, strongly formed features, no less attractive for a slight severity of expression.<br>
<br>Casual reading in 1870 led Georgina Jackson to compile a list of Shropshire words remembered from childhood. Then a friend encouraged her to undertake a substantial work on the county dialect; the achievement for which she is remembered occupied a decade of her life, during which her vocation was teaching, literary work occupied her leisure hours, and holidays were devoted to dialecting tours. In three years she collected 3000 words, verifying them all herself. In 1873 she was advised by the philologist W. W. Skeat to record the locality from which each word came and to use the glossic symbols of A. J. Ellis (whom she also consulted). Applying their counsel thoroughly, she spent four years recasting her first three years' work.<br>
<br>In 1877 illness prevented Georgina Jackson's last planned tour, that of south-east Shropshire. She was awarded &pound;100 from the Royal Literary Fund in 1878, and her <span class="italic">Shropshire Word-Book</span> was issued in three parts from 1879 to 1881. It included a grammar and was one of the very best of its kind, but by the time it was published its author was an invalid. Granted a civil-list pension of &pound;40 about 1880, she gave up her school and moved to a smaller house nearby. She passed materials for her projected book on Shropshire folklore to her friend Charlotte Burne, who brought it out in 1883, duly acknowledging Georgina Jackson's work.<br>
<br>In later years, though confined to one room, often bedridden and in much pain, Georgina Jackson remained cheerful and courageous, living on very small means but keeping up her interest in dialect and etymology as correspondent and voluntary reader for the <span class="italic">English Dialect Dictionary</span>. She died aged seventy-one of chronic heart disease at her home, 11 Black Friars, Chester, on 16 October 1895. She was buried in Chester cemetery on 19 October; the dean and archdeacon of Chester officiated, both having been her parish priest.<br>
