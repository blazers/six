<span class="headword">Street,  (Cecil) John Charles</span> <span class="st"> [<em>pseuds. </em>John Rhode, Miles Burton, Cecil Waye]</span>  (1884&#150;1964), <span class="occ">army officer and writer of detective stories</span>, was born in Gibraltar on 3 May 1884, the son of General John Alfred Street CB (1822&#150;1889) and his second wife, Caroline, daughter of Charles Horsfall Bill. At the time of Cecil's birth his father was colonel of the 2nd battalion, the Cameronians (Scottish Rifles), stationed in Cawnpore, Bengal. Educated at Wellington College and the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich (1901&#150;3), he was commissioned into the Royal Garrison Artillery in July 1903; he served with 23 company at Fort Grange (the western land defences of Portsmouth harbour) and afterwards with 16 company at Clarence barracks in Portsmouth. He resigned his commission on 24 March 1906, one month after marrying Hyacinth Maud (<i>d</i>. 1949) of Fareham, Hampshire, daughter of Major John Denis Kirwan RA; in 1911 they were resident in Lyme Regis, Dorset, supported by his private income.<br>
<br>Following the outbreak of the First World War, Street rejoined the Royal Artillery as a lieutenant in the special reserve in September 1914. He served on the western front with the 23rd siege battery, taking part in the ill-fated battle of Loos in September 1915. On 9 November 1915 he was seriously wounded in the head, and was invalided to England until April 1916, when he returned to France. As acting major, he commanded the 335th siege battery from May until the end of July 1917, when he was severely dazed by a shell burst, but remained on duty for over six hours until collapsing (an action for which he was awarded the MC in January 1918). Following convalescence, but now permanently unfit for active service, he was posted in September 1917 to MI7b, the War Office intelligence section dealing with propaganda, and had responsibility for air-dropped leaflets and newspapers, for which he was made OBE (military) in January 1919. At the end of the war he was briefly employed at the Ministry of Labour before moving to the Irish Office as the London representative of the anti-republican propaganda campaign organized by Basil Clarke, the director of public information in Dublin. Demobilised in March 1919, he relinquished his special reserve commission in November 1920.<br>
<br>During his periods of convalescence from service on the western front, using the pseudonym F.O.O. (forward observation officer), Street wrote two books on the Royal Artillery, both of which were well received. <span class="italic">With the Guns</span> (1916), covering the battle of Loos, was described by <span class="italic">The Times</span> as &#145;a remarkable contribution to the literature of the war&#146; while the <span class="italic">Pall Mall Gazette</span> considered it &#145;one of the best war books that have appeared&#146;. <span class="italic">The Making of a Gunner</span>, which appeared later in 1916, included a severe indictment of the &#145;priesthood&#146; of older officers of the Royal Garrison Artillery who &#145;utterly discouraged any attempt on their part to experiment with guns on wheels &hellip; the Coast Defences lost all sight of what would be their true role in time of war and lapsed into a condition of torpid complacency.&#146; Such views perhaps explain his resignation of his commission a decade earlier.<br>
<br>Street's first foray into fiction was his 1917 semi-autobiographical novel <span class="italic">The Worldly Hope</span>, again by F.O.O. It was the story of a lieutenant of the Royal Garrison Artillery (special reserve) who arrived in France six weeks before the battle of Loos as senior subaltern to a siege battery. On leaving the army Street continued writing by specializing in strategic and current affairs. In 1921, now writing as I.O. (intelligence officer), he published <span class="italic">The Administration of Ireland, 1920</span> and a year later, under his own name, he published <span class="italic">Ireland in 1921</span>. As I.O. he also published <span class="italic">G.Q.G.&#151;French Headquarters, 1915&#150;1918</span>, a translation from the French of a work by Jean de Pierrefeu. Travelling widely in central Europe, he published under his own name <span class="italic">Hungary and Democracy</span> (1923), <span class="italic">East of Prague</span> (1924), <span class="italic">Slovakia Past and Present</span> (1928), and a biography of Thomas Masaryk (1930). He criticized French behaviour following the peace treaties in <span class="italic">The Treachery of France</span> (1924). A biography of Rufus Isaacs, <span class="italic">Lord Reading</span>, appeared under Street's own name in 1928.<br>
<br>In 1925 Street published his first detective story, <span class="italic">The Paddington Mystery</span>, using the pseudonym John Rhode, and in that identity he quickly became one of the leading authors in the golden age of English detective fiction. By 1928 he was also writing other detective and mystery stories using the pseudonym Miles Burton. Thereafter his output was prodigious: in the thirty years from 1930 he published a new detective novel every three months. John Rhode's private detective was the scientist Dr Priestley who advised and assisted Inspector, later Superintendent, Jimmy Waghorn of Scotland Yard, while Miles Burton's detective was Inspector Arnold, who was ably assisted by the inspired amateur sleuth Desmond Merrion. Street's popularity with readers who wanted a challenging plot or mystery continued long after his death although leading critics, particularly H. R. F. Keating, considered his books &#145;dull&#146;, with both &#145;ingenuity of plot and cardboardity of character&#146;  (Keating, <span class="italic">Bedside Companion to Crime</span>, 223).<br>
<br>In the early 1930s Street was, with Dorothy L. Sayers, Agatha Christie, Freeman Wills Crofts, and others, an active member of the select Detection Club whose members funded their Gerrard Street premises and their ceremonial club dinners by publishing books with chapters written serially by different members. As John Rhode, Street contributed to their compilations <span class="italic">The Floating Admiral</span> (1931) and <span class="italic">Ask a Policeman</span> (1933). He contributed a study of the 1860 Constance Kent case to the Detection Club's true crime collection <span class="italic">The Anatomy of Murder</span> (1936), having, in 1928, written up the Kent case in the <span class="roman">Famous Trials</span> series. In all, from 1925 to 1960 nearly eighty books appeared under the name of John Rhode and another sixty-five under that of Miles Burton. As John Rhode he also edited collections of detective short stories.<br>
<br>John Street was a generous but intensely private person who seldom spoke of his past, even to friends. In spite of his popular literary success he shunned publicity and, in his final years, became somewhat reclusive. Although internationally known as the author of the John Rhode books, his authorship of those by Miles Burton was not common knowledge in his lifetime, while his use of the pseudonym Cecil Waye was unknown for many years. He lived in Somerset, Norfolk, and then Suffolk, often locating his stories in those areas and frequently using local place names for his supporting characters. During the Second World War he lived in Hawkhurst, Kent, and served as a lieutenant in the Home Guard between 1940 and 1942, an experience he drew upon in his crime novel <span class="italic">Night Exercise</span> (1942). His first wife, Hyacinth, died in 1949 and later that year on 9 November, aged sixty-five, he married Eileen Annette Waller (1894/5&#150;1967), the daughter of John Waller, a civil engineer. There were no children of either marriage. In the 1950s Street and his new wife moved to Seaford on the Sussex coast to live near Eileen's relatives. Street himself died of arterial thrombosis on 8 December 1964 at the Leaf Hospital, Eastbourne, and, in accordance with his wishes, was cremated.<br>
