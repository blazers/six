<span class="headword">Price,  Cedric John</span>  (1934&#150;2003), <span class="occ">architect</span>, was born at The Croft, Walton, Stone, Staffordshire, on 11 September 1934, the elder son of Arthur John Price (<i>d</i>. 1953), cinema architect, and his wife, Doreen Catherine, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Emery, whose father's firm provided dyes for the pottery industry. At the time of his birth his parents lived at Ash Green, Trentham, Stoke-on-Trent. He went to Alleyne's School, Stone, studied architecture at St John's College, Cambridge, from 1952 to 1955, where he was president of the Cambridge University Society of the Arts (1954&#150;5), and completed his training at the Architectural Association in London from 1955 to 1957 under John Killick and Arthur Korn. He was employed initially in the offices of two of the most eminent British modernist practices: those of Maxwell Fry and Jane Drew (Fry, Drew &amp; Partners), and Erno Goldfinger, where he worked on the seminal exhibition &#145;This Is Tomorrow&#146;. He also taught part-time at the Architectural Association between 1958 and 1964.<br>
<br>In 1960, at the age of twenty-six, Price set up Cedric Price Architects. An early collaboration was with the inventor Buckminster Fuller on an adaptation of his geodesic dome, which solved the intrinsic access problem by raising the whole structure for the audience to get in and out. Meanwhile Price's ideas for his most famous projects were already under way. The Snowdon Aviary at London Zoo, the Fun Palace, and later the Potteries Thinkbelt all offered an entirely unusual&#151;indeed revolutionary&#151;view of what architecture should be. He eschewed, as far as possible, the architect's normal, definitive control of what a building might look like, and instead worked expansively on what architecture might do: what amenities it might provide and how those might be taken control of by the user.<br>
<br>The Fun Palace (1961&#150;4) was a collaboration with Price's friend the theatre director Joan Littlewood, who sought a truly flexible community facility and questioned what role architecture would play in it. Price, the &#145;anti-architect&#146; (as he described himself on his letterhead), devised a huge, serviced, mobile framework of towers, gantries, and lifting components to support roofs, equipment, and enclosure, and to be used by audience and performers alike. Climate control, not dependent on rooms, included warm and cool air &#145;curtains&#146;. The whole project was like a vast backstage, to be constantly remade for an unimaginable range of activities. Price's friend the critic Peter Reyner Banham commented, &#145;It will probably look like nothing on earth from the outside&#146;  (<span class="italic">New Statesman</span>, 7 Aug 1964). Plans to build the Fun Palace in London's East End were scuppered by politics, but it remains the seminal project of flexible (Price would more precisely say indeterminate) architecture. Apocryphally more than accurately, it has often been quoted as the source for the 1971&#150;7 Pompidou Centre, by Richard Rogers and Renzo Piano (though the Pompidou's industrial structures, moving components, and sense of institutional challenge are certainly related). Price's projects deliberately pursued &#145;doubt, delight and change&#146; (the title of an exhibition of his work at the Design Museum), and structures quoted as influenced by him are often those where architectural ingenuity and profound public enjoyment meet. The London Eye is another example: Price first proposed what one startled journalist described as &#145;a great wheel-like structure of observation cars&#146; on the South Bank in 1984  (<span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span>, 15 Aug 2003).<br>
<br>Price treated time as a critical design factor. His &#145;anticipatory architecture&#146; actively promoted change. Deliberately&#151;almost uniquely&#151;he resisted architecture's normal tendency to act as a process of ossification, limiting the behaviour of users to outdated ideas. He argued that architects should plan for their buildings' demolition, and was himself a member of the National Federation of Demolition Contractors. Asked on radio in 1974 what he would do about the structurally endangered York Minster, he replied &#145;Flatten it&#146;. He was delighted when his own Inter-Action, a Portakabin-plus-community facility in Kentish Town, was demolished in 2003.<br>
<br>The Potteries Thinkbelt (1964), designed to anticipate decades of change, linked the Potteries' industrial decline with the expansion of tertiary education, and proposed a vast and detailed project combining transport, education, housing, and infrastructure. Trains running along the old rails would provide educational facilities for all, with &#145;transfer areas&#146; into national networks. Housing (with the deliberately provocative names of Crate, Capsule, Sprawl, and Battery) was designed to suit people of all ages and terrible ground conditions. By the end of the century, when it should have been working, Price's Potteries Thinkbelt would be understood as a major urban regeneration plan for integrated, post-industrial, brownfield development: concepts which were decades away from recognition in 1960s Britain.<br>
<br>Price's most famous built project was, perversely, rarely accredited to him. The Snowdon Aviary at London Zoo (1961) popularly credits Lord Snowdon as the designer. In fact, Snowdon was more client/consultant; the design was by Price and the engineer Frank Newby. This was the first major tensegrity structure in the UK, its four &#145;floating&#146; aluminium tetrahedra held up by a cats' cradle of cables, with just four compression members on the ground. Price negotiated a change of site, opening up the zoo across the public canal and towpath, while simultaneously helping to drain Primrose Hill Park. Typically of Price, the enjoyment and technical cunning are more visible than any overt &#145;architecture&#146;.<br>
<br>Over a career lasting more than forty years, Price produced an extraordinary number of influential projects. &#145;Non-Plan&#146; (1969), with Paul Barker and Peter Hall, proposed zones of planning deregulation (ironically becoming a left-wing progenitor of the Thatcher government's enterprise zones). A workplace protocol study for the building firm of Alfred McAlpine included redesigning donkey jackets and giving workers a good breakfast, after discovering a peak in accidents during early mornings. <span class="roman">The Generator</span> (1976), with the cybernetician Gordon Pask and John Frazer, was the first &#145;intelligent building&#146; proposal, in which the building could be altered by a central computer to suit the current needs of the user, and which included a boredom factor to prevent stasis, by reorganizing itself. There were detailed masterplanning projects for the British Airports Authority at Heathrow and for British Rail at Stratford, where Price advised on the Channel Tunnel and station siting. There were follies, paper cups, bridges, major housing studies, and many others. Price also wrote and published prolifically, usually in magazines and journals (he thought books too slow), including regular columns in the much-read trade papers <span class="italic">Building Design</span> and the <span class="italic">Architects' Journal</span>. Highly condensed, usually short, and casting a wide net from his astonishing research range, they called on the reader to think, and frequently proved predictive.<br>
<br>Price's practice fluctuated in size but continued its challenging activities unabated until his death. One of his biggest late proposals was Magnet (1996), a series of temporary, mobile structures to be assembled out of standard hired building site components such as scaffolding, staircases, and lifts, providing temporary amenities and making use of spaces normally considered unusable. His ten prototypes included a bridge held on cranes in the trees overlooking Regent's Park Zoo, affording a free glimpse of animals, a treetop walk, and safe road crossing; and a rolling &#145;town square&#146; over the North Circular Road reconnecting communities severed by traffic.<br>
<br>Price's enormously influential contribution to the world of ideas rarely translated into buildings. He consistently argued that architects should recognize when architecture was not appropriate, and famously suggested that this might involve telling clients they needed a divorce, not a building. This has been misinterpreted as a disinclination to build. Price was not a &#145;theoretical&#146; architect; his were real proposals and he wanted them built. But he resisted the desire to build for its own sake, when that compromised the real purpose of the project. His &#145;anti-aesthetic&#146;, as it was often described, was a deliberate abjuration of the usual architectural preoccupation with form and style, rather than evidence that he didn't care what things looked like. He saw things, and taught others to see things, in ways which encompassed activity and possibility. The precision and charm of his casual-looking, cartoon-like sketches have been much discussed. Similarly, his advocacy of demolition and time-spans has been seen as a disregard for context, whereas his encyclopaedic knowledge and love of architectural and social history and context informed his work in myriad ways.<br>
<br>Price enjoyed his own contradictions: a technological innovator who kept the same photocopier for decades and disliked mobile phones, a gourmand with no noticeable income, a left-winger clad in striped shirt and stiff collar, a promoter of architectural change whose delightful Alfred Place office in central London was fundamental to his work. He often immured himself in the white room, &#145;East Grinstead&#146;, at the top of Alfred Place (callers were told &#145;Sorry, he's in East Grinstead&#146;). But this was also the venue for parties and meetings, where selected visitors were bidden to early, sometimes brandy-fuelled, breakfasts. A polymath, he founded Polyark, the architecture schools' network, an annual cricket match (with his brother, David), and his own elusive Hot Stuff Club. His extraordinary network of friends and collaborators followed no known social or political grouping. He was a committed socialist, whose party guests might include trade unionists and his friend the prominent Conservative Lord McAlpine, his long-term partner, the actor Eleanor Bron, his friend Joan Littlewood, the architect&#150;philosopher Roy Landau, and the architectural editor Paul Finch, alongside scruffy journalists and assorted others of all ages. He was an extraordinary physical and intellectual presence: generous, demanding, and challenging. Conversations with him involved hard imaginative work. He was incomparably stimulating, a larger-than-life man who changed people's way of seeing. He died of heart disease at University College Hospital, London, on 10 August 2003 and was cremated at Kensal Green cemetery on 18 August, a metronome ticking on the coffin along with his favourite brandy, cigars, notebooks, pens, and pencils. He was survived by his partner, Eleanor Bron.<br>
