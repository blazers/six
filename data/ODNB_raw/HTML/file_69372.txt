<span class="headword">Yorke,  Roger</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1536), <span class="occ">law reporter</span>, was probably a son of the Exeter merchant Walter Yorke (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1505) and his wife, Waltera. In a chancery petition which refers to his brother Walter, also a merchant, having become a prisoner of war, he is described as &#145;Roger Yorke of Excestre, student of Grayes Inne in Holborn&#146;  (TNA: PRO, C 1/561/23). This dates from after 1517, but &#145;student&#146; here is a flexible term analogous to &#145;apprentice&#146; of the law. Yorke was probably admitted to Gray's Inn soon after 1506, being Edward Montague's junior when he became a serjeant, and by 1516 he had been called to the bar long enough to become an ancient. In 1522 he was elected autumn reader, but the exercise was postponed to Lent 1523. Already he seems to have become an established practitioner, for he was assessed for the poll tax that year as having &pound;66 a year. His name is found on over forty bills in chancery in the time of Cardinal Wolsey. Although he had a small property in St Paul's parish, Exeter, in 1522, he settled at Wellington in Somerset, probably soon after marrying Eleanor, daughter of Sir Hugh Luttrell of Dunster in that county, his stepmother's second husband, about 1520. His second wife was Margaret Erneley. From 1524 he was named in the commissions of the peace for both Devon and Somerset, and from 1531 for Wiltshire as well.<br>
<br>In 1531, as serjeant-elect, Yorke delivered a second reading in Gray's Inn on <i>Prerogativa regis</i>, notes from which survive. When he was created serjeant in November 1531 he was the most junior of the call, and he was still quite young when he died on 2 February 1536. His son and heir, Thomas, was then aged fifteen. Yorke's principal legacy to posterity was his series of law reports, which survive in four manuscript versions but were unidentified until the 1970s. The reports (which were printed by the Selden Society in 2003) were mostly written in the 1520s and 1530s, though one or two can be dated to the first decade of Henry VIII's reign. The cases are arranged under non-alphabetical headings, and are interspersed with notes from learning exercises in Gray's Inn, including one of John Spelman's readings, several notes from the western circuit (at Exeter, Salisbury, and Yeovilchester), and, after 1531, some memoranda of discussions in Serjeants' Inn.<br>
