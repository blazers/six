<span class="headword">Oswald,  John</span>  (<em>c.</em>1760&#150;1793), <span class="occ">journalist and poet</span>, was born in Edinburgh, where his father, also John Oswald, a goldsmith of &#145;great learning&#146;, kept John's Coffee House. Nothing is known of his mother. John learned Latin and Greek as a youth, and later studied Arabic, French, Italian, Spanish, and Portuguese. He was a goldsmith's apprentice, but joined the Royal Irish regiment in 1776 or 1777, serving from early 1781 as a lieutenant in India. Before embarking, he married his first wife, Louisa, in Deal. They had two sons. On the way to India, he duelled with Colonel Norman Macleod. Oswald was in Madras in the winter of 1782&#150;3, but left India in 1783, returning by land to the Deal&#150;Dover area. His wife having died, he married Bathesheba Fagge Owen (<i>bap</i>. 1759), a widow, on 1 June 1784 in Folkestone. They had one daughter, Jane, and an infant son.<br>
<br>Oswald worked in Grub Street, London, on the <span class="italic">Political Herald and Review</span> (1785&#150;6), and published with James Ridgway the <span class="italic">British Mercury</span> (1787), with prints by Gillray and Rowlandson. He reported parliamentary debates for the <span class="italic">London Gazetteer</span> (1789&#150;91), lectured and debated in London (Society of Free Debate at Coachmakers Hall, 1790), wrote poetry (<span class="italic">Euphrosyne: an Ode to Beauty</span>, 1788, under the pseudonym Sylvester Otway), love poems for <span class="italic">The World</span> (1790), and political pamphlets: <span class="italic">Review of the Constitution of Great Britain</span> (1784), <span class="italic">Ranae comicae evangelizantes</span> (1786), <span class="italic">The Alarming Progress of French Politics</span> (1787), and <span class="italic">The Cry of Nature</span> (1791). By now a friend of Tom Paine, John Horne Tooke, David Williams, James Mackintosh, and John and William Stone, Oswald was known as a revolutionary activist in England and France. His reputation may be sensed by his <span class="italic">Constitution for the Universal Commonwealth</span> (1793), which was recommended to Burke, with the works of Paine, Siey&egrave;s, Barlow, and Mirabeau, in 1792.<br>
<br>By May 1790 Oswald was resident in Paris. He watched the debates in the national assembly, where he presented an &#145;Ode to the Triumph of Freedom&#146; on 4 September 1790. He met Thomas Cooper, Joel Barlow, Thomas Christie, Wolfe Tone, Lord Edward Fitzgerald, Brissot, Danton, Desmoulins, the Rolands, Th&eacute;roigne de M&eacute;ricourt, and Henry Redhead Yorke, with whom he argued between 1792 and 1793. Oswald collaborated with Bonneville as editor of a monthly journal, <span class="italic">Chronique du Mois</span> (1791&#150;3), of the Circle Social (founded in Paris in January 1790), which included Brissot, Condorcet, and Lanthenas among its authors. James Ridgway was its London bookseller (1791). Oswald also worked as secretary and reporter for a few months on the <span class="italic">Universal Patriot</span> (edition of 3 May 1790), the English newspaper printed in Paris, London, and Calais, hoping to cover debates on both sides of the channel. Late in 1792 the British Club was formed by some British men and women who met in White's Hotel in Paris to celebrate successes of the French army and national assembly. Oswald officiated as secretary. He spoke in the Jacobin Club (22 August 1792, 30 September 1792, 4 February 1793), wrote its <span class="italic">La tactique du peuple</span> (<i>c</i>.1792), and worked as its publisher and collaborating editor. He translated its <span class="italic">Almanach des P&egrave;re G&eacute;rard</span> by Collot d'Herbois as <span class="italic">The Spirit of the French Constitution: the Almanach of Goodman G&eacute;rard</span> with a subsidy from the London Corresponding Society. He was named an honorary French citizen on 25 September 1792 and commander in the French revolutionary army. As commandant of the Parisian pikemen Oswald left Paris on 26 March 1793 with his battalion to fight and die at Thouars in the battle of La Vend&eacute;e on 14 September 1793. His two sons (aged fourteen and seventeen) served as drummer boys, and were wounded but not killed in this same battle.<br>
<br>Oswald, a vegetarian and atheist, used the pseudonyms Ignotus (in the <span class="italic">Political Herald</span>, 1785&#150;7), Sylvester Otway (London newspapers 1788&#150;9), and H. K. He was of &#145;middle height &hellip; noble carriage, [had a] heroic and grave face, sober manners and [was] a bit stiff&#146;  (Lichtenberger, 483).<br>
