</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Bader, Sir  Douglas Robert Steuart</span>  (1910&#150;1982), <span class="occ">air force officer</span>, was born at St John's Wood, London, on 21 February 1910, the younger child and younger son of Frederick Roberts Bader, a civil engineer working in India, and his wife, Jessie McKenzie. He was educated at St Edward's School, Oxford, where he was a scholar, and at the Royal Air Force College, Cranwell, where he was a prize cadet. He finished second in the contest for the sword of honour at Cranwell, and his confidential report described him as &#145;plucky, capable, headstrong&#146;.<br>
<br>Bader was commissioned in August 1930 and was then posted as a pilot officer to 23 fighter squadron at the RAF station at Kenley. He was an exceptional pilot and was selected, with another officer from the squadron, to fly the pair for the RAF at the Hendon air display in 1931 before a crowd of 175,000. As a young officer, he was good looking and charming. He was also determined and dogmatic, and could be thoroughly &#145;difficult&#146;. He was, however, a natural leader, fearless and always eager for a challenge. While he could be brusque and impatient, he was socially at ease in any company. He was intensely loyal to the causes he cared about and to his friends.<br>
<br>Bader was twenty-one when on 14 December 1931 he crashed on Woodley airfield, near Reading. Both legs had to be amputated in the Royal Berkshire Hospital, where his life was saved. He was later transferred to the RAF Hospital at Uxbridge. Six months after his operations he was walking unaided on his artificial legs. &#145;I will never use a stick&#146;, he said.<br>
<br>He was discharged from the RAF in the spring of 1933. That summer he became a clerk in the Asiatic Petroleum Company (later Shell Petroleum) in the City, and on 5 October 1933, discreetly at Hampstead register office, he married Olive Thelma Exley, the daughter of Lieutenant-Colonel Ivo Arthyr Exley Edwards RAF (retired), and Olive Maud Amy Addison, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Donaldson. Four years later, on 5 October 1937, there was a religious ceremony at St Mary Abbots church, Kensington. There were no children of the marriage.<br>
<br>Bader was re-engaged by the RAF in November 1939, two months after the outbreak of the Second World War, and on 7 February 1940 he was posted to 19 fighter squadron at Duxford, near Cambridge, as a flying officer. Within six weeks he was appointed to command A flight in 222 squadron. As a flight lieutenant, he saw action with the squadron at Dunkirk. Promotion continued, and on 24 June 1940 he was posted to command 242 (Canadian) squadron at Coltishall, in Norfolk. He led the nearby Duxford wing with this unit with signal success throughout the battle of Britain; he was appointed to the DSO on 13 September and awarded the DFC a month later.<br>
<br>Bader's advocacy of his much misunderstood &#145;big wing&#146; tactics served to fuel the controversy which existed between the air officers commanding nos. 11 and 12 groups of Fighter Command&#151;Keith Park and Trafford Leigh-Mallory&#151;and between the commander-in-chief, Sir Hugh Dowding, and the deputy chief of the air staff, Sholto Douglas. The controversy was further inflamed by Leigh-Mallory's decision to ask Bader to accompany him to the high-level tactical conference held at the Air Ministry on 17 October 1940 with Douglas in the chair. In March 1941 Bader became the first wing commander flying at Tangmere, in Sussex, and led his three Spitfire squadrons with notable success in the frequent offensive operations over northern France. His aggressive leadership was recognized with the award of a bar both to the DSO and the DFC. The French Croix de Guerre and the L&eacute;gion d'honneur followed. There were three mentions in dispatches. With his official score of twenty-three enemy aircraft destroyed, Bader was shot down on 9 August 1941 near St Omer in the Pas-de-Calais and was a prisoner of war until he was released from Colditz in April 1945. He made repeated attempts to escape, refusing repatriation on the grounds that he expected to return to combat.<br>
<br>After the armistice the &#145;legless ace&#146; was promoted to group captain and posted to command the North Weald sector in Essex. From here he led the victory fly-past over London on 15 September 1945. He retired from the RAF six months later and in July 1946 rejoined the Shell Company; eventually he was managing director of Shell Aircraft Ltd (1958&#150;69). He flew himself to many parts of the world, often taking his wife with him. An outstanding games player before his accident, he played golf on his tin legs to a handicap of four.<br>
<br>Paul Brickhill's biography of Bader, <span class="italic">Reach for the Sky</span> (1954), was followed by the film bearing the same title with Kenneth More playing Bader (1956). This brought the battle of Britain pilot worldwide fame. Notwithstanding this, his unsung work for the disabled continued apace, and in 1956 he was appointed CBE.<br>
<br>Bader, who lived mainly in London, retired from Shell in 1969 and from 1972 to 1978 was a member of the Civil Aviation Authority. He accepted several non-executive directorships, maintained his long-established connections with Fleet Street, and continued with his numerous public speaking engagements. Latterly, his principal business base was as a consultant to Aircraft Equipment International at Ascot.<br>
<br>Bader's wife died in London on 24 January 1971 after a long illness. Two years later, on 3 January 1973, he married Mrs Joan Eileen Murray, the daughter of Horace Hipkiss, a steel mill owner. In the same year was published <span class="italic">Fight for the Sky</span>, Bader's story of the Hurricane and the Spitfire. Having been knighted in 1976 for service to the public and the disabled, he died in London on 4 September 1982, while being driven home through Chiswick after speaking at a dinner in Guildhall. He was FRAeS (1976), an honorary DSc of Queen's University, Belfast (1976), and deputy lieutenant of Greater London (1977).<br>
