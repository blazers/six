<span class="headword">Butler,  John</span>  (1728&#150;1796), <span class="occ">army officer in America</span>, was born in Connecticut. Little is certain of his early life except that he married Catherine Bratt, with whom he had at least one son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/53615/', "Walter Butler (1752&#150;1781)")</script>. By the eve of the American War of Independence, he had long established himself as a prominent landholder, merchant, and liaison with Native Americans in the Mohawk valley, New York. In the climate of rising tensions between Britain and its North American colonies, he also established himself as a leading loyalist in a divided region.<br>
<br>When war erupted in 1775, most of Butler's family was held in Albany, while he and his son, Walter, managed to flee to Montreal. A region that was crucial to both sides in the war was the area between Albany and Canada; the Mohawk valley was a significant part of this, because it offered the American patriots the most feasible route into Canada and the British a passage through which to strike at the centre of the rebellious colonies. Any success in the region could be won, however, only with the assistance of the power of the Iroquois confederacy and its tributaries. Britain's department of Indian affairs, however, had been thrown into disarray the previous year with the death of its northern superintendent, Sir William Johnson, who for two decades dominated the scene and placed the affection of the Iroquois above all else. Matters were worsened with the departure of Johnson's heirs and closest allies for England, where they would secure his former position and wealth as a benefit to be passed down to the next Johnson generation. In their absence the Iroquois confederacy, along with the vast majority of Native Americans in the region, declared their neutrality. Butler was given the unhappy position of acting superintendent of Indian affairs by Quebec's military governor, General Guy Carleton, and assigned the difficult task of persuading the Iroquois to fight with the British until Johnson's replacement arrived in July 1776.<br>
<br>Butler's competence, either as a diplomatist or as a military commander, is unclear. He certainly had the confidence of Carleton, but Johnson's heirs, which included Sir William's official replacement and probable nephew, Guy Johnson, and Joseph Brant, Sir William's brother-in-law and a prominent leader of the Mohawk (a component of the Iroquois confederacy), clearly had a low opinion of him. Operating primarily out of Niagara, Butler certainly abused his position, allowing merchants such as Edward Pollard to exercise lucrative monopolies over the distribution of supplies to Native Americans, but such activities were par for the course. His tactics of recruiting the wary Iroquois were equally unsavoury. His primary device was said to have been rum, which he distributed freely before signing up young braves, and in diplomatic encounters he mixed lies about American patriot intentions to annihilate the natives with threats of British military might. On one such occasion, in May 1776, he concluded:<blockquote>You had better recall your resolutions and determine to keep the Kings peace, and the King will then be glad to hear from you. What a wretched situation must you be in when the King attacks all the seaports in America and comes in earnest to sweep off the Americans, if he finds you supporting the Americans. (Graymont, 96)</blockquote>It should be noted, however, that such tactics were not unique to either the British or the whites.After the return of Sir William's heirs, who were far more familiar and trusted by the Iroquois leaders (and in fact included a number of them), recruiting drives met with much greater success. The jealous Butler continued his efforts to rally the Iroquois to the British cause, but his intoxicated and ill-equipped recruits were more of an annoyance to Brant and the Johnsons than a help. Nevertheless, in the following year Butler was assigned the charge of raising a new corps of loyalists, aptly called Butler's rangers, who were to be used as special forces units on the New York frontier. They were expected to be highly mobile guerrilla fighters who spoke Native American languages and used native methods of wilderness warfare. Such skills were essential, as these men were expected to fight side by side with Native Americans. They took the scalps of the enemy dead and wounded, tortured captives, and even used the chilling war whoop of native warriors as their battle cry. As leader of this force Butler rose to the rank of lieutenant-colonel.<br>
<br>Butler's rangers were used in the brutal engagements that were the hallmark of the New York frontier campaigns fought by divided communities and families that were intent on dealing out the most brutal punishments for perceived disloyalty. Nor was this a white affair, as the Iroquois confederacy itself was drawn indecisively into the conflict and consequently torn apart, and its warriors found themselves defending their homes against former relatives and allies. The rangers were at virtually all of the major engagements in the region, among them the infamous attack on Cherry valley, commanded by Walter Butler, in November 1777, in which thirty-two civilians, mostly women and children, were massacred. Butler himself commanded the assault on Wyoming valley, Pennsylvania, in the following summer; there his rangers and native allies, primarily Seneca and Mohawk warriors of the now broken Iroquois confederacy, boasted taking 227 scalps. Despite capitulation terms to the contrary, Butler's victorious forces plundered the area's settlements, which included upwards of a thousand abodes, a greater number of cattle, and all of the mills. Recounting the events after withdrawing to Niagara, as was the case each autumn after a spring and summer of raids, Butler proudly remarked to Carleton:<blockquote>But what gives me the sincerest satisfaction is that I can with great truth assure you that in the destruction of this settlement not a single person has been hurt of the Inhabitants, but such as were in arms, to those indeed the Indians gave no Quarter. (Graymont, 172)</blockquote>At the conclusion of the war Butler and his rangers were justly wary of returning home to the frontier communities they had pillaged, and so most of them accepted royal land grants in the Niagara peninsula once the corps was disbanded in June 1784. Butler retained his leadership role, serving as the district judge and deputy superintendent of Indian affairs. He died there in 1796.<br>
