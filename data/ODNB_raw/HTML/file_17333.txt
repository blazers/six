<span class="headword">Macarthur, Sir  Edward</span>  (1789&#150;1872), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was born on 16 March 1789 at the White Hart inn, Bath, the first of the nine children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17337/', "Captain John Macarthur (1766&#150;1834)")</script> and his wife, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/52548/', "Elizabeth Macarthur (1766&#150;1850)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17337/', "Macarthur, John")</script>], the daughter of Richard Veale, a landowner, of Lodgeworthy, Devon. He was the brother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17335/', "James Macarthur")</script>, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17339/', "William Macarthur")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17335/', "Macarthur, James")</script>], and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17336/', "John Macarthur")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17337/', "Macarthur, John")</script>]. The family emigrated to New South Wales on the Second Fleet in 1790, and John and Elizabeth became noted sheep-farming pioneers in the new colony. Edward spent his childhood at the family's Elizabeth Farm in Parramatta, Sydney, before being sent in 1799 to England for his education. He attended Dr James Lindsay's school, Grove Hall, Bow, London, and returned to Australia in 1806.<br>
<br>Finding some of the jobs around the family estate &#145;distasteful&#146;  (King, &#145;Sir Edward Macarthur&#146;, 315), Macarthur decided to pursue his interest in a military career, and in 1808 he returned to England; in December of that year he joined the 60th regiment and he saw service at Corunna and Sicily before receiving promotion to the rank of lieutenant in the 39th regiment. He fought in a number of campaigns of the Napoleonic wars and in the Anglo-American War of 1812&#150;14, and served with occupation forces in France and Ireland in the following years. In 1821 he purchased a captain's commission in the 19th regiment, and in 1824 he returned to Australia on leave. He sought appointment to an official position in the colony, but was unsuccessful. He achieved the rank of major in 1826.<br>
<br>In 1830 Macarthur was appointed to the post of secretary to the lord chamberlain, in which role he continued until 1837, after which he became assistant adjutant-general in Ireland. He achieved promotion to lieutenant-colonel, and in 1851 was made deputy adjutant-general in the Australian military command, based in Sydney.<br>
<br>In 1854 Macarthur was promoted colonel and the command headquarters moved to Melbourne. The following year he succeeded to the post of commander-in-chief of the forces. On the death of the governor of Victoria in December that year Macarthur, as senior military officer in the colony, assumed the post of acting governor until a successor was appointed twelve months later. Macarthur saw it as a central part of his role to maintain stability in the colony, and the popularity of the crown, by exhibiting &#145;cheerfulness, hospitality and truthfulness toward all with whom &hellip; I can have relations&#146;  (King, &#145;Sir Edward Macarthur&#146;, 324). In this he was very successful. One resident warmly praised him as &#145;an industrious, kind-hearted, Christian gentleman&#146;  (Hill).<br>
<br>Macarthur resumed his role as commander of the military forces, a post he held until his retirement in 1860. He then returned to England, and on 18 November 1862 he married Sarah (<i>d</i>. 1889), the third daughter of Lieutenant-Colonel W. Smith Neill, of Ayrshire. They had no children. In that year Macarthur was also made a KCB, and in 1866 he was promoted lieutenant-general. He died at his London home&#151;27 Princes Gardens, Kensington&#151;on 4 January 1872 and was buried at Brompton cemetery.<br>
