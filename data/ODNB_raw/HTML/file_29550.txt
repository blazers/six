<span class="headword">Williams,  Thomas</span> <span class="st"> [<em>name in religion </em>Dominic]</span>  (1668&#150;1740), <span class="occ">vicar apostolic of the northern district</span>, was from a Welsh Catholic family who owned the former Benedictine priory of Monmouth. Nothing else is known of him until on 30 October 1685 he entered the English Dominican priory in Bornhem, near Antwerp, in the Low Countries. He made his novitiate in the Dominican priory of Ghent and was professed at Bornhem on 5 December 1686, taking the name of Dominic.<br>
<br>On 9 March 1688 Williams was sent to study at the English Dominican house of Saints John and Paul on the Coelian Hill in Rome. This house had been founded by Cardinal Philip Thomas Howard on a gift from Pope Clement X as a study house for young English friars. From Rome Williams was sent to Naples to complete his studies and was ordained in 1692, taking his lectorate in theology. He returned to Saints John and Paul on 26 November 1695. In that same year the English Dominican authorities closed the Roman priory. Williams was prominent in the party of younger friars who wished to withdraw from Rome. A new college of St Thomas Aquinas was then founded at Louvain in the Low Countries with the revenues bequeathed by Cardinal Howard.<br>
<br>Williams became a professor at Louvain on 15 September 1696, and then in 1701 regent of the college. In 1706 he was created master in sacred theology, returning home in the following year to transfer the family estates, to which he was heir, to his younger brother. He was once more appointed regent in the college at Louvain in 1711, and from 1708 to 1712 was vicar provincial in the Low Countries, holding jurisdiction over the English Dominican establishments at Bornhem and Louvain, and the English Dominican nuns at Brussels. On 28 February 1712 he was elected provincial, resuming his teaching responsibilities at Louvain when his term expired. He was elected to represent the English province as diffinitor in the general chapter in Rome in May of 1721. In 1724 Williams was elected prior of Bornhem and once more acted as diffinitor at the general chapter of Bologna in May 1725. On 25 July of the same year he was again named provincial, but on 30 December 1725 was ordained a bishop by the Dominican pope Benedict XIII. He was named to the see of Tiberiopolis, under the archbishop of Hieropolis, in Phrygia Magna, <i>in partibus infidelium</i>.<br>
<br>Williams's appointment as vicar apostolic of the northern district of England on 6 June 1726 was, however, greeted with dismay by the secular clergy of the region. Bishop Williams landed in his new charge in December 1727 and endured great poverty and hardship in the first years of his episcopate before settling with the Gascoignes at Huddlestone Hall, near Pontefract. He was zealous in visiting his district, and died at Huddlestone on 3 April 1740. He was buried the following day in the Catholic chapel in neighbouring Hazlewood.<br>
