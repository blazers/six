<span class="headword">Beaumont,  John</span>, first Viscount Beaumont  (1409?&#150;1460), <span class="occ">magnate and courtier</span>, was the elder son and heir of Henry, fifth Baron Beaumont of Folkingham, Lincolnshire (1379/80&#150;1413) and Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1427), daughter of William, fifth Baron Willoughby of Eresby. He was one of the most powerful lords in eastern England during the reign of Henry VI, and a firm supporter of the Lancastrian royal family in the troubles of the 1450s.<br>
<br>Four years old at the death of his father, Beaumont became a ward of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/12952/', "Henry V")</script>, who granted custody of the boy and his substantial estates, which were concentrated in Lincolnshire and Leicestershire, to <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1859/', "Henry Beaufort (d. 1447)")</script>, bishop of Winchester. In 1425 Beaumont's marriage was granted to Sir John Radcliffe, and, possibly as early as 1428 (but certainly by July 1436), he wed Elizabeth Phelip, the daughter and sole heir of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/50244/', "William Phelip, Lord Bardolf (1383/4&#150;1441)")</script>, a leading figure in the duchy of Lancaster connection in East Anglia. This was to be a valuable association: Beaumont inherited (in 1441) Bardolf's extensive and conveniently situated holdings in Norfolk, Suffolk, and Lincolnshire, and his close links with William de la Pole, earl of Suffolk (<i>d</i>. 1450), must have helped to secure for him a place in the establishment of the emerging king. Certainly, as the 1430s wore on, the young Beaumont's political standing increased rapidly, and he became one of the most extensively rewarded and important figures in the government. In the summer of 1436 he agreed to accompany the duke of Gloucester on his expedition to protect Calais and (even though this was his first and last involvement in the war in France) he was rewarded with a grant of the county of Boulogne. Two days after Queen Catherine's death on 3 January 1437 he succeeded to the stewardship of the duchy of Lancaster honour of Leicester, which had been part of her dower and which (together with the stewardship of Castle Donington, which he obtained from Henry V's feoffees at the same time) complemented his own holdings in the county superbly. On 12 February 1440 he was made a viscount, the first ever in England, and during the ensuing few years he acquired a life interest in a string of royal lands in Norfolk and Lincolnshire together with the stewardship of the duchy honour of Bolingbroke, Lincolnshire, and (fittingly) a grant of the <i>vicomt&eacute;</i> of Beaumont, Maine. In the same year he succeeded de la Pole as lord great chamberlain, a position he held until his death. In 1441 or 1442, he was elected to the Garter, and on 29 November 1443 he became a feoffee for the royal foundations at Eton and Cambridge. By 12 November 1445 he had been appointed constable of England.<br>
<br>Beyond his links with Bardolf and the presence of a younger brother, Henry, among the king's esquires, it is difficult to know why Beaumont attracted such an extraordinary heap of honours and perquisites from the crown in these years. Clearly he was not being rewarded for military service overseas. Part of the reason for the favour shown to him must be that, although he does not seem himself to have held any official post in the royal household, he had been part of the royal coterie since Henry VI's childhood. He may actually have been living at court in the later 1420s, since an act of the council in 1425 provided that wards of baronial rank should be permanently about the king. On 12 November 1428, when he was still a minor, he was described as being in the king's service and when, in April 1430, Henry crossed to France for his coronation at Paris, Beaumont was among those accompanying him. It is possible that during these years he established some kind of friendship with the king, and, after Henry began to exercise his powers of patronage from the summer of 1436 onwards, simply petitioned for much, if not all, of what he got. It seems likely, however, that his requests for favour would have had to earn the approval of leading figures of the ruling group as well as that of Henry himself. It may be that Beaumont's partly Lancastrian descent (from Eleanor, daughter of Henry, third earl of Lancaster, his paternal great-great-grandmother) was a factor in obtaining this approval: it was sufficiently widely known for Lord Hungerford to bequeath him a cup of John of Gaunt's in his will. But one of the most important factors in his advancement must surely have been his territorial standing, and this appears to have grown alongside the mound of favours acquired at court. When he came of age, in 1430, he entered into the entire Beaumont patrimony, the widows of the last two lords having died in 1427. From 1441 he controlled the lands of his wife's inheritance and, by royal grant made shortly before her death (before 30 October 1441), the wardship of anything his children might inherit from her. By 25 August 1443 he had acquired an even richer prize by marrying, as her third husband, Katherine Strangways (<i>c</i>.1400&#150;1483) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/54432/', "Neville, Katherine")</script>], the dowager duchess of Norfolk. The daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/19951/', "Ralph Neville, first earl of Westmorland")</script>, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/53026/', "Joan Beaufort")</script>, she was the holder of a life interest in the Mowbray estates in Yorkshire, Lincolnshire (Isle of Axholme), Sussex, and the marches of Wales as well as an enormous dowry which included most of the Mowbray manors in Norfolk and Leicestershire. It was this privately held estate in the eastern counties that the grants of royal lands and custodies must have been meant to supplement: the government doubtless intended that the young viscount take his place in the extensive connection of magnates through whom Henry VI's advisers attempted to govern the country.<br>
<br>When the time of reckoning came for Suffolk and his associates in 1450, Beaumont&#151;rather surprisingly&#151;escaped unscathed. He had been involved in some of the regime's most unpopular activities, including the arrest of the duke of Gloucester, the surrender of Maine (for which he was one of only two English lords known to have received the promised compensation), and the maintenance of the notorious William Tailboys (<i>d</i>. 1464). Some local men attacked his manor at Boston, Lincolnshire, in July 1449&#151;no doubt partly in reaction to the extraordinary franchisal powers he had acquired from the king in the previous year&#151;but none the less, to one of the doggerel writers of 1450, he was &#145;that gentill rache [hound]&#146;  (Robbins, 186): vindicated perhaps by his noble status and his role, as constable, in the arrest of Suffolk. Within days of Suffolk's death Beaumont succeeded him as chamberlain of England, and yielded up his office of constable to the earl of Northumberland a few weeks later.<br>
<br>Although he had been quite closely associated with Richard, duke of York, during the 1430s and 1440s, acting as feoffee for the duke on a number of occasions and probably serving on his council, Beaumont was a consistent supporter of king and court during the 1450s. Initially he may have sought to avoid an open breach with York and his supporters. While he was reluctant to participate in the duke's protectorate of 1454, for example, he came to be on reasonable terms with York's regime: he retained his place in the household in the &#145;abridgement&#146; of that year and secured a patent protecting his interests in the Bardolf lands; in 1455 he does not seem to have been in the royal army at the battle of St Albans. Even so, there were early signs that he might prove hostile to the Yorkists: he had taken part in the judicial commissions which harried Duke Richard's men in 1452&#150;3 and he had joined the group opposed to York and the Nevilles in the tense winter of 1453&#150;4. As the 1450s wore on, and the lines of division became sharper, his Lancastrian commitment became more overt. One of the most important factors in this was probably his close association with Queen Margaret. As a major Leicestershire landowner and leading courtier Beaumont was an obvious ally and agent for the queen, whose dower centred on the honours of Leicester, Kenilworth, and Tutbury. He had been the chief steward of her lands from as early as 1446 and, as Margaret assumed the leadership of the Lancastrian cause after the death of Edmund Beaufort in 1455, he was one of her principal lieutenants; he became chief steward of Prince Edward's lands on 20 January 1457 and of the northern parts of the duchy of Lancaster on 6 December 1459. It was Beaumont's prominence in the regime of the late 1450s that provoked the Yorkist lords to identify him as one of their three &#145;mortalle and extreme enemyes&#146;  (<span class="italic">English Chronicle</span>, 88) in 1460 and, allegedly, to secure his excommunication at the hands of the papal legate at about the same time. Together with other leading associates of the queen (notably the duke of Buckingham, whose daughter had married William, Beaumont's eldest surviving son, in 1452), Beaumont was killed in the Yorkist victory at Northampton on 10 July 1460, possibly by the men of Kent. He was not attainted, and in November 1460 his son was allowed to succeed to his lands without suit, but the new government's conciliatory efforts were unavailing. By the time of the battle of Towton, in March 1461, William, second Viscount Beaumont (<i>d</i>. 1507), had followed his father into the Lancastrian camp.<br>
<br>John Beaumont's appearance is unknown and there is little evidence of his character. It is possible that he was a man of somewhat extreme, though conventional, piety, as he is known to have pressed for action to be taken against the controversial Bishop Pecock in 1457. In this display of orthodoxy, as in his detachment from the war in France and his close association with the royal court, he was perhaps a typical member of the later Lancastrian nobility.<br>
