<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Buxton,  Sydney Charles</span>, Earl Buxton  (1853&#150;1934), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born in London on 25 October 1853, the younger son (the three subsequent children of the marriage were daughters) of the liberal politician <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/4244/', "Charles Buxton (1822&#150;1871)")</script> and his wife, Emily Mary (<i>d</i>. 1871), eldest daughter of the physician <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13525/', "Sir Henry Holland")</script>. He was grandson of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/4247/', "Sir Thomas Fowell Buxton")</script>, &#145;liberator of the slaves&#146;. The family background was one of well-to-do Quaker stock in East Anglia, brewers and bankers. Buxton attended Clifton College (1868&#150;70) and went on to Trinity College, Cambridge (1872), but very soon had to abandon his studies there on account of osteomyelitis of a leg. He then travelled for his health in South America (1873) and Egypt (1875). By 1876 he was strong enough to seek and secure election to the London school board, on which he served until 1882. He also worked from 1882 to 1884 very energetically as an honorary secretary to the fund set up by J. H. Tuke to assist emigration from western Ireland. He was already a fluent writer and publicist, mainly on political and fiscal matters, publishing in 1880 a <span class="italic">Handbook to Political Questions of the Day</span>. Written as an exercise in self-education, this influential manual eventually passed through eleven editions. In 1888 it was followed by <span class="italic">Finance and Politics: an Historical Study, 1783&#150;1885</span> (2 vols.), still a work of great value.<br>
<br>Buxton stood unsuccessfully for parliament as a Liberal at Boston (1880), but was elected for Peterborough in 1883. Losing that seat in 1885, he was eventually elected in 1886 for Poplar, which remained his constituency until 1914. Poplar brought him successful involvement in the great dockers' strike of 1889 as an arbitrator sympathetic to the dockers' case, and he won lasting popularity with his (mainly working-class) constituents in the Isle of Dogs. He maintained a very strong interest in industrial conditions, arising from his involvement in east London, and the question of London's government remained another major preoccupation, together with education. He was a very active member of the royal commission on elementary education, 1886&#150;8. In the Commons he was a member of an informal group of progressive radicals which included Asquith, Grey, and Haldane. When the Liberals came to power in 1892 he was appointed under-secretary at the Colonial Office, a post he held until 1895. The secretary of state, Lord Ripon, being in the Lords, Buxton had to answer on colonial matters in the Commons, besides holding special responsibility for southern Africa, a crucial area in view of the situation in the Transvaal and the problems of relations with Rhodes's British South Africa Company. In 1894 he played a role as adviser to Sir William Harcourt in the framing of the innovative <span class="roman">Death Duties Bill</span>. Out of office from 1895 to 1905, he remained a frequent speaker in the Commons, was a member of the commission of inquiry into the Jameson raid, followed a moderately &#145;imperialist&#146; line concerning the South African War, and took account of East End opinion in defying Liberal orthodoxy by supporting&#151;contrary to most of his party&#151;the anti-immigration <span class="roman">Aliens Bill</span> of 1905.<br>
<br>In December 1905 Buxton became postmaster-general, with a seat in the cabinet. His principal achievements in this office included the purchase for &pound;15,000 of coastal wireless stations from Lloyd's and the Marconi Company (1909), penny postage to the USA, and reduced charges for the postage of literature for blind people. He also won notable success in securing better terms of employment in the Post Office and better relations with the staff (he was responsible for official recognition of the Postal Servants' Union). In February 1910 he was appointed to succeed Winston Churchill as president of the Board of Trade. Here he was responsible for much legislation, notably the important unemployment section (introducing compulsory contributory insurance against unemployment in certain trades) of the <span class="roman">National Insurance Act</span> 1911, the <span class="roman">Copyright Act</span> (1911), the <span class="roman">Miners' Minimum Wage Act</span> (1911&#150;12), the <span class="roman">Act Extending Trades Boards to Additional Trades</span> (1913) and the <span class="roman">Bankruptcy Act</span> (1913). After the loss of the <i>Titanic</i> in 1912 he became much involved in regulations concerned with safety at sea.<br>
<br>Early in 1914 he was named governor-general of the Union of South Africa; he resigned his office and left the cabinet and the Commons. He was appointed GCMG and in May raised to the peerage as Viscount Buxton of Newtimber, in Sussex. He reached South Africa on 8 September and opened parliament the next day. The country was deeply divided, the wounds of the South African War of 1899&#150;1902 being by no means healed, and for the first three months of his governor-generalship a party of Boers was in revolt against the government which had declared war on Germany. Buxton's responsibilities were wide, since he was also high commissioner over the protectorates of Basutoland, Bechuanaland, and Swaziland and had a certain (if not clearly delineated) authority in Rhodesia. The South African prime minister was Louis Botha whom he had met in England (1907 and 1911) and the two men greatly liked and esteemed each other. This close friendship was an important factor in the success of Buxton's governor-generalship. He spent much time on the move (frequently by train), getting to know the country and its peoples, making a point of visiting the &#145;nationalist&#146; Boer strongholds, and winning general popularity, as did Lady Buxton. In 1919 he toured Basutoland and Bechuanaland. His sensitivity to African aspirations made him doubtful about South African plans to have Swaziland transferred to the Union, and Smuts's <span class="roman">Native Affairs Bill</span> (1920) tried to meet these doubts by providing for a native affairs commission. Botha died in office in 1919. Buxton's period of office was then prolonged; he finally laid it down in September 1920. On his return to England he was raised to an earldom and he became chancellor of the Order of St Michael and St George. Thereafter he did not play a very prominent role in politics, but in 1923&#150;4 he was an active supporter of Lord Grey of Fallodon's leadership of the Liberals in the House of Lords.<br>
<br>Buxton was twice married: first, in 1882 to Constance Mary (<i>d</i>. 1892), the second daughter of John Lubbock, first Lord Avebury, with whom he had two sons and one daughter; both boys predeceased their father, the younger in childhood. In 1896 he married Mildred Anne (<i>d</i>. 1955), elder daughter of Hugh Colin Smith, governor of the Bank of England, with whom he had one son, who was killed in action in 1917, and two daughters, the elder of whom predeceased her father. The osteomyelitis from which Buxton had suffered since his schooldays gave him trouble throughout his life and in 1930 he had to suffer the amputation of a leg. He died at his home, Newtimber Place, near Hassocks, Sussex, on 15 October 1934, and was buried at Newtimber.<br>
<br>Buxton was an energetic humanitarian whose temperament accorded well with his family's motto &#145;Do it with thy might.&#146; His voluminous writings also testify to his industriousness. He did not excel as a public speaker, but people were won over by his modesty and charm. Smuts wrote of his &#145;simplicity of character and approachableness&#146;. Fishing and shooting were his favoured recreations and he wrote on them also (notably <span class="italic">Fishing and Shooting</span>, 1902). He shared with his close friend Grey a taste for observing birds. These open-air pursuits gave him refreshment and solace amid the tragedies of his family life.<br>
