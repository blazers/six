<span class="headword">Donaldson,  John</span>  (1789/90&#150;1865), <span class="occ">composer and musicologist</span>, was the son of a Mr Donaldson and his wife, M. S. Gregg, and appears to have started his professional career as a music teacher in Glasgow from 1811 to about 1814. In 1826 he became an advocate in Edinburgh. In 1841 he applied for the Reid chair of music at the University of Edinburgh, and was elected in 1845 as its fourth occupant. He succeeded two English holders of the chair who had regarded it as a sinecure. Such had been their indolence that the funds for the chair (endowed by General Reid) had been allowed to be appropriated by the university authorities for other purposes and, to a man of principle (which Donaldson's <span class="italic">Statement</span> on the professorship, published in 1848, clearly shows him to have been), the appointment was little short of a poisoned chalice.<br>
<br>Donaldson, using his legal knowledge, was the first Reid professor to establish the chair on a proper footing. He instigated proceedings in the court of session in 1850 and, after five years of litigation, gained a decision in his favour. The university was ordered by the courts to build a music room and provide adequate moneys for it to function. The university senate did not finally carry out its obligations until 1861, the battle having by then broken Donaldson's health. He was granted a civil-list pension of &pound;75 in April 1861. The professorship being in &#145;the theory of music&#146;, he specialized in theory, acoustics, and even the engraving of music, as well as assembling for his department an outstanding collection of instruments, including a fine organ.<br>
<br>Donaldson's piano sonata in G minor, published about 1823 (reproduced in N. Temperley, <span class="italic">The London Pianoforte School</span>, 1985, 7.xviii, 275), is his only surviving composition. A powerful and ambitious work, hinting at cyclic structure, the piece is stylistically advanced in the context of British music of the period: given its quality, it is regrettable that Donaldson appears to have abandoned composing. He died at his home, Marchfield, Cramond, near Edinburgh, on 12 August 1865. His wife, Dorothea Finlay, predeceased him.<br>
