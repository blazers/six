<span class="headword">Atkinson,  Thomas</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1729, <em>d.</em> 1798), <span class="occ">architect and mason</span>, was baptized on 22 June 1729 at Holy Trinity Church, King's Court, York, the son of Thomas Atkinson (<i>d</i>. 1765), a mason, and his wife, Jane Marshall. He worked with his father on York Minster and in 1760 obtained his freedom at York as a stonecutter. He was in business with Joseph Atkinson (<i>d</i>. 1792) until the partnership was dissolved in May 1765. He then opened a stone yard in St Andrewgate, York, where he produced statuary chimney-pieces and church monuments, in conjunction with his developing practice as an architect. He can be identified with the Thomas Atkinson of York who drew plans of Fountains Abbey and Kirkstall Abbey for John Burton's <span class="italic">Monasticon Eboracense</span> (1758&#150;9), but his first known architectural commissions were for a gateway (1763&#150;5) and the new north front (1766&#150;9) at Bishopthorpe Palace for the archbishop of York.<br>
<br>Around 1765 Atkinson converted to Roman Catholicism, under the influence of the family of his first wife, Anne Russell (<i>c</i>.1731&#150;1774), whom he married on 7 July 1761. After her death he was remarried by 1776; his new wife was Mary (<i>c</i>.1751&#150;1796). In 1765 he began his long association with the convent of the Institution of St Mary (the Bar Convent), York: here he was responsible for both the design and building of the chapel (1766&#150;9) and the main front (1787&#150;9), among other buildings. This work brought Atkinson to the attention of the Roman Catholic gentry families of Yorkshire, from whom came his principal patrons: they included the Langdales, for whom he designed Houghton Hall, near Sancton (<i>c</i>.1765&#150;8), the Stapletons of Carlton Hall (later Towers), the Lawsons of Brough, the Gascoignes of Parlington, the Cholmleys of Brandsby, and the Constables of Burton Constable. Atkinson worked for the Constables for over thirty years from 1766, carving chimney-pieces, designing rooms and their fittings as well as an orangery and the Roman Catholic church at Marton. His final work was the Constable family mausoleum at Halsham (1792&#150;1802), which he hoped would &#145;speak&#146; of his &#145;character as a work-man for centrys to come&#146;  (Constable of Burton Constable deposit, East Riding of Yorkshire Archives Service, DDCC 43/125).<br>
<br>Thomas Atkinson was one of the most able architects working in northern England in the second half of the eighteenth century. His works, almost wholly confined to Yorkshire, include town houses, country houses, churches, and public buildings and demonstrate that, in ability, he rivalled the more prolific and better-known John Carr. His Palladian-style houses, particularly in the use of full pediments and flanking pavilions, owe much to James Paine, but greater originality is shown in the lively Gothic of Bishopthorpe Palace and the accomplished classicism of Halsham mausoleum and the interior of the Bar Convent chapel. Atkinson died on 4 May 1798 at home at 20 St Andrewgate, York, and was buried at St Saviour's there; there is a monument in the church to him and his two wives, Anne and Mary, erected by his son John, who inherited a business heavily encumbered with debt.<br>
