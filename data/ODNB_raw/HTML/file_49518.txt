<span class="headword">Powell,  Hugh</span>  (1798&#150;1883), <span class="occ">maker of optical instruments</span>, was born on 21 November 1798 in St Marylebone, Middlesex, the son of Thomas and Elizabeth Powell. Nothing is known of his education or apprenticeship. On 3 June 1824 he married Elizabeth Lealand; they had three children, Elizabeth Jane (<i>b</i>. 1827), Thomas (<i>b</i>. 1834), and Hugh Peter (<i>b</i>. 1838). During the 1830s, Powell was making microscopes for certain retailers in London, and traded as mathematical, optical, and philosophical instrument maker, offering microscopes and achromatic object glasses from 24 Clarendon Street, Somers Town. By 1840 he was signing his microscopes Hugh Powell, and he began in 1840 to date his instruments, a practice that was continued by him, and then his son, into the twentieth century. With the exception of one known telescope and one crystal goniometer, the sole product of the firm was microscopes. In 1841 he took into partnership his brother-in-law, Peter H. Lealand, and in December 1841 the names of Powell and Lealand were linked in the account of a new design of mounting for a microscope. Subsequent instruments were signed &#145;Powell &amp; Lealand&#146;.<br>
<br>The first innovation under the name of Hugh Powell was the design of a fine adjustment acting on the stage of a microscope, for which he received, in 1834, a silver medal of the Society of Arts. In this design a wedge was advanced under the stage by a micrometer screw, but this was not a satisfactory method because the illumination of the specimen was thereby altered. Powell was producing microscopes that were derived from the late eighteenth-century form of instrument, where the body tube was not held rigidly. The new design of achromatic objective produced to the specification of Joseph Jackson Lister (1786&#150;1869), which was published in 1830, meant that the resolving power of the instrument became much greater, and in consequence it could become a truly scientific instrument, provided the stand were redesigned. A prototype Powell microscope in the Museum of the History of Science at Oxford showed clearly the transition from the old to the new form of stand, which Powell exploited from 1841. He was awarded the silver medal of the Society of Arts in 1841 &#145;for his mode of mounting the body of a microscope&#146;.<br>
<br>The Microscopical Society of London (from 1866 the Royal Microscopical Society), which was founded in September 1839, ordered the best microscopes then obtainable from the three leading makers, Powell, Ross, and Smith. Powell delivered his microscope in December 1841; the massive stand, with six achromatic objectives, including one of 1/16 inch, cost the society &pound;94 10<i>s</i>., and became part of the society's collection at Oxford.<br>
<br>In November 1843 there was published in the <span class="italic">London Physiological Journal</span> a description of &#145;Powell and Lealand's new microscope&#146;. This was a radically new design, which became the basis of the firm's instruments for over sixty years. There is a true tripod support carrying the body on trunnions, which gave the necessary stability and ease of manipulation when the user was seated. The Powell tripod was adopted by other makers from the later nineteenth century well into the twentieth. In the 1860s the model became &#145;the large compound microscope&#146;, popularly known as the &#145;P &amp; L No. 1 stand&#146;. Four models were sold: the No. 1, which had all possible refinements to the highest possible standard of craftsmanship; the No. 2, which was less fully equipped, and therefore less costly; the No. 3, which was a smaller version; and the No. 4, a portable model similar to the No. 3. Two simpler stands were the No. 5, which was mainly for the use of students and did not have a fine adjustment, and the No. 6, a cheaper student's microscope.<br>
<br>Powell was the pioneer of very high powers in objectives. The first high-powered achromatic objective by a British manufacturer was Powell's of 1/16 inch as early as 1840. With his eldest son, Thomas, he made one of 1/25 inch in 1860, and four years later one of 1/50 inch. The first of the latter design was made for Lionel Smith Beale, and is dated 15 October 1864. This high resolution objective had a numerical aperture of 0.97, very close to the theoretical limit of 1.0 for a non-immersion lens, and cost &pound;31 10<i>s</i>. In 1869 the firm was also the first to produce in Britain a water immersion objective of 1/16 inch with a numerical aperture of 1.22. Medals for these objectives were awarded at international exhibitions in London (1862) and Moscow (1872). The high opinion of the firm's products was expressed in 1878 by the Belgian professor Henri van Heurck:<blockquote>Messrs Powell &amp; Lealand occupy quite a unique position in the microscopic world. Their workshops are very small, the number of instruments which they produce are few, but every piece of apparatus, marked with their name, is an artistic production, perfect in all its details. Moreover, both instruments and objectives of these makers are in the greatest request, and are used in England by all serious microscopists. (van Heurck, 163)</blockquote>Powell died at his home, 170 Euston Road, Somers Town, London, on 14 November 1883. His son Thomas took over the business, which effectively faded out of existence by 1914. The workshop was from 1832 to 1846 at 24 Clarendon Street, and from 1846 to 1901 at 170 Euston Road, which was named 4 Seymour Place, Euston Square, before 1857.<br>
