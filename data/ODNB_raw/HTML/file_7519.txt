<span class="headword">Denton,  Thomas</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1723, <em>d.</em> 1777), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and writer</span>, was born at Sebergham, Cumberland, and baptized in the parish church there on 2 December 1723, the fourth of five children of Isaac Denton (<i>d</i>. 1739), yeoman, of Greenfoot in Sebergham and his wife, Matilda, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Stanwix (<i>d</i>. 1762/3). He was educated by the Revd Joseph Relph (1712&#150;1743) at the village school, and edited his master's poems, which were published by subscription in 1747. Denton matriculated at Queen's College, Oxford, on 7 July 1740 and graduated BA on 4 March 1746, and MA in 1752.<br>
<br>Denton was left a small amount of property by his father but had to make his own way in the world. He took holy orders, being ordained deacon by Bishop George Fleming of Carlisle on 15 March 1746 and priest by Fleming's successor, Bishop Richard Osbaldeston, at Rose Castle on 26 June 1747. Having served as curate at Irthington, Denton went on to become curate to the Revd Robert Graham at Arthuret near by. There he resumed his minor literary career by privately printing a local poem entitled &#145;Gariston&#146;. In 1753, when Graham settled at Netherby on his family's estate, Denton became Graham's curate at St Giles's Church, Ashtead, Surrey. Here he became chaplain to Graham's aged and infirm relative Catharine, Lady Widdrington, last surviving joint heir to Charles Graham, third and last Viscount Preston (<i>d</i>. 1739), who persuaded Graham to resign the rectory in Denton's favour. He was duly presented by the Hon. Thomas Howard (later fourteenth earl of Suffolk and seventh earl of Berkshire) of Ashtead Park on 7 November and instituted on 14 November 1754. In 1755 or 1756 he married a Mrs Ann Clubbe, a Yorkshire woman, who was companion to Lady Widdrington on her death in 1757, and received a legacy from her mistress.<br>
<br>Denton continued to apply himself to literary studies. He edited a manual of meditations on central Christian themes entitled <span class="italic">Religious retirement for one day in every month; freed from the peculiarities of the Romish superstition; and fitted for the use of protestants</span> (London, 1758). This was based on the work of the seventeenth-century English Catholic convert John Gother. &#145;If, in any one instance&#146;, Denton opined in the advertisement, &#145;a sinner is brought by them to serious reflection and amendment of life, he will think his trouble amply compensated&#146;. He was also a minor poet in Spenserian vein though, as William Hutchinson tactfully put it, &#145;Fastidious criticism&#146; might say it is &#145;correct even to coldness&#146;  (Hutchinson, 420). Denton brought out <span class="italic">Immortality, or, The Consolation of Human Life: a Monody</span> (1754) and <span class="italic">The House of Superstition: a Vision</span> (ten pages, 1762), prefixed to William Gilpin's <span class="italic">Lives of the Reformers</span>. Both are poems in imitation of Spenser. Denton also compiled the supplemental volume to the first edition of the <span class="italic">General Biographical Dictionary</span> (1761).<br>
<br>Denton became corpulent and unwieldy in later life and died at Ashtead on 27 June 1777. He was buried in St Giles's Church on 1 July, leaving a widow and seven surviving children (three sons and four daughters). Thomas Howard gave the next presentation to Mrs Denton and by judicious management she turned the gift into a comfortable annuity.<br>
