<span class="headword">Wentworth,  Thomas</span>, second Baron Wentworth and <i>de jure</i> seventh Baron Le Despenser  (1525&#150;1584), <span class="occ">soldier and administrator</span>, was the eldest of at least eight sons and the heir of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29053/', "Thomas Wentworth, first Baron Wentworth (1501&#150;1551)")</script>, nobleman, and his wife, Margaret (<i>d</i>. 1551), elder daughter and coheir of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9936/', "Sir Adrian Fortescue")</script> and his first wife, Anne. The younger Thomas Wentworth had nine sisters. He was educated at St John's College, Cambridge, but took no degree.<br>
<br>Wentworth was not brought up at court and did not hold a household appointment, despite his father's regular attendance on Henry VIII. He may have served under his father in the campaigns of 1543 and 1544, when Lord Wentworth fought in France. He married his paternal cousin Mary (<i>d</i>. 1554), daughter of Sir John Wentworth of Gosfield, Essex, and his first wife, Anne, at Gosfield on 9 February 1546. This match was designed to consolidate family property and influence. Within a year he had joined the retinue of his second cousin, Edward Seymour, duke of Somerset and lord protector to Edward VI, and followed the army on its invasion of Scotland in 1547, where he distinguished himself at the battle of Pinkie on 10 September. For this service he was rewarded with the rank of banneret by Somerset at Roxburgh on 28 September, having two days previously been elected MP for his native Suffolk. His return to parliament reflected his father's dominant position in the county after the fall of Thomas Howard, third duke of Norfolk.<br>
<br>On 3 March 1551 Wentworth succeeded his father as second Baron Wentworth. He inherited extensive estates in Suffolk, Yorkshire, Oxfordshire, and Lincolnshire worth at least &pound;560 per annum in 1546&#150;7 and increased yet further during 1547&#150;51. Wentworth, like his father, quickly became an adherent of John Dudley, earl of Warwick. He attended on Mary of Guise, dowager queen of Scotland, when she stayed at court in October 1551. He was among the peers who tried and condemned Somerset for felony on 1 December. He benefited from Warwick's patronage as a result, receiving a favourable tax assessment and a licence to retain eighty gentlemen or yeomen in his livery in March 1552. He was appointed lord lieutenant of Suffolk on 16 May, with practical oversight of military organization in the eastern part of the county, while also exercising strong influence over many aspects of civil affairs. He was reappointed on 24 May 1553.<br>
<br>Wentworth witnessed Edward's settlement of the succession on Lady Jane Grey, but did not sign the document formally bastardizing Mary and Elizabeth or the engagement to oversee it because he was not a privy councillor. Geography as much as anything determined his course of action in July 1553. On the 11th he and his cousin Sir Thomas Cornwallis, sheriff of Norfolk and Suffolk, proclaimed Jane queen at Ipswich, Suffolk. Only a day or two later Cornwallis defected to Mary and winning over Wentworth became a prime aim of her East Anglian supporters. The legitimacy of her cause appears to have been decisive and on the 14th Wentworth agreed to support her, a decision he made public by joining her at Framlingham, Suffolk, with a sizeable body of men on the 16th. He was rewarded with immediate appointment to her privy council and as lord marshal of her army. After the failure of the coup by the duke of Northumberland (Warwick), Wentworth was among the privy councillors investigating the gentlemen pensioners who had supported it. However, generally his appointment as a privy councillor was honorary and reflected the queen's gratitude towards him for his loyalty.<br>
<br>The next stage of Wentworth's career was determined by the decision in September 1553 to appoint as lord admiral the then lord deputy of Calais, Lord William Howard. On 13 September Wentworth was nominated his successor and he took up his post in December. His wife probably died at Calais in 1554. They appear to have had no surviving children. He married his late wife's cousin Anne or Agnes (<i>d</i>. 1574), daughter of Henry Wentworth of Mountnessing, Essex, and his wife, Agnes, by 1556. They had two sons, Lord William Wentworth (1555/6&#150;1582) and Lord Henry Wentworth (1558&#150;1593), and a daughter.<br>
<br>As early as March 1555 doubts were expressed about Wentworth's relative youth and inexperience as well as his previous protestant leanings, and the choice does seem an odd one. Simon Renard, the imperial ambassador, regarded him as &#145;rather lightweight&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP Spain</span>, <i>1554&#150;8</i>, 144). Political reliability appears to have been the primary reason, for the loyalty of the officers of the garrison was suspect, especially the highly respected William Grey, thirteenth Baron Grey of Wilton, captain of Gu&icirc;nes, the only modernized fortification of the Calais pale. A definite tension can be detected between Wentworth and Grey of Wilton during the following years. It was Wentworth's misfortune to hold the command of Calais when Fran&ccedil;ois de Lorraine-Guise, second duc de Guise, invested it in the closing days of 1557. His surrender of the town to Guise at six o'clock in the morning of 7 January 1558 after a siege lasting only seven days sealed his historical reputation. The causes of the fall of Calais were many and various. Mary I's privy council bore a considerable responsibility, especially for its failure to act on Wentworth's requests in December 1557 for naval interception of French convoys of artillery and supplies up the English Channel. However, Wentworth himself was guilty of at least three major misjudgements. He believed that the French intended to attack the imperial town of Hesdin and not Calais&#151;a mistake that neither Grey of Wilton nor Philip II's administration in Brussels made. Second, when the French approached he refused to flood the plains round the town (the key to the defence system) on the grounds that he needed fresh water to brew beer for the garrison, and therefore expected a protracted siege. Third, only on 2 January 1558 did he request reinforcements from Philip, a delay that the latter's ministers later claimed absolved them from any responsibility for the disaster. Not irrelevant was a persistent rumour that Wentworth was personally opposed to allowing Habsburg troops into Calais if he could avoid it because of fear that they would seize the town on behalf of their master. George Ferrers in 1569, Thomas Churchyard in 1579, and others published vivid and full accounts that made the English public aware of the details of the siege and portrayed mid-sixteenth century warfare in all its viciousness.<br>
<br>Wentworth's wife escaped from Calais in December 1557 but was sent to the Fleet prison on charges of a religious nature on 19 August 1558. She was released at the end of the month and sent to her mother's home in Essex. A prisoner of war in France after 7 January 1558, Wentworth was indicted on 2 July of conspiracy to deliver Calais to the French, adhering to Henri II, and failing to call the array for musters or to raise the levies. On 15 July papers were issued sequestering Wentworth's estates and taking an inventory of his goods. He was eager to remain in France.<br>
<br>The accession of Elizabeth I in November altered Wentworth's position and the new government finally accepted his ransom. He returned to England in March 1559. He was arrested on 21 April on a warrant issued the previous day and William Parr, marquess of Northampton, organized his trial in his capacity as lord high steward. The trial took place on the 22nd. Lack of evidence and the unwillingness of the court to reopen questions relating to the Marian regime meant that Wentworth was acquitted: he &#145;quytt hym-seylff, thanke be God, and clen delevered, and whent in-to Wytyngtun colege, and there he lys&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Diary of Henry Machyn, Citizen and Merchant-Taylor of London, from 1550&#150;1563</span>, ed. J. G. Nichols, <span class="italic">Camden Miscellany</span>, CS, 1st ser., 42, 1848, 195).<br>
<br>Wentworth did not hold nationally important military office again but remained significant in local affairs, while retaining strong ties with the court. Elizabeth did not retain him as a privy councillor but he, and his family, were still regarded as loyal. Two brothers, James and John Wentworth, were drowned when the queen's ship <i>Greyhound</i> was lost carrying reinforcements to Le Havre in April 1563. Wentworth was part of the entourage that received Eric XIV, king of Sweden, on 8 September 1560. Like his wife, he was regarded as protestant and an English version of Heinrich Bullinger's &#145;Sermons&#146; translated by John Day was dedicated to him in 1561. He was appointed lord lieutenant of Suffolk in 1560&#150;61 and of Norfolk and Suffolk in 1569. This was possibly intended to counter the growing influence of Thomas Howard, fourth duke of Norfolk, whose pre-eminence in East Anglia eclipsed Wentworth's own. Wentworth organized the defence of Suffolk during the crisis years 1569&#150;70. Having first been named JP for Suffolk in 1554, he was promoted of the quorum in 1558&#150;9. He was appointed JP for Middlesex in 1561 and of the quorum in 1577. He used his influence to settle local disputes, maintained order, watching out for the activities of suspected Anabaptists, and regularly attended the Ipswich quarter sessions. Wentworth also busied himself in the early 1560s with the problem of insufficient numbers of ministers to fill vacant Suffolk parishes. He was trier of petitions in the House of Lords on a number of occasions and was a diligent legislator. He frequently served as a muster commissioner for London and sat on a variety of other commissions dealing with his locality. He still benefited from royal patronage, receiving a patent for concealed lands in 1570. Wentworth sat on Norfolk's trial in January 1572 and oversaw elections in Suffolk during the aftermath of the duke's fall. Rather surprisingly, his influence diminished after this. This was perhaps because he spent less time at the family seat of Nettlestead, Suffolk, and more time in Middlesex.<br>
<br>Lady Wentworth died on 2 September 1574 and was buried in Stepney church, Middlesex, the next day. Wentworth's eldest son also predeceased him. Wentworth died intestate at Stepney on 13 January 1584, was probably buried with his wife, and was succeeded by his second son, Lord Henry Wentworth, who received administration of his father's goods on the 18th. Wentworth may have married a third time: the navigator William Borough married a Lady Wentworth in Stepney on 9 September 1589.<br>
