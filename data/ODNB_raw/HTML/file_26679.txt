<span class="headword">Struthers,  John</span>  (1776&#150;1853), <span class="occ">poet and anthologist</span>, was born at Longcalderwood, East Kilbride, Lanarkshire, on 18 July 1776, the second son and fourth child of William Struthers, shoemaker, and his wife, Elizabeth Scott. Joanna Baillie and her family, then resident at Longcalderwood, took an interest in him as a child. After working as cowherd and farm-servant until the age of fifteen, he learned the trade of shoemaking in Glasgow, and settled at Longcalderwood in 1793 to work for Glasgow employers.<br>
<br>Struthers married on 24 July 1798 despite some opposition from his wife's family. In 1801 they settled in Glasgow, where he worked at his trade until 1819. During this time, he continued to read and write extensively, and through Joanna Baillie, he came to know Walter Scott, who helped Struthers in negotiations with Constable the publisher.<br>
<br>In 1803 Struthers published &#145;Anticipation&#146;, a successful war ode, prompted by rumours of Napoleon's impending invasion. His most popular poem, &#145;The Poor Man's Sabbath&#146;, appeared in 1804. Although digressive and diffuse, the poem is written in fluent Spenserian stanza, and expresses a passionate love of nature and rural life; &#145;The Peasant's Death&#146; was published as a companion piece to it in 1806. In 1811 &#145;The Winter Day&#146; appeared, followed in 1814 by <span class="italic">Poems, Moral and Religious</span>. In addition to poetry, Struthers published anonymously an <span class="italic">Essay on the State of the Labouring Poor, with some Hints for its Improvement</span>, in 1816. About the same date he edited, with a biographical preface, <span class="italic">Selections from the Poems of William Muir</span>. A pamphlet entitled <span class="italic">Tekel</span>, sharply criticizing voluntaryism, is another undated product of this period.<br>
<br>Struthers's wife died of consumption in April 1818, and was followed within two weeks by their youngest daughter, and within a few months by their eldest son. &#145;The Plough&#146;, written in Spenserian stanza, was nevertheless published in that year. His first marriage had been a love match; his second, to Cecilia Morton (1787/8&#150;1847) on 27 September 1819, was entered upon for his family's requirements. He and his second wife were to add six children to this family in their twenty-eight-year marriage. In 1819 Struthers also published <span class="italic">The Harp of Caledonia</span>, a good collection of Scottish songs in three volumes, with a supplementary essay on Scottish songwriters, compiled with the aid of Scott and Joanna Baillie. A similar anthology called <span class="italic">The British Minstrel</span> appeared in two volumes in 1821.<br>
<br>Having gained a literary reputation, Struthers reluctantly abandoned shoemaking to become editorial reader for Glasgow-based publishers. During this career Struthers produced in two volumes a <span class="italic">History of Scotland from the Union</span> (1827), and was engaged on a third volume at his death. In 1833 Struthers was appointed librarian of Stirling's Public Library, Glasgow, a position he held for about fifteen years. In 1836 he published his fine descriptive poem &#145;Dychmont&#146;. Besides numerous pamphlets, Struthers wrote many of the lives in Chambers's <span class="italic">Biographical Dictionary of Eminent Scotsmen</span>, and contributed to the <span class="italic">Christian Instructor</span>. His collected poems&#151;in two volumes, with a useful autobiography&#151;appeared in 1850. Struthers died in Glasgow on 30 July 1853, his second wife having predeceased him on 22 August 1847. Struthers Crescent in East Kilbride is named after him.<br>
