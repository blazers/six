<span class="headword">Martine,  George</span>  (1700&#150;1741), <span class="occ">physician</span>, was born at Claremont, St Andrews, Fife, the son of James Martine (<i>d</i>. 1725), owner of the Claremont estate, and his wife, Margaret McGill. He matriculated at the University of St Andrews in 1713/14, and paid fees for his bachelorship in 1716. Having decided on a medical career, in 1720 he studied under Alexander Monro <i>primus</i>, who taught medicine outside the University of Edinburgh prior to the foundation of the faculty of medicine there. He then moved to the University of Leiden, in the Low Countries, and matriculated in 1721 to study under Hermann Boerhaave. On his return in 1722 he obtained his degree of MD at St Andrews on testimonials signed by six eminent British physicians. He practised as a physician in St Andrews until late 1725. In that year he and William Graeme MD opened a medical school in the basement of the Surgeons' Hall, Edinburgh, where he taught the theory and Graeme the practice of medicine. The school was not a success, and Martine returned to St Andrews before 1728.<br>
<br>On his father's death Martine inherited Claremont, which he sold in 1732, though he remained at St Andrews until 1739. In his early years Martine had published several articles, in the form of letters or essays, dealing with the blood and organs of the human body, and by this time had developed an interest in the temperature of the circulating blood and animal heat generally. The difficulties of measuring temperature led him to investigate the unsatisfactory business of thermometer manufacture and the impossibility of comparing observations that had been made with a variety of instruments graduated to individual scales. Some of these referred to a single point, often the freezing point of water, and calculated higher points from the expanded volume of thermometric fluid (oil, mercury, or spirits of wine). He spent some of the latter part of 1739 in Paris, doubtless investigating the work of R&eacute;aumur and Delisle on this topic, from where he wrote to Cromwell Mortimer, secretary of the Royal Society. Martine came out strongly in favour of graduating thermometers with reference to two fixed points, one being the boiling point of water&#151;with due attention to barometric pressure&#151;the other being the melting point of ice. He also urged the adoption of mercury, as spirits of wine came in many strengths and could not be brought to the boiling point of water, while oil tended to adhere to the inside of the tube.<br>
<br>In December 1739 Martine was appointed physician to Lord Cathcart, commander-in-chief on the expedition to the West Indies. He spent the early part of 1740 in London, where his essays on thermometry were read to the Royal Society. He presented to the society copies of his books published in 1740, <span class="italic">De similibus animalibus et animalium calore</span> and <span class="italic">Essays Medical and Philosophical</span>. In the latter, two medical essays, &#145;On the period and crises of diseases&#146; and &#145;On the specific operation of cathartic medicine&#146;, were followed by a discourse on the history of thermometers and the evolution of their various scales, a comparison of the best-known reproducible scales, and an essay on the heating and cooling of matter, in which Martine challenged the conventional view that denser fluids heated more slowly by showing that a mercury thermometer responded faster than one containing spirit. The final long essay dealt with the degrees of heat and cold found in nature, ranging from the body heat of man and beast, and of fish and insects, to the heat of the sun and planets, the highest and lowest recorded temperatures of the atmosphere, the melting and boiling points of a variety of metals and minerals, and the temperatures of flame and fire. The <span class="italic">Essays &hellip; on Thermometers</span> went through several editions; that of 1792 contained additions and Joseph Black's tables, to serve the students to whom Black had recommended the book. After his death Martine's work was also translated into French.<br>
<br>Martine was elected an honorary fellow of the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh early in 1740. He had sailed to the West Indies by the time that he was proposed for membership to the Royal Society on 15 May; he was elected on 11 December. He died of a fever at Cartagena, in what is now Colombia, some time before April 1741.<br>
