<span class="headword">Owain Cyfeiliog</span> <span class="st"> [Owain ap Gruffudd]</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1197), <span class="occ">ruler in Wales</span>, was the son of Gruffudd ap Maredudd (brother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17762/', "Madog ap Maredudd, prince of Powys")</script>) and, according to later genealogies, Gwerful ferch Gwrgenau, said to have been a descendant of the historically shadowy ruler of Rhwng Gwy a Hafren, Elystan Glodrydd. In 1149 Owain and his brother Meurig received from their uncle Madog, then ruling over Powys, the commote of Cyfeiliog, a region including most of the middle valley of the Dyfi in western Powys. Owain's identification with Cyfeiliog accounts for his ordinary descriptive name, which distinguished him from his rival, Owain ap Gruffudd, called Owain Gwynedd. His hold on Cyfeiliog was, however, tenuous: in 1153 Rhys ap Gruffudd of south Wales wasted the commote, and by 1162 it was held by Owain Gwynedd.<br>
<br>Madog ap Maredudd's death in 1160 was followed by that of his son Llywelyn immediately afterwards. Owain now became the dominant figure in a fragmented Powys, establishing himself as the ruler of the southern part of the principality with his chief seat at Welshpool. Owain probably inclined towards Madog's general policy of alliance with the English against his dangerous neighbour and rival, Owain Gwynedd. In the summer of 1165, however, he joined Owain Gwynedd, Rhys ap Gruffudd, and other Welsh princes in the united resistance to Henry II's invasion of Wales. After advancing into the Berwyn Mountains, Henry had to withdraw, beaten by the elements and lack of food as much as by the enemy, and he never ventured on another Welsh campaign. The unity of the Welsh princes was, however, short-lived. In 1166 Owain and his cousin Owain Fychan expelled their uncle Iorwerth Goch from his land of Mochnant. In the division of spoils Owain Cyfeiliog obtained the western part of the territory (Mochnant Uwch Rhaeadr). In 1167 Owain himself had to face a joint attack on southern Powys by Owain Gwynedd and Rhys ap Gruffudd. Their forces took possession of Caereinion and the castle of Tafolwern, causing Owain to flee to England. He now fell back on marcher support, soon reappearing in company with a &#145;French&#146; (Anglo-Norman) army. He won back the lands he had lost and destroyed the new castle which his enemies had built at Caereinion. War continued between Owain Cyfeiliog and Rhys. In 1171 Rhys again invaded Powys, forcing Owain to surrender seven hostages for his good behaviour.<br>
<br>Despite Owain's opposition to Henry II in 1165, payments to him recorded in the pipe rolls testify to the generally cordial relations between them. This is confirmed by Gerald of Wales, who described Henry and the Welsh prince dining together at Shrewsbury; on this occasion Owain found the means of covertly rebuking the king for his habit of keeping benefices long vacant in order to enjoy the custody of their temporalities. In May 1177 Owain attended the great council at Oxford, at which Henry made his son John lord of Ireland. Together with other Welsh princes he took an oath of fealty to Henry as his overlord.<br>
<br>Owain Cyfeiliog probably married twice, first certainly to Gwenll&iuml;an, daughter of Owain Gwynedd, and second perhaps to Gwenll&iuml;an, daughter of Ednywain, claimed by later genealogies to be of the line of Gollwyn ap Tangno. As Owain grew older his sons, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/11806/', "Gwenwynwyn")</script> and Cadwallon, probably assumed his military role. According to the Welsh chronicles they were responsible for the murder of their kinsman Owain Fychan in 1187, though Gerald of Wales ascribes the crime to their father. In 1188 Owain Cyfeiliog was the only Welsh prince who did not go out with his people to meet Archbishop Baldwin during his crusading tour of Wales. For this negligence he was excommunicated. Earlier, in 1170, Owain had founded the Cistercian monastery of Strata Marcella (Ystrad Marchell) near Welshpool. Having taken the monastic habit in old age, he died there in 1197; he was buried near the high altar, and lauded in a Latin epitaph as &#145;ecclesiae cultor&#146; (a reverencer of the church). Gwenwynwyn, who succeeded to his father's dominions, completed the endowment of Strata Marcella.<br>
<br>Gerald of Wales includes Owain Cyfeiliog with Owain Gwynedd and Maredudd ap Gruffudd ap Rhys of south Wales as the three Welshmen who, in his days, were conspicuous for their justice, prudence, and moderation as rulers. The lavish hospitality of Owain's court&#151;&#145;Where there was drinking without want, without refusal&#146;&#151;was celebrated by the poet Cynddelw Brydydd Mawr. Cynddelw's poetry also testifies to Owain's raids against Anglo-Norman lands in the Shropshire marches, among them the territories of the Corbet lords of Caus, an aspect of his career which is ignored by the chronicles. The poet's evidence is complemented by the portrayal of Owain in the thirteenth-century Anglo-French romance &#145;Fouke le Fitz Waryn&#146; (the Fitzwarines held land of the Corbets at Alberbury). Here he features as &#145;un chevaler hardy e fer&#146; (a bold and fierce knight) who grievously wounds Fouke le Fitz Waryn.<br>
<br>Owain, whom Gerald of Wales praised for the readiness of his tongue, is renowned in Welsh literary history as a poet. Two poems, the lengthy &#145;Hirlas Owain&#146;, which is definitely ascribed to Owain in the <span class="roman">Red Book of Hergest</span>, and the shorter &#145;<i>Englynion</i> on the circuit of Wales&#146; have been regarded as his work. The &#145;Hirlas&#146; is an unusual poem, which, in dramatic style, depicts a feast in Owain's court following a raid in Maelor in north-east Wales to free his brother Meurig from prison, an event which the Welsh chronicles show to have taken place in 1156. Owain praises his brave warriors, calling upon his cup-bearer to bring the long blue (&#145;hirlas&#146;) drinking-horn filled with mead to each hero in turn. Recent stylistic analysis of this and the other poem, however, implies that their true author was Cynddelw Brydydd Mawr, Owain's court poet, and that the prince's role was that of a persona in the poems rather than their creator.<br>
