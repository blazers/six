<span class="headword">Blomefield, Sir  Thomas</span>, first baronet  (1744&#150;1822), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was born at Milton, Kent, on 16 June 1744, the only son of the Revd Thomas Blomefield (<i>c</i>.1691&#150;1771), rector of Hartley and Chalk, Kent, and chaplain to the duke of Dorset, and his second wife, Mary, widow of William Branch and daughter of John Matthews. In September 1755 Blomefield was placed by his father as a midshipman in the <i>Cambridge</i> (eighty guns) but after expressing his preference for the army he was procured a cadetship at the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, which he entered on 9 February 1758. His abilities in mathematics and chemistry drew the attention of John Muller (1699&#150;1784), then professor of fortifications and artillery, and he passed out as a lieutenant-fireworker in the Royal Artillery on 1 January 1759. Blomefield's previous naval experience secured the command of a bomb (that is, mortar) ketch that year, when aged only fifteen, at the bombardment of Le Havre, and afterwards he joined the fleet blockading Quiberon, under Admiral Hawke. Henceforth he was to become a specialist in water-borne artillery. On 5 March 1762 he sailed from Portsmouth on a bomb vessel with Lord Albemarle's expedition against Havana. He took an active part in the siege, which lasted from early July until the capitulation on 10 August. Shortly before, on 1 August, Albemarle promoted him second lieutenant, to replace losses in the field, a promotion confirmed by the Board of Ordnance the following year.<br>
<br>Following the end of the Seven Years' War Blomefield served with the garrison artillery at Pensacola and Mobile. Despite widespread sickness among the troops he survived with his health intact and was promoted first lieutenant on 28 May 1766. Following his return to England he became aide-de-camp to General Conway, master-general of the ordnance, in 1771. As a staff officer he was closely involved in developments in the peacetime ordnance establishment at Woolwich&#151;later to become the Royal Arsenal. He was promoted captain-lieutenant on 29 January 1773 and served as aide-de-camp to Lord Townshend on his succession as master-general. Much of his time was taken up with experiments in gunnery.<br>
<br>In the spring of 1776 Blomefield, at his own request, returned to active service, sailing with his company of the Royal Artillery to join General Burgoyne's army in Canada. On his arrival on 3 June he was given a staff appointment as major of brigade to Major-General Phillips, commander of the artillery. His principal task was to construct floating batteries on the Canadian lakes, which he had planned before he left England. With the army encamped for winter he returned to England in November with letters from Burgoyne and Phillips requesting further artillery and stores and his own return in the spring to assist Burgoyne's ill-fated expedition down the Hudson River. Back at Woolwich, at Burgoyne's request, he worked on a new gun and carriage designed for use on land and water. This he brought with him on his return to Canada the following year; eventually he rejoined the army at Ticonderoga on 23 July 1777.<br>
<br>Blomefield was reappointed major of brigade to Phillips until the latter's order of 14 September, returning Blomefield, again at his request, to regimental duties with the field artillery. He took an active part in the battle of Freeman's Farm (or Stillwater) on 19 September and served with Major William's battery at the battle of Bemis Heights on 7 October. Some twenty minutes after the attack began he was wounded in the face and took no further part. Baroness von Riedesel, who nursed him after the battle and upon the retreat to Saratoga, described how a bullet had passed through both cheeks, smashing his teeth and grazing his tongue:<blockquote>He could not keep anything in his mouth &hellip; We had some Rhine wine. I gave him a bottle, hoping that the acid would cleanse his wounds. He took a little in his mouth, and this alone had such a fortunate effect that his wounds healed entirely, and I gained another friend. (<span class="italic">Baroness von Riedesel</span>, 61)</blockquote>Blomefield was included in the Saratoga convention and signed the Cambridge parole. Despite the failure of congress to abide by the terms of the convention and return Burgoyne's army <i>en masse</i> to England, during the course of 1778 a growing number of officers were exchanged privately under parole, apparently including Blomefield, who had returned to England by the spring of 1779. In June he was called by his former commanding officer, Burgoyne, to give supporting evidence before a parliamentary committee of inquiry into the strength and disposition of the artillery.<br>
<br>In 1779 Blomefield returned to his former post as aide-de-camp to Lord Townshend and on 19 January 1780 he was promoted to the rank of full captain of no. 8 company, 1st battalion of the Royal Artillery. However it was not on the field of battle but at the ordnance establishment at Woolwich that he now made a major contribution. There was then great need for stricter military supervision of armaments manufacture, and in particular the proofing of guns at Woolwich before their use in the field. In 1780 Blomefield was appointed to the new post of inspector of artillery and in his first year he condemned as many as 496 pieces of ordnance in proof. The widespread problem of &#145;bursting&#146; led him to visit various foundries to examine the metals used, and to the consideration of instruments for better measuring the strength and accuracy of guns. The value of his efforts was quickly apparent and under a royal warrant of 24 January 1783 the whole department was reorganized; the artillery workshops, gun butts, and proof office were placed under Blomefield's entire control. His salary as inspector of artillery was raised to &pound;350. His responsibilities included periodic surveys of the strength and condition of coastal artillery. Between 1779 and 1793 he produced a series of systematic and detailed reports on the military ordnance along the coasts of eastern and southern England.<br>
<br>On 27 July 1788 Blomefield married Elizabeth, second daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29624/', "John Eardley Wilmot (1709&#150;1792)")</script>, chief justice of the court of common pleas; they had one son, Thomas William, born on 23 March 1791. Blomefield was promoted major on 25 September 1793 and lieutenant-colonel on 5 December of the same year. From 20 April 1797 he took on the additional post of inspector of the royal brass foundry (in 1801 his combined salary was &pound;441 5<i>s</i>.) and continued to hold both offices until his death. The administrative and technical changes that he introduced contributed greatly to the high quality of British cast iron and brass gun manufacture, which date from this period. Having been promoted full colonel on 12 November 1800 and major-general on 25 September 1803, on the creation of the 9th battalion of the Royal Artillery he was appointed its colonel-commandant on 1 June 1806.<br>
<br>In 1807 Blomefield was chosen to command the artillery in the expedition against Copenhagen, to enforce the surrender of the Danish fleet. The city was completely invested by 17 August and the bombardment began on 2 September. After 6000 shells had been fired into the city, setting it ablaze, on 5 September a flag of truce was flown, the bombardment was suspended, and the naval ships and stores were handed over. On 19 September Lord Chatham reported to Blomefield the king's intention to reward him &#145;as testimony of the sense entertained of your eminent services upon this occasion&#146;  (Duncan, 2.166). He also received the thanks of parliament and on 14 November 1807 was created a baronet. On 25 July 1810 he was promoted lieutenant-general, and on 19 July 1821 full general.<br>
<br>After an illness of three days Blomefield died at his home at Shooter's Hill in Kent on 24 August 1822, aged seventy-eight. He was survived by his only son, Sir Thomas William Blomefield, second baronet (1791&#150;1858). His long association with the Royal Arsenal, from the early 1770s until his death, covered a period of profound change there. What had been a miscellaneous collection of small craft-based workshops had become by the early nineteenth century an institution of national importance with the beginnings of a modern factory-based system. The great improvement in the manufacture of military ordnance, and consequently of their strength and reliability in the field, that Blomefield oversaw was an integral part of this process.<br>
