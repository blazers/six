<span class="headword">Wodeyar <span class="st"> [Wadiyar]</span>, Krishnaraja</span>  (1884&#150;1940), <span class="occ">maharaja of Mysore</span>, was born on 4 June 1884, the elder son of Maharaja Chamarajendra Wodeyar (1863&#150;1894), and succeeded his father as ruler on 1 February 1895. With an area of 29,462 square miles and a population of 5&frac12; million (1901) Mysore ranked second in importance after Hyderabad among the princely states of India. During his minority, his mother, Maharani Kempananjammanni Avaru Vanivilas Sannidhana (1866&#150;1934), ably served as regent and oversaw the expansion of social services and physical amenities in Mysore. The young maharaja was educated from 1896 to 1902 in a palace school with selected boys of his own age. Stuart M. Fraser, a prominent member of the Indian Civil Service who would later be the British resident in Mysore (1905&#150;10), Kashmir, and Hyderabad, served as his tutor and guardian. In 1900 Krishnaraja Wodeyar married Pratapa Kumari Bai, the daughter of Rana Bane Sinjhi Jhala, the talukdar of Vana in Saurashtra. They had no children.<br>
<br>After being invested on 8 August 1902 with full ruling powers, the maharaja quickly emerged as a distinctive synthesis of orthodox Hindu, modernizing administrator, and benevolent autocrat. He inaugurated a legislative council in 1907 and sanctioned several reforms of the Representative Assembly, established in 1882, but by 1940 only 2 per cent of the population had the franchise. Although the state administration did not provide adequate resources to support the implementation of a policy of compulsory primary education, Krishnaraja established the first university in princely India in 1916 and collaborated with the Tatas, a leading industrial family, in the inauguration of the Indian Institute of Science in Bangalore. He supported extensive hydroelectric projects on the Cauvery River which provided electricity for gold mining in Kolar, new industries, especially textiles, and municipalities, enabling Bangalore, the state administrative capital, to be the first city in India lit by electricity in 1905. This progressive ruler encouraged the industrialization policies of Sir M. Visvesvaraya, state engineer and <i>diwan</i> (chief minister), until 1919 when it became evident that they were significantly beyond the state's financial resources. Contributions of more than 70 lakhs of rupees, and loans of about 65 lakhs, to the British war effort in the First World War, post-war price and exchange fluctuations, and the annual subsidy of 35 lakhs paid to the British government of India according to the treaty of rendition of 1881 diminished developmental funds. Eventually the subsidy was reduced to 24&frac12; lakhs in 1927, the same amount specified in the initial treaty of 1799 between the British and Mysore.<br>
<br>In 1926 the maharaja appointed Sir Mirza Isma&#145;il, a Muslim friend since boyhood, as <i>diwan</i>. Isma&#145;il aggressively promoted the Mysore model of development which has been characterized as incorporating &#145;a collaboration between state and private capital, a high value attached to political and economic autonomy, a strong emphasis on complementary industries and a paternal approach, combining authoritarianism with certain populist measures&#146;  (Hettne, 297). The people of Mysore gained significant powers in local government, secondary and collegiate educational institutions in urban areas, expanding medical services, a good railway system, and new industries, but the maharaja and his chief minister conferred little power on popular politicians. Still, both British officials and Indian nationalists acclaimed the maharaja as a model ruler.<br>
<br>Krishnaraja Wodeyar was a modest, gentle, somewhat reclusive man who did not participate actively in imperial politics and as a devout, orthodox Hindu did not travel to Europe until 1936. He also adhered to a strict Hindu vegetarian cuisine and did not eat with Europeans. Simultaneously he cultivated diverse interests and personal contacts. He was a generous host to Europeans and Indians, especially during <i>keddahs</i>, the highly organized capture of wild elephants for training as work animals, and the week-long, elaborate celebrations of his birthday and of Dasara, the Hindu holiday marking the triumph of Ram, an ideal, divine ruler, over the villainous Ravan, on which occasion the maharaja was honoured as a deputy of the divinity. The maharaja served as the first chancellor of the Benares Hindu University from 1916 to 1922. A discerning patron of Indian music, he was also knowledgeable about European classical music, himself playing the violin. He welcomed Indian nationalist leaders to his state, including Mahatma Gandhi, while conceding little governmental responsibility to local Congress leaders. Even so, Gandhi characterized the maharaja's rule as like that of Ram. Krishnaraja was a supporter of federation with British India during the 1930s if it included an equitable resolution of financial issues and of the contested status of the British civil and military station in Bangalore. He magnanimously supported the British war effort during both the first and second world wars with contingents of troops as well as monetary contributions and loans. He was appointed GCSI in 1907 and GBE in 1917.<br>
<br>After suffering a heart attack at the racecourse in Bangalore in July, the maharaja died in Bangalore on 3 August 1940. He was succeeded by Chamarajendra Wodeyar, his nephew, who was the only son of his younger brother, Narasimharaja Wodeyar who predeceased him on 11 March 1940.<br>
