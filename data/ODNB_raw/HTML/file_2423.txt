<span class="headword">Binns, Sir  Henry</span>  (1837&#150;1899), <span class="occ">politician in Natal</span>, son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/57824/', "Henry Binns (1810&#150;1880)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/61990/', "Binns family")</script>] of Sunderland and Croydon, and Elizabeth Bowron (<i>d</i>. 1855), was born at Sunderland, co. Durham, on 27 June 1837, and educated at Ackworth and York. In 1858 Binns emigrated, arriving on 14 September in Natal, in its early days as a separate colony. He took up agriculture, and bought a property called Umhlanga (turned into a sugar estate in 1860) at Riet River, near Phoenix, Victoria county. In 1861 he married his cousin Clara, daughter of John Acutt of Riverton; they had one son. Subsequently Binns, a relative, Robert Acutt, and a friend amalgamated their estates. In 1868 Binns floated the Umhlanga Valley Sugar Estate Company in England and became its general manager; he retired in 1892.<br>
<br>Binns entered public life in 1879, selected by Sir Garnet (later Viscount) Wolseley as a nominee member of the legislative council under the crown colony system. After the first elections, in 1883, he represented Victoria county until his death. In 1888 he was a delegate from Natal to the conference at Bloemfontein on a South African customs union. The inaugural union was only partial and Natal did not join. In 1890 Binns was a delegate for the extension of the Natal Government Railway to Harrismith in the Orange Free State. In December 1893 he was sent to India to negotiate Indian labour for the sugar estates, and the return of previously indentured labourers to India.<br>
<br>Originally opposed to self-government for Natal, by 1893 Binns supported Sir John Robinson's policy introducing the reform; but he declined to join the first ministry under the new constitution, and so became a sort of leader of the opposition, whose duty it was, as far as possible, to support the ministry. In 1897, after the retirement of Sir John Robinson and Henry Escombe, Binns was appointed prime minister. On 5 October 1897 he became colonial secretary and minister of agriculture, but soon resigned the latter portfolio. He resolved the discontent of the Natal civil service and concluded an extradition treaty with the South African Republic. He marked the queen's jubilee by offering a monthly supply of coal from Natal for the use of the British navy. His first session of parliament began on 24 November 1897 and dealt mainly with the incorporation of Zululand and then with Binns's particular interest&#151;the entrance of Natal into the South African customs union, on which a conference was held in May 1898 at Cape Town. Binns was the chief delegate from Natal, a convention was settled and in compliance, on 20 May, he introduced a resolution in favour of the union into the Natal parliament. The policy was bitterly opposed, but Binns carried the enabling bill, read a third time on 30 June, through the assembly. However, his health failed on 6 July and he was unable to enter the house for the remainder of the session. He went to the Berea, returning to Pietermaritzburg in December 1898. In January 1899 he attended the postal conference at Cape Town and on 11 May was present at the opening of the Natal parliament, but he soon became ill again, and died at Pietermaritzburg on 6 June 1899. His body lay in state at the vestibule of the house of assembly and was buried on 7 June at the military cemetery, Pietermaritzburg. He was survived by his wife.<br>
<br>Binns's political life was marked by his courage and persistence. He was a pungent and succinct speaker, a good critic of finance, and a sound businessman, and was instrumental in developing the sugar industry in Natal; he was also a director of the Natal Bank and of the Durban Telephone and Tramways companies. He was made KCMG in 1898.<br>
