<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Morgan,  William Frend  De</span>  (1839&#150;1917), <span class="occ">potter and novelist</span>, was born on 16 November 1839 at 69 Gower Street, London, the second child of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7470/', "Augustus De Morgan (1806&#150;1871)")</script> and Sophia Frend (1809&#150;1892). His father was the first professor of pure mathematics at University College, London, a man of severe integrity who resigned on two occasions when he believed the college had transgressed its founding principle of religious toleration. His mother was active in the anti-slavery movement, the reform of prisons and workhouses, the founding of Bedford College for Women, and the suffrage movement. The atmosphere of the De Morgan household, at first in Bloomsbury and then in Primrose Hill, was a mixture of intellect, high-mindedness, word play&#151;the professor of pure mathematics had a terrible weakness for puns&#151;and mortality, for the family suffered from tuberculosis. William inherited the intellect and the word play in good measure: his simple nature delighted in intellectual and verbal fantasy. But the high-mindedness seems to have passed him by; he greeted life with innocent, quizzical humour. Mercifully, the tuberculosis also passed him by. Though never strong, he outlived his six brothers and sisters, four of whom did not reach the age of forty.<h2>
<a name="Education"></a>Education</h2>De Morgan was educated at University College School, London, and at the college itself, and then entered the Royal Academy Schools in 1859, hoping to become a painter. With his great domed forehead (inherited from his father) and his wavering, high-pitched voice which ended every sentence with a drawl, he was a strange and humorous figure among the students. He left the schools in 1862, doubting that he would make a painter. Not much is known of his activities in the 1860s, except that he met William Morris and Edward Burne-Jones, who became perhaps his closest friends, and that, probably encouraged by Morris, he began to design tiles and stained glass. Towards the end of the decade he was working at 40 Fitzroy Square, where he had a kiln in his studio. In 1872 he burnt the roof of the house off, and had to leave.<h2>
<a name="MaryDeMorgan"></a>Mary De Morgan</h2>De Morgan's father had died in 1871, and <i>c</i>.1872 De Morgan went to live at 8 Great Cheyne Row, Chelsea, with his mother and his youngest sister, <a name="cosubject_58943"></a><span class="headword">Mary Augusta  De Morgan</span>  (1850&#150;1907), <span class="occ">children's writer</span>. The Burne-Jones, Morris, and De Morgan households were all now in west London, and there was much coming and going between them. Mary De Morgan, a small, abrupt but lovable figure, told fairy stories to the Morris and Burne-Jones children, which were then successfully published. Her first book of children's stories, <span class="italic">On a Pincushion</span> (1877), was illustrated by her brother, who, typically, invented a special method for reproducing his drawings. Mary De Morgan died in Egypt in 1907.<br>
<br>William built a pottery kiln in the garden of the house in Great Cheyne Row, but it was soon too small, and about 1873 he rented Orange House, almost next door, and started a pottery there. It is on the products of this pottery, which he carried on at various sites for over thirty years, that his reputation mainly rests today.<h2>
<a name="Potter"></a>Potter</h2>De Morgan's work at Orange House was devoted almost exclusively to decorating tiles and different kinds of pots&#151;dishes, bowls, and vases. At first he bought ready-made tiles and pots to work on, and later the pottery made its own. But De Morgan was always much less interested in the shape and structure of pots than in their glazes, from a scientific as much as an artistic point of view. Some wares were decorated with enamel underglaze colours, others with the sheen of lustre, in emulation of the Renaissance technique which De Morgan was partly responsible for reintroducing in Britain. The pottery was small, and devoted almost entirely to his own designs; he was essentially a painter who had turned to the decorative arts, as did others in the 1870s. In this sense it stood alongside Morris &amp; Co. as one of the first workshops of the arts and crafts movement in Britain. As it happens, both workshops were short of space by the end of the decade, so Morris and De Morgan searched together for new premises. In 1881 Morris moved his works to Merton Abbey in south London; in 1882 De Morgan built his kilns near by.<br>
<br>The appeal of De Morgan's pottery lies in his glazes, which are richer and softer than those of his contemporaries; in his skill with colour&#151;his one-time partner Halsey Ricardo wrote of &#145;the pools of colour into which one can dive and scarce plumb the full depth&#146;  (Hamilton, 69); in his happy reinterpretation of Islamic pottery of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries; and in his decorative handling of birds, animals, and fish, some from nature, others from the comic bestiary of his own imagination&#151;one never knew there could be so many varieties of amiable dragon. Lewis Carroll admired his tiles, and had them installed in Christ Church, Oxford.<br>
<br>De Morgan appeared before the public as an artist, a decorator of pots and tiles. But the public did not see him at the pottery, absorbed in its technicalities, working at the chemistry of his glazes, overseeing the tense and unpredictable business of firing lustre wares. His friends and associates saw him, rightly, as an inventor and a scientist. And though he had little to do with the pottery industry in Stoke-on-Trent or elsewhere, his workshop was, in a quite untheoretical way, a real combination of art and science.<br>
<br>On 5 March 1887 De Morgan married Evelyn Pickering (1855&#150;1919) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/45491/', "Morgan, (Mary) Evelyn De")</script>]. Talented, humorous, and forthright, she had established herself as a successful painter despite, it seems, the opposition of her wealthy family. He was forty-eight, she was thirty-two. She painted sumptuous figure subjects with lofty themes in a late Pre-Raphaelite manner&#151;all that her whimsical husband's pots and tiles were not. But they made an excellent couple. As a small sign of their mutual eccentricity, they were married quietly, went to the railway station, and caught the first train that happened to be available; it took them to the Isle of Wight. On their return they settled into 1 The Vale, King's Road, Chelsea, next door to James McNeill Whistler. It was a childless marriage, but successful; they laughed at each other a lot, and she strengthened his resolve.<br>
<br>The daily journey to Merton Abbey taxed De Morgan's health, and in 1889 he moved the pottery to purpose-built premises nearer home, off Townmead Road in Fulham. These were financed partly by Evelyn and partly by the architect Halsey Ricardo, with whom he formed a partnership in 1888. The Fulham phase of De Morgan's work lasted longer than any other and saw its crowning achievements, especially in lustre wares of great technical and aesthetic sophistication. But the benefit of the move was partly lost in 1892, when doctors advised that he should spend the winters outside Britain. From 1892 the De Morgans wintered in Florence. It was difficult to run the pottery from a distance and De Morgan's long absences were felt by the staff; in his busy, boffinish way, he had always been its moving spirit. His letters from Florence refer to financial losses. There was a temporary closure in 1903; around 1904 he had to stop designing because of neuritis in his thumb; and the company was finally wound up in 1907, though several of De Morgan's employees continued under their own names. He was in his mid-sixties, and had perhaps reached his natural term for such work. Commentators nod sagely over his lack of business sense, and quote him as saying &#145;It is not well organised, it is very ill De Morganised in fact!&#146;  (Hamilton, 48). But that was self-deprecation. De Morganization had worked well enough for more than thirty years.<h2>
<a name="Novelist"></a>Novelist</h2>Just as the pottery was closing down, De Morgan became a best-selling novelist. This man in his sixties, who had hardly written anything and not read much, who had been absorbed all his life in the wordless conventions of the decorative arts, was now full of words. In 1901 he had begun to write a story, and then put it by. He was about to throw it away with other papers when Evelyn looked at it and encouraged him to go on. By 1904 there was a manuscript of 500,000 words. It was published in July 1906 as <span class="italic">Joseph Vance: an Ill-Written Autobiography</span> and became a best-seller. The inconsequence of the whole affair delighted De Morgan, and he continued to be puzzled by his own success. Sometimes he reflected on how the money he earned as an author might have allowed him to continue as a potter.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">Joseph Vance</span> was followed by <span class="italic">Alice-for-Short</span> (1907), <span class="italic">Somehow Good</span> (1908), <span class="italic">It can Never Happen Again</span> (1909), and <span class="italic">An Affair of Dishonour</span> (1909), which was set, exceptionally, in the seventeenth century. Then came <span class="italic">A Likely Story</span> (1911) and <span class="italic">Ghost Meets Ghost</span> (1914). His two last novels, <span class="italic">The Old Madhouse</span> (1917) and <span class="italic">The Old Man's Youth</span> (1921), were completed by Evelyn and published after his death. All were published in London by Heinemann, and all but one by Henry Holt in New York. The typical De Morgan novel is long, crowded with characters, rambling in construction, and set in mid- or late Victorian London. De Morgan's cockneys, who are often rescued from poverty or the dangers of drink by a benign member of the middle class, are memorable, and he was proud to acknowledge Dickens as his model. Although they appeared around 1910, these novels were a throwback to an earlier style of story-telling. But to see them as neo-Dickensian is to notice their externals and to overlook the gentle, puzzled inwardness with which he reflected on life. He was more open to complexity than Dickens, less indignant at the evils of society. Dotheboys Hall in <span class="italic">Nicholas Nickleby</span> was a fierce and successful attack on the &#145;Yorkshire schools&#146; system. De Morgan's young hero Joseph Vance experienced the violence and stupidity of the English public school system, but he also excused it to those he loved. He behaved &#145;more puerorum&#146;, as De Morgan put it, &#145;as boys do&#146;  (W. De Morgan, <span class="italic">Joseph Vance</span>, 1906, 145).<br>
<br>De Morgan left it up to his characters to develop the story, and he read each week's writing over to his wife, thus populating their homes. He found it easier to write in Florence, and their flat in the via Lungo il Mugnone, which had been full of Evelyn's high themes and William's comic frogs and startled deer, became full of Evelyn's high themes and William's cockney scamps. But by 1914 Florence had become melancholy to them through the deaths of friends, and they went back to London for good. In 1910 they had moved from The Vale to 127 Church Street, Chelsea, where they lived for the rest of their lives. De Morgan, now seventy-five, was still writing, though constantly disturbed by fierce anti-German feelings. He was a familiar figure in the streets of Chelsea during the war, carrying the shopping home, taking his evening walk on the Embankment, white-haired, a little bent, but brisk and frank. He died at his home on 15 January 1917 and was buried in Brookwood cemetery, Surrey, five days later. Evelyn died on 2 May 1919 and is buried with him. The draped classical figures of Grief and Joy on their tombstone, which she designed, recall her more than him.<h2>
<a name="Reputation"></a>Reputation</h2>An image like the wheel of fortune is needed to give shape to William De Morgan's life and reputation. (Evelyn would have given such an image its full solemnity; William, perhaps feeling its power more, would have drawn it as a joke.) It had operated in his own life, taking him up to fame as a potter, down to financial failure, up again to fame as a novelist and down to death. And it went on turning. His friends thought that, because the British like literature more than art, his novels would survive better than his tiles and pots, and there was some interest in the novels between the wars. But gradually they lost their readership and reputation. <span class="italic">Joseph Vance</span> was last republished in 1954; since the late 1950s all of De Morgan's novels have been out of print. The pots and tiles started from a position of low esteem: in 1939 an official guide to the tile collections in the Victoria and Albert Museum referred to their &#145;dank period flavour&#146;  (Catleugh, 76&#150;7). But since the mid-twentieth century their reputation has risen with the tide of interest in Victorian decorative art. In 1968 the De Morgan Foundation was set up to preserve the paintings of Evelyn and the pottery of William De Morgan collected by her sister Anna Maria Stirling at Old Battersea House in south London. Today De Morgan's pots and tiles are eagerly studied and collected (examples are in the Victoria and Albert Museum, London; Birmingham Museums and Art Gallery; the De Morgan Foundation; and the William Morris Gallery, London), while his novels are unregarded. It has been so for about forty years. It almost seems as if the wheel has stopped.<br>
