<span class="headword">Ealhmund</span> <span class="st"> [St Ealhmund]</span>  (<em>d.</em> 800), <span class="occ">prince and martyr</span>, is the subject of a <i>passio</i> (account of martyrdom) preserved only in the fourteenth-century manuscript in the Gotha Forschungsbibliothek (MS I.81). This text, which is utterly unreliable, presents him as the son of Aldfrith, king of Northumbria, and himself king after the murder of King Osred in 716. After emphasizing his religious inclinations, it describes how he journeyed to what is now Wiltshire to protect some lands he had there against enemies, how the men of Wiltshire were attacked by &AElig;thelmund, ealdorman of Mercia, and how Ealhmund, having failed to mediate a peace, fought on the side of the Wiltshire men and lost his life in assisting them to victory at Kempsford. This account is historically valueless and seems to be based on the 800 entry in the chronicle of John of Worcester, which describes the battle of Kempsford (as in the <span class="roman">Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</span>), which was indeed fought between the men of Wiltshire and Ealdorman &AElig;thelmund, but which did not involve Ealhmund. The latter's death in 800, however, is recorded at the end of the same annal in John's chronicle, and it appears that the author of the <i>passio</i> has conflated this with the preceding account in order to provide Ealhmund with a spurious history involving the battle, which he has in addition misdated to 822.<br>
<br>The true history of Ealhmund is given, insofar as it can be known, in what is almost certainly a reliable annal for 800 in the <span class="italic">Historia regum</span>, which states: &#145;Some say that Ealhmund, son of King Alchred, was apprehended by King Eardwulf's guards and on his orders was killed along with those who had fled with him&#146;  (Symeon of Durham, <span class="italic">Opera</span>, 2.63). Ealhmund was thus the son of a former king, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/39121/', "Alhred (fl. 765&#150;774)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20928/', "Oswulf")</script>], and the brother of another, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20904/', "Osred II")</script>, expelled in 790. He would no doubt have been a threat to Eardwulf, who was of another line, and this adequately explains his killing. According to what is probably the ninth-century section of an early eleventh-century list of saints' resting places, <span class="italic">Secgan be &thorn;am godes sanctum &thorn;e on Engla lande &aelig;rost reston</span> (&#145;Concerning God's saints who formerly rested in England&#146;), however, his remains were enshrined at Derby. The <i>passio</i> also mentions the translation of his remains from the place of his death (Lilleshall in Shropshire) to Derby, and this information about the localities of his subsequent cult is likely to be reliable. The principal church of Derby was dedicated to him and preserves an impressive late Saxon coffin lid which may possibly come from his shrine. Veneration of him as a royal saint who suffered a violent death is paralleled by that of other saints of this date such as Cynehelm and Wigstan, but it is not easy to explain why he should have been venerated in Mercia. The explanation may lie in the war between Eardwulf and King Cenwulf of Mercia in 801, fought because Eardwulf accused Cenwulf of sheltering his enemies, among whom Ealhmund was no doubt numbered. Tension between the kings continued, for Pope Leo III (<i>r</i>. 795&#150;816) blamed Cenwulf for the expulsion of Eardwulf from his kingdom in 807&#150;8. In these circumstances, the Mercian kings may have had an incentive to foster Ealhmund's cult at what was probably the royal church of Derby, as a means of advertising and commemorating Eardwulf's guilt in Ealhmund's murder.<br>
