<span class="headword">Kirkwood,  James</span>  (<em>b. </em><em>c.</em>1650, <em>d.</em> in or after 1709), <span class="occ">clergyman and advocate of parochial libraries</span>, was born in or near Dunbar. His schooling took place there, and from 1666 he studied at Edinburgh University, where he graduated MA in 1670. Scott's <span class="italic">Fasti ecclesiae Scoticanae</span>  (<span class="italic">Fasti Scot.</span>, 2.132) states that he was chaplain to Sir John Campbell of Glenorchy, later earl of Caithness and earl of Breadalbane. This period of service must have occurred between 1670 and 1676 and coincided with theological study. It is to these years that should be attributed Kirkwood's great interest in the highlands, although there is no evidence that he himself knew Gaelic.<br>
<br>On 13 July 1676 Kirkwood was licensed as a probationer by the presbytery of Haddington, and he thereafter preached in various parishes. In particular he assisted at the Fife parish of Wemyss in 1677&#150;8 during the terminal illness of the minister, James Nairn. Presented to the borders parish of Minto in February 1679, he was collated by the bishop and installed in May. However, he was deprived after 1 November 1681 for refusing to take the test. In 1683 he was probably allowed to preach at Colmonell, Ayrshire, but soon moved to England, becoming on 1 March 1685 rector of Astwick in Bedfordshire. This appointment was possibly the result of an acquaintance with Gilbert Burnet, a prot&eacute;g&eacute; of Nairn, who after 1688 became bishop of Salisbury. Burnet was intimate with Robert Boyle the chemist; another close friend of Boyle was Thomas Barlow, bishop of Lincoln, in whose diocese Astwick lay. Kirkwood remained at Astwick until January 1702, when he was outed as a nonjuror. His means of earning a living thereafter is unknown. Elected on 4 March 1703 a corresponding member for Scotland of the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge (SPCK), he seems to have moved back north by the end of 1704. His last known places of residence were Alderston and Ferrygate, both in his native Haddingtonshire.<br>
<br>Kirkwood is remembered for involvement in two enterprises: the distribution of the <span class="roman">Bible</span> in Gaelic to highland parishes; and the advocacy of parish libraries throughout Scotland, particularly the highlands. During his employment with Glenorchy, Kirkwood would have become aware of the highlanders' ignorance of the <span class="roman">Bible</span> through the lack of printed editions in Gaelic. Coming into contact with Boyle in the mid-1680s, he learned of Boyle's sponsorship of an edition of the <span class="roman">new Testament</span> in classical Gaelic in 1681 for distribution in Ireland. In 1685 Boyle financed the first printed edition of the <span class="roman">Old Testament</span> in classical Gaelic for similar distribution. Kirkwood prevailed upon Boyle to allow some 200 of these to be diverted to Scotland, along with any undistributed copies of the 1681 <span class="roman">New Testament</span>. Unfortunately classical Gaelic differed considerably from spoken Scottish Gaelic, and the texts were printed in a fount using Irish letter-forms. It took many years for copies to be distributed: communications were difficult and the times troubled; and after the triumph of presbyterianism in 1688 many Scottish clerics viewed the episcopalian (and future nonjuror) Kirkwood with suspicion. The promotion of Gaelic itself was also contentious, but Kirkwood was convinced of the merit of his actions, producing a justificatory printed broadside (<span class="italic">An Answer to the Objection Against Printing the Bible in Irish</span>), probably about 1689.<br>
<br>Kirkwood prevailed upon Boyle and others to finance a version of the Gaelic <span class="roman">Bible</span> in a Roman fount, printed in an edition of 3000 in London in 1690, along with a separate issue of 1000 <span class="roman">New Testaments</span>. The work was edited by Robert Kirk, minister of Aberfoyle, who also provided a Scottish Gaelic glossary and made textual alterations to conform with Scottish usage. Kirk also about this time probably supplied Boyle, via Kirkwood, with information about highland rites and customs. Although the general assembly of the Church of Scotland had encouraged distribution of these copies in an act of 11 November 1690, no doubt more closely to supervise the scheme, it took until the end of the decade for distribution to start, following further agitation by Kirkwood. About 1000 bibles went to Argyll alone, with hundreds going to other parts of the highlands. With these bibles often went a catechism, with prayers and creed, in Gaelic, printed in London in 1688, a publication initiated by Kirkwood and again subsidized by Boyle.<br>
<br>In 1698 the SPCK was founded, with its main interest the formation of parochial libraries, particularly in the colonies, and charity schools. Kirkwood wholeheartedly endorsed the society's aims and placed them in a Scottish context. In 1699 he anonymously had a tract printed (most probably in Edinburgh) entitled <span class="italic">An overture for founding and maintaining of bibliothecks in every paroch throughout this kingdom</span>. Under this ambitious and radical scheme the parish minister's private books were to form the nucleus of each library, the parish schoolmaster was to act as librarian, and a uniform system of cataloguing was to be adopted throughout the country, with a union catalogue kept in Edinburgh. Nothing came of this proposal, but he modified his ideas in a second anonymous tract of 1702, <span class="italic">A copy of a letter anent a project, for erecting a library, in every presbytry, or at least county in the highlands</span>. This had been anticipated by a printed broadside probably of 1701 (<span class="italic">An Account of a Design to Erect Libraries in the Highlands</span>). Money was raised, and by the end of 1705 about 100 boxes of books, some designed for presbyteries and some for parishes, had been assembled and shipped to Edinburgh, complete with catalogues. Upwards of 4000 books and 2000 pamphlets were involved. By then Kirkwood was a member of the SPCK, and although the English and Anglican overtones of the society made presbyterian Scots wary, the general assembly felt it best, as it did with Bible distribution, to supervise the scheme by ensuring its own direct involvement: acts of support were passed in 1703, 1704, 1705, 1706, and 1709. Boxes were distributed but, as with bibles, the difficult political and religious situation and the remoteness of the region created many setbacks. Most libraries lasted only a short time.<br>
<br>Even within the SPCK criticism of the scheme was recorded in May 1704. However, Kirkwood defended himself to the society's satisfaction. He had been interested in the society's other main interest, charity schools, since the late 1690s. The promotion of schools, particularly in the highlands, grew in importance for him in his last years. He was possibly the author of <span class="italic">Proposals concerning the propagation of Christian knowledge in the highlands and islands of Scotland</span> (1707?), and the Society in Scotland for the Propagation of Christian Knowledge was established in July 1709, with Kirkwood a founder member. This is the last contemporary record of Kirkwood; it is assumed he died soon afterwards. As there is no reference in any source to a wife, it also has to be assumed that Kirkwood was unmarried. Besides the tracts and broadsides already mentioned he wrote: <span class="italic">An account of the design of printing about 3000 bibles in Irish, with the Psalms of David in metre, for the use of the highlanders</span> (1689?); <span class="italic">A memorial concerning the disorders of the highlands. Especially the northern parts thereof, and the isles of Scotland. With an account of some means by which the same may be redressed and prevented</span> (1703); and <span class="italic">The true interest of families, or, Directions how parents may be happy in their children &hellip; To which is annexed a discourse about the right way of improving our time</span> (1692). This went into a second edition the following year, entitled <span class="italic">A New Family Book</span>. All his works except the last were issued anonymously.<br>
