<span class="headword">Veel,  Robert</span>  (1647/8&#150;<em>c.</em>1674), <span class="occ">poet</span>, probably born at Alveston, Gloucestershire, was the younger son of William Veel (<i>d</i>. 1656), of Symondshall, Gloucestershire, and Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. in or before 1656), daughter of Robert Culliford. Veel's family had been impoverished by the post-civil war sequestrations of the estates of his father and his grandfather, the royalist plotter <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28171/', "Colonel Thomas Veel")</script>. His father's will, while leaving Robert &pound;500 when he came of age, also made provisions for binding him as an apprentice. Veel entered St Edmund Hall as a commoner at the age of fifteen on 25 April 1663 and spent ten terms at Oxford, but he did not take a degree. He later went to London, presumably after coming into his inheritance in 1668 or 1669. There, according to Wood, he &#145;lived after the manner of poets in a debauch'd way, and wrote partly for the use of his idle and vain Companions, but more to gain Money to carry on the Trade of Folly&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 1.517). In 1672 Veel published <span class="italic">New Court-Songs and Poems</span> under the name R. V. gent., dedicating it to &#145;Mr. T. D.&#146;. It has been suggested that this was the playwright and poet Thomas D'Urfey; however, this is unlikely as D'Urfey was only born in 1653. Collections like these were quite in vogue at the time among young aspiring blades about town, but few of the 129 <span class="italic">New Court-Songs and Poems</span> are of any literary merit. The majority are love poems in rhyming couplets addressed to various of the poet's muses, most commonly &#145;Clariza&#146;, interspersed with loyal odes, drinking songs, and some savagely misogynist celebrations of bachelorhood and the roistering life. &#145;A Rant Against Marriage&#146; puts it plainest:<blockquote>
<div>And when with Sorrow their [bachelors'] hearts are sunk<br>
</div>
<div>They may go to the Tavern, and be drunk<br>
</div>
<div>And never be dogg'd by a Bitcherly Punk<br>
</div>
<div>To ask them why, or wherefore.<br>
</div>
</blockquote>The best is &#145;Snow&#146;, a more mature poem which defuses worldly vanity by comparing individuals to snowflakes which might fall on a palace or a dunghill but which are all doomed to be melted by the sun. It is not possible, however, to say which pieces are Veel's own; some, indeed, have attributed the whole collection to Robert Vine. Wood records that Veel also published &#145;Poor Robin's Intelligence&#146;, which appeared in a half-sheet weekly in 1672 or 1673, and that this attack on &#145;the Misses of the Town&#146; provoked a retort from one &#145;K. C.&#146; entitled &#145;Poor Robin's Elegy, or, The Imposter Silenc'd&#146;. Veel died about 1674, leaving no children. His grave is unknown.<br>
