<span class="headword">Novosielski,  Michael</span>  (<em>c.</em>1747&#150;1795), <span class="occ">scene painter and architect</span>, although Polish in name, was born in Rome. When he arrived in England is not known, but by 1772 he was living in Golden Square, London. On 3 September 1776 he married the singer Regina Felicia Pasquali (<i>d</i>. 1820) at St Pancras Old Church. The Drury Lane account book in the Folger Shakespeare Library shows that he worked on at least two occasions for that theatre in 1777. But in 1781 he began his long scenic association with the King's Theatre in the Haymarket, where in 1783 he was made master painter. He worked with Gaetano Marinari, and with Cornelius Dixon, Thomas Luppino, and A. Thiselton as assistants.<br>
<br>Between 1781 and 1784 Novosielski prepared scenery and machinery for many operas and ballets at the King's Theatre. Jean-Georges Noverre was ballet master and had an exacting eye for scenic standards. It should be remembered that many individual scenes would be taken from stock and that Novosielski may have only contributed by adding occasional new scenes and supervising the refurbishment of existing ones. In this way, during his first season, 1780&#150;81, he worked on the operas <span class="italic">Mitridate</span>, <span class="italic">Il barone di Torre Forte</span>, and <span class="italic">Piramo e Tisbe</span> and the ballets <span class="italic">Les caprices de Galath&eacute;e</span>, <span class="italic">M&eacute;d&eacute;e et Jason</span>, and <span class="italic">La frascatana</span>. In 1781&#150;2 he prepared scenes for the ballets <span class="italic">Les amants r&eacute;unis</span>, <span class="italic">Le triomphe de l'amour conjugal</span>, and <span class="italic">Rinaldo and Armida</span> and the operas <span class="italic">Giuno Bruto</span>, <span class="italic">Apollen et les Muses</span>, and <span class="italic">Ifigenia in Aulide</span>. In 1782&#150;3 he designed scenes for the ballets <span class="italic">Il ratto delle Sabine</span> and <span class="italic">Il riposo del campo</span> and the operas <span class="italic">Cimene</span>, <span class="italic">The amours of Alexander and Roxane</span>, and <span class="italic">La dame bienfaisante</span>.<br>
<br>In 1782 the King's Theatre underwent considerable rebuilding, planned by Novosielski. Confined to the original walls of 1705, he increased capacity by reducing stage depth and planning the auditorium on the lines of an Italian opera house: &#145;The stage and pit were rebuilt, and four tiers of boxes completely encircled the auditorium&#146;  (Nalbach, 28). However, &#145;Being confined to the original walls, Mr Novosielski had not the opportunity of giving it greater width; the form therefore remained extremely bad, and the stage and its appendages wretchedly confined and inconvenient&#146;  (Saunders, 80). In fact, Novosielski added some width to the auditorium by placing the corridors and access to the boxes outside the walls of the original building.<br>
<br>During 1783&#150;4, when Jean Dauberval was appointed ballet master and Auguste Vestris junior the principal dancer, Novosielski contributed to the ballets <span class="italic">The Pastimes of Terpsychore</span>, <span class="italic">The Slaves of Conquering Bacchus</span>, and <span class="italic">The Four Ages of Man</span> and the operas <span class="italic">Il trionfo d'Arianna</span> and <span class="italic">Le due gemelle</span>. During his final season in 1784&#150;5 he designed scenes for the ballets <span class="italic">Le jugement de Paris</span> and <span class="italic">Il convitato di pietra</span> and the operas <span class="italic">Il curioso indiscreto</span> and <span class="italic">Artaserse</span>.<br>
<br>At the close of this season Novosielski's architectural interests led him to begin what was to be a secondary career as a property developer. In 1785 he took a lease on land to the south of Brompton Road in Kensington, where he built seventy-seven houses in three developments&#151;Michael's Place, Michael's Grove, and Brompton Crescent. He later built speculatively in Grosvenor Square and in Piccadilly. On his death he left a half-completed development (Fortfield Terrace) at Sidmouth, Devon.<br>
<br>Early in the 1783&#150;4 season the management of William Taylor at the King's Theatre foundered, and while he was in gaol for debt Novosielski was appointed one of five trustees to whom Taylor's business interests were assigned. <span class="italic">The Case of the Opera-House Disputes, Fairly Stated</span> (1784) criticized the work of the trustees, charging Novosielski with sacking staff and misappropriating theatre income in order to invest in the Royal Circus. He was accused of taking a holiday in Italy, accompanied by his wife, and claiming expenses of &pound;1500 from the opera fund for it as a recruiting trip for new singers. Novosielski was also charged with increasing his salary from &pound;300 to &pound;750 per annum and claiming expenses for coals, candles, and dinners at the theatre. It was claimed that his wife was paid &pound;150 per annum for superintending the candles and that her father was paid &pound;200 as &#145;superintendent of something, but what that something is, heaven only can tell&#146;.<br>
<br>The theatre was destroyed by fire on 17 June 1789, and, notwithstanding these charges, Novosielski, assisted by his pupil William Capon, planned the rebuilding to permit enlargement of audience capacity by increasing the overall size by 30 feet in width and by 38 feet in length. The <span class="italic">London Chronicle</span> on 7 October 1790 reported:<blockquote>The span of the roof is 25 feet wider than that of Westminster Hall &hellip; The formation gives the idea of a lyre. The boxes consist of four complete tiers, besides an additional tier on each side. The whole, as they rise, are thrown back, by which means every person in the boxes will be visible from any part of the house. The boxes exceed in number those in any former theatre&#151;sixty.</blockquote>The theatre was &#145;hailed as an architectural marvel of a size and magnificence to rival Piermarini's La Scala in Milan&#146;  (Price, Milhous, and Hume, 562). The theatre opened on 26 March 1791 with Joseph Haydn &#145;presiding at the harpsichord&#146;  (Hogan, 1277). In spite of the speed and shoddiness of its construction, Novosielski's theatre lasted for over fifty years.<br>
<br>During 1794&#150;5 Novosielski returned to the theatre and prepared scenery for the opera <span class="italic">L'amor contrastato</span>. He died on 8 April 1795 in Ramsgate, and his will was proved on 11 April. He was buried in the churchyard of St Laurence, Ramsgate. His executor was left &pound;20 to undertake his duties and to dispose of &#145;sundry Household Estates &hellip; in the County of Middlesex&#146;. From the estate, one-third was to go his &#145;dear wife Regina Felicia Novosielski&#146; and the remaining two-thirds to his four children. His will does not name the children, but Regina's will, administered in 1820, names three of the four: Michael Peter, Mary Ann, and Ursula; a second son, James George, died in October 1799 with the loss of the frigate <i>Lutine</i>.<br>
<br>It is presumed that Novosielski's scene designs were destroyed in the 1789 theatre fire&#151;hence, perhaps unfairly, his reputation relies upon his architectural work, where some evidence survives. But his age applauded his scenic work and very early in his career he was expected &#145;to rival soon in scene painting, even Loutherbourg himself&#146;  (<span class="italic">General Advertiser</span>, 27 Feb 1781). His portrait by Angelica Kauffman, executed in 1791, shows him holding his 1789&#150;90 plans for the rebuilding of the King's Theatre.<br>
