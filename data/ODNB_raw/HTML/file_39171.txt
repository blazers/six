<span class="headword">Keynes <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Brown]</span>,  Florence Ada</span>  (1861&#150;1958), <span class="occ">social and political activist</span>, was born on 10 March 1861 at 76 Elizabeth Street, Cheetham, Manchester, the eldest of the three daughters and three sons of Dr John Brown (1830&#150;1922), Congregationalist minister, and his wife, Ada Haydon, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Ford (1837&#150;1929), schoolteacher. Educated at home, she was offered a scholarship at Newnham Hall, Cambridge, when she was seventeen, on the strength of her results in the Cambridge senior local examinations. She began her studies there in 1878 by following the syllabuses originally designed to test the educational standards of schoolteachers. Through mutual family acquaintances in the Congregationalist church, she met <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/39170/', "(John) Neville Keynes (1852&#150;1949)")</script>, logician and economist, and they became engaged in 1880. Having passed several examinations at Newnham, she went home to assist in teaching at her mother's school, but returned to Cambridge on her marriage to Keynes on 15 August 1882. Three children, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/34310/', "John Maynard Keynes")</script>, economist, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/31310/', "Geoffrey Langdon Keynes")</script>, surgeon, and Margaret Neville (who married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/31230/', "Archibald Vivian Hill")</script>), social reformer, were born in quick succession.<br>
<br>With her own financial position secured, Florence Keynes turned her attention to voluntary work, following the ideals of service encouraged both by her religious affiliation and by Newnham. She worked for a number of projects associated with the health care and education of girls and mothers, and in 1895 became secretary of the Cambridge branch of the Charity Organization Society. Her public career began in 1907 when she was elected a local poor-law guardian; she became chairman of the board in 1922. Her brief election manifesto emphasized the view that those parts of the board's work which dealt with women, children, the aged, and the sick, were especially the province of women guardians. Her experience as a guardian left her dissatisfied with the possibilities for effective action by the boards: she felt that she needed the wider powers of the local government politician, but women married to householders had no local franchise, nor power to sit as councillors. When in 1914 married women became eligible to serve as town and county councillors, Florence Keynes became the first woman councillor in Cambridge. She served on the borough council for many years, as alderman from 1930 and as mayor in 1932. In 1920 she was among the first group of women to be made magistrates. During her years on the council she took a particular interest in issues of public and mental health, manifested in the founding of the Papworth colony for tuberculosis victims, and in her work for Fulbourn Mental Hospital. On the national stage she campaigned for the establishment of juvenile courts and urged women to act as jurors and magistrates. She was instrumental in the introduction of women police in 1931 after a campaign lasting seventeen years: this was a typical example of the way women lobbied patiently for reforms through what she later called &#145;long periods of working and waiting&#146;  (<span class="italic">Cambridge Daily News</span>, 19 Jan 1952).<br>
<br>Working in a private or public capacity, through voluntary or official bodies, Florence Keynes helped to start the country's first juvenile labour exchanges, an open-air school for sick children, a scheme to provide free spectacles and dental treatment for needy Cambridge schoolchildren, surgical aids for the disabled, and respectable lodgings for single women, as well as founding the local folk museum, and setting in motion the scheme to rebuild Cambridge's Guildhall. Much of her voluntary work was performed together with colleagues in the National Council of Women, of which she became national president in 1930. Besides numerous papers on social issues and women's contribution to public life, she published late in life two books of memoirs, one of Cambridge and the other of her large and close-knit family, to whom she always extended generous hospitality. On her ninetieth birthday she described the strategy that she and her women colleagues had adopted in their pursuit of social change: identifying a need, experimenting voluntarily with solutions at a local level, and if successful, seeking to persuade central or local government to carry on with the scheme on a wider scale.<br>
<br>Florence Keynes died on 13 February 1958, shortly before her ninety-seventh birthday, at her home in Cambridge, 6 Harvey Road. A memorial service was held for her in King's College chapel on 22 February, attended by representatives of the university, the town, and the many voluntary organizations and projects in which she had been involved.<br>
