<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Tierney,  George</span>  (1761&#150;1830), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born at Gibraltar on 20 March 1761, the third son of Thomas Tierney, a native of Limerick, sometime London merchant and prize agent at Gibraltar, and his wife, Sabina (<i>d</i>. 23 July 1806). Thomas Tierney, a man of some affluence, spent his later years in Paris, but his wife lived in England, where their children were educated. George attended Boteler's School, Warrington; Eton College; and Peterhouse, Cambridge. He was entered at Lincoln's Inn in 1780 and called to the bar in 1784, but did not practise. On 9 July 1789 he married Anna Maria (<i>d</i>. 1844), the daughter of Michael Miller of Bristol, with whom he had one son and three daughters.<br>
<br>At the general election of 1784 Tierney unsuccessfully contested Wootton Bassett as a supporter of Pitt; but when he stood for Colchester on a vacancy in December 1788 it was as an adherent of the whig opposition. After a double return (both candidates polled the same number of votes) he was seated by an election committee in April 1789. At the general election the following year he was defeated at Colchester, against the return for which he lodged an abortive petition, and at Wootton Bassett. These electoral adventures, though partially subsidized from opposition funds, took a heavy toll of his finances. As co-treasurer of the Association of the Friends of the People, he gained the friendship of Charles (later Earl) Grey and a reputation as an enthusiast for French republican principles. At the general election of 1796 &#145;Citizen&#146; Tierney, financed by public subscription, contested Southwark as a supporter of peace and reform. He was defeated by his niece's wealthy husband, George Woodford Thellusson, but had the election declared void on petition. Although he was beaten by the same opponent at the consequent by-election, his petition secured him the seat in December 1796.<br>
<br>Tierney, who had joined the Whig Club in 1791, went into active opposition to Pitt. He refused to countenance the Foxite secession from parliament and established himself during it as the ministry's most potent opponent in the Commons, where he excelled on financial questions, which suited his essentially practical mind. Ever the pragmatist, he retreated from his advanced position on parliamentary reform, though he remained convinced of the need for moderate change. A clash in the house with Pitt on 25 May 1798 led to their fighting a bloodless duel at Putney two days later. By flouting the secession, Tierney seriously damaged himself in the eyes of many Foxite whigs. Fox himself never had much time for him; and while Grey and Lord Holland stayed friendly, they felt that he had been misguided. Having forfeited much of the popular support on which his seat depended and alienated most of the influential whigs, he was in urgent need of political and personal security. In early 1801 he renounced all allegiance to Fox and gravitated to the Carlton House group. He responded eagerly to the advances of Pitt's successor Addington in the autumn, tempted by the prospect of becoming paymaster with &pound;3000 a year and a house. Thwarted by the refusal of Grey and Lord Moira to join the ministry, he kept the negotiations alive for four months, but finally lost his nerve in January 1802. He was given an uncomfortable time at Southwark at the general election in July, when he was returned second in the poll.<br>
<br>Convinced by a visit to France that Bonaparte was determined on renewed war, Tierney backed Addington's belligerent response in May 1803 and soon afterwards took office as treasurer of the navy. He was pleased with his bargain, but it did him little good: Pittites as well as many Foxites now held him in contempt, and his patent unease in the house gratified his enemies. Pitt would have retained him in office in May 1804, but he resigned with Addington. He acted as a go-between in Pitt's subsequent attempts to effect a reconciliation between the prince of Wales and George III, but the postponement of the royal reunion in August prompted him to decline for the moment the proffered reward of the Irish secretaryship. By working thereafter to try to separate the prince from opposition and attach him to Pitt, Tierney further angered the Foxites and Grenvillites. Aware that it would be politically suicidal to commit himself to Pitt at this stage, he turned down the secretaryship (which it was later alleged that he had wished to hold without a seat in the Commons) in November 1804. By going into desultory opposition to Pitt the following session he restored some of his credibility with the Foxites, but no place was found for him on the formation of the Grenville ministry in February 1806. He rejected offers of the governorship of the Cape and a special mission to Lisbon later in the year. The death of Fox removed a major obstacle to his advancement, and in October he was taken in as president of the Board of Control, where he proved to be highly efficient. At the general election that month he was defeated at Southwark, but he was hastily accommodated at Athlone through a government bargain with the patron. This marked the end of his career as a political freelance.<br>
<br>Tierney, who had established himself as an unofficial whip and party factotum, resigned with his colleagues in April 1807. He was largely responsible for organizing the opposition effort at the ensuing general election, but was himself left without a seat, and it was not until August that the duke of Devonshire provided him with one at Bandon Bridge. He was anxious to promote the creation of an active, efficient opposition, to be remodelled from the Grenvillite right if the more unruly elements on the far left proved unmanageable. He soon grew disillusioned with the feeble Commons leadership of George Ponsonby, Grey's successor, and with Grey's laziness and reluctance to assert his overall authority. His attempts to mediate between Grey and his brother-in-law Samuel Whitbread, whose personal pique and espousal of advanced views threatened to split the party, were generally unsuccessful, though through no fault of his own. At times during the 1807 parliament, when opposition was often in a state of chaos, Tierney lapsed into hopeless despondency, and talked of giving up politics or of letting the insurgents destroy the party so that it could be reconstructed on a sounder basis. Thomas Creevey, Whitbread's mischievous henchman, gave him the nickname of &#145;Mrs Cole&#146;, after a brothel keeper in Samuel Foote's farce <span class="italic">The Minor</span> who was forever proclaiming her own respectability. Yet his nervousness, pessimism, and irresolution in council were in marked contrast to his forcefulness and skill in debate, where his mastery of sarcasm and forensic argument made him a formidable parliamentarian.<br>
<br>At the general election of 1812 Tierney again failed to find a seat, but at the end of the year Holland secured his return for Appleby on Lord Thanet's interest. Although he initially discounted the chances of mounting effective opposition in the new parliament, he took a bold personal line against the renewal of war in 1815, when he belatedly joined Brooks's Club. That summer his most pressing debts were paid off by a discreet party subscription, to which most of the whig grandees contributed. He obtained further relief in 1816 through legacies from a brother-in-law. He encouraged whig involvement in the popular campaign against the property tax that year, and in 1817 came out strongly in favour of moderate but significant parliamentary reform. Ponsonby's death seemed to clear the way for Tierney to replace him as leader in the Commons; but it was not until after the general election of 1818, when he was returned by the duke of Devonshire for Knaresborough (where he sat for the rest of his life) that he was installed. With many misgivings, he accepted a requisition got up by lords Duncannon and Sefton, signed by 113 members and half-heartedly endorsed by Grey. He was chosen in part <i>faute de mieux</i>; but in the opinion of all those who mattered in the mainstream of the party, his merits marginally outweighed his defects. The left had little faith in him.<br>
<br>Although Grey refused to clarify the problem of the overall leadership, which Tierney considered essential if the party was to be presented as a credible alternative government, the opposition made an impressive start to the 1819 session under his direction. On 18 May, however, he blundered by moving for inquiry into the state of the nation. His speech for once was not impressive, and, as usual on questions of confidence, disgruntled tories and waverers rallied to the ministry; the motion was humiliatingly crushed by 358 votes to 178. Tierney favoured a vigorous response to the Peterloo massacre and the subsequent repressive legislation; but during a speech in the house on 22 December 1819 he was taken ill. His health had been deteriorating for some years and, although he recovered and soldiered on as leader into the new reign, he made it clear to Grey and others that his future exertions must be on a restricted scale. He took a lead in trying to promote petitions in support of Queen Caroline at the end of 1820 and did well personally in the debates of early 1821. The failure of the whig campaign, the continued intransigence of the party's more extreme elements, over whom his authority was largely gone, his exasperation with Grey's selfish idleness, and his own unreliable health brought him formally to resign the leadership in March. Though far from being an unqualified success, he had generally performed with credit in a difficult, perhaps an impossible situation.<br>
<br>Old Tierney, as he was now habitually called, though he was only sixty, was intermittently active in the Commons for the remainder of the 1820 parliament. His correspondence with Grey appears to have ceased in 1825. They fell out politically in April 1827 when, after complex negotiations, Tierney joined Lord Lansdowne and Devonshire in taking office in Canning's ministry, as master of the Royal Mint with a seat in the cabinet. On Canning's death in August he stayed on with Lansdowne under Lord Goderich, but vehemently objected to the proposed appointment of the anti-Catholic Herries as chancellor of the exchequer. After suffering agonies of indecision in the ensuing crisis, he capitulated with Lansdowne in order to save the government. His subsequent efforts to secure the neutrality of Lord Althorp and the young whigs were frustrated, but in November 1827 he persuaded Goderich to appoint Althorp chairman of the finance committee. The impasse caused by Herries's belatedly revealed hostility to this broke Goderich's nerve and destroyed the ministry. Tierney was dismissed by the duke of Wellington when he formed his administration in January 1828, but received assurances, which were honoured, that something would be done for his son George (<i>d</i>. 1883), a minor diplomat in delicate health. His political career was effectively over, though he voted silently for Catholic emancipation in 1829. He died suddenly, of heart failure, at his London house at 11 Savile Row on 25 January 1830. He died intestate and relatively impoverished, and the government granted his widow a civil-list pension of &pound;400 a year.<br>
<br>Tierney was a man of great personal charm. Holland wrote that &#145;his pleasantry and easy manners shed a charm over all intercourse with him&#146;  (Holland, 266). A master of debate, he would probably have made a fortune had he opted for a career at the bar. As a working politician he could be combative and effective, but he was often indecisive and prone to enervating pessimism. A pragmatist above all, he was perhaps too much given to intrigue, though he served the whig party faithfully after expiating his earlier sins, for which some, however, never forgave him. Sir James Mackintosh recalled him as &#145;so shrewd and droll&#151;the words seemed made for him&#146;  (<span class="italic">Memoirs of &hellip; Mackintosh</span>, 475).<br>
