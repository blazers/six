<span class="headword">Townshend, Sir  John</span>  (1567/8&#150;1603), <span class="occ">landowner and local politician</span>, was the elder son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27633/', "Sir Roger Townshend (c.1544&#150;1590)")</script>, courtier, and his second wife, Jane (<i>c</i>.1547&#150;1618), the eldest daughter of Sir Michael Stanhope of Shelford, Nottinghamshire. In childhood Sir Roger had inherited a house in Stoke Newington, Middlesex; property and land in Suffolk, Oxfordshire, Middlesex, and Essex; and twenty manors around Raynham, Norfolk, acquired by the family at the dissolution of the monasteries. As London agent, first of Thomas, fourth duke of Norfolk (executed in 1572), and then of his son Philip, earl of Arundel (imprisoned in 1585), Roger enjoyed Howard patronage, a determining factor in his son's life.<br>
<br>John Townshend matriculated from Magdalen College, Oxford, aged thirteen, on 24 November 1581, then transferred to Trinity College, Cambridge, where his father and his uncle Michael Stanhope had been; in 1591 Townshend presented Cambridge University with a formidable staff for its senior proctor. Townshend, unexceptionally for a gentleman, never graduated, leaving university for foreign travel. He probably served with his father in July 1588 on the fleet sent against the Armada under Charles Howard, Lord Howard of Effingham, subsequently fighting under Sir Francis Vere in the Netherlands. He took residence at Raynham following his father's death in 1590. His widowed mother in 1598 married Henry Berkeley, seventh Lord Berkeley. Townshend had himself married, in December 1593, Anne (1573&#150;1622) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/66940/', "Townshend, Anne")</script>], eldest of the three daughters of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/998/', "Nathaniel Bacon")</script> of Stiffkey, near Raynham, a man of wealth, puritan leanings, and considerable local influence, who was sheriff of Norfolk in 1599 and was knighted in 1604.<br>
<br>Townshend was returned for Castle Rising, Norfolk, to the parliament that met on 19 February 1593. Thereafter he became increasingly active in local affairs, where power struggles tended to reflect court faction. As a Howard client, like his father, his father's friend Sir Edward Coke, and his father-in-law, Townshend opposed the royal favourite, the earl of Essex, supported in Norfolk by Sir Arthur Heveningham. In 1596 Townshend accompanied Lord Thomas Howard on the Cadiz venture, being knighted by him for valour. The following year, in opposition to Heveningham, Townshend was elected to parliament for Norfolk as knight of the shire, and in 1601, again rebuffing Essex partisans, he was returned for Orford, Suffolk, probably through the influence of Coke, the borough's recorder, and of his uncle Michael Stanhope. As his name does not appear in the journals of the House of Commons his parliamentary participation remains conjectural.<br>
<br>Local struggles for power were bitter, bringing violence and instability to the county. About 1598 Townshend became a justice of the peace, but within two years he was dismissed from the bench for quarrelling with Heveningham's supporter Sir Christopher Heydon, a relation of his father's first wife. In 1597 Townshend's appointment to the Norfolk musters commission was successfully blocked by Heveningham, so he was unable to participate until December 1598, thereon frustrating Heveningham's ambitions to increase Norfolk's small number of very large foot companies to thirty-three small ones; about then his father-in-law obtained for him a captaincy of the foot company for the hundreds of Gallow and Brothercross. In 1600 Heydon challenged Townshend to a duel, averted by the privy council, Coke promising surety for Townshend's keeping the peace. Even so, seemingly Townshend was debarred by Heydon from the Norfolk musters commission until July 1601, when the privy council ordered his reinstatement. That same year Theophilus Finche was involved in a serious dispute with Townshend, Sir Robert Cecil acting as peacemaker. Townshend died, possibly at his home at Stoke Newington, on 2 August 1603 from a wound received the previous day in a duel fought on horseback on Hounslow Heath. His opponent, a relative on his father's side, Sir Matthew Browne, was killed on the spot. Browne, the member of parliament for Gatton, Surrey, was also a client of Lord Thomas Howard, which may suggest his quarrel with Townshend was personal. Townshend died intestate, letters of administration being granted the day following his death. His estate passed to Roger, his seven-year-old son, created a baronet in 1617; his younger son, Stanhope, died in London of wounds received duelling in the Netherlands; his daughter, Anne, married John Spelman. His widow, with the children, took residence at her father's house at Stiffkey, and died there in early November 1622, a few days before her father's death.<br>
