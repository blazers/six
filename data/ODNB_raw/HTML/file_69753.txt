<span class="headword">Stafford <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Stafford]</span>,  Dorothy</span>, Lady Stafford  (1526&#150;1604), <span class="occ">courtier</span>, was born on 1 October 1526, one of the seven daughters of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26205/', "Henry Stafford, tenth Baron Stafford (1501&#150;1563)")</script>, and his wife, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/75346/', "Ursula Stafford (d. 1570)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22451/', "Pole, Margaret")</script>]. She spent part of her childhood in the household of her aunt Elizabeth Howard, duchess of Norfolk, and in 1545 married her cousin Sir William Stafford (<i>d</i>. 1556) of Chebsey, Staffordshire, whose first wife, Mary Boleyn, had died the previous year. While her parents remained loyal to the old church, her husband prospered in the court of Edward VI and her later association with the future Elizabeth I may have begun then.<br>
<br>On 29 March 1555, together with two of their children, Elizabeth and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26203/', "Edward Stafford")</script>, and their cousin, Elizabeth Sandys, Dorothy Stafford and her husband took up residence in Geneva. Elizabeth Sandys had been a long-serving member of Elizabeth's household until Mary ordered her removal for her strong protestantism in 1554. They all joined the English church at Geneva after it was founded on 13 October 1556, and there another son, John, was baptized on 4 January 1556 with John Calvin serving as his godfather. Sir William died several months later and was buried on 5 May 1556. Lady Dorothy never remarried, but six children are commemorated on her funeral monument, three boys and three girls. The third son was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26217/', "William Stafford")</script>, later involved in a conspiracy to prevent the execution of the queen of Scots in January 1587, but her other two daughters may have died in infancy. Following a dispute with Calvin over the custody of John Stafford, Dorothy left Geneva with Elizabeth Sandys for Basel, where she was granted burghership on 3 November 1557 and where they lived until 14 January 1559. David Starkey has &#145;guessed&#146; that Lady Dorothy was the source for their neighbour John Foxe's narrative of Elizabeth's captivity, but Elizabeth Sandys is more likely. What, if any, association she had with the conspiracies involving her brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26215/', "Thomas Stafford")</script>, executed in 1557, and her brother-in-law, Sir Robert Stafford, who helped her in her dispute with Calvin, is a mystery.<br>
<br>In 1559 Dorothy Stafford and Elizabeth Sandys went to France, where Dorothy claimed to have legal business to resolve, and where they were &#145;the queen's own gentlewomen&#146; treated to the queen of Scots' &#145;disdainful speech&#146; during that summer  (<span class="italic">CSP foreign, 1558&#150;9</span>, 522). Both returned to England in the autumn and joined the privy chamber soon afterwards, although in Lady Dorothy's case there is conflicting evidence over the date. The cofferer of the household's account records her entering wages on 13 August 1562, although the privy chamber wage list of 1589 dates the warrant to 13 August 1559. The not entirely reliable Sir James Melville of Halhill recorded seeing her during his embassy to Elizabeth in September 1564:<blockquote>[the queen] caused me to eat with hir dame of honour my Lady Stafford (ane honourable and godly lady, wha had bene at Geneva banissit during the regne of Quene Mary), that I mycht be always neir hir Majestie, that sche mycht confer with me; and My Lady Staffordis dochter [presumably Elizabeth] was my mestres for I was of ther acquaintance when they passit throw France. (Melville, 123)</blockquote>The Spanish ambassador's description of Dorothy Stafford as mistress of the robes in 1582 may not be entirely accurate, but by then she was undoubtedly one of the most established gentlewomen of the privy chamber. She was also the only waged gentlewoman from the &#145;old nobility&#146;, though her prominence may have been due as much to personality as to rank. She was certainly one of Elizabeth's favourite sleeping companions. In October 1576 she broke her leg in a riding accident, and Mary Scudamore had to be recalled from holiday to replace her so that Elizabeth could sleep peacefully. She and Elizabeth suffered simultaneous nightmares over the execution of Mary, queen of Scots, in 1587. She was active in numerous minor acts of patronage, though not as a protector of the godly, possibly a result of her disillusion with Calvin.<br>
<br>Dorothy Stafford's children were undoubted beneficiaries of their mother's closeness to the queen. Her daughter Elizabeth (who may have been Elizabeth's goddaughter) joined her in the privy chamber on 28 November 1568, serving as a chamberer until her own death in 1599. When Elizabeth's first husband, Sir William Drury of Hawsted, Suffolk, was killed in a duel in 1590, she received one of the queen's more famous letters of condolence. But the political waywardness of Dorothy's sons Edward and William, both of whom flirted with treason, may have put their mother's influence severely to the test. She did not attend Elizabeth's funeral, possibly because of ill health, and died in September 1604. She was buried in St Margaret's, Westminster, where her funeral monument, recording that she had served Elizabeth for forty years, &#145;lying in the bed chamber&#146;, was erected in the nave just below that of Blanche Parry.<br>
