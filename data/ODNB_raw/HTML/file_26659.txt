<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Street,  George Edmund</span>  (1824&#150;1881), <span class="occ">architect and architectural theorist</span>, was born on 20 June 1824 at Woodford, Essex, the third son of Thomas Henry Street (<i>d</i>. 1840), solicitor, and his second wife, Mary Anne Millington (<i>d</i>. 1851). A principal shaper of the architectural style later called &#145;High Victorian&#146;, he was also one of the most thoughtful architectural writers of his day.<h2>
<a name="Education"></a>Education</h2>Street attended schools in Mitcham and Camberwell until the age of fifteen, when his father retired and moved the family to Devon. There he took painting lessons and explored the local architectural antiquities with his brother Thomas, but despite his artistic and antiquarian leanings he found his first employment back in the family law office in London. After this brief professional detour and his father's death, Street was articled to Owen Carter of Winchester, an enthusiastic antiquarian and a competent but unremarkable architect who produced both classical and Gothic designs. Street was Carter's pupil for two years and his assistant for a third, before moving to London in 1844, when he found a place in the office of George Gilbert Scott.<br>
<br>Street was a craggily handsome man with a powerful intellect, and a brilliant draughtsman, whose special forte was the fluid pen-and-ink perspective. In Scott's office in the late 1840s these talents were fully appreciated, as work went ahead simultaneously on numerous large projects. Street's fellow assistants were George Frederick Bodley and William White, destined to share with him the artistic leadership of their generation; for them the purist Gothic revival, championed by Augustus Welby Northmore Pugin and the Ecclesiological Society, was rapidly falling into disfavour. Together they worked on the great Nicholaikirche for Hamburg, where Scott dared to use German precedents, and on stark, big-boned churches for Alderney and St John's, Newfoundland, which turned their backs on the soft forms of English Decorated Gothic which were still preferred by Gothic revival purists. It was in Scott's office that the more confident eclecticism and the powerful visual language of High Victorian architecture were born.<h2>
<a name="Earlyworks"></a>Early works</h2>Street played an important role in this swift reshaping of architectural taste. Some of his first independent work, executed in Cornwall while he was still employed by Scott, was conservatively Puginian. For example, the little church of St Peter at Treverbyn, Cornwall, of 1848&#150;50, is gentle and picturesque in composition and faithful to the precedents of English Decorated Gothic. But another early work in Cornwall, St Mary at Biscovey of 1847&#150;8, is Early English in detail and already forthright&#151;almost primitive&#151;in spirit, with details borrowed from heretofore neglected Cornish exemplars. Its freedom and vigour herald High Victorianism.<br>
<br>In 1849 Street established his own practice, first in London and then in Wallingford Street, Wantage, Berkshire, as his early Cornish connections were supplanted by more important ties to the diocese of Oxford. He served as Oxford diocesan architect from 1850 until his death, enjoying the patronage and friendship of Bishop Samuel Wilberforce. On 17 June 1852 Street married Mariquita (Marique) Proctor (<i>d</i>. 1874), and that year moved to Beaumont Street, Oxford; then, having begun to establish a national reputation, he returned to London, renting a house at 33 Montague Place, in 1856. (He maintained his principal residence in London for the rest of his life, moving to 51 Russell Square in 1862 and to a great house at 14 Cavendish Place in 1870.)<br>
<br>Street's designs and writing of the first dozen years of his practice, in Oxford and London, defined the character of High Victorian architecture. In responding to mid-Victorian needs, his work became increasingly secular and urban, and although church-building remained the mainstay of his practice and his own high-church beliefs were unwavering, the religious symbolism that had so fully invested the work of earlier Gothic revivalists now diminished. Moreover, Street rejected the narrow historical and geographical confines within which Pugin and the Ecclesiological Society had bound the Gothic revival. He embraced eclecticism, and he viewed architectural history as an always dynamic system in which elements from different places and periods were transformed by a process of perpetual modernization that he and his contemporaries called &#145;development&#146;, a term he apparently borrowed from contemporary theology.<br>
<br>Street was a strenuous logician who, more effectively than any other architect of his generation, explained the rationale and <i>modus operandi</i> of eclectic design. He first laid out his philosophical position in three seminal articles in <span class="italic">The Ecclesiologist</span> in 1850&#150;53. Later publications reiterated the same themes while supplying a wealth of information about Gothic architecture on the continent, thereby providing the material with which eclecticism could be put into practice. Street travelled widely, traversing France, Germany, and the Low Countries and following the footsteps of John Ruskin to northern Italy&#151;all in the early 1850s. He reported on these travels with lectures and publications. Numerous articles on France and Germany appeared in <span class="italic">The Ecclesiologist</span> in 1854&#150;9, and his influential book on northern Italian Gothic, which reiterated his position on architectural eclecticism and widened the appreciation of Ruskin's views, came out in 1855. A second book, on Spanish Gothic, was published in 1865. Both books were revised for second editions.<br>
<br>Street put his ideas to work in creating scores of quintessentially High Victorian buildings whose vigour and monumentality responded to the visual challenges of the mid-nineteenth-century environment. In his early works in Oxfordshire, such as the Wantage vicarage (1849&#150;50) and the theological college in Cuddesdon (1852&#150;4), the growing energy of his style seems to emerge almost unbidden from the local vernacular. But in later designs and especially after his move to London in 1856, foreign precedents are tellingly employed, including Italian polychromy, muscular French stonework, the Baltic's adroit use of brick. The church and accompanying school, vicarage, and houses of All Saints, Boyne Hill, Berkshire (1854&#150;65), blaze with quasi-Italian colour, and his best-known early work, St James-the-Less, Westminster (1859&#150;61), is a powerful urban church which combines a French apsidal plan and plate tracery, a campanile and polychromy of Italian origin, and a north German sensitivity to the monumental potential of brickwork and the making of space for worship.<h2>
<a name="Majorworks"></a>Major works</h2>In his early use of polychromy Street was only a half step behind William Butterfield, whose church of All Saints, Margaret Street, in London (1849&#150;59), was the first large embodiment of the fashion. But by virtue of his publications and more outgoing personality, Street overshadowed Butterfield and his accomplishments. Moreover, Street's use of colour soon declined, and the power of most of his mature works came from a fondness for the simple and muscular forms of early French Gothic, a taste which he shared with the rather eccentric William Burges, whom, like Butterfield, Street tended to outshine. Street's &#145;Early French&#146; appears in his design for the Lille Cathedral competition of 1855&#150;6 (where it is combined with polychromatic brick). He was placed second in that contest, and he fared similarly in the competition for the Crimean Memorial Church (Constantinople, 1856), in which he entered another Early French proposal. The executed Constantinople church of 1863&#150;8, for which Street ultimately received the commission, is an exceedingly powerful variation on the same theme. Perhaps his masterpiece in this vein is the church of Sts Philip and James, Oxford (1858&#150;65), whose mighty ashlar forms are only barely constrained by the equal might of Street's intelligent eye. Other notable exemplars are the churches of St John the Evangelist, Whitwell on the Hill (North Riding, Yorkshire, 1858&#150;60), St John the Evangelist, Howsham (East Riding, Yorkshire, 1859&#150;60), and All Saints, Denstone (Staffordshire, 1860&#150;62).<br>
<br>In addition to pioneering the bold and characteristic&#151;but ultimately exhausting&#151;vocabulary of High Victorian architecture, Street was also one of the first to test alternatives. All Saints' Church in Brightwalton, Berkshire (1862&#150;3), turns the clock back to the gentle picturesque of the English Middle Pointed, and Street's precociousness in reverting to such forms is underscored by the fact that between 1852 and 1862 he trained or employed three of the leading designers of the new &#145;Queen Anne&#146; generation: Philip Webb, William Morris, and Richard Norman Shaw. The filiation is nowhere more visible than in Shaw's bravura sketching style. Perfectly suited to rendering the gentle picturesque character of his buildings&#151;and coincidentally readily reproduced by the new photolithographic process used by the architectural magazines&#151;Shaw's technique descended directly from Street's.<br>
<br>Street's greatest commission, the Royal Courts of Justice in London, was designed during the time when High Victorian tastes were waning. The competition design of 1866&#150;7 is a last, brilliant effort at High Victorian stylistic synthesis, Early French in its power, but specifically intended to unite&#151;through skilful &#145;development&#146;&#151;the irregular vigour of Gothic with the quasi-classical symmetry and monumentality appropriate for a public building. (Street's contemporary neo-Byzantine entry in the competition for an extension to the National Gallery took the quest for Gothic&#150;classical synthesis even further.) The long series of revised schemes for the law courts increasingly displayed the unabashed picturesque that Shaw and his contemporaries had begun to make fashionable. The final design (1870&#150;82) is a curious mixture of strong, High Victorian detail and irregular, almost relaxed, composition. It was approved in the teeth of Liberal opposition only because Street had won the support of William Ewart Gladstone, the prime minister, himself a high-churchman and Gothic enthusiast.<h2>
<a name="Laterworks"></a>Later works</h2>Other later works reflect more explicitly the desiderata of late Victorian architecture. The High Victorian conviction that art was served by transnational and transtemporal interbreeding had waned, and Street's own home, Holmdale, at Holmbury St Mary (Surrey, 1873&#150;6), is a relatively pure Old English half-timbered manor, with obvious debts to Shaw. Foreign precedents were now treated more circumspectly and usually restricted to special circumstances, notably the very Italian design for St Paul's American Church, Rome (1872&#150;6).<br>
<br>Large projects of great prestige joined the law courts in keeping Street's office fully occupied through the last years of his life. These included the nave and towered west fa&ccedil;ade for Bristol Cathedral (1867&#150;88) and an almost total reconstruction of Christ Church, Dublin (1868&#150;78).<br>
<br>The vastness of these projects did not deter Street from maintaining an unusually high degree of artistic control over all of them, unlike some of his contemporaries. His astonishing rapidity of drawing and his unmatched combination of artistic originality and historical knowledge enabled him to keep ahead of his assistants. Seemingly tireless, Street continued to travel abroad every year, but his morale was sapped by the bureaucratic wranglings necessitated by his larger commissions, especially the Royal Courts of Justice. He was also cruelly injured by the death in 1874 of Marique, his wife of twenty-two years, and his eight-week second marriage, to Jessie Holland (a friend of his first wife), whom he married on 11 January 1876, ended tragically in her death from an illness contracted during their wedding trip to Italy in March that year.<br>
<br>Street received all the honours of his profession. He was elected an associate of the Royal Academy in 1866 and a full member in 1871. In 1874 he was awarded the gold medal of the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA), which he loyally accepted after Ruskin turned it down to chastise architects for their restoration practices, and in 1881, the year of his death, he served both as president of RIBA and as professor of architecture at the Royal Academy. As president of RIBA he stood up for the artists in the dispute that was growing between those who viewed architecture as an art and those who judged it to be a profession, and his Royal Academy lectures were the last to essay the arduous High Victorian task of reconciling the architecture of the middle ages and life of the nineteenth century.<br>
<br>Street died at his home, 14 Cavendish Place, London, on 18 December 1881, after suffering two strokes. His death at the age of fifty-seven was surely hastened by the physical and emotional strain of work, and his greatest commission, the law courts, was opened a year after his death. Street was buried on 29 December in Westminster Abbey, near his old friend and former employer Sir Gilbert Scott, and beneath a brass designed by George Frederick Bodley, with whom he had worked in Scott's office. His only son, Arthur Edmund Street (<i>d</i>. 1938), oversaw the completion of many of his works.<br>
