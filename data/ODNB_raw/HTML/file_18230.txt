<span class="headword">Martineau,  Robert Braithwaite</span>  (1826&#150;1869), <span class="occ">genre and portrait painter</span>, was born on 19 January 1826 in Guilford Street, London, the fifth son of eight children of Philip Martineau (1791&#150;1860), solicitor and taxing master to the court of chancery, and his wife, Elizabeth Frances (<i>d</i>. 1875), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1720/', "Dr Robert Batty")</script> of Fairlight Lodge, Hastings. The family was descended from Gaston Martineau, a French Huguenot refugee and surgeon, who fled to England following the revocation of the edict of Nantes in 1685, settling in Norwich. Martineau's mother was an accomplished watercolour painter; several volumes describing her European travels with her brother were published, illustrated with engravings from their sketches.<br>
<br>Martineau was educated at University College School, London, and followed his two older brothers into the law. He was articled to a firm of solicitors from 1842 to 1846 but decided to pursue an artistic career. He studied first at Cary's drawing school, and in 1848, at the age of twenty-two, entered the Royal Academy Schools, where he was awarded a silver medal for drawing. About 1851 he asked William Holman Hunt, a member of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, if he could become his pupil. Hunt agreed, after warning him of the difficulties of making a living from art and being assured that: &#145;To him [Martineau] the lucrativeness of the pursuit was not at first a vital question, which removed the scruples I had against anyone native born needing to live by his profession from becoming a painter in this country&#146;  (Hunt, 1.301&#150;2). It is clear that Martineau had a sufficient private income to support himself, and only when he married at the age of thirty-nine did he need to earn a living from his art. His wife, whom he married in 1865, was Maria (<i>b</i>. 1840), eldest daughter of Henry Wheeler of Bolingbroke House, Wandsworth, London. They had three children, the youngest of whom, Helen (1868&#150;1950), was the author of several articles on her father's work, and bequeathed most of the works in her possession to public collections on her death.<br>
<br>In 1852 Martineau exhibited for the first time at the Royal Academy, showing an illustration of a scene from Charles Dickens's <span class="italic">The Old Curiosity Shop</span> entitled <span class="italic">Kit's Writing Lesson</span> (Tate collection), painted in Holman Hunt's studio. Martineau exhibited ten further works at the Royal Academy before his early death in 1869. These works included illustrations from literature such as <span class="italic">Katherine and Petruchio</span> (exh. RA, 1855; Ashmolean Museum, Oxford) from Shakespeare's <span class="italic">The Taming of the Shrew</span>, and <span class="italic">Picciola</span> (exh. RA, 1856; Tate collection) from Saintine's novel of 1837; genre scenes such as <span class="italic">The Last Chapter</span> (exh. RA, 1863; City of Birmingham Art Gallery), showing a young woman finishing her novel by firelight, and <span class="italic">The Allies</span> (exh. RA, 1861; Johannesburg Art Gallery); and portraits such as <span class="italic">Bertie, Son of Hubert Martineau</span>, the artist's nephew (exh. RA, 1867; priv. coll.) and <span class="italic">Portrait of Master Toke</span> (exh. RA, 1862).<br>
<br>However, the work for which Martineau is best-known is <span class="italic">The Last Day in the Old Home</span> (Tate collection) which was shown in the British picture galleries at the International Exhibition in South Kensington in 1862. These galleries were arranged as a major retrospective of British art from the time of Hogarth and <span class="italic">The Last Day in the Old Home</span> was, according to the artist William Bell Scott, one of the two &#145;most popular of all the thousands of works &hellip; shown in the International Exhibition&#146;  (Minto, 2.48)&#151;the other was Ford Madox Brown's <span class="italic">The Last of England</span>. Its subject, an old and titled family brought to financial ruin by the gambling habits of the husband, was hugely popular with Victorian audiences who loved piecing together the narrative from the ample visual clues in such &#145;incident pictures&#146;.<br>
<br>Martineau and Holman Hunt remained close friends, sometimes sharing studios or lodgings. Martineau was part of a lively artistic circle which included Hunt, Dante Gabriel Rossetti, Arthur Hughes, George Price Boyce, Edward Burne-Jones (whose wife, Georgiana, credits him with advising them that the Grange in Fulham, the Burne-Jones' home for thirty years, was available to let), Ford Madox Brown (Martineau modelled for the gentleman on horseback in Brown's <span class="italic">Work</span>), and Val Prinsep. He regularly attended the artistic and social gatherings at the Prinseps' home, Little Holland House in Kensington, as well as at Rossetti's house in Chelsea. William Michael Rossetti described him as &#145;a very sensible person, not given to much talk, and with a mind rather steady going than lively, highly trusty and well principled, and worthy of the utmost regard&#146;  (Rossetti, <span class="italic">Reminiscences</span>, 2.158), and in a private letter he was described as a man &#145;of whom nothing but good is thought and said by all who know him&#146;  (A. J. Lewis to A. Wheeler, 13 Sept 1864, priv. coll.). He was a founder member and treasurer of the short-lived Hogarth Club (1858&#150;61), where <span class="italic">The Last Day in the Old Home</span> was shown privately before the International Exhibition, and a member of the Cosmopolitan Club on Charles Street, where an exhibition of his paintings and drawings was held shortly after his death in 1869. In addition to his talents as a painter, he had a natural gift for music and composed several small studies. He also had a wonderful sense of humour and fun, as is evident from his private correspondence.<br>
<br>Martineau's pictures were purchased by some of the foremost patrons of the day, including James Leathart, Thomas Fairbairn, and Kirkman Hodgson. He was working on a large canvas, <span class="italic">Christians and Christians</span> (Walker Art Gallery, Liverpool), possibly for Fairbairn, at the time of his early death. Martineau died at Lancaster Lodge, Campden Hill, London, on 13 February 1869 from heart disease brought on by earlier bouts of rheumatic fever. He was buried in Kensal Green cemetery. <br>
<br>Appreciation of Martineau's work has fallen and risen with the popularity of Victorian painting. <span class="italic">The Last Day in the Old Home</span>, so universally popular in 1862 that, according to an article in 1899, it &#145;made a triumphant progress through the country after the close of the Great Exhibition&#146;  (<span class="italic">Cornhill Magazine</span>, 6 Jan&#150;June 1899, 183), was by 1951 described as &#145;no more than a painstaking inventory of a Victorian drawing room&#146;  (C. A. Bertram, <span class="italic">A Century of British Painting</span>, 1951, 35). In the 1990s this painting is again appreciated for the insights it gives into Victorian social values, and the realistic manner in which it is painted.<br>
