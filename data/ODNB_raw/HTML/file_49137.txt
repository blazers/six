<span class="headword">Glyde <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em>Glide]</span>,  John</span>  (1823&#150;1905), <span class="occ">social commentator and antiquary</span>, was born at 9 Eagle Street, Ipswich, in December 1823, the second son of John Glide (1800/01&#150;1880), a hairdresser, and his wife, Mary (1793/4&#150;1844). Glide first worked in his father's shop, and entertained the customers by retailing the contents of the newspapers, of which he was an avid reader. At fifteen he joined the Ipswich Mechanics' Institute, and at eighteen won a prize for an essay on social conditions in Ipswich. In 1843 he spent a year in London, and on his return opened a hairdresser's shop at 35 St Matthew's Street, Ipswich, changing the spelling of his name to Glyde. He was still described as a hairdresser in White's <span class="italic">Directory of Suffolk</span> in 1855, though by that time he had largely abandoned the trade in favour of a bookshop, a circulating library, and a domestic agency. He was also a busy author.<br>
<br>In the intervening years Glyde had been active in radical politics. He was the secretary and a pamphleteer of an Owenite group in 1841, and corresponded with John Goodwyn Barmby, the Christian socialist. He was then close to the Ipswich Chartists, and joined their Utilitarian Society when he returned from London in 1844, but he was a Unitarian, and had attended William Johnson Fox's chapel in Finsbury. By the end of the decade he had become a moderate Liberal, critical of Chartist beliefs and concerning himself increasingly with practical social reform. At the same time he was expanding his prize-winning essay into an enterprising study, which he published in 1850 as <span class="italic">The Moral, Social, and Religious Condition of Ipswich in the Middle of the Nineteenth Century</span>.<br>
<br>The work opens conventionally with a historical sketch, but then turns to discuss the contemporary town. An account of trade is followed by chapters on sanitary conditions, poverty, education, intellectual life, and religious observance. As far as he could Glyde illuminated local and national statistics with his own careful observation. His object was to record, but with a didactic purpose. He hoped for social and economic amelioration through education, but also through improvements in the physical environment. He reprobated drunkenness and the ill effects of sensational literature, but he saw crime as a product of social dislocation, and the spread of literacy as a desirable end in itself. At large he combined precept with practical action, campaigning for improvements in the water supply, for the closure of the town's churchyards for further burials and the establishment of a cemetery, and for the effective direction of philanthropic work. In 1866 he promoted a district nursing association, which foundered on sectarianism, and in 1868 worked for Foster Barham Zincke's National Educational League.<br>
<br>In examining the churches and their congregations Glyde anticipated the inquiries into religious observance in the census of 1851. In the following years he expanded his book into a general survey of the county, published in 1856 as <span class="italic">Suffolk in the Nineteenth Century: Physical, Social, Moral, Religious, and Industrial</span>. That work was said to have prompted the registrar-general to appoint him registrar of marriages in Ipswich, a post which he held until his death. His local standing was also enhanced by a series of studies of the clergy, entitled &#145;The Ipswich pulpit&#146;, which appeared in the <span class="italic">Suffolk Chronicle</span> in 1857, and were followed by a larger biographical collection published as <span class="italic">Suffolk Worthies</span> in 1858. Glyde's later works included <span class="italic">The Autobiography of a Suffolk Labourer</span> (1894), a sympathetic composite portrait compiled from a wide range of material, and antiquarian and literary studies. In 1897 he argued that the best memorial to Queen Victoria's jubilee would be a free public library, and subsequently left a bequest of &pound;500 to buy books for the reference collection.<br>
<br>Glyde was twice married; first, on 4 March 1849, to Eliza Taylor (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1829), daughter of Robert Taylor, a builder, and the second time, in or about 1860, to Mary (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1840), a stationer's assistant (her surname is unknown), who outlived him. Both marriages seem to have been childless. He died on 14 June 1905 at his home, 22 St Nicholas Street, Ipswich, and was buried in Ipswich cemetery on 17 June.<br>
<br>Glyde invites comparison with the Colchester radical William Wire (<i>d</i>. 1857). Both had little schooling, but both developed distinctive intellectual tastes. Wire made an important contribution to archaeological studies in Essex, but laboured under a heavier burden of social disapproval than Glyde. Glyde, longer-lived, equally pertinacious but more adroit, gained social esteem in a no less conservative town, and promoted some useful changes. The originality of his interests may have helped him; they still stand to his credit.<br>
