<span class="headword">Long,  Thomas</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1621, <em>d.</em> 1707), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, was the son of Richard Long of Exeter and was baptized at St Lawrence's Church there on 14 December 1621. Thomas matriculated servitor at Exeter College, Oxford, on 5 April 1639. He graduated BA in 1642, but left soon afterwards because of the turmoil in Oxford due to the civil war. He must have married by 1648 or 1649, when his eldest son Thomas was born, but we do not know the name of his wife (or wives).<br>
<br>Long became vicar of Clyst St Lawrence, near Exeter, in 1652. In April 1684 Bishop Lamplugh of Exeter claimed in a letter to Archbishop Sancroft that Long was sequestered during the interregnum because of his loyalties and churchmanship: Long &#145;lay under a long Sequestration &amp; yet held up against all interests, but the kings &amp; the churchs, which he constantly asserted both by preaching &amp; printing against the ringleaders of the Rebellion&#146;  (<span class="italic">Walker rev.</span>, 118). However, whether Long actually was sequestered is questionable; John Walker, who knew Long well, and Long was indeed the &#145;ancient clergyman&#146; who inspired him to write his account of the sufferings of the loyalist and Anglican clergy, fails to mention any such sequestration  (ibid., v). A book published by Long in 1658 does not answer the question directly, but clearly shows his sense of persecution and alienation. He implied that the puritan authorities&#151;&#145;those who are named by the name of Christ&#146;&#151;were committing &#145;iniquities&#146; just as were the &#145;enemies of Jerusalem&#146;. That these &#145;veterane Souldiers, and houshold-servants, who yet remain in his Tents, should conspire with his enemies to betray his fortresses, cast away their armes, and desert his cause, is of very sad consideration&#146;  (T. Long, <span class="italic">An excercitation Concerning the Frequent Use of our Lords Prayer in the Publick Worship of God. And a View of what hath been Said by Dr. Owen Concerning that Subject</span>, London, 1658, preface). In a letter of 1703 Long claimed that the number of ejected Anglican priests during the interregnum was much higher than Edmund Calamy's estimate&#151;perhaps as high as 10,000. All this, plus Long's later vitriolic attacks on dissent, suggest that, even if he was not sequestered, he certainly carried a grudge because of his treatment during the interregnum.<br>
<br>Long was created BD by royal mandate at the Restoration and was created prebendary of Exeter Cathedral on 18 January 1661. He was a prolific writer, and in this period was best known for his bitter pamphlet wars against dissenters, particularly against the presbyterians. In <span class="italic">Calvinus redivivus</span> (London, 1673) he argued that Calvin &#145;sets himself in the breach that is made, to prevent any farther separation, and to recall those that are departed to their former Communion&#146;  (Long, <span class="italic">Calvinus</span>, epistle). He went on to quote the reformer on his views of &#145;Anabaptists&#146; and &#145;Libertines&#146;, and applied these comments to dissenters. This did not mean that Calvin would agree with Anglicans on all things: &#145;I know he differs in some things from us; but in many more from our Adversaries&#146;  (Long, <span class="italic">Calvinus</span>, 14). The interregnum&#151;and very likely his own experience during the interregnum&#151;was always in his mind when he wrote these tracts. In <span class="italic">No Protestant but the Dissenters Plot</span> (London, 1682) he maintained that dissenters had persecuted Anglicans far more in the 1650s than vice versa during the Restoration. Dissenters, moreover, would go to any length to destroy the Church of England: &#145;By which we see, that the help of any Party, Anabaptists or Papists, are acceptable to the Dissenters, when there is any probability of afflicting or destroying the established Church&#146;  (Long, <span class="italic">No Protestant</span>, 11). He often lumped dissenting and papist plots together, and made an attempt at cataloguing their long, nefarious business in <span class="italic">History of all the popish and fanatical plots and conspiracies against the established government &hellip; from the first year of Queen Elizabeth's reign to this present year 1684</span> (London, 1684). Long's greatest target among the presbyterians was Richard Baxter, against whom he wrote a great deal. Wood observed that he had &#145;undergone that very toilsome drudgrey of reading many or most of Mr. Richard Baxter's Books, and hath published Reflections and Animadversions on several of them&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 2.951). Baxter took umbrage at Long's 1678 book, <span class="italic">Mr. Hales's Treatise of Schism Examined and Censured</span> (London, 1678), in which he accused nonconformists of being &#145;schismaticks&#146;. Baxter replied to Long in a letter in which, with biting sarcasm, he said that he understood &#145;by your Book that you think that you are in the Right; which is the most that I have yet learned out of it, unless it be also that you think the Nonconformists be not yet hated and afflicted enough&#146;  (Keeble and Nuttall, 2.197&#150;8). The attacks and recriminations between Long and Baxter continued until Baxter's death. In fact, Long was determined to have the last say, so after Baxter died he penned a <span class="italic">Review of Mr. Richard Baxter's life, wherein many mistakes are rectified, some false relations detected, [and] some omissions supplyed</span> (London, 1697). When Edmund Calamy took over Baxter's <span class="italic">Reliquiae</span> project, he inherited the battle with Long as well. Long sparred with him as he did with Baxter (<span class="italic">A Rebuke to Mr. Edmund Calamy, Author of the Abridgment of Mr. Baxter's Life</span>, Exeter, 1704).<br>
<br>Archbishop Sancroft offered Long the bishopric of Bristol in 1684, but he declined that poor diocese because of his age and the size of his family. Long also served as proctor for convocation in 1689, 1693, and 1694. Numerous sources report that he refused the oaths in 1689, but this is clearly not the case and seems to have arisen from confusion with his son, <a href="#cosubject_16978">Thomas [<i>see below</i>]</a>, who also had a prebend at Exeter. Long was, it is true, a staunch advocate of passive obedience, but in <span class="italic">Reflections upon a Late Book, Entituled &#145;The Case of Allegiance Consider'd&#146;</span> (London, 1689), he argued that it was lawful to take the oaths of allegiance to William and Mary, who &#145;had a right Title to the Succession of the Crown of England&#146;. James had clearly abdicated, since he<blockquote>deserted first the Government, and then the Land, and fled to an inveterate Enemy of our Religion and Nation, &hellip; and leaving us under a standing Army, wherein was a considerable party of Irish Papists, who &hellip; were likely to be very injurious to the English subjects. (Long, <span class="italic">Reflections</span>, 5&#150;6)</blockquote>Long maintained, however, that the best security that English subjects could give to the present government was to hold fast to the doctrines of non-resistance and passive obedience.<br>
<br>Long had a reputation for erudition. He published sermons, works critical of heterodoxy (<span class="italic">Answer to a Socinian Treatise called &#145;The Naked Gospel&#146;</span>, London, 1691) and Lockean toleration (<span class="italic">The Letter for Toleration Decyphered</span>, London, 1689), books against alteration of the liturgy of the Church of England (<span class="italic">Vox cleri, or, The sense of the clergy, concerning the making of alterations in the established liturgy</span>, London, 1690), and a defence of Charles I's authorship of <span class="italic">Eikon basilike</span>.<br>
<br>Though he resigned his prebend in 1701, Long apparently remained at Clyst St Lawrence, though by the time he made his will, on 4 June 1706, he appears to have given up the living, as he merely described himself as a clerk of Exeter. The will, proved on 8 October 1708, lists eight children as survivors: Joseph, Nicholas, Thomas (who died not long after the will was made), John, Richard, Elizabeth, Dorothy, and Susanna. Long died on 7 December 1707 and was buried four days later in the parish where he had been baptized, St Lawrence, Exeter.<br>
<br>Long's son, also <a name="cosubject_16978"></a><span class="headword">Thomas Long</span>  (1648/9&#150;1707), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, also attended Exeter College, Oxford, where he matriculated, aged fifteen, on 1 April 1664, but graduated from Corpus Christi College, Oxford, in February 1668 and proceeded MA in 1671. He was rector of Whimple, Devon, from 1676. After 1679 he served as chaplain to Anthony Sparrow, bishop of Norwich (and previously bishop of Exeter) whose daughter Bridget Sparrow (<i>d</i>. 1712) he had married on 15 August 1676. He became a prebendary of Exeter in 1681. Long lost living and prebend in 1689 when he became a nonjuror. He died in Exeter in 1707, and was buried in St Lawrence's on 28 July, less than five months before his father, and five years before his widow.<br>
