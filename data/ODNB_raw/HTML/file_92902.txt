<span class="headword">Burke,  Patricia Rosa Moore</span>  (1916&#150;2003), <span class="occ">actress</span>, was born at via Castelmorone 5, Milan, Italy, on 23 March 1916, the daughter of an operatic tenor known as &#145;the Lancashire Caruso&#146;, Thomas Aspinall Burke (1890&#150;1969), and his wife, Marie Rosa, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Holt, formerly Altfuldisch, the actress Marie Burke (1894&#150;1988), whose distinguished career included a starring role in <span class="italic">Show Boat</span>. Privately trained, Burke began her career in her teens, stage-managing at the Q Theatre; she acted in French at the nursery of the avant-garde, Grein's Independent Theatre, and understudied in Shakespeare at Regent's Park. At the age of sixteen, she appeared in the most sophisticated musical of the 1930s, Cole Porter's <span class="italic">Nymph Errant</span> at the Adelphi Theatre in 1933, and was spotted by C. B. Cochran. She created the title role in the Chinese fable <span class="italic">Lady Precious Stream</span> at the Savoy Theatre in 1936, and worked with major playwrights of the inter-war years, including J. B. Priestley and Lesley Storm. Meanwhile her revue career flourished in vehicles for stars as diverse as Beatrice Lillie and Flanagan and Allen. She also began her love affair with pantomime in this era of long runs and de luxe productions in major venues: she tried everything from the &#145;goody-goody&#146; heroine in <span class="italic">Dick Whittington</span> to a final turn in 1971 as the battleaxe Queen in <span class="italic">Alice</span>, but excelled as principal boy, where she could exploit her lyric soprano and her athleticism (she played several sports), offering the audience a swashbuckling, attractive Prince Charming or Robin Hood.<br>
<br>On 14 March 1938 Burke married Michael William Kimpton, a 26-year-old flying instructor, and son of Charles William Kimpton, stationer's manager. There were no children of the marriage. During the Second World War she worked for the Entertainments National Service Association (ENSA), touring Burma, Italy, and the Middle East, despite essentially pacifist convictions. Basil Dean recalled her at an Indian football ground where her mother joined her for a concert before Lord Louis Mountbatten and 5000 troops. She played to the Eighth Army in Naples on HMS <i>Orion</i>, developing a double act with Gabrielle Brune that Dean considered &#145;riotous&#146;. They gave a dozen daily concerts and sing-songs for the wounded. Her first real triumph also came during the war, in 1943, with the long-running musical <span class="italic">The Lisbon Story</span>, playing a French ballerina who collaborates with the Nazis to free an imprisoned scientist, a role reprised in 1946 for the movie with Richard Tauber. It was conceived in broad, sentimental strokes, and gave her a strong curtain as the ballerina went singing to execution.<br>
<br>Burke's post-war career began with light comedy&#151;<span class="italic">Stage Door</span>, an American import, and <span class="italic">Clutterbuck</span> with the archetypal Englishman Naunton Wayne. She also made some frothy movies, including in 1946 <span class="italic">The Trojan Brothers</span> (playing a socialite stalked by the back end of a pantomime horse). She then joined the Old Vic&#151;already seen as the likely National Theatre&#151;in 1947 to play Katharina in <span class="italic">The Taming of the Shrew</span> at the first ever Edinburgh Festival and later at the New Vic. John Burrell's <span class="italic">Shrew</span> was a rare revival of a play then read as farce. He valued lightness and speed: one review likened his <span class="italic">Shrew</span> to a Crazy Gang show. Burke and her co-star Trevor Howard emphasized passion over slapstick. Howard's Petruchio slung Burke across his shoulders or held her upside down, but the force that drove this couple was desire; photographs show a fiery, active Burke with a fleeting melancholy. The critics were unanimous in praise.<br>
<br>The Vic did not fully explore Burke's talents. She took over from another actress as Doll Common in Burrell's lively production of Ben Jonson's <span class="italic">The Alchemist</span>; in Shaw's <span class="italic">St Joan</span> she had a single, albeit funny, line. The following year she played Rosalind in <span class="italic">As You Like It</span> at Worthing, praised for a magic forged in her principal boy roles. In the 1950s she worked with Tyrone Guthrie at the Edinburgh Festival and enjoyed solid opportunities with <span class="italic">Trilby</span> (Bedford Theatre, 1950), <span class="italic">Mrs Dot</span> (Arts Theatre, 1951), and <span class="italic">Trelawny of the Wells</span> (Lyric, Hammersmith, 1952). She returned to revue as the lead in <span class="italic">Cockles and Champagne</span> (Saville Theatre, 1954) and to musicals with <span class="italic">Romance and Candlelight</span> (Piccadilly, 1955). Meanwhile her wit made her popular on radio and television quiz programmes. By now the British theatre was changing and Burke's intelligence claimed a share of challenging work. She played three times at the Royal Court Theatre: as Adriana in <span class="italic">The Comedy of Errors</span> (1952); the sporty Lampito in the money-spinner <span class="italic">Lysistrata</span> (1957); and as Kit in Shelagh Delaney's <span class="italic">The Lion in Love</span> (1960). The play's unfocused naturalism disappointed the critics, although Burke's market trader Kit, boozy, exuberant, and aggressive, was admired.<br>
<br>Royal Court actors of the 1960s were at the forefront of unilateralism, and Burke's pacifism led her to prominence in the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament; she and John Osborne were arrested in 1961. There were no more Royal Court roles; she worked in light comedies such as <span class="italic">The Amorous Prawn</span> (1963) and played the title role in <span class="italic">The Killing of Sister George</span> at Watford before joining in 1968 the long-running but lightweight musical <span class="italic">Charlie Girl</span> at the Adelphi, in which she danced the Charleston. Her movie career continued, though her only notable film was the Boulting brothers' <span class="italic">Soft Beds, Hard Battles</span> (1973) starring Peter Sellers, in which she played a nun. In the 1970s she retired to become a literary agent, still a lively if underrated presence in British theatre. Her first marriage having ended in divorce, she married Group Captain Duncan C. MacDonald, a test pilot; they had a son and a daughter. After a second divorce she married, on 16 May 1980, John Collingwood, otherwise John Collingwood-Whittick, a mechanical engineer, and son of Thomas Stephen Collingwood, mechanical engineer. She died in Draguignan, France, on 23 November 2003, and was survived by her husband, John, and the son and daughter of her second marriage.<br>
