<span class="headword">Walker, Sir  Hovenden</span>  (1666?&#150;1725), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, was the second son of Colonel William Walker of Tankardstown, Queen's county, Ireland, and Elizabeth, daughter of the physician <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5067/', "Peter Chamberlen (1601&#150;1683)")</script>. There is some doubt over his date of birth, some sources giving 1656 and others 1666: the latter is more likely, as in June 1678 he was admitted to Trinity College, Dublin, though he never completed his degree. In April 1686 he was at Nevis, where he volunteered to join the <i>Dartmouth</i> for the pursuit of a Spanish pirate. His account of the voyage found its way into Samuel Pepys's papers, and he subsequently visited Boston in the <i>Dartmouth</i>, where he entertained the crew with an anti-Spanish poem of his own composition. He was appointed second lieutenant of the <i>Saint David</i> on 30 October 1688, and obtained post rank as captain of the fireship <i>Vulture</i> on 17 February 1692.<br>
<br>In the <i>Vulture</i> Walker was present at the battle of Barfleur, but had no actual share in it, nor in the destruction of the French ships at La Hogue. He was shortly afterwards appointed to the <i>Sapphire</i> on the Irish station, and in 1694 to the armed ship <i>Friends' Adventure</i>. In 1695 he commanded the <i>Foresight</i> (50 guns), in which, when off the Lizard, in charge of a convoy, and with the <i>Sheerness</i> in company, he fought a gallant action with two French ships of 60 and 70 guns, on 29 April 1696, and beat them off. In January 1697 he was appointed to the <i>Kent</i>, in June to the <i>Content Prize</i>, in September to the <i>Royal Oak</i>, and in February 1698 to the <i>Boyne</i> as flag-captain to Vice-Admiral Matthew Aylmer, going to the Mediterranean as commander-in-chief. On the return of the <i>Boyne</i> to England in November 1699 the ship was ordered to pay off, and Walker asked for leave of absence to go to Ireland, where, he explained, he had a case pending in the court of chancery, in which his interests were involved to the extent of &pound;1000. As the Admiralty refused him leave until the ship was safe in Hamoaze and her powder discharged, he begged to &#145;lay down&#146; the command.<br>
<br>In December 1701 Walker was appointed to the <i>Burford</i>, one of the fleet off Cadiz under Sir George Rooke in 1702; and afterwards of a squadron detached to the West Indies with Walker as commodore. After calling at the Cape Verde Islands and at Barbados he arrived at Antigua in the middle of February, and was desired by Colonel Christopher Codrington to co-operate in an attack on Guadeloupe. The first part of the co-operation was to provide the land forces with ammunition, which was done by making up cartridges with large-grained cannon powder and bullets taken from the case-shot. There were no flints, mortars, bombs, pickaxes, spades, and such like, necessary for a siege. The ships took the men over to Guadeloupe, put them safely on shore, cleared the enemy out of such batteries as were within reach of the sea, and kept open the communications. When the French, driven out of the towns and forts, were permitted to retire to the mountains, the English were incapable of pursuing them, and finally withdrew after destroying the town, forts, and plantations. At the end of May the squadron returned to Nevis, where, a few weeks later, it was joined by Vice-Admiral John Graydon, with whom it went to Jamaica, and later on to Newfoundland and England.<br>
<br>From 1705 to 1707 Walker commanded the <i>Cumberland</i>, in which, in the summer of 1706, he took out a reinforcement to Sir John Leake in the Mediterranean, and took part in the relief of Barcelona. In December 1707 he was appointed to the <i>Royal Oak</i>, in January 1708 to the <i>Ramillies</i>, and in June, under a recent order in council (18 January), to be captain resident at Plymouth, to superintend and hasten the work of the port, and to be commander-in-chief in the absence of a flag-officer. On 15 March 1711 he was promoted rear-admiral of the white. About the same time he was knighted, and on 3 April he was appointed commander-in-chief &#145;of a secret expedition&#146;, with an order to wear the union flag at the main when clear of the channel. The &#145;expedition&#146; intended against Quebec&#151;consisting of ten ships of the line, with several smaller vessels and some thirty transports, carrying upwards of 5000 soldiers, commanded by Brigadier-General John Hill&#151;sailed from Plymouth in the beginning of May, and arrived in New England on 24 June. The supplies and reinforcements which were expected to be waiting for it were not ready, and the fleet did not sail for the St Lawrence until 30 July. As they entered the river it began to blow hard, and on 21 August a dense fog and an easterly gale compelled them, on the advice of the pilots, to lie to for the night. By the next morning they had drifted on to the north shore, among rocks and islands, where eight transports were cast away with the loss of nearly 900 men, and the rest of the fleet was saved with the greatest difficulty.<br>
<br>The storms continued, and the locally recruited pilots were unanimous in stating the fleet could not reach Quebec. In any case the ships were short of provisions, a consequence of the earl of Oxford's policy of keeping the expedition's purpose as secret as possible even from the Admiralty&#151;and, indeed, from Walker himself. A council of war was of the opinion that, with only ten weeks' provisions on short allowance, nothing could be done but to return to England as soon as possible. They arrived at St Helen's on 9 October, and not long afterwards, Walker's flagship, the <i>Edgar</i> (70 guns), blew up while at anchor at Spithead. When the <i>Edgar</i> blew up Walker was on shore; but&#151;among other things&#151;all his papers were still on the ship and were lost, a circumstance which afterwards caused him much trouble. On 14 March 1712 he was appointed commander-in-chief at Jamaica, where he quarrelled with the governor, and sailed finally from Plymouth on 30 April with the small squadron and a convoy of 100 merchant ships. The command was uneventful, and is important mainly in showing that nothing in the conduct of the expedition to the St Lawrence was considered by the Admiralty prejudicial to Walker's character as an officer. On the peace he was ordered to England, and arrived off Dover on 26 May 1713.<br>
<br>Walker retired to Somersham, his country estate near St Ives in Huntingdonshire, where he was a JP. In March 1715 he was ordered to send a justification of his conduct at Quebec to the Admiralty, but the loss of his papers in the <i>Edgar</i> delayed him. He had not responded when he learned in April that his half pay had been stopped and he had been removed from the flag-officers' list, almost certainly more because of his closeness to the tories, and especially to Viscount Bolingbroke, than because of genuine misconduct in Canada. Thereafter Walker left England for a plantation in South Carolina: in 1719 he attempted to justify his departure to the Admiralty, arguing that &#145;being struck out of half pay &hellip; I looked upon myself at liberty, in order to provide for myself &hellip; [being] a drowning man, catching in haste at any twig to save himself&#146;. In the same letter he referred to himself living in Carolina on &#145;Indian corn, and potatoes (because I could not afford to buy plumb cake in London)&#146;, and to his part of Carolina as &#145;the most poor and beggarly settlement in that new discovered world&#146;  (TNA: PRO, ADM 1/577, Walker to Admiralty, 11 Sept 1719). Shortly afterwards he published <span class="italic">A Journal, or Full Account of the Late Expedition to Canada</span> (1720), an attempt at self-justification which actually betrayed the writer's <i>na&iuml;vet&eacute;</i> and mediocrity as a commander. Walker was back in England by 1722, soliciting for his half pay and even for the post of controller of the navy, and two months before his death he even applied audaciously for back pay from his 1702 command.<br>
<br>By the mid-1720s Walker had moved to Germany where he was well acquainted with Thomas Lediard in Hamburg and Hanover. &#145;I found him&#146;, wrote Lediard, &#145;a gentleman of letters, good understanding, ready wit, and agreeable conversation; and withal the most abstemious man living; for I never saw or heard that he drank anything but water, or eat anything but vegetables&#146;  (Lediard, 855). He was twice married: first to Jane Pudsey and second to Margaret Jefferson, who survived him and with whom he had one daughter, Margaret (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1777). Walker died in Dublin, of apoplexy, on 24 December 1725.<br>
