<span class="headword">Ghose, Aurobindo</span> <span class="st"> [<em>known as </em>Sri Aurobindo]</span>  (1872&#150;1950), <span class="occ">politician and spiritual leader in India</span>, was born at 14 South Circular Road, Calcutta, on 15 August 1872, the third son of Krishna Dhan Ghose (1844&#150;1892/3), a civil medical officer, and Swarnalata Bose or Basu (<i>b</i>. 1852). He spent his first five years in Rangpur, Bengal. Their Anglophile father did not allow Aurobindo and his brothers to learn Bengali, and in 1877 sent them to a convent school in Darjeeling. Wishing one or more of them to enter the Indian Civil Service, Dr Ghose took his family to England in 1879 and left the boys in the charge of William Drewett, a Manchester clergyman. Swarnalotta, who gave birth to a fourth son, Barindrakumar, near London in 1880 (a daughter had been born in 1877), did not rejoin her husband on her return to India. Subject from 1873 to serious emotional disturbances, she soon lapsed into incurable psychosis. In Manchester Aurobindo was educated by Drewett and his wife. He won a foundation scholarship to St Paul's School, London, in 1884, a senior classical scholarship to King's College, Cambridge, in 1889, and passed the Indian Civil Service entrance examination in 1890. Two years later he was awarded a first class in the classical tripos, and passed the Indian Civil Service final, but feeling no call to the civil service, failed to attend the riding test and was rejected.<br>
<br>Aurobindo returned to India in 1893, on obtaining a post in the service of the maharaja of Baroda. He worked in Baroda for thirteen years, in various administrative departments, as the maharaja's unofficial private secretary, and as a professor in the state's college. During these years he perfected his Sanskrit and Bengali, read voraciously in many languages, and wrote much poetry and prose in English. In 1901 he married a fourteen-year-old girl, Mrinalini Bose (1887&#150;1918), in Calcutta. They spent little time together and had no children.<br>
<br>Aurobindo had been opposed to the British government of India since his schooldays, but had no time for the moderate politics of the Indian National Congress. Six months after his return he began a series of articles condemning the Congress's tactics, and hinting that real political change could only come about through revolution. About 1900 he and his friends began organizing secret societies in Bengal and western India, with the idea of preparing the country for a general uprising. They made little progress until, in 1905, the British partition of the Bengal presidency for political and administrative reasons created conditions conducive to radical politics and revolutionary terrorism. Quitting his job in Baroda, Aurobindo went to Calcutta, working first as principal of the National College, and later as editor of the influential English-language daily <span class="italic">Bande Mataram</span> (1906&#150;8). Meanwhile a secret society, inspired by him but led by his brother Barindrakumar, began planning terrorist acts. Aurobindo was prosecuted for sedition in 1907 and acquitted. The next year he, Barindrakumar, and others were arrested in the wake of an unsuccessful attempt to assassinate a British judge. After a year-long trial, Aurobindo was acquitted for lack of evidence. He rejoined the national movement, speaking widely and editing the political and cultural journal <span class="italic">Karmayogin</span> (1909&#150;10). In February 1910, warned of a planned sedition prosecution, he left Calcutta for the nearby French enclave of Chandernagore, and in April sailed for Pondicherry, the capital of French India.<br>
<br>In Pondicherry Aurobindo devoted himself to writing and to the practice of yoga, which he had taken up five years earlier. Now convinced that lasting social change could only come about by an individual and collective change of consciousness, he sought to put himself in contact with the &#145;supermind&#146;&#151;&#145;the truth of that which we call God&#146;  (Sri Aurobindo, <span class="italic">The Life Divine</span>, 132)&#151;and to make it an effective power on earth. Between 1914 and 1921 he developed his philosophy in his new monthly review, <span class="italic">Arya</span>. Grounded in Indian scriptural tradition&#151;which he interpreted in <span class="italic">Isha Upanishad</span> (1920), <span class="italic">Essays on the Gita</span> (1922), and <span class="italic">The Secret of the Veda</span> (1956)&#151;and influenced by European evolutionary theory, it unites an Indian recognition of the primacy of the divine with a Western concern for this-worldly perfection. In 1920 Aurobindo was joined by Mirra Alfassa (1878&#150;1973), a Frenchwoman of Levantine Jewish extraction, whom he recognized as his spiritual equal and gave the name the Mother. In 1926 he retired from public view, placing the Mother in charge of the ashram (spiritual community) that had grown up around him. During the 1930s and 1940s he carried on an enormous correspondence (published in 1970 as <span class="italic">Letters on Yoga</span>), and revised his <span class="italic">Arya</span> works for book publication. <span class="italic">The Life Divine</span> (1939&#150;40) was followed by <span class="italic">The Synthesis of Yoga</span> (1948), <span class="italic">The Human Cycle</span> (1949), <span class="italic">The Ideal of Human Unity</span> (1950), and <span class="italic">The Future Poetry</span> (1953). He also worked on his chief poetical production, the epic <span class="italic">Savitri</span> (1950&#150;51). Suffering from an enlarged prostate, he developed uraemia in 1950, refused major treatment, and died at his ashram, 9 rue de la Marine, Pondicherry, on 5 December 1950. Four days later his body was placed in a vault (samadhi) in the courtyard of the ashram, his passing mourned by thousands of followers.<br>
<br>Fifty years later, Sri Aurobindo's influence is greater than it was during his lifetime. The Sri Aurobindo ashram is a flourishing community of 2000, with its own farms, cottage industries, schools, and research centres. Auroville, an experimental community founded by the Mother in 1968, attracts settlers inspired by his vision of a spiritually united humanity. More than a dozen of his books are continuously in print, and his complete works are being published in thirty-four volumes. His philosophy and politics are discussed in learned journals, and his teachings are an inspiration to tens of thousands of people in all parts of India and the West.<br>
