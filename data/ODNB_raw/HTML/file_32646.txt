<span class="headword">Crosthwaite, Sir  Charles Haukes Todd</span>  (1835&#150;1915), <span class="occ">administrator in India and Burma</span>, was born at Donnybrook, co. Dublin, on 5 December 1835, the second son of John Clarke Crosthwaite, vicar-choral of Christ Church, Dublin, and later rector of St Mary-at-Hill, London, and his wife, Elizabeth Haukes, daughter of Charles H. Todd MD of Sligo and Dublin. After education at Merchant Taylors' School and St John's College, Oxford, he entered the Indian Civil Service in August 1857, and served in various revenue and judicial posts in the North-Western Provinces and the Central Provinces. In these early years Crosthwaite acquired a large family and thereafter his career was dominated by the concern to provide adequately for his children. He married, first, in 1863, Sarah, daughter of William Graham, of Lisburn, with whom he had three sons and three daughters. Sarah died in 1872 and Crosthwaite married, secondly, on 29 December 1874, Caroline Alison (<i>d</i>. 1893), daughter of Sir Henry Lushington, fourth baronet, of Aspenden Hall, Hertfordshire, with whom he had two sons and one daughter.<br>
<br>In March 1883 Crosthwaite became acting chief commissioner of Burma. He returned to the Central Provinces in the following March, again as acting chief commissioner, and was subsequently confirmed in the post. In March 1887, after four months with the public service commission, he readily returned to Burma as chief commissioner in succession to Sir Charles Bernard.<br>
<br>Crosthwaite found that Upper Burma, annexed only two years previously, remained in a state of rebellion. Alert to the unpopularity of the British and their imported Indian police force, he concentrated on strengthening village-level administration and traditional village headships in an attempt to restore a sense of familiar government to the Burmese. At the same time he cracked down hard on guerrilla warfare and arson, thereby easing the embarrassment Britain had suffered over her latest imperial acquisition. He had already been made a CSI in February 1887; in June 1888 he was promoted to KCSI.<br>
<br>Crosthwaite was home member of the executive council from December 1890 until February 1891 and again from April to November 1892, at which latter date he succeeded Sir Auckland Colvin as lieutenant-governor of the North-Western Provinces and chief commissioner of Oudh. His politics were those of gruff conservatism; he saw sedition lurking in many vernacular publications and scorned the political ambitions of Western-educated Indians. When anti-cow-killing disturbances flared up in his province in 1893, he advocated repressive legislation; fortunately for his reputation, however, the less alarmist counsels of Lord Lansdowne prevailed.<br>
<br>Crosthwaite went home on leave in early 1895, and in the following March was appointed to the Council of India, where he served the customary ten years. In retirement he published a memoir of his Burmese years, <span class="italic">The Pacification of Burma</span> (1912), and <span class="italic">Thakur Pertab Singh and other Tales</span> (1913). In a series of articles in <span class="italic">The Times</span> he condemned the Morley&#150;Minto reforms for abandoning the Indian masses to the machinations of a few irresponsible and over-educated Indian politicians. He died at his home at Long Acre, Shamley Green, Surrey, on 28 May 1915 and was buried on 2 June.<br>
