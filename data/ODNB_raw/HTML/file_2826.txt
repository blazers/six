<span class="headword">Bond,  John</span>  (1612&#150;1676), <span class="occ">college head</span>, was born on 12 April 1612, the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2821/', "Denis Bond (1588&#150;1658)")</script>, clothier of Dorchester, Dorset, and later MP for Lutton in the same county, and his wife, Joane (1588&#150;1620), daughter of John Gould, a director of the Dorchester Company. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2830/', "Nathaniel Bond")</script> was his youngest half-brother. He was educated first by John White, rector of Dorchester, and then at St Catharine's College, Cambridge. There he matriculated at Michaelmas 1628, graduated BA in 1632 and proceeded MA in 1635. He appears never to have married. Bond was for long, and understandably, confused with an Exeter minister of the same name, born in Dorset about the same time, who also had a connection with John White, succeeding him as master of the Savoy.<br>
<br>Following the issue of a writ on 25 September 1645, Bond and William Sydenham were admitted as the two MPs for Melcombe Regis, Dorset. Bond was already a member of the county committee and on 18 October he was admitted to the post of recorder of Weymouth and Melcombe Regis; he retained the position until 23 April 1649 when he was replaced by Samuel Bond (who was perhaps his half-brother). In 1646, in a controversial appointment, Bond became master of Trinity Hall, Cambridge, vacant through the death of Thomas Eden. After the mastership was declined by John Selden, on 28 October 1645 the fellows elected Dr Robert King. King, however, was politically unacceptable to parliament, which on 7 March following appointed Bond to the position. He appeared at Trinity Hall and was admitted on the 11th of that month; about the same time he was admitted to the degree of doctor of civil law. On 26 March 1646 the Commons' journal reported the house's approval of the appointment to the college of &#145;John Bond, DCL, a member of this House&#146;  (<span class="italic">JHC</span>, 4, 1644&#150;6, 489).<br>
<br>On 5 June 1646 Bond was named to a parliamentary commission for the exclusion of &#145;notorious offenders&#146; from the sacrament, and the following May he was appointed a commissioner for appeals from the visitors of the University of Oxford. On 29 August 1648 he was named to a committee of both houses to judge scandalous offences, but he was one of those secluded at Pride's Purge a few weeks later. On 4 May the following year he was appointed professor of law in Gresham College in the place of Dr Thomas Leonard. He was also appointed as a master in chancery on 22 May 1650, holding the office until 3 May 1655. He was admitted as member of the Inner Temple on 20 January 1651 and on 1 February was called as an associate of its bench.<br>
<br>Bond continued as master of Trinity&#151;on 20 November 1655 he was paid &pound;53, the arrears due to him for the augmentation earlier granted to his position&#151;and also acted as vice-chancellor of Cambridge University in 1658&#150;9. He was one of the members readmitted to the Rump Parliament by Monck in 1660, and was named as one of the militia commissioners of Dorset in the act of 12 March 1660. However, Bond lost his preferments later that same year; he left Trinity Hall before the reappointment of Robert King on 3 August and resigned his Gresham professorship on 23 October. He retired to Dorset and died in 1676; he was buried at Steeple, Dorset, on 30 July of that year.<br>
