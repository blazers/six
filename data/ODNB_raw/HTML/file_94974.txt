<span class="headword">Fremantle,  Henry Eardley Stephen</span>  (1874&#150;1931), <span class="occ">newspaper editor and politician in South Africa</span>, was born at Bedwell Park, Hatfield, Hertfordshire, on 6 August 1874, the youngest of the five children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/53896/', "William Henry Fremantle (1831&#150;1916)")</script>, rector of St Mary's, Bryanston Square, and later dean of Ripon, and his wife, Isabella Maria Eardley (<i>d</i>. 1901). He was educated at Eton College and Oriel College, Oxford, where he distinguished himself in the field of philosophy and obtained firsts in classical moderations (1895) and <i>literae humaniores</i> (1897). He then held lectureships at University College, Aberystwyth, and Worcester College, Oxford. On 20 April 1899 he married Margaret Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 17 June 1909), daughter of Alexander Macdonald, Ruskin master of drawing at Oxford. They had one daughter.<br>
<br>In 1899 Fremantle accepted the chair of English and philosophy at the South African College in Cape Town. He resigned his professorship in 1903 to concentrate on politics and journalism. His concern that the defeat of the Boer republics in the South African War and the alienation of Cape Afrikaners would damage the interests of the British empire had a profound influence on his political philosophy. He believed that the reconciliation of the Afrikaner could secure Britain's long-term interests in South Africa. Only by granting Afrikaners those rights which the English enjoyed themselves could British supremacy in South Africa be ensured peacefully. The Afrikaners and British had to move away from their old hatreds to become a strong, healthy, self-respecting South African nation, developing along its own lines within the empire. In pursuit of this ideal he joined John X. Merriman's South African Party in 1903 and became the co-editor of the <span class="italic">South African News</span>, the party's mouthpiece. In the jingoistic post-war climate of Cape Colony he had to endure much abuse as a lapsed Englishman. On 20 September 1910, following the death of his first wife, he married Helen le Roux, daughter of J. J. Eksteen of Piquetberg, an Afrikaner. The marriage was childless.<br>
<br>In 1906 Fremantle was elected to represent Uitenhage in the Cape legislative assembly, where he distinguished himself as a talented speaker on public finances and education, and as a campaigner for the unification of South Africa. In aid of this ideal he published <span class="italic">The New Nation: a Survey of the Conditions and Prospects of South Africa</span> (1909). In the Union of South Africa parliament, where he was MP for Uitenhage from 1910, he also made his mark as a person of ability. Unfortunately his fondness for controversy, his arrogance and tactlessness, and the fact that he made no attempt to conceal his sense of superiority, harmed his reputation. His unbridled personal ambition, which created unrealistic expectations, and public frustration that men of talents inferior to his own advanced ahead of him, also alienated many. The result was a lingering suspicion that he was an opportunistic careerist.<br>
<br>In 1912 Fremantle's vision of South Africanism alienated him from the South African Party. Fluent in Dutch, he campaigned not only for language equality between Dutch and English as advocated by his party, but compulsory bilingualism. He became close to J. B. M. Hertzog, the champion of Afrikaner interests, and followed Hertzog into the newly founded National Party in 1914. According to Fremantle, Hertzog had to be supported in his desire to encourage a common South African nationalism as it would preserve the empire in South Africa. Critics, however, ascribed his motives to thwarted political ambitions in the South African Party. The outbreak of the First World War in 1914 initiated a period of turmoil for Fremantle. He decided to remain loyal to Hertzog's stance that the Union of South Africa should only act defensively and not invade German South-West Africa. Ambitious to become the party's Cape leader, he played a leading role in its founding in the province in 1915. While most English-speaking South Africans despised Fremantle as a renegade, many Afrikaners refused to be led by an English-speaking member of the Anglican church who advocated the franchise for Africans. D. F. Malan, the eventual Cape leader, viewed Fremantle as an unstable personality and an opportunist, and marginalized him in the party.<br>
<br>Fremantle's position in the National Party was weakened when he lost his parliamentary seat in the 1915 election. Although he was one of the party's ablest parliamentarians, no effort was made, to his bitter disappointment, to secure him a safe seat. In 1916 he became the editor of <span class="italic">The Interpreter</span>, a weekly paper and an official organ of the National Party, which sought to conciliate English-speakers and Afrikaners. Fremantle sincerely believed that he was the only person who could understand and interpret the mind of the Afrikaners for his fellow English-speaking South Africans. The paper, however, made no impact and closed in May 1918.<br>
<br>The growth of republicanism in the National Party made Fremantle's position untenable, and when it was obvious that his attempts to counter growing support for secessionism had failed, he resigned from the party in 1920. Hertzog dismissed his resignation as personal pique for not becoming the Cape leader of the party. Fremantle was involved in the flag controversy of 1926&#150;8. He supported the notion of a South African flag, but opposed the National Party's stance of excluding the union jack from the new flag. He became a member of the central executive of the Flag (Vigilance) Committee Organisation to oppose such a flag, but eventually lost his position as he was seen as too tolerant of the nationalists.<br>
<br>The years after 1920, marred by financial difficulties, were unhappy and frustrating. By then Fremantle was so discredited that other parties kept their distance, and he played no role in party politics. Activities such as political commentary and his membership of the board of trade and industries (1922&#150;5), and of the Non-Racial Franchise Association to defend the rights of black voters in the Cape, did not compensate for his isolation and sense of failure. He became involved in local affairs in Cape Town and in August 1931 was elected to the city council, but did not live to take his seat. He died at his home, Essendon, Firdale Avenue, Gardens, Cape Town, on 6 September 1931, following an attack of influenza, and was buried at Muizenberg two days later. He possessed great intellectual gifts, but a curious combination of idealism, arrogance, and an unrealistic sense of his own importance meant that he never fulfilled his early promise.<br>
