<span class="headword">Suetonius Paullinus,  Gaius</span>  (<em>fl. </em><em>c.</em><span class="smallcap">AD</span> 40&#150;69), <span class="occ">Roman governor of Britain</span>, almost certainly derived from the town of Pisaurum (Pesaro), on the Adriatic coast of Italy. Nothing else is known about his family, except that a man of the same names as himself, consul in <span class="smallcap">AD</span> 66, may be assumed to be his son (the famous biographer of the Caesars, Gaius Suetonius Tranquillus, is not known to have been related to Paullinus).<br>
<br>Paullinus first came to notice at the beginning of the 40s. He was one of the Roman generals, with the rank of ex-praetor, who pacified the Moorish rising provoked by the annexation of the north African kingdom of Mauretania. Paullinus was the first Roman commander ever to cross the summit of the Atlas Mountains. He may have owed his selection for this expedition to the prefect of the praetorian guard, Arrecinus Clemens, a native of Pisaurum. Paullinus must have held the consulship in the 40s, but nothing further is known of his career until his appointment to Britain in <span class="smallcap">AD</span> 58. This followed the unexpected death in the province of the governor Quintus Veranius, who had begun a forward policy after some years of quiescence under the intervening governor, Didius Gallus. In <span class="smallcap">AD</span> 58 and 59, taking up the challenge implied in the testament of Veranius, who had claimed that &#145;he could have conquered the rest of Britain if he had had another two years&#146;  (Tacitus, <span class="italic">Annals</span>, xiv.29), Paullinus subjugated and garrisoned much of Wales. There remained the island of Mona (Anglesey), the stronghold of the druids, whose influence over the Britons made it an inevitable target. Paullinus had the best part of two legions, the fourteenth and the twentieth, under his command; the other two, IX Hispana and II Augusta, were left guarding the north-east and south-west of the province respectively. No sooner had the island been occupied and the sacred groves cut down than Paullinus received news of Boudicca's uprising.<br>
<br>A combination of factors had provoked the great rebellion. Prasutagus, client ruler of the Iceni of what is now East Anglia, had died shortly before and his kingdom was incorporated into the province. In the process the imperial procurator (chief financial administrator), the knight Decianus Catus, acted very harshly, and Prasutagus's widow, Boudicca, and her daughters were maltreated. The land-grabbing activities of the veteran colonists at Camulodunum (Colchester) had also caused deep resentment and the Temple of Claudius in the <i>colonia</i> (chartered town for the settlement of veterans) was regarded, according to Tacitus, as &#145;a citadel of eternal domination&#146;  (Tacitus, <span class="italic">Annals</span>, xiv.31). Cassius Dio mentions that the wealthy Seneca, still a leading adviser of the emperor Nero, had suddenly called in loans made to the Britons, which would certainly have caused hardship among the British &eacute;lite. Finally, the assault on the druid &#145;holy island&#146; may well have stirred the religious feelings of the Britons. At all events, the rising won widespread support, with Boudicca as its figurehead. Camulodunum was stormed and largely destroyed. The procurator Catus, with only a few hundred soldiers at his disposal, was unable to defend the town and fled across the channel to Gaul, while the legate of the IX Hispana, Petillius Cerialis, who brought his troops south (presumably from the legionary base at Longthorpe, near Peterborough), was routed, with heavy casualties. Cerialis himself escaped with his cavalry. Paullinus had meanwhile marched rapidly south, but, although he reached London, he decided that it could not be defended and withdrew into the midlands. London and Verulamium (St Albans) were both destroyed, with heavy loss of life. It was later claimed by Cassius Dio that &#145;eighty thousand Romans&#146; died at the hands of the rebels, and that some of the captives were sacrificed in bestial fashion &#145;in the grove of Andate&#146;  (Cassius Dio, <span class="italic">Roman History</span>, lxii. 1, 7).<br>
<br>With the fourteenth legion, part of the twentieth, and some auxiliary regiments, Paullinus had about 10,000 men when he met the rebel army, probably in the midlands, close to the Roman road now called Watling Street, where he won a famous victory. &#145;A little less than eighty thousand Britons&#146; were said by Tacitus to have fallen, as against only 400 on the Roman side  (Tacitus, <span class="italic">Annals</span>, xiv.37). Boudicca took her own life, as did a senior Roman officer, Poenius Postumus, who had been too frightened to bring the II Augusta from its base in south-west Britain to help. The scale of the destruction caused by the rebels and the report by the procurator Catus of the sack of Camulodunum had evidently led Nero to contemplate abandoning Britain. It must have seemed like a repetition of the great disaster in Germany in <span class="smallcap">AD</span> 9, when the loss of three legions resulted in the withdrawal from Germany east of the Rhine. As it was, the ninth legion had lost 2000 men, who had to be replaced by troops from the Rhineland, and eight new auxiliary infantry cohorts and two cavalry regiments, a further 5000 men, were also sent to Britain.<br>
<br>Paullinus followed his victory with repressive measures, which had the result of stoking up resistance. The new procurator, Julius Classicianus, protested to Rome that peace could not be achieved unless Paullinus was replaced. Nero sent a senior imperial freedman, Polyclitus, to inspect the situation. Paullinus was initially retained, but dismissed on a pretext not long afterwards, to be succeeded by one of the consuls of <span class="smallcap">AD</span> 61, Petronius Turpilianus, nephew of the first governor of Britain, Plautius. (Since Petronius was sent to Britain straight after his consulship, but in the year following the rebellion, it is clear that the rebellion and its suppression, although described by Tacitus under the year 61, must have occurred in 60.) However, Paullinus was by no means disgraced: a lead tessera from Rome with the emperor's name on one side and that of Paullinus, with victory symbols, on the reverse  (Rostowzew, no. 230), suggests that Nero issued largess to celebrate the victory. Further, Paullinus's presumed son was consul a few years later, in <span class="smallcap">AD</span> 66. The two legions which had defeated Boudicca were honoured with new titles, the fourteenth becoming Martia Victrix and the twentieth Valeria Victrix. Camulodunum was rebuilt with the new title <i>colonia Victricensis</i>, suggesting that veterans of these two legions were settled there. The last record of Paullinus comes from the &#145;year of the four emperors&#146;, <span class="smallcap">AD</span> 69, when, by now &#145;the oldest of the ex-consuls&#146;  (Tacitus, <span class="italic">Histories</span>, ii.37), he held high command for Otho in his unsuccessful campaign against Vitellius in northern Italy.<br>
