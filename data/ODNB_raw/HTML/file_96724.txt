<span class="headword">Kemp,  Edward</span>  (1817&#150;1891), <span class="occ">landscape gardener</span>, was born at Streatham, Surrey, on 25 September 1817 and baptized at the Independent chapel, Tooting, on 26 October, the son of Charles Kemp (<i>b</i>. 1785/6), tailor, and his wife, Ann. During the 1830s he was a garden apprentice alongside Edward Milner under Joseph Paxton, superintendent of the gardens at Chatsworth in Derbyshire. Kemp and Milner learned about planting an arboretum and a pinetum, how to construct a massive rockery that appeared to be natural, how to install a fountain, and the importance of greenhouses to a large estate.<br>
<br>Along with Paxton and Milner, Kemp became a leader in park and garden design in mid-Victorian England. As part of the movement to provide green recreational spaces for industrial populations, Birkenhead's improvement commissioners had obtained a private bill empowering them to use public funds to build and maintain a public park across the River Mersey from Liverpool's expanding boundaries. Between 1842 and 1845 the park was planned by Paxton who, from 1843, entrusted its development to Kemp, making him head gardener (superintendent), a post he held for forty years.<br>
<br>Birkenhead Park was drained by the creation of two lakes, and the spoil was artfully contrived to look like low hills around the lakes, which, with their islands, helped to provide views across the water. The hills were made craggy with stone from the excavation of the lakes, and trees were planted to separate the views; all the additions gave a feeling of the park as a &#145;natural&#146; phenomenon. A plan of about 1845 shows sinuous paths, as John Claudius Loudon used, winding around the outer rim of the park, with shrubs and trees at the junctions of the paths as well as the boundary. Showy flowering plants were recommended by Kemp round the park borders. There were large areas of grassland in the centre, which could be used for sport. These features were to be repeated in other parks by Kemp, and Birkenhead Park was sufficiently influential to attract visits in 1850 and 1859 from F. L. Olmsted, the American designer of Central Park, New York. When the park was opened in 1847 both cricket and archery had been introduced, and Kemp was later to oversee the introduction of further sports, including football in 1861. Paid &pound;1000 a year for the park's maintenance, he lived in a lodge in the park, so that he could manage and protect it, with his wife, Sophia (1817/18&#150;1887), daughter of Henry Bailey of Croydon, whom he had married on 5 September 1845.<br>
<br>Kemp's work at Birkenhead led to further commissions. He made a flower garden in 1849 for James Barratt in Warrington, followed by others for Samuel Job at Aigburth near Liverpool and for Sir Edward Smythe near Shrewsbury in 1851. Kemp's flower gardens were made on the sunniest sides of a house, and were to be simple and symmetrical, with beds divided by grass, gravel, box or stone. Sunny sites were for rose gardens, with ferneries where it was shady. Kemp designed winter gardens and American gardens, water features with dams and islands, and planned summerhouses, greenhouses, and statuary in appropriate positions.<br>
<br>In 1850 Kemp produced the first of three editions of <span class="italic">How to Lay Out a Small Garden</span>, referring in its preface to the &#145;humanising and elevating influence about everything that is really beautiful, whether in Art or Nature&#146;  (p. vi), which would cheer and benefit the observer, and, of course, the owner of the estate. On reaching its second edition (1858) it was hailed as &#145;the best book on pure garden design in the English language&#146;, though &#145;it may not always be able to endorse Mr Kemp's opinions&#146;  (<span class="italic">Gardeners' Chronicle</span>, 19 June 1858, 496). The book's third edition (1864) set out his division of the styles of landscape gardening into three: &#145;the old formal or geometrical style, the mixed, middle or irregular style, which Mr. Loudon called the gardenesque; and the picturesque&#146;  (p. 91). In fact Loudon's term was intended to mean the making of a style that separated art from nature, giving garden plants space to develop their own distinctive characteristics, and where natural features were set apart from man-made ones. Kemp interpreted his mixed or irregular style as &#145;a blending of Art with Nature&#146;, with rounded lines and no irregularity. Kemp's third style was only in part influenced by Uvedale Price's <span class="italic">Essay on the Picturesque</span>; Kemp saw it as harsh and angular, with wildness, ruggedness, broken ground and dashing water. But he agreed with Price in his condemnation of clumps and lines of similar trees, which Lancelot Brown had introduced.<br>
<br>Much of what Kemp had written about the &#145;mixed or middle&#146; style appeared in the landscape of Biddulph Grange in Staffordshire. In the <span class="italic">Gardeners' Chronicle</span> of 1862 he wrote five articles describing the landscapes of this extraordinary garden, made by James Bateman and Edward Cooke, combining a number of themed parts including Egyptian and Chinese, with horticultural spaces such as a stumpery of upturned tree roots, flower borders, and an avenue of deodars.<br>
<br>Kemp's <span class="italic">The Parks, Gardens etc. of London and its Suburbs</span> (1851) was a guide to the landscape features, horticulture, and ornamental structures relevant to the garden architect, compiled from visits to eighty-one public parks, public gardens, private gardens and nurseries and florists' gardens, within a 20 mile radius of St Paul's. He noted the villas with their gardens springing up, &#145;some of the finest&#146; at Roehampton, Putney Heath, and Wandsworth; the Spanish chestnut as a first-rate park tree, and the occidental plane as one of the best and most serviceable London trees in parks and squares. He remarked on the spread of London, and its &#145;lack of breathing places or means of open-air recreation&#146;, though he was critical of the low standard of work at Victoria Park, opened in 1845 for the large and crowded districts of Bethnal Green, Whitechapel, and Shoreditch. At Kensington Gardens he found fault with the avenues and vistas, but admired the collections of plants; and he had nothing but praise for the old-fashioned flower garden at Holland House and the specimens of old exotic trees on the lawn. His interest in plants extended to London's nurseries, which specialized in indoor exotics, among them Loddiges of Hackney, with many &#145;first-rate specimens&#146; in its well-constructed orchid house.<br>
<br>Kemp went on to work on Anfield cemetery in Liverpool (1856), Hesketh Park in Southport (1864), Stanley Park in Liverpool (1868), and Saltwell Park in Gateshead (1876). His private commissions included the grounds of Shendish, Hertfordshire, in 1854, for Charles Longman, an &#145;architectural&#146; layout of P. S. Humberston's estate at Mollington, Cheshire, in 1856, and John Naylor's pleasure grounds at Leighton Hall, Welshpool, in 1858. He also laid out part of the garden at Knightshayes in Devon in 1874, working from designs by William Burges. He retired in the 1880s, and died at Birkenhead Park, Cheshire, on 1 March 1891. His work influenced others, including Thomas Hayton Mawson, whose Hanley Park, Stoke on Trent (1897), followed Kemp's shaping of Birkenhead.<br>
