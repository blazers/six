</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Hill,  Rowland</span>, first Viscount Hill  (1772&#150;1842), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was born on 11 August 1772 at Prees Hall, near Hawkstone and Shrewsbury in Shropshire, the second son and fourth of the sixteen children of John Hill, later third baronet (1740&#150;1824), of Hawkstone, and his wife, Mary (<i>d</i>. 1806), the daughter of Robert Chambre of Petton, Shropshire. The rising influence of the Hill family had accelerated during the career of Richard Hill (1655&#150;1727), called &#145;the great Hill&#146;, lord of the Treasury and lord of the Admiralty under Queen Anne. A baronetcy was created for his nephew Rowland in 1727, and it passed to John Hill in November 1809. Five of Rowland Hill's brothers took part in the Napoleonic wars, including his elder brother, John, of the 25th light dragoons; Clement, who long served as his aide-de-camp; <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13312/', "Thomas Noel Hill (1784&#150;1832)")</script>, in the Portuguese service; Francis, also in the Portuguese service; and Robert, commander of the Royal Horse Guards. George IV later told Sir John, their father: &#145;I am glad, indeed, to see the father of so many brave sons&#146;  (Sidney, 9). As a young child Rowland was large and somewhat awkward and reserved, but he possessed a bright mind and formed his own opinions independently, although in his younger years he much imitated John. At the age of seven or eight he went to Ightfield School for one year and then to a school in Chester, where he remained until he was seventeen, when his father wanted him to prepare to enter the legal profession. However, John had already joined the army, and Rowland told his parents that, because he did not like the study of law, he would never excel at it. Instead, he preferred a career in the army. This choice surprised his teachers&#151;on occasion he had fainted at the sight of blood&#151;but he stood by his choice, and his parents agreed to it.<h2>
<a name="Earlyarmycareer"></a>Early army career</h2>In 1790 Sir John Hill arranged for Rowland's commission as an ensign in the 38th foot, followed by leave to study at a military academy in Strasbourg. He was promoted lieutenant early in 1791, returned briefly to England, and then received another leave of absence to resume his studies. He joined the 53rd foot in January 1792 and resumed active service that was virtually unbroken during the wars of the next twenty-three years. In 1793 he raised an independent company that carried a promotion to captain. He briefly served with Francis Drake as assistant secretary at the republic of Genoa, but when Admiral Hood landed at Toulon (28 August 1793) Hill hurried there to join his regiment. Hill energetically carried orders for Lord Mulgrave, General Charles O'Hara, and Sir David Dundas, as well as spending time in the front lines, where he received a superficial wound. When Dundas evacuated Toulon in December, Hill carried the dispatches to London. In 1794 Thomas Graham raised a regiment, the 90th foot, and Hill contributed so much in recruiting that he was promoted major and shortly afterwards lieutenant-colonel. The 90th moved about the Mediterranean and other minor venues during the next four years. The next French movement involving Bonaparte&#151;Hill had faced his artillery at Toulon&#151;occurred with the French landing in Egypt in July 1798, and Hill, fuming over his lack of action at Gibraltar, once more joined Drake on a mission to the continent. When he learned that the force under Sir Ralph Abercromby was preparing to sail to Egypt he raced back to take part. By then he had been promoted brevet colonel.<br>
<br>In March 1801 the British force anchored in Abu Qir Bay and the troops landed. On 13 March, in hard fighting, Hill, commanding the 90th, was severely wounded by a musket ball to the head; a week later Abercromby, mortally wounded, was brought into Hill's cabin and soon died. Hill rejoined the 90th after three weeks of convalescence and advanced against Cairo as French resistance weakened. By September the enemy had left Egypt. Hill was made a knight of the Crescent of Turkey. He sailed to Malta for garrison duty, an assignment that lasted for only a short time while British and French diplomats negotiated the peace of Amiens, which seemed destined to cause a reduction of the British army and the disbanding of the 90th. Instead, after Hill had taken a short period of leave at Hawkstone, relations with France soured, and he rejoined the army at Belfast amid rumours, which seemed genuine, that the French were planning to invade Ireland. Hill meticulously reconnoitred all possible landing sites and planned for counter-measures against an invasion. Having been promoted major-general (30 October 1805), he joined a force&#151;intended to liberate Hanover from the French&#151;bound for the Hanoverian coast, where he was in charge of embarkation. He carried out his duties well and during this period met Sir Arthur Wellesley for the first time. After the expedition failed (1806) Hill was stationed briefly at Canterbury and served on the staff of Sir John Moore, generally recognized as the premier organizer in the army. Hill's own skills at troop management were being formed, and his reputation for being a firm disciplinarian while demonstrating humanitarian concern and equitable techniques in training and handling troops began to set him apart. Early in his career some of his men began calling him Daddy Hill, a term of appreciation for his benevolent concern for the common soldier, but it also began to create a stereotype of Hill that rather masked his ruthless combat qualities. Despite his battlefield heroism, this stereotype dogged him throughout his illustrious career.<h2>
<a name="IrelandandthePeninsula"></a>Ireland and the Peninsula</h2>Hill spent over a year in Ireland (1807&#150;8). In 1807 the French invaded Portugal: they seized Lisbon (1 December), and Dom Jo&atilde;o, the prince regent, and his court barely escaped and sailed with British protection to Brazil. When Bonaparte seized the Spanish throne in May 1808, and the Spanish appealed for British help, the British government decided to send an expedition to Portugal. Temporarily Wellesley was in command, and Hill was assigned to organize the embarkation. The force of about 10,000 men sailed from Cork on 12 July and arrived off Portugal on 1 August. Hill supervised the landing at Mondego Bay, about 100 miles north of Lisbon. Wellesley quickly formed his forces and engaged Delaborde at Roli&ccedil;a (17 August); Hill commanded the 1st brigade, which was stationed in the centre of Wellesley's position. Rifleman Harris gave a poignant account of Hill's great courage when he rallied the 29th foot after the death of its colonel. When Delaborde withdrew, Junot offered battle at Vimeiro (21 August). Hill's force occupied Wellesley's right, but the French were forced back and virtually routed. Soon afterwards the combatants signed the disgraceful convention of Cintra (22 August), following which Hill's brigade came under the command of Sir John Hope, under Sir John Moore.<br>
<br>Moore decided to take the offensive against the French in Spain, an unlucky decision based on poor intelligence, and Hill's men marched northwards towards the border. Bonaparte, however, poured forces into Spain, and Moore, Hill, and the other generals were forced to retreat to the coast, closely pursued by Marshal Andoche Soult's corps. They defeated Soult at Corunna on 16 January 1809, when Moore was killed, then escaped on British transports. Hill and Beresford formed the rearguard, and their men rowed to the ships as the evacuation was completed. After leave in Ireland, Hill sailed from Cork in March with about 4000 troops to reinforce Sir John Francis Cradock at Lisbon. Wellesley replaced the cautious Cradock in April, and the British force marched towards Porto. Hill commanded the 1st division, and two other infantry divisions and a cavalry division, with Portuguese troops interspersed, brought Wellesley's meagre force to about 17,000 men. At Porto, Soult's forces lined the northern bank of the 300-yard-wide River Douro, and on 12 May Wellesley ordered a surprise daylight crossing. Hill's troops were among the first across, and Soult was soon forced out of the city. The stunning success of the operation led to the invasion of Spain in early summer and the battle of Talavera (28 July). Hill was wounded by a musket ball during the desperate battle, and Wellesley's forces retreated towards Portugal.<br>
<br>Wellesley confirmed his confidence in Hill later in 1809 by appointing him to a semi-independent command in the Portuguese Alentejo based on two factors: he meticulously followed orders, and he knew how to adapt troops to unusual circumstances. With British resources so meagre, Hill was an ideal choice for such an assignment. By 1810 Soult's army of the south held Andalusia, and Marshal Andr&eacute; Mass&eacute;na had assembled a large force yet again to invade Portugal. Wellesley, now Viscount Wellington, drew Hill's force closer to his main position at Busaco, and his men dug in on the right as the fierce battle took place on 26&#150;7 September. After the allied troops began their retreat towards Lisbon, Hill marched to Coimbra and then southwards to the environs of Torres Vedras, where the British and Portuguese constructed strong defensive fortifications. He took a virtually impregnable position on the right of Wellington's main force, and Mass&eacute;na found himself stalemated before the lines of Torres Vedras. On 14 November the French began taking positions a little to the north, and Hill's force began edging forward again. Hill contracted an infectious fever at this time, and because many men died from it he was sent to Lisbon to recuperate. When the effects of the disease persisted Hill returned home, and for six months his force came under the command of other officers. William Stewart, the ranking brigade officer, took a turn at command, but because he was prone to lead into risky engagements Wellington ordered William Carr Beresford to take command of the detached force in the south. In March 1811, when Mass&eacute;na began a full retreat, Beresford began moving his corps towards Campo Mayor.<br>
<br>Perhaps the Albuera campaign provides a study of the clear contrasts between the executive skills of field command shown by Hill and Beresford. Beresford's clumsiness was apparent at Campo Mayor in April, but he was cleared to oppose Soult's force as it marched northwards into the vicinity of his force at Albuera (16 May 1811). In the desperate fighting Beresford's disposition was faulty, his orders were indecisive, and his losses of British troops were staggering. On 1 June, Hill resumed command of his shattered force, although Wellington told Beresford to &#145;write him a victory&#146;  (Vichness, 431), and Hill soon reconstructed the southern wing into a potent fighting force. He moved into the region of Portalegre, and by 1 September his corps had grown to about 16,000. Meanwhile, a worthy opponent, General Jean-Baptiste Girard, began playing cat-and-mouse games in Estremadura, near Merida. Girard's actions were designed to draw attention away from the French operations near Ciudad Rodrigo, but nevertheless Hill intermittently entertained his officers and other guests and reconnoitred the area to prepare for an opportunity against Girard. Of the former activities, Wellington once told a staff member: &#145;As you are a stranger, I will give you some useful information. Cole gives the best dinners in the army; Hill the next best; mine are no great things; Beresford's and Picton's are very bad indeed&#146;  (Brett-James, 69). Hill was something of an epicure and transported a handsome silver service in the Peninsula with which to serve his elegant dinners. He began extensive secret preparations to force a showdown with Girard.<br>
<br>Since Girard had only 6000 men around Caceres, Hill put together a larger expeditionary force to pursue Girard and attempt to bring him to action. As the October rains pounded Estremadura, Hill put his force into motion, and his own troops did not learn of his objective of relieving Caceres until the march turned eastwards. As Hill approached Caceres, Girard withdrew generally towards Merida along a curving route that resembled a flexed elbow. By forced marches Hill moved rapidly towards the French, and by 27 October he was able to get within striking distance of Girard at Arroyo Molinos. Girard was a shrewd opponent, but, possibly on account of the torrential rain, neglected to patrol the area, affording Hill the opportunity of moving his entire force within a few hundred yards of the village occupied by the French. On the morning of 28 October he unleashed his men on the position and completely surprised Girard's units. Hill's men drove the main force into the mountains, killed 800, captured 1300, and seized all the horses, the baggage, three field pieces, and the magazine. Hill lost seven killed and sixty-four wounded. In all, the operation was a great contribution to allied morale in the dreary year of 1811 and began the steady elevation of Hill to the forefront of Wellington's generals. The earl of Aberdeen wrote to his brother in November 1811: &#145;I have formed a notion that he is the second best man in Portugal&#146;; the brother replied: &#145;You are perfectly right&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 43224).<h2>
<a name="ThelaterPeninsularWar"></a>The later Peninsular War</h2>On 22 February 1812 Hill, on Wellington's recommendation, was made a KB. That year, as the scales began to tip towards the British in Spain, Wellington decided to move against Ciudad Rodrigo, and Hill received permission for an operation against the bridge and fortifications at Almaraz on the Tagus River. As the expedition began on 24 April, Hill selected three infantry brigades, an artillery brigade under Alexander Dickson, and two regiments of cavalry for the march, a total of 7000 men. He used elaborate ruses to conceal his intentions, because, if his movement were to be detected, strong enemy forces could intercept his retreat. He refused to let his men stage a banquet at Truxillo to celebrate the anniversary of the battle of Albuera. Instead, he ordered a march throughout the night that brought his force within 6 miles of the location of the bridge. The difficulties included strong fortifications on both sides of the river as well as a menacing castle, Mirabete, guarding the road on which Hill's men approached. A sentry detected a British soldier on the road and alerted the garrison, which began firing on the main force. Hill had no siege equipment, but his scouts located a goat trail leading down the mountain to Fort Napoleon, a stone fort with 450 men. Hill decided to surprise and storm the fort, &#145;a resolution&#146;, wrote William Napier:<blockquote>more hardy than it would appear &hellip; [If he failed,] every slanderous tongue would have been let loose on the rashness of attacking invulnerable forts: a military career hitherto so glorious might have been terminated in shame, but totally void of interested ambition Hill was unshaken. (Napier, 4.163)</blockquote>Hill's men crept to within 800 yards of the fort during the night of 18 May. As General Christopher Tilson-Chowne feinted against Mirabete high on the mountain, Hill's troops scaled Fort Napoleon, routed the garrison, and turned the guns there against Fort Ragusa on the opposite side of the river. The commander, Aubert, ignominiously evacuated the fort, and Hill soon controlled the two forts and the bridge. His men destroyed the installations and large stores of food, supplies, and equipment. He retreated southwards the following day, since an attempt to besiege Mirabete would probably have brought French forces racing towards the region. But the brilliant operation permanently destroyed French communication in that area, for materials were not available for repairs. Once more, General Hill, the surpriser, had turned a difficult assignment into a great gain: &#145;It was&#146;, said Benjamin D'Urban, &#145;the most advantageous Coup of the Second Class during the war&#146;  (D'Urban, 256). George Bell called him &#145;the Duke's favourite and most successful General&#146;  (Bell, 63).<br>
<br>During the remainder of 1812 Wellington defeated Marmont at Salamanca (22 July) and advanced against Burgos, while Hill kept a force south of Madrid. When Wellington was forced to retreat westwards, Hill joined the march and went into winter quarters. Neither side could fight a winter campaign, so Hill's future assignment was that of commander of an attached wing rather than as commander of a semi-independent corps, at which he had excelled. As the advance of 1813 began, Hill commanded not only the 2nd division, the Surprisers, but the light division, the Portuguese division, and other forces, a total of 30,000 men. They moved steadily forwards towards the plains of Vitoria, where the French army formed a strong line, with Hill's corps on the right facing Gazan's army of the south. On 21 June the battle broke out near Hill's position, and he directed the movements under heavy fire. Eventually the French force broke and retreated, leaving heavy casualties on both sides, but the French lost all their artillery, stores, and baggage, together with huge sums of money and treasure. Four of the Hill brothers were reunited during the march beyond Vitoria, and the forces moved steadily towards the frontiers of France; on 9 July the brothers had their first extensive view into France.<br>
<br>While cantoned in the heights near Maya, Hill constantly studied the French positions. He began advancing on 8 November 1813. On 13 December his force of 14,000 was stationed at St Pierre d'Irube when Soult attacked it with a powerful force of 35,000. Because of heavy rains and swollen streams no reinforcements could reach Hill's position, but he did take advantage of a narrow front. The carnage was terrible, but at the crucial moment Hill moved the 57th foot from his right to the centre, and the French attack was repulsed. Wellington later rode up and said: &#145;Hill, the day's your own!&#146;  (Longford, 338). Yet Hill received only modest publicity from this great feat. In the lore of the Peninsular War, it may be better known that Hill swore at St Pierre&#151;one of only two times, it was said, the other being at Talavera&#151;that he won an impressive victory at worse than two-to-one odds. The allied force continued to move eastwards in 1814, and in late March Wellington's forces reached Toulouse, the taking of which appeared to be a bloody operation. Hill attacked the St Cyprien suburb, the other units began their assault, and, by 11 April, Soult's forces withdrew towards the south. At this time couriers arrived to bring official notice that Bonaparte had abdicated and peace had been declared. Wellington left Hill in command of the allied army while he travelled to Paris. Hill's accomplishments were exceeded only by those of the commander-in-chief.<br>
<br>At the age of forty-two Hill emerged from the Peninsular War as a proven general, but he planned to return to his estate in Shropshire. The government was preparing to expand the war in North America, and his name was mentioned as the possible commander of it, but in fact the war was giving way to negotiation. Hill had been elected an MP for Shrewsbury in 1812, on the family interest, but had never had an opportunity to be seated; he supported the government. As the Peninsular War ended, Hill and four other generals were made barons; Hill was created Baron Hill of Almaraz and of Hawkstone on 17 May 1814 and granted a pension of &pound;2000 per annum. As he never married he wanted his title and pension to pass to his nephew, so on 16 January 1816 he was granted a special remainder to the male heirs of his brother John. On his return to Shropshire he was f&ecirc;ted as a hero and honoured by a memorial column in Shrewsbury costing &pound;6000, 133 feet high and inscribed with the victories which he had gained.<h2>
<a name="Waterlooandafter"></a>Waterloo and after</h2>Following Bonaparte's escape from Elba in February 1815, the cabinet ordered Wellington to Belgium and sent Hill to join him. Hill arrived at Brussels on 2 April, and Wellington directed him to restrain the prince of Orange, commanding the Dutch-Belgian forces, from rash actions. Thousands of British troops crossed the channel, including three of Hill's brothers&#151;Clement, Robert, and Thomas.<br>
<br>As Wellington formed his army, Hill received command of a corps of 25,000 to 30,000 men, which Wellington placed to the far right of his main position at Mont St Jean, south of Waterloo. Bonaparte's movements were carried out in secrecy, but Wellington could not give up his view that Bonaparte might direct his advance over good roads to Hill's position, so he kept his right wing strong, perhaps too strong. Hill's force played no appreciable part in the battle of Quatre-Bras (16 June) and was engaged only peripherally at Waterloo (18 June). As the battle progressed, when Hill saw that no threat was offered on the far right, he began leading some of his units to support the allied troops around the key position at Hougoumont. His horse was shot under him but, though bruised, he survived the desperate fighting. He accompanied the army to Paris and then went on furlough to London to consult Lord Bathurst about the succession of his peerage. He then returned to France, established headquarters at Cambrai, and served as second in command of Wellington's army of occupation. He was made GCB on 2 January 1815 and GCH in 1816, and received Portuguese, Austrian, Russian, and Dutch orders.<br>
<br>In 1818 Hill returned to Shropshire and undertook the renovation of his modest estate, Hardwicke Grange, which he inherited from his uncle Sir Richard Hill, second baronet (<i>d</i>. 1809). Sir John and his sons were not very secure financially, and Hill had to manage carefully his income from his pension, his colonelcies of various regiments, including the 53rd (1817&#150;30), and from governorships at various times, among them that of Plymouth, the best available when he obtained it in 1830. He occasionally went to London, where he sat in the Lords, but in the early 1820s he paid only nominal attention to politics, voting tory. On 14 June 1820 he was awarded a DCL degree from Oxford University. George IV selected him to carry the royal standard at the 1821 coronation, and Hill later wrote to the College of Arms requesting it. In 1823 he declined the lieutenancy of the ordnance and in 1827 the master-generalship, offered by Wellington. However, in 1828 he replaced Wellington, then prime minister, as commander-in-chief of the army. At the request of William IV he abstained from voting on the <span class="roman">Reform Bill</span>.<br>
<br>As commander-in-chief, Hill surrounded himself with good men, such as Sir Henry Hardinge and Lord Fitzroy Somerset. He continued to be influenced by Wellington, and attempted no fundamental reforms, although he did introduce reforms to reduce drunkenness in the ranks, to provide educational and recreational outlets for troops, and to curb some of the more cruel forms of punishment, such as flogging. He approved, if reluctantly, the formation of regimental libraries. His performance at the Horse Guards became more complex when Lord Grey and the whigs came to office in 1830. Hill probably survived the political pressures because he had firm control of the army and showed skill in his policies supporting the civil power and limited military expeditions. In the late 1830s his health declined, and he resigned on 9 August 1842. On 22 September he was created Viscount Hill with remainder to his nephew Sir Rowland Hill, bt. He died at Hardwicke Grange on 10 December 1842 and was buried on 16 December in the village church of Hadnall, Shropshire. He divided his fortune of &pound;30,000 among his family and left a fund to maintain the Shrewsbury column. He was succeeded by his nephew Sir Rowland Hill, fourth baronet (1800&#150;1875), tory MP for Shropshire (1821&#150;32) and for North Shropshire (1832&#150;42).<br>
<br>To evaluate Hill's contributions, one should focus on his role as an army officer rather than as an administrator. He was a commander with genuine humanitarian concerns for his men. He was a loyal subordinate who never deviated from the concept that he must meticulously obey orders. He possessed sound judgement and displayed the impressive ability to be inventive when he carried out surprise operations. He showed a broad grasp of tactics and, to a degree, of strategy, although the towering Wellington dictated the course of the struggle in the Peninsula that helped to lead to the defeat of the empire. Yet Hill's battlefield performance and victories demonstrate that he had mastered the element of surprise and was one of the great commanders of the age.<br>
