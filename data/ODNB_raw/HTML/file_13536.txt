<span class="headword">Holland,  Philip</span>  (1721&#150;1789), <span class="occ">Presbyterian minister</span>, eldest son of Thomas Holland (<i>bap</i>. 1690, <i>d</i>. 1753), dissenting minister, and Mary Savage, granddaughter of Philip Henry, was born at Wem, Shropshire. His grandfather was John Holland (<i>d</i>. 1713) of Dam Head House, Mobberly parish, Cheshire. The Hollands of Mobberly and Knutsford were local yeoman farmers and supporters of the protestant dissenting congregation that built the Brook Street Chapel at Knutsford. His father, a pupil of James Coningham, had been approved to preach by the Cheshire classis on 9 November 1711, and was ordained on 3 August 1714. About 1712, he succeeded Joseph Mottershead to the congregation at Kingsley, Cheshire, then moved to the congregation in Wem, Shropshire, around 1716&#150;17.<br>
<br>Philip Holland entered Philip Doddridge's academy in 1739. He was followed in 1744 by his brother John, who ministered to the protestant dissenting congregations at Wem, Shropshire, and Allostock, Cheshire, before conforming to the Church of England in 1763. Another brother, Henry, entered Doddridge's academy in 1751 and transferred to Daventry upon Doddridge's death. He was minister in Prescot and Ormskirk, Lancashire, where he died on 10 December 1781. Philip Holland first preached at Wolverhampton, Staffordshire and succeeded his father to the pastorate at Wem. In 1755 he became the minister of Bank Street Chapel, Bolton, Lancashire, in succession to Thomas Dixon (1721&#150;1754).<br>
<br>On 25 May 1758 Holland married his cousin, Catherine Holland (<i>b</i>. 1728) of Mobberley, the daughter of John Holland (1690&#150;1770) of Dam Head House and Mary Colthurst; she was a great-aunt of Mrs Gaskell. They had a son, Philip Henry Holland MD (<i>d</i>. 1788), and a daughter, Catherine, who married John Cole Rankin, merchant of Newcastle upon Tyne. The ministerial career of Philip's brother John Holland should not be confused with that of his wife Catherine's brother, John Holland (1720&#150;1751), who ministered in Ormskirk and at the High Pavement Chapel, Nottingham. He was called to Chowbent, Lancashire, but died before commencing his work.<br>
<br>Philip Holland's theology was that of the Arminian Presbyterian divines of his day. At Wolverhampton he is described as being more liberal than his former tutor and out of step with the majority of the congregation, &#145;who were inclined for the most part to the tenets of Calvin&#146;  (Matthews, <span class="italic">Congregational Churches</span>, 152). He was influenced by John Seddon of Warrington, who introduced him to the moral philosophy of Francis Hutcheson. He was probably an Arian by the time of his Lancashire pastorate. During the 1750s in Bolton, a number of the Bank Street congregation left because of the tenets preached by Dixon and Holland, and joined John Bennet's Methodist chapel at Duke's Alley, which became Independent in 1759.<br>
<br>Holland's congregation none the less flourished, and the chapel was enlarged in 1760. Richard Arkwright, cotton-spinning entrepreneur and pioneer of the factory system, was a member of the Bank Street congregation between 1750 and 1767. Holland ran a boarding-school in Bolton, educating, among others, Josiah Wedgwood's son. He assisted Seddon in the foundation of the Warrington Academy in 1757 and contributed to the debate over the introduction of liturgical forms into dissenting worship, writing the third service in <span class="italic">A form of prayer and a new collection of psalms, for the use of a congregation of protestant dissenters in Liverpool</span> (1763), generally known as the &#145;Liverpool liturgy&#146;. He was active in the movement to repeal (1779) the doctrinal subscription required by the <span class="roman">Toleration Act</span>, and was an advocate of independence for the American colonies. In the last decade of his life his views became somewhat more heterodox, Job Orton complaining that Holland had sunk &#145;the inspiration of the apostles and their epistles lower than I think he can justify&#146;  (Nightingale, 3.13). He published several sermons, including &#145;The importance of learning&#146; (1760), which was reprinted in the <span class="italic">English Preacher</span>, volume 9 (1773), and his <span class="italic">Sermons on Practical Subjects</span> (2 vols., 1792) was printed posthumously, edited by John Holland and William Turner. Holland died at Bolton on 2 January 1789, aged sixty-seven. A mural monument was erected to his memory in Bank Street Chapel, where his nephew <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13532/', "John Holland (1766&#150;1826)")</script> succeeded him.<br>
