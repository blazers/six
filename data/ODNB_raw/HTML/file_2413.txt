<span class="headword">Bingham,  Peregrine</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1788, <em>d.</em> 1864), <span class="occ">legal writer and reformer</span>, was baptized at Radclive, Buckinghamshire, on 19 April 1788, the eldest son of the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2412/', "Revd Peregrine Bingham (1754&#150;1826)")</script> and his wife, Amy, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Bowles. He was educated at Winchester College and at Magdalen College, Oxford (BA, 1810), admitted to the Middle Temple in London in 1811, called to the bar on 27 November 1818, and practised on the western circuit before becoming a police magistrate in London. He married in 1816 Eliza, daughter of James Bolton, a London attorney. There were two children by the marriage, a daughter and a son, named&#151;somewhat unimaginatively&#151;Eliza and Peregrine.<br>
<br>For many years Bingham compiled law reports. Between 1821 and 1840 he was solely or jointly responsible for nineteen volumes of cases. He was the author of <span class="italic">The Law and Practice of Judgments and Executions</span> (1815), <span class="italic">The Law of Infancy and Coverture</span> (1816), and <span class="italic">A Digest of the Law of Landlord and Tenant</span> (1820). His <span class="italic">System of Shorthand on the Principle of the Association of Ideas</span> (1821) failed to win adherents.<br>
<br>As a young lawyer Bingham was friendly with John Austin and Nassau Senior, both of whom had chambers at Lincoln's Inn. But the most notable and influential of his associates was the elderly Jeremy Bentham, the utilitarian philosopher and reformer. In September 1818 Bentham described Bingham as &#145;a newly acquired and most valuable disciple&#146;, who &#145;is already in possession of most of my ideas respecting morals politics and legislation&#146;, and who &#145;without effort becomes master of every thing as soon as he looks at it, and in a condition to preach it, and defend it, and apply it every where&#146;  (<span class="italic">Correspondence of Jeremy Bentham</span>, 9.261). Bingham, for his part, wrote that Bentham's work had opened his eyes. He edited Bentham's <span class="italic">Book of Fallacies</span>, which was published in 1824, and in the same year he contributed a series of articles to the <span class="italic">Westminster Review</span>, the periodical established to propagate the utilitarian message. In these pieces he emerges as a stern critic of sentimentality, a rather tiresome advocate of precise definitions, and an enthusiast for the democratic institutions of the United States. It was small wonder that John Stuart Mill, who worked with him on the <span class="italic">Westminster Review</span>, regarded Bingham as having &#145;adopted with great ardour Mr Bentham's philosophical opinions&#146;  (<span class="italic">Autobiography and Literary Essays</span>, 97).<br>
<br>Bingham went on to be co-editor of the ill-fated <span class="italic">Parliamentary History and Review</span>, which for the three years of its life (1826&#150;8) printed parliamentary debates with commentary from a radical perspective. As a member of the municipal corporations commission, which paved the way for the 1835 <span class="roman">Municipal Corporations Act</span>, he was seen as a doctrinaire Benthamite, committed to the idea of &#145;scientific legislation&#146;. There is little evidence, however, that he was influential; to the contrary, Bingham and Charles Austin, the other identifiably utilitarian commissioner, seem to have had little impact on a process that appears to have been driven primarily by party considerations. From 1840 until about 1860, Bingham was the presiding magistrate at Great Marlborough Street court, and he also held the office of recorder of Southampton. Bingham died at his home in Gordon Square, London, on 2 November 1864.<br>
