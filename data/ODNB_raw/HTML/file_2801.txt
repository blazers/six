<span class="headword">Bolton, Sir  Francis John</span>  (1831&#150;1887), <span class="occ">army officer and electrical engineer</span>, was the son of Dr Thomas Wilson Bolton, surgeon, of London and Manchester. He enlisted in the Royal Artillery and soon became a non-commissioned officer. He was commissioned ensign in the Gold Coast artillery corps on 4 September 1857, and served in the expedition against the Crobboes in 1858, being promoted lieutenant on 9 November. In 1859 he was adjutant in the successful expedition against the Dounquah rebels.<br>
<br>On his return to England Bolton was transferred to the 12th (East Suffolk) regiment, and promoted captain on 21 September 1860. For several years he co-operated with Captain P. H. Colomb RN, in developing a system of visual signalling, which was adopted by the authorities. He also invented an oxy-calcium light for night signalling. The <span class="italic">Army and Navy Signal Book</span> was compiled by Bolton and Colomb, assisted by an officer of the Royal Engineers, and was used effectively during the Abyssinian expedition. Bolton married in 1866 Julia Maria, second daughter of R. Mathews of Oatlands Park, Surrey; she survived him.<br>
<br>From 1867 to 1869 Bolton was deputy assistant quartermaster-general and assistant instructor in visual signalling at the School of Military Engineering, Chatham, under Captain Richard Hugh Stotherd, instructor in telegraphy. He was promoted on 8 July 1868 to an unattached majority for his services to army signalling.<br>
<br>Bolton was largely instrumental in 1871 in founding the Society of Telegraph Engineers and Electricians, of which he became honorary secretary. He edited the journal of the society, and was afterwards vice-president. In 1871 he was appointed by the Board of Trade under the <span class="roman">Metropolis Water Act</span> as water examiner to the metropolis, and in 1884 he published <span class="italic">London Water Supply</span>. He was promoted lieutenant-colonel on 15 June 1877, and retired from the army with the honorary rank of colonel on 1 July 1881. He was knighted in 1884.<br>
<br>Bolton interested himself in electrical matters, and a beautiful display of coloured fountains and electric lights at the exhibitions at South Kensington from 1883 to 1886 were designed by him and operated from the central tower under his personal superintendence. Bolton died on 5 January 1887 at the Royal Bath Hotel, Bournemouth, Hampshire.<br>
