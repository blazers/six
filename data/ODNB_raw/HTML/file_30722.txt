<span class="headword">Benton, Sir  John</span>  (1850&#150;1927), <span class="occ">civil engineer</span>, was born on 5 August 1850 at Sheriffhaugh, Banffshire, the second son of John Benton, of Sheriffhaugh, and his wife, Mary, daughter of Alexander Hay, of Edintore. He was educated at Aberdeen, attended lectures at the university, and in 1869 became a pupil of William Smith, a civil engineer, in Aberdeen. In 1870 he entered Edinburgh University, but in 1871 he became one of the first students of the Royal Indian Engineering College at Cooper's Hill, Englefield Green, Surrey, which was opened in that year. In 1873 he was appointed a second-grade assistant engineer in the Indian public works department, assigned to the Punjab. He was promoted to executive engineer, fourth grade, in 1881, to third grade in the same year, to second grade in 1885, and to first grade in 1892. During this period he had charge of heavy constructional work on the improvements and extensions to the network of canals irrigating the area around Lahore. Benton married, in 1885, Margaret Forsyth, daughter of Robert Dick, provost of Rothes, Moray; they had two daughters, and a son, who was killed in the First World War.<br>
<br>In 1897 Benton became a superintending engineer and his services were lent to the government of Burma. Fresh from the Punjab canals he found irrigation in Burma in a primitive state, weirs being made of stakes and stones instead of masonry and brickwork; but by originality and resource, as well as by refusing to tolerate incompetence, he effected great reforms. On the Mandalay Canal, his first work, opened in 1902, when he found that the standardized 10 foot openings could not take the amount of drift brought down by the floods, he substituted 40 foot openings, a practice which he followed later in the Shwebo and Ye-u canals, the former of which was opened in 1906. In the Thapaugaing Aqueduct, spanning a flood-swept ravine, he converted the walls into folding shutters, so that the flood water might safely sweep over the whole structure. He remodelled the canals in the Kyaukse district, and improved the Meiktila Lake works. He remained in Burma for five years, was made a chief engineer in 1900, and was created a CIE in 1902.<br>
<br>At the end of 1902 Benton returned to the Punjab in order to succeed Sidney Preston (with whom he had earlier been associated in his work there) as chief engineer and secretary to government. He retired under the age limit in August 1905, but in January 1906 he was recalled by the viceroy, Lord Curzon, and appointed, in succession to Preston, inspector-general of irrigation for all India.<br>
<br>In these later periods of service Benton undertook two projects of the greatest importance, the Triple Canals scheme and the upper Swat Valley Canal. The former doubled the fertile area in the Punjab by distributing the surplus waters of the Jhelum across the province. The scheme, sanctioned in 1905 and completed in 1917 at a cost of &pound;8 million, was the largest irrigation work hitherto carried out in India and served as an example for subsequent achievements. It was described by Benton in a paper read before the Institution of Civil Engineers in November 1915, for which he received a Telford medal.<br>
<br>Benton's second irrigation scheme was located nearer the Afghan frontier. He tapped the Swat River at Chakdara by a canal, which he carried in a tunnel more than 2 miles long, known as the Benton Tunnel, under the Malakand Pass through the mountain barrier above Dargai. This extension more than doubled the area formerly served by the Swat River Canal. The fall of 400 feet from the mouth of the tunnel into the Dargai valley provided power for the electrification of the Nowshera&#150;Dargai railway as well as for local purposes.<br>
<br>Benton was created KCIE in 1911 and retired finally in 1912. He was elected a member of the Institution of Civil Engineers in 1893, and was a member of its council from 1906 to 1908. He died at his home, Westcroft, 49 Silverdale Road, Eastbourne, Sussex, on 29 August 1927. He was survived by his wife.<br>
