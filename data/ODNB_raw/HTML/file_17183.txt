<span class="headword">Lumley, Sir  William</span>  (1769&#150;1850), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, seventh and youngest son of Richard Lumley, fourth earl of Scarbrough (<i>c</i>.1725&#150;1782), and his wife, Barbara (<i>d</i>. 22 July 1797), sister and heir of Sir George Savile, seventh baronet, of Rufford, Nottinghamshire, was born on 28 August 1769. He was educated at Eton College and in 1787 was appointed cornet in the 10th light dragoons (later hussars), in which he obtained his lieutenancy in 1791, and his troop in 1793. In 1794 he was made major in Ward's corps of foot, and on 24 May 1795 lieutenant-colonel of the 22nd light dragoons (the third of four regiments that successively bore that number). He commanded the 22nd dragoons during the Irish uprising, and on 7 June 1798 was severely wounded at Antrim, where he prevented the sack of the town by the rebels, and saved the lives of the magistrates, except Lord O'Neil. He also commanded the regiment in Egypt, where it served during the latter part of the campaign of 1801. He superintended the embarkation at Alexandria of the French garrison of Cairo. The 22nd dragoons regiment was disbanded in 1802.<br>
<br>In 1803 Lumley was appointed colonel of the 3rd battalion of the army of reserve, and thereafter he took much interest in its organization. When the army of reserve was ordered to be broken up, Lumley induced all the men of the battalion who passed the required test (400 in all) to re-engage for life service, but the authorities then changed their plans, and ordered the men to be disbanded. Lumley, who became a major-general in 1805, commanded a brigade in the London district that year; with his brigade he was afterwards at the recapture of the Cape of Good Hope in 1806, and in the operations in South America in 1806&#150;7, where he commanded the advance of the army in the landing at Maldonado and the attack on Montevideo. He also served with General Whitelocke in the disastrous attempt on Buenos Aires. He held a like position in Sicily, and commanded the light brigade, which formed the advance of Sir John Stuart's expedition to the coast of Italy in 1809, and captured Ischia. An account of the expedition, and of the situation in Sicily, is given by Sir H. E. Bunbury  (see <span class="italic">Narratives of some Passages in the Great War with France</span>, 1854).<br>
<br>Lumley joined Wellington's army in the Peninsula in 1810. He commanded the attack on the Fort Christoval side during the first siege of Badajoz, and commanded the allied cavalry with Beresford at the battle of Albuera (gold medal), and in the cavalry action at Usagre. He was invalided home in August 1811, and did not serve in the Peninsula again. He became lieutenant-general in 1814. He was governor and commander-in-chief at Bermuda from 1819 to 1825, during which time, in his <i>ex officio</i> position as &#145;ordinary&#146;, or person possessing episcopal authority in ecclesiastical matters, he had disputes with the churchwardens of the colonial parish of St George. A case arising ultimately went before Lord Chief Justice Tenterden, who expressed an opinion that if Lumley possessed the powers claimed, he had used them illegally, and a verdict, with &pound;1000 damages, was given against him.<br>
<br>Lumley was made KCB in 1815, GCB in 1831, and general in 1837. He was colonel in succession of the 3rd battalion of reserve, the Royal West Indian rangers (disbanded in 1818), the 6th Inniskilling dragoons, and the 1st King's dragoons guards, to which he was appointed in 1840. He was a groom of the bedchamber from 1812 to 1841, and in 1842 was made an extra groom-in-waiting. He married, first, on 3 October 1804, Mary, daughter of Thomas Sutherland of Ulverstone; she died in July 1807. His second marriage, on 3 March 1817, was to Louisa Margaret (<i>d</i>. 11 Sept 1859), widow of Colonel Lynch Cotton (<i>d</i>. 1799 in India) and daughter of John Robbins. Lumley had no children from either marriage. He died at his residence in Green Street, Grosvenor Square, London, on 15 December 1850.<br>
