<span class="headword">Dowling,  Vincent George</span>  (1785&#150;1852), <span class="occ">journalist</span>, was probably born in London. His father was Vincent Dowling (1756&#150;1825) of Queen's county, Ireland, a journalist, bookseller, and patent medicine vendor. Vincent George's brothers included <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7965/', "Alfred Septimus Dowling")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7967/', "Sir James Dowling")</script>. He received his early education in Ireland. He returned to London with his father early in the new century and occasionally helped him with his work on <span class="italic">The Times</span>, which Dowling senior had just joined. The younger Dowling then worked for the <span class="italic">Star</span>, contributed pieces to <span class="italic">The Observer</span> from 1804, and went to the <span class="italic">Day</span> in 1809. He was clearly building a reputation as an energetic and reliable reporter, a reputation enhanced by his eye-witness account of the assassination of Spencer Perceval in the lobby of the House of Commons on 11 May 1812, and later by his being first to arrive in London with the news that Queen Caroline was to return there from France after the accession of George IV in June 1820. His twelve-hour crossing of the channel in an open boat on a stormy night was evidence of a determined and romantic spirit. But, during the same period, Dowling also worked as a government informer. On 6 December 1816 he reported to government officials on the tone of political conversation in London public houses. He had already been employed by the government to give details of the meeting of radicals at Spa Fields on 2 December 1816, and the following year he gave evidence from that report at the trial of James Watson for treason.<br>
<br>In August 1824 Dowling was appointed editor of <span class="italic">Bell's Life in London</span>, by its new proprietor, William Clement, who also owned <span class="italic">The Observer</span>. <span class="italic">Bell's Life</span> was one of Britain's earliest and most successful sporting newspapers. It first appeared in January 1822, the property of Robert Bell, a London printer and newsvendor. It set out to depict life in London &#145;as it really was&#146;, and police intelligence was more prominent than sport in its early issues. Dowling was to remain editor for twenty-eight years, during which time <span class="italic">Bell's Life</span> became Britain's leading sporting newspaper, without which no gentleman's Sunday was quite complete. The verdict on <span class="italic">Bell's</span> of T. C. Sanders in 1856 would probably have satisfied Dowling. The paper had little vulgarity in it, &#145;it judges with a kind of solemn honesty; and it imposes laws really fair and just on a great many who very much need such laws to control them&#146;  (Sanders, 275&#150;6).<br>
<br>In 1824 the circulation of <span class="italic">Bell's Life</span> was probably less than 10,000. By the time of Dowling's death in 1852 it had been making profits estimated at &pound;10,000 a year for some time. Dowling made the paper a reliable and respectable commentator on contemporary sport. <span class="italic">Bell's</span> could be trusted so much so that it was often the stakeholder for bets and prize fights. It was estimated that between &pound;8000 and &pound;10,000 a year passed through the paper's hands in this way by the 1850s. At a time when the organizational infrastructure of most sports was embryonic, <span class="italic">Bell's</span> played an important role in the early development of modern sport. Dowling told the select committee of the House of Lords on gaming in 1844 that the popularity of all sports had increased, and that whereas he had 200 letters a week &#145;in former times, I have now 1500 or 1600&#146;  (&#145;Select committee&#146;, q. 236). He was convinced that <span class="italic">Bell's Life</span> had been instrumental in this growth of sports, even attributing the expansion of interest in cricket &#145;to the Paper of which I am the Editor &hellip; the Moment the Cricketers found themselves the Object of Attention almost every village had its Cricket Green. The Record of their Prowess in print created a desire still more to extend their Exertions and their Fame&#146;  (ibid., question 234).<br>
<br>Dowling was particularly identified with prize-fighting, which had been proscribed by law since 1750. For him it was the most manly of English sports and a means to maintain &#145;a love of fairness in single combat, and an abhorrence of the cowardly and murderous use of the knife&#146;  (<span class="italic">Bell's Life</span>). He recognized the need to restrain its excesses, supporting the Pugilistic Club in its attempts at control between 1814 and 1828, and near the end of his life helping to promote the short-lived Pugilistic Benevolent Association. He was much in demand as a referee, although his reputation for fair play did not prevent his being knocked about by &#145;roughs&#146; after Bendigo's fight with Tom Paddock in 1850. In 1840 Dowling wrote <span class="italic">Fistiana, or, The Oracle of the Ring</span>, which became a classic work on the noble art, including informative sections on fitness training and sparring. It was a book which was regularly updated and went through fourteen editions before his death. It was continued by his son <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7966/', "Frank Lewis Dowling (1823&#150;1867)")</script>, who also succeeded to the editorship of <span class="italic">Bell's</span> on his father's death, which took place at Stanmore Lodge, Kilburn, Middlesex, on 25 October 1852. Dowling had been suffering from a heart condition for two years and it was this, accompanied by paralysis and dropsy, which finally caused death. He was survived by his wife and children.<br>
