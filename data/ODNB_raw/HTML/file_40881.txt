<span class="headword">Maunder,  Edward Walter</span>  (1851&#150;1928), <span class="occ">astronomer</span>, was born at 5 Chesterfield Street, St Pancras, London, on 12 April 1851, the fourth of seven children and the youngest of the three sons of George Peter Maunder (1813&#150;1878), a Wesleyan minister, and his wife, Mary Ann, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Frid. He was educated at University College School in Gower Street and afterwards attended classes in science at King's College, London. Having been employed for a while with a bank in London, he was appointed in 1873 by civil service examination to a newly instituted post at the Royal Greenwich Observatory, that of photographic and spectroscopic assistant, with principal responsibility for the solar department.<br>
<br>In the field of solar physics Maunder extended observations beyond the required daily photography of the sun to include the positions, sizes, and movements of sunspots. His statistical analyses of these unique records after several decades led to some important results: the famous &#145;butterfly diagram&#146; demonstrating the latitude drift of sunspots during the sunspot cycle (1904) and the correlation of geomagnetic disturbances with the occurrence of individual large sunspots on the solar disc (also 1904). His later study (1922) using data from various sources of the dearth of sunspots in the sixteenth century, the so-called Maunder minimum, assumed significance later in theoretical research on the sun's variability. Maunder's work in spectroscopy, including visual measurements of radial velocities of stars made in association with W. M. Christie, was less spectacular, though useful at the time.<br>
<br>Maunder was an active fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society, to which he was elected in 1875; he served as a member of council, as secretary, and as vice-president successively between 1885 and 1897. At the same time he was an enthusiastic supporter of amateur astronomy. He was the founder in 1890 of the British Astronomical Association, the first editor of its publications, and its president from 1894 to 1896. He led a group of members on a total solar eclipse expedition to the Scandinavian Arctic in 1896 which, though frustrated by bad weather, provided valuable experience for later successful expeditions to India in 1898 and to Algeria in 1900. In his professional capacity Maunder also observed eclipses in the West Indies in 1886 and in Mauritius in 1901, obtaining photographs and spectra of the corona.<br>
<br>Maunder was the author of numerous popular articles and books and completed editing stints on the magazines <span class="italic">The Observatory</span> (1881&#150;7) and <span class="italic">Knowledge</span> (1895&#150;1904). Among his books were a history of the Greenwich observatory (1900) and <span class="italic">The Astronomy of the Bible</span> (1908, reprinted 1922), in which he brought together his extensive biblical and astronomical knowledge.<br>
<br>Maunder's first wife, Edith Hannah, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Bustin, whom he married on 11 September 1875, died in 1888 leaving him with a family of three sons and two daughters. On 28 December 1895 he married the astronomer Annie Scott Dill Russell (1868&#150;1947) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/46494/', "Maunder, Annie Scott Dill")</script>]. There were no children of this marriage. His obituarist H. P. Hollis recalled his popularity as a lecturer, with &#145;his silver tongue&#146; and &#145;his amiability of manner&#146;  (Hollis, 229), while the children of a colleague remembered him &#145;with his long beard, very much the picture-book astronomer&#146;  (M. Wilson, <span class="italic">Ninth Astronomer Royal: the Life of Frank Watson Dyson</span>, 1951). He retired in 1913 after forty years of service, but, with his wife, resumed his duties during the First World War, when many of the Greenwich staff were absent on military service. He died at his home, 8 Maze Hill, Greenwich Park, London, on 21 March 1928, one month short of his seventy-seventh birthday.<br>
