<span class="headword">O'Brien,  Daniel</span>, styled third Viscount Clare  (<em>c.</em>1630&#150;1690), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was the only son among eight children of Conor O'Brien, later second Viscount Clare (<i>c</i>.1605&#150;<i>c</i>.1670), and his wife, Honora (<i>d</i>. in or after 1701), daughter of Daniel O'Brien of Dough, co. Clare. Nothing is known of his education or early life, except that during the interregnum he served for a time in the Spanish army. He also attended the exiled Charles II, with whom he possessed sufficient influence at the Restoration to secure a peerage for his paternal grandfather, Sir Daniel O'Brien, third son of the second earl of Thomond, together with the restoration of his immense estate in co. Clare.<br>
<br>O'Brien succeeded to both title and estate upon the death of his father. His principal residence was Carrigaholt Castle on the Shannon estuary, where he strove to become &#145;the greatest breeder of horses in the king's dominions&#146;  (O'Brien, 182). He married in or before 1670 Philadelphia (<i>bap</i>. 1644, <i>d</i>. in or after 1699), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/16445/', "Francis Lennard, fourteenth Baron Dacre (1619&#150;1662)")</script>. Two sons were born of the marriage: Daniel O'Brien, styled fourth Viscount Clare (<i>c</i>.1669&#150;1693), and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20442/', "Charles O'Brien, styled fifth Viscount Clare (1670&#150;1706)")</script>.<br>
<br>The marriage of Clare's brother-in-law Thomas Lennard, fifteenth Lord Dacre and later earl of Sussex, to a bastard daughter of Charles II probably helped to influence his appointment in 1674 as colonel of a new Irish regiment in the Anglo-Dutch brigade. The following year he was accused of spying for the French and lost his command. As a Francophile and a Roman Catholic, he was disliked by the duke of Ormond, who viewed with scepticism his claim, during the Titus Oates terror, that he was a protestant who was active in hunting priests. He took the deception too far in 1681 when he organized a petition in Ireland to condemn Charles II's prorogation of the whig-dominated English parliament during the exclusion crisis. This provoked the king to order his removal from the Irish bench as a justice of the peace and from his command of a militia troop. He remained out of favour for the remainder of Charles's reign.<br>
<br>In 1689, when James II attempted to recover his lost thrones with Irish Catholic support, Clare was made an Irish privy councillor and lord lieutenant of co. Clare. In the same year he attended the Irish parliament, as did his elder son, Daniel, who represented County Clare in the Commons. Clare made a notable contribution to the enlargement of the Irish army, raising a dragoon regiment, mounted from the resources of his horse farm, and two infantry regiments commanded by his sons. He initially commanded the regiments in Cork, but his harsh treatment of the local merchants displeased James, and he was replaced in February 1690. In July he commanded his regiment on the right of the Jacobite position at the battle of the Boyne. It was alleged that his dragoons were the first to flee the scene, but later they redeemed their reputation by helping to escort the French artillery to safety. However, the setbacks of the campaign increased Clare's disillusionment with the Jacobite leadership, and in August 1690 he wrote to Louvois, who held him in some regard, begging Louis XIV to take over Ireland and win it back from William. Despite this he was a member of the military council appointed to advise the duke of Berwick, who became commander of the Irish army in September 1690.<br>
<br>Clare died on 19 or 21 November 1690, probably at Carrigaholt Castle. Having been outlawed with his sons for high treason, his estate of 30,000 acres in Clare was confiscated after the war. His son and successor, Daniel, styled fourth Viscount Clare, was wounded in action with his regiment at the battle of Marsaglia, and died at Pignerol in 1693. He in turn was succeeded by his younger brother, Charles.<br>
