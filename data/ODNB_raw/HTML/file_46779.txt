<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Brinsmead,  John</span>  (1814&#150;1908), <span class="occ">piano manufacturer</span>, was born at Weare Gifford, Devon, on 13 October 1814, the seventh son of Henry Brinsmead, an innkeeper and lime-burner, and his wife, Elizabeth, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Beer. He had left school by 1826 and at the age of thirteen was apprenticed for seven years as a cabinet-maker in Torrington, Devon. As his more famous forerunner, John Broadwood, had done in 1761, Brinsmead set out for London in 1835, walking the whole way. After a year as a journeyman piano case maker, he had saved sufficient capital in 1836 to set up his own piano making business in partnership with his elder brother Henry (<i>d</i>. 1880) on the top floor of 35 Windmill Street, off Tottenham Court Road. This was not a fruitful relationship, however, and by 1837 John Brinsmead was running his own firm with the help of one man and a boy. He married on 3 June 1837 Susan Ann, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Browne (1814/15&#150;1907), daughter of an officer in the 92nd Highlanders. They had four daughters and five sons. In 1841 the firm moved to Charlotte Street, and in 1863 to Wigmore Street. After 1870 Brinsmead constructed a large piano factory at Grafton Road, Kentish Town. He took two of his sons into partnership: Thomas James Brinsmead (1844&#150;1906) and Edgar William Brinsmead (1848&#150;1907). The latter wrote <span class="italic">The History of the Pianoforte</span> (1889).<br>
<br>In the last quarter of the nineteenth century, Brinsmead introduced and patented several improvements in the piano. Aware of the need for active advertisement and marketing of his products, which he exported as far afield as Australia, he showed them, often with success, at the various international exhibitions. In 1878, following the display of his instruments at the Paris Exhibition, he was awarded the French L&eacute;gion d'honneur. He had also by then been noted in the <span class="italic">Royal Blue Book</span>, and in 1884 his biography was recorded in <span class="italic">Fortunes Made in Business: a Series of Original Sketches</span>.<br>
<br>Such acclaim had its reward in the mounting sales of Brinsmead pianos, but also a fraudulent attempt by some family members to trade on the name, which resulted in litigation and criminal proceedings in 1898. By the turn of the century the firm had become a limited company, employing more than 200 men, and producing more pianos per year than the Broadwood company. The firm had also acquired the smaller piano making business set up in Rathbone Place by John Brinsmead's brother and former partner, Henry. Opinion is still divided on whether at this time the quality of the Brinsmead piano was better than the Broadwood, but it seems that there was little to choose between them.<br>
<br>John Brinsmead died on 17 February 1908 at his home, 16 Albert Road, Regent's Park, London, and was buried in Highgate cemetery. As the two sons whom he had taken into the business predeceased him the firm thereafter was in the hands of Brinsmead's grandson, the managing director Henry Billinghurst (1874&#150;1955). The new management &#145;demonstrated both acute xenophobia and puritanical attitudes&#146; towards the firm's workers  (Ord-Hume, 54&#150;5). As a result, the business declined, and after the First World War, in January 1920, in the face of mounting competition, general industrial unrest, a shortage of skilled labour, and poor management, the firm went bankrupt. The firm of Cramer subsequently acquired the business, and pianos were once more made under the company name of John Brinsmead Ltd, production continuing until 1960. In that year the business was taken over by Kemble Pianos, later Yamaha-Kemble, which produced pianos with the brand name of Brinsmead.<br>
