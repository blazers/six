<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Stephenson <span class="st"> [<em>married name </em>Gardner]</span>,  Elsie</span>  (1916&#150;1967), <span class="occ">nurse and relief worker</span>, the youngest of four children and only daughter of Henry Walker Stephenson (<i>d</i>. 1918), a farmer, and his wife, Ethel Watson, was born at Crawleas Farm, Merrington, in Bishop Auckland, co. Durham, on 22 January 1916. After her father's death two years later in the influenza pandemic that swept through Europe, the family relocated to Newmarket, where her brothers found employment in the racing stables; one became a jockey. Elsie was educated at Newmarket grammar school (1926&#150;33) but did not distinguish herself academically. After helping her mother with &#145;home duties&#146;, she started general nurse training at the West Suffolk Hospital, Bury St Edmunds. This was followed by midwifery training at Queen Charlotte's Maternity Hospital, London, and she then took a fever nursing certificate at the Ipswich Isolation Hospital. By 1941 she had moved to Newcastle upon Tyne to undertake a health visitor's course. On completion of this, she was very well qualified professionally and had found her true vocation in the field of public health. She returned to Suffolk to practise as a health visitor from 1942 to 1944.<br>
<br>Elsie had been a member of the British Red Cross Society (BRCS) since her schooldays, and it was with the BRCS that she took a different career path in the closing years of the Second World War. Her contribution to the war effort took the form of civil relief work. By the spring of 1944 she had been posted to Cairo, where the BRCS, along with its American and Greek counterparts, the Egyptian Red Crescent, and the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, had teams of workers standing by to assuage the sufferings of the thousands of refugees who had fled their homelands of Italy, Greece, and Yugoslavia as the German army retreated and the allies advanced. Between 1944 and 1945 Elsie was posted to various camps in Egypt, Italy, and Yugoslavia. Whether in hutted hospitals or under canvas she gave nursing care, set up mother and child welfare clinics, and taught mothercraft and hygiene, often in circumstances far from ideal. Meeting the needs of polyglot groups from differing cultures presented a considerable challenge. From these experiences she gained an insight into humankind under duress, from which in turn she developed a breadth of vision that widened her perception of human nature. For her services Elsie was awarded the Italian star and the defence medal, and was admitted to the order of St John of Jerusalem as a serving sister.<br>
<br>Following the cessation of hostilities in Europe in 1945, Elsie went home for a brief respite but was soon off again, having joined the mobile hospital no. 5 BRCS as a senior sister in November of that year. Further relief work at Bad M&uuml;nden in Germany followed. The post-war objectives of the BRCS and other agencies included the relief of famine and the provision of shelter and clean water supplies, in addition to the immediate care of patients suffering from the effects of extreme deprivation. This was a harrowing period, as many of the patients had been either concentration-camp inmates or prisoners of war. Nevertheless Elsie fulfilled her obligations with her usual warmth and aplomb. Later, on the invitation of Civilian Relief Overseas, she joined a child welfare team in Berlin. The purpose of this team was to contribute to the city's rehabilitation by aiding mothers and children, thereby helping to stabilize an environment in which food was scarce and diseases such as typhoid were rife. This ten-week tour of duty in Berlin was, however, only a partial success, the project being hampered in its efforts by conflicting directives issued by the four occupying powers (the United States, Britain, France, and the USSR).<br>
<br>By Christmas 1946 Elsie was home for rest and recuperation. Early in 1947 she was awarded a Florence Nightingale International Foundation scholarship to study at the University of Toronto, and she was awarded a certificate in advanced public health nursing in June that year. Her first in-depth experience of academic life provided opportunities to deepen her knowledge and at the same time forge further international friendships. During her stay in Toronto she took note of the fact that the university had offered a bachelor of science degree in nursing since 1942. While degree courses for nurses were then unknown in Britain, they had been well established in the United States and Canada since the 1920s. The Toronto degree for nurses made a profound impression on her and was to have implications for the future.<br>
<br>Links with the BRCS were maintained in the interim. In 1947 Elsie was again travelling on its behalf, this time as a senior nurse consultant. She moved from Germany to the Middle and Far East, advising on welfare organization, disease prevention, general hygiene, and midwifery teaching. This tour culminated in her attendance at the International Red Cross Conference held in Stockholm in August 1948. Overall, she added to her already vast stock of knowledge of health-care matters and was able to hone her communication and negotiating skills.<br>
<br>Elsie returned home in 1948 to take charge of health visiting in east Suffolk under the new National Health Service. By 1950 she had returned to a similar post in Newcastle. Here she became involved in a major research project, published in 1956 as the Jameson report and entitled <span class="italic">An Inquiry into Health Visiting</span>. This report ultimately paved the way for reform of health visiting.<br>
<br>Elsie's next career move was the surprising transition from public health into academia. In 1955, in agreement with the Scottish Department of Health, the General Nursing Council for Scotland, and the Royal College of Nursing Scottish board, supported by a grant of &pound;30,000 from the Rockefeller Foundation New York, the University of Edinburgh established a department of nursing studies, the first of its kind in Europe. Elsie was appointed director and began work in her new post in June 1956. The reasons why she left public health remain obscure; possibly she felt that nurses should be better educated in order to keep abreast of changes in health care and that this was an area in which she could lead&#151;and there is no doubt that at this juncture Elsie Stephenson emerged as a leader among nurses. During her period of tenure, the position of the department of nursing studies was secured and developed. The first courses offered were certificates in nursing education and administration (both at advanced level) for nurse tutors and aspiring matrons. In 1964 a first degree-course in nursing was established, and in the same year an international school for overseas students was also set up, supported by the World Health Organization, which funded scholarships for nurses from over the globe. Elsie was keen to promote research, which was part of the agreement with the Rockefeller Foundation. The first PhD graduates successfully defended their theses in 1959.<br>
<br>On 14 November 1964 Elsie married a widower, William Henry Gardner (1895&#150;1977), son of William John Gardner, a printer. Her husband was a retired assistant under-secretary in the War Office, whom she had met at the Stockholm Red Cross conference. In addition to her Red Cross connections, Elsie was elected a fellow of the Royal Society of Health in 1956 and was an editor of the <span class="italic">International Journal of Nursing Studies</span>. She died from lung cancer in the City Hospital, Edinburgh, on 16 July 1967. Her body was bequeathed to medical research and the final remains were interred at Walthamstow. Her name is commemorated by the Elsie Stephenson memorial lecture, hosted by the department of nursing studies in the University of Edinburgh.<br>
<br>It is apparent that among Elsie Stephenson's characteristics was an outstanding ability to embrace change, to face stiff opposition with courage, and to reconcile seemingly implacable forces: &#145;Conflicts are inevitable &hellip; Do not be afraid of them. What matters is how one deals with them&#146;  (Allan, 152&#150;3). She combined her political skills with a deep Christian faith, warmth, and enthusiasm for the task in hand. If her boundless panache was occasionally overwhelming she may be forgiven in the light of all that she achieved.<br>
