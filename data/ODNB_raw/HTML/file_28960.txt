<span class="headword">Wedderburn, Sir  John</span>, fifth baronet  (1704&#150;1746), <span class="occ">Jacobite army officer</span>, son of Sir Alexander Wedderburn, fourth baronet (1675&#150;1741), and Katherine, daughter of John Scott, was born on 4 August 1704. After his father was deprived of the clerkship of Dundee in 1717, the family fell on hard times and began selling off parts of the estate, although Wedderburn worked as a factor on the Forfar estates of the duke of Douglas. In 1724 he married Jean, daughter of John Fullerton of that ilk, and they had seven surviving children. He succeeded to the baronetcy on his father's death in September 1741, but had to sell part of his estate that year for debts. In 1745 he collected excise for the rebels in Perth and Forfar, as well as joining as a volunteer in Lord Ogilvy's regiment, serving at Falkirk, Stirling, and Culloden, where he was captured on 16 April 1746. His eldest son, John, who served as a standard-bearer, escaped to France with the help of relatives.<br>
<br>Held at Inverness, Wedderburn was transported on the <i>Exeter</i> to London's new gaol at Southwark, where he was tried for treason on 4 November 1746. Although he claimed that he had been forced out and his property stolen by the rebels&#151;and presented witnesses to that effect&#151;the justices ruled that his collection of the excise tax for rebel use, attested by receipts signed by him, sufficed as the overt action needed to prove treason. When he was found guilty, his estate of Blackness, Forfarshire, and his title were forfeited, and he was sentenced to death. Before his execution he wrote to his wife, instructing her to raise their children in the Church of England and in loyalty to the Jacobite cause, and to Charles Edward Stuart, entrusting his family to the Pretender's care. He was executed by hanging on Kennington Common on 28 November 1746.<br>
