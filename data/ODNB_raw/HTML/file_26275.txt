<span class="headword">Stanley, Sir  John</span>  (<em>c.</em>1350&#150;1414), <span class="occ">soldier and administrator</span>, was a younger son of William Stanley of Storeton, Cheshire, and Alice, daughter of Hugh Mascy of Timperley, Cheshire. He made his name as a soldier in the French wars, and achieved eminence as lieutenant of Ireland and steward of the household of Henry IV.<br>
<br>The earliest records of John Stanley relate to his involvement, in the company of his elder brother William, in a forced entry at Thurstaston Hall in 1369 and in the murder of Thomas Clotton in 1376. As bailiffs of the Forest of Wirral, his father and elder brother were notorious for their oppressive tactics, which in turn prompted men in the district to petition for the disafforestation of Wirral in 1376. Even before his outlawry after the murder of Clotton, Stanley, like so many Cheshire gentlemen at the time, had sought his fortune in the French wars. A pardon in 1378, at the instance of Sir Thomas Trivet, in whose company he was setting out, referred to earlier service in Aquitaine. A later ballad tradition alleges participation in the <i>chevauch&eacute;e</i> of Sir Robert Knolles, another famous Cheshire soldier, in 1372.<br>
<br>By 1385 Stanley was clearly a soldier of some standing. In this year he secured, in the face of opposition from John of Gaunt, duke of Lancaster, the hand and inheritance of Isabel, daughter and heir of Sir Thomas Lathom of Lathom and Knowsley in south-west Lancashire. In 1386 he was in the service of Richard II's favourite, Robert de Vere, duke of Ireland, who appointed him his deputy in Ireland. The two events set the pattern of his career: dynastic aggrandizement in his native north-west, and a distinctive role in the royal service which involved providing the military muscle for maintaining English rule in Ireland and enhancing the power of the court party.<br>
<br>In harness in Ireland, Stanley was fortunate to avoid involvement in de Vere's royalist rising in 1387 which ended in defeat at Radcot Bridge and the assault on the king's party in the Merciless Parliament early in 1388. On Richard II's resumption of power in 1389 he was appointed justiciar of Ireland, a post he held until 1391. His experience, martial and administrative, was put to good use in the king's first expedition to Ireland in 1394&#150;5. A continuing political role, however, is suggested by his dispatch from court in 1393 to treat with the &#145;loyalist&#146; rebels in Cheshire, many of whom were recruited for service in Ireland. Likewise his appointment as controller of the wardrobe in October 1397 was linked with the development of the king's Cheshire bodyguard. He also served as captain of Roxburgh from 1396 to 1398. Needless to say, he accompanied Richard II to Ireland in 1399, returning with him, or perhaps in advance of him, to organize resistance to Henry Bolingbroke. His submission to the latter at Shrewsbury in August must be regarded as an act of betrayal. Still he remembered Richard II as well as Henry IV when, shortly before his own final departure for Ireland in 1413, he endowed masses for the souls of his parents and benefactors.<br>
<br>Stanley's value to the Lancastrian regime was clear. He was granted the lordships of Mold and Hope in the Welsh marches, and dispatched to Ireland to serve a term as lieutenant there. In 1403 he was appointed steward of the household of Henry, prince of Wales, playing a role both in the military education of the young prince and in the recruitment of his retinue at the time of the Glyn D&#373;r rebellion. His commitment to the Lancastrian dynasty was tested in 1403 when so many of the Cheshire gentry joined the rebellion of the Percys. Wounded in the throat at the battle of Shrewsbury, the hardbitten soldier reputedly would have little truck with his compatriots. Asked by the king's messenger what should be done with Cheshire he said, with a rattling in the throat, &#145;burn and slay, burn and slay&#146;  (<span class="italic">Brut: England</span>, 2.549). There can be little doubt, however, that his position in the royal household provided important avenues of reconciliation for the gentry of the north-west.<br>
<br>Stanley's career reached its peak in the aftermath of the Percys' rebellion. In 1405 he was rewarded with a grant of the lordship of the Isle of Man, forfeited by Henry Percy, earl of Northumberland, which gave his lineage a crown. Around the same time he became steward of the king's household, and secured election as a knight of the Garter. In 1409 he was appointed constable of Windsor Castle. At the beginning of Henry V's reign (1413) he served again as lieutenant of Ireland. The Connacht annalist regarded him as a ruthless and grasping soldier who hated the Gaels, and his death at Ardee in Louth in 1414 was attributed to the &#145;venom&#146; of the bards.<br>
<br>Stanley built up a considerable estate in Lancashire, his native Cheshire, and further afield in Ireland and the Isle of Man. The manors of Lathom and Knowsley, his wife's inheritance, were to remain the main seats of his descendants, the earls of Derby, but he himself probably spent little time at home. He built a crenellated house at Liverpool, doubtless planned as a centre of operations for his Manx and Irish interests. His rapid territorial aggrandizement was a disruptive influence in the region, but his military career and connections with court provided a basis for regional leadership. This position of aristocratic pre-eminence was consolidated by his son and namesake, the second John Stanley (<i>d</i>. 1437), of Lathom, the father of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26278/', "Thomas Stanley, first Baron Stanley (d. 1459)")</script>. Given his origins in the &#145;wilderness of Wirral&#146; and his status as a knight of the Garter, the first Sir John Stanley is sometimes associated with the patronage of <span class="italic">Sir Gawain and the Green Knight</span>, an alliterative poem in the dialect of the north-west midlands.<br>
