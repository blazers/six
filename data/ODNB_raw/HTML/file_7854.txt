<span class="headword">Doughtie,  John</span>  (1598?&#150;1672), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and religious writer</span>, was born at Martley, near Worcester, perhaps in 1598 as asserted by Anthony Wood and indicated by his supposed age at death, but his ordination suggests an earlier date. Educated at Worcester grammar school, on 30 April 1613 he matriculated from Brasenose College, Oxford. He graduated BA on 4 November 1616, having been ordained the previous February and acquired the living of Wood Norton, Norfolk, in April. Elected to a fellowship at Merton College in 1619 he proceeded MA in 1623.<br>
<br>Doughtie's early writings reveal criticism of harder line Calvinism but fear of disruption of the church by Arminian innovation. In two sermons of 1628 he generally sided with Calvinists concerning doctrine and popery but, fearing schism, called for silence from dissenters. Opposed to innovation in doctrine or rite he blamed Arminius for the current doctrinal challenge, which he thought might mask popery, still the real danger. However, he may have given comfort to English anti-Calvinists by situating England's orthodox religion &#145;betwixt papistry and semi-Pelagianism&#146;  (<span class="italic">Hist. U. Oxf.</span> 4: <span class="italic">17th-cent. Oxf.</span>, 584), by doubting the possibility of certainty in religion (specifically concerning reprobation) and by arguing (like James I had done) that it was better to avoid public discussion of central points of faith if it meant disturbance in the church. He also emphasized reform of the individual's will and life rather than minute examination of the first decree as a better guide to assurance. His <span class="italic">A Discourse Concerning the Abstruseness of Divine Mysteries</span> (1629), dedicated to Sir Nathaniel Brent, warden of Merton, was the last work containing Calvinist statements to be published in Oxford until the 1640s.<br>
<br>In 1631 Doughtie served as proctor, but in August he was made to resign by royal order after hearing an appeal from the decision of the vice-chancellor. From that year he may have been rector of Rushock, Worcestershire; Wood suggests that he was chaplain to the earl of Northumberland about this time. He was presented to the Warwickshire livings of Lapworth and Beaudesert in 1634 and 1636 respectively. In 1640 some Lapworth parishioners petitioned the House of Lords against Doughtie's alleged neglect and his supposed favouring of popery and approval of the new canons. By 1646 he had been sequestrated from both livings. That September the committee for plundered ministers ordered the payment of fifths for Lapworth to his wife, Katherine, of whom nothing else is known. John Walker claimed that Doughtie went to Oxford, then to Salisbury, where he became lecturer at St Edmund's through the patronage of Brian Duppa, and finally to London, to the home of Sir Nathaniel Brent.<br>
<br>Doughtie's later publications, such as <span class="italic">The King's Cause Rationally, Briefly and Plainly Debated</span> (1644), illustrate his increasing dedication to divine right or absolutist monarchy and to an ecclesiology defined by an Erastian episcopacy. A monarch, having received authority directly from God, could acknowledge no superior force on earth. Representative assemblies received their authority from subjects and were therefore inherently of inferior status. Employing Ptolemaic imagery Doughtie set the king above the three estates of the realm. Disobedience to a lawful prince led to civil wars as providential punishment. While Charles had &#145;somewhat swerved from the known Dictates of the Law&#146;, he had not attempted either tyranny or idolatry. Doughtie insisted that Charles had protected both religion and property. His earlier anti-popery changed here to a denunciation of the &#145;Popish Legend&#146; and of the sedition it occasioned. Here and in later works, <span class="italic">Velitationes polemicae</span> (1651) and <span class="italic">Analecta sacra</span> (1658), Doughtie condemned both presbyterianism and Independency and defended the structures and practices of the Church of England and of an absolutist political authority. Monarchs properly possessed the right of coercive discipline in matters of public belief and church organization. Thus prelacy, while not scripturally mandated, had to be accepted because established by law. Monarchs should obey the law but were not accountable to it. Even illegitimate authority in a state commanded a &#145;submissive manner of conversation&#146; save on matters of conscience.<br>
<br>In 1660 Doughtie's petition to secure the profits of his Warwickshire livings was not granted. Installed as prebendary in Westminster Abbey in July he proceeded DD on 19 October. In 1662 he was instituted to Cheam. Wood ascribes mental unsoundness to his later years. He died on 25 December 1672, said to be aged seventy-five, and was buried in Westminster Abbey.<br>
