<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Lyell, Sir  Charles</span>, first baronet  (1797&#150;1875), <span class="occ">geologist</span>, was born at Kinnordy House, Kirriemuir, Forfarshire, on 14 November 1797, the eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17242/', "Charles Lyell (1769&#150;1849)")</script> and Frances Smith (1773/4&#150;1850). A few months later his parents left the family estate and moved to the south of England, renting Bartley Lodge near Lyndhurst, Hampshire.<h2>
<a name="Educationandearlyresearch"></a>Education and early research</h2>Lyell was educated at private schools, latterly in Midhurst, Sussex. As a boy living in the New Forest, he developed an enthusiasm for natural history; as an undergraduate at Oxford, those interests focused on geology. He entered Exeter College as a fellow-commoner in 1816, and attended the lectures on mineralogy and geology by William Buckland in three successive years. Geology, in his father's opinion, was at least &#145;rational and gentlemanlike&#146;  (Wilson, <span class="italic">Charles Lyell</span>, 44), even if it distracted his son from more serious studies. However, Lyell graduated BA in 1819 with a respectable second class in classical honours (MA in 1821), and entered Lincoln's Inn to prepare for a legal career. As an aspiring young man of science he also joined the Geological and Linnean societies; Buckland was one of those who proposed him for the former.<br>
<br>While still an undergraduate Lyell had begun to look at the world with a geologist's eyes, but his serious research dates from 1821, after he met Gideon Mantell. Lyell worked on correlating Mantell's &#145;Secondary&#146; formations in Sussex with those further west. He also studied in Hampshire the still younger &#145;Tertiary&#146; formations, above the distinctive Chalk: Thomas Webster had claimed that those in the Isle of Wight were similar to those that Georges Cuvier (1769&#150;1832) and Alexandre Brongniart (1770&#150;1847) had famously described around Paris. In short, Lyell worked on the kind of geology (later termed stratigraphy) on which the leading members of the Geological Society were then engaged.<br>
<br>Lyell was called to the bar in 1822, but geology was becoming more important to him than the law. In 1823 he was elected a secretary of the Geological Society of London, and he spent that summer in Paris, making himself known in scientific circles and improving his command of the then premier language of science. He met established figures such as Cuvier and Brongniart, and the latter's former student Constant Pr&eacute;vost (1787&#150;1856) showed him the formations of the Paris basin. Conversely, Lyell explained to the French geologists the field evidence for the sudden &#145;geological deluge&#146; that Buckland, following Cuvier, had recently invoked to account for the puzzling &#145;diluvial&#146; deposits in England.<br>
<br>However, Pr&eacute;vost convinced Lyell that the Parisian formations could have been deposited under conditions similar to those in present seas and lakes, and that Cuvier and Brongniart had been too quick to dismiss such close analogies: the rocks might be due to &#145;actual&#146; or &#145;modern causes&#146;, or processes observably active in the present world. In the summer of 1824, after taking Pr&eacute;vost on a tour of southern England, Lyell followed his lead. Staying at Kinnordy, he studied the sediments deposited in a small lake that had recently been drained. In his first scientific paper, read at the Geological Society that winter, he claimed that those modern lake deposits were closely similar to some of the Parisian rocks, so that there was no sharp contrast between the &#145;former world&#146; and the present. This paper was the model for all Lyell's later work in geology: modern causes were, he claimed, adequate to explain all the traces of the remote past.<br>
<br>By 1825 Lyell's father was evidently displeased at his son's failure to establish himself in a successful legal career, and in 1826 Lyell did spend more time on legal work in London and in the west of England; however, it was in that year that his parents moved back to Kinnordy, so that the paternal presence became more remote. Lyell resigned as secretary of the Geological Society, but was promptly appointed foreign secretary instead; he was also elected a fellow of the Royal Society. Having joined the new Athenaeum in 1824, he was becoming known in intellectual circles well beyond those of the geologists. In 1825 John Murray invited him to write for the tory <span class="italic">Quarterly Review</span>, despite his known whig sympathies; this offered Lyell a much-needed new source of income to supplement his modest allowance. He used his essays with gentlemanly tact to advocate among leading tories the cause of moderate reform: he criticized the lack of government support for the sciences, and the unreformed state of the ancient universities; in particular, he criticized the clerical domination of higher education in England.<h2>
<a name="OriginsofthePrinciplesofGeology"></a>Origins of the Principles of Geology</h2>In 1826 an essay in the <span class="italic">Quarterly Review</span> on the Geological Society's publications enabled Lyell to promote his favourite science, and he praised the society for having replaced the earlier vogue for speculative theorizing with an emphasis on careful observation. Lyell accepted the common view that more complex living organisms had appeared on earth in the course of time, as the earth had slowly cooled, but he also argued that modern causes might account for far more than most geologists allowed; in this respect his views were now diverging from those of Buckland and others at the Geological Society. He began to plan an introductory book that would expound his emerging conception of the science: geology would only become scientific, he believed, if it were based on modern causes, because they alone could be witnessed directly and therefore be known to be &#145;true causes&#146; (&#145;verae causae&#146;).<br>
<br>In 1827, while working as a barrister on the western circuit, Lyell read and was fascinated by the evolutionary speculations of Jean Baptiste de Lamarck (1744&#150;1829), realizing that the mutability of species&#151;if established&#151;would affect geology as much as the sciences of life. But Lyell recoiled from the implications of Lamarck's ideas for the dignity of man, and he saw that the fossil evidence for progression in the history of life could easily be turned into an argument for evolution. He began to claim by contrast that the fossil record was by its nature too imperfect to support that notion, and that the physical world was a stable balanced system like that advocated earlier by James Hutton and John Playfair.<br>
<br>Lyell's essays for the <span class="italic">Quarterly</span> culminated in 1827 in a long review of a new book on French geology by his friend George Scrope. Lyell agreed with Scrope that &#145;Time! Time! Time!&#146; was needed in geological explanation, and that there had been no abrupt catastrophe in the geologically recent past; the book suggested to him that the &#145;lost links in the great chain that unites the present with the past&#146;  (<span class="italic">Quarterly Review</span>, 36, 1827, 443) might still be preserved in Auvergne. In 1828 he joined Roderick Murchison for a fieldwork tour on the continent, and after discussions with Pr&eacute;vost and other Parisians they went straight to Auvergne. Lyell was duly impressed by Scrope's evidence and agreed with his conclusions. Later, in Italy, Lyell developed a rough timescale for the most recent era of the earth's history, as represented by the Tertiary formations. He used the expertise of local naturalists to count the number of fossil species that were known to be still living in present seas, inferring that the percentage would be inversely proportional to the age of each formation. This assumed that new species had somehow appeared, and older ones become extinct, at roughly constant rates, uninterrupted by any catastrophic events. The probabilistic basis of this idea is likely to have been derived from contemporary debates in political economy; certainly Lyell expounded it later in terms of an analogy with changing human populations.<br>
<br>As he travelled alone through Italy into Sicily (Murchison and his wife had returned to England), Lyell believed his hypothesis was confirmed. In the vicinity of active volcanoes such as Vesuvius and Etna, he found putatively recent formations (with a high percentage of extant species) far above sea level, just as he expected if crustal elevation were causally linked to volcanic activity. In Sicily thick formations of this kind underlay the huge cone of Etna, which in turn appeared to be extremely ancient in relation to human records of its more recent eruptions. In effect, Etna and the recent formations beneath it linked Lyell's geological timescale to the timescale of human history, confirming Scrope's inference about the vast time available for modern causes to have had their effects. After leaving Sicily early in 1829 Lyell reported to Murchison how his forthcoming book would expound the true principles of geology: modern causes, acting at their present intensities, were adequate to explain all the observed traces of the remote past. In Paris, on his way back to England, he found that Gerard Deshayes (1797&#150;1875), an expert on fossil molluscs, had pre-empted his ideas on the Tertiary formations; but Lyell turned this to his advantage by paying Deshayes to identify all his fossils and to integrate the results into Deshayes's much wider survey. Back in London, Lyell expounded his views at the Geological Society, and revised his earlier drafts into a far more ambitious publication.<h2>
<a name="Publicationandfirstreactions"></a>Publication and first reactions</h2>The first volume of Lyell's <span class="italic">Principles of Geology</span> was published by Murray in July 1830. Its ambitions were clear from the title&#151;&#145;Principles&#146; still recalled Isaac Newton's <span class="italic">Principia</span>&#151;and the subtitle stated clearly that it was &#145;an attempt to explain the former changes of the earth's surface, by reference to causes now in operation&#146;. Surprisingly for a work on geology, the volume was devoted not to the remote past but wholly to the present world. Lyell gave a systematic description of modern causes such as volcanoes and earthquakes, sedimentation and erosion, culled from a wide range of sources, including many accounts of voyages and expeditions to remote parts of the globe; however, his main source was the great compilation of the physical and topographical changes recorded within human history, published in 1822&#150;4 by Karl von Hoff (1771&#150;1837)&#151;Lyell had learned German specifically in order to read it. He used Hoff's data to illustrate his own view of the earth as a system of balanced antagonistic processes: erosion balanced by sedimentation, for example, and crustal elevation by crustal subsidence. A preliminary section of the book presented a &#145;grand new theory of climate&#146;  (Lyell, <span class="italic">Life</span>, 1.261), which interpreted long-term climatic changes as the products of an ever-changing physical geography: this neatly undercut what Lyell himself had earlier regarded as conclusive evidence for a slowly cooling earth.<br>
<br>The volume began, however, with a forceful criticism of other geologists, thinly disguised as a history of geology itself. Lyell presented the history of the science as a long battle between views similar to his own, and those that arbitrarily invoked catastrophes at every turn; his own emphasis on the &#145;uniformity&#146; of nature was treated as synonymous with being truly scientific. Furthermore, Lyell virtually equated his opponents with the many authors who were claiming scriptural authority for limiting the timescale of the earth's history to a few thousand years. In effect, geologists such as Buckland, who did indeed identify the &#145;geological deluge&#146; as the biblical flood, but who assumed unlimited time for the still earlier history of the earth, were treated by Lyell as no better than the &#145;scriptural&#146; writers&#151;despite the fact that it was Buckland who had urged Lyell to use his review of Scrope as an opportunity to attack the literalists.<br>
<br>In effect, Lyell was fighting on two fronts: against most other geologists, who doubted the total adequacy of modern causes for understanding the past; and against much wider social groups, who still treated the biblical narratives of creation and the flood as literal history, untouched by the biblical criticism taken for granted on the continent. Lyell wanted not only to make geology truly scientific, but also, as he put it privately, &#145;to free the science from Moses&#146;  (Lyell, <span class="italic">Life</span>, 1.268). That wider aim accounts for the great interest and attention that the <span class="italic">Principles</span> received immediately, at least in Britain, not only among men of science but also among the general educated public. The more scientific reviews were mixed: Lyell's claim that the power of modern causes had been underestimated was found important and even persuasive, but his criticisms of other geologists were regarded as grossly unfair; above all, his scepticism about organic progression was considered utterly unconvincing.<br>
<br>In 1831 Lyell was appointed professor of geology at the new King's College in London. Among the clergymen on its governing body, Edward Copleston was worried by Lyell's opinions on the creation of man and the flood, but the rest were not. Lyell lectured at King's in 1832 and 1833; in the latter year he gave similar lectures at the Royal Institution, to which women were admitted, thus swelling his audience and his fees. But Lyell found this work brought him too little income to justify the distraction from his writing, and he resigned from King's and gave no further courses at the Royal Institution.<br>
<br>Lyell had spent the summer of 1831 on fieldwork in Germany; while there he had met the 23-year-old Mary Horner, eldest daughter of the whig reformer and geologist <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13803/', "Leonard Horner")</script>. They were married in Bonn on 12 July 1832; after a geological honeymoon, they settled in Hart Street, Bloomsbury, close to the British Museum and to the Geological Society's premises in Somerset House. Mary was well educated, and fluent in French and German, and was soon helping Lyell with translation, and offsetting his handicap of poor eyesight for reading. However, she seems to have been somewhat excluded from the scientific conversation at their dinner parties. A few years later, after one such occasion, Charles Darwin&#151;himself soon to be married&#151;commented tartly, &#145;I want <i>practice</i> in ill treating the female sex&#151;I did not observe Lyell had any compunction&#146;  (<span class="italic">Correspondence</span>, 2.166). When, a little later, Emma Darwin gave their first dinner party, she recorded that &#145;Mr Lyell is enough to flatten a party, as he never speaks above his breath, so that everybody keeps lowering their tone to his&#146;  (Wilson, <span class="italic">Charles Lyell</span>, 459). There were no children of the Lyells' marriage.<br>
<br>The second volume of the <span class="italic">Principles</span> appeared in 1832; it dealt with modern causes in the organic realm, and particularly with the relation between organisms and their environments. Lyell rejected Lamarck's theory of the incessant mutability of species, arguing instead that they were real stable entities, and that they appeared and became extinct in a piecemeal manner in time and space. Extinctions were attributed not to sudden catastrophes but to gradual changes in the environment, as expounded in the first volume; the origins of species were attributed implicitly to some equally natural process as yet unknown. In an incisive review of this volume, William Whewell coined the terms &#145;uniformitarian&#146; and &#145;catastrophist&#146; for two opposing sects among geologists, but at the time there were few if any full-blooded uniformitarians apart from Lyell himself.<br>
<br>Lyell's concept of the stability of individual species validated his timescale for the Tertiary era, which formed a cornerstone of the third and culminating volume of the <span class="italic">Principles</span> (1833). His review of modern causes, both inorganic and organic, had merely provided the &#145;alphabet and grammar&#146; of geology  (<span class="italic">Principles of Geology</span>, 3.7); they were the means by which nature's historical records could be deciphered, in order to reconstruct the course of earth history. Lyell used Deshayes's massive lists of fossil species to arrange the Tertiary formations in inferred chronological order. Based on the increasing proportions of &#145;recent&#146; species, Whewell proposed to Lyell the Greek-based names &#145;Eocene&#146;, &#145;Miocene&#146;, and &#145;Pliocene&#146;; Lyell split the last into &#145;Older&#146; and &#145;Newer&#146; parts, thus defining four successive periods of Tertiary time. He reviewed the evidence for the state of the earth during each period in turn, beginning nearest to the directly observable present and working backwards into the more obscure past. He claimed that the whole Tertiary era of earth history proved the earth's essential uniformity through time; the still older formations were discussed much more briefly. The alleged evidence for radically different conditions in the earliest era of all was eliminated by Lyell's concept of &#145;metamorphism&#146;&#151;deep burial in the earth's crust had altered the oldest rocks beyond recognition and destroyed their fossils, and they were not really &#145;Primary&#146; at all. Lyell therefore concluded that Hutton had been right to argue that the earth showed no signs of a beginning or an end to its stability, although he denied that this implied that the natural world was eternal or uncreated.<h2>
<a name="Criticismandfurthereditions"></a>Criticism and further editions</h2>By the time the last volume of <span class="italic">Principles</span> was published, Lyell had already produced second editions of the first two. Cheaper editions of the whole work followed in 1834, 1835, and 1837, each revising his argument in the light of critical reviews and new publications. In 1834 Lyell travelled in Scandinavia, and became convinced that the land around the Baltic had indeed risen insensibly slowly and without earthquakes, even within recorded history. He presented this work&#151;a fine example of his claims about modern causes&#151;as his Bakerian lecture at the Royal Society later in 1834; at the same time he was awarded the society's royal medal, but explicitly for his work on modern causes and their application to the Tertiary formations, rather than for his more controversial claims. The citation reflected the balance of opinion among leading geologists; even Pr&eacute;vost and Scrope, Lyell's strong supporters on the power of modern causes and the redundancy of catastrophes, criticized their friend's rejection of a broadly directional history for the earth. Other critics pointed to Lyell's apparent inconsistency, in conceding that the human species was very recent while denying all other signs of organic progression. So when Darwin, who had read the <span class="italic">Principles</span> on his voyage round the world, settled in London in 1836 and proved to have closely similar geological ideas, Lyell soon treated his younger colleague as his closest ally.<br>
<br>Lyell served as president of the Geological Society in 1835&#150;7, and used his anniversary addresses to evaluate current research in the light of his own approach to the science. His emphasis on modern causes made steady headway among geologists, but other aspects of his work did not. His percentage timescale, for example, was criticized by those with more expert knowledge of Tertiary fossils: the names for the Tertiary periods survived, but Lyell was forced to weaken their statistical basis, until his use of fossils was almost indistinguishable from that of other geologists. The mixed reception of his ideas was reflected in his decision to divide his work into two distinct parts: from the sixth edition (1840) onwards, the <span class="italic">Principles</span> became purely a treatise on modern causes and their balanced interactions. Lyell planned a separate book on the use of fossil molluscs in Tertiary geology, but such a work never appeared.<br>
<br>Lyell did return to his original plan for a book that would explain his conception of geology at an introductory level, and thereby propagate it more widely. <span class="italic">Elements of Geology</span> (1838) reviewed the whole stratigraphical record, from the most recent formations back to the most ancient, interpreting it in terms of the &#145;uniformity&#146; of terrestrial processes through time. The second edition (1841) was greatly expanded, incorporating the treatment of the Tertiary formations that had now been excised from the <span class="italic">Principles</span>. Both <span class="italic">Elements</span> and <span class="italic">Principles</span> were successful and popular works, as their publishing history shows. Appropriately for a barrister, Lyell wrote stylishly and persuasively, and explained technicalities clearly; his books reached a wide audience of the educated public, far beyond those who were actively engaged in geology. French and German translations, and American editions, made his approach well known throughout the scientific world.<h2>
<a name="Latergeologicalwork"></a>Later geological work</h2>In 1841&#150;2 Lyell was invited to the United States and gave the Lowell lectures to a vast audience in Boston. He and his wife also travelled widely, and two volumes of <span class="italic">Travels in North America</span> (1845) recorded not only his geological observations, but also their opinions on the country's social and political problems: those opinions were liberal in respect to education, less so in the matter of slavery. They revisited America in 1845&#150;6 and he gave the Lowell lectures again; two further volumes about their travels appeared in 1849. In 1846, on their return from America, they moved to a grander house in Harley Street. By this time Lyell had become a prominent man of science, an adviser to government on scientific issues, and an associate of Prince Albert. He was knighted in 1848, and served on the Royal Commission for the Exhibition of 1851. He made two further visits to America in 1852 and 1853, on the latter occasion representing the 1851 commissioners at the Industrial Exhibition in New York.<br>
<br>The successive editions of Lyell's books were kept up to date with the latest research, but their underlying ideas changed little. When he served a second term as president of the Geological Society in 1849&#150;51 he again criticized the supposed fossil evidence for organic progression and still defended his earlier interpretation of the earth's history, although both positions had become increasingly implausible to other geologists. Lyell's last major research project was related to the resurgent theory of &#145;craters of elevation&#146;, by which the largest volcanic cones were attributed to sudden crustal elevation rather than to the slow accumulation of volcanic materials in successive eruptions. During the winter of 1853&#150;4 he countered this serious challenge with field observations on Madeira and the Canary Islands; in 1857 and 1858 he went to look again at Etna; and he persuaded Scrope to return to geology and support his case with evidence from Auvergne.<h2>
<a name="Lyellandevolution"></a>Lyell and evolution</h2>The Canaries and Madeira also brought the puzzles of endemic island faunas and floras back to Lyell's attention, and in private he wrestled once more with the possibility of an evolutionary mechanism for the origin of species. When in 1856 Darwin told him about his theory, Lyell urged him to publish it without delay, and then struggled with its implications not only for his geology but also for his view of human life. By this time he had almost abandoned his earlier nominal allegiance to the liberal wing of the Church of England; he had become <i>de facto</i> a Unitarian after seeing the role of that denomination in America. But even unitarian theology left him with acute problems about the dignity of man, if the human species had evolved from primates.<br>
<br>Two events in 1859 led to Lyell's last major publication, <span class="italic">Antiquity of Man</span> (1863). One was the research by other geologists that finally established that early human beings had lived alongside the mammoths and other extinct mammals of the glacial period, known by this time by Lyell's name, &#145;Pleistocene&#146; (formerly his &#145;Newer&#146; Pliocene). This locked the human species firmly into earth history, by extending human history far beyond the reach of textual records into a prehistory recorded only in fossil bones and stone artefacts. The bulk of Lyell's book was devoted to a rather derivative account of this research. The other event in 1859 was Darwin's publication of his <span class="italic">Origin of Species</span>. Lyell reviewed the evidence for evolution quite favourably&#151;in a section added awkwardly on to his book on prehistory&#151;but Darwin was disappointed that his old mentor failed to announce clearly his own acceptance of the theory. Only in the next (tenth) edition of the <span class="italic">Principles</span> (1867&#150;8) did Lyell give qualified approval to evolution as the true mechanism for the origin of new species, which he had left so vague thirty years earlier; the book was enlarged and recast to accommodate the change. But Lyell also had to alter his entire perspective on the history of life, finally conceding that successively higher forms of life had been formed in the course of time. He even allowed that the human species was no exception, at least in its physical aspects; but he remained sceptical about the adequacy of Darwin's theory to account for the origin of the mental and moral aspects that were most distinctively human.<h2>
<a name="Lastyears"></a>Last years</h2>Lyell had been active in the British Association since its early years, and at the meeting in Bath in 1864 he served as its president. He was created a baronet the same year, and in 1866 he received&#151;belatedly&#151;the Wollaston medal, the Geological Society's highest award. The <span class="italic">Elements</span> reached in effect its eighth edition in 1873 (it had been called a <span class="italic">Manual</span> since 1851, and the last two editions were called <span class="italic">Student's Elements</span>); the <span class="italic">Principles</span> was published, just posthumously, in a twelfth edition in 1875. Mary Lyell died on 24 April 1873, and Lyell himself less than two years later, on 22 February 1875, at their London home at 73 Harley Street. Like other leading Victorian men of science, he was buried in Westminster Abbey.<br>
