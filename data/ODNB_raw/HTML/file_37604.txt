<span class="headword">Jessop,  William</span>  (1746&#150;1814), <span class="occ">civil engineer</span>, was the son of Josias Jessop, quartermaster at the naval dockyard, Devonport, and his wife, Elizabeth Foot. The eldest of three sons and one daughter, he was born at the Foots' home in Plymouth Dock on 23 January 1746. In 1756 his father was engaged to assist John Smeaton (1724&#150;1792) in the reconstruction of the lighthouse on Eddystone Rock, some 15 miles off Plymouth, the previous structure having burnt down at the end of 1755. Smeaton came to rely heavily on Jessop senior, who took charge of the yard at Millbay where the masonry for the new lighthouse was assembled and shaped. The work was completed in 1759, and in that year Smeaton took on the young Jessop as an apprentice, to serve a &#145;clerkship&#146; with a view to becoming his draughtsman and assistant.<br>
<br>Jessop had been educated at Devonport, where he had shown a talent for French and mathematics, as well as some progress in the classics and mechanical ability. However, when he joined Smeaton he moved to Austhorpe Lodge, the Smeaton family home near Leeds, from where the engineer directed his rapidly expanding engineering practice. Smeaton did more than anybody to lay the foundations of the British engineering profession, so it was of considerable significance for Jessop that he spent his formative years in the service of this pioneer, first as an apprentice, until 1767, and then as his assistant, until 1772. In these capacities he obtained wide experience in engineering work on river navigations, canals, harbour works, and land drainage projects, which enabled him to become, on Smeaton's retirement from active engineering, the outstanding man in his profession. At the time of the &#145;canal mania&#146; in the 1790s, it was rightly said of him that with his experience and abilities he was looked upon as &#145;the first engineer of the kingdom&#146;  (Hadfield and Skempton, preface).<br>
<br>Jessop was a resourceful but cautious engineer, with a pragmatic approach to problems for which he preferred simple affordable solutions, so that he tended to avoid costly spectacular constructions such as aqueducts and long tunnels. These qualities put him in great demand by canal promoters in the 1790s. He was among the first engineers to appreciate the value of cast iron as a constructional material, recommending its use in the monumental Pontcysyllte aqueduct on the Ellesmere Canal, completed in 1805, and he acquired an interest as a founding partner in the Butterley Ironworks Company, Derbyshire. He also pioneered the use of iron railways in situations where canals were uneconomic, building the Surrey iron railway which opened in 1803. In the last part of his career, Jessop became much involved in harbour improvement projects, including the West India docks in London&#151;one of the first systems of enclosed docks&#151;and the Bristol docks, where his imaginative scheme for redirecting the tidal waters of the River Avon enabled the old river course through the city centre to be enclosed as the &#145;Floating Harbour&#146;. Soon after setting up in business on his own in 1772 Jessop was enrolled by Smeaton in the Society of Civil Engineers which was the first professional institution of engineers, and he came to take a prominent role in its activities.<br>
<br>Jessop married Sarah (<i>d</i>. 1816), the daughter of John Sawyer of Haddlesey, on 3 February 1777, and a few years later&#151;certainly by March 1784&#151;the couple were persuaded to make their home at Newark, convenient for work with the Trent Navigation, and for the Great North Road to London. Jessop was soon elected an alderman of Newark and served twice as mayor, in 1790&#150;91 and 1803&#150;4. Jessop and his wife had seven sons, four of whom followed him into the engineering profession, and one daughter. He was a man of simple tastes, ready to encourage younger engineers without becoming jealous of their success or that of colleagues, and he always showed concern for the safety of workmen on his projects. In 1805 the family moved to Butterley Hall in Derbyshire. Jessop died there on 18 November 1814, of paralysis after several years of declining health; he was buried in Pentrich churchyard, Derbyshire, on the 22nd.<br>
