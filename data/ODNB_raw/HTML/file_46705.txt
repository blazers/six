<span class="headword">Isabella</span>, <i>suo jure</i> countess of Gloucester  (<em>c.</em>1160&#150;1217), <span class="occ">queen of England, first consort of King John</span>, was the third and youngest daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/47236/', "William, earl of Gloucester (d. 1183)")</script>, and Hawisia (<i>d</i>. 1197), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1882/', "Robert, earl of Leicester (d. 1168)")</script>. Through her father she was first cousin once removed of Henry II. She emerged from obscurity in 1176, ten years after the death of her only brother, Robert, when King Henry and her father made her the centrepiece of a marriage agreement formalized on 28 September at Windsor. In his dynastic predicament Earl William betrothed Isabella to Henry's youngest son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/14841/', "John")</script>, and declared John the heir to Gloucester. Should the pope prevent the marriage on the grounds of the couple's close affinity, the king pledged to arrange the best marriage possible for Isabella; and if a legitimate son of the earl were to survive him, that son would divide the earldom with John. Contrary to an earlier custom, whereby inheritances were divided equally among daughters, Isabella's two sisters, who were already married&#151;Mabel to the future count of &Eacute;vreux, and Amicia to Richard de Clare, earl of Hertford (<i>d</i>. 1217)&#151;were excluded from the comital inheritance, explicitly in order to prevent its division, though they were to be provided with annuities of &pound;100 each.<br>
<br>When Earl William died in 1183, still without a male heir, the king, instead of pressing for the marriage of Isabella and John, took Isabella into wardship as the unmarried heir of a tenant-in-chief, and enjoyed the income from her lordships and demesne estates. Only after Richard I's accession in 1189 was Isabella's wardship ended and her marriage to John celebrated on 29 August at Marlborough. Archbishop Baldwin of Canterbury (<i>d</i>. 1190) reacted by summoning John before him to answer for his transgression against canonical prohibition of marriages within his degree of affinity to Isabella, and upon John's failure to appear, laid an interdict upon his lands. John appealed to an ecclesiastical council attended by the papal legate Giovanni di Anagni. Almost certainly out of deference to King Richard, the legate quashed the archbishop's penalty, and the pope never intervened. Some time between their marriage and 1199 Isabella and John visited Normandy, but by 1193 they seem to have become estranged. In that year, as part of his conspiracy with the French king, Philip Augustus, against his captive royal brother, John formally promised his continental overlord to marry the latter's half-sister Alice. John's implicit repudiation of Isabella probably resulted from their inability to have children, particularly a son.<br>
<br>After John became king upon Richard's death in 1199, he obtained an annulment of his marriage to Isabella on the grounds of consanguinity. Continental papal judges-delegate accomplished the desired divorce, whereupon the new king took his former wife, once again an unmarried heiress, into her second wardship along with most of her estates. John granted the comital title and a small fraction of the earldom's estates to Isabella's nephew, Amaury, count of &Eacute;vreux, to compensate him for the loss of his county which John would surrender to Philip in the treaty of Le Goulet (22 May 1200). In 1213, perhaps in anticipation of her death, Isabella made a will disposing of her moveable goods. However, by the beginning of 1214 her wardship had ended and a new marital gambit begun. On 26 January John announced that he had sold the right to marry the countess of Gloucester to Geoffrey de Mandeville for 20,000 marks. Earl Amaury's death without issue (<i>c</i>.1213) had made Isabella once more heir of the earldom of Gloucester. Apart from being a possible source of financial gain for John, the marriage was more of a political tool to be exploited by the king in his baronial relations than a desirable asset for Mandeville, whose proffer may have been made unwillingly. Among other things the earldom's most valuable manor, Bristol, was specifically excluded from the new earl's grant. John also required Mandeville to liquidate his debt in four instalments during 1214, and when he failed to keep to the payment schedule, the king confiscated the earl's Gloucester estates. Although they were restored and John offered to negotiate Mandeville's debt, Isabella and her husband joined the baronial rebellion against John.<br>
<br>During the second phase of the barons' war with the king, on 23 February 1216, Mandeville died of wounds received in a tournament. For about a year Isabella, usually styling herself &#145;countess of Gloucester and Essex in my free widowhood&#146;  (Patterson, nos. 142&#150;7) enjoyed possibly more personal freedom than at any other time during her adult life. But this situation ended some time in late 1217, possibly after 17 September, when <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/3991/', "Hubert de Burgh")</script>, justiciar and one of the regents for Henry III, became Isabella's third husband. Hardly had this been accomplished than the countess of Gloucester died on 14 October, supposedly at her father's Augustinian foundation, Keynsham Abbey, near Bristol, and was buried at Christ Church, Canterbury. The Gloucester earldom then passed via Isabella's sister Amicia to the latter's son Gilbert (<i>d</i>. 1230), commencing the Clare tenure of the earldom which was to last until 1314.<br>
