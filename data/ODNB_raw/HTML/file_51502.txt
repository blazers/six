<span class="headword">Boyle, Sir  Dermot Alexander</span>  (1904&#150;1993), <span class="occ">air force officer</span>, was born on 2 October 1904 at Belmont House, Rathdowney, Queen's county, Ireland, one of five children and the second of the three sons of Alexander Francis Boyle, estate agent, and his wife, Anna Maria, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Harpur. He was educated at St Columba's College, Dublin, from where he entered the newly established RAF College, Cranwell, in 1922.<br>
<br>After graduating in 1924 Boyle flew with 17 squadron at Hawkinge and then on air policing duties in Iraq, quickly gaining invaluable experience of air operations. Next, having qualified as a flying instructor, he was able to demonstrate his exceptional piloting skills in display flying at Hendon and elsewhere. In the 1930s he served with the Auxiliary Air Force, spent three years on the headquarters staff in India dealing with airmen's personal affairs, and later became chief flying instructor at Cranwell. He married on 5 September 1931 Una (<i>b</i>. 1907/8), daughter of the late Edward Valentine Carey, rubber planter. They had two sons and a daughter.<br>
<br>When the war started Boyle went to France with the advanced air striking force and ended up arranging its evacuation. Duties followed at Bomber Command headquarters, in command of a Hampden bomber squadron, and in 1941 in the Cabinet Office secretariat, where he gained an invaluable insight into the higher realms of policy making. He then commanded Stradishall, a large Bomber Command station, before becoming senior air staff officer in 83 group, one of the major tactical formations specially set up for the invasion of north-west Europe.<br>
<br>The war over, Boyle attended the Imperial Defence College, served as assistant commandant at the RAF Staff College, and directed personnel matters in the Air Ministry before returning to the bomber world in command of 1 group. Here his primary task was to see the RAF's first jet bomber, the Canberra, into squadron service. A wonderful aircraft, he called it, and he often flew it himself, most notably in 1952 when he led a flight on a 24,000 mile tour of South America. In 1953 he moved on to become commander-in-chief, Fighter Command, where after taking charge of the queen's coronation review at Odiham he oversaw the introduction of another of the RAF's great post-war aircraft, the Hunter. He was made KCVO and KBE in 1953, and GCB in 1957.<br>
<br>Boyle took over as chief of air staff from Sir William Dickson on 1 January 1956&#151;despite never having served on the Air Council, the usual prerequisite. He was the first incumbent not to have served in the First World War, and also the first Old Cranwellian. Lord Trenchard, the founder of the RAF College, had always looked forward to the day when a former cadet would reach the top of the RAF and none was more delighted when Boyle was appointed. Sadly, the new chief of air staff's first engagement was to attend the great man's funeral.<br>
<br>Soon afterwards Boyle became embroiled in the mounting crisis that followed Egypt's nationalization of the Suez Canal. While the military planning and preparations occupied much of his time, Boyle himself refused to become involved in the politics. He knew nothing of the Israeli connections, though he certainly shared his colleagues' misgivings about a situation in which the prime minister, Anthony Eden, was being steadily overwhelmed. His task was essentially to ensure that the RAF could play its part in operation Musketeer, and he shared the credit for the success of the air offensive carried out by the RAF in co-operation with the Fleet Air Arm and the French air force.<br>
<br>Boyle now faced problems of a different order in the course of a new major defence review. Inspired by the government's conviction that large savings in expenditure on conventional forces were essential to the improvement of Britain's economic performance, Duncan Sandys, the minister of defence, wrote a white paper which caused consternation around the RAF. Admittedly Boyle applauded one key aspect, its confirmation of the role of the V-bomber force in providing the United Kingdom's nuclear deterrent, in which he was a passionate believer. Sandys's other ideas were anathema, in particular his prediction that the advent of missiles could mean the end of manned fighter aircraft, and Boyle&#151;deciding that resignation would serve no purpose&#151;resolved to defend his corner. While he had no choice but to accept heavy cuts, especially in Fighter Command and Germany, he sought the backing of many influential friends, notably when he staged a special &#145;Prospect&#146; conference in London in April 1958. Here, in the presence of 300 important personalities in public life, he affirmed that the air staff still saw the manned aircraft as the ultimate means of defence. Amid the subsequent political uproar the prime minister, Harold Macmillan, had to come to the rescue in the House of Commons. Boyle trod somewhat more carefully from now on, but in tours to bases throughout the world he sought to keep the RAF itself informed about developments and to restore its personnel's belief in themselves and confidence in their future. His was a timely demonstration of inspired leadership whose result, as he himself later put it, was to preserve the fabric of the RAF.<br>
<br>Many other matters, too, engaged Boyle's attention, including an attempt by the navy, strongly encouraged by Lord Mountbatten when he became chief of defence staff, to take over the aircraft of Coastal Command, and a full-scale study of the future roles of air transport. In the nuclear field there were the successful tests of Britain's hydrogen bomb at Christmas Island; the agreement to deploy the American Thor nuclear missile in the United Kingdom&#151;a decision which Boyle supported since it brought the RAF into a new field of technology and would help prepare for the advent of Britain's intercontinental ballistic missile, Blue Streak; and the growing questions about Blue Streak itself, coupled with the possible acquisition of the air-launched Skybolt in its place. Moreover&#151;a major achievement&#151;he persuaded Sandys to agree to the development of the RAF's new strike and reconnaissance aircraft, the TSR 2.<br>
<br>At the end of 1959 Boyle handed over the post of chief of air staff to Sir Thomas Pike and accepted new challenges both in industry and in continuing connections with the RAF. As vice-chairman of the British Aircraft Corporation from 1962 to 1971 his service experience was invaluable for many aircraft projects, including the multi-role combat aircraft (MRCA), which eventually became the Tornado. The cancellations, on the other hand, horrified him, especially that of the TSR 2 in 1962; he simply could not believe that Sir Charles Elworthy, then chief of air staff, had gone along with it. Boyle also found time to guide the establishment of the RAF's own museum, at Hendon; as the first chairman of its board of trustees from 1965 to 1974 he provided much of the inspiration for this widely admired RAF institution. The RAF Benevolent Fund, of which he was deputy chairman, and the RAF Club, of which he was president, also owed him much, and to the end of his life he maintained his interest in the modern RAF, in its history, and in Cranwell, his alma mater.<br>
<br>Boyle died at Sway, Hampshire, on 5 May 1993, survived by his wife. He was one of the great father figures of the RAF. Superb flying ability, great staff skills, inspiring leadership, dominating presence, power to command an audience, charm, kindliness: such qualities made him one of the most respected and best-loved of all the RAF's high commanders.<br>
