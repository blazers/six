</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Bagehot,  Walter</span>  (1826&#150;1877), <span class="occ">political commentator, economist, and journalist</span>, was born on 3 February 1826 at Langport, Somerset, the second son of Thomas Watson Bagehot (1795&#150;1881), banker, and Edith Stuckey (1786&#150;1870), a niece of Samuel Stuckey, founder in 1772 of Stuckey's Bank, which issued its own banknotes and enjoyed considerable prominence and respect in the west country. The first born, Watson Bagehot, died at age three; Walter's mother, by an earlier marriage to Joseph Estlin of Bristol, had three sons, of whom two had died and the third was mentally handicapped.<h2>
<a name="Familyeducationandearlycareer"></a>Family, education, and early career</h2>From an early age Bagehot's attention was directed to the world beyond Langport. His uncle, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/48795/', "Vincent Stuckey")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/48027/', "Stuckey family")</script>], had ties to London politics, was acquainted with the politicians William Huskisson and Lord Althorp, and testified before parliamentary committees. Walter also was made acquainted with the republic of letters by his bookish father, who maintained a well-stocked and up-to-date library of French as well as English works on literature, philosophy, and history. He was thus exposed to the two kinds of activity that would occupy him during adult life&#151;practical politics, including the making of economic policy, and reflective intellectual inquiry, especially about literature and history.<br>
<br>Bagehot's family life was distinguished by a warm, affectionate relationship with his mother, who possessed beauty, wit, vitality, and charm, but also a tendency to psychotic episodes, perhaps related to the fates suffered by the three sons of her first marriage and the first-born of her second. Her illness clouded Walter's otherwise bright temperament, but it also intensified his devotion. With his father he enjoyed companionship based on their shared intellectual interests.<br>
<br>Bagehot's education began with the appointment of a governess when he was five. At nine he became a day scholar at Langport grammar school, where he remained for four years. In 1839, when thirteen, he attended Bristol College and performed brilliantly in classics, mathematics, German, and Hebrew. In 1842, age sixteen, he began at university, which meant residing a considerable distance from Somerset for the first time. Since Oxford and Cambridge were objectionable to Walter's Unitarian father because of their doctrinal tests, he entered University College, London, where he enjoyed the stimulation provided by this young, vigorous institution and by the surrounding metropolis. His explorations in London included attendance at <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/42282', "Anti-Corn Law League")</script> meetings, where he heard Cobden, Bright, and W. J. Fox. His studies emphasized classics, Roman history, mathematics, and poetry. He formed close friendships, particularly with Richard Holt Hutton (1826&#150;1897) and William Caldwell Roscoe (1823&#150;1859), and with them founded a debating society in which he took a leading part. After a one-year interruption caused by ill health, he took a first-class degree in classics in 1846; he stayed on for an additional two years studying political economy, metaphysics, and philosophy, earning the MA degree and a gold medal in philosophy in 1848.<br>
<br>It was time to choose a career. Bagehot considered law and banking, but also felt the lure of authorship. He began reading law in chambers with Charles Hall and Mr Quain, but without enthusiasm; persisting, however, he was called to the bar in 1852. Recognizing that his fluid, expansive mind was not suited to the law, he acknowledged his distaste for it and was happy to abandon it when his father suggested that he consider banking in Langport. This also was tempting because it allowed him to be near his ill mother. Thus barely weeks after qualifying he announced his determination to give up law &#145;utterly and forever&#146;.<br>
<br>This decision was made easier for Bagehot by a transforming experience only a few months earlier. He was in Paris on vacation and witnessed Louis Napoleon's <i>coup d'&eacute;tat</i> in December 1851. Unsettled by the threat of anarchy on the Parisian streets, he concluded that the coup was justified, and he sent a measured defence of it to <span class="italic">The Inquirer</span>, a Unitarian journal with which his friends Hutton and Roscoe were connected. Although the editor disagreed with Bagehot's views, the article appeared; others followed, and altogether seven were published early in 1852. Many readers, including some of Bagehot's friends, were outraged, for liberal opinion tended to be critical of Louis Napoleon even if not sympathetic to the republicans. In defending Louis Napoleon, Bagehot anticipated themes in his subsequent work&#151;that social order had to be defended against riot and convulsion; that French circumstances did not yet allow for constitutional liberty; and that liberty and representative government, valuable as they were, might be sacrificed to avoid revolution. He did not sympathize with Louis Napoleon's Caesarism, but he argued that French circumstances did not allow for the liberties he preferred. The articles gave Bagehot the gratification of confronting commonplace opinions with the conclusions of his independent mind&#151;and he relished being provocative. He had gone to Paris deeply troubled about his uncertain future, but while there he discovered that he had a distinctive perspective, a voice of his own: the attractions of authorship were to become irresistible.<br>
<br>On leaving Paris Bagehot began working in the family bank, but with an eye on a career as a writer. Yet he continued work at Stuckey's Bank for the next nine years, at first in Langport and then in Bristol, but his heart was no more in banking than it had been in law. He disliked the need for precision, complaining that &#145;sums are matters of opinion&#146;  (Barrington, 213). The counting-house routine was dull, but at least it left time for reading and writing. Though in charge of the large Bristol branch from the late 1850s, the calling to which he devoted himself was literature. Thus, less than a year after returning from Paris and abandoning London and the law, he founded (with Hutton) the <span class="italic">National Review</span>. During the following nine years he served as co-editor and contributed twenty-nine articles, including &#145;The first Edinburgh reviewers&#146;, &#145;Parliamentary reform&#146;, and pieces on Shakespeare, Cowper, Shelley, Dickens, Gibbon, Scott, Macaulay, and Peel.<h2>
<a name="MarriageandTheEconomist"></a>Marriage and The Economist</h2>A significant turning point came early in 1857 when, eager to contribute to <span class="italic">The Economist</span>, Bagehot was put in touch with the proprietor, James Wilson (1805&#150;1860), formerly an organizer for the Anti-Corn Law League, and now member for Devonport, privy councillor, and financial secretary to the Treasury. Bagehot quickly gained Wilson's confidence and was engaged to write a series of letters on banking. His connection with Wilson, who had six daughters, soon became even closer. Walter, with high spirits and tall good looks, was much appreciated, especially by Elizabeth (Eliza), the eldest. After several extended visits, they were engaged on 7 November 1857, and marriage followed on 21 April 1858. After a wedding trip through Devon and Cornwall, they settled in the Somerset countryside, near Clevedon, close to Bristol and not too far from Langport.<br>
<br>Bagehot wrote for <span class="italic">The National</span> and <span class="italic">The Economist</span> while continuing in the family bank, but this soon changed. Wilson went to India in 1859 as financial member of the supreme council of India, but died less than a year later. He had made Walter a director of the paper, and, with Hutton as editor, Bagehot actively managed it. His responsibilities increased when Hutton resigned in 1861, and he became editor, a post he held until his death sixteen years later. During this period he wrote articles&#151;one almost every week and sometimes more than one&#151;on a wide variety of political and economic subjects. He had been travelling to work from Somerset, but at this time he moved from the Bristol branch of Stuckey's Bank to London, where he supervised the London office. However, this was subordinated to his journalism as he was drawn into the larger metropolitan world, where he became a &#145;literary lion in the world of political magnates&#146;  (Barrington, 272). He became acquainted with major figures, including Gladstone, was a member of Brooks's and Windham's, and took up residence in Belgravia.<br>
<br>As a close observer and analyst of public life, Bagehot wrote about all aspects of politics&#151;the state of parties, the character of leaders, the fate of governments, the composition and reform of parliament, foreign policy, political events, leading figures, and crises in other countries. On whatever he wrote, however, his distinctive mode of analysis was to look beneath the surface to the underlying realities, where he identified problems and developments not noticed by conventional observers. He sought the &#145;living reality&#146;, which often was concealed by &#145;the paper description&#146; or by myths or conventional wisdom. This made him aware of hardly visible changes that were disguised by &#145;outward sameness&#146;, and it led him to abandon old maxims that relied on what once might have been true but which were true no longer. Beneath the surface he discerned the &#145;practical machine&#146; that produced the real outcomes.<h2>
<a name="TheEnglishConstitutionandtheanalysisofpoliticalsociety"></a>The English Constitution and the analysis of political society</h2>This approach was nowhere more evident than in Bagehot's most famous book, <span class="italic">The English Constitution</span> (1867), in which he analysed the major institutions of British government. It was initially published as nine essays in the <span class="italic">Fortnightly Review</span> between 15 May 1865 and 1 January 1867, a time of intense discussion of parliamentary reform, including an extension of the suffrage. Bagehot rejected the conventional account which held that the most important functions of government were performed by the legislative, executive, and judicial powers, and that each of these was separate from and checked the expansion of the others. A look at the realities, Bagehot argued, would show that the constitution consisted of two parts, the dignified and the efficient. The dignified part, mainly the monarchy, but including, in some respects, the House of Lords, was important, not because it governed, but because it attracted the attention and gained the reverence and obedience of the multitude, thus giving legitimacy to government. The dignified part sustained the authority of government but had little role in exercising that authority.<br>
<br>Real authority was located in parliament, especially the House of Commons, where executive and legislative functions were intricately combined. The House of Commons had many functions&#151;to express the mind of the nation, to teach, to inform, and of course to legislate. Its most important function, however, was to appoint the cabinet, which Bagehot described as a committee of the legislature selected to perform the executive function. This reality was ignored by the traditional language of politics, in large part because the highly visible dignified part of the constitution disguised the realities of power located in the efficient part.<br>
<br>Bagehot is especially well known for his interpretation of the monarchy. He emphasized the theatrical dimension of its activities. The uneducated multitude focused on its ceremonies, which were readily comprehended, and this left the cabinet and parliament to exercise authority without excessive intrusion from the uneducated populace. The monarchy also served other purposes: it headed the nation's morality&#151;with the head of a family on the throne, sovereignty was made acceptable in a family-oriented nation&#151;and it stifled rebellion, as even the discontented hesitated to rebel against a government of which a revered monarch was a part. But above all, the monarch generated reverence and thus strengthened government with something like the strength of religion. This understanding influenced interpretations of the monarchy well into the twentieth century. George V studied <span class="italic">The English Constitution</span> and believed himself to have been influenced by Bagehot's interpretation of the monarchy.<br>
<br>This interpretation was the occasion for Bagehot to introduce the concept of deference as a category of political analysis. It described the conduct of the multitude which made it possible for the efficient part of government&#151;the executive&#151;to exercise authority without being hampered by democratic pressures. Deference was given not to the real rulers but to the theatrical show of society with its display of wealth and enjoyment, headed by the monarch. &#145;The apparent rulers &hellip; are like the most imposing personages of a splendid procession: it is by them the mob are influenced; it is they whom the spectators cheer. The real rulers are secreted in second-rate carriages; no one &hellip; asks about them, but they are obeyed implicitly and unconsciously by reason of the splendour of those who eclipsed and preceded them&#146;  (<span class="italic">Collected Works</span>, 5.379&#150;80). The spectacle overwhelmed the imagination of the populace, and it reflected a tacit agreement that the numerous, unwise part of the country would be ruled by the less numerous, wiser part. It was an abdication in favour of an &eacute;lite which consisted of perhaps 10,000 persons&#151;in effect, the educated part of the middle-class. This understanding reflected Bagehot's assumption that society was divided (but without the necessity for class conflict) between its tiny &eacute;lite and the remainder of the populace, which without embarrassment he called uncultured, rude, narrow-minded, unintelligent, and incurious. His concept of deference reflected his insight into the relation of social structure to political institutions. It was still invoked in the mid-twentieth century to explain why substantial segments of the working-class electorate voted for tories.<br>
<br>Bagehot's interpretation of politics reflected his living in a pre-democratic age. Consequently, with increasing democratization and mass education, his interpretation has become implausible. Some critics, however, have denied that it was valid even when Bagehot wrote. His reliance on the concept of deference to explain political loyalties has been implicitly questioned by E. P. Thompson, whose hypothesis that in nineteenth-century England there was working-class consciousness, class enmity, and great potential for revolution made it necessary for him to deny a strong presence of deference among the working classes. Bagehot's interpretation of the monarchy has been disputed by historians with republican sympathies who regret the late nineteenth-century elaboration of the ceremonial role of the monarch and the great increase in the popularity of the monarchy during the century since Bagehot wrote. Some have even held Bagehot responsible for these developments, suggesting that he encouraged them to forestall the emergence of democratic forces and republican sentiment.<br>
<br>Bagehot disapproved of democracy on the grounds that it would give superiority to the uneducated; it would encourage demagogues who would mislead the poor, and thus he regarded it as pernicious. Yet he recognized a tendency in all modern societies to raise the average and lower those at the summit, and he understood that deference would disappear once democracy was established. He became pessimistic in the face of the difficulties of stemming the democratic tide. The only long-term remedy was to ensure that the working classes had education, morality, and comfort. Meanwhile concessions to democratic demands had to be made. The parliamentary reforms he was prepared to accept were modest: the influence of landed wealth was to be reduced; the more sensible representatives of new business wealth were to be incorporated into the ruling &eacute;lite; and parliament was to be made more responsive to the needs of the working classes. His principle was to allow each person as much power and influence that could be exercised without reducing the power of those who were more fit to exercise it. In practice this meant he defended a property qualification, as he regarded property as an approximate indicator of political intelligence, education, and ability. He was prepared, however, to experiment with ways to increase representation for the working classes; reversing an earlier view, he came to the conclusion that women should be allowed to vote, subject to the same restrictions as men.<br>
<br>Bagehot's judgements of political figures, both contemporaries and those of an earlier generation, reflected his general political perspective. He greatly appreciated those, such as Sir Robert Peel, who worked effectively to make the efficient part of government run smoothly. These were the ones who engaged in politics as a profession&#151;as &#145;political business&#146;. He also approved of those, such as Edmund Burke, who shared his understanding of the need for the conciliation of discontents, but also for the preservation of liberty and stability. And he was critical of advocates of democracy, such as John Bright, who seemed indifferent to these considerations. Dullness he did not mind (provocatively, he called it stupidity), for it was essential for the preservation of liberty; its opposite, found in speculative minds, was dangerous, as it led to unnecessary political experiments. Thus he criticized intellectuals, the &#145;too clever by half&#146; people, who were out of touch with public opinion.<br>
<br>In Bagehot's appreciative description of the English constitution he frequently pointed to contrasts with government in America, and this became a comparison of parliamentary and presidential types of government. The parliamentary type fixed ultimate power of decision in one place, in a newly elected House of Commons; it made government by discussion possible; it placed the choice of leaders among members of parliament, who were competent to judge the qualifications of the candidates; and it was capable of responding to a crisis. In contrast, the American constitution, by establishing checks and balances, divided power; it placed too much power in the hands of an incompetent populace and it was disabled in a crisis. Bagehot wrote many articles about the American Civil War, its origins, progress, and aftermath, and he often pointed to that calamity as a vindication of his preference for parliamentary government.<br>
<br>Giving political labels to Bagehot is difficult, for he sometimes leaned left, sometimes right, and never very far in either direction. Nominally he was a Liberal&#151;when he stood for parliament it was as a Liberal, and his affiliation with <span class="italic">The Economist</span>, which had been linked with the free-trade movement, re-enforced this connection. This affiliation was combined, however, with conservative tendencies, evident in his criticisms of democracy and John Bright, in his concern about symptoms of instability, in his critique of intellectuals, whom he also called &#145;enthusiasts&#146;, and in his affinities with Burke's political outlook. He preferred middling governments, dominated by either liberal conservatives or conservative liberals. He is most appropriately labelled a centrist, for he saw dangers in the doctrinairism of the right which resisted change and of the left which was eager to accelerate it. Bagehot, always cautious, sought a balanced combination of tradition and innovation. In this he displayed a similarity to Macaulay. He has been called a crossbencher by nature, and he famously said he was &#145;between sizes in politics&#146;  (Barrington, 11).<br>
<br>Bagehot's appreciation of both conservative and liberal values was reflected in <span class="italic">Physics and Politics</span> (1872), in which he acknowledged the usefulness of custom, stability, and cohesion, while also recognizing that such things could be obstacles to discussion, progress, trade, and increased abundance. He put forward a hypothesis about social development which was based on historical study as well as writings about anthropology, and the book reflected the influence of Henry Sumner Maine, the jurist who emphasized the importance of historical study of legal concept, as well as Charles Darwin and other writers on evolution. Bagehot assumed a pre-political era, from which mankind emerged when it established nations with fixed rules&#151;laws and a &#145;cake of custom&#146;. The resulting society was unified but also stationary, isolated, status-ridden, hostile to trade, and unable to change&#151;that is, to improve itself. With great difficulty and very slowly, and in very few places, this changed. Where discussion was allowed, variant customs were examined and natural selection took place; intelligence and originality were encouraged, human nature sprung forth, and the yoke of custom was thrown off. Thus a shift occurred from stationary conditions to an age of choice, trade, liberty, and economic growth. He was not recommending that custom be abandoned in pursuit of progress, but rather that a useful combination of features of both types of society be found. This was Bagehot's attempt to examine scientifically the political prerequisites of progress. His categories, historical claims, and assumptions later came to be regarded as obsolete, and this book has had less claim on the attention of posterity than some of his other works.<br>
<br>Although on three occasions Bagehot failed to win election to parliament (for Manchester, 1865; Bridgwater, 1866; University of London, 1867), he gained great influence by virtue of his forceful writing, his intimate knowledge of the City and Westminster, and his acknowledged authority as editor of a prestigious weekly. He realized that &#145;effective articles in great journals&#146; could be decisive, especially in times of crisis, and though modesty prevented his claiming such influence, when writing these words he knew they described some of his own journalism. He confessed to his fianc&eacute;e, &#145;I covet <i>power</i>, influence,&#146; and he certainly achieved it  (St John-Stevas, &#145;Walter Bagehot&#146;, 25).<h2>
<a name="Bagehotaseconomistandliterarycritic"></a>Bagehot as economist and literary critic</h2>As an economist Bagehot is best known for <span class="italic">Lombard Street</span> (1873), which J. M. Keynes called &#145;an undying Classic&#146;  (Buchan, 242). It analysed the actual working of the banking system and was based on personal experiences and close observation. He focused on the role of the Bank of England, pointing out that since it served as a banker's bank, was the repository of monetary reserves for the entire nation, and had immense influence on the country's financial health, it ought to acknowledge that it functioned as a central bank. He proposed changes that would allow it to perform this role more effectively. To allow it to reduce the impact of trade cycles, he recommended that the bank increase gold reserves in prosperous times, and that in depressed periods, as a matter of policy, it advance a large amount of credit to sound businesses. The book had great influence and several of its recommendations ultimately were adopted; it was regarded as authoritative well into the twentieth century, and it made a significant contribution to the theory of central banking.<br>
<br>In <span class="italic">Lombard Street</span>, as in <span class="italic">The English Constitution</span>, Bagehot sought to describe and explain arrangements already in place which, while imperfect, served many useful purposes. He demonstrated great insight, but not the explanatory power claimed by classical economists with a universalistic perspective. This was in keeping with his belief (reflecting the influence of evolutionary theory) that political economy ought to recognize that different economies require different explanations, depending on the extent of their development and cultural circumstances. Consequently, when in the mid-1870s he set out to write a major treatise on political economy, he aimed to make his analysis concrete and empirical and to avoid claims to universal validity. By criticizing abstraction in economic theory, he anticipated behaviourist theories that explain economic events in terms of actual behaviour, including the motives, hopes, and fears of those whose conduct affects the economy. This work was not completed; the first part was published as <span class="italic">Postulates of Political Economy</span> (1876), and the remaining fragments were included in his posthumous <span class="italic">Economic Studies</span> (1880).<br>
<br>Bagehot's views also appeared weekly in <span class="italic">The Economist</span>, where he addressed many issues of economic and financial policy. He favoured free trade and competition, criticized protection and monopoly, and was sceptical about imperial expansion. On the whole he advocated <i>laissez-faire</i> policies, though without dogmatism, for he allowed many exceptions. He supported the income tax, favoured nationalization of the railways, and approved proposals for a universal coinage and decimalization. He recognized that the <span class="roman">Factory Acts</span> were beneficial, and while critical of organized labour he accepted that labour ought to have a right to organize. Always attentive to swings in the trade cycle, he often warned about overconfidence in the business community, reminding his readers, &#145;All people are most credulous when they are most happy&#146;  (W. Bagehot, <span class="italic">Lombard Street</span>, 1915, repr. 1931, 151). Bagehot's economic journalism was taken seriously in the City, by businessmen, and in Whitehall.<br>
<br>Bagehot's views have been criticized by twentieth-century economists, but the standing he once had is indicated by acknowledgements of his influence on central bankers in Britain and America in the 1920s. In his own time he testified before select committees and was elected to the Political Economy Club in 1864. He often was consulted by ministers and civil servants, and in response to a request from the chancellor of the exchequer (Sir Stafford Northcote) in 1876 for suggestions about how to raise short-term money, he invented the Treasury bill. Gladstone called him &#145;a sort of supplementary Chancellor of the Exchequer&#146;  (Buchan, 246).<br>
<br>As Gladstone's observation indicates, Bagehot was much more than a journalist, though in that capacity he stood out as one whose accounts of events provided a rich understanding of how political and economic developments unfolded in the world of practice. His quest for understanding of the underlying structure and principles that shaped surface reality led to his recognition of the importance of non-rational dimensions of political and economic conduct, and to his development of explanatory concepts, such as &#145;deferential community&#146; and dignified and efficient parts of the constitution, which have been continuously useful to political analysts.<br>
<br>Bagehot also wrote about literature, both historical and contemporary, mainly British, and also about a few French writers. His interest in literature had begun early, and his enthusiasms and negative reactions were highly personal; they were reflected in his published criticisms, in his appreciation of Scott, for example, and in his doubts about Shelley and Dickens. While his essays were often illuminating, his judgements did not reflect a theoretical perspective, and his attempt to establish a typology has proved disappointing. As a result of this absence of a coherent theory about literature, he has no enduring place in the history of literary criticism. As Ren&eacute; Wellek has concluded, &#145;Bagehot seems not very important today, though he is sane, representative, and symptomatic enough to deserve some attention&#146;  (Wellek, 4.180). At most, his discursive articles provide insights and arresting observations, as when he said Dickens &#145;describes London like a special correspondent for posterity&#146;  (<span class="italic">Collected Works</span>, 2.87).<h2>
<a name="Personallife"></a>Personal life</h2>Religion played a part in Bagehot's life, but its demands on him were not insistent. His parents were deeply religious but worshipped differently, his mother accepting the Church of England orthodoxy, while his father, like some of his ancestors, became Unitarian. Bagehot did not follow his father's example, though he was less than orthodox, as he had doubts about some historical claims of Christianity, which, however, did not prevent him from defending revelation. Although influenced by Darwinian ideas, he did not regard evolutionary theories as incompatible with belief in a deity. He was sufficiently interested in religious questions to take part in discussions at the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/45584', "Metaphysical Society")</script>, where leading representatives of all branches of Christianity, including Catholicism, as well as positivists, agnostics, and freethinkers, explored their differences. As in politics, Bagehot occupied a middling position. He rejected atheism and agnosticism, and while he admired J. H. Newman, he was not tempted by Catholicism. He was untroubled by religious diversity, and in the debating society he helped found while an undergraduate he spoke in opposition to government suppression of blasphemous publications. In papers read at the Metaphysical Society in 1870 and 1874, he revealed a suspicion that there was a widespread wish to persecute&#151;sceptics by believers and believers by some sceptics&#151;which he deplored.<br>
<br>Bagehot's physical appearance was striking: tall, slender, a mass of wavy black hair (and in a surviving portrait, a heavy black beard), a ruddy complexion, and fiery eyes&#151;if not handsome, he was not easily ignored. In temperament he struck others as high-spirited, buoyant, vivacious, imaginative, and playful, but also as modest and self-deprecating. In his own description, he was cheerful but not sanguine, this perhaps reflecting what he called life's &#145;dark realities&#146;&#151;an allusion to his mother's illness. His conversation displayed acuity, liveliness, and whimsical humour, and was said to be racy. He impressed a sister-in-law as a man in whom &#145;life and thought and fancy abounded&#146;  (Barrington, 231). It was said that one seldom asked Bagehot a question without the answer making one think, or laugh, or both together. His lively mind was reflected in his original phrase making, for example, &#145;animated moderation&#146;, &#145;removable inequalities&#146;, &#145;blind money&#146;, and &#145;the cake of custom&#146;. He was the first to use &#145;padding&#146; as applied to writing.<br>
<br>Bagehot's interests and activities were varied. He loved the countryside, especially in Somerset. A dashing rider, he was fond in early life of hunting: &#145;There is as much variety of pluck in writing across a sheet as in riding across a country&#146;. An avid reader, especially of literature, he greatly admired George Eliot and was a regular visitor at her Sunday at homes. Among his closest friends, in addition to Richard Holt Hutton and William Roscoe, were James Bryce (1838&#150;1922), Lord Carnarvon (1831&#150;1890), Matthew Arnold (1822&#150;1888), and Arthur Hugh Clough (1819&#150;1861). He was excellent at chess and often relaxed over a game with Hutton at the Athenaeum after sending <span class="italic">The Economist</span> to the printer; his election to membership at the Athenaeum in 1875 was an acknowledgement of intellectual eminence. He succeeded his father as vice-chairman of Stuckey's Bank and was continually occupied in managing the investments of his ageing father and the Wilson family. His last residence, at 8 Queen's Gate Place, was decorated and furnished by William Morris's firm, and Morris himself designed the drawing room. But for all the variety in his life (which did not include children of his own), work was all. He claimed there never was a week without doing some business, which meant some writing. &#145;As to holidays&#146;, he advised Hutton, &#145;it is one of the lessons of life to learn to be independent of them&#146;  (<span class="italic">Collected Works</span>, 13.673).<br>
<br>Bagehot's personal life was less than happy. His sadness about his mother's illness deepened in the mid-1860s when she became worse and needed continuous surveillance during the years before her death in 1870. From his marriage he may not have received much solace. Although it began with intense passion and evident happiness&#151;Walter and Eliza's surviving love letters testify to it&#151;after a few years some distance between them seems to have developed as Bagehot devoted long hours to his busy life away from home. His wife continually complained of many small symptoms and often retreated to her room with headaches. She became irascible and also withdrew from much of Bagehot's social life, leaving him to attend dinners and other events by himself or in the company of a sister-in-law. His wife was devoted to him but could not share his intellectual interests. On the other hand, he was not the easiest of husbands, as he was always working to a deadline. After his mother's death, his devotion to writing became even more frantic, leaving little time for domestic life. Financially, Bagehot was well off, and could have expected considerable wealth; had he lived longer, he would have inherited a substantial part of the family investments. These included the bank as well as fleets of barges and ocean-going ships. His wife could also have expected a considerable legacy from her father's estate.<br>
<br>Although quite vigorous and fond of exercise, Bagehot tended to get respiratory infections, which became especially frequent during the 1870s. He also had poor vision and a weak heart, and he suffered from migraine. In March 1877 in London he came down with a cold which turned into &#145;congestion of the lung&#146;. Having promised his father he would visit over Easter, he travelled to Herd's Hill, Curry Rivell, near Langport, where he died, apparently of pneumonia, on 24 March 1877. He was buried in the family vault at All Saints' Church, Langport, Somerset.<br>
