<span class="headword">Edwards,  James Coster</span>  (1828&#150;1896), <span class="occ">terracotta manufacturer</span>, was born at Trefnant in Denbighshire on 7 November 1828, the son of William Edwards (1797&#150;1877) and his wife, Diana Coster (1796&#150;1875). His father was employed as a clerk at some local coalmines, having originally moved north from Montgomeryshire to transport coal, iron, lime, and slate on the Ellesmere and Montgomeryshire canals. His mother was born at Llanymynech on the border between Shropshire and Montgomeryshire.<br>
<br>After an elementary education, Edwards began work as an apprentice to a draper in Wrexham, leaving to become a storekeeper at the New British Iron Company's works in Acrefair, Denbighshire. From around 1850 he was working clay deposits near Ruabon, at Cefn and Acrefair. At the age of about thirty he was involved in an unsuccessful venture in operating a smelting works. Edwards married Elizabeth (1833&#150;1920), daughter of Evan Edwards, a draper at Mold, on 24 May 1859. The couple had five daughters and two sons. About 1860 his father bought some coal works, and Edwards used the clay from the seams to make common bricks and earthenware, in a yard where he employed a man and two boys. He became the first to exploit fully the value of the red Ruabon marls and so helped to initiate the recovery of the local economy from the long recession caused by the decline of the iron industry. As the market for architectural and industrial ceramics developed, new works were established and, by the time of its founder's death, the firm employed nearly a thousand men in four large factories. The name of J. C. Edwards was by then widely respected among late Victorian architects and builders, and its ceramics were renowned for their durability and brilliant colours.<br>
<br>A works at Trefnant, located between Ruabon and Llangollen, was bought in the 1860s; it housed the production of encaustic tiles and sanitary pipes and was expanded to cover 6 acres. In 1871 or the following year Edwards took over two kilns at Penybont, to the south of Ruabon and sited by one of the richest clay reserves of the area. This claypit, so rich that it was called the &#145;clayworkers' Eldorado&#146;, was initially used for the manufacture of roofing tiles and facing bricks. The marls proved ideal for being pressed and fired into the bright red terracotta for which the business became famous. Terracotta, large blocks of red or buff clayware moulded with florid decoration, was used on commercial and public buildings in most industrial cities, but most widely in Birmingham, Leeds, and the towns of south Lancashire and Cheshire.<br>
<br>Among the most important contracts that J. C. Edwards supplied were most of the Prudential offices designed by Alfred Waterhouse and the exterior of the assize courts in Birmingham by Aston Webb and Ingress Bell, built 1887&#150;91. For more modest buildings, a range of copings, pier caps, and other components could be ordered from catalogues. While Edwards is supposed to have designed some of the details himself, he also commissioned architects for designs. Douglas and Fordham, for example, were responsible for a range of chimney tops. The Penybont works was extended in response to growing demand, so that it incorporated forty-five kilns and provided employment for five hundred workers in 1896. In 1883 a new works was opened at Coppy, Denbigh, for the manufacture of glazed and enamelled bricks. Pottery making was introduced in the fourth of Edwards's factories, at Plas Kynaston.<br>
<br>After about 1890 Edwards progressively withdrew from the management of his business to pursue responsibilities as a landowner and as a figure within the county. He moved into Trevor Hall near Llangollen and purchased the adjacent West Tower estate. He held office as a justice of the peace, deputy lieutenant, and, in 1892&#150;3, as high sheriff, in the county of Denbigh. In the spring of 1896 he went to Guernsey for a recuperative holiday, but died on 26 March at the Old Government House Hotel. He was buried at Llantysilio church, near Llangollen. His sons, James Coster Edwards (1864&#150;1934) and E. Lloyd Edwards (1860&#150;1956), inherited the business. Terracotta was made on a decreasing scale in the Edwardian and inter-war periods. His grandson, the son of Edward Lloyd, with the name of James Coster Lloyd Edwards (<i>b</i>. 1897), was groomed to take over the business but died of appendicitis in 1930. Flooring tiles and facing bricks made up the bulk of the production until the firm was sold in 1956.<br>
