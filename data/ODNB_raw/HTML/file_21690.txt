<span class="headword">Pearce,  Samuel</span>  (1766&#150;1799), <span class="occ">Baptist minister</span>, the son of William and Lydia Pearce, was born at Plymouth on 20 July 1766. His father was a silversmith; his mother died when he was a child, and he was brought up by his grandfather until he was seven or eight. He studied at the Baptist college, Bristol (1786&#150;9), and in 1790 became minister of Cannon Street Baptist Church, Birmingham. There he laboured successfully until his death. On 2 February 1791 he married Sarah, daughter of Joshua Hopkins, a widower and a businessman of Alcester, Warwickshire. He wrote a number of affectionate love letters to his bride-to-be.<br>
<br>Pearce was one of the founder members of the Baptist Missionary Society, founded on 2 October 1792, which he passionately supported throughout his short life, assisting the society in various ways. He was disappointed to be turned down for missionary service, having studied Bengali for that purpose. He wrote several hymns which were included in nonconformist hymnals. He was a man of outstanding spirituality and wrote in a letter of 9 May 1791 to his friend William Steadman, &#145;I want to walk with God as Enoch walked&#146;  (Fuller, 8). Physically he was never very robust, and he died from tuberculosis on 10 October 1799 in Birmingham, where he was subsequently buried; his wife survived him by less than five years.<br>
