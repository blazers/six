<span class="headword">McIntosh,  Angus</span>  (1914&#150;2005), <span class="occ">linguistic scholar</span>, was born on 10 January 1914 at Healeyfield, Whitburn Road, Cleadon, co. Durham, the elder son of Kenneth McIntosh, accountant and insurance broker, and his wife, Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Thompson. He was educated at Ryhope grammar school and Oriel College, Oxford, graduating in 1934 with first-class honours in English language and literature. A Harmsworth scholarship at Merton College led in 1936 to a diploma in comparative philology. He spent 1936 to 1938 at Harvard University as a Commonwealth Fund fellow, graduating (in 1937) AM in comparative literature, before taking up a lectureship in the department of English at University College, Swansea. In 1939 he married Barbara Bainbridge (1917&#150;1988), a New Englander. They had two sons and a daughter. His academic career was interrupted by the Second World War. From 1940 to 1945 he was in the army, beginning as a trooper (private) in the tank corps and ending as a major in military intelligence. His most significant war work was at Bletchley Park where, with other academics turned code-breakers, he contributed to the Ultra operation that followed the decryption of the Enigma cipher. His time at Bletchley strongly influenced his thinking about problems in the history of the English language. In particular he foresaw the potential of computers as a tool to aid linguistic analysis.<br>
<br>From 1946 to 1948 McIntosh was lecturer in medieval English at the University of Oxford: after tutoring at Jesus College and Wadham College he was lecturer then student (fellow) at Christ Church. In 1948 he was appointed Forbes professor of English language and general linguistics at the University of Edinburgh and thereafter his academic career was based in Edinburgh. After the establishment of a separate chair in general linguistics in 1964, he held the new Forbes chair of English language until 1979. From then on, as emeritus professor, he became full-time director of the Middle English Dialect Project, which he had initiated in 1952 and which was the source of his most important work. He had been joined at an early stage of the project by Michael Samuels (later professor of English Language at the University of Glasgow) and subsequently also by Michael Benskin (later professor of older English at the University of Oslo). The culmination of this work came in 1986 with the publication of <span class="italic">A Linguistic Atlas of Late Medi&#339;val English</span>.<br>
<br>During his long academic career in Edinburgh, McIntosh displayed a tremendous breadth of interest, and a creative energy that led to the inception of a number of major enterprises. As well as setting up the Middle English Dialect Project (later the Institute for Historical Dialectology) he was a prime mover in the establishment of the Linguistic Survey of Scotland and of the university's school of Scottish studies and school of applied linguistics. He was a key supporter of the <span class="italic">Scottish National Dictionary</span> and the <span class="italic">Dictionary of the Older Scottish Tongue</span>. After his retirement in 1979 he was honoured by two separate Festschriften, celebrating the main areas of scholarship that he fostered in his teaching and research. The first focused on philology and historical linguistics: the dialectology of medieval English, Scots, and Hiberno-English, codicology, textual studies and scribal orthographies, word-geography, onomastics, and the rise of standard English. The second reflected his general linguistic interests in language structure, syntax, style, and metre. In both areas McIntosh not only published himself but was also an inspirational and generous motivator of research.<br>
<br>McIntosh's intellectual vision led him constantly to forge connections between the disciplines with which he was engaged, and he never lost this capacity for flexible cross-disciplinary thinking. Indeed it was McIntosh's involvement with the modern language Linguistic Survey of Scotland that provided the context for one of his most important insights in the historical study of language. It was already well known that Middle English in its written forms exhibited high degrees of linguistic variation, which had broad correlation with the regional geography of England. What had not been attempted before was the application of the methodology of modern dialect surveys to past stages of the language. McIntosh experimented with the Linguistic Survey data, discovering that it was possible to localize material from informants purely on the evidence of their linguistic forms. The method McIntosh devised became known as the &#145;fit-technique&#146;, and it revolutionized dialect research in historical linguistics.<br>
<br>McIntosh served on numerous academic councils, committees, and editorial advisory boards, and was awarded many honours. From 1977 to 1989 he was president (and thereafter honorary president) of the Scottish Text Society. He was a member of the council of the Early English Text Society and a foreign member of the Finnish Academy of Sciences and Letters. He held honorary doctorates from the universities of Poznan (1972), Durham (1980), Glasgow (1994), and Edinburgh (2004). He was a fellow both of the British Academy (which awarded him its Sir Israel Gollancz prize in 1989) and of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. After his death in 2005 his name was added to the Institute for Historical Dialectology annual lecture, and in 2007 the Scottish Text Society also established an annual lecture in his name. His academic legacy included a corps of active researchers, at the University of Edinburgh and elsewhere, pursuing work in the tradition whose foundation he laid.<br>
<br>McIntosh was inspirational not just as an academic. He combined charm, wit, and determination with the capacity for making others feel the possibility of success. He led by example and his interests were always translated into action. His entry in <span class="italic">Who's Who</span> listed as his recreations gardening, painting, and music, in all of which he was, at one time or another, a proficient practitioner. He was also an accomplished and published poet. If the size of his academic projects was on a monumental and serious scale, his poems tended towards economy&#151;haikus, tankas, limericks, and clerihews&#151;delighting in the whimsical nature of language. Following the death of his first wife, in 1988 he married Karina Williamson, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Side (<i>b</i>. 1928), the widow of Colin Williamson, a fellow of Jesus College, Oxford. In the last years of his life McIntosh continued to enjoy the company of his friends and large, far-flung, extended family. He died peacefully at Liberton Hospital, Edinburgh, on 26 October 2005 of kidney failure and renovascular disease. His funeral in the kirk of the Canongate, Edinburgh, on 3 November 2005 was a glorious celebration of his life, character, and achievements. He was buried in the Grange cemetery, Edinburgh. He was survived by his second wife, Karina, and the three children of his first marriage.<br>
