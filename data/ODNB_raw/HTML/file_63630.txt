<span class="headword">Mackie,  Charles</span>  (1688&#150;1770), <span class="occ">historian and university teacher</span>, was born at Limekilns, near Dunfermline, Fife, on 31 March 1688, the son of William Mackie (<i>d</i>. 1699), then minister at Portmoak, Kinross-shire, and his wife, Christine (<i>d</i>. 1688), daughter of Magnus Aytoun, clerk at Burntisland. Mackie's mother died when he was six months old, and his father subsequently married Margaret, sister of William Carstares, principal of the University of Edinburgh. Following his father's death in 1699 Mackie is said to have become an intimate in the Carstares household, and his uncle may have overseen his university education, at Edinburgh, where he matriculated in 1702 and graduated in 1705; at Groeningen, from 1707 to 1708; and at Leiden, in 1715 and later. On 3 February 1726 Mackie married Ann (<i>d</i>. 1770), daughter of Henry Hamilton, an Edinburgh surgeon, and reputed to be the Hamilla of the song &#145;To Mistress A. H.&#146; in the <span class="italic">Tea Table Miscellany</span>. They had thirteen children, all of whom died in childhood, the last in 1747.<br>
<br>On 28 August 1719 Edinburgh town council appointed Mackie the first professor of universal history in the university, at a salary of &pound;50 per annum. Initially the appointment was to last only until 1723, but it was permanently extended in 1722. Mackie's duties were extensive and included responsibility for Western history as well as for the history of Scotland, and for Greek, Roman, and British antiquities. Manuscript copies of some of his courses survive. Despite his continuing to lecture in Latin at a time when some others in Scotland were beginning to use English his courses were popular, his annual salary and fees averaging a comfortable &pound;185 during his best years. Mackie taught until 1753, when because of his bad state of health he requested that the town council appoint John Gordon to be his colleague. Within a year, however, Gordon himself resigned, but he was soon replaced by William Wallace, which finally allowed Mackie at least to retire from teaching. In 1765 Wallace became professor of Scots law and Mackie retired completely, leaving sole possession of the chair to his friend John Pringle.<br>
<br>Mackie left no published works that can be certainly identified as his, though there is evidence that he may have written <span class="italic">Antiquitatum romanarum brevis descriptio</span>. This work possibly was published in the early 1740s, but the only surviving copies are from 1759. A basic set of notes intended for antiquities students, it covers in factual outline Roman religious, civil, and military antiquities, and its topics generally parallel those of a surviving manuscript of Mackie's antiquities lectures (&#145;On Roman antiquities&#146;, Edinburgh University Library, MS La.III.758). Throughout his career Mackie was fascinated by chronology. His surviving papers contain numerous chronological notes and schemes, ranging from meticulous lists of the dates of death of public figures (for example, his &#145;Commonplace book and obituary, 1737&#150;1749&#146;, ibid., MS La.III.537), to summaries of Newton's thinking on the subject (&#145;Miscellaneous manuscripts&#146;, Edinburgh University Library, MS La.II.37), to his own &#145;Chronological whim&#146;, in which he speculates that important historical events occur in complementary pairs that are equidistant from a central point in time, the birth of Christ (&#145;Miscellaneous notes&#146;, MS La.III.253, fol. 2). He seriously considered publishing for his students a table of chronology to supplement N. Lenglet du Fresnoy's <span class="italic">Tablettes chronologiques de l'histoire universelle</span> (1729), but the project was abandoned in the 1740s. As a working historian Mackie laid greatest emphasis on accuracy, fidelity, and impartiality; &#145;Truth&#146;, he declared in one of his commonplace books, &#145;is the very soul of history&#146;  (&#145;Commonplace books kept&#146;, MS Dc.5.24<sup>2</sup>). His notes suggest that his approach to history involved the critical examination of sources, the careful evaluation of evidence, and wariness about subjective bias. Perhaps his most typical discussion is &#145;On the sources of vulgar errors in history&#146;  (&#145;Miscellaneous manuscripts&#146;, MS La.II.37, fols. 92&#150;104), a paper delivered in 1741 in which he analyses historical prejudices and distortions in light of Francis Bacon's &#145;idols of the mind&#146;. Mackie does not seem to have given much attention to the construction of historical narrative or to the graces of style, matters that would be left to the next generation, particularly one of his most famous students, William Robertson.<br>
<br>Yet despite this somewhat traditional approach to history Mackie contributed to the more liberal educational atmosphere that emerged in Edinburgh during the 1730s and 1740s. He was a mason of the Canongate-Kilwinning lodge, a member of the Old Revolution Club, and, perhaps most importantly, a member of the Rankenian Club (indeed a copy of William Wishart's inaugural address as principal of the University of Edinburgh survives in Mackie's &#145;Miscellaneous manuscripts&#146;). Here he joined others besides Wishart&#151;such as Robert Wallace, Colin MacLaurin, and John Stevenson&#151;to help to create a programme of study that would appeal to landed gentlemen, not just clergymen, and emphasize polite learning, civil history, and civic virtue. His long and intimate friendship with Alexander Melville, fourth earl of Leven (which is documented in a large collection of letters), his extensive correspondence with travellers and residents on the continent, plus a list of students that included John Home, Sir Gilbert Eliot, George Dempster, John Erskine of Carnock, Sir Robert Murray Keith, and Sir Andrew Mitchell&#151;all demonstrate Mackie's participation in the evolution occurring in Edinburgh intellectual life.<br>
<br>Mackie died in Edinburgh on 11 September 1770, following his wife, who had died on 1 January. His rather unorganized papers went primarily to Edinburgh University Library, although he also left some money, books, and manuscripts to Joseph Maccormick, &#145;whom he had patronized and assisted&#146;  (Mackie, &#145;Notebook&#146;).<br>
