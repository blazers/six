<span class="headword">Chadwick,  David</span>  (1821&#150;1895), <span class="occ">accountant and company promoter</span>, was born on 23 December 1821 at Macclesfield, Cheshire, the youngest of the nine children of John Chadwick, accountant, and his wife, Rebecca. His schooling was only brief and was terminated at an early age by employment in a warehouse. By attending evening classes, however, Chadwick eventually took up his father's occupation, and in 1843 he began to practise as an accountant. Between 1844 and 1860 he was treasurer to the corporation of Salford, and he also undertook that office for the town's gasworks, waterworks, and magistrates. In 1844 he married Louisa (<i>d</i>. 1877), youngest daughter of William Bow of Boughton, Manchester. The couple had a son and two daughters.<br>
<br>Chadwick's employment stimulated his interest in sanitary and educational questions. He began to publish widely in this field, and in a large number of papers and pamphlets he frequently combined a new and growing interest in statistics with the investigation of urban problems and conditions. In addition he also registered a series of patents for water meters, between 1853 and 1860. Chadwick's best-known statistical publication was <span class="italic">On the rate of wages in 200 trades and branches of labour in &hellip; the manufacturing district of Lancashire</span> (1859), which was first read as a paper to the Statistical Society of London. A member of the council of that society from 1865 to 1867, he also served as president of the Manchester Statistical Society.<br>
<br>Chadwick played a prominent role in the establishment of both the Salford Royal Free Library and Museum and the Salford Working Men's College. He subsequently served as treasurer of both institutions. His expertise was such that he advised the promoters of the act which enabled local authorities to establish public libraries and museums. One of his most important public achievements in Manchester occurred in 1868, when the city first appointed a medical officer of health. As an officer of local government it would seem that Chadwick became well acquainted with the middle classes of the industrial north-west; for when he returned to private accounting practice in Manchester, in 1860, all the evidence points to him providing a conduit for the savings of this social group to pass into the shares of industrial companies.<br>
<br>During the 1860s Chadwick's partnership was titled Chadwick, Adamson McKenna &amp; Co.; and a London office was opened in 1864 or 1865. However, the frequent change of partner&#151;Chadwick had ten associates between 1860 and 1892 and from seven he was separated by lawsuits&#151;suggests he was not an easy man to work with. Indeed, it was later noted that he &#145;found excitement in litigiousness&#146; rather than in the stock exchange, racing, betting, or gambling  (Cottrell, <span class="italic">DBB</span>, 626). Notwithstanding such difficulties, between 1862 and 1874 Chadwick was responsible for the &#145;promotion&#146; of at least forty-seven limited companies, transforming them from private partnerships to publicly owned companies. Many of these were already household names, such as Charles Cammell &amp; Co., the Ebbw Vale Steel, Iron, and Coal Company, John Brown &amp; Co., and Bolckow, Vaughan &amp; Co. Chadwick's first industrial promotion concerned the Ashbury Carriage Company, a Manchester firm, but during the mid-1860s most of his energies were absorbed in the conversion of Sheffield and Cleveland manufacturing and mining companies. Generally these were private affairs, with large proportions of the shares being acquired by Chadwick's &#145;friends&#146; in Manchester and Salford, while Chadwick charged the vendors a commission of 1 per cent for his services. He was also linked, increasingly, with a group of financiers associated with the private bank of Glyn Mills, as well as with the International Financial Society.<br>
<br>In his approach to company promotion Chadwick set the highest of standards by employing professional valuers; nor did he inflate the value of the assets in question through having them sold initially to &#145;dummy&#146; vendors. By the 1870s his activities encompassed a wider range of financial securities; these included domestic and American railway shares and bonds, American land sales, shares of overseas mining, telegraph, and tramway companies, and domestic commercial and public utility companies. This broadening of his business interests led to a greater resort to the publication of prospectuses in order to attract subscriptions to his conversions, and between 1870 and 1875 he produced his own <span class="italic">Investment Circular</span>.<br>
<br>Chadwick's national importance as an industrial financier resulted in his giving evidence before a parliamentary committee in 1867 concerned with the operation of company law. In that year he was called before the select committee on the <span class="roman">Limited Liability Acts</span>, which met following the financial crisis of 1866. In the aftermath of the crash Chadwick's firm was involved in the rescue of four banks which had stopped trading: the Agra and Masterman's, the Bank of London, the Consolidated Bank, and the Preston Bank.<br>
<br>In 1868 Chadwick entered the Commons as the Liberal member for Macclesfield, and he acted there as a knowledgeable commentator on government measures to reform company law. He played a prominent role in 1876 when he introduced his own legislation in an attempt to place the legal framework for company conversions on a more satisfactory basis.<blockquote>Chadwick's concerns were to make the details of company flotation public knowledge, to ensure that companies had sufficient capital with which to commence business and to see that every company published uniform profit and loss accounts, balance sheets and annual reports. (Cottrell, <span class="italic">DBB</span>, 629)</blockquote>Although his bill failed, his ideas were to be taken up by others in 1884 and again in 1887. However, Chadwick was unseated as an MP in 1880 following a successful petition, from a Conservative agent, which had alleged bribery and other electoral malpractices.<br>
<br>Chadwick remained an accountant throughout his life and during the 1880s acted largely for the companies that he had converted over the two previous decades. He also took a leading part in the professionalization of accountancy, being a founder member and fellow of the Institute of Accountants (London) and first president of the Manchester Institute of Chartered Accountants, established in 1871. A decade later Chadwick was one of the first council members of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales. This interest was matched by his concern to provide public education, which in turn reflected his own, possibly bitter, experience of self-improvement through evening classes. In 1876 Chadwick gave a library of 10,000 books to his home town of Macclesfield. In addition he was involved with the creation of Royal Holloway College, London, and he later became a trustee of the estate and a governor of the college.<br>
<br>Chadwick was a busy &#145;high Victorian&#146; with a wide range of interests in public affairs. Privately he had little time for leisure, apart from the occasional game of billiards, and it was noted by his contemporaries that he gained the greatest excitement from his relentless pursuit of law cases. Chadwick's first wife died in 1877, and he then married, in 1878, Ursula, eldest daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26033/', "Thomas Sopwith FRS")</script>. Ursula Chadwick may have had a difficult time as during the last ten years of his life her husband became increasingly self-opinionated. This character trait certainly led him to dramatic public clashes, as with the boards of the companies that he had promoted, and the author of an obituary later discussed his character in terms of an &#145;aversion to criticism, advice or opposition, or even to listen to caution&#146;  (quoted in Cottrell, <span class="italic">DBB</span>, 630).<br>
<br>From the late 1870s the number of company flotations began to fall, and Chadwick was increasingly involved with his proposed company law reforms. He also fought a long series of actions arising from his promotion of the Blochairn Iron Company in 1873. In the event the action against him was dismissed, and he was awarded full costs. Although Chadwick continued to act as accountant for the companies he had floated, the 1880s witnessed a gradual decline of his entrepreneurial energy. He continued to write and publish occasional pamphlets on economic and financial matters, his final paper in 1890 being concerned with profit sharing.<br>
<br>Chadwick suffered from increasing deafness and blindness, and he finally died on 19 September 1895 at his home, The Poplars, 6 Herne Hill, London. He was survived by his second wife.<br>
