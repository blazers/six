<span class="headword">Rhodes,  John Milson</span>  (1847&#150;1909), <span class="occ">general practitioner and poor-law reformer</span>, was born on 14 September 1847 in Broughton, Salford, Lancashire, the youngest of the three sons of Milson Rhodes (1818&#150;1884), fustian salesman, and his wife, Ann Keith (1818&#150;1885), daughter of Thomas Wemyss, of York, teacher and biblical scholar. Rhodes's parents were both born in Yorkshire. Among his first cousins was Sir Thomas Wemyss Reid, litt&eacute;rateur and editor of the <span class="italic">Leeds Mercury</span>. Rhodes matriculated at Glasgow University about 1865; his family lived in Glasgow from about 1863 to 1868. After deciding to follow his brothers into the medical profession, Rhodes attended Owens College, Manchester, and the Manchester school of medicine, where he was a major prizewinner. In 1874 he obtained the LRCM and LRCS in Edinburgh; in 1879 he graduated MD in Brussels.<br>
<br>From 1874 until his death Rhodes was a general practitioner in Didsbury, near Manchester. Familiar in the village as a tall, neat, kindly, and scholarly bachelor, he was a member of Didsbury Liberal Club and a sidesman at Emmanuel (Anglican) Church. In addition to running his busy practice, Rhodes was a factory surgeon and a medical referee for an insurance company. A prolific writer, he contributed articles to the medical press on topics as diverse as infant mortality, the alleged increase in insanity, and hospital floors. His article &#145;The poor law and the medical profession&#146; appeared posthumously in the <span class="italic">British Medical Journal</span> in 1910.<br>
<br>It was as a poor-law expert and reformer that Rhodes was best-known. In 1880 he was appointed overseer of the poor for Didsbury in Chorlton (south Manchester) union, and in 1882 he was elected to the Chorlton board of guardians. In 1891 he became the first chairman of the Northern Workhouse Nursing Association and in the early 1900s he chaired the central poor-law conference of England and Wales and the Association of Poor Law Unions. He was vice-president of the Soci&eacute;t&eacute; Internationale d'Assistance Publique and held office on international infant-welfare committees.<br>
<br>Rhodes gave evidence before the royal commissions on the care and control of the feeble-minded (1904&#150;8) and on the poor laws (1905&#150;9). He was much in demand as a lecturer to statistical and scientific societies, and a noteworthy lecture to the British Association, entitled &#145;Pauperism past and present&#146;, in 1890, was discussed in a leader in <span class="italic">The Times</span>; it was also translated into French and widely circulated in pamphlet form. Between 1886 and 1906 Rhodes presented some thirty papers at central and district poor-law conferences, covering such topics as provision for epileptic and weak-minded paupers, the care of infants and children, and the design, nursing, and dietary practices of workhouses. A recurring theme was the iniquities of the &#145;general mixed workhouse&#146; and the need for separate provision for different groups, the cost of special schemes being mitigated by neighbouring unions working together. Rhodes backed a plan to move 300 workhouse children to the country. In 1898, as chairman of Chorlton union's schools and cottage homes committee, he officially opened Styal Cottage Homes in Cheshire.<br>
<br>Rhodes's chairmanship of the Chorlton board from 1894 to 1898 coincided with a time of great hardship and overcrowding at the union workhouse, and in 1898 he organized a combination with the neighbouring Manchester union to establish joint casual wards in the city centre. He visited rural colonies for epileptics in Germany (1897) and in the USA (1901) and his favourable reports encouraged the authorities in Chorlton and Manchester to build a joint epileptic colony at Langho near Blackburn, which was opened in 1906. Rhodes also helped establish epileptic colonies in Cheshire and Birmingham.<br>
<br>For nearly thirty years a member and chairman of the board of guardians of the huge Chorlton union, south of Manchester, Rhodes spearheaded many reforms which were held up for praise by the Local Government Board and emulated in other unions. In his efforts to control able-bodied paupers while protecting the aged and the feeble &#145;deserving&#146; poor at as little cost to the ratepayers as possible, Rhodes was no different from the majority of guardians, but his rational investigations into the causes of pauperism and his ability to communicate his findings to others placed him in a class apart. As he observed towards the end of his career:<blockquote>If I have done good work for the poor it has been by bringing science to bear upon it, and by trying to show a good many of the causes lying at the root of the evils under the existing system. (<span class="italic">Manchester Evening Chronicle</span>)</blockquote>Rhodes's research led him to his major conclusion: that outdoor relief was a perpetuator of pauperism and a waste of the poor rate. He advocated instead the provision by boards of guardians&#151;in combination if necessary&#151;of separate institutions for vagrants, children, the elderly, sane epileptics, and the mentally defective. Such institutions would be kinder to the young, the old, and the sick; would deter wastrels; would ensure that those able to work earned part of their keep; and would help prevent that anathema to eugenicists, &#145;the multiplication of the unfit&#146;. In response to criticism of such expenditure, Rhodes insisted that <i>laissez-faire</i> would no longer do and that this use of public money would, in the long run, result in public benefit.<br>
<br>In 1892 Rhodes became a Liberal councillor (and later alderman) for Lancashire and did sterling work on the Lancashire Asylums Board, particularly in making provision for incurable cases. In 1906 he was appointed a JP and visiting justice to HM prison, Strangeways. Rhodes died at his home, Ivy Lodge, 104 Wilmslow Road, Didsbury, near Manchester, on 25 September 1909, after accidentally taking an overdose of strychnine. A funeral service was held on 29 September at Emmanuel Church and his body was later cremated at Manchester crematorium.<br>
