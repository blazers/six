<span class="headword">Towne <span class="st"> [Town]</span>,  Charles</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1763, <em>d.</em> 1840), <span class="occ">animal painter</span>, was born in Wigan and baptized there on 7 July 1763, the third of the five children of Robert and Mary Town. The family were poor, but probably had artistic leanings, for Charles was selling drawings to bring in money by the age of eight, and at twelve he walked to Leeds to work for the landscape artist John Rathbone. His elder brother Robert having moved to Liverpool, Charles joined him there, becoming a coach-painter and for a time a japanner and ornamental painter. He worked for periods in Lancaster and Manchester but by 1785 he had returned to Liverpool, where on 8 May he married a widow, Margaret Harrison.<br>
<br>In the marriage register Towne's occupation is given as coach-painter, but the register recording the birth of the first of his five children, Ellen, in 1786, calls him &#145;painter&#146;, and by 1789, at the birth of his second daughter, Elizabeth, he is described as a horse painter. This turn perhaps reflects a conscious decision on Towne's part to follow in the footsteps of Liverpool's most famous artistic son, George Stubbs. In 1787, at the second exhibition of the Liverpool Society for Promoting Painting and Design, Towne showed a small landscape, but he created a greater stir by copying from memory Stubbs's exhibits, <span class="italic">Haymakers</span> and <span class="italic">Reapers</span>. The equestrian portraits of 1792&#150;4 which are his earliest securely dated works are clearly indebted to Stubbs's example.<br>
<br>Although Towne is recorded at a Liverpool address in 1796, he had for several years been working extensively around Manchester. Joseph Farington, on a trip to the town in November 1796, noted that Towne had copied a painting by Richard Wilson at Platt Hall as part of a commission from Henry Blundell of Ince  (Farington, <span class="italic">Diary</span>, 3.687), and the following July he reported that &#145;Towne is much employed at Manchester, has 6 months work bespoke&#146;  (ibid., 3.872). Towne had in the meantime been to London, where he had &#145;improved much&#146;  (ibid.) from seeing the 1797 Royal Academy exhibition and had visited the studio of Philip de Loutherbourg. The latter's influence is manifest in Towne's <span class="italic">The Monarch of the Glen</span> of 1797 (Walker Art Gallery, Liverpool), a grand view of highland cattle in a mountain landscape.<br>
<br>Towne appears to have lived in London from 1799 to 1804, for he showed nine works, chiefly cattle in landscapes, at the Royal Academy between these dates from addresses in the city and in Camberwell. In 1799 he began adding the &#145;e&#146; to his surname (although the form Town is found on signed works after this date). At this time too, as a Liverpool obituarist later put it, &#145;he associated intimately with the celebrated George Morland, mastering his principles of composition, and imbibing much of his feeling for colour&#146;  (<span class="italic">Liverpool Mail</span>, 9 Jan 1840). This influence extended beyond the artistic to the whole tenor of Towne's later life; for like Morland, Towne appears to have chased work continuously, to have spent money as quickly as he earned it, and to have had regular encounters with burglars, bailiffs, and unscrupulous dealers. Farington stated that Towne was making as much as &pound;600 a year in 1798  (Farington, <span class="italic">Diary</span>, 3.990) and thereafter his output of work, carefully tailored to the tastes of conservative provincial patrons, was prodigious; yet in later life he operated from the small parlour of a two-room house, and he died&#151;according to the testimony of Catherine King, who was perhaps his second wife&#151;worth less than &pound;300.<br>
<br>Towne worked in the home counties before returning to Liverpool in or shortly before 1810. He was probably drawn back by news of the imminent creation of the Liverpool Academy, under the patronage of Henry Blundell. Towne is listed as one of the academy's founder members, showed at its first four exhibitions, 1810&#150;13, and served as vice-president in 1812&#150;13. His failure to exhibit in the following year was probably connected with the academy's impending temporary demise; when it was revived in 1822, he showed at its next three exhibitions. After 1825, however, he withdrew from its affairs altogether, and between 1827 and 1833 he sent to the exhibitions of the Royal Manchester Institution instead.<br>
<br>An advertisement in the <span class="italic">Liverpool Mercury</span> in January 1813 announced that Towne was setting up as a picture restorer.<blockquote>He also continues to paint Portraits of Horses, Dogs and Cattle in general, at various prices from Six, to Sixty Guineas, according to the size of the Picture, style of finishing, &amp;c.&#151;Views of Park and other Scenery, painted in a superior style.</blockquote>For the next twenty-five years (although there are signs of increasing delicacy and refinement and a gradual abandonment of warm &#145;old master&#146; tonalities in the 1820s and 1830s) his art scarcely altered. Some of the buildings in his later works suggest that patrons came from as far afield as Yorkshire and Scotland, but the majority of them were from Lancashire and Cheshire; and although Towne may have travelled to visit them, he remained based in Liverpool. His latest known dated paintings, from 1838, show no sign of decline, although by then he must have been seriously afflicted by the dropsy from which he died at his home in Norton Street, Liverpool, on 6 January 1840. Ninety-seven paintings by Towne, covering all aspects of his career, are in the Walker Art Gallery, Liverpool.<br>
